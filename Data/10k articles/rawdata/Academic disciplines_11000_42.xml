'''Ben Shneiderman''' (born August 21, 1947) is an American [[Computer science|computer scientist]], a Distinguished  University Professor in the  [[University of Maryland Department of Computer Science|Department of Computer Science]], which is part of the [[University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences]] at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], and the founding director (1983-2000) of the   [[University of Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab]]. He conducted fundamental research in the field of [[human–computer interaction]], developing new ideas, methods, and tools such as the [[direct manipulation interface]], and his eight rules of design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~ben/goldenrules.html |title=Shneiderman's Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design |date= |accessdate=2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in New York, Shneiderman, attended the [[Bronx High School of Science]], and received a BS in Mathematics and [[Physics]] from the [[City College of New York]] in 1968. He then went on to study at the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]], where he received an MS in Computer Science in 1972 and graduated with a PhD in 1973.

Shneiderman started his academic career at the [[Farmingdale State College|State University of New York at Farmingdale]] in 1968 as Instructor at the Department of Data Processing. In the last year before his graduation he was Instructor at the Department of Computer Science of [[Stony Brook University]] (then called State University of New York at Stony Brook). In 1973 he was appointed Assistant Professor at the [[Indiana University]], Department of Computer Science. In 1976 he moved to the University of Maryland. He started out as Assistant Professor in its Department of Information Systems Management, and became Associate Professor in 1979. In 1983 he moved to its [[University of Maryland Department of Computer Science|Department of Computer Science]] as Associate Professor, and was promoted to full professor in 1989. In 1983 he was the Founding Director of its [[University  of Maryland Human – Computer Interaction Lab|Human-Computer Interaction Lab]], which he directed until 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/members/bshneiderman/full-resume.pdf CURRICULUM VITAE (June 20, 2014)] at cs.umd.edu. Accessed 14-04-2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nassi–Shneiderman diagram ===
[[Image:Multiple Branching.svg|thumb|280px|Example of a Nassi–Shneiderman diagram]]
In the 1973 article "Flowchart techniques for structured programming" presented at a 1973 [[SIGPLAN]] meeting [[Isaac Nassi]] and Ben Shneiderman argued:

{{quote|With the advent of structured programming and GOTO-less programming a method is needed to model computation in simply ordered structures, each representing a complete thought possibly defined in terms of other thoughts as yet undefined. A model is needed which prevents unrestricted transfers of control and has a control structure closer to languages amenable to structured programming. We present an attempt at such a model.&lt;ref&gt;Nassi, Isaac, and Ben Shneiderman. "Flowchart techniques for structured programming.|''ACM Sigplan Notices'' 8.8 (1973): 12-26.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The new model technique for [[structured programming]] they presented has become known as the [[Nassi–Shneiderman diagram]]; a graphical representation of the design of structured software.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Shneiderman. "[http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/members/bshneiderman/nsd/ A short history of structured flowcharts (Nassi–Shneiderman diagram)]," at www.cs.umd.edu. May 27, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flowchart research ===
In the 1970s Shneiderman continued to study programmers, and the use of [[flow chart]]s. In the 1977 article "Experimental investigations of the utility of detailed flowcharts in programming" Shneiderman et al. summarized the origin and status quo of flowcharts in [[computer programming]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Flowcharts have been a part of computer programming since the introduction of computers in the 1940s. In 1947 Goldstein and von Neumann [7] presented a system of describing processes using operation, assertion, and alternative boxes. They felt that "coding begins with the drawing of flow diagram." Prior to coding, the algorithm had been identified and understood. The flowchart represented a high level definition of the solution to be implemented on a machine. Although they were working only with numerical algorithms, they proposed a programming methodology which has since become standard practice in the computer programming field.
&lt;ref&gt;B. Shneiderman, R. Mayer, D. McKay, and P. Heller. "[http://cgis.cs.umd.edu/~ben/papers/Shneiderman1977Experimental.pdf Experimental investigations of the utility of detailed flowcharts in programming]," Communications of the ACM, Vol. 20, Iss. 6, June 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, Shneiderman had conducted experiments which suggested that [[flowcharts]] were not helpful for writing, understanding, or modifying computer programs. At the end of their 1977 paper, Shneiderman et al. concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although our original intention was to ascertain under which conditions detailed flowcharts were most helpful, our repeated negative results have led us to a more skeptical opinion of the utility of detailed flowcharts under modern programming conditions. We repeatedly selected problems and tried to create test conditions which would favor the flowchart groups, but found no statistically significant differences between the flowchart and non-flowchart groups. In some cases the mean scores for the non-flowchart groups even surpassed the means for the flowchart groups. We conjecture that detailed flowcharts are merely a redundant presentation of the information contained in the programming language statements. The flowcharts may even be at a disadvantage because they are not as complete (omitting declarations, statement labels, and input/output formats) and require many more pages than do the concise programming language statements.&lt;ref&gt;Shneiderman et al. (1977, p. 380)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== ''Designing the User Interface,'' 1986 ===
In 1986, he published the first edition (now on its sixth edition) of his book "Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective Human-Computer Interaction." Included in this book is his most popular list of "[http://www.cs.umd.edu/~ben/goldenrules.html Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design]," which read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
# Strive for consistency. Consistent sequences of actions should be required in similar situations ... 
# Enable frequent users to use shortcuts. As the frequency of use increases, so do the user's desires to reduce the number of interactions ... 
# Offer informative feedback. For every operator action, there should be some system feedback ... 
# Design dialog to yield closure. Sequences of actions should be organized into groups with a beginning, middle, and end ... 
# Offer simple error handling. As much as possible, design the system so the user cannot make a serious error ... 
# Permit easy reversal of actions. This feature relieves anxiety, since the user knows that errors can be undone ... 
# Support internal locus of control. Experienced operators strongly desire the sense that they are in charge of the system and that the system responds to their actions. Design the system to make users the initiators of actions rather than the responders.
# Reduce short-term memory load. The limitation of human information processing in short-term memory requires that displays be kept simple, multiple page displays be consolidated, window-motion frequency be reduced, and sufficient training time be allotted for codes, mnemonics, and sequences of actions.&lt;ref&gt;Shneiderman (1998, p. 75); as cited in: [http://www.cs.umd.edu/~ben/goldenrules.html "Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design"]. at www.cs.umd.edu. Accessed 15.04.2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These guidelines are frequently taught in courses on Human-Computer Interaction.

=== Direct manipulation interface ===
Shneiderman's cognitive analysis of user needs led to principles of [[direct manipulation interface]] design in 1982: (1) continuous representation of the objects and actions, (2) rapid, incremental, and reversible actions, and (3) physical actions and gestures to replace typed commands, which enabled designers to craft more effective graphical user interfaces. He applied those principles to design innovative user interfaces such as the highlighted selectable phrases in text, that were used in the commercially successful Hyperties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/hyperties/]&lt;/ref&gt;  Hyperties was used to author the world's first electronic scientific journal issue, which was the July 1988 issue of the ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'' &lt;ref&gt;[https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/1988/7]&lt;/ref&gt; with seven papers from the 1987 Hypertext conference.  It was made available as a floppy disk accompanying the printed journal.  [[Tim Berners-Lee]] cited this disk as the source for his "hot spots" in his Spring 1989 manifesto &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html]&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[World Wide Web]].  Hyperties was also used to create the world's first commercial electronic book, ''Hypertext Hands-On!'' in 1988.
 
Direct manipulation concepts led to [[touchscreen]] interfaces for home controls, finger-painting, and the now ubiquitous small touchscreen keyboards. The development of the "Lift-off strategy"&lt;ref name=Potter1988&gt;{{cite conference|authors=Potter, R., Weldon, L., Shneiderman, B.|title=Improving the accuracy of touch screens: an experimental evaluation of three strategies|conference=Proc. of the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, CHI '88|location=Washington, DC|pages=27–32|doi=10.1145/57167.57171|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/localphp/hcil/tech-reports-search.php?number=88-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208121730/http://www.cs.umd.edu/localphp/hcil/tech-reports-search.php?number=88-04|archivedate=2015-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[University of Maryland Human–Computer Interaction Lab]] (HCIL) researchers enabled users to touch the screen, getting feedback as to what will be selected, adjust their finger position, and complete the selection by lifting the finger off the screen.
 
The HCIL team applied direct manipulation principles for touchscreen [[home automation]] systems, finger-painting programs,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cSemy8Ytsw]&lt;/ref&gt; and the double-box range sliders&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/spotfire/]&lt;/ref&gt;
that gained prominence by their inclusion in [[Spotfire]].  The visual presentation inherent in direct manipulation emphasized the opportunity for information visualization.

=== Information visualization ===
His major work in recent years has been on [[information visualization]], originating the [[treemap]] concept for hierarchical data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/treemap-history history page]&lt;/ref&gt; Treemaps are implemented in most information visualization tools including [[Spotfire]], [[Tableau Software]], [[QlikView]], [[SAS (software)|SAS]], [[JMP (statistical software)|JMP]], and [[Microsoft Excel]]. Treemaps are included in hard drive exploration tools, stock market data analysis, census systems, election data, gene expression, and data journalism. The artistic side of treemaps are on view in the [http://treemapart.wordpress.com Treemap Art Project].

He also developed dynamic queries sliders with multiple coordinated displays that are a key component of [[Spotfire]], which was acquired by [[TIBCO]] in 2007.  His work continued on visual analysis tools for time series data, [[TimeSearcher]], high dimensional data, [[Hierarchical Clustering Explorer]], and social network data, SocialAction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SocialAction |publisher=University of Maryland  |url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/socialaction/ |date=December 30, 2007 |accessdate=2007-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shneiderman contributed to the widely used social network analysis and visualization tool  [[NodeXL]].

Current work deals with visualization of temporal event sequences, such as found in Electronic Health Records, in systems such as [[LifeLines2]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/lifelines2 |title=Lifelines2 |publisher=umd.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[EventFlow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/eventflow |title=EventFlow |publisher=umd.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tools visualize the categorical data that make up a single patient history and they present an aggregated view that enables analysts to find patterns in large patient history databases.

=== Universal usability ===
He also defined the research area of [[universal usability]] to encourage greater attention to diverse users, languages, cultures, screen sizes, network speeds, and technology platforms.

'''Braunschweigisches Landesmuseum''' (''BLM'') is a [[history museum]] in [[Braunschweig]], Germany, operated by the state of [[Lower Saxony]]. The museum is scattered on four locations: ''Vieweghaus'', ''Hinter Ägidien'' (both in Braunschweig), ''Kanzlei'' ([[Wolfenbüttel]]) and ''Bauernhausmuseum'' ([[Bortfeld]]).

The collection covers 500,000 years and includes objects from the history of the [[Brunswick Land|Braunschweig area]], including culture, economy, technology, folk arts, and social history. Today, the BLM hosts a collection of 600,000 to 800,000 objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{De icon}} [http://www.3landesmuseen.de/Geschichte.467.0.html BLM] Sammlung &gt; Sammlungsbestände &gt; Die Sammlungsbestände des Braunschweigischen Landesmuseums. Retrieved 2013-01-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The museum's history dates back to October 11, 1891, when it was founded in the [[Duchy of Brunswick]] as ''Vaterländisches Museum für Braunschweigische Landesgeschichte''.&lt;ref&gt;{{De icon}} [http://www.3landesmuseen.de/Geschichte.467.0.html BLM] Über uns &gt; Geschichte &gt; Landesgeschichte seit mehr als 120 Jahren. Retrieved 2013-01-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally it was located in a street called ''Hagenscharrn'' in the city of Braunschweig. In 1938, the museum was renamed to Braunschweigisches Landesmuseum für Geschichte und Volkstum. This name remained until December 31, 1982.

==Vieweghaus==
The [[Neoclassicism|neoclassicist]] building, the former publishing house of [[Vieweg+Teubner Verlag|Vieweg Verlag]], hosts the main collection, and is located in the [[Innenstadt (Braunschweig)|city center]] at the [[Dankwarderode Castle|castle square]] (''Burgplatz''). A large part of the collection was moved there in 1986. &lt;!-- Highlights are... --&gt;

==Hinter Ägidien==
Located in the street ''[[Aegidienkirche, Braunschweig|Hinter St. Aegidien]]'', this annex exhibits [[Jewish ceremonial art|Judaica]] and was opened to the public in 1746. Center piece is a [[synagogue]] interior from [[Hamburg]].

==Kanzlei Wolfenbüttel==
This annex focuses on prehistoric and ancient history (500,000 BC until 8th century AD) of the region and was established there in 1959. The building was built in the 16th century and is located in the city center.

==Bauernhausmuseum==
The Bortfelder Bauernhausmuseum section was opened in 1968 and is located in Bortfeld, a village in the municipality of [[Wendeburg]], [[Peine (district)|district of Peine]].

It is part of [[Alliant International University]] where each campus's [[clinical psychology|Clinical Psychology]] [[Psy.D.]] and [[Ph.D.]] program is individually accredited by the [[American Psychological Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/ed/accreditation/programs/|title=APA-Accredited Programs|website=www.apa.org|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school has trained approximately half of the licensed psychologists in California.

The school has degree programs in [[clinical psychology]], [[marriage and family therapy]], [[Licensed professional counselor|clinical counseling]], [[Organizational Psychology]], and [[psychopharmacology]] at campuses in [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Diego]], [[Fresno]], [[Sacramento]], and [[Irvine, California|Irvine]], and abroad in [[Tokyo]], Hong Kong and [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alliant's Locations and Campuses|url=http://www.alliant.edu/locations/|publisher=Alliant International University|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; CSPP is one of a handful of APA- accredited schools that also offered a clinical doctoral respecialization in professional psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/ed/graduate/respecialization.aspx|title=Respecialization in Professional Psychology|website=www.apa.org|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The California School of Professional Psychology (CSPP) was founded in 1969 under the auspices of the California Psychological Association. CSPP was the first free-standing school of professional psychology in the nation,&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; and remains the largest non-profit professional psychology school in the nation.

The goal of CSPP is to train doctoral level psychologists in professional practice models and to assure that its students and faculty are as diverse as the State of California. At its founding CSPP, worked out of borrowed or rented space with a volunteer (unpaid) faculty, but had a large number of student applicants who were attracted to the new training model.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

The founding president of CSPP was [[Nicholas Cummings|Nick Cummings]], PhD, who was succeeded by John O'Neill and subsequently by Judith Albino, PhD. (Mary Beth Kenkel, PhD and [[Rodney L. Lowman]], PhD also served as interim presidents.) During the 2000s, under Albino's tenure, CSPP was renamed Alliant University and the four separately accredited campuses in Fresno, Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco were combined into a single WASC-accredited institution. The name was subsequently changed to Alliant International University after Alliant merged with (acquired the assets of) U.S. International University, based in San Diego. USIU was known for their faculty of humanistic psychologist that included [[Carl Rogers]], [[Abraham Maslow]], [[Viktor Frankl|Victor Frankl]], and [[Igor Ansoff]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=CSPP's History – Mission – Vision|url=http://www.alliant.edu/cspp/about-cspp/mission-vision-history.php|publisher=Alliant International University|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, CSPP is one of several schools that make up Alliant International University including a school of education, forensic psychology, a school of management and a law school. CSPP remains the largest of the schools.

CSPP became accredited by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] (WASC) in 1977. By the mid-1980s all of its Clinical Psychology programs became accredited by the [[American Psychological Association]] and its Marriage and Family Therapy programs are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education of the [[American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy]] (AAMFT). Each psychology doctorate degree program ([[Ph.D.]] or [[Psy.D.]]) on each campus is accredited individually by the [[American Psychological Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/ed/accreditation/programs/clinical.aspx|title=Accredited Programs in Clinical Psychology|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utilizing discourse analysis, Osburn conducted numerous short-term, one book workshops for translators in Central and South America in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;“Carroll Osburn.” ''ACU Today'' (Spring, 1996): 13, “Bible Translation Among Pre-Literate People,” ''Image'' 7 (1991): 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also developed sensitivity to humanitarian needs in the Developing World. Adding discourse analysis to literary and historical method led to Greek classes formerly of five or six numbering fifty or sixty. He became a popular speaker at seminars and retreats in the U.S. and around the world. In 1980, he was Visiting Professor at the University of St. Andrews, and in 1983, was named “Educator of the Year” by ''20th Century Christian''.&lt;ref&gt;“Osburn Honored as Educator of the Year,” ''20th Century Christian'' 45.11 (August 1983): 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Osburn became Distinguished Professor of New Testament at Pepperdine University 1983-1987.&lt;ref&gt;“Osburn Assumes Post.” ''The Christian Chronicle'' 40.7 (July 1983): 12, and ''Who’s Who in the World'', 1984-85.&lt;/ref&gt;   Urged by Kurt Aland, Matthew Black, and Bruce Metzger, he concentrated attention on ancient manuscripts underlying the Greek New Testament, and chaired the New Testament Textual Criticism Section of the Society of Biblical Literature 1984-90.

In 1987, Osburn was invited to Abilene Christian University, where he was Carmichel-Walling Distinguished Professor of New Testament Language and Literature until 2004.&lt;ref&gt;“First $1 Million Endowed Chair Established.” ''ACU Today'' 41.4 (Winter, 1990): 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was named “Honors Professor of the Year” in 1992 and 1996, and was Chair of the Faculty Senate in 1999-2000. He was on the Steering Committee of the International Greek New Testament Project on John (Birmingham, England) and co-editor of ''Acts of the Apostles'' in ''Novum Testamentum Graecum Editio Critica Maior'' (Institüt für neutestamentliche Textforschung; Münster, Germany) until 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Tera Harmon, “Carroll D. Osburn,” in ''Transmission and Reception: New Testament Text-Critical and Exegetical Studies''. Texts and Studies, Third Series, Vol. 4. Ed. J. Childers and D. Parker. Piscataway, NJ: Gorgias Press, 2006: 286. Osburn also served as Beirat for the Hermann Kunst-Stiftung at Münster, 2003-2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He was Visiting Professor at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens in 1989, at Universität Münster in 2003, and at Claremont School of Theology in 2008. He did archaeological work with Hebrew University of Jerusalem at the Philistine city of Ekron [Tel Miqne] in 1993. In 2004, he published ''The Text of the Apostolos in Epiphanius of Salamis''.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll Osburn, ''The Text of the Apostolos in Epiphanius of Salamis''. NTGF 6. Leiden, The Netherlands: E. J. Brill, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Osburn was invited frequently to lecture at universities in Europe, Canada, Africa, and South America. He was a member of Association Internationale d’Études Patristiques and continues membership in ''Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas''.&lt;ref&gt;''Firm Foundation'' 100:28 (12 July 1983): 21 [489].&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to challenging fundamentalists to rethink polemical interpretation of biblical texts,&lt;ref&gt;E.g., “Interpreting Greek Syntax.” In ''Biblical Interpretation: Principles and Practices. Studies in Honor of Jack Pearl Lewis''. Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 1986: 234-243; and “Continuing in Sin–Matthew 19:9,” ACU Lectures. Ed. Carl Brecheen. Abilene, TX: ACU Bookstore, 1982: 131-148.&lt;/ref&gt;  Osburn also worked to expand boundaries of exclusiveness. He was a pioneer within his religious heritage, tackling difficult issues such as dogmatic sectarianism and gender inequality. In 1993, he published ''The Peaceable Kingdom: Essays Favoring Non-Sectarian Christianity'',&lt;ref&gt;E.g., ''The Peaceable Kingdom: Essays Favoring Non-Sectarian Christianity''. Abilene, TX: Restoration Perspectives, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2001, ''Women in the Church: Reclaiming the Ideal''.&lt;ref&gt;''Women in the Church: Reclaiming the Ideal''. Abilene, TX: ACU Press, 2001. See “Prominent Christian Egalitarians,” in en.Wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_egalitarianism. ''Essays on Women in Earliest Christianity''. Ed. Carroll Osburn. 2 Vols. Joplin, MO: College Press, 1993, 1995, is now published by Wipf and Stock.&lt;/ref&gt; He initiated and hosted the annual Carmichael-Walling Lectures at ACU, which brought renowned scholars from around the world to the campus for stimulating lectures and discussion beyond traditional thinking. His challenges to rethink crucial issues met forceful opposition, but with passing of time, were accepted by increasing numbers of moderates. A ''festschrift'' presented to him on his sixty-fifth birthday consists of essays by noted scholars from around the world, some his former students.&lt;ref&gt;Childers and Parker, ''Transmission and Reception'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24261">'''Chemometrics''' is the science of extracting information from chemical systems by data-driven means.  Chemometrics is inherently interdisciplinary, using methods frequently employed in core data-analytic disciplines such as [[multivariate statistics]], [[applied mathematics]], and [[computer science]], in order to address problems in [[chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], [[medicine]], [[biology]] and [[chemical engineering]].  In this way, it mirrors other interdisciplinary fields, such as [[psychometrics]] and [[econometrics]].

==Introduction==
Chemometrics is applied to solve both descriptive and predictive problems in experimental natural sciences, especially in chemistry.   In descriptive applications, properties of chemical systems are modeled with the intent of learning the underlying relationships and structure of the system (i.e., model understanding and identification).  In predictive applications, properties of chemical systems are modeled with the intent of predicting new properties or behavior of interest.  In both cases, the datasets can be small but are often very large and highly complex, involving hundreds to thousands of variables, and hundreds to thousands of cases or observations.

Chemometric techniques are particularly heavily used in [[analytical chemistry]] and [[metabolomics]], and the development of improved chemometric methods of analysis also continues to advance the state of the art in analytical instrumentation and methodology.  It is an application-driven discipline, and thus while the standard chemometric methodologies are very widely used industrially, academic groups are dedicated to the continued development of chemometric theory, method and application development.

==Origins==
Although one could argue that even the earliest analytical experiments in chemistry involved a form of chemometrics, the field is generally recognized to have emerged in the 1970s as computers became increasingly exploited for scientific investigation.  The term ‘chemometrics’ was coined by Svante Wold in a grant application 1971,&lt;ref name="Wold1974"&gt;As recounted in {{cite journal |first=S. |last=Wold |title=Chemometrics; what do we mean with it, and what do we want from it? |journal=Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems |volume=30 |issue=1 |year=1995 |pages=109–115 |doi=10.1016/0169-7439(95)00042-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the International Chemometrics Society was formed shortly thereafter by Svante Wold and Bruce Kowalski, two pioneers in the field.  Wold was a professor of organic chemistry at [[Umeå University]], Sweden, and Kowalski was a professor of analytical chemistry at University of Washington, Seattle.

Many early applications involved multivariate classification, numerous quantitative predictive applications followed, and by the late 1970s and early 1980s a wide variety of data- and computer-driven chemical analyses were occurring.

Multivariate analysis was a critical facet even in the earliest applications of chemometrics.  The data resulting from infrared and UV/visible spectroscopy are often easily numbering in the thousands of measurements per sample.  Mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, atomic emission/absorption and chromatography experiments are also all by nature highly multivariate.  The structure of these data was found to be conducive to using techniques such as [[principal components analysis]] (PCA), and [[partial least squares regression|partial least-squares]] (PLS).  This is primarily because, while the datasets may be highly multivariate there is strong and often linear low-rank structure present.  PCA and PLS have been shown over time very effective at empirically modeling the more chemically interesting low-rank structure, exploiting the interrelationships or ‘latent variables’ in the data, and providing alternative compact coordinate systems for further numerical analysis such as [[regression analysis|regression]], [[cluster analysis|clustering]], and [[pattern recognition]].  Partial least squares in particular was heavily used in chemometric applications for many years before it began to find regular use in other fields.

Through the 1980s three dedicated journals appeared in the field: ''[[Journal of Chemometrics]]'', ''[[Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems]]'', and ''[[Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling]]''. These journals continue to cover both fundamental and methodological research in chemometrics.  At present, most routine applications of existing chemometric methods are commonly published in application-oriented journals (e.g., ''Applied Spectroscopy, ''[[Analytical Chemistry (journal)|Analytical Chemistry]]'', ''Anal. Chim. Acta.'', ''Talanta''). Several important books/monographs on chemometrics were also first published in the 1980s, including the first edition of Malinowski’s ''Factor Analysis in Chemistry'',&lt;ref name="Malinowski1980"&gt;{{cite book |first=E. R. |last=Malinowski |first2=D.

Some large chemometric application areas have gone on to represent new domains, such as molecular modeling and [[Quantitative structure–activity relationship|QSAR]], [[cheminformatics]], the ‘-omics’ fields of [[genomics]], [[proteomics]], [[metabonomics]] and [[metabolomics]], process modeling and [[process analytical technology]].

An account of the early history of chemometrics was published as a series of interviews by Geladi and Esbensen.&lt;ref name="Geladi2005"&gt;{{cite journal |first=P. |last=Geladi |first2=K. |last2=Esbensen |title=The Start and Early History of Chemometrics: Selected Interviews.

==Techniques==

===Multivariate calibration===
Many chemical problems and applications of chemometrics involve [[calibration]].  The objective is to develop models which can be used to predict properties of interest based on measured properties of the chemical system, such as pressure, flow, temperature, [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared]], [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman]], [[NMR|NMR spectra]] and [[mass spectrometry|mass spectra]].  Examples include the development of multivariate models relating 1) multi-wavelength spectral response to analyte concentration, 2) molecular descriptors to biological activity, 3) multivariate process conditions/states to final product attributes.  The process requires a calibration or training data set, which includes reference values for the properties of interest for prediction, and the measured attributes believed to correspond to these properties.  For case 1), for example, one can assemble data from a number of samples, including concentrations for an analyte of interest for each sample (the reference) and the corresponding infrared spectrum of that sample.  Multivariate calibration techniques such as partial-least squares regression, or principal component regression (and near countless other methods) are then used to construct a mathematical model that relates the multivariate response (spectrum) to the concentration of the analyte of interest, and such a model can be used to efficiently predict the concentrations of new samples.

Techniques in multivariate calibration are often broadly categorized as classical or inverse methods.&lt;ref name="Martens1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Franke2002"&gt;{{cite book |first=J. |last=Franke |chapter=Inverse Least Squares and Classical Least Squares Methods for Quantitative Vibrational Spectroscopy |title=Handbook of Vibrational Spectroscopy |publisher=Wiley |year=2002 |location=New York |pages= |isbn=0471988472 |doi=10.1002/0470027320.s4603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The principal difference between these approaches is that in classical calibration the models are solved such that they are optimal in describing the measured analytical responses (e.g., spectra) and can therefore be considered optimal descriptors, whereas in inverse methods the models are solved to be optimal in predicting the properties of interest (e.g., concentrations, optimal predictors).&lt;ref name="Brown2004"&gt;{{cite journal |first=C. D. |last=Brown |title=Discordance between Net Analyte Signal Theory and Practical Multivariate Calibration |journal=Analytical Chemistry |volume=76 |year=2004 |issue=15 |pages=4364–4373 |doi=10.1021/ac049953w |pmid=15283574}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inverse methods usually require less physical knowledge of the chemical system, and at least in theory provide superior predictions in the mean-squared error sense,&lt;ref name="krutchkoff1969"&gt;{{cite journal |first=R. G. |last=Krutchkoff |title=Classical and inverse regression methods of calibration in extrapolation |journal=Technometrics |volume=11 |issue=3 |year=1969 |pages=11–15 |doi=10.1080/00401706.1969.10490714 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kowalski1984"&gt;{{cite book |first=W. G. |last=Hunter |chapter=Statistics and chemistry, and the linear calibration problem |title=Chemometrics: mathematics and statistics in chemistry |editor-first=B. R. |editor-last=Kowalski |publisher=Riedel |location=Boston |year=1984 |pages= |isbn=9027718466 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tellinghuisen2000"&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Tellinghuisen |title=Inverse vs. classical calibration for small data sets |journal=Fresenius' J. Anal. Chem. |volume=368 |year=2000 |issue=6 |pages=585–588 |doi=10.1007/s002160000556 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence inverse approaches tend to be more frequently applied in contemporary multivariate calibration.

The main advantages of the use of multivariate calibration techniques is that fast, cheap, or non-destructive analytical measurements (such as optical spectroscopy) can be used to estimate sample properties which would otherwise require time-consuming, expensive or destructive testing (such as [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]]).  Equally important is that multivariate calibration allows for accurate quantitative analysis in the presence of heavy interference by other analytes.  The selectivity of the analytical method is provided as much by the mathematical calibration, as the analytical measurement modalities.  For example, near-infrared spectra, which are extremely broad and non-selective compared to other analytical techniques (such as infrared or Raman spectra), can often be used successfully in conjunction with carefully developed multivariate calibration methods to predict concentrations of analytes in very complex matrices.

===Classification, pattern recognition, clustering===
Supervised multivariate classification techniques are closely related to multivariate calibration techniques in that a calibration or training set is used to develop a mathematical model capable of classifying future samples.  The techniques employed in chemometrics are similar to those used in other fields – multivariate discriminant analysis, logistic regression, neural networks, regression/classification trees.  The use of rank reduction techniques in conjunction with these conventional classification methods is routine in chemometrics, for example discriminant analysis on [[principal component analysis|principal components]] or [[partial least squares regression|partial least squares]] scores.

Unsupervised classification (also termed [[cluster analysis]]) is also commonly used to discover patterns in complex data sets, and again many of the core techniques used in chemometrics are common to other fields such as machine learning and statistical learning.

===Multivariate curve resolution===
In chemometric parlance, multivariate curve resolution seeks to deconstruct data sets with limited or absent reference information and system knowledge.  Some of the earliest work on these techniques was done by Lawton and Sylvestre in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lawton |first=W. H. |last2=Sylvestre |first2=E. A. |year=1971 |title=Self Modeling Curve Resolution |journal=Technometrics |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=617–633 |doi=10.1080/00401706.1971.10488823 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sylvestre |first=E. A. |last2=Lawton |first2=W. H. |last3=Maggio |first3=M. S. |year=1974 |title=Curve Resolution Using a Postulated Chemical Reaction |journal=Technometrics |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=353–368 |doi=10.1080/00401706.1974.10489204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These approaches are also called self-modeling mixture analysis, [[blind signal separation|blind source/signal separation]], and spectral unmixing.  For example, from a data set comprising fluorescence spectra from a series of samples each containing multiple fluorophores, multivariate curve resolution methods can be used to extract the fluorescence spectra of the individual fluorophores, along with their relative concentrations in each of the samples, essentially unmixing the total fluorescence spectrum into the contributions from the individual components. The problem is usually ill-determined due to rotational ambiguity (many possible solutions can equivalently represent the measured data), so the application of additional constraints is common, such as non-negatively, unmodality, or known interrelationships between the individual components (e.g., kinetic or mass-balance constraints).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Juan |first=A. |last2=Tauler |first2=R. |year=2003 |title=Chemometrics Applied to Unravel Multicomponent Processes and Mixtures. Revisiting Latest Trends in Multivariate Resolution |journal=Analytica Chimica Acta |volume=500 |issue=1–2 |pages=195–210 |doi=10.1016/S0003-2670(03)00724-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Juan |first=A. |last2=Tauler |first2=R. |year=2006 |title=Multivariate Curve Resolution (MCR) from 2000: Progress in Concepts and Applications |journal=Critical Reviews in Analytical Chemistry |volume=36 |issue=3–4 |pages=163–176 |doi=10.1080/10408340600970005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other techniques===
'''[[design of experiments|Experimental design]]''' remains a core area of study in chemometrics and several monographs are specifically devoted to experimental design in chemical applications.&lt;ref name="Deming1987"&gt;{{cite book |first=S. N. |last=Deming |first2=S. L. |last2=Morgan |title=Experimental design: a chemometric approach |publisher=Elsevier |year=1987 |isbn=0444427341 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruns2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=R. E. |last=Bruns |first2=I. S. |last2=Scarminio |first3=B. |last3=de Barros Neto |title=Statistical design – chemometrics |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |year=2006 |isbn=044452181X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sound principles of experimental design have been widely adopted within the chemometrics community, although many complex experiments are purely observational, and there can be little control over the properties and interrelationships of the samples and sample properties.

'''[[Signal processing]]''' is also a critical component of almost all chemometric applications, particularly the use of signal pretreatments to condition data prior to calibration or classification.  The techniques employed commonly in chemometrics are often closely related to those used in related fields.&lt;ref name="Wentzell2000"&gt;{{cite book |first=P. D. |last=Wentzell |first2=C. D. |last2=Brown |chapter=Signal Processing in Analytical Chemistry |title=Encyclopedia of Analytical Chemistry |editor-first=R. A. |editor-last=Meyers |publisher=Wiley |year=2000 |pages=9764–9800 |isbn= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Performance characterization, and figures of merit'''  Like most arenas in the physical sciences, chemometrics is quantitatively oriented, so considerable emphasis is placed on performance characterization, model selection, verification &amp; validation, and [[figure of merit|figures of merit]].  The performance of quantitative models is usually specified by [[root mean squared error]] in predicting the attribute of interest, and the performance of classifiers as a true-positive rate/false-positive rate pairs (or a full ROC curve).  A recent report by Olivieri et al. provides a comprehensive overview of figures of merit and uncertainty estimation in multivariate calibration, including multivariate definitions of selectivity, sensitivity, SNR and prediction interval estimation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. C. |last=Olivieri |first2=N. M. |last2=Faber |first3=J. |last3=Ferre |first4=R. |last4=Boque |first5=J. H. |last5=Kalivas |first6=H. |last6=Mark |title=Guidelines for calibration in analytical chemistry Part 3. Uncertainty estimation and figures of merit for multivariate calibration |journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry |volume=78 |year=2006 |issue=3 |pages=633–650 |doi=10.1351/pac200678030633 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chemometric model selection usually involves the use of tools such as [[resampling (statistics)|resampling]] (including bootstrap, permutation, cross-validation).

'''Multivariate [[statistical process control]] (MSPC)''', modeling and optimization accounts for a substantial amount of historical chemometric development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=D. L. |last=Illman |first2=J. B. |last2=Callis |first3=B. R. |last3=Kowalski |title=Process Analytical Chemistry: a new paradigm for analytical chemists |journal=American Laboratory |volume=18 |year=1986 |pages=8–10 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. F. |last=MacGregor |first2=T. |last2=Kourti |title=Statistical control of multivariate processes |journal=Control Engineering Practice |volume=3 |year=1995 |issue=3 |pages=403–414 |doi=10.1016/0967-0661(95)00014-L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=E. B. |last=Martin |first2=A. J. |last2=Morris |title=An overview of multivariate statistical process control in continuous and batch process performance monitoring |journal=Transactions of the institute of Measurement &amp; Control |volume=18 |year=1996 |issue=1 |pages=51–60 |doi=10.1177/014233129601800107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spectroscopy has been used successfully for online monitoring of manufacturing processes for 30–40 years, and this process data is highly amenable to chemometric modeling.  Specifically in terms of MSPC, multiway modeling of batch and continuous processes is increasingly common in industry and remains an active area of research in chemometrics and chemical engineering.  Process analytical chemistry as it was originally termed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=T. |last=Hirschfeld |first2=J. B. |last2=Callis |first3=B. R. |last3=Kowalski |title=Chemical sensing in process analysis |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=226 |year=1984 |issue=4672 |pages=312–318 |doi=10.1126/science.226.4672.312 |bibcode=1984Sci...226..312H }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the newer term [[process analytical technology]] continues to draw heavily on chemometric methods and MSPC.

'''Multiway methods''' are heavily used in chemometric applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. K. |last=Smilde |first2=R. |last2=Bro |first3=P. |last3=Geladi |title=Multi-way analysis with applications in the chemical sciences |publisher=Wiley |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=R. |last=Bro |first2=J. J. |last2=Workman |first3=P. R. |last3=Mobley |first4=B. R. |last4=Kowalski |title=Overview of chemometrics applied to spectroscopy: 1985–95, Part 3—Multiway analysis |journal=Applied Spectroscopy Reviews |volume=32 |year=1997 |issue=3 |pages=237–261 |doi=10.1080/05704929708003315 |bibcode=1997ApSRv..32..237B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are higher-order extensions of more widely used methods.  For example, while the analysis of a table (matrix, or second-order array) of data is routine in several fields, multiway methods are applied to data sets that involve 3rd, 4th, or higher-orders.  Data of this type is very common in chemistry, for example a liquid-chromatography / mass spectrometry (LC-MS) system generates a large matrix of data (elution time versus m/z) for each sample analyzed.  The data across multiple samples thus comprises a data cube.  Batch process modeling involves data sets that have time vs. process variables vs. batch number.  The multiway mathematical methods applied to these sorts of problems include [[PARAFAC]], trilinear decomposition, and multiway PLS and PCA.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3112">The '''electric circuit extraction'''  or simply '''circuit extraction''', also '''netlist extraction''', is the translation of an [[integrated circuit layout]] back into the [[electrical circuit]] ([[netlist]]) it is intended
to represent. This extracted circuit is needed for various purposes including [[SPICE|circuit simulation]], [[static timing analysis]], [[signal integrity]], [[power optimization (EDA)| power analysis and optimization]], and [[Formal equivalence checking|logic to layout comparison]]. Each of these functions require a slightly different representation of the circuit, resulting in the need for multiple layout extractions. In addition, there may be a postprocessing step of converting the device-level circuit into a purely [[digital circuit]], but this is not considered part of the extraction process.

The detailed functionality of an extraction process will depend on its system environment. The simplest form of extracted circuit may be in the form of a netlist, which is formatted for a particular simulator or analysis program. A more complex extraction may involve writing the extracted circuit back into the original database containing the physical layout and the logic diagram. In this case, by associating the extracted circuit with the layout and the logic network, the user can cross-reference any point in the circuit to its equivalent points in the logic and layout (cross-probing). For simulation or analysis, various formats of netlist can then be generated using programs that read the database and generate the appropriate text information.

In extraction, it is often helpful to make an (informal) distinction between ''designed devices'', which are devices that are deliberately created by the designer, and ''parasitic devices'', which were not explicitly intended by the designer but are inherent in the layout of the circuit.

Primarily there are three different parts to the extraction process. These are designed device extraction, interconnect extraction, and parasitic device extraction. These parts are inter-related since various device extractions can change the connectivity of the circuit, e.g., resistors (whether designed or parasitic) convert single nets into multiple electrical nodes. Usually one level of interconnect extraction is used with designed device extraction to provide a circuit for simulation or gate-level reduction, and a second level of interconnect extraction is used with parasitic device extraction to provide a circuit for timing analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16032">'''Classwide Peer Tutoring''' ('''CWPT''') is a variation of [[peer-mediated instruction]] that has been used in elementary, middle school, and high school classrooms. In CWPT students form pairs and take turns in the roles of tutor and student. Students earn points for their teams by participating in the tutoring and the winning team is recognized. Researchers have investigated CWPT's effectiveness in several different academic areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/?q=instruction/classwide_peer_tutoring&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Classwide Peer Tutoring (CWPT) is a form of [[peer-mediated instruction]] where the teacher creates pairs of students that alternately fill the roles of tutor and student. The tutor asks questions, records points, and provides feedback on whether the student's response matches the correct response designated by the teacher. The student responds orally and/or in writing to the questions and practices the correct answer three times if he or she makes an error.&lt;ref name=Terry&gt;{{cite web|last=Terry|first=Barbara|title=Classwide Peer Tutoring|url=http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/~kucrl/cgi-bin/drupal/?q=instruction/classwide_peer_tutoring|work=University of Kansas Special Connections|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher supervises the tutoring and awards points for good tutoring.&lt;ref name=Terry /&gt; A classroom's student pairs are divided into two teams, and they earn points for their respective teams by answering questions correctly, correcting their incorrect answers, and tutoring appropriately.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenwood|first=Charles|title=Classwide Peer Tutoring|journal=Behavior and Social Issues|year=1997|volume=7|issue=1|page=52-57|doi=10.5210/bsi.v7i1.299}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of a week, the team that has earned the most points is recognized as the winning team.&lt;ref name="Best Evidence Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Program Overview: Classwide Peer Tutoring|url=http://www.bestevidence.org/overviews/C/classwide.htm|work=Best Evidence Encyclopedia|publisher=Johns Hopkins University School of Education|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; CWPT has been used to help students learn [[spelling]], math facts, basic word reading, reading fluency, [[vocabulary]], and facts related to an area of study.&lt;ref name=Terry /&gt; There appear to be more published studies of CWPT with positive outcomes in the area of spelling than in other areas. The CWPT technique has been used with several different age levels: pre-school, elementary, middle school, and high school.&lt;ref name=Terry /&gt; CWPT was initially developed and researched in the early 1980s at the Juniper Gardens Children's Project at the [[University of Kansas]].&lt;ref name="Promising Practices Network"&gt;{{cite web|title=Programs that Work: Classwide Peer Tutoring Program|url=http://www.promisingpractices.net/program.asp?programid=99|publisher=Promising Practices Network|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rationale ==
The developers of CWPT suggest that this technique provides students more opportunities to practice content or skills, encourages them to engage in [[active learning]], and lets them receive immediate feedback.&lt;ref name=Terry /&gt; CWPT is also thought to provide students with practice using [[social skills]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood 1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamps Barbetta Leonard &amp; Delquadri"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kamps|first=Debra|author2=Barbetta, Patricia |author3=Leonard, Betsy |author4= Delquadri, Joseph |title=Classwide Peer Tutoring: An Integration Strategy To Improve Reading Skills And Promote Peer Interactions Among Students With Autism And General Education Peers|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|year=1994|volume=27|page=49-61|doi=10.1901/jaba.1994.27-49|pmc=1297776}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evaluation as an evidence-based practice ===
==== What Works Clearinghouse rating ====
The [[United States Department of Education]]'s [[What Works Clearinghouse]] has evaluated CWPT for effectiveness in the areas of General Reading Achievement and [[English language learning and teaching|English Language Learning]] (ELL). These evaluations resulted in a "potentially positive" effectiveness rating in the area of General Reading Achievement for elementary school students, and no rating for ELL due to the fact that no existing studies met What Works Clearinghouse criteria for evaluation.&lt;ref name="WWC reading"&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Department of Education|title=Classwide Peer Tutoring Beginning Reading|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/interventionreport.aspx?sid=81|work=What Works Clearinghouse Intervention Report|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WWC ELL"&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Department of Education|title=Classwide Peer Tutoring English Language Learners|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/interventionreport.aspx?sid=83|work=What Works Clearinghouse Intervention Report|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; What Works Clearinghouse does not currently provide reports for CWPT's effectiveness in any other areas.

==== Promising Practices Network rating ====
Promising Practices Network considers CWPT a "Proven Program".&lt;ref name="Promising Practices Network" /&gt; The website states that CWPT meets full criteria for a "Proven Program" by having research outcomes that fall in the category of the website's target areas, having at least one outcome that is changed by at least 20% or .25 [[standard deviation]]s, having at least one outcome with a statistically significant and meaningful [[effect size]], having studies that use comparison groups, having studies with sample sizes of 30 or more, and by having research findings publicly available.&lt;ref name="Promising Practices Network" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
A few studies have shown CWPT to have few advantages over more traditional methods of classroom instruction with middle or high school students, such as teacher-centered instruction or independent practice.&lt;ref name="Allsopp 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allsopp|first=David|title=Using classwide peer tutoring to teach beginning algebra problem-solving skills in heterogeneous classrooms.|journal=Remedial and Special Education|year=1997|volume=18|issue=6|page=367-379|doi=10.1177/074193259701800606}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowman-Perrott 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowman-Perrott|first=Lisa|author2=Greenwood, Charles R |author3=Tapia, Yolanda |title=The efficacy of CWPT used in secondary alternative school classrooms with small teacher/pupil ratios and students with emotional and behavioral disorders.|journal=Education &amp; Treatment of Children|year=2007|volume=30|issue=3|page=65-87|doi=10.1353/etc.2007.0014}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have also found that while CWPT may increase the positive social interactions of students with ADHD during the tutoring, it does not necessarily affect their social behavior in other settings.&lt;ref name="Plumer 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plumer|first=Pamela|author2=Stoner, Gary|title=The relative effects of classwide peer tutoring and peer coaching on the positive social behaviors of children with ADHD.|journal=Journal of Attention Disorders|year=2005|volume=9|issue=1|page=290-300|doi=10.1177/1087054705280796}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27414">{{Mythology}}
'''Comparative mythology''' is the comparison of [[myth]]s from different cultures in an attempt to identify shared themes and characteristics.&lt;ref name="Littleton 32"&gt;Littleton, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative mythology has served a variety of academic purposes. For example, scholars have used the relationships between different myths to trace the development of [[religion]]s and [[culture]]s, to propose common origins for myths from different cultures, and to support various [[psychology|psychological theories]].

==Comparativists versus particularists==
The [[anthropologist]] [[C. Scott Littleton]] defined comparative mythology as "the systematic comparison of myths and mythic themes drawn from a wide variety of cultures".&lt;ref name="Littleton 32" /&gt; By comparing different cultures' mythologies, scholars try to identify underlying similarities and/or to reconstruct a "protomythology" from which those mythologies developed.&lt;ref name="Littleton 32" /&gt; To an extent, all theories about mythology follow a comparative approach: as the scholar of religion Robert Segal notes, "by definition, all theorists [of myth] seek similarities among myths".&lt;ref&gt;Segal, "The Romantic Appeal of Joseph Campbell"&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholars of mythology can be roughly divided into particularists, who emphasize the differences between myths, and comparativists, who emphasize the similarities. Particularists tend to "maintain that the similarities deciphered by comparativists are vague and superficial", while comparativists tend to "contend that the differences etched by particularists are trivial and incidental".&lt;ref&gt;Segal, ''Theorizing About Myth'', p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative approaches to mythology held great popularity among eighteenth- and nineteenth-century scholars. Many of these scholars believed that all myths showed signs of having evolved from athought which interpreted nearly all myths as poetic descriptions of the sun's behavior. According to this theory, these poetic descriptions had become distorted over time into seemingly diverse stories about gods and heroes.&lt;ref name="Leonard"&gt;Leonard&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern-day scholars lean more toward particularism, feeling suspicious of broad statements about myths.&lt;ref name="Northup 8"&gt;Northup, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; A recent exception is the historical approach followed in E.J. [[Michael Witzel]]'s reconstruction of many subsequent layers of older mythologies &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;E.J.M. Witzel, "The Origins of the World's Mythologies, New York : OUP 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==
Comparative mythologists come from various fields, including [[folklorist|folklore]], [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[linguistics]], and [[religious studies]], and they have used a variety of methods to compare myths. These are some important approaches to comparative mythology.

===Linguistic===
{{See also|Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-Iranian religion}}
Some scholars look at the linguistic relationships between the myths of different cultures. For example, the similarities between the names of gods in different cultures. One particularly successful example of this approach is the study of [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] mythology. Scholars have found striking similarities between the mythological and religious terms used in different cultures of Europe and India. For example, the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] sky-god [[Zeus Pater]], the Roman sky-god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], and the Indian (Vedic) sky-god [[Dyaus Pita|Dyauṣ Pitṛ]] have linguistically identical names.

This suggests that the Greeks, Romans, and Indians originated from a common ancestral culture, and that the names [[Zeus]], [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Dyaus]] and the Germanic [[Týr|Tiu]] (cf. English Tues-day) evolved from an older name, [[Dyēus|*Dyēus ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ter]], which referred to the sky-god or, to give a perfect English cognate, the ''day-father'' in a [[Proto-Indo-European religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Watkins 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural===
{{See also|Lévi-Strauss#The structuralist approach to myth|Structuralist theory of mythology|Structural anthropology|Vladimir Propp}}
Some scholars look for underlying structures shared by different myths. The folklorist [[Vladimir Propp]] proposed that many [[Russian language|Russian]] [[fairy tales]] have a common plot structure, in which certain events happen in a predictable order.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] examined the structure of a myth in terms of the abstract relationships between its elements, rather than their order in the plot. In particular, Lévi-Strauss believed that the elements of a myth could be organized into binary oppositions (raw vs. cooked, nature vs. culture, etc.). He thought that the myth's purpose was to "mediate" these oppositions, thereby resolving basic tensions or contradictions found in human life or culture.&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological===
{{See also|Oedipus complex|Analytical psychology|Jungian archetypes}}
Some scholars propose that myths from different cultures reveal the same, or similar, psychological forces at work in those cultures. Some [[Freudian]] thinkers have identified stories similar to the Greek story of [[Oedipus]] in many different cultures. They argue that these stories reflect the different expressions of the [[Oedipus complex]] in those cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson and Price-Williams, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Jungian]]s have identified images, themes, and patterns that appear in the myths of many different cultures. They believe that these similarities result from [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]] present in the [[unconscious mind|unconscious levels]] of every person's mind.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical and comparative===
A new approach, which is both historical and comparative, has recently been proposed by E.J. [[Michael Witzel]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He compares collections of mythologies of various cultures, from Iceland and Egypt to the Mayas, and reconstructs increasingly older levels, parallel to but not necessarily dependent on language families (see above). The most prominent common feature is a story line that extends from the creation of the world and of humans to their end. This feature is found in the northern mythologies of Eurasia and the Americas ("[[Laurasia]]") while it is missing in the southern mythologies of Subsaharan Africa, New Guinea and Australia ("[[Gondwana]]land"). The latter is the older one, going back to the dispersal of [[Homo sapiens]] out of Africa, some 65,000 years ago. Based on these two reconstructions he offers some suggestions about the tales of the (genetic) "[[African Eve]]". Close attention is paid to the largely parallel developments in archaeology, paleontology, genetics and linguistics. He also makes some suggestions about the persistence of these Stone Age myths in current religions.

===Phylogenetical===
It is speculated that like [[genes]], myths evolve by a process of descent with modification. The striking parallels between biological and mythological [[evolution]]&lt;ref&gt;d'Huy 2012a, 2013a, b&lt;/ref&gt; allow the use of [[computational statistics]] to infer evolutionary relatedness and to build the most likely [[phylogenetic tree]] for a mythological family. Mythological phylogenies constructed with [[mytheme]]s clearly support low horizontal transmissions (borrowings), historical (sometimes pre-historic) diffusions and [[punctuated evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;d'Huy 2012b, c; d'Huy 2013a, b, c, d&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the protoversion could be statistically reconstructed. Mythological phylogenies also are a potentially powerful way to test hypotheses about cross-cultural relationships among [[folklore|folktales]]&lt;ref&gt;Ross and al. 2013; Tehrani 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some mythological parallels==
[[File:Gustave Doré - The Holy Bible - Plate I, The Deluge.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''The Deluge'', frontispiece to [[Gustave Doré]]'s illustrated edition of the Bible. Based on the story of [[Noah's Ark]], this engraving shows humans and a tiger doomed by the flood futilely attempting to save their children and cubs.]]
Comparative mythology has uncovered a number of parallels between the myths of different cultures, including some very widespread recurring themes and plot elements.&lt;ref&gt;van der Sluijs (2011) provides a detailed listing of parallels, see van der Sluijs, Marinus Anthony: ''Traditional Cosmologies. The Global Mythology of Cosmic Creation and Destruction''. 2011. London: All Round Publications ([http://www.mythopedia.info/traditionalcosmology-contents.pdf table of contents])&lt;/ref&gt; Here are some examples.

===Flood myth===
{{Main|Flood myth}}
Cultures around the world tell stories about a great flood.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, untitled, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, the flood leaves only one survivor or group of survivors. For example, both the Babylonian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' and the [[Hebrew Bible]] tell of a global flood that wiped out humanity and of a man who saved the Earth's species by taking them aboard a boat.&lt;ref&gt;Woolley, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Similar stories of a single flood survivor appear in [[Hindu mythology]]&lt;ref&gt;Dimmitt and van Buitenen, pp. 71–74&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Ancient Greek flood myths|Greek]], [[Norse mythology]] and [[Aztec mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Urton, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

===The creative sacrifice===
Many cultures have stories about divine figures whose death creates an essential part of reality.&lt;ref name="Eliade Cosmos 20"&gt;Eliade, ''Cosmos and History'', p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; These myths seem especially common among cultures that grow crops, particularly [[tubers]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; One such myth from the [[Wemale people]] of [[Seram]] Island, [[Indonesia]], tells of a miraculously-conceived girl named [[Hainuwele]], whose murdered corpse sprouts into the people's staple food crops.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', pp. 104–5&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chinese mythology|Chinese myth]] of [[Pangu]],&lt;ref&gt;Railsback, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; the [[India]]n [[Vedic mythology|Vedic myth]] of [[Purusha]],&lt;ref&gt;''Rig Veda'' 10:90&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Norse mythology|Norse myth]] of [[Ymir]] all tell of a cosmic giant who is killed to create the world.&lt;ref name="Eliade Cosmos 20" /&gt;

===The dying god===
[[File:Dumuzi aux enfers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Ancient Sumerian [[cylinder seal]] impression showing the god [[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzid]] being tortured in the [[Kur|Underworld]] by ''[[gallu|galla]]'' demons]]
{{Main|Life-death-rebirth deity}}
{{See also|Descent to the underworld|Jesus Christ and comparative mythology}}
Many myths feature a god who dies and often returns to life.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, ''passim''; Tortchinov, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Such myths are particularly common in [[Near East]]ern mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Masks of God'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropologist [[Sir James Frazer]] compared these "dying god" myths in his multi-volume work ''[[The Golden Bough]]''. The [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] god [[Osiris]] and the [[Mesopotamian]] god [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]] are examples of the "dying god", while the Greek myths of [[Adonis]] (though a mortal) has often been compared to Osiris and the myth of [[Dionysos]] also features death and rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have noted similarities between polytheistic stories of "dying gods" and the [[Christian]] story of [[Jesus of Nazareth]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

===The structure of hero stories===

A number of scholars have suggested that [[hero]] stories from various cultures have the same underlying structure. Other scholars, including [[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan]] and, more recently, [[Joseph Campbell]], have also suggested that hero stories share a common structure.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 118–19&lt;/ref&gt; Some comparative mythologists look for similarities only among hero stories within a specific geographical or ethnic range. For example, the [[Austrians|Austrian]] scholar [[Johann Georg van Hahn]] tried to identify a common structure underlying "[[Aryan]]" hero stories.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, ''Hero Myths'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Campbell, propose theories about hero stories in general. According to Campbell's "[[monomyth]]" hypothesis, hero stories from around the world share a common plot structure.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'', ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its extremely comparative nature, the monomyth hypothesis is currently out of favor with some religious scholars such as Lesley Northup.&lt;ref name="Northup 8" /&gt;

===''Axis mundi''===
{{Main|Axis mundi}}
{{See also|Yggdrasil|Omphalos|Mount Meru}}
Many mythologies mention a place that sits at the center of the world and acts as a point of contact between different levels of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; This "''[[axis mundi]]''" is often marked by a sacred tree or other mythical object. For example, many myths describe a great tree or pillar joining heaven, earth, and the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p. 259–260&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vedic]] [[India]], ancient [[China]], [[Mayans]], [[Incas]] and the [[Germanic peoples]] all had myths featuring a "Cosmic Tree" whose branches reach heaven and whose roots reach hell.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Titanomachy===
[[File:Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem - The Fall of the Titans - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''[[The Fall of the Titans]]'' (1596-98) by [[Cornelis Cornelisz van Haarlem]]]]
{{See also|Titanomachy|Theomachy|Theogony}}
Many cultures have a [[creation myth]] in which a group of younger, more civilized gods conquers and/or struggles against a group of older gods who represent the forces of chaos.

In [[Hindu mythology]], the younger ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s'' (gods) battle the older ''[[asura]]s'' (demons),&lt;ref name="Squire 47" /&gt; though both are born from the same father, [[Kashyap]], the grandson of Brahma.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.manuscrypts.com/myth/2011/06/21/kashyapa-1/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Greek myth of the [[Titanomachy]], the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]] defeat the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], an older and more primitive divine race, and establish cosmic order.&lt;ref name="Squire 47"&gt;Squire, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, especially pp. 64–87&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic gods]] of life and light struggle against the [[Fomorians]], ancient gods of death and darkness.&lt;ref name="Squire 47" /&gt;

This myth of the gods conquering demons - and order conquering chaos - is especially common in [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] mythologies. Some scholars suggest that the myth reflects the ancient Indo-Europeans' conquest of native peoples during their expansion over Europe and India.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Masks of God'', pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Squire, pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''deus otiosus''===
{{See also|Deus otiosus|Sky father|Urmonotheismus}}
Many cultures believe in a celestial [[Supreme Being|supreme being]] who has cut off contact with humanity. Historian [[Mircea Eliade]] calls this supreme being a ''[[deus otiosus]]'' (an "idle god"),&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; although this term is also used more broadly, to refer to any god who doesn't interact regularly with humans. In many myths, the Supreme Being withdraws into the heavens after the creation of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 93–98&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baluba mythology]] features such a story, in which the supreme god withdraws from the earth, leaving man to search for him.&lt;ref&gt;Leslau, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the mythology of the [[Hereros]] tells of a sky god who has abandoned mankind to lesser divinities.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; In the mythologies of highly complex cultures, the supreme being tends to disappear completely, replaced by a strongly [[polytheistic]] belief system.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, Myths, Dreams and Mysteries, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding myths===
[[File:Maria Saal Dom Grabrelief Romulus und Remus 27122013 774.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Ancient Roman relief from the [[Maria Saal#Cathedral|Cathedral of Maria Saal]] showing the infant twins [[Romulus and Remus]] being suckled by a she-wolf]]
{{Main|Founding myth}}
{{See also|National myth}}
Many cultures have myths describing the origin of their customs, rituals, and identity. In fact, ancient and traditional societies have often justified their customs by claiming that their gods or mythical heroes established those customs.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Cosmos and History'', pp. 21–34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', pp. 6–8&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to the myths of the [[Australia|Australian]] [[Karadjeri]], the mythical [[Bagadjimbiri]] brothers established all of the Karadjeri's customs, including the position in which they stand while urinating.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15219">The '''[[contralateral]] organization of the [[forebrain]]''' ([[Latin]]: contra ‚against‘; latus ‚side‘, lateral ‚sided‘) is the property that the [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]]s of the [[cerebrum]] and the [[thalamus]] represent mainly the contralateral side of the body. Consequently, the left side of the forebrain mostly represents the right side of the body and the right side of the brain represents mostly the left side of the body. The contralateral organization involves both, executive and sensory functions (e.g., a left-sided [[brain lesion]] may cause a right-sided [[hemiplegia]]). The contralateral organization is present in all [[vertebrates]] but in no [[invertebrate]]. According to current theories, the forebrain is twisted about the long axis of the body, so that not only the left and right sides, but also dorsal and ventral sides are interchanged (see below).

== Anatomy ==

[[File:Gray690.png|thumb|left|160px|Some afferent decussations.]]
[[File:Gray680.png|thumb|160px|Pyramidal decussations.]]
[[Anatomically]], the contralateral organization is manifested by major '''[[decussation]]s''' (latin: the [[Latin]] notation for [[10|ten]], 'deca', is an [[uppercase]] 'X') and [[Optic chiasma|chiasma]]s (after the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[uppercase]] letter 'Χ', [[Chi (letter)|chi]]). A decussation denotes a crossing of bundles of [[axonal]] fibres inside the [[central nervous system]]. As a result of such decussations, the [[Efferent nerve fiber|efferent connections]] of the cerebrum to the [[basal ganglia]], the [[cerebellum]] and the [[spinal chord|spine]] are crossed, and the [[afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] connections from the spine, the cerebellum and the [[pons]] to the thalamus are crossed.&lt;ref name="Nieuwenhuys1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nieuwenhuys|first1=R.|last2=Donkelaar|first2=H.J.|last3=Nicholson|first3=C.|last4=Smeets|first4=W.J.A.J.|last5=Wicht|first5=H.|title=The central nervous system of vertebrates.|date=1998|publisher=Springer|location=New York|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540560135}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, motor, [[somatosensory]], [[auditory system|auditory]], and visual primary regions in the forebrain represent predominantly the contralateral side of the body.

Two of the [[cranial nerves]] show chiasmas: the [[optic tract]] (nerve II) which originates from the eyes and inserts on the [[optic tectum]] of the [[midbrain]], and the [[trochlear nerve]] (nerve IV) which originates in the ventral midbrain and innervates one of the six muscles that rotate the eye ([[superior oblique muscle]]).

=== The contralateral organization is incomplete ===

Although the forebrain of all vertebrates shows a contralateral organization, this contralaterality is by no means complete. Some of these exceptions are worth to mention:
* [[Olfaction]] (smelling sense): Each [[Olfactory bulb|olfactory lobe]] connects to the ipsilateral centers of the frontal cerebrum.
* In [[chondrichthyans]] ([[sharks]] and [[skate (fish)|skate]]s) the thalamus does not retrieve a branch from the optic tract but only from the contralateral [[optic tectum]], so that the optic path [[decussates]] twice and the forebrain represents the ipsilateral eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luiten|first1=P.G.M.|title=Two visual pathways to the telencephalon in the nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum).

* In large brains, some functions tend to be strongly [[lateralization of brain function|lateralized]]. E.g., the [[language]] regions ([[Broca's area|Broca's]] and [[Wernicke's area]]) are in the left side in most humans.
* Most [[afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] and [[Efferent nerve fiber|efferent]] connections of the forebrain have bilateral components, especially outside the primary sensory and motor regions. As a result, a hemiplegia that is acquired at very young age can be completely compensated over time.

== Theories ==

According to current understanding, the contralateral organization is due to an '''axial twist''' (see below). A number of alternative proposals have been published earlier,&lt;ref name="Vulliemoz"&gt;{{

=== Visual map theory by Cajal ===

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[File:CajalChiasmTheory.png|thumb|left|300px|alt=schematic drawing of the central nervous system, showing schematically how arrow halves are projected on the eyes' retina, crossed by the optic chiasm and mapped correctly to the visual cortex|Cajal's schema of the visual map theory.

[[File:Optical-transformations.png|300px|thumb|Transformations of the visual field toward the visual map on the primary visual cortex. U=up; D=down; L=left; R=right; F=fovea]]
The visual map theory was published by the famous neuroscientist and pioneer [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]] (1898),&lt;ref name="Cajal"&gt;{{

According to this theory, the function of the optic chiasm is to repair the retinal field image on the visual cortex. The pupil in the vertebrates’ eyes inverts the image on the retina, so that the visual periphery projects to the medial side of the retina. By the chiasmatic crossing, the visual periphery is again on the outside, if one assumes that the retinal map is faithfully maintained throughout the optic tract.

The theory has a number of weaknesses.&lt;ref name="Lussanet2012"&gt;{{

arxiv=1003.1872}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the visual tracts spiral their way from the thalamic [[LGN]] to the visual cortex (see Figure; this path is known as the [[optic radiation]]). As a result, the retinal map show the visual periphery on the medial side. However, the central point of the theory was exactly to obtain a faithful visual map with the medial field projecting to the medial sides of the visual cortex.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Twist theories ===

Two twist theories have been proposed independently, the '''axial twist theory''' by de Marc Lussanet and Jan Osse&lt;ref name="Lussanet2012" /&gt; and the '''somatic twist theory''' by [[Marcel Kinsbourne]].&lt;ref name="Kinsbourne13"&gt;{{

The '''Axial Twist Theory''' was designed to explain how the pattern of contralateral organization, decussations and chiasms develops, and why this pattern is evolutionary stable.&lt;ref name="Lussanet2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lussanet2015"&gt;{{

According to the theory, the contralateral organization develops as follows. The early embryo is turned onto its left side, such that its left is turned to the yolk and its right is turned away from the yolk. This asymmetric orientation is compensated by asymmetric growth to regain superficial bilateral symmetry. The anterior head region turns to the left, as shown in the schema. The forebrain is not a superficial structure, but it is so intimately associated with superficial body structures that it turns along with the anterior head. These structures will later form the eyes, nostrils and mouth.

The body behind the head compensates the asymmetric body orientation in the opposite direction, by turning to the right (see schema). Due to these oppositely directed compensations of the anterior head and the rest of the body, the animal becomes twisted.

The Optic tract grows from the retina to the optic tectum, as dorsal and ventral are inverted in the anterior head region, the tracts grow at first to the ventral side to meet in the midline to form a chiasma. Since the opic tectum lies on the dorsal midbrain, each tract then continues dorsally to the contralateral optic tectum.

The heart and bowels are internal organs with no strong integration in external body structures, so there is no evolutionary pressure to make them turn also. Rather, these organs retain their original asymmetric orientation in the body.

==== Somatic twist theory ====

The idea of a somatic twist was inspired by the [[inversion (evolutionary biology)|dorsoventral inversion hypothesis]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dixon|first1=A. Francis |title=Why are the great motor and sensory tracts of the central nervous system crossed? |journal=The Dublin Journal of Medical Science|date=1907 |volume=124 |issue=1 |pages=1–4 |doi=10.1007/BF02972358 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02972358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinsbourne78"&gt;{{

year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea was worked out by [[Marcel Kinsbourne]].&lt;ref name="Kinsbourne13" /&gt;

According to the dorsoventral inversion hypothesis, an ancestral [[deuterostome]] turned on its back. As a result, vertebrates have a dorsal nervous system whereas [[protostomes]] have a ventral one. According to the somatic twist hypothesis, not the entire animal turned on its back but just the ″somatic″ part, i.e., everything behind the eyes, mouth and nostrils, including the forebrain.

==== Comparing Inversion, Somatic twist and Axial twist ====

The three theories are closely related. The '''Somatic twist''' hypothesis was proposed as an improvement to the '''Inversion''' hypothesis, and thus has a much wider explanatory power than its predecessor. It not only explains the inversion of the body but additionally the contralateral forebrain. The '''Axial twist''' theory was defined independently of the other two. In addition to the inverted body and the contralateral forebrain it explains why the heart and bowels are asymmetric. Moreover, it is the only of the three that is supported by evidence from embryological growth.&lt;ref name="lussanet2015" /&gt;

== Evolution ==

A remarkable property of the contralateral organization is that it is present in every vertebrate. Even the most distant clades [[agnathans]] possess an optic chiasm,&lt;ref name="Nieuwenhuys1998" /&gt; and even the skull impressions of early vertebrates from the [[Ordovician]] show the presence of an optic chiasm:&lt;ref name="Janvier96" &gt;{{

year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; this idea was worked out by Kinsbourne.&lt;ref name="Kinsbourne13"/&gt; 
There is molecular evidence for the inversion hypothesis in almost all groups of deuterostomes. It is not known, however, what exactly was the selective pressure that caused the inversion. Twisting and asymmetric development are well known from other deuterostomians such as [[Hemichordata]], [[Echinodermata]], [[Cephalochordata]] and [[Tunicata]]. Turning in the side or upside-down also occurs frequently in these clades.

== Developmental malformations ==

In [[holoprosencephaly]] the hemispheres of the cerebrum or part of it are not aligned on the left and right side but on the frontal and  occipital side of the skull, and usually remains very small. According to the axial twist hypothesis, this represents an extreme case of [[Yakovlevian torque]],&lt;ref name="Toga"&gt;{{

[[Image:Crown Closure Aerial Photo.jpg|right|thumb|Aerial Overview of Crown Closure]]

'''Crown closure''' is a term used in [[forestry]]. '''Crown closure''' and '''crown cover''' are two slightly different measures of the forest canopy and that determine the amount of light able to penetrate to the forest floor.

Crown closure, also known as canopy closure, is an integrated measure of the canopy "over a segment of the sky hemisphere above one point on the ground".&lt;Ref&gt;Jennings, S.B., N.D. Brown, and D. Sheil. 1999. Assessing forest canopies and
understorey illumination: Canopy closure, canopy cover and other measures. Forestry 72(1):59-73&lt;/ref&gt;

Crown cover is the proportion of a stand covered by the crowns of live trees.

A [[stand level modelling|forest stand]] can have a crown cover of 100% and a crown closure less than 100%.  Typical stands with 100% cover but low closure are coffee [[agroforestry]] stands, where overlapping parasol-shaped crowns ensure complete cover but still allow light to penetrate at an oblique angle to the forest floor.

==Basic concepts==

Crown closure helps predict volume, stand density, [[crown width]], and [[crown competition factor]]. Crown closure is often determined using aerial photographs because ground evaluations become difficult to obtain. Stands are usually placed in to different classes (1-6) after viewing the [[aerial photographs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sres-associated.anu.edu.au/mensuration/author.htm Brack, Chris. 1999. Crown Closure. ANU]&lt;/ref&gt;

# Very Sparse 1–9%
# Sparse 10–29%
# Low 30–49%
# Medium 50–69%
# Dense 70–84%
# Very Dense 85–100%

Although sometimes referred to as canopy cover and canopy closure, crown closure is different from these two concepts. Canopy cover represents the aggregate of all vertically projected tree crowns onto the ground surface, while canopy closure represents the amount of the sky obscured by the canopy from a certain point on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.eri.nau.edu/gsdl/collect/erilibra/import/Egan_2010_FactSheet_CanopyCover.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ground measurement==

Each tree’s measurements are used to calculate the area projected by the [[crown (botany)|crown]] onto the ground. Summing the crown areas for all trees measured on a fixed plot area and dividing by the ground area will give the crown closure. The "moosehorn" crown closure estimator is a device for measuring crown closure from the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Garrison, G.A. 1949. Uses and modifications for the "moosehorn" crown closure estimator. [[Journal of Forestry]] 47(9):733:735.&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods for estimating crown closure include the use of line-intercept, spherical densiometer, and [[hemispherical photography]].&lt;ref&gt;Fiala, A.C.S.. Garman, S.L., and A.N. Gray. 2006. Comparison of five canopy cover estimation techniques in the western Oregon Cascades. [[Forest Ecology and Management]] 232:186-197.&lt;/ref&gt; Exact cover measurements should be made in vertical direction, or the cover percent will be overestimated.&lt;ref name="jennings"&gt;Jennings, S. B., Brown, N. D., &amp; Sheil, D. 1999. Assessing forest canopies and understorey illumination: canopy closure, canopy cover and other measures. Forestry 72(1): 59–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aerial measurement==

Aerial photographs made at scales of 1:15,000 or larger can be used to determine crown closure estimates, usually done by ocular interpretation, by grouping stands into percent classes.&lt;ref name="avery"&gt;Avery, T.E. and Burkhart, H.E. 2002. Forest Measurements. 5th edition. McGraw Hill, New York. 456 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Low density stands make for an easy ocular estimation, but as the stand density increases the ocular estimates become more difficult to obtain. In dense stands, overestimates or underestimates of crown closure can be made and predicting value of stand volume becomes more reduced.&lt;ref name="spur"&gt;Spur, S.H. 1952. [[Forest Inventory]] Ronald Press, New York. 476p.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ectomycorrhizal extramatrical mycelium''' (also known as extraradical mycelium) is the collection of filamentous [[fungal]] hyphae emanating from [[ectomycorrhizas]]. It may be composed of fine, [[hydrophilic]] hypha which branches frequently to explore and exploit the soil matrix or may aggregate to form [[rhizomorphs]]; highly differentiated, [[hydrophobic]], enduring, transport structures.

Apart from [[mycorrhizas]], extramatrical mycelium is the primary vegetative body of ectomycorrhizal fungi.

=== Exploration type ===

The mycelial growth pattern, extent of biomass accumulation, and the presence or absence of [[rhizomorphs]] are used to classify fungi by exploration type. Agerer first proposed the designation of exploration types in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agerer|first=R.|title=Exploration types of ectomycorrhizae A proposal to classify ectomycorrhizal mycelial systems according to their patterns of differentiation and putative ecological importance|journal=Mycorrhiza|year=2001|volume=11|pages=107–114|doi=10.1007/s005720100108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the concept has since been widely employed in studies of ectomycorrhizal [[ecology]]. Four exploration types are commonly recognized: Contact, Short-distance, Medium-distance and Long-distance.

''Contact'' exploration types possess a predominantly smooth mantle and lack rhizomorphs with ectomycorrhizas in close contact with the surrounding [[substrate (biology)|substrate]]. 
''Short-distance'' exploration types also lack rhizomorphs but the mantle is surrounded by frequent projections of hyphae, which emanate a short distance into the surrounding substrate. Most ectomycorrhizal [[ascomycetes]] are included in this group. 
''Medium-distance'' exploration types are further divided into three subtypes defined by the growth range and differentiation of its rhizomorphs. ''Medium-distance Fringe'' form interconnected hyphal networks with rhizomorphs that divide and fuse repeatedly. ''Medium-distance Mat'' types form dense hyphal mats which aggregate into a homogeneous mass. Finally, the ''Medium-distance Smooth'' sub-type has rhizomorphs with smooth mantles and margins. [[File:HYPHAE.png|thumbnail|right|Fungal Hyphae Cells 1- Hyphal wall 2- Septum 3- Mitochondrion 4- Vacuole 5- Ergosterol crystal 6- Ribosome 7- Nucleus 8- Endoplasmic reticulum 9- Lipid body 10- Plasma membrane 11- Spitzenkörper/growth tip and vesicles 12- Golgi apparatus]]
''Long-distance'' exploration types are highly differentiated, forming rhizomorphs that contain hollow vessel-like transport tubes. Long distance types are associated with increased levels of organic nitrogen uptake compared to other exploration types and are thought to be less competitive in disturbed systems in contrast to short distance types which are able to regenerate more efficiently after a [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lilleskov|first=E. A|author2=Hobbie, E. A. |author3=Horton, T. R. |title=Conservation of ectomycorrhizal fungi: exploring the linkages between functional and taxonomic responses to anthropogenic N deposition. Fungal Ecology|journal=Fungal Ecology|year=2011|volume=4|issue=2|pages=174–183|doi=10.1016/j.funeco.2010.09.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploration type is primarily consistent within a given [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]]. However, some fungal genera which contain a large number of [[species]] have a great diversity of extramatrical hyphal morphology and are known to contain more than one exploration type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agerer|first=R.|title=Fungal relationships and structural identity of their ectomycorrhizae|journal=Mycological Progress|year=2006|volume=5|issue=2|pages=67–107|doi=10.1007/s11557-006-0505-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, extrapolating exploration type to species known only by lineage is difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tedersoo|first=L.|author2=Smith, M. E|title=Lineages of ectomycorrhizal fungi revisited: Foraging strategies and novel lineages revealed by sequences from belowground.|journal=Fungal Biology Reviews|year=2013|volume=27|issue=3–4|pages=83–99|doi=10.1016/j.fbr.2013.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, Fungi fail to fit into a defined exploration type, falling instead along a gradient. Exploration type also fails to take into account other aspects of hyphal morphology, such as the extent to which hyphae cross into deeper [[soil horizons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Genney|first=D.R.|author2=Anderson, I. C. |author3=Alexander, I. J. |title=Fine-scale distribution of pine ectomycorrhizas and their extramatrical mycelium.|journal=The New Phytologist|year=2006|volume=170|issue=2|pages=381–90|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2006.01669.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Field studies have shown that extramatrical mycelium is more likely to proliferate in [[mineral soil]]s than in [[organic material]], and may be particularly absent in fresh [[leaf litter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lindahl|first=B.D.|author2=Ihrmark, K. |author3=Boberg, J. |author4=Trumbore, S.

W. |author4=Hoffland, E. |author5=Rosling, A. |author6=Wernars, K. |author7=Smit, E. |title=Molecular identification of ectomycorrhizal mycelium in soil horizons.|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=2003|volume=69|issue=1|pages=327–33|pmc=152382 |pmid=12514012 |doi=10.1128/aem.69.1.327-333.2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecological implications ==

=== Community assembly ===

[[File:Laccaria, DOE.jpg|thumbnail|left|Ectomycorrhizal Laccaria fruit bodies in forest community]]
Because ectomycorrhizas are small and possess a limited contact area with the surrounding soil, the presence of extramatrical hyphae significantly increases the [[surface area]] in contact with the surrounding environment. Increased surface area means greater access to necessary nutrient sources. Additionally, the presence of rhizomorphs or [[mycelial cords]], can act comparably to [[xylem]] tissue in plants, where hollow tubes of vessel hyphae shuttle water and [[solubilized]] nutrients over long distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cairney|first=J. W. G.|title=Translocation of solutes in ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic rhizomorphs.|journal=Mycological Research|year=1992|volume=96|issue=2|pages=135–141|doi=10.1016/S0953-7562(09)80928-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The abundance and spatial distribution of host root tips in the [[rhizosphere]] is an important factor mediating ectomycorrhizal [[Community (ecology)|community assembly]]. Root density may select for the exploration types best suited for a given root spacing. In [[Pine]] systems, Fungi that display short-distance exploration types are less able to colonize new roots spaced far from the mycorrhiza, and long-distance types dominate areas of low root density. Conversely, short-distance exploration types tend to dominate areas of high root density where decreased carbon expenditure makes them more competitive than long-distance species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peay|first=K. G|author2=Kennedy, P. G. |author3=Bruns, T. D. |title=Rethinking ectomycorrhizal succession: are root density and hyphal exploration types drivers of spatial and temporal zonation?|journal=Fungal Ecology|year=2011|volume=4|issue=3|pages=233–240|doi=10.1016/j.funeco.2010.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The growth of extramatrical mycelium has a direct effect on the mutualistic nutrient trading between ectomycorrhizal fungi and their hosts. Increased hyphal occupation of the soil allows the fungus to take greater advantage of water and nutrients otherwise inaccessible to plant roots and to more efficiently transport these resources back to the plant. Conversely, the increased costs in carbon allocation associated with supporting a fungal partner with an extensive mycelial system presents a number of questions related to the [[costs and benefits]] of ectomycorrhizal mutualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weigt|first=R. B.|author2=Raidl, S. |author3=Verma, R. |author4=Agerer, R. |title=Exploration type-specific standard values of extramatrical mycelium – a step towards quantifying ectomycorrhizal space occupation and biomass in natural soil.|journal=Mycological Progress|year=2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=287–297|doi=10.1007/s11557-011-0750-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carbon cycling ===

Although there is evidence that certain species of mycorrhizal fungi may obtain at least a portion of their carbon via [[saprotrophic nutrition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Talbot|first=J.M.|author2=Allison, S. D. |author3=Treseder, K. K. |title=Decomposers in disguise: mycorrhizal fungi as regulators of soil C dynamics in ecosystems under global change.|journal=Functional Ecology|year=2008|volume=22|issue=6|pages=955–963|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2008.01402.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; the bulk of mycorrhizal carbon acquisition happens by way of trading for host-derived [[Photosynthate|photosynthetic products]]. Mycorrhizal systems represent a major [[carbon sink]].

Many researchers have attempted projections of the role that extramatrical mycelium may play in [[carbon sequestration]].  Although estimates of the life span of individual ectomycorrhizas very considerably, turnover is generally considered on a scale of months. [[File:Ectomycorrhizae002.jpg|thumbnail|right|Cortinarius ectomycorrhizas and extramatrical mycelium on ''Pseudotsuga menziesii'' roots]]After death, the presence ectomycorrhizas on root tips, may increase the rate of root [[decomposition]] for some [[Taxonomy (biology)|fungal taxa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koide|first=R.T.|author2=Fernandez, C. W. |author3=Peoples, M. S. |title=Can ectomycorrhizal colonization of Pinus resinosa roots affect their decomposition?|journal=New Phytologist|year=2011|volume=191|issue=2|pages=508–14|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03694.x|pmid=21418224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides host plant death and mycorrhizal turnover, rates of carbon sequestration may also be affected by disturbances in the soil, which cause sections of the extramatrical mycelium to become severed from the host plant. Such disturbances, such as those caused by animal disruption, [[mycophagous]] invertebrates or habitat destruction, may have a notable impact on turnover rates. These variables make it difficult to estimate the turnover rates of mycorrhizal biomass in forest soils and the relative contribution of extramatrical mycelium to carbon sequestration.

=== Mycelial networks ===

The presence of long-distance extramatrical hyphae may affect forest health via the formation of common mycelial networks, in which hyphal connections form between plant hosts and can facilitate the transfer of carbon and nutrients between hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selosse|first=M.A.|author2=Richard, F. |author3=He, X. |author4=Simard, S.

In this way, extramatrical mycelium is important to the maintenance of soil [[food webs]],&lt;ref name="Pollierer 2007 729–36"/&gt; supplying a significant nutritive source to invertebrates and [[microorganisms]].

== Mineral access ==

=== Enzyme production ===

The [[enzymatic activity|enzymatic activities]] of ectomycorrhizal fungi are highly variable between species. These differences are correlated with exploration type (particularly the presence or absence of rhizomorphs) rather than lineage or host association- suggesting that similar morphologies of extraradical mycelium are an example of [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref name="TedersooNaadel2012"/&gt; Differences in [[enzymatic activity]], and hence the ability to degrade [[organic compounds]] dictate fungal nutrient access, with wide ranging ecological implications.

=== Phosphorus ===

Because diverse ectomycorrhizal fungal taxa differ greatly in their [[metabolic activity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trocha, L. K.|first=L. K.|author2=Mucha, J. |author3=Eissenstat, D. M. |author4=Reich, P.

I.|author2=Malajczuk, N. |author3=Grove, T. S. |title=The ability of 16 ectomycorrhizal fungi to increase growth and phosphorus uptake of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. and E. diversicolor F. Muell.|journal=Plant and Soil|year=1993|volume=153|issue=2|pages=155–164|doi=10.1007/BF00012988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phosphorus acquisition by mycorrhizal fungi, and the subsequent transfer to plant hosts, is thought to be one of the main functions of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis. Extramatrical mycelium is the site of collection for phosphorus within the soil system. This relationship is so strong that starving host plants of phosphorus is known to increase the growth of extramatrical mycelium tenfold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallander|first=H.|author2=Nylund, J. E.|title=Effects of excess nitrogen and phosphorus starvation on the extramatrical mycelium of ectomycorrhizas of Pinus sylvestris L.|journal=New Phytologist|year=1992|volume=120|issue=4|pages=495–503|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1992.tb01798.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nitrogen ===

Recently, [[Isotope|Isotopic]] studies have been used to investigate relative trading between ectomycorrhizal fungi and plant hosts and to assess the relative importance of exploration type on nutrient trading ability. &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N values are elevated in ectomycorrhizal Fungi and depleted in fungal hosts, as a result of nutrient trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hogberg|first=P.|author2=Hogberg, M.

E. |author4=Ekblad, A. |author5=Nasholm, T. |title=Nitrogen isotope fractionation during nitrogen uptake by ectomycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal Pinus sylvestris.|journal=New Phytologist|year=1999|volume=142|issue=3|pages=569–576|doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.1999.00404.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fungal species with exploration types producing greater amounts of extraradical mycelium are known to accumulate greater amounts &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N &lt;ref name="TedersooNaadel2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hobbie|first=E.A.|author2=Agerer, R.|title=Nitrogen isotopes in ectomycorrhizal sporocarps correspond to belowground exploration types|journal=Plant and Soil|year=2009|volume=327|issue=1–2|pages=71–83|doi=10.1007/s11104-009-0032-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; in both root tips and fruit bodies, a phenomenon partially attributed to higher levels of N cycling within these species.

== Assessment methods ==

[[File:Amanita phalloides.R.H. 17.jpg|thumbnail|right| ''Amanita phalloides'' mycelium]]
Determining the [[longevity]] of extramatrical mycelium is difficult, and estimates range from just a few months to several years. Turnover rates are assessed in a variety of ways including direct observation and &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;[[Carbon dating|C dating]]. Such estimates are an important variable in calculating the contribution that ectomycorrhizal fungi have to [[carbon sequestration]].&lt;ref name="Cairney 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cairney|first=J. W. G|title=Extramatrical mycelia of ectomycorrhizal fungi as moderators of carbon dynamics in forest soil.|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry.|year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.soilbio.2011.12.029|volume=47|pages=198–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to differentiate ectomycorrhizal mycelium from the mycelium of [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophic fungi]], biomass estimates are often done by [[ergosterol]] or phospholipid fatty acid analysis, or by using sand-filled bags, which are likely to be avoided by saprotrophic fungi because they lack [[organic matter]].&lt;ref name="Cairney 2012"/&gt;
Detailed morphological characterization of exploration type has been defined for over 550 different ectomycorrhizal species and are compiled in [[Deemy Database|www. deemy. de]]. 
Due to the difficulty in classifying exploration types of intermediate forms, other metrics have been proposed to qualify and quantify the growth of extramatrical mycelium, including Specific Actual/Potential Mycelium Space Occupation and Specific Extramatrical Mycelial Length&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weigt|first=R.B.|author2=Raidl, S. |author3=Verma, R. |author4=Agerer, R. |title=Exploration type-specific standard values of extramatrical mycelium – a step towards quantifying ectomycorrhizal space occupation and biomass in natural soil.|journal=Mycological Progress|year=2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=287–297|doi=10.1007/s11557-011-0750-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; which attempt to account for the contributions of mycelial [[density]], [[surface area]] and total [[biomass]].

'''Ethnic studies''', in the United States, is the [[interdisciplinary]] study of difference—chiefly race, ethnicity, and nation, but also sexuality, gender, and other such markings—and power, as expressed by the state, by civil society, and by individuals. Ethnic studies is an academic field that spans the humanities and the social sciences, it emerged as an academic field in the second half of the 20th century partly in response to charges that traditional social science and humanities disciplines such as [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[literature]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[cultural studies]], and [[area studies]] which were conceived from an inherently [[Eurocentric]] perspective. Its origin, then, lies in the civil rights era, when ethnic studies was originally conceived to re-frame the way that specific disciplines had told the stories, histories, struggles and triumphs of people of color on what was seen to be their own terms. In recent years, it has broadened its focus to include questions of representation, [[racialization]], [[racial formation theory]], and more determinedly interdisciplinary topics and approaches.

==History==
In the United States, the field of ethnic studies evolved out of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] during the 1960s and early 1970s, which contributed to growing self-awareness and radicalization of people of color such as African-Americans, Asian Americans, Latino Americans, and [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]]. Ethnic studies departments were established on college campuses across the country and have grown to encompass [[African American Studies]], [[Asian American Studies]], [[La Raza|Raza]] Studies, [[Chicano Studies]], Mexican American Studies, and [[Native American Studies]], as well as Jewish-American Studies and Italian-American Studies.
 
The first strike demanding the establishment of an Ethnic Studies department occurred in 1968, led by the [[Third World Liberation Front]] (TWLF), a joint effort of the Black Student Union, Latin American Students Organization, Asian American Political Alliance, Pilipino American Collegiate Endeavor, and Native American Students Union at [[San Francisco State University]]. This was the longest student strike in the nation's history, and resulted in the establishment of a School of Ethnic Studies. President [[S. I. Hayakawa]] ended the strike after taking a hardline approach,when he appointed Dr. James Hirabayashi the first dean of the School (now College) of Ethnic Studies at San Francisco State University,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/people/profile.php?profile=Hirabayashi, James]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increased recruiting and admissions of students of color in response to the strike's demands. In 1972, The National Association for Ethnic Studies was founded to foster interdisciplinary discussions for scholars and activists concerned with the national and international dimensions of ethnicity encouraging conversations related to anthropology, Africana Studies, Native Studies, Sociology and American Studies among other fields.

Minority students at The [[University of California at Berkeley]]- united under their own Third World Liberation Front, the TWLF, initiated the second longest student strike in the history of this country on January 22, 1969. The groups involved were the Mexican American Student Confederation, Asian American Political Alliance, African American Student Union, and the Native American group. The four co-Chairmen of the TWLF were Ysidro Macias, Richard Aoki, Charlie Brown, and LaNada Means.

This strike at Berkeley was even more violent than the San Francisco State strike, in that more than five police departments, the California Highway Patrol, Alameda County Deputies, and finally, the California National Guard were ordered onto the Berkeley campus by Ronald Reagan in the effort to quash the strike. The excessive use of police force has been cited with promoting the strike by the alienation of non-striking students and faculty, who protested the continual presence of police on the Berkeley campus. The faculty union voted to join the strike on March 2, and two days later the Academic Senate called on the administration to grant an interim Department of Ethnic Studies. On March 7, 1969, President Hitch authorized the establishment of the first Ethnic Studies Department in the country, followed by the establishment of the nation's first College of Ethnic Studies at [[San Francisco State University]] on March 20, 1969. 

Courses in ethnic studies address perceptions that, because of the Eurocentric bias and racial and ethnic prejudice of those in power, American historians have systematically ignored or undervalued the roles of such ethnic minorities as Asian Americans, Blacks, Mexicans, Latinos and Native Americans.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Ethnic studies also often encompasses issues of [[intersectionality]], where gender, class, and sexuality also come into play. There are now hundreds of African American, Asian American, Mexican American and Chicano/Latino Studies departments in the US, approximately fifty Native American Studies departments, and a small number of comparative ethnic studies programs. College students, especially on the East Coast, continue to advocate for Ethnic Studies departments. The Ethnic Studies Coalition at [[Wellesley College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thewellesleynews.com/2018/10/25/ethnic-studies-coalition-pushes-for-ethnic-studies-major-at-wellesley/|title=Ethnic Studies Coalition pushes for Ethnic Studies major at Wellesley {{!}} The Wellesley News|website=thewellesleynews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Taskforce for Asian and Pacific American Studies at [[Harvard University]], and CRAASH at [[Hunter College]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/university-students-alumni-fight-increase-asian-american-studies-n589246|title=University Students, Alumni Fight for Growth in Asian American Studies|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; are among student organizations calling for increased institutional support for Ethnic Studies. Ethnic studies as an institutional discipline varies by location. For instance, whereas the Ethnic Studies Department at [[UC Berkeley]] comprises separate "core group" departments, the department at [[UC San Diego]] does not do so.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20050319222738/http://www.columbiaspectator.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2005/02/09/4209bd8f7f02c]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools of thought==
While early ethnic studies scholarship focused on the repressed histories and identities of various groups in the U.S., the field of study has expanded to encompass transnationalism, comparative race Studies, and postmodernist/poststructuralist critiques. While pioneering thinkers relied on frameworks, theories and methodologies such as those found in the allied fields of sociology, history, literature and film, scholars in the field today utilize multidisciplinary as well as comparative perspectives, increasingly within an international or transnational context. Central to much Ethnic Studies scholarship is understanding how race, class, gender, sexuality, ability, and other categories of difference intersect to shape the lived experiences of people of color, what the legal scholar [[Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw|Kimberle Crenshaw]] calls intersectionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1229039|title=Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color|first=Kimberle|last=Crenshaw|date=January 1, 1991|publisher=|journal=Stanford Law Review|volume=43|issue=6|pages=1241–1299|doi=10.2307/1229039}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most recently, "whiteness" studies has been included as a popular site of inquiry in what is a traditionally academic field for studying the racial formation of communities of color. Instead of including whites as another additive component to ethnic studies, [[whiteness studies]] has instead focused on how the political and juridical category of white has been constructed and protected in relation to racial "others" and how it continues to shape the relationship between bodies of color and the State. As Ian Haney-Lopez articulates in ''White By Law: The Legal Construction of Race'', the law has functioned as the vehicle through which certain racialized groups have been included or excluded from the category of whiteness across time, and thus marked as inside or outside the national imaginary (read as white) and the privileges that result from this belonging.&lt;ref&gt;''White By Law: The Legal Construction of Race''&lt;/ref&gt; Important to whiteness studies, according to scholars such as Richard Dyer, is understanding how white bodies are both invisible and hypervisible, and how representations of whiteness in visual culture reflect and, in turn, shape a persistent commitment to white supremacy in the U.S. even as some claim the nation is currently a colorblind meritocracy.&lt;ref&gt;''White''&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to visual culture, space also reproduces and normalizes whiteness. The sociologist George Lipsitz argues that whiteness is a condition rather than a skin color, a structured advantage of accumulated privilege that resurfaces across time spatially and obscures the racism that continues to mark certain bodies as out of place and responsible for their own disadvantage.&lt;ref name="Lipsitz (2011)"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lipsitz |first=George |title=How Racism Takes Place |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-43990-256-1 |pages=320 |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lv0musrlBGYC |accessdate=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such attention to geography is an example of the way ethnic studies scholars have taken up the study of race and ethnicity across almost all disciplines using various methodologies in the humanities and social sciences.

In general, an "Ethnic Studies approach" is loosely defined as any approach that emphasizes the cross-relational and intersectional study of different groups. George Lipsitz again is important here, in demonstrating how the project of anti-black racism defines the relationship between the white spatial imaginary and other communities of color. Thus the [[redlining]] of the 1930s that prevented upwardly mobile African Americans from moving into all-white neighborhoods also forced Latino and Asian bodies into certain spaces.

==Relationship to other fields==

Ethnic studies exists in dialogue—and occasional tension—with a variety of related fields and disciplines.

In the case of traditional disciplines, ethnic studies often confronts resistance if not outright hostility to its mission. With many departments clinging to the ideal of objective and detached scholarship, the field is generally seen as a more politicized (and therefore, for some, a more troubling) form of academic inquiry. This hostility reflects, in some cases, a disinterest in the diversification of subject areas and the preservation of historically prominent fields. In the case of interdisciplinary fields, as ethnic studies has moved from a study of specific racial and ethnic groups towards the scrutiny of power dynamics, it has grown closer to fields like African American studies, Asian American studies, Native American studies, Latin@ studies, and American studies. Even more recently, ethnic studies has grown philosophically and politically closer to LGTBQ studies.

"Ethnic Studies" is often housed within departments or units with many different names. Teaching units often have a range of different names—Critical Ethnic Studies,&lt;ref name="las.depaul.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://las.depaul.edu/departments/critical-ethnic-studies/Pages/default.aspx|title=Critical Ethnic Studies  -  Academics  -  DePaul University College of LAS|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226101614/http://las.depaul.edu/departments/critical-ethnic-studies/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=December 26, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative American Cultures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://admission.wsu.edu/academics/fos/Public/field.castle?id=7584|title=Comparative Ethnic Studies - FOS - Admissions - WSU|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic Studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethnicstudies.berkeley.edu/ethnicstudies.php|title=Comparative Ethnic Studies Program - Ethnic Studies Department - UC Berkeley|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or American Studies and Ethnicity&lt;ref&gt;http://dornsife.usc.edu/ase/&lt;/ref&gt;—for curricula and faculty who are gathered together under the same set of academic interests. A wide variety of curricula are employed in the service of each of these rubrics. Occasionally, the gap between American Studies and Ethnic Studies can be productively bridged, especially in departments where the bulk of faculty focus on race and ethnicity, difference and power. But that bridgework can be troublesome, obscuring one foci and sharpening the emphasis on another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/49761|title=American Indians, American Studies, and the ASA|first=Philip Joseph|last=Deloria|date=January 1, 2003|publisher=|volume=55|issue=4|pages=669–680|accessdate=June 14, 2016|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.1353/aq.2003.0034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of this great variation, though, ethnic studies needs to be understood within its specific institutional context. And, despite considerable financial (and often political) pressure to consolidate or eliminate ethnic studies within American Studies—or to house Native American studies, Latin@ studies, and Asian American studies within either ethnic studies or American Studies—the relationships between these fields should be considered within each institution's governing eco-system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://capitalcityhues.com/041714EthnicStudiesUW.html|title=The Capital City Hues/041714/The Future of UW-Ethnic Studies|first=Jonathan|last=Gramling|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional associations==

===National Association for Ethnic Studies (NAES)===

The [http://ethnicstudies.org National Association for Ethnic Studies] was founded in 1972 by several scholars who wanted to study race through an interdisciplinary approach. It was initially named the National Association of Interdisciplinary Studies for Native-American, Black, Chicano, Puerto Rican, and Asian Americans. The organization was officially renamed in 1985.&lt;ref name="ethnicstudies.org"&gt;http://ethnicstudies.org/about/naes-history&lt;/ref&gt; It is the oldest ethnic studies association in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://ethnicstudies.org&lt;/ref&gt;

From its founding, the organization has strived to promote scholarship, research, and curriculum design for its members.&lt;ref name="ethnicstudies.org"/&gt; The organization hosts an annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;http://ethnicstudies.org/things-to-do-in-the-area&lt;/ref&gt;

NAES also publishes the Ethnic Studies Review, a peer-reviewed journal for scholarship in ethnic studies.&lt;ref&gt;http://ethnicstudies.org/publications/review&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical Ethnic Studies Association (CESA)===

The Critical Ethnic Studies Association began with its first conference in March 2011 at the University of California Riverside, Critical Ethnic Studies and the Future of Genocide: [[Settler colonialism]]/[[Heteropatriarchy]]/[[White Supremacy]]. This prompted the people who had organized and partaken in the conference to form the association. The second conference then took place in September 2013 at the University of Illinois Chicago and it was themed, Decolonizing Future Intellectual Legacies and Activist Practices. The third conference took place from April 30-May 2015 at York University in Toronto and it is titled, Sovereignties and Colonialisms: Resisting Racism, Extraction and Dispossession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criticalethnicstudies.org/content/conference-information|title=CONFERENCE INFORMATION  - criticalethnicstudies.org|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530163243/https://www.criticalethnicstudies.org/content/conference-information|archivedate=May 30, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some instances, ethnic studies has become entrapped within and similar to the mandates of liberal [[multiculturalism]], which relies on politics beholden to US nation-building and capitalist imperatives. Ethnic studies is in a difficult position, because as it gets more legitimizes within the academy, it has frequently done so by distancing itself from the very social movements that were the triggers for its creation. On the other hand, ethnic studies departments have always existed on the margins of the academic industrial complex, and become further marginalized through funding cuts due to the 2008 global economic crisis. Instead of just dismissing or wholly embracing identitarian nationalism, CESA seeks to construct an open dialogue around issues like white supremacy, settler colonialism, capitalism, and [[heteropatriarchy]], militarism, occupation, indigenous erasure, [[neocolonialism]], anti-immigration anti-Islam, etc. in order to expand the parameters and capacities of ethnic studies.

CESA's goal is not to romanticize all movements or dictate a specific relationship between scholars and activists. Instead, it questions the emphasis of professionalization within ethnic studies, the politics of the academic industrial complex, or the engagement of larger movements for social transformation. It recognizes that at times Ethnic Studies has been complicit in neutralizing the university, rather than questioning the university's ideologies actions, knowledge, and power. It works to situate the university as a point of contention, as a location among many for political struggles. CESA invites participation from all types of people: scholars, students, activists, arts, media makers, and educators of all fields, generations, and disciplines. The Critical Ethnic Studies Association was founded as a transnational, interdisciplinary, and un-disciplinary association of scholars, activists, students, artists, media makers, educators, and others who are directly concerned with interrogating the limitations of ethnic studies in order to better engage the historical stakes of the field. It organizes projects and programs to reimagine ethnic studies and its future through new interventions, both scholarly and activist based. They aim to develop an approach to scholarship, institution building, and activism animated by the spirit of the decolonial, antiracist, and other global liberationist movements that enabled the creation of Ethnic Studies in the first place. It hopes that this approach will continue to inform its political and intellectual projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criticalethnicstudies.org/content/mission-vision|title=Mission &amp; Vision - criticalethnicstudies.org|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530163406/https://www.criticalethnicstudies.org/content/mission-vision|archivedate=May 30, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a huge emphasis on counteracting institutional marginalization, revisiting the ideas that prompted the creation of ethnic studies, and to create new conversations that challenge US hegemony in traditional ethnic studies. Their goals include establishing an interdisciplinary network of scholars and activists stimulating debate on critical ethnic studies, providing forums such as the biannual conference or dialogues thought seminars, social media, etc. There is also a focus on publishing a journal, ''Critical Ethnic Studies'', for new scholarships, and to facilitate dialogues that is critical and constructive between activist and academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criticalethnicstudies.org/content/history-goals|title=History &amp; Goals - criticalethnicstudies.org|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617094135/https://www.criticalethnicstudies.org/content/history-goals|archivedate=June 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In high schools==

===In California schools===
While ethnic studies courses have had a presence throughout high schools in Southwest states, there have been attacks on the discipline in the past couple of years, with the state of California never fully enforcing such courses in its high schools. However, students and educators of school districts across Southern California are pushing towards implementing ethnic studies courses into school requirements. The [[El Rancho Unified School District]] (ERUSD), which serves the area of Pico Rivera, became the first school district in California to require an ethnic studies class as part of its students' graduation requirement in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erusd.org/|title=El Rancho Unified School District|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnic studies resolution in ERUSD was both drafted and proposed by ERUSD's board President, Aurora Villon and Vice President, Jose Lara and was presented as an effort to "expose ... students to global perspectives and inclusion of diversity".&lt;ref name="whittierdailynews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whittierdailynews.com/social-affairs/20140711/el-rancho-unified-school-district-authorizes-historic-ethnic-studies-graduation-requirement|title=El Rancho Unified School District authorizes historic ethnic studies graduation requirement|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This graduation requirement for ERUSD high school students is expected to be fully implemented by the 2015–2016 academic school year.&lt;ref name="whittierdailynews.com"/&gt;

In a similar move, [[Los Angeles Unified School District]] (LAUSD) will also begin to require ethnic studies courses in its high schools and will include such courses in its A-G graduation requirements. In November 2014, the LAUSD board approved a resolution proposed by board members Bennett Kayser, George McKenna and Steve Zimmer.&lt;ref name="laschoolreport.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laschoolreport.com/lausd-board-votes-to-add-ethnic-studies-to-schools-curriculum/|title=LAUSD board votes to add Ethnic Studies to schools' curriculum|date=November 19, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnic studies curriculum will begin as a pilot program in at least five high schools.&lt;ref name="laschoolreport.com"/&gt; It is expected that by the 2017–2018 academic school year, every high school will offer at least one course in ethnic studies and the class would be compulsory by the time the class of 2019 graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-ethnic-studies-20141209-story.html|title=L.A. Unified to require ethnic studies for high school graduation|first=Los Angeles|last=Times|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While LAUSD board members proposed the resolution, many students took on the efforts by creating petitions and rallies in support of the ethnic studies resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnicstudiesnow.com/nov_23_bennett_kayser_fundraiser|title=Sunday (Nov 23) Bennett Kayser Fundraiser (EAGLE ROCK)|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnicstudiesnow.com/lausd_rally_nov18|title=Nov 18 Rally &amp; Press Conference|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In New York schools===

The New York State government has implemented the Dignity for All Students Act (DASA) which requires administrative, supervisory, and student service personnel to be trained in "Harassment, Bullying, Cyber bullying, and Discrimination in Schools: Prevention and Intervention".&lt;ref name="archive.advocate.nyc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.advocate.nyc.gov/bullying/DASA|title=About the Dignity for All Students Act|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, ethnic studies is framed through the lens of "bullying" as an challenge for minority students to get the most out of their education in a safe classroom environment. For the creators of DASA, bullying has the potential to disrupt a student's bodily and emotional safety.

DASA aims to do the following:&lt;ref name="archive.advocate.nyc.gov"/&gt;

*DASA is designed to protect public schools students from bullying by employees or other students based on actual or perceived race, color, weight, national origin, ethnic group, religion, religious practice, disability, sexual orientation, gender, or sex.
*DASA requires schools and districts to revise codes of conduct to prohibit bullying and promote a bully-free environment, and to include age-appropriate versions of the policy in codes of conduct. School districts will be required to post codes of conduct on their websites by July 1, 2013.
*DASA requires K-12 schools to incorporate curriculum that promotes awareness of and sensitivity to discrimination and diversity as part of civility and citizenship classes.
*DASA requires every school to nominate a Dignity Act Coordinator that will be responsible for handling incidents of bullying.
*DASA requires schools to collect and report data on bullying to the New York State education commissioner at least once a year.
*DASA prohibits retaliation against anyone who reports incidents of bullying.
*DASA holds the State education commissioner responsible for helping school districts develop effective responses to bullying that are focused on solutions, intervention and education.

==Political attacks==
Ethnic studies has always been opposed by different elements. Proponents of ethnic studies feel that this is a reactionary movement from the right. They note the rise of the conservative movement during the 1990s in the United States, in which the discipline came increasingly under attack. For proponents, the backlash is an attempt to preserve "traditional values" of Western culture, symbolized by the United States. For some critics, this  is a slant by proponents to disparage criticism by false association to right wing ideology. They have no objection about African, Latino or Native American culture being legitimate topics of academic research.  What they object to is the current state of ethnic studies which they see as characterized by excessive left wing political ideology, [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] [[relativism]] which, in their view, greatly undermined the scholarly validity of the research. However, ethnic studies is accused of promoting "racial separatism", "linguistic isolation" and "racial preference".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acri.org/newsletter/june19993.htm acri.org/newsletter/june19993.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041223161232/http://www.acri.org/newsletter/june19993.htm |date=December 23, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Ward Churchill]], a professor of ethnic studies at [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], came under severe fire for an essay he wrote called "[[On the Justice of Roosting Chickens]]", in which he claimed that the [[September 11 attacks]] were a natural and unavoidable consequence of what he views as unlawful US policy, and referred to the "technocratic corps" working in the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] as "[[little Eichmanns]]".&lt;ref name="college-journalist-touched-off-firestorm"&gt;{{cite news | title = College journalist touched off firestorm | author = Charlie Brennan | work = Rocky Mountain News | date = February 3, 2005 | url = http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2005/feb/03/college-journalist-touched-off-firestorm/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative commentators used the Churchill affair to attack ethnic studies departments as enclaves of "anti-Americanism" which promote the idea of ethnic groups as "victims" in US society, and not places where serious scholarship is done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldblatt |first=Mark |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/goldblatt200502090753.asp |title=nationalreview.com/comment/goldblatt200502090753.asp |publisher=Nationalreview.com |date=February 9, 2005 |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of such attacks, ethnic studies scholars are now faced with having to defend the field. In the media, this takes form of characterising the attack as right wing reactionary movement. For example, Orin Starn, a cultural anthropologist and specialist in Native American Studies at [[Duke University]], says: "The United States is a very diverse country, and an advocate would say we teach kids to understand multiculturalism and diversity, and these are tools that can be used in law, government, business and teaching, which are fields graduates go into. It promotes thinking about diversity, globalization, how we do business and how we work with nonprofits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.denverpost.com/Stories/0,1413,36~53~2722200,00.html |title=denverpost.com/Stories/0,1413,36~53~2722200,00.html |work=Denver Post |accessdate=October 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515114123/http://www.denverpost.com/Stories/0%2C1413%2C36~53~2722200%2C00.html |archivedate=May 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to criticisms that ethnic studies academics undermine the study of a unified American history and culture or that ethnic studies are simply a "colored" version of American Studies, defenders point out that ethnic studies come out of the historically repressed and denied presence of groups within the U.S. knowledge-production, literature and epistemology. Efforts to merge ethnic studies with American studies have been met with fierce opposition as was the case at UC Berkeley. While the field is already decades old, the ongoing creation of new ethnic studies departments is fraught with controversy. Administrators at Columbia University attempted to placate student protests for the creation of an Ethnic Studies Department in 1996 by offering American Studies as a compromise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E2D81E39F93AA25757C0A960958260 |title=nytimes.com |work=New York Times |date=April 19, 1996 |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arizona ban==

On May 11, 2010, Arizona Governor [[Jan Brewer]] signed House Bill 2281 (also known as HB 2281 and A.R.S. §15–112), which prohibits a school district or charter school from including in its program of instruction any courses or classes that
#Promotes the overthrow of the Federal or state government or the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]
#Promotes resentment toward any race or class (e.g. racism and classism)
#Advocates ethnic solidarity instead of being individuals
#Are designed for a certain ethnicity
But the law must still allow:
#Native American classes to comply with federal law
#Grouping of classes based on academic performance
#Classes about the history of an ethnic group open to all students
#Classes discussing controversial history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/hb2281s.pdf |title=Arizona House Bill 2281 (2010) |format=PDF |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming off the heels of SB 1070, [[Superintendent of Public Instruction]] Tom Horne was adamant about cutting [[Mexican-American Studies]] in the [[Tucson Unified School District]].  He devised HB 2281 under the belief that the program was teaching "destructive ethnic chauvinism and that Mexican American students are oppressed".&lt;ref&gt;Tom Horne, [http://nau.edu/uploadedFiles/Academic/CAL/Philosophy/Forms/An%20Open%20Letter%20to%20Citizens%20of%20Tucson.pdf "An Open Letter to Citizens of Tucson"], June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2011, Horne reported TUSD to be out of compliance with the law.  In June of that year, the Arizona Education Department paid $110,000 to perform an audit on the [[Mexican American Studies Department Programs, Tucson Unified School District|TUSD's program]], which reported "no observable evidence was present to suggest that any classroom within the [[Tucson Unified School District]] is in direct violation of the law." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/news/election/azelections/articles/2011/06/16/20110616tucson-ethnic-studies-audit0616.html "Tucson ethnic-studies program not illegal, audit says"] The Arizona Republic, June 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Huppenthal]] (elected Superintendent as Horne became [[Attorney General]]) ordered the audit as part of his campaign promise to "Stop La Raza", but when the audit contradicted his own personal findings of noncompliance, he discredited it.  Despite a formal appeal issued on June 22, 2011 by TUSD to Huppenthal, Judge Lewis Kowal backed the Superintendent's decision and ruled the district out of compliance in December, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Billeaud|first=Jacques|title=Ariz schools' ethnic studies program ruled illegal|url=https://news.yahoo.com/ariz-schools-ethnic-studies-program-ruled-illegal-021635252.html|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=December 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 10, 2012 the TUSD board voted to cut the program after Huppenthal threatened to withhold 10% of the district's annual funding.  Numerous books related to the [[Mexican-American Studies]] program were found in violation of the law and have been stored in district storehouses, including Shakespeare's ''[[The Tempest]]'', [[Paolo Freire]]'s ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]'', and Bill Bigelow's ''"Rethinking Columbus: The Next 500 Years''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2012/01/13/whos_afraid_of_the_tempest/ "Who's afraid of 'The Tempest'?"] Salon, January 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of MAS see HB 2281 as another attack on the Hispanic population of Arizona.  This is due partly to the fact that none of the other three ethnic studies programs were cut. Support for the ethnic studies programs subsequently came from scholars, community activist groups, etc. For example, The Curriculum Audit of the Mexican American Studies Department refuted all of the violations under House Bill 2281. The audit instead recommended that the courses be implemented further, given the positive impacts of the courses on the students. In addition to the defense of the ethnic studies department, the UN Charter of Human Rights challenges the bill as a violation of fundamental human, constitutional, and educational rights (Kunnie 2010). A 2011 documentary, [[Precious Knowledge]] directed by Ari Palos and produced by Eren McGinnis for Dos Vatos Productions, argues that while 48% of Hispanic students drop out, TUSD's program had become a model of national success, with 93% of enrolled students graduating and 85% going on to college.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dosvatos.com/films/PreciousKnowledge/more.php "Precious Knowledge"] Dos Vatos Films, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The film shows a 165-mile community run from Tucson to Phoenix in protest of the state's decision, as well as student-led marches and stand-ins. 
In one instance, students overtook a board meeting by chaining themselves to the board members' chairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myfoxphoenix.com/dpp/news/education/students-protest-ethnic-studies-curriculum-change-4-26-11 "Students Protest Ethnic Studies Curriculum Change"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821045758/http://www.myfoxphoenix.com/dpp/news/education/students-protest-ethnic-studies-curriculum-change-4-26-11 |date=August 21, 2011 }} MyFoxPhoenix.com, April 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  A student protest group, UNIDOS (United Non-Discriminatory Individuals Demanding Our Studies), has remained active speaking out before legislators and school board members on behalf of the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tucson12.nytimes-institute.com/12/tucson-school-board-eliminates-mexican-american-studies-program/ "Tucson School Board Eliminates Mexican American Studies Program"] New York Times Student Journalism Institute, January 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate case, two students and 11 teachers sued the state, contending that the law is unconstitutional.  The teachers, however, have been denied standing in the lawsuit as public employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/01/11/42963.htm "Students, Not Teachers, Can Fight Ban on Ethnic Studies"] Courthouse News Service, January 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Appeal of Arizona Ban ===
The Mexican American Studies course was first brought under attack after the Deputy Superintendent of Public Education gave a speech to students, countering an allegation that "Republicans  hate Latinos."&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2015/07/07/13-15657.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The students walked out of the speech, and Tom Horne, the Superintendent, blamed the rudeness of the students on the teachers from their Mexican American Studies courses. He called for removal of the courses. When his call was not answered, he made an effort for a bill to be put into law banning Mexican American Studies courses.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;

House Bill 2281,&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/hb2281s.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which prohibited the Mexican American Studies courses, was approved in December 2010. In an effort to enforce the bill, the district court gave the Superintendent of the school district the right to withhold funding to schools that continue to teach the ethnic studies course.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2011/12/27/judge-upholds-ethnic-studies-decision-orders-money-withheld-from-tusd/|title=Judge upholds ethnic studies decision, orders money withheld from TUSD – Arizona Capitol Times|last=Grado|first=Gary|date=2011-12-27|website=azcapitoltimes.com|publisher=Arizona Capital Times|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Kowal ruled the course “biased, political, and emotionally charged,” and upheld both the bill and the withholding of funding from schools.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

An appeal was filed in October 2010.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; The initial appeal was challenging House Bill 2281&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; for violation of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] (for viewpoint discrimination) and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] (for void-for-vagueness) rights.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; This initial appeal was filed by 10 teachers, the director of the Mexican American Studies program, and 3 students and their parents.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; Once the students graduated, 2 dropped their appeals, and the teachers and program director were dismissed for want of standing in January 2012.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; This left one student and her father on the appeal.

In March 2013, the appeals court ruled only in favor of the plaintiffs on the grounds that there was a First Amendment overbreadth violation to House Bill 2281.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; The plaintiffs decided to further appeal the case.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;

On July 7, 2015, the appeal on the ban of the Mexican American Studies, "''Maya Arce vs Huppenthal''", reached a federal appeals court.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tonydiaz/discrimination-is-the-onl_b_7783704.html|title=Arizona Gets Schooled: Update on Ban of Mexican American Studies|last=Diaz|first=Tony|date=2015-08-11|website=The Huffington Post|publisher=Huffington Post|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overseen by Judge Rakoff, the court reversed part of what the district court had ruled on banning the course. Judge Rakoff looked at the 4 categories (listed above) that constitute which classes are prohibited.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

Rakoff's statement said that House Bill 2281 was created with the Mexican American Studies course in mind.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; Since the Mexican American studies course was the only course in Arizona to be banned, it became clear that the bill had targeted the one course. This led the court to find the bill to be partially unconstitutional as it did not require similar Mexican American Studies courses outside of the Tucson Unified School District to cease teaching the courses. The bill also did not ban African American Studies courses that were being taught.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

Rakoff's final ruling affirmed part of the bill to be unconstitutional regarding the plaintiff's First Amendment right.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; However, Rakoff upheld the district court's ruling that the bill is not overbroad.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; Rakoff sent part of the appeal back to the district court to review the claim that the bill is discriminatory.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

In August 2017, a different federal judge found that the bill was motivated by discriminatory intent, and struck down the ban on ethnic studies as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Depenbrock|first1=Julie|title=Federal Judge Finds Racism Behind Arizona Law Banning Ethnic Studies|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/08/22/545402866/federal-judge-finds-racism-behind-arizona-law-banning-ethnic-studies|website=NPR.org|publisher=NPR|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge felt that the ban had been passed "not for a legitimate educational purpose, but for an invidious discriminatory racial purpose and a politically partisan purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/arizona-cant-ban-mexican-american-studies-anymore-judge-says_us_5a442f28e4b025f99e199496|title=Arizona Can't Ban Mexican-American Studies Anymore, Judge Says|last=Planas|first=Roque|date=2017-12-28|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

'''''Euro-Sinica''''' is a scholarly series, published by the European academic publisher [[Peter Lang (publishing company)|Peter Lang]]. The series focuses primarily on intercultural and transcultural studies, including intellectual history, of Europe and China.

The monograph series was founded by Adrian Hsia, of [[McGill University]], following the first Sino-German symposium on intercultural relations immediately after the opening of China subsequent to the Cultural Revolution. The symposium was co-organized by Hsia and Professor Guenther Debon, University of Heidelberg, and its proceedings entitled ''Goethe und China, China und Goethe'' (1985) were published as volume one of the series. Later on, the prominent Chinese novelist and scholar [[Qian Zhongshu]] wrote the Chinese title of Euro-Sinica in his beautiful calligraphy which constitutes a part of the book cover since volume three. So far, twelve volumes have been published in English, French, and German, covering the three domains mentioned above.

In this series of intellectual probings, the terms "Europe" and "China" are not to be understood geo-politically, but rather culturally. Wherever a European language is used as the official language, such a country is considered to belong to the European cultural group. In a similar vein, wherever Chinese ideograms are used and the tenets of [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Chinese Buddhism]] are followed, these countries are regarded as the Sinic group. Studies on both cultural groups are also included in the monograph series. The third domain of Euro-Sinica constitutes analyses of ethnic Chinese artists and thinkers living in the West.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5095">The '''[[expander graph|expander]] mixing lemma''' states that, for any two [[subsets]] &lt;math&gt;S, T&lt;/math&gt; of a d-regular [[expander graph]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices, the number of edges between &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is approximately what you would expect in a [[random graph|random]] ''d''-[[regular graph]], i.e. &lt;math&gt;d|S| |T| / n&lt;/math&gt;.

==Statement==
Let &lt;math&gt;G = (V, E)&lt;/math&gt; be a ''d''-regular graph on ''n'' vertices with &lt;math&gt;\lambda\in(0,d)&lt;/math&gt; the second-largest eigenvalue (in absolute value) of the adjacency matrix.  For any two subsets &lt;math&gt;S, T \subseteq V&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;e(S, T) = |\{(x,y) \in S \times T : xy \in E(G)\}|&lt;/math&gt; be the number of edges between ''S'' and ''T'' (counting edges contained in the intersection of ''S'' and ''T'' twice).
Then

:&lt;math&gt;\left|e(S, T) - \frac{d |S| |T|}{n}\right| \leq \lambda  \sqrt{|S| |T| (1 - |S|/n)(1 - |T|/n)}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

For [[biregular graph]]s, we have the following variation.&lt;ref&gt;See Theorem 5.1 in "Interlacing Eigenvalues and Graphs" by Haemers&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;G = (L, R, E)&lt;/math&gt; be a bipartite graph such that every vertex in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is adjacent to &lt;math&gt;d_L&lt;/math&gt; vertices of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and every vertex in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is adjacent to &lt;math&gt;d_R&lt;/math&gt; vertices of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;S \subseteq L, T \subseteq R&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|S| = \alpha|L|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|T| = \beta |R|&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;e(G) = |E(G)|&lt;/math&gt;. Then

:&lt;math&gt;\left|\frac{e(S, T)}{e(G)} - \alpha \beta\right| \leq \frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{d_Ld_R}}  \sqrt{\alpha \beta (1 - \alpha) (1 - \beta)} \leq \frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{d_Ld_R}} \sqrt{\alpha \beta}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{d_L d_R}&lt;/math&gt; is the largest absolute value of the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

==Proof==

Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be the adjacency matrix for &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.  For a vertex subset &lt;math&gt;U \subseteq V&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;|U\rangle = \sum_{v \in U} |v\rangle \in \mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.  Here &lt;math&gt;|v\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the standard basis element of    &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; with a one in the &lt;math&gt;v^{th}&lt;/math&gt; position.   Thus in particular &lt;math&gt;A |V\rangle = d |V\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, and the number of edges between &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;E(S, T) = \langle S | A | T \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

Expand each of &lt;math&gt;|S\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|T\rangle&lt;/math&gt; into a component in the direction of the largest-eigenvalue eigenvector &lt;math&gt;|V\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and an orthogonal component:

:&lt;math&gt;|S\rangle = \frac{|S|}{n} |V\rangle + |S'\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|T\rangle = \frac{|T|}{n} |V\rangle + |T'\rangle&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt; \langle S' | V \rangle = \langle T' | V \rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt;. This orthogonality implies that &lt;math&gt;\| | S \rangle \|^2 = \| \frac{|S|}{n} |V\rangle \|^2 + \| |S'\rangle \|^2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\| | T \rangle \|^2 = \| \frac{|T|}{n} |V\rangle \|^2 + \| | T' \rangle \|^2 &lt;/math&gt;. Moreover

:&lt;math&gt;\langle S | A | T \rangle = \frac{|S| |T|}{n^2} \langle V | A | V \rangle + \langle S' | A | T' \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

The conclusion follows, since &lt;math&gt;\langle V | A | V \rangle = d \| |V\rangle \|^2 = d n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;| \langle S' | A | T' \rangle | \leq \| | S' \rangle \| \cdot \|A | T' \rangle \| \leq \lambda \| | S' \rangle \| \| | T' \rangle \|  = \lambda \sqrt{ \| |S \rangle \|^2 - \| \frac{|S|}{n} |V\rangle \|^2 } \sqrt{ \| |T \rangle \|^2 - \| \frac{|T|}{n} |V\rangle \|^2} = \lambda \sqrt{|S|(1 - |S|/n)|T|(1-|T|/n)}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Converse==
Bilu and [[Nati Linial|Linial]] showed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~nati/PAPERS/raman_lift.pdf Expander mixing lemma converse]&lt;/ref&gt; that the converse holds as well: if a graph satisfies the conclusion of the expander mixing lemma, that is, for any two subsets &lt;math&gt;S, T \subseteq V&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;|E(S, T) - \frac{d |S| |T|}{n}| \leq d \lambda \sqrt{|S| |T|}&lt;/math&gt;

then its second-largest eigenvalue is &lt;math&gt;O(d \lambda (1+\log(1/\lambda)))&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="962">An '''extension agency''' is an organisation that practises [[Extension (semantics)|extension]], in the context of [[community development]]. An example is the ''[[Cooperative Extension Service]]'', which aims to assist individuals or groups in defining and achieving their goals in rural communities in the USA.
 
'''Extension agents''' are trained in the skills of extension, such as communication and group facilitation, and usually in technical areas of the sector they serve (for example agriculture, health, or safety). [[Agricultural extension]] agencies promote more profitable and sustainable farming, while '''health extension''' agencies promote improved health. 

Extension agents are represented by '''professional organisations''' such as the [http://www.apen.org.au/ Australasia-Pacific Extension Network] and publish in journals such as the [http://www.joe.org/ Journal of Extension].

[[File:Edinburgh Donaldson College dsc06377.jpg|thumb|150px|Donaldson's College]]

==Background==
In the mid 19th century Britain faced reduced timber supplies from the Indian sub-continent&lt;ref name="oost" /&gt; (then [[British India]]) and had turned, under guidance from [[Hugh Cleghorn (forester)|Cleghorn]] towards increased professionalism in forestry at home, and in India. In the late 19th century with Scotland, now established as the British centre for forestry &lt;ref name="oost" /&gt; and successful forestry education in established in [[Dehradun]] this fair was held. Countries and colonies were being invited to produce papers and exhibit products for judgment by British and Indian officials.&lt;ref name="nature2"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v30/n771/abs/030337a0.html|title=The Forestry Exhibition |accessdate=10 March 2012 | volume=30|doi=10.1038/030337a0|journal=Nature|pages=337–338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants (in addition to the [[British India|India]] and hosts [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]) included [[Cape Colony]], [[India]]&lt;ref name="princebook"&gt;{{cite book|title=Prince, Princess and People. An account of the social progress and development of our own times, as illustrated by the life and work of their royal highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales 1863-1889|author=Henry C Burdett|page= 301}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Poland. [[Chile]] was invited but did not attend due to "an unforeseen accident".&lt;ref name="nature1" /&gt;

==Exhibits==
[[File:Apodytes dimidiata tree Cape Town 7.jpg|75px|thumb|right|[[Apodytes dimidiata]]]]
Exhibits included [[Sussex trug|trugs]],&lt;ref name="trugfair"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenchronicle.com/garden_trugs2.htm|title=Sussex Garden Trug|accessdate=10 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319214644/http://www.greenchronicle.com/garden_trugs2.htm|archivedate=19 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; maps and publications from participating countries,&lt;ref name="nature1" /&gt; a fallen [[fir]] with [[Erica|heath]] growing on it and a fountain.

Plants exhibited included [[Buxus sempervirens|boxwood]] and variants, and the southern African white pear,  ''[[Apodytes dimidiata]]'' (which was mislabelled as ''Pterocelastrus rostratus''&lt;ref name="easyerror"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plantzafrica.com/plantab/apodytesdim.htm|title=Apodytes dimidiata|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Visitors==
The, then, [[Edward VII|Prince]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]] visited on 22 &lt;ref name=edinhist /&gt; or 2&lt;ref name="princebook"/&gt; August where they inspected exhibits from colonies and dependencies noting fine wood from [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]] and [[Nicobar Islands|Nicobar]].

[[R. A. Cross, 1st Viscount Cross|R.A.Cross]], [[Secretary of State for India]] presented wood from [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]]&lt;ref name="maceUoE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.general-council.ed.ac.uk/system/files/GC%20Mace.pdf|title=THE GENERAL COUNCIL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MACE|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the exhibition.

==Legacy==
The wood presented by R.A.Cross ([[#Visitors|above]]) passed to the Department of Forestry and Natural Resources, [[University of Edinburgh]], and then to the university's general council who used it to make their [[Ceremonial mace|ceremonial mace's]] shaft.&lt;ref name="maceUoE" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2446">A '''geoxyle''' is a plant in which an enlarged, woody structure occurs beneath the surface of the ground. Such plants have developed independently in various plant lineages, mostly evolving in the [[Pliocene]] and subsequently diverging within the last two million years. In contrast to their close relatives, these plants have developed in areas with both high rainfall and a high frequency of fires. They are sometimes known as '''underground trees''', and the areas where they grow as '''underground forests'''.&lt;ref name=Maurin&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Maurin, O. |author2=Davies, T.J. |author3=Burrows, J.E. |author4=Daru, B.H. |author5=Yessoufou, K. |author6=Muasya, A.M. |author7=van der Bank, M. |author8=Bond, W.J. |year=2014 |title=Savanna fire and the origins of the 'underground forests' of Africa |journal=New Phytologist |volume=204 |issue=1 |pages=201–214 |doi=10.1111/nph.12936 |pmid=25039765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geoxylic growth forms of woody [[subshrub]]s is characterised by massive [[lignotuber]]s or underground woody [[Glossary of botanical terms#Axis|axes]] from which emerge aerial shoots which may be ephemeral. These growth forms are found in [[savanna]]hs in southern Africa. It is thought they developed in tandem with the spread of savannahs which resulted in an increase in tall grasses which are easily flammable during the long dry season associated with the savannah climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pennington, R. Toby |author2=Hughes, Colin E. |year=2014 |title=The remarkable congruence of New and Old World savanna origins |journal=New Phytologist |volume=204 |issue=1 |pages= 4–6|url=https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/wiley/the-remarkable-congruence-of-new-and-old-world-savanna-origins-lkrd4GEq8U |doi=10.1111/nph.12996 |pmid=25154641}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some well-known examples of geoxyles are the sand apple (''[[Parinari capensis]]''), the plough-breaker (''[[Erythrina zeyheri]]''), the red wings (''[[Combretum platypetalum]]'') and the wild grape (''[[Lannea edulis]]'').&lt;ref name=Maurin/&gt;  Others are ''[[Ancylobotrys petersiana]]'', ''[[Diospyros galpinii]]'', ''[[Elephantorrhiza elephantina]]'', ''[[Eugenia albanensis]]'', ''[[Eugenia capensis]]'', ''[[Maytenus nemorosa]]'', ''[[Pachystigma venosum]]''  and ''[[Salacia kraussii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcjournal.org/index.php/ABC/article/viewFile/77/77&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Human Race Machine''' (HRM) is a [[computer graphics|computerized]] [[System console|console]] composed of four different programs. The Human Race Machine program allows participants to see themselves with the facial characteristics of six different [[racial group|races]]: [[Asian people|Asian]], [[White people|White]], [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]], [[Middle Eastern]], and [[India]]n, mapped onto their own face.  The Age Machine allows viewers see an aged version of his or her face. A version of this methodology has been used for over twenty years by the [[FBI]] and the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] to help locate kidnap victims and missing children. The Couples Machine combines photographs of two people in different percentages to show the appearance of their child. The Anomaly Machine lets viewers see themselves with facial anomalies. The HRM was created by [[artist]] [[Nancy Burson]] and David Kramlich; it uses [[morphing]] technology.  It was shown on [[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]] on 2006-02-16.

In [[anthropology]] and [[demography]], the '''human [[sex ratio]]''' is the [[ratio]] of [[male]]s to [[female]]s in a [[population]]. More data is available for humans than for any other species, and the human sex ratio is more studied than that of any other species, but interpreting these statistics can be difficult.

Like most sexual species, the sex ratio in humans is approximately 1:1. Due to higher female fetal mortality,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orzack|first=Steven Hecht|last2=Stubblefield|first2=J.

Human sex ratios, either at birth or in the population as a whole, are reported in any of four ways: the ratio of males to females, the ratio of females to males, the proportion of males, or the proportion of females. If there are 108,000 males and 100,000 females the ratio of males to females is 1.080 and the proportion of males is 51.9%. Scientific literature often uses the proportion of males. This article uses the ratio of males to females, unless specified otherwise.

== Natural ratio ==
[[File:2012 Birth Sex Ratio World Map.jpg|thumb|300px|World map of birth sex ratios, 2012]]
In a study around 2002, the natural sex ratio at birth was estimated to be close to 1.06 males/female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Unexplained differences in sex ratios at birth in Europe and North America | pmc=102777 | pmid=11976243 |year=2002 |last1=Grech |first1=V |last2=Savona-Ventura |first2=C |last3=Vassallo-Agius |first3=P |volume=324 |issue=7344 |pages=1010–1 |journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.) | doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7344.1010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars suggest that countries considered to have significant practices of prenatal sex-selection are those with birth sex ratios of 108 and above (selection against females) and 102 and below (selection against males). This assumption has been questioned by some scholars.&lt;ref name=James-JournalofEndocrinology /&gt;

Infant mortality is higher in boys than girls in most parts of the world. This has been explained by sex differences in genetic and biological makeup, with boys being biologically weaker and more susceptible to diseases and premature death.&lt;ref&gt;Demography. 2013 Apr;50(2):421-44. {{doi|10.1007/s13524-012-0161-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have found that numerous preconception or prenatal environmental factors affect the probability of a baby being conceived male or female. It has been proposed that these environmental factors also explain sex differences in mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pongou|first1=Roland|title=Why Is Infant Mortality Higher in Boys Than in Girls?

For example, in the United States, as of 2006, an adult non-elderly male is 3 to 6 times more likely to become a victim of a homicide and 2.5 to 3.5 times more likely to die in an accident than a female of the same age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality/gmwk291r.htm|title=Death Rates for 113 Selected Causes by 5-Year Age Groups, Race, and Sex: the United States, 1999–2006|work=cdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the sex ratio tends to reduce as age increases and among the elderly, there is usually a greater proportion of females. For example, the male to female ratio falls from 1.05 for the group aged 15 to 65 to 0.70 for the group over 65 in [[Demographics of Germany|Germany]], from 1.00 to 0.72 in [[Demographics of the United States|the United States]], from 1.06 to 0.91 in mainland [[People's Republic of China|China]], and from 1.07 to 1.02 in India.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

In the United States, the sex ratios at birth over the period 1970–2002 were 1.05 for the white non-Hispanic population, 1.04 for Mexican Americans, 1.03 for African Americans and Indians, and 1.07 for mothers of Chinese or Filipino ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Matthews TJ, etal |title=Trend Analysis of the Sex Ratio at Birth in the United States |journal=National Vital Statistics Reports |volume=53 |issue=20 |date=June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among Western European countries c. 2001, the ratios ranged from 1.04 in Belgium to 1.07 in Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sex ratio in Switzerland|url=http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/en/index/themen/00/01/blank/02.html | publisher=Switzerland Federal Statistics Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UN Sex Ratio Statistics|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/unpop.htm|publisher=United Nations Population Division}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex ratio at birth (per 100 female newborn)|url=http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=sex+ratio+birth&amp;d=PopDiv&amp;f=variableID%3a52|publisher=United Nations Data Division}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Portugal.

There is controversy whether  sex ratios outside the 103-107 range are due to sex-selection, as suggested by some scholars, or due to natural causes. Some scholars argue that strong socioeconomic factors such as the [[dowry system in India]] and the [[one child policy]] of China are responsible for prenatal sex-selection. In a widely cited article,&lt;ref name= Sen1990&gt;Sen, Amartya (1990), More than 100 million women are missing, New York Review of Books, 20 December, pp. 61–66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amartya Sen]] supported such views. Other researchers argue that an unbalanced sex ratio should not be automatically held as evidence of prenatal sex-selection; Michel Garenne reports that many African nations have, over decades, witnessed birth sex ratios below 100, that is more girls are born than boys.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Garenne, Southern African Journal of Demography, Vol. 9, No. 1 (June 2004), pp. 91-96&lt;/ref&gt; Angola, Botswana and Namibia have reported birth sex ratios between 94 and 99, which is quite different than the presumed "normal" sex ratio, meaning that significantly more girls have been born in such societies.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Garenne, Southern African Journal of Demography, Vol. 9, No. 1 (June 2004), page 95&lt;/ref&gt;

In an extensive study, carried out around 2005, of sex ratio at birth in the United States from 1940 over 62 years, statistical evidence suggested the following:&lt;ref name=NCHS&gt;{{cite web|title=Trend Analysis of the Sex Ratio at Birth in the United States|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr53/nvsr53_20.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Center for Health Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*For mothers having their first baby, the total sex ratio at birth was 1.06 overall, with some years at 1.07.
*For mothers having babies after the first, this ratio consistently decreased with each additional baby from 1.06 towards 1.03.
*The age of the mother affected the ratio:
**the overall ratio was 1.05 for mothers aged 25 to 35 at the time of birth
**mothers who were below the age of 15 or above 40 had babies with a sex ratio ranging between 0.94 and 1.11, and a total sex ratio of 1.04

== Factors affecting sex ratio in humans ==

=== Fisher's principle ===
{{Main|Fisher's principle}}

Fisher's principle is an explanation of why the sex ratio of most species is approximately 1:1. Outlined by [[Ronald Fisher]] in his 1930 book, it is an argument in terms of parental expenditure. Essentially he argues that the 1:1 ratio is the evolutionarily stable strategy.

=== Natural factors ===
The natural factors that affect the human sex ratio are an active area of scientific research. Over 1000 articles have been published in various journals. Two of the often cited reviews of scientific studies on human sex ratio are by W. H. James.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= James WH|year= 1987|title= The human sex ratio. Part 1: A review of the literature|journal= Human Biology|volume= 59|issue= 5 |pages= 721–752|pmid= 3319883|url= http://bases.bireme.br/cgi-bin/wxislind.exe/iah/online/?IsisScript=iah/iah.xis&amp;nextAction=lnk&amp;base=MEDLINE&amp;exprSearch=3319883&amp;indexSearch=UI&amp;lang=i}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= James WH|year= 1987|title= The human sex ratio. Part 2: A hypothesis and a program of research|journal= Human Biology|volume= 59|issue= 6 |pages= 873–900|pmid= 3327803|url= http://bases.bireme.br/cgi-bin/wxislind.exe/iah/online/?IsisScript=iah/iah.xis&amp;nextAction=lnk&amp;base=MEDLINE&amp;exprSearch=3319883&amp;indexSearch=UI&amp;lang=i}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific studies are based on extensive birth and death records in Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australia, and Europe. A few of these studies extend to over 100 years of yearly human sex ratio data for some countries. These studies suggest that the human sex ratio, both at birth and as a population matures, can vary significantly according to a large number of factors, such as paternal age, maternal age, plural birth, birth order, gestation weeks, race, parent's health history, and parent's psychological stress. Remarkably, the trends in human sex ratio are not consistent across countries at a given time, or over time for a given country. In economically developed countries, as well as developing countries, these scientific studies have found that the human sex ratio at birth has historically varied between 0.94 and 1.15 for natural reasons.

In a scientific paper published in 2008,&lt;ref name=James-JournalofEndocrinology /&gt; James states that conventional assumptions have been:
*there are equal numbers of X and Y chromosomes in mammalian sperm
*X and Y stand equal chance of achieving conception
*therefore equal number of male and female zygotes are formed, and that
*therefore any variation of sex ratio at birth is due to sex selection between conception and birth.

James cautions that available scientific evidence stands against the above assumptions and conclusions. He reports that there is an excess of males at birth in almost all human populations, and the natural sex ratio at birth is usually between 1.02 and 1.08. However the ratio may deviate significantly from this range for natural reasons.

A 1999 scientific paper published by Jacobsen reported the sex ratio for 815,891 children born in Denmark between 1980–1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year= 1999|title= Natural variation in the human sex ratio|journal= Human Reproduction|volume= 14|issue= 12 |pages= 3120–3125|doi= 10.1093/humrep/14.12.3120| pmid= 10601107|author1= Jacobsen|first1= R|last2= Møller|first2= H|last3= Mouritsen|first3= A}}&lt;/ref&gt; They studied the birth records to identify the effects of multiple birth, birth order, age of parents and the sexes of preceding siblings on the proportion of males using contingency tables, [[chi-squared test]]s and regression analysis. The secondary sex ratio decreased with increased number of children per plural birth and with paternal age, whereas no significant independent effect was observed for maternal age, birth order, or other natural factors.

A 2009 research paper published by Branum et al. reports the sex ratio derived from data in United States birth records over a 25-year period (1981–2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year= 2009|title= Trends in US sex ratio by pluraity, gestational age and race/ethinicity |journal= Reproductive Epidemiology|volume= 24|issue= 11 |pages= 2936–2944 (see p. 2941 Figure 2)|doi= 10.1093/humrep/dep255|last1= Branum |first1= A. M. |last2= Parker |first2= J. D. |last3= Schoendorf |first3= K. C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper reports that the sex ratio at birth for the white ethnic group in the United States was 1.04 when the gestational age was 33–36 weeks, but 1.15 for gestational ages of less than 28 weeks, 28–32 weeks, and 37 or more weeks. This study also found that the sex ratios at birth in the United States, between 1981–2006, were lower in both black and Hispanic ethnic groups when compared with white ethnic group.

The relationship between natural factors and human sex ratio at birth, and with aging, remains an active area of scientific research.

=== Environmental factors ===
==== Effects of climate change ====
Various scientists have examined the question whether human birth sex ratios have historically been affected by environmental stressors such as climate change and global warming. Catalano et al. report that cold weather is an environmental stressor, and women subjected to colder weather abort frail male fetuses in greater proportion thereby lowering birth sex ratios. Cold weather stressors simultaneously extend male longevity thereby raise human sex ratio in its older age bracket.&lt;ref name=Catalano /&gt; Catalano team finds that a 1&amp;nbsp;°C increase in annual temperature predicts one more male than expected for every 1,000 females born in a year.

Helle et al. have studied 138 years worth of human birth sex ratio data, from 1865 to 2003. They find an increased excess of male births during periods of the exogenous stress (World War II) and during warm years. In the warmest period over the 138 years, the birth sex ratio peaked at about 1.08 in northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Animal Ecology|volume=78|issue=6|pages=1226–1233|date=November 2009|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01598.x|title=Evolutionary ecology of human birth sex ratio under the compound influence of climate change, famine, economic crises and wars|last1=Helle|first1=Samuli|last2=Helama|first2=Samuli|last3=Lertola|first3=Kalle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Effects of gestation environment ====
Causes of stress during gestation, such as maternal malnutrition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Andersson R, Bergström S |title=Is maternal malnutrition associated with a low sex ratio at birth? |journal=Hum. Biol. |volume=70 |issue=6 |pages=1101–6 |date=December 1998 |pmid=9825599 }}&lt;/ref&gt; generally appear to increase fetal deaths particularly among males,&lt;ref name=Catalano&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Catalano R, Bruckner T, Smith KR |title=Ambient temperature predicts sex ratios and male longevity |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=105 |issue=6 |pages=2244–7 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18250336 |pmc=2538905 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0710711104 |bibcode=2008PNAS..105.2244C }}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a lower boy to girl ratio at birth. Also, higher incidence of [[Hepatitis B]] virus in populations is believed to increase the male to female sex ratio, while some unexplained environmental health hazards are thought to have the opposite effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Davis DL, Gottlieb MB, Stampnitzky JR |title=Reduced ratio of male to female births in several industrial countries: a sentinel health indicator? |journal=JAMA |volume=279 |issue=13 |pages=1018–23 |date=April 1998 |pmid=9533502|doi=10.1001/jama.279.13.1018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of gestational environment on human sex ratio are complicated and unclear, with numerous conflicting reports. For example, Oster et al. examined a data set of 67,000 births in China, 15 percent of whom were Hepatitis B carriers. They found no effect on birth sex ratio from Hepatitis B presence in either the mothers or fathers.&lt;ref name="revision"&gt;{{cite web | last=Oster | first=Emily |authorlink=Emily Oster | last2=Chen | first2=Gang | last3=Yu | first3=Xinsen | last4=Lin | first4=Wenyao | title=Hepatitis B Does Not Explain Male-Biased Sex Ratios in China | year=2008 | url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~eoster/hbvnotecon.pdf | accessdate=19 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Effects of chemical pollution ====
A 2007 survey by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program noted abnormally low sex ratios &lt;!-- in which direction? --&gt; in Russian Arctic villages and [[Inuit]] villages in [[Greenland]] and [[Canada]], and attributed this imbalance to high levels of [[endocrine disruptor]]s in the blood of inhabitants, including [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] and [[DDT]]. These chemicals are believed to have accumulated in the tissues of fish and animals that make up the bulk of these populations' diets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/gender/story/0,,2167005,00.html Man-made chemicals blamed many more girls than boys are born in Arctic], The Guardian, 12 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as noted in the [[#Social factors|Social factors]] section below, it is important to exclude alternative explanations, including social ones, when examining large human populations whose composition by ethnicity and race may be changing.

A 2008 report provides further evidence of effects of [[xenoestrogens|feminizing chemicals]] on male development in each class of [[vertebrate]] species as a worldwide phenomenon, possibly leading to a decline in the sex ratio in humans and a possible decline in [[sperm]] counts.&lt;ref name=indepen /&gt; Out of over 100,000 recently introduced chemicals, 99% are poorly regulated.&lt;ref name=indepen&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/its-official-men-really-are-the-weaker-sex-1055688.html | title=It's official: Men really are the weaker sex | work=[[The Independent]] | author=Lean, Geoffrey  | date=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other factors that could possibly affect the sex ratio include:
* Social status of the mother, known to be a factor in influencing the sex ratio of certain animals such as swine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mendl M, Zanella AJ, Broom DM, Whittemore CT |title=Maternal social status and birth sex ratio in domestic pigs: an analysis of mechanisms |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=1361–70 |year=1995 |doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)80051-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but apparently not in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ellis L, Bonin S |title=Social status and the secondary sex ratio: new evidence on a lingering controversy |journal=Soc Biol |volume=49 |issue=1–2 |pages=35–43 |year=2002 |pmid=14652908 |doi=10.1080/19485565.2002.9989047}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Whether the mother smokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mills JL, England L, Granath F, Cnattingius S |title=Cigarette smoking and the male-female sex ratio |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume=79 |issue=5 |pages=1243–5 |date=May 2003 |pmid=12738529 |doi=10.1016/S0015-0282(03)00156-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Whether the mother has a partner or other support network,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Norberg, Karen |title=Partnership Status and the Human Sex Ratio at Birth |series=NBER Working Paper Series |id=w10920 |date=November 2004 |ssrn=622634}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this correlation is widely considered{{by whom|date=January 2013}} to be the result of an unknown third factor.
*[[Latitude]], with countries near the equator producing more females than near the poles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Navara KJ |title=Humans at tropical latitudes produce more females |journal=Biol. Lett. |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=524–7 |date=August 2009 |pmid=19364717 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.0069|pmc=2781905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scientific studies suggest that environmental effects on human sex ratio at birth are either limited or not properly understood. For example, a research paper published in 1999, by scientists from Finland’s National Public Health Institute, reports the effect of environmental chemicals and changes in sex ratio over 250 years in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year= 1999|title= Environmental chemicals and changes in sex ratio: analysis over 250 years in finland|journal= Environmental Health Perspectives|volume= 107|issue= 10 |pages= 813–815|pmid= 10504147 |pmc= 1566625 | doi= 10.1289/ehp.99107813|author1= Vartiainen|first1= T|last2= Kartovaara|first2= L|last3= Tuomisto|first3= J}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scientific team evaluated whether Finnish long-term data are compatible with the hypothesis that the decrease in the ratio of male to female births in industrial countries is caused by environmental factors. They analyzed the sex ratio of births from the files of Statistics Finland and all live births in Finland from 1751 to 1997. They found an increase in the proportion of males from 1751 to 1920; this was followed by a decrease and interrupted by peaks in births of males during and after World War I and World War II. None of the natural factors such as paternal age, maternal age, age difference of parents, birth order could explain the time trends. The scientists found that the peak ratio of male proportion precedes the period of industrialization or the introduction of pesticides or hormonal drugs, rendering a causal association between environmental chemicals and human sex ratio at birth unlikely. Moreover, these scientists claim that the trends they found in Finland are similar to those observed in other countries with worse pollution and much greater pesticide use.

=== Social factors ===
[[Sex-selective abortion]] and [[infanticide]] are thought to significantly skew the naturally occurring ratio in some populations, such as China, where the introduction of ultrasound scans in the late 1980s has led to a birth sex ratio (males to females) of 1.181 (2010 official census data for China).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-08/16/c_131052436.htm China's sex ratio declines for two straight years] Xinhua, China (16 August 2011) – "Li Bin, director of the National Population and Family Planning Commission, made the remarks at a press conference (...). China's sex ratio at birth was 118.08 males for every 100 females in 2010, according to census data, Li said."&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 India census reports India's sex ratio in 0–6 age bracket at 1.088.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census2011.co.in/p/glance.php India at Glance – Population Census 2011 – Final] Census of India, Government of India (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 birth sex ratios for China and India are significantly above the mean ratio recorded in the United States from 1940 through 2002 (1.051); however, their birth sex ratios are within the 0.98–1.14 range observed in the United States for significant ethnic groups over the same time period.&lt;ref name=NCHS /&gt;{{rp|10}} Along with Asian countries, a number of European, Middle East, and Latin American countries have recently reported high birth sex ratios in the 1.06 to 1.14 range. High birth sex ratios, some claim, may be caused in part by social factors.

Reported sex ratios at birth, outside the typical range of 1.03 to 1.07, thus call for an explanation of some kind.

Another hypothesis has been inspired by the recent and persistent high birth sex ratios observed in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Armenia]]—both predominantly Orthodox Christian societies—and [[Azerbaijan]], a predominantly Muslim society. Since their independence from Soviet Union, the birth sex ratio in these Caucasus countries has risen sharply to between 1.11 and 1.20, some of world's highest. Mesle et al. consider the hypothesis that the high birth sex ratio may be because of the social trend of more than two children per family, and birth order possibly affects the sex ratio in this region of the world. They also consider the hypothesis that sons are preferred in these countries of the Caucasus, the spread of scans and there being a practice of sex-selective abortion; however, the scientists admit that they do not have definitive proof that sex-selective abortion is actually happening or that there are no natural reasons for the persistently high birth sex ratios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Sharp Increase in Sex Ratio at Birth in the Caucasus.

As an example of how the social composition of a human population may produce unusual changes in sex ratios, in a study in several counties of California where declining sex ratios had been observed, Smith and Von Behren observe "In the raw data, the male birth proportion is indeed declining. However, during this period, there were also shifts in demographics that influence the sex ratio. Controlling for birth order, parents' age, and race/ethnicity, different trends emerged. White births (which account for over 80%) continued to show a statistically significant decline, while other racial groups showed non-statistically significant declines (Japanese, Native American, other), little or no change (black), or an increase (Chinese). Finally, when the white births were divided into Hispanic and non-Hispanic (possible since 1982), it was found that both white subgroups suggest an increase in male births."  They concluded, "that the decline in male births in California is largely attributable to changes in demographics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith D, Von Behren J |title=Trends in the sex ratio of California births, 1960–1996 |journal=J Epidemiol Community Health |volume=59 |issue=12 |pages=1047–53 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16286492 |pmc=1732975 |doi=10.1136/jech.2005.036970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Early marriage and parents' age ====
Several studies have examined human birth sex ratio data to determine if there is a natural relationship between the age of mother or father to the birth sex ratio. For example, Ruder has studied 1.67 million births in 33 states in the United States to discern effect of parent's age and birth sex ratios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Paternal-Age and Birth-Order Effect on the Human Secondary Sex Ratio|author=Ruder, Avima |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=37|pages=362–372|year=1985f|pmc=1684568|pmid=3985011|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Jacobsen et al. have studied 0.82 million births in Denmark with the same goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Natural Variation in the Human Sex Ratio|author=Jacobsen|journal=Human Reproduction|volume=14|issue=12|pages=3120–3125|year=1999|doi=10.1093/humrep/14.12.3120|pmid=10601107|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scientists find that maternal age has no statistically significant role on human birth sex ratio. However, they report a significant effect of paternal age. Significantly more male babies were born per 1000 female babies to younger fathers than to older fathers. These studies suggest that social factors such as [[Child marriage|early marriage]] and quickly fertile couples may play a role in raising birth sex ratios in certain societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Studies in The Human Sex Ratio 5.

E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Data sources and data quality issues ====
Reported sex ratios at birth for some human populations may be influenced not only by cultural preferences and social practices that favor the birth or survival of one sex over the other but also by incomplete or inaccurate reporting or recording of the births or the survival of infants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Even what constitutes a [[live birth (human)|live birth]] or [[infant mortality|infant death]] may vary from one population to another. For example, for most of the 20th century in Russia (and the [[Soviet Union]]), extremely premature newborns (less than 28 weeks gestational age, or less than 1000&amp;nbsp;grams in weight, or less than 35 centimeters in length) were not counted as a live birth until they had survived 7 days; and if that infant died in those first 168 hours it would not be counted as an infant death. This led to serious underreporting of the [[Infant mortality rate]] (by 22% to 25%) relative to standards recommended by the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=Barbara A. |first2=Brian D. |last2=Silver |title=Infant Mortality in the Soviet Union: Regional Differences and Measurement Issues |journal=Population and Development Review |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=705–37 |year=1986 |doi=10.2307/1973432 |jstor=1973432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When unusual sex ratios at birth (or any other age) are observed, it is important to consider misreporting, misrecording, or under registration of births or deaths as possible reasons. Some researchers have in part attributed the high male to female sex ratios reported in [[mainland China]] in the last 25 years to the underreporting of the births of female children after the implementation of the [[one-child policy]], though alternative explanations are now generally more widely accepted, including above all the use of ultrasound technology and [[sex-selective abortion]] of female fetuses and, probably to a more limited degree, neglect or in some cases [[infanticide]] of females. In the case of China, because of deficiencies in the [[vital signs|vital statistics]] registration system, studies of sex ratios at birth have relied either on special fertility surveys, whose accuracy depends on full reporting of births and survival of both male and female infants, or on the national [[population census]] from which both birth rates and death rates are calculated from the household's reporting of births and deaths in the 18 months preceding the census.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the number of births reported to family planning and other administrative agencies has been significantly lower than the number determined in population surveys and the census. See Zhang, Guangyu (April 2004) [http://paa2004.princeton.edu/papers/40283 "Very Low Fertility in China in the 1990s: Reality or An Illusion Arising from Birth Underreporting?"] Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Population Association of America.&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent that this underreporting of births or deaths is sex-selective, both fertility surveys and censuses may inaccurately reflect the actual sex ratios at birth.&lt;ref&gt;For studies reveal underreporting or delayed reporting of female births in China, see {{cite journal |vauthors=Merli MG, Raftery AE |title=Are births underreported in rural China?

=== Economic factors ===
Catalano has examined the hypothesis that population stress induced by a declining economy reduces the human sex ratio. He compared the sex ratio in East and West Germany for the years 1946 to 1999, with genetically similar populations. The population stressors theory predicts that the East German sex ratio should have been lower in 1991 when East Germany's economy collapsed than expected from its previous years. Furthermore, the theory suggests that East German birth sex ratios should generally be lower than the observed sex ratio in West Germany for the same years, over time. According to Catalano's study, the birth sex ratio data from East Germany and West Germany over 45 years support the hypothesis. The sex ratio in East Germany was also at its lowest in 1991. According to Catalano study, assuming women in East Germany did not opt to abort male more than female, the best hypothesis is that a collapsing economy lowers the human birth sex ratio, while a booming economy raises the birth sex ratio. Catalano notes that these trends may be related to the observed trend of elevated incidences of very low birth weight from maternal stress, during certain macroeconomic circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sex ratios in the two Germanies: a test of the economic stress hypothesis|author=Catalano, Ralph |journal=Human Reproduction| volume=18|issue=9|pages=1972–1975|year=2003|doi=10.1093/humrep/deg370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other gestational factors ===
A research group led by Ein-Mor reported that sex ratio does not seem to change significantly with either maternal or paternal age. Neither [[gravidity]] nor [[parity (medicine)|parity]] seem to affect the male-to-female ratio.&lt;ref name=Ein-Mor /&gt; However, there is a significant association of sex ratio with the length of gestation.&lt;ref name=Ein-Mor&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ein-Mor E, Mankuta D, Hochner-Celnikier D, Hurwitz A, Haimov-Kochman R |title=Sex ratio is remarkably constant |journal=Fertil.

For example, James suggested&lt;ref name=James-FertilSterilJournal&gt;{{cite journal |author=James W.H.|title=The Inconstancy of Human Sex Ratios at Birth |journal=Fertil.

In another study, James has offered the hypothesis that human sex ratios, and mammalian sex ratios in general, are causally related to the hormone levels of both parents at the time of conception.&lt;ref name=James-JournalofEndocrinology&gt;{{cite journal|author=James W.H.|title=Hypothesis:Evidence that Mammalian Sex Ratios at birth are partially controlled by parental hormonal levels around the time of conception|journal=Journal of Endocrinology|volume=198|pages=3–15|date=July 2008|doi= 10.1677/JOE-07-0446|issue=1|pmid=18577567}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is yet to be tested and proven true or false over large population sets.

==Gender imbalance==

Gender imbalance is a disparity between males and females in a population. As stated above, males usually exceed females at birth but subsequently experience different mortality rates due to many possible causes such as differential natural death rates, war casualties, and deliberate gender control.

According to Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn, two Pulitzer Prize-winning reporters for the ''[[New York Times]]'', violence against women is causing gender imbalances in many developing countries.&lt;ref name="Kristof"&gt;Kristof, Nicholas and Sheryl WuDunn. ''Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunities for Women Worldwide.'' Knopf, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-307-26714-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They detail sex-selective [[infanticide]] in the developing world, particularly in China, India and Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Kristof" /&gt;

Commonly, countries with gender imbalances have three characteristics in common. The first is a rapid decline in fertility, either because of preference for smaller families or to comply with their nation's population control measures. Second, there is pressure for women to give birth to sons, often because of cultural preferences for male heirs. Third, families have widespread access to technology to selectively abort female fetuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Single Man: One Chinese Bachelor's Search for Love|date=15 November 2011|author1=Jian Lee, Deborah  |author2=Subramanian, Sushma 
|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/china-gao-po-bachelor-women-marriage-economy|publisher=Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a contributing measure to gender imbalance in developing countries, Kristof and WuDunn's&lt;ref name=Kristof /&gt; best estimate is that a girl in India, from 1 to 5 years of age, dies from discrimination every four minutes (132,000 deaths per year); that 39,000 girls in China die annually, within the first year of life, because parents did not give girls the same medical care and attention that boys received. The authors describe similar gender discrimination and gendercide in Congo, Kenya, Pakistan, Iraq, Bahrain, Thailand and many other developing countries.

Some of the factors suggested as causes of the gender imbalance are [[war]]fare (excess of females, notably in the wake of [[World War I casualties|WWI]] in western Europe, and [[World War II casualties|WWII]], particularly in [[Demographics of the Soviet Union|the Soviet Union]]); [[Sex-selective abortion|sex-selective abortion and infanticide]] (excess of males, notably in [[Demographics of China|China]] as a result of the [[one-child policy]], or in [[Demographics of India|India]]); and large-scale migration, such as that by male labourers unable to bring their families with them (as in [[Qatar]] and other Gulf countries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://qz.com/335183/heres-why-men-on-earth-outnumber-women-by-60-million/|title = A story of drinkers, genocide and unborn girls|last = Bauer|first = David|date = January 2015|publisher = Quartz}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Gender imbalance may result in the threat of social unrest, especially in the case of an excess of low-status young males unable to find spouses,&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerie M. Hudson|Hudson, Valerie M.]] and den Boer, Andrea M. (2004) ''Bare Branches: The Security Implications of Asia's Surplus Male Population''. The MIT Press. {{ISBN|0262582643}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and being recruited into the service of militaristic political factions. [[Economic]] factors such as male-majority industries and activities like the [[petrochemical]], [[agriculture]], [[engineering]], [[military]], and [[technology]] also have created a male gender imbalance in some areas dependent on one of these industries. Conversely, the [[entertainment]], [[banking]], [[tourism]], [[fashion]], and [[Customer service|service]] industries may have resulted in a female-majority gender imbalance in some areas dependent on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/03/30/a_singles_map_of_the_united_states_of_america/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=A singles map of the United States of America | first=Richard | last=Florida | date=30 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Michael |last1=Kvasnicka |first2=Dirk |last2=Bethmann |title=World War II, Missing Men, and out-of-wedlock childbearing |id=07-30 |publisher=The Institute of Economic Research, Korea University |date=1 October 2007 |url=http://econ.korea.ac.kr/~ri/WorkingPapers/W0730.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the male-to-female sex ratio in the German state of Bavaria fell as low as 0.60 after the end of [[World War II]] for the most severely affected age cohort (those between 21 and 23 years old in 1946). This same study found that out-of-wedlock births spiked from approximately 10–15% during the inter-war years up to 22% at the end of the war. This increase in out-of-wedlock births was attributed to a change in the marriage market caused by the decline in the sex ratio.

[[File:Pyramide Estonie.PNG|thumb|left|Gender imbalance in [[Estonia]]]]The [[Northern Mariana Islands]] have the highest female ratio with 0.77 males per female. [[Qatar]] has the highest male ratio, with 2.87 males/female. For the group aged below 15, [[Sierra Leone]] has the highest female ratio with 0.96 males/female, and the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] are tied for the highest male ratio with 1.13 males/female (according to the 2006 [[CIA World Factbook]]).

The value for the entire [[world population]] is 1.01 males/female, with 1.07 at birth, 1.06 for those under 15, 1.02 for those between 15 and 64, and 0.78 for those over 65.&lt;ref name="CIA Fact Book" /&gt;

The "[[First World]]" [[G7]] members all have a gender ratio in the range of 0.95–0.98 for the total population, of 1.05–1.07 at birth, of 1.05–1.06 for the group below 15, of 1.00–1.04 for the group aged 15–64, and of 0.70–0.75 for those over 65.

Countries on the [[Arabian peninsula]] tend to have a 'natural' ratio of about 1.05 at birth but a very high ratio of males for those over 65 (Saudi Arabia 1.13, Arab Emirates 2.73, Qatar 2.84), indicating either an above-average mortality rate for females or a below-average mortality for males, or, more likely in this case, a large population of aging male [[guest workers]].{{cn|date=November 2017}} Conversely, countries of [[Northern Europe|Northern]] and [[Eastern Europe]] (the [[Baltic states]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]]) tend to have a 'normal' ratio at birth but a very low ratio of males among those over 65 (Russia 0.46, Latvia 0.48, Ukraine 0.52); similarly, [[Armenia]] has a far above average male ratio at birth (1.17), and a below-average male ratio above 65 (0.67). This effect may be caused by [[human migration|emigration]] and higher male mortality as result of higher Soviet era deaths; it may also be related to the enormous (by western standards) rate of alcoholism in the former Soviet states.{{cn|date=November 2017}} Another possible contributory factor is an aging population, with a higher than normal proportion of relatively elderly people: we recall that due to higher differential mortality rates the ratio of males to females reduces for each year of age.

In the [[evolutionary biology]] of [[sexual reproduction]], the [[operational sex ratio]] (OSR), is the ratio of sexually competing males that are ready to mate to sexually competing females that are ready to mate,&lt;ref name="CluttonBrock2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Clutton-Brock | first1 = T. | title = Sexual Selection in Males and Females | doi = 10.1126/science.1133311 | journal = Science | volume = 318 | issue = 5858 | pages = 1882–1885 | year = 2007 | pmid =  18096798| pmc = | bibcode = 2007Sci...318.1882C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kvarnemo1996"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kvarnemo, C. |author2=Ahnesjo, I. | year = 1996 | title = The dynamics of operational sex ratios and competition for mates | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | pages = 404–408  | doi = 10.1016/0169-5347(96)10056-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emlen1976"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Emlen, S.T. | year = 1976 | title = Lek organization and mating strategies in the bullfrog | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 283–313 |doi=10.1007/bf00300069 | jstor=4599103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or alternatively the local ratio of fertilizable females to sexually active males at any given time.&lt;ref name="Emlen1977"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Emlen, S.T. |author2=Oring, L.W. | year = 1977| title = Ecology, Sexual Selection, and the Evolution of Mating Systems | journal = Science | volume = 197 | issue = 4300 | pages = 215–223 | pmid=327542 | doi=10.1126/science.327542|bibcode=1977Sci...197..215E }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its difference from the physical [[sex ratio]], is that it does not take into account sexually inactive or non-competitive individuals (individuals that do not compete for mates). On occasion, regions with a high male-low female sex ratio, like Alaska, have shown a correlation with a higher rate of reported rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/17/opinion/sutter-alaska-ratio-rape/index.html|title=Opinion: Nope, not too many men in Alaska - CNN|first=By John D.

== Consequences of a high sex ratio ==
There are several social consequences of an imbalanced sex ratio. High ratios of males make it easier for women to marry, but harder for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Louis, Henry | year = 1975 | title = Schema d'Evolution des Marriages apres de Grandes Variations des Naissances | url = http://www.persee.fr/doc/pop_0032-4663_1975_num_30_4_18620| journal = Population | volume = 30 | issue = 759| page = 779 |doi=10.2307/1530481|jstor=1530481 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In parts of China and India, there is a 12–15% excess of young men. These men will remain single and will be unable to have families, in societies where marriage is regarded as virtually universal and social status and acceptance depend, in large part, on being married and creating a new family. Analyses of how sex ratio imbalances affect personal consumption and intra-household distribution were pioneered by [[Gary Becker]], [[Shoshana Grossbard-Shechtman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1981 | title = The Impact of the Female Marriage Squeeze and the Contraceptive Revolution on Sex Roles and the Women's Liberation Movement in the United States, 1960 to 1975 | url = | journal = Journal of Marriage and the Family | volume = 43 | issue = 1| pages = 49–65 | doi=10.2307/351416| jstor = 351416 | last1 = Heer | first1 = David M. | last2 = Grossbard-Shechtman | first2 = Amyra }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shoshana Grossbard-Shechtman (1993), ''On the Economics of Marriage – A Theory of Marriage, Labor and Divorce''.

An additional problem is that many of these men are of low socioeconomic class with limited education. When there is a shortage of women in the marriage market, the women can "marry up", inevitably leaving the least desirable men with no marriage prospects. In many communities today, there are growing numbers of young men who come from lower classes who are marginalized because of lack of family prospects and the fact that they have little outlet for sexual energy.

His fields of expertise covered [[fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], [[kalam]], [[Arabic language]] and [[astronomy]]. He lived all his life in [[Tripoli]] and died and was buried there. He studied under Libyan scholars of his time and was famous for being interested in meeting those who traveled through Tripoli from the [[Mashriq]] and the [[Maghrib]] and acquiring wider knowledge from them. It is said that when he was asked about how he acquired all this knowledge, he replied, "I acquired it from the Huwwāra and Znāta gates,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arab-ency.com/index.php?module=pnEncyclopedia&amp;func=display_term&amp;id=1484 Arab Encyclopedia] {{ar icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to the names of two main gates to Tripoli, named after two Berber tribes.

The '''International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences''' ('''IUAES''') is the largest world forum of [[anthropologist]]s and [[Ethnology|ethnologists]], with members from more than fifty countries. Every five years, in different parts of the world, the IUAES sponsors a major Congress (ICAES/World Congress), gathering researchers from all of the various subfields and branches of anthropology. The IUAES was founded under the auspices of [[UNESCO]] in 1948. The International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences (ICAES) had been separately founded in [[London]] in 1934. The two organizations united in 1948, and merged officially in 1968. In 2018, IUAES became one of the chambers of the newly established World Anthropological Union (WAU). The main objective of the IUAES is the internationalization of anthropology, and the cross-cultural honing and public dissemination of anthropological research perspectives.

== History ==

The earliest  predecessor of the IUAES was the International Congress of Anthropology and Prehistoric Archaeology, which was founded in [[La Spezia]], Italy, in 1865. In 1932, in [[Basel|Basle]], Switzerland, it was decided to split the congress into two sections, one for the Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences and one for the [[Prehistory|Prehistoric]] and [[Protohistory|Protohistoric]] [[Science]]s. This is how the ICAES was born, becoming operative in 1934, when it held its first meeting in [[London]], UK. Meetings were scheduled for every four years, but only one more congress was held, in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, in 1938, before World War II made it impossible for people to convene. It took ten years before the next congress was held, in 1948, in [[Brusel|Brussels]], Belgium. Here a special committee was established to be concerned solely with anthropological interests and this became the IUAES. It was formed under the aegis of [[UNESCO]] and became a member of the International Council for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies ([[ICPHS]]), which it remains to this day. 

The four-year congress cycle continued with meetings in [[Vienna]] (1952), [[Philadelphia]] (1956), [[Paris]] (1960) and [[Moscow]] (1964). Up to this point the IUAES remained separate from the ICAES, and was presided over by different people until Henri Vallois took over both presidencies in 1956. Just four years prior to this, in 1952, the International Social Science Council ([[ISSC]]) was founded and the IUAES has been represented in it ever since. By 1964, at the ICAES in Moscow, it was decided that the two organizations be joined de facto. At the following congress, in [[Tokyo]] (1968), they were united de jure. At the same congress, it was also decided to change the time interval between congresses from four to five years, scheduling the following congress for 1973 in [[Chicago]]. At the subsequent congress, held in [[New Delhi]], India, in 1978, it was proposed to organize inter-congresses. These smaller meetings enable countries which do not have the resources to hold a large-scale congress to participate actively. IUAES Inter-Congresses are held with varied frequency in the five-year interval between congresses. To ensure the financial autonomy of the Union from its congresses, in 1998 it was decided to again separate the presidency of the IUAES from that of each succeeding ICAES. The ICAES scheduled for 2008 in Kunming, China, had to be postponed by one year, and was held in 2009 as the IUAES World Congress. The next World Congress was held in [[Manchester]], UK, in 2013.

== Structure ==
 
The IUAES has an administrative structure involving three bodies: the General Assembly, the Permanent Council, and the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee is the main regulatory body, making policy decisions on behalf of, and subject to the authority of, the Permanent Council. The Permanent Council consists of national delegations empowered to vote on any matters concerning the Union. The votes may follow discussions held at the General Assembly. The latter can also put forward proposals but has no decision-making authority. All policy decisions are implemented by the Executive Committee. The structural guidelines of the IUAES are given in its Statutes, which have grown from a simple set of rules into an array of constitutional by-laws.   

The core officers of the IUAES Executive Committee are the President, the Secretary-General and the Treasurer, with the Secretary-General maintaining all records of the Union and supervising all communications, including the production and dissemination of new IUAES publications (including Newsletters and Handbooks), as well as the designing and updating of the IUAES website. The current Secretary-General is [[Noel B. Salazar]]. The rest of the Executive Committee, that is, the past-president, the vice-presidents (with the president of the following congress acting as an additional vice-president) and the members-at-large, aid in the decision-making process. 

The scientific work of the IUAES is carried out by its Commissions, which focus on particular topics of specialized interest. The IUAES Commissions, of which more than thirty are currently recognized, (Nas and Zhang 2009:460-461),&lt;ref&gt;Nas, Peter J. M. and Zhang Jijiao, eds. (2009) ''Anthropology Now''. Beijing: Intellectual Property Rights Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; determine their own administrative structure and set of activities, which generally include the organization of panels, workshops, and sessions at the quinquennial ICAES. Some commissions have been in existence for decades, while others have rapidly disbanded. Some commissions have their own websites, organize their own conferences, and sponsor the publication of journals or book series. Groups of commissions sometimes co-sponsor initiatives of common interest, and it is possible for IUAES members to be involved in the work of multiple commissions.

== Mission ==

As stated in Article 3 of its Statutes, posted on the IUAES website, the objectives of the Union are:
* To develop international scientific and professional co-operation (consistent with the Charter of UNESCO) in the fields of anthropology and ethnology, in the broadest sense in which these are understood in different parts of the world, and related disciplines and areas of study; 
* To foster the development of scientific and professional institutions internationally and regionally; 
* To stimulate scientific and professional co-operation among institutions devoted to relevant fields of knowledge; 
* To co-operate with other international organizations, and particularly, though not exclusively, with the [[International Council for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies]], the [[International Social Science Council]], the [[International Council of Scientific Unions]], and the [[International Council of Museums]]; 
* To develop appropriate roles for anthropology and ethnology in international inter-disciplinary scientific endeavors; 
* To take appropriate steps to meet any other objectives consistent with the international scientific and professional concerns of the membership, as determined by the Permanent Council and the Executive Committee.

Reaching these objectives requires the internationalization of anthropological practice through cross-cultural exchanges based on inclusive, democratic, and intellectually pluralistic policies. These needs were formally acknowledged under the leadership of  Cyril S. Belshaw, president in the period 1978-1983, who sensed that "the mood is to place the Union on an active footing" (Belshaw, 1979: 244).&lt;ref&gt;Belshaw, Cyril S. (1979) "Message from the President" ''Current Anthropology'' 20(1):244-245.&lt;/ref&gt; The IUAES Congresses and Inter-Congresses catalyze this process, which is also facilitated by the development and maintenance of efficient channels of membership-wide communication. Initially, news about the IUAES was disseminated through ''Current Anthropology'', the journal of the [[Wenner-Gren Foundation]], which also supported the IUAES. Starting in 1981, however, Dr. [[Eric Sunderland]]—the longest serving and one of the most influential, and beloved, IUAES Secretary-Generals—introduced a Newsletter, which he continued to edit and distribute until he moved from his post to become President of the IUAES. Dr. Peter J. M. Nas, who became the next Secretary-General, continued and expanded the publication of the Newsletter, and also developed an official website ([http://www.leidenuniv.nl/fsw/iuaes]), which rapidly became the central point of contact for the Union.

The Williamsburg Congress of 1998 marked the end of a century of anthropology by highlighting that: "No discipline is more important for teaching people about themselves and others, and how they may live together in the next century, than anthropology" (Shahshahani, 1999:5).&lt;ref&gt;Shahshahani, Soheila (1999) "ICAES, Williamsburg 1998" International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences Newsletter 52.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also pointed out that:"Anthropology is either truly international or not at all"(Godina, 1999:vii).&lt;ref&gt;Godina, Vesna (1999) "Foreword" in  ''Anthropological Theory in North America''. E. L. Cerroni-Long, ed., Westport, CT, Bergin &amp; Garvey.&lt;/ref&gt; The IUAES, which celebrated the 60th anniversary of its founding in 2008, enters the second decade of the 21st century with a renewed sense of the importance of its mission, and urgency of its objectives.

'''Joint constraints''' are rotational constraints on the [[joint]]s of an artificial bone system. They are used in an [[inverse kinematics]] chain, for such things as [[3D animation]] or [[robotics]].  Joint constraints can be implemented in a number of ways, but the most common method is to limit rotation about the X, Y and Z [[Axis of rotation|axis]] independently. An elbow, for instance, could be represented by limiting rotation on Y and Z axis to 0 degrees, and constraining the X-axis rotation to 130 degrees.

To simulate joint constraints more accurately, dot-products can be used with an independent [[Wiktionary:axis|axis]] to repulse the child bones orientation from the unreachable axis. Limiting the orientation of the child bone to a border of [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]] tangent to the surface of the joint, repulsing the child bone away from the border, can also be useful in the precise restriction of shoulder movement.

'''Kosmopoisk''' ({{lang-ru|«Космопо́иск»}}, full name: Общеросси́йская нау́чно-иссле́довательская обще́ственная организа́ция, ОНИОО, translated "All-Russian Research Public Organization"), also known as '''Spacesearch''', is a group with interests in [[ufology]], [[cryptozoology]], and other mystery investigations. It started in 1980, and expanded in 2001 to an international movement. In 2004, it registered under the name All-Russian Scientific Organization. Many of the activities are in the form of expeditions to sites that are reputed to have extraterrestrial activity or unusual creatures.

==Formation==
The organization was founded by Russian science-fiction writer [[Alexander Kazantsev]], aerospace engineer [[Vadim Chernobrov]], astronaut [[Georgy Beregovoy]], and other enthusiasts, in order to explore the mysteries of the universe and nature, research new ways of space technology development, and work on breakthrough branches of science.{{citation needed|date=November 2012|reason=need source to confirm mission statement}} In 1945, Kanzanstev started to research the [[Tunguska event]] of 1908 and link it to a [[UFO]] crash and explosion. Two years later, there were UFO sightings in the [[United States]].

In 1980, Chernobrov and his colleagues from the [[Moscow Aviation Institute]] created the group whose objectives were to collect information about UFOs and anomalous events in the [[Soviet Union]], to develop a [[Lovondatr]] device (aka "time car"), and to send expeditions to explore the most promising anomalous zones. In 2004, the group registered themselves as Kosmopoisk (All-Russian Scientific Organization). They consider themselves  the largest non-commercial public research organization in the world.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

{{expand section|date=November 2012|1=need details on how people join, demographics, key leaders, meetings and major events, newsletters}}
The organization has more than 2,500 active members, in more than 100 groups in 25 countries. It has organized more than 250 expeditions.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Expeditions==
In the 1990s, the group made expeditions an annual event. To save costs, they would hitchhike as a main way of traveling. For instance, in 1999, the group made an expedition to the remote Labynkyr Lake in [[Yakutia]], [[Sakha Republic]], where an underwater monster, similar to [[Nessie]], has been believed to exist since the 1960s. They hitchhiked the [[Kolyma]] federal road to get to Labynkyr Lake in [[Yakutia]]. They then collected their results of anomalous events into a database.

One of the events the group would investigate was the meteorite landing at Korenevo in [[Kaluga Oblast]]. The meteorite landed in October 1996. The group conducted expeditions annually from 1997 to 2003. They also held a Kosmopoisk conference in May in Korenevo. Its objective was not only to search for the impact point, but also a way to involve a large number of people, mostly from educational institutions, in the public research process.

Another annual event is the "monitoring" expedition to Southern Russia, mostly to [[Krasnodar Krai]] to investigate [[crop circle]]s before they become  structurally damaged by tourists. The group deployed "UfoSETI" to collect and analyze the reports about UFO spottings and crop circle discoveries in Russia.

Another popular expedition site is the She-Bear Ridge (Russian: Медведицкая гряда; ''Medveditskaya gryada''), which is situated in [[Volgograd Oblast]].  It is considered to be one of the most impressive anomalous zones in Russia, including multiple observations of "triangle [[UFO]]s", "crazy lightnings slope", mysterious underground tunnels, and a possible Lovondatr-7 [[time travel]] experiment. The group started exploring the ridge in the 1980s.

In 2002 and 2003, the group made expeditions to [[Brosno Lake]] in [[Tver Oblast]] in search of the Brosno Dragon, "Brosnya", an underwater creature. According to the legends, Brosnya was first spotted by Mongolian invaders in 1240. The group did a complete [[sonar]] underwater scan and coastal monitoring. They concluded that the Brosnya was likely caused by massive gas eruptions from the lake bottom.

From 2002 to 2004, the group made expeditions to Verkhoshizhemye in [[Kirov Oblast]] to look for the habitats of [[bigfoot]] creatures. They found and photographed some probable camp sites.

In 2002, the group launched a multi-profile{{technical statement|date=November 2012|reason=explain what this is}} expedition to find the [[Aleshenka|Kyshtym dwarf "Aleshenka"]]. They traveled to [[Kyshtym]] which is located in the [[Urals Federal District]]. The dwarf allegedly appeared in the town in the late 1990s but after it died, its corpse was retrieved by [[militsiya]] officers and then was stolen with present whereabouts unknown. The expeditioners collected data, gathered evidence from witnesses, found a possible [[UFO]] landing site, and explored a deep Sugomak cave, where they suspect the dwarf beings might have lived.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

In May and June 2003, the group held an expedition to the [[Vitim River]] in [[Siberia]] to investigate the site of the [[Vitim event]], which was a large explosion suspected to be from a comet landing.

In September 2004, the group held an expedition to the [[Mountains of Ararat]] in search of [[Noah's Ark]].

'''Marymount California University''' is a [[Catholicism|Catholic]], [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]] [[university]] in [[Rancho Palos Verdes, California|Rancho Palos Verdes]], [[California]].  Based in the liberal arts tradition and inspired by the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary (RHSM), the university awards [[associate degree|associate]], [[bachelor's]], and [[graduate degree]]s.&lt;ref name="MCU web site"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marymountcalifornia.edu/academic-programs|title=Academic Program Information - Marymount California University|website=Marymountcalifornia.edu|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institution is [[Higher education accreditation|accredited]] by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wascsenior.org/institutions/marymount-california-university|title=Marymount California University - WASC Senior College and University Commission|website=Wascsenior.org|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Marymount California University was established in 1968 by the RHSM as Marymount Palos Verdes College. It was split from the original Marymount College in [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood, Los Angeles]]; this Marymount later merged with St. Joseph's College and then Loyola University to form [[Loyola Marymount University]]. At the time, the college was a two-year institution of higher education. In 1975, responsibility for the College was transferred to a lay board of trustees.&lt;ref name="MCU web site-a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marymountcalifornia.edu/?q=quick-facts|title=Quick Facts - Marymount California University|website=Marymountcalifornia.edu|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the college changed its name from Marymount Palos Verdes College to Marymount College. In summer 2011, Marymount opened its Waterfront Campus in downtown [[San Pedro, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="dailybreeze.com"&gt;[http://www.dailybreeze.com/moresanpedro/ci_18680236?source=email] {{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spring 2013, Marymount changed its name from Marymount College to Marymount California University to reflect "an ongoing transformation of the 45-year-old institution of higher education to a multi-campus institution offering undergraduate and graduate degree programs." In fall 2013, Marymount opened its Lakeside Campus in the community of Lucerne in rural Lake County, in Northern California.&lt;ref name=petersons&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-tidings.com/index.php/features/san-pedro/3282-marymount-college-changes-name-to-reflect-growth-mission |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407074951/http://www.the-tidings.com/index.php/features/san-pedro/3282-marymount-college-changes-name-to-reflect-growth-mission |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, the university appointed trustee Brian Marcotte its new president. It was not immediately clear why the previous president, Lucas Lamadrid, left the position although the local newspaper ''[[Daily Breeze]]'' reported "allegations of inappropriate behavior, exorbitant spending and discriminatory conduct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailybreeze.com/2018/02/05/marymount-california-university-president-mia-amid-allegations-of-inappropriate-behavior/ |title= Marymount California University president MIA amid allegations of inappropriate behavior |author=Valerie Osier |publisher=[[Daily Breeze]] |date=February 5, 2018 |accessdate=February 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campuses==
The '''Oceanview Campus''' encompasses 26-acres overlooking the Pacific Ocean and [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]] in Rancho Palos Verdes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://californiacolleges.edu/campustour/undergraduate/376/Marymount_College__CA/Marymount_College__CA8.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402161736/http://californiacolleges.edu/campustour/undergraduate/376/Marymount_College__CA/Marymount_College__CA8.html |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Waterfront Campus''' encompasses the first floor of the former [[Northrop Grumman]] facility at 222 W. Sixth St., and provides classroom and studio space for upper division students, as well as some office space for [[Business school|faculty and staff]].

'''Residential Community''' include The Villas located in adjacent San Pedro, a community of fully furnished, two-story townhomes that can accommodate 400 students and staff.  In the center of the community is a swimming pool, fitness center, outdoor covered pavilion, beach volleyball court, basketball court and a soon to be completed outdoor kitchen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marymountcalifornia.edu/san-pedro-residential |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140403163124/http://www.marymountcalifornia.edu/san-pedro-residential |archivedate=2014-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Minimally invasive education''' ('''MIE''') is a form of [[learn]]ing in which children operate in unsupervised environments. The methodology arose from an experiment done by [[Sugata Mitra]] while at [[NIIT]] in 1999, often called ''The Hole in the Wall'',&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=test /&gt; which has since gone on to become a significant project with the formation of Hole in the Wall Education Limited (HiWEL), a cooperative effort between NIIT and the [[International Finance Corporation]], employed in some 300 'learning stations', covering some 300,000 children in [[India]] and several African countries.

The programme has been feted with the digital opportunity award by [[WITSA]],&lt;ref name=test /&gt; and been extensively covered in the media.

==History==

===Background===
Professor Mitra, Chief Scientist at NIIT, is credited with proposing and initiating the Hole-in-the-Wall programme. As early as 1982, he had been toying with the idea of unsupervised learning and [[computer]]s. Finally, in 1999, he decided to test his ideas in the field.

===The experiment===
On 26 January 1999, Mitra's team carved a "hole in the wall" that separated the NIIT premises from the adjoining slum in Kalkaji, New Delhi. Through this hole, a freely accessible computer was put up for use. This computer proved to be popular among the slum children. With no prior experience, the children learned to use the computer on their own. This prompted  Mitra to propose the following hypothesis:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/docs/Paper01.pdf PDF of Dr. Mitra's Hypothesis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530050350/http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/docs/Paper01.pdf |date=2009-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition of basic computing skills by any set of children can be achieved through incidental learning provided the learners are given access to a suitable computing facility, with entertaining and motivating content and some minimal (human) guidance.

In the following comment on the TED website Mitra explains how they saw to it that the computer in this experiment was accessible to children only:
:: ''"... We placed the computers 3 feet off the ground and put a shade on top, so if you are tall, you hit your head on it. Then we put a protective plastic cowl over the keyboard which had an opening such that small hands would go in. Then we put a seating rod in front that was close to the wall so that, if you are of adult height, your legs would splay when you sit. Then we painted the whole thing in bright colours and put a sign saying 'for children under 15'. Those design factors prevented adult access to a very large extent."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.ted.com/profiles/136558|title=Sugata Mitra comments|date=|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Results===
Mitra has summarised the results of his experiment as follows. Given free and public access to computers and the Internet, a group of children can
*Become computer literate on their own, that is, they can learn to use computers and the Internet for most of the tasks done by lay users.
*Teach themselves enough [[English language|English]] to use email, chat and search engines.
*Learn to search the Internet for answers to questions in a few months time.
*Improve their English [[pronunciation]] on their own.
*Improve their mathematics and science scores in school.
*Answer examination questions several years ahead of time.
*Change their social interaction skills and value systems.
*Form independent opinions and detect indoctrination.&lt;ref&gt;http://sugatam.wikispaces.com/file/view/Method+ELSE+for+schools+where+children+teach+themselves.docx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status and expansion outside India==
The first adopter of the idea was the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi. In 2000, the Government of Delhi set up 30 Learning Stations in a resettlement colony. This project is ongoing and said to be achieving significant results.

Encouraged by the initial success of the Kalkaji experiment, freely accessible computers were set up in Shivpuri (a town in Madhya Pradesh) and in Madantusi (a village in Uttar Pradesh).  These experiments came to be known as Hole-in-the-Wall experiments. The findings from Shivpuri and Madantusi confirmed the results of Kalkaji experiments.  It appeared that the children in these two places picked up computer skills on their own. Dr. Mitra defined this as a new way of learning "Minimally Invasive Education".

At this point in time, International Finance Corporation joined hands with NIIT to set up Hole-in-the-Wall Education Ltd (HiWEL). The idea was to broaden the scope of the experiments and conduct research to prove and streamline Hole-in-the-Wall. The results,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/Findings.html | title = Findings | publisher = HiWEL | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090711114940/http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/findings.html | archivedate = 2009-07-11 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; show that children learn to operate as well as play with the computer with minimum intervention. They picked up skills and tasks by constructing their own learning environment.

Today, more than 300,000 children have benefited from 300 Hole-in-the-Wall stations over last 8 years. In India Suhotra Banerjee (Head-Government Relations) has increased the reach of HiWEL learning stations in Nagaland, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh... and is slowly expanding their numbers.&lt;ref name=tests /&gt;

Besides India, HiWEL also has projects abroad.  The first such project was established in Cambodia in 2004.  The project currently operates in Botswana, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Swaziland, Uganda, and Zambia, besides Cambodia.&lt;ref name=tests /&gt; The idea, also called [[Open learning]], is even being applied in Britain, albeit inside the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | place = UK | url= https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/mar/16/slumdog-millionaire-education-online-independent |title= Slumdog reveals learning treasures | first = Lucy |last=Tobin |publisher=The Guardian |date=16 March 2010 |accessdate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HiWEL==
Hole-in-the-Wall Education Ltd. (HiWEL) is a joint venture between [[NIIT]] and the [[International Finance Corporation]]. Established in 2001, HiWEL was set up to research and propagate the idea of Hole-in-the-Wall, a path-breaking learning methodology created by Mitra, Chief Scientist of NIIT.&lt;ref name=test&gt;[http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/abouthiwel.html Official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729225909/http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/abouthiwel.html |date=2012-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
* Digital Opportunity Award by the [[World Information Technology and Services Alliance]] (WITSA) in 2008. Reason: "groundbreaking work in developing computer literacy and improving the quality of education at a grass root level."&lt;ref name=tests /&gt;

==In school==

Minimally Invasive Education in school adduces there are many reasons why children may have difficulty learning, especially when the learning is imposed and the subject is something the student is not interested in, a frequent occurrence in modern schools. Schools also label children as "learning disabled" and place them in special education even if the child does not have a learning disability, because the schools have failed to teach the children basic skills.&lt;ref&gt;Snell, Lisa. (2002), [http://reason.com/archives/2002/12/01/special-education-confidential/ "Special education confidential: how schools use the 'learning disability' label to cover up their failures,"] Reason December 1, 2002. Retrieved August 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Minimally Invasive Education in school asserts there are many ways to study and learn. It argues that learning is a process you do, not a process that is done to you.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1987) The Sudbury Valley School Experience [http://www.sudval.com/05_underlyingideas.html#09 ''Back to Basics''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511175026/http://www.sudval.com/05_underlyingideas.html#09 |date=2011-05-11 }}. Retrieved August 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of schools holding this approach shows that [[Traditional education#Criticism of the concept of teaching in traditional education|there are many ways to learn without the intervention of teaching]], to say, without the intervention of a teacher being imperative. In the case of reading for instance in these schools some children learn from being read to, memorizing the stories and then ultimately reading them. Others learn from cereal boxes, others from games instructions, others from street signs. Some teach themselves letter sounds, others syllables, others whole words. They adduce that in their schools no one child has ever been forced, pushed, urged, cajoled, or bribed into learning how to read or write, and they have had no dyslexia. None of their graduates are real or functional illiterates, and no one who meets their older students could ever guess the age at which they first learned to read or write.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1987) Free at Last, The Sudbury Valley School, [https://books.google.com/books?id=es2nOuZE0rAC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=Free+at+Last+The+Sudbury+Valley+School+The+Other+%27R%27s&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Chapter 5, ''The Other 'R's'']. Retrieved August 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar form students learn all the subjects, techniques and skills in these schools. Every person, children and youth included, has a different learning style and pace and each person, is unique, not only capable of learning but also capable of succeeding. These schools assert that applying the [[Medical model|medical model of problem-solving]] to individual children who are pupils in the school system, and labeling these children as disabled—referring to a whole generation of non-standard children that have been labeled as dysfunctional, even though they suffer from nothing more than the disease of responding differently in the classroom than the average manageable student—systematically prevents the students' success and the improvement of the current educational system, thus requiring the prevention of academic failure through intervention. This, they clarify, does not refer to people who have a specific disability that affects their drives; nor is anything they say and write about education meant to apply to people who have specific mental impairments, which may need to be dealt with in special, clinical ways.

Describing current instructional methods as [[Homogeneity|homogenization]] and [[lockstep]] standardization, alternative approaches are proposed, such as the [[Sudbury model|Sudbury model schools]], an alternative approach in which children, by [[Sudbury Valley School#Educational philosophy|enjoying personal freedom]] thus [[School discipline#Discipline in Sudbury Model Democratic Schools|encouraged to exercise personal responsibility for their actions]], [[Literacy#Learning without the intervention of teaching|learn at their own pace]] rather than following a chronologically-based curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D.

As long as children do no harm to others, they can do whatever they want with their time in school. The adults in other schools plan a curriculum of study, teach the students the material and then test and grade their learning. The adults at Sudbury schools are ''"the guardians of the children's freedom to pursue their own interests and to learn what they wish,"'' creating and maintaining a nurturing environment, in which children feel that they are cared for, and that does not rob children of their time to explore and discover their inner selves. They also are there to answer questions and to impart specific skills or knowledge when asked to by students.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, H. (1987).

:"If learning is an emergent phenomenon, then the teacher needs to provide stimulus — lots of it – in the form of “big” questions. These must include questions to which the teacher, or perhaps anyone, does not have the answer. These should be the sorts of questions that will occupy children’s minds perpetually. The teacher needs to help each child cultivate a vision of the future. Thus, a new primary curriculum needs to teach only three skills: 1. Reading comprehension: This is perhaps the most crucial skill a child needs to acquire while growing up. 2. Information search and analysis: First articulated at the National Institute of Technology in India by professor J.R. Isaac in the early 1990s — decades ahead of its time — this skill set is vital for children searching for answers in an infinite cyberspace. 3. A rational system of belief: If children know how to search, and if they know how to read, then they must learn how to believe. Each one of us has a belief system. How soon can a child acquire one? A rational belief system will be our children’s protection against doctrine. Children who have these skills scarcely need schools as we define them today. They need a learning environment and a source of rich, big questions. Computers can give out answers, but they cannot, as of yet, make questions. Hence, the teacher’s role becomes bigger and stranger than ever before: She must ask her “learners” about things she does not know herself. Then she can stand back and watch as learning emerges."&lt;ref&gt;Mitra, S. 2012. ''Beyond the Hole in the Wall: Discover the Power of Self-Organized Learning''. TED Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nationalism studies''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] academic field devoted to the study of [[nationalism]] and related issues.  While nationalism has been the subject of scholarly discussion since at least the late eighteenth century, it is only since the early 1990s that it has received enough attention for a distinct field to emerge.&lt;ref name="Özkirimli 2000p15"&gt;{{cite book|last=Özkirimli|first=Umut|title=Theories of Nationalism: A Critical Introduction|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2000|pages=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lG09IwAACAAJ|isbn=0-333-77711-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors such as [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[Carlton J. H. Hayes]], [[Hans Kohn]], [[Elie Kedourie]], [[John Hutchinson (academic)|John Hutchinson]], [[Ernest Gellner]], [[Karl Deutsch]], [[Walker Connor]], [[Anthony D. Smith]], and [[Benedict Anderson]] laid the foundation for nationalism studies in the post-war period.  In the early 1990s their ideas were enthusiastically taken up by academics, journalists, and others looking to understand and explain the apparent resurgence of nationalism marked by events such as the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], the [[Rwanda genocide]], and the [[Yugoslav Wars]].

==History of the field==

The development of the field can be divided into four stages: (I) the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when nationalism first emerged, and most interest in it was philosophical; (II) the period from the [[First World War]] until the end of the [[Second World War|Second]], when nationalism became a subject of formal academic inquiry; (III) the post-war period from 1945 to the late 1980s, when several [[sociology|sociologists]] and [[political science|political scientists]] developed general theories of nationalism in the context of worldwide [[decolonisation]] and the 'ethnic revival' in the [[Western world|West]]; and (IV) the period following the [[fall of communism]] in 1989, which led to a surge of interest in nationalism and the crystallisation of nationalism studies as a field.&lt;ref name="Özkirimli 2000p15"/&gt;

===Eighteenth and nineteenth centuries===
"Up to the First World War," [[Umut Özkirimli]] explains, "interest in nationalism was largely [[ethical]] and [[philosophical]]. The scholars of this period, predominantly historians and social philosophers, were more concerned with the 'merits and defects' of the [[doctrine]] than with the origins and spread of national phenomena."&lt;ref name="Özkirimli 2000p12"&gt;{{cite book|last=Özkirimli|first=Umut|title=Theories of Nationalism: A Critical Introduction|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2000|pages=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lG09IwAACAAJ|isbn=0-333-77711-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[nation-state]] was seen as a progressive stage in the historical development of human societies, and both [[Liberalism|liberals]] and [[Marxists]] expected that nationalism would eventually give way to a [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] world order. In this context, nations and nationalism were taken for granted, and most authors who discussed them were motivated by some political concern. There were no attempts to fashion a general theory of nationalism that was applicable to all cases.&lt;ref name="Özkirimli 2000p12-13"&gt;{{cite book|last=Özkirimli|first=Umut|title=Theories of Nationalism: A Critical Introduction|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2000|pages=12–13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lG09IwAACAAJ|isbn=0-333-77711-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the important authors in this period include: [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], [[Ernest Renan]], and [[John Stuart Mill]].

==Nationalism studies as an academic field==

Several universities organize degree and non-degree courses on nationalism. Boston University, University of London (particularly the [[London School of Economics]]), Central European University (Hungary), and University of Edinburgh are among the most prominent institutions where the study of nationalism occupies a central place. The Faculty of Humanities of [[Eötvös Loránd University]] (Hungary) has recently launched a comprehensive short-term program, dedicated exclusively to the study of nationalism.

== The future of the field ==
Authors such as Michal Luczewski and Ruhtan Yalçıne believe that the field is becoming increasingly difficult to study. According to Michal Luczewski, researchers have been talking past each other for decades and there has not been valuable knowledge produced for around 50 years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iwm.at/publications/5-junior-visiting-fellows-conferences/vol-xviii/michal-luczewski/|title=What Remains for Nationalism Studies?|last=Luczewski|first=Michal|date=|website=Institute for Human Sciences|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Since this time, the field has been stuck between contemporary scientific facts and common-sense theories. Answers to the basic questions of nationalism (What is the Nation? Why does the Nation exist?) have been answered countless times over leaving a swath of contradictory theories and a lack of consensus. The question remains whether it is even possible to construct a universal theory of nationalism. Theories previously proposed are often detached from reality, given the diverse ways in which identities form in different groups around the world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yalçıner|first=Ruhtan|date=2010-03-01|title=Political Philosophy and Nationalism|url=http://internationalstudies.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-276?rskey=YgklCh&amp;result=1|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-276}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

In order to solve for this problem Michal Luczewski recommends that scholars employ greater awareness in addressing the essential questions of nationalism studies. Scholars should produce extensive work dealing “with national phenomena in all their varieties, integrating emotions, cognitions, both the subjective and objective dimensions into one picture.” It is essential for scholars to ignore subjective experience and deal directly with reality. This can be accomplished by utilizing empirical evidence. Luczewski also recommends starting small, “consecutively from the micro level through more and more general steps to the macro one.”

==Journals==

One of the earliest journals devoted to the study of nationalism was the ''[[Canadian Review of Studies in Nationalism]]'', founded at the [[University of Prince Edward Island]] by [[Thomas Spira]] in 1973. The journal "[[Nationalities Papers]]" was founded in 1971. Journals in the field include the following:

*''[[Ethnicities (journal)|Ethnicities]]''

'''New Breeding Techniques (NBT)''', also named ''New Plant Engineering Techniques,'' are a suite of methods that could increase and accelerate the development of new traits in [[Plant Breeding|plant breeding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Lusser M, Parisi C, Rodriguez Cerezo E, Plan D |title= New plant breeding techniques.

These new techniques, often involve 'genome editing' whose intention is to modify [[DNA]] at specific locations within the plants' [[Gene|genes]] so that new traits and properties are produced in crop plants. 

An ongoing discussion in many countries is as to whether NBTs should be included within the same pre-existing governmental regulations to control [[Genetic engineering#Regulation|genetic modification]]&lt;ref name = "Steinbrecher_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Ricarda A.| last = Steinbrecher  | name-list-format = vanc | title = Genetic Engineering in Plants and the “New Breeding Techniques (NBTs)” Inherent risks and the need to regulate | journal = EcoNexus | date = December 2015 | url = http://www.econexus.info/sites/econexus/files/NBT%20Briefing%20-%20EcoNexus%20December%202015.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="POSTNOTE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="POSTNOTE"&gt;{{cite web | title = POST Note 548: New Plant Breeding Techniques | url = http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/POST-PN-0548/POST-PN-0548.pdf | publisher = UK Houses of Parliament|accessdate=6 January 2018|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Argentina&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whelan AI, Lema MA | title = Regulatory framework for gene editing and other new breeding techniques (NBTs) in Argentina | journal = GM Crops &amp; Food | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 253–65 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26552666 | pmc = 5033209 | doi = 10.1080/21645698.2015.1114698 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FSANZ&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/gmfood/Pages/Review-of-new-breeding-technologies-.aspx|title=Food derived using new breeding techniques - review|last=|first=|date=December 2017|website=www.foodstandards.gov.au|publisher=Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ)|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Tanaka&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tanaka|first=Yutaka|name-list-format = vanc |date=2017-10-02|title=Major Psychological Factors Affecting Acceptance of New Breeding Techniques for Crops|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/08974438.2017.1382417|journal=Journal of International Food &amp; Agribusiness Marketing|volume=29|issue=4|pages=366–382|doi=10.1080/08974438.2017.1382417|issn=0897-4438}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2017"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://theecologist.org/2017/apr/04/new-breeding-techniques-and-synthetic-biology-genetic-engineering-another-name | title = 'New Breeding Techniques' and synthetic biology - genetic engineering by another name | last1 = Paul | first1= Helena | last2 = Bücking | first2 = Elisabeth | last3 = Steinbrecher | first3 = Ricarda | name-list-format = vanc | date = 4 April 2017 | work = The Ecologist | access-date=2018-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05814-6 | title = CRISPR plants now subject to tough GM laws in European Union | last1 = Callaway | first1= E  | date = 25 July 2018 | journal = Nature }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Methods involved ==
New breeding techniques (NBTs) make specific changes within plant DNA in order to change its [[Phenotypic trait|traits]], and these modifications can vary in scale from altering single [[Nucleobase|base]], to inserting or removing one or more genes.&lt;ref name="POSTNOTE" /&gt; The various methods of achieving these changes in traits include the following:&lt;ref name="POSTNOTE" /&gt;
* Cutting and modifying the genome during the repair process (three tools are used to achieve this: [[Zinc finger nuclease]]; [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease|TALENs]], and [[CRISPR/Cas Tools]])
* Genome editing to introduce changes to just a few [[Base pair|base pairs]] (using a technique called 'oligonucleotide-directed [[Mutagenesis (molecular biology technique)|mutagenesis]]' (ODM)).
* Transferring a gene from an identical or closely related species ([[cisgenesis]])
* Adding in a reshuffled set of regulatory instructions from same species (intragenesis)
* Deploying processes that alter gene activity without altering the DNA itself ([[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] methods)
* [[Grafting]] of unaltered plant onto a genetically modified [[rootstock]]&lt;ref name=ACRE_2013&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/genetically-modified-organisms-new-plant-growing-methods|title=Genetically modified organisms: new plant growing methods - GOV.UK|last=|first=|date=18 July 2013|website=www.gov.uk|publisher=Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential benefits and disbenefits==

Many European environmental organisations came together in 2016 to jointly express serious concerns over new breeding techniques.

== Regulation ==

===OECD===
The [[OECD|Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD) has its own 'Working Group on Harmonization of Regulatory Oversight in Biotechnology' but, as at 2015, there had been virtually no progress in addressing issues around NBTs, and this includes many major food-producing countries like Russia, South Africa, Brazil, Peru, Mexico, China, Japan and India. Despite its huge potential importance for trade and agriculture, as well as potential risks, the majority of food producing countries in the world at that date still had no policies or protocols for regulating or analysing food products derived specifically from new breeding techniques.&lt;ref name="Argentina" /&gt; 

=== South America ===
Argentina introduced regulations and protocols affecting NBTs. These were in place by 2015 &lt;!--date imprecise and needs further checking and follow-up of refs within this citation. This is certainly the latest date--&gt; and gave clarity to plant developers at an early stage so they could anticipate whether or not their products were likely to be regarded as GMOs. The protocols conform to the internationally recognised 2003 [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]].&lt;ref name="Argentina" /&gt;

===North America===
====US====
The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] is responsible for determining whether food products derived from NBTs should be regulated, and this is undertaken on a case-by-case manner under the US [[Plant Protection Act]]. As of 2015 there was no specific policy towards NBTs, although in the summer of that year the White House announced plans to update the U.S. Regulatory Framework for Biotechnology.&lt;ref name="OFW"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matz|first1=Marshall|last2=Hahn|first2=Robert|name-list-format=vanc|title=The White House Announces Plans to Update the U.S. Regulatory Framework for Biotechnology|url=https://www.ofwlaw.com/2015/07/09/the-white-house-announces-plans-to-update-the-u-s-regulatory-framework-for-biotechnology/|website=www.ofwlaw.com|accessdate=6 January 2018|date=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Argentina" /&gt;

====Canada====
Canada's food regulatory system differs from those of most other countries, and its procedures already accommodate products from any breeding technique, including NBTs. This is because its 1993 'Biotechnology Regulatory Framework' is based upon a concept of regulatory triggering based upon "Plants with Novel Traits". In other words, if a new trait does not exist within normal cultivated plant populations in Canada, then no matter how it was developed, it will trigger the normal regulatory processes and testing.&lt;ref name="Argentina" /&gt;

'''The oldest profession in the world''' (or '''the world's oldest profession''') is a phrase that, unless another meaning is specified, refers to [[prostitution]].  However, it did not acquire that meaning universally until after World War I. Formerly, various professions vied for the reputation of being the oldest.

==Earlier sense==
The claim to be the oldest profession was made on behalf of farmers,&lt;ref&gt;"The farmer, therefore, can boast of being a member of the oldest profession" (Annual Report of the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture, Michigan, 1878).&lt;/ref&gt; [[droving|cattle drovers]],&lt;ref&gt;"He reminded his audience that theirs was the very oldest profession in the world" (Bury and Norwich Post, Suffolk, 19 June 1883, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[horticulture|horticulturalists]],&lt;ref&gt;"… certainly we are representatives of the oldest profession of which we have any knowledge" (Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Ohio State Horticultural Society, 1890, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; engineers,&lt;ref&gt;"… we belong to the oldest profession in the world" (The Stevens indicator, vol. 9, 1892, p.167).&lt;/ref&gt; [[landscape gardener]]s,&lt;ref&gt;"I need hardly speak of its antiquity, the oldest profession in the world" (Preston Chronicle, Lancashire, 9 November 1889, p.2.)&lt;/ref&gt; the military,&lt;ref&gt;Speech by Lord Wolseley, Morning Post, 21 December 1895.&lt;/ref&gt; doctors,&lt;ref&gt;''The Clinic: A Weekly Journal of Practical Medicine'', 1875, p.245.&lt;/ref&gt; [[nurses]],&lt;ref&gt;''Nursing World'', vols 21–22, 1898, p.123.&lt;/ref&gt; teachers,&lt;ref&gt;''The Ohio Educational Monthly'', vol 57, 1908, p.294.&lt;/ref&gt; [[priests]],&lt;ref&gt;''Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers'', 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; and even lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;"A lawyer, then, is a member of the oldest profession extant; for as he lives upon the rottenness of human nature, the first human crime made room for a lawyer"  (Alfred Butler, ''Elphinstone'', vol 1, 1841, p.189).&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the earliest recorded claim to be the world's oldest profession was made on behalf of [[tailors]].  The ''Song in Praise of the Merchant-Taylors'', attested from 1680, which was routinely performed at [[procession|pageants]] at the [[Lord Mayor's Show]], [[London]], if the current mayor happened to belong to the [[Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors|
tailors' guild]],&lt;ref&gt;Percy Society, ''Early English Poetry, Ballads and Popular Literature of the Middle Ages'', vol. XIX (London, 1846), p.74.&lt;/ref&gt; began:
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;Of all the professions that ever were nam'd,
The taylor's, though slighted, is much to be fam'd':
For various invention, and antiquity,
No trade with the tayler's comparèd may be:
&lt;/poem&gt;
After pointing out that [[Adam and Eve]] made garments for themselves, and were therefore tailors, it continued:
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;Then judge if a tayler was not the first trade.
The oldest profession, and they are but raylers,&lt;ref&gt;Bitter deriders or scoffers.&lt;/ref&gt;
Who scoff and deride men that be merchant-taylers.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Acquisition of opprobrious sense==
The phrase began to acquire its opprobrious sense in the last decade of the nineteenth century following [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s short story about an Indian prostitute, ''On the City Wall'' (January 1889).  Kipling, after citing a biblical reference,&lt;ref&gt;Joshua ii. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; began:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lalun is a member of the most ancient profession in the world. [[Lilith]] was her very-great-grandmamma, and that was before the days of Eve as every one knows.  In the West, people say rude things about Lalun's profession, and write lectures about it, and distribute the lectures to young persons in order that Morality may be preserved.  In the East where the profession is hereditary, descending from mother to daughter, nobody writes lectures or takes any notice; and that is a distinct proof of the inability of the East to manage its own affairs.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a scathing article on the morals of the aristocracy in the mass circulation ''Reynold's Newspaper'', 22 July 1894,&lt;ref&gt;Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; the reference was repeated:&lt;blockquote&gt;
In ancient Rome, under the empire, ladies used to go to baths to meet a certain class of men, while men resorted thither to meet a certain class of ladies.  The ladies belonged to what has been called “the oldest profession in the world", a profession which is carried on in Piccadilly, Regent street, and other parts of London with great energy every night …&lt;/blockquote&gt;  In the same year the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]''&lt;ref&gt;12 November 1894, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; reported a speech in which "Mrs. Ormiston Chant … implored us to stand shoulder to shoulder and destroy what Kipling has called 'the oldest profession in the world'".

The phrase was frequently used as a [[euphemism]] when delicacy forbade direct reference to prostitution.

Kipling was not the first to employ the phrase "the most ancient profession" in an opprobrious sense.  The Irish poet [[Henry Brooke (writer)|Henry Brooke]] (1701–1783) wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Johnson, ''The Works of English Poets, from Chaucer to Cowper'', vol 17, p.428.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;
Of all trades and arts in repute or possession,
[[Humbug]]ging is held the most ancient profession.
&lt;/poem&gt;
The phrase had also been applied to murderers.  In  ''The Secret Societies of All Ages and Countries'' (1875),&lt;ref&gt;(London, Richard Bentley and Son), vol 2, p.324.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles William Heckethorn, describing the [[Thuggee|Thugs]] of India, said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The [[hierophant]], on initiating the candidate, says to him: "Thou hast chosen, my son, the most ancient profession, the most acceptable to the deity.  Thou hast sworn to put to death every human being fate throws into thy hand..."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Residual usage of the phrase in its reputable sense==
There is some evidence that unworldly speakers (e.g. of the older generation) or unsophisticated audiences (e.g. in small towns or rural areas) were not at first aware of the phrase's newly acquired meaning.  Thus for some time the following could be said in English newspaper reports without apparent embarrassment: “A certain proportion of the cadets were now leaving to enter the oldest profession in the world” (1895).&lt;ref&gt;(The profession of arms.)  Speech of Lord Wolseley to the Royal Military Academy, ''Morning Post'', 21 December 1895, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; “This gentleman's name often figures high in local prize lists, and he is considered an enthusiast in 'the oldest profession in the world'" (1902).&lt;ref&gt;(Gardener.)  ''Folkestone, Hythe, Sandgate &amp; Cheriton Herald'', 17 May 1902, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  “Mr Petrie heard the voice of God and observed the working of His hand in ways that are denied to most of us.  His speech, and especially his prayers, exhibited a rare consciousness of the beauty of holiness, and were fragrant with phrases of singular charm.  As you all know, Mr Petrie followed the oldest profession in the world” (1915).&lt;ref&gt;(Gardener).  ''Stirling Observer'', 12 November 1915, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, those 'innocent' uses of the phrase tended to die out as awareness of the newly acquired meaning increased; as did the appreciation that antiquity, of itself, did not make a profession respectable.

{{Other uses|Ornament (disambiguation){{!}}Ornament}}
In [[architecture]] and [[decorative art]], '''ornament''' is a decoration used to [[embellish]] parts of a building or object.  Large figurative elements such as [[monumental sculpture]] and their equivalents in decorative art are excluded from the term; most ornament does not include human figures, and if present they are small compared to the overall scale. Architectural ornament can be carved from stone, wood or precious metals, formed with plaster or clay, or painted or impressed onto a surface as '''applied ornament'''; in other [[applied arts]] the main material of the object, or a different one such as paint or [[vitreous enamel]] may be used.  

A wide variety of decorative styles and [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] have been developed for architecture and the applied arts, including [[pottery]], [[furniture]], [[metalwork]]. In [[textiles]], [[wallpaper]] and other objects where the decoration may be the main justification for its existence, the terms pattern or design are more likely to be used.  The vast range of motifs used in ornament draw from geometrical shapes and patterns, plants, and human and animal figures.  Across [[Eurasia]] and the [[Mediterranean]] world there has been a rich and linked tradition of plant-based ornament for over three thousand years; traditional ornament from other parts of the world typically relies more on geometrical and animal motifs.  

In a 1941 essay,&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, John (1941) printed in ''Heavenly Mansions'' 1963, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; the architectural historian Sir [[John Summerson]] called it "surface modulation". The earliest decoration and ornament often survives from prehistoric cultures in simple markings on pottery, where decoration in other materials (including [[tattoo]]s) has been lost. Where the [[potter's wheel]] was used, the technology made some kinds of decoration very easy; [[weaving]] is another technology which also lends itself very easily to decoration or pattern, and to some extent dictates its form. Ornament has been evident in [[civilization]]s since the beginning of [[recorded history]], ranging from [[Ancient Egyptian architecture]] to the assertive lack of ornament of 20th century [[Modernism|Modernist architecture]].

Ornament implies that the ornamented object has a function that an unornamented equivalent might also fulfill.  Where the object has no such function, but exists only to be a [[work of art]] such as a [[sculpture]] or painting, the term is less likely to be used, except for peripheral elements. In recent centuries a distinction between the [[fine arts]] and applied or [[decorative arts]] has been applied (except for architecture), with ornament mainly seen as a feature of the latter class.

The history of art in many cultures shows a series of wave-like trends where the level of ornament used increases over a period, before a sharp reaction returns to plainer forms, after which ornamentation gradually increases again. The pattern is especially clear in post-Roman European art, where the highly ornamented [[Insular art]] of the [[Book of Kells]] and other manuscripts influenced continental Europe, but the classically inspired [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]] largely replaced it. Ornament increased over the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] periods, but was greatly reduced in [[Renaissance art|Early Renaissance]] styles, again under classical influence. Another period of increase, in [[Northern Mannerism]], the [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]], was checked by [[Neoclassicism]] and the [[Romantic period]], before resuming in the later 19th century [[Victorian decorative arts]] and their continental equivalents, to be decisively reduced by the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] and then [[Modernism]]. 
  
The detailed study of Eurasian ornamental forms was begun by [[Alois Riegl]] in his [[formalism (art)|formalist]] study ''[[Stilfragen]]: Grundlegungen zu einer Geschichte der Ornamentik'' (''Problems of style: foundations for a history of ornament'') of 1893, who in the process developed his influential concept of the ''Kunstwollen''.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa, 74-75&lt;/ref&gt;  Riegl traced formalistic continuity and development in decorative plant forms from [[Ancient Egyptian art]] and other ancient Near Eastern civilizations through the classical world to the [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] of [[Islamic art]].  While the concept of the ''Kunstwollen'' has few followers today, his basic analysis of the development of forms has been confirmed and refined by the wider ''corpus'' of examples known today.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 24-25; see also [http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/-8220-Style-8221-151-or-whatever-4745 "“Style”—or whatever", J. Duncan Berry], A review of ''Problems of Style'' by Alois Riegl, ''[[The New Criterion]]'', April 1993&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jessica Rawson]] has recently extended the analysis to cover [[Chinese art]], which Riegl did not cover, tracing many elements of Chinese decoration back to the same tradition; the shared background helping to make the assimilation of Chinese motifs into Persian art after the [[Mongol invasion of Persia|Mongol invasion]] harmonious and productive.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, the subject of her book, see Preface, and Chapter 5 on Chinese influences on Persian art.&lt;/ref&gt;

Styles of ornamentation can be studied in reference to the specific [[Cultural heritage|culture]] which developed unique forms of decoration, or modified ornament from other cultures. The [[Ancient Egypt]]ian culture is arguably the first civilization to add pure decoration to their buildings. Their ornament takes the forms of the natural world in that climate, decorating the capitals of columns and walls with images of papyrus and palm trees. [[Assyria]]n culture produced ornament which shows influence from Egyptian sources and a number of original themes, including figures of plants and animals of the region.

[[Ancient Greek]] civilization created many new forms of ornament, with regional variations from [[Doric order|Doric]], [[Ionic order|Ionic]], and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] groups.  The [[Ancient Roman|Romans]] [[romanization (cultural)|Latinized]] the pure forms of the Greek ornament and adapted the forms to every purpose.

==Ornament prints and pattern books==
[[File:Orna103-Simaornamente.png|thumb|right|Elaborated versions of Greco-Roman classical architectural ornaments in ''[[:commons:Category:Meyer's Ornament|Meyer's Ornament]]'']]
[[File:FroissartOurs.jpg|thumb|A detail from the margin of a page of [[Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF Fr 2643-6)|a Late Gothic manuscript]]]]
A few medieval notebooks survive, most famously that of [[Villard de Honnecourt]] (13th century) showing how artists and craftsmen recorded designs they saw for future use. With the arrival of the [[old master print|print]] [[ornament print]]s became an important part of the output of printmakers, especially in Germany, and played a vital role in the rapid diffusion of new Renaissance styles to makers of all sorts of object. As well as revived classical ornament, both architectural and the [[grotesque]] style derived from Roman interior decoration, these included new styles such as the [[moresque]], a European adaptation of the Islamic arabesque (a distinction not always clear at the time). 

As printing became cheaper, the single ornament print turned into sets, and then finally books.  From the 16th to the 19th century, [[pattern book]]s were published in Europe which gave access to decorative elements, eventually including those recorded from cultures all over the world. Andrea Palladio's [[I quattro libri dell'architettura]] (Four Books on Architecture) (Venice, 1570),&lt;ref&gt;[[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]],[http://www.palladiancenter.org/palladiobooks.html "Palladio and his Books."]&lt;/ref&gt; which included both drawings of classical Roman buildings and renderings of Palladio's own designs utilizing those motifs, became the most influential book ever written on architecture. Napoleon had the great pyramids and temples of Egypt documented in the ''[[Description de l'Egypte (1809)]]''. [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]] published ''[[The Grammar of Ornament]]'' in 1856 with colored illustrations of decoration from Egypt, Turkey, Sicily and Spain. He took residence in the [[Alhambra|Alhambra Palace]] to make drawings and plaster castings of the ornate details of the [[Islamic art|Islamic ornaments]] there, including [[arabesque]]s, [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], and [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]]. Interest in [[classical architecture]] was also fueled by the tradition of traveling on [[Grand Tour|The Grand Tour]], and by translation of early literature about architecture in the work of [[Vitruvius]] and [[Michelangelo]].

During the 19th century, the acceptable use of ornament, and its precise definition became the source of aesthetic controversy in academic Western architecture, as architects and their critics searched for a suitable style. "The great question is," [[Thomas Leverton Donaldson]] asked in 1847, "are we to have an architecture of our period, a distinct, individual, palpable style of the 19th century?".&lt;ref&gt;quoted by Summerson&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849, when [[Matthew Digby Wyatt]] viewed the [[French Industrial Exposition of 1844|French Industrial Exposition]] set up on the [[Champs-Elysées]] in Paris, he disapproved in recognizably modern terms of the plaster ornaments in faux-bronze and faux woodgrain:&lt;ref&gt;[http://charon.sfsu.edu/publications/ParisExpositions/SecondRepublicExpo.html Second Republic Exposition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212102110/http://charon.sfsu.edu/publications/ParisExpositions/SecondRepublicExpo.html |date=2006-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Both internally and externally there is a good deal of tasteless and unprofitable ornament... If each simple material had been allowed to tell its own tale, and the lines of the construction so arranged as to conduce to a sentiment of grandeur, the qualities of "power" and "truth," which its enormous extent must have necessarily ensured, could have scarcely fail to excite admiration, and that at a very considerable saving of expense. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Contacts with other cultures through [[colonialism]] and the new discoveries of [[archaeology]] expanded the repertory of ornament available to revivalists. After about 1880, photography made details of ornament even more widely available than prints had done.

==Modern ornament==
Modern [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]] ornaments are made of wood, plastics, composites, etc. They come in many different colours and shapes.
[[Modern architecture]], conceived of as the elimination of ornament in favor of purely functional structures, left architects the problem of how to properly adorn modern structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sankovitch | first=Anne-Marie | title=Structure/ornament and the modern figuration of architecture | url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-54073966.html | date= 12/1/1998 | publisher= The Art Bulletin| accessdate=2007-11-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071107140938/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-54073966.html |archivedate = November 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were two available routes from this perceived crisis. One was to attempt to devise an ornamental vocabulary that was new and essentially contemporary. This was the route taken by architects like [[Louis Sullivan]] and his pupil [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], or by the unique [[Antoni Gaudí]]. [[Art Nouveau]], for all its excesses, was a conscious effort to evolve such a "natural" vocabulary of ornament.

A more radical route abandoned the use of ornament altogether, as in some designs for objects by [[Christopher Dresser]]. At the time, such unornamented objects could have been found in many unpretending workaday items of industrial design, ceramics produced at the Arabia manufactory in Finland, for instance, or the glass insulators of electric lines.

This latter approach was described by architect [[Adolf Loos]] in his 1908 manifesto, translated into English in 1913 and polemically titled ''[[Ornament and Crime]]'', in which he declared that lack of decoration is the sign of an advanced society.  His argument was that ornament is economically inefficient and "morally degenerate", and that reducing ornament was a sign of progress. Modernists were eager to point to American architect [[Louis Sullivan]] as their godfather in the cause of aesthetic simplification, dismissing the knots of intricately patterned ornament that articulated the skin of his structures.

With the work of [[Le Corbusier]] and the [[Bauhaus]] through the 1920s and 1930s, lack of decorative detail became a hallmark of [[modern architecture]] and equated with the moral virtues of honesty, simplicity, and purity.  In 1932 [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Henry-Russell Hitchcock]] dubbed this the "[[International style (architecture)|International Style]]".  What began as a matter of taste was transformed into an aesthetic mandate.  Modernists declared their way as the only acceptable way to build.  As the style hit its stride in the highly developed postwar work of [[Mies van der Rohe]], the tenets of 1950s modernism became so strict that even accomplished architects like [[Edward Durrell Stone]] and [[Eero Saarinen]] could be ridiculed and effectively ostracized for departing from the aesthetic rules.  {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

At the same time, the unwritten laws against ornament began to come into serious question.  "Architecture has, with some difficulty, liberated itself from ornament, but it has not liberated itself from the ''fear'' of ornament," [[John Summerson]] observed in 1941. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.paulshepheard.com/words/slogans-and-battlecries/|title=Slogans and Battlecries {{!}} Paul Shepheard {{!}} Architect {{!}} Writer|website=www.paulshepheard.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The very difference between ornament and structure is subtle and perhaps arbitrary.  The pointed arches and flying buttresses of [[Gothic architecture]] are ornamental but structurally necessary; the colorful rhythmic bands of a [[Pietro Belluschi]] International Style skyscraper are integral, not applied, but certainly have ornamental effect. Furthermore, architectural ornament can serve the practical purpose of establishing scale, signaling entries, and aiding wayfinding, and these useful design tactics had been outlawed.  And by the mid-1950s, modernist figureheads [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Marcel Breuer]] had been breaking their own rules by producing highly expressive, sculptural concrete work.

The argument against ornament peaked in 1959 over discussions of the [[Seagram Building]], where [[Mies van der Rohe]] installed a series of structurally unnecessary vertical I-beams on the outside of the building, and by 1984, when [[Philip Johnson]] produced his AT&amp;T Building in Manhattan with an ornamental pink granite neo-Georgian pediment, the argument was effectively over.  In retrospect, critics have seen the [[Sony Building (New York)|AT&amp;T Building]] as the first [[Postmodernist]] building. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

'''Ozone''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|z|oʊ|n}}, or '''trioxygen''', is an inorganic [[molecule]] with the [[chemical formula]] '''{{Chem|O|3|}}'''. It is a pale blue gas with a distinctively [[pungent]] smell. It is an [[allotrope]] of [[oxygen]] that is much less stable than the [[diatomic]] allotrope {{Chem|O|2}}, breaking down in the lower atmosphere to {{Chem|O|2}} or [[dioxygen]]. Ozone is formed from dioxygen by the action of [[ultraviolet light]] (UV) and  electrical discharges within the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. It is present in very low concentrations throughout the latter, with its highest concentration high in the [[ozone layer]] of the [[stratosphere]], which absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation.

Ozone's odour is reminiscent of [[chlorine]], and detectable by many people at concentrations of as little as {{val|0.1|ul=ppm}} in air. Ozone's O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; structure was determined in 1865. The molecule was later proven to have a bent structure and to be [[diamagnetic]]. In [[standard conditions]], ozone is a pale blue gas that condenses at progressively cryogenic temperatures to a dark blue [[liquid]] and finally a violet-black [[solid]]. Ozone's instability with regard to more common dioxygen is such that both concentrated gas and liquid ozone may decompose explosively at elevated temperatures or fast warming to the boiling point.&lt;ref name=streng&gt;{{Cite journal

It is therefore used commercially only in low concentrations.

Ozone is a powerful [[Oxidizing agent|oxidant]] (far more so than dioxygen) and has many industrial and consumer applications related to oxidation. This same high oxidising potential, however, causes ozone to damage mucous and respiratory tissues in animals, and also tissues in plants, above concentrations of about {{val|0.1|u=ppm}}. While this makes ozone a potent respiratory hazard and pollutant near ground level, a higher concentration in the ozone layer (from two to eight ppm) is beneficial, preventing damaging UV light from reaching the Earth's surface.

==Nomenclature==
The [[trivial name]] ''ozone'' is the most commonly used and [[preferred IUPAC name]]. The systematic names ''2λ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-trioxidiene'' and ''catena-trioxygen'', valid [[IUPAC]] names, are constructed according to the substitutive and additive nomenclatures, respectively. The name ''ozone'' derives from ''ozein'' (ὄζειν), the [[greek language|Greek]] verb for smell, referring to ozone's distinctive smell.

In appropriate contexts, ozone can be viewed as [[trioxidane]] with two hydrogen atoms removed, and as such, ''trioxidanylidene'' may be used as a context-specific systematic name, according to substitutive nomenclature. By default, these names pay no regard to the radicality of the ozone molecule. In even more specific context, this can also name the non-radical singlet ground state, whereas the diradical state is named ''trioxidanediyl''.

''Trioxidanediyl'' (or ''ozonide'') is used, non-systematically, to refer to the substituent group (-OOO-). Care should be taken to avoid confusing the name of the group for the context-specific name for ozone given above.

==History==
[[File:Schönbein.jpg|right|thumb|[[Christian Friedrich Schönbein]] (18 October 1799 – 29 August 1868)]]
[[File:Smyths revised ozonometer, 1865. (9660571191).jpg|right|thumb|A prototype ozonometer built by John Smyth in 1865]]
In 1785, the Dutch chemist [[Martinus van Marum]] was conducting experiments involving electrical sparking above water when he noticed an unusual smell, which he attributed to the electrical reactions, failing to realize that he had in fact created ozone.&lt;ref name="colostate"/&gt; 

A half century later, [[Christian Friedrich Schönbein]] noticed the same pungent odour and recognized it as the smell often following a bolt of [[lightning]]. In 1839, he succeeded in isolating the gaseous chemical and named it "ozone", from the Greek word ''{{lang|el|ozein}}'' ({{lang|el|ὄζειν}}) meaning "to smell".&lt;ref name="ozo"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rubin |first=Mordecai B.|year=2001 |title=The History of Ozone: The Schönbein Period, 1839–1868 |journal=[[Bull.

For much of the second half of the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth, ozone was considered a healthy component of the environment by naturalists and health-seekers. [[Beaumont, California|Beaumont]], [[California]] had as its official slogan "Beaumont: Zone of Ozone", as evidenced on postcards and Chamber of Commerce letterhead.&lt;ref&gt;Redlands Chamber of Commerce Collection, City Archives, A.K. Smiley Public Library, Redlands, CA&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalists working outdoors often considered the higher elevations beneficial because of their ozone content. "There is quite a different atmosphere [at higher elevation] with enough ozone to sustain the necessary energy [to work]", wrote naturalist [[Henry Henshaw]], working in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Henshaw to William Brewster, July 2, 1902, Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; Seaside air was considered to be healthy because of its believed ozone content; but the smell giving rise to this belief is in fact that of halogenated seaweed metabolites.&lt;ref name="ashfield"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/6044238/The-science-behind-that-fresh-seaside-smell.html|title=The science behind that fresh seaside smell|accessdate=|work = The Telegraph |last = O'Connell|first = Sanjida|date = 18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of ozone's appeal seems to have resulted from its "fresh" smell, which evoked associations with purifying properties. Scientists, however, noted its harmful effects. In 1873 [[James Dewar]] and [[John Gray McKendrick]] documented that frogs grew sluggish, birds gasped for breath, and rabbits’ blood showed decreased levels of oxygen after exposure to "ozonized air", which "exercised a destructive action".&lt;ref name="Anstie"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anstie|first1=Francis|title=Clinic of the Month: Dr. McKendrick on Ozone|journal=The Practitioner: A Journal of Therapeutics and Public Health|date=1874|volume=12|issue=January–June|page=123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CrsvAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt; Schönbein himself reported that chest pains, irritation of the [[mucous membranes]] and difficulty breathing occurred as a result of inhaling ozone, and small mammals died.&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Mordecai B.|title=THE HISTORY OF OZONE.

The only thoroughly well-ascertained knowledge concerning the physiological effect of ozone, so far attained, is that it causes irritation and œdema of the lungs, and death if inhaled in relatively strong concentration for any time."&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=L.|last2=Flack|first2=M.|title=The Physiological Influence of Ozone|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=28 December 1911|volume=84|issue=573|pages=404–415|doi=10.1098/rspb.1911.0086|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/84/573/404|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], ozone was tested at [[Queen Alexandra's Military Hospital]] in London as a possible [[disinfectant]] for wounds.  The gas was applied directly to wounds for as long as 15 minutes. This resulted in damage to both bacterial cells and human tissue. Other sanitizing techniques, such as irrigation with [[antiseptics]], were found preferable.&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoker"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stoker |first=George | title=The Surgical Uses of Ozone| journal =Lancet |volume=188 |issue=4860 | year = 1916 | page = 712 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)31717-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical properties==
Ozone is colourless or pale blue gas (blue when liquefied), slightly soluble in water and much more soluble in inert non-polar solvents such as [[carbon tetrachloride]] or fluorocarbons, in which it forms a blue solution. At {{convert|161|K}}, it condenses to form a dark blue [[liquid]]. It is dangerous to allow this liquid to warm to its boiling point, because both concentrated gaseous ozone and liquid ozone can detonate. At temperatures below {{convert|80|K}}, it forms a violet-black [[solid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most people can detect about 0.01 μmol/mol of ozone in air where it has a very specific sharp odour somewhat resembling [[chlorine bleach]]. Exposure of 0.1 to 1 μmol/mol produces headaches, burning eyes and irritation to the respiratory passages.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite book

Even low concentrations of ozone in air are very destructive to organic materials such as latex, plastics and animal lung tissue.

Ozone is [[Diamagnetism|diamagnetic]], with all its electrons paired. In contrast, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]], containing two unpaired electrons.

==Structure==
According to experimental evidence from [[microwave spectroscopy]], ozone is a bent molecule, with C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; [[molecular symmetry|symmetry]] (similar to the [[water]] molecule). The O – O distances are {{convert|127.2|pm|Å|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The O – O – O angle is 116.78°.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0022-2852(70)90148-7 | last1 = Tanaka | first1 = Takehiko | last2 = Morino | first2 = Yonezo | year = 1970 | title = Coriolis interaction and anharmonic potential function of ozone from the microwave spectra in the excited vibrational states |journal = Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 538–551 |bibcode = 1970JMoSp..33..538T }}&lt;/ref&gt; The central atom is ''sp''² hybridized with one lone pair.

The arrangement possesses an overall [[bond order]] of 1.5 for both sides.

==Reactions==
Ozone is among the most powerful [[oxidizing]] agents known, far stronger than O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is also unstable at high concentrations, decaying into ordinary oxygen. Its [[half-life]] varies with atmospheric conditions such as temperature, humidity, and air movement. In a sealed chamber with a fan that moves the gas, ozone has a half-life of approximately one day at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Half-life time of ozone as a function of air conditions and movement McClurkin, J.D.*#1, Maier, D.E.2. {{DOI|10.5073/jka.2010.425.167.326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some unverified claims assert that ozone can have a half life of as short as thirty minutes under atmospheric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Resources/FAQs/ozone.html – Earth Science FAQ: Where can I find information about the ozone hole and ozone depletion?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601061532/http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Resources/FAQs/ozone.html |date=2006-06-01 }} ''Goddard Space Flight Center'', National Aeronautics and Space Administration, March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 {{chem|O|3}} → 3 {{chem|O|2}}

This reaction proceeds more rapidly with increasing temperature. [[Deflagration]] of ozone can be triggered by a spark and can occur in ozone concentrations of 10 [[wt%]] or higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.iitk.ac.in/che/jpg/papersb/full%20papers/K-106.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jlp.2005.07.020|title=Explosion properties of highly concentrated ozone gas|year=2005|last1=Koike|first1=K|last2=Nifuku|first2=M|last3=Izumi|first3=K|last4=Nakamura|first4=S|last5=Fujiwara|first5=S|last6=Horiguchi|first6=S|journal=Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries|volume=18|page=465|issue=4–6|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327085613/http://www.iitk.ac.in/che/jpg/papersb/full%20papers/K-106.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone can also be produced from oxygen at the anode of an electrochemical cell. This reaction can create smaller quantities of ozone for research purposes.

{{chem|O|3}}(g)  +  2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  ←→  {{chem|O|2}}(g)  +  {{chem|H|2|O}}      E°= 2.075V &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Quantitative Chemical Analysis|last=Harris|first=Daniel C.|publisher=W. H. Freeman|year=2007|isbn=9780716776949|location=|pages=279|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can be observed as an unwanted reaction in a Hoffman gas apparatus during the electrolysis of water when the voltage is set above the necessary voltage.

===With metals===
Ozone will oxidize most [[metal]]s (except [[gold]], [[platinum]], and [[iridium]]) to [[oxide]]s of the metals in their highest [[oxidation state]]. For example:

: {{chem|Cu}} + {{chem|O|3}} → {{chem|Cu|O}} + {{chem|O|2}}

===With nitrogen and carbon compounds===
Ozone also oxidizes [[nitric oxide]] to [[nitrogen dioxide]]:
: NO + {{chem|O|3}} → {{chem|N|O|2}} + {{chem|O|2}}
This reaction is accompanied by [[chemiluminescence]]. The {{chem|N|O|2}} can be further oxidized:
: {{chem|N|O|2}} + {{chem|O|3}} → {{chem|N|O|3}} + {{chem|O|2}}
The {{chem|N|O|3}} formed can react with {{chem|N|O|2}} to form {{chem|N|2|O|5|link=Dinitrogen pentoxide}}.

Solid [[nitronium perchlorate]] can be made from NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and {{chem|O|3}} gases:
: {{chem|N|O|2}} + {{chem|Cl|O|2}} + 2 {{chem|O|3}} → {{chem|N|O|2|Cl|O|4}} + 2 {{chem|O|2}}

Ozone does not react with ammonium [[Salt_(chemistry)|salt]]s, but it oxidizes [[ammonia]] to [[ammonium nitrate]]:
: 2 {{chem|N|H|3}} + 4 {{chem|O|3}} → {{chem|N|H|4|N|O|3}} + 4 {{chem|O|2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}

Ozone reacts with [[carbon]]&lt;!--graphite?--&gt; to form [[carbon dioxide]], even at room temperature:
: C + 2 {{chem|O|3}} → {{chem|C|O|2}} + 2 {{chem|O|2}}

===With sulfur compounds===
Ozone oxidises [[sulfide]]s to [[sulfate]]s. For example, [[lead(II) sulfide]] is oxidised to [[lead(II) sulfate]]:
: PbS + 4 O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → PbSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Sulfuric acid]] can be produced from ozone, water and either elemental [[sulfur]] or [[sulfur dioxide]]:
: S + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
: 3 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

In the [[gas phase]], ozone reacts with [[hydrogen sulfide]] to form sulfur dioxide:
: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

In an [[aqueous]] solution, however, two competing simultaneous reactions occur, one to produce elemental sulfur, and one to produce [[sulfuric acid]]:
: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → S + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
: 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 4 O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

===With alkenes and alkynes===
{{main|ozonolysis}}
Alkenes can be oxidatively cleaved by ozone, in a process called [[ozonolysis]], giving alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids, depending on the second step of the workup.

:[[File:Ozonolysis scheme.svg]]

Ozone can also cleave alkynes to form a [[acid anhydride]] or [[diketone]] product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bailey|first= P. S. |chapter=Chapter 2| title=Ozonation in Organic Chemistry |volume=2 |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York, NY |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-12-073102-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the reaction is performed in the presence of water, the anhydride hydrolyzes to give two [[carboxylic acid]]s.

:[[File:Ozonolysis-alkyne.png|none|450px]]

Usually ozonolysis is carried out in a solution of [[dichloromethane]], at a temperature of −78&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. After a sequence of cleavage and rearrangement, an organic ozonide is formed. With reductive workup (e.g. [[zinc]] in [[acetic acid]] or [[dimethyl sulfide]]), ketones and aldehydes will be formed, with oxidative workup (e.g. aqueous or alcoholic [[hydrogen peroxide]]), carboxylic acids will be formed.&lt;ref name="OrgChem"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other substrates===

All three [[atom]]s of ozone may also react, as in the reaction of [[tin(II) chloride]] with [[hydrochloric acid]] and ozone:
: 3 SnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 HCl + {{chem|O|3}} → 3 SnCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Iodine perchlorate can be made by treating [[iodine]] dissolved in cold [[anhydrous]] [[perchloric acid]] with ozone:
: I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 I(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

===Combustion===
Ozone can be used for [[combustion]] reactions and combustible gases; ozone provides higher temperatures than burning in [[dioxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The following is a reaction for the combustion of [[carbon subnitride]] which can also cause higher temperatures:

: 3 {{chem|C|4|N|2}} + 4 {{chem|O|3}} → 12 CO + 3 {{chem|N|2}}

Ozone can react at cryogenic temperatures. At {{convert|77|K}}, atomic [[hydrogen]] reacts with liquid ozone to form a hydrogen [[superoxide]] [[radical (chemistry)|radical]], which [[dimerizes]]:&lt;ref name="Horvath M. 1985. pg 44"&gt;{{cite book|year=1985|title=Ozone|pages=44–49|author1=Horvath M. |author2=Bilitzky L. |author3=Huttner J. |isbn=978-0-444-99625-1|publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: H + {{chem|O|3}} → HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O
: 2 HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → {{chem|H|2|O|4}}

===Reduction to ozonides===
Reduction of ozone gives the [[ozonide]] anion, O{{sup sub|−|3}}. Derivatives of this anion are explosive and must be stored at cryogenic temperatures. Ozonides for all the [[alkali metal]]s are known. KO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, RbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and CsO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be prepared from their respective superoxides:
: KO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → KO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
Although KO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be formed as above, it can also be formed from [[potassium hydroxide]] and ozone:&lt;ref&gt;{{Housecroft2nd|page=439}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: 2 KOH + 5 O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 KO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
NaO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and LiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; must be prepared by action of CsO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in liquid NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on an [[ion exchange resin]] containing Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Housecroft2nd|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: CsO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + NaO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
A solution of [[calcium]] in ammonia reacts with ozone to give to ammonium ozonide and not calcium ozonide:&lt;ref name="Horvath M. 1985. pg 44"/&gt;
: 3 Ca + 10 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 {{chem|O|3}} → Ca·6NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Ca(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

===Applications===
Ozone can be used to remove [[iron]] and [[manganese]] from [[water]], forming a [[precipitate]] which can be filtered:
: 2 Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
: 2 Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 MnO(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
Ozone will also oxidize dissolved [[hydrogen sulfide]] in water to [[sulfurous acid]]:
: 3 {{chem|O|3}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

These three reactions are central in the use of ozone based well water treatment.

Ozone will also detoxify [[cyanide]]s by converting them to [[cyanate]]s.
: CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → {{chem|CNO|-}} + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Ozone will also completely decompose [[urea]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1985|title=Ozone|pages=259, 269–270|author1=Horvath M. |author2=Bilitzky L. |author3=Huttner J. |isbn=978-0-444-99625-1|publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

==Spectroscopic properties==

Ozone is a bent [[triatomic molecule]] with three vibrational modes: the symmetric stretch (1103.157&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), bend (701.42&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and antisymmetric stretch (1042.096&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=B4000064&amp;Units=SI&amp;Mask=800#ref-1|title = Ozone |date = |accessdate = |website =NIST: National Institute of Standards and Technology |publisher =U.S. Department of Commerce |last = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The symmetric stretch and bend are weak absorbers, but the antisymmetric stretch is strong and responsible for ozone being an important minor [[greenhouse gas]]. This IR band is also used to detect ambient and atmospheric ozone although UV based measurements are more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapterurl = https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/IMOP/publications/CIMO-Guide/Ed2008Up2010/Part-I/WMO8_Ed2008_PartI_Ch16_Up2010_en.pdf|chapter= Chapter 16: Measurement of Ozone|title = Part I: Measurement of Meteorological Variables|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = World Meteorological Organization|first = |deadurl =yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160331164807/https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/IMOP/publications/CIMO-Guide/Ed2008Up2010/Part-I/WMO8_Ed2008_PartI_Ch16_Up2010_en.pdf|archivedate =31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The electronic spectrum of ozone is quite complex. An overview can be seen at the MPI Mainz UV/VIS Spectral Atlas of Gaseous Molecules of Atmospheric Interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://joseba.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/spectral_atlas_data/cross_sections_plots/Ozone/O3_overview_log.jpg|title = The MPI-Mainz UV/VIS Spectral Atlas of Gaseous Molecules of Atmospheric Interest|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Max Planck Institute – Mainz|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the bands are dissociative, meaning that the molecule falls apart to {{nobr|O + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} after absorbing a photon. The most important absorption is the Hartley band, extending from slightly above 300&amp;nbsp;nm down to slightly above 200&amp;nbsp;nm. It is this band that is responsible for absorbing UV&amp;nbsp;C in the stratosphere.

On the high wavelength side, the Hartley band transitions to the so-called Huggins band, which falls off rapidly until disappearing by ~360&amp;nbsp;nm. Above 400&amp;nbsp;nm, extending well out into the NIR, are the Chappius and Wulf bands. There, unstructured absorption bands are useful for detecting high ambient concentrations of ozone, but are so weak that they do not have much practical effect.

There are additional absorption bands in the far UV, which increase slowly from 200&amp;nbsp;nm down to reaching a maximum at ~120&amp;nbsp;nm.

==Ozone in Earth's atmosphere==
[[File:Atmospheric ozone.svg|thumb|The distribution of atmospheric ozone in partial pressure as a function of altitude]][[File:Nimbus ozone Brewer-Dobson circulation.jpg|thumb|Concentration of ozone as measured by the [[Nimbus program|Nimbus-7]] satellite]]
[[File:IM ozavg ept 200006.png|thumb|Total ozone concentration in June 2000 as measured by EP-TOMS satellite instrument]]
The standard way to express total ozone levels (the amount of ozone in a given vertical column) in the atmosphere is by using [[Dobson unit]]s. Point measurements are reported as [[mole fraction]]s in nmol/mol (parts per billion, ppb) or as [[concentration]]s in μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The study of ozone concentration in the atmosphere started in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.albany.edu/faculty/rgk/atm101/ozmeas.htm|title=Measured Ozone Depletion| work= Ozone-Information.com| accessdate=2014-01-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130914112129/http://www.albany.edu/faculty/rgk/atm101/ozmeas.htm |archivedate = 2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ozone layer===
{{Main|Ozone layer}}

====Location and production====
The highest levels of ozone in the atmosphere are in the [[stratosphere]], in a region also known as the [[ozone layer]] between about 10&amp;nbsp;km and 50&amp;nbsp;km above the surface (or between about 6 and 31 miles). However, even in this "layer", the ozone concentrations are only two to eight parts per million, so most of the oxygen there is dioxygen, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, at about 210,000 parts per million by volume.&lt;ref name=“Hultman”&gt;{{cite book | last= Hultman | first= G. Eric | date= 1980-01-01 | title= The Ozone Survival Manual |url= |location= |publisher= McGraw-Hill |page= |isbn= 9780915498734 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone in the stratosphere is mostly produced from short-wave ultraviolet rays between 240 and 160&amp;nbsp;nm. Oxygen starts to absorb weakly at 240&amp;nbsp;nm in the Herzberg bands, but most of the oxygen is dissociated by absorption in the strong '''[[Schumann–Runge bands]]''' between 200 and 160&amp;nbsp;nm where ozone does not absorb. While shorter wavelength light, extending to even the X-Ray limit, is energetic enough to dissociate molecular oxygen, there is relatively little of it, and, the strong solar emission at Lyman-alpha, 121&amp;nbsp;nm, falls at a point where molecular oxygen absorption is a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://joseba.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/spectral_atlas_data/cross_sections_plots/Oxygen/O2_Lyman%20alpha%20line_lin.jpg|title = The MPI-Mainz UV/VIS Spectral Atlas of Gaseous Molecules of Atmospheric Interest: O2, Lyman-alpha|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Keller-Rudek|first = Hannelore|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015120/http://joseba.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/spectral_atlas_data/cross_sections_plots/Oxygen/O2_Lyman%20alpha%20line_lin.jpg|archivedate = 2015-11-17|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of ozone creation and destruction is called the [[Chapman cycle]] and starts with the photolysis of molecular oxygen

:{{chem|O|2}} + [[photon]] (radiation λ &lt; 240 nm) → 2 O
followed by reaction of the oxygen atom with another molecule of oxygen to form ozone.
:O + {{chem|O|2}} + M → {{chem|O|3}} + M

where "M" denotes the third body that carries off the excess energy of the reaction. The ozone molecule can then absorb a UV-C photon and dissociate

{{chem|O|3}} → O + {{chem|O|2}} + kinetic energy

The excess kinetic energy heats the stratosphere when the O atoms and the molecular oxygen fly apart and collide with other molecules. This conversion of UV light into kinetic energy warms the stratosphere. The oxygen atoms produced in the photolysis of ozone then react back with other oxygen molecule as in the previous step to form more ozone. In the clear atmosphere, with only nitrogen and oxygen, ozone can react with the atomic oxygen to form two molecules of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:{{chem|O|3}} + O → 2 {{chem|O|2}}

An estimate of the rate of this termination step to the cycling of atomic oxygen back to ozone can be found simply by taking the ratios of the concentration of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The termination reaction is [[catalysis|catalysed]] by the presence of certain free radicals, of which the most important are hydroxyl (OH), nitric oxide (NO) and atomic chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br). In the second half of the 20th Century the amount of ozone in the stratosphere was discovered to be declining, mostly because of increasing concentrations of [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFC) and similar [[Haloalkane|chlorinated and brominated organic molecules]]. The concern over the health effects of the decline led to the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]], the ban on the production of many [[Ozone depletion|ozone depleting]] chemicals and in the first and second decade of the 21st Century the beginning of the recovery of stratospheric ozone concentrations.

====Importance to surface-dwelling life on Earth====
[[Image:Ozone altitude UV graph.svg|thumb|Levels of ozone at various altitudes and blocking of different bands of ultraviolet radiation. Essentially all UVC (100–280&amp;nbsp;nm) is blocked by dioxygen (at 100–200&amp;nbsp;nm) or by ozone (at 200–280&amp;nbsp;nm) in the atmosphere. The shorter portion of this band and even more energetic UV causes the formation of the ozone layer, when single oxygen atoms produced by UV [[photolysis]] of dioxygen (below 240&amp;nbsp;nm) react with more dioxygen. The ozone layer itself then blocks most, but not quite all, sunburn-producing UVB (280–315&amp;nbsp;nm). The band of UV closest to visible light, UVA (315–400&amp;nbsp;nm), is hardly affected by ozone, and most of it reaches the ground.]]

Ozone in the ozone layer filters out sunlight wavelengths from about 200&amp;nbsp;nm UV rays to 315&amp;nbsp;nm, with ozone peak absorption at about 250&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/cr0205255|title=Photolysis of Atmospheric Ozone in the Ultraviolet Region|year=2003|last1=Matsumi|first1=Yutaka|last2=Kawasaki|first2=Masahiro|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=103|issue=12|pages=4767–82|pmid=14664632}} See the graphical absorption of ozone in two of its absorption bands, as a function of wavelength.&lt;/ref&gt; This ozone UV absorption is important to life, since it extends the absorption of UV by ordinary oxygen and nitrogen in air (which absorb all wavelengths &lt; 200&amp;nbsp;nm) through the lower UV-C (200–280&amp;nbsp;nm) and the entire UV-B band (280–315&amp;nbsp;nm). The small unabsorbed part that remains of UV-B after passage through ozone causes sunburn in humans, and direct DNA damage in living tissues in both plants and animals. Ozone's effect on mid-range UV-B rays is illustrated by its effect on UV-B at 290&amp;nbsp;nm, which has a radiation intensity 350 million times as powerful at the top of the atmosphere as at the surface. Nevertheless, enough of UV-B radiation at similar frequency reaches the ground to cause some sunburn, and these same wavelengths are also among those responsible for the production of [[vitamin D]] in humans.

The ozone layer has little effect on the longer UV wavelengths called UV-A (315–400&amp;nbsp;nm), but this radiation does not cause sunburn or direct DNA damage, and while it probably does cause long-term skin damage in certain humans, it is not as dangerous to plants and to the health of surface-dwelling organisms on Earth in general (see [[ultraviolet]] for more information on near ultraviolet).

===Low level ozone===
{{Main|Tropospheric ozone|Photochemical smog}}

Low level ozone (or tropospheric ozone) is an atmospheric pollutant.&lt;ref name=who-Europe&gt;[http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/112199/E79097.pdf Health Aspects of Air Pollution with Particulate Matter, Ozone and Nitrogen Dioxide]. WHO-Europe report 13–15 January 2003 (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; It is not emitted directly by [[Internal combustion engine|car engines]] or by industrial operations, but formed by the reaction of sunlight on air containing [[Volatile organic compound|hydrocarbon]]s and [[nitrogen oxide]]s that react to form ozone directly at the source of the pollution or many kilometers down wind.

Ozone reacts directly with some hydrocarbons such as [[aldehyde]]s and thus begins their removal from the air, but the products are themselves key components of [[photochemical smog|smog]]. Ozone [[photolysis]] by UV light leads to production of the [[hydroxyl radical]] HO• and this plays a part in the removal of hydrocarbons from the air, but is also the first step in the creation of components of smog such as [[peroxyacyl nitrates]], which can be powerful eye irritants. The atmospheric lifetime of tropospheric ozone is about 22 days; its main removal mechanisms are being deposited to the ground, the above-mentioned reaction giving HO•, and by reactions with OH and the peroxy radical HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;•.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author =Stevenson| year=2006|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2006/2005JD006338.shtml|title=Multimodel ensemble simulations of present-day and near-future tropospheric ozone| publisher=[[American Geophysical Union]]|accessdate=2006-09-16|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence of significant reduction in agricultural yields because of increased ground-level ozone and pollution which interferes with [[photosynthesis]] and stunts overall growth of some plant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2003-07-31|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/view.php?id=23565|title=Rising Ozone Levels Pose Challenge to U.S. Soybean Production, Scientists Say|publisher=NASA Earth Observatory|accessdate=2006-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arb.ca.gov"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mutters|first=Randall|date=March 1999|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/research/abstracts/94-345.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040217151427/http://www.arb.ca.gov/research/abstracts/94-345.htm|archivedate=2004-02-17|title=Statewide Potential Crop Yield Losses From Ozone Exposure|publisher=California Air Resources Board|accessdate=2006-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] is proposing a secondary regulation to reduce crop damage, in addition to the primary regulation designed for the protection of human health.

Certain examples of cities with elevated ozone readings are [[Houston, Texas]], and [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]. Houston has a reading of around 41 nmol/mol, while Mexico City is far more hazardous, with a reading of about 125 nmol/mol.&lt;ref name="arb.ca.gov"/&gt;

====Ozone cracking====
[[File:Ozone cracks in tube1.jpg|thumb|right|Ozone cracking in [[natural rubber]] tubing]]
Ozone gas attacks any [[polymer]] possessing olefinic or [[double bond]]s within its chain structure, such as [[natural rubber]], [[nitrile rubber]], and [[styrene-butadiene]] rubber. Products made using these polymers are especially susceptible to attack, which causes cracks to grow longer and deeper with time, the rate of crack growth depending on the load carried by the rubber component and the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere. Such materials can be protected by adding [[antiozonant]]s, such as waxes, which bond to the surface to create a protective film or blend with the material and provide long term protection. [[Ozone cracking]] used to be a serious problem in car tires,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Layer|first1=Robert W.|last2= Lattimer|first2= Robert P.|title = Protection of Rubber against Ozone|journal = Rubber Chemistry and Technology|date = July 1990|volume = 63|number =3|pages = 426-450| doi = 10.5254/1.3538264}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, but it is not an issue with modern tires. On the other hand, many critical products, like [[gasket]]s and [[O-ring]]s, may be attacked by ozone produced within compressed air systems. [[Fuel line]]s made of reinforced rubber are also susceptible to attack, especially within the engine compartment, where some ozone is produced by electrical components. Storing rubber products in close proximity to a [[Direct Current|DC]] [[electric motor]] can accelerate ozone cracking. The [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] of the motor generates sparks which in turn produce ozone.

====Ozone as a greenhouse gas====
Although ozone was present at ground level before the [[Industrial Revolution]], peak concentrations are now far higher than the pre-industrial levels, and even background concentrations well away from sources of pollution are substantially higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=1998|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/TOP08-98/page004.html|title=Tropospheric Ozone in EU – The consolidated report|publisher=European Environmental Agency|accessdate=2006-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atmospheric Chemistry and Greenhouse Gases|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/142.htm|publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|accessdate=2006-05-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710143636/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/142.htm|archivedate=2006-07-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozone acts as a [[greenhouse gas]], absorbing some of the [[infrared]] energy emitted by the earth. Quantifying the greenhouse gas potency of ozone is difficult because it is not present in uniform concentrations across the globe. However, the most widely accepted scientific assessments relating to [[climate change]] (e.g. the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] [[Third Assessment Report]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2001|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/|title=Climate Change 2001|publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|accessdate=2006-09-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913043522/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/|archivedate=2006-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that the [[radiative forcing]] of tropospheric ozone is about 25% that of [[carbon dioxide]].

The annual [[global warming potential]] of tropospheric ozone is between 918–1022 tons [[carbon dioxide equivalent]]/tons tropospheric ozone. This means on a per-molecule basis, ozone in the troposphere has a [[radiative forcing]] effect roughly 1,000 times as strong as [[carbon dioxide]]. However, tropospheric ozone is a short-lived [[greenhouse gas]], which decays in the atmosphere much more quickly than [[carbon dioxide]]. This means that over a 20-year span, the [[global warming potential]] of tropospheric ozone is much less, roughly 62 to 69 tons [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] / ton tropospheric ozone.&lt;ref&gt;Life Cycle Assessment Methodology Sufficient to Support Public Declarations and Claims, Committee Draft Standard, Version 2.1. Scientific Certification Systems, February 2011. Annex B, Section 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its short-lived nature, tropospheric ozone does not have strong global effects, but has very strong radiative forcing effects on regional scales. In fact, there are regions of the world where tropospheric ozone has a [[radiative forcing]] up to 150% of [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://acdb-ext.gsfc.nasa.gov/Data_services/cloud_slice/ NASA GODDARD HOMEPAGE FOR TROPOSPHERIC OZONE NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Code 613.3, Chemistry and Dynamics Branch].

[[Ozone precursors]] are a group of pollutants, predominantly those emitted during the combustion of [[fossil fuels]]. Ground-level ozone pollution ([[tropospheric ozone]]) is created near the Earth's surface by the action of daylight [[ultraviolet|UV]] rays on these precursors. The ozone at ground level is primarily from fossil fuel precursors, but [[methane]] is a natural precursor, and the very low natural background level of ozone at ground level is considered safe. This section examines the health impacts of fossil fuel burning, which raises ground level ozone far above background levels.

There is a great deal of evidence to show that ground-level ozone can harm lung function and irritate the [[respiratory system]].&lt;ref name="who-Europe"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euro.who.int/document/E82790.pdf Answer to follow-up questions from CAFE (2004)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050909162153/http://www.euro.who.int/document/E82790.pdf |date=2005-09-09 }} (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to ozone (and the pollutants that produce it) is linked to premature [[death]], [[asthma]], [[bronchitis]], [[heart attack]], and other cardiopulmonary problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=[[EPA]] Course Developers |title=Health Effects of Ozone in the General Population |url=https://www.epa.gov/ozone-pollution-and-your-patients-health/health-effects-ozone-general-population |publisher=[[EPA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18629332"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weinhold B |title=Ozone nation: EPA standard panned by the people |journal=Environ.

Long-term exposure to ozone has been shown to increase risk of death from [[respiratory illness]]. A study of 450,000 people living in United States cities saw a significant correlation between ozone levels and respiratory illness over the 18-year follow-up period.

Air quality guidelines such as those from the [[World Health Organization]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and the [[European Union]] are based on detailed studies designed to identify the levels that can cause measurable ill [[health effect]]s.

Whilst the directive requires in the future a strict compliance with 120&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; limit (i.e. mean ozone concentration not to be exceeded on any day of the year), there is no date set for this requirement and this is treated as a long-term objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:152:0001:0044:EN:PDF |publisher=EC |accessdate=2010-08-23 |date=2008-06-11 |title=DIRECTIVE 2008/50/EC on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USA, the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] directs the EPA to set [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] for several pollutants, including ground-level ozone, and counties out of compliance with these standards are required to take steps to reduce their levels. In May 2008, under a court order, the EPA lowered its ozone standard from 80 nmol/mol to 75 nmol/mol. The move proved controversial, since the Agency's own scientists and advisory board had recommended lowering the standard to 60 nmol/mol.&lt;ref name="pmid18629332"/&gt; Many public health and environmental groups also supported the 60 nmol/mol standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Comments of the American Lung Association, Environmental Defense, Sierra Club on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Proposed Revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone July 11, 2007 – 72 FR 37818 |url=http://www.lungusa.org/get-involved/advocate/advocacy-documents/Comments-to-the-Environmental-Protection-Agency-re-National-Ambient-Air-Quality-Standard-for-Ozone.PDF |format=PDF |publisher=Lungusa.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710051224/http://www.lungusa.org/get-involved/advocate/advocacy-documents/Comments-to-the-Environmental-Protection-Agency-re-National-Ambient-Air-Quality-Standard-for-Ozone.PDF |archivedate=July 10, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Health Organization]] recommends 51 nmol/mol.

On January 7, 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced proposed revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for the pollutant ozone, the principal component of smog:

:... EPA proposes that the level of the 8-hour primary standard, which was set at 0.075 μmol/mol in the 2008 final rule, should instead be set at a lower level within the range of 0.060 to 0.070 μmol/mol, to provide increased protection for children and other ‘‘at risk’’ populations against an array of {{Chem|O|3}} – related adverse health effects that range from decreased lung function and increased respiratory symptoms to serious indicators of respiratory morbidity including emergency department visits and hospital admissions for respiratory causes, and possibly cardiovascular-related morbidity as well as total non- accidental and cardiopulmonary mortality....&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/ozonepollution/fr/20100119.pdf National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone]. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Proposed rule&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, 2015, the EPA published a final rule with an effective date of December 28, 2015 that revised the 8-hour primary NAAQS from 0.075 ppm to 0.070 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/10/26/2015-26594/national-ambient-air-quality-standards-for-ozone|title=Federal Register {{!}} National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone|website=www.federalregister.gov|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA has developed an [[Air Quality Index]] (AQI) to help explain air pollution levels to the general public. Under the current standards, eight-hour average ozone mole fractions of 85 to 104 nmol/mol are described as "unhealthy for sensitive groups", 105 nmol/mol to 124 nmol/mol as "unhealthy", and 125 nmol/mol to 404 nmol/mol as "very unhealthy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airinfonow.org/html/ed_ozone.html What is Ozone?] airinfonow.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone can also be present in [[indoor air pollution]], partly as a result of electronic equipment such as photocopiers. A connection has also been known to exist between the increased pollen, fungal spores, and ozone caused by thunderstorms and hospital admissions of [[asthma]] sufferers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=W. |last =Anderson |author2=G.J.

In the [[Victorian era]], one British folk myth held that the smell of the sea was caused by ozone. In fact, the characteristic "smell of the sea" is caused by [[dimethyl sulfide]], a chemical generated by [[phytoplankton]]. Victorian British folk considered the resulting smell "bracing".&lt;ref&gt;University of East Anglia press release, [http://www.uea.ac.uk/env/research/reshigh/cloning Cloning the smell of the seaside], February 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heat waves====
Ozone production rises during heat waves, because plants absorb less ozone. It is estimated that curtailed ozone absorption by plants was responsible for the loss of 460 lives in the UK in the hot summer of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Physiology===
{{See also|Trioxidane}}
Ozone, along with reactive forms of oxygen such as [[superoxide]], [[singlet oxygen]], [[hydrogen peroxide]], and [[hypochlorite]] ions, is produced by [[white blood cell]]s and other biological systems (such as the roots of [[Tagetes|marigold]]s) as a means of destroying foreign bodies. Ozone reacts directly with organic double bonds. Also, when ozone breaks down to dioxygen it gives rise to oxygen [[free radical]]s, which are highly reactive and capable of damaging many [[Organic compound|organic molecules]]. Moreover, it is believed that the powerful oxidizing properties of ozone may be a contributing factor of [[inflammation]]. The cause-and-effect relationship of how the ozone is created in the body and what it does is still under consideration and still subject to various interpretations, since other body chemical processes can trigger some of the same reactions. A team headed by Paul Wentworth Jr. of the Department of Chemistry at the [[Scripps Research Institute]] has shown evidence linking the antibody-catalyzed water-oxidation pathway of the human [[Immune system|immune response]] to the production of ozone. In this system, ozone is produced by antibody-catalyzed production of [[trioxidane]] from water and neutrophil-produced singlet oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Story of O| first=Roald |last=Hoffmann| journal=American Scientist|volume=92|issue= 1|page=23|date=January 2004|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/29647?&amp;print=yes| doi=10.1511/2004.1.23 |accessdate=2006-10-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060925011907/http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/29647?&amp;print=yes |archivedate = 2006-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When inhaled, ozone reacts with compounds lining the lungs to form specific, cholesterol-derived metabolites that are thought to facilitate the build-up and pathogenesis of [[atherosclerotic plaques]] (a form of [[heart disease]]). These metabolites have been confirmed as naturally occurring in human atherosclerotic arteries and are categorized into a class of secosterols termed ''[[atheronals]]'', generated by [[ozonolysis]] of cholesterol's double bond to form a [[atheronals|5,6 secosterol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Smith|first = LL|title = Oxygen, oxysterols, ouabain, and ozone: a cautionary tale|journal = Free Radical Biology &amp; Medicine|volume = 37|issue = 3|pages = 318–24 |year = 2004|pmid = 15223065|doi = 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2004.04.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a secondary condensation product via aldolization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evidence for Ozone Formation in Human Atherosclerotic Arteries|doi=10.1126/science.1089525|author=Paul Wentworth|year=2003|journal=Science|volume=302|pmid=14605372|last2=Nieva|first2=J|last3=Takeuchi|first3=C|last4=Galve|first4=R|last5=Wentworth|first5=AD|last6=Dilley|first6=RB|last7=Delaria|first7=GA|last8=Saven|first8=A|last9=Babior|first9=BM|last10=Janda|first10=K.

Ozone has been implicated to have an adverse effect on plant growth: "... ozone reduced total chlorophylls, carotenoid and carbohydrate concentration, and increased 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) content and ethylene production. In treated plants, the ascorbate leaf pool was decreased, while lipid peroxidation and solute leakage were significantly higher than in ozone-free controls. The data indicated that ozone triggered protective mechanisms against oxidative stress in citrus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Iglesias |first = Domingo J. |author2=Ángeles Calatayuda |author3=Eva Barrenob |author4=Eduardo Primo-Milloa |author5=Manuel Talon|title = Responses of citrus plants to ozone: leaf biochemistry, antioxidant mechanisms and lipid peroxidation|journal = Plant Physiology and Biochemistry|volume = 44|issue = 2–3|pages = 125–131|year = 2006|doi = 10.1016/j.plaphy.2006.03.007|pmid = 16644230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety regulations===
Because of the strongly oxidizing properties of ozone, ozone is a primary irritant, affecting especially the eyes and respiratory systems and can be hazardous at even low concentrations. The Canadian Centre for Occupation Safety and Health reports that: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Even very low concentrations of ozone can be harmful to the upper respiratory tract and the lungs. The severity of injury depends on both by the concentration of ozone and the duration of exposure. Severe and permanent lung injury or death could result from even a very short-term exposure to relatively low concentrations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-o-zone.cc/research/abstracts/OSHC.pdf What are the main health hazards associated with breathing in ozone?], Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; To protect workers potentially exposed to ozone, [[U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] has established a permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 0.1 μmol/mol (29 CFR 1910.1000 table Z-1), calculated as an 8-hour time weighted average. Higher concentrations are especially hazardous and [[NIOSH]] has established an Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health Limit (IDLH) of 5 μmol/mol.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html Documentation for Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLH)]: NIOSH Chemical Listing and Documentation of Revised IDLH Values (as of 3/1/95)&lt;/ref&gt; Work environments where ozone is used or where it is likely to be produced should have adequate ventilation and it is prudent to have a monitor for ozone that will alarm if the concentration exceeds the OSHA PEL. Continuous monitors for ozone are available from several suppliers.

Elevated ozone exposure can occur on [[passenger aircraft]], with levels depending on altitude and atmospheric turbulence.&lt;ref name="portfolio"&gt;Lai, Jennifer.

==Production==
[[File:THC 2003.902.021 E. H. Johnson Ozone Production.jpg|thumb|right | Ozone production demonstration, Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory, 1926]]

Ozone generators are used to produce ozone for cleaning air or removing smoke odours in unoccupied rooms. These ozone generators can produce over 3 g of ozone per hour. Ozone often forms in nature under conditions where O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will not react.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt; Ozone used in industry is measured in μmol/mol (ppm, parts per million), nmol/mol (ppb, parts per billion), μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, mg/h (milligrams per hour) or weight percent. The regime of applied concentrations ranges from 1% to 5% (in air) and from 6% to 14% (in oxygen) for older generation methods. New electrolytic methods can achieve up 20% to 30% dissolved ozone concentrations in output water.

Temperature and humidity play a large role in how much ozone is being produced using traditional generation methods (such as corona discharge and ultraviolet light). Old generation methods will produce less than 50% of nominal capacity if operated with humid ambient air, as opposed to very dry air. New generators, using electrolytic methods, can achieve higher purity and dissolution through using water molecules as the source of ozone production.

===Corona discharge method===
[[File:Shkarkese elektrike.jpg|thumb|A homemade ozone generator. Ozone is produced in the corona discharge|alt=]]
This is the most common type of ozone generator for most industrial and personal uses. While variations of the "hot spark" coronal discharge method of ozone production exist, including medical grade and industrial grade ozone generators, these units usually work by means of a [[Corona discharge|corona discharge tube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|author=Smith, L. I.; Greenwood, F. L. and Hudrlik, O. |collvol=3|collvolpages=673 |volume=26|pages=63|year=1946|title=A laboratory ozonizer|prep=cv3p0673}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically cost-effective and do not require an oxygen source other than the ambient air to produce ozone concentrations of 3–6%. Fluctuations in ambient air, due to weather or other environmental conditions, cause variability in ozone production. However, they also produce [[nitrogen oxide]]s as a by-product. Use of an [[air dryer]] can reduce or eliminate nitric acid formation by removing water vapor and increase ozone production. Use of an [[oxygen concentrator]] can further increase the ozone production and further reduce the risk of nitric acid formation by removing not only the water vapor, but also the bulk of the nitrogen.

===Ultraviolet light===
UV ozone generators, or vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) ozone generators, employ a light source that generates a narrow-band ultraviolet light, a subset of that produced by the Sun. The Sun's UV sustains the ozone layer in the stratosphere of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dohan |first=J. M. |author2=W. J. Masschelein |year=1987 |journal=Ozone Sci. Eng.|title=Photochemical Generation of Ozone: Present State-of-the-Art |volume=9 |pages=315–334 |doi=10.1080/01919518708552147 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UV ozone generators use ambient air for ozone production, no air prep systems are used (air dryer or oxygen concentrator), therefore these generators tend to be less expensive.  However UV ozone generators usually produce ozone with a concentration of about 0.5% or lower which limits the potential ozone production rate. Another disadvantage of this method is that it requires the ambient air (oxygen) to be exposed to the UV source for a longer amount of time, and any gas that is not exposed to the UV source will not be treated. This makes UV generators impractical for use in situations that deal with rapidly moving air or water streams (in-duct air [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]], for example). Production of ozone is one of the [[ultraviolet germicidal irradiation#Potential dangers|potential dangers]] of [[ultraviolet germicidal irradiation]]. VUV ozone generators are used in swimming pool and [[spa]] applications ranging to millions of gallons of water. VUV ozone generators, unlike corona discharge generators, do not produce harmful nitrogen by-products and also unlike corona discharge systems, VUV ozone generators work extremely well in humid air environments. There is also not normally a need for expensive off-gas mechanisms, and no need for air driers or oxygen concentrators which require extra costs and maintenance.

===Cold plasma===
In the cold plasma method, pure oxygen gas is exposed to a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] created by [[dielectric barrier discharge]]. The diatomic oxygen is split into single atoms, which then recombine in triplets to form ozone.

Cold plasma machines utilize pure oxygen as the input source and produce a maximum concentration of about 5% ozone. They produce far greater quantities of ozone in a given space of time compared to ultraviolet production. However, because cold plasma ozone generators are very expensive, they are found less frequently than the previous two types.

The discharges manifest as filamentary transfer of electrons (micro discharges) in a gap between two electrodes. In order to evenly distribute the micro discharges, a dielectric [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] must be used to separate the metallic electrodes and to prevent arcing.

Some cold plasma units also have the capability of producing short-lived allotropes of oxygen which include O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. These species are even more reactive than ordinary {{chem|O|3}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gujral, et al|first=Sarbjeet Singh|year=2013|title=Ozone Therapy: A Milestone in the Treatment of Ailments|url=http://www.iglobaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/8.-Sarbjeet-S-Gujral-et-al-IGJPS-2013_edited.pdf|journal=Indo Global Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences|volume=3 |issue=2|pages=167–173|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrolytic===
Electrolytic ozone generation (EOG) splits water molecules into H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.
In most EOG methods, the hydrogen gas will be removed to leave oxygen and ozone as the only reaction products. Therefore, EOG can achieve higher [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] in water without other competing gases found in corona discharge method, such as nitrogen gases present in ambient air. This method of generation can achieve concentrations of 20–30% and is independent of air quality because water is used as the source material. Production of ozone electrolytically is typically unfavorable because of the high [[overpotential]] required to produce ozone as compared to oxygen. This is why ozone is not produced during typical water electrolysis. However, it is possible to increase the overpotential of oxygen by careful catalyst selection such that ozone is preferentially produced under electrolysis. Catalysts typically chosen for this approach are [[lead dioxide]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Foller, Peter C. |author2=Tobias, Charles W. |title=The Anodic Evolution of Ozone|journal=Journal of the Electrochemical Society|volume=129|issue=3|pages=506|doi=10.1149/1.2123890|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; or boron-doped diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Arihara, Kazuki |author2=Terashima, Chiaki |author3=Fujishimam Akira |title= Electrochemical Production of High-Concentration Ozone-Water Using Freestanding Perforated Diamond Electrodes|journal= Journal of the Electrochemical Society|volume= 154|issue= 4|pages= E71|doi= 10.1149/1.2509385|year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special considerations===
Ozone cannot be stored and transported like other industrial gases (because it quickly decays into diatomic oxygen) and must therefore be produced on site. Available ozone generators vary in the arrangement and design of the high-voltage electrodes. At production capacities higher than 20&amp;nbsp;kg per hour, a gas/water tube heat-exchanger may be utilized as ground electrode and assembled with tubular high-voltage electrodes on the gas-side. The regime of typical gas pressures is around {{convert|2|bar|lk=on}} absolute in oxygen and {{convert|3|bar}} absolute in air. Several megawatts of [[electric power|electrical power]] may be installed in large facilities, applied as one phase AC [[Electric current|current]] at 50 to 8000&amp;nbsp;Hz and peak [[voltage]]s between 3,000 and 20,000 volts. Applied voltage is usually inversely related to the applied frequency.

The dominating parameter influencing ozone generation efficiency is the gas temperature, which is controlled by cooling water temperature and/or gas velocity. The cooler the water, the better the ozone synthesis. The lower the gas velocity, the higher the concentration (but the lower the net ozone produced). At typical industrial conditions, almost 90% of the effective power is dissipated as heat and needs to be removed by a sufficient cooling water flow.

Because of the high reactivity of ozone, only a few materials may be used like [[stainless steel]] (quality 316L), [[titanium]], [[aluminium]] (as long as no moisture is present), [[glass]], [[polytetrafluorethylene]], or [[polyvinylidene fluoride]]. [[Viton]] may be used with the restriction of constant mechanical forces and absence of humidity (humidity limitations apply depending on the formulation). [[Hypalon]] may be used with the restriction that no water come in contact with it, except for normal atmospheric levels. [[Embrittlement]] or shrinkage is the common mode of failure of elastomers with exposure to ozone. Ozone cracking is the common mode of failure of elastomer seals like [[O-rings]].

[[Silicone rubber]]s are usually adequate for use as [[gaskets]] in ozone concentrations below 1 wt%, such as in equipment for accelerated aging of rubber samples.

===Incidental production===
Ozone may be formed from {{chem|O|2}} by electrical discharges and by action of high energy [[electromagnetic radiation]]. [[Arc suppression|Unsuppressed arcing]] in electrical contacts, motor brushes, or mechanical switches breaks down the chemical bonds of the atmospheric oxygen surrounding the contacts [{{chem|O|2}} → 2O]. Free radicals of oxygen in and around the arc recombine to create ozone [{{chem|O|3}}].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Lab Note #106 ''Environmental Impact of Arc Suppression'' | publisher = Arc Suppression Technologies | date = April 2011 | url = http://www.arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/arc-suppression-facts/lab-app-notes/ | accessdate = October 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain [[electrical equipment]] generate significant levels of ozone. This is especially true of devices using [[high voltage]]s, such as [[Air ioniser|ionic air purifiers]], [[laser printer]]s, [[photocopier]]s, [[electroshock weapon|tasers]] and [[arc welding|arc welders]]. [[Electric motor]]s using [[brush (electric)|brush]]es can generate ozone from repeated [[spark gap|spark]]ing inside the unit. Large motors that use brushes, such as those used by elevators or hydraulic pumps, will generate more ozone than smaller motors.

Ozone is similarly formed in the [[Catatumbo lightning|Catatumbo lightning storms]] phenomenon on the [[Catatumbo River]] in [[Venezuela]], though ozone's instability makes it dubious that it has any effect on the ozonosphere.&lt;ref name="Zulia"&gt;[http://www.agenciadenoticias.luz.edu.ve/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4965&amp;Itemid=151 ¿Relámpagos del Catatumbo regeneran la capa de ozono?]. Agencia de noticias de la [[Universidad del Zulia]].&lt;/ref&gt;
It is the world's largest single natural generator of ozone, lending calls for it to be designated a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name="meteo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fire in the Sky|url=http://www.meteogroup.co.uk/uk/home/weather/weather_news/news_archive/archive/2007/november/ch/f540146dcc/article/fire_in_the_sky.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721215231/http://www.meteogroup.co.uk/uk/home/weather/weather_news/news_archive/archive/2007/november/ch/f540146dcc/article/fire_in_the_sky.html|archivedate=2011-07-21|accessdate=2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laboratory production===
In the laboratory, ozone can be produced by [[electrolysis]] using a [[9 volt battery]], a pencil graphite rod [[cathode]], a [[platinum]] wire [[anode]] and a 3 [[molar (concentration)|molar]] [[sulfuric acid]] [[electrolyte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ibanez|first=Jorge G. |author2=Rodrigo Mayen-Mondragon |author3=M. T. Moran-Moran|year=2005|title=Laboratory Experiments on the Electrochemical Remediation of the Environment.

: 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 6 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Table of standard electrode potentials|ΔE&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;]] = −1.53 [[Volt|V]])
: 6 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 6 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (ΔE&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 V)
: 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (ΔE&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.23 V)

In the net reaction, three equivalents of water are converted into one equivalent of ozone and three equivalents of [[hydrogen]]. Oxygen formation is a competing reaction.

It can also be generated by a [[high voltage]] [[Electric arc|arc]]. In its simplest form, high voltage AC, such as the output of a [[Neon-sign transformer]] is connected to two metal rods with the ends placed sufficiently close to each other to allow an arc. The resulting arc will convert atmospheric oxygen to ozone.

It is often desirable to contain the ozone. This can be done with an apparatus consisting of two concentric glass tubes sealed together at the top with gas ports at the top and bottom of the outer tube. The inner core should have a length of metal foil inserted into it connected to one side of the power source. The other side of the power source should be connected to another piece of foil wrapped around the outer tube. A source of dry  {{chem|O|2}} is applied to the bottom port. When high voltage is applied to the foil leads, [[electricity]] will discharge between the dry dioxygen in the middle and form {{chem|O|3}} and {{chem|O|2}} which will flow out the top port. The reaction can be summarized as follows:&lt;ref name=brown /&gt;

: 3 {{chem|O|2}} — ''electricity'' → 2 {{chem|O|3}}

The largest use of ozone is in the preparation of [[pharmaceuticals]], [[synthetic lubricants]], and many other commercially useful [[organic compounds]], where it is used to sever [[carbon]]-carbon bonds.&lt;ref name=brown /&gt; It can also be used for [[Bleach (chemical)|bleach]]ing substances and for killing microorganisms in air and water sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ozonesolutions.com/Ozone_Color_Removal.html|work = Ozone Information|title = Ozone and Color Removal| accessdate = 2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many municipal drinking water systems kill bacteria with ozone instead of the more common [[chlorine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoigné |first= J.|title=Handbook of Environmental Chemistry, Vol. 5 part C|pages=83–141|year=1998 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozone has a very high [[oxidation potential]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ozone-information.com/Oxidation_Potential_Ozone.html|title=Oxidation Potential of Ozone| work= Ozone-Information.com| accessdate=2008-05-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080419034421/http://www.ozone-information.com/Oxidation_Potential_Ozone.html |archivedate = 2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozone does not form [[organochlorine]] compounds, nor does it remain in the water after treatment. Ozone can form the suspected carcinogen [[bromate]] in source water with high [[bromide]] concentrations. The U.S. [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] mandates that these systems introduce an amount of chlorine to maintain a minimum of 0.2 μmol/mol residual [[free chlorine]] in the pipes, based on results of regular testing. Where [[Electric power|electrical power]] is abundant, ozone is a cost-effective method of treating water, since it is produced on demand and does not require transportation and storage of hazardous chemicals. Once it has decayed, it leaves no taste or odour in drinking water.

Although low levels of ozone have been advertised to be of some disinfectant use in residential homes, the concentration of ozone in dry air required to have a rapid, substantial effect on airborne pathogens exceeds safe levels recommended by the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] and [[Environmental Protection Agency]]. Humidity control can vastly improve both the killing power of the ozone and the rate at which it decays back to oxygen (more humidity allows more effectiveness). [[Spore]] forms of most pathogens are very tolerant of atmospheric ozone in concentrations at which asthma patients start to have issues.

Industrially, ozone is used to:
*Disinfect laundry in hospitals, food factories, care homes etc.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2007-04-01|url=http://www.hdmagazine.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=2043080|title=Decontamination: Ozone scores on spores| work= Hospital Development|publisher=Wilmington Media Ltd.|accessdate=2007-05-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929000438/http://www.hdmagazine.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=2043080 |archivedate = 2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone is a [[reagent]] in many [[organic reactions]] in the laboratory and in industry. [[Ozonolysis]] is the cleavage of an [[alkene]] to [[carbonyl]] compounds.

Many hospitals around the world use large ozone generators to decontaminate operating rooms between surgeries. The rooms are cleaned and then sealed airtight before being filled with ozone which effectively kills or neutralizes all remaining bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Boer |first1=Hero E. L. |last2=van Elzelingen-Dekker |first2=Carla M. |last3=van Rheenen-Verberg |first3=Cora M.

Ozone is used as an alternative to [[chlorine]] or [[chlorine dioxide]] in the [[bleaching of wood pulp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sjöström |first= Eero|title=Wood Chemistry: Fundamentals and Applications |year=1993 |publisher=Academic Press, Inc. |location=San Diego, CA |isbn=978-0-12-647481-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Sv3xcS6eS5QC&amp;pg=PA187}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used in conjunction with oxygen and hydrogen peroxide to eliminate the need for chlorine-containing compounds in the manufacture of high-quality, white [[paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Su

Ozone can be used to detoxify [[cyanide]] wastes (for example from [[gold]] and [[silver]] [[mining]]) by oxidising cyanide to [[cyanate]] and eventually to [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bollyky |first= L. J.|title=Ozone Treatment of Cyanide-Bearing Wastes, EPA Report 600/2-77-104|year=1977 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |location=Research Triangle Park, N.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumers===
{{see also|Air purifier#Potential ozone hazards}}
Devices generating high levels of ozone, some of which use ionization, are used to sanitize and deodorize uninhabited buildings, rooms, ductwork, woodsheds, boats and other vehicles.

In the U.S., [[air purifier]]s emitting low levels of ozone have been sold. This kind of air purifier is sometimes claimed to imitate nature's way of purifying the air without filters and to sanitize both it and household surfaces. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has declared that there is "evidence to show that at concentrations that do not exceed public health standards, ozone is not effective at removing many odor-causing chemicals" or "viruses, bacteria, mold, or other biological pollutants". Furthermore, its report states that "results of some controlled studies show that concentrations of ozone considerably higher than these [human safety] standards are possible even when a user follows the manufacturer’s operating instructions".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/ozonegen.html EPA report on consumer ozone air purifiers]. Epa.gov. Retrieved on 2012-02-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozonated water is used to launder clothes and to sanitize food, drinking water, and surfaces in the home. According to the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), it is "amending the [[food additive]] regulations to provide for the safe use of ozone in gaseous and aqueous phases as an [[Antimicrobial|antimicrobial agent]] on food, including meat and poultry." Studies at [[California Polytechnic State University|California Polytechnic University]] demonstrated that 0.3 μmol/mol levels of ozone dissolved in filtered tapwater can produce a reduction of more than 99.99% in such food-borne microorganisms as salmonella, ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 and ''Campylobacter''. This quantity is 20,000 times the [[World Health Organization|WHO]]-recommended limits stated above.&lt;ref name="food"&gt;{{cite web|last=Montecalvo |first=Joseph |author2=Doug Williams |title=Application of Ozonation in Sanitizing Vegetable Process Washwaters |publisher=California Polytechnic State University |url=http://www.cwtozone.com/files/articles/Food_Produce/Article%20-%20Veg.%20Process%20washwater.pdf |accessdate=2008-03-24 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528140629/http://www.cwtozone.com/files/articles/Food_Produce/Article%20-%20Veg.%20Process%20washwater.pdf |archivedate=May 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Long| first=Ron| year=2008| url=http://www.purityintl.com/Article%20POU.pdf| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715132442/http://www.purityintl.com/Article%20POU.pdf| archivedate=2011-07-15| format=PDF| title=POU Ozone Food Sanitation: A Viable Option for Consumers &amp; the Food Service Industry}} (the report also shows that tapwater removes 99.95% of pathogens from lettuce; samples were inoculated with pathogens before treatment)&lt;/ref&gt;
Ozone can be used to remove [[pesticide]] residues from [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Tersano Inc|year=2007| url=http://www.tersano.com/sanitizing_system_food.shtml | title=lotus Sanitises Food without Chemicals| accessdate=2007-02-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070211025555/http://www.tersano.com/sanitizing_system_food.shtml |archivedate = 2007-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fruit"&gt;{{cite book |title=Improving the Safety of Fresh Fruit and Vegetables |last=Jongen |first=W |year=2005 |publisher=Woodhead Publishing Ltd |location=Boca Raton |isbn=978-1-85573-956-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone is used in homes and [[hot tub]]s to kill bacteria in the water and to reduce the amount of chlorine or bromine required by reactivating them to their free state. Since ozone does not remain in the water long enough, ozone by itself is ineffective at preventing cross-contamination among bathers and must be used in conjunction with [[halogens]]. Gaseous ozone created by ultraviolet light or by corona discharge is injected into the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/mdbp/upload/2001_07_13_mdbp_alternative_disinfectants_guidance.pdf |format=PDF|title=Alternative Disinfectants and Oxidant Guidance Manual|date=April 1999|publisher = [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |accessdate=2008-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone is also widely used in treatment of water in aquariums and fish ponds. Its use can minimize bacterial growth, control parasites, eliminate transmission of some diseases, and reduce or eliminate "yellowing" of the water. Ozone must not come in contact with fish's gill structures. Natural salt water (with life forms) provides enough "instantaneous demand" that controlled amounts of ozone activate bromide ion to [[hypobromous acid]], and the ozone entirely decays in a few seconds to minutes. If oxygen fed ozone is used, the water will be higher in dissolved oxygen, fish's gill structures will atrophy and they will become dependent on higher dissolved oxygen levels.

===Aquaculture===
Ozonation – a process of infusing water with ozone – can be used in aquaculture to facilitate organic breakdown. Ozone is also added to recirculating systems to reduce [[nitrite]] levels&lt;ref name="Noble"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0959-8030(96)90006-X | last1 = Noble | first1 = A.C. | last2 = Summerfelt | first2 = S.T. | year = 1996 | title = Diseases encountered in rainbow trout cultured in recirculating systems |journal = Annual Review of Fish Diseases | volume = 6 |pages = 65–92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; through conversion into [[nitrate]]. If nitrite levels in the water are high, nitrites will also accumulate in the blood and tissues of fish, where it interferes with oxygen transport (it causes oxidation of the heme-group of [[haemoglobin]] from ferrous ({{chem|Fe|2+}}) to ferric ({{chem|Fe|3+}}), making haemoglobin unable to bind {{chem|O|2}}).&lt;ref name="Ferreira"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0044-8486(03)00524-6 | last1 = Ferreira | first1 = O| last2 = de Costa | first2 = O.T. | last3 = Ferreira | first3 = Santos | last4 = Mendonca | first4 = F. | year = 2004 | title = Susceptibility of the Amazonian fish, Colossoma macropomum (Serrasalminae), to short-term exposure to nitrite |journal = Aquaculture | volume = 232 |pages = 627–636 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these apparent positive effects, ozone use in recirculation systems has been linked to reducing the level of bioavailable iodine in salt water systems, resulting in iodine deficiency symptoms such as goitre and decreased growth in Senegalese sole (''[[Solea senegalensis]]'') larvae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ribeiro | first1 = A.R.A. | last2 = Ribeiro | first2 = L. | last3 = Saele | first3 = Ø. | last4 = Hamre | first4 = K. | last5 = Dinis | first5 = M.T. | last6 = Moren | first6 = M. | title = Iodine-enriched rotifers andArtemiaprevent goitre in Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) larvae reared in a recirculation system | journal = Aquaculture Nutrition | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2095.2009.00740.x | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 248–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozonate seawater is used for surface disinfection of [[haddock]] and [[Atlantic halibut]] eggs against nodavirus. Nodavirus is a lethal and vertically transmitted virus which causes severe mortality in fish. Haddock eggs should not be treated with high ozone level as eggs so treated did not hatch and died after 3–4 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.aquaeng.2005.10.001 | last1 = Buchan | first1 = K. | last2 = Martin-Robinchaud | first2 = D. | last3 = Benfey | first3 = T.J. | last4 = MacKinnon | year = 2006 | first4 = A | last5 = Boston | first5 = L | title = The efficacy of ozonated seawater for surface disinfection of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) eggs against piscine nodavirus |journal = Aquacultural Engineering | volume = 35 |pages = 102–107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===
Ozone application on freshly cut pineapple and banana shows increase in flavonoids and total phenol contents when exposure is up to 20 minutes. Decrease in [[ascorbic acid]] (one form of [[vitamin C]]) content is observed but the positive effect on total phenol content and flavonoids can overcome the negative effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ifset.2010.08.008 | last1 = Alothman | first1 = M. | last2 = Kaur | first2 = B. | last3 = Fazilah | first3 = A. | last4 = Bhat | year = 2010 | first4 = Rajeev | last5 = Karim | first5 = Alias A. | title = Ozone-induced changes of antioxidant capacity of fresh-cut tropical fruits |journal = Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 666–671 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tomatoes upon treatment with ozone shows an increase in β-carotene, lutein and lycopene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.postharvbio.2007.03.004 | last1 = Tzortzakis | first1 = N. | last2 = Borland | first2 = A. | last3 = Singleton | first3 = I. | year = 2007 | last4 = Barnes | first4 = J | title = Impact of atmospheric ozone-enrichment on quality-related attributes of tomato fruit |journal = Postharvest Biology and Technology | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 317–325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ozone application on strawberries in pre-harvest period shows decrease in ascorbic acid content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.postharvbio.2007.12.003 | last1 = Keutgen | first1 = A.J. | last2 = Pawelzik | first2 = E. | year = 2008 | title = Influence of pre-harvest ozone exposure on quality of strawberry fruit under simulated retail conditions |journal = Postharvest Biology and Technology | volume = 49 |pages = 10–18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone facilitates the extraction of some heavy metals from soil using [[EDTA]]. EDTA forms strong, water-soluble coordination compounds with some heavy metals ([[Lead|Pb]], [[Zinc|Zn]]) thereby making it possible to dissolve them out from contaminated soil. If contaminated soil is pre-treated with ozone, the extraction efficacy of [[Lead|Pb]], [[Americium|Am]] and [[Plutonium|Pu]] increases by 11.0–28.9%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2005.03.005 | last1 = Lestan | first1 = D. | last2 = Hanc | first2 = A. | last3 = Finzgar | first3 = N. | year = 2005 | title = Influence of ozonation on extractability of Pb and Zn from contaminated soils |journal = Chemosphere | volume = 61 | issue = 7| pages = 1012–1019 | pmid = 16257321 | bibcode = 2005Chmsp..61.1012L }}&lt;/ref&gt; 43.5%&lt;ref name="Plaue"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1524/ract.91.6.309.20026 | last1 = Plaue | first1 = J.W. | last2 = Czerwinski | first2 = K.R. | year = 2003 | title = The influence of ozone on ligand-assisted extraction of 239Pu and 241Am from rocky flats soil |journal = Radiochim.

{{for|the Philip K. Dick story|Project Plowshare}}
The '''Plowshares Project''' is a [[Peace Studies]] collaborative between [[Manchester University (Indiana)|Manchester University]], [[Earlham College]] and [[Goshen College]] in [[Indiana]].

==History==
The Plowshares Project was formed in 2002, and is funded by a four-year grant from [[Eli Lilly and Company]]. The project defines its mission and goals by the religious ethos of the [[Church of the Brethren]], the [[Society of Friends]], and [[Mennonite Church USA]].

==Purpose==
Plowshares was initiated to enrich the Peace Studies programs at Manchester, Earlham, and Goshen colleges. The program facilitates channels of discussion, and seeks to uphold the peacemaking traditions of the colleges' [[peace churches|founding churches]].

==Declared goals==
With the Lilly grant, the Plowshares Program intends to:
*''Further Expand Peace Studies Programs''—by creating an international resource for peace studies education, strengthening educators, and offering grants for student research.
*''Unification of Peace Studies Courses''—through discussion and program development by founding schools.
*''Increase Awareness of Peace Studies and Related Issues''—by creating a community presence to inform respective communities and nation of happenings and to distinguish Indiana as a strong base for peace studies.

==Peace House==
The Peace House is the main outlet for community involvement for the Plowshares Project. Located in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], the house serves as a hub for undergraduate students from any US college or university, and in any major, to become directly involved in the fields of peace and justice. 

The Peace House provides semester-long residence for students pursuing internships with Indianapolis companies and organizations who are involved or concerned with peace and justice issues. There is also a nine-week summer intensive available for students. 

===Fall and spring semesters===
During the regular semester, students at the Peace House take two Peace Studies courses taught by adjunct faculty. From the Plowshares website:
*''Introduction to Urban Peace and Justice Issues''— combined with an introduction to the city of Indianapolis
*''Peacemaking in Practice''—focusing on "self-reflection, strategic planning and practical skills for non-violent social change&lt;ref&gt;1&lt;/ref&gt;"

====Internship====
The internship session mediated by Peace House allows for '''up to''' 20 hours of work per week under the supervision of the Peace House director; the work grants up to six credit hours. 

===Summer session===
The nine-week summer session operates without the class work, but still facilitates a full-time internship. The student may work up to 40 hours per week with a selected organization, and may still earn up to six credit hours. During the summer, students may also reside at the Peace House without earning college credit.

'''Politicards''' are a deck of [[playing cards]] produced each [[elections in the United States#Federal elections|election year]] in the [[United States]] with 54 [[caricatures]] depicting political candidates and prominent political figures. The first Politicards deck was produced in 1971 for the 1972 election by the artist Peter Green, the writer Lee Livingston, the businessman Mike Killeen and the designer Norman Friant.&lt;ref&gt;"What the Deuce?", ''Southland Sunday'' magazine, June 18, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, about 200,000 packs of cards were being sold during each election cycle.&lt;ref name="glendale"/&gt; Decks were said to have been used at the time by then New York Senator James Buckley and by the ladies of Mamie Eisenhower’s bridge club.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Stumbo, "Politicards Sweeping the Nation", ''The Los Angeles Times'', December 27, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decks of "Politicards" have been produced for election years 1971, 1980, 1984&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Krebs, "Notes on People", ''New York Times'', August 16, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Vaillancourt, "Artist is Playing With a Full Deck", ''Glendale News-Press'', October 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1996 onwards.&lt;ref name="glendale"/&gt;

{{Politics|expanded=Policy}}

'''Public policy''' is the principled guide to action taken by the administrative [[Executive (government)|executive branches]] of the [[State (polity)|state]] with regard to a class of issues, in a manner consistent with [[law]] and [[Institution|institutional customs]]. 

==Overview==
The foundation of public policy is composed of national constitutional laws and regulations. Further substrates include both [[judicial]] interpretations and [[regulations]] which are generally authorized by legislation. Public policy is considered strong when it solves problems efficiently and effectively, serves and supports governmental institutions and policies, and encourages active citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Characteristics of Successful Public Policy|url=http://publicadmin.norwich.edu/characteristics-of-successful-public-policy/|website=Norwich University Public Administration|publisher=Norwich University Public Administration|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars define public policy as a system of "courses of action, [[regulation|regulatory]] measures, [[law]]s, and [[funding]] priorities concerning a given topic promulgated by a governmental entity or its representatives."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musc.edu/vawprevention/policy/definition.shtml Kilpatrick, Dean, "Definitions of Public Policy and Law"]&lt;/ref&gt; Public policy is commonly embodied in "constitutions, legislative acts, and judicial decisions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1368469 Schuster II, W. Michael, "For the Greater Good: The Use of Public Policy Considerations in Confirming Chapter 11 Plans of Reorganization"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], this concept refers not only to the result of policies, but more broadly to the [[decision-making]] and [[analysis]] of governmental decisions. As an [[academic discipline]], public policy is studied by professors and students at [[public policy schools]] of major [[universities]] throughout the country.  The U.S. professional association of public policy practitioners, researchers, scholars, and students is the [[Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management]].

==Government actions and process==
Public policy making can be characterized as a dynamic, complex, and interactive system through which public problems are identified and countered by creating new public policy or by reforming existing public policy.&lt;ref name="Analysing Public Policy"&gt;{{cite book|last=John|first=Peter|title=Analysing Public Policy|year=1998|publisher=Continuum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public problems can originate in endless ways and require different policy responses (such as regulations, subsidies, Import quota|quotas, and laws) on the local, national, or international level.&lt;ref name="Dimensions of State Politics, Economics, and Public Policy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharkansky|first=Ira|author2=R. Hofferbert |title=Dimensions of State Politics, Economics, and Public Policy|journal=The American Political Science Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public policy making is a continuous process that has many feedback loops. Verification and program evaluation are essential to the functioning of this system.&lt;ref name="Public Policy: The 21st Century Perspective"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thei|first=Geurts|author2=Be Informed |title=Public Policy: The 21st Century Perspective|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The public problems that influence public policy making can be of economic, social, or political nature.&lt;ref name="Public Policy Process"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Michael|title=Public Policy Process|year=2005|publisher=Pearson}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Each system is influenced by different public problems and issues, and has different stakeholders; as such, each requires different public policy.&lt;ref name="Public Policy: The 21st Century Perspective"/&gt;

In public policy making, numerous individuals, corporations, non-profit organizations and interest groups compete and collaborate to influence policymakers to act in a particular way.&lt;ref name="Kilpatrick"&gt;Kilpatrick&lt;/ref&gt;

The large set of actors in the public policy process, such as politicians, civil servants, lobbyists, domain experts, and industry or sector representatives, use a variety of tactics and tools to advance their aims, including advocating their positions publicly, attempting to educate supporters and opponents, and mobilizing allies on a particular issue.&lt;ref name="Dimensions of State Politics, Economics, and Public Policy"/&gt; 

Many actors can be important in the public policy process, but government officials ultimately choose public policy in response to the public issue or problem at hand. In doing so, government officials are expected to meet public sector ethics and take the needs of all project stakeholder|stakeholders into account.&lt;ref name="Public Policy: The 21st Century Perspective"/&gt;

Since societies have changed in the past decades, the public policy making system changed too. In the 2010s, public policy making is increasingly goal-oriented, aiming for measurable results and goals, and decision-centric, focusing on decisions that must be taken immediately.&lt;ref name="Public Policy: The 21st Century Perspective"/&gt; 

Furthermore, mass communications and technological changes such as the widespread availability of the Internet have caused the public policy system to become more complex and interconnected.&lt;ref name="The Process and Effects of mass communication"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schramm|first=Wilbur|title=The Process and Effects of mass communication|date=165|isbn=0252001974}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changes pose new challenges to the current public policy systems and pressures leaders to evolve to remain effective and efficient.&lt;ref name="Public Policy: The 21st Century Perspective"/&gt;

==Academic discipline==
{{Main|Policy Studies}}

As an academic discipline, public policy brings in elements of many [[social science]] fields and concepts, including [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[political economy]], [[social policy]], [[program evaluation]], [[policy analysis]], and [[public management]], all as applied to problems of governmental administration, management, and operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pellissery|first=Sony|title= Public Policy |journal=The SAGE Encyclopedia of World Poverty|year=2015|publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, the study of public policy is distinct from political science or economics, in its focus on the application of theory to practice.  While the majority of [[public policy degrees]] are [[master's degree|master's]] and [[doctorate|doctoral]] degrees, there are several universities that offer undergraduate education in public policy.

Traditionally, the academic field of public policy focused on [[domestic policy]]. However, the wave of [[economic globalization]] that occurred in the late 20th and early 21st centuries created a need for a subset of public policy that focused on [[global governance]], especially as it relates to issues that transcend [[national borders]] such as [[climate change]], [[terrorism]], [[nuclear proliferation]], and [[economic development]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gppi.net/fileadmin/gppi/Global_Public_Policy_Foreign_Affairs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, many traditional public policy schools had to adjust their curricula to better suit this new policy landscape, as well as develop entirely new curricula altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Diane. "Global public policy, transnational policy communities, and their networks." Policy studies journal 36, no. 1 (2008): 19-38&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}
A '''pulverizer''' or '''grinder''' is a mechanical device for the grinding of many different types of materials. For example, a pulverizer mill is used to [[Pulverized coal-fired boiler|pulverize coal]] for [[combustion]] in the steam-generating [[furnaces]] of [[fossil fuel power plant]]s.

==Types of coal pulverizers==
Coal pulverizers may be classified by speed, as follows:&lt;ref name="CPMT-GS"&gt;Coal Pulverising Mill Types, by Glenn Schumacher, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Low Speed
* Medium Speed
* High Speed

===Low Speed===

====Ball and tube mills====

A ball mill is a pulverizer that consists of a horizontal rotating cylinder, up to three diameters in length, containing a charge of tumbling or cascading steel balls, pebbles, or rods.

A tube mill is a revolving cylinder of up to five diameters in length used for fine pulverization of [[ore]], rock, and other such materials; the material, mixed with water, is fed into the chamber from one end, and passes out the other end as a [[slurry]].

Both types of mill include liners that protect the cylindrical structure of the mill from wear.  Thus the main wear parts in these mills are the balls themselves, and the liners.  The balls are simply "consumed" by the wear process and must be re-stocked, whereas the liners must be periodically replaced.

The ball and tube mills are low-speed machines that grind the coal with steel balls in a rotating horizontal cylinder. Due to its shape, it is called a tube mill and due to use of grinding balls for crushing, it is called a ball mill, or both terms as a ball tube mill..

These mills are also designated as an example size, BBD-4772,

*B – Broyer (Name of inventor).
*B – Boulet (French word for balls).
*D – Direct firing.
*47 – Diameter of shell (in decimeters) i.e. 4.7&amp;nbsp;m diameter.
*72 – Length of shell (in decimeters) i.e. 7.2&amp;nbsp;m length.

The grinding in the ball and tube mill is produced by the rotating quantity of steel balls by their fall and lift due to tube rotation. The ball charge may occupy one third to half of the total internal volume of the shell. The significant feature incorporated in the BBD mills is its double end operation, each end catering to one elevation of a boiler. The system facilitated entry of raw coal and exit of pulverized fuel from same end simultaneously. This helps in reducing the number of installations per unit.

====Mill construction details====
A ball tube mill may be described as a cylinder made of steel plates having separate heads or trunions attached to the ends with each trunion resting on suitable bearings for supporting the machine. The trunions are hollow to allow for the introduction of discharge of the materials undergoing reduction in size. The mill shell is lined with chilled iron, carbon steel, manganese steel, or high chrome liners attached to shell body with counter sunk bolts. These liners are made in different shapes so that the counter inside surface of the mill is suited for requirement of a particular application.

The shells are of three pieces. The intermediate shell connects to the end shells by flange joints and the total length of shell is 7.2&amp;nbsp;m. The liners are fastened to the inner side of mill shell (cylindrical part) to protect the shell from the impact of the steel balls. There are 600 liners of ten variants in each shell weighing 60.26&amp;nbsp;tonnes. The original lift value of the liners is 55&amp;nbsp;mm. and the minimum lift allowed is 20&amp;nbsp;mm.

====Operation====
The primary air input to a ball tube mill performs a dual function. It is used for drying and as the fuel transport medium, and by regulating it the mill output is regulated. Governed by the pulverized fuel outlet temperature requirement, the cold air and hot air dampers are regulated to achieve the correct primary air temperature. In addition to raising the coal temperature inside the mill for drying and better grinding, the same air works as the transport medium to move the pulverized coal out of the mill: it travels through the annular space between the fixed trunnion tubes and the rotating hot air tube onwards to the classifier. Coal-laden air passes through double cone static classifiers, with adjustable classifier vanes, for segregation into pulverized fuel of the desired fineness, and coarse particles. The pulverised fuel continues its journey towards the coal burners for combustion. The coarse particles rejected in the classifier are returned to the mill for another cycle of grinding.

In order to avoid excess sweeping of coal from the mill, only part of the primary air, directly proportional to the boiler load demand, is passed through the mill. Furthermore, to ensure sufficient velocity of pulverized fuel to avoid settling in the pipes, an additional quantity of primary air is fed into a mixing box on the raw coal circuit. This by-pass air tapped from the primary air duct going into the mill makes an appreciable contribution to the drying of raw coal, by a flash drying effect, in addition to picking up the pulverized fuel from the mill outlet for its transportation towards the classifiers.

The tube mill output (responding to boiler load demand) is controlled by regulating the primary air-flow. This regulation, by sweeping pulverized fuel from the mill, is very fast; comparable with oil firing response, but needs the coal level to be maintained in the mill. A control circuit monitors the coal level in the mill, and controls the speed of the raw coal feeder to maintain it. Maintaining the coal level in the mill offers a built-in capacity cushion of pulverized fuel to take care of short interruptions in the raw coal circuit.

The mill is pressurized and the air-tightness is ensured by plenum chambers around the rotating trunnion filled with pressurized seal air. Bleeding seal air from plenum chamber to the mill maintains separation between pulverized fuel in the Mill and the outside atmosphere. Inadequacy or absence of seal air will allow escape of pulverized fuel into atmosphere. On the other hand, an excess of seal air leaking into mill will affect the mill outlet temperature. As such the seal air is controlled by a local control damper maintaining just sufficient differential pressure for sealing.

===Medium Speed===

====Ring and ball mill====

This type of mill consists of two types of rings separated by a series of large balls, like a [[thrust bearing]].  The lower ring rotates, while the upper ring presses down on the balls via a set of spring and adjuster assemblies, or pressurised rams. The material to be pulverized is introduced into the center or side of the pulverizer (depending on the design). As the lower ring rotates, the balls to orbit between the upper and lower rings, and balls roll over the bed of coal on the lower ring. The pulverized material is carried out of the mill by the flow of air moving through it. The size of the pulverized particles released from the grinding section of the mill is determined by a classifier separator. If the coal is fine enough to be picked up by the air, it is carried through the classifier. Coarser particles return to be further pulverized.

===Vertical spindle roller mill===

Similar to the ring and ball mill, the vertical spindle roller mill uses large "tires" to crush the coal. These mills are usually found in utility plants.

Raw coal is gravity-fed through a central feed pipe to the grinding table where it flows outwardly by centrifugal action and is ground between the rollers and table. Hot primary air for drying and coal
transport enters the windbox plenum underneath the grinding table and flows upward through a swirl ring having multiple sloped nozzles surrounding the grinding table. The air mixes with and
dries coal in the grinding zone and carries pulverized coal particles upward into a classifier.

Fine pulverized coal exits the outlet section through multiple discharge coal pipes leading to the burners, while oversized coal particles are rejected and returned to the grinding zone for further grinding.
Pyrites and extraneous dense impurity material fall through the nozzle ring and are plowed, by scraper blades attached to the grinding table, into the pyrites chamber to be removed.
Mechanically, the vertical roller mill is categorized as an applied force mill. There are three grinding roller wheel assemblies in the mill grinding section, which are mounted on a loading frame via pivot point.
The fixed-axis roller in each roller wheel assembly rotates on a segmentally-lined grinding table that is supported and driven by a planetary gear reducer direct-coupled to a motor. The grinding force for coal pulverization is applied by a loading frame. This frame is connected by vertical tension rods to three hydraulic cylinders secured to the mill foundation. All forces used in the pulverizing process are transmitted to the foundation via the gear reducer and loading elements. The pendulum movement of the roller wheels provides a freedom for wheels to move in a radial direction, which results in no radial loading against the mill housing during the pulverizing process.

Depending on the required coal fineness, there are two types of classifier that may be selected for a vertical roller mill. The dynamic classifier, which consists of a stationary angled inlet vane assembly surrounding a rotating vane assembly or cage, is capable of producing [[micrometre|micrometer]]-fine pulverized coal with a narrow particle size distribution. In addition, adjusting the speed of the rotating cage can easily change the intensity of the centrifugal force field in the classification zone to achieve coal fineness control real-time to make immediate accommodation for a change in fuel or boiler load conditions. For the applications where a micrometer-fine pulverized coal is not necessary, the static classifier, which consists of a cone equipped with adjustable vanes, is an option at a lower cost since it contains no moving parts. With adequate mill grinding capacity, a vertical mill equipped with a static classifier is capable of producing a coal fineness up to 99.5% or higher &lt;50 mesh and 80% or higher &lt;200 mesh, while one equipped with a dynamic classifier produces coal fineness levels of 100% &lt;100 mesh and 95% &lt;200 mesh, or better.

In 1954 a '''Jet Pulverizer''' was developed in which operates like a Vertical Pulverizer only the item is pulverized by the high speed air action. For example, forcing coal against coal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nd8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q3YzT6TaKu2o0AHgjvW_Ag&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Jet Pulverizer."] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1954, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bowl mill===
Similar to the vertical roller mill, it also uses tires to crush coal. There are two types, a deep bowl mill, and a shallow bowl mill.

===High Speed===

Recursive partitioning methods have been developed since the 1980s. Well known methods of recursive partitioning include Ross Quinlan's [[ID3 algorithm]] and its successors, [[C4.5]] and [[C5.0]] and [[Decision tree learning|Classification and Regression Trees]]. [[Ensemble learning]] methods such as [[Random forest|Random Forest]]s help to overcome a common criticism of these methods - their vulnerability to  [[overfitting]] of the data - by employing different algorithms and combining their output in some way.

This article focuses on recursive partitioning for medical [[diagnostic]] tests,
but the technique has far wider applications.
See [[Decision tree learning|decision tree]].

As compared to regression analysis, which creates a formula that health care providers can use to calculate the probability that a patient has a disease, recursive partition creates a rule such as 'If a patient has finding x, y, or z they probably have disease q'.

A variation is 'Cox linear recursive partitioning'.&lt;ref name="pmid6501544"/&gt;

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

Compared to other multivariable methods, recursive partitioning has advantages and disadvantages.
*Advantages are:
**Generates clinically more intuitive models that do not require the user to perform calculations.&lt;ref name="pmid16149128"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=James KE, White RF, Kraemer HC |title=Repeated split sample validation to assess logistic regression and recursive partitioning: an application to the prediction of cognitive impairment |journal=Statistics in Medicine |volume=24 |issue=19 |pages=3019–35 |year=2005 |pmid=16149128 |doi=10.1002/sim.2154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Redirect|Enumerable set|the set-theoretic concept|Countable set}}
In [[computability theory]], traditionally called recursion theory, a set ''S'' of [[natural numbers]] is called '''recursively enumerable''', '''computably enumerable''', '''semidecidable''',  '''provable''' or '''Turing-recognizable''' if:

*There is an [[algorithm]] such that the set of input numbers for which the algorithm halts is exactly ''S''. 

Or, equivalently,

*There is an algorithm that [[enumeration|enumerates]] the members of ''S''.  That means that its output is simply a list of the members of ''S'':  ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ... .  If necessary, this algorithm may run forever.  

The first condition suggests why the term ''semidecidable'' is sometimes used; the second suggests why ''computably enumerable'' is used.    The abbreviations '''r.e.''' and '''c.e.''' are often used, even in print, instead of the full phrase.

In [[computational complexity theory]], the  [[complexity class]] containing all recursively enumerable sets is [[RE (complexity)|RE]].  In [[recursion theory]], the [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] of r.e. sets under inclusion is denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Formal definition ==

A set ''S'' of natural numbers is called '''recursively enumerable''' if there is a [[partial recursive function]] whose [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] is exactly ''S'', meaning that the function is defined if and only if its input is a member of ''S''.

==Equivalent formulations==
The following are all equivalent properties of a set ''S'' of natural numbers:

:Semidecidability:
:*The set ''S'' is recursively enumerable. That is, ''S'' is the domain (co-range) of a partial recursive function.
:*There is a partial recursive function ''f'' such that:
::&lt;math&gt;f(x) = 
\left\{\begin{matrix} 
1 &amp;\mbox{if}\ x \in S \\
\mbox{undefined/does not halt}\ &amp;\mbox{if}\ x \notin S
\end{matrix}\right.
&lt;/math&gt;
:Enumerability:
:*The set ''S'' is the range of a partial recursive function.
:*The set ''S'' is the range of a total recursive function or empty. If ''S'' is infinite, the function can be chosen to be [[injective]].
:*The set ''S'' is the range of a [[primitive recursive function]] or empty. Even if ''S'' is infinite, repetition of values may be necessary in this case.
:Diophantine:
:*There is a polynomial ''p'' with integer coefficients and variables ''x'', ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', ''e'', ''f'', ''g'', ''h'', ''i'' ranging over the natural numbers such that
::&lt;math&gt;x \in S \Leftrightarrow \exists a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i \ ( p(x,a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i) = 0).&lt;/math&gt;
:*There is a polynomial from the integers to the integers such that the set ''S'' contains exactly the non-negative numbers in its range.

The equivalence of semidecidability and enumerability can be obtained by the technique of [[Dovetailing_(computer_science)|dovetailing]].

The Diophantine characterizations of a recursively enumerable set, while not as straightforward or intuitive as the first definitions, were found by [[Yuri Matiyasevich]] as part of the negative solution to [[Hilbert's tenth problem|Hilbert's Tenth Problem]]. Diophantine sets predate recursion theory and are therefore historically the first way to describe these sets (although this equivalence was only remarked more than three decades after the introduction of recursively enumerable sets).
The number of bound variables in the above definition of the [[Diophantine set]] is the best known so far; it might be that a lower number can be used to define all diophantine sets.

| [[File:Recursive enumeration of all halting Turing machines.gif|thumb|450px|Recursive enumeration of the set of all Turing machines halting on a fixed input: Simulate all Turing machines (enumerated on vertical axis) step by step (horizontal axis), using the shown diagonalization scheduling. If a machine terminates, print its number. This way, the number of each terminating machine is eventually printed. In the example, the algorithm prints "9, 13, 4, 15, 12, 18, 6, 2, 8, 0, ..."]]
|}

==Examples==
* Every [[recursive set]] is recursively enumerable, but it is not true that every recursively enumerable set is recursive. For recursive sets, the algorithm must also say if an input is ''not'' in the set – this is not required of recursively enumerable sets.
* A [[recursively enumerable language]] is a recursively enumerable subset of a [[formal language]].
* The set of all provable sentences in an effectively presented axiomatic system is a recursively enumerable set.
* [[Matiyasevich's theorem]] states that every recursively enumerable set is a [[Diophantine set]] (the converse is trivially true).
* The [[simple set]]s are recursively enumerable but not recursive.
* The [[creative set]]s are recursively enumerable but not recursive.
* Any [[productive set]] is '''not''' recursively enumerable.
* Given a [[Gödel numbering]] &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; of the computable functions, the set &lt;math&gt;\{\langle i,x \rangle \mid \phi_i(x) \downarrow \}&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\langle i,x \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Cantor pairing function]] and &lt;math&gt;\phi_i(x)\downarrow&lt;/math&gt; indicates &lt;math&gt;\phi_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; is defined) is recursively enumerable (cf. picture for a fixed ''x''). This set encodes the [[halting problem]] as it describes  the input parameters for which each [[Turing machine]] halts.
* Given a Gödel numbering &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; of the computable functions, the set  &lt;math&gt;\lbrace \left \langle x, y, z \right \rangle \mid \phi_x(y)=z \rbrace&lt;/math&gt; is recursively enumerable. This set encodes the problem of deciding a function value.
* Given a partial function ''f'' from the natural numbers into the natural numbers, ''f'' is a partial recursive function if and only if the graph of ''f'',  that is, the set of all pairs &lt;math&gt;\langle x,f(x)\rangle&lt;/math&gt; such that ''f(x)'' is defined, is recursively enumerable.

==Properties==

If ''A'' and ''B'' are recursively enumerable sets then ''A'' ∩ ''B'', ''A'' ∪ ''B'' and ''A'' × ''B'' (with the ordered pair of natural numbers mapped to a single natural number with the [[Cantor pairing function]]) are recursively enumerable sets. The [[preimage]] of a recursively enumerable set under a partial recursive function is a recursively enumerable set.

A set is recursively enumerable if and only if it is at level &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1&lt;/math&gt; of the [[arithmetical hierarchy]].

A set &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is called '''co-recursively enumerable''' or '''co-r.e.''' if its [[complement (set theory)|complement]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N} \setminus T&lt;/math&gt; is recursively enumerable. Equivalently, a set is co-r.e. if and only if it is at level &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_1&lt;/math&gt; of the arithmetical hierarchy.

A set ''A'' is [[recursive set|recursive]] (synonym: computable) if and only if both ''A'' and the complement of ''A'' are recursively enumerable. A set is recursive if and only if it is either the range of an increasing total recursive function or finite.

Some pairs of recursively enumerable sets are [[effectively separable]] and some are not.

== Remarks ==
According to  the [[Church–Turing thesis]], any effectively calculable function is calculable by a [[Turing machine]], and thus a set ''S'' is recursively enumerable if and only if there is some [[algorithm]] which yields an enumeration of ''S''.  This cannot be taken as a formal definition, however, because the Church–Turing thesis is an informal conjecture rather than a formal axiom.

The definition of a recursively enumerable set as the ''domain'' of a partial function, rather than the ''range'' of a total recursive function, is common in contemporary texts.  This choice is motivated by the fact that in generalized recursion theories, such as [[Alpha recursion theory|α-recursion theory]], the definition corresponding to domains has been found to be more natural.  Other texts use the definition in terms of enumerations, which is equivalent for recursively enumerable sets.

A '''Reflective crack''' is a type of failure in [[Asphalt concrete|asphalt]] pavement, one of the most popular [[road surface]] types. Asphalt pavement is impacted by traffic and thermal loading. Due to loading, cracks can appear on pavement surface that can reduce the [[Pavement Condition Index]](PCI) dramatically. 

The pavement can be maintained by overlay. Cracks under the overlay can cause stress concentration at the bottom of the overlay. Due to the repeated stress concentration, a crack starts in the overlay that has a similar shape to the crack in the old pavement. This crack is called a "reflective crack".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nejad|first1=Fereidoon Moghadas|last2=Noory|first2=Alireza|last3=Toolabi|first3=Saeed|last4=Fallah|first4=Shahab|title=Effect of using geosynthetics on reflective crack prevention|journal=International Journal of Pavement Engineering|date=3 July 2015|volume=16|issue=6|pages=477–487|doi=10.1080/10298436.2014.943128|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10298436.2014.943128|issn=1029-8436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reflective crack can also open a way for water to enter the pavement's body and increase the deterioration rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nejad|first1=Fereidoon Moghadas|last2=Noory|first2=Alireza|last3=Toolabi|first3=Saeed|last4=Fallah|first4=Shahab|title=Effect of using geosynthetics on reflective crack prevention|journal=International Journal of Pavement Engineering|date=3 July 2015|volume=16|issue=6|pages=477–487|doi=10.1080/10298436.2014.943128|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10298436.2014.943128|issn=1029-8436}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflective cracks can also happen in overlays placed on joints or cracks in concrete pavements ([[Road_surface#Composite_pavement|composite pavements]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huang|first1=Yang H.|title=Pavement design and analysis|date=2004|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=0131424734|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Richard Dawkins: How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think'']]

'''''Richard Dawkins: How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think''''' is a [[festschrift]] of 25 essays written in recognition of the life and work of [[Richard Dawkins]]. It was published in 2006, to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the publication of ''[[The Selfish Gene]]''. A wide range of topics is covered from many fields including [[evolutionary biology]], [[philosophy]], and [[psychology]]. Space is also given to writers who are not in full agreement with Dawkins. The book is edited by two of Dawkins' former PhD students, [[Alan Grafen]] and [[Mark Ridley (zoologist)|Mark Ridley]]. ({{ISBN|9780199291168}})

==Reception==
The reviews of the book have been mixed, but the controversial title phrase, "How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think" has been explained by considering Dawkins to have worked as an influential educator and concise author, of ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', who promoted the key ideas of others about [[evolutionary biology]], also including some controversial ideas which are not as widely accepted.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite newspaper

&lt;/ref&gt;
As the author of a popular science book, Dawkins had popularized ideas by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George Williams]] about group selection, [[William D. Hamilton|William Hamilton]] on the theory of kin selection in evolution, biologist/[[geneticist]] [[John Maynard Smith]] on evolutionarily stable strategies, and [[Robert L.

[[Image:Roso schola copia.jpg|thumb|280px|Inauguration of the “House of the Philosopher” of the Schola Philosophicae Initiationis. On first plane there appear Mario Roso de Luna and Eduardo Alfonso.]]

The '''Schola Philosophicae Initiationis''' (School of Philosophical Initiation) was a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] [[splinter group]] created in [[Madrid]] in 1928 by Eduardo Alfonso and [[Mario Roso de Luna]] in response to what they considered the doctrinal deviations of the [[Theosophical Society]], especially in reference to the proclamation of [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] as the [[Theosophical Society#"The "World Teacher"|World Teacher]].

==Foundation==

In mid-1921, Mario Roso de Luna, with a dozen companions from Madrid, formed the ''Rama Hesperia,'' which kept close ties with the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]] in [[India]] as well as with the dissident [[Theosophical Society Pasadena]] in [[California]]. Around 1928,  Roso de Luna and his group founded the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiatic]] philosophical school ''Schola Philosophicae Initiationis'' (SPI) that was "a reaction against the instability and indiscipline of the Theosophical Society."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Alfonso, Eduardo: El porvenir de la Teosofía comprometido por la Sociedad Teosófica&lt;/ref&gt; The declared objectives of the SPI were "the comparative study of the philosophies, sciences and arts in their mutual relations, and promoting the health and culture of its members as well as their moral progress".&lt;ref&gt;Alfonso, Eduardo: La Casa del Filósofo&lt;/ref&gt;

The new School bought a property in [[Manzanares el Real]] in the [[Community of Madrid]] to build a center for advanced philosophical studies called ''The House of the Philosopher''. The School was based on three stages of knowledge "as corresponds to any initiatic society and consequently to the three objects of the Theosophical Society, that deep inside are nothing but the three initiatic grades of all corresponding institutions which, having been misunderstood and disrespected, have led the T.S. to disunity and mental anarchy".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The disciples of the SPI followed a gradual and methodical program of studies covering the three stages: the first, studies on [[Hygiene]] and [[Morality|Morals]]; the second on [[Science]] and [[Nature]]; and the third on [[Psychology]] and [[Philosophy]].

==Decline and dissolution==

Mario Roso de Luna died in 1931, after which Dr. Eduardo Alfonso became the head of the School, continuing the instruction of disciples. However, after 1936, the [[Spanish Civil War]] caused the suspension of many of the philosophical and cultural activities in Madrid. At the end of the Civil War, Eduardo Alfonso was tried according to the “Law for the Repression of Masonry and Communism” and sentenced to several years of imprisonment which he served in a Burgos prison from 1942 to 1948. After serving his time, Alfonso was exiled to Latin America until 1966 when he returned to his Country.

In [[zoological nomenclature]], a '''subphylum''' is a [[taxonomic rank]] below the rank of [[phylum]]. 

The taxonomic rank of "[[subdivision (rank)|subdivision]]" in [[fungi ]] and [[plant taxonomy]] is equivalent to "subphylum" in zoological taxonomy. 

== Taxonomic rank ==
Subphylum is:
#subordinate to the [[phylum]] 
#superordinate to the '''infraphylum'''.

Where convenient, subphyla in turn may be divided into '''infraphyla'''; in turn such an '''infraphylum''' also would be superordinate to any classes or superclasses in the [[hierarchy]].

== Examples ==
Not all fauna phyla are divided into subphyla. Those that are include: 
*[[Arthropod]]a: divided into subphyla [[Trilobitomorpha]], [[Chelicerata]], [[Myriapoda]], [[Hexapoda]] and [[Crustacean|Crustacea]],
*[[Brachiopoda]]: divided into subphyla [[Linguliformea]], [[Craniformea]] and [[Rhynchonelliformea]],
*[[Chordata]]: divided into [[Tunicate|Tunicata]], [[Lancelet|Cephalochordata]], and its largest subphylum [[Vertebrata]].

Examples of '''infraphyla''' include the [[Mycetozoa]] and the [[Gnathostomata]].

'''Sudan University of Science and Technology''' (abbreviated '''SUST''') is the largest public [[university]] in [[Sudan]], with ten (10) campuses in the [[Khartoum (state)|state of Khartoum]]. The main campus is located in Mogren area ([[:ar:المقرن (الخرطوم)|المقرن]]  the confluence of the White [[White Nile]] and the Blue [[Blue Nile]]). SUST founded in '''1902''' as Khartoum Technical School and School of Commerce. 

==History==
The school began as the Khartoum Technical School and School of Commerce in 1902. The School of Radiology (1932) and School of Arts (1946),  are then merged to Khartoum Technical School and School of Commerce to form Khartoum Technical Institute (KTI) in 1950. then the [[Shambat (city)|Shambat]] Institute of Agriculture (1954), Khartoum Senior Trade School (1962), Institute of Music and Drama and the Higher Institute of Physical Education (1969) are merged with KTI and renamed as Khartoum Polytechnic Institute (KP) in 1975. KP is accredited in 1990 as Sudan University of Science and Technology.

'''Swaralipi''' ('''Akar Matrik Swaralipi''' {{lang-bn|স্বরলিপি বা আকারমাত্রিক স্বরলিপি}}) is any system used in [[sheet music]] in order to represent aurally perceived [[music]] through the use of written notes for [[Indian classical music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nayar|first=Sobhana|title=Bhatkhande's Contribution to Music: A Historical Perspective|year=1989|publisher=Papular Prakshan PVT LTD|location=Delhi|isbn=086132238X|page=129|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQ74dNGEnoEC&amp;pg=PA294&amp;dq=%22swaralipi%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z25pUuGtEYj-rAfHxoCICQ&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22swaralipi%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Indian scholar and musical theorist [[Pingala]] (c. 200 BC), in his ''Chanda Sutra'', used marks indicating long and short syllables to indicate meters in Sanskrit poetry.

In the notation of Indian [[rāga]], a solfege-like system called [[swara|sargam]] is used. As in Western solfege, there are names for the seven basic pitches of a major scale (Shadja, Rishabh, Gandhar, Madhyam, Pancham, Dhaivat and Nishad, usually shortened Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni). The tonic of any scale is named Sa, and the dominant Pa. Sa is fixed in any scale, and Pa is fixed at a fifth above it (a [[Pythagorean tuning|Pythagorean]] fifth rather than an [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered]] fifth). These two notes are known as achala swar ('fixed notes'). Each of the other five notes, Re, Ga, ma, Dha and Ni, can take a 'regular' (shuddha) pitch, which is equivalent to its pitch in a standard major scale (thus, shuddha Re, the second degree of the scale, is a whole-step higher than Sa), or an altered pitch, either a half-step above or half-step below the shuddha pitch. Re, Ga, Dha and Ni all have altered partners that are a half-step lower (Komal-"flat") (thus, komal Re is a half-step higher than Sa). Ma has an altered partner that is a half-step higher (teevra-"sharp") (thus, tivra Ma is an augmented fourth above Sa). Re, Ga, ma, Dha and Ni are called vikrut swar ('movable notes'). In the written system of Indian notation devised by Ravi Shankar, the pitches are represented by Western letters. Capital letters are used for the achala swar, and for the higher variety of all the vikrut swar. Lowercase letters are used for the lower variety of the vikrut swar.

The T-beam has a big disadvantage compared to an [[i-beam|{{ibeam}}-beam]] because it has no bottom flange with which to deal with [[tensile force]]s. One way to make a T-beam more efficient structurally is to use an inverted T-beam with a [[floor slab]] or [[bridge deck]] joining the tops of the beams. Done properly, the slab acts as the compression flange.

==History==

A T-beam is a structural element able to withstand large loads by resistance in the beam or by internal reinforcements. In some respects, the T-beam dates back to the first time a human formed a bridge with a pier and a deck. After all, a T-beam is, in one sense, no more than a pillar with a horizontal bed on top, or, in the case of the inverted T-beam, on the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ambrose|first1=James|last2=Tripeny|first2=Patrick|title=Simplified design of concrete structures.|date=2007|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester|isbn=978-0-470-04414-8|page=104|edition=8th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Br9xeWVGoPkC&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upright portion carrying the tension of the beam is termed a web or stem, and the horizontal part that carries the compression is termed a flange. However, the materials used have changed over the years but the basic structure is the same. T-beams structures such as highway overpasses, buildings and parking garages, have extra material added on the underside where the web joins the flange to reduce the T-beam’s vulnerability to shear stress.&lt;ref name=Chajes/&gt; However, when one investigates more deeply into the design of T-beams, some distinctions appear.

==Designs==
The T-beam, though simple in design, contains multiple design elements of interest. Unlike an I-beam, a T-beam lacks a bottom flange, which carries savings in terms of materials, but at the loss of resistance to tensile forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Furlong|first1=Richard W.|last2=Ferguson|first2=Phil M.|last3=Ma|first3=John S.|title=Shear and Anchorage Study of Reinforcement in Inverted T-Beam Bend Cap Girders|journal=Research Report No. 113-4|date=July 1971|url=http://library.ctr.utexas.edu/digitized/texasarchive/phase1/113-4-chr.pdf|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parking garages, however, this lack of a bottom flange on a T-beam serves as an advantage in that the stem rests on shelf making the flange the upper deck. T- beam designs come in many sizes, lengths and widths depending on what the structure is and its compression tension needs. However, the simplicity of the T-beam is in question by some who would rightly test more than one complex structure; for example, a group of researchers tested pretension inverted T-beams with circular web openings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheng|first1=Hock Tian|last2=Mohammed|first2=Bashar S.|last3=Mustapha|first3=Kamal Nasharuddin|title=Experimental and analytical analysis of pretensioned inverted T-beam with circular web openings|journal=International Journal of Mechanics and Materials in Design|date=3 March 2009|volume=5|issue=2|pages=203–215|doi=10.1007/s10999-009-9096-4|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10999-009-9096-4|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with mixed but generally favorable results. Thus, in some cases, the extra time and effort invested in creating a more complex structure proves worthwhile. A simpler matter to consider is that of which material or materials make up the construction of T-beams.

==Materials==

===Steel T-beams===
Steel T-beams manufacturing process includes: hot rolling, extrusion, plate welding and pressure fitting. A process of large rollers connecting two steel plates by pinching them together called pressure fitting is a common process for non-load bearing beams. The reality is that for most roadways and bridges today, it is more practical to bring concrete into the design as well. Most T-beam construction is not with steel or concrete alone, but rather with the composite of the two, namely, reinforced concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=University|first1=Jack C. McCormac, Clemson University, Russell H. Brown, Clemson|title=Design of reinforced concrete|date=2014|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-1-118-12984-5|edition=Ninth edition, ACI 318-11 Code Edition.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5UUcAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the term could refer to any one of a number of means of reinforcement, generally, the definition is limited to concrete poured around rebar. This shows that in considering materials available for a task, engineers need to consider the possibility that no one single material is adequate for the job; rather, combining multiple materials together may be the best solution. Thus, steel and concrete together can prove ideal.

===Reinforced concrete T-beams===
Concrete alone is brittle and thus overly subject to the shear stresses a T-beam faces where the web and flange meet. This is the reason that steel is combined with concrete in T-beams. A problem of shear stress can lead to failures of flanges detaching from webs when under load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paramasivam|first1=P.|last2=Lee|first2=S. L.|last3=Lim|first3=T. Y.|title=Shear and moment capacity of reinforced steel-fibre-concrete beams|journal=Magazine of Concrete Research|date=9 January 1987|volume=39|issue=140|pages=148–160|doi=10.1680/macr.1987.39.140.148|url=http://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/content/article/10.1680/macr.1987.39.140.148|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could prove catastrophic if allowed to occur in real life; hence, the very real need to mitigate that possibility with reinforcement for concrete T-beams. In such composite structures, many questions arise as to the particulars of the design, including what the ideal distribution of concrete and steel might be: “To evaluate an objective function, a ratio of steel to concrete costs is necessary”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chou|first1=Takashi|title=Optimum Reinforced Concrete T-Beam Sections|journal=Journal of the Structural Division|date=August 1977|volume=103|issue=8|pages=1605–1617|url=http://cedb.asce.org/cgi/WWWdisplay.cgi?7520#|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstrates that for all aspects of the design of composite T-beams, equations are made only if one has adequate information. Still, there are aspects of design that some may not even have considered, such as the possibility of using external fabric-based reinforcement, as described by Chajes et al., who say of their tested beams, “All the beams failed in shear and those with composite reinforcement displayed excellent bond characteristics. For the beams with external reinforcement, increases in ultimate strength of 60 to 150 percent were achieved”.&lt;ref name=Chajes&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chajes|first1=Michael J.|last2=Januszka|first2=Ted F.|last3=Mertz|first3=Dennis R.|last4=Thomson|first4=Theodore A., Jr.|last5=Finch|first5=William W., Jr.|title=Shear Strengthening of Reinforced Concrete Beams Using Externally Applied Composite Fabrics|journal=Structural Journal|date=1 May 1995|volume=92|issue=3|doi=10.14359/1130|url=http://www.concrete.org/publications/internationalconcreteabstractsportal?m=details&amp;i=1130|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to resistance to shear forces, external reinforcement is a valid option to consider. Thus, overall, the multiple important aspects of T-beam design impress themselves upon the student of engineering.

==Issues==
An issue with the T-beam compared to the I-beam is the lack of the bottom flange. In addition, this makes the beam not as versatile because of the weaker side not having the flange making it have less tensile strength.

Concrete beams are often poured integrally with the slab, forming a much stronger “T” – shaped beam. These beams are very efficient because the slab portion carries the compressive loads and the reinforcing bars placed at the bottom of the stem carry the tension. A T-beam typically has a narrower stem than an ordinary rectangular beam. These stems are typically spaced from 4’-0” apart to more than
12’-0”. The slab portion above the stem is designed as a one-way slab spanning between stems.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Double-T beams==
{{Main|Double tee}}
A double-T beam or double tee beam is a load-bearing structure that resemble two T-beams connected to each other. Double tees are manufactured from [[prestressed concrete]] using pretensioning beds of about {{Convert|200|ft|adj=on}} to {{Convert|500|ft|adj=on}} long. The strong bond of the flange (horizontal section) and the two webs (vertical members) creates a structure that is capable of withstanding high loads while having a long span. The typical sizes of double tees are up to {{Convert|15|ft}} for flange width, up to {{Convert|5|ft}} for web depth and up to {{Convert|80|ft}} or more for span length.&lt;ref name=npca&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gurley|first1=Evan|last2=Hanson|first2=Kayla|title=Strength to a Double Tee|url=http://precast.org/2014/10/strength-double-tee/|accessdate=26 April 2015|work=Precast Solutions Magazine|date=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30045">'''Universal grammar''' ('''UG''') in [[linguistics]], is the theory of the [[genetics|genetic]] component of the [[language faculty]], usually credited to [[Noam Chomsky]]. The basic postulate of UG is that a certain set of [[Grammar|structural rules]] are [[A priori and a posteriori|innate]] to humans, independent of [[sensory experience]]. With more linguistic stimuli received in the course of [[psychological development]], children then adopt specific [[syntactic rule]]s that conform to UG.&lt;ref name="toolmodule2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/outil_rouge06.html|title=Tool Module: Chomsky's Universal Grammar|author=Noam Chomsky|accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes known as "mental grammar", and stands contrasted with other "grammars", e.g. [[Prescriptive grammar|prescriptive]], [[Descriptive grammar|descriptive]] and [[Pedagogical grammar|pedagogical]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An A-Z of ELT|date=2006|publisher=Macmillan Education|isbn=1-4050-7063-3|page=92|last1=Thornbury|first1=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04v382j|title=First Words: How do children develop language?|date=16 December 2014|work=BBC Radio 4|department=Word of Mouth|last1=Szendroi|first1=Kriszta|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advocates of this theory emphasize and partially rely on [[Poverty of the stimulus|the poverty of the stimulus]] (POS) argument and the existence of some universal properties of natural [[human languages]]. However, the latter has not been firmly established, as some linguists have argued languages are so diverse that such universality is rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |last2=Levinson |first2=Stephen C. |title=The myth of language universals: Language diversity and its importance for cognitive science |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |date=26 October 2009 |volume=32 |issue=05 |pages=429-48 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X0999094X |pmid=19857320 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-myth-of-language-universals%3A-language-diversity-Evans-Levinson/1202032fc27b5da12362d82d48eed5e1c34c166f |dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727171702/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1f31/330319b363499ec974b27b7678d96025cde9.pdf |archivedate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a matter of empirical investigation to determine precisely what properties are universal and what linguistic capacities are innate.

== Argument ==
The theory of universal grammar proposes that if human beings are brought up under normal conditions (not those of extreme [[sensory deprivation]]), then they will always develop language with certain properties (e.g., distinguishing [[noun]]s from [[verb]]s, or distinguishing [[function word]]s from [[content word]]s). The theory proposes that there is an innate, genetically determined language faculty that knows these rules, making it easier and faster for children to learn to speak than it otherwise would be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/outil_rouge06.html|title=Tool Module: Chomsky’s Universal Grammar|website=thebrain.mcgill.ca|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This faculty does not know the vocabulary of any particular language (so words and their meanings must be learned), and there remain several parameters which can vary freely among languages (such as whether adjectives come before or after nouns) which must also be learned.

As Chomsky puts it, "Evidently, development of language in the individual must involve three factors: (1) genetic endowment, which sets limits on the attainable languages, thereby making language acquisition possible; (2) external data, converted to the experience that selects one or another language within a narrow range; (3) principles not specific to the Faculty of Language."&lt;ref name="Chomsky 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |year=2007 |chapter=Approaching UG from Below |title=Interfaces + Recursion = Language? Chomsky's Minimalism and the View from Syntax-Semantics |series=Studies in Generative Grammar |editor=Hans-Martin Gärtner |editor2=Uli Sauerland |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3-11-018872-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, aspects of universal grammar seem describable in terms of general details regarding cognition. For example, if a predisposition to categorize events and objects as different classes of things is part of human cognition, and directly results in nouns and verbs showing up in all languages, then it could be assumed that rather than this aspect of universal grammar being specific to language, it is more generally a part of human cognition. To distinguish properties of languages that can be traced to other facts regarding cognition from properties of languages that cannot, the abbreviation UG* can be used. UG is the term often used by Chomsky for those aspects of the human brain which cause language to be the way that it is (i.e. are universal grammar in the sense used here) but here for discussion, it is used for those aspects which are furthermore specific to language (thus UG, as Chomsky uses it, is just an abbreviation for universal grammar, but UG* as used here is a subset of universal grammar).

In the same article, Chomsky casts the theme of a larger research program in terms of the following question: "How little can be attributed to UG while still accounting for the variety of 'I-languages' attained, relying on third factor principles?" (I-languages meaning internal languages, the brain states that correspond to knowing how to speak and understand a particular language, and third factor principles meaning (3) in the previous quote).

Chomsky has speculated that UG might be extremely simple and abstract, for example only a mechanism for combining symbols in a particular way, which he calls "[[Merge (linguistics)|merge]]". The following quote shows that Chomsky does not use the term "UG" in the narrow sense UG* suggested above:

"The conclusion that merge falls within UG holds whether such recursive generation is unique to FL (faculty of language) or is
appropriated from other systems."

In other words, merge is seen as part of UG because it causes language to be the way it is, universal, and is not part of the environment or general properties independent of genetics and environment. Merge is part of universal grammar whether it is specific to language, or whether, as Chomsky suggests, it is also used for an example in mathematical thinking.

The distinction is important because there is a long history of argument about UG*, whereas most people working on language agree that there is universal grammar. Many people assume that Chomsky means UG* when he writes UG (and in some cases he might actually mean UG* [though not in the passage quoted above]).

Some students of universal grammar study a variety of grammars to extract generalizations called [[linguistic universal]]s, often in the form of "If X holds true, then Y occurs." These have been extended to a variety of traits, such as the phonemes found in languages, the word orders which languages choose, and the reasons why children exhibit certain linguistic behaviors.

Later linguists who have influenced this theory include Chomsky and [[Richard Montague]], developing their version of this theory as they considered issues of the [[argument from poverty of the stimulus]] to arise from the constructivist approach to linguistic theory. The application of the idea of universal grammar to the study of second language acquisition (SLA) is represented mainly in the work of McGill linguist [[Lydia White]].

Syntacticians generally hold that there are parametric points of variation between languages, although heated debate occurs over whether UG constraints are essentially universal due to being "hard-wired" (Chomsky's [[principles and parameters]] approach), a [[logical consequence]] of a specific syntactic architecture (the [[GPSG|generalized phrase structure]] approach) or the result of functional constraints on communication (the [[systemic functional linguistics|functionalist]] approach).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mark C.

== Relation to the evolution of language ==

In an article titled, "The Faculty of Language: What Is It, Who Has It, and How Did It Evolve?"&lt;ref name="Hauser"&gt;{{Citation | last = Hauser | first = Marc | last2 = Chomsky | first2 = Noam | author2-link = Noam Chomsky | last3 = Fitch | first3 = William Tecumseh | author3-link = W. Tecumseh Fitch | title = The Faculty of Language:  What Is It, Who Has It, and How Did It Evolve? | journal = Science | volume = 298 | pages = 1569–1579 | date = 22 November 2002 | url = http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf | doi = 10.1126/science.298.5598.1569 | pmid = 12446899 | issue = 5598 | access-date = 28 December 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131228122250/http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf | archive-date = 28 December 2013 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch present the three leading hypotheses for how language evolved and brought humans to the point where they have a universal grammar.

The first hypothesis states that the faculty of language in the broad sense (FLb) is strictly homologous to animal communication.
This means that homologous aspects of the faculty of language exist in non-human animals.

The second hypothesis states that the FLb is a derived, uniquely human, adaptation for language. This hypothesis holds that individual traits were subject to natural selection and came to be specialized for humans.

The third hypothesis states that only the faculty of language in the narrow sense (FLn) is unique to humans. It holds that while mechanisms of the FLb are present in both human and non-human animals, the computational mechanism of recursion is recently evolved solely in humans.&lt;ref name="Hauser" /&gt; This is the hypothesis which most closely aligns to the typical theory of universal grammar championed by Chomsky.

== History ==
The idea of a universal grammar can be traced back to [[Roger Bacon]]'s observations in his {{circa|lk=no|1245}} ''[[Overview of Grammar]]'' and {{circa|lk=no|1268}} ''[[Grammatica Graeca|Greek Grammar]]'' that all languages are built upon a common grammar, even though it may undergo incidental variations; and the 13th century [[speculative grammar]]ians who, following Bacon, postulated universal rules underlying all grammars. The concept of a universal grammar or language was at the core of the 17th century projects for [[philosophical language]]s. There is a Scottish school of universal grammarians from the 18th century, as distinguished from the philosophical language project, which included authors such as [[James Beattie (writer)|James Beattie]], [[Hugh Blair]], [[James Burnett]], [[James Harris (grammarian)|James Harris]], and [[Adam Smith]]. The article on grammar in the first edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (1771) contains an extensive section titled "Of Universal Grammar".

The idea rose to prominence and influence, in modern linguistics with theories from Chomsky and Montague in the 1950s–1970s, as part of the "[[linguistics wars]]".

During the early 20th century, in contrast, language was usually understood from a [[behaviourist]] perspective, suggesting that language acquisition, like any other kind of learning, could be explained by a succession of trials, errors, and rewards for success.&lt;ref name=toolmodule&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, children learned their mother tongue by simple imitation, through listening and repeating what adults said.  For example, when a child says "milk" and the mother will smile and give her some as a result, the child will find this outcome rewarding, thus enhancing the child's language development.&lt;ref&gt;Ambridge &amp; Lieven, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chomsky's theory ==

{{further|Language acquisition device|Generative grammar|X-bar theory|Government and binding|Principles and parameters|Minimalist program}}
Chomsky argued that the [[human brain]] contains a limited set of constraints for organizing language. This implies in turn that all languages have a common structural basis: the set of rules known as "universal grammar".

Speakers proficient in a language know which expressions are acceptable in their language and which are unacceptable. The key puzzle is how speakers come to know these restrictions of their language, since expressions that violate those restrictions are not present in the input, indicated as such. Chomsky argued that this [[poverty of stimulus]] means that Skinner's behaviourist perspective cannot explain language acquisition. The absence of negative evidence—evidence that an expression is part of a class of ungrammatical sentences in a given language—is the core of his argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/static/5007/sasspdf/whatexactlyisUG.pdf|title=What exactly is Universal Grammar, and has anyone seen it?|last=Northumbria University|first=Ewa Dąbrowska|date=|website=www.northumbria.ac.uk|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in English, an interrogative pronoun like ''what'' cannot be related to a predicate within a relative clause:

: *"What did John meet a man who sold?"

Such expressions are not available to language learners: they are, by hypothesis, ungrammatical. Speakers of the local language do not use them, or note them as unacceptable to language learners. Universal grammar offers an explanation for the presence of the poverty of the stimulus, by making certain restrictions into universal characteristics of human languages. Language learners are consequently never tempted to generalize in an illicit fashion.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

== Presence of creole languages ==

The presence of [[creole language]]s is sometimes cited as further support for this theory, especially by [[Derek Bickerton|Bickerton's]] controversial [[language bioprogram theory]]. Creoles are languages that develop and form when disparate societies come together and are forced to devise a new system of communication. The system used by the original speakers is typically an inconsistent mix of vocabulary items, known as a [[pidgin]]. As these speakers' children begin to acquire their first language, they use the pidgin input to effectively create their own original language, known as a [[Creole language|creole]]. Unlike pidgins, creoles have [[native speaker]]s (those with acquisition from early childhood) and make use of a full, systematic grammar.

According to Bickerton, the idea of universal grammar is supported by creole languages because certain features are shared by virtually all in the category. For example, their default point of reference in time (expressed by bare verb stems) is not the present moment, but the past. Using pre-verbal [[auxiliary verb|auxiliaries]], they uniformly express [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], and [[grammatical mood|mood]]. [[Negative concord]] occurs, but it affects the verbal subject (as opposed to the object, as it does in languages like [[Spanish language|Spanish]]). Another similarity among creoles can be seen in the fact that questions are created simply by changing the intonation of a declarative sentence, not its word order or content.

However, extensive work by Carla Hudson-Kam and Elissa Newport suggests that creole languages may not support a universal grammar at all. In a series of experiments, Hudson-Kam and Newport looked at how children and adults learn artificial grammars. They found that children tend to ignore minor variations in the input when those variations are infrequent, and reproduce only the most frequent forms. In doing so, they tend to standardize the language that they hear around them. Hudson-Kam and Newport hypothesize that in a pidgin-development situation (and in the real-life situation of a deaf child whose parents are or were disfluent signers), children systematize the language they hear, based on the probability and frequency of forms, and not that which has been suggested on the basis of a universal grammar.&lt;ref name="Kam"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hudson Kam | first1 = C.

Many researchers of universal grammar argue against a concept of [[relexification]], which says that a language replaces its lexicon almost entirely with that of another. This goes against universalist ideas of a universal grammar, which has an innate grammar.

== Criticisms ==
[[Geoffrey Sampson]] maintains that universal grammar theories are not [[falsifiable]] and are therefore [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]. He argues that the grammatical "rules" linguists posit are simply post-hoc observations about existing languages, rather than predictions about what is possible in a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sampson |first=Geoffrey |year=2005 |title=The 'Language Instinct' Debate: Revised Edition |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-0-8264-7385-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Jeffrey Elman]] argues that the unlearnability of languages assumed by universal grammar is based on a too-strict, "worst-case" model of grammar, that is not in keeping with any actual grammar. In keeping with these points, James Hurford argues that the postulate of a [[language acquisition device]] (LAD) essentially amounts to the trivial claim that languages are learnt by humans, and thus, that the LAD is less a theory than an [[explanandum]] looking for theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=James R. Hurford |chapter=Nativist and Functional Explanations in Language Acquisition |editor=I. M. Roca |title=Logical Issues in Language Acquisition |publisher=Foris Publications |location=Dordrecht, Holland and Providence, Rhode Island |year=1995 |page=88 |url=http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~jim/rocapaper.pdf |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morten H. Christiansen]] and Nick Chater have argued that the relatively fast-changing nature of language would prevent the slower-changing genetic structures from ever catching up, undermining the possibility of a genetically hard-wired universal grammar. Instead of an innate universal grammar, they claim, "apparently arbitrary aspects of linguistic structure may result from general learning and processing biases deriving from the structure of thought processes, perceptuo-motor factors, cognitive limitations, and pragmatics".&lt;ref name="Christiansen, Morten H 2008"&gt;Christiansen, Morten H. and [[Chater, Nick]]. "Language as Shaped by the Brain". ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 31.5 (2008): 489–509.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinzen summarizes the most common criticisms of universal grammar:
* Universal grammar has no coherent formulation and is indeed unnecessary.
* Universal grammar is in conflict with biology: it cannot have evolved by standardly accepted [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] evolutionary principles.
* There are no linguistic universals: universal grammar is refuted by abundant variation at all levels of linguistic organization, which lies at the heart of human faculty of language.&lt;ref name="Hinzen"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hinzen |first=Wolfram |title=The philosophical significance of Universal Grammar |journal=Language Sciences |volume=34 |issue=5 |date=September 2012 |pages=635–649 |doi=10.1016/j.langsci.2012.03.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, it has been suggested that people learn about probabilistic patterns of word distributions in their language, rather than hard and fast rules (see [[Distributional hypothesis]]).&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McDonald |first=Scott |last2=Ramscar |first2=Michael |year=2001 |title=Testing the distributional hypothesis: The influence of context on judgements of semantic similarity |journal=Proceedings of the 23rd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society |pages=611–616 |accessdate=June 10, 2014 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.104.7535}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, children overgeneralize the past tense marker "ed" and conjugate irregular verbs incorrectly, producing forms like ''goed'' and ''eated'' and correct these errors over time.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fernández |first=Eva M. |author2=Helen Smith Cairns |title=Fundamentals of Psycholinguistics |location=Chichester, West Sussex, England:  |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4051-9147-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been proposed that the poverty of the stimulus problem can be largely avoided, if it is assumed that children employ ''similarity-based generalization'' strategies in language learning, generalizing about the usage of new words from similar words that they already know how to use.&lt;ref name="Yarlett"&gt;{{cite web |last=Yarlett |first=Daniel G. |last2=Ramscar |first2=Michael J. A. |year=2008 |title=Language Learning Through Similarity-Based Generalization|accessdate=June 10, 2014 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.393.7298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Language acquisition]] researcher Michael Ramscar has suggested that when children erroneously expect an ungrammatical form that then never occurs, the repeated failure of expectation serves as a form of implicit [[negative feedback]] that allows them to correct their errors over time such as how children correct grammar generalizations like ''goed'' to ''went'' through repetitive failure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramscar"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ramscar |first=Michael |last2=Yarlett |first2=Daniel |year=2007 |title=Linguistic self-correction in the absence of feedback: A new approach to the logical problem of language acquisition |journal=Cognitive Science |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=927–960 |doi=10.1080/03640210701703576 |pmid=21635323}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that word learning is a probabilistic, error-driven process, rather than a process of [[fast mapping]], as many nativists assume.

In the domain of field research, the [[Pirahã language]] is claimed to be a counterexample to the basic tenets of universal grammar. This research has been led by [[Daniel Everett]]. Among other things, this language is alleged to lack all evidence for [[recursion]], including [[Dependent clause|embedded clauses]], as well as [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifiers]] and [[colour]] terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Everett |first=Daniel L. |title=Cultural Constraints on Grammar and Cognition in Pirahã: Another Look at the Design Features of Human Language |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=46 |issue=4 |date=August–October 2005 |pages=621–646 |url=http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~kay/Everett.CA.Piraha.pdf |doi=10.1086/431525}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the writings of Everett, the Pirahã showed these linguistic shortcomings not because they were simple-minded, but because their culture—which emphasized concrete matters in the present and also lacked creation myths and traditions of art making—did not necessitate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schuessler |first=Jennifer |title=How Do You Say 'Disagreement' in Pirahã? |work=The New York Times |date=March 22, 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/22/books/a-new-book-and-film-about-rare-amazonian-language.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |page=C1 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other linguists have argued, however, that some of these properties have been misanalyzed, and that others are actually expected under current theories of universal grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, et al., 2007 Pirahã Exceptionality: a Reassessment [http://stirling.kent.ac.uk/SE551/Week10/Nevins%20et%20al%202007%20Piraha%20Exceptionality.pdf]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521063250/http://stirling.kent.ac.uk/SE551/Week10/Nevins%20et%20al%202007%20Piraha%20Exceptionality.pdf |date=May 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other linguists have attempted to reassess Pirahã to see if it did indeed use recursion. In a corpus analysis of the Pirahã language, linguists failed to disprove Everett's arguments against universal grammar and the lack of recursion in Pirahã. However, they also stated that there was "no strong evidence for the lack of recursion either" and they provided "suggestive evidence that Pirahã may have sentences with recursive
structures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=August 2012 |first=Steven T. |last=Piantadosi |first2=Laura |last2=Stearns |first3=Daniel L. |last3=Everett |first4=Edward |last4=Gibson |title=A corpus analysis of Pirahã grammar: An investigation of recursion |url=http://tedlab.mit.edu/tedlab_website/researchpapers/Piantadosi_et_al_2012_LSAtalk_Piraha.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Everett has gone as far as claiming that universal grammar does not exist. In his words, "universal grammar doesn't seem to work, there doesn't seem to be much evidence for [it]. And what can we put in its place? A complex interplay of factors, of which culture, the values human beings share, plays a major role in structuring the way that we talk and the things that we talk about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McCrum |first=Robert |title=Daniel Everett: 'There is no such thing as universal grammar |work=The Observer |date=March 24, 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/25/daniel-everett-human-language-piraha |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Tomasello]], a developmental psychologist, also supports this claim, arguing that "although many aspects of human linguistic competence have indeed evolved biologically, specific grammatical principles and constructions have not. And universals in the grammatical structure of different languages have come from more general processes and constraints of human cognition, communication, and vocal-auditory processing, operating during the conventionalization and transmission of the particular grammatical constructions of particular linguistic communities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Michael Tomasello|Tomasello]] |first=Michael |year=2008 |title=Origins of human communication |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-51520-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
