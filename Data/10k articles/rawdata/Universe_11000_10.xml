== Uses ==
1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane is a [[non-flammable]] gas used primarily as a "high-temperature" refrigerant for domestic [[refrigeration]] and [[Automobile air conditioning|automobile air conditioners]].  These devices began using 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane in the early 1990s as a replacement for the more environmentally harmful [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]] and retrofit kits are available to convert units that were originally [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]]-equipped.  Other uses include plastic foam blowing, as a cleaning solvent, a propellant for the delivery of pharmaceuticals (e.g. [[bronchodilator]]s), wine cork removers, [[gas duster]]s, such as [[Dust-Off]], and in air driers for removing the moisture from [[compressed air]].  1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane has also been used to cool computers in some [[overclocking]] attempts. It is the refrigerant used in plumbing pipe freeze kits. It is also commonly used as a propellant for [[airsoft]] airguns. The gas is often mixed with a silicone-based lubricant.
[[File:Tetrafluoroethane liquid.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tetrafluoroethane, when compressed as inside gas duster cans, is a clear liquid which boils when exposed to atmospheric pressure at room temperature (as seen here) and can be extracted from common [[Gas duster|"canned air"]] canisters by simply inverting them during use.]]

1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane is also being considered as an [[organic solvent]] suitable for extraction of [[flavor]] and [[fragrance]] compounds, as a possible alternative to other organic solvents and [[supercritical carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1021/bk-2005-0908.ch003 |chapter=1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane (R-134a): A Selective Solvent for the Generation of Flavor and Fragrance Ingredients |title=Natural Flavors and Fragrances |series=ACS Symposium Series |year=2005 |last1=Corr |first1=Stuart |isbn=0-8412-3904-5 |volume=908 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/B412697A|title=Solubility of unsaturated carboxylic acids in supercritical 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC 134a) and a methodology for the separation of ternary mixtures|year=2005|last1=Abbott|first1=Andrew P.|last2=Eltringham|first2=Wayne|last3=Hope|first3=Eric G.|last4=Nicola|first4=Mazin|journal=Green Chemistry|volume=7|issue=4|pages=210 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved on 2011-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the time that it was active, this Wisconsin-specific ban contained loopholes.  For example, it was legal for a person to purchase [[gas duster]] containers with any amount of the chemical because in that instance the chemical is neither intended to be a refrigerant{{hsp}}&lt;ref name="Ref-1" /&gt; nor is HFC-134a included in the §&amp;nbsp;7671a listing of class I and class II substances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/ozone/science/ods/classone.html Class I Ozone-depleting Substances].

== History ==
1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane first appeared in the early 1990s as a replacement for [[dichlorodifluoromethane]] (R-12), which has ozone depleting properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Franklin J  |title=The Atmospheric Degradation and Impact of 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluorethane (Hydrofluorocarbon 134a)|journal=Chemosphere |year=1993|pages=1565–1601|volume=27|doi=10.1016/0045-6535(93)90251-Y| issue= 8|bibcode=1993Chmsp..27.1565F}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane has been atmospherically modeled for its impact on depleting ozone and as a contributor to global warming. Research suggests that over the past 10 years the concentration of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane has increased significantly in the Earth's atmosphere, with a recent study revealing a doubling in atmospheric concentration between 2001 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Production ==
Tetrafluoroethane is typically made by reacting [[trichloroethylene]] with [[hydrogen fluoride]]:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.solvay.us/en/binaries/PSS-Tetrafluoroethane-164368.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Aerosol cans containing 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, when inverted, become effective freeze sprays. Under pressure, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane is compressed into a liquid, which upon vaporization absorbs a significant amount of [[thermal energy]]. As a result, it will greatly lower the temperature of any object it contacts as it evaporates. This can result in [[frostbite]] when it contacts skin, as well as blindness upon eye contact.

[[Image:NASA Elbe flood 2002 before after.jpg|thumb|Elbe flood 2002 before after]]
In August 2002 a [[flood]] caused by over a week of continuous heavy rains ravaged [[Europe]], killing dozens, dispossessing thousands, and causing damage of billions of [[euro]]s in [[Russia]], [[the Czech Republic]], [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]] and [[Croatia]].  The flood was of a magnitude expected to occur roughly [[100-year flood|once a century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Wild Weather Has Happened Before, Will Again | date=19 August 2002 | url =https://www.usatoday.com/weather/news/2002/2002-08-18-wildweather.htm | work =USA Today | accessdate =28 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there were approximately 250 deaths by this natural disaster. Unprecedented flood heights were recorded and over 110 people died. These were the most costly floods affecting Europe in years. As of December 2002, total economic damage estimates exceeded 15 billion Euro. 15% of this cost was insured. &lt;ref&gt;Helmer, M. &amp; Hilhorst, D.J.M. 2006, "Natural disasters and climate change", Disasters, vol. 30, no. 1, pp. 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the floods==
Flooding resulted from the passage of two [[Genoa low]] pressure systems (named Hanne and Ilse by the [[Free University of Berlin]]) which brought warm moist air from the Mediterranean northwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=System Explanation of Floods in Central Europe|url=http://nadine.helmholtz-eos.de/risks/flood/info/fl_system_en.html|publisher=Helmholtz-Association|accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of [[El Niño]] are believed to have possibly contributed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |    title=El Nino| date=11 August 2002 |  url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/2186275.stm |work=BBC News |  accessdate =28 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although others disagree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=What's Behind the Weather? | date=13 August 2002 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2190585.stm |work=BBC News | accessdate =28 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The floods started with heavy rainfall in the [[Eastern Alps]], which resulted in floods in Northern [[Italy]], Bavaria and the Austrian [[States of Austria|states]] of [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]] and [[Upper Austria]] .{{citation needed|date=January 2008}} The floods gradually moved eastwards along the [[Danube]], although the damage in the large cities on its shores was not as severe as in the areas affected by the floods later.

When the rainfall moved northeast to the [[Bohemian Forest]] and to the source areas of the [[Elbe]] and [[Vltava]] rivers, the result were catastrophic water levels first in the Austrian areas of [[Mühlviertel]] and [[Waldviertel]] and later in the Czech Republic, [[Thuringia]] and [[Saxony]]. Rivers changed their courses in unexpected ways, catching residents off guard .{{citation needed|date=January 2008}} Several villages in Northern [[Bohemia]], Thuringia and Saxony were more or less destroyed by rivers changing their courses or massively overflowing their banks.

==Areas affected==
[[Image:Povodeň 2002 Praha - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Flooding in [[Prague]]]]
The floods that hit Europe during August 2002 were part of a larger system that was also affecting Asia. Within Europe, however, the areas that sustained significant damage included the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Italy, Spain, Germany, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Rene | last=Volfik |  title=Europe's Flood Part of Global Deluge | date=15 August 2002 |  url =http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0815/p01s02-woeu.html | work =Christian Science Monitor |  accessdate =28 January 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080101044421/http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0815/p01s02-woeu.html| archivedate= 1 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several rivers in the region, including the [[Vltava River|Vltava]], [[Elbe River|Elbe]] and [[Danube River|Danube]] reached record highs.&lt;ref name="Thousands Flee Dresden Floods"&gt;{{cite news | title=Thousands Flee Dresden Floods | date=16 August 2002 | url =https://www.theguardian.com/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,775789,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London | accessdate =28 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Czech Republic===
[[Image:Karlin.jpg|thumb|Flood damage in the Karlin district of [[Prague]]]]
[[Image:Prague metro plan 2002 floods.svg|thumb|Flooded [[Prague metro]] network in 2002]]
[[Prague]] received significant damage from what were deemed to be the worst floods ever to hit the capital. The flow of Vltava culminated at 5300 m³/s, 20% more than during the flood of 1845. Among the regions of the capital city most severely affected were: [[Karlín]], [[Kampa Island|Kampa]] and [[Holešovice]], where there was significant risk of building collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |    title=Czechs Told to Avoid Weak Buildings | date=18 August 2002 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2201555.stm |work=BBC News | accessdate =28 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Prague's art work was saved due to advance warning&lt;!--Delete this comment; I inserted it to correct the "edit summary" of my previous edit.--&gt;  of high water levels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |    title=Art Saved from European Floods | date=15 August 2002 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2195743.stm |work=BBC News | accessdate =28 January 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080214171159/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2195743.stm| archivedate= 14 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; however there was significant damage to the [[Prague Metro]] subway system, much of which was completely flooded,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Askold | last=Krushelnycky |  title=Officials Try to Shift Blame as Prague's Metro Floods | date=24 August 2002 |  url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/08/24/wflood24.xml |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |  accessdate =28 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to the historic [[Prague pneumatic post]], which was forced to cease operation.&lt;ref name="service"&gt;Lazarová, Daniela. [http://www.radio.cz/en/article/46193 Magazine 11-10-2003] [[Radio Prague]] 10 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Josefov (Prague)|Prague's Jewish Quarter]] also received significant damage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishmuseum.cz/en/aflood.htm |title=Flood Damage in the Jewish Museum in Prague in August 2002 |accessdate=28 January 2008 |last=Pavlat |first=Leo |date=27 August 2002 |publisher=The Jewish Museum in Prague |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235817/http://www.jewishmuseum.cz/en/aflood.htm |archive-date=27 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a part of the estimated $30&amp;nbsp;million in damage to Czech cultural sites including: the Prague Municipal Library, [[Malá Strana]], the [[Národní divadlo|National Theatre]] and [[Terezín]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Stanislav | last=Peska |  title=Czechs Salvage Soggy Treasures | date=30 August 2002 |  url =http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0830/p06s01-woeu.html | work =Christian Science Monitor |  accessdate =28 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evacuations before the worst of the flooding have been cited as one of the reasons for relatively little loss of life in the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Flight Before the Flood | date=13 August 2002 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2190354.stm |work=BBC News | accessdate =28 January 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071216133746/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2190354.stm| archivedate=16 December 2007&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 40,000 people were evacuated from Prague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Prague floods, 10 years on|date=15 August 2012|url=http://www.praguepost.com/news/13995-the-prague-floods-10-years-on.html|work=Prague Post|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most visible victims of the summer's flood was Gaston, a sea lion from the Prague Zoo who swam to Germany following the flooding of his aquarium. For some time, it was believed he would survive, however he died following capture in Dresden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |    title=Sorrow as 'hero' flood seal dies | date=21 August 2002 |  url =http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/08/20/floods.seal/ | work =CNN |  accessdate =28 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, 17 people lost their lives in the Czech Republic due to the floods, and damage from the flood was estimated at between 70 and 73 billion [[CZK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.ceskenoviny.cz/archiv/zpravy/czech-republic-in-2002-july-september/20504|title=Czech Republic in 2002: July - September|work=Ceskenoviny.cz|date=9 December 2002|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/172748-nynejsi-povodne-jsou-treti-nejtragictejsi-v-historii-cr.html|title=Nynější povodně jsou třetí nejtragičtější v historii ČR|language=Czech|trans-title=Current floods are third most tragic in the history of the Czech Republic|work=Novinky.cz|date=2 July 2009|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damage to the Prague metro has been estimated at approximately 7&amp;nbsp;billion [[Czech koruna|CZK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Povodně 2002: Voda zaplavila 18 stanic metra, zavřela je až na půl roku |url=https://praha.idnes.cz/povodne-2002-voda-zaplavila-18-stanic-metra-f0u-/praha-zpravy.aspx?c=A120814_1816326_praha-zpravy_sfo |work=iDNES.cz |date=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Germany was the hardest hit, with over two-thirds of the flood’s total losses.&lt;ref&gt;Helmer, M. &amp; Hilhorst, D.J.M. 2006, "Natural disasters and climate change", Disasters, vol. 30, no. 1, pp. 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; the 10 years of renovation work that had been carried out since reunification in 1990 in the town of [[Grimma]], in the former [[East Germany]], were said to have been destroyed in one night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Peter | last=Green |author2= Otto Pohl | title= As Floods Ebb in Prague, Threat Rolls Into Germany | date=15 August 2002 |  url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E2D9163DF936A2575BC0A9649C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | work =The New York Times |  accessdate =28 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dresden]] received significant damage when the [[Elbe River]] reached an all-time high of 9.4&amp;nbsp;meters (30.8 feet). More than 30,000&amp;nbsp;people were evacuated from various neighborhoods throughout the city and some of the city's cultural landmarks were considered to be at risk.&lt;ref name="Thousands Flee Dresden Floods"/&gt;

Dresden's [[Zwinger Palace]], home to a significant number of Europe's artistic treasures including [[Raphael]]'s [[Sistine Madonna]] was at risk from the flooding Elbe, however all of the art works could be saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |    title=Battle to Save Dresden's Treasures | date=15 August 2002 |  url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2195729.stm |work=BBC News |  accessdate =28 January 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071216133831/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2195729.stm| archivedate=16 December 2007&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Semper Opera House also suffered damage.

===Russia===
The [[Black Sea]] Coast region was among the most severely hit regions of [[Russia]] with significant loss of life due to a tornado that hit the tourist region and destroyed homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |    title=Europe Flood Toll Rises to 26 | date=9 August 2002 |  url =http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/08/09/russian.floods.deaths/index.html | work =CNN |  accessdate =28 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071124063129/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/08/09/russian.floods.deaths/index.html |archivedate = 24 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was after earlier summer floods in southern Russia. All told, damage in the region was calculated at more than $400&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |    title=Russia Floods Death Toll Now 93 | date=15 August 2002 |  url =http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WEATHER/06/29/russia.floods/index.html?related | work =CNN |  accessdate =28 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regions spared==
[[Image:Floods in Budapest 2002.jpg|thumb|Flooding in [[Budapest]]]]
Although all of Europe was affected to some degree or another from the record rains that fell, some cities were spared the severe flooding that hit Dresden and Prague.

Although the Danube reached record highs, both [[Bratislava]] and [[Vienna]] were spared significant flooding. Bratislava's sparing was due to the city's flood protection measures, which withstood the water,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Nick | last=Thorpe |  title=Defences Hold Fast in Bratislava | date=16 August 2002 |  url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2198850.stm |work=BBC News |  accessdate =28 January 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071216140554/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2198850.stm| archivedate=16 December 2007&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it was generally believed that [[Vienna]] was spared significant damage due [[Donauinsel#Reliable flood protection|the city's engineering]], and plans were undertaken to see if such work could be applied to the other cities as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |    title=Europe's Flood Lessons | date=19 August 2002 |  url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/world/europe/2203152.stm |work=BBC News |  accessdate =28 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The floods also hit Budapest, with 1,700 people evacuated.

==After effects==
Once the water levels returned to normal and residents returned to their home, they faced not only the damage left by the rising waters but also threats of disease due to decaying waste and food. The damage increased due to flooding of sewage treatment plants and the risk of damage to chemical plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |    title=New Threat for Flood-hit Europe | date=20 August 2002 |  url =http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/08/20/europe.floods/index.html | work =CNN |  accessdate =28 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071124064519/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/08/20/europe.floods/index.html |archivedate = 24 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even once the waters began to recede, the work in the region was not yet complete. European leaders gathered in Berlin to discuss the effects of the floods and to create a better understanding of how to prevent such disaster in the future. This meeting garnered some criticism as Russia, which had suffered significant damage, was not invited to what was billed as a meeting of EU members and future members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Kate | last=Connolly |  title=European Leaders Hold Flood Crisis Talks | date=19 August 2002 |  url =https://www.theguardian.com/naturaldisasters/story/0,,776751,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |  accessdate =28 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU leaders did promise aid to the central European countries that suffered the most under the floods with monies coming from the EU's structural budget and this outreach to non-members was seen as symbolic in an effort to portray a truly united Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=EU Pledges Flood Recovery Aid | date=18 August 2002 |  url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2200690.stm |work=BBC News | accessdate =28 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ADA''' is a [[zwitterionic]] organic chemical [[buffering agent]]; one of [[Good's buffer]]s. It has a useful [[pH]] range of 6.0-7.2 in the physiological range, making it useful for [[cell culture]] work. It has a [[pKa]] of 6.6 with ΔpKa/°C of -0.011 and is most often prepared in 1 M [[NaOH]] where it has a solubility of 160&amp;nbsp;mg/mL.

ADA has been used in protein-free media for chicken embryo fibroblasts, as a [[chelating agent]] for H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and for [[isoelectric focusing]] in immobilized pH gradients. Its effects on dog kidney [[Na+/K+-ATPase|Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase]] and rat brain [[GABA receptor]]s have also been studied. ADA does, however, alter coloring in [[bicinchoninic acid assay]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=ADA| website=Sigma-Aldrich| url=http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Sigma/Product_Information_Sheet/a9883pis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baywind Energy Co-operative''' was the first [[co-operative]] to own [[wind turbine]]s in the United Kingdom.

Baywind was modelled on the similar [[wind turbine cooperative]]s and other [[renewable energy]] co-operatives that are common in [[Scandinavia]], and was founded as an [[Industrial and Provident Society]] in 1996. It now has 1,200 members, each with one vote. A proportion of the profits is invested in local community environmental initiatives through the Baywind Energy Community Trust. The organisation won the 2004 National Social Enterprise Award for its innovative approach to community owned renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialenterprise.org.uk/CMS/Page.aspx?SP=1906 Social Enterprise Coalition]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baywind owned a 2.5 megawatt five-turbine [[wind farm]] at Harlock Hill near [[Ulverston]], [[Cumbria]] (operational since 29 January 1997), and one of the 600 kilowatt turbines at the [[Haverigg II]] wind farm near [[Millom]], Cumbria. The Harlock Hill site has now been re-powered with two 2.3 Mwh Enercon turbines, operational from May 2016. The site is now owned by High Winds, a BenCom created under the new legal rules.

Since Baywind's establishment, further wind energy co-operatives have been established, many with the help of the organisation formed by Baywind for this purpose, [[Energy4All]].

The '''body adiposity index''' ('''BAI''') is a method of estimating the amount of [[adipose tissue|body fat]] in humans. The BAI is calculated without using body weight, unlike the [[body mass index]] (BMI).  Instead, it uses the size of the [[hips]] compared to the person's height.

Based on population studies, the BAI is approximately equal to the percentage of body fat for adult men and women of differing ethnicities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/oby.2012.99 |title=A Better Index of Body Adiposity|publisher=Obesity - A Research Journal|volume=20|journal=Obesity|page=1135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formula ==
The BAI is calculated as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myhealthnewsdaily.com/body-fat-index-obesity-calculator-110303-1230/ New Method of Calculating Body Fat Unlikely to Replace BMI]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{100 \times \text{hip circumference in m}}{\text{height in m} \times \sqrt{\text{height}}} - 18
&lt;/math&gt;

Hip circumference (R = 0.602) and height (R = −0.524) are strongly [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlated]] with percentage of body fat. Comparing BAI with "[[gold standard (test)|gold standard]]" [[dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry]] (DXA) results, the correlation between DXA-derived percentage of adiposity and the BAI in a target population was R = 0.85, with a [[Concordance correlation coefficient|concordance]] of C_b = 0.95.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emaxhealth.com/1024/new-bai-better-old-bmi Is the new BAI better than the old BMI?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
The BAI could be a good tool to measure adiposity due, at least in part, to the advantages over other more complex mechanical or electrical systems. Probably, the most important advantage of BAI over BMI is that weight is not needed. However, in general it seems that the BAI does not overcome the limitations of BMI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0035281 López AA, Cespedes ML, Vicente T, Tomas M, Bennasar-Veny M, et al. (2012) Body Adiposity Index Utilization in a Spanish Mediterranean Population: Comparison with the Body Mass Index" ''PLoS ONE'' 7(4): e35281]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stated advantages of the BAI are that it approximates body fat percentage, while the widely used BMI is known to be of limited accuracy, and is different for males and females with similar percentage body adiposity; and that it does not involve weighing, so can be used in remote locations with limited access to scales. A detailed study published in 2012 concluded that estimates of body fat percentage based on BAI were not more accurate than those based on BMI, waist circumference, or hip circumference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22484365 | doi=10.1038/oby.2012.81 | volume=20 | title=The body adiposity index (hip circumference ÷ height(1.5)) is not a more accurate measure of adiposity than is BMI, waist circumference, or hip circumference | pmc=3477292 |vauthors=Freedman DS, Thornton JC, Pi-Sunyer FX, Heymsfield SB, Wang J, Pierson RN Jr, Blanck HM, Gallagher D | journal=Obesity (Silver Spring) | pages=2438–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adiposity indexes that include the waist circumference (for example [[Waist-to-height ratio|waist-to-height ratio WHtR]]) may be better than BAI and BMI in evaluating metabolic and cardiovascular risk in both clinical practice and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bennasar-Veny M, Lopez-Gonzalez AA, Tauler P, Cespedes ML, Vicente-Herrero T, etal | year = 2013 | title = Body Adiposity Index and Cardiovascular Health Risk Factors in Caucasians: A Comparison with the Body Mass Index and Others | url = http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0063999 | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 5| page = e63999 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0063999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Calcite''' is a [[Carbonate minerals|carbonate mineral]] and the most stable [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]] of [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]], based on [[Scratch hardness|scratch]] [[hardness comparison]], defines value 3 as "calcite".

Other polymorphs of calcium carbonate are the minerals [[aragonite]] and [[vaterite]]. Aragonite will change to calcite over timescales of days or less at temperatures exceeding 300°C,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Yoshioka S.|author2=Kitano Y.|title=Transformation of aragonite to calcite through heating|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/geochemj1966/19/4/19_4_245/_pdf|journal=Geochemical Journal |volume=19|pages=24–249|year= 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Staudigel P.T.|author2=Swart P.K.|title=Isotopic behavior during the aragonite-calcite transition: Implications for sample preparation and proxy interpretation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000925411630482X|journal=Chemical Geology |volume=442|pages=130–138|year= 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and vaterite is even less stable.

==Etymology==
Calcite is derived from the German ''Calcit'', a term coined in the 19th century from the Latin word for [[Lime (material)|lime]], ''calx'' (genitive calcis) with the suffix -ite used to name minerals. It is thus etymologically related to [[chalk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=calcite (n.) |encyclopedia=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/calcite|accessdate=6 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When applied by [[archaeology|archaeologists]] and stone trade professionals, the term [[alabaster]] is used not just as in geology and mineralogy, where it is reserved for a variety of [[gypsum]]; but also for a similar-looking, [[Transparency and translucency|translucent]] variety of fine-grained banded deposit of calcite.&lt;ref&gt;''More about alabaster and travertine'', brief guide explaining the different use of the same terms by geologists, archaeologists and the stone trade. Oxford University Museum of Natural History, 2012 [http://www.oum.ox.ac.uk/corsi/files/pdf/Alabaster-travertine.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unit cell and Miller indices==
In publications, two different sets of [[Miller indices]] are used to describe directions in calcite crystals - the hexagonal system with three indices {{math|''h, k, l''}} and the rhombohedral system with four indices {{math|''h, k, l, i''}}. To add to the complications, there are also two definitions of unit cell for calcite. One, an older "morphological" unit cell, was inferred by measuring angles between faces of crystals and looking for the smallest numbers that fit. Later, a "structural" unit cell was determined using [[X-ray crystallography]]. The morphological unit cell has approximate dimensions {{math|''a'' {{=}} 10 [[Ångstrom|Å]]}} and {{math|''c'' {{=}} 8.5 [[Ångstrom|Å]]}}, while for the structural unit cell they are {{math|''a'' {{=}} 5 [[Ångstrom|Å]]}} and {{math|''c'' {{=}} 17 [[Ångstrom|Å]]}}. For the same orientation, {{math|''c''}} must be multiplied by 4 to convert from morphological to structural units. As an example, the cleavage is given as "perfect on {1 0 {{overline|1}} 1}" in morphological coordinates and "perfect on {1 0 {{overline|1}} 4}" in structural units. (In hexagonal indices, these are {1 0 1} and {1 0 4}.) Twinning, cleavage and crystal forms are always given in morphological units.&lt;ref name=mindat&gt;{{cite web|title=Calcite|url=http://www.mindat.org/min-859.html|website=mindat.org|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hazen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hazen|first1=Robert M.|author-link=Robert Hazen|chapter=Chiral crystal faces of common rock-forming minerals|editor-last1=Palyi|editor-first1=C.|editor-last2=Zucchi|editor-first2=C.|editor-last3=Caglioti|editor-first3=L.|title=Progress in Biological Chirality|date=2004|publisher=Elsevier|location=Oxford|pages=137&amp;ndash;151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties ==
===Form===
Over 800 forms of calcite [[crystal]]s have been identified. Most common are [[scalenohedron|scalenohedra]], with faces in the hexagonal {2 1 1} directions (morphological unit cell) or {2 1 4} directions (structural unit cell); and rhombohedral, with faces in the {1 0 1} or {1 0 4} directions (the most common cleavage plane).&lt;ref name=Hazen/&gt; Habits include acute to obtuse rhombohedra, tabular forms, [[Prism (geometry)|prisms]], or various [[scalenohedron|scalenohedra]]. Calcite exhibits several [[crystal twinning|twinning]] types adding to the variety of observed forms. It may occur as fibrous, granular, lamellar, or compact. A fibrous, efflorescent form is known as [[lublinite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lublinite|url=http://www.mindat.org/min-9512.html|website=mindat.org|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleavage is usually in three directions parallel to the rhombohedron form. Its fracture is [[Conchoidal fracture|conchoidal]], but difficult to obtain.

Scalenohedral faces are [[chiral]] and come in pairs with mirror-image symmetry; their growth can be influenced by interaction with chiral biomolecules such as L- and D-[[amino acid]]s. Rhombohedral faces are achiral.&lt;ref name=Hazen/&gt;

===Hardness===
It has a defining [[Mohs hardness]] of 3, a [[specific gravity]] of 2.71, and its luster is vitreous in crystallized varieties. Color is white or none, though shades of gray, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, brown, or even black can occur when the mineral is charged with impurities.

===Optical===
Calcite is transparent to opaque and may occasionally show [[phosphorescence]] or [[fluorescence]]. A transparent variety called ''[[Iceland spar]]'' is used for optical purposes. Acute scalenohedral crystals are sometimes referred to as "dogtooth spar" while the rhombohedral form is sometimes referred to as "nailhead spar".
[[File:Calcite-refraction-property.jpg|alt=A photograph of calcite laying over a text paragraph.|thumb|Photograph of calcite displaying the characteristic birefringence optical behaviour.]]
Single calcite crystals display an optical property called [[birefringence]] (double refraction). This strong birefringence causes objects viewed through a clear piece of calcite to appear doubled. The birefringent effect (using calcite) was first described by the [[Denmark|Danish]] scientist [[Rasmus Bartholin]] in 1669. At a wavelength of ~590&amp;nbsp;nm calcite has ordinary and extraordinary [[refractive index|refractive indices]] of 1.658 and 1.486, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.info/refraction/|title=Refraction|last=Elert|first=Glenn|work=The Physics Hypertextbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 190 and 1700&amp;nbsp;nm, the ordinary refractive index varies roughly between 1.9 and 1.5, while the extraordinary refractive index varies between 1.6 and 1.4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0040-6090(97)00843-2| title = Determination of optical anisotropy in calcite from ultraviolet to mid-infrared by generalized ellipsometry| journal = Thin Solid Films| volume = 313–314| pages = 341–346| year = 1998| last1 = Thompson | first1 = D.

===Chemical===
Calcite, like most carbonates, will dissolve with most forms of acid. Calcite can be either [[solvation|dissolved]] by groundwater or [[precipitate]]d by groundwater, depending on several factors including the water temperature, [[acidity|pH]], and dissolved [[ion]] concentrations. Although calcite is fairly insoluble in cold water, acidity can cause dissolution of calcite and release of carbon dioxide gas. Ambient carbon dioxide, due to its acidity, has a slight solubilizing effect on calcite. Calcite exhibits an unusual characteristic called retrograde solubility in which it becomes less soluble in water as the temperature increases.  When conditions are right for precipitation, calcite forms mineral coatings that cement the existing rock grains together or it can fill fractures.  When conditions are right for dissolution, the removal of calcite can dramatically increase the [[porosity]] and [[Permeability (fluid)|permeability]] of the rock, and if it continues for a long period of time may result in the formation of [[cave]]s. On a landscape scale, continued dissolution of calcium carbonate-rich rocks can lead to the expansion and eventual collapse of cave systems, resulting in various forms of [[Karst|karst topography]].

==Use and applications==
[[File:Alabaster Perfume Jar.jpg|thumb|One of several calcite or alabaster perfume jars from the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]], d. 1323 BC ]]
Ancient Egyptians carved many items out of calcite, relating it to their goddess [[Bastet|Bast]], whose name contributed to the term [[alabaster]] because of the close association. Many other cultures have used the material for similar carved objects and applications.
 
High-grade optical calcite was used in World War II for gun sights, specifically in bomb sights and anti-aircraft weaponry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/dec/05/borregos-calcite-mine-trail-holds-desert-wonders/|title =Borrego's calcite mine trail holds desert wonders| accessdate = 2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, experiments have been conducted to use calcite for a [[cloak of invisibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Xianzhong|last2=Luo|first2=Yu|last3=Zhang|first3=Jingjing|last4=Jiang|first4=Kyle|last5=Pendry|first5=John B.|last6=Zhang|first6=Shuang|doi=10.1038/ncomms1176|title=Macroscopic invisibility cloaking of visible light|pmid=21285954|year=2011|page=176|volume=2|journal=Nature Communications|issue=2|pmc=3105339|bibcode = 2011NatCo...2E.176C |arxiv =1012.2783 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural occurrence==
Calcite is a common constituent of [[sedimentary rock]]s, [[limestone]] in particular, much of which is formed from the shells of dead marine organisms.  Approximately 10% of sedimentary rock is limestone. It is the primary mineral in [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] [[marble]]. It also occurs in deposits from [[hot spring]]s as a [[Vein (geology)|vein]] mineral; in [[cavern]]s as [[stalactite]]s and [[stalactite|stalagmite]]s; and in [[volcano|volcanic]] or [[mantle (geology)|mantle-derived]] rocks such as [[carbonatite]]s, [[kimberlite]]s, or rarely in [[peridotite]]s.

Calcite is often the primary constituent of the [[Seashell|shell]]s of [[Marine biology|marine organism]]s, e.g., [[plankton]] (such as [[coccolith]]s and planktic [[foraminifera]]), the hard parts of red [[algae]], some [[sea sponge|sponge]]s, [[brachiopod]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, some [[Serpulidae|serpulids]], most [[bryozoa]], and parts of the shells of some [[Bivalvia|bivalves]] (such as [[oyster]]s and [[rudists]]). Calcite is found in spectacular form in the [[Snowy River Cave]] of [[New Mexico]] as mentioned above, where microorganisms are credited with natural formations. [[Trilobite]]s, which became [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|extinct a quarter billion years ago]], had unique compound eyes that used clear calcite crystals to form the lenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Angier, Natalie |author-link=Natalie Angier |date=3 March 2014 |title=When Trilobites Ruled the World |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/science/when-trilobites-ruled-the-world.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=10 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest documented single crystal of calcite originated from Iceland, measured 7×7×2 m and 6×6×3 m and weighed about 250 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM66/AM66_885.pdf| journal = American Mineralogist| volume = 66| pages = 885–907| year= 1981| title= The largest crystals| author = Rickwood, P. C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation processes ==
Calcite formation can proceed via several pathways, from the classical [[terrace ledge kink model]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=De Yoreo |first1=J J |last2=Vekilov |first2=P G |title=Principles of crystal nucleation and growth |journal=Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry |volume=54 |pages=57 |date=2003 |doi=10.2113/0540057 |url=http://rimg.geoscienceworld.org/content/54/1/57.short}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the crystallization of poorly ordered precursor phases (amorphous calcium carbonate, ACC) via an [[Ostwald ripening]] process, or via the agglomeration of nanocrystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=De Yoreo |first1=J |last2=Gilbert |first2=PUPA |last3=Sommerdijk |first3=N A J M |last4=Penn |first4=R L |last5=Whitelam |first5=S |last6=Joester |first6=D |last7=Zhang |first7=H |last8=Rimer |first8=J D |last9=Navrotsky |first9=A |last10=Banfield |first10=J F |last11=Wallace |first11=A F |last12=Michel |first12=F M |last13=Meldrum |first13=F C |last14=Cölfen |first14=H |last15=Dove |first15=P M |title=Crystallization by particle attachment in synthetic, biogenic, and geologic environments |journal=Science |date=2015 |volume=349 |issue=6247 |page=aaa6760 |doi=10.1126/science.aaa6760 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aaa6760 |pmid=26228157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crystallization of ACC can occur in two stages: first, the ACC nanoparticles rapidly dehydrate and crystallize to form individual particles of vaterite. Secondly, the vaterite transforms to calcite via a dissolution and reprecipitation mechanism with the reaction rate controlled by the surface area of calcite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/C0NR00589D |pmid=21069231 |title=The kinetics and mechanisms of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) crystallization to calcite, via vaterite |journal=Nanoscale |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=265–71 |year=2011 |last1=Rodriguez-Blanco |first1=J. D. |last2=Shaw |first2=S. |last3=Benning |first3=L. G. |bibcode=2011Nanos...3..265R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second stage of the reaction is approximately 10 times slower. However, the crystallization of calcite has been observed to be dependent on the starting pH and presence of Mg in solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jallcom.2011.11.057 |title=The role of pH and Mg on the stability and crystallization of amorphous calcium carbonate |journal=Journal of Alloys and Compounds |volume=536 |pages=S477 |year=2012 |last1=Rodriguez-Blanco |first1=J. D. |last2=Shaw |first2=S. |last3=Bots |first3=P. |last4=Roncal-Herrero |first4=T. |last5=Benning |first5=L. G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A neutral starting pH during mixing promotes the direct transformation of ACC into calcite. Conversely, when ACC forms in a solution that starts with a basic initial pH, the transformation to calcite occurs via metastable vaterite, which forms via a spherulitic growth mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/cg300676b |title=Mechanistic Insights into the Crystallization of Amorphous Calcium Carbonate (ACC) |journal=Crystal Growth &amp; Design |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=3806–3814 |year=2012 |last1=Bots |first1=P. |last2=Benning |first2=L. G. |last3=Rodriguez-Blanco |first3=J. D. |last4=Roncal-Herrero |first4=T. |last5=Shaw |first5=S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a second stage this vaterite transforms to calcite via a surface-controlled dissolution and recrystallization mechanism. Mg has a noteworthy effect on both the stability of ACC and its transformation to crystalline CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting in the formation of calcite directly from ACC, as this ion destabilizes the structure of vaterite.

Calcite may form in the subsurface in response to activity of microorganisms, such as during sulfate-dependent [[anaerobic oxidation of methane]], where methane is oxidized and sulfate is reduced by a consortium of methane oxidizers and sulfate reducers, leading to precipitation of calcite and [[pyrite]] from the produced bicarbonate and sulfide. These processes can be traced by the specific [[carbon isotope]] composition of the calcites, which are extremely depleted in the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C isotope, by as much as −125 per mil [[Δ13C#Reference standard|PDB]] (δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150507/ncomms8020/pdf/ncomms8020.pdf |journal=Nature Communications |volume=6 |pages=7020 |year=2015 |title=Extreme &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C depletion of carbonates formed during oxidation of biogenic methane in fractured granite |author=Drake, H. |author2=Astrom, M.E. |author3=Heim, C. |author4=Broman, C. |author5=Astrom, J. |author6=Whitehouse, M. |author7=Ivarsson, M. |author8=Siljestrom, S. |author9=Sjovall, P. |pmid=25948095 |pmc=4432592 |doi=10.1038/ncomms8020|bibcode = 2015NatCo...6E7020D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Earth history==
[[Calcite sea]]s existed in Earth history when the primary inorganic precipitate of calcium carbonate in marine waters was low-magnesium calcite (lmc), as opposed to the [[aragonite]] and high-magnesium calcite (hmc) precipitated today.  Calcite seas alternated with [[aragonite sea]]s over the Phanerozoic, being most prominent in the [[Ordovician]] and [[Jurassic]].  Lineages evolved to use whichever morph of calcium carbonate was favourable in the ocean at the time they became mineralised, and retained this mineralogy for the remainder of their evolutionary history.&lt;ref name='Porter2007'&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1137284|title=Seawater Chemistry and Early Carbonate Biomineralization|year=2007|last1=Porter|first1=S.

Calcite is one of the minerals that has been shown to [[catalysis|catalyze]] an important biological reaction, the [[formose reaction]], and may have had a role in the origin of life.&lt;ref name=Hazen/&gt; Interaction of its chiral surfaces (see [[#Form|Form]]) with [[aspartic acid]] molecules results in a slight bias in chirality; this is one possible mechanism for the origin of [[homochirality]] in living cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meierhenrich|first1=Uwe|title=Amino acids and the asymmetry of life caught in the act of formation|date=2008|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=9783540768869|pages=76&amp;ndash;78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carburetor Icing''', or '''carb icing''', is an [[atmospheric icing|icing]] condition which can affect any [[carburetor]] under certain [[weather|atmospheric conditions]]. The problem is most notable in certain realms of aviation.

Carburetor icing is caused by the temperature drop in the carburetor, as an effect of fuel vaporization, and the temperature drop associated with the pressure drop in the [[venturi effect|venturi]].  If the temperature drops below freezing, [[water vapor]] will freeze onto the throttle valve, and other internal surfaces of the carburetor.  The venturi effect can drop the ambient air temperature by 70 absolute degrees [[Fahrenheit]] (F), or 38.89 absolute degrees [[Celsius]] (C).  In other words, air at an outside temperature of 100 degree F, can drop to 30 degrees F in the carburetor.  Carburetor icing most often occurs when the outside air temperature is below 70 degrees F (21 degrees C) and the [[relative humidity]] is above 80 percent.&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;  

Unfortunately, the warm air temperature often causes pilots of aircraft to overlook the possibility of carb icing. The [[ice]] will form on the surfaces of the carburetor throat, further restricting it. This may increase the [[Venturi effect]] initially, but eventually restricts airflow, perhaps even causing a complete blockage of air to the carburetor. The engine begins to run more rich as ice formation increases. Without intervention (carb heat or leaning) this can only continue until the mixture is outside of the "chemically correct" range for combustion.  Icing may also cause jamming of the mechanical parts of the carburetor, such as the [[throttle]], typically a [[butterfly valve]].

While it applies to all carburetors, carburetor icing is of particular concern in association with [[reciprocating engine|piston-powered]] [[aircraft]], especially small, single-engine, light aircraft. Aircraft powered by carbureted [[engine]]s are equipped with [[carburetor heat]] systems to overcome the icing problem. In cars, carburetor icing can occasionally be a nuisance. The [[inlet manifold]] and parts of the carburetor often have warm water from the [[radiator|cooling system]] or [[exhaust gas]] circulating through them to combat this problem. [[Motorcycle]]s can also suffer from carburetor icing, although some engine designs are more susceptible to it than others. [[Air-cooled engine]]s may be more prone to icing, due to the absence of warm [[coolant]] circulating through the engine.

Cold liquor tanks, cold water tanks as they called in the [[brewery]]. '''Cold liquor tank''' is a buffer vessel and it carries cold water that will be used to cool the bitter wort down to a fermentable [[temperature]] field after boiling.

== Two stage heat exchanger ==
[[File:Cold liquor tank.jpg|thumb|left|cold liquor tank]]

The first stage is ground water and it running back to HLT to next sparge. [[Glycol]] serves as a secondary cooling system and its back to glycol container. Valves on both channels, and a temp exploration right after the heat exchanger. Heats up your water for your next brew without using any extra power, reuses your water you would use from a CLT, and saves you the space of a whole tank.

== Primary purpose of the CLT’s ==

Cold liquor tanks are used for [[brewing]] process and CLT’s also called buffer tanks. Buffer tanks contain cold water used for the purpose of cooling the bitter wort temperature down to the fermentable level range after boiling. This process is done by [[wort cooler]].

== Temperature ==

The cold storage tank that been a single skin vessel and should be in a room which requires cold [[temperature]]. Cold [[liquid]] tanks connected with glycol chiller tanks and its impressed inside water.
Frequency level of the cooling capacity of the beer helps to recommend the appropriate volume and cooling methods. It can contain 1000+ litre and when water can be passed through the heat exchanger and when it run hot liquid tank temperature near about 70 to 80-degree Celsius.It's a typical process and its help continuous brewing without any break and no need waiting for gain actual temperature.

== Features of cold liquor tanks ==

A '''conical plate centrifuge''' (also known as a '''disc bowl centrifuge''' or '''disc stack separator''') is a type of [[centrifuge]] that has a series of conical discs which provides a parallel configuration of centrifugation spaces.&lt;ref name=one&gt;{{cite book|last=Dickenson|first=C.|title=Filters and Filtration Handbook|year=1994|publisher=Elsevier Advanced Technology|location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conical plate centrifuge is used to remove solids (usually impurities) from liquids or to separate two liquid phases from each other by means of an enormously high centrifugal force. The denser solids or liquids which are subjected to these forces move outwards towards the rotating bowl wall while the less dense fluids moves towards the centre. The special plates (known as disc stacks) increase the surface settling area which speeds up the separation process. Different stack designs, arrangements and shapes are used for different processes depending on the type of feed present. The concentrated denser solid or liquid is then removed continuously, manually or intermittently, depending on the design of the conical plate centrifuge.&lt;ref name=two&gt;{{cite news|title=Alfa Laval-Disc Stack Separator Technology}}(online available : http://www.alfalaval.com/industries/food-dairy-beverages/food/Documents/PCHS00022%20Disc%20Stack%20Centrifuges.pdf)[retrieved 10 October 2013] {{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This centrifuge is very suitable for clarifying liquids that have small proportion of suspended solids.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Disc stack centrifuge.gif|400x300px|framed|right|Figure 2 Intermittent discharge of solid in a conical plate centrifuge&lt;ref name=nineteen&gt;{{cite web|last=Alfa Laval|title=Alfa Laval PX Disc Stack Centrifuge|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmTMz4VkAwI|publisher=Alfa Laval|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
]] --&gt;
==Basic fundamentals==
The centrifuge works by using the [[inclined plate settler]] principle. A set of parallel plates with a tilt angle θ with respect to horizontal plane is installed to reduce the distance of the particle settling. The reason for the tilted angle is to allow the settled solids on the plates to slide down by gravitational force so they do not accumulate and clog the channel formed between adjacent plates.&lt;ref name=seven /&gt;

==Available designs==

===Nozzle-type centrifuge===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Continuous nozzle centrifuge.jpg|450x200px|framed|right|Figure 3 Continuous solid discharge&lt;ref name=two /&gt;]] --&gt;
This type of centrifuge removes solid matter from liquid feed from the plates. A centrifugal pump creates a pressure to discharge the clear liquid from the [[centrifuge]]. The solid is extracted through [[nozzles]] continuously,&lt;ref name=one /&gt; as shown in Figure 2{{clarify|date=February 2014}}.
The quantity of concentrate depends on speed of bowl rotation, number of [[nozzles]] per centrifuge, radius of the nozzle’s position and the nozzle diameter. The quality depends on volume of concentrate discharged, and concentration and volume of the liquid fed into the centrifuge. The concentration of the discharge through the nozzle is varied by adjusting the diameter of the nozzle and initial volume of liquid feed.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

Pre-treatment includes [[strainers]] in the feed lines to prevent coarse solid impurities clogging the nozzles. Generally, the diameter of the holes of the pre-treatment filter is about 10% smaller than [[nozzle]] diameter.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

===Self-cleaning centrifuge===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Intermittent solid discharge.jpg|450x200px|framed|right|Figure 4 Intermittent solid discharge&lt;ref name=two /&gt;]] --&gt;
Lighter and heavier liquid exit separately through the top of the centrifuge, while the [[sludge]] is discharged intermittently through the nozzles. Another type of self-cleaning centrifuge has a removable chamber bottom. Both methods can be controlled independently or automatically, either time-controlled or depending on quality of discharge through nozzle&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

Depending on the design, the feed enters through the top or bottom inlet. Once clarified on the conical plates, product is discharged under [[pressure]] through the outlet. Separated solids, or sludge, are accumulated in the conical space adjacent to the nozzle. Once full (without exceeding the area of the plates), a [[piston]] is set to hydraulically open each nozzle ports, ejecting the sludge. Generally, water is used as the service fluid, acting as a piston to control the nozzle. During sludging, the water is injected to open the nozzle and drained to close it.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

===Hermetic centrifuge===
This type of separator is a closed (hermetic) centrifuge; it can be a chamber or conical plate bowl.&lt;ref name=one /&gt; This centrifuge can accommodate a system with a maximum pressure of 8 bars. The feed and discharge inlet are attached to the rotating bowl. The head of the centrifuge contains a built-in rotary feed and discharge pumps. It is extremely useful for:

*Liquid feed that cannot have a decreasing pressure
* Liquid feed that cannot withstand impact at inlet, where the solid particles require a ‘delicate touch’ (e.g. protein).
*Liquid feed which easily oxidises
*Liquid feed that emits gas or evaporates (e.g. beers and cold wort)

==Range of application==

===Oil and gas industry===
Conical plate centrifuge can be used to remove [[water]], [[salts]] and solids to condition [[fuels]] for [[gas turbine]]. It also removes some heavy phase liquid and fine solids to obtain high purity liquid fuel. On the other hand, the centrifuge is also useful for treating water, an oil and gas by product, by removing oil contaminants before discharging back to the sea, as required by law. Moreover, [[emulsion]] of oil and water can be further treated to produce more oil by separating oil, water and impurities using the conical plate centrifuge.&lt;ref name=two /&gt;

Disc stack centrifuge is also useful in producing [[biodiesel]], as an initiative to [[alternative energy sources]]. The centrifuge separates fuel from [[methanol]] or water to convert oils from raw materials (such as rape seed) into [[diesel fuel]]. Oil additives is used to improve fuel performances, and in order to remove as much contaminants as possible, this type of centrifuge is used to separate excess fine solids such as metal salts and lime.&lt;ref name=two /&gt;

===Process industry===
In paper coating, the conical plate centrifuge cleans and sorts the ‘[[kaolin]]’ (a material which gives paper its glossy look in certain grades of paper) according to its particle size. The separator for this process needs a design that can withstand abrasion caused by kaolin. Additionally, this centrifuge is also used to remove water, impurities and other metal particles from oils and [[lubricants]] used for dynamic processes, such as [[motor (device)|motors]], [[compressors]] and hydraulics. This treatment is reliable in extending the service life of the equipment.&lt;ref name=two /&gt;

===Biological science===
As an equipment that is easily sterilised and fully contained, the conical plate centrifuge is an excellent choice for producing [[vaccines]] and [[antibodies]] in sterile and hygienic conditions.&lt;ref name=four&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alfa Laval|title=Alfa Laval Adds Hermetic Cell Culture Centrifuge|year=2010|series=Manufacturing chemist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hermetic cell culture centrifuge is used to harvest cell cultures from [[mammals]]. The feed enters the bottom of the liquid—filled centrifuge (ensuring air-free for cell separation) and a hollow spindle prevents instant acceleration of the feed, minimising damage to the sensitive cell membrane. The outlet is air-free to reduce foaming. This centrifuge can also be cleaned and sanitised in place (SIP and CIP systems) without major dismantling to ensure the operations remains hygienic.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt;

===Food processing===
In beer brewing, kieselguhr (an off-white powder known as diatomaceous earth) is used to filter water from the alcoholic beverages. The addition of a conical plate centrifuge will reduce the usage of kieselguhr, be more economical and time-efficient, as well as minimise product loss.&lt;ref name=two /&gt;

In olive oil production, high speed separators are extensively used, therefore conical plate centrifuge is highly recommended because it ensures efficient separation with minimal oil heating and oxidation. For cold-pressed lemon oil (etheric oil), it needs a separator specifically designed to handle the delicate nature and value of the oil. A hermetic centrifuge is best for this purpose because it can prevent product contamination and losses.&lt;ref name=two /&gt;

==Advantages and limitations over competitive processes==

===Tubular bowl centrifuge===
Both conical plate centrifuge and tubular bowl centrifuge can be used for liquid/liquid and solid/liquid separation. However, the advantage of conical plate centrifuge over tubular bowl centrifuge is that solid discharge is possible in conical plate but recovery of solids in tubular bowl is difficult and there is limited solid capacity. As the liquid discharge in conical plate centrifuge is under high pressure, this eliminates foaming but foaming is present in tubular bowl centrifuges unless special skimming or centripetal pumps are used. Tubular bowl centrifuges are easier to clean and good sludge dewatering as compared to conical plate centrifuge.&lt;ref name=five&gt;{{cite web|last=Catalano|first=S.|title=Centrifuges|url=http://encyclopedia.che.engin.umich.edu/Pages/SeparationsMechanical/Centrifuges/Centrifuges.html|publisher=Encyclopedia of Chemical Engineering Equipment|display-authors=etal}}(Online available at: http://encyclopedia.che.engin.umich.edu/Pages/SeparationsMechanical/Centrifuges/Centrifuges.html)[retrieved 13 October 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=six&gt;{{cite news|last=R.G|first=Harrison|title=Bioseparations Science and Engineering|newspaper=Oxford University Press|year=2003|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chamber bowl or solid bowl centrifuge===
Both the conical plate centrifuge and chamber bowl centrifuge can be used for liquid/liquid and solid/liquid separation. However, the advantage of conical plate centrifuge over chamber bowl centrifuge is that solid discharge is possible in conical plate. The chamber bowl has a high capacity for solids but there is no solid discharge.
Bowl cooling is possible for both conical plate centrifuge and chamber bowl centrifuge. However, cleaning is easier as well as better sludge [[dewatering]] in chamber bowl centrifuge as compared to conical plate centrifuge.&lt;ref name=five /&gt;&lt;ref name=six /&gt;

==Main process characteristics==
The following process characteristics are required in a disk stack centrifuge:

===Disk angle===
A typical angle of 35 to 50° (with respect to vertical axis) of the disk is used in the centrifuge with 50 to 200 numbers of disks. This in turns provide a centrifugal [[acceleration]] G in the range between 5000 and 15000 g.&lt;ref name=seven&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leung|first=W.|title=Disc Centrifuge in Centrifugal Separations in Biotechnology|year=2007|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781856174770500045|doi=10.1016/B978-185617477-0/50004-5|journal=Centrifugal Separations in Biotechnology|pages=59–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect of g-force===
The efficiency of solid separation can be increased by applying a relatively moderate G-force of 3000 Gs in a centrifuge processing calcium carbonate (with sizes below 8 and 12 micron).&lt;ref name=eight&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Y.|title=China Particuology|journal=Continuous Ultra-Fine Classification in a Disc Stack Nozzle Centrifuge - Effects of G-forces and Disc Geometry|year=2003|volume=1|issue=2|pages=70–75|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1672251507601110|doi=10.1016/S1672-2515(07)60111-0|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This efficiency is reduced at a higher G-force of around 6000 Gs because the high fluid velocities near the wall can flush out the settled coarser particles into the light phase reducing the retention time for particle separation. However this depends on the size of the processed solids.&lt;ref name=eight /&gt;

===Disk spacing===
&lt;ref name=seven /&gt; Typically the spacing between adjacent disk ranges from 0.32 to 1&amp;nbsp;mm. This depends on the application and feed to be processed as well as feed concentration as shown in the examples below.
*Yeast processing: Yeast with 30% by volume of solids requires an open spacing of 1&amp;nbsp;mm.
*E. coli and lysate: At lower feed solids, a tighter spacing of 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm is the most suitable.
*Mammalian cell broth: A disk spacing of 0.32&amp;nbsp;mm can be used at low feed solids with concentration of 3 – 4%.

As a rule of thumb, the ratio of the bowl outer diameter to the bowl height must be approximately equal to 1.

===Feed solids===
There are two types of feed solids for this centrifuge:
*Suspended solids
Common for biopharmaceutical application, the feed has 2 to 4% v/v (by bulk volume) for mammalian cells. This may increase to 4 to 6% v/v or even higher in the future due to the increase in solids capacity from the upstream processes such as bioreactors. In contrast, the feed has up to 30% v/v bulk volume for yeast.&lt;ref name=seven /&gt;
*Dissolved solids
The feed may contain dissolved solids consisting of valuable protein product and other soluble contaminants that requires removal in downstream purification.&lt;ref name=seven /&gt;

===Cone angle for discharge===
The angle of solid discharge is important as it affects the rate of concentrate being discharged.
The steeper the cone angle, the greater the G-force produced to clear the solids off the wall of the cone.&lt;ref name=seven /&gt; Furthermore, a steep cone angle helps in the compaction of the concentrate hence preventing discharge issues, resulting in more concentrate solid being discharged.

===Discharge frequency===
&lt;ref name=seven /&gt; For a centrifuge with intermittent discharge mode, determining the discharge frequency is essential to maximize productivity. The time, &lt;math&gt;t_d&lt;/math&gt;, to fill up the disk centrifuge is given by the expression:

&lt;math&gt; t_d = {v_s \eta_d \over Q_f \Phi_f} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=seven /&gt;

Where
:&lt;math&gt;v_s&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of solid hold-up in L, 
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_d&lt;/math&gt; is the discharge efficiency,
:&lt;math&gt;Q_f&lt;/math&gt; is the feed rate in L/min,
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_f&lt;/math&gt; is the feed volume in L/min.
An initial guess of is implemented otherwise calculated and from calculated &lt;math&gt;t_d&lt;/math&gt;, frequency discharge can be approximated. By monitoring the turbidity of centrate, further fine-tuning can be made.

===Liquid discharge===
In a nozzle disc bowl, centrate (solid output) or effluent liquid can be discharged by centripetal pump or paring pump. This is advantageous in reducing the energy of the discharge stream, allows air contact as well as reduces foaming especially when liquid has dissolved protein.&lt;ref name=seven /&gt;

==Heuristics==

===Heuristic methods for designing a process===
&lt;ref name=ten&gt;{{cite news|last=Walas|first=S.|title=Heuristics in chemical engineering|newspaper=Butterworth heinemann|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In process design, many of the important decisions are made based on experience and heuristics. There are many factors affecting process design. Furthermore, processes would be modified in accordance to production, market and environmental demands. A heuristic method available to help design separation process (conical plate centrifuge) is called Douglas (1988) methodology.

Douglas methodology uses a three level hierarchical systematic procedure where heuristics can be applied. The three level process designs are:
:1. Focuses on process flow diagram that includes the characteristic size calculations.
:2. A detailed process design (P&amp;ID) that provides mass and energy flow as well as equipment specifications.
:3. Mechanical design (construction of equipment).
Douglas’ method is suitable for modelling a conical plate centrifugal process as it breaks down a complicated design problem into simple piece.

===Possible heuristics for conical plate centrifuge===
Modification of a specific design in accordance to the heuristics (rule of thumb) for a particular process is one of the effective methods to be applied. Possible heuristics that can be used when designing certain parts of the conical plate centrifuge are:

'''Equipment'''
*Good rigidity is required, which can be achieved by large number of conical discs with appropriate wall thickness.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;
*The space between discs is at intervals of 0.4 to 0.75&amp;nbsp;mm, the exact space is determined by the liquid to be processed and its compatibility to the solids to be separated from the liquid.&lt;ref name=ten /&gt;
*For medium rate filtering, discs-type centrifuges are used.&lt;ref name=nine&gt;{{cite news|last=Chen|first=C.|title=Heuristics for Process Synthesis|newspaper=Department of Chemical Engineering Taiwan}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*For slow filtering slurries, sedimenting centrifuges are used.&lt;ref name="nine"/&gt;

'''Nozzles'''
*The size range of nozzle is between 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm diameter openings (for small centrifuges) to 3.2&amp;nbsp;mm diameter openings (for larger centrifuges).&lt;ref name=eleven&gt;{{cite web|title=Centrifugal Separation in Biotechnology|publisher=Disc Centrifuge}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The quantity of nozzles per centrifuge depends on the size of centrifuges, which is typically ranged from 12 to 24&amp;nbsp;mm. The quantity of nozzles must be selected so as to avoid solid accumulating between adjacent nozzles, which can build into the disk stack and disturb its clarification effectiveness.&lt;ref name="eleven"/&gt;
*The minimum allowable nozzle size is at least two times bigger than the diameter of the biggest particle to be discharged.&lt;ref name="eleven"/&gt;

'''Feed'''

*Liquids with small proportion of suspended solids.&lt;ref name=twelve&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rajagopal|first1=S.|first2=N.|last2=Douglas|title=A Hierarchical Procedure for the Conceptual Design of Solids Process|year=1992|issue=Department of Chemical Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Solid-liquid mixture leaving a three-phase reactor is separated using a conical plate centrifuge. The solid is sent to the solids separation system whereas the liquid is sent to the liquid separation system.&lt;ref name="twelve"/&gt;

'''Product'''
*Low moisture content in the wet cakes.&lt;ref name=thirteen /&gt;
*Solids are permitted in the mother liquor (sludge).&lt;ref name=thirteen&gt;{{cite news|last=Shanthini|first=R.|title=Downstream Processing (Recovery and Purification)|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Material of construction'''
*For high speed separation and highly corrosive suspension process, high-strength stainless steel (such as duplex and higher-grade duplex) is used for the bowl and accessories construction.&lt;ref name=eleven /&gt;
*For liquid that contains highly abrasive fine particulates, areas which are prone to wear and tear need to be protected by [[tungsten]] carbide and [[nickel]]-based alloys. Sealing using special [[ceramic]] material is also needed for process involving liquid with abrasive fines.&lt;ref name=eleven /&gt;

==Production of waste stream==
Conical plate centrifuge  produces waste sludge which needs to be treated before it can be disposed. The treatment for sludge is thickening, dewatering, digestion, drying and destruction, which can act as a post treatment to the conical plate centrifugation process. Further elaboration on these post treatment are:

===Sludge thickening===
Sludge thickening by gravitational settling and dynamic is used to minimize the volume of sludge. Feed with a content of 0.8% solids, can be thickened to a content of 4% solids, which means a fivefold decrease in sludge volume is obtained. This in return helps optimize the following steps by reducing the size of structure and operating costs.&lt;ref name=fourteen&gt;{{cite news|last=Degremont|title=Sludge Digestion Generated by Water Treatment|newspaper=Suez Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fifteen&gt;{{cite news|title=Centrifugal Sludge Thickening Process|newspaper=Wastewater System|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sludge thickening using centrifugal force is amongst the most common process used. There are two types of centrifuge designed for sludge thickening and both methods depends on the same solid-liquid separation principal. The first method is "[[solid bowl centrifuge]]", a horizontally-arranged helical screw that admits sludge, removes solid in a countercurrent fashion while allowing liquids to pass through. 
The moving shaft consists of a set of helical scrolls which push the solid waste against the flow of incoming sludge. As solid content starts to build up, it will become too heavy and then drops down to a collection bin. A [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqEODWcJwnY video] illustrates this process.

Centrifuge design depends mostly on solid throughput criteria and solids flux.&lt;ref name="fourteen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fifteen"/&gt;

===Sludge dewatering===
Sludge dewatering can be achieved by electro-osmosis or centrifugation process. Prior to dewatering, the thickened sludge is first conditioned. This is to increase the particle size and break the cohesion between the matter and the water, for better dewatering process.&lt;ref name=fourteen /&gt;

===Digestion===
The objective of digestion is to reduce sludge quantity, increase sludge dryness and stabilization of sludge. Furthermore, it provides valuation in green energy by producing [[biogas]]. The condition for digestion depends on the quantity and nature of sludge.&lt;ref name=fourteen /&gt;

===Sludge drying===
Sludge drying is necessary to remove remaining water available due to mechanical limitation during sludge dewatering. The thermal drying process is affected by the specific behaviour (depends on the dryness to be reached) of the sludge.&lt;ref name=fourteen /&gt;

===Sludge destruction===
In sludge destruction, all the organic matter present in the sludge is destroyed and during destruction, vapour and [[electricity]] is generated.&lt;ref name=fourteen /&gt;

==New development==
High separation efficiency of a centrifuge is the result of the combination of centrifugal force and built in pack plate usually a conical disc plate. Therefore, new development usually emphasize on these two areas.

===Biodiesel production===
A new semi-hermetic centrifuge was designed so that the feed pressure entering the system can be as low as possible by keeping the outlets open, which reduces the pressure drop across the separator. The stationary paring disc installed at the outlet also allows the process to be operated at low pressure. Another advantage of this design is it produces low noise level due to the [[rubber]]-damped assembly, jacketed frame and an outer bowl.&lt;ref name=sixteen&gt;{{cite news|last=Alfa Laval|title=High-Capacity Disc Stack Centrifuge For Biodiesel Production}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wastewater treatment===
Another recent development to the conical plate centrifuge is in sludge dewatering. With a wide range of design variants available to change particular designs to fit different applications, baffles have been fitted at the solid discharge end of the [[decanter]]. The bowl becomes almost full of solids rather than having a shallow layer at the bowl periphery and the solid discharge is drier.&lt;ref name=seventeen&gt;{{cite news|last=Sutherland|title=What's New with Centrifuges?|newspaper=Filtration and Separation Technology|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil and gas industry===
Society of Petroleum Engineer (SPE) has designed a new plate pack with vertical plates made of 360 stainless steel plates held by a plate support sleeve. It is arranged in parallel to the centrifuge axis. An increase in the centrifugal efficiency is obtained based on a computer simulation program ran beforehand. This is proven experimentally in which oil concentration in the effluent has decreased by about 25%. Further improvement of the plate pack may lead to a decrease of oil effluent concentration of more than 40% and seems feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plat|first=R.|author2=W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5584">A '''Coulomb collision''' is a binary [[elastic collision]] between two charged particles interacting through their own [[electric field]]. As with any [[inverse-square law]], the resulting trajectories of the colliding particles is a [[Hyperbola|hyperbolic]] [[Keplerian orbit]]. This type of collision is common in [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]] where the typical kinetic energy of the particles is too large to produce a significant deviation from the initial trajectories of the colliding particles, and the cumulative effect of many collisions is considered instead.

== Mathematical treatment for plasmas ==

In a plasma a Coulomb collision rarely results in a large deflection. The cumulative effect of the many small angle collisions, however, is often larger than the effect of the few large angle collisions that occur, so it is instructive to consider the collision dynamics in the limit of small deflections.

We can consider an electron of charge &lt;math&gt;-e&lt;/math&gt; and mass &lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; passing a stationary ion of charge &lt;math&gt;+Ze&lt;/math&gt; and much larger mass at a distance &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; with a speed &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. The perpendicular force is &lt;math&gt;(1/4 \pi \epsilon_0) Ze^2/b^2&lt;/math&gt; at the closest approach and the duration of the encounter is about &lt;math&gt;b/v&lt;/math&gt;. The product of these expressions divided by the mass is the change in perpendicular velocity:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta m_e v_\perp \approx \frac{Ze^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \, \frac{1}{vb}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the deflection angle is proportional to &lt;math&gt;1/v^2&lt;/math&gt;. Fast particles are "slippery" and thus dominate many transport processes. The efficiency of velocity-matched interactions is also the reason that fusion products tend to heat the electrons rather than (as would be desirable) the ions. If an electric field is present, the faster electrons feel less drag and become even faster in a "run-away" process.

In passing through a field of ions with density &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, an electron will have many such encounters simultaneously, with various impact parameters (distance to the ion) and directions. The cumulative effect can be described as a diffusion of the perpendicular momentum. The corresponding diffusion constant is found by integrating the squares of the individual changes in momentum. The rate of collisions with impact parameter between &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(b+{\rm d}b)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;nv (2 \pi b {\rm d} b)&lt;/math&gt;, so the diffusion constant is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
D_{v\perp} =
\int \left(\frac{Ze^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\right)^2 \, \frac{1}{v^2b^2} \, nv (2\pi b\,{\rm d}b) =
\left(\frac{Ze^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\right)^2 \, \frac{2\pi n}{v} \, \int \frac{{\rm d}b}{b}
&lt;/math&gt;

Obviously the integral diverges toward both small and large impact parameters. At small impact parameters, the momentum transfer also diverges. This is clearly unphysical since under the assumptions used here, the final perpendicular momentum cannot take on a value higher than the initial momentum. Setting the above estimate for &lt;math&gt;\Delta m_e v_\perp&lt;/math&gt; equal to &lt;math&gt;mv&lt;/math&gt;, we find the lower cut-off to the impact parameter to be about

:&lt;math&gt;b_0 = \frac{Ze^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \, \frac{1}{m_e v^2}&lt;/math&gt;

We can also use &lt;math&gt;\pi b_0^2&lt;/math&gt; as an estimate of the cross section for large-angle collisions. Under some conditions there is a more stringent lower limit due to quantum mechanics, namely the [[Matter wave|de Broglie wavelength]] of the electron, &lt;math&gt;h/(m_e v)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]].

At large impact parameters, the charge of the ion is [[Electric field screening|shielded]] by the tendency of electrons to cluster in the neighborhood of the ion and other ions to avoid it. The upper cut-off to the impact parameter should thus be approximately equal to the [[Debye length]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_D = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_0 k T_e}{n_e e^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

== Coulomb logarithm ==

The integral of &lt;math&gt;1/b&lt;/math&gt; thus yields the logarithm of the ratio of the upper and lower cut-offs. This number is known as the '''Coulomb logarithm''' and is designated by either &lt;math&gt;\ln \Lambda&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. It is the factor by which small-angle collisions are more effective than large-angle collisions. For many plasmas of interest it takes on values between &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;15&lt;/math&gt;. (For convenient formulas, see pages 34 and 35 of the ''[https://www.nrl.navy.mil/ppd/content/nrl-plasma-formulary NRL Plasma formulary]''.) The limits of the impact parameter integral are not sharp, but are uncertain by factors on the order of unity, leading to theoretical uncertainties on the order of &lt;math&gt;1/\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. For this reason it is often justified to simply take the convenient choice &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 10&lt;/math&gt;. The analysis here yields the scalings and orders of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J.D. |last=Huba |title=NRL Plasma formulary |pages=31 ff |url=https://www.nrl.navy.mil/ppd/sites/www.nrl.navy.mil.ppd/files/pdfs/NRL_FORMULARY_16.pdf |year=2016 |publisher=The Office of Naval Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CFA L-4756A.jpg|thumb]]

A '''crossed-field amplifier''' ('''CFA''') is a specialized [[vacuum tube]], first introduced in the mid-1950s and frequently used as a [[microwave]] [[amplifier]] in very-high-power [[transmitter]]s.

[[Raytheon]] engineer [[William C. Brown]]'s work to adapt [[magnetron]] principles to create a new broadband amplifier is generally recognized as the first CFA, which he called an '''Amplitron'''. Other names that are sometimes used by CFA manufacturers include '''Platinotron''' or '''Stabilotron'''.

A CFA has lower [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] and [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] than other microwave amplifier tubes (such as [[klystron tube|klystron]]s or [[traveling-wave tube]]s); but it is more efficient and capable of much higher output [[power (physics)|power]].

Peak output powers of many [[megawatts]] and average power levels of tens of [[kilowatts]] can be achieved, with efficiency ratings in excess of 70 percent. Their current use is in ground stations for TVRO broadcasting and Deep Space telecommunications networks.

== Operation ==
[[File:Crossed field amplifier.png|thumb|Crossed-field amplifier internal operation]]
The electric and magnetic fields in a CFA are perpendicular to each other ("crossed fields"). This is the same type of field interaction used in a [[magnetron]]; as a result, the two devices share many characteristics (such as high peak power and efficiency) and they have similar physical appearances. However, a magnetron is an oscillator and a CFA is an amplifier (although a CFA can be driven to oscillate by application of improper low voltages as can any amplifier); a CFA's RF circuit (or slow-wave structure) is similar to that in a [[Traveling-wave tube#Coupled-cavity TWT|coupled-cavity TWT]].

The CFA has the useful property that when power is shut off, the input simply passes to the output with very little loss. This avoids the need for RF bypass switching in the event of failure.

Two CFAs can be connected sequentially with only one powered; if it fails, power can be removed from the primary tube and applied to the secondary as a backup. This approach with built-in redundancy was used on the [[S-band]] downlink transmitter on the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] where high efficiency and reliability were needed.
&lt;ref name="lm"&gt;{{cite web |author = [[Grumman Aerospace]] | title = Apollo Operations Handbook, Lunar Module, LM 10 and Subsequent, Volume I, Subsystems Data,  LMA790-3-LM10-and-Subsequent| publisher = NASA | url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/LM10HandbookVol1.pdf | format = pdf| accessdate=21 October 2012| date=1 April 1971| pages=804| volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2012}}

A large negative voltage is placed on the green electrode in the center, and a large magnetic field is directed perpendicular to the page. This forms a thin spinning disk of electrons with a flow pattern like spinning water as it drains from a sink or toilet. A slow-wave structure is located above and below the spinning disk of electrons. Electrons flow much slower than the speed of light, and the slow wave structure reduces the velocity of the input RF enough to match the electron velocity.

The RF input is introduced into the slow wave structure. The alternating microwave field causes the electrons to alternately speed up and slow down. These disturbances grow larger as electrons spiral around the device, and electrons slow down as the RF energy grows. This produces amplification.

There is a small amount of RF feedback from output to input. This creates a slight random [[jitter|phase jitter]] when the device is pulsed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3923">In [[thermodynamics]], a '''departure function''' is defined for any thermodynamic property as the difference between the property as computed for an [[ideal gas]] and the property of the species as it exists in the real world, for a specified temperature ''T'' and pressure ''P''.  Common departure functions include those for [[enthalpy]], [[entropy]], and [[internal energy]].

Departure functions are used to calculate real fluid extensive properties (i.e. properties which are computed as a difference between two states).  A departure function gives the difference between the real state, at a finite volume or non-zero pressure and temperature, and the ideal state, usually at zero pressure or infinite volume and temperature.

For example, to evaluate enthalpy change between two points h(v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and h(v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) we first compute the enthalpy departure function between the v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and infinite volume at T=T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, then add to that the ideal gas enthalpy change due to the temperature change from T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then subtract the departure function value between v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and infinite volume.

Departure functions are computed by integrating a function which depends on an [[equation of state]] and its derivative.

== General Expressions ==
General Expressions for the [[Enthalpy]] ''H'', the [[Entropy]] ''S'' and the [[Gibbs Energy]] ''G'' are given by{{ref|Poling}}
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{H^\mathrm{ig}-H}{RT} = \int_V^\infty \left[ T \left(\frac{\partial Z}{\partial T}\right)_V \right] \frac{\mathrm{d}V}{V} + 1 - Z&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{S^\mathrm{ig}-S}{R} = \int_V^\infty \left[ T \left(\frac{\partial Z}{\partial T}\right)_V - 1 + Z\right] \frac{\mathrm{d}V}{V} - \ln Z&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{G^\mathrm{ig}-G}{RT} = \int_V^\infty (1-Z) \frac{\mathrm{d}V}{V} + \ln Z + 1 - Z&lt;/math&gt;

== Departure functions for Peng-Robinson equation of state ==

The [[Equation of state#Peng–Robinson equation of state|Peng-Robinson]] equation of state relates the three interdependent state properties pressure ''P'', temperature ''T'', and molar volume ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;.  From the state properties (''P'', ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''T''), one may compute the departure function for enthalpy per mole (denoted ''h'') and entropy per mole (''s''){{ref|Kyle}}:

:&lt;math&gt;h_{T,P}-h_{T,P}^{\mathrm{ideal}}=RT_C\left[T_r(Z-1)-2.078(1+\kappa)\sqrt{\alpha}\ln\left(\frac{Z+2.414B}{Z-0.414B}\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s_{T,P}-s_{T,P}^{\mathrm{ideal}}=R\left[\ln(Z-B)-2.078\kappa\left(\frac{1+\kappa}{\sqrt{T_r}}-\kappa\right)\ln\left(\frac{Z+2.414B}{Z-0.414B}\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is defined in the Peng-Robinson equation of state, ''T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[reduced temperature]], ''P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[reduced pressure]], ''Z'' is the [[compressibility factor]], and

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa = 0.37464 + 1.54226\;\omega - 0.26992\;\omega^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B = 0.07780\frac{P_r}{T_r}&lt;/math&gt;

Typically, one knows two of the three state properties (''P'', ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''T''), and must compute the third directly from the equation of state under consideration.  To calculate the third state property, it is necessary to know three constants for the species at hand: the [[critical temperature]] ''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'', [[critical pressure]] ''P&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the [[acentric factor]] ''ω''.  But once these constants are known, it is possible to evaluate all of the above expressions and hence determine the enthalpy and entropy departures.

In the U.S., fractional inch and gauge '''drill bit sizes''' are in common use. In nearly all other countries, metric drill bit sizes are most common, and all others are anachronisms or are reserved for dealing with designs from the US. The [[British Standards]] on replacing gauge size drill bits with metric sizes in the UK was first published in 1959.

A comprehensive table for metric, fractional wire and tapping sizes can be found at the '''[[drill and tap size chart]]'''.

==Metric drill bit sizes==
[[File:drill set 1.jpg|thumb|150px|Metric drill set, 1.0–6.0&amp;nbsp;mm by 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm, jobber length. The case that holds them in an indexed order (by size), via a graduated series of holes, is called a drill index.]]

Metric drill bit sizes define the diameter of the bit in terms of standard [[Metric system|metric]] lengths. Standards organizations define sets of sizes that are conventionally manufactured and stocked. For example, British Standard BS 328 defines sizes from 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm to 25.0&amp;nbsp;mm.

From 0.2 through 0.98&amp;nbsp;mm, sizes are defined as follows, where ''N'' is an integer from 2 through 9:
* ''N'' · 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm
* ''N'' · 0.1 + 0.02&amp;nbsp;mm
* ''N'' · 0.1 + 0.05&amp;nbsp;mm
* ''N'' · 0.1 + 0.08&amp;nbsp;mm

From 1.0 through 2.95&amp;nbsp;mm, sizes are defined as follows, where ''N'' is an integer from 10 through 29:
* ''N'' · 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm
* ''N'' · 0.1 + 0.05&amp;nbsp;mm

From 3.0 through 13.9&amp;nbsp;mm, sizes are defined as follows, where ''N'' is an integer from 30 through 139:
* ''N'' · 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm

From 14.0 through 25.0&amp;nbsp;mm, sizes are defined as follows, where ''M'' is an integer from 14 through 25:
* ''M'' · 1&amp;nbsp;mm
* ''M'' · 1 + 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm
* ''M'' · 1 + 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm
* ''M'' · 1 + 0.75&amp;nbsp;mm

In smaller sizes, bits are available in smaller diameter increments. This reflects both the smaller drilled hole diameter tolerance possible on smaller holes and the wishes of designers to have drill bit sizes available within at most 10% of an arbitrary hole size.

The price and availability of particular size bits does not change uniformly across the size range. Bits at size increments of 1&amp;nbsp;mm are most commonly available, and lowest price. Sets of bits in 1&amp;nbsp;mm increments might be found on a market stall. In 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm increments, any hardware store. In 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm increments, any engineers' store. Sets are not commonly available in smaller size increments, except for drill bits below 1&amp;nbsp;mm diameter. Drill bits of the less routinely used sizes, such as 2.55&amp;nbsp;mm, would have to be ordered from a specialist drill bit supplier. This subsetting of standard sizes is in contrast to general practice with number gauge drill bits, where it is rare to find a set on the market which does not contain every gauge.

There are also [[Renard series]] sequences of preferred metric drill bits:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dasarathi-Cadem|title=Preferred sizes in engineering|url=http://cadem.com/cncetc/cnc-preferred-sizes/|website=CNC etc|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* R5 (factor 1.58) : M2.5, M4, M6, M10, M16, M24
* R10 (factor 1.26): M3, M5, M8, M12, M20, M30

Metric dimensioning is routinely used for drill bits of all types, although the details of BS 328 apply only to twist drill bits. For example, a set of [[drill bit#Forstner bits|Forstner bits]] may contain 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30&amp;nbsp;mm diameter cutters.

==Fractional-inch drill bit sizes==
[[File:2010-01-21 Craftsman Professional cobalt drill bit set.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Fractional drill bit set by [[Craftsman (tools)|Craftsman]]]]

Fractional inch drill bit sizes are still in common use in the United States and in any factory (around the globe) that makes inch-sized products for the U.S. market. 

ANSI B94.11M-1979 sets size standards for jobber-length straight-shank twist drill bits from 1/64&amp;nbsp;inch through 1&amp;nbsp;inch in 1/64&amp;nbsp;inch increments. For [[Machine taper#Morse|Morse taper]]-shank drill bits, the standard continues in 1/64&amp;nbsp;inch increments up to 1¾&amp;nbsp;inch, then 1/32&amp;nbsp;inch increments up to 2¼&amp;nbsp;inch, 1/16&amp;nbsp;inch increments up to 3&amp;nbsp;inches, 1/8&amp;nbsp;inch increments up to 3¼&amp;nbsp;inches, and a single 1/4&amp;nbsp;inch increment to 3½&amp;nbsp;inches.  One aspect of this method of sizing is that the size increment between drill bits becomes larger as bit sizes get smaller: 100% for the step from 1/64th to 1/32nd, but a much smaller percentage between 1 47/64th and 1 3/4.

Drill bit sizes are written down on paper and etched onto bits as [[irreducible fraction]]s. So, instead of 78/64&amp;nbsp;inch, or 1 14/64&amp;nbsp;inch, the size is noted as 1 7/32&amp;nbsp;inch.

Below is a chart providing the decimal-fraction equivalents that are most relevant to fractional-inch drill bit sizes (that is, 0 to 1 by 64ths). (Decimal places for .25, .5, and .75 are shown to [[thousandth of an inch|thousandths]] [.250, .500, .750], which is how machinists usually think about them ["two-fifty", "five hundred", "seven-fifty"]. Machinists generally truncate the decimals after thousandths; for example, a 27/64" drill bit may be referred to in shop-floor speech as a "four-twenty-one drill".)

Charts like this, printed at [[poster]] size, are widely posted on machine shop walls for handy reference by machinists as they work. For some tasks it is faster and less annoying to glance down a column of numbers on a poster than it is to punch calculator buttons or do penciled arithmetic. It is also true that with long experience, talented machinists have much of the chart memorized anyway (with decimals to truncated thou). But the poster is there for reference and quick sanity check as needed. Tool distributors often give away such charts as [[promotional merchandise]]. 

For anyone looking to create such a poster or to tailor the design and colors to their own preferences, it is useful to realize that [[spreadsheet]] software makes this fast and easy to do. The tools that the software provides—formulas, cell formatting with rounding, autofill, and sorting by numerical order—obviate any manual calculation and data entry. For example, one can create the inch nominal rows for the chart—with columns for inch fraction, inch decimal, and corresponding millimeter decimal conversion—using formulas, cell formatting with rounding, and autofill; and one can then create the metric nominal rows below that, with the inch decimal conversions being provided by formula; and then one can sort the whole sheet by size order, automatically interposing the inch nominal and metric nominal rows by size order. Font and color can be chosen to make a poster-size chart that is easy to read from 1 or 2 meters away. Printing can be done on a desktop printer, with the letter-size sheets then being stapled together to make up the larger poster.

==Number and letter gauge drill bit sizes {{anchor|Number drill sizes|Letter drill sizes}} ==
[[File:Number 80 drill bit.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A #80 drill bit]]
Number drill bit gauge sizes range from size 80 (the smallest) to size 1 (the largest) followed by letter gauge size A (the smallest) to size Z (the largest). Although the [[ASME]] B94.11M twist drill standard, for example, lists sizes as small as size 97, sizes smaller than 80 are rarely encountered in practice.

Number and letter sizes are commonly used for [[drill bit#Twist drill bits|twist drill bits]] rather than other drill forms, as the range encompass the sizes for which twist drill bits are most often used.

The gauge-to-diameter ratio is not defined by a formula, but is instead based on, but is not identical to, the [[Stubs Steel Wire Gauge]], which originated in Britain during the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pöll|first=J. S.|date=June 1999|title=The story of the gauge|journal=Anaesthesia|volume=54|issue=6|pages=575–581|issn=0003-2409|pmid=10403873}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying graph, with each step along the horizontal axis being one gauge size, illustrate the change in diameter with change in gauge, as well as the reduction in step size as the gauge size decreases.

Number and letter gauge drill bits are still in common use in the U.S. and to a lesser extent the UK, where they have largely been superseded by metric sizes. Other countries that formerly used the number series have for the most part also abandoned these in favour of metric sizes.

==Screw-machine-length drill==
The shortest standard-length drills (that is, lowest length-to-diameter ratio) are ''screw-machine-length drills'' (sometimes abbreviated ''S/M''). They are named for their use in [[screw machine (automatic lathe)|screw machine]]s. Their shorter flute length and shorter overall length compared to a standard jobber bit results in a more rigid drill bit, reducing deflection and breakage. They are  rarely available in retail hardware stores or home centers.

==Jobber-length drill==
Jobber-length drills are the most commonly found type of drill. The length of the flutes is between 9 and 14 times the diameter of the drill, depending on the drill size. So a {{convert|1/2|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} diameter drill will be able to drill a hole {{convert|4+1/2|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} deep, since it is 9 times the diameter in length.  A {{convert|1/8|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} diameter drill can drill a hole {{convert|1+5/8|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} deep, since it is 13 times the diameter in flute length.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amesweb.info/Tooling/StraightShankJobbersTwistDrills.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''jobber'' refers to a [[wholesaling|wholesale distributor]]—a person or company that buys from manufacturers and sells to retailers. (It was especially widely used in the 1850-1950 period.) Manufacturers producing drill bits "for the trade" (as opposed to for specialized machining applications with particular length and design requirements) made ones of medium length suitable for a wide variety of jobs, because that was the type most desirable for general distribution. Thus, at the time that the name of jobber-length drill bits became common, it reflected the same concept that names like ''general-purpose'' and ''multipurpose'' reflect.

==Aircraft-length drill==
'''Extended-reach''' or '''long-series''' drills are commonly called aircraft-length from their original use in manufacturing riveted aluminum aircraft. For bits thicker than a minimum size such as 1/8 inch, they are available in fixed lengths such as 6, 8, 12, or 18 inches rather than the progressive lengths of jobber drills. 
[[File:LongSeriesDrill-11 32.jpg|thumb|250px|11/32 inch drills: long-series Morse, plain Morse, jobber]]
The image shows a long-series drill compared to its diametric equivalents, all are {{convert|11/32|in|mm|lk=on}} in diameter. The equivalent Morse taper drill shown in the middle is of the usual length for a taper-shank drill. The lower drill bit is the ''jobber'' or ''parallel shank'' equivalent.

{{Clear}}

==Center drill bit sizes==
[[File:CenterDrills123456.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Center drills, numbers 1 (bottom) through to 6 (top)]]
[[Drill bit#Center and spotting drill bits|Center drills]] are available with two different included angles; 60 degrees is the standard for drilling centre holes (for example for subsequent centre support in the [[lathe]]), but 90 degrees is also common and used when locating holes prior to drilling with twist drills. Center drills are made specifically for drilling lathe centers, but are often used as spotting drills because of their radial stiffness.

==Spotting drill bit sizes==
Spotting drills are available in a relatively small range of sizes, both metric and imperial, as their purpose is to provide a precise spot for guiding a standard twist drill. Commonly available sizes are 1/8", 1/4", 3/8", 1/2", 5/8", 3/4", 4&amp;nbsp;mm, 6&amp;nbsp;mm, 8&amp;nbsp;mm, 10&amp;nbsp;mm, 12&amp;nbsp;mm, 14&amp;nbsp;mm, 16&amp;nbsp;mm and 18&amp;nbsp;mm. The drills are most ordinarily available with either 90° or 120° included angle points.

[[File:Dutch Roll Damping Technique.jpg|{{Largethumb}}|Dutch roll damping technique, scanned from U.S. Air Force flight manual.]]
'''Dutch roll''' is a type of [[aircraft]] motion, consisting of an out-of-[[Phase (waves)|phase]] combination of "tail-wagging" and rocking from side to side. This [[yaw (rotation)|yaw]]-roll coupling is one of the basic [[flight dynamics|flight dynamic]] modes (others include [[phugoid]], [[short period]], and [[spiral divergence]]). This motion is normally well damped in most light aircraft, though some aircraft with well-damped Dutch roll modes can experience a degradation in [[damping]] as [[airspeed]] decreases and [[altitude]] increases. Dutch roll stability can be artificially increased by the installation of a [[yaw damper]]. Wings placed well above the center of gravity, sweepback ([[swept wing]]s) and [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] wings tend to increase the roll restoring force, and therefore increase the Dutch roll tendencies; this is why high-winged aircraft often are slightly [[Dihedral (aircraft)#Anhedral|anhedral]], and transport-category swept-wing aircraft are equipped with yaw dampers.

==Stability==
In aircraft design, Dutch roll results from relatively weaker positive [[directional stability]] as opposed to positive [[Flight dynamics#Lateral modes|lateral stability]]. When an aircraft rolls around the longitudinal axis, a [[Slip (aerodynamic)|sideslip]] is introduced into the [[relative wind]] in the direction of the rolling motion. Strong lateral stability begins to restore the aircraft to level flight. At the same time, somewhat weaker directional stability attempts to correct the sideslip by aligning the aircraft with the perceived relative wind. Since directional stability is weaker than lateral stability for the particular aircraft, the restoring yaw motion lags significantly behind the restoring roll motion. The aircraft passes through level flight as the yawing motion is continuing in the direction of the original roll. At that point, the sideslip is introduced in the opposite direction and the process is reversed.

==Mechanism==
The most common mechanism of Dutch roll occurrence is a moment of yawing motion which can be caused by any number of factors.  As a swept-wing aircraft yaws (to the right, for instance), the left wing becomes less-swept than the right wing in reference to the relative wind.  Because of this, the left wing develops more lift than the right wing causing the aircraft to roll to the right.  This motion continues until the yaw angle of the aircraft reaches the point where the vertical stabilizer effectively becomes a wind vane and reverses the yawing motion.  As the aircraft yaws back to the left, the right wing then becomes less swept than the left resulting in the right wing developing more lift than the left.  The aircraft then rolls to the left as the yaw angle again reaches the point where the aircraft wind-vanes back the other direction and the whole process repeats itself.  The average duration of a Dutch roll half-cycle is 2 to 3 seconds.

The Dutch roll mode can be excited by any use of [[aileron]] or [[rudder]], but for flight test purposes it is usually excited with a rudder singlet (short, sharp motions of the rudder to a specified angle, and then back to the centered position) or doublet (a pair of such motions in opposite directions). Some larger aircraft are better excited with aileron inputs. Periods can range from a few seconds for [[light-sport aircraft|light aircraft]] to a minute or more for [[airliner]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Rolling on a heading==
Dutch roll is also the name (considered by professionals to be a misnomer) given to a coordination [[aerobatic maneuver|maneuver]] generally taught to student [[aircraft pilot|pilots]] to help them improve their "stick-and-rudder" technique. The aircraft is alternately rolled as much as 60 degrees left and right while [[rudder]] is applied to keep the nose of the aircraft pointed at a fixed point. More correctly, this is a rudder coordination practice exercise, to teach a student pilot how to correct for the effect known as adverse aileron yaw during roll inputs.

This coordination technique is better referred to as "rolling on a heading", wherein the aircraft is rolled in such a way as to maintain an accurate heading without the nose moving from side-to-side (or yawing). The yaw motion is induced through the use of ailerons alone due to aileron drag, wherein the lifting wing (aileron down) is doing more work than the descending wing (aileron up) and therefore creates more drag, forcing the lifting wing back, yawing the aircraft toward it. This yawing effect produced by rolling motion is known as [[adverse yaw]]. This has to be countered precisely by application of rudder ''in the same direction'' as the aileron control (left stick, left rudder - right stick, right rudder). This is known as synchronised controls when done properly, and is difficult to learn and apply well. The correct amount of rudder to apply with aileron is different for each aircraft.

==Name==
The origin of the name Dutch roll is uncertain. However, it is likely that this term, describing a lateral asymmetric motion of an airplane, was borrowed from a reference to similar-appearing motion in [[ice skating]]. In 1916, aeronautical engineer [[Jerome C. Hunsaker|Jerome Clarke Hunsaker]] published the following quote:
"Dutch roll – the third element in the [lateral] motion [of an airplane] is a yawing to the right and left, combined with rolling. The motion is oscillatory of period for 7 to 12 seconds, which may or may not be damped. The analogy to 'Dutch Roll' or 'Outer Edge' in ice skating is obvious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hunsaker| first=Jerome |year=1916 | title=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of America| volume=2| page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1916, Dutch Roll was the term used for skating repetitively to right and left (by analogy to the motion described for the aircraft) on the outer edge of one's skates. By 1916, the term had been imported from skating to aeronautical engineering, perhaps by Hunsaker himself. 1916 was only five years after G. H. Bryan did the first mathematical analysis of lateral motion of aircraft in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bryan, G. H. |year=1911 |title=Stability in Aviation |page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accidents==
* On October 30, 2015 a [[Leonardo-Finmeccanica]]-Helicopters Division (formerly [[AgustaWestland]]) [[AW609]] prototype crashed in Italy killing its two pilots. Further investigation by the Italian [[Agenzia Nazionale per la Sicurezza del Volo|ANSV]] established a Dutch roll during a high-speed test could be the cause.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.verticalmag.com/news/article/AgustaWestlandAW609wasperforminghighspeedtestsondayofcrash&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ansv.it/cgi-bin/ita/AW609%20N609AG%20interim%20statement%20and%20safety%20recommendations.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 3 May 2013, a [[McConnell AFB]], KS (USAF) [[Boeing_KC-135_Stratotanker|KC-135R]], ''63-8877'', flown by a [[Fairchild AFB]], Washington aircrew, broke up in flight about eight minutes after taking off from [[Transit Center at Manas|Manas Air base]] in [[Kyrgyzstan]], killing all three crew members.&lt;ref&gt;{{ASN accident|title= 63-8877|id= 20130503-0|accessdate= 21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Humphrey |first=Jeff |title=Cellphone video may have captured deadly KC-135 crash |url=http://www.kxly.com/news/spokane-news/cell-phone-video-may-have-captured-deadly-kc135-crash/20654806 |location=Spokane, Washington |date=20 June 2013 |accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After investigation, it was determined that a rudder power control unit malfunction led to a Dutch roll oscillatory instability. Not recognizing the Dutch roll, the crew used the rudder to stay on course, which exacerbated the instability, leading to an unrecoverable flight condition. The over-stressed tail section detached and the aircraft broke apart soon after. The aircraft was at cruise altitude about 200&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Bishkek]] before it crashed in a mountainous area near the village of Chorgolu, close to the border between Kyrgyzstan and [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Investigation board determines cause of KC-135 crash in May |url=http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/473716/investigation-board-determines-cause-of-kc-135-crash-in-may.aspx |date=14 March 2014 |accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davis |first=Kristin |date=13 March 2014 |title=Malfunction, pilot error caused May KC-135 crash |url=http://www.airforcetimes.com/article/20140313/NEWS/303130048/Malfunction-pilot-error-caused-May-KC-135-crash |newspaper=Air Force Times |location=Springfield, Virginia |accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Camden |first=Jim |date=13 March 2014 |title=Tanker’s tail separated in flight before Kyrgyzstan crash |url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2014/mar/13/tankers-tail-separated-flight-kyrgyzstan-crash/ |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=Spokane, Washington |accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=31 December 2013 |title=UNITED STATES AIR FORCE AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION BOARD REPORT; KC-135R, T/N 63-8877; 22D AIR REFUELING WING McCONNELL AIR FORCE BASE, KANSAS; LOCATION: 6 MILES SOUTH OF CHALDOVAR, KYRGYZ REPUBLIC |url=http://media.spokesman.com/documents/2014/03/AIBReportwithoutTabs.pdf |accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Air Transat Flight 961]], an [[Airbus A310]], was involved in a Dutch roll incident following structural failure of the rudder at cruising altitude after departure from [[Juan Gualberto Gomez Airport]], [[Varadero]], [[Cuba]], on March 6, 2005. The aircraft returned to the airport with one flight attendant slightly injured and with serious structural damage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2766">'''Essent''' [[Naamloze vennootschap|N.V.]], based in [['s-Hertogenbosch]], [[Netherlands]], is an [[energy industry|energy]] company. It is a public limited liability corporation. Essent is the largest energy company in the Netherlands. Belgium is their second home market. Essent provides customers with gas, electricity, heat and energy services. Essent (including its predecessors) has over 90 years experience of generating, trading, transmitting and supplying electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essent.eu/content/about_essent/about_essent/profile/index.html www.essent.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; Essent is part of [[Innogy|Innogy SE]].

Essent has 2.3 million customers for electricity and about 2.0 million for gas.&lt;ref name=essent.nl&gt;[http://www.essent.nl/content/overessent/het_bedrijf/profiel/index.html www.essent.nl]&lt;/ref&gt;

Essent was formed in 1999 by the merger of PNEM/MEGA Groep and EDON Groep, energy groups based in the south and north of the Netherlands respectively.

==Shareholding structure==
Until 1 October 2009, the shares of Essent were owned by six Dutch provinces of [[Overijssel]] (18%), [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] (6%), [[North Brabant|Noord-Brabant]] (30.8%), [[Drenthe]] (2.3%), [[Flevoland]] (0.02%) and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] (16%) and by more than 100 municipalities in these provinces and in the province of [[Friesland]] (the remaining 26%). 

In January 2009, German energy major, [[RWE AG]], announced its intention to buy out all outstanding and issued shares of Essent. The deal, valued to be around 9.3 billion euros, would make Essent an operating company of RWE in the Netherlands and [[Belgium]]. This deal was objected by socialist legislators, who were not in favor of privatizing a prominent public utility. On 30 September 2009, the deal was closed. Since the split of RWE and Innogy as of 1 April 2016, the power generation business was transferred to RWE Generation NL B.V., while Essent as retail and renewable energy company remained in the Innogy group.

==Achievements==
In 2010 Essent opened the first commercial fast-charge station for [[electric vehicle]]s in Europe. The charger produced by [[Epyon]] charges electric 9-person taxi-vans in 30 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gizmag.com/epyon-opens-europes-first-commercial-fast-charging-station-for-evs/15166/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Power engineering}}
An '''HVDC converter station''' (or simply '''converter station''') is a specialised type of [[electrical substation|substation]] which forms the terminal equipment for a [[high-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) transmission line.&lt;ref&gt;Arrillaga, Jos; High Voltage Direct Current Transmission, second edition, Institution of Electrical Engineers, {{ISBN|0 85296 941 4}}, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;   It converts direct current to [[alternating current]] or the reverse.  In addition to the [[power inverter|converter]], the station usually contains:
* three-phase alternating current switch gear
* transformers
* capacitors or [[synchronous condenser]]s for reactive power
* [[electronic filter|filter]]s for harmonic suppression, and
* direct current switch gear.

==Components==
===Converter===
{{main|HVDC converter}}
[[File:Henday-Converter-Station.JPG|thumb|231px|Valve hall at Henday converter station, part of the [[Nelson River DC Transmission System]] in [[Canada]].]]
The converter is usually installed in a building called the [[valve hall]].  Early HVDC systems used [[mercury-arc valve]]s, but since the mid-1970s, solid state devices such as [[thyristor]]s have been used. Converters using thyristors or mercury-arc valves are known as ''line commutated converters''. In thyristor-based converters, many thyristors are connected in series to form a thyristor valve, and each converter normally consists of six or twelve thyristor valves. The thyristor valves are usually grouped in pairs or groups of four and can stand on insulators on the floor or hang from insulators from the ceiling.

Line commutated converters require voltage from the AC network for commutation, but since the late 1990s, voltage sourced converters have started to be used for HVDC. Voltage sourced converters use [[insulated-gate bipolar transistor]]s instead of thyristors, and these can provide power to a deenergized AC system.

Almost all converters used for HVDC are intrinsically able to operate with power conversion in either direction. Power conversion from AC to DC is called ''[[rectifier|rectification]]'' and conversion from DC to AC is called ''[[inverter|inversion]]''.

===DC equipment===
[[File:BalticCableHerrenwyk.jpg|thumb|HVDC cable termination and DC smoothing reactor on the [[Baltic Cable]] HVDC link.]]
The direct current equipment often includes a [[inductor|coil]] (called a ''reactor'') that adds [[inductance]] in series with the DC line to help smooth the direct current. The inductance typically amounts to between 0.1 [[Henry (unit)|H]] and 1 H. The smoothing reactor can have either an air-core or an iron-core. Iron-core coils look like oil-filled high voltage transformers. Air-core smoothing coils resemble, but are considerably larger than, carrier frequency choke coils in high voltage transmission lines and are supported by [[Electrical insulation|insulator]]s. Air coils have the advantage of generating less acoustical noise than iron-core coils, they eliminate the potential environmental hazard of spilled oil, and they do not saturate under transient high current [[Short circuit|fault]] conditions. This part of the plant will also contain instruments for measurement of direct current and voltage.  

Special direct current filters are used to eliminate high frequency interference. Such filters are required if the transmission line will use [[power-line communication]] techniques for communication and control, or if the overhead line will run through populated areas. These filters can be passive [[LC circuit|LC]] filters or active filters, consisting of an amplifier coupled through transformers and protection capacitors, which gives a signal out of phase to the interference signal on the line, thereby cancelling it. Such a system was used on the [[Baltic Cable]] HVDC project.

===Converter transformer===
[[File:Transformateur du complexe La Grande.jpg|thumb|right|A single-phase, three-winding converter transformer.]]
The converter [[transformer]]s step up the voltage of the AC supply network. Using a star-to-delta or "[[Delta-wye transformer|wye-delta]]" connection of the transformer windings, the converter can operate with 12 pulses for each cycle in the AC supply, which eliminates numerous harmonic current components. The insulation of the transformer windings must be specially designed to withstand a large DC potential to earth. Converter transformers can be built as large as 300 megavolt-amperes ([[megawatts|MW]]) as a single unit. It is impractical to transport larger transformers, so when larger ratings are required, several individual transformers are connected together. Either two three-phase units or three single-phase units can be used. With the latter variant only one type of transformer is used, making the supply of a spare transformer more economical. 

Converter transformers operate with high flux Power Steps In the Four Steps of the Converter per cycle, and so produce more acoustic noise than normal three-phase power transformers.  This effect should be considered in the siting of an HVDC converter station. Noise-reducing enclosures may be applied.

===Reactive power===
When line commutated converters are used, the converter station will require between 40% and 60% of its power rating as reactive power. This can be provided by banks of switched capacitors or by [[synchronous condenser]]s, or if a suitable [[power station|power generating station]] is located close to the static inverter plant, the generators in the power station. The demand for reactive power can be reduced if the converter transformers have on-load tap changers with a sufficient range of taps for AC voltage control. Some of the reactive power requirement can be supplied in the harmonic filter components.

Voltage sourced converters can generate or absorb reactive as well as real power, and additional reactive power equipment is generally not needed.

===Harmonic filters ===
Harmonic filters are necessary for the elimination of the harmonic waves and for the production of the reactive power at line commutated converter stations. At plants with six pulse line commutated converters, complex harmonic filters are necessary because there are odd numbered harmonics of the orders &lt;math&gt; 6n + 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;6n - 1&lt;/math&gt; produced on the AC side and even harmonics of order &lt;math&gt;6n&lt;/math&gt; on the DC side. At 12 pulse converter stations, only harmonic voltages or currents of the order &lt;math&gt;12n + 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;12n - 1&lt;/math&gt; (on the AC side) or &lt;math&gt;12n&lt;/math&gt; (on the DC side) result. Filters are tuned to the expected harmonic frequencies and consist of series combinations of capacitors and inductors. 

Voltage sourced converters generally produce lower intensity harmonics than line commutated converters.  As a result, harmonic filters are generally smaller or may be omitted altogether.

Beside the harmonic filters, equipment is also provided to  eliminate spurious signals in the frequency range of power-line carrier equipment in the range of 30&amp;nbsp;kHz to 500&amp;nbsp;kHz. These filters are usually near the  alternating current terminal of the static inverter transformer. They consist of a coil which passes the load current, with a parallel capacitor to form a resonant circuit.

In special cases, it may be possible to use exclusively machines for generating the reactive power. This is realized at the terminal of [[HVDC Volgograd-Donbass]] situated on [[Volga Hydroelectric Station]].

===AC switchgear===
The three-phase alternating current switch gear of a converter station is similar to that of an AC substation. It will contain [[circuit breaker]]s for overcurrent protection of the converter transformers, isolating switches, grounding switches, and instrument transformers for control, measurement and protection.  The station will also have [[lightning arrester]]s for protection of the AC equipment from [[lightning]] surges on the AC system.

==Others==

===Required area===
The area required for a converter station with a transmission rating of 600 megawatts and a transmission voltage of 400 kV is approximately 300 x 300 metres (1000 x 1000 feet). Lower-voltage plants may require somewhat less ground area, since less air space clearance would be required around outdoor high-voltage equipment.

===Location factors===
Converter stations produce acoustic noise and radio-frequency interference. Walls may provide noise protection. As with all AC substations, oil from equipment must be prevented from contaminating ground water in case of a spill.  Substantial area may be required for overhead transmission lines, but can be reduced if underground cable is used.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5498">[[File:Konstantinsmedaillon.jpg|thumb|Silver [[medallion]] of 315; Constantine with a [[chi-rho]] symbol as the crest of his helmet]]
The '''Helmet of Constantine''' was a helmet or form of helmet worn by the Roman Emperor [[Constantine the Great]], now lost, which featured in his imperial [[iconography]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreas Alföldi]], "The Helmet of Constantine with the Christian Monogram", ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 22, Part 1: Papers Dedicated to Sir George Macdonald K.C.B. (1932), pp. 9-23, Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/297083 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a story recorded by [[Ambrose]] and others, it included [[relic]]s gathered in the [[Holy Land]] by his mother, empress [[Helena (empress)|Helena]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_qQsA7gE6UoC&amp;pg=PA200&amp;lpg=PA200&amp;dq ''Ambrose Of Milan: Political Letters And Speeches''], pp. 199-200&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine’s conversion to [[Christianity]], which happened around AD 300, was of great importance. In this period it was believed that touching the body of the deceased or even something that came in contact with the person who had died, was said to have special powers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Nickell]], ''Relics of Christ''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=various&gt;''A Dictionary of Christian Antiquities''.&lt;/ref&gt;  This belief started a huge obsession with finding these [[relics]] to protect churches, cities, and even people.

==History==
Constantine I was one of these people who was, as they thought, protected because he had a relic in his possession. The helmet that he wore had a piece of the [[True Cross]] that [[Jesus]] was crucified on. After Constantine was made [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]], he issued the [[Edict of Milan]] (313), sending his mother Helena to find the True Cross and to send back what she found. Helena found the cross and sent three nails that were used in the crucifixion of Jesus back to Rome and her son Constantine.

The helmet that Constantine wore included one of the [[Holy Nails]] that Saint Helena found at the crucifixion site. By making the helmet with one of the nails, it was supposed to protect him from any harm. Not only was it a sign of protection, but it was also said to fulfill the prophecy of [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]].&lt;ref name=various /&gt; The prophecy located in the fourteenth chapter of the [[Book of Zechariah]] said that one would come who engraved “Holiness to the Lord” on both the bells of the horses and head piece of the man.&lt;ref name=various /&gt; At this time, the [[Roman emperor]] had the holiest relics known to man.&lt;ref name=various /&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2016}}

A rare silver [[medallion]] of 315 shows Constantine with a [[chi-rho]] symbol as the crest of his helmet, and [[Eusebius]]' ''[[Life of Constantine]]'' records that he often wore such a helmet in later life, although it is not visible in other bronze coins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constantinethegreatcoins.com/ Constantine the Great coins], thesis, pp. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine was very aware of this, and let the entire [[Roman Empire]] know that he was the owner of this holy helmet. The emperor had coins made with the image of him wearing his helmet on the front. On every VLLP coin that was made, Constantine was shown wearing his helmet. This was one way that Constantine moved the Roman Empire away from the [[Religion in ancient Rome|pagan religion]] and towards [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=coins /&gt; The coins that were made after Constantine acquired his helmet showed that the nail was not the only thing that made his helmet religious. Constantine also had the [[Christogram]] inscribed on the helmet.&lt;ref name=various&gt;''A Dictionary of Christian Antiquities''.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also a few religious symbols that were placed on the helmet. The  Christogram was placed on the helmet, which usually represented the cross, but at times it was interpreted as Jesus [[Christ (title)|Christ]] himself. Another one of these symbols was a [[labarum]] piercing a [[dragon]], a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]]. This was significant because the serpent was represented as the [[Devil]]. But it was also the symbol for any enemy that the Roman Empire had. Constantine’s helmet stood for the strength that the [[Roman Empire]] had through military force, and God. The helmet was put on the coins to let everyone know of this.&lt;ref name=coins&gt;[http://www.constantinethegreatcoins.com/ Constantine the Great coins]&lt;/ref&gt;
Constantine’s helmet was mainly a crown that was fastened to the head by two clamps. The majority of the helmet was made out of iron and gold.&lt;ref name=various /&gt; Constantine thought having the chi-roh symbol on the helmet would give him added protection to that of the relic that was already in the helmet.&lt;ref name=Alfoldi&gt;[[Andreas Alfoldi]], ''The Helmet of Constantine With the Christian Monogram''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The crown that was made with the nail was placed around a full helmet when the Emperor went into battle, but could easily be taken off.&lt;ref name=Alfoldi /&gt; It was called a helmet however he wore it though. This is because of the two clamps that held it in place. If these two clamps were not on the original crown it would not be called a helmet at all.&lt;ref name=Alfoldi /&gt; --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2134">'''Hitaveita Suðurnesja''' was an Icelandic energy company. The largest shareholder was [[Reykjanesbær]]. The company was founded as a geothermal energy firm in the southwest of Iceland in 1974. It built a power plant at [[Svartsengi]] to tap the geothermal energy in the area,&lt;ref name="Development1993"&gt;{{cite book|title=Science, Technology and Innovation Policies: Iceland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IrzaAAAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|isbn=978-92-64-13947-3|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was completed in 1976. It was reportedly the first power plant in the world of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nordic-Baltic-U.S. Almanac|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=100UAQAAMAAJ|year=2006|publisher=Nordic-Baltic-U.S. Almanac, Inc.|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; It produced and distributed heating and electricity for the entire [[Sudurnes]] region.&lt;ref name="NoStaff2007"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Europa World Year Book: 2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BR8eTxcLZuoC|date=6 September 2007|publisher=Europa Publications, Routledge|isbn=978-1-85743-413-2|page=2178}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 2008, Parliament passed Act no. 58/2008, amending some laws on natural resources and energy.

'''Imbibition''' is a special type of diffusion when water is absorbed by solids-[[Colloid|colloids]] causing an enormous increase in volume. Examples include the absorption of water by seeds&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://openagricola.nal.usda.gov/Record/IND89001759|title=Soybean seed imbibition: water absorption by seed parts.|website=openagricola.nal.usda.gov|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dry wood. If it were not for the pressure due to imbibition, seedlings would not have been able to emerge out of soil into the open; they probably would not have been able to establish.

Imbibition is also diffusion since water surface potential movement is along a concentration gradient; the seeds and other such materials have almost no water hence they absorb water easily. Water potential gradient between the absorbent and the liquid imbibed is essential for imbibition. In addition, for any substance to imbibe any liquid, affinity between the adsorbant and the liquid is also a prerequisite.

Imbibition occurs when a wetting fluid displaces a non-wetting fluid, contrary to drainage where a non-wetting phase displaces the wetting fluid. The two processes are governed by different mechanisms.

One example of imbibition that is found in nature is the [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] of water by [[hydrophilic]] [[colloids]].  [[Water_potential#Matrix_potential_.28Matric_potential.29|Matrix potential]] contributes significantly to water in such substances. Examples of plant material which exhibit imbibition are dry seeds before germination. Imbibition can also entrain the genetic clock that controls circadian rhythms in Arabidopsis thaliana and (probably) other plants. Another example is that of imbibition in the [[Amott test]].

Different types of organic substances have different imbibing capacities. Proteins have a very high imbibing capacity, then starch less and cellulose least. That is why proteinaceous pea seeds swell more on imbibition than starchy wheat seeds.

Imbibition of water increases the volume of the imbibant, which results in imbibitional pressure. This pressure can be of tremendous magnitude. This fact can be demonstrated by the splitting of rocks by inserting dry wooden stalks in the crevices of the rocks and soaking them in water, a technique used by early Egyptians to cleave stone blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/building/building_in_stone.htm | title=Building With Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/jan62006/sesame144058200615.asp | title=The Pyramid Puzzle - Deccan Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Skin graft]]s (split thickness and full thickness) receive oxygenation and nutrition via imbibition, maintaining cellular viability until the processes of [[inosculation]] and [[revascularisation]] have re-established a new blood supply within these tissues.

'''Karlshamn Power Station''' (also known as '''Stärnö Power Station''', {{lang-sv|Karlshamnsverket}}) is an oil-fired [[thermal power station]] on Stärnö peninsula west of [[Karlshamn]]. It has three units each with a generation capacity of 340&amp;nbsp;MW, which went in service in 1969, 1971 and 1973. Each unit has its own {{convert|141|m}} tall [[flue gas stack]].
Unit 1 delivers its power to the 130&amp;nbsp;kV grid, while unit 2 and 3 feed the 400&amp;nbsp;kV grid.  Next to the power station, a converter station of the [[SwePol|SwePol HVDC submarine cable]] is located.

This is a list of  [[protected area]]s in [[Peru]].

==Natural heritage==
[[Image:Punta Sal, Peru.jpg|thumb|right|View of the beach in [[Contralmirante Villar Province|Punta Sal]].]]

The [[Constitution of Peru]] of 1993 recognized the [[natural resources]] and [[ecosystem]] variety of its country as a heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Article 66-69 of the [http://www.tc.gob.pe/legconperu/constitucion.html Constitution of Peru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324043856/http://www.tc.gob.pe/legconperu/constitucion.html |date=2007-03-24 }}, retrieved 17 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, the National System of Natural Areas that are protected by the Government (SINANPE) was created.&lt;ref name="sinanpe"&gt;[http://www.sernanp.gob.pe/sernanp/archivos/biblioteca/mapas/ListaAnps.pdf SINANPE list of protected areas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424120718/http://www.sernanp.gob.pe/sernanp/archivos/biblioteca/mapas/ListaAnps.pdf |date=2012-04-24 }}, retrieved 17 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This entity depends on the National Service of Protected Areas by the State (SERNANP), Ministry of Environment.

Peru has 75 natural protected areas (15.21% of the country surface area&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sernanp.gob.pe/sernanp/contenido.jsp?ID=665 Consolidated table of SINANPE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923061051/http://www.sernanp.gob.pe/sernanp/contenido.jsp?ID=665 |date=2013-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) that are preserved by the National Government: 12 national parks, 9 national sanctuaries, 4 historical sanctuaries, 15 national reserves, 3 wildlife refuges, 2 landscape reserves, 8 communal reserves, 6 protected forests, 2 hunting enclosed lands and 14 reserved zones. A map was also created containing the natural protected areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sernanp.gob.pe/sernanp/bmapas.jsp Map of the protected areas in Peru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616153010/http://www.sernanp.gob.pe/sernanp/bmapas.jsp |date=2012-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peru is considered to be among 17 of the most [[megadiverse countries]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Conservation International, [http://www.conservation.org/xp/news/press_releases/2003/091603_andean_eng.xml ''South America Banks on Regional Strategy to Safeguard Quarter of Earth's Biodiversity''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031004032107/http://www.conservation.org/xp/news/press_releases/2003/091603_andean_eng.xml |date=2003-10-04 }}. Retrieved on June 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; With over 1,700 species of birds, it has the world's second most diverse avian community, after [[Colombia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/468283.html Lambertini, A Naturalist's Guide to the Tropics, excerpt&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2429">'''Lumicera''' is a [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] [[ceramic]] developed by [[Murata Manufacturing|Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd.]] 

[[Murata Manufacturing]] first developed transparent polycrystalline ceramics in February 2001. This [[polycrystalline]] ceramic is a type of [[dielectric resonator]] material commonly used in [[microwave]]s and [[millimeter wave]]s. While offering superior electrical properties, high levels of [[transmittance|transmissivity]], and [[refractive index]], it also has good optical characteristics without [[birefringence]].

Normally, ceramics are opaque because pores are formed at triple points where grains intersect, causing scattering of incident light. [[Murata Manufacturing|Murata]] has optimized the entire development process of making dense and homogenous ceramics to improve their performance.

Under recommendations from [[Casio]], the material itself has been refined for use in digital camera optical lenses by endowing it with improved transmission of short wavelength light and by reducing pores inside ceramics that reduce transparency.

Lumicera has the same light transmitting qualities as optical glass commonly used in today's conventional camera lenses, however it has refractive index (nd = 2.08 at 587 nm[https://web.archive.org/web/20080820100051/http://lvpcug.org/newsletters/down_the_road/2005/March_05.html]) much greater than that of optical glass (nd = 1.5 – 1.85 [http://www.opticiansfriend.com/lenses.html]) and offers superior strength. The Lumicera Z variant is described as [[barium oxide]] based material,[http://www.performance-materials.net/secure/assets/i20060205.651776_43e59e702e6a.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} not containing any environmentally hazardous materials (e.g. [[lead]]). 

Lumicera is transparent up to 10 micrometers, making it useful for instruments operating in mid-[[infrared]] spectrum.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110722073533/http://www.ile.osaka-u.ac.jp/zone1/public/publication/apr/2006/pdf/6/6.22.pdf]

Lumicera is a trademark of Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd.

Lumicera is used in some [[Casio Exilim]] cameras, where it allowed 20% reduction of the lens profile.[http://www.dpreview.com/news/0408/04080401casioceramiclens.asp]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1867">'''Marine energy management''' is the application of systematic methods to measure, register and analyze the energy usage of oceangoing vessels in specific.  

The goal of marine energy management is to 
*''maximize the (electrical or mechanical) energy generated from the minimum amount of [[fossil fuel]]'', and 
*''maximize the useful work obtained from the minimum amount of generated energy''.  The IMO is the international body responsible for code regulation.
These are two separated optimization problems.

Marine energy management can both be applied on board and onshore.  It is a complex problem, due to the number of inter-related energy systems on board vessels, such as the [[Ship#Propulsion systems|propulsion]], the auxiliary engines, refrigeration systems, [[HVAC]], etc.  The weather and sea-state, plus the [[logistics]] involved in transporting goods from one port to another, also have big effects.  

Marine energy management can be addressed on board through measuring devices, monitoring systems and decision-support systems.  It can be addressed onshore through data analysis, leading to change in operation on board.

'''Mulayit Wildlife Sanctuary''' is a small [[protected area]] in [[Kayin State]], [[Burma]]. It is located around [[Mulayit Taung|Mulayit]] mountain in the [[Dawna Range]].

The reserve occupies an area of {{convert|139|km2|sqmi|sigfig=3}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mekonginfo.org/assets/midocs/0002035-environment-biodiversity-and-protected-areas-myanmar.pdf Biodiversity and protected areas - Myanmar]&lt;/ref&gt; and was established in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.protectedplanet.net/sites/Mulayit_Wildlife_Sanctuary Protected Planet - Mulayit Wildlife Sanctuary]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12207">The '''myth of superabundance''' is the belief that [[earth]] has more than sufficient [[natural resources]] to satisfy humanity's needs, and that no matter how much of these resources humanity uses, the planet will continuously replenish the supply.  Although the idea had existed previously among [[conservation movement|conservationist]]s in the 19th century, it was not given a name until [[Stewart Udall]]'s 1964 book ''The Quiet Crisis''.

Udall describes the myth as the belief that there was "so much land, so much water, so much timber, so many birds and beasts"&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;{{rp|22}} that man did not envision a time where the planet would not replenish what had been sowed. The myth of superabundance began to circulate during [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s presidency at the beginning of the nineteenth century and persuaded many Americans to exploit natural resources as they pleased with no thought of long-term consequences.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt; According to historian of the North American west [[George Colpitts]], "No theme became as integral to western promotion as natural abundance."&lt;ref name=Colpitts/&gt;{{rp|104}} Especially with respect to the west after 1890, promotional literature encouraged migration by invoking the idea that God had provided an abundant environment there such that no man or family would fail if they sought to farm or otherwise live off the land out west.&lt;ref name=Colpitts/&gt; Since at that time environmental science and the study of ecology barely allowed for the possibility of animal [[extinction]] and did not provide tools for measuring biomass or the limits of natural resources, many speculators, settlers, and other parties participated in unsustainable practices that led to various extinctions, the [[Dust Bowl]] phenomenon, and other [[environmental catastrophe]]s.

== Early manifestations ==
In 1784, [[John Filson]] wrote ''The Discovery, Settlement And present State of [[Kentucky|Kentucke]]'',&lt;ref name=Filson/&gt; which included the chapter "The Adventures of Colonel [[Daniel Boone|Daniel Boon]]".  This work represents one of the earliest instance of the myth of superabundance, acting as something of a promotional ad enticing settlers to Kentucky based on the abundance of resources to be found there.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;

== Warning signs ==
Udall describes many large-scale impacts on natural resources, terming them "The Big Raid on resources".&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;{{rp|54}} The first was the need for [[logging|lumber]] in a growing nation for [[fuel]], [[housing]] and [[paper]]. Udall states that it was with this first big raid on the earth’s natural resources that the myth of superabundance began to show its fallacy. It was only towards the end of the nineteenth century that people were awakened to the empty hillsides and the vastness of blackened woods from the [[lumber industry]]. [[Petroleum]] followed, as it was widely believed that oil was constantly made inside the earth, and so, like everything else, was inexhaustible. Then came [[seal hunting]], and by 1866 the seal population that originally numbered approximately five million was drastically cut in half.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt; Many of the seals were shot in the water and never recovered, allowing for enormous waste. The [[Fur Seal Treaty]] which came about in 1911 saved the seals from becoming the first major marine species to become extinct thanks to the myth of superabundance.

The [[passenger pigeon]] was the largest wildlife species known to humanity in the early nineteenth century, when the bird's population was estimated at about five billion.  By the early 20th century, due to [[overhunting]] and habitat destruction brought about by the timber industry, the species had become extinct, the last passenger pigeon having died in the Cincinnati Zoo.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; The passenger pigeon became extinct in under a century and was just one of the many victims of the myth of superabundance.{{synthesis inline|date=November 2016}}

Likewise, the [[American bison|American buffalo]] was threatened by the myth of superabundance. They were considered to be the largest and most valuable resource because just about every piece of them was usable. The big kill of the buffalo began at the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] when armies wanted the animals killed in order to starve out the [[Plains Indians]]. Railroad men wanted them killed in order to supply heavier and profitable loads of hides. Buffalo were killed for their tongues and hides, and some hunters simply wanted them as trophies. Pleas of protection for the buffalo were ignored, nearly wiping out the species.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;

The [[Great Leap Forward]] in [[China]] in 1958 corresponded closely with the myth of superabundance;{{synthesis inline|date=November 2016}} economic planners reduced the acreage space for planting wheat and grains, trying to force farmers and agricultural labourers into accepting new forms of [[industry]]. As a result, production of wheat and grain was slowed dangerously, and floods in [[Southern China|the South]] and droughts in the North struck in 1959, leading China into the record-breaking [[Great Chinese Famine]].&lt;ref name=Mokyr/&gt;

== The myth exposed ==
[[George Perkins Marsh]], who wrote ''[[Man and Nature]]'' in 1864, rejected the idea that any resource could be exploited without any concerns for the future. Perkins was a witness to natural destruction; he saw that mistakes of the past were destroying the present prosperity. He believed that nature should be second nature to all and should not be used as an exploitation for economics and politics. He was, after all, "forest born".&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;{{rp|72}} Man's role as a catalyst of change in the natural world intrigued him. He believed that progress was entirely possible and necessary, if only men used wisdom in the management of resources. He deflated, but did not destroy the myth of superabundance. He began the spin into doubt,&lt;ref name=Marsh/&gt; which made way for [[John Muir]] in 1874. Muir, who had grown up surrounded by wilderness, believed that wildlife and nature could provide people with heightened sense abilities and experiences of awe that could be found nowhere else.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt; Entering into civilization with a desire to see preservation of some of what he believed to be America’s most beautiful nature, he built upon steps that had been taken by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], a young landscape architect who designed [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]]. Olmsted had persuaded [[United States Congress|Congress]] to pass a bill preserving much of [[Yosemite Valley]], which [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]] had then approved in 1864. In 1872 [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Grant]] signed the Yellowstone Park bill, saving over two million acres of wildlife.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;

== Early successes ==
Muir saw [[overgrazing]] destruction in Yosemite, in parts of it that were not under protection. It was a result of nearby [[Sheep husbandry|sheepmen]] and their herds.&lt;ref group=Notes&gt;Overgrazing would later spark a feud of conflicting beliefs between Muir and Glifford Pinchot, the Department of Agriculture’s Chief Forester, who were actually friends. They clashed over sheep-grazing practices, because Pinchot believed that controlled grazing was useful in the forest preserves, but Muir believed that it was a bad practice to use at all. Pinchot is known to have later rescinded his argument, saying that Muir was indeed, right.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, Muir wrote an article "God’s First Temples – How Shall We Preserve Our Forests", which he published in the newspaper, pleading for help with protection of the forests. At first he failed against the overriding ideal of the myth of superabundance, but he did inspire bills in the 1880s that sought to enlarge Yosemite’s reservation. Muir formed the [[Sierra Club]], a group of mountaineers and conservationists like him who had responded to his many articles. The Sierra Club’s first big fight came as a counter-attack on lumbermen and [[Cowboy|stockmen]] who wanted to monopolize some of Yosemite County. Yosemite Valley, which was still owned by the state, was mismanaged and natural reserves like the meadows and Mirror Lake, which was dammed for irrigation, were still being destroyed even under supposed protection.  In 1895, Muir and the Sierra Club began a battle that would span over ten years, fighting for natural management of Yosemite Valley. [[Theodore Roosevelt]] met with Muir in 1903 and was instantly fascinated with Muir’s passion for the wilderness. Roosevelt approved Muir’s argument for Yosemite Valley, and so the Sierra Club took their decade long campaign to Sacramento, where they finally won against California legislature in 1905. With Roosevelt on Muir’s side, Yosemite Valley finally became part of the Yosemite National Park and was allowed natural management.

== Moving backwards ==
Udall asserts that the myth of superabundance, once exposed, was replaced in the 20th century by the ''myth of scientific supremacy'': the belief that science can eventually find a solution to any problem.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;{{rp|178}}  This leads to behaviors which, while recognizing that resources are not infinite, still fail to properly preserve those resources, putting the problem off to future generations to solve through science.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt; "Present the repair bill to the next generation" is their silent motto.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;{{rp|178}} George Perkins Marsh had said that conservation's greatest enemies were "greed and shortsightedness".&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;{{rp|178}} Men reach a power trip thinking they can manipulate nature the way that they want.

== Next steps ==
In order for man to live harmoniously with nature, as Muir and Perkins and many others have fought for, Patsy Hallen in the article, "The Art of Impurity" says that an ethics development must occur in which respect for nature and our radical dependency on it can take place. Humans see themselves as superior to nature, and yet we are in a constant state of continuity with it. Hallen argues that humanity cannot afford such an irrational state of mind and ecological denial if it expects to prosper in the future.&lt;ref name=Hallen/&gt;

An '''oak woodland''' is a [[plant community]] with a tree [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] dominated by [[oak]]s (''Quercus spp.''). In terms of [[Crown closure|canopy closure]], oak woodlands are intermediate between [[oak savanna]], which is more open, and [[oak forest]], which is more closed.&lt;ref name="widnr"&gt;{{cite web |title=Oak Woodland - Wisconsin DNR |url=https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/endangeredresources/communities.asp?mode=detail&amp;Code=CTFOR010WI |website=dnr.wi.gov |publisher=Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the community is named for the dominance of oak trees, the [[understory]] vegetation is often diverse and includes many species of grasses, sedges, forbs, ferns, shrubs, and other plants. 

==Examples==
* Upper [[Midwestern United States]] oak woodlands dominated by white oak (''[[Quercus alba]]''), burr oak (''[[Quercus macrocarpa|Q. macrocarpa]]''), and black oak (''[[Quercus velutina|Q. velutina]]''), with subdominant canopy species red oak (''[[Quercus rubra|Q. rubra]]'') and shagbark hickory (''[[Carya ovata]]''), with a diverse understory. The community is fire-dependent, shaped by annual, low-intensity fires.&lt;ref name="widnr"/&gt;
* Cork oak (''[[Quercus suber]]'') woodlands in the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean region]].
* Blue oak woodland is found in the inner coast ranges and the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] foothills in [[California]], surrounding the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;C.

In physics, '''power''' is the rate of doing [[Work (physics)|work]] or transferring [[heat]], the amount of [[energy (physics)|energy]] transferred or converted per unit time.  Having no direction, it is a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity.  In the [[International System of Units]], the unit of power is the [[joule]] per [[second]] (J/s), known as the [[watt]] in honour of [[James Watt]], the eighteenth-century developer of the [[Watt steam engine|steam engine condenser]].  Another common and traditional measure is [[horsepower]] (comparing to the power of a horse).  Being the rate of work, the equation for power can be written:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{power}=\frac{\text{work}}{\text{time}}&lt;/math&gt;

As a physical concept, power requires both a change in the physical system and a specified time in which the change occurs. This is distinct from the concept of work, which is only measured in terms of a net change in the state of the physical system. The same amount of work is done when carrying a load up a flight of stairs whether the person carrying it walks or runs, but more power is needed for running because the work is done in a shorter amount of time. 

The output power of an electric motor is the product of the [[torque]] that the motor generates and the [[angular velocity]] of its output shaft. The power involved in moving a vehicle is the product of the traction force of the wheels and the velocity of the vehicle. The rate at which a light bulb converts electrical energy into light and heat is measured in watts&amp;mdash;the higher the wattage, the more power, or equivalently the more electrical energy is used per unit time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter= 6. Power|authors= Halliday and Resnick|title=Fundamentals of Physics|year= 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 13, &amp;sect; 3, pp 13-2,3 ''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'' Volume I, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

==Units==
The dimension of power is energy divided by time. The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of power is the [[watt]] (W), which is equal to one [[joule]] per second. Other units of power include [[erg]]s per second (erg/s), [[horsepower]] (hp), [[horsepower#PS|metric horsepower]] (Pferdestärke (PS) or cheval vapeur (CV)), and [[foot-pound force|foot-pounds]] per minute. One horsepower is equivalent to 33,000 [[Foot-pound (energy)|foot-pound]]s per minute, or the power required to lift 550 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] by one foot in one second, and is equivalent to about 746 watts. Other units include [[dBm]], a relative logarithmic measure with 1 milliwatt as reference; food [[calorie]]s per hour (often referred to as kilocalories per hour); [[BTU]] per hour (BTU/h); and [[refrigeration ton|tons of refrigeration]] (12,000 BTU/h).

== Equations for power==
Power, as a function of time, is the rate at which work is done, so can be expressed by this equation:

:&lt;math&gt;P =\frac{dW}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P'' is power, ''W'' is work, and ''t'' is time. Because work is a [[force]] '''F''' applied over a [[distance]] '''r''',
:&lt;math&gt;W = \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;

for a constant force, power can be rewritten as:
:&lt;math&gt;P =\frac{dW}{dt}= \frac{d}{dt}\left(\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{r}\right)= \mathbf{F}\cdot \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} = \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf {v}&lt;/math&gt;

==Average power==
As a simple example, burning one kilogram of [[coal]] releases much more energy than does detonating a kilogram of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]],&lt;ref&gt;Burning coal produces around 15-30 [[megajoule]]s per kilogram, while detonating TNT produces about 4.7 megajoules per kilogram. For the coal value, see {{cite web | last = Fisher | first = Juliya | title = Energy Density of Coal | work = The Physics Factbook | url = http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/JuliyaFisher.shtml|year=2003|accessdate =30 May 2011}} For the TNT value, see the article [[TNT equivalent]]. Neither value includes the weight of oxygen from the air used during combustion.&lt;/ref&gt; but because the TNT reaction releases energy much more quickly, it delivers far more power than the coal.
If Δ''W''  is the amount of [[mechanical work|work]] performed during a period of [[time]] of duration Δ''t'', the '''average power''' ''P''&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt; over that period is given by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;
P_\mathrm{avg} = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}\,.
&lt;/math&gt;
It is the average amount of work done or energy converted per unit of time. The average power  is often simply called "power" when the context makes it clear.

The '''instantaneous power''' is then the limiting value of the average power as the time interval Δ''t'' approaches zero.
:&lt;math&gt;
P = \lim _{\Delta t\rightarrow 0} P_\mathrm{avg} = \lim _{\Delta t\rightarrow 0} \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t} =  \frac{\mathrm{d}W}{\mathrm{d}t}\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of constant power ''P'', the amount of work performed during a period of duration ''T'' is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
W = Pt\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

In the context of energy conversion, it is more customary to use the symbol ''E'' rather than ''W''.

==Mechanical power==
[[File:Horsepower plain.svg|thumb|One ''metric horsepower'' is needed to lift 75&amp;nbsp;[[:en:Kilogram|kilograms]] by 1&amp;nbsp;[[meter]] in 1&amp;nbsp;[[second]].]]
Power in mechanical systems is the combination of forces and movement. In particular, power is the product of a force on an object and the object's velocity, or the product of a torque on a shaft and the shaft's angular velocity.

Mechanical power is also described as the time derivative of work.  In [[mechanics]], the [[mechanical work|work]] done by a force '''F''' on an object that travels along a curve ''C'' is given by the [[line integral]]:
: &lt;math&gt;W_C = \int_{C}\mathbf{F}\cdot \mathbf{v}\,\mathrm{d}t =\int_{C} \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{x},&lt;/math&gt;
where '''x''' defines the path ''C'' and '''v''' is the velocity along this path.

If the force '''F''' is derivable from a potential ([[Conservative force|conservative]]), then applying the [[gradient theorem]] (and remembering that force is the negative of the [[gradient]] of the potential energy) yields:

:&lt;math&gt;W_C = U(B)-U(A),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' and ''B'' are the beginning and end of the path along which the work was done.

The power at any point along the curve ''C'' is the time derivative

:&lt;math&gt;P(t) = \frac{\mathrm{d}W}{\mathrm{d}t}=\mathbf{F}\cdot \mathbf{v}=-\frac{\mathrm{d}U}{\mathrm{d}t}.&lt;/math&gt;

In one dimension, this can be simplified to:

:&lt;math&gt;P(t) = F\cdot v.&lt;/math&gt;

In rotational systems, power is the product of the [[torque]] &lt;var&gt;τ&lt;/var&gt; and [[angular velocity]] &lt;var&gt;ω&lt;/var&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;P(t) = \boldsymbol{\tau} \cdot \boldsymbol{\omega}, \,&lt;/math&gt;
where '''ω''' measured in radians per second.  The &lt;math&gt; \cdot &lt;/math&gt; represents [[scalar product]].

In fluid power systems such as hydraulic actuators, power is given by
:&lt;math&gt; P(t) = pQ, \!&lt;/math&gt;
where ''p'' is [[pressure]] in [[pascal (unit)|pascals]], or N/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''Q'' is [[volumetric flow rate]] in m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s in SI units.

===Mechanical advantage===
If a mechanical system has no losses, then the input power must equal the output power. This provides a simple formula for the [[mechanical advantage]] of the system.

Let the input power to a device be a force ''F&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' acting on a point that moves with velocity ''v&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the output power be a force ''F&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' acts on a point that moves with velocity ''v&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''.  If there are no losses in the system, then
:&lt;math&gt;P = F_B v_B = F_A v_A, \!&lt;/math&gt;
and the [[mechanical advantage]] of the system (output force per input force) is given by
: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{MA} = \frac{F_B}{F_A} = \frac{v_A}{v_B}. &lt;/math&gt;

The similar relationship is obtained for rotating systems, where ''T&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''ω&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the torque and angular velocity of the input and  ''T&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''ω&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the torque and angular velocity of the output.  If there are no losses in the system, then
:&lt;math&gt;P = T_A \omega_A = T_B \omega_B, \!&lt;/math&gt;
which yields the [[mechanical advantage]]
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{MA} = \frac{T_B}{T_A} = \frac{\omega_A}{\omega_B}.&lt;/math&gt;

These relations are important because they define the maximum performance of a device in terms of [[velocity ratio]]s determined by its physical dimensions.  See for example [[gear ratio]]s.

==Electrical power==
[[File:Ansel Adams - National Archives 79-AAB-02.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Ansel Adams photograph of electrical wires of the Boulder Dam Power Units|[[Ansel Adams]] photograph of electrical wires of the Boulder Dam Power Units, 1941–1942]]
{{main|Electric power}}
The instantaneous electrical power ''P'' delivered to a component is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
P(t) = I(t) \cdot V(t) \,
&lt;/math&gt;

where 
:''P''(''t'') is the instantaneous power, measured in [[watt]]s ([[joule]]s per [[second]])
:''V''(''t'') is the [[potential difference]] (or voltage drop) across the component, measured in [[volt]]s
:''I''(''t'') is the [[Electric current|current]] through it, measured in [[ampere]]s

If the component is a [[resistor]] with time-invariant [[voltage]] to [[electric current|current]] ratio, then:
:&lt;math&gt;
P=I \cdot V = I^2 \cdot R = \frac{V^2}{R} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;
R = \frac{V}{I} \,
&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[electrical resistance|resistance]], measured in [[ohm]]s.

==Peak power and duty cycle==
[[File:peak-power-average-power-tau-T.png|thumb|right|In a train of identical pulses, the instantaneous power is a periodic function of time. The ratio of the pulse duration to the period is equal to the ratio of the average power to the peak power. It is also called the duty cycle (see text for definitions).]]

In the case of a periodic signal &lt;math&gt;s(t)&lt;/math&gt; of period &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, like a train of identical pulses, the instantaneous power &lt;math&gt;p(t) = |s(t)|^2&lt;/math&gt; is also a periodic function of period &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.  The ''peak power'' is simply defined by:
:&lt;math&gt;
P_0 = \max [p(t)]
&lt;/math&gt;.

The peak power is not always readily measurable, however, and the measurement of the average power &lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{avg}&lt;/math&gt; is more commonly performed by an instrument.  If one defines the energy per pulse as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\epsilon_\mathrm{pulse} = \int_{0}^{T}p(t) \mathrm{d}t \,
&lt;/math&gt;
then the average power is:
:&lt;math&gt;
P_\mathrm{avg} = \frac{1}{T} \int_{0}^{T}p(t) \mathrm{d}t = \frac{\epsilon_\mathrm{pulse}}{T} \,
&lt;/math&gt;.

One may define the pulse length &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;P_0\tau = \epsilon_\mathrm{pulse}&lt;/math&gt; so that the ratios
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{P_\mathrm{avg}}{P_0} = \frac{\tau}{T} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

are equal. These ratios are called the ''duty cycle'' of the pulse train.

==Radiant power==
Power is related to intensity at a distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;; the power emitted by a source can be written as:{{citation-needed|date=August 2017}}

:&lt;math&gt;P(r) = I(4\pi r^2) &lt;/math&gt;

The '''Power of Siberia''' ({{lang-ru|Сила Сибири}}) pipeline (formerly known as '''Yakutia–Khabarovsk–Vladivostok pipeline''') is a natural gas pipeline under construction in Eastern Siberia to transport Yakutia's gas to [[Primorsky Krai]] and Far East countries.

==History==
On 29 October 2012 president [[Vladimir Putin]] instructed the general manager of Gazprom to start the construction of the pipeline.&lt;ref name=interfax291012/&gt;  On 21 May 2014, Russia and China signed a 30-year gas deal which was needed to make the project feasible.  Construction was launched on 1 September 2014 in [[Yakutsk]] by president Putin and Chinese deputy premier minister [[Zhang Gaoli]].&lt;ref name=rfe010914&gt;

Although seldom shared under this name, one of the largest groups of [[composite materials]] worldwide is that of the '''reinforced rubber''' products. Familiar examples are automobile [[tyres]], hoses and conveyor belts.

[[File:Reinforced Rubber.jpg|thumb|''Photo of fibre reinforcement structure on complex shaped rubber products by TANIQ'']]

==Composite reinforced structure==
Reinforced rubber products combine a [[rubber]] matrix and a reinforcing material, so high strength to flexibility ratios can be achieved. The reinforcing material, usually a kind of [[fibre]], provides the strength and stiffness. The rubber matrix, with low strength and stiffness, provides air-fluid tightness and supports the reinforcing materials to maintain their relative positions. These positions are of great importance because they influence the resulting mechanical properties.

==Optimal loading condition==
A composite structure where all fibres are loaded equally everywhere when pressurized, is called an isotropic structure and the type of loading is named an isotensoidal loading. To meet the isotensoidal concept the structure geometry must have an isotensoid meridian profile and the fibres must be positioned following geodesic paths. A [[geodesic]] path connects two arbitrary points on a continuous surface by means of the shortest possible way.

==Straight rubber hoses==
[[File:Magic angle.jpg|thumb|Fibre reinforced straight hose with a 54.7 degrees reinforcement angle.]]

[[File:Series of Tubes.JPG|thumb|Reinforced straight hoses]]
To achieve optimal loading in a straight rubber [[hose]] the fibres must be positioned under an angle of approximately 54.7 angular degrees, also referred to as the [[magic angle]]. The magic angle of 54.7 exactly balances the internal-pressure-induced longitudinal stress and the hoop (circumferential) stress, as observed in most biological pressurized fiber-wound cylinders, like arteries. If the fiber angle is initially above or below 54.7, it will change under increased internal pressure until it rises to the magic angle where hoop stresses and longitudinal stresses equalize, with concomitant accommodations in hose diameter and hose length. A hose with an initially low fiber angle will rise under pressure to 54.7, inducing a hose diameter increase and a length decrease, whereas a hose with an initially high fiber angle will drop to 54.7, inducing a hose diameter decrease and a length increase. The equilibrium state is a fiber angle of 54.7. In this situation the fibres tend to be loaded purely in tension, so ~100% of their strength resists the forces acting on the hose due to the internal pressure. (The magic angle for cylindrical shapes of 54.7 angular degrees is based on calculations in which the influence of the matrix material is neglected. Therefore, depending on the stiffness of the rubber material used, the actual equilibrium angle can vary a few tenths of degrees from the magic angle.){{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

When the fibres of the reinforcement structure are placed under angles larger than 54.7 angular degrees, the fibres want to relocate to their optimal path when pressurized. This means that the fibres will re-orient themselves until they have reached their force equilibrium. In this case this will lead to an increase in length and a decrease in diameter. With angles smaller than 54.7 degrees the opposite will occur. A product which makes use of this principle is a pneumatic muscle.

==Reinforcement of complex shaped rubber products==

[[Image:Flanged Rubber Bellows.jpg|thumb|Single-bellows rubber expansion joint reinforced with fabric ply.]]

For a cylinder with a constant diameter the reinforcement angle is constant as well and is 54.7º. This also known as the magic angle or neutral angle. The neutral angle is the angle where a wound structure is in equilibrium. For a cylinder this is 54.7º, but for a more complex shape like a bellows which has a varying radius over the length of the product, this neutral angle is different for each radius. In other words, for complex shapes there is not one magic angle but the fibres follow a geodesic path with angles varying with the change in radius. To obtain a reinforcement structure with isotensoidal loading the geometry of the complex shape must follow an isotensoid meridian profile.

==Reinforcement application technology==
The mil fabric reinforcement can be applied on the rubber products with different processes. For straight hoses the most used processes are braiding, spiralling, knitting and wrapping. The first three processes have in common that multiple strands of fibres are applied to the product simultaneously on a predetermined pattern in an automated process. The fourth process comprises manual or semi-automated wrapping of rubber sheets reinforced with fabric plies. For the reinforcement of complex shaped rubber products like bellows most manufacturers use these fabric reinforced rubber sheets. These sheets are made by calendering of rubber onto pre-woven fabric plies. The products are manufactured by wrapping (mostly manually) these sheets around a mandrel until enough rubber and reinforcement is applied. However, the disadvantage of using these sheets is that it is impossible to control the positioning of the individual fibres of the fabric when applied on complex shapes. Therefore, no geodesic paths can be achieved and therefore also no isotensoid loading is possible. To obtain isotensoide loading on a complex shape, the shape must have an isotensoideal profile and geodesic positioning of the fibre structure is required. This can be achieved by using automated winding processes like filament winding or spiralling.

[[File:Bore Stroke Ratio Animation.gif|thumb|Bore/Stroke Animation]]
In a [[reciprocating engine|reciprocating piston engine]], the '''stroke ratio''', defined by either '''bore/stroke ratio''' or '''stroke/bore ratio''', is a term to describe the ratio between [[bore (engine)|cylinder bore]] diameter and [[piston]] [[stroke (engine)|stroke]].  This can be used for either an [[internal combustion engine]], where the fuel is burned within the cylinders of the engine, or [[external combustion engine]], such as a [[steam engine]], where the combustion of the fuel takes place ''outside'' the working cylinders of the engine.

A fairly comprehensive yet understandable study of stroke/bore effects was published in ''Horseless Age'', 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ingram|first1=Edward|title=As to the Matter of Stroke|journal=Horseless Age|date=April 1916|volume=37|issue=6 &amp; 7|pages=275, 325|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVTmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA275&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 November 2015|ref=WA-37-Stroke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conventions==
In a [[piston engine]], there are two different ways of describing the ''stroke ratio'' of its [[cylinder (engine)|cylinders]], namely: ''bore/stroke'' ratio, and ''stroke/bore'' ratio.

===Bore/stroke ratio===
'''Bore/stroke''' is the more commonly used term, with usage in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Asia]], and [[Australia]].

The diameter of the [[bore (engine)|cylinder bore]] is divided by the length of the [[piston]] [[stroke (engine)|stroke]] to give the ratio.

==Square, oversquare and undersquare engines==
The following terms describe the naming conventions for the configurations of the various bore/stroke ratio:

===Square engine===
A '''square engine''' has equal bore ''and'' stroke dimensions, giving a bore/stroke value of exactly 1:1.

====Square engine examples====

The [[Volkswagen Group]]'s 2005 [[list of Volkswagen Group petrol engines#W16|W16 engine]] as used in the [[Bugatti Veyron]] also using a {{convert|86.0 x 86.0|mm|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke.

The [[Peugeot]] [[Peugeot|XU10]] engine line – with a displacement of 1998 cubic centimeters – is an example of a perfect square engine with an {{convert|86.0x86.0|mm|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke.

Honda's J30A engine has an {{convert|86.0 x 86.0|mm|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke.

===Oversquare or short-stroke engine===
An engine is described as '''oversquare''' or '''short-stroke''' if its cylinders have a greater bore diameter than its stroke length, giving a bore/stroke ratio greater than 1:1.

An oversquare engine allows for more and larger valves in the head of the cylinder, higher possible rpm by lowering maximum piston ring speed and lower crank stress due to the lower peak piston acceleration for the same engine speed. Due to the increased piston and head surface area, the heat loss increases as the bore/stroke ratio is increased. Thus an excessively high ratio can lead to a decreased thermal efficiency compared to other engine geometries. Because these characteristics favor higher engine speeds, oversquare engines are often tuned to develop peak torque at a relatively high speed. The large size/width of the combustion chamber at ignition can cause increased inhomogeneity in the air/fuel mixture during combustion, resulting in higher emissions.

The reduced stroke length allows for a shorter cylinder and sometimes a shorter connecting rod, generally making oversquare engines less tall  but wider than undersquare engines of similar [[engine displacement]].

====Oversquare engine examples====
Oversquare engines (a.k.a. "short stroke engines") are very common, as they allow higher [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] (and thus more power), without excessive piston speed.

Examples include both Chevrolet and Ford small-block V8s. The [[BMW N45]] gasoline engine has a bore/stroke ratio of 1.167.

[[Flat engine|Horizontally opposed, also known as "Boxer" or "flat", engines]] typically feature oversquare designs since any increase in stroke length would result in twice the increase in overall engine width.  This is particularly so in [[Subaru]]’s front-engine layout, where the steering angle of the front wheels is constrained by the width of the engine. Although oversquare engines have a reputation for being high-strung, {{citation needed|date=July 2012}} low-torque machines, the [[Subaru EJ engine|Subaru EJ181 engine]] develops peak torque at speeds as low as 3200 rpm.

Nissan's [[Nissan SR engine#SR16VE|SR16VE]] engine found in [[Nissan Pulsar]] VZ-R and VZ-R N1 is an oversquare engine with {{convert|86|mm|in|2}} bore and {{convert|68.7|mm|in|2}} stroke, giving it an impressive {{convert|175|-|200|hp|kW|-1}} but relatively small torque of {{convert|119|-|134|lbft|Nm kgm}}

Extreme oversquare engines are found in [[Formula One]] racing cars, where strict rules limit displacement, thereby necessitating that power be achieved through high engine speeds. Stroke ratios approaching 2.5:1 are allowed,{{efn|There is no actual restriction on bore:stroke ratio, but cylinder bores are limited to {{convert|98|mm|in|2|disp=or}} and capacity to {{convert|2400|cm3|cuin}}.}} enabling engine speeds of 18,000 rpm while remaining reliable for multiple races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011F1 Technical Regulations|url=http://argent.fia.com/web/fia-public.nsf/2B2B158DE64879C7C12578C0004B1DF6/$FILE/2011_F1__TECHNICAL_REGULATIONS_30-06-2011.pdf|publisher=FIA|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ducati 1199|Ducati Panigale]] [[motorcycle engine]] is massively oversquare with a bore/stroke ratio of 1.84:1. It was given the name "SuperQuadro" by [[Ducati]], roughly translated as "super-square" from Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1199panigale.ducati.com/en/#|title=Ducati 1199 Panigale - Ducati|author=|date=|website=www.1199panigale.ducati.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[side-valve]] Belgian [[D-Motor LF26]] [[aircraft engine|aero-engine]] has a bore/stroke ratio of 1.4:1.&lt;ref&gt;http://d-motor1.vpweb.be/Price---product-specifications.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Mercedes-Benz M116 engines had a {{convert|92|mm|in|2}} bore and a {{convert|65.6|mm|in|2}} stroke for a 3.5 litre V8.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/mercedes_350SL_technical_specifications.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|undersquare}}Undersquare or long-stroke engine===
An engine is described as '''undersquare''' or '''long-stroke''' if its cylinders have a smaller bore (width, diameter) than its stroke (length of piston travel)  - giving a ratio value of less than 1:1.

At a given engine speed, a longer stroke increases engine friction and increases stress on the crankshaft due to the higher peak piston acceleration. The smaller bore also reduces the area available for valves in the cylinder head, requiring them to be smaller or fewer in number.

Undersquare engines exhibit peak torque at lower rpm than an oversquare engine due to their longer crank throw and high piston speed.

Undersquare engines have become more common lately, as manufacturers push for more and more efficient engines and higher fuel economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=https://newsroom.toyota.co.jp/en/powertrain2018/engine/|title=2.0-liter Dynamic Force Engine, a New 2.0-liter Direct-injection, Inline 4-cylinder Gasoline Engine |publisher=Toyota |location=Japan |date=26 February 2018 |access-date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Undersquare engines have a higher volume/surface area ratio, leading to reduced heat loss and higher BSFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/why-0-5-liter-cylinders-will-soon-dominate-automotive-engine-design |title=Why 0.5-Liter Cylinders Will Soon Dominate Automotive-Engine Design |first=Don |last=Sherman |work=Car and Driver |date=27 January 2015 |access-date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Undersquare engine examples====
Many inline engines, particularly those mounted transversely in front-wheel-drive cars, utilize an undersquare design. The smaller bore allows for a shorter engine that increases room available for the front wheels to steer. Examples of this include many [[list of Volkswagen Group petrol engines|Volkswagen]], [[list of Nissan engines|Nissan]], [[list of Honda engines|Honda]], and [[list of Mazda engines|Mazda]] engines. The [[Toyota KR engine#1KR-FE|1KR-FE]]-engine used in the [[Toyota Aygo]], [[Citroën C1]] and [[Peugeot 107]] amongst others is an example of a modern long-stroke engine widely used in [[FF layout]] cars. This engine has a 71&amp;nbsp;mm bore and 84&amp;nbsp;mm stroke giving it a bore/stroke ratio of 0.845:1. Some rear-wheel-drive cars that borrow engines from front-wheel-drive cars (such as the [[Mazda MX-5]]) use an undersquare design.
.

BMW's acclaimed [[BMW M54#S54B32|S54B32]] engine was undersquare ({{convert|91|mm|2}} vs {{convert|87|mm|2}} bore), offering a world record torque-per-litre figure ({{cvt|114|Nm/L|lbft/USgal|disp=comma}}) for normally-aspirated production engines at the time; this record stood until Ferrari unveiled the [[458 Italia]].

Many [[United Kingdom|British]] automobile companies used undersquare designs until the 1950s, largely because of a motor tax system that [[RAC horsepower|taxed cars by their cylinder bore]].  This includes the [[BMC A-Series engine]], and many [[Nissan]] derivatives. The [[Trojan (automobile)|Trojan Car]] used an undersquare, [[split-single|split piston]], [[two stroke]], two cylinder in line engine; this was partly for this tax advantage and partly because its proportions allowed flexing V-shaped connecting rods for the two pistons of each U-shaped cylinder, which was cheaper and simpler than two connecting rods joined with an additional bearing.

The  225&amp;nbsp;cu in (3.7&amp;nbsp;[[litre]]) [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine]] is undersquare, with a {{convert|86|mm|2}} bore and a {{convert|105|mm|2}} stroke (bore/stroke ratio = 0.819:1).

The Ford [[Ford Modular engine#5.4.C2.A0L|5.4L Modular Engine]] features a cylinder bore of 90.1&amp;nbsp;mm (3.552&amp;nbsp;in) and a stroke of 105.8&amp;nbsp;mm (4.165&amp;nbsp;in), which makes a bore/stroke ratio of 0.852:1. Since the stroke is significantly longer than the bore, the SOHC 16V (2-valve per cylinder) version of this engine is able to generate a peak torque of 350&amp;nbsp;lb·ft as low as 2501&amp;nbsp;rpm.

The Willys Jeep  [[Willys Go Devil engine|L134]] and [[Willys Hurricane engine|F134]] engines were undersquare, with a 79.4&amp;nbsp;mm (3.125&amp;nbsp;in) bore and 111.1&amp;nbsp;mm (4.375&amp;nbsp;in) stroke (bore/stroke ratio = 0.714:1).

The [[Dodge Power Wagon]] used a [[straight-six engine|straight-six]] [[Chrysler Flathead engine]] of 230&amp;nbsp;cu in (3.8&amp;nbsp;l) with a bore of {{convert|83|mm|2}} and a stroke of {{convert|117|mm|2}}, yielding a substantially undersquare bore/stroke ratio of 0.709:1.

The 4-litre [[Ford Barra engine#Straight-six engine|Barra Inline 6]] engine from the Australian [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]], uses a 92.21&amp;nbsp;mm bore and 99.31&amp;nbsp;mm stroke, which equates to a 0.929:1 bore-stroke ratio.

The 292 Chevrolet I6 is also undersquare, with a bore of 3.875 in and a stroke of 4.125 in (bore/stroke ratio = 0.939:1).

Mitsubishi's 4G63T engine found primarily in many generations of [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution]] is an undersquare engine at 85&amp;nbsp;mm bore x 88&amp;nbsp;mm stroke.

Virtually all piston engines used in military aircraft were long-stroke engines. The PW R-2800, Wright R-3350, [[Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major]], Rolls-Royce Merlin (1650), Allison V-1710, and Hispano-Suiza 12Y-Z are only a few of more than a hundred examples.

All diesel-powered ships have massively undersquare marine engines.  A [[Wärtsilä]]  [[Wärtsilä-Sulzer RT-flex96-C|two-stroke marine diesel engine]] has a cylinder bore of 960&amp;nbsp;mm (37.8&amp;nbsp;in) and stroke of 2500&amp;nbsp;mm (98.4&amp;nbsp;in), (bore/stroke ratio = 0.384:1).

While most modern [[motorcycle engine]]s are square or oversquare, some are undersquare.  The [[Kawasaki Z1300]]'s [[straight-six engine]] was made undersquare to minimise engine width, more recently, a new [[straight-twin engine]] for the [[Honda NC700 series]] used an undersquare design to achieve better combustion efficiency in order to reduce fuel consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global 700cc Engine for Next-Generation : Technical details|url=http://world.honda.com/Global-700cc-engine/Tech-details/page05.html|work=Honda Worldwide|publisher=Honda Motor Co|accessdate=25 March 2014|page=5|date=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Garrett|first=Jerry|title=Reality Check From Honda, in Touch With Economics|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/automobiles/autoreviews/reality-check-from-honda-in-touch-with-economics.html|accessdate=25 March 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tacca leontopetaloides''''' is a species of [[flowering plant]] in the [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]] family [[Dioscoreaceae]], that is native to [[Tropics|tropical]] [[Africa]], [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], northern [[Australia]], [[New Guinea]], [[Samoa]], [[Micronesia]], and [[Fiji]].&lt;ref name="GRIN"/&gt;  As an important food source, it was intentionally taken to tropical [[Pacific Islands]] with early [[Canoe plants|human migration]]s.  Common names include '''Polynesian arrowroot''', '''''pia''''' ([[Hawaii]], [[French Polynesia]], [[Niue]], and [[Cook Islands]]), '''''masoa''''' (Samoa), '''''mahoa{{okina}}a''''' ([[Tonga]]), '''''yabia''''' (Fiji) '''''gapgap''''' (Guam) and '''''taka''''' ([[Indonesia]]).&lt;ref name="NTBG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntbg.org/plants/plant_details.php?plantid=10965 |title=Tacca leontopetaloides (Dioscoreaceae) |work=Meet the Plants |publisher=National Tropical Botanical Garden |accessdate=2009-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Several [[Petiole (botany)|petioles]] {{convert|17|-|150|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length extend from the center of the plant, on which the large [[Leaf|leaves]] ({{convert|30|-|70|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} long and up to {{convert|120|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} wide) are attached. The leaf's upper surface has depressed [[Leaf#Veins|veins]], and the under surface is shiny with bold yellow veins.  [[Flower]]s are borne on tall stalks in greenish-purple clusters, with long trailing bracts.  The plant is usually dormant for part of the year and dies down to the ground.  Later, new leaves will arise from the round underground [[tuber]].  The tubers are hard and [[potato]]-like, with a brown skin and white interior.&lt;ref name="NTBG"/&gt;

==Uses==
The tubers of Polynesian arrowroot contain [[starch]], making it an important food source for many [[Pacific Islands|Pacific Island]] cultures, primarily for the inhabitants of low islands and [[atoll]]s.  Polynesian arrowroot was prepared into a [[flour]] to make a variety of [[pudding]]s.  The [[tuber]]s were first grated and then allowed to soak in fresh water.  The settled starch was rinsed repeatedly to remove the bitterness and then dried.  The flour was mixed with mashed [[taro]], [[breadfruit]], or ''[[Pandanus]]'' fruit extract and mixed with [[coconut cream]] to prepare puddings. In [[Hawaii]], a local favorite is [[haupia]], which was originally made with ''pia'' flour, coconut cream and kō ([[Sugarcane|cane sugar]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brennan|2000| pp=252&amp;ndash;267}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, Polynesian arrowroot has been largely replaced by [[cornstarch]].

The starch was additionally used to stiffen fabrics, and on some islands, the [[Plant stem|stem]]'s [[bast fibre]]s were woven into [[mat]]s.

In traditional Hawaiian medicine the raw [[tuber]]s were eaten to treat [[stomach]] ailments.  Mixed with [[water]] and red [[clay]], the plant was consumed to treat [[diarrhea]] and [[dysentery]]. This combination was also used to stop internal hemorrhaging in the [[stomach]] and [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] and applied to wounds to stop bleeding.&lt;ref name="NTBG"/&gt;

[[File:UAL 232 Fan.png|thumbnail|right|The damaged fan disk of the engine that catastrophically failed on [[United Airlines Flight 232]]]] A '''turbine engine failure''' occurs when a [[turbine engine]] in an [[aircraft]] unexpectedly stops producing [[thrust]] or [[Power (physics)|power production]] due to a malfunction other than [[fuel exhaustion]], although the term "turbine engine failure" can also apply to failure of any turbine engine, such as ground-based turbines used in power plants, turbine-engined vessels (i.e. [[Combined diesel and gas|CODAG ]]) and vehicles, etc.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

Turbine engines in use on today's turbine-powered aircraft are very [[reliability (engineering)|reliable]]. Engines operate efficiently with regularly scheduled inspections and maintenance. These units can have lives ranging in the thousands of hours of operation. However, engine malfunctions or failures occasionally occur that require an engine to be shut down in flight. Since multi-engine airplanes are designed to fly with one engine inoperative and flight crews are trained to fly with one engine inoperative, the in-flight shutdown of an engine typically does not constitute a serious safety of flight issue. Following an engine shutdown, a precautionary landing is usually performed with airport [[Fire apparatus#Airport crash tender|fire and rescue equipment]] positioned near the runway. The prompt landing is a precaution against the risk that another engine will fail later in the flight or that the engine failure that has already occurred may have caused or been caused by other as-yet unknown damage or malfunction of aircraft systems (such as fire or damage to aircraft flight controls) that may pose a continuing risk to the flight. Once the airplane lands, fire department personnel assist with inspecting the airplane to ensure it is safe before it [[taxiing|taxis]] to its parking position. [[Turboprop]]-powered aircraft and [[turboshaft]]-powered [[helicopter]]s are also powered by [[Gas turbine|turbine engines]] and are subject to engine failures for many similar reasons as jet-powered aircraft. In the case of an engine failure in a helicopter, it is often possible for the pilot to enter [[autorotation]], using the unpowered rotor to slow the aircraft's descent and provide a measure of control, usually allowing for a safe emergency landing even without engine power.&lt;ref name=FAA&gt;{{cite book

==Shutdowns that are not engine failures==
Most in-flight shutdowns are harmless and likely to go unnoticed by passengers. For example, it may be prudent for the [[flight crew]] to shut down an engine and perform a precautionary landing in the event of a low [[oil pressure]] or high oil temperature warning in the cockpit. However, passengers in a [[Jet engine|jet powered aircraft]] may become quite alarmed by other engine events such as a [[compressor surge]] — a malfunction that is typified by loud bangs and even flames from the engine's inlet and tailpipe. A compressor surge is a disruption of the airflow through a gas turbine jet engine that can be caused by engine deterioration, a crosswind over the engine's inlet, ice accumulation around the engine inlet, ingestion of foreign material, or an internal component failure such as a broken [[turbine|blade]]. While this situation can be alarming, the engine may recover with no damage.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/design_approvals/engine_prop/media/engine_malf_famil.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

Other events that can happen with jet engines, such as a fuel control fault, can result in excess fuel in the engine's [[combustor]]. This additional fuel can result in flames extending from the engine's exhaust pipe. As alarming as this would appear, at no time is the engine itself actually on fire.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

Also, the failure of certain components in the engine may result in a release of oil into [[bleed air]] that can cause an odor or oily mist in the cabin. This is known as a [[fume event]]. The dangers of fume events are the subject of debate in both aviation and [[aviation medicine|medicine]].&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204900904574302293012711628 | title=Up in the Air: New Worries About 'Fume Events' on Planes | publisher=Wall Street Journal | date=30 July 2009 | accessdate=29 December 2012 | author=Sarah Nassauer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible causes==
Engine failures can be caused by mechanical problems in the engine itself, such as damage to portions of the turbine or oil leaks, as well as damage outside the engine such as fuel pump problems or fuel contamination. A turbine engine failure can also be caused by entirely external factors, such as [[volcanic ash]], [[bird strike]]s or weather conditions like [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] or [[Atmospheric icing|icing]]. Weather risks such as these can sometimes be countered through the usage of supplementary ignition or anti-icing systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/design_approvals/engine_prop/media/CAAM2_Report.pdf| title=Technical Report on Propulsion System and APU-Related Aircraft Safety Hazards | publisher=Federal Aviation Administration | accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failures during takeoff==

A turbine-powered aircraft's takeoff procedure is designed around ensuring that an engine failure will not endanger the flight. This is done by planning the takeoff around three critical [[V speeds]], V1, VR and V2. V1 is the critical engine failure recognition speed, the speed at which a takeoff can be continued with an engine failure, and the speed at which stopping distance is no longer guaranteed in the event of a [[rejected takeoff]]. VR is the speed at which the nose is lifted off the runway, a process known as rotation. V2 is the single-engine safety speed, the single engine climb speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/publications/tp14371-gen-1-0-2561.htm#gen-1-9-1 | title=Aeronatutical Information Manual | publisher=Transport Canada | accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of these speeds ensure that either sufficient thrust to continue the takeoff, or sufficient stopping distance to reject it will be available at all times.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

==Failure during extended operations==
{{Main|ETOPS}}
In order to allow twin-engined aircraft to fly longer routes that are over an hour from a suitable diversion airport, a set of rules known as ETOPS (Extended Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards) is used to ensure a twin turbine engine powered aircraft is able to safely arrive at a diversionary airport after an engine failure or shutdown, as well as to minimize the risk of a failure. ETOPS includes maintenance requirements, such as frequent and meticulously logged inspections and operation requirements such as flight crew training and ETOPS-specific procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/airports/faqs/etopseropsenroutealt.pdf | title=ETOPS, EROPS and Enroute Alternates | publisher=The Boeing Company | accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contained and uncontained failures==
{{anchor|uncontained}}[[File:Delta Airlines Flight 1288 Engine Failure.jpg|right|thumb|The engine of [[Delta Air Lines Flight 1288]] after it experienced catastrophic uncontained compressor rotor failure in 1996.]]

Engine failures may be described as either as "contained" or "uncontained".

* A contained engine failure is one in which components might separate inside the engine but either remain within the engine's cases or exit the engine through the tail pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Uncontained_Engine_Failure|title=Uncontained Engine Failure - SKYbrary Aviation Safety|website=www.skybrary.aero|language=en|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An uncontained engine event occurs when an engine failure results in fragments of rotating engine parts penetrating and exiting through the engine case. Uncontained turbine engine disk failures within an aircraft engine present a direct hazard to an airplane and its passengers because high-energy disk fragments can penetrate the cabin or fuel tanks, damage flight control surfaces, or sever flammable fluid or hydraulic lines.&lt;ref name="NTSB Investigative Report 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/Four_Recent_Uncontained_Engine_Failure_Events_Prompt_NTSB_to_Issue_Urgent_Safety_Recommendations_to_FAA.aspx|title=Four Recent Uncontained Engine Failure Events Prompt NTSB to Issue Urgent Safety Recommendations to FAA|last=|first=|date=|website=ntsb.gov|accessdate=27 May 2010}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Engine cases are not designed to contain failed turbine disks. Instead, the risk of uncontained disk failure is mitigated by designating disks as safety-critical parts, defined as the parts of an engine whose failure is likely to present a direct hazard to the aircraft.&lt;ref name="NTSB Investigative Report 2" /&gt; Engine manufacturers are required by the FAA to perform [[Blade off testing|blade off tests]] to ensure containment of shrapnel if blade separation occurs.&lt;ref name="14CFR"&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=466022f9e574a12e0b383c9ddebced01&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:1.0.1.3.16.6.363.13&amp;idno=14 Blade containment and rotor unbalance tests.]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612142218/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=466022f9e574a12e0b383c9ddebced01&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=14%3A1.0.1.3.16.6.363.13&amp;idno=14 |date=12 June 2011  }}, 14 CFR 33.94, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable uncontained engine failure accidents==
* [[National Airlines Flight 27]]: a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] flying from Miami to San Francisco in 1973 had an overspeed failure of a [[General Electric CF6]]-6, resulting in one fatality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR7502.pdf | title=Aircraft Accident Report: National Airlines, Incorporated, DC-10-10, N60NA, near Albuquerque, New Mexico, November 3, 1973 | publisher=National Transportation Safety Board | date=15 January 1975 | accessdate=3 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two [[LOT Polish Airlines]] flights, both [[Ilyushin Il-62]]s, suffered catastrophic uncontained engine failures in the 1980s.  The first was in 1980 on [[LOT Polish Airlines Flight 7]] where flight controls were destroyed, killing all 87 on board.  In 1987, on [[LOT Polish Airlines Flight 5055]], the aircraft's inner left (#2) engine, damaged the outer left (#1) engine, setting both on fire and causing loss of flight controls, leading to an eventual crash, which killed all 183 people on board.  In both cases, the turbine shaft in engine #2 disintegrated due to production defects in the engines' bearings, which were missing rollers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Antoni Milkiewicz|title=Jeszcze o Lesie Kabackim |trans-title=More on the Kabacky Forest |language=Polish |date=October 1991 |journal=Aero : technika lotnicza |location=Warsaw|publisher=Oficyna Wydawnicza Simp-Simpress|pages=12–14|issn=0867-6720}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cameroon Airlines Flight 786]]: a [[Boeing 737]] flying between Douala and Garoua, Cameroon in 1984 had a failure of a [[Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D]]-15 engine. 2 people died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19840830-0|title=ASN Aircraft accident Boeing 737-2H7C TJ-CBD Douala Airport (DLA)|first=Harro|last=Ranter|website=aviation-safety.net|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[British Airtours Flight 28M]]: a Boeing 737 flying from Manchester to Corfu suffered an uncontained engine failure and fire on takeoff. The takeoff was aborted and the plane turned onto a taxiway and began evacuating. 55 passengers and crew were unable to escape and died of smoke inhalation. The accident led to major changes to improve the survivalibility of aircraft evacuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/manchester/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8937000/8937316.stm|title=Lessons of Manchester runway fire|date=2010-08-23|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[United Airlines Flight 232]]: a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] flying from Denver to Chicago in 1989. The failure of the rear [[General Electric CF6]]-6 engine caused the loss of all hydraulics forcing the pilots to attempt a landing using [[Flying an airplane without control surfaces|differential thrust]]. 111 fatalities. Prior to the United 232 crash, the probability of a simultaneous failure of all three hydraulic systems was considered as low as one in a billion. However, the [[statistical model]]s used to come up with this figure did not account for the fact that the number-two engine was mounted at the tail close to all the hydraulic lines, nor the possibility that an engine failure would release many fragments in many directions. Since then, more modern aircraft engine designs have focused on keeping shrapnel from penetrating the [[cowling]] or ductwork, and have increasingly utilized high-strength [[composite material]]s to achieve the required penetration resistance while keeping the weight low.
* [[Baikal Airlines Flight 130]]: a starter of engine No. 2 on a [[Tu-154]] heading from [[International Airport Irkutsk|Irkutsk]] to [[Moscow Domodedovo Airport|Domodedovo]], Moscow, failed to stop after engine startup and continued to operate at over 40,000 rpm with open bleed valves from engines, which caused an uncontained failure of the starter. A detached turbine disk damaged fuel and oil supply lines (which caused fire) and hydraulic lines. The fire-extinguishing system failed to stop the fire, and the plane diverted back to Irkutsk. However, due to loss of hydraulic pressure the crew lost control of the plane, which subsequently crashed into a dairy farm killing all 124 on board and 1 on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19940103-2 |title=ASN Aircraft accident Tupolev 154M RA-85656 Mamony |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |date=1994-01-03 |accessdate=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airdisaster.ru/database.php?id=26|title=Катастрофа Ту-154М а/к 'Байкал' в районе Иркутска (борт RA-85656), 03 января 1994 года. // AirDisaster.ru - авиационные происшествия, инциденты и авиакатастрофы в СССР и России - факты, история, статистика|website=www.airdisaster.ru|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Qantas Flight 32]]: an [[Airbus A380]] flying from London Heathrow to Sydney (via Singapore) in 2010 had an uncontained failure in a [[Rolls-Royce Trent 900]] engine. The failure was found to have been caused by a misaligned counter bore within a stub oil pipe leading to a fatigue fracture. This in turn led to an oil leakage followed by an oil fire in the engine. The fire led to the release of the Intermediate Pressure Turbine (IPT) disc. The airplane, however, landed safely. This led to the grounding of the entire Qantas A380 fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-11691197|title=Qantas grounds A380s after scare|date=4 November 2010|publisher=|accessdate=18 April 2018|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Twig-work''' is the term applied to architectural details constructed of twigs and branches to form decorative motifs in buildings and furniture.  [[Carpentry]] or [[woodworking]] using wood that has not been milled into lumber and is still in its natural shape describes the [[National park service rustic]] style.&lt;ref name="allaback"&gt;{{cite web | title=Mount Rainier National Park, Rustic Furnishings | last=Allaback| first=Sarah| url=http://cdn.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/wa/wa0600/wa0658/data/wa0658data.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
[[Joinery (woodworking)|Joinery]] on twigs and branches is similar to joinery for [[lumber]]. [[Mortise and tenon]] joints are strong, but also labor-intensive and time-consuming. Twigs and branches can also be fastened with nails. Where one branch meets another, the ends must be [[Coping (joinery)|coped]], or cut to match the curve.&lt;ref name="twig railing"&gt;{{cite web | title=What is twig railing?| url=http://awoodrailing.com/2014/01/19/twig-railing/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2225">The various types of the '''VM reactor''' series are [[nuclear fission|nuclear]] [[pressurized water reactor]]s (PWR). They are used singly or in pairs to power the [[Soviet Navy]]'s [[submarine]]s. 

It was developed by [http://www.nikiet.ru/ NIKIET].

== Series ==

* The ''VM-A reactor'' was the [[nuclear fission]] [[nuclear reactor|reactor]] used in pairs to power the [[Soviet Navy]]'s Project 658 and 701 ([[Hotel class submarine|Hotel]]), Project 659 and 675 ([[Echo class submarine|Echo]]), and Project 627 Кит ([[November class submarine|November]]) first-generation submarines. It was a [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR), using 20% [[enriched uranium|enriched]] [[uranium-235]] fuel to produce [[megawatt|70 MW]] of power.  This is the reactor that powered the [[Soviet submarine K-19|K-19]]. 
* The ''VM-4 reactor'' is a [[nuclear fission]] [[nuclear reactor|reactor]] using 20% [[enriched uranium|enriched]] [[uranium-235]] fuel to produce 70-90 [[megawatt|MW]] of power. It is used:
** singly to power the Project 670 Скат and Чайка-Б ([[Charlie class submarine|Charlie]]) submarines
** in pairs to power the Project 671 Ёрш and Щука ([[Victor class submarine|Victor]]), Project 667 Мурена, Кальмар, and Дельфин ([[Delta class submarine|Delta]]), and Project 667 Навага, Налим, Груша, and Андромеда ([[Yankee class submarine|Yankee]]) second-generation submarines.  
* The ''VM-5 reactor'' was the [[nuclear fission]] [[nuclear reactor|reactor]] used in a pair to power the [[Soviet Navy]]'s Project 661 Анчар ([[Papa class submarine|Papa]]) second-generation submarine.  It was a [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR) using [[enriched uranium|enriched]] [[uranium-235]] fuel to produce [[megawatt|177 MW]] of power.

'''Walker Electric Trucks''' were [[battery-powered vehicle]]s built from 1907 to 1942 in [[Chicago, Illinois]] and [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]. Initially designed and manufactured by the Walker Vehicle Company (not to be confused with the [[Walker Motor Car Company]]) in Chicago, they were bought by the Anderson Electric Car Company of Detroit in 1916, then sold to [[Commonwealth Edison]] of Chicago in 1920, and last to York &amp; Towne in 1933. In addition to the trucks the company manufactured the Chicago Electric Car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earlyelectric.com/carcompanies.html |title=The Early Electric Car Site}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of their trucks were long in service, surviving the brand, in some cases, by decades. A few of them are now on display in museums or, in the case of one exported to [[New Zealand]], still "in service" with its original owner [[Orion New Zealand Limited]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/LocalHistory/Industry/WalkerTruck/ |title=Christchurch City Libraries Local History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jay Christ's Collection of Antique Delivery Trucks and Classic Cars in Manchester, Pennsylvania, that has restored two Walker Electric Trucks—a 1919 Model LA-10, and a 1938 Model 500 Gas-Electric Dynamotive: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Walker manufactured many different models of trucks and these trucks were sold all across the USA and even to Britain and New Zealand. These trucks had a 3.5 HP electric motor that was powered by many batteries to produce 66 to 80 volts and a maximum of 40 amps. The driving range of these trucks was about 50 miles and the maximum speed was 10 to 12 MPH. The trucks were plugged into a charging station in the evening after the daily deliveries were completed...These trucks were a welcome relief for the general public and the delivery companies. Previously the deliveries were made by horse and wagon. The horses were not the most sanitary because of their daily habits of relieving themselves anywhere they felt like it along the routes. This didn't make the customers too happy. The horses were loyal in the task of pulling the wagons but their pace was slow compared the trucks. The first companies to use this style of delivery were dairies, bakeries, US Mail, retail store and freight companies. Marshall Field and Company had a fleet of 276 electric Walker Trucks in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jcristmuseum.org/walker19.SHTML |title=Jay Christ's Collection of Antique Delivery Trucks and Classic Cars}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Iowa Trucking Museum in Walcott, Iowa has a 1911 Walker Electric Truck that had been owned and used by Bowman Dairy and celebrated the truck's 100th birthday at the Walcott Truckers Jamboree in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.truckinginfo.com/blog/all-thats-trucking/story/2011/06/and-you-thought-electric-trucks-were-a-recent-invention.aspx |title=Trucking Info, June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1918 Walker Electric panel van is displayed at the Thor Electric Truck company in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2017-12-13/thor-wants-to-throw-down-an-electric-hammer-video |title=Thor Wants to Throw Down an Electric Hammer on Tesla (at 4min50s) |last=Vance |first=Ashlee |authorlink=Ashlee Vance |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2017-12-13 |access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dwinell-Wright Company]] in Boston, Massachusetts employed a Walker Electric Truck from 1914 through 1960 to move freight—primarily green coffee beans—from the docks to their South Boston warehouse. Afterward the vehicle was put on display at [[Edaville Railroad]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4907">The '''Western Power Corridor''' ('''Westcor''') was a project to construct and supply energy from two [[hydroelectric power]] plants to the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Angola]], [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]] and [[South Africa]].  Originally, the hydro power was to be supplied form the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]'s [[Inga III|INGA III]] project.  Later Inga III was supposed to be replaced by [[Angola]]'s [[Cuanza River]] and [[Cunene River]] projects or by the new project in the Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;ref name=afriquejet&gt;

An inter-governmental memorandum on the Westcor was signed on 22 October 2004 in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, followed by the shareholders' agreement signed by the national electricity companies.&lt;ref name=bopa200106&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-feasibility study was completed in 2005.

In 2009, Democratic Republic of the Congo decided to develop the INGA III project by using private investments and the project was redesigned to involve Cuanza River and Cunene River projects in Angola.&lt;ref name=afriquejet/&gt;  In 2010 the Democratic Republic of Congo indicated it will propose a new project involving also [[Mozambique]], [[Zambia]], and [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref name=southerntimes/&gt;

Ultimately the project was aborted by shareholders when unforeseen changes were proposed to the founding agreements.

'''The winter of 2010–2011 in Europe''' began with an unusually cold November caused by a cold [[weather cycle]] that started in southern [[Scandinavia]] and subsequently moved south and west over both Belgium and the Netherlands on 25 November and into the west of Scotland and north east England on 26 November. This was due to a low pressure zone in the [[Baltics]], with a high pressure over Greenland on 24 November.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/snow-brings-parts-of-britain-to-a-standstill-2144267.html |title=Snow brings parts of Britain to a standstill |work=The Independent |date= 26 November 2010|accessdate=29 November 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 22 November 2010, cold conditions arrived in the United Kingdom, as a cold northerly wind developed and snow began to fall in northern and eastern parts, causing disruption. The winter arrived particularly early for the European climate, with temperatures dropping significantly lower than previous lows for the month of November. On 28 November, Wales recorded its lowest-ever November temperature of {{convert|-17.3|C}} in Llysdinam, and Northern Ireland recorded its lowest ever November temperature of {{convert|-9.5|C}} in Lough Rea. The UK [[Met Office]] issued severe-weather warnings for heavy snow for eastern Scotland and the north-east of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/11856790|title=The big chill: Your stories of UK snow|date=28 November 2010|work=BBC News|accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From January, temperatures were more normal.

== Meteorological history ==
The weather phenomenon was caused by a cold [[weather cycle]] that had started in southern [[Scandinavia]] and subsequently moved south and west over both Belgium and the Netherlands on 25 November and into the west of [[Scotland]] and [[North East England]] on 26 November. This was due to a low pressure zone in the [[Baltics]] a high pressure over Greenland on 24 November.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

A cold front moved out of [[Siberia]] on 24 November, and cold spell and snow storms also hit the [[Alps]], on 26 November before hitting the UK on 29 November.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; Other earlier, but unrelated, storms had dusted [[Northumberland]] and [[Scottish Borders Region]] on 23–24 November, before being absorbed into the advancing Scandinavian weather system.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11854881 |title='Beautiful but bitterly cold' weather |publisher=BBC |date= 27 November 2010|accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland was first hit on 26 Nov

Heavy snow caused many problems across the UK and the first disruption of Snowfall occurred on 24 November in the Grampians, Eastern Scotland and Cairngorms, where snow showers blown from a northerly wind caused havoc as accumulations up to {{convert|20|cm|in|0}} in Aviemore made conditions difficult and major roads in [[Aberdeen]] had gridlock problems in the rush hour. Further snow disrupted all of Scotland, Southern Wales, Northern Ireland, South West and England and much of the North and East of England as snow accumulated to over {{convert|60|cm}} in rural settlements in Scotland. The snowfall was the earliest widespread snowfall since 1993. Some forecasters have warned of temperatures dropping to {{convert|-20|C|F|0}}. Temperatures in [[Carterhouse]], [[Scottish Borders]], fell to {{convert|-7.8|C|F|0}}, and several inches of snow were recorded in [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]].

== Timeline ==

=== November to December 2010 ===
On 22 November, forecasters in the [[Baltic states|Baltic nations]] saw snow storms expected some in parts of Sweden on the next day, especially in the south of the country.  Snow flurries were reported by the afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;http://stockholmnews.com/more.aspx?NID=6313&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scandinavia]]n low moved southward bringing snow and frost to both The Netherlands and the north west coast of Germany.

The severe winter weather resulted in school closures as Northern Scotland, North East England and parts of North and East Yorkshire were blanketed in up to {{convert|6|in|cm|-1|abbr=on}} of snow. Sub-zero overnight temperatures were recorded across the country, with the coldest place being at [[Carterhouse]] in the [[Scottish Borders]] at {{convert|-7.8|C|F}} while [[Benson, Oxfordshire|Benson]] in Oxfordshire fell to {{convert|-7.6|C|F}}. By the middle of 27 November, up to {{convert|1.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} of snow fell in parts of Staffordshire overnight while residents in the [[Black Country]] also woke up to a covering today with warnings of way with blizzards expected in the region with a predicted snowfall of {{convert|8|in|cm|abbr=on}} over the next few days.&lt;ref name="expressandstar.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2010/11/27/snow-hits-west-midlands-2/ |title=Snow hits West Midlands " Express &amp; Star |publisher=Expressandstar.com |accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2010/11/27/snow-hits-west-midlands-2/#ixzz16W0rLjOI |title=Snow hits West Midlands " Express &amp; Star |work=Express &amp; Star |accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland saw the temperature at [[Loch Glascarnoch]] fall to {{convert|-15|C|F}}, a new record low for November in Scotland.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-11856694 |title=Chaos as heavy snow hits Scotland |publisher=BBC |date= 28 November 2010|accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Automobile Association|AA]] said that 29 November 2010 was one of its busiest times in its entire 105-year history as they were called to more than 200,000 broken down drivers across the UK.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The morning of 30 November saw about {{convert|1|ft|cm|0|order=flip}} of snow hit [[Banburyshire]] and [[Oxfordshire]] with {{convert|2|to|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} snow falling many more parts of the UK, but much less fall in Scotland and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Over 1,000 schools were closed across the Kingdom, mostly in [[Scotland]] and the north of England, with 50 schools in [[Northumberland]], County Durham, and [[Tyne and Wear]] closed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The evening of 30 November and the whole of 1 December saw extremely heavy snowfall hit [[Sheffield]], one of the worst affected cities in England. All transport was cancelled throughout the city and the surrounding areas and many people were snowed in their homes. On that day, {{convert|40|-|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} of snow fell on top of a blanket of {{convert|25|-|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} of snow.

The evening of 1 December and the morning of 2 December there was extremely heavy snow in [[Southern England]], especially on the South Coast, {{convert|30|-|40|cm|in|abbr=in}} of snow was recorded throughout East and West [[Sussex]] with the [[South Downs]] receiving close to {{convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on}} of snow.

More heavy snowfall was reported in Southern England on 17/18 December, with parts of Greater London reporting nearly {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}}. Snow even settled in Central London, causing travel disruptions to the city's Underground system and airports.

This was the coldest December recorded in the UK since 1890.

The lowest temperature of the winter so far is {{convert|-21.2|C|F}} recorded at Altnaharra in the Scottish Highlands at 10&amp;nbsp;am on 2 December.

==== Ireland ====

[[File:Ireland Aqua 2010 336.jpg|Photograph of snow in Ireland taken by the NASA Aqua satellite on 2 December 2010|thumb]]

Ireland was first hit by the snow on the morning of 27 November 2010. The morning of Saturday, 27 November, saw Ireland freezing in what could be a rather costly cold snap as it emerged that the extreme weather earlier in 2010 had cost a colossal €297m in insurance payouts, due to the snow causing damage was also caused to homes and other buildings all over the country. The [[Irish Insurance Federation]] revealed there were 22,450 claims from the public, the vast majority of which involved snow or ice damage to people's homes.&lt;ref name="herald.ie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herald.ie/national-news/and-its-novembrrr-as-snow-blankets-the-city-2438671.html |title=and it's Novembrrr as snow blankets the city – National News, Frontpage |publisher=Herald.ie |accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Road conditions in the [[Dublin]] area were made dangerous after freezing temperatures and snow led to icy surfaces and paths were made Icy by frost.&lt;ref name="herald.ie"/&gt; A prolonged freeze disrupted businesses and schools as travel was made hazardous.&lt;ref name="herald.ie"/&gt; The [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit|DART]] and the northern commuter and [[Maynooth]] commuter lines were not running and [[Belfast]] and [[Rosslare Europort|Rosslare]] train services out of [[Dublin]] were also affected. The main runway at Dublin Airport closed due to snow and ice for most of the day.&lt;ref name="herald.ie"/&gt;

The extreme weather was reminiscent of the winter storms of 2009/2010, which were the worst in recent Irish history.&lt;ref name="herald.ie"/&gt; [[Met Éireann]] said the areas worst affected by the overnight snow were eastern parts of [[Leinster]], [[Donegal]] and [[Connacht]] and said the bad weather was expected to last for up to a week, with depths of up to {{convert|10|cm}} in places. Met Éireann put a weather warning in place and more snow for the counties in the east, north and north west.  They also put a gale and small craft warning in effect.&lt;ref name="herald.ie"/&gt;

==== Switzerland ====
Heavy snowfall was reported across higher parts of the country on 26 November and in lowland Switzerland on the next day. Heavy snow caused [[Geneva Airport]] to close. The temperatures hovered between {{convert|+5|and|-5|C|F}} for the next 8 days, with 30 November to 1 December having a nighttime temperature of {{convert|-11|°C}}. Similar weather was predicted for the Austrian [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wunderground.com/global/stations/06700.html |title=Geneva, Switzerland Forecast : Weather Underground |publisher=Wunderground.com |date=17 November 2010 |accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== France ====
A record {{convert|-15.3|C}} was measured 30 November in [[Orléans]], France. This is the lowest temperature in November at sea level in France.{{clarify|reason=so, does the new record supersede the old one or does the old one still stand?|date=December 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euronews.net/2010/11/30/winter-snow-woes-go-on-for-northern-europe/&lt;/ref&gt; Ice and snow led to power outages in Orléans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.france24.com/fr/20101129-verglas-neige-coupures-courant-grosses-difficultes-circulation&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Scandinavia ====
[[Trondheim]], Norway's third-biggest city, located in [[Central Norway]], experienced the coldest November since the beginning of recording temperatures in 1788. Especially the last week of November saw temperatures {{convert|12|–|14|C-change|F-change|abbr=out}} below normal.&lt;ref name="Aftenposten"&gt;{{Cite news |author= Buan, Vibeke |title= Kuldebølgen fortsetter i sør |url= http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article3927628.ece |work= [[Aftenposten]] |language= Norwegian |date= 30 November 2010 |accessdate= 1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Severe blizzards hit southern Sweden and Denmark, affecting flights at [[Copenhagen Airport]]. Over {{convert|30|cm}} of snow fell. [[Helsinki]] and [[Stockholm]] recorded their coldest November nights on record, at {{convert|-20|and|-17|C|F|adj=mid|, respectively}}.

According to [[thelocal.se]] Sweden had its coldest and snowiest start to the winter in 100 years. The east coast of Sweden experienced heavy snowfall in November/December, coming from very cold air influenced by the still open water of the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Bothnia]].

On 22 December 2010, there were 56 centimeters of snow in [[Helsinki]], Finland. Throughout the winter, the snow had caused a one-minute increase in the average response time of the city's fire and rescue department.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
In Sweden there was severe snowfall near Christmas, especially in Scania on 23 December, on Öland on 24 December, and in South Norrland coast on 26 December. These were very important Christmas travel days, and caused heavy travel disturbances, especially for trains. Worst hit was [[Bornholm]], Denmark on 23 December, which got all roads unpassable for days, which meant that arriving visitors had to celebrate [[Christmas]] in schools or hotels, Bornholm got to 130&amp;nbsp;cm snow in December 2010, the deepest snow cover on record  in Denmark's weather history.

In January, the temperatures in Sweden were warmer than normal, Malmö had 0&amp;nbsp;°C, Stockholm −3&amp;nbsp;°C and Luleå -11&amp;nbsp;°C on average. South Sweden had 0–1&amp;nbsp;°C above normal, but south Norrland had 2–4&amp;nbsp;°C above normal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smhi.se/klimatdata/Manadens-vader-och-vatten/Sverige/Manadens-vader-i-Sverige/januari-2011-mildare-vintervader-1.14918?search=yes&amp;month=2&amp;year=2011 Januari 2011 – Mildare vinterväder]&lt;/ref&gt; The snow cover mostly remained in all the country during this month.

In February, the temperatures in Sweden were again colder than normal, Malmö had −1&amp;nbsp;°C, Stockholm −5&amp;nbsp;°C and Luleå -16&amp;nbsp;°C on average. South Sweden had 0–2&amp;nbsp;°C below normal, but north Norrland had 3–5&amp;nbsp;°C below normal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smhi.se/klimatdata/Manadens-vader-och-vatten/Sverige/februari-2011-vinterkyla-och-storm-1.15400?search=yes&amp;month=3&amp;year=2011 Februari 2011 – Vinterkyla och storm]&lt;/ref&gt; There was a storm on 8 February over Skåne and neighbourhood with a sustained wind of up to 30&amp;nbsp;m/s. The temperature reached −42.6&amp;nbsp;°C in [[Nikkaluokta]], the coldest in Sweden this winter.

====Estonia====
November started with very high temperatures across Estonia, temperatures rose up to 13&amp;nbsp;°C, but a week later a cold front crossed Estonia bringing storms with up to 20&amp;nbsp;cm of snowfall, but it melted very fast. End of November temperatures went down to -27&amp;nbsp;°C. 
On 9 and 10 December snowstorm Monika brought severe snowfall and blizzards to Estonia. Little town of Väike- Maarja received in 24 hours up to 40&amp;nbsp;cm of snow. Six hundred cars with people were trapped on the road in Padaoru, Lääne- Nigula. Many of Tallinn airport's flights were cancelled because of heavy snowfall. Schools were closed. Another snowstorm Scarlett brought a very heavy snowfall on 24 December, again many people were trapped and the roads were closed. Between those 2 storms, lake effect brought more snow, so by the end of the December many places in Estonia had up to 50 to 80&amp;nbsp;cm of snow. The year-lowest temperature was in Jõgeva -33.4&amp;nbsp;°C, on 18 February.

==== Germany ====
Germany experienced its coldest December since 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwd.de/bvbw/appmanager/bvbw/dwdwwwDesktop;jsessionid=36wwNnKcGQPcNF0pvvJ31w6JXdSQrdd5ttq6ypbdv0fx2pQDB5fK!-1682695147!772302560?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=dwdwww_klima_umwelt&amp;_nfls=false |title=Übersicht zur Temperaturverteilung, Niederschlag und Sonnenscheindauer in Deutschland im Dezember 2010 (in German) |publisher=DWD |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average temperature was −3.7&amp;nbsp;°C which was 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C below the long-term mean. This made December 2010 the fourth-coldest of the last 120 years. Only 1890, 1969 and 1933 were colder. The cold was strongest in the northern half of Germany with deviations from the long-term mean between −5&amp;nbsp;°C and −6&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bernd-hussing.de/Archivdateien/Klima122010.htm |title=Klima Deutschland Dezember 2010 (in German) |publisher=Bernd Hussing |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The month was slightly milder in the south, due to two notable periods of thawing and maximum temperatures of up to +15&amp;nbsp;°C around 8 December and shortly before Christmas.&lt;ref name="DWD12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwd.de/bvbw/appmanager/bvbw/dwdwwwDesktop?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=dwdwww_menu2_presse&amp;T98029gsbDocumentPath=Content%2FPresse%2FPressemitteilungen%2F2010%2F20101129__DeutschlandwetterimDezember2010__news.html |title=Press release of the DWD (in German) |publisher=DWD |date=30 December 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally to the cold, about 60% of the German Weather Service's weather stations below 200 metres' elevation saw record snow falls for December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwd.de/bvbw/appmanager/bvbw/dwdwwwDesktop?_nfpb=true&amp;_windowLabel=T173200162321273036449357&amp;_urlType=action&amp;_pageLabel=_dwdwww_wetter_warnungen_Thema_des_Tages |title=Thema des Tages – 26.12.2010: Weihnachten weiß und kalt (in German) |publisher=DWD |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, Aachen, in Germany's west, had 36&amp;nbsp;cm of snow, breaking the old record of 25&amp;nbsp;cm. The heavy snowfalls between 22 and 25 December provided for a white Christmas for all of Germany – the first time since 1981.&lt;ref name="DWD12"/&gt; On 26 December, Gera had a snow cover of 70&amp;nbsp;cm, also a new record.

== Record-low temperatures ==

=== Sweden ===
Many cities in Sweden had their coldest December since the beginning of recording temperatures. The average temperature in [[Gothenburg]] was −6.2&amp;nbsp;°C. which was 2.5&amp;nbsp;°C colder than the old record. In Örebro the coldest temperature in December since 1886 with −26.6&amp;nbsp;°C was measured. The coldest temperature that was notified in December in Sweden was −42.1&amp;nbsp;°C in [[Nikkaluokta]].&lt;ref&gt;http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=52865&amp;a=2284869&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===
[[Trondheim]], Norway's third-biggest city, experienced the coldest November since the beginning of recording temperatures in 1788. Especially the last week of November saw temperatures {{convert|12|-|14|C-change|F-change|abbr=out}} below normal.&lt;ref name="Aftenposten"/&gt; The average temperature in [[Oslo]] was −1.7&amp;nbsp;°C in November 2010, the coldest since 1968 which had −2.1&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= Kristensen, Jørgen Dahl |title= Kuldekartet viser minus 20,3 |url= http://www.budstikka.no/nyheter/kuldekartet-viser-minus-20-3-1.5849596 |work= [[Budstikka]] |location= Sandvika, Bærum, Norway |language= Norwegian |date= 30 November 2010 |accessdate= 1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record low for Norway in November 2010 was measured in [[Karasjok]] in [[Finnmark]], the northernmost county, on 27 November, showing {{convert|-35|C}}.&lt;ref name="Aftenposten"/&gt;

=== Northern Ireland ===
[[Castlederg]], in western [[Northern Ireland]], recorded a new record-low temperature of {{convert|-18|°C|1}} on 19 December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-12036233 "Record low temperature recorded in Northern Ireland"].

== Floodings and high temperatures in Balkans ==
Much different temperatures occurred in the beginning of December in the [[Balkan]]s, where heavy rain caused floodings in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, and Serbia.&lt;ref name="bbc3"&gt;{{cite news|title=Balkans flooding prompts emergency call|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11909693|work=BBC News|accessdate=7 December 2010|date=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The River [[Neretva]] reached its highest level in the past 50 years.&lt;ref name="bbc3"/&gt; The rivers [[Lim (river)|Lim]] and [[Drina]] both caused severe flooding.

The process of making woodchips is called wood chipping and is done using a [[Woodchipper|wood chipper]]. The types of woodchips formed following chipping is dependent on the type of wood chipper used and the material from which they are made.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forestry.gov.uk/fr/beeh-9ujn3d|title=Wood chips|last=GB|first=Forestry Commission,|website=www.forestry.gov.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodchip varieties include: forest chips (from forested areas), wood residue chips (from untreated wood residues, recycled wood and off-cuts), sawing residue chips (from sawmill residues), and short rotation forestry chips (from energy crops).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Raw materials ==
[[File:Woodchips at Albany Port.JPG|thumb|Woodchips waiting to be loaded at [[Port of Albany|Albany Port]] in [[Western Australia]]]]The raw materials of woodchips can be [[pulpwood]], waste wood, and residual wood from [[agriculture]], [[landscaping]], [[logging]], and [[sawmill]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/agriculture-and-seafood/agricultural-land-and-environment/strengthening-farming/farm-practices/870218-61_woodwaste.pdf|title=Woodwaste|date=May 2014|website=Government of British Columbia|access-date=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodchips can also be produced from remaining forestry materials including [[tree crown]]s, branches, unsaleable materials or undersized trees.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.teagasc.ie/media/website/crops/forestry/advice/Teagasc_wood_energy_guide_edition3.pdf|title=Wood Energy from Farm Forests|last=|first=|date=November 2009|website=Agriculture and Food Development Authority|access-date=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Bandit_Model_1290H_drum_chipper.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bandit_Model_1290H_drum_chipper.jpg|thumb|Wood chipper]]Forestry operations provide the raw materials needed for woodchip production.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.teagasc.ie/media/website/crops/forestry/advice/Teagasc_wood_energy_guide_edition3.pdf|title=Wood Energy from Farm Forests|last=|first=|date=November 2009|website=Agriculture and Food Development Authority|access-date=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost any tree can be converted into woodchips, however, the type and quality of the wood used to produce woodchips depends largely on the market.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=LAiGEDxN4moC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=Woodchips+are+a+medium-sized+solid+material+made+by+cutting,+or+chipping,+larger+pieces+of+wood.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qdgP233uQg&amp;sig=nGzsaOaQMmv3eIY3deIPkWF7QtE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjInfX2mMfZAhUSbKwKHSYGA74Q6AEIWzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Woodchips&amp;f=false|title=Bioenergy for Sustainable Development in Africa|last=Janssen|first=Rainer|last2=Rutz|first2=Dominik|date=2011-11-03|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789400721814|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Softwood]] species, for instance, tend to be more versatile for use as woodchips than [[hardwood]] species because they are less dense and faster growing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Production ==
A [[woodchipper|wood chipper]] is a machine used for cutting wood into smaller pieces (chips).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/woodchipper|title=the definition of woodchipper|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several types of wood chippers, each having a different use depending on the type of processing the woodchips will undergo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=NU-NhpbJxFsC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=types+of+wood+chippers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdt5vc08fZAhWJc98KHXWVC0UQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=types%20of%20wood%20chippers&amp;f=false|title=Power from Pellets: Technology and Applications|last=Döring|first=Stefan|date=2012-10-19|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783642199622|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pulp and paper industry ===
Woodchips used for chemical [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]] must be relatively uniform in size and free of bark. The optimum size varies with the wood species.&lt;ref name="chip"&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of pulp|volume=1 |editor1-last=Sixta |editor1-first=Herbert  |year=2006 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Winheim, Germany |isbn=3-527-30997-7 |pages= 79–88 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to avoid damage to the wood fibres as this is important for the pulp properties. For roundwood it is most common to use disk chippers. A typical size of the disk is 2.0 – 3.5 m in diameter, 10 – 25&amp;nbsp;cm in thickness and weight is up to 30 tons. The disk is fitted with 4 to 16 knives and driven with motors of ½ - 2 MW.&lt;ref name="chip" /&gt; Drum chippers are normally used for wood residuals from saw mills or other wood industry.&lt;ref name="chip" /&gt;

=== Methods of conveyance ===
There are four potential methods to move woodchips: [[pneumatic]], [[conveyor belt]], [[Chute (gravity)|hopper]] with direct chute, and batch system (manual conveyance).&lt;ref name="VTHR Green wood Chip Furnace"&gt;[http://www.sredmond.com/vthr_index.htm VTHR Green wood Chip Furnace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119075105/http://www.sredmond.com/vthr_index.htm |date=2008-01-19 }}{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stiltman.com/html/doe_report_part_ii.html BIOMASS ENERGY.

== Types of wood chippers ==

=== Disk ===
A disk wood chipper features a [[flywheel]] made of steel and chopping blades with slotted disks. The blades slice through the wood as the material is fed through the chute. Knives located in the throat of the chipper cuts the wood in the opposite direction. The design is not as energy efficient as other styles but produces consistent shapes and sizes of woodchips.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://greengain.eu/2015/09/23/what-is-going-on-in-the-pool-2/|title=Machines to produce woodchips from biomass of landscape conservation and maintenance work (LCMW) - greenGain.eu|date=2015-09-23|work=greenGain.eu|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.woodenergy.ie/woodharvestingequipment/|title=Wood Energy - Wood Harvesting Equipment|website=www.woodenergy.ie|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drum ===
A drum wood chipper has a rotating parallel-sided drum attached to the engine with reinforced steel blades attached in a horizontal direction. Wood is drawn into the chute by gravity and the rotation of the drum where it is broken up by the steel blades. The drum type is noisy and creates large uneven chips but are more energy efficient than the disk type.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Screw-type ===
A screw-type wood chipper contains a conical, screw-shaped blade. The blade rotation is set parallel to the opening so wood is pulled into the chipper by the spiral motion. Screw-type, also called high-torque rollers, are popular for residential use due to being quiet, easy to use and safer than disk and drum types.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.landpoweruk.com/content/28-wood-chipper-wood-shredder-guide-landpower-uk|title=Wood Chipper &amp; Wood Shredder Guide {{!}} Landpower UK {{!}} Landpower Machinery - Templecombe, Somerset, Dorset, Hampshire, Wiltshire &amp; Devon|website=www.landpoweruk.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

Woodchips are used primarily as a raw material for technical wood processing. In industry, processing of bark chips is often separated after peeling the logs due to different chemical properties.

=== Wood pulp ===
{{Main|Wood pulp}}
Only the heartwood and sapwood are useful for making pulp. Bark contains relatively few useful fibres and is removed and used as fuel to provide steam for use in the [[pulp mill]]. Most pulping processes require that the wood be chipped and screened to provide uniform sized chips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramgopal|first=Y. N.|date=June 2016|title=A Study on Production of Pulp from Ground Nut Shells|url=https://www.ijser.org/researchpaper/A-Study-on-Production-of-Pulp-from-Ground-Nut-Shells.pdf|journal=International Journal of Scientific and Engineering Research|volume=7|pages=423–428|via=IJSER}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mulch ===
Woodchips are also used as landscape and garden [[mulch]], producing benefits such as [[water conservation]], weed control, reducing and preventing [[soil erosion]], and for supporting germination of native seeds and [[acorn]]s in [[Restoration ecology|habitat restoration]] projects. As the [[ramial chipped wood]] decomposes it improves the soil structure, permeability, bioactivity, and nutrient availability of the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/cpp/Revegetation.pdf|title=Natural Regeneration|date=October 2012|website=Office of Environment and Heritage, Department of Premier and Cabinet NSW|access-date=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodchips when used as a [[mulch]] are at least three inches thick.

=== Playground surfacing ===
Woodchips can be reprocessed into an extremely effective playground surfacing material, or impact-attenuation surface.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncemch.org/child-care-health-consultants/Part2/2-4_playground_surfacing.pdf|title=Playground Surfacing Materials ADA-Approved and Non-Appproved|last=Marshall|first=Mike|date=March 25, 2011|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214150446/https://www.ncemch.org/child-care-health-consultants/Part2/2-4_playground_surfacing.pdf|archive-date=2017-12-14|dead-url=no|access-date=July 25, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used as [[playground surfacing]] (soft fall, cushion fall, or play chip, as it is sometimes known), woodchips can be very effective in lessening the impact of falls from playground equipment. When spread to depths of one foot (30 centimetres) playground woodchips can be effective at reducing impacts in falls up to 11 feet (3 meters). Playground woodchips are also an environmentally friendly alternative to rubber type playground surfaces.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Barbecuing ===
Woodchips can also be used to infuse flavor and enhance the smoky taste to barbecued meats and vegetables. Several different species of wood can be used depending on the type of flavor wanted. For a mild, sweet fruity flavor, apple wood can be used while hickory gives a smoky, bacon-like flavor. Other different types of wood used are cherry, hickory, mesquite and pecan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Use Smoking Woods|url=https://www.weber.com/US/en/blog/smoking-woods-strike-while-the-grill-is-hot|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bioreactor ===
Woodchip piles at the edge of a field can inhibit nitrates from running off into water tiles. They are a simple measure for farmers to reduce nitrate pollution of the watershed without them having to change their land management practice. A 2011 study showed that most of the nitrate removal was due to [[heterotrophic]] denitrification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=21696799|year=2011|author1=Warneke|first1=S|title=A comparison of different approaches for measuring denitrification rates in a nitrate removing bioreactor|journal=Water Research|volume=45|issue=14|pages=4141–51|last2=Schipper|first2=L.

R.|last3=Brown|first3=L. C.|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2014.10.039}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown if other nutrients like [[phosphorus]] or pathogens are affected by the bioreactor as well.

=== Fuel ===
Woodchips have been traditionally used as solid fuel for [[space heating]] or in energy plants to generate [[electric power]] from [[renewable energy]]. The main source of forest chips in Europe and in most of the countries{{which|date=March 2015}} have been logging residues. It is expected that the shares of stumps and roundwood will increase in the future.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.createwood.com/products/wooden-chips/|title=Wooden Chips|date=2018|website=A&amp;S Enterprises|access-date=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of| 2013}} in the EU, the estimates for biomass potential for energy, available under current 2018 conditions including sustainable use of the forest as well as providing wood to the traditional forest sectors, are: 277 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, for above ground biomass and 585 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for total biomass.&lt;ref name="Yanez et al 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Forest chips for energy in Europe: current procurement methods and potentials | journal = Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews | volume =21 | issue = | pages =562–571 | year =2013 | doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2012.12.016 | author =Díaz-Yáñez O, Mola-Yudego, B; Anttila P, Röser D, Asikainen A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newer fuel systems for heating use either woodchips or [[wood pellets]]. The advantage of woodchips is cost, the advantage of wood pellets is the controlled fuel value. The use of woodchips in automated heating systems, is based on a robust technology.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The size of the woodchips is particularly important when burning woodchip in small plants. Unfortunately there are not many standards to decide the fractions of woodchip. One standard is the GF60 which is commonly used in smaller plants, including small industries, villas,  and apartment buildings. "GF60" is known as "Fine, dry, small chips". The requirements for GF60 are that the moisture is between 10–30% and the fractions of the woodchips are distributed as follows: 0–3.5mm: &lt;8%, 3.5–30mm: &lt;7%, 30–60&amp;nbsp;mm: 80–100%, 60–100&amp;nbsp;mm: &lt;3%, 100–120&amp;nbsp;mm: &lt;2%.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The energy content in one cubic metre is normally higher than in one cubic metre wood logs, but can vary greatly depending on moisture. The moisture is decided by the handling of the raw material. If the trees are taken down in the winter and left to dry for the summer (with teas in the bark and covered so rain can't reach to them), and is then chipped in the fall, the woodchips' moisture content will be approximately 20–25%. The energy content, then, is approximately 3.5–4.5kWh/kg (~150–250&amp;nbsp;kg/cubic metre).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Coal power plant]]s have been converted to run on woodchips, which is fairly straightforward to do, since they both use an identical [[steam turbine]] [[heat engine]], and the cost of woodchip fuel is comparable to [[coal]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Solid [[biomass]] is an attractive fuel for addressing the concerns of the [[energy crisis]] and [[climate change]], since the fuel is affordable, widely available, close to [[carbon neutral]] and thus climate-neutral in terms of carbon dioxide (CO2), since in the ideal case only the carbon dioxide which was drawn in during the tree’s growth and stored in the wood is released into the atmosphere again.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Waste and emissions ====
Compared to the solid waste disposal problems of coal and nuclear fuels, woodchip fuel's waste disposal problems are less grave; in a study from 2001 [[fly ash]] from woodchip combustion had 28.6&amp;nbsp;mg cadmium/kg dry matter. Compared to fly ash from burning of straw, cadmium was bound more heavily, with only small amounts of cadmium leached. It was speciated as a form of [[cadmium oxide]], cadmium silicate (CdSiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;); authors noted that adding it to agricultural or forest soils in the long-term could cause a problem with accumulation of cadmium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11572586|year=2001|author1=Hansen|first1=H. K.|title=Speciation and mobility of cadmium in straw and wood combustion fly ash|journal=Chemosphere|volume=45|issue=1|pages=123–8|last2=Pedersen|first2=A. J.|last3=Ottosen|first3=L. M.|last4=Villumsen|first4=A|doi=10.1016/s0045-6535(01)00026-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like coal, wood combustion is a known source of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] emissions, particularly in northern climates during winter. The mercury is both gaseous as elemental mercury (especially when wood pellets are burned) or mercury oxide, and solid PM2.5 particulate matter when untreated wood is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=21620435|year=2011|author1=Huang|first1=J|title=Mercury (Hg) emissions from domestic biomass combustion for space heating|journal=Chemosphere|volume=84|issue=11|pages=1694–9|last2=Hopke|first2=P. K.|last3=Choi|first3=H. D.|last4=Laing|first4=J. R.|last5=Cui|first5=H|last6=Zananski|first6=T. J.|last7=Chandrasekaran|first7=S. R.|last8=Rattigan|first8=O. V.|last9=Holsen|first9=T. M.|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.04.078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When wood burning is used for space heating, indoor emissions of [[1,3-butadiene]], [[benzene]], [[formaldehyde]] and [[acetaldehyde]], which are suspected or known carcinogenic compounds, are elevated. The cancer risk from these after exposure to wood smoke is estimated to be low in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 1721393|pmc= 2965621|year= 1991|author1= Rilo|first1= H. L.|title= Effect of FK 506 on function of human islets of Langerhans|journal= Transplantation proceedings|volume= 23|issue= 6|pages= 3164–5|last2= Zeng|first2= Y|last3= Alejandro|first3= R|last4= Carroll|first4= P.

Certain techniques for burning woodchips result in the production of [[biochar]] – effectively charcoal – which can be either utilised as charcoal, or returned to the soil, since [[wood ash]] can be used as a mineral-rich plant [[fertilizer]]. The latter method can result in an effectively carbon-negative system, as well as acting as a very effective soil conditioner, enhancing water and nutrient retention in poor soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chalker-Scott|first=Linda|date=December 2007|title=Impact of Mulches on Landscape Plants and the Environment - A Review|url=http://extension.oregonstate.edu/lane/sites/default/files/documents/soileffectsofmulching.pdf|journal=Journal of Environmental Horticulture|volume=25|pages=239–249|via=Oregon State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Automated handling of solid fuel ====
Unlike the smooth, uniform shape of manufactured [[wood pellets]], woodchip sizes vary and are often mixed with twigs and sawdust. This mixture has a higher probability of jamming in small feed mechanisms. Thus, sooner or later, one or more jams is likely to occur. This reduces the reliability of the system, as well as increasing maintenance costs. Despite what some pellet stove manufacturers may say, researchers who are experienced with woodchips, say they are not compatible with the 2&amp;nbsp;inch (5&amp;nbsp;cm) auger used in pellet stoves.&lt;ref name="VTHR Green wood Chip Furnace" /&gt;

==== Micro combined heat and power ====
{{Main|Micro combined heat and power}}
Wood is occasionally used to power engines, such as [[steam engines]], [[Stirling engines]], and [[Otto engines]] running on [[woodgas]]. As of 2008, these systems are rare, but as technology and the need for it develops, it is likely to be more common in the future.  For the time being, wood can be increasingly used for heating applications. This will reduce the demand for heating oil, and thereby allow a greater percentage of fuel oil to be used for applications such as [[internal combustion engines]], which are less compatible with wood based fuel and other solid biomass fuels. Heating applications generally do not require refined or processed fuels, which are almost always more expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=December 2010|title=Biomass|url=https://corporate.vattenfall.com/globalassets/corporate/about_vattenfall/research_and_development/r-d_magazine_december_2010.pdf|journal=Vattenfall Research and Development Magazine|volume=4|pages=1–20|via=Vattenfall Corporate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Comparison to other fuels ====
Woodchips are similar to [[wood pellets]], in that the movement and handling is more amenable to automation than cord wood, particularly for smaller systems. Woodchips are less expensive to produce than wood pellets, which must be processed in specialized facilities. While avoiding the costs associated with refinement, the lower [[density]] and higher moisture content of woodchips reduces their [[calorific value]], substantially increasing the feedstock needed to generate an equivalent amount of heat. Greater physical volume requirements also increase the expense and emissions impact of trucking, storing and/or shipping the wood.

Woodchips are less expensive than [[cord wood]], because the harvesting is faster and more highly automated. Woodchips are of greater supply, partly because all parts of a tree can be chipped, whereas small limbs and branches can require substantial labor to convert to cord wood. Cord wood generally needs to be "seasoned" or "dry" before it can be burned cleanly and efficiently. On the other hand, woodchip systems are typically designed to cleanly and efficiently burn "green chips" with very high moisture content of 43–47% (wet basis).&lt;ref name="VTHR Green wood Chip Furnace" /&gt;  (see [[gasification]] and [[woodgas]])

== Environmental aspects ==
Compared to conventional timber harvesting, woodchip harvesting has a greater impact on the environment, since a larger proportion of biomass is removed.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.videncenter.dk/Groenne%20trae%20haefte/Groen_Engelsk/Kap_05.pdf|title=Environmental Issues During the Production and Handling of Wood Fuels|date=March 2004|website=Videncenter|access-date=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased use of woodchips can have negative effects on the stability and long-term growth of the forests in which they're removed from. For instance, chipping of trees from forests has been shown to increase the removal of plant nutrients and organic matter from an ecosystem, thereby reducing both the nutrients and humus content of the soil.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; One option to balance the negative effects of woodchip harvesting is to return the woodchip ash to the forest which would restore some of the lost nutrients back into the soil.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

If woodchips are harvested as a by-product of [[sustainable]] forestry practices, then this is considered a source of [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=November 1999|title=Large Scale Power Generation Using Forestry and Wood Industry By Products|url=http://www.ieaghg.org/docs/General_Docs/Reports/PH3_11%20-%20Wood%20industry%20wastes%20for%20power%20gen.pdf|journal=IEA Greenhouse Gas R&amp;D Programme|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, harvesting practices, such as [[clear cutting|clearcutting]] large areas, are highly damaging to forest [[ecosystem]]s.

Theoretically, whole-tree chip harvesting does not have as high a [[solar energy]] efficiency compared to [[short rotation coppice]]; however, it can be an energy-efficient and low-cost method of harvesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dou|first=Chang|last2=Marcondes|first2=Wilian F.|last3=Djaja|first3=Jessica E.|last4=Bura|first4=Renata|last5=Gustafson|first5=Rick|date=2017-06-05|title=Can we use short rotation coppice poplar for sugar based biorefinery feedstock? Bioconversion of 2-year-old poplar grown as short rotation coppice|journal=Biotechnology for Biofuels|volume=10|doi=10.1186/s13068-017-0829-6|pmc=5460468|pmid=28592993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, this practice may be controversial when whole-tree harvesting may often be associated with clear cutting and perhaps other questionable forestry practices.

=== Waste processing ===
Woodchips and bark chips can be used as bulking agents in [[industrial composting]] of municipal [[biodegradeable]] waste, particularly [[biosolids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malinska|first=Krystyna|last2=Zabochnick|first2=A-Swiatek|date=2013|title=SELECTION OF BULKING AGENTS FOR COMPOSTING OF SEWAGE SLUDGE|url=http://epe.pwr.wroc.pl/2013/2-2013/Malinska_2-2013.pdf|journal=Environment Protection Engineering|volume=39|pages=91–103|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodchip biomass does not have the waste disposal issues of coal and nuclear power, since wood ash can be used directly as a mineral-rich plant fertilizer.

=== Forest fire prevention ===
Woodchip harvesting can be used in concert with creating man made [[firebreak]]s, which are used as barriers to the spread of [[wildfire]]. Undergrowth coppice is ideal for chipping, and larger trees may be left in place to shade the forest floor and reduce the rate of fuel accumulation.

== Market products, supply and demand ==
Currently, domestic or residential sized systems are not available in products for sale on the general market. Homemade devices have been produced, that are small-scale, clean-burning, and efficient for woodchip fuels. Much of the research activity to date, has consisted of small budget projects that are self-funded. The majority of funding for energy research has been for liquid [[biofuels]].

=== United States ===
Woodchip costs usually depend on such factors as the distance from the point of delivery, the type of material (such as bark, sawmill residue or whole-tree chips), demand by other markets and how the wood fuel is transported. Chips delivered directly to the (powerplant) station by truck are less expensive than those delivered ... and shipped by railcar. The range of prices is typically between US$18 to US$30 per (wet)-ton delivered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burlingtonelectric.com/specialtopics/mcneil.htm  Woodchip price factors for a power Generating Station in Burlington, VT, US] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410180748/http://www.burlingtonelectric.com/SpecialTopics/Mcneil.htm |date=2008-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, prices were US$15 and US$30 per wet-ton in the northeast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sredmond.com/vthr_index.htm Vermont Heat Research – An Experimental Wood Chip Furnace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119075105/http://www.sredmond.com/vthr_index.htm |date=2008-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20 years leading up to 2008, prices have fluctuated between US$60–70/oven-dry metric ton (odmt) in the southern states, and between US$60/odmt and US$160/odmt in the Northwest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forestnewswire.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=118:first-quarter-wood-chip-costs-up-almost-50-in-western-us-but-pulpmills-in-the-us-south-experienced-only-small-upward-price-adjustments&amp;catid=1:latest First quarter wood chip costs up almost 50% in western US, but pulpmills in the US South experienced only small upward price adjustments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211174013/http://forestnewswire.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=118:first-quarter-wood-chip-costs-up-almost-50-in-western-us-but-pulpmills-in-the-us-south-experienced-only-small-upward-price-adjustments&amp;catid=1:latest |date=2012-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
Wood chips have been used as a source of single-dwelling heating in Canada since the early days of settling but the development of oil and natural gas has dramatically decreased its usage. Most of the wood chip usage is by installations such as schools, hospitals and prisons.  Prince Edward Island (PEI) has the most wood-chip plants due to high electricity rates and subsidies from the federal government. Nova Scotia has a 2.5 MW wood chip burning system that provides power to a textile factory as well as systems that provide power to a poultry processing plant, two hospitals and an agricultural college.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Consulting Services|first=Flann|date=April 2018|title=Woodchip Combustion in Eastern Canada|url=https://www.reap-canada.com/online_library/agri_fibres_forestry/29%20Woodchip%20Combustion.pdf|journal=R.E.A.P. Canada|volume=|pages=1–33|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of New Brunswick operates a wood chip burning furnace system to supply heat to the university, several industrial buildings, an apartment complex and a hospital.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Usage of wood chips for heat is low in Quebec due to low hydroelectricity rates but a small town is using wood chips as an alternative to road salt for icy roads. EMC3 Technologies started producing wood chips coated with magnesium chloride in November 2017 for the town and has claimed it maintains traction in -30 degrees Celsius compared to regular road salt at -15 degrees Celsius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/rosemere-wood-chips-1.4499146|title=Quebec town swaps out salt for eco-friendly wood chips on icy roads {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ontario, wood chip operations include a college in Brockville, a few secondary schools in Northern Ontario as well as a chip-fired boiler at the National Forestry Institute in Petawawa.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In the late 1980’s, the Ontario provincial government in conjunction with the federal government subsidized building three co-generation plants next to sawmills. The first one was constructed in 1987 in Chapleau followed by a plant built in Cochrane in 1989 and the largest one in Kirkland Lake which was built in 1991.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Europe ===
[[File:Forsthäcksler Hubertushof.jpg|right|thumb|Large wood chipper in Germany]]
In several well wooded European countries (e.g. Austria, Finland, Germany, Sweden) woodchips are becoming an alternative fuel for family homes and larger buildings due to the abundant availability of woodchips, which result in low fuel costs. The European Union is promoting woodchips for energy production in the EU Forest action plan 2007–2011. The total long term potential of woodchips in the EU is estimated to be 913 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Yanez et al 2013" /&gt;

=== Japan ===
After a long period of negative scores, the demand of woodchips for paper manufacturing started increasing again. Starting in the last quarter of 2013, orders for printing paper and card board increased before the consumption tax increase then by weakening yen, import of papers like copy paper decreases and export of paper increases, which stimulate paper production in Japan. Softwood chip prices from the United States increased by 12% compared to October 2013 and softwood chip prices from Australia increased by 7%.&lt;ref name="Fordaq"&gt;{{Cite news
