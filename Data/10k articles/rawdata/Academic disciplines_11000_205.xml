'''9-slice scaling''' (also known as '''Scale 9 grid''' or '''9-slicing''') is a 2D image resizing technique to proportionally scale an image by splitting it in a grid of nine parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lynda.com/Illustrator-tutorials/9-slice-scaling-explained/135243/149344-4.html|title=9-slice scaling explained|website=Lynda.com - from LinkedIn|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key idea is to prevent [[image scaling]] distortion by protecting the pixels defined in 4 parts (corners) of the image and scaling or repeating the pixels in the other 5 parts. 

A variation of the concept, the 3-slice scaling, consists in a grid of 3 parts in which only the pixels in 2 parts (the edges) are protected and the pixels on the middle part are repeated.

== History and use ==
The concept was first introduced in a consumer application by [[Macromedia]] in [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] 8 (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/8/releasenotes.html|title=Macromedia - Flash : Flash 8 Release Notes|website=www.adobe.com|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was available as feature to scale symbols. Later on, in 2007 Adobe introduced it as a feature in [[Adobe Fireworks]] CS3&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/archive/fireworks/articles/9-slice_scaling.html|title=Improved 9-slice scaling in Fireworks|website=www.adobe.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Adobe Illustrator]], and [[Adobe Flash]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1057744/flashcs3.html|title=Flash CS3 Professional|first1=David |last1=Karlins|date=May 7, 2007
|website=Macworld|language=en|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Today is also present as a feature of game development software like [[Unreal Engine|Unreal engine]], Urho3D, and [[Unity (game engine)|Unity 3D]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/9SliceSprites.html|title=Unity - Manual: 9-slicing Sprites|last=Technologies|first=Unity|website=docs.unity3d.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The technique can be used to manipulate both [[Raster graphics|bitmap/raster graphics]] and [[vector graphics]]. A current implementation of the 9-slice technique is present on the [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] 3 Backgrounds and Borders spec&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/|title=CSS Backgrounds and Borders Module Level 3|last=Bos|first=Bert|last2=Etemad|first2=Elika J.|date=2014-09-09|website=www.w3.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-08|last3=Kemper|first3=Brad}}&lt;/ref&gt; by using the ''border-image'' property.

== Background ==

=== History ===
Agroecological methods have been practiced in Latin America for centuries, but the term agroecology in reference to the combination of [[agronomy]] and [[ecology]] was coined in 1928 by B.M. Bensin in the U.S.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Wezel A. et al. "Agroecology as a science, a movement and a practice. A review."''Agronomy for Sustainable Development.''Vol. 29, Iss. 4, (2009): 503–515.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 1960s, it mainly focused on the scientific aspects of agronomy and ecology and remained relatively unknown.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, due to the increasing awareness of the harmful effects of pesticides and the burgeoning [[environmental movement]] in the1970s, agroecology gained momentum globally and began to integrate a much wider range of issues on top of ecological ones, such as the social, political, economic implications of agroecosystems. In this context, the scientific aspect of agroecology began to engage in dialogue with traditional local farming practices and experimentation in many regions.&lt;ref&gt;Pimbert, M. "Agroecology as an alternative vision to conventional development and climate-smart agriculture." ''Society for International Development,'' 58(2-3), (2015): 286-298. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between agronomists and traditional practitioners, often [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farmers]], has been termed an "exchange of wisdoms." This recognizes that science is an important way of knowing and mode of discovery, while local knowledge systems developed over thousands of years have just as much to offer.

In Latin America specifically, agroecology spread more widely during the period of structural adjustment policies in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In this time, many Latin American countries took up loans from the [[International Monetary Fund]] with strict conditions of [[Trade-liberalization|trade liberalization]] that allowed large transnational corporations to [[Land grabbing|grab]] huge swaths of [[Land grabbing|land]] and out-compete local markets.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;SOCLA, Sociedad Científica Latinoamericana de Agroecología“The role of Agroecology on the future of agriculture and the food system.” ''Latin American Scientific Society of Agroecology,'' (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; While many small farmers have been marginalized, many others have joined together to form cooperatives, social movements, and global organizations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Rosset, P. M., and M. E. Martínez-Torres. (2012). ''Rural social movements and agroecology: context, theory, and process.'' Ecology and Society 17(3): 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the ongoing work of these [[social movement]]s, agroecology has grown to mean more than just the combination of agronomy and ecology; it has come to involve many farmers, researchers, practitioners, and advocates, on a global scale, with a particularly strong presence in Latin America.

== Benefits ==
Traditional farming systems of Latin America were forged from a need to subsist on limited means. These techniques were developed from centuries of cultural and biological evolution by combining experiences and methods of other peasant farmers using locally available resources.&lt;ref name="Solis-Montero,Lislie 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solis-Montero | first1 = Lislie | last2 = Flores-Palacios | first2 = Alejandro | last3 = Cruz-Angon | first3 = Andrea | year = 2004 | title = Shade-Coffee Plantations as Refuges for Tropical Wild Orchids in Central Veracruz, Mexico | doi = 10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00482.x | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 19| issue = 3| pages = 908–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to its origins Latin American, agroecology represents a low impact form of agriculture. Modern agriculture had become a process of "artificialization of nature" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Altieri | first1 = Miguel A | year = 2000 | title = Multifunctional Dimensions of Ecologically-based Agriculture in Latin America | url = | journal = International Journal of Sustainable Development &amp; World Ecology | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 62–75 | doi=10.1080/13504500009470029}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing a monoculture of a very few crop species. Agroecology contrasts industrial agriculture in its use of [[polyculture]], lack of synthetic fertilizers, minimal machinery and incorporation of successional stages. Agroecology attempts to benefit both people and the environment by maximizing crop yield, but also preserving the natural environment. It is often practiced by forming agroecosystems which are communities of plants and animals interacting with their physical and chemical environment that have been planted and harvested by people.&lt;ref name="Altieri,Miguel 2002"/&gt;

=== Economic benefits ===
Agroecological principles allow farmers to save many in several important ways: becoming independent from large corporations' inputs such as GMO seeds and fertilizers; having a more diversified and thus more resilient crop system where income does not depend on one single crop; using simple, cost-effective techniques to increase productivity; having solidarity markets with local communities and thus a steady source of income; having a democratized method of knowledge and seed exchange.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Altieri, M. (1999). Applying agroecology to enhance the productivity of peasant farming systems in Latin America. ''Environment, Development and Sustainability'' 197–217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific examples of economically successful agroecological systems include stabilizing hillside farming in [[Honduras]]. [[World Neighbors]], an NGO, partnered with Honduran farmers to implement a program that helped practice soil conservation using techniques such as drainage and contour ditches, grass barriers, rock walls, and [[Organic fertilizer|organic fertilization]] (e.g., use of [[Poultry litter|chicken manure]] and [[intercropping]] with legumes).&lt;ref name="Altieri,Miguel 1998" /&gt; These changes allowed for an increase in grain yield of three to four times more than in previous years as well as supplied 1,200 families with grain.

Another example, from the Andean region in Peru where a partnership of NGOs and locals lead to the  implementation of a Pre-Columbian indigenous technique called [[Waru Waru]]s. This technique involved raising the fields and surrounding them with dug out ditches filled with water, which regulates the soil temperature allowing for an extended growing season. In the district of Huatta, this method of using waru-warus have increased annual potato yields by 4-10 metric tons per hectare.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, Micheal 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steinberg | first1 = Michael K | year = 1998 | title = Neotropical Kitchen Gardens as a Potential Research Landscape for Conservation Biologists | url = | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 5| pages = 1150–152 | doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1998.98086.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A final example from the Andean region where some peasant communities in [[Cajamarca]] and NGOs planted more than 550,000 trees and reconstructed terraces as well as drainage and infiltration canals.This change allowed for about half the population in the area - 1,247 families - to have land under conservation measures. For these people, potato yields have increased from 5 to 8 tons per hectare and oca ([[wood sorrel]]) yields have jumped from 3 to 8 tons per hectare.&lt;ref name="Altieri,Miguel 1998"/&gt; [[File:Intercropping coffee tomatoes.jpg|thumb|Intercropping coffee and tomatoes]]

=== Ecological benefits ===
The benefits of agroecology are not only economic, but also vitally important ecologically. There is evidence to indicate that the agroecosystems with overstory shade trees like coffee or cacao plantations can rival the biodiversity of natural forests.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, Micheal 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erwin | first1 = T.L. | last2 = Scott | first2 = J.C. | year = 1980 | title = Seasonal and size patterns, trophic structure, and richness of coleoptera in the tropical arboreal ecosystem: the fauna of the tree Leubea seemannii Triana and Planch in the Canal Zone of Panama | url = | journal = Coleopterist Bulletin | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 305–322 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Estrada | first1 = A. | last2 = Coates-Estrada | first2 = R. | last3 = Merrit Jr | first3 = D. | year = 1993 | title = Bat species richness and abundance in tropical rainforest fragments and in agricultural habitats at Los Tuxtlas, Mexico | url = | journal = Ecography | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 309–318 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0587.1993.tb00220.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity is so high in these systems because the overstory is structurally and floristically complex&lt;ref name="Perfecto, Ivette 1996"/&gt; which allows for many different niches to be available resulting in refuges. It is possible that shade coffee plantations are already serving as refuges, as seen in Puerto Rico where tremendous deforestation has occurred and yet the avian extinction rate is relatively low.&lt;ref name="Perfecto, Ivette 1996"/&gt; Another system that is ecologically important is neotropical kitchen gardens. Kitchen gardens or home gardens are common in tropical and subtropical areas and they provide food and income for the family.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, Micheal 1998"/&gt; Some kitchen gardens like the Mopan Mayan of southern Belize contain dozens of tree and plant species of different stories mimicking a natural forest.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, Micheal 1998"/&gt; These patches, much like shade plantations, serve as refuges for flora and fauna such as in Belize where they are used by migratory birds.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, Micheal 1998"/&gt;

Agroecological farms and methods also contribute to reducing the effects of climate change as they have more plants and thus greater carbon sequestration as well as limited emissions from farm management and crop transportation. Agroecology in Latin America also includes many ecological areas such as water conservation, soil health, and maintaining seed diversity, among others.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;La ViaCampesina's Brochure. Web. October 20. 2017. viacampesina.org https://viacampesina.org/en/la-via-campesina-organisational-brochure-edition-2016/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social benefits ===
The principles of agroecology are also integrally cultural and social. Agroecology is the “transformation of rural realities through collective action” for the goal of food sovereignty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus it is not just science and principles, but also a practice, which produces many social benefits as it is a combination of efforts between farmers, social movements, scientists, and NGOs, as well as occasionally local governments.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Altieri, M &amp; Toledo V.M. (2011). The agroecological revolution in Latin America: rescuing nature, ensuring food sovereignty and empowering peasants. The Journal of Peasant Studies 38:3: 587–612&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Food sovereignty]] is a core component of agroecology that increases social power. The definition of food sovereignty as defined by [[Via Campesina|La Via Campesina]], the social movement that articulated it, is the following:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Food sovereignty is the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through sustainable methods and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems. It develops a model of small scale sustainable production benefiting communities and their environment. Food sovereignty prioritizes local food production and consumption, giving a country the right to protect its local producers from cheap imports and to control its production. It includes the struggle for land and genuine agrarian reform that ensures that the rights to use and manage lands, territories, water, seeds, livestock, and biodiversity are in the hands of those who produce food and not of the corporate sector." &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thus, when communities, NGOs and the public move beyond the view of food security, i.e. having enough to eat, and transition to the framework of food sovereignty, much more progress can be made in ensuring people's well-being.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Chappell MJ, Wittman H, Bacon CM et al. (2013). Food sovereignty: an alternative paradigm for poverty reduction and biodiversity conservation in Latin America. ''F1000Research'' 2:235.&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers are no longer trapped in debt cycles as a result of constant expenditures on industrial agricultural inputs sold by a few large corporations. Rather they have control over how their food is produced, what is produced, and where it is sold, which must primarily be in local markets. Thus consumers also have close ties to the production process, in addition to always having a dependable source of food.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A key component of the agroecological method used to achieve food sovereignty is campesino-a-campesino, or farmer-to-farmer knowledge exchange, which is an effective way to strengthen social relations within and between communities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Similarly, the collaboration between researchers from universities and farmer research projects allows farmers to have greater social standing than in industrial agriculture where they are simply told what to do.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additionally, indigenous customs and knowledge are highly valued, whereas they have historically been considered irrelevant by most agronomists and "development experts".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Through the innovative agroecological techniques that produce a higher and more diverse overall crop yield than industrial agriculture, small-scale farmers are able to be self-sufficient and at the same time produce excess to sell in local "solidarity markets," i.e. places where they have loyal customers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is an effective form of poverty reduction because the greatest cause of poverty in rural Latin America is not having enough income from crops.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With agroecological methods such as crop diversification, crops are much more resistant to drastic and unexpected effects of climate change, thus farmers' livelihoods are less vulnerable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Another important social benefit is the part of agroecology that emphasizes agrarian reform, i.e. transitioning back to small-scale farms where farmers own their land vs. being workers on large, corporate owned industrial farms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Social movements in Brazil such as the [[Landless Workers' Movement]] (MST) have successfully re-acquired land for subsistence farmers and farmer cooperatives.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Fernandes, B.M. (2009). ''The MST and Agrarian Reform in Brazil.'' Socialism and Democracy. 23:3, 90-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role of social movements ==
Social movements play a paramount role in the movement of agroecology in Latin America, which emerged in the scene of growing neoliberal globalization beginning in the 1970s. In this period, trans-national corporations began dominating the agricultural sector, causing artificial food shortages, excess dependence on imports and agricultural inputs, and exacerbating existing poverty.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It was in response to these effects that many social movements in Latin America formed.

One of the most prominent movements is [[Via Campesina|La Via Campesina]], an umbrella organization that connects many local farmer groups and movements. It began in 1993 when farmer representatives from four continents convened in their first conference, with many representatives from Latin America.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; it is now present in 73 coutries all over the world, representing around 200 million farmers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; La Via Campesina was the first to define food sovereignty at the World Food Summit in 1996.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It began by demanding land for farmers through occupations, but soon expanded its goals to a much wider range of issues.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Rosset, Peter. (2013). ''Re-thinking agrarian reform, land and territory in La Via Campesina''. The Journal of Peasant Studies. 40:4, 721-775.&lt;/ref&gt; Now its main goals are: defending food sovereignty, struggle for land and agrarian reforms; promoting agroecology and defending local seeds; promoting peasant rights and struggle against criminalization of peasants.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It has also expanded its work to increasing communication and consensus with other users of land, conducting research, expanding its organizations that deal with legal support for occupations, and confronting negative stereotypes of occupations in the public eye.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; They hold an International Conference every four years, which is "the movement’s highest body for political discussion and decision-making, where future actions and agendas are defined." &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There have been such conferences since 1993, guiding the many other networks of action that members engage in around the world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Another large movement is the [[Landless Workers' Movement|Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra]], or MST in Brazil. MST has been and continues to be one of the largest peasant-lead forces that drive agrarian reform. During the time of Presidents Lula and Cardoso, who prioritized agribusiness, little progress was made.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; But MST’s alliance with La Via Campesina and its fight for agrarian reform explicitly tied to territorial issues still makes it a major driver in these questions: anywhere where there was successful reform, MST—the peasants themselves—were involved. Paradoxically, however, although MST and other organizations are relatively successful in acquiring land, simultaneously large agribusinesses are grabbing pieces of land from the Amazon.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In general, there are several trends present in Latin American peasant social movements.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Vergara-Camus, L. (2013) ''Rural Social Movements in Latin America: In the Eye of the Storm.'' Journal of Agrarian Change, Vol. 13 No. 4, pp. 590–606.&lt;/ref&gt; First, peasants have developed a political consciousness and identity even across borders. Second, they share the conviction that small scale agroecological practices actually have higher efficiency, resilience to climate change, and increased food security and sovereignty. Third, they engage in five major battles against [[agribusiness]]es:

* control of nature for sustainable local use
* the right of smallholder farmers to produce for livelihood and communities around them not for profit
* the fight for food sovereignty
* keeping GMO seeds out and allowing their own control of genetic diversity
* making production and market networks sustain the local needs.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Role of research ==
Hand in hand with the work of social movements is the work of researchers at various universities throughout Latin America. There are now many agroecology departments throughout the continent, although they often struggle with limited funding and resources compared to large agronomy departments. One example of an organization that promotes agroecological research alongside dialogue with farmers is the [https://www.socla.co/en/ Sociedad Cientifica Latinoamericana de Agroecologia] (SOCLA), or Latin American Scientific Society of Agroecology. SOCLA organizes conferences every year in various locations in Latin America, where farmers, students, and researchers share knowledge, seeds, practices, and formulate strategies for the future.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Examples by method ==

=== Shade Coffee ===
[[Shade-grown coffee]] is an ecologically and economically important agroecosystem in which coffee plants are grown in the understory of a [[Canopy (biology)|tree canopy]]. The shade of the canopy over the coffee shrubs encourages natural ecological processes and [[species diversity]]. These shade coffee plantations are in many Latin American countries including Brazil, Mexico, Belize and Guatemala. Shade coffee growers maintain complex coffee [[Agroforestry|agroforests]] in which they produce coffee and manage the area's [[Biota (ecology)|biota]].

Shade coffee differs from the industrial open sun coffee plantations that increase faster coffee growth and reduce costs but result in decreased biota resources, refuge, [[Nutrient cycle|nutrient cycling]] and increased broken terrain and soil erosion.&lt;ref name="Franzen,M 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Franzen | first1 = M. | last2 = Borgerhoff Mulder | first2 = M. | year = 2007 | title = Ecological, Economic And Social Perspectives On Cocoa Production Worldwide | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-007-9183-5 | journal = Biodiversity and Conservation | volume = 16| issue = 13| pages = 3835–3849 | doi=10.1007/s10531-007-9183-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have been done in Latin America to prove the biological importance of shade coffee. In 1996, a scientific journal discussed the evolving industrial coffee plantation effects on Northern Latin American countries. Areas of high deforestation where traditional shade coffee methods are used have been found to be a crucial refuge for many biota. Another study in Veracruz, Mexico on shade coffee ecological relationships found that areas of lower [[cloud forest]] that are now coffee plantations are also a microclimate for native [[Orchidaceae|orchids]] and [[pollinators]].&lt;ref name="Solis-Montero,Lislie 2004"/&gt;[[File:Coffee shadow trees costa rica.jpg|thumb|Coffee shadow trees Costa Rica]]

=== Cabrucas ===
A cabruca is an agroforestry system found in the Latin American countries of Belize, Mexico, Ecuador, Peru, Costa Rica and Brazil.&lt;ref name="Franzen,M 2007"/&gt; These cabrucas, largely run by smallholder farmers, are the production locations for cacao trees that grow underneath the canopy of mixed native trees. This forest canopy like the shade coffee has been found to provide a diverse ecosystem. An example of the biological importance of cabrucas can be found in Brazil’s main cacao production region Southern [[Bahia|Bahia, Brazil]]. A 2008 study of biodiversity conservation in cacao regions found that the cabrucas in Southern Bahia are used by a significant amount of native flora and fauna. Due to parts of the region experiencing high deforestation and fragmentation, these cabrucas are providing habitat, fragment connection, and [[Edge effects|edge effect]] reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cassano | first1 = Camila R. | last2 = Schroth | first2 = Götz | last3 = Faria | first3 = Deborah | last4 = Delabie | first4 = Jacques H.

== Examples by country ==

=== Cuba ===
Cuba is an extremely unique example of successful agroecological transformation on a national level. In the beginning of the 20th century, Cuba was devastated socially and ecologically by industrial agro-inputs and chemicals and northern crop dumping, but the socialist revolution did not change that as large-scale industrial agriculture was still prioritized. Thus, once Cuba reached a crisis in the 1990s, it was determined to restructure its food system to emphasize smaller farms, local production, national and local self-sufficiency and food sovereignty.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Funes-Monzote, F.R., Monzote, M., Lantinga, E.A. Van Keulen, H. (2009). ''Conversion of specialised Dairy Farming Systems into sustainable Mixed Farming Systems in Cuba. Environment, Development and Sustainability.'' 11, 765-783.&lt;/ref&gt; What followed was what is now known as Cuba's agroecological revolution, where small-scale farmers now produce more than 65% domestic food using only 25% of the country's land, most using agroecological methods.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Its success lies in the dynamic grassroots organization of peasants with other peasants. These improvements in organization and adoption of agroecological methods over time have increased productivity dramatically, and thus also food sovereignty, as well as resilience to climate change.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Rosset, P.M. et al. (2011). ''The Campesino-to-Campesino agroecology movement of ANAP in Cuba: social process methodology in the construction of sustainable peasant agriculture and food sovereignty''.

An estimated $110 million of art was lost in the [[September 11 attacks]]: $100 million in private art&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite news |date=11 October 2001 |title=A museum in the sky |url= http://www.economist.com/node/814452 |work= The Economist |access-date= 1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $10 million in public art.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news |date=16 October 2001 |title=Lost Art Hundreds of Works Were Destroyed in the Trade Center Attack |url= https://www.npr.org/news/specials/response/home_front/features/2001/oct/011016.lostart.html|work=National Public Radio |access-date= 1 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attacks were said to be "the biggest single disaster ever to affect the [art] industry".&lt;ref name= "BBC"&gt;{{cite news |date= 5 October 2001|title='Up to' $100m art lost in attacks |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1581737.stm|work= BBC |location= |access-date= 1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Port Authority]] held an estimated 100 pieces of art work at the World Trade Center Complex, in addition to the seven public works of art that had been created for the World Trade Center, all of which were destroyed or severely damaged.

==Public art==
An estimated $10 million worth of public art was lost due to the collapse of the World Trade Center.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;

There were seven one-of-a-kind public works of art in the World Trade Center Complex at the time of the attacks:
* ''[[Cloud Fortress]]'' by [[Masayuki Nagare]]
* ''[[The Sphere]]'' by [[Fritz Koenig]]
* ''[[Ideogram (sculpture)|Ideogram]]'' by [[James Rosati]]
* ''[[Bent Propeller]]'' by [[Alexander Calder]]
* ''[[The World Trade Center Tapestry]]'' by [[Joan Miró]] and [[Josep Royo]]
* ''[[Sky Gate, New York]]'' by [[Louise Nevelson]]
* ''[[1993 bombing memorial fountain]]'' by [[Elyn Zimmerman]]

''Ideogram'', ''The World Trade Center Tapestry'', and ''Sky Gate, New York'' were never recovered from the rubble and are presumed destroyed.

''Cloud Fortress'' survived the attack and collapse of the buildings, but was severely damaged and subsequently cleared by rescue workers in the days after the attacks.

''Bent Propeller'' was partially recovered from the rubble. Only a small piece of the 1993 bombing memorial fountain was recovered.

''The Sphere'' was damaged in the attacks, but was refurbished and put on display as a memorial.

In addition to the seven public art works, the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|Port Authority]] also had approximately 100 pieces of art on the complex, including:
* ''Recollection Pond'', a tapestry by [[Romare Bearden]] [https://www.artsy.net/artwork/romare-bearden-recollection-pond]
* ''Path Mural'' by [[Germaine Keller]] 
* ''Commuter Landscape'', a mural by [[Cynthia Mailman]] [https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS819US819&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=HAnVW72aGLOBk-4PrK6y0A0&amp;q=Commuter+Landscape%27%27%2C+Cynthia+Mailman&amp;oq=Commuter+Landscape%27%27%2C+Cynthia+Mailman&amp;gs_l=img.3...237130.239714..239971...0.0..0.53.201.4......0....1..gws-wiz-img.ZPQZa0LSbYc#imgrc=fvRcqYJKJc6E2M:]

==Private art collections==
The World Trade Center alone held more than 430 tenants at the time of the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/trade.center/tenants1.html |title=List of World Trade Center tenants|website=cnn.com |publisher=CNN |access-date= 1 December 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the decorative art that each office contained, some firms held large corporate art collections.

Three companies held major corporate art collections in the World Trade Center: Fred Alger, Cantor Fitzgerald, and Bank of America. Aside from these three, all other companies in the World trade center kept their artwork in other locations.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;

===Cantor Fitzgerald===
In addition to losing the most lives in the attack, [[Cantor Fitzgerald]] lost the most artwork. Their offices on the 105th floor of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|North Tower]] housed a gallery called the “Museum in the Sky” which held an estimated 300 casts of [[Rodin]] sculptures.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;

Some of the Rodin works were recovered a quarter mile away from Ground Zero, including a bust from ''[[The Burghers of Calais]]'', two of the three figures from ''The Three Shades'', and a cast of ''[[The Thinker]]''. After being recovered, ''The Thinker'' cast went missing, possibly due to theft.&lt;ref name="Born" /&gt;

===Citigroup===
The collection of Citigroup, whose office was in [[List of tenants in 7 World Trade Center|
World Trade Center Building 7]], contained 1113 works of art which were all lost on September 11, 2001, according to Suzanne F. W. Lemakis who was the Citigroup Art Curator at the time of the attacks.&lt;ref name="Citigroup1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ifar.org/nineeleven/911_citi1.htm |title=

The Citigroup collection at the World Trade Center consisted of about 75% prints, many of which were mass-produced and were replaceable. Also lost were English and American antique furniture, and Asian porcelains.&lt;ref name="Citigroup2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ifar.org/nineeleven/911_citi2.htm |title=

According to Lemakis, the most expensive painting in Citigroup’s collection was a large mural depicting Wall Street, painted by an unknown designer.&lt;ref name="Citigroup2" /&gt;

===Fred Alger===
Also located in the North Tower, this firm lost a collection of photographs by photographers including [[Cindy Sherman]] and [[Hiroshi Sugimoto]].&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;

===Bank of America===
Bank of America’s office in the World Trade Center lost over 100 works of art by contemporary artists.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;

===J.P. Morgan Chase=== 
At the time of the attack, the firm had only five lithographs in its Trade Center office, keeping most of its corporate art collection of over 17,000 works of art at its offices two blocks from the World Trade Center.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Born"&gt;{{cite news |last1= Barry|first1=Dan |last2= Rashbaum|first2=William K.|date= 20 May 2002|title=Born of Hell, Lost After Inferno; Rodin Work From Trade Center Survived, and Vanished |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/20/nyregion/born-hell-lost-after-inferno-rodin-work-trade-center-survived-vanished.html|work= New York Times|location= New York City|access-date=1 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art studios in the World Trade Center==
The Lower Manhattan Cultural Council had its offices in Building 5 of the World Trade Center, and two studios on the 91st and 92nd floors of [[The North Tower]].  
The Council hosted an artist-in-residency program, called World Views, which hosted 15 artists from around the globe and was supposed to run from May–November 2001. The 15 artists worked in the studios in the North Tower. Nearly all of their artwork was lost in the attack on and subsequent collapse of the towers. At least one of the artists, Jamaican-born sculptor Michael Richards, also died in the attacks. Richards had worked through the night in the towers on an unfinished sculpture, a memorial piece dedicated to the [[Tuskegee Airmen]], which portrayed a pilot riding a burning meteor.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cotter"&gt;{{cite news |last= Cotter|first=Holland |date= 3 December 2001|title=ART REVIEW; The Studios Were Lost, But the Artists Get Their Day |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/03/arts/art-review-the-studios-were-lost-but-the-artists-get-their-day.html|work= New York Times|location= New York City|access-date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "BBC" /&gt;

The council also lost all of its archives that had been in their offices in Building 5.&lt;ref name="Cotter" /&gt;

==Government art collections==
Twenty-four works from the art collections of the [[Army]], [[Navy]], [[Air Force]], and [[Marine Corps]] were destroyed at [[The Pentagon]] by the attack.

Some works from The Pentagon's library were also damaged, but the majority were ultimately restored.&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite news |last1= Bridge|first1=Sarah |last2=Kazi |first2=Stastna|date=21 August 2011 |title= 9/11 anniversary: What was lost in the damage|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/9-11-anniversary-what-was-lost-in-the-damage-1.1123528 |work=CBC |access-date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insurance payouts==
Much of the art was not insured for its full value.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8978">In [[statistical physics]], the '''BBGKY hierarchy''' ('''Bogoliubov–Born–Green–Kirkwood–Yvon hierarchy''', sometimes called '''Bogoliubov hierarchy''') is a set of equations describing the dynamics of a system of a large number of interacting particles. The equation for an ''s''-particle [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]] (probability density function) in the BBGKY hierarchy includes the (''s''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-particle distribution function thus forming a coupled chain of equations. This formal theoretic result is named after [[Nikolay Bogolyubov|Bogoliubov]], [[Max Born|Born]], [[Herbert S. Green|Green]], [[John Gamble Kirkwood|Kirkwood]], and [[Jacques Yvon|Yvon]].

==Formulation==
The evolution of an ''N''-particle system in absence of [[quantum fluctuations]] is given by the [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville equation]] for the probability density function &lt;math&gt;f_N = f_N(\mathbf{q}_1\dots\mathbf{q}_N, \mathbf{p}_1 \dots \mathbf{p}_N, t)&lt;/math&gt; in ''6N'' dimensional phase space (3 space and 3 momentum coordinates per particle)

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial f_N}{\partial t} + \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\mathbf{p}_i}{m} \frac{\partial f_N}{\partial \mathbf{q}_i} + \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{F}_i \frac{\partial f_N}{\partial \mathbf{p}_i} = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}_i, \mathbf{p}_i&lt;/math&gt; are the coordinates and momentum for &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; particle with mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and the net force acting on the ith particle is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_i = -\sum_{j=1\neq i}^N \frac{\partial \Phi_{ij}}{\partial \mathbf{q}_i} - \frac{\partial \Phi_i^{ext}}{\partial \mathbf{q}_i}  &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{ij}(\mathbf{q}_i, \mathbf{q}_j)&lt;/math&gt; is the pair potential for interaction between particles and &lt;math&gt;\Phi^{ext}(\mathbf{q}_i)&lt;/math&gt; is the external field potential. By integration over part of the variables, the Liouville equation can be transformed into a chain of equations where the first equation connects the evolution of one-particle probability density function with the two-particle probability density  function, second equation connects the two-particle probability density function with the three-particle probability density function, and generally the ''s''-th equation connects the ''s''-particle probability density function 

:&lt;math&gt;f_s(\mathbf{q}_1\dots\mathbf{q}_s, \mathbf{p}_1 \dots \mathbf{p}_s, t) = \int f_N(\mathbf{q}_1\dots\mathbf{q}_N, \mathbf{p}_1 \dots \mathbf{p}_N, t)\, d\mathbf{q}_{s+1}\dots  d\mathbf{q}_N d\mathbf{p}_{s+1}\dots d\mathbf{p}_N &lt;/math&gt;

with the  ''(s+1)''-particle probability density function:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial f_s}{\partial t} + \sum_{i=1}^s \frac{\mathbf{p}_i}{m} \frac{\partial f_s}{\partial \mathbf{q}_i} - \sum_{i=1}^s \left( \sum_{j=1\neq i}^s \frac{\partial \Phi_{ij}}{\partial \mathbf{q}_i} + \frac{\partial \Phi_i^{ext}}{\partial \mathbf{q}_i}  \right) \frac{\partial f_s}{\partial \mathbf{p}_i} = (N-s) \sum_{i=1}^s \int \frac{\partial \Phi_{i\,s+1}}{\partial \mathbf{q}_i} \frac{\partial f_{s+1}}{\partial \mathbf{p}_i} \,d\mathbf{q}_{s+1} d\mathbf{p}_{s+1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The equation above for ''s''-particle distribution function is obtained by integration of the Liouville equation over the variables &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}_{s+1}\dots\mathbf{q}_N, \mathbf{p}_{s+1} \dots \mathbf{p}_N&lt;/math&gt;. The problem with the above equation is that it is not closed. To solve &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt;, one has to know &lt;math&gt;f_{s+1}&lt;/math&gt;, which in turn demands to solve &lt;math&gt;f_{s+2}&lt;/math&gt; and all the way back to the full Liouville equation. However, one can solve &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;f_{s+1}&lt;/math&gt; could be modeled. One such case is the [[Boltzmann equation]] for &lt;math&gt;f_1(\mathbf{q}_1,\mathbf{p}_1,t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f_2(\mathbf{q}_1,\mathbf{q}_2,\mathbf{p}_1,\mathbf{p}_2,t)&lt;/math&gt; is modeled based on the [[Molecular chaos|molecular chaos hypothesis]] (Stosszahlansatz). In fact, in Boltzmann equation &lt;math&gt;f_2=f_2(\mathbf{p}_1,\mathbf{p_2},t)&lt;/math&gt; is the collision integral. This limiting process of obtaining Boltzmann equation from Liouville equation is known as [[Boltzmann–Grad limit]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Grad]] (1949). On the kinetic theory of rarefied gases. Communications on pure and applied mathematics, 2(4), 331-407.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical interpretation and applications==
Schematically, the Liouville equation gives us the time evolution for the whole &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-particle system in the form &lt;math&gt;Df_N=0&lt;/math&gt;, which expresses an incompressible flow of the probability density in phase space. We then define the reduced distribution functions incrementally by integrating out another particle's degrees of freedom &lt;math&gt;f_s \sim \int f_{s+1}&lt;/math&gt;. An equation in the BBGKY hierarchy tells us that the time evolution for such a &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt; is consequently given by a Liouville-like equation, but with a correction term that represents force-influence of the N-s suppressed particles 

:&lt;math&gt;D f_s \propto \text{div}_{\mathbf p} \langle \text{grad}_{\mathbf q}\Phi_{i,s+1}\rangle_{f_{s+1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The problem of solving the BBGKY hierarchy of equations is as hard as solving the original Liouville equation, but approximations for the BBGKY hierarchy (which allow truncation of the chain into a finite system of equations) can readily be made. The merit of these equations is that the higher distribution functions &lt;math&gt;f_{s+2},f_{s+3},\dots&lt;/math&gt; affect the time evolution of &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt; only implicitly via &lt;math&gt;f_{s+1}.&lt;/math&gt; Truncation of the BBGKY chain is a common starting point for many applications of kinetic theory that can be used for derivation of classical&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Nikolay Bogoliubov|N.

In particular, truncation at the first equation or the first two equations can be used to derive classical and quantum [[Boltzmann equation]]s and the first order corrections to the Boltzmann equations. Other approximations, such as the assumption that the density probability function depends only on the relative distance between the particles or the assumption of the hydrodynamic regime, can also render the BBGKY chain accessible to solution.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, S.

''S''-particle distribution functions were introduced in classical statistical mechanics by J. Yvon in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Yvon|J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15151">A '''caption contest''' or '''caption competition''' is a competition between multiple participants, who are required to give the best description for a certain [[image]] offered by the [[Competition|contest]] organizer. Rules and information about the competition process are also given by the competition organizer.

== General information ==
Caption contest participants have to describe a given image as accurately and [[originality|originally]] as possible. Contests may vary by image type ([[photograph|photo]] or [[drawing]]), [[Photo caption|caption]] format ([[description]] of a situation or a [[dialogue]]), as well as [[judgement|judging]] criteria. The competition organizer is required to give information about caption submission rules and other information that is important for the contest.

Caption contests are mainly arranged as an [[amusement]], and they can be organized under different conditions (between separate individuals, in public events, [[mass media]], etc.), as well as using various means (drawn pictures on paper, digital image, printed image, press publication, etc.). Traditionally, the most popular and typical format has been publication of caption contests in [[newspaper]]s or [[magazine]]s, but with the development of modern technologies, it is also very popular to organize caption contests on the [[Internet]].

Caption contests can be used not only as an [[entertainment]] but also for other purposes, such as newspaper promotion, bringing forward a certain [[problem]], or product [[advertising|advertisement]]. An important aspect of caption competition is to look at an object, event or issue from unusual point of view.

The caption, unless competition rules do not restrict, can be in any form of literary expression - [[prose]], [[poetry]], as one [[word]] or a [[word play]]. Usually the submitted captions are judged by the originality and [[wit]], but not always the decisive assessment is [[humour]]. It is generally assumed that the caption has to describe image as precisely as possible, so both humour and precision are equally important.

As caption writing is an [[art]] of words, it is rarely possible to evaluate the superiority of one caption over others accurately and [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectively]]. Consequently, the judging of submitted captions is usually quite [[subjectivity|subjective]]. Sometimes competition rules limit caption size, but usually the caption is no longer than one [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] (10 - 20 words). As an exception, the caption can consist of several sentences. Usually it is not allowed to use [[profanity|profane]] or offensive language in submitted captions.

In several caption contests, [[champion|winners]] are awarded with [[prize]]s.

== History ==
It is considered that the origins of caption contests are related to the increase of [[popularity]] of [[cartoon]]s and [[comics]] as well as widespread use of [[illustration]]s and the rise of [[photojournalism]] in printed media at the end of the 19th century. All these areas share the combination of words and images that could be multiplied and made available to a wide audience with the beginnings of mass printing and wide spread of newspapers and magazines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/20/business/earlier-media-achieved-critical-mass-printing-press-yelling-stop-presses-didn-t.html D. J. R. Bruckner. "How the Earlier Media Achieved Critical Mass." ''The New York Times'', November 20, 1995.]&lt;/ref&gt;

From currently available information, the first caption contests in printed media appeared in the [[United States|U.S.]] press of the late 19th century (such as ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1920-11-07/ed-1/seq-25/ "$1000.00 in Prizes." ''New-York tribune'', November 07, 1920.] chroniclingamerica.loc.gov. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; which was published from year 1883 to 1936). At that time these competitions were called ''picture title'' or ''picture headline'' contests, but their concept and meaning was identical to current caption contests. It must be considered, that the term ''caption'' in its present sense firstly appeared in [[English language]] only in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=caption&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of the 20th century, at least in the U.S. press (for example, ''[[The San Francisco Call]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1912-01-07/ed-1/seq-17/ "The Sunday Call Will Pay $20 for the Best Title for This Picture." ''The San Francisco call'', January 07, 1912.] chroniclingamerica.loc.gov. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Daily News (New York)|The Daily News]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1920-03-23/ed-1/seq-11/ "What does this Picture mean?" ''New-York tribune'', March 23, 1920, p.11.] chroniclingamerica.loc.gov. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Connecticut Post|The Bridgeport Telegram]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://newspaperarchive.com/bridgeport-telegram/1921-12-20/page-30/ "$10 A Week for the Best Titles in Sunday Post Caption Contest" ''Bridgeport Telegram'', December 20, 1921, p.30.] newspaperarchive.com. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;) caption contests were already quite popular. In these competitions drawn pictures and cartoons were mainly used. [[Photo caption]] contests appeared little later with the improvement of printing quality (towards the second quarter of 20th century).

During the course of the 20th century, caption contests were published in printed media in many countries of the world. For example, in Soviet Union one of the first caption contests was published in daily newspaper ''Izvestia'' Sunday supplement ''Nedelya'' (''The Week'') at the beginning of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odnako.org/magazine/material/show_14096/ "Золотой глаз-Геолог и Мальтус".] odnako.org. Retrieved June 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Little later a newspaper ''Literaturnaya gazeta'' began to publish caption contests that became very popular and they are part of this newspaper up until now.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgz.ru/article/18729/ "Что бы это значило?".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620052849/http://www.lgz.ru/article/18729/# |date=2012-06-20 }} lgz.ru. Retrieved June 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of caption contests increased even more with the emergence of the Internet by the end of the 20th century, and at the beginning of the 21st century. Internet has made the organization of caption contests and participation in them possible for wide audiences across the world.

== Present situation ==
Although a considerable amount of caption contests are now on Internet, caption contests in printed media still exist and are quite popular. A very popular and prominent is a weekly caption contest published in American magazine ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904199404576538831896448132 Russell Adams. "How About Never-Is Never Good for You?" ''The Wall Street Journal'', September 10, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; The contest first appeared in 1998 and has been published regularly in each issue since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/05/02/your-caption-here Your Caption Here] The New Yorker. 2 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Each week several thousand participants take part in this competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/bob-mankoff/seven-reasons-why-hard-to-win-caption-contest Seven Reasons It's Hard To Win The Caption Contest] Mankoff, Robert. 8 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On the Internet, a very popular is the weekly caption competition on ''[[BBC]]'' website (''[[BBC News Magazine Monitor|Magazine Monitor]]'' section), held since 2006.

Along the traditional caption contests, there have appeared different forms of this [[genre]] such as anti-caption contests&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; for worst submitted caption and reverse caption contests where the most suitable picture must be submitted for a given caption. There are also caption contests devoted to particular themes such as [[history]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.archives.gov/prologue/?p=9388 "Thursday Photo Caption Contest"] blogs.archives.gov. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[association football|football]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footytube.com/forums/funny-football/the-silly-captions-competition-2770/ "The Silly Captions Competition"] footytube.com. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the website caption.me &lt;ref&gt;http://www.caption.me/&lt;/ref&gt; (then captioncompetition.co.uk) was founded, featuring amusing photos loaded automatically from photo-sharing site [[Flickr]]. Visitors submit captions and vote for others. Caption.Me features a real-time collaborative mind-mapping feature called [http://www.caption.me/forum/discussion/557/maption-is-live#Item_0 Maption]

In 2009, there was released an online multiplayer caption writing game called ''[[Caption That (Game)|Caption That]]'' where players write captions for a given image and then vote for their favourite from the list others have written.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.captionthat.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219001151/http://www.captionthat.com/ |date=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the iPhone app [http://www.captionit.co Captionit] was released on the Apple App Store. Captionit is a free mobile app that allows people to play and create caption contests on their iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbwire.com/press-releases/waste-your-creativity-with-captionits-new-iphone-app-483131.htm/ Waste Your Creativity with Captionit's New Iphone App"] SBWire, March 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.captionit.co/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, mobile phone application [http://tinnbin.com TinnBin] was released for both iPhone and Android. TinnBin users create contests called "Bins" by uploading a picture from their device and selecting how long they would like the contest to run. While the bin is open, users can add and vote on comments, called "Tinns". Once the bin is closed, the winning tinn is appended to the image in the form of a caption. TinnBin is different from most other caption contests as the winner is chosen strictly by users of the application, and not the contest creators, and all the contests are created by users of the application.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tinnbin.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New Yorker'' magazine, noting the popularity of its cartoon caption contest, has created a caption contest [[board game]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120731102549/http://www.familyandpartygames.com/pdf/NY_instructions.pdf/ "The New Yorker Cartoon caption game"] familyandpartygames.com. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and issued a book with the most interesting cartoons and winning captions as well as comprehensive information covering this theme.&lt;ref&gt;Mankoff, Robert (2008).

Also concerning the ''New Yorker'' caption contest, several scientific studies have been carried out: researchers from [[University of New Mexico]], Department of Anthropology, in 2010 have compared humour ability in males and females in context of this competition;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289611000523/ | doi=10.1016/j.intell.2011.03.006 | volume=39 | title=Humor ability reveals intelligence, predicts mating success, and is higher in males | journal=Intelligence | pages=188–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; members of ''The New Yorker'' editorial board and [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado Boulder]] [[Leeds School of Business]] in 2011 analysed several thousand entries of this contest to study the concept of humour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leeds.colorado.edu/news/113 Leeds School of Business "What It Takes To Win The New Yorker`s Cartoon Caption Contest"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204013344/http://leeds.colorado.edu/news/113 |date=December 4, 2012}} leeds.colorado.edu, April 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future perspectives ==
The future of caption contests depends on the [[imagination]] and [[creativity]] of their organizers and participants, as well as future development of information and [[Information and communications technology|communication technologies]].

== In popular culture ==
In U.S. TV series ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', seventh-season episode ''[[The Search (The Office)|The Search]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc.com/the-office/episode-guide/season-7/42801/the-search/episode-715/281549/ "The Search".] "The Office" episode guide. nbc.com. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; its character [[Pam Beesly|Pam]] starts a caption contest in the office, with her co-worker [[Gabe Lewis|Gabe]] instituting rules that no one wants to follow.

In [[British sitcom]] ''[[Green Wing]]'', the second series, episode six, its character [[Alan Statham]] wins a caption competition on the ''Consultant Radiologists International'' website, an organisation of which Alan claims to be an "Esteemed member".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/shows/green-wing/episodes/ "Episode 6 – Season 2".] "Green Wing" episode guide. tv.com. Retrieved June 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a children's novel ''[[Absolute Zero (novel)|Absolute Zero]]'' by [[Helen Cresswell]] its character Uncle Parker has won a trip to the [[Caribbean]] in a caption contest. The rest of the family immediately enter similar competitions in an attempt to better his prize but, much of the time, beating the others to an entry form is a victory in itself.

In season two of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Bored to Death]]'', George (played by [[Ted Danson]]) struggles to caption a New Yorker cartoon, which portrays a police duck interacting with a suicidal bear.

The '''Centre of Ecology &amp; Rural Development''' ('''CERD''') is an Indian organisation which is part of the [[Pondicherry Science Forum]]. It was exclusively formed for taking up meaningful interventions in Health, Sanitation, Natural Resource Management, Energy, Watershed management and ICT for development.

CERD was set up in the year 1994 jointly by the [[Pondicherry Science Forum]] and [[Tamil Nadu Science Forum]] to take up S&amp;T based development initiatives improving the rural livelihoods of weaker sections. The earlier works included interventions in sericulture, vegetable leather tanning, fish aggregation device etc.

CERD has a field station at Bahoor called the [[Kalanjiyam]] (meaning Granary in Tamil) which acts has a hub of [[agriculture]] and technology options for the surrounding area.

CERD has a full-time manpower structure with a committed team of scientists working on a variety of areas ranging from women’s technology, [[science communication]], Continuing Education, Participatory Irrigation management through local democratic people’s institutions, women’s micro credit networks etc.

The latest of the projects that CERD is now implementing includes the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130206050236/http://dst.gov.in/whats_new/whats_new12/EOI-WTP.pdf Women’s Technology Park] (WTP), an AICP Project on BIOFARM, a watershed development project in [[Sedappatti]] Block of Madurai funded by [[NABARD]], the Tank Rehabilitation Project-Pondicherry etc.

==Soil Fertility Management==

R&amp;D Work on Alternate Soil [[Fertility Management]] Strategies
Systems for Irrigated and dry land crops.
Developed Decision System (DSS) for [[Soil]] Fertility Mgmt.

==Bio resource integrated Farming==

Reduction of external inputs.
Increasing internal resource flows in the [[farming system]].
Ensuring nutritional security of the whole farming system.

==Watershed Development==

Initiated programmes in Madurai district.
Participatory planning, implementation and management of the [[Drainage basin|Watershed]] through people’s organizations.

==Participatory Irrigation Mgmt==

Pilot work on irrigation tanks in Pondicherry.
Evolved guidelines for sustainable institutional structures.
All stakeholder participation ensured including women, dalits of landless communities.
Large scale encroachment eviction through participatory approach leading to Participatory Irrigation Mgmt.
Worked in low energy technologies for water system development (Oorani – drinking water pond) in [[Ramanathapuram]]

==Wasteland Reclamation==

Evolved successful models for participatory wasteland reclamation through coalition 
between landless SHG women and farmers’ groups.
Sustainable income for landless Self-help Group (SHG) women through collective farming.

==ICT for Rural Development==

Established the first successful model of Village Information Centre known as '''Samadhan Kendra''' through 
unique content creation in local language.
Software creation for local planning and for primary production in local language 
including Decision Support Systems.

==Fuel Efficient Stoves==

CERD will expand its activities in this area by constructing more stoves and also by expanding the works to other areas like Tamil Nadu etc. CERD construction of a fuel efficient Tawa for making dosa/parotta also more of this also will be done during the coming years. Subsidies from the [[Renewable Energy Agency]] will be sought for the Tawa stove also and that will be another recognition for the work being carried out.

==Biomass based Biogas Units==

With technical collaboration from [[IISc]]. [[Bangalore]], CERD will be constructing 
[[biogas]] units and this will be a new area that CERD will be treading to. 
The units are not gobar based but instead will be based on biomass
decomposition and tapping the biogas for cooking purposes.

==Organic Farming==

Already an Organic Farmers’ Association has been formed and CERD will be extending full 
support to expanding this network including getting organic certification processes 
for the farmers and for arranging marketing linkages for their organic produce. 
This will have full backward and forward linkages starting from seeds, 
plant protection, harvest and post harvest options.

==Nutrition based Kitchen Gardening systems==

This will be mainly women-focused especially for women under SHGs 
since the malnutrition levels of women in [[Pondicherry]] 
are very high and it is estimated that about 80% women face malnutrition. 
This programme also will have complete backward and forward linkages from seeds, 
biomanures, bio pesticides, processing and value addition etc.

==Micro enterprises for SHG women and for weaker sections==

CERD will be concentrating more on viable village level enterprises for improved livelihood options for women, dalits and other weaker sections with providing necessary S&amp;T inputs and EDP skills.

'''''{{lang|la|Ceteris paribus}}''''' or '''''{{lang|la|caeteris paribus}}''''' is a [[Latin]] phrase meaning "other things equal".  English translations of the phrase include "'''all other things being equal'''" or "'''other things held constant'''" or "'''all else unchanged'''". A prediction or a statement about a [[ontic|causal]], [[epistemic|empirical]], or [[inductive logic|logical]] relation between two states of affairs is ''ceteris paribus'' if it is acknowledged that the prediction, although usually accurate in expected conditions, can fail or the relation can be abolished by intervening factors.&lt;ref name="Schlicht000"&gt;{{cite book | author=Schlicht, E. | title=Isolation and Aggregation in Economics | year=1985 | publisher = Springer Verlag | isbn = 0-387-15254-7 | url=http://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/archive/00000003/}} chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''ceteris paribus'' assumption''' is often key to scientific inquiry, as scientists seek to screen out factors that perturb a relation of interest.  Thus, [[epidemiologist]]s for example may seek to control [[independent variable]]s as factors that may influence [[dependent variables]]—the outcomes or effects of interest.  Likewise, in [[scientific modeling]], simplifying assumptions permit illustration or elucidation of concepts thought relevant within the sphere of inquiry.

There is ongoing debate in the philosophy of science concerning ''ceteris paribus'' statements. On the [[Logical positivism|logical empiricist]] view, [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]] tends to state universal laws, whereas other sciences, such as biology, psychology, and economics, tend to state laws that hold true in normal conditions but have exceptions, '''''ceteris paribus'' laws''' (cp laws).&lt;ref name=Stanford2014&gt;Alexander Reutlinger, Gerhard Schurz &amp; Andreas Hüttemann, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/ceteris-paribus "Ceteris paribus laws"], in Edward N Zalta, ed, ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Spring 2014 edn.&lt;/ref&gt;  The focus on universal laws is a criterion distinguishing fundamental physics as [[fundamental science]], whereas cp laws are predominant in most other sciences as [[special science]]s, whose laws hold in special cases.&lt;ref name=Stanford2014/&gt; This distinction assumes a [[logical empiricist]] view of science. It does not readily apply in a mechanistic understanding of scientific discovery. There is reasonable disagreement as to whether mechanisms or laws are the appropriate model, though mechanisms are the favored method.&lt;ref name=glennan2014&gt;Glennan, S. (2014). Mechanisms. In M. Curd &amp; S. Psillos (eds.), ''The Routledge companion to philosophy of
science'' (2nd ed., pp. 420–428). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economics ==

=== Interpretation ===
One of the disciplines in which ''ceteris paribus'' clauses are most widely used is [[economics]], in which they are employed to simplify the formulation and description of economic outcomes. When using ''ceteris paribus'' in economics, one assumes that all other variables except those under immediate consideration are held constant. For example, it can be predicted that if the price of [[beef]] ''increases''—''ceteris paribus''—the quantity of beef demanded by buyers will ''decrease''. In this example, the clause is used to operationally describe everything surrounding the relationship between both the ''price'' and the ''quantity demanded'' of an [[ordinary good]].

This operational description intentionally ignores both known and unknown factors that may also influence the relationship between price and quantity demanded, and thus to assume ''ceteris paribus'' is to assume away any interference with the given example. Such factors that would be intentionally ignored include: a change in the price of substitute goods, (e.g., the price of pork or lamb); a change in the level of [[risk aversion]] among buyers (e.g., due to an increase in the fear of [[mad cow disease]]); and a change in the level of overall demand for a good regardless of its current price (e.g., a societal shift toward [[vegetarianism]]).

The clause is often loosely translated as "holding all else constant." It does not imply that no other things will in fact change; rather, it isolates the effect of one particular change. Holding all other things constant  is directly analogous to using a [[partial derivative]] in [[calculus]] rather than a [[total derivative]],  and to running a [[regression analysis|regression]] containing multiple variables rather than just one in order to isolate the individual effect of one of the variables.

=== Characterization given by Alfred Marshall ===

The clause is used to consider the effect of some causes in isolation, by assuming that other influences are absent. [[Alfred Marshall]]  expressed the use of the clause as follows:

:The element of time is a chief cause of those difficulties in economic investigations which make it necessary for man with his limited powers to go step by step; breaking up a complex question, studying one bit at a time, and at last combining his partial solutions into a more or less complete solution of the whole riddle. In breaking it up, he segregates those disturbing causes, whose wanderings happen to be inconvenient, for the time in a pound called Ceteris Paribus. The study of some group of tendencies is isolated by the assumption other things being equal: the existence of other tendencies is not denied, but their disturbing effect is neglected for a time. The more the issue is thus narrowed, the more exactly can it be handled: but also the less closely does it correspond to real life. I.e. The more we apply the rule of ceteris paribus the further we distance ourselves from reality, e.g. If hydrocarbon fuels are infinite then society is sustainable. 
Each exact and firm handling of a narrow issue, however, helps towards treating broader issues, in which that narrow issue is contained, more exactly than would otherwise have been possible. With each step more things can be let out of the pound; exact discussions can be made less abstract, realistic discussions can be made less inexact than was possible at an earlier stage. ([http://www.econlib.org/library/Marshall/marP.html Principles of Economics, Bk.V,Ch.V in paragraph V.V.10]).

=== Two uses ===

The above passage by Marshall highlights two ways in which the ''ceteris paribus'' clause may be used: The one is ''hypothetical'', in the sense that some factor is assumed fixed in order to analyse the influence of another factor in isolation. This would be '''hypothetical isolation'''. An example would be the hypothetical separation of the [[income effect]] and the [[substitution effect]] of a price change, which actually go together. The other use of the ''ceteris paribus'' clause is to see it as a means for obtaining an approximate solution. Here it would yield a '''substantive isolation'''.

Substantive isolation has two aspects: temporal and causal. '''Temporal isolation''' requires the factors fixed under the ''ceteris paribus'' clause to actually move so slowly relative to the other influence that they can be taken as practically constant at any point in time. So, if [[vegetarianism]] spreads very slowly, inducing a slow decline in the demand for beef, and the market for beef clears comparatively quickly, we can determine the price of beef at any instant by the intersection of supply and demand, and the changing demand for beef will account for the price changes over time ([[Temporary Equilibrium Method]]).

The other aspect of substantive isolation is '''causal isolation''': those factors frozen under a ''ceteris paribus'' clause should not significantly be affected by the processes under study. If a change in government policies induces changes in consumers' behaviour on the same time scale, the assumption that consumer behaviour remains unchanged while policy changes is inadmissible as a substantive isolation ([[Lucas critique]]).

[[File:Check dam Thadayana.jpg|thumb|A check Dam at Kudumboor across chandragiri River]]

== Function ==
A check dam placed in the [[ditch]], swale, or [[canal|channel]] interrupts the flow of water and flattens the gradient of the channel, thereby reducing the velocity. In turn, this obstruction induces [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] rather than [[Erosion|eroding]] the channel.&lt;ref name="Marsh, Landscape Planning"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marsh|first1=William M.|title=Landscape Planning: Environmental Applications|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=Danvers, MA|isbn=978-0-470-57081-4|pages=267–268|edition=5th}}&lt;!--|accessdate=October 27, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They can be used not only to slow flow velocity but also to distribute flows across a swale to avoid preferential paths and guide flows toward vegetation.&lt;ref name='Melbourne Water, "WSUD"'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Melbourne Water|title=Water Sensitive Urban Design Engineering Procedures: Stormwater|date=2005|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|location=Australia|isbn=0-643-09092-4|page=140|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AF9K93GWw2AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA&amp;q=WSUD%20Engineering%20Procedures%3A%20Stormwater%3A%20Stormwater|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some [[sedimentation]] may result behind the dam, check dams do not primarily function as sediment trapping devices.&lt;ref name='Iowa SUDAS, "Design Manual"'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Iowa Statewide Urban Design and Specifications (SUDAS)|title=Design Manual - Erosion and Sediment Control|date=2013|publisher=Institute for Transportation at Iowa State University|location=Ames, IA|url=http://www.iowasudas.org/manuals/design/Chapter07/7E-7.pdf|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Check dams could be designed to create small reservoirs, without possibility of silting. A self desilting design was published in 'Invention Intelligence, August, 1987, which while being permanent, would also remove silt as it is formed, keeping the reservoir capacity maximum. The design envisages an awning, going very near the bottom level, extending to the width of the dam, and embedding into the sides. When freshets occur, the silt is automatically carried over to down stream, keeping the reservoir clear.

== Applications ==

=== Grade control mechanism ===

Check dams have traditionally been implemented in two main environments: across channel bottoms and on hilly slopes.&lt;ref name='Garcia, Carmelo, "Check Dams"'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garcia|first1=Carmelo &amp; Mario Lenzi|title=Check Dams, Morphological Adjustments and Erosion Control in Torrential Streams|date=2010|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-1-61761-749-2}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Check dams are used primarily to control water velocity, conserve soil, and improve land.&lt;ref&gt;A conceptual model of check dam hydraulics for gully control:efficiency, optimal spacing and relation with step-pools C. Castillo, R. Pérez, and J. A. Gómez from Hydrology and Earth System Sciences 18, 1705–1721, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; They are used when other flow-control practices, such as lining the channel or creating [[bioswales]] is impractical.&lt;ref name='USEPA, "Water BMP: Check Dams"' /&gt; Accordingly, they are commonly used in degrading temporary channels, in which permanent stabilization is impractical and infeasible in terms of resource allocation and funding due to the short life period.  Or, they are used when construction delays and weather conditions prevent timely installation of other erosion control practices.&lt;ref name=NCDENR&gt;{{cite book|last1=North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources|title=Practice Standards and Specifications|date=2006|publisher=NCDENR|location=Raleigh, N.C.|pages=6.83.1–6.83.3|url=http://portal.ncdenr.org/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=efbff6bd-e595-4828-be6a-394be4c404c2&amp;groupId=38334|accessdate=28 October 2014}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is typically seen during the construction process of large-scale permanent [[dams]] or erosion control. As such, check dams serve as temporary grade-control mechanisms along waterways until resolute stabilization is established or along permanent swales that need protection prior to installation of a non-erodible lining.&lt;ref name="UDFCD, Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Urban Drainage and Flood Control District|title=Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual Volume 3|date=2010|publisher=Urban Drainage and Flood Control District|location=Colorado|url=http://www.udfcd.org/downloads/pdf/critmanual/Volume%203%20PDFs/chapter%207%20fact%20sheets/EC-12%20Check%20Dam.pdf|accessdate=28 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905051511/http://www.udfcd.org/downloads/pdf/critmanual/Volume%203%20PDFs/chapter%207%20fact%20sheets/EC-12%20Check%20Dam.pdf#|archive-date=2012-09-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water quality control mechanism ===
Many check dams tend to form [[stream pool]]s. Under low-flow circumstances, water either [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrates]] into the ground, [[Evaporation|evaporates]], or seeps through or under the dam. Under high flow - [[flood]] - conditions, water flows over or through the structure. Coarse and medium-grained sediment from [[Runoff (water)|runoff]] tends to be deposited behind check dams, while finer grains flow through. Extra nutrients, [[phosphorus]], [[nitrogen]], [[heavy metals]], and floating garbage are also trapped by check dams, increasing their effectiveness as water quality control measures.

=== Arid regions ===
In arid areas, check dams are often built to increase groundwater recharge in a process called managed aquifer recharge. Winter runoff thus can be stored in aquifers, from which the water can be withdrawn during the dry season for irrigation, livestock watering, and even drinking water supply. This is particularly useful for small settlements located far from a large urban center as check dams require less reliance on machinery, funding, or advanced understandings as compared to large-scale dam implementation.&lt;ref&gt;S. Parimala Renganayaki, L. Elango (April 2013). "A review on managed aquifer recharge by check dams: a case study near Chennai, India". : International Journal of Research in Engineering and Technology 2 (4): 416–423&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Agoramoorthy, "The Check Dam Route"' /&gt;

Check dams can be used in combination with [[liman irrigation system|limans]] to stop and collect [[surface runoff]] water.

=== Mountainous regions ===
As a strategy to stabilize mountain streams, the construction of check dams has a long tradition in many mountainous regions dating back to the 19th century in Europe. Because of the steep slopes in the mountain region, it may be difficult for large construction machinery to reach mountain streams; therefore, check dams have been implemented in place of large-scale dams.  Because the typical high slope causes the flow velocity to move faster, a terraced system of multiple closely spaced check dams is typically necessary to reduce velocity and thereby counteract erosion.  Such consolidation check dams, built in terraces, attempt to prevent both headward and downward cutting into channel beds while also stabilizing adjacent hill slopes. They are further used to mitigate flood and debris flow hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mazzorana|first1=Bruno|title=The susceptibility of consolidation check dams as a key factor for maintenance planning|journal=Österreichische Wasser- und Abfallwirtschaft|date=6 June 2014|volume=66|issue=5|pages=214–216|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00506-014-0160-4/fulltext.html|accessdate=5 October 2014|doi=10.1007/s00506-014-0160-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design considerations ==

=== Site ===
Before installing a check dam, careful inspection of the site must be undertaken. The [[Drainage basin|drainage area]] should be ten acres or less.&lt;ref name="MS DEQ, Erosion Stormwater Manual" /&gt;&lt;ref name='USEPA, "Water BMP: Check Dams"' /&gt;  The waterway should be on a slope of no more than 50% and should have a minimum depth to bedrock of 2&amp;nbsp;ft.&lt;ref name='Idaho DEQ, "Stormwater Best Management Practices"'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Department of Environmental Quality|title=IDEQ Stormwater Best Management Practices Catalog: Check Dams BMP 32|date=2005|publisher=State of Idaho|pages=106–108|url=http://www.deq.idaho.gov/media/617590-32.pdf|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Check dams are often used in natural or constructed channels or swales. They should never be placed in live streams unless approved by appropriate local, state and/or federal authorities.&lt;ref name='Idaho DEQ, "Stormwater Best Management Practices"' /&gt;

=== Materials ===
Check dams are made of a variety of materials. Because they are typically used as temporary structures, they are often made of cheap and accessible materials such as rocks, gravel, logs, hay bales, and sandbags.&lt;ref name='USEPA, "Water BMP: Check Dams"' /&gt; Of these, logs and rock check dams are usually permanent or semi-permanent; and the sandbag check dam is implemented primarily for temporary purposes. Also, there are check dams that are constructed with rockfill or wooden boards. These dams are usually implemented only in small, open channels that drain {{convert|10|acre|km2|2|abbr=on}} or less; and usually do not exceed {{convert|2|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} high.&lt;ref name=NRCS&gt;{{cite web|last1=USDA Natural Resource Conservation Services (NRCS)|title=Urban BMPs: Water Erosion|url=ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/WSI/UrbanBMPs/water/erosion/checkdam.pdf|website=usda.gov|publisher=USDA|accessdate=28 October 2014}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Woven-wire can be used to construct check dams in order to hold fine material in a gully. They are typically utilized in environments where the gully has a moderate slope (less than 10%), small drainage area, and in regions where flood flows do not typically carry large rocks or boulders.&lt;ref name=FAO&gt;{{cite web|title=FAO Watershed Management Field Manual|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/ad082e/ad082e03.htm|website=fao.org|publisher=Food and Agricultural Organizations of the United Nations|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In nearly all instances, erosion control blankets, which are biodegradable open-weave blankets, are used in conjunction with check dams. These blankets help enforce vegetation growth on the slopes, shorelines and ditch bottoms.

===Size ===
A check dam should not be more than {{convert|2|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} to {{convert|3|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} high.&lt;ref name="USDA BMPs"&gt;{{cite book|title=Urban BMPs: Water, erosion, check dams|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|url=ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/WSI/UrbanBMPs/water/erosion/checkdam.pdf|accessdate=4 November 2014}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the center of the dam should be at least {{convert|6|in|m|2|abbr=on}} lower than its edges.&lt;ref name='USEPA, "Water BMP: Check Dams"' /&gt; They may kill grass linings in channels if water stays high or sediment load is great.  This criteria induces a weir effect, resulting in increased water surface level upstream for some, if not all flow conditions.&lt;ref name="UK pdf"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rickard|first1=Charles &amp; Rodney Day, Jeremy Purseglove|title=River Weirs – Good Practice Guide|date=2003|publisher=Environment Agency|location=UK|page=xi|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/290655/sw5b-023-hqp-e-e.pdf|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spacing ===

In order to effectively slow down water velocity to counter the effects of erosion and protect the channel between dams in a larger system, the spacing must be designed properly. The check dams should be spaced such that the toe of the upstream check dam is equal to the elevation of the downstream check dam's crest.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=https://wiki.sustainabletechnologies.ca/wiki/Check_dams |title=Check dams |author= Sustainable Technologies Evaluation Program |website= Low Impact Development Stormwater Management Planning and Design Guide |access-date= 28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By doing so, the water can pond between check dams and thus slow the flow's velocity down substantially as the water progresses downslope.&lt;ref name='Iowa SUDAS, "Design Manual"' /&gt;

== Advantages ==

Check dams are a highly effective practice to reduce flow velocities in channels and waterways.  Contrasting big dams, check dams have a faster implementation timeline, are cost effective, and are smaller in scope.  Because of this, their implementation will not typically displace people or communities nor will they destroy natural resources if careful design considerations are undertaken.&lt;ref name='Agoramoorthy, "Small Size, Big Potential"'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Agoramoorthy|first1=Govindasamy, and Minna J. Hsu|title=Small Size, Big Potential: Check Dams for Sustainable Development|journal=Environment|date=2008|volume=50|issue=4|pages=22–34|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/224015181?accountid=14749|accessdate=28 October 2014|doi=10.3200/envt.50.4.22-35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the dams themselves are simple to construct and do not rely on advanced technologies – thereby they can be applied in more rural and less advanced communities, as they have been in India's drylands for some time now.&lt;ref name='Agoramoorthy, "Small Size, Big Potential"' /&gt;

== Limitations ==

Check dams still require maintenance and sediment removal practices.  They become more difficult to implement on steep slopes, as velocity is higher and thereby the distance between dams must be shortened.&lt;ref name='Iowa SUDAS, "Design Manual"' /&gt; Check dams, depending on the material used, can have a limited life span but if implemented correctly can be considered permanent though not encouraged.&lt;ref name='Iowa SUDAS, "Design Manual"' /&gt;

== Maintenance ==
Check dams require regular maintenance as they are used primarily as a temporary structure and thereby are not designed to withstand long-term use.  Dams should be inspected every week that it is sited in the channel and after every large storm.&lt;ref name='Iowa SUDAS, "Design Manual"' /&gt; It is important that rubble, litter, and leaves are removed from the upstream side of the dam.&lt;ref name='USEPA, "Water BMP: Check Dams"'&gt;{{cite web|last1=United States Environmental Protection Agency|title=Water Best Management Practices: Check Dams|url=http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/npdes/swbmp/Check-Dams.cfm|website=water.epa.gov|publisher=USEPA|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is typically done when the sediment has reached a height of one-half the original height of the dam.&lt;ref name='USEPA, "Water BMP: Check Dams"' /&gt;

Further, maintenance is required when removing the check dam altogether.  In order to ensure the future flow is not adversely altered, the check dam must be fully removed, including any parts that may have been dislodged and washed downstream or any newly developed bare spots where the check dam once was situated.&lt;ref name='Iowa SUDAS, "Design Manual"' /&gt;

'''Clinical nutrition''' is [[nutrition]] of [[patients]] in [[health care]]. [[wiktionary:clinical|Clinical]] in this sense refers to the management of patients, including not only outpatients at [[clinic]]s, but also (and mainly) inpatients in hospitals. It incorporates primarily the scientific fields of [[nutrition]] and [[diet (nutrition)|dietetics]]. It aims to keep a healthy [[Energy balance (biology)|energy balance]] in patients, as well as providing sufficient amounts other nutrients such as protein, vitamins, minerals.

==Methods of nutrition==
Among the [[routes of administration]], the preferred means of nutrition is, if possible, [[oral administration]]. Alternatives include [[enteral administration]] (in [[nasogastric feeding]]) and [[intravenous]] (in [[parenteral nutrition]]).

==Clinical malnutrition==
In the field of clinical nutrition, [[malnutrition]] has causes, epidemiology and management distinct from those associated with malnutrition that is mainly related to poverty.

The main causes of ''clinical malnutrition'' are:
* [[Cachexia]] caused by diseases, injuries and/or aging
* Difficulties with ingestion, such as [[stroke]], [[paresis]], [[dementia]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[dysphagia]]

Clinical malnutrition may also be aggravated by [[iatrogenic]] factors, i.e., the inability of a [[health care]] entity to appropriately compensate for causes of malnutrition.

There are various definitions of clinical malnutrition. According to one of them, patients are defined as ''severely undernourished'' when meeting at least one of the following criteria: [[body mass index|BMI]] [[less than|&lt;]] or = 20&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and/or [[more than|&gt;]] or = 5% unintentional weight loss in the past month and/or &gt; or = 10% unintentional weight loss in the past 6 months. By the same system, the patient is ''moderately undernourished'' if they met at least one of the following criteria: BMI 20.1–22&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and/or 5-10% unintentional weight loss in the past six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kruizenga HM, de Vet HC, Van Marissing CM |title=The SNAQ(RC), an easy traffic light system as a first step in the recognition of undernutrition in residential care |journal=J Nutr Health Aging |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=83–9 |year=2010 |doi= 10.1007/s12603-009-0147-1|pmid=20126953|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Derrick Jensen''' (born December 19, 1960) is an [[People of the United States|American]] author and [[radical environmentalist]] (and prominent critic of [[Bright green environmentalism|mainstream environmentalism]]) living in [[Crescent City, California|Crescent City]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;''Endgame, Volume 1: The Problem of Civilization'', Seven Stories Press ({{ISBN|1-58322-730-X}}), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', Jensen "has been called the poet-philosopher of the [[ecological movement]]."&lt;ref name="dominant culture killing"/&gt;

Jensen has published several books, including ''[[The Culture of Make Believe]]'' and ''[[Endgame (Derrick Jensen books)|Endgame]]'', that question and critique [[civilization]] as an entire social system, exploring its inherent values, hidden premises, and modern links to [[supremacism]], [[oppression]], and [[genocide]], as well as corporate, domestic, and worldwide ecological abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amazon: Derrick Jensen|accessdate=November 1, 2016|publisher=Amazon.com, Inc|url=https://www.amazon.com/Derrick-Jensen/e/B001JOY0DY}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also taught creative writing at [[Pelican Bay State Prison]] and [[Eastern Washington University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jensen |first=D. |year=2003 |title=Walking on Water: Reading, Writing, and Revolution |publisher=Context Books |isbn=1-893956-37-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Derrick holds a [[B.S.]] in mineral engineering physics from the [[Colorado School of Mines]] in [[Golden, Colorado]], which he attended on a scholarship,&lt;ref&gt;"... and I couldn't afford to go to college otherwise." ''The Derrick Jensen Reader'' (p.438), Seven Story Press, 2012 ({{ISBN|978-1-60980-404-6}})&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[Master of Fine Arts|M.F.A.]] in creative writing from [[Eastern Washington University]] in [[Cheney, Washington]].&lt;ref name="Derrick Jensen"&gt;[http://www.derrickjensen.org/about.html Derrick Jensen&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

=== Philosophy ===

Derrick Jensen is primarily an advocate for indigenous peoples and wild nature, and an opponent of civilization, rejecting the notion that it can ever be an ethical or sustainable model for human society. He describes the linguistically and historically defensible definition of ''[[civilization]]''&lt;ref name="lecture"&gt;{{cite speech|publisher=YouTube|year=2011|title=Derrick Jensen - Endgame|time=4:57 to 6:52|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9os1GFuWJ0#t=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as "a culture&amp;nbsp;— that is, a complex of stories, institutions, and artifacts&amp;nbsp;— that both leads to and emerges from the growth of cities (''civilization'', see ''civil'': from ''civis'', meaning ''citizen'', from Latin ''civitatis'', meaning ''state'' or ''city''),"&lt;ref name="Endgame17"&gt;Jensen, Derrick. (2006). ''Endgame, Volume 1: The Problem of Civilization'', Seven Stories Press ({{ISBN|1-58322-730-X}}), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and the definition of ''city'' as a group of "people living more or less permanently in one place in densities high enough to require the routine importation of food and other necessities of life."&lt;ref name="Endgame17"/&gt; He explains that, by such definitions, civilizations and cities are both unsustainable:

{{quote|Two things happen as soon as you require the importation of resources. One of them is that your way of living can never be sustainable, because, if you require the importation of resources, it means you've denuded the landscape of that particular resource, and, as your city grows, you'll denude an ever-larger area. ... And the other thing it means is that your way of life must be based on violence, because if you require the importation of resources, trade will never be sufficiently reliable because, if you ''require'' the importation of resources and the people in the next watershed over aren't going to trade you for it, you're going to ''take'' it.|sign=Derrick Jensen|source=&lt;nowiki&gt;Book lecture for&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''Endgame''&lt;ref name="lecture"/&gt;}}

An outspoken critic of [[human supremacy]], Jensen advocates non-[[anthropocentrism]], or [[ecocentrism]], according to which humans should first of all actively support the flourishing of entire [[ecosystem|natural communities]] and their many individual species, rather than the flourishing of humans alone; and second, that they should extend the status of [[personhood]] to all organisms and ecosystems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Earth at Risk: Building a Resistance Movement to Save the Planet|first=Derrick|last=Jensen|page=132|publisher=PM Press|year=2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T1Oa8cBLN1IC&amp;q=%22people+are+we%22e}}&lt;/ref&gt; including non-human animals and plants. For example, in an article on [[water management]], he refers to "both human people and fish people".&lt;ref name = "showers"/&gt; His view, which moves central moral focus away from civilized humans, also names and castigates some of the values most championed by modern civilization, including technological advancement, economic growth, the [[inevitability of progress]], and [[sustainable development|sustainability as seen through the lens of "development"]]. Jensen advocates a way of life that is harmonious in a truly ecological sense, and is thus lastingly sustainable, such as the diverse ways of life historically exhibited by many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and other indigenous, non-civilized cultures. He also claims that "the fundamental difference between Western and indigenous ways of being is that even the most open-minded Westerners generally perceive listening to the natural world as a metaphor, as opposed to the way the world really is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Derrick Jensen Reader: Writings on Environmental Revolution|year=2012|editor=Lierre Keith|publisher=Seven Stories Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LGL8PCVc_pcC&amp;pg=PT9&amp;dq=0AjcUp3NBK3lsASCloGgBg&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAg#v=snippet&amp;q=%22westerners%20generally%20perceive%20listening%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; While indigenous peoples understand the world as consisting of other beings with whom we can enter into relationship, he argues that Westerners believe the world consists merely of objects or resources to be exploited or used.

Jensen argues that dysfunctional and antisocial behaviors pervade civilization. His analysis views macrocosmic abuses through the microcosmic lens of domestic abuse and violence, noting the connection between abusive personal relationships and the oppressive, expansionist culture as a whole. The psychopathology of modern civilization's global, industrial economy obliterates healthy personal relationships as well as the [[natural environment]], and [[indigenous people|indigenous ways of life]]. Accordingly, he exhorts readers and audiences to help bring an end to [[industrial civilization]], promoting its dismantling by any means necessary,&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9os1GFuWJ0&lt;/ref&gt; thus challenging [[pacifism]], since he believes that [[violence]] may be justified at times, particularly as a form of [[self-defense]] or resistance against oppression. In ''A Language Older Than Words'' and also in an article entitled "Actions Speak Louder Than Words", Jensen states "Every morning when I awake I ask myself whether I should write or blow up a dam. I tell myself I should keep writing, though I'm not sure that's right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jensen|first=Derrick|title=Actions Speak Louder Than Words|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/derrick-jensen-actions-speak-louder-than-words}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the potential for success of the crushed [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] (when compared to the inevitable annihilation of Warsaw's non-rebelling Jews) and his being attacked by various mother animals in perceived defense of their babies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pacifism as Pathology|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/derrick-jensen-pacifism-as-pathology-introduction|publisher=The Anarchist Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen supports the violence used by oppressed people and wild creatures in their own defense as a viable strategy against even their most powerful enemies. Jensen has clarified, however, that "I get accused of being the 'violence guy' ... but I don't ever think that's really fair, because I really consider myself the 'everything guy', that I want to put everything on the table and talk about all forms of resistance ... We can certainly parse out cases where we think it's appropriate to have militant response or non-militant response."&lt;ref name="dominant culture killing"&gt;{{cite interview|last=Jensen|first=Derrick|interviewer=[[Amy Goodman]]|work=[[Democracy Now!]]|date=26 November 2010|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/11/26/author_and_activist_derrick_jensen|title=Author and Activist Derrick Jensen: "The Dominant Culture is Killing the Planet ... It's Very Important for Us to Start to Build a Culture of Resistance"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jensen also considers himself an [[anti-capitalist]], a critic of [[organized religion]] ([[Criticism of Buddhism|including Buddhism]]), a [[Criticism of science|critic of science]], an [[anti-racist]], and a [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]], and seems to agree with those critics who have called him an "anti-civilizationist".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/2006/10/18/greetings-from-echo-park/ An Open Letter to Jann Wenner: Greetings from Echo Park]&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been called [[anarcho-primitivism|anarcho-primitivistic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Integral ecology: uniting multiple perspectives on the natural world |author1=Sean Esbjörn-Hargens |author2=Michael E. Zimmerman |year=2009 |page=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Making a killing: the political economy of animal rights |author=Bob Torres |page=68 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/08/02/art-means-always-having-to-say-youre-sorry/ Clancy Sigal's "Hemingway Lives": Art Means Always Having to Say You’re Sorry]&lt;/ref&gt; a label which he once accepted, although more recently he has distanced himself from both the terms "anarchist" and "primitivist," especially criticizing modern anarchism's [[herd mentality]] and describing "primitive" as a "racist way to describe indigenous peoples." He prefers to be called "[[indigenism|indigenist]]" or an "ally to the indigenous," because "indigenous peoples have had the only sustainable human social organizations, and... we need to recognize that we [colonizers] are all living on stolen land."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zoeblunt.wordpress.com/2011/03/20/uncivilized/ |title=Uncivilized |first=Zoe |last=Blunt |work=[[Canadian Dimension]] |year=2011 |accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to the question of [[human overpopulation]], Jensen concedes that it is a social and environmental problem, but only at a "tertiary" level, and that [[overconsumption]]&amp;mdash;along with [[civilization]] and its ruthless, expansionist cultural mindset&amp;mdash;is the primary problem faced by the world.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; Recurrent topics in his books and talks include critiques of cosmeticism (as e.g. [[William R. Catton, Jr.#Overshoot: The Ecological Basis of Revolutionary Change|defined by William Catton]]), [[Lifestyle anarchism|lifestyleism]],&lt;ref name = "showers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/articles/article/4801/ |title=Forget Shorter Showers - Why personal change does not equal political change |work=[[Orion (magazine)|Orion]] |year=2012 |accessdate= 24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.derrickjensen.org/subscribers/Miscellaneous/?C=M;O=D |title=Talk at UoMichigan, March 2, 2012;  edited transcript (available for subscribers of the "DJ reading club" only) |year=2012 |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gandhism]], and other "[[bright green environmentalism|bright green]]" or mainstream liberal schools of political thought.

=== Writings ===

''A Language Older Than Words'' uses the lens of [[domestic violence]] to look at the larger violence of [[western culture]]. ''The Culture of Make Believe'' begins by exploring [[racism]] and [[misogyny]] and moves to examine how this culture's economic system leads inevitably to hatred and atrocity. ''Strangely Like War'' is about [[deforestation]]. ''Walking on Water'' is about [[education]] (It begins: "As is true for most people I know, I've always loved learning. As is also true for most people I know, I always hated school. Why is that?").&lt;ref&gt;''Walking on Water'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Welcome to the Machine'' is about [[surveillance]], and more broadly about science and what he perceives to be a Western obsession with control.

''Endgame'' is interspersed with what he describes as the inherent [[wikt:unsustainability|unsustainability]] of civilization. In this book he asks: "Do you believe that this culture will undergo a voluntary transformation to a sane and sustainable way of living?" Nearly everyone he talks to says no. His next question is: "How would this understanding&amp;nbsp;— that this culture will not voluntarily stop destroying the natural world, eliminating indigenous cultures, exploiting the poor, and killing those who resist&amp;nbsp;— shift our strategy and tactics? The answer? Nobody knows, because we never talk about it: we're too busy pretending the culture will undergo a magical transformation." ''Endgame'', he says, is "about that shift in strategy, and in tactics."&lt;ref&gt;''Endgame'' V.1, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Jensen's writing uses the [[first-person narrative|first-person]] and [[anecdotal evidence|personal experiences]] to construct arguments. His books are written like narratives, lacking a linear, hierarchical structure. They are not divided into distinct sections devoted to an individual argument. Instead, his writing is conversational, leaving one line of thought incomplete to move on to another, returning to the first again at some later point. Jensen uses this [[creative non-fiction]] style to combine his artistic voice with logical argument. Jensen often uses quotations as reference points for ideas explored in a chapter. (For example, he introduces the first chapter of ''Walking on Water'' with a quote from [[Jules Henry]]'s book ''[[Culture Against Man]]''.)&lt;ref&gt;Jensen D., 2004, ''Walking on Water: Reading, Writing, and Revolution'', Chelsea Green ({{ISBN|1-931498-48-2}}), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Jensen wrote ''Thought to Exist in the Wild'' (with photographs by Karen Tweedy-Holmes), which discussed the keeping of animals in zoos on both a physical and philosophical level. The book won the 2008 grand prize for the [[Eric Hoffer Award]] for Books.

Jensen wrote and [[Stephanie McMillan]] illustrated the [[graphic novel]]s ''As the World Burns'' (2007) and ''Mischief in the Forest'' (2010).

''Resistance Against Empire'' consists of interviews with J. W. Smith (on poverty), [[Kevin Bales]] (on slavery), Anuradha Mittal (on hunger), [[Juliet Schor]] ('globalization' and environmental degradation), [[Ramsey Clark]] (on US 'defense'), Stephen Schwartz (editor of ''The Nonproliferation Review'', on nukes), [[Alfred W. McCoy|Alfred McCoy]] (politics and heroin), [[Christian Parenti]] (the US prison system), [[Katherine Albrecht]] (on RFID), and [[Robert W. McChesney|Robert McChesney]] (on (freedom of) the media) conducted between 1999 and 2004.

Jensen co-wrote the book ''Deep Green Resistance: Strategy to Save the Planet'' with [[Lierre Keith]] and Aric McBay. Jensen's contribution consists of end-of-chapter responses to common queries he gets regarding bringing down civilization. The bulk of the book is written by the other two authors and covers the history of effective militant resistance movements such as parts of the U.S. civil rights movement and the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta ([[Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta|MEND]]), while also outlining potential strategies for above- and below-ground resistance to civilization, termed Decisive Ecological Warfare.

After the publication of this book, the authors co-founded an organization by the same name.  Aric McBay left the organization at the beginning of 2012, however, attributing his departure to the alleged cancellation of a transgender-inclusive policy by Derrick Jensen and Lierre Keith.&lt;ref&gt;Aric McBay, [http://www.aricmcbay.org/2013/05/14/dgr-and-transphobia/ "DGR and Transphobia"], May 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Deep Green Resistance has disputed this account, saying that the decision to restrict women's spaces was made by the women of DGR, and not by Derrick Jensen or Lierre Keith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.deepgreenresistance.org/reponse-to-aric-mcbay/ |title=Reponse(sic) to Aric McBay |work=deepgreenresistance.org |year=2013 |accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Jensen also published ''Dreams'', which draws on the mythologies of ancient cultures and the wisdom of contemporary thinkers like [[Jack Forbes]], [[Waziyatawin]] (a Dakota activist), [[Paul Stamets]], and [[Stanley Aronowitz]] and is Jensen's challenge to the view that there is no knowledge outside that gained by science, and ''Truths Among Us'', a thought-provoking collection of interviews with 10 leading writers, philosophers, teachers, and activists who argue against society's belief that corporations and governments know what is best for the future.

Jensen convened the conferences "Earth at Risk", which were held in November 2010 and 2011 in San Francisco and Berkeley, CA, respectively, with presentations by D.J., [[Arundhati Roy]], [[William R. Catton, Jr.|William Catton]], Rikki Ott, Thomas Linzey, [[Gail Dines]], Jane Caputi, Waziyatawin, Aric McBay, [[Minimum Security|Stephanie McMillan]], Lierre Keith, and [[Flashpoints (radio program)|Nora Barrows-Friedman]], which were also published on DVD and as a book.

Jensen has written three novels: ''Lives Less Valuable''; ''Songs of the Dead''; and ''The Knitting Circle Rapist Annihilation Squad''.

===Criticism===
Derrick Jensen's views are broadly controversial. The radical magazine ''[[CounterPunch]]'', in addition to publishing interviews with and articles written by Jensen, has also published commentaries by others who are critical of the potential for Jensen's philosophy to lead followers towards [[nihilism]] due to his "apocalyptic" warnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2007/09/11/specters-of-malthus-scarcity-poverty-apocalypse/ |last=Boal|first=Ian|interviewer=David Martinez|year=2007|title=Specters of Malthus: Scarcity, Poverty, Apocalypse |website=Counterpunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/02/08/apocalypse-and-the-left/ |first=Osha|last=Neumann|year=2013|publisher=CounterPunch|title=Apocalypse and the Left |website=Counterpunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to DGR's radical feminism, gender refers to a patriarchal caste system rather than a subjective set of feelings about sexual identity.&lt;ref name="deepgreenresistance.org"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.deepgreenresistance.org/protect-women-feminism-and-free-speech/ |title=Protect Women, Feminism, and Free Speech  |year=2013 |website=Deep Green Resistance|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its members claim to be "critical of gender itself.

Jensen has rarely commented publicly on transgender politics, though, in his 2006 book ''Endgame'', Jensen does briefly mention and even identify with transgender people, along with other [[Social exclusion|marginalized groups]], in a call for [[solidarity|political solidarity]].&lt;ref&gt;''Endgame'', V.2, p. 829: "We are the oppressed. We are prisoners, family farmers, animal liberators, women, children, American Indians, blacks, Mexicans, poor whites, Asians, people of the Third World, the indigenous. We are lesbians, homosexuals, transgendered."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, ''[[CounterPunch]]'' published an article by Jensen in which he claims that trans activists criticize him primarily because he believes ([[cisgender]]) women should not be forced "to share their most intimate spaces with men ... I believe that women have the right to bathe, sleep, gather, and organize free from the presence of men," which these critics have regarded as offensive towards [[transgender women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/08/10/liberals-and-the-new-mccarthyism/|first=Derrick|last=Jensen|year=2015|publisher=CounterPunch|title=Liberals and the New McCarthyism|website=Counterpunch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have defended Jensen's stance on gender, claiming that in challenging "trans activists on their assertions that ... their brain is 'female',"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/07/01/too-many-notes/ Gaslighting in the Age of ‘Misgendering']&lt;/ref&gt; he is correctly calling into question their problematically [[essentialist]] position that has centered an individual's self-perceived gender.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25580">'''Double-mindedness''' has been preached about in all churches since the time of [[Christ]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} and the term was used in the [[Bible]] by the [[James, brother of Jesus|Apostle James]].&lt;ref&gt;"Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him. But he must ask in faith without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind. For that man ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord, being a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. But the brother of humble circumstances is to glory in his high position; and the rich man is to glory in his humiliation, because like flowering grass he will pass away. For the sun rises with a scorching wind and withers the grass; and its flower falls off and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed; so too the rich man in the midst of his pursuits will fade away. ''James'' 1:2-11&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Keep near to God, then he will keep near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded." — ''James'' 4:8; [[Søren Kierkegaard]], ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denmark|Danish]] philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (1813–1855) developed his own systematic way to try to detect double-mindedness in himself.

==In Kierkegaard==
Kierkegaard asked himself:  Do I want to be a Christian or not? Do I want to be a preacher or not? Do I want to be a teacher or not? Do I want to get married or not?  All these questions have to do with the future. Many were willing to give him advice but he felt the decision was ultimately his own. Individuals fear making a decision because of external opposition but this need not stop one from making a decision so long as one has the capacity to learn through experience whether the decision was a good decision for one's self.

David F. Swenson was born in [[Sweden]] October 29, 1876 and his family moved to America in 1882. He became a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1917 and was very interested in the writings of Søren Kierkegaard. He ended up translating many of his books into English. At the time, America's human population was increasing and the same question asked in the [[Psalms]] was asked by people like David Swenson: "''How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?''" (Psalms 137:4). Below are several quotes from Kierkegaard's book, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', published on March 13, 1847 where he tried to answer that question.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There were brazen teachers of brazenness who thought that justice was to do wrong on a large scale and then to be able to make it appear that one nevertheless willed the good. Thus they had, so they thought, double advantage, the wretched advantage of being able to do wrong, of being able to have their will, of letting their passions rage, and the hypocritical advantage of seeming to be good. But in ancient times there was also a simple wise man whose simplicity became a trap for the quibbling of the brazen; he taught that in order to be really sure that it was the good one willed, one should avoid even appearing to be good-presumably lest the reward should be tempting. ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 37&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''[[File:The good samaritan (after Delacroix).jpg|thumb|right|130px|[[Parable of the Good Samaritan|The Good Samaritan]]]]What is your frame of mind toward others''? Are you in harmony with everyone-by willing one thing? Or are you divisively in a faction, or are you at loggerheads with everyone and everyone with you? Do you want for everyone what you want for yourself, or do you want the highest for yourself, for yourself and for yours, or that you and yours shall be highest? Do you [[Golden Rule|do unto others]] what you want others to do to you-by willing one thing? This willing is the eternal order that orders everything, that brings you in harmony with the dead and with the people you never saw, with strange people whose language and customs you do not know, with all the people on the whole earth, who are blood relatives and eternally related to divinity by eternity's task to will one thing. Do you want a different law for yourself and for yours than for others; do you want to have your comfort in something different from that in which every human being unconditionally can and will be comforted? If a king and a beggar and one of your peers came to you at the same time, would you in their presence dare with bold confidence to assert what you want in the world, with bold confidence to assert wherein you seek your comfort, positive that his Royal Majesty would not disdain you even though you are an inferior, positive that the beggar would not go away disheartened as if he could not have the same comfort, positive that your peer would rejoice in your bold confidence! Alas, there is something in the world called an alliance; it is a dangerous thing, because all alliances are divisiveness. It is divisive when the alliance excludes the commoner, and when it excludes the nobleman, and when it excludes the government worker, and when it excludes the king, and when it excludes the beggar, and when it excludes the wise, and when it excludes the simple soul-because all alliances are divisiveness in opposition to the universally human. But to will one thing, to will the good in truth, to will as a single individual to be allied with God-something unconditionally everyone can do-that is harmony. ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 144&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first type of double-mindedness, that of willing for the sake of reward or out of fear of punishment, is akin to the distinction between [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic and extrinsic values]]. The second type of double-mindedness, that of willing only to a certain degree, is akin to distraction or half-hearted willing. Each type of double-mindedness is a human weakness and an obstacle to an individual pursuit of greatness and strength towards willing and reaching the Good.&lt;ref&gt;Hannay, Alastair. ''Kierkegaard'', Routledge, pp. 220–225.&lt;/ref&gt; To counter double-mindedness, Kierkegaard argues that discipline and clarity of the [[Self (philosophy)|self]] is essential and necessary to overcome double-mindedness. Double-mindedness isn't something evil but not recognizing that you, yourself, are a self-contradiction and double-minded is self-deceit.

Kierkegaard constantly writes about "willing the Good" but he does not go so far as to tell the single individual, ''my reader'', what the Good is, because, as far as Kierkegaard was concerned, the Good is something that each individual finds by living life and believing that God creates purposefully. He asks the individual to consider whether or not his or her life is a contradiction. Does the individual see the Good and the reward or the Good and the punishment? Only the individual involved in the task of living knows and when it is found you might not be able to explain to anyone why you think it is a Good.

===Expert knowers===
[[File:Nietzsche187c.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Friedrich Nietzsche around 1869 spoke of [[Übermensch]]]]
Is there a way for an individual to choose a career and have certainty that the career will offer the same rewards others have been given? Is there a marriage which will offer, with certainty, happy love between the beloved? Both Kierkegaard and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] were interested in these questions. Are there certain gifted individuals who know if you should marry or become a minister or a journalist or a philologist or is it something you should perhaps speak to God about and yourself? Nietzsche thinks the [[ethicist]] can help the person find the good. Kierkegaard said, "the ethicist can tell a person it's her duty to marry but the ethicist can in no way tell her whom she should marry."&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, Either/Or part II Hong pp. 301–302&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard questioned the supposition that anyone had a "duty" to marry. He was against people becoming "soul experts"&lt;ref&gt;Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1844 (Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, Hong p. 172ff, 365ff&lt;/ref&gt; and "expert knowers of love".&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, Words of Love, Hong p. 15, 230-231 &lt;/ref&gt; But can an individual be an expert knower of him or her self? Nietzsche says no, {{Quotation|Vanity is the involuntary inclination to set one's self up for an individual while not really being one; that is to say, trying to appear independent when one is dependent. The case of wisdom is the exact contrary: it appears to be dependent while in reality it is independent. Friedrich Nietzsche, [[Axiom]] 13 ''We Philologists''.}}

Kierkegaard made an analogy to this idea of taking knowledge and putting it into practice in his 1845 book, ''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'' (Hong 1993),  also translated as ''Thoughts on Crucial Situations in Human Life'' (Swenson 1941). He questions if knowledge has any importance at all without making use of it in daily life: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Let us imagine a pilot, and assume that he had passed every examination with distinction, but that he had not as yet been at sea. Imagine him in a storm; he knows everything he ought to do, but he has not known before how terror grips the seafarer when the stars are lost in the blackness of the night; he has not known the sense of impotence that comes when the pilot sees the wheel in his hand become a plaything for the waves; he has not known how the blood rushes to the head when one tries to make calculations at such a moment; in short, he has had no conception of the change that takes place in the knower when he has to apply his knowledge. What fair weather is to the sailor, that for the ordinary person is to live at the same pace with others and with the race, but the moment of decision, the dangerous moment of reflection when he takes himself out of the environment to be alone before God, to become a sinner, this is the stillness that upsets the customary order like a storm at sea. He knew all this, knew what would happen to him, but he did not know how anxiety would seize him, as he felt himself deserted in the manifold wherein he has his soul; he did not know how the heart beats when help from others, and the guidance from others, and the standards and the distractions afforded by others, vanish in the stillness; he did not know the trembling of the soul, when it is too late to shout for human aid, since no one can hear him: in short, he had no idea of how knowledge is changed when he needs to apply it."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Is this perhaps your case, my reader? I do not judge, I merely ask you. Alas, while the number of those who know so much increases more and more, the really able men become fewer and fewer! But it was such a man that you once wished to be. You have surely not forgotten what we said about sincerity: that a man must retain a clear recollection of what he once wished to be; and now you are to prove your sincerity before God in the confession of sins. What was it you once wished? You wished to strive after the highest ideals, to apprehend the truth and dwell in it; you would spare neither time nor effort; you would renounce everything, including every illusion. If you did attain the highest goal, you wanted to make sure of being clearly conscious of what you had formerly meant in striving to attain it. If this was ever so little, you would rather be faithful over a little than unfaithful over much. If this was your sole thought, and you became the poorest of all in the midst of the rich who know everything, you would rather still be as true as gold-and this is in the power of everyone who wills it, for gold is for the rich, but a golden loyalty is possible also for the poor. And he who was faithful over a little, faithful in the day of trial, when the reckoning is made in the stillness where no reward beckons, but only the guilt becomes clear, faithful in this sincerity which acknowledges everything, even the imperfection of the sincerity, faithful in the love that repents, the humble love whose demand is for self-accusation: he shall also be made ruler over more. Was not this what you wished? For we are agreed that in relation to the essential, knowing it is essentially identical with the ability to do it."
* Soren Kierkegaard, ''Thoughts on Crucial Situation in Human Life'', 1845, Swenson translation 1941 pp. 35–37&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Kierkegaard wrote much about the validity of marriage in all his books with this same idea in mind. Again, you can know everything in an objective way about marriage but its only when you actually decide to get married that you stand alone with your spouse and live the married life. He says, "It is told that [[Socrates]] is supposed to have answered someone who asked him about marriage: Marry or do not marry-you will regret both. Socrates was an [[irony|ironist]] who presumably concealed his wisdom and truth ironically lest it become local gossip, but he was not a mocker. The questioner's stupidity lies precisely in asking a third person for something one can never learn from a third person." The Good is always a good gift from God: {{Quotation|Marriage likes deserters just as little as it allows one to serve two masters. Solomon puts it beautifully when he says that he who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains a good gift from God-or, to modernize the saying a bit, to him who falls in love, the god has been gracious. If he marries the beloved, he does a good deed and does well to finish what he has begun.&lt;ref&gt;''Stages on Life's Way'', Hong pp. 155–156&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He put it this way in [[Judge for Yourselves!]]: {{Quotation|In newspapers, in books, from pulpits, from podia, and in assemblies there is a solemnity, a pomposity-a pomposity that suggests that everything revolves around spirit, around truth, around thought. Perhaps it does, too, perhaps. But perhaps everything nevertheless revolves around the job, around the career, perhaps. Is it the job, the career, that inspires the theological graduate, or is it Christianity? No one knows. He accepts the job, he ''maintains'' that it is Christianity. Is it the job, the career, that inspires the graduate, or is it scholarship? No one knows. He accepts the job, becomes a professor, he ''maintains'' that it is scholarship. Is it the number of subscribers that inspires the journalist or is it the task? No one knows. He amasses subscriptions, he ''maintains'' that it is the task. Is it love of the masses that motivates someone to place himself at the head of the masses? No one knows. He accepts the advantage of standing at the head of this force-that is apparent; he ''maintains'' that it is out of love. Søren Kierkegaard, ''For Self-Examination/Judge for Yourselves!'', Hong 1990 pp. 123–124}}

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] questioned why individuals choose a career in his 1872 book, ''We Philologists''.  {{Quotation|On inquiring into the origin of the [[philologist]] I find:
# A young man cannot have the slightest conception of what the Greeks and Romans were.
# He does not know whether he is fitted to investigate into them;
# And, in particular, he does not know to what extent, in view of the knowledge he may actually possess, he is fitted to be a teacher. What then enables him to decide is not the knowledge of himself or his science; but
*(a) imitation
*(b) The convenience of carrying on a kind of work which he had begun at school.
*(c) His intention of earning a living.
In short, ninety-nine philologists out of a hundred should not be philologists at all.
*Friedrich Nietzsche, ''We Philologists'', 1872, Editor: Oscar Levy, Translated 1911&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/wephilologists18267gut/18267.txt ''We Philologists''] at Gutenberg&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Can the effectiveness of a minister, journalist, professor, be quantified? How does anyone really know when something said had a great effect for good or for evil? Kierkegaard believed in the power of the single individual but didn't leave out others since no individual is stronger than himself. All individuals "create in the innermost being temptations of glory and temptations of fear and temptations of despondency, of pride and of defiance and of sensuality greater than those we meet in the external world, and this is the very reason we struggle with ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; The struggle is a good struggle as long as the "task" is maintained in its proper place. Not to know what a minister is, but to become and be a minister, not to know what a journalist is, but to become and be a journalist, not to know what a professor is, but to become and be a professor, etc. He didn't want to intrude in another's growth in the direction of religion because, Christianly speaking, "The difficulty is not to understand what Christianity is but to become and be a Christian." The task isn't to know what the good is or the beauty or the true but to become the good, the beauty and the true God meant you to become.&lt;ref&gt;''Concluding Postscript'', Hong pp. 557–559&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote this in 1846: {{Quotation|There is nothing, no ‘thus and so,’ that can unconditionally be said to demonstrate unconditionally the presence of love or to demonstrate unconditionally its absence. Truly, love is to be known by its fruit, but still it does not follow from this that you are to take it upon yourself to be the expert knower. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'' 1847, Hong pp. 14–15}}

{{Quotation|A person can very well eat lettuce before it has formed a heart, but the tender delicacy of the heart and its lovely coil are something quite different from the leaves. It is the same in the world of the spirit. Busyness makes it almost impossible for an individual to form a heart; on the other hand, the thinker, the poet, the religious person who has actually formed his heart never becomes popular, not because he is difficult but because a quiet and protracted occupation and intimacy with himself and a remoteness go along with it. Even if I could raise my voice and say something of which everybody would approve, I would not say it if it was of a religious nature, because there already is a kind of religious impropriety if the main point is to cry aloud; for religiousness the main point is to speak quite softly and with oneself. Ah, it gets so turned around! We think that religiousness, instead of being a matter of every individuals going alone into his private room to talk quietly with himself, is a matter of talking very loudly.
*Søren Kierkegaard, Journals and Papers II 1995 (Pap. VII 1A205) 1846 (''Works of Love'', Hong p. 407)}}

====Pride and cowardliness====
Søren Kierkegaard wrote his ''[[Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1844|Four Upbuilding Discourses]]'' on August 31, 1844. One of them was named ''Against Cowardliness'' and he used the Bible verse from 2 Timothy 1.17 ''For God did not give us a spirit of timidity but a spirit of power and love and self-control.'' He says, "we creep before we learn to walk, and to want to fly is always precarious."&lt;ref&gt;Against Cowardliness; ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, Hong'' pp. 347–348 The Discourse is 28 pages long 347–375&lt;/ref&gt; Many people, Christians included, make great resolutions and then just imagine that they will come about by the help of God, but "striving" is needed if one wants to try to do a "[[Summum bonum|good]]" thing, called "the highest good" by [[philosophers]]. Kierkegaard asks about the lowest thing a person can do, isn't that a highest good for that single individual?

Christianity presents a goal which Kierkegaard calls an eternal happiness and Christ called "Paradise". Jesus said, "Verily I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise." or it might be "Verily I say to you today, you will be with me in Paradise." (Luke 23.43) to the [[thief on the cross]].&lt;ref&gt;See Soren Kierkegaard, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, (1847) Hong translation p. 265ff&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was very close for the thief but might not be so close for the single individual who wants to be a Christian. Kierkegaard asks why the Christian should not set a few intermediate goals that can be accomplished before the eternal happiness arrives. One does not have to start with saving the world. Kierkegaard suggested exploring the relationship between [[pride]] and [[cowardliness]] to see if one of these two [[Passion (emotion)|passions]] is keeping you from reaching intermediate goals. He has advice for goal setters. Stop talking and start! Don't worry so much about the outcome. Set a goal for yourself and try to reach it. It's alright if you fail because you can start again immediately. If you need help, ask someone. But this goal should be something in particular, something concrete, so that your passions can be aroused. If Christianity is the task then it's a task that lasts a lifetime. 

{{Quotation|... the good, the truly great and noble is not just something in general and as such the general object of knowledge; it is also something particular in relation to the individual’s particular talent, so that one person is [[wikt:ability|capable]] of more than another, so that one person is capable of it in one way, another in another.  The talent itself is not the good, talent is the indifferent that nevertheless has its importance. If the capability is exceptional, then cowardliness says, “When one is so equipped, there certainly is no rush about beginning. This is such an easy thing to do; take your time, take a little loss: the expert player likes to begin when the game is half lost. I know it so well; right now I am idly hanging fire, but shortly, soon now, I will really get under way” How proudly cowardliness does talk! What does it mean to say that the task is too easy-it means that it is difficult, and by calling something more difficult, cowardliness has brought the person choosing to choose that which in the eyes of the world seems to be hardest but is the easier task. In other words, it is more difficult to begin quietly because it is less prestigious, and this bit of humiliation is precisely the difficulty. Consequently, it was not pride but cowardliness that was the counselor. Everyone knows that the moment of danger gives a person greater strength, but note well to what extent and in what way one is thereby greater. Is it such a great thing, after all, to need to have the terror of danger in order to muster one’s strength, not to mention that the opposite could also occur, that the terror would certainly be there, but the strength would vanish. It was so easy that he could not resolve to begin. It was proud, but it was cowardly, because actually he was afraid that what he had let himself call a trifle might not turn out to be exactly that, and then he would be in the awkward position of being obliged to feel his own weakness without confronting the colossal name of the supreme terror, of being obliged to stand there in disgrace, deprived of every brilliant exit. Or the capability is slight. Then cowardliness says, “This is too little to begin with.” It is very fatuous, indeed, even foolish, to say this, because if one does not have more to begin with, it must indeed always be enough, and the less one begins with the greater one becomes; but cowardliness, you see, has won sagacity over to its side, and sagacity declares that this is absolutely right, because the person who begins nothing does not lose anything either. Sagacity of that sort is certainly something of which to be proud, and pride has already discerned that rejecting everything is a much prouder thing than beginning with little, and this the person can do who rejects the little offered to him and in addition everything that was not offered to him at all. It seems proud, but cowardliness was, after all, the original inventor. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong pp. 358–359}}

{{medref|date=July 2014}}

[[Electromagnetic radiation]] can be classified into two types: [[ionizing radiation]] and [[non-ionizing radiation]], based on the capability of a single [[photon]] with more than 10&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]] energy to ionize oxygen or break [[chemical bond]]s. [[Ultraviolet]] and higher frequencies, such as [[X-ray]]s or [[gamma ray]]s are ionizing, and these pose their own special hazards: see ''[[radiation]]'' and ''[[radiation poisoning]]''. By far the most common health hazard of radiation is [[sunburn]], which causes over one million new skin cancers annually.&lt;ref name=Cleaver /&gt;

==Types of hazards==

===Electrical hazards===
Very strong radiation can induce current capable of delivering an electric shock to persons or animals.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} It can also overload and destroy electrical equipment. The induction of currents by oscillating magnetic fields is also the way in which solar storms disrupt the operation of electrical and electronic systems, causing damage to and even the explosion of power distribution transformers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/workbook/storms.html|title=Solar Storms and You: Human Impacts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; blackouts (as occurred in [[March 1989 geomagnetic storm|1989]]), and interference with electromagnetic signals (''e.g.'' radio, TV, and telephone signals).&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/podcasts/media/Blackout/Blackout_part4.htm Transcript of "Blackout: The Sun-Earth Connection", Part 4: When Solar Plasma Distorts Earth's Magnetic Field]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- I don't have time to do research to find another, more stable reference, such as from a scientific journal or textbook, but these one from NASA cover the subject with, I think, adequate authority to justify the sentence. --&gt;

===Fire hazards===
Extremely high power electromagnetic radiation can cause electric currents strong enough to create sparks (electrical arcs) when an induced voltage exceeds the [[breakdown voltage]] of the surrounding medium (''e.g.'' air at 3.0 MV/m). These sparks can then ignite flammable materials or gases, possibly leading to an explosion.

This can be a particular hazard in the vicinity of [[explosives]] or [[pyrotechnics]], since an electrical overload might ignite them. This risk is commonly referred to as Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) by the [[United States Navy]] (USN). [[United States Military Standard]] 464A (MIL-STD-464A) mandates assessment of HERO in a system, but USN document OD 30393 provides design principles and practices for controlling electromagnetic hazards to ordnance.&lt;ref name="comnavsafecen"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.public.navy.mil/comnavsafecen/Pages/acquisition/radio_frequency-radiation.aspx|title= Acquisition Safety - Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR) Hazards|publisher= Naval Safety Center - United States Navy|accessdate= 2014-07-30|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140808041218/http://www.public.navy.mil/comnavsafecen/Pages/acquisition/radio_frequency-radiation.aspx|archivedate= 2014-08-08|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the risk related to fueling is known as Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Fuel (HERF). NAVSEA OP 3565 Vol. 1 could be used to evaluate HERF, which states a maximum power density of 0.09&amp;nbsp;W/m² for frequencies under 225&amp;nbsp;MHz (i.e. 4.2 meters for a 40&amp;nbsp;W emitter).&lt;ref name="comnavsafecen" /&gt;

===Biological hazards===
{{see also|Mobile phone radiation and health#Non-thermal effects}}
The best understood biological effect of electromagnetic fields is to cause [[dielectric heating]]. For example, touching or standing around an [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] while a high-power [[transmitter]] is in operation can cause severe burns. These are exactly the kind of burns that would be caused inside a [[microwave oven]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

This heating effect varies with the power and the [[frequency]] of the electromagnetic energy, as well as the distance to the source. A measure of the heating effect is the [[specific absorption rate]] or SAR, which has units of watts per kilogram (W/kg). The [[IEEE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | title = Standard for Safety Level with Respect to Human Exposure to Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields, 3KHz to 300GHz  | journal = IEEE Std  | volume = C95.1-2005&lt;!--Should this be appended here?:" - IEEE"--&gt;  | issue =  | pages =  | publisher = IEEE  | date = October 2005  | url = https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/C95.1-2005.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many national governments have established safety limits for exposure to various frequencies of electromagnetic energy based on [[Specific absorption rate|SAR]], mainly based on [http://www.icnirp.de ICNIRP] Guidelines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection |title=Guidelines for limiting exposure to time-varying electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic fields (up to 300 GHz) |journal=Health Physics |volume=74 |issue=4 |pages=494–522 |date=April 1998 |pmid=9525427 |url=http://www.icnirp.de/documents/emfgdl.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113052702/http://www.icnirp.de/documents/emfgdl.pdf |archivedate=2008-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which guard against thermal damage.

There are publications which support the existence of complex biological and neurological effects of weaker ''non-thermal'' electromagnetic fields (see [[Bioelectromagnetics]]), including weak ELF magnetic fields&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Delgado JM, Leal J, Monteagudo JL, Gracia MG |title=Embryological changes induced by weak, extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields |journal=Journal of Anatomy |volume=134 |issue=3 |pages=533–51 |date=May 1982 |pmid=7107514 |pmc=1167891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harland JD, Liburdy RP |title=Environmental magnetic fields inhibit the antiproliferative action of tamoxifen and melatonin in a human breast cancer cell line |journal=Bioelectromagnetics |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=555–62 |year=1997 |pmid=9383244 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-186X(1997)18:8&lt;555::AID-BEM4&gt;3.0.CO;2-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modulated RF and microwave fields.&lt;ref name="Aalto S, Haarala C, Brück A, Sipilä H, Hämäläinen H, Rinne JO 2006 885–90"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aalto S, Haarala C, Brück A, Sipilä H, Hämäläinen H, Rinne JO |title=Mobile phone affects cerebral blood flow in humans |journal=Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism |volume=26 |issue=7 |pages=885–90 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16495939 |doi=10.1038/sj.jcbfm.9600279}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891061815000599|title=Microwave frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs) produce widespread neuropsychiatric effects including depression|last=Pal|first=Martin|date=2016|access-date=|doi=10.1016/j.jchemneu.2015.08.001|volume=75|journal=Journal of Chemical Neuroanatomy|pages=43–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamental mechanisms of the interaction between biological material and electromagnetic fields at non-thermal levels are not fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Binhi|first= Vladimir N|others= Repiev, A &amp; Edelev, M (translators from Russian)|title= Magnetobiology: underlying physical problems |publisher= Academic Press|location= San Diego|year= 2002|pages= 1–16|isbn= 978-0-12-100071-4|oclc= 49700531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fluorescent lighting==
[[Fluorescent light]] bulbs and tubes internally produce [[ultraviolet]] light. Normally this is converted to visible light by the [[phosphor]] film inside a protective coating. When the film is cracked by mishandling or faulty manufacturing then UV may escape at levels that could cause sunburn or even skin cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mironava|first=T. |author2=Hadjiargyrou, M. |author3=Simon, M. |author4=Rafailovich, M. H.|title=The effects of UV emission from compact fluorescent light exposure on human dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes in vitro|journal=Photochemistry and Photobiology|date=20 Jul 2012|doi=10.1111/j.1751-1097.2012.01192.x |volume=88 |issue=6 |pages=1497–1506}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Environ.

==EMR effects on the human body by frequency==
[[File:For Your Own Health (13942406865) (2).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Warning sign next to a transmitter with high field strengths]]

While the most acute exposures to harmful levels of electromagnetic radiation are immediately realized as burns, the health effects due to chronic or occupational exposure may not manifest effects for months or years.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Extremely-low frequency===
High-power, [[extremely low frequency|extremely-low-frequency]] RF with electric field levels in the low kV/m range are known to induce perceivable currents within the human body that create an annoying tingling sensation. These currents will typically flow to ground through a body contact surface such as the feet, or arc to ground where the body is well insulated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/peh-emf/publications/elf_ehc/en/index.html Extremely Low Frequency Fields Environmental Health Criteria Monograph No.238], chapter 5, page 121, WHO&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shortwave===
[[Shortwave]] (1.6 to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz) [[diathermy]] heating of human tissue only heats tissues that are good electrical conductors, such as [[blood vessels]] and [[muscle]]. [[Adipose tissue]] (fat) receives little heating by induction fields because an electrical current is not actually going through the tissues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regearlife.com/therapeutic-heating-system-uses-shortwave-diathermy.html ReBound shortwave diathermy (SWD)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209130604/http://www.regearlife.com/therapeutic-heating-system-uses-shortwave-diathermy.html |date=2014-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio frequency fields===
{{See also|Mobile phone radiation and health}}
This designation of mobile phone signals as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) (e.g. its IARC, see below) has often been misinterpreted as indicating that of some measure of risk has been observed{{snd}} however the designation indicates only that the possibility could not be conclusively ruled out using the available data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cell phones, cancer, and children |author1=Boice JD Jr |author2=Tarone RE |journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute |year=2011 |volume=103 |issue=16 |pages=1211–3 |doi=10.1093/jnci/djr285 |pmid=21795667 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)]] classified mobile phone radiation as [[List of IARC Group 2B carcinogens|Group 2B]] "possibly carcinogenic" (''rather than'' [[List of IARC Group 2A carcinogens|Group 2A]] "probably carcinogenic" nor the "is carcinogenic" Group 1). That means that there "could be some risk" of carcinogenicity, so additional research into the long-term, heavy use of mobile phones needs to be conducted.&lt;ref name="WHO_IARC_110531"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf |format= PDF|title= IARC classifies radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans |work=press release N° 208 |publisher=[[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] |date=31 May 2011 |accessdate=2 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] concluded in 2014 that "A large number of studies have been performed over the last two decades to assess whether mobile phones pose a potential health risk. To date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/en/ |title= Electromagnetic fields and public health: mobile phones - Fact sheet N°193 |publisher= World Health Organization |date=October 2014 |accessdate= 2 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euitt.upm.es/estaticos/catedra-coitt/web_salud_medioamb/Informes/informes_PDF/rf/HealthCanada/99ehd237.pdf Limits of Human Exposure to Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields in the Frequency Range from 3&amp;nbsp;kHz to 300&amp;nbsp;GHz], Canada Safety Code 6, page 63&lt;/ref&gt;

===Millimeter waves===
Recent technology advances in the developments of [[millimeter wave scanner]]s for [[airport security]] and [[WiGig]] for [[personal area network]]s have opened the 60&amp;nbsp;GHz and above microwave band to SAR exposure regulations.  Previously, microwave applications in these bands were for point-to-point satellite communication with minimal human exposure. Radiation levels in the millimeter wavelength represent the high microwave band or close to Infrared wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieice.org/proceedings/EMC09/pdf/22S1-1.pdf Characterization of 60GHz Millimeter-Wave Focusing Beam for Living-Body Exposure Experiments, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Masaki KOUZAI et al., 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infrared===
[[Infrared]] wavelengths longer than 750&amp;nbsp;nm can produce changes in the lens of the eye. [[Glassblower's cataract]] is an example of a heat injury that damages the [[anterior lens]] capsule among unprotected glass and iron workers. Cataract-like changes can occur in workers who observe glowing masses of glass or iron without protective eyewear for many hours a day.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}
 
Another important factor is the distance between the worker and the source of radiation. In the case of [[arc welding]], infrared radiation decreases rapidly as a function of distance, so that farther than three feet away from where welding takes place, it does not pose an ocular hazard anymore but, ultraviolet radiation still does.  This is why welders wear tinted glasses and surrounding workers only have to wear clear ones that filter UV.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Visible light===
Moderate and high-power lasers are potentially hazardous because they can burn the [[retina]] of the eye, or even the [[skin]]. To control the risk of injury, various specifications &amp;ndash; for example ANSI Z136 in the US, and IEC 60825 internationally &amp;ndash; define "classes" of lasers depending on their power and wavelength.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Regulations prescribe required safety measures, such as labeling lasers with specific warnings, and wearing laser safety goggles during operation (see [[laser safety]]).

As with its infrared and ultraviolet radiation dangers, welding creates an intense brightness in the visible light spectrum, which may cause temporary [[flash blindness]].  Some sources state that there is no minimum safe distance for exposure to these radiation emissions without adequate eye protection.&lt;ref name=TWI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twi-global.com/technical-knowledge/faqs/health-and-safety-faqs/faq-what-is-the-minimum-safe-distance-from-the-welding-arc-above-which-there-is-no-risk-of-eye-damage/ |title=What is the minimum safe distance from the welding arc above which there is no risk of eye damage? |publisher=The Welding Institute (TWI Global) |accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultraviolet===
Short-term exposure to strong ultraviolet sunlight causes [[sunburn]] within hours of exposure.

Ultraviolet light, specifically [[UV-B]], has been shown to cause [[cataracts]] and there is some evidence that sunglasses worn at an early age can slow its development in later life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sliney DH |title=UV radiation ocular exposure dosimetry |journal=Doc Ophthalmol |volume=88 |issue=3–4 |pages=243–54 |year=1994 |pmid=7634993 |doi=10.1007/bf01203678}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most UV light from the sun is filtered out by the atmosphere and consequently airline pilots often have high rates of cataracts because of the increased levels of UV radiation in the upper atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rafnsson | first = V |author2=Olafsdottir E |author3=Hrafnkelsson J |author4=Sasaki H |author5=Arnarsson A |author6=Jonasson F  | title = Cosmic radiation increases the risk of nuclear cataract in airline pilots: a population-based case-control study | journal = Arch Ophthalmol | volume = 123 | pages = 1102–5 | doi = 10.1001/archopht.123.8.1102 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16087845 | issue = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is hypothesized that [[Ozone depletion|depletion of the ozone layer]] and a consequent increase in levels of UV light on the ground may increase future rates of cataracts.&lt;ref name="Dobson2005"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = R.| last1 = Dobson| title = Ozone depletion will bring big rise in number of cataracts| journal = BMJ| volume = 331| issue = 7528| pages = 1292–1295| year = 2005| pmid = | pmc = 1298891 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.331.7528.1292-d }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that the lens filters UV light, so once that is removed via surgery, one may be able to see UV light.&lt;ref name=Komarnitsky&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.komar.org/faq/colorado-cataract-surgery-crystalens/ultra-violet-color-glow/ |title=Case study of ultraviolet vision after IOL removal for Cataract Surgery |author=Komarnitsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultraviolet radiation of wavelengths shorter than 300&amp;nbsp;nm ([[Ultraviolet|actinic rays]]) can damage the [[corneal epithelium]].  This is most commonly the result of exposure to the sun at high altitude, and in areas where shorter wavelengths are readily reflected from bright surfaces, such as snow, water, and sand.  UV generated by a [[welding]] arc can similarly cause damage to the cornea, known as "arc eye" or welding flash burn, a form of [[photokeratitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/799025-overview|publisher=Medscape|title=Ultraviolet keratitis|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions''', (also known as ''European Union Survey on Income and Living Conditions'') abbreviated '''EU-SILC''', is a survey department of the [[EU]].
It replaced in 2004 the ''European Community Household Panel'' (ECHP), which covered the years 1994-2003. The EU-SILC includes only minor changes relative to its predecessor the ECHP; most importantly, it significantly expands the number of countries included in the sample.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8621">The idea and practice of '''explication''' is rooted in the verb [[wiktionary:explicate|to explicate]], which concerns the process of "unfolding" and of "making clear" the meaning of things, so as to make the implicit explicit. The expression "explication" is used in both [[analytic philosophy]] and literary theory.

== Carnap's notion of explication ==

=== Summary ===

Explication can be regarded as a scientific process which transforms and replaces "an inexact prescientific concept" (which [[Carnap]] calls the explicandum), with a "new exact concept" (which he calls the explicatum). An extended document, like an essay or thesis which describes and explains the new explicit knowledge, is usually called an "Explication".  But an explication may also be contained and expressed in shorter formats, such as in paragraphs and sentences, which are deliberately drafted to emphasise the nature and impact of new explicit knowledge which draws on, and are improvements upon, previous knowledge.

=== On explication and truth ===

An explication in the Carnapian sense is purely stipulative, and thus a subclass of normative definitions. Hence, an explication can not be true or false, just more or less suitable for its purpose. (Cf. Rorty's argument about the purpose and value of philosophy in Rorty, (2003), “A pragmatist view of contemporary analytic philosophy”, in Egginton, W. and Sandbothe, M. (Eds), The Pragmatic Turn in Philosophy, Suny Press, New York, NY.)

Examples of inexact daily life concepts in need of explication are our concepts of cause and of conditionals. Our daily life concept of cause does not distinguish between necessary causes, sufficient causes, complete causes etc. Each of these more precise concepts is an explication of our natural concept of cause.

Natural language will only specify [[truth conditions]] for propositions of the form "If p, then q" for situations where "p" is true. (Most of us probably don't have any clear intuitions regarding the truth conditions of the sentence "If I go out in the sun, I will get sunburned" in situations where I never go out in the sun.) An explication of the conditional will also specify truth conditions for situations where "p" is not true.

=== Reviews of Carnap's argument ===
Carnap's argument provides a helpful foundation in understanding and clarifying the nature and value of explication in defining and describing "new" knowledge.

Others' reviews of Carnap's argument offer additional insights about the nature of explication.  In particular, Bonolio's paper (2003) "Kant’s Explication and Carnap’s Explication: The Redde Rationem", and Maher's (2007) "Explication defended", add weight to the argument that explication is an appropriate methodology for formal philosophy.

== Explication as a process versus explication as an outcome ==
When working with explication, it is essential to be clear, and to make clear whether you are dealing with the explication ''process'' (and hence working with the verb or gerund), or dealing with the ''outcomes'' of the process, such as a work which documents, describes and explains the new explicit knowledge.

== Explication as an interpretative process ==
Based on the etymology of the word explication, studies using explication, and extended argumentation we can deduce that explication in the arts, humanities and social sciences is largely an ''interpretative'' process where the outcomes - the new explicit knowledge - is open to subsequent dispute, with the possibility of additional and/or different meanings being derived in the future.

On this argument, new explicit knowledge is therefore contingent and context specific.  New explicit knowledge is also informed by the explicant's competence in dealing with the explication process, plus an ethical concern that the outcomes (i.e. the new explicit knowledge) can be considered to be an improvement and "true" (i.e.  not yet disaffirmed). (cf. Harrison, 2006).

== Semantic explication ==
In the [[Natural semantic metalanguage]] theory, explications are semantic representations of vocabulary. These explications are made up of a very limited set of words called [[semantic primes]] which are considered to have universal meaning across all languages.

An example of an explication of the word ''happy''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lexical Meaning|last=Murphy|first=M. Lynne|publisher=Cambridge Textbooks in Linguistics|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=69–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;'':''&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;
X feels happy = 
     sometimes someone thinks something like this:
          something good happened to something
          I wanted this
          I don't want other things now
     because of this, someone feels something good
     X feels like this
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;What sets the Natural Semantic Metalanguage Theory's explications apart from previous theories, is that these explications can fit into natural language, even if it sounds very awkward. For example:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;
The clown looks [happy]

The clown looks like [the clown thinks something like this: 'something good happened to me; I wanted this; I don't want other things now'; because of this, the clown feels something good].
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;Explications in the Natural Semantic Metalanguage are neither exact dictionary definitions, nor encyclopedic explanations of a concept. They often differ slightly depending upon the personal experiences of the person writing them. In this way, they can be said to "rely heavily on 'folk theories,' that is, the rather naive understandings that most of us have about how life, the universe, and everything work."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Explications of abstract concepts, such as color, do not list any scientific facts about the object or concrete definitions. Instead, the explications use comparisons and examples from the real world.

== Explication, explication de texte, and literary criticism ==

The terms 'Explication' and 'Explication de texte' have different meanings.

As argued by Carnap (1950), in science and philosophy, 
"explication consists in transforming a given more or less inexact concept into an exact one or, rather, in replacing the first by the second. We call the given concept (or the term used for it) the explicandum, and the exact concept proposed to take the place of the first (or the term proposed for it) the explicatum. The explicandum may belong to everyday language or to a previous stage in the development of scientific language. The explicatum must be given by explicit rules for its use, for example, by a definition which incorporates it into a well-constructed system of scientific either logicomathematical or empirical concepts."

In this context, 'explication' is now regarded as "an appropriate methodology for formal philosophy". (Maher, 2007).

By contrast, in [[literary criticism]], the term 'explication' is used as a proxy for the term ''[[explication de texte]]'', where additional understandings and meanings are derived from the "[[close reading]]" of (say) a poem, novel or play.

In this process, explication often involves a line-by-line or episode-by-episode commentary on what is going on in a text. While initially this might seem reasonably innocuous, ''[[explication de texte]]'', and explication per se, is an interpretative process where the resulting new knowledge, new insights or new meanings, are open to subsequent debate and disaffirmation by others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3178">In [[cell biology]], [[molecular biology]] and related fields, the word '''extracellular''' (or sometimes '''extracellular space''') means "outside the [[cell (biology)|cell]]". This space is usually taken to be outside the [[plasma membrane]]s, and occupied by fluid (see '''[[extracellular matrix]]'''). The term is used in contrast to [[intracellular]] (inside the cell).

According to the [[gene ontology]] database the extracellular space is a cellular component defined as: "That part of a multicellular organism outside the cells proper, usually taken to be outside the plasma membranes, and occupied by fluid. For multicellular organisms, the extracellular space refers to everything outside a cell, but still within the organism (excluding the extracellular matrix). Gene products from a multi-cellular organism that are secreted from a cell into the interstitial fluid or blood can therefore be annotated to this term".&lt;ref&gt;Extracellular Space by Gene Ontology database (EMBL-EBI)&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of the extracellular space includes [[metabolite]]s, [[ion]]s, various [[protein]]s and non-protein substances (e.g. DNA, RNA, lipids, microbial products etc.) that might affect cellular function. For example, [[hormone]]s, [[growth factor]]s, [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s act by travelling the extracellular space towards [[biochemical receptor]]s on cells. Other proteins that are active outside the cell are various [[enzymes]], including digestive enzymes ([[Trypsin]], [[Pepsin]]), extracellular proteinases ([[Matrix metalloproteinase]]s, [[ADAMTS]]s, [[Cathepsin]]s) and antioxidant enzymes (extracellular [[superoxide dismutase]]). Often, proteins present in the extracellular space are stored outside the cells by attaching to various extracellular matrix components ([[Collagen]]s, [[Proteoglycan]]s, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

A '''flow graph''' is a form of [[Digraph (mathematics)|digraph]] associated with a set of linear algebraic or differential equations:&lt;ref name=Abrahams/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henley2/&gt;
:"A signal flow graph is a network of nodes (or points) interconnected by directed branches, representing a set of linear algebraic equations. The nodes in a flow graph are used to represent the variables, or parameters, and the connecting branches represent the coefficients relating these variables to one another. The flow graph is associated with a number of simple rules which enable every possible solution [related to the equations] to be obtained."&lt;ref name=Abrahams/&gt;

Although this definition uses the terms "signal flow graph" and "flow graph" interchangeably, the term "signal flow graph" is most often used to designate the [[Mason graph|Mason signal-flow graph]], Mason being the originator of this terminology in his work on electrical networks.&lt;ref name=Mason/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mason2/&gt; Likewise, some authors use the term "flow graph" to refer strictly to the [[Coates graph|Coates flow graph]].&lt;ref name=Chen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoskins/&gt; According to Henley &amp; Williams:&lt;ref name="Henley2"/&gt;
:"The nomenclature is far from standardized, and...no standardization can be expected in the foreseeable future."

A designation "flow graph" that includes both the Mason graph and the Coates graph, and a variety of other forms of such graphs&lt;ref name=Murota/&gt; appears useful, and agrees with Abrahams and Coverley's and with Henley and Williams' approach.&lt;ref name=Abrahams/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henley2/&gt;

A '''directed network''' – also known as a [[flow network]] – is a particular type of flow graph. A ''network'' is a graph with real numbers associated with each of its edges, and if the graph is a digraph, the result is a ''directed network''.&lt;ref name=Chartrand/&gt; A flow graph is more general than a directed network, in that the edges may be associated with ''gains, branch gains'' or ''transmittances'', or even functions of the Laplace operator ''s'', in which case they are called ''transfer functions''.&lt;ref name=Henley2/&gt;

There is a close relationship between graphs and matrices and between digraphs and matrices.&lt;ref name=Harary/&gt; "The algebraic theory of matrices can be brought to bear on graph theory to obtain results elegantly", and conversely, graph-theoretic approaches based upon flow graphs are used for the solution of linear algebraic equations.&lt;ref name=Swamy/&gt;

== Deriving a flow graph from equations  ==
[[File:Signal flow graph example.png|thumb|200px|An example of a signal flow graph]]
[[File:Flow graph for three linear equations.png|300px|thumb|Flow graph for three simultaneous equations. The edges incident on each node are colored differently just for emphasis.]]
An example of a flow graph connected to some starting equations is presented.

The set of equations should be consistent and linearly independent. An example of such a set is:&lt;ref name="Henley2"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
1&amp;2&amp;0\\
0&amp;1&amp;1\\
5&amp;-1&amp;-1
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_1\\x_2\\x_3\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}5\\5\\0\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Consistency and independence of the equations in the set is established because the determinant of coefficients is non-zero, so a solution can be found using [[Cramer's rule]].

Using the examples from the subsection [[Mason graph#Elements of signal flow graphs|Elements of signal flow graphs]], we construct the graph In the figure, a signal-flow graph in this case. To check that the graph does represent the equations given, go to node ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''. Look at the  arrows incoming to this node (colored green for emphasis) and the weights attached to them. The equation for ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is satisfied by equating it to the sum of the nodes attached to the incoming arrows multiplied by the weights attached to these arrows. Likewise, the red arrows and their weights provide the equation for ''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the blue arrows for ''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''.

Another example is the general case of three simultaneous equations with unspecified coefficients:&lt;ref name=Deo/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
c_{11}&amp;c_{12}&amp;c_{13}\\
c_{21}&amp;c_{22}&amp;c_{23}\\
c_{31}&amp;c_{32}&amp;c_{33}
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_1\\x_2\\x_3\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}y_1\\y_2\\y_3\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
To set up the flow graph, the equations are recast so each identifies a single variable by adding it to each side. For example:
:&lt;math&gt; \left( c_{11}+1 \right) x_1+c_{12}x_2+c_{13}x_3-y_1 = x_1 \ .&lt;/math&gt;
Using the diagram and summing the incident branches into ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''  this equation is seen to be satisfied.

As all three variables enter these recast equations in a symmetrical fashion, the symmetry is retained in the graph by placing each variable at the corner of an equilateral triangle. Rotating the figure 120° simply permutes the indices. This construction can be extended to more variables by placing the node for each variable at the vertex of a regular polygon with as many vertices as there are variables.

Of course, to be meaningful the coefficients are restricted to values such that the equations are independent and consistent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7666">The '''Fundamentals of Engineering''' ('''FE''') '''exam''', also referred to as the '''Engineer in Training''' ('''EIT''') '''exam''', and formerly in some states as the '''Engineering Intern''' ('''EI''') '''exam''', is the first of two examinations that [[engineer]]s must pass in order to be licensed as a [[Professional Engineer]] in the [[United States]]. The [[exam]] is open to anyone with a [[Academic degree|degree]] in engineering or a related field, or currently enrolled in the last year of an [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology|ABET]]-accredited engineering degree program. Some state licensure boards permit students to take it prior to their final year, and numerous states allow those who have never attended an approved program to take the exam if they have a state-determined number of years of work experience in engineering. A selection of states allow those with ABET-accredited "Engineering Technology" or "ETAC" degrees to take the examination. The state of [[Michigan]] has no admission pre-requisites for the FE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.michigan.gov/lara/0,4601,7-154-35299_61343_35414_60647_35472-114639--,00.html|title= Professional Engineers Examination}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exam is administered by the [[National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying]] (NCEES).

==Structure==
As of 2014, the FE and FS exams are offered only via Computer Based Testing (CBT). The exam is now given over a total of 5 hours and 20 minutes, has 110 questions, is divided differently, etc. The subjects of the different exams are chemical, civil, electrical and computer, environmental, industrial and systems, mechanical, and other disciplines. 

Prior to 2014, the exam was divided into two 4-hour sessions with a lunch break in between. The morning session consisted of 120 questions in a range of scientific/engineering subjects and had to be taken by all examinees, while the afternoon session consisted of 60 questions and could be taken either in a specific discipline or as a general engineering test. In 2015, content changes in the exam were instituted to make it entirely discipline-specific, with a plan of weaving general engineering subject matter (e.g. math and science fundamentals) throughout the exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nspe.org/resources/pe-magazine/march-2015/evolution-fe|title=The Evolution of the FE - National Society of Professional Engineers|website=www.nspe.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less of the "full breadth" of most traditional engineering undergraduate curricula will be captured with this approach - such as the broad math and science foundation spanning chemistry, physics, mechanics (i.e. statics and dynamics), materials science, computer science, electronics/circuits, engineering design, and the standard range of engineering mathematics (i.e. calculus, differential equations, statistics). A concern was that, while most undergraduate engineering students are in fact exposed to most of these subjects, they may not necessarily take courses in specialized topics such as thermodynamics and fluid mechanics.

A scaled score of 70 is required to pass the exam.{{cn|date=June 2016}} This does not mean one needs to answer 70% of the answers correctly to pass, however. A portion of previous exam questions are then given on subsequent exams. After the exam, a statistical analysis of these questions is used to equate the new test to the benchmark test. This makes all of the tests more or less equal in difficulty.

Those who pass the exam are sometimes designated [[Engineer In Training]] or [[Engineer Intern]], depending on their state's licensure board's approach to recognizing those who are partway through the licensure process. After obtaining a given amount of work experience (the length of which is set by state law and may be based on the type of degree received), an EIT/EI may qualify to take the [[Principles and Practice in Engineering Exam|Professional Engineer]] (PE) exam. Actual licensure can then be applied for and awarded upon successful completion of the PE exam. The standard time of work experience (which may need to be under a [[Professional Engineer]]) is four years in most US states, for graduates of an ABET-accredited engineering program.

==Taking the exam==
Writing tools and scratch paper may not be brought to the testing site. A fine-tip pen and a test booklet may be used as scratch paper for working problems. No calculators are allowed except for those specifically approved by NCEES; these models have no programming or communications capabilities to prevent possibilities of cheating. The only reference material that may be used is a handbook which is provided to examinees on the testing program. For study purposes, the reference handbook may be obtained from the NCEES website or by purchasing a hard copy. However, examinees may not bring their own copies to the test site; they must use the ones issued to them by the testing program.  

===Calculator policy===
NCEES allows only the following calculators to be used on the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://ncees.org/exams/calculator/|title=  NCEES Calculator policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Casio]] [[fx-115]] and [[fx-991]] (all models)
* [[Hewlett-Packard]] [[HP 33s]] and [[HP 35s]]
* [[Texas Instruments]] [[TI-30|TI-30X]] and [[TI-36|TI-36X]] (all models)

The calculator must clearly display its model number so that exam proctors can quickly identify the calculator and approve for use during the exam. The list of allowed calculators is revised each November. It is crucial that any examinee check the NCEES website to verify their calculator is acceptable. Using a non-permitted calculator after the exam has begun will result in the examinee having his or her exam confiscated immediately and the exam not being scored.{{cn|date=May 2012}} Calculator covers may not be brought into the testing room.

==U.S. Patent Office==
Passage of the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam or graduation with any bachelor's degree or equivalent experience, satisfies the [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]]'s technical requirements for sitting for its [[USPTO registration examination|registration examination]] to become either a registered [[patent attorney]] or patent agent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uspto.gov/ip/boards/oed/GRB_March_2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  This is specified in "Category C" on page 8 of the General Requirements Bulletin.

Thomas Tanselle''' (born 1934) is an [[United States|American]] textual critic, [[bibliographer]], and book collector, especially known for his work on [[Herman Melville]]. He was Vice-President, [[John Simon Guggenheim Foundation]], 1978-2006.&lt;ref name="Oxford Companion to the Book"&gt;"G. Thomas Tanselle," ''[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198606536.001.0001/acref-9780198606536-e-4776 Oxford Companion to the Book]'' (2010) accessed December 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Tanselle is a native of [[Lebanon, Indiana]] and received his undergraduate degree from Yale University. Tanselle attended graduate school at [[Northwestern University]] where he studied with [[Harrison Hayford]] among others. He received his PhD in 1959 from the Department of English where his dissertation was titled ''Faun at the Barricades: the life and work of [[Floyd Dell]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2289522 Faun at the Barricades: the life and work of Floyd Dell] in WorldCat, accessed December 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1960 through 1978 he taught at the [[University of Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name=nypl&gt;[http://archives.nypl.org/mss/6331 G. Thomas Tanselle papers, 1960-2005].&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to New York City in 1978, he served as vice president of the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]] until 2006.&lt;ref name=nypl/&gt;  He was an adjunct professor of English at Columbia University, and co-editor of the Northwestern-Newberry Edition of the writings of Herman Melville. He was president of the [[Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia]] 1993-2006. He is also a member of the board of directors and textual consultant of the [[Library of America]].&lt;ref name="Oxford Companion to the Book"/&gt;  He was president of the Grolier Club, the pre-eminent American society of bibliophiles, 1986-1990. 

Tanselle held fellowships from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]] (1969–70), [[American Council of Learned Societies]] (1973-74), and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (1977–78).&lt;ref name=nypl/&gt;

==Theories of textual editing and influence==
Tanselle absorbed the principles of [[Walter W. Greg]] and [[Fredson Bowers]], who developed the theory of [[textual criticism]], a branch of textual scholarship, philology, and literary criticism that is concerned with the identification and removal of transcription errors in texts, both manuscripts and printed books, in order to create a text which most closely reflects the author's intent. He has been called the "most prominent, consistent, and authoritative defender of the Greg-Bowers approach to editing," which is now the "dominant theoretical and practical position in Anglo-American editing." Tanselle has sought to accommodate legitimate critiques of its limitations, such as the insistence on the difference between substantive and accidentals, that is, the difference between the words and their spelling and punctuation. {{sfnb|Groden|1991|p=263}} Tanselle, says one scholar, like Greg and Bowers,  postulates the notion of an "ideal 'correct' text, measured against which extant texts show various degrees of 'corruption' that the editor seeks to remove." Tanselle follows this tradition more flexibly, but still comes to rest on the "principle of the author's final intention,'" which the "editor (or critic) seeks first to understand and then to implement..." This position is opposed to the [[New Criticism]], which rejects the [[intentional fallacy]], since the author's intentions are not relevant to the work of art once it is finished.{{sfnb|Bornstein|1991|p=5}}

He then applied these principles to the study of American literature. {{sfnb|Tanselle|1975}} He was particularly active as textual editor for the [[Herman Melville bibliography|Northwestern-Newberry]] edition of the works of [[Herman Melville]] to make a [[Textual criticism#Process|critical edition]], as approved by [[Textual criticism#The MLA's CEAA and CSE|The Center for Scholarly Editions]]. {{sfnb|Tanselle|1968}}
&lt;!-- For a critique of Tanselle, see Charles Ross, 'The limits of idealism in textual theory: "work" and "text" in G. Thomas Tanselle's A Rationale of Textual Criticism', in Critical Survey, 7:3 (1995), pp. 358-62. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3019">'''Intercultural therapy''' is a form of [[psychotherapy]] aimed at benefiting [[culturally diverse]] groups. It recognises the importance of race, culture, beliefs, values, attitudes, religion and language in the life of the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kareem|first1=Jafar|title=Intercultural Therapy: Themes, Interpretations and Practice|date=1999|publisher=Blackwell Science Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-0632052240}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been developed by Jafar Kareem in his book ''Intercultural Therapy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kareem|first1=Jafar|title=Intercultural Therapy: Themes, Interpretations and Practice|date=1999|publisher=Blackwell Science Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-0632052240}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kareem (1992) believed that there are some intrinsic differences between individual human beings, either in their biology, their personality or both, and that both inter- and intrapsychic events profoundly affect an individual's psyche and develop as part of their unconscious life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kareem|first1=Jafar|title=Intercultural Therapy: Themes, Interpretations and Practice|date=1999|publisher=Blackwell Science Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-0632052240}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events of the external world, then, are real but they are also internalised. 

Intercultural therapy responds to the cultural variances identified by the field of [[anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zanatta|first=Francesca|date=2008|title=Intercultural therapy and ethnopsychoanalysis: Are they both 'possession'?|journal=Opticon 1826|issue=4|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/opticon1826/archive/issue4/Art_BMS_Zanatta_Ethnopsychoanalysis_Pub.pdf|doi=10.5334/opt.040810}}&lt;/ref&gt; An intercultural therapist must take the external realities of a client's life into account, such as poverty, refugee status, racism, sexism, physical health and physical abilities. Kareem believed that failure to understand cultural issues may lead to major diagnostic and therapeutic errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kareem|first1=Jafar|title=Intercultural Therapy: Themes, Interpretations and Practice|date=1999|publisher=Blackwell Science Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-0632052240}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Intercultural therapy recognises the differences and similarities of various aspects of culture for both the client and therapist, and that the very fact of being from another culture involves both conscious and unconscious assumptions, both in the patient and in the therapist. These unconscious assumptions sometimes mean traditional modes of therapy do not address the needs of someone from outside a dominant culture, or that therapy is not offered to them in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Troche|first1=Ursula|title=Intercultural therapy|journal=The Independent Practitioner|date=2008|volume=Summer|page=2|url=http://bacppp.org.uk/_sitedata/1391515928%20Z3A0IvmuG/JournalsFromOldSite/2970_summer08.pdf|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1895">[[File:Israel  Lewy cropped.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Rabbi Dr. Israel Lewy]]
'''Israel Lewy''' (7 January 1841 – 8 September 1917) was a [[Germany|German]]-[[Jew]]ish scholar.  
==Biography==
He was educated at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau|Jewish Theological Seminary]] and the [[University of Breslau|University]] in [[Breslau]]. In 1874 he was appointed [[docent]] at the Lehranstalt für die [[Wissenschaft des Judenthums]] in [[Berlin]], and in 1883, on the death of [[David Joël]], he was called to the seminary at Breslau. Lewy's knowledge of [[Talmud|Talmudic literature]] was unusually wide; he was endowed also with an exceptionally acute and dispassionate critical spirit and with a faculty for grasping the proper importance of details. 

His first publication was ''Ueber Einige Fragmente aus der Mischna des Abba Saul'' (Berlin, 1876), in which he showed that the [[Mishnah]] collections of the foremost teachers in the period before the final redaction of the Mishnah itself, including that of [[Abba Saul]], agreed as regards all the essential points of the [[Halakha]]. 

''Ein Wort über die Mechilta des R. Simon'' (Breslau, 1889) was likewise an authoritative work in the field of halakhic exegesis. Lewy also published ''Interpretation des Ersten, Zweiten und Dritten Abschnitts des [[Jerusalem Talmud|Palästinischen Talmud]]-[[Nezikin|Traktates Nesikin]]'' (ib. 1895-1902), and ''Ein Vortrag über das Ritual des [[Passover|Pesach]]-Abends'' (ib. 1904).

{{distinguish|text=[[Jurimetrics (journal)]]}}
'''Jurimetrics''' is the application of quantitative methods, and often especially [[statistics]], to [[law]].&lt;ref&gt;Zabala, F.J., Silveira, F.F., "Jurimetria: Estatística Aplicada ao Direito". ''Revista Direito e Liberdade'', Natal, v. 16, n. 1, pp. 73-86, Jan./Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="garner"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage|page=488|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0195142365|chapter=jurimetrics|isbn=0195142365|first=Bryan A. |last=Garner|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject has gained considerable currency in both the United States and Brazil. In the United States, the journal ''[[Jurimetrics (journal)|Jurimetrics]]'' is published by the [[American Bar Association]] and [[Arizona State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/publications/jurimetrics|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=2015-02-06|title=Jurimetrics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Brazil, the field is the focus of a dedicated scholarly organization, the Brazilian Jurimetrics Association, which describes itself as "a nonprofit organization gathering researchers in Law and Mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abjur.org.br/en/|publisher=Brazilian Jurimetrics Association|title=Check out our activities|accessdate=2015-02-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207082908/http://www.abjur.org.br/en/|archivedate=2015-02-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined in 1949 by [[Lee Loevinger]] in his article "Jurimetrics: The Next Step Forward".&lt;ref name="garner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loevinger, L. "Jurimetrics: The Next Step Forward". Heidi Online, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Showing the influence of [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], Loevinger quoted&lt;ref&gt;Loevinger, L. "Jurimetrics: Science and prediction in the field of law". ''[[Minnesota Law Review]]'', vol. 46, HeinOnline, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes' celebrated phrase that "the man of the future is the man of statistics and the master of economics.".&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, ''The Path of the Law'', 10 ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' (1897) 457.&lt;/ref&gt; The first work on this topic is attributed to [[Nicolaus I Bernoulli]] in his doctoral dissertation ''De Usu Artis Conjectandi in Jure'', written in 1709.

The possibilities for applying jurimetrics are diverse, from analyses of the frequency of proceedings to the development of models to support decisionmaking.  Jurimetrics can be considered from different perspectives depending on one's focus.

== Jurimetrics and the Law and Economics school ==

The basic difference between jurimetrics and [[Law and Economics]] is simply the fact that jurimetrics simultaneously encompasses [[statistics]] and [[law]], while [[Law and Economics]] deals with [[econometrics]] ([[economics]] and [[statistics]]). When [[statistics]], [[law]] and [[economics]] all coincide, either a jurimetric or an econometric approach may be considered.

[[Image:KanishkaBuddhaDetail2.JPG|thumb|Detail of the Buddha, surrounded by [[cherubs]], with devotee or [[bodhisattava]]]]
The '''Kanishka casket''' or '''Kanishka reliquary''', is a [[Buddhist]] [[reliquary]] made in gilded copper, and dated to the first year of the reign of the [[Kushan]] emperor [[Kanishka]], in 127 CE.  It is now in the [[Peshawar Museum]] in the historic city of Peshawar, Pakistan. 

==History and description==
It was discovered in a deposit chamber under the monumental [[Kanishka stupa]] (described by Chinese pilgrims in the 7th century as the tallest stupa in all India), during the archeological excavations in 1908-1909 in Shah-ji-Dheri on the outskirts of [[Peshawar]]. It is said to have contained three bone fragments of the Buddha,&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, D. B. (1908-9): "Excavations at Shāh-ji-Dherī." ''Archaeological Survey of India'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; which were forwarded to [[Burma]] by the British following the excavation,&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, John H. (1909): "Archaeological Exploration in India, 1908-9." (Section on: "The stūpa of Kanishka and relics of the Buddha"). ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society'', 1909, pp. 1056-1061.&lt;/ref&gt; where they still remain.

The casket is today at the [[Peshawar Museum]], and a copy is in the [[British Museum]]. The casket is dedicated in [[Kharoshthi]]. The inscription reads:

: "(*mahara)jasa kanishkasa kanishka-pure nagare aya gadha-karae deya-dharme sarva-satvana hita-suhartha bhavatu mahasenasa sagharaki dasa agisala nava-karmi ana*kanishkasa vihare mahasenasa sangharame"

:"In the acceptance (i.e. for the acceptance) of the Sarvāstivādin teachers, this perfume box is the meritorious gift of Mahārāja Kanishka [ . . . ''jasa Kani''] in the city of Kanishkapura [''Kanishkapure nagare'']. May (it) be for the welfare and happiness of all beings. . . . ''sa'', the superintendent of construction of the refectory in Kanishka's vihāra [''nashkasa vihare''], in Mahāsena's saṁghārāma [''Mahasenasa saṁgharame'']." &lt;ref&gt;Translated by B. N. Mukherjee. ''BMQ'', Vol. XXVIII, pp. 41-43. Quoted in: Dobbins, K. Walton. (1971): ''The Stūpa and Vihāra of Kanishka I''. The Asiatic Society of Bengal Monograph Series, Vol. XVIII. Calcutta.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally it was believed, that the text is signed by the maker, a Greek artist named ''Agesilas'', who oversaw work at Kanishka's [[stupa]]s (caitya), confirming the direct involvement of Greeks with Buddhist realizations at such a late date: "The servant ([[dasa]]) Agisalaos, the superintendent of works at the vihara of Kanishka in the monastery of Mahasena" ("dasa agisala nava-karmi ana*kaniskasa vihara mahasenasa sangharame"). However, a recent cleaning of the casket had shown that the old reading was not accurate. Instead, the name is to be read ''agnisala'', which is the [[refectory]] of the monastery.&lt;ref&gt;Prudence R. Myer: ''Again the Kanishka Casket'', In: ''The Art Bulletin'', Vol. 48, No. 3/4 (Sep.–Dec., 1966), pp. 396–403 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3048396]&lt;/ref&gt;

The lid of the casket shows the Buddha on lotus pedestal, and worshipped by [[Brahma]] and [[Indra]].

The edge of the lid is decorated by a frieze of flying geese, or [[Hamsa bird|hamsa]], symbolizing the travel of departing souls and the removal from [[samsara]]. Some of the geese have a wreath of victory in their beak.

The body of the casket represents a Kushan monarch, probably Kanishka in person, with the Iranian [[Sun god]] and [[Moon god]] at his side. On the sides are two images of a seated Buddha, worshiped a royal figures, possibly a [[bodhisattava]].

A garland, supported by [[cherubs]] goes around the scene in typical Hellenistic style.

The relics themselves were forwarded to Burma by the British in 1910 in order to safeguard them. They are today visible in [[Mandalay]]. The three fragments of bone are believed to be true relics of Gautama Buddha.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7180">[[File:Experimental Station Map.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Map of the DuPont Experimental Station in Wilmington, DE showing the major research buildings.]]

The [[DuPont Experimental Station]] is the main research and development site of [[DuPont]] and [[Chemours]]. It is a major component of the [[DuPont Historic Corridor]], a section of [[Delaware Route 141]] that traces the history of both the [[Du Pont family]] and the DuPont company. The site map is shown in the Figure and the buildings are numbered. The map is not fixed in time in that not all of the building shown existed in the same time frame. Some were demolished before other were built.

The site was initiated along the banks of the [[Brandywine River]] so the lowest numbers are in the lower left of the map. Expansion has taken place toward the upper right, slowly displacing the DuPont Country Club, so those are the more modern buildings and the more recent history of the site. Each of the business units of the company have had research facilities at the Experimental Station, so the inventions listed below reflect the nature of the research carried out in each building.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.dupont.com/Career_Center/en_US/assets/downloads/duPont_r_d_history.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4270">In the Americas (defined as [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) [[ITU region|region]] 2), the [[FM broadcast band]] consists of 101 channels, each 200 kHz wide, in the frequency range from 87.8 to 108.0 MHz, with "center frequencies" running from 87.9 Mhz to 107.9 MHz. For most purposes an FM station is associated with its center frequency. However, each FM frequency has also been assigned a channel number, which ranges from 200 to 300.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/fm-frequencies-end-odd-decimal"Why Do FM Frequencies End in an Odd Decimal?"] (fcc.gov)&lt;/ref&gt;

FM channel numbers are most commonly used for internal regulatory purposes. The range originally began with channel 201 (88.1 MHz), or a value high enough to avoid confusion with television channel numbers, which over the years have had values ranging from [[Channel 1 (North American TV)|1]] to [[channel 83|83]]. Having a gap between the highest TV channel number and the lowest FM channel number allowed for expansion, which occurred in the 1980s when FM channel 200 (87.9 MHz) was added.

FM channel numbers are commonly used for listing FM Station Allotments, which are the FM station assignments designated for individual communities. In the United States they are also used in the callsigns of low-powered FM [[Broadcast relay station|translators]] relaying AM or FM station signals. For example, the "237" in the callsign for translator [[K237FR]] in Tumwater, Washington indicates that the station is transmitting on channel 237, which corresponds to 95.3 MHz.

The following is a list of [[marine ecoregion]]s, as defined by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and [[The Nature Conservancy]]

The WWF/Nature Conservancy scheme groups the individual ecoregions into 12 [[marine realm]]s, which represent the broad latitudinal divisions of polar, temperate, and tropical seas, with subdivisions based on ocean basins. The marine realms are subdivided into 62 [[marine province]]s, which include one or more of the 232 marine ecoregions.

The WWF/Nature Conservancy scheme currently encompasses only coastal and [[continental shelf]] areas; ecoregions of the deep oceans have not yet been delineated.

'''Mahavihara''' ({{IAST|Mahāvihāra}}) is the [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] term for a great [[vihara]] (Buddhist monastery) and is used to describe a monastic complex of viharas.

==Mahaviharas of India==
A range of monasteries grew up in ancient [[Magadha]] (modern [[Bihar]]) and [[Bengal]]. According to Tibetan sources, five great mahaviharas stood out during the [[Pala empire|Pāla]] period: Vikramashila, the premier university of the era; Nalanda, past its prime but still illustrious, Somapura, Odantapurā, and Jaggadala.&lt;ref&gt;Vajrayogini: Her Visualization, Rituals, and Forms by Elizabeth English. Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-329-X}} pg 15&lt;/ref&gt; The five monasteries formed a network; "all of them were under state supervision" and there existed "a system of co-ordination among them . . it seems from the evidence that the different seats of Buddhist learning that functioned in eastern India under the Pāla were regarded together as forming a network, an interlinked group of institutions," and it was common for great scholars to move easily from position to position among them.&lt;ref&gt;''Buddhist Monks And Monasteries Of India: Their History And Contribution To Indian Culture.'' by Dutt, Sukumar. George Allen and Unwin Ltd, London 1962. pg 352-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nalanda===
{{Main|Nalanda}}
The famous Nalanda Mahavihara was founded a few centuries earlier; [[Xuanzang]] speaks about its magnificence and grandeur. Reference to this monastery is found in Tibetan and Chinese sources. During the Pāla period, Nālānda was less singularly outstanding, as other Pālā establishments "must have drawn away a number of learned monks from Nālānda when all of the  . . came under the aegis of the Pālās."&lt;ref&gt;''Buddhist Monks And Monasteries Of India: Their History And Contribution To Indian Culture.'' by Dutt, Sukumar. George Allen and Unwin Ltd, London 1962. pg 344&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the fame of this monastery lingered even after the Pala period.

===Odantapura===
{{Main|Odantapura}}
Odantapuri, also called Odantapura or Uddandapura, was a Buddhist vihara in what is now Bihar, India. It was established by King Gopala of the Pala dynasty in the 7th century. It is considered the second oldest of India's universities and was situated in Magadh. Currently it is known as the Bihar Sharif city (Headquarters of Nalanda District). Acharya Sri Ganga of Vikramashila had been a student here. According to the Tibetan records there were about 12,000 students at Odantapuri. Odantpuri was situated at a mountain called Hiranya Prabhat Parvat and the bank of the river Panchanan.

===Vikramashila===
{{Main|Vikramashila}}
Reference to a monastery known as Vikramashila is found in Tibetan records. The Pala ruler Dharmapala was its founder. The exact site of this vihara is at Antichak, a small village in Bhagalpur district (Bihar). The monastery had 107 temples and 50 other institutions providing room for 108 monks. It attracted scholars from neighbouring countries.

==Mahaviharas of Bangladesh==

===Somapura===
{{Main|Somapura}}
Somapura Mahavihara was located at Paharpur, 46.5&amp;nbsp;km to the north-west of [[Mahasthangarh]] in [[Bangladesh]]. The available data suggests that the Pala ruler Dharmapala founded the vihara. It followed the traditional [[cruciform]] plan for the central shrine. There were 177 individual cells around the central courtyard. There were central blocks in the middle of the eastern, southern and western sides. These might have been subsidiary chapels. It was the premier vihara of its kind and its fame lingered till the 11th century CE.

===Jagaddala===
{{Main|Jagaddala}}
Jagaddala Mahavihara was a [[Buddhist]] monastery and seat of learning in [[Varendra]], a geographical unit in present north Bengal.&lt;ref name="India 1962. pg 377"&gt;''Buddhist Monks And Monasteries Of India: Their History And Contribution To Indian Culture.'' by Dutt, Sukumar. George Allen and Unwin Ltd, London 1962. pg 377&lt;/ref&gt;  It was founded by the later kings of the [[Pāla dynasty]], probably [[Ramapala]] ({{circa|1077|1120}}), most likely at a site near the present village of Jagdal in [[Dhamoirhat Upazila]] in the north-west [[Bangladesh]] on the border with India,  near Paharapur.&lt;ref name="UNESCO World Heritage website"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1212/ UNESCO World Heritage website]&lt;/ref&gt;



===Shalban Vihara===
{{Main|Shalban Vihara}}
also known as Bhavadev Bihar is another large monastery which flourished between 7th to 12th centuries AD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Shalvan_Vihara |website=Banglapedia |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Located in Comilla, Bangladesh,it was established by King Bhava Deva in the Lalmai Hills Ridge.

==Mahavihara of Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka==
{{Main|Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya}}
The '''Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya''' ([[Pāli|Pali]] for "Great Monastery") was an important monastery for [[Theravada Buddhism]] in [[Sri Lanka]]. It was founded by king [[Devanampiya Tissa]] (247–207 BCE) in his capital [[Anuradhapura]]. The Mahavihara was the place where the Mahavihara orthodoxy was established by monks such as [[Buddhaghosa]]. The traditional Theravadin account provided by the Mahavamsa stands in contrast to the writings of the [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese Buddhist]] monk [[Faxian]] (Ch. 法顯), who journeyed to [[India]] and Sri Lanka in the early 5th century (between 399 and 414 CE). He recorded that the Mahavihara was not only intact, but housed 3000 monks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chapter XXXIX: The Cremation of an Arhat |work=A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2124 |accessdate=2010-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field of '''materials science''', also commonly termed '''materials science and engineering''' is the design and discovery of new materials, particularly [[solid]]s. The intellectual origins of materials science stem from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], when researchers began to use analytical thinking from [[chemistry]], [[physics]], and [[engineering]] to understand ancient, [[Empirical relationship|phenomenological]] observations in [[metallurgy]] and [[mineralogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Eddy|first1= Matthew Daniel|title= The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School 1750–1800|date= 2008|publisher= Ashgate|url= https://www.academia.edu/1112014|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150903230852/http://www.academia.edu/1112014/The_Language_of_Mineralogy_John_Walker_Chemistry_and_the_Edinburgh_Medical_School_1750-1800_2008_|archivedate= 2015-09-03|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite book |last= Smith |first= Cyril Stanley |authorlink= Cyril Stanley Smith |title= A Search for Structure |date= 1981 |publisher= MIT Press |isbn= 978-0262191913}}&lt;/ref&gt; Materials science still incorporates elements of physics, chemistry, and engineering. As such, the field was long considered by academic institutions as a sub-field of these related fields. Beginning in the 1940s, materials science began to be more widely recognized as a specific and distinct field of science and engineering, and major technical universities around the world created dedicated schools of the study, within either the Science or Engineering schools, hence the naming. 
:Materials science is a syncretic discipline hybridizing metallurgy, ceramics, solid-state physics, and chemistry. It is the first example of a new academic discipline emerging by fusion rather than fission.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rustum Roy]] (1979) interdisciplinary science on campus, pages 161–96 in ''Interdisciplinarity and Higher Education'', J.J. Kockelmans editor, [[Pennsylvania State University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Many of the most pressing scientific problems humans currently face are due to the limits of the materials that are available and how they are used. Thus, breakthroughs in materials science are likely to affect the future of technology significantly.&lt;ref name=BESAC2008&gt;{{Cite report |last= Hemminger |first= John C. |date= August 2010 |title= Science for Energy Technology: Strengthening the Link between Basic Research and Industry |url= http://science.energy.gov/bes/news-and-resources/reports/ |publisher= United States Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee |accessdate= 3 August 2018 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150821010038/http://science.energy.gov/bes/news-and-resources/reports/ |archivedate= 2015-08-21 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=carbcap&gt;{{Cite report |last1= Alivisatos |first1= Paul |last2= Buchanan |first2= Michelle |date= March 2010 |title= Basic Research Needs for Carbon Capture: Beyond 2020 |url= http://science.energy.gov/bes/news-and-resources/reports/ |publisher= United States Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee |accessdate= 3 August 2018 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150821010038/http://science.energy.gov/bes/news-and-resources/reports/ |archivedate= 2015-08-21 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Materials scientists emphasize understanding how the history of a material (its ''processing'') influences its structure, and thus the material's properties and performance. The understanding of processing-structure-properties relationships is called the {{Section link||materials paradigm}}. This paradigm is used to advance understanding in a variety of research areas, including [[nanotechnology]], [[biomaterial]]s, and metallurgy. Materials science is also an important part of [[forensic engineering]] and [[failure analysis]] – investigating materials, products, structures or components which fail or do not function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property. Such investigations are key to understanding, for example, the causes of various [[aviation accidents and incidents]].

==History==
{{Main|History of materials science}}
[[File:Sword bronze age (2nd version).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A late [[Bronze Age sword]] or dagger blade.]]
The material of choice of a given era is often a defining point. Phrases such as [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age]], and [[Industrial Revolution|Steel Age]] are historic, if arbitrary examples. Originally deriving from the manufacture of [[ceramic]]s and its putative derivative metallurgy, materials science is one of the oldest forms of engineering and applied science. Modern materials science evolved directly from [[metallurgy]], which itself evolved from mining and (likely) ceramics and earlier from the use of fire. A major breakthrough in the understanding of materials occurred in the late 19th century, when the American scientist [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] demonstrated that the [[thermodynamic]] properties related to [[atom]]ic structure in various [[phase (matter)|phases]] are related to the physical properties of a material. Important elements of modern materials science are a product of the [[space race]]: the understanding and [[engineering]] of the metallic [[alloy]]s, and [[silica]] and [[carbon]] materials, used in building space vehicles enabling the exploration of space. Materials science has driven, and been driven by, the development of revolutionary technologies such as [[rubber]]s, [[plastic]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, and [[biomaterial]]s.

Before the 1960s (and in some cases decades after), many ''materials science'' departments were named ''metallurgy'' departments, reflecting the 19th and early 20th century emphasis on metals. The growth of materials science in the United States was catalyzed in part by the [[DARPA|Advanced Research Projects Agency]], which funded a series of university-hosted laboratories in the early 1960s "to expand the national program of basic research and training in the materials sciences."&lt;ref name=martin-pip&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Joseph D. |title=What's in a Name Change? Solid State Physics, Condensed Matter Physics, and Materials Science|journal=Physics in Perspective|date=2015|volume=17|issue=1|doi=10.1007/s00016-014-0151-7|pages=3–32|bibcode= 2015PhP....17....3M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field has since broadened to include every class of materials, including [[Ceramic engineering|ceramics]], [[polymer]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, [[magnetism|magnetic]] materials, [[medical implant]] materials, biological materials, and nanomaterials, with modern materials classed within 3 distinct groups: Ceramic, Metal or Polymer. The prominent change in materials science during the last two decades is active usage of computer simulation methods to find new compounds, predict various properties.

[[File:Materials science tetrahedron;structure, processing, performance, and proprerties.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|The materials paradigm represented in the form of a tetrahedron.]]
A material is defined as a substance (most often a solid, but other condensed phases can be included) that is intended to be used for certain applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nmat/authors/index.html "For Authors: Nature Materials"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801234616/http://www.nature.com/nmat/authors/index.html |date=2010-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a myriad of materials around us—they can be found in anything from buildings to spacecraft. Materials can generally be further divided into two classes: [[crystal]]line and [[amorphous|non-crystalline]]. The traditional examples of materials are [[metal]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, [[ceramic]]s and [[polymer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Callister, Jr.,  Rethwisch. "Materials Science and Engineering – An Introduction" (8th ed.). John Wiley and Sons, 2009 p.5-6&lt;/ref&gt; New and advanced materials that are being developed include [[nanomaterials]], [[biomaterial]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Callister, Jr.,  Rethwisch. Materials Science and Engineering – An Introduction (8th ed.). John Wiley and Sons, 2009 p.10-12&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Photovoltaic cell|energy materials]] to name a few.
 
The basis of materials science involves studying the structure of materials, and relating them to their [[Material properties|properties]]. Once a materials scientist knows about this structure-property correlation, they can then go on to study the relative performance of a material in a given application. The major determinants of the structure of a material and thus of its properties are its constituent chemical elements and the way in which it has been processed into its final form. These characteristics, taken together and related through the laws of [[thermodynamics]] and [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]], govern a material's [[microstructure]], and thus its properties.

===Structure===
As mentioned above, structure is one of the most important components of the field of materials science. Materials science examines the structure of materials from the atomic scale, all the way up to the macro scale. [[Characterization (materials science)|Characterization]] is the way materials scientists examine the structure of a material. This involves methods such as diffraction with [[X-ray]]s, [[electron]]s, or [[neutron]]s, and various forms of [[spectroscopy]] and [[chemical analysis]] such as [[Raman spectroscopy]], [[energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|energy-dispersive spectroscopy]] (EDS), [[chromatography]], [[thermal analysis]], [[electron microscope]] analysis, etc. Structure is studied at various levels, as detailed below.

====Atomic structure====
This deals with the atoms of the materials, and how they are arranged to give molecules, crystals, etc. Much of the electrical, magnetic and chemical properties of materials arise from this level of structure. The length scales involved are in angstroms([[Å]]).
The way in which the atoms and molecules are bonded and arranged is fundamental to studying the properties and behavior of any material.

====Nanostructure====

Nanostructure deals with objects and structures that are in the 1—100&amp;nbsp;nm range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=BJIOBN00000200000400MR17000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=Yes |author= Cristina Buzea |author2= Ivan Pacheco |author3= Kevin Robbie |last-author-amp= yes |title= Nanomaterials and Nanoparticles: Sources and Toxicity |journal= Biointerphases |volume= 2 |date= 2007 |pages= MR17–MR71 |doi= 10.1116/1.2815690 |pmid= 20419892 |issue= 4 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120703014917/http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=BJIOBN00000200000400MR17000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=Yes |archivedate= 2012-07-03 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many materials, atoms or molecules agglomerate together to form objects at the nanoscale. This causes many interesting electrical, magnetic, optical, and mechanical properties.

In describing nanostructures it is necessary to differentiate between the number of dimensions on the [[nanoscale]]. [[Nanotextured surface]]s have ''one dimension'' on the nanoscale, i.e., only the thickness of the surface of an object is between 0.1 and 100&amp;nbsp;nm. Nanotubes have ''two dimensions'' on the nanoscale, i.e., the diameter of the tube is between 0.1 and 100&amp;nbsp;nm; its length could be much greater. Finally, spherical [[nanoparticle]]s have ''three dimensions'' on the nanoscale, i.e., the particle is between 0.1 and 100&amp;nbsp;nm in each spatial dimension. The terms nanoparticles and [[ultrafine particle]]s (UFP) often are used synonymously although UFP can reach into the micrometre range. The term 'nanostructure' is often used when referring to magnetic technology. Nanoscale structure in biology is often called [[ultrastructure]].

Materials which atoms and molecules form constituents in the nanoscale (i.e., they form nanostructure) are called nanomaterials. Nanomaterials are subject of intense research in the materials science community due to the unique properties that they exhibit.

====Microstructure====
{{Main|Microstructure}}
[[File:Pearlite.jpg|thumb|right|Microstructure of pearlite.]]
Microstructure is defined as the structure of a prepared surface or thin foil of material as revealed by a microscope above 25× magnification. It deals with objects from 100&amp;nbsp;nm to a few cm. The microstructure of a material (which can be broadly classified into metallic, polymeric, ceramic and composite) can strongly influence physical properties such as strength, toughness, ductility, hardness, corrosion resistance, high/low temperature behavior, wear resistance, and so on. Most of the traditional materials (such as metals and ceramics) are microstructured.

The manufacture of a perfect [[crystal]] of a material is physically impossible. For example, any crystalline material will contain [[crystallographic defect|defects]] such as [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitates]], grain boundaries ([[Hall–Petch|Hall–Petch relationship]]), vacancies, interstitial atoms or substitutional atoms. The microstructure of materials reveals these larger defects, so that they can be studied, with significant advances in simulation resulting in exponentially increasing understanding of how defects can be used to enhance material properties.

====Macro structure====
Macro structure is the appearance of a material in the scale millimeters to meters—it is the structure of the material as seen with the naked eye.

===Crystallography===
{{Main|Crystallography}}
[[File:Perovskite.jpg|thumb|Crystal structure of a perovskite with a chemical formula ABX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Energetics and Crystal Chemical Systematics among Ilmenite, Lithium Niobate, and Perovskite Structures |author= A. Navrotsky |journal= Chem. Mater. |date= 1998 |volume= 10 |issue= 10 |pages= 2787–2793 |doi= 10.1021/cm9801901}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Crystallography is the science that examines the arrangement of atoms in crystalline solids. Crystallography is a useful tool for materials scientists. In single crystals, the effects of the crystalline arrangement of atoms is often easy to see macroscopically, because the natural shapes of crystals reflect the atomic structure. Further, physical properties are often controlled by crystalline defects. The understanding of crystal structures is an important prerequisite for understanding crystallographic defects. Mostly, materials do not occur as a single crystal, but in polycrystalline form, i.e., as an aggregate of small crystals with different orientations. Because of this, the powder diffraction method, which uses diffraction patterns of polycrystalline samples with a large number of crystals, plays an important role in structural determination.
Most materials have a crystalline structure, but some important materials do not exhibit regular crystal structure. [[Polymer]]s display varying degrees of crystallinity, and many are completely noncrystalline. [[Glass]], some ceramics, and many natural materials are [[Amorphous solid|amorphous]], not possessing any long-range order in their atomic arrangements. The study of polymers combines elements of chemical and statistical thermodynamics to give thermodynamic and mechanical, descriptions of physical properties.

===Bonding===
{{Main|Chemical bonding}}
To obtain a full understanding of the material structure and how it relates to its properties, the materials scientist must study how the different atoms, ions and molecules are arranged and bonded to each other. This involves the study and use of [[quantum chemistry]] or [[quantum physics]]. [[Solid-state physics]], [[solid-state chemistry]] and [[physical chemistry]] are also involved in the study of bonding and structure.

===Properties===
{{Main|List of materials properties}}
Materials exhibit myriad properties, including the following.
:*Mechanical properties, see [[Strength of materials]]
:*Chemical properties, see [[Chemistry]]
:*Electrical properties, see [[Electricity]]
:*Thermal properties, see [[Thermodynamics]]
:*Optical properties, see [[Optics]] and [[Photonics]]
:*Magnetic properties, see [[Magnetism]]
The properties of a material determine its usability and hence its engineering application.

===Synthesis and processing===
Synthesis and processing involves the creation of a material with the desired micro-nanostructure. From an engineering standpoint, a material cannot be used in industry if no economical production method for it has been developed. Thus, the processing of materials is vital to the field of materials science.

Different materials require different processing or synthesis methods. For example, the processing of metals has historically been very important and is studied under the branch of materials science named ''physical [[metallurgy]]''. Also, chemical and physical methods are also used to synthesize other materials such as [[polymer]]s, [[ceramic]]s, [[thin film]]s, etc. As of the early 21st century, new methods are being developed to synthesize nanomaterials such as [[graphene]].

===Thermodynamics===
{{Main|Thermodynamics}}
[[File:Eutektikum new.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|A phase diagram for a binary system displaying a eutectic point.]]
Thermodynamics is concerned with [[heat]] and [[temperature]] and their relation to [[energy]] and [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]]. It defines [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] variables, such as [[internal energy]], [[entropy]], and [[pressure]], that partly describe a body of matter or radiation. It states that the behavior of those variables is subject to general constraints, that are common to all materials, not the peculiar properties of particular materials. These general constraints are expressed in the four laws of thermodynamics.  Thermodynamics describes the bulk behavior of the body, not the microscopic behaviors of the very large numbers of its microscopic constituents, such as molecules. The behavior of these microscopic particles is described by, and the laws of thermodynamics are derived from, [[statistical mechanics]].

The study of thermodynamics is fundamental to materials science. It forms the foundation to treat general phenomena in materials science and engineering, including chemical reactions, magnetism, polarizability, and elasticity. It also helps in the understanding of phase diagrams and phase equilibrium.

===Kinetics===
{{Main|Chemical kinetics}}
[[Chemical kinetics]] is the study of the rates at which systems that are out of equilibrium change under the influence of various forces. When applied to materials science, it deals with how a material changes with time (moves from non-equilibrium to equilibrium state) due to application of a certain field. It details the rate of various processes evolving in materials including shape, size, composition and structure. [[Diffusion]] is important in the study of kinetics as this is the most common mechanism by which materials undergo change.

Kinetics is essential in processing of materials because, among other things, it details how the microstructure changes with application of heat.

==In research==
Materials science has received much attention from researchers. In most universities, many departments ranging from [[physics]] to [[chemistry]] to [[chemical engineering]], along with materials science departments, are involved in materials research. Research in materials science is vibrant and consists of many avenues. The following list is in no way exhaustive. It serves only to highlight certain important research areas.

===Nanomaterials===
{{Main|Nanomaterials}}
[[File:CNTSEM.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|A [[scanning electron microscopy]] image of carbon nanotubes bundles]]
Nanomaterials describe, in principle, materials of which a single unit is sized (in at least one dimension) between 1 and 1000 nanometers (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; meter) but is usually 1—100&amp;nbsp;nm.

Nanomaterials research takes a materials science-based approach to [[nanotechnology]], leveraging advances in materials [[metrology]] and synthesis which have been developed in support of [[microfabrication]] research.  Materials with structure at the nanoscale often have unique optical, electronic, or mechanical properties.

The field of nanomaterials is loosely organized, like the traditional field of chemistry, into organic (carbon-based) nanomaterials such as fullerenes, and inorganic nanomaterials based on other elements, such as silicon. Examples of nanomaterials include [[fullerene]]s, [[carbon nanotube]]s, [[nanocrystal]]s, etc.

===Biomaterials===
{{Main|Biomaterial}}
[[File:NautilusCutawayLogarithmicSpiral.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|The iridescent [[nacre]] inside a [[nautilus]] shell.]]
A biomaterial is any matter, surface, or construct that interacts with biological systems. The study of biomaterials is called ''bio materials science''. It has experienced steady and strong growth over its history, with many companies investing large amounts of money into developing new products. Biomaterials science encompasses elements of [[medicine]], [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[tissue engineering]], and materials science.

Biomaterials can be derived either from nature or synthesized in a laboratory using a variety of chemical approaches using metallic components, [[polymer]]s, [[bioceramic]]s, or [[composite material]]s. They are often used and/or adapted for a medical application, and thus comprises whole or part of a living structure or biomedical device which performs, augments, or replaces a natural function. Such functions may be benign, like being used for a [[heart valve]], or may be [[Biological activity|bioactive]] with a more interactive functionality such as [[hydroxylapatite]] coated [[hip implant]]s. Biomaterials are also used every day in dental applications, surgery, and drug delivery. For example, a construct with impregnated pharmaceutical products can be placed into the body, which permits the prolonged release of a drug over an extended period of time. A biomaterial may also be an [[autograft]], [[allograft]] or [[xenograft]] used as an [[organ transplant]] material.

===Electronic, optical, and magnetic===

Semiconductors, metals, and ceramics are used today to form highly complex systems, such as integrated electronic circuits, optoelectronic devices, and magnetic and optical mass storage media. These materials form the basis of our modern computing world, and hence research into these materials is of vital importance.

[[Semiconductor]]s are a traditional example of these types of materials. They are materials that have properties that are intermediate between [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductors]] and [[insulator (electricity)|insulators]]. Their electrical conductivities are very sensitive to impurity concentrations, and this allows for the use of [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] to achieve desirable electronic properties. Hence, semiconductors form the basis of the traditional computer.

This field also includes new areas of research such as [[superconductivity|superconducting]] materials, [[spintronics]], [[metamaterial]]s, etc. The study of these materials involves knowledge of materials science and [[solid-state physics]] or [[condensed matter physics]].

===Computational science and theory===
With the increase in computing power, simulating the behavior of materials has become possible. This enables materials scientists to discover properties of materials formerly unknown, as well as to design new materials. Up until now, new materials were found by time-consuming trial and error processes. But, now it is hoped that computational methods could drastically reduce that time, and allow tailoring materials properties. This involves simulating materials at all length scales, using methods such as [[density functional theory]], [[molecular dynamics]], etc.

==In industry==
Radical [[Timeline of materials technology|materials advances]] can drive the creation of new products or even new industries, but stable industries also employ materials scientists to make incremental improvements and troubleshoot issues with currently used materials. Industrial applications of materials science include materials design, cost-benefit tradeoffs in industrial production of materials, processing methods ([[casting]], [[rolling]], [[welding]], [[ion implantation]], [[crystal growth]], [[thin-film deposition]], [[sintering]], [[glassblowing]], etc.), and analytic methods (characterization methods such as [[electron microscopy]], [[X-ray crystallography|X-ray diffraction]], [[calorimetry]], [[Microprobe|nuclear microscopy (HEFIB)]], [[Rutherford backscattering]], [[neutron diffraction]], small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), etc.).

Besides material characterization, the material scientist or engineer also deals with extracting materials and converting them into useful forms. Thus ingot casting, foundry methods, blast furnace extraction, and electrolytic extraction are all part of the required knowledge of a materials engineer. Often the presence, absence, or variation of minute quantities of secondary elements and compounds in a bulk material will greatly affect the final properties of the materials produced. For example, steels are classified based on 1/10 and 1/100 weight percentages of the carbon and other alloying elements they contain. Thus, the extracting and purifying methods used to extract iron in a blast furnace can affect the quality of steel that is produced.

===Ceramics and glasses===
{{Main|Ceramic}}
[[File:Si3N4bearings.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ceramic bearing parts]]
Another application of material science is the structures of [[ceramic]]s and [[glass]] typically associated with the most brittle materials. Bonding in ceramics and glasses uses covalent and ionic-covalent types with SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (silica or sand) as a fundamental building block. Ceramics are as soft as clay or as hard as stone and concrete. Usually, they are crystalline in form. Most glasses contain a metal oxide fused with silica. At high temperatures used to prepare glass, the material is a viscous liquid. The structure of glass forms into an amorphous state upon cooling. Windowpanes and eyeglasses are important examples. Fibers of glass are also available. Scratch resistant Corning [[Gorilla Glass]] is a well-known example of the application of materials science to drastically improve the properties of common components. Diamond and carbon in its graphite form are considered to be ceramics.

Engineering ceramics are known for their stiffness and stability under high temperatures, compression and electrical stress. Alumina, [[silicon carbide]], and [[tungsten carbide]] are made from a fine powder of their constituents in a process of sintering with a binder. Hot pressing provides higher density material. Chemical vapor deposition can place a film of a ceramic on another material. Cermets are ceramic particles containing some metals. The wear resistance of tools is derived from cemented carbides with the metal phase of cobalt and nickel typically added to modify properties.

===Composites===
{{Main|Composite material}}
[[File:Cfaser haarrp.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A 6 μm diameter carbon filament (running from bottom left to top right) siting atop the much larger human hair.]] [[Fiber|Filaments]] are commonly used for reinforcement in [[composite material]]s.
Another application of materials science in industry is making [[composite material]]s. These are structured materials composed of two or more macroscopic phases. Applications range from structural elements such as steel-reinforced concrete, to the thermal insulating tiles which play a key and integral role in NASA's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system]] which is used to protect the surface of the shuttle from the heat of re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. One example is [[reinforced Carbon-Carbon]] (RCC), the light gray material which withstands re-entry temperatures up to {{convert|1510|C|F}} and protects the Space Shuttle's wing leading edges and nose cap. RCC is a laminated composite material made from [[graphite]] [[rayon]] cloth and impregnated with a [[phenolic resin]]. After curing at high temperature in an autoclave, the laminate is pyrolized to convert the resin to carbon, impregnated with furfural alcohol in a vacuum chamber, and cured-pyrolized to convert the [[furfural]] alcohol to carbon. To provide oxidation resistance for reuse ability, the outer layers of the RCC are converted to [[silicon carbide]].

Other examples can be seen in the "plastic" casings of television sets, cell-phones and so on. These plastic casings are usually a [[composite material]] made up of a thermoplastic matrix such as [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS) in which [[calcium carbonate]] chalk, [[talc]], [[glass fiber]]s or [[carbon fiber]]s have been added for added strength, bulk, or electrostatic dispersion. These additions may be termed reinforcing fibers, or dispersants, depending on their purpose.

===Polymers===
{{Main|Polymer}}
[[File:Polypropylene.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The repeating unit of the polymer polypropylene]]
[[File:Expanded polystyrene foam dunnage.jpg|thumb|Expanded polystyrene polymer packaging.]]
[[Polymer]]s are chemical compounds made up of a large number of identical components linked together like chains. They are an important part of materials science. Polymers are the raw materials (the resins) used to make what are commonly called plastics and rubber. Plastics and rubber are really the final product, created after one or more polymers or additives have been added to a resin during processing, which is then shaped into a final form. Plastics which have been around, and which are in current widespread use, include [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), [[polystyrene]], [[nylon]]s, [[polyester]]s, [[acrylic resin|acrylics]], [[polyurethane]]s, and [[polycarbonate]]s and also rubbers which have been around are natural rubber, [[styrene-butadiene]] rubber, [[chloroprene]], and [[butadiene rubber]]. Plastics are generally classified as ''commodity'', ''specialty'' and [[engineering plastic|''engineering'' plastics]].

Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is widely used, inexpensive, and annual production quantities are large. It lends itself to a vast array of applications, from [[artificial leather]] to [[electrical insulation]] and cabling, [[packaging]], and [[Food storage|containers]]. Its fabrication and processing are simple and well-established. The versatility of PVC is due to the wide range of [[plasticiser]]s and other additives that it accepts. The term "additives" in polymer science refers to the chemicals and compounds added to the polymer base to modify its material properties.

[[Polycarbonate]] would be normally considered an engineering plastic (other examples include PEEK, ABS). Such plastics are valued for their superior strengths and other special material properties. They are usually not used for disposable applications, unlike commodity plastics.

Specialty plastics are materials with unique characteristics, such as ultra-high strength, electrical conductivity, electro-fluorescence, high thermal stability, etc.

The dividing lines between the various types of plastics is not based on material but rather on their properties and applications. For example, [[polyethylene]] (PE) is a cheap, low friction polymer commonly used to make disposable bags for shopping and trash, and is considered a commodity plastic, whereas [[medium-density polyethylene]] (MDPE) is used for underground gas and water pipes, and another variety called [[ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene]] (UHMWPE) is an engineering plastic which is used extensively as the glide rails for industrial equipment and the low-friction socket in implanted [[hip joint]]s.

===Metal alloys===
{{Main|Alloy}}
[[File:Steel wire rope.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Wire rope made from [[steel]] alloy.]]
The study of metal alloys is a significant part of materials science. Of all the metallic alloys in use today, the alloys of iron ([[steel]], [[stainless steel]], [[cast iron]], [[tool steel]], [[alloy steel]]s) make up the largest proportion both by quantity and commercial value. Iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives low, mid and [[high carbon steel]]s. An iron-carbon alloy is only considered steel if the carbon level is between 0.01% and 2.00%. For the steels, the [[hardness]] and tensile strength of the steel is related to the amount of carbon present, with increasing carbon levels also leading to lower ductility and toughness. Heat treatment processes such as quenching and tempering can significantly change these properties, however. Cast Iron is defined as an iron–carbon alloy with more than 2.00% but less than 6.67% carbon. Stainless steel is defined as a regular steel alloy with greater than 10% by weight alloying content of Chromium. Nickel and Molybdenum are typically also found in stainless steels.

Other significant metallic alloys are those of [[aluminium]], [[titanium]], [[copper]] and [[magnesium]]. [[Copper alloys]] have been known for a long time (since the [[Bronze Age]]), while the alloys of the other three metals have been relatively recently developed. Due to the chemical reactivity of these metals, the electrolytic extraction processes required were only developed relatively recently. The alloys of aluminium, titanium and magnesium are also known and valued for their high strength-to-weight ratios and, in the case of magnesium, their ability to provide electromagnetic shielding. These materials are ideal for situations where high strength-to-weight ratios are more important than bulk cost, such as in the aerospace industry and certain automotive engineering applications.

===Semiconductors===

The study of semiconductors is a significant part of materials science. A [[semiconductor]] is a material that has a resistivity between a metal and insulator. Its electronic properties can be greatly altered through intentionally introducing impurities or doping. From these semiconductor materials, things such as [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s, [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs), and analog and digital [[electric circuit]]s can be built, making them materials of interest in industry. Semiconductor devices have replaced thermionic devices (vacuum tubes) in most applications. Semiconductor devices are manufactured both as single discrete devices and as [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs), which consist of a number—from a few to millions—of devices manufactured and interconnected on a single semiconductor substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aip.org/jobs/profiles/semiconductor-industry-careers |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604150127/https://www.aip.org/jobs/profiles/semiconductor-industry-careers |archivedate=2016-06-04 |df= |date=2013-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all the semiconductors in use today, [[silicon]] makes up the largest portion both by quantity and commercial value. Monocrystalline silicon is used to produce wafers used in the semiconductor and electronics industry. Second to silicon, [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) is the second most popular semiconductor used. Due to its higher electron mobility and saturation velocity compared to silicon, it is a material of choice for high-speed electronics applications. These superior properties are compelling reasons to use GaAs circuitry in mobile phones, satellite communications, microwave point-to-point links and higher frequency radar systems. Other semiconductor materials include [[germanium]], [[silicon carbide]], and [[gallium nitride]] and have various applications.

==Relation to other fields==
Materials science evolved—starting from the 1960s—because it was recognized that to create, discover and design new materials, one had to approach it in a unified manner. Thus, materials science and engineering emerged at the intersection of various fields such as [[metallurgy]], [[solid state physics]], [[chemistry]], [[chemical engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]].

The field is inherently [[interdisciplinary]], and the materials scientists/engineers must be aware and make use of the methods of the physicist, chemist and engineer. The field thus maintains close relationships with these fields. Also, many physicists, chemists and engineers also find themselves working in materials science.

The overlap between physics and materials science has led to the offshoot field of ''materials physics'', which is concerned with the physical properties of materials. The approach is generally more macroscopic and applied than in [[condensed matter physics]]. See [[list of publications in physics#Materials physics|important publications in materials physics]] for more details on this field of study.

The field of materials science and engineering is important both from a scientific perspective, as well as from an engineering one. When discovering new materials, one encounters new phenomena that may not have been observed before. Hence, there is a lot of science to be discovered when working with materials. Materials science also provides a test for theories in condensed matter physics.

Materials are of the utmost importance for engineers, as the usage of the appropriate materials is crucial when designing systems. As a result, materials science is an increasingly important part of an engineer's education.

The '''Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research''' ('''MPIDR''') is located in [[Rostock]], [[Germany]]. It was founded in 1996 and moved into new buildings in Rostock in 2002. It is one of approximately 80 institutes of the [[Max Planck Society]].

The MPIDR is jointly led by founding director [[James Vaupel]] and [[Mikko Myrskylä]], who in 2014 followed [[Joshua R. Goldstein]] who had in 2007 taken the post of retired [[Jan Hoem]].
==History and background==
After the [[Institut national d'études démographiques]], the MPIDR is the largest demographic research body in Europe and one of the largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obets.ua.es/pioneur/bajaarchivo_public.php?iden=46 Tina M. Nebe, Mapping of Competences, ''Pioneur'', July 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211155706/http://www.obets.ua.es/pioneur/bajaarchivo_public.php?iden=46 |date=2009-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conducting basic research into demographic processes, it analyzes the underlying causes of demographic change, describes contemporary demographic trends, produces forecasts for the future direction of demographic processes, highlights the potential consequences facing society, and assists decision-makers in the various political and social institutions by providing them with solid information and expert advice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/general/2.htm Instead of a Preface, MPIDR Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the MPIDR houses eight research laboratories: Evolutionary Biodemography, Survival and Longevity, Economic and Social Demography, Contemporary European Fertility and Family Dynamics, Demographic Data, Statistical Demography, Population and Policy, and Historical Demography.

The institute is participating in four international doctoral training programs: The International Max Planck Research School for Demography,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imprs-demogr.mpg.de/overview.htm International Max Planck Research School for Demography (IMPRSD)]&lt;/ref&gt; the European Doctoral School of Demography ([[EDSD]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://edsd.site.ined.fr/en/overview/ European Doctoral School of Demography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502115453/http://edsd.site.ined.fr/en/overview/ |date=2009-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the MaxNet Aging Research School (MNARS),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maxnetaging.mpg.de/ MaxNet Aging Research School]&lt;/ref&gt; and the PhD program Demography&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiwi.uni-rostock.de/studium/promotion/demographie/ Ph.D program Demographic Change] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420034330/http://www.wiwi.uni-rostock.de/studium/promotion/demographie/ |date=2009-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Rostock University]].

Within the framework of the Rostock Center,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070614041504/http://www.rostockerzentrum.de/home/home.htm Rostock Center]&lt;/ref&gt; a joint initiative between the MPIDR and Rostock University, the institute provides decision-makers in politics and society with information and expert advice on the causes and consequences of demographic change.

Since 2009, the MPIDR hosts [[Population Europe]] - the collaborative network of Europe’s leading demographic [[research institutes]] and centres - whose main activity is to the disseminate policy relevant demographic research findings.

'''Michigan Molecular Institute''' (MMI) ceased operations in 2015 after nearly 45 years of outstanding service in pursuit of applied research in polymer science and technology. 

== History ==
MMI officially opened its doors under the name Midland Macromolecular Institute in the fall of 1972, although the facility had been in operation for the previous year. The building had broken ground in the spring of 1970, and it, like many of Midland's buildings from that era, was designed by local architect [[Alden B. Dow]]. The institute hosted a three-day dedication beginning September 28, 1972 with opening ceremonies that featured more than 400 scientists from throughout the world, chamber music from the Cleveland Quartet, several presentations and public tours.&lt;ref&gt;"Scientific Institute Praised", The Saginaw News, 1972-09-29. Retrieved 2010-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The featured speakers for the ceremonies were Dr. [[Herman Francis Mark]], considered by many to be the father of macromolecular sciences, and Dr. [[Paul J. Flory]], who two years later would be awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry. Two other speakers were prof. dr. Donald Lyman and prof. dr. [[Edgar Andrews]]. Other luminaries on hand included Dr. [[Melvin Calvin]], the 1961 winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry; Dr. [[Charles Overberger]], then the vice-president for research at the University of Michigan; and [[Herbert D. "Ted" Doan]], president of the Michigan Foundation for Advanced Research, which was MMI's primary financial backer in its early days. 

MMI's first director was Dr. H.G. Elias, who came to Midland from the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] in Zurich. Beyond funding from MFAR, early financial supporters of MMI were the Herbert H. &amp; Grace A. Dow Foundation, The Rollin M. Gerstacker Foundation and the Charles J. Strosacker Foundation. In the institute's early days, Elias said MMI would be run much like a university department, although its founders expected MMI would advance macromolecular science knowledge in a way that universities could not.&lt;ref&gt;"Scientific Institute Praised", The Saginaw News, 1972-09-29. Retrieved 2010-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt; One similarity: MMI opened its doors as a not-for-profit organization, which it remains today.

MMI's first 15 years of research of advanced composite materials and polymer technology contributed to Michigan's ability to entice plastics- and composite-related industries to build in the state, and its affiliation with Central Michigan University and Michigan Technological University allowed it to offer master's and doctorate degrees in related research fields.&lt;ref&gt;"Our View", The Midland Daily News, 1990-06-03. Retrieved 2009-09-22.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, MMI began to shift its focus toward creating technology that could be licensed for commercialization. 

Over the years, six men have led the institute as President and/or CEO, including Elias (1972–83); Dr. Robert E. Hefner (1985-85 and 1990–92); Dr. John Hoffman (1985–1990); Dr. James D. Allen (1992–1994); Dr. Robert M. Nowak (1994–2009); and Dr. James H. Plonka (2009–2015).

|}MMI's emphasis from the beginning on the education portion of its mission led to a steady stream of outside experts through the institute, including the visiting professor program, established in 1973 and renamed in 1981 as a living memorial to the late Dr. Turner Alfrey, Jr. Each year, a leading scientist is invited to teach a short course, visit sponsoring organizations and deliver additional research seminars, benefitting many people by providing a point of connection between local scientists and engineers with the world leaders of the polymer science field.&lt;ref&gt;"Carnegie Mellon professor to lecture at MMI in May", The Midland Daily News, 2004-04-18. Retrieved 2010-09-22.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
TAVP speakers from around the world have been invited to present the latest, most up-to-date information in their particular polymer expertise areas.  Typically, these courses were delivered in an intensive, one-week, daily lecture format. Visiting professors also spent additional time at MMI, participating in one-on-one and research group discussions at the Institute, and in collaborations and discussions with other nearby industrial and academic researchers.  They also prepared and delivered a set of on-site seminars for many of the sponsoring organizations that parallel and supplement the formal course lectures.  Financial co-sponsors of the Turner Alfrey Visiting Professor program included [[The Dow Chemical Company]], [[Dow Corning Corporation]], [[Michigan State University]], [[Central Michigan University]], [[Saginaw Valley State University]], the Mid-Michigan Section of the [[Society of Plastics Engineers]], and the Midland Section of the [[American Chemical Society]].

The list of Turner Alfrey Visiting Professors includes several [[Nobel Prize]] winners.

[[Image:Pasquino 02.jpg|thumb|Modern pasquinades in Italian on the base of the statue]]
'''Pasquino''' or '''Pasquin''' ([[Latin]]: ''Pasquillus'') is the name used by [[Rome|Romans]] since the [[early modern period]] to describe a battered [[Hellenistic]]-style statue dating to the third century BC, which was unearthed in the [[Parione]] district of [[Rome]] in the fifteenth century. It is located in a piazza of the same name on the southwest corner of the [[Palazzo Braschi]] (Museo di Roma); near the site where it was unearthed.  The statue is known as the first of the [[talking statues of Rome]], because of the tradition of attaching anonymous criticisms to its base.

==History==
[[File:1-pasquino.jpg|thumb|Pasquino statue 2017. Postering on the statue is prohibited.  "Pasquinades" must be placed on a side board.]]
The statue's fame dates to the early sixteenth century, when Cardinal [[Oliviero Carafa]] draped the [[marble]] torso of the statue in a toga and decorated it with Latin [[epigram]]s on the occasion of [[Saint Mark]]'s Day.

The Cardinal's actions led to a custom of criticizing the pope or his government by the writing of [[Satire|satirical poems]] in broad [[Romanesco dialect|Roman dialect]]—called "pasquinades" from the Italian "pasquinate"—and attaching them to the statue "Pasquino".

Thus Pasquino became the first "talking statue" of Rome. He spoke out about the people's dissatisfaction, denounced injustice, and assaulted misgovernment by members of the Church. From this tradition are derived the English-language terms '''pasquinade''' and '''pasquil''', which refer to an anonymous [[parody|lampoon]] in verse or prose.&lt;ref&gt;In verse, the pasquinade finds a classical source in the [[epigram]]s of [[Martial]]: John W. Spaeth, Jr., "Martial and the Pasquinade" ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' '''70''' (1939:242-255).&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual subject of the sculpture is ''[[Menelaus supporting the body of Patroclus]]'', and the subject, or the composition applied to other figures as in the [[Sperlonga sculptures]], occurs a number of times in classical sculpture, where it is now known as a "[[Pasquino group]]".  The actual identification of the sculptural subject was made in the eighteenth century by the [[antiquarian]] [[Ennio Quirino Visconti]], who identified it as the torso of [[Menelaus]] supporting the dying [[Patroclus]]; the more famous of two Medici versions of this is in the [[Loggia dei Lanzi]] in [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], Italy.  The ''Pasquino'' is more recently characterized as a [[Hellenistic]] sculpture of the third century BC, or a Roman copy.&lt;ref&gt;Early discussion was summarised in B. Schweitzer and F. Hackenbeil, ''Das Original der sogennanten Pasquino-Gruppe'' (Leipzig: Hirtzl) 1936; the modern opinion is from [[Wolfgang Helbig]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymological origins==
[[File:Statue of Pasquin in the House of Cardinal Ursino MET DP870228.jpg|thumb|Pasquino in 1550 by [[Nicolas Béatrizet]]]]
The origin of the name, "Pasquino", remains obscure. By the mid-sixteenth century it was reported that the name "Pasquino" derived from a nearby tailor who was renowned for his wit and intellect;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Cq5PAAAAMAAJ Origin of Pasquino.]&lt;/ref&gt; speculation had it that his legacy was carried on through the statue, in "the honor and everlasting remembrance of the poor tailor".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Cq5PAAAAMAAJ Origin of Pasquino.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tradition of wit==
Before long, other statues appeared on the scene, forming a kind of public [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] or academy, the  "Congress of the Wits" (''Congresso degli Arguti''), with Pasquino always the leader, and the sculptures that Romans called [[Marphurius]], [[Abbot Luigi]], [[Il Facchino]], [[Madama Lucrezia]], and [[Il Babbuino]] as his outspoken colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Ponti 1927; ''Enciclopedia Italiana'', ''s.v.'' "Pasquino e Pasquinate".&lt;/ref&gt; The ''cartelli'' (translated as posters, placards, boards; probably the equivalent of pamphlet) on which the epigrams were written were quickly passed around, and copies were made, too numerous to suppress.&lt;ref&gt;Copies in private daybooks have preserved some that were too scurrilous to print.&lt;/ref&gt; These poems were collected and published annually by the Roman printer [[Giacomo Mazzocchi]] as early as 1509, as ''Carmina apposita Pasquino'', and became well known all over [[Europe]]. As they became more pointed, the place of publication of ''Pasquillorum Tomi Duo'' (1544) was shifted to [[Basel]],&lt;ref&gt;("Two volumes of Pasquinades"). ''Pasquillorum Tomi Duo. Quorum primo uersibus ac rhythmis, altero soluta oratione conscripta quamplurima continentur, ad exhilarandum, confirmandumque hoc perturbatissimo rerum statu pij lectoris animum'' (Johann Oporino, Eleutheropoli (sc. Basel) 1544) ([https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mtJNAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=contents#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false digitized])&lt;/ref&gt; less squarely under papal control, disguised on the titlepage as ''Eleutheropolis'', "freedom city".&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth 1939:245, identifies the editor as the humanist-turned-Protestant [[Caelius Secundus Curio]], an exile and professor of oratory at Basel, whose satirical dialogue ''Pasquillus Extaticus et [[Marforio|Marphorius]]'' appeared for the first time (in Latin) in this work (Part 2, pp. 426-529) and rapidly gained an independent life in translations into Italian, French, German, Dutch and, a little later, English.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Parody|lampoon]]ing tradition was ancient among Romans. For a first-century versified lampoon, see [[Domus Aurea]].

''Pasquinade'' is sometimes misidentified, appearing among synonyms of ''[[parody]]'' at [[WordNet]]. Compare also the equally unrelated ''[[pastiche]]''.

==Cultural legacy==
In 1589 one of the contributors to the [[Marprelate Controversy]], a pamphlet war between the [[Established Church]] of England and its [[puritan]] opponents, adopted the pseudonym [[Pasquill (the Cavaliero)|Pasquill]]. At the end of his second pamphlet ''The Return of Pasquill'' (published in October 1589), Pasquill invites critics of his opponent [[Martin Marprelate]] to write out their complaints and post them up on [[London Stone]].

''Pasquin'' is the name of a play by [[Henry Fielding]] from 1736. It was a ''pasquinade'' in that it was an explicit and personalized attack on [[Robert Walpole]] and his supporters. It is one of the plays that triggered the [[Licensing Act of 1737|Theatrical Licensing Act of 1737]].

''The Pasquinade'' is a small, grassroots [[magazine]] of [[parody]] and [[satire]] started in the mid-1990s by Dallas Shelby, a college journalism student with a bent for satire and a love of [[popular culture|pop culture]]. In 2003, the organization developed its own film production company, Pasquinade Films.

''Anthony Pasquin'' is the pseudonym of [[John Williams (satirist)|John Williams]] (1761–1818) and his satirical writing of royalties, academicians, and actors.

''Pasquino'' was a pen name of [[J. Fairfax McLaughlin]] (1939–1903), American lawyer and author.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pseudonyms|author=Joseph F. Clarke|publisher=BCA|date=1977|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] term ''[[Pashkevil]]'' is the generic name of the posters put up on the walls of [[Ultra-Orthodox Jews]]ish enclaves in [[Israel]]. These posters define legitimate behavior, such as prohibitions on owning [[smart phones]], as well as often being the mouthpiece for radical anti-Zionist groups, such as the ''[[Neturei Karta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brother Against Brother: Violence and Extremism in Israeli Politics, E. Sprinzak, 1999, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pashkevillim'' take the place of conventional media in communities where they are shunned.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2377">'''Predictive informatics (PI)''' is the combination of [[predictive modeling]] and [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] applied to healthcare, pharmaceutical, life sciences and business industries.

Predictive informatics enables researchers, analysts, physicians and decision-makers to aggregate and analyze disparate types of data, recognize patterns and trends within that data, and make more informed decisions in an effort to preemptively alter future outcomes.

==Current uses of PI==
===Healthcare===
Over the past decade the increased usage of [[electronic health records]] has produced vast amounts of clinical data that is now computable. Predictive informatics integrates this data with other datasets (e.g., genotypic, phenotypic) in centralized and standardized data repositories upon which predictive analytics may be conducted.

===Pharmaceuticals===
The [[biopharmaceutical]] industry uses predictive informatics (a superset of [[chemoinformatics]]) to integrate information resources to transform data into knowledge in order to make better decisions faster in the area of drug lead identification and optimization.

===Systems biology===
Scientists involved in [[systems biology]] employ predictive informatics to integrate complex data about the interactions in biological systems from diverse experimental sources.

===Other uses===
Predictive informatics and analytics are also used in financial services, insurance, telecommunications, retail, and travel industries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4745">A '''process flow diagram''' ('''PFD''') is a diagram commonly used in [[chemical engineering|chemical]] and [[process engineering]] to indicate the general flow of plant processes and equipment. The PFD displays the relationship between ''major'' equipment of a plant facility and does not show minor details such as piping details and designations. Another commonly used term for a PFD is a ''flowsheet''.

==Typical content of a process flow diagram==
[[File:pfd-symbols.png|thumb|right|350px|Some typical elements from process flow diagrams, as provided by the [[Open-source software|open source]] program, [[Dia (software)|Dia]]. Click for image legend.]]

Typically, process flow diagrams of a single [[unit process]] will include the following:
* Process [[piping]]
* Major equipment items
* [[Control valves]] and other major [[valves]]
* Connections with other systems
* Major bypass and recirculation (recycle) streams
* Operational data ([[temperature]], [[pressure]], [[mass flow rate]], [[density]], etc.), often by stream references to a [[mass balance]].
* Process stream names

Process flow diagrams generally do not include:
* [[Pipe class]]es  or piping line numbers
* [[Process control]] instrumentation (sensors and final elements)
* Minor bypass lines
* Isolation and shutoff valves
* Maintenance vents and drains
* [[Relief valve|Relief]] and [[safety valve]]s
* [[Flange]]s

Process flow diagrams of multiple process units within a large industrial plant will usually contain less detail and may be called ''block flow diagrams'' or ''schematic flow diagrams''.

==Process flow diagram examples==

The process flow diagram below depicts a single chemical engineering unit process known as an [[Amine treating|amine treating plant]]:
[[File:AmineTreating.png|frame|center|Flow diagram of a typical amine treating process used in industrial plants]]

=== Multiple process units within an industrial plant ===
The process flow diagram below is an example of a schematic or block flow diagram and depicts the various unit processes within a typical [[oil refinery]]:

[[File:RefineryFlow.png|center|frame|A typical oil refinery-SL]]

==Other items of interest==
A PFD can be computer generated from process simulators (see [[List of Chemical Process Simulators]]), CAD packages, or flow chart software using a library of chemical engineering symbols. Rules and symbols are available from standardization organizations such as [[DIN]], [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] or [[ANSI]].  Often PFDs are produced on large sheets of paper.

PFDs of many commercial processes can be found in the literature, specifically in encyclopedias of chemical technology, although some might be outdated. To find recent ones, patent databases such as those available from the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] can be useful.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6412">The '''quadrivium''' (plural: quadrivia&lt;ref name="JE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14950-wisdom |title=Wisdom |last=Kohler |first=Kaufmann |work=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=2015-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the four subjects, or arts, taught after teaching the [[trivium (education)|trivium]]. The word is [[Latin]], meaning ''four ways'', and its use for the four subjects has been attributed to [[Boethius]] or [[Cassiodorus]] in the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Part I: The Age of Augustine". ND.edu. 2010. [http://maritain.nd.edu/jmc/etext/hwp205.htm ND205].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Quadrivium (education)". ''[[Britannica Online]]''. 2011. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/485943/quadrivium EB].
&lt;/ref&gt; Together, the [[trivium]] and the quadrivium comprised the seven [[liberal arts]] (based on thinking skills),&lt;ref name="nie"&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Quadrivium|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; as distinguished from the practical arts (such as [[medicine]] and [[architecture]]).

The quadrivium consisted of [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], [[music]], and [[astronomy]]. These followed the preparatory work of the trivium, consisting of [[grammar]], [[logic]], and [[rhetoric]]. In turn, the quadrivium was considered preparatory work for the study of [[philosophy]] (sometimes called the "liberal art ''par excellence''")&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Coit Gilman|Gilman, Daniel Coit]], et al. (1905). ''[[New International Encyclopedia]]''. Lemma "Arts, Liberal".&lt;/ref&gt; and [[theology]].

==Origins==
These four studies compose the secondary part of the curriculum outlined by [[Plato]] in [[The Republic (Plato)|''The Republic'']] and are described in the seventh book of that work (in the order Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy, Music). &lt;ref name="nie"/&gt;
The quadrivium is implicit in early [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] writings and in the ''De nuptiis'' of [[Martianus Capella]], although the term ''quadrivium'' was not used until [[Boethius]], early in the sixth century.&lt;ref&gt;Marrou, Henri-Irénée (1969). "Les Arts Libéraux dans l'Antiquité Classique". pp. 6–27 in ''Arts Libéraux et Philosophie au Moyen Âge''. Paris: Vrin; Montréal: Institut d'Études Médiévales. pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[Proclus]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Pythagoreans considered all mathematical science to be divided into four parts: one half they marked off as concerned with quantity, the other half with magnitude; and each of these they posited as twofold.  A quantity can be considered in regard to its character by itself or in its relation to another quantity, magnitudes as either stationary or in motion.  Arithmetic, then, studies quantities as such, music the relations between quantities, geometry magnitude at rest, spherics [astronomy] magnitude inherently moving.&lt;ref&gt;Proclus. ''A Commentary on the First Book of Euclid's Elements'', xii. trans. Glenn Raymond Morrow. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992. pp. 29–30. {{ISBN|0-691-02090-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Medieval usage==
At many medieval universities, this would have been the course leading to the degree of [[Master of Arts]] (after the [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]). After the MA, the student could enter for bachelor's degrees of the higher faculties (Theology, Medicine or Law). To this day, some of the postgraduate degree courses lead to the degree of Bachelor (the [[Bachelor of Philosophy|B.Phil]] and [[British degree abbreviations|B.Litt.]] degrees are examples in the field of philosophy).

The study was eclectic, approaching the philosophical objectives sought by considering it from each aspect of the quadrivium within the general structure demonstrated by [[Proclus]] (AD 412–485), namely arithmetic and music on the one hand&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Craig (2001). ''The Maze and the Warrior: Symbols in Architecture, Theology, and Music''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and geometry and cosmology on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Smoller, Laura Ackerman (1994). ''History, Prophecy and the Stars: Christian Astrology of Pierre D'Ailly, 1350–1420. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of music within the quadrivium was originally the classical subject of [[harmonic]]s, in particular the study of the proportions between the musical intervals created by the division of a [[monochord]]. A relationship to music as actually practised was not part of this study, but the framework of classical harmonics would substantially influence the content and structure of music theory as practised in both European and Islamic cultures.

==Modern usage==
In modern applications of the liberal arts as curriculum in colleges or universities, the quadrivium may be considered to be the study of [[number]] and its relationship to space or time: arithmetic was pure number, geometry was number in [[space]], music was number in [[time]], and astronomy was number in [[spacetime|space and time]]. [[Morris Kline]] classified the four elements of the quadrivium as pure (arithmetic), stationary (geometry), moving (astronomy), and applied (music) number.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, Morris (1953).

This schema is sometimes referred to as "classical education", but it is more accurately a [[Renaissance of the 12th century|development of the 12th- and 13th-century Renaissance]] with recovered classical elements, rather than an organic growth from the educational systems of antiquity.

[[File:Gati or existences.jpg|right|thumb|In [[Jainism]], a [[soul]] travels to any one of the four states of existence after death depending on its [[karma]]s.]]

'''Reincarnation''' is the [[Philosophy|philosophical]]  or [[Religion|religious]] concept that an aspect of a living [[being]] starts a new [[life]] in a different [[physical body]] or form after each biological [[death]]. It is also called rebirth or transmigration, and is a part of the [[Saṃsāra]] doctrine of cyclic existence.{{Sfn|Norman C.

==Conceptual definitions==
The word "reincarnation" derives from [[Latin]], literally meaning, "entering the flesh again". The Greek equivalent ''[[metempsychosis]]'' (μετεμψύχωσις) derives from ''meta'' (change) and ''empsykhoun'' (to put a soul into),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=metempsychosis metempsychosis], Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; a term attributed to [[Pythagoras]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Huffman (2014), [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pythagoras/ Pythagoras, 4.1 The Fate of the Soul—Metempsychosis] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Stanford University&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate term is transmigration implying migration from one life (body) to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transmigration|author=Oxford Dictionaries|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/transmigrate|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reincarnation refers to the belief that an aspect of every human being (or all living beings in some cultures) continues to exist after death, this aspect may be the soul or mind or consciousness or something transcendent which is reborn in an interconnected cycle of existence; the transmigration belief varies by culture, and is envisioned to be in the form of a newly born human being, or animal, or plant, or spirit, or as a being in some other non-human realm of existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/reincarnation |title=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Concise.britannica.com |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Keown|2013|pp=35–40}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Key Chapple|title=Jainism and Ecology: Nonviolence in the Web of Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abLZNdYxay8C |year=2006|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2045-6 |pages=39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been used by modern philosophers such as [[Kurt Gödel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karl Sigmund |url=http://www.goedelexhibition.at/goedel/goedel.html |title=Gödel Exhibition: Gödel's Century |publisher=Goedelexhibition.at |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has entered the English language. Another Greek term sometimes used synonymously is ''[[palingenesis]]'', "being born again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hinduism.iskcon.com/concepts/102.htm |title=Heart of Hinduism: Reincarnation and Samsara |publisher=Hinduism.iskcon.com |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419232238/http://hinduism.iskcon.com/concepts/102.htm |archivedate=2011-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebirth is a key concept found in major Indian religions, and discussed with various terms.

Laumakis|2008|pp=90–99}} The reincarnation concept is considered in Indian religions as a step that starts each "cycle of aimless drifting, wandering or mundane existence",{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271–272}} but one that is an opportunity to seek spiritual liberation through ethical living and a variety of meditative, yogic (''marga''), or other spiritual practices.{{Sfn|John Bowker|2014|pp=84–85}}&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Flood (2010), Brill's Encyclopedia of Hinduism (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Volume II, Brill, {{ISBN|978-90-04-17893-9}}, pages 881–884&lt;/ref&gt; They consider the release from the cycle of reincarnations as the ultimate spiritual goal, and call the liberation by terms such as [[moksha]], [[nirvana]], ''mukti'' and ''kaivalya''.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Klostermaier, Mokṣa and Critical Theory, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Jan., 1985), pages 61–71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman E.

''Gilgul'', ''Gilgul neshamot'' or ''Gilgulei Ha Neshamot'' ([[Hebrew language|Heb.]] גלגול הנשמות) is the concept of reincarnation in [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] [[Judaism]], found in much [[Yiddish literature]] among [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. ''Gilgul'' means "cycle" and ''neshamot'' is "souls". Kabbalistic reincarnation says that humans reincarnate only to humans and to the same sex only: men to men, women to women.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==History==

===Origins===

The origins of the notion of reincarnation are obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Theosophical Society in America|title=Reincarnation: The Hope of the World|page=15|author=Irving Steiger Cooper|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussion of the subject appears in the philosophical traditions of India. The Greek [[Pre-Socratics]] discussed reincarnation, and the Celtic [[Druids]] are also reported to have taught a doctrine of reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]] thought the Druids might have been influenced by the teachings of [[Pythagoras]]. Diodorus Siculus v.28.6; Hippolytus ''Philosophumena'' i.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas associated with reincarnation may have arisen independently in different regions, or they might have spread as a result of cultural contact. Proponents of cultural transmission have looked for links between Iron Age Celtic, Greek and Vedic philosophy and religion,&lt;ref&gt;one modern scholar has speculated that Buddhist missionaries had been sent to Britain by the Indian king [[Ashoka]]. Donald A.Mackenzie, ''Buddhism in pre-Christian Britain'' (1928:21).&lt;/ref&gt; some{{who|date=October 2010}} even suggesting that belief in reincarnation was present in [[Proto-Indo-European religion]].{{dubious|date=October 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;M. Dillon and N. Chadwick, ''The Celtic Realms'', Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, London, {{Page needed|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient European, Iranian and Indian agricultural cultures, the life cycles of birth, death, and rebirth were recognized as a replica of natural [[agricultural cycle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ara, Mitra (2008). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NQ12k9delf4C Eschatology in the Indo-Iranian traditions: The Genesis and Transformation of a Doctrine]''. Peter Lang Publishing Inc., New York, USA. {{ISBN|1-4331-0250-1}}. pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism===

The idea of reincarnation has early roots in the [[Vedic period]] (c. 1500 – c. 500 BCE), predating the [[Buddha]] and the [[Mahavira]].&lt;ref name=damienkeown32&gt;{{cite book|author=Damien Keown |title=Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QXX0Uq29aoC |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-966383-5 |pages=28, 32–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts of the cycle of birth and death, [[samsara]], and liberation partly derive from ascetic traditions that arose in India around the middle of the first millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin. Olivelle, Patrick. 2003. ''The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism.'' Malden: Blackwell. pg. 273-4. "The second half of the first millennium BCE was the period that created many of the ideological and institutional elements that characterize later Indian religions. The renouncer tradition played a central role during this formative period of Indian religious history....Some of the fundamental values and beliefs that we generally associate with Indian religions in general and Hinduism in particular were in part the creation of the renouncer tradition. These include the two pillars of Indian theologies: samsara – the belief that life in this world is one of suffering and subject to repeated deaths and births (rebirth); moksa/nirvana – the goal of human existence....."&lt;/ref&gt; Though no direct evidence of this has been found, the tribes of the [[Ganges]] valley or the [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] traditions of [[South India]] have been proposed as another early source of reincarnation beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin D. Flood, ''An Introduction to Hinduism'', Cambridge University Press (1996), UK {{ISBN|0-521-43878-0}}  p. 86 – "A third alternative is that the origin of transmigration theory lies outside of vedic or sramana traditions in the tribal religions of the Ganges valley, or even in Dravidian traditions of south India."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hinduism]]'s [[Rigveda]] makes references to reincarnation in the [[Brahmana]]s layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Doctrine of Karma | publisher=Motilal Barnasidass | author=Krishnan, Yuvraj | year=1997 | location=Delhi, IN | pages=13 | isbn=81-208-1233-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan |pages=147–148 |year = 1926 |url= https://archive.org/stream/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926#page/n181/mode/2up |quote= '''Quote:''' There we definitely know that the whole hymn is address to a departed spirit, and the poet [of the Rigvedic hymn] says that he is going to recall the departed soul in order that it may return again and live."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Atsushi Hayakawa |title=Circulation of Fire in the Veda |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w7LtAgAAQBAJ |year=2014| publisher=LIT Verlag Münster| isbn=978-3-643-90472-0| pages=66–67, 101–103 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though these early textual layers of the Vedas, from 2nd millennium BCE, mention and anticipate the doctrine of [[Karma]] and rebirth, the idea is not fully developed.{{sfn|Stephen J.

The [[Buddhist texts#Texts of the Early schools|early Buddhist texts]] discuss rebirth as part of the doctrine of ''[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|Saṃsāra]]''.

====Rationale====
The earliest layers of Vedic text incorporate the concept of life, followed by an [[afterlife]] in heaven and hell based on cumulative virtues (merit) or vices (demerit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[James Hastings]]|author2=John Alexander Selbie|author3=[[Louis Herbert Gray]]|series=[[Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics]]|title=Volume 12: Suffering-Zwingli|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.500005|year=1922|publisher=T. &amp; T. Clark|pages=616–618}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ancient Vedic [[Rishi]]s challenged this idea of afterlife as simplistic, because people do not live an equally moral or immoral life. Between generally virtuous lives, some are more virtuous; while evil too has degrees, and the texts assert that it would be unfair for people, with varying degrees of virtue or vices, to end up in heaven or hell, in "either or" and disproportionate manner irrespective of how virtuous or vicious their lives were.{{Sfn|Jessica Frazier|Gavin Flood|2011|pp=84–86}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kusum P.

===Early Greece===
[[Image:2161 - Taormina - Badia Vecchia - Sarcofago romano del sec. II d.C. - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 20-May-2008.jpg|thumb|A 2nd-century Roman sarcophagus shows the mythology and symbolism of the Orphic and Dionysiac Mystery schools. Orpheus plays his lyre to the left.]]
Early Greek discussion of the concept likewise dates to the 6th century BCE. An early Greek thinker known to have considered rebirth is [[Pherecydes of Syros]] (fl. 540 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Schibli, S., Hermann, Pherekydes of Syros, p. 104, Oxford Univ. Press 2001&lt;/ref&gt; His younger contemporary Pythagoras (c. 570–c. 495 BCE&lt;ref&gt;"The dates of his life cannot be fixed exactly, but assuming the approximate correctness of the statement of Aristoxenus (ap. Porph. ''V.P.'' 9) that he left Samos to escape the tyranny of Polycrates at the age of forty, we may put his birth round about 570 BCE, or a few years earlier. The length of his life was variously estimated in antiquity, but it is agreed that he lived to a fairly ripe old age, and most probably he died at about seventy-five or eighty." [[William Keith Chambers Guthrie]], (1978), ''A history of Greek philosophy, Volume 1: The earlier Presocratics and the Pythagoreans'', page 173. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;), its first famous exponent, instituted societies for its diffusion. [[Plato]] (428/427–348/347 BCE) presented accounts of reincarnation in his works, particularly the ''[[Myth of Er]]''.

Authorities have not agreed on how the notion arose in Greece: sometimes Pythagoras is said to have been Pherecydes' pupil, sometimes to have introduced it with the doctrine of [[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]], a [[Thrace|Thracian]] religion that was to be important in the diffusion of reincarnation, or else to have brought the teaching from India. In  ''[[Phaedo]]'', Plato makes his teacher [[Socrates]], prior to his death, state: "I am confident that there truly is such a thing as living again, and that the living spring from the dead." However [[Xenophon]] does not mention Socrates as believing in reincarnation and Plato may have systematised Socrates' thought with concepts he took directly from Pythagoreanism or Orphism.

===Classical Antiquity===

{{see also|metempsychosis}}

The [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic religion]], which taught reincarnation, about the 6th century BC, organized itself into [[mystery schools]] at [[Eleusis]] and elsewhere, and produced a copious literature.&lt;ref&gt;Linforth, Ivan M. (1941) ''The Arts of Orpheus'' Arno Press, New York, {{OCLC|514515}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, Herbert S. (1948) ''A Study of the doctrine of metempsychosis in Greece, from Pythagoras to Plato'' (Long's 1942 Ph.D. dissertation) Princeton, New Jersey, {{OCLC|1472399}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, Herbert S. (16 February 1948) "Plato's Doctrine of Metempsychosis and Its Source" ''The Classical Weekly'' 41(10): pp. 149—155&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orpheus]], its legendary founder, is said to have taught that the immortal soul aspires to freedom while the body holds it prisoner. The wheel of birth revolves, the soul alternates between freedom and captivity round the wide circle of necessity. Orpheus proclaimed the need of the grace of the gods, [[Dionysus]] in particular, and of self-purification until the soul has completed the spiral ascent of destiny to live for ever.

An association between [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean philosophy]] and reincarnation was routinely accepted throughout antiquity. In the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' Plato makes Socrates tell how Er, the son of Armenius, miraculously returned to life on the twelfth day after death and recounted the secrets of the other world. There are myths and theories to the same effect in other dialogues, in the [[Chariot allegory]] of the [[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]], in the [[Meno]], [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]] and [[Laws]]. The soul, once separated from the body, spends an indeterminate amount of time in "formland" (see The [[Allegory of the Cave]] in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'') and then assumes another body.

In later Greek literature the doctrine is mentioned in a fragment of [[Menander]]&lt;ref&gt;Menander, ''The Inspired Woman''&lt;/ref&gt; and satirized by [[Lucian]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Gallus'', 18 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] literature it is found as early as [[Ennius]],&lt;ref&gt;Poesch, Jessie (1962) "Ennius and Basinio of Parma" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' 25(1/2): pp. 116—118, page 117, FN15&lt;/ref&gt; who, in a lost passage of his ''Annals'', told how he had seen [[Homer]] in a dream, who had assured him that the same soul which had animated both the poets had once belonged to a peacock. [[Persius]] in his satires (vi. 9) laughs at this, it is referred to also by [[Lucretius]]&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius, (i. 124)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Horace]].&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''Epistles'', II. i. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Virgil]] works the idea into his account of the Underworld in the sixth book of the [[Aeneid]].&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''The Aeneid'', vv. 724 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; It persists down to the late classic thinkers, [[Plotinus]] and the other [[Neoplatonist]]s. In the [[Hermetica]], a Graeco-Egyptian series of writings on cosmology and spirituality attributed to [[Hermes Trismegistus]]/[[Thoth]], the doctrine of reincarnation is central.

In [[Hellenistic philosophy|Greco-Roman thought]], the concept of metempsychosis disappeared with the rise of [[Early Christianity]], reincarnation being incompatible with the Christian core doctrine of [[salvation]] of the faithful after death. It has been suggested that some of the early Church Fathers, especially [[Origen]], still entertained a belief in the possibility of reincarnation, but evidence is tenuous, and the writings of Origen as they have come down to us speak explicitly against it.&lt;ref&gt;The book ''Reincarnation in Christianity'', by the [[theosophist]] Geddes MacGregor (1978) asserted that Origen believed in reincarnation.  MacGregor is convinced that Origen believed in and taught about reincarnation but that his texts written about the subject have been destroyed. He admits that there is no extant proof for that position. The allegation was also repeated by [[Shirley MacLaine]] in her book ''Out On a Limb''.
Origen does discuss  the concept of transmigration (''metensomatosis'') from Greek philosophy, but it is repeatedly stated that this concept is not a part of the Christian teaching or scripture in his Comment on the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (which survives only in a 6th-century Latin translatio): "In this place [when Jesus said Elijah was come and referred to John the Baptist] it does not appear to me that by Elijah the soul is spoken of, lest I fall into the doctrine of [[Transmigration of the soul|transmigration]], which is foreign to the Church of God, and not handed down by the apostles, nor anywhere set forth in the scriptures" (13:1:46–53, see [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IX/Origen on Matthew/Origen's Commentary on Matthew/Book XIII|Commentary on Matthew, Book XIII]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early Christian [[Gnostic]] sects professed reincarnation. The [[Sethians]] and followers of [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] believed in it.&lt;ref&gt;Much of this is documented in R.E. Slater's book ''Paradise Reconsidered.''&lt;/ref&gt; The followers of [[Bardaisan]] of [[Mesopotamia]], a sect of the 2nd century deemed heretical by the Catholic Church, drew upon [[Babylon|Chaldean]] [[astrology]], to which Bardaisan's son Harmonius, educated in Athens, added Greek ideas including a sort of metempsychosis. Another such teacher was [[Basilides]] (132–? CE/AD), known to us through the criticisms of [[Irenaeus]] and the work of [[Clement of Alexandria]] (see also [[Neoplatonism and Gnosticism]] and [[Buddhism and Gnosticism]]).

In the third Christian century [[Manichaeism]] spread both east and west from [[Babylonia]], then within the [[Sassanid Empire]], where its founder [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] lived about 216–276. Manichaean monasteries existed in Rome in 312 AD. Noting Mani's early travels to the [[Kushan Empire]] and other Buddhist influences in Manichaeism, [[Richard Foltz]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Foltz]], ''Religions of the Silk Road'', New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; attributes Mani's teaching of reincarnation to Buddhist influence. However the inter-relation of Manicheanism, Orphism, Gnosticism and neo-Platonism is far from clear.

===Celtic paganism===
In the 1st century BCE [[Alexander Cornelius Polyhistor]] wrote:

{{bquote|The Pythagorean doctrine prevails among the Gauls' teaching that the souls of men are immortal, and that after a fixed number of years they will enter into another body.}}

[[Julius Caesar]] recorded that the [[druids]] of Gaul, Britain and Ireland had metempsychosis as one of their core doctrines:&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, "De Bello Gallico", VI&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bquote|The principal point of their doctrine is that the soul does not die and that after death it passes from one body into another... the main object of all education is, in their opinion, to imbue their scholars with a firm belief in the indestructibility of the human soul, which, according to their belief, merely passes at death from one tenement to another; for by such doctrine alone, they say, which robs death of all its terrors, can the highest form of human courage be developed.}}

===Germanic paganism===
{{Main|Rebirth in Germanic paganism}}
[[Image:Ed0027.jpg|right|thumb|[[Sváfa]] holding the dying [[Helgi Hjörvarðsson|Helgi]] in their first incarnation of three, as depicted in an illustration published in 1893]]
Surviving North Germanic texts make several references to beliefs in reincarnation. The ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana II]]'' states that belief in reincarnation was once widespread, but was at the time of the composition restricted to folk belief. In addition, scholars have identified a variety of references to reincarnation among the Germanic peoples outside the North Germanic sphere.

===Judaism===
The belief in reincarnation had first existed amongst Jewish mystics in the Ancient World, among whom differing explanations were given of the after-life, although with a universal belief in an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;''Essential Judaism: A Complete Guide to Beliefs, Customs &amp; Rituals'', By George Robinson, Simon and Schuster 2008, page 193&lt;/ref&gt; Today, reincarnation is an [[esoteric]] belief within many streams of modern Judaism.  Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism), teaches a belief in [[gilgul]], transmigration of souls, and hence the belief in reincarnation is universal in [[Hasidic Judaism]], which regards the Kabbalah as sacred and authoritative, and is also held as an esoteric belief within [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]]. In [[Judaism]], the [[Zohar]], first published in the 13th century, discusses reincarnation at length, especially in the [[Torah]] portion "Balak." The most comprehensive [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] work on reincarnation, ''[[Shaar HaGilgulim]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Mind in the Balance: Meditation in Science, Buddhism, and Christianity", p. 104, by  B. Alan Wallace&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Between Worlds: Dybbuks, Exorcists, and Early Modern Judaism", p. 190, by J. H. Chajes&lt;/ref&gt; was written by [[Hayyim ben Joseph Vital|Chaim Vital]], based on the teachings of his mentor, the 16th century kabbalist [[Isaac Luria]], who was said to know the past lives of each person through his [[Ruach HaKodesh|semi-prophetic]] abilities. The 18th century Lithuanian master scholar and kabbalist, Rabbi Elijah, known as the [[Vilna Gaon]] (Elijah of Vilna), authored a commentary on the biblical [[Book of Jonah]] as an allegory of reincarnation.

The practice of conversion to Judaism is sometimes understood within Orthodox Judaism in terms of reincarnation. According to this school of thought in Judaism, when non-Jews are drawn to Judaism, it is because they had been Jews in a former life. Such souls may "wander among nations" through multiple lives, until they find their way back to Judaism, including through finding themselves born in a gentile family with a "lost" Jewish ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Tales of Reincarnation', By Yonasson Gershom, Yonasson Gershom, Jason Aronson, Incorporated, 31 Jan 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Taoist]] documents from as early as the [[Han Dynasty]] claimed that [[Lao Tzu]] appeared on earth as different persons in different times beginning in the legendary era of [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors]]. The (ca. 3rd century BC) ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Chuang Tzu]]'' states: "Birth is not a beginning; death is not an end. There is existence without limitation; there is continuity without a starting-point. Existence without limitation is Space. Continuity without a starting point is Time. There is birth, there is death, there is issuing forth, there is entering in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vMNI-aFtF4UC&amp;dq|title=Chuang Tzŭ: Mystic, Moralist, and Social Reformer (translated by Herbert Allen Giles)|year= 1889|page= 304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Middle Ages===
Around the 11–12th century in Europe, several reincarnationist movements were persecuted as heresies, through the establishment of the [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisition]] in the Latin west. These included the [[Cathar]], Paterene or Albigensian church of western Europe, the [[Paulician]] movement, which arose in Armenia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11583b.htm |title=Newadvent.org |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1911-02-01 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bogomils]] in [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Runciman, ''The Medieval Manichee: A Study of the Christian Dualist Heresy'', 1982, {{ISBN|0-521-28926-2}}, Cambridge University Press, ''The Bogomils'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=d1LGB7u5iD0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=mediaeval+manichee&amp;cd=1 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian sects such as the Bogomils and the Cathars, who professed reincarnation and other gnostic beliefs, were referred to as "Manichean", and are today sometimes described by scholars as "Neo-Manichean".&lt;ref&gt;For example Dondaine, Antoine. O.P. ''Un traite neo-manicheen du XIIIe siecle: Le Liber de duobus principiis, suivi d'un fragment de rituel Cathare'' (Rome: Institutum Historicum Fratrum Praedicatorum, 1939)&lt;/ref&gt; As there is no known Manichaean mythology or terminology in the writings of these groups there has been some dispute among historians as to whether these groups truly were descendants of Manichaeism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01267e.htm |title=Newadvent.org |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Renaissance and Early Modern period===
While reincarnation has been a matter of faith in some communities from an early date it has also frequently been argued for on principle, as Plato does when he argues that the number of souls must be finite because souls are indestructible,&lt;ref&gt;"the souls must always be the same, for if none be destroyed they will not diminish in number." Republic X, 611. The Republic of Plato By Plato, Benjamin Jowett Edition: 3 Published by Clarendon press, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Franklin]] held a similar view.&lt;ref&gt;In a letter to his friend [[George Whatley]] written May 23, 1785: Jennifer T. Kennedy, Death Effects: Revisiting the conceit of Franklin's ''Memoir'', ''Early American Literature'', 2001. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/25057231 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes such convictions, as in Socrates' case, arise from a more general personal faith, at other times from anecdotal evidence such as Plato makes Socrates offer in the ''Myth of Er''.

During the [[Renaissance]] translations of Plato, the [[Hermetica]] and other works fostered new European interest in reincarnation. [[Marsilio Ficino]]&lt;ref&gt;Marsilio Ficino, ''Platonic Theology'', 17.3–4&lt;/ref&gt; argued that Plato's references to reincarnation were intended allegorically, Shakespeare alluded to the doctrine of reincarnation&lt;ref&gt;"Again, Rosalind in "As You Like It" (Act III., Scene 2), says: ''I was never so be-rhimed that I can remember since Pythagoras's time, when I was an Irish rat"'' — alluding to the doctrine of the transmigration of souls." William H. Grattan Flood, quoted at [http://www.libraryireland.com/IrishMusic/XVII-2.php Libraryireland.com]&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Giordano Bruno]] was burned at the stake by authorities after being found guilty of heresy by the [[Roman Inquisition]] for his teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Boulting, 1914. pp. 163–64&lt;/ref&gt; But the Greek philosophical works remained available and, particularly in north Europe, were discussed by groups such as the [[Cambridge Platonists]].

===19th to 20th centuries===

[[Image:Wm james.jpg|upright|thumb|right|American psychologist and philosopher [[William James]] (1842–1910) was an early psychical researcher.&lt;ref name="Berger"&gt;{{cite book |last=Berger |first=Arthur S. |authorlink= |author2=Berger, Joyce  |title=The Encyclopedia of Parapsychology and Psychical Research |publisher=Paragon House Publishers |year=1991 |pages= |isbn=1-55778-043-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

By the 19th century the philosophers [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, A: "Parerga und Paralipomena" (Eduard Grisebach edition), On Religion, Section 177&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nietzsche]]&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche and the Doctrine of Metempsychosis, in J. Urpeth &amp; J. Lippitt, ''Nietzsche and the Divine'',  Manchester: Clinamen, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; could access the Indian scriptures for discussion of the doctrine of reincarnation, which recommended itself to the [[American Transcendentalism|American Transcendentalists]] [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Walt Whitman]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and was adapted by [[Francis Bowen]] into ''Christian Metempsychosis''.&lt;ref name="shirleymaclaine.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shirleymaclaine.com/articles/reincarnation/article-318 |title=Shirleymaclaine.com |publisher=Shirleymaclaine.com |accessdate=2011-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106160539/http://www.shirleymaclaine.com/articles/reincarnation/article-318 |archive-date=2011-11-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 20th century, interest in reincarnation had been introduced into the nascent discipline of [[psychology]], largely due to the influence of [[William James]], who raised aspects of the [[philosophy of mind]], [[comparative religion]], the psychology of religious experience and the nature of empiricism.&lt;ref&gt;David Hammerman, Lisa Lenard, ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Reincarnation'', Penguin, p.34. For relevant works by James, see; William James, ''Human Immortality: Two Supposed Objections to the Doctrine (the Ingersoll Lecture, 1897)'', ''The Will to Believe, Human Immortality'' (1956) Dover Publications, {{ISBN|0-486-20291-7}}, ''The Varieties of Religious Experience: A Study in Human Nature'' (1902), {{ISBN|0-14-039034-0}}, ''Essays in Radical Empiricism'' (1912) Dover Publications 2003, {{ISBN|0-486-43094-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; James was influential in the founding of the [[American Society for Psychical Research]] (ASPR) in [[New York City]] in 1885, three years after the British [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR) was inaugurated in London,&lt;ref name="Berger"/&gt; leading to systematic, critical investigation of paranormal phenomena.

At this time popular awareness of the idea of reincarnation was boosted by the [[Theosophical Society]]'s dissemination of systematised and universalised Indian concepts and also by the influence of magical societies like [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|The Golden Dawn]]. Notable personalities like [[Annie Besant]], [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[Dion Fortune]] made the subject almost as [[Reincarnation in popular culture|familiar an element of the popular culture]] of the west as of the east. By 1924 the subject could be satirised in popular children's books.&lt;ref&gt;Richmal Crompton, ''More William'', George Newnes, London, 1924, XIII. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17125/17125-h/17125-h.htm William and the Ancient Souls]; "The memory usually came in a flash. For instance, you might remember in a flash when you were looking at a box of matches that you had been Guy Fawkes."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Théodore Flournoy]] was among the first to study a claim of past-life recall in the course of his investigation of the medium [[Hélène Smith]], published in 1900, in which he defined the possibility of [[cryptomnesia]] in such accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Théodore Flournoy, [http://www.psychanalyse-paris.com/-Des-Indes-a-la-planete-Mars-.html Des Indes à la planète Mars], Étude sur un cas de somnambulisme avec glossolalie, Éditions Alcan et Eggimann, Paris et Genève, 1900&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Carl Gustav Jung]], like Flournoy based in Switzerland, also emulated him in his thesis based on a study of cryptomnesia in psychism. Later Jung would emphasise the importance of the persistence of memory and ego in psychological study of reincarnation: "This concept of rebirth necessarily implies the continuity of personality... (that) one is able, at least potentially, to remember that one has lived through previous existences, and that these existences were one's own...."&lt;ref name="shirleymaclaine.com"/&gt; [[Hypnosis]], used in [[psychoanalysis]] for retrieving  forgotten memories, was eventually tried as a means of studying the phenomenon of past life recall.

The [[Bhagavad Gita]] states:

{{bquote|
Just as in the body childhood, adulthood and old age happen to an embodied being. So also he (the embodied being) acquires another body. The wise one is not deluded about this. – (2:13){{Sfn| Chapple|2010|p=98}}

As, after casting away worn out garments, a man later takes new ones. So after casting away worn out bodies, the embodied Self encounters other new ones. – (2:22){{Sfn| Chapple|2010|p=107}}

When an embodied being transcends, these three qualities which are the source of the body. Released from birth, death, old age and pain, he attains immortality. – (14:20){{Sfn| Chapple|2010|p=582}}
}}

There are internal differences within Hindu traditions on reincarnation and the state of moksha. For example, the dualistic devotional traditions such as [[Madhvacharya]]'s Dvaita Vedanta tradition of Hinduism champion a theistic premise, assert that human soul and Brahman are different, loving devotion to Brahman (god Vishnu in Madhvacharya's theology) is the means to release from Samsara, it is the grace of God which leads to moksha, and spiritual liberation is achievable only in after-life (''videhamukti'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeaneane D.

Buddhist traditions also vary in their mechanistic details on rebirth.

Within Japanese [[Zen]], reincarnation is accepted by some, but rejected by others. A distinction can be drawn between "folk Zen", as in the Zen practiced by devotional lay people, and "philosophical Zen". Folk Zen generally accepts the various supernatural elements of Buddhism such as rebirth. Philosophical Zen, however, places more emphasis on the present moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=McClelland|first=Norman C.|title=Encyclopedia of Reincarnation and Karma|page=281|year=2010|isbn=9780786456758|publisher=McFarland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=warner&gt;{{citation|last=Warner|first=Brad|title=Hardcore Zen|isbn= 9780861719891|publisher=Wisdom Publications|year=2005|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some schools conclude that [[karma]] continues to exist and adhere to the person until it works out its consequences. For the [[Sautrantika]] school, each act "perfumes" the individual or "plants a seed" that later germinates. Tibetan Buddhism stresses the state of mind at the time of death. To die with a peaceful mind will stimulate a virtuous seed and a fortunate rebirth; a disturbed mind will stimulate a non-virtuous seed and an unfortunate rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;''Transform Your Life'': A Blissful Journey, page 52), [[Tharpa Publications]] (2001, US ed. 2007) {{ISBN|978-0-9789067-4-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
{{Further information|Saṃsāra (Jainism)|Karma in Jainism}}
[[File:Seven Jain Hells.jpg|thumb|right|200px|17th-century cloth painting depicting seven levels of [[Naraka (Jainism)|Jain hell]] according to [[Jain cosmology]]. Left panel depicts the demi-god and his animal vehicle presiding over each hell.]]
In [[Jainism]], the reincarnation doctrine, along with its theories of ''Saṃsāra'' and Karma, are central to its theological foundations, as evidenced by the extensive literature on it in the major sects of Jainism, and their pioneering ideas on these topics from the earliest times of the Jaina tradition.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=217–236}}&lt;ref name=dundasp14/&gt; Reincarnation in contemporary Jainism traditions is the belief that the worldly life is characterized by continuous rebirths and suffering in various realms of existence.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=226–228}}&lt;ref name="dundasp14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sethia2004p31"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tara Sethia |title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC |year=2004|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karma forms a central and fundamental part of Jain faith, being intricately connected to other of its philosophical concepts like transmigration, reincarnation, liberation, non-violence (''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahiṃsā]]'') and non-attachment, among others. Actions are seen to have consequences: some immediate, some delayed, even into future incarnations. So the doctrine of karma is not considered simply in relation to one life-time, but also in relation to both future incarnations and past lives.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) pp. 226–230&lt;/ref&gt; ''Uttarādhyayana-sūtra'' 3.3–4 states: "The ''jīva'' or the soul is sometimes born in [[devaloka|the world of gods]], sometimes in [[Naraka (Jainism)|hell]]. Sometimes it acquires the body of a [[asura|demon]]; all this happens on account of its karma. This ''jīva'' sometimes takes birth as a worm, as an insect or as an ant."&lt;ref name=krishan43&gt;Krishan, Yuvraj (1997): p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The text further states (32.7): "Karma is the root of birth and death. The souls bound by karma go round and round in the cycle of existence."&lt;ref name=krishan43 /&gt;

Actions and emotions in the current lifetime affect future incarnations depending on the nature of the particular karma. For example, a good and virtuous life indicates a latent desire to experience good and virtuous themes of life. Therefore, such a person attracts karma that ensures that his future births will allow him to experience and manifest his virtues and good feelings unhindered.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) pp.70–71&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, he may take birth in heaven or in a prosperous and virtuous human family. On the other hand, a person who has indulged in immoral deeds, or with a cruel disposition, indicates a latent desire to experience cruel themes of life.&lt;ref name=Kuhn64&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) pp.64–66&lt;/ref&gt; As a natural consequence, he will attract karma which will ensure that he is reincarnated in hell, or in lower life forms, to enable his soul to experience the cruel themes of life.&lt;ref name=Kuhn64/&gt;

There is no retribution, judgment or reward involved but a natural consequences of the choices in life made either knowingly or unknowingly. Hence, whatever suffering or pleasure that a soul may be experiencing in its present life is on account of choices that it has made in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) p.15&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this doctrine, Jainism attributes supreme importance to pure thinking and moral behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, Aidan (2006) p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain texts postulate four ''gatis'', that is states-of-existence or birth-categories, within which the soul transmigrates. The four ''gatis'' are: ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]'' (demi-gods), ''manuṣya'' (humans), ''[[Naraka (Jainism)|nāraki]]'' (hell beings) and ''tiryañca'' (animals, plants and micro-organisms).&lt;ref name=Jaini108&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (1998) p.108&lt;/ref&gt; The four ''gatis'' have four corresponding realms or habitation levels in the vertically tiered [[Jain cosmology#Jain geography|Jain universe]]: demi-gods occupy the higher levels where the heavens are situated; humans, plants and animals occupy the middle levels; and hellish beings occupy the lower levels where seven hells are situated.&lt;ref name=Jaini108/&gt;

Single-sensed souls, however, called ''[[nigoda]]'',&lt;ref&gt;The Jain hierarchy of life classifies living beings on the basis of the senses: five-sensed beings like humans and animals are at the top, and single sensed beings like microbes and plants are at the bottom.&lt;/ref&gt; and element-bodied souls pervade all tiers of this universe. ''Nigodas'' are souls at the bottom end of the existential hierarchy. They are so tiny and undifferentiated, that they lack even individual bodies, living in colonies. According to Jain texts, this infinity of ''nigodas'' can also be found in plant tissues, root vegetables and animal bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (1998) pp.108–09&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on its karma, a soul transmigrates and reincarnates within the scope of this cosmology of destinies. The four main destinies are further divided into sub-categories and still smaller sub-sub-categories. In all, Jain texts speak of a cycle of 8.4 million birth destinies in which souls find themselves again and again as they cycle within ''[[Samsara (Jainism)|samsara]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (2000) p.130&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jainism, God has no role to play in an individual's destiny; one's personal destiny is not seen as a consequence of any system of reward or punishment, but rather as a result of its own personal karma. A text from a volume of the ancient Jain canon, ''[[Vyakhyaprajnapti|Bhagvati sūtra]]'' 8.9.9, links specific states of existence to specific karmas. Violent deeds, killing of creatures having five sense organs, eating fish, and so on, lead to rebirth in hell. Deception, fraud and falsehood lead to rebirth in the animal and vegetable world. Kindness, compassion and humble character result in human birth; while austerities and the making and keeping of vows lead to rebirth in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, Yuvraj (1997) p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

Each soul is thus responsible for its own predicament, as well as its own salvation. Accumulated karma represent a sum total of all unfulfilled desires, attachments and aspirations of a soul.&lt;ref name=Kuhn28&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) p.28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) p.69&lt;/ref&gt; It enables the soul to experience the various themes of the lives that it desires to experience.&lt;ref name=Kuhn28 /&gt; Hence a soul may transmigrate from one life form to another for countless of years, taking with it the karma that it has earned, until it finds conditions that bring about the required fruits. In certain philosophies, heavens and hells are often viewed as places for eternal salvation or eternal damnation for good and bad deeds. But according to Jainism, such places, including the earth are simply the places which allow the soul to experience its unfulfilled karma.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) pp.65–66, 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{See also|Gilgul}}
{{Kabbalah||collapsed=1}}
Jewish mystical texts (the [[Kabbalah]]), from their classic Medieval canon onward, teach a belief in ''[[Gilgul Neshamot]]'' (Hebrew for metempsychosis of souls: literally "soul cycle", plural ''"gilgulim"''). The [[Zohar]] and the [[Sefer HaBahir]] specifically discuss reincarnation. It is a common belief in contemporary [[Hasidic Judaism]], which regards the Kabbalah as sacred and authoritative, though understood in light of a more [[Deveikut|innate]] psychological mysticism. Kabbalah also teaches that "The soul of Moses is reincarnated in every generation."&lt;ref&gt;Kabbalah for Dummies&lt;/ref&gt; Other, Non-Hasidic, [[Orthodox Jewish]] groups while not placing a heavy emphasis on reincarnation, do acknowledge it as a valid teaching.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aish.com/jl-old/kc/48943926.html ]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularization entered modern secular [[Yiddish literature]] and folk motif.

The 16th century mystical renaissance in communal [[Safed]] replaced scholastic [[Jewish philosophy|Rationalism]] as mainstream traditional Jewish theology, both in scholarly circles and in the popular imagination. References to ''gilgul'' in former Kabbalah became systematized as part of the metaphysical purpose of creation. [[Isaac Luria]] (the Ari) brought the issue to the centre of his new mystical articulation, for the first time, and advocated identification of the reincarnations of historic Jewish figures that were compiled by [[Haim Vital]] in his [[Shaar HaGilgulim]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sha'ar Ha'Gilgulim, The Gate of Reincarnations'', Chaim Vital&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gilgul'' is contrasted with the other processes in Kabbalah of [[Ibbur]] ("pregnancy"), the attachment of a second soul to an individual for (or by) good means, and [[Dybuk]] ("possession"), the attachment of a spirit, demon, etc. to an individual for (or by) "bad" means.

In Lurianic Kabbalah, reincarnation is not retributive or fatalistic, but an expression of Divine compassion, the microcosm of the doctrine of cosmic rectification of creation. ''Gilgul'' is a heavenly agreement with the individual soul, conditional upon circumstances. Luria's radical system focused on [[Tohu and Tikkun|rectification]] of the Divine soul, played out through Creation. The true essence of anything is the divine spark within that gives it existence. Even a stone or leaf possesses such a soul that "came into this world to receive a rectification". A human soul may occasionally be exiled into lower inanimate, vegetative or animal creations. The most basic component of the soul, the [[nefesh]], must leave at the cessation of blood production. There are four other soul components and different nations of the world possess different forms of souls with different purposes. Each Jewish soul is reincarnated in order to fulfill each of the [[613 Mitzvot|613 Mosaic commandments]] that elevate a particular spark of holiness associated with each commandment. Once all the Sparks are redeemed to their spiritual source, the [[Mashiach|Messianic Era]] begins. Non-Jewish observance of the [[7 Laws of Noah]] assists the Jewish people, though Biblical adversaries of Israel reincarnate to oppose.

Among the many rabbis who accepted reincarnation are [[Nahmanides]] (the Ramban) and Rabbenu [[Bahya ben Asher]], [[Levi ibn Habib]] (the Ralbah), [[Shelomoh Alkabez]], [[Moses Cordovero]], [[Moses Chaim Luzzatto]]; early Hasidic masters such as the [[Baal Shem Tov]], [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]] and [[Nachman of Breslov]], as well as virtually all later Hasidic masters;  contemporary Hasidic teachers such as DovBer Pinson and [[Moshe Weinberger]]; and key Mitnagdic leaders, such as the [[Vilna Gaon]] and [[Chaim Volozhin]] and their school, as well as Rabbi [[Shalom Sharabi]] (known at the RaShaSH), the [[Ben Ish Chai]] of Baghdad, [[Baba Sali]] and Rabbi [[Joel Landau (rabbi)|Joel Landau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://limmudbayarea2016.sched.com/event/7YDY/judaism-and-reincarnation|title=Limmud Bay Area 2016: Judaism and Reincarnation|website=limmudbayarea2016.sched.com|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbis who have rejected the idea include [[Saadia Gaon]], [[David Kimhi]], [[Hasdai Crescas]], [[Joseph Albo]], [[Abraham ibn Daud]], [[Leon de Modena]], [[Solomon ben Aderet]], [[Maimonides]] and [[Asher ben Jehiel]]. Among the [[Geonim]], [[Hai Gaon]] argued in favour of ''gilgulim''.

===Sikhism===
Founded in the 15th century, Sikhism's founder [[Guru Nanak]] had a choice between the cyclical reincarnation concept of ancient Indian religions and the linear concept of early 7th-century Islam, and he chose the cyclical concept of time.&lt;ref name=colesambhi13&gt;{{cite book|author1=W.O.

The doctrines of Sikhism teach that the soul exists, and is passed from one body to another in endless cycles of [[Saṃsāra]], until liberation. Each birth begins with karma (''karam''), and these actions leave a ''karni'' (karmic signature) on one's soul which influences future rebirths, but it is God whose grace that liberates.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"/&gt; The way out of the reincarnation cycle, asserts Sikhism, is to live an ethical life, devote oneself to God and constantly remember God's name.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair |title=Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vdhLAQAAQBAJ  |year=2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=978-1-4411-0231-7 |pages=145–147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The precepts of Sikhism encourage the [[bhakti]] of One Lord for ''mukti'' (liberation).&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=H.

The [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba believe]] in reincarnation within the family. The names Babatunde (Father returns), Yetunde (Mother returns), Babatunji (Father wakes once again) and Sotunde (The wise man returns) all offer vivid evidence of the Ifa concept of familial or lineal rebirth. There is no simple guarantee that your grandfather or great uncle will "come back" in the birth of your child, however.

Whenever the time arrives for a spirit to return to Earth (otherwise known as The Marketplace) through the conception of a new life in the direct bloodline of the family, one of the component entities of a person's being returns, while the other remains in Heaven (Ikole Orun). The spirit that returns does so in the form of a Guardian Ori. One's Guardian Ori, which is represented and contained in the crown of the head, represents not only the spirit and energy of one's previous blood relative, but the accumulated wisdom he or she has acquired through a myriad of lifetimes. This is not to be confused with one’s spiritual Ori, which contains personal destiny, but instead refers to the coming back to The Marketplace of one's personal blood Ori through one's new life and experiences.&lt;!--removed obvious promotional material &amp; link to that website--&gt;

The following is a story of human-to-human reincarnation as told by Thunder Cloud, a Winnebago ([[Ho-Chunk]] tribe) [[Shamanism|shaman]] referred to as T. C. in the narrative. Here T. C. talks about his two previous lives and how he died and came back again to this his third lifetime. He describes his time between lives, when he was “blessed” by Earth Maker and all the abiding spirits and given special powers, including the ability to heal the sick.

T. C.'s Account of His Two Reincarnations:

{{bquote|I ''(my ghost)'' was taken to the place where the sun sets ''(the west)''. ... While at that place, I thought I would come back to earth again, and the old man with whom I was staying said to me, “My son, did you not speak about wanting to go to the earth again?” I had, as a matter of fact, only thought of it, yet he knew what I wanted. Then he said to me, “You can go, but you must ask the chief first.” Then I went and told the chief of the village of my desire, and he said to me, “You may go and obtain your revenge upon the people who killed your relatives and you.” Then I was brought down to earth. ... There I lived until I died of old age. ... As I was lying [in my grave], someone said to me, “Come, let us go away.” So then we went toward the setting of the sun. There we came to a village where we met all the dead. ... From that place I came to this earth again for the third time, and here I am''.&lt;ref name=Jefferson2008 &gt;{{Cite book |last=Jefferson |first=Warren |year=2008 |title=Reincarnation beliefs of North American Indians : soul journeys, metamorphoses, and near-death experiences |publisher=Native Voices |isbn=1-57067-212-1 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/272306114}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Radin, 1923)}}

===Christianity===
In the major Christian denominations, the concept of reincarnation is absent and it is nowhere explicitly referred to in the Bible. However, in a survey by the Pew Forum in 2009, 24% of American Christians expressed a belief in reincarnation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ANALYSIS December 9, 2009 |url=http://pewforum.org/Other-Beliefs-and-Practices/Many-Americans-Mix-Multiple-Faiths.aspx |title=Pewforum.org |publisher=Pewforum.org |date=2009-12-09 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a 1981 survey 31% of regular churchgoing European Catholics expressed a belief in reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spirituale-wholeness.org/faqs/reinceur/reineuro.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010425113340/http://spiritual-wholeness.org/faqs/reinceur/reineuro.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-04-25 |title=Spiritual-wholeness.org |publisher=Spiritual-wholeness.org |accessdate=2011-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some Christian theologians interpret certain Biblical passages as referring to reincarnation. These passages include the questioning of Jesus as to whether he is Elijah, John the Baptist, Jeremiah, or another prophet (Matthew 16:13-15 and John 1:21-22) and, less clearly (while Elijah was said not to have died, but to have been taken up to heaven), John the Baptist being asked if he is not Elijah (John 1:25).&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Frieling, ''Christianity and Reincarnation'', Floris Books 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Albrecht, ''Reincarnation, a Christian Appraisal'', InterVarsity Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynn A.

====The idea of reincarnation in the early Church fathers====
There is evidence&lt;ref&gt;"The Big Book of Reincarnation", by Roy Stemman, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; that [[Origen]], a [[Church father]] in early Christian times, taught reincarnation in his lifetime but that when his works were translated into Latin these references were concealed. One of the epistles written by [[St. Jerome]], "To Avitus" (Letter 124 ; Ad Avitum. Epistula CXXIV),&lt;ref name="mlat.uzh.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlat.uzh.ch/MLS/text.php?tabelle=Hieronymus_Stridonensis_cps2&amp;rumpfid=Hieronymus_Stridonensis_cps2,%20Epistolae,%20124,%20%20%20%20p0&amp;corpus=2&amp;lang=0&amp;current_title=EPISTOLA%20CXXIV.%20AD%20AVITUM.%20Quid%20cavendum%20in%20Libris%20%CF%80%CE%B5%CF%81%E1%BD%B6%20%E1%BC%80%CF%81%CF%87%E1%BF%B6%CE%BD.&amp;links=&amp;inframe=1|title=Hieronymus_Stridonensis_cps2, Epistolae, 124, p0|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which asserts that Origen's ''On First Principles'' (Latin: ''De Principiis''; Greek: Περὶ Ἀρχῶν&lt;ref name=Cross&gt;Cross, F. L., and Elizabeth A. Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' (Second Edition). New York: Oxford University Press, 1984. p. 1009.&lt;/ref&gt;) was mistranscribed:

{{Quote| About ten years ago that saintly man [[Saint Pammachius|Pammachius]] sent me a copy of a certain person's [ [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]]'s&lt;ref name="mlat.uzh.ch"/&gt; ] rendering, or rather misrendering, of Origen's ''First Principles''; with a request that in a Latin version I should give the true sense of the Greek and should set down the writer's words for good or for evil without bias in either direction. When I did as he wished and sent him the book, he was shocked to read it and locked it up in his desk lest being circulated it might wound the souls of many.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3001124.htm|title=Church Fathers: Letter 124 (Jerome)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Under the impression that Origen was a heretic like [[Arius]], St. Jerome criticizes ideas described in ''On First Principles''. Further in "To Avitus" (Letter 124), St. Jerome writes about "convincing proof" that Origen teaches reincarnation in the original version of the book:

{{Quote|The following passage is a convincing proof that he holds the transmigration of the souls and annihilation of bodies. 'If it can be shown that an incorporeal and reasonable being has life in itself independently of the body and that it is worse off in the body than out of it; then beyond a doubt bodies are only of secondary importance and arise from time to time to meet the varying conditions of reasonable creatures. Those who require bodies are clothed with them, and contrariwise, when fallen souls have lifted themselves up to better things, their bodies are once more annihilated. They are thus ever vanishing and ever reappearing.'&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;}}

The original text of ''On First Principles'' has almost completely disappeared.  It remains extant as ''De Principiis'' in fragments faithfully translated into Latin by St. Jerome and in "the not very reliable Latin translation of [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]]."&lt;ref name=Cross /&gt;

McClelland |2010|pages=122–123 }} For instance, historically, South Asian Isma'ilis performed [[Chanto|chantas]] yearly, one of which is for seeking forgiveness of sins committed in past lives. 

====Ghulat sects====
{{Shia Islam||collapsed=1}}
The idea of reincarnation is accepted by a few [[Shia]] [[Muslim]] sects, particularly of the [[Ghulat]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Peter Lamborn, ''Scandal: Essays in Islamic Heresy'', Brooklyn, NY: Autonomedia.

Reincarnation was also accepted by some streams of Sufism. Modern Sufis who embrace the idea include Bawa Muhaiyadeen.&lt;ref&gt;see his ''To Die Before Death: The Sufi Way of Life''&lt;/ref&gt; However [[Inayat Khan]] has criticized the idea as unhelpful to the spiritual seeker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnosticliberationfront.com/sufi_message_of_hazrat_inayat%20khan.htm Gnostic liberation front] The Sufi Message of Hazrat Inayat Khan&lt;/ref&gt;

===Druze===
{{Druze|collapsed=1}}
{{See also|Druze#Beliefs}}
Reincarnation is a paramount tenet in the [[Druze]] faith.&lt;ref&gt;Seabrook, W. B., ''Adventures in Arabia'', Harrap and Sons 1928, (chapters on Druze religion)&lt;/ref&gt; There is an eternal [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|duality]] of the body and the soul and it is impossible for the soul to exist without the body. Therefore, reincarnations occur instantly at one's death. While in the Hindu and Buddhist belief system a soul can be transmitted to any living creature, in the Druze belief system this is not possible and a human soul will only transfer to a human body. Furthermore, a male Druze can only be reincarnated as another male Druze and a female Druze can only be reincarnated as another female Druze. Additionally, souls cannot be divided and the number of souls existing is finite.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Dwairy, Marwan (2006) "The Psychosocial Function Of Reincarnation Among Druze In Israel" ''Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry,'' page 29 – 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Very few Druzes are able to recall their past but, if they are able to they are called a ''Nateq''. Typically souls who have died violent deaths in their previous incarnation will be able to recall memories. Since death is seen as a quick transient state, mourning is discouraged.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Unlike other Abrahamic faiths, heaven and hell are spiritual. Heaven is the ultimate happiness received when soul escapes the cycle of rebirths and reunites with the Creator, while hell is conceptualized as the bitterness of being unable to reunite with the Creator and escape from the cycle of rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=James |title=The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2002 |isbn=1615927387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New religious and spiritual movements===
{{Paranormal|state=collapsed}}

====Spiritism====
[[File:Tombe Allan Kardec.JPG|thumb|upright|Tomb of [[Allan Kardec]], founder of spiritism. The inscription says in French "To be born, die, again be reborn, and so progress unceasingly, such is the law".]]
[[Spiritism]], a Christian philosophy codified in the 19th century by the French educator [[Allan Kardec]], teaches reincarnation or rebirth into human life after death. According to this doctrine, free will and cause and effect are the corollaries of reincarnation, and reincarnation provides a mechanism for man's spiritual evolution in successive lives.&lt;ref name="Hess2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=David J. Hess|title=Spirits and Scientists: Ideology, Spiritism and Brazilian Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oGxsfV-lTtEC&amp;pg=PA16|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|isbn=978-0-271-04080-6|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Theosophy====
The [[Theosophical Society]] draws much of its inspiration from India. The idea is, according to a recent Theosophical writer, "the master-key to modern problems", including heredity.&lt;ref name="Theosophy and reincarnation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blavatskytrust.org.uk/html/wr_reincarnation.htm |title=Theosophy and reincarnation |publisher=Blavatskytrust.org.uk |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Theosophical world-view reincarnation is the vast rhythmic process by which the soul, the part of a person which belongs to the formless non-material and timeless worlds, unfolds its spiritual powers in the world and comes to know itself. It descends from sublime, free, spiritual realms and gathers experience through its effort to express itself in the world. Afterwards there is a withdrawal from the physical plane to successively higher levels of reality, in death, a purification and assimilation of the past life. Having cast off all instruments of personal experience it stands again in its spiritual and formless nature, ready to begin its next rhythmic manifestation, every lifetime bringing it closer to complete self-knowledge and self-expression. However it may attract old mental, emotional, and energetic ''karma'' patterns to form the new personality.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

====Modern astrology====
Inspired by [[Helena Blavatsky]]'s major works, including ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'' and ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'', [[astrology|astrologers]] in the early twentieth-century integrated the concepts of [[karma]] and reincarnation into the practice of [[Western astrology]]. Notable astrologers who advanced this development included [[Alan Leo]], [[Charles E. O. Carter]], [[Marc Edmund Jones]], and [[Dane Rudhyar]]. A new synthesis of East and West resulted as Hindu and Buddhist concepts of reincarnation were fused with Western astrology's deep roots in [[Hermeticism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]. In the case of Rudhyar, this synthesis was enhanced with the addition of [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] [[depth psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Jutta Woods. "The Theosophical Heritage in Modern Astrology." ''The Mountain Astrologer.'' Aug/Sept 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This dynamic integration of astrology, reincarnation and depth psychology has continued into the modern era with the work of astrologers [[Steven Forrest (astrologer)|Steven Forrest]] and Jeffrey Wolf Green.  Their respective schools of Evolutionary Astrology are based on "an acceptance of the fact that human beings incarnate in a succession of lifetimes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forrestastrology.com/about-us/about-evolutionary-astrology|title=About Evolutionary Astrology|author=Steven Forrest and Jeffrey Wolf Green|accessdate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anthroposophy====
[[Anthroposophy]] describes reincarnation from the point of view of Western philosophy and culture. The ego is believed to transmute transient soul experiences into universals that form the basis for an individuality that can endure after death. These universals include ideas, which are intersubjective and thus transcend the purely personal (spiritual consciousness), intentionally formed human character (spiritual life), and becoming a fully conscious human being (spiritual humanity). [[Rudolf Steiner]] described both the general principles he believed to be operative in reincarnation, such as that one's will activity in one life forms the basis for the thinking of the next,&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. ''Reincarnation and Karma'' by Steiner&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of successive lives of various individualities.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, ''Karmic Relationships'', volumes 1–6&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scientology====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Whole Track]] --&gt;
{{See also|Scientology beliefs and practices}}

Past reincarnation, usually termed "past lives", is a key part of the principles and practices of the [[Church of Scientology]]. Scientologists believe that the human individual is actually a ''[[thetan]]'', an immortal spiritual entity, that has fallen into a degraded state as a result of past-life experiences. Scientology [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] is intended to free the person of these past-life traumas and recover past-life memory, leading to a higher state of spiritual awareness. This idea is echoed in their highest fraternal religious order, the [[Sea Organization]], whose motto is "Revenimus" or "We Come Back", and whose members sign a "billion-year contract" as a sign of commitment to that ideal. [[L. Ron Hubbard]], the founder of Scientology, does not use the word "reincarnation" to describe its beliefs, noting that: "The common definition of reincarnation has been altered from its original meaning. The word has come to mean 'to be born again in different life forms' whereas its actual definition is 'to be born again into the flesh of another body.' Scientology ascribes to this latter, original definition of reincarnation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientology.org/html/opencms/cos/scientology/en_US/news-media/faq/pg016.html |title=Scientology Church &amp; Religion – What is Scientology? |work=Scientology |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613231607/http://www.scientology.org/html/opencms/cos/scientology/en_US/news-media/faq/pg016.html |archivedate=2006-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first writings in Scientology regarding past lives date from around 1951 and slightly earlier. In 1960, Hubbard published a book on past lives entitled ''[[Have You Lived Before This Life]]''. In 1968 he wrote ''[[Mission into Time]]'', a report on a five-week sailing expedition to Sardinia, Sicily and Carthage to see if specific evidence could be found to substantiate L. Ron Hubbard's recall of incidents in his own past, centuries ago.

====Meher Baba====
The Indian spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] stated that reincarnation occurs due to desires and once those desires are extinguished the ego-mind ceases to reincarnate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967), [http://www.discoursesbymeherbaba.org ''Discourses''], Volume III, Sufism Reoriented, 1967, {{ISBN|1-880619-09-1}}, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wicca====

[[Wicca]] is a neo-pagan religion focused on nature, guided by the philosophy of [[Wiccan Rede]] that advocates the tenets "Harm None, Do As Ye Will". Wiccans believe in a form of karmic return where one's deeds are returned, either in the current life or in another life, threefold or multiple times in order to teach one lessons (The Threefold Law). Reincarnation is therefore an accepted part of the Wiccan faith.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Wicca and Witchcraft, Raven Grimassi&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=December 2016}} Wiccans also believe that death and afterlife are important experiences for the soul to transform and prepare for future lifetimes.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Reincarnation in the Western world==
During recent decades, many people in the West have developed an interest in reincarnation.&lt;ref name="hi.is"/&gt; Recent studies have indicated that some Westerners accept the idea of reincarnation&lt;ref name="hi.is" /&gt; including certain contemporary people who were from Catholic families,&lt;ref&gt;Tony Walter and Helen Waterhouse, "[http://socrel.oxfordjournals.org/content/60/2/187.full.pdf A Very Private Belief: Reincarnation in Contemporary England]". ''Sociology of Religion'', Vol. 60, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; modern [[Neopaganism|Neopagans]], followers of [[Spiritism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] and students of [[esotericism|esoteric]] philosophies such as [[Kabbalah]], and [[Gnostic]] and [[Esoteric Christianity]] as well as followers of Indian religions. Demographic survey data from 1999–2002 shows a significant minority of people from Europe and America, where there is reasonable freedom of thought and access to ideas but no outstanding recent reincarnationist tradition, believe we had a life before we were born, will survive death and be born again physically. The mean for the Nordic countries is 22%.&lt;ref name="surv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hi.is/~erlendur/english/Nordic_Psychology_erlhar06.pdf|title=Popular psychology, belief in life after death and reincarnation in the Nordic countries, Western and Eastern Europe|format=PDF|accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief in reincarnation is particularly high in the Baltic countries, with [[Lithuania]] having the highest figure for the whole of [[Europe]], 44%. The lowest figure is in East Germany, 12%. In [[Russia]], about one-third believes in reincarnation. The effect of communist anti-religious ideas on the beliefs of the populations of [[Eastern Europe]] seems to have been rather slight, if any, except apparently in East Germany.&lt;ref name="surv" /&gt; Overall, 22% of respondents in [[Western Europe]] believe in reincarnation.&lt;ref name="surv" /&gt; According to a 2005 Gallup poll 20 percent of U.S. adults believe in reincarnation. Recent surveys by the Barna Group, a Christian research nonprofit organization, have found that a quarter of U.S. Christians, including 10 percent of all [[born again]] Christians, embrace the idea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldmonitor.wordpress.com/2007/08/25/buddhism-china/]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dalailama1_20121014_4639.jpg|thumb|The [[14th Dalai Lama]] has stated his belief that it would be difficult for science to disprove reincarnation.]]
Skeptic [[Carl Sagan]] asked the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] what he would do if a fundamental tenet of his religion (reincarnation) were definitively disproved by science. The Dalai Lama answered, "If science can disprove reincarnation, Tibetan Buddhism would abandon reincarnation… but it's going to be mighty hard to disprove reincarnation."&lt;ref&gt;"The Boundaries of Knowledge in Buddhism, Christianity, and Science", by Paul David Numrich, p. 13, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, {{ISBN|9783525569870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Stevenson reported that belief in reincarnation is held (with variations in details) by adherents of almost all major religions except [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]].  In addition, between 20 and 30 percent of persons in western countries who may be nominal Christians also believe in reincarnation.&lt;ref name=jh&gt;Jane Henry (2005).

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors reported that surveys have found about one fifth to one quarter of Europeans have some level of belief in reincarnation, with similar results found in the USA. In the interviewed group, the belief in the existence of this phenomenon appeared independent of their age, or the type of religion that these people belonged to, with most being Christians. The beliefs of this group also did not appear to contain any more than usual of "new age" ideas (broadly defined) and the authors interpreted their ideas on reincarnation as "one way of tackling issues of suffering", but noted that this seemed to have little effect on their private lives.

Waterhouse also published a detailed discussion of beliefs expressed in the interviews.&lt;ref name=Waterhouse1999&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; She noted that although most people "hold their belief in reincarnation quite lightly" and were unclear on the details of their ideas, personal experiences such as past-life memories and [[near-death experience]]s had influenced most believers, although only a few had direct experience of these phenomena. Waterhouse analyzed the influences of second-hand accounts of reincarnation, writing that most of the people in the survey had heard other people's accounts of past-lives from regression hypnosis and dreams and found these fascinating, feeling that there "must be something in it" if other people were having such experiences.

=={{Anchor|Reincarnation research}}Academic research into claims of reincarnation==
Psychiatrist [[Ian Stevenson]], from the [[University of Virginia]], having grown up with a mother who was a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]],&lt;ref name="Stevenson2006p13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/personalitystudies/Stevenson.pdf|title=Stevenson 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721165720/http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/personalitystudies/Stevenson.pdf|archive-date=July 21, 2006|dead-url=yes|access-date=September 1, 2016|df=}}, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated his latter career to investigating claims of reincarnation in hopes of providing evidence that reincarnation happens. Other people who have undertaken similar pursuits include [[Jim B. Tucker]], [[Antonia Mills]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamesgmatlock.net/resources/researchers/mills/|title=Mills|work=Signs of Reincarnation}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Satwant Pasricha]], [[Godwin Samararatne]], and [[Erlendur Haraldsson]], but Stevenson's publications remain the most well-known.

Stevenson conducted more than 2,500 [[case study|case studies]] of young children who claimed to remember past lives over a period of 40 years and published twelve books, including ''[[Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation]]'', [[Reincarnation_and_Biology|Reincarnation and Biology: A Contribution to the Etiology of Birthmarks and Birth Defects, a two-part monograph]] and ''[[Where Reincarnation and Biology Intersect]]''. He documented the family's and child's statements along with correlates to a [[deceased]] person he believed matched the child's memory. Stevenson also claimed that some [[birthmark]]s and [[birth defects]] matched wounds and scars on the deceased, sometimes providing [[medical records]] like [[autopsy]] photographs to make his case.&lt;ref&gt;Cadoret, Remi. [http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=177497 Book Review: European Cases of the Reincarnation Type] ''The American Journal of Psychiatry'', April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Expecting controversy and [[skepticism]], Stevenson also searched for disconfirming evidence and alternative explanations for the reports, but he argued (not without criticism) that his methods ruled out all possible "normal" explanations for the child’s memories.&lt;ref name="document"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Shroder | first = T | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/10/AR2007021001393.html?nav=hcmodule | title = Ian Stevenson; Sought To Document Memories Of Past Lives in Children | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 2007-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stevenson's work in this regard was impressive enough to [[Carl Sagan]] that he referred to what was apparently Stevenson's investigations in his book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' as an example of carefully collected empirical data, though he rejected reincarnation as a parsimonious explanation for the stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Demon Haunted World|author=Sagan, Carl|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=1996|isbn=978-0-394-53512-8|location=|page=300|authorlink=Carl Sagan}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] cited Stevenson's works in his book ''[[The End of Faith]]'' as part of a body of data that seems to attest to the reality of psychic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The End of Faith|last1=Harris|first1=Sam|date=September 17, 2005|publisher=W.

Critical reviews of these claims include work by [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]] who criticized the accounts of reincarnation as being purely [[anecdotal evidence|anecdotal]] and [[Cherry picking|cherry-picked]].&lt;ref name="skepticreport.com"&gt;Rockley, Richard.

Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|1-57392-921-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher Keith Augustine wrote in critique that the fact that "the vast majority of Stevenson's cases come from countries where a religious belief in reincarnation is strong, and rarely elsewhere, seems to indicate that cultural conditioning (rather than reincarnation) generates claims of spontaneous past-life memories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infidels.org/library/modern/keith_augustine/immortality.html|title=The Case Against Immortality|publisher=Infidels.org|accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, [[Ian Wilson (author)|Ian Wilson]] pointed out that a large number of Stevenson’s cases consisted of poor children remembering wealthy lives or belonging to a [[Caste system in India|higher caste]]. In these societies, claims of reincarnation are sometimes used as schemes to obtain money from the richer families of alleged former incarnations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Wilson (author)|Wilson, Ian]]. (1981). ''Mind Out of Time: Reincarnation Investigated''. Gollancz. {{ISBN|0-575-02968-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following these types of criticism, Stevenson published a book on ''[[European Cases of the Reincarnation Type]]'' in attempt to show the reports were cross-cultural. Even still, [[Robert A. Baker|Robert Baker]] explained that all the past-life experiences investigated by Stevenson and other parapsychologists are understandable in terms of known psychological factors including a mixture of [[cryptomnesia]] and [[confabulation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert A. Baker|Baker, Robert A]]. (1996). ''Hidden Memories: Voices and Visions from Within''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|0-87975-576-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards also noted that reincarnation invokes assumptions that are inconsistent with modern science.&lt;ref&gt;Cogan, Robert. (1998). ''Critical Thinking: Step by Step''. University Press of America. pp. 202–203. {{ISBN|0-7618-1067-6}} "Edwards catalogs common sense objections which have been made against reincarnation. 1) How does a soul exist between bodies? 2) Tertullian's objection: If there is reincarnation, why are not babies born with the mental abilities of adults? 3) Reincarnation claims an infinite series of prior incarnations. Evolution teaches that there was a time when humans did not yet exist. So reincarnation is inconsistent with modern science. 4) If there is reincarnation, then what is happening when the population increases? 5) If there is reincarnation, then why do so few, if any people, remember past lives?... To answer these objections believers in reincarnation must accept additional assumptions... Acceptance of these silly assumptions, Edwards says, amounts to a crucifixion of one's intellect."

* [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Edwards, Paul]]. (1996, reprinted in 2001). ''Reincarnation: A Critical Examination''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|1-57392-921-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the vast majority of people do not remember previous lives and there is no empirically documented mechanism known that allows personality to survive death and travel to another body, positing the existence of reincarnation is subject to the principle that "[[extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence]]". Researchers such as Stevenson acknowledged these limitations.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/10/AR2007021001393.html?nav=hcmodule|title=Ian Stevenson; Sought To Document Memories Of Past Lives in Children|last=Shroder|first=Tom|date=2007-02-11|accessdate=2011-12-06|publisher=Washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevenson also claimed there were a handful of cases that suggested evidence of [[xenoglossy]], including two where a subject under hypnosis allegedly conversed with people speaking the foreign language, instead of merely being able to recite foreign words. [[Sarah Thomason]], a linguist at the University of Michigan, reanalyzed these cases, concluding that "the linguistic evidence is too weak to provide support for the claims of xenoglossy."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah Thomason|Thomason, Sarah G.]]. [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~thomason/papers/xenogl.pdf "Xenoglossy"]. In [[Gordon Stein]]. (1996). ''The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|1-57392-021-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Religious alienation''' is a term some use to describe how religion creates an impediment to human self-understanding.

== Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel ==
Although the roots of alienation lie far back in the [[Judeo-Christian tradition]], the concept of alienation first gained prominence in the philosophy of [[Hegel]], and particularly in his mature writings. There are signs of the idea in his earlier works, but it is not until the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807) that alienation occupies a central place in his writings.

In the opening sections of the ''Phenomenology'', Hegel attacked the views of [[common sense]] and simplified [[natural science]] that the world consisted of discrete objects independent of man's consciousness. Truth, for Hegel, was not to be found in knowledge that was stripped of any influence from man's own desires and feelings. Ultimately, Hegel considered that there could be no truth that was not intimately linked with the ongoing process of human beings as thinking subjects; truth was their truth. The supposed [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] of the world of nature was in fact an alienation, for man's task was to discover, behind these appearances, his own essential life and finally to view everything as a facet of his own [[self-consciousness]]. The same principle applied to the world of culture in which such spheres as art and religion, if viewed as independent of man, constituted so many alienations to be overcome by integration into the final understanding and recapitulation which was [[Absolute Knowledge]].

== Bruno Bauer ==
Hegel had created a system; and all his followers believed that it was the final one. However, when it came to applying the system to particular problems, they conceived his system to be ambivalent. The fact that alienation seemed to them to be a challenge, something to be overcome, led them to put the emphasis on the concepts of [[dialectic]] and negativity in Hegel's system; and thus they challenged, first in religion and then in politics, his view that the problem of alienation had, at least in principle, been solved. The foremost among these radical disciples of Hegel, [[Bruno Bauer]], applied the concept of alienation to the religious field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=bauer |title=Bruno Bauer |last=Moggach |first=Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bauer, who lectured in [[theology]] and made his name as a [[Gospel]] critic, considered that religious beliefs, and in particular Christianity, caused a division in man's consciousness by becoming opposed to this consciousness as a separate power. Thus religion was an attitude towards the essence of self-consciousness that had become estranged from itself. In this context, Bauer promoted the use of the expression "self-alienation" that soon became current among the [[Young Hegelians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons| editors = Philip  Wiener (ed.)| last = McLellan| first = David| author-link = David McLellan (academic)| title = ALIENATION IN HEGEL AND MARX| encyclopedia = The Dictionary of the History of Ideas| location = New York| accessdate = 2009-09-28| year = 1973| url = http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-06| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090907110351/http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-06| archivedate = 2009-09-07| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ludwig Feuerbach ==
For [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbach]] (''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841)), people alienate their essential being by attributing their human qualities to a god who is then worshipped on account of these qualities. In worshipping god, therefore, people are unconsciously worshipping themselves. Thus Feuerbach argues that religion is a form of alienation which prevents people from attaining realisation of their own species-being. Feuerbach’s thinking has been described as [[Christian humanism|humanist]] in that his theory of alienation is based on a theory of human nature as [[species-being]], as innate to the human species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/education/alienation.html Worldsocialism.org Alienation study case]&lt;/ref&gt; This position would later be examined by [[Karl Marx]] in his "[[Theses on Feuerbach]]".

The '''Rottenburg University of Applied Forest Sciences''' (in [[German language|German]]: ''Hochschule für Forstwirschaft Rottenburg'') is a [[Fachhochschule]] (''university of applied sciences'') in [[Rottenburg am Neckar]], in the [[States of Germany|German state]] of [[Baden-Württemberg]]. The special profile of the university is the principle of sustainable development. In April 2008 the university was winner of the contest ''"Profile and Cooperation – excellence strategies for small and middle universities"''. The contest was announced by the "Founder's Organization for German Sciences" and the "Heinz Nixdorf Foundation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://idw-online.de/pages/de/news255679 Report by the information service of German sciences (German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainability – Basis for Successful Studies
Studying at Schadenweilerhof – hardly any other university offers such a unique atmosphere: personal interaction instead
of massive crowds. Historical walls and the most modern research facilities, surrounded by 2,500 ha of research
forest. With appr. 850 students, the University of Applied Sciences Rottenburg is small but precisely because
of this it is an innovative university. With a clear forestry science profile and six pioneering degrees:
• Forest Sciences, Bachelor of Science
• BioEnergy, Bachelor of Science
• Water Resource Management, Bachelor of Science
• Applied Wood Technology, Bachelor of Science
• Sustainable Rural Development and Regional Management,
Bachelor of Science
• SENCE (Sustainable Energy Competence), Master of Science

The goal of each degree is sustainable management when using natural resources. The University of Applied Sciences
Rottenburg has been awarded several times for these leading edge study programmes by the UNESCO. The close cooperation
with several other universities in the region, as well as having worldwide contacts, provide students the opportunity
to gain overseas experience and work on international research projects. The University of Applied Sciences
Rottenburg’s future concept was awarded for winning the university competition "Excellency Strategies" from the Stifterverband
für die Deutsche Wissenschaft.

In addition, there exist collaborations with many universities worldwide.

In 1954 the State of Baden-Württemberg founded a forestry school in Rottenburg am Neckar. In the 1970s the school was commuted to a vocational school of forestry. And finally in 1979 it was made a Fachhochschule (University of Applied Sciences). In the beginning the university served only as a training school for forest officers in the upper grade of the civil service of the states Baden-Württemberg, [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] and [[Saarland]]. Since 1995 the university is publicly available.

[[File:Schadenweilerhof.jpg|thumb|Schadenweiler estate]]
The university is located in the ''"Schadenweilerhof"'' ''(Schadenweiler estate)'' about two kilometers (ca. one mile) southern of the town, near the Rammert forest. On the place where the university is located today, the village Schadenweiler was situated until the 15th century. The village was donated to the [[Hirsau Abbey]] around 1100. By the 15th century Schadenweiler vanished, the villagers vacated. In 1570 Werner von Themar established a noblemen's estate on the boundary. During a siege in the 17th century the estate was nearly entirely destroyed. Later on the estate devolved to the Spital and the Town of Rottenburg. The manor burned down several times.

{{Culture of Scotland}}
'''Scottish art''' is the body of [[visual art]] made in what is now Scotland, or about Scottish subjects, since prehistoric times. It forms a distinctive tradition within European art, but the political union with England has led its partial subsumation in [[British art]].

The earliest examples of art from what is now Scotland are highly decorated carved stone balls from the [[Neolithic]] period. From the [[Bronze Age]] there are examples of carvings, including the first representations of objects, and [[cup and ring marks]]. More extensive Scottish examples of patterned objects and gold work are found the [[Iron Age]]. Elaborately carved [[Pictish stone]]s and impressive metalwork emerged in Scotland the early Middle Ages. The development of a common style of [[Insular art]] across Great Britain and Ireland influenced elaborate jewellery and [[illuminated manuscript]]s such as the [[Book of Kells]]. Only isolated examples survive of native artwork from the late Middle Ages and of works created or strongly influenced by artists of Flemish origin. The influence of the [[Renaissance]] can be seen in stone carving and painting from the fifteenth century. In the sixteenth century the crown began to employ Flemish court painters who have left a portrait record of royalty. [[Scottish Reformation|The Reformation]] removed a major source of patronage for art and limited the level of public display, but may have helped in the growth of secular domestic forms, particularly elaborate painting of roofs and walls. Although the loss of the court as a result of the [[Union of Crowns]] in 1603 removed another major source of patronage, the seventeenth century saw the emergence of the first significant native artists for whom names are extant, with figures such as [[George Jamesone]] and [[John Michael Wright]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In the eighteenth century Scotland began to produce artists that were significant internationally, all influenced by [[neoclassicism]], such as [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]], [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], the brothers [[John Runciman|John]] and [[Alexander Runciman]], [[Jacob More]] and [[David Allan (painter)|David Allan]]. Towards the end of the century [[Romanticism]] began to influence artistic production, and can be seen in the portraits of artists such as [[Henry Raeburn]]. It also contributed to a tradition of Scottish landscape painting that focused on the [[Highlands]], formulated by figures including [[Alexander Nasmyth]]. The [[Royal Scottish Academy|Royal Scottish Academy of Art]] was created in 1826, and major portrait painters of this period included [[Andrew Geddes (artist)|Andrew Geddes]] and [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]]. [[William Dyce]] emerged as one of the most significant figures in art education in the United Kingdom. The beginnings of a [[Celtic Revival]] can be seen in the late nineteenth century and the art scene was dominated by the work of the [[Glasgow Boys]] and the Four, led [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], who gained an international reputation for their combination of Celtic revival, [[Arts and Crafts movement|Art and Crafts]] and [[Art Nouveau]]. The early twentieth century was dominated by the [[Scottish Colourists]] and [[the Edinburgh School]]. [[Modernism]] enjoyed popularity during this period, with [[William Johnstone (artist)|William Johnstone]] helping to develop the concept of a [[Scottish Renaissance]]. In the post-war period, major artists, including [[John Bellany]] and Alexander Moffat, pursued a strand of "Scottish realism". Moffat's influence can be seen in the work of the "new Glasgow Boys" from the late twentieth century. In the twenty-first century Scotland has continued to produce successful and influential artists such as [[Douglas Gordon]] and [[Susan Philipsz]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Scotland possess significant collections of art, such as the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] and [[National Museum of Scotland]] in Edinburgh and the [[Burrell Collection]] and [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]] in Glasgow. Significant schools of art include the [[Edinburgh College of Art]] and the [[Glasgow School of Art]]. The major funding body with responsibility for the arts in Scotland is [[Creative Scotland]]. Support is also given by local councils and independent foundations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The oldest known examples of art to survive from Scotland are carved stone balls, or [[petrosphere]]s, that date from the late [[Neolithic]] era. They are a uniquely Scottish phenomenon, with over 425 known examples. Most are from modern Aberdeenshire,&lt;ref name="Towie"&gt;[http://nms.scran.ac.uk/000-100-033-206-C "Carved stone ball found at Towie, Aberdeenshire"], ''National Museums of Scotland'', retrieved 14 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but a handful of examples are known from [[Iona]], [[Skye]], [[Harris, Outer Hebrides|Harris]], [[Uist]], [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]], [[Isle of Arran|Arran]], [[Hawick]], [[Wigtownshire]] and fifteen from [[Orkney]], five of which were found at the Neolithic village of [[Skara Brae]].&lt;ref name="Marshall63"&gt;D. N. Marshall, "Carved Stone Balls", ''Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland'', 108, (1976/77), pp. 62–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Many functions have been suggested for these objects, most indicating that they were prestigious and powerful possessions.&lt;ref name=Towie/&gt; Their production may have continued into the [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Neil, G. Ritchie and A. Ritchie, ''Scotland, Archaeology and Early History'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 1991), {{ISBN|0-7486-0291-7}}, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[Bronze Age]] there are extensive examples of [[rock art]]. These include [[cup and ring mark]]s, a central depression carved into stone, surrounded by rings, sometimes not completed. These are common elsewhere in Atlantic Europe and have been found on natural rocks and isolated stones across Scotland. The most elaborate sets of markings are in western Scotland, particularly in the [[Kilmartin]] district. The representations of an axe and a boat at the Ri Cruin Cairn in [[Kilmartin Glen|Kilmartin]], and a boat pecked into [[Wemyss Bay|Wemyss Cave]], are believed to be the oldest known representations of real objects that survive in Scotland. Carved spirals have also been found on the cover stones of burial [[cist]]s in [[Lanarkshire]] and [[Kincardine]].&lt;ref&gt;V. G. Childe, ''The Prehistory Of Scotland'' (London: Taylor and Francis, 1935), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the Iron Age, Scotland had been penetrated by the wider [[La Tène]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;R. G. Collingwood and J. N. L. Myres, ''Roman Britain and the English Settlements'' (New York, NY: Biblo &amp; Tannen, 2nd edn., 1936), {{ISBN|978-0-8196-1160-4}}, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Torrs Pony-cap and Horns]] are perhaps the most impressive of the relatively few finds of La Tène decoration from Scotland, and indicate links with Ireland and southern Britain.&lt;ref&gt;J. Neil, G. Ritchie and A. Ritchie, ''Scotland, Archaeology and Early History,'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd end., 1991), {{ISBN|0-7486-0291-7}}, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stirling torcs]], found in 2009, are a group of four gold [[torc]]s in different styles, dating from 300 BC and 100 BC Two demonstrate common styles found in Scotland and Ireland, but the other two indicate workmanship from what is now southern France and the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] worlds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nms.ac.uk/our_museums/national_museum/past_exhibitions/iron_age_gold.aspx "Iron Age Gold"], ''National Museums of Scotland'', retrieved 14 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

===Middle Ages===
{{Main article|Art in Medieval Scotland}}
{{See also|Scotland in the Middle Ages}}
In the [[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]], four distinct linguistic and political groupings existed in what is now Scotland, each of which produced distinct material cultures. In the east were the [[Picts]], whose kingdoms eventually stretched from the [[River Forth]] to [[Shetland]]. In the west were the Gaelic ([[Goidelic]])-speaking people of [[Dál Riata]], who had close links with Ireland, from where they brought with them the name Scots. In the south were the British ([[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]]-speaking) descendants of the peoples of the Roman-influenced kingdoms of "[[Y Gogledd Hen|The Old North]]", the most powerful and longest surviving of which was the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]]. Finally, there were the English or "Angles", Germanic invaders who had overrun much of southern Britain and held the Kingdom of [[Bernicia]] (later the northern part of [[Northumbria]]), which reached into what are now the Borders of Scotland in the south-east.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Maddicott and D. M. Palliser, eds, ''The Medieval State: Essays Presented to James Campbell'' (London: Continuum, 2000), {{ISBN|1-85285-195-3}}, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only fragments of artifacts survive from the Brythonic speaking kingdoms of southern Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;L. R. Laing, ''Later Celtic Art in Britain and Ireland'' (London: Osprey Publishing, 1987), {{ISBN|0852638744}}, pp. 37–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Pictish art can be seen in the extensive survival of carved [[Pictish stones]], particularly in the north and east of the country. These display a variety of recurring images and patterns, as at [[Dunrobin Castle|Dunrobin]] ([[Sutherland]]) and [[Aberlemno]] ([[Angus, Scotland|Angus]]).&lt;ref name="Graham-Campbell1998pp.7-8"&gt;J.

Batey, ''Vikings in Scotland: an Archaeological Survey'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), {{ISBN|0-7486-0641-6}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few survivals of Pictish silver, notably a number of massive neck-chains including the [[Whitecleuch Chain]], and also the unique silver plaques from the cairn at Norrie's Law.&lt;ref name="Youngs1989pp26-8"&gt;S. Youngs, ed., ''The Work of Angels", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork, 6th–9th Centuries AD'' (London: British Museum Press, 1989), {{ISBN|0-7141-0554-6}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;26–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Irish-Scots art from the kingdom of [[Dál Riata]] is much more difficult to identify, but may include items such as the [[Hunterston brooch]], which with other items such as the [[Monymusk Reliquary]], suggest that Dál Riata was one of the places, as a crossroads between cultures, where the [[Insular art|Insular style]] developed.&lt;ref name="Lane2001"&gt;A. Lane, [http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba62/feat1.shtml "Citadel of the first Scots"], ''British Archaeology'', 62, December 2001. Retrieved 2 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples of Anglo-Saxon art include metalwork, particularly bracelets, clasps and jewellery, that has survived in pagan burials and in exceptional items such as the intricately carved whalebone [[Franks Casket]], thought to have been produced in Northumbria in the early eighth century, which combines pagan, classical and Christian motifs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Reginald Dodwell|C. R. Dodwell]], ''Anglo-Saxon Art: A New Perspective'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1982), {{ISBN|071900926X}}, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Christian conversion of what is now Scotland in the seventh century, artistic styles in Northumbria interacted with those in Ireland and Scotland to become part of the common style historians have identified as insular or Hiberno-Saxon.&lt;ref&gt;C. E. Karkov, ''The Art of Anglo-Saxon England'' (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 2011), {{ISBN|1843836289}}, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Insular art]] is the name given to the common style that developed in Britain and Ireland after the conversion of the Picts and the cultural assimilation of Pictish culture into that of the Scots and Angles,&lt;ref&gt;H. Honour and J. Fleming, ''A World History of Art'' (London: Macmillan), {{ISBN|0-333-37185-2}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;244–7.&lt;/ref&gt; and which became highly influential in continental Europe, contributing to the development of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] styles.&lt;ref&gt;G. Henderson, ''Early Medieval Art'' (London: Penguin, 1972), pp.&amp;nbsp;63–71.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be seen in elaborate [[penannular brooch]]es, often making extensive use of semi-precious stones,&lt;ref&gt;Youngs,''The Work of Angels", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork'', pp. 72–115, and 170–4 and D.

The finest era of the style was brought to an end by the disruption to monastic centres and aristocratic life by [[Viking invasions of Britain|Viking raids]] in the late eighth century.&lt;ref&gt;C.

In the [[Scotland in the High Middle Ages|High Middle Ages]], Scotland adopted the Romanesque in the late twelfth century and retained and revived elements of its style after the Gothic style had become dominant from the thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;T.

[[File:Stirling Head King James V.jpg|thumb|right|One of the [[Stirling Heads]] showing [[James V of Scotland|James V]]]]
Beginning in the fifteenth century, a number of works were produced in Scotland by artists imported from the continent, particularly the [[Netherlands]], generally considered the centre of painting in the [[Northern Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"/&gt; The products of these connections included a fine portrait of [[William Elphinstone]];&lt;ref name="Webster1997pp127-9"/&gt; the images of St Catherine and St John brought to [[Dunkeld]]; and [[Hugo van Der Goes]]'s altarpiece for the [[Trinity College Kirk|Trinity College Church in Edinburgh]], commissioned by [[James III of Scotland|James III]] and the work after which the Flemish [[Master of James IV of Scotland]] is named.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"/&gt; There are also a relatively large number of elaborate devotional books from the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, usually produced in the Low Countries and France for Scottish patrons, including the prayer book commissioned by [[Robert Blackadder]], [[Bishop of Glasgow]], between 1484 and 1492&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9/&gt; and the Flemish illustrated [[book of hours]], known as the [[Hours of James IV of Scotland]], given by [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] to [[Margaret Tudor]] and described by D. H. Caldwell as "perhaps the finest medieval manuscript to have been commissioned for Scottish use".&lt;ref&gt;D. H. Caldwell, ed., ''Angels, Nobles and Unicorns: Art and Patronage in Medieval Scotland'' (Edinburgh: National Museum of Scotland, 1982), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Records also indicate that Scottish palaces were adorned by rich [[Scottish Royal tapestry collection|tapestries]], such as those that depicted scenes from the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' set up for James IV at [[Holyrood Palace|Holyrood]].&lt;ref name="Glendinningetal1996p14"&gt;M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A.

At [[Stirling Castle]], stone carvings on the royal palace from the reign of [[James V of Scotland|James V]] are taken from German patterns,&lt;ref&gt;C. McKean, ''The Scottish Chateau'' (Stroud: Sutton, 2nd edn., 2004), {{ISBN|0-7509-3527-8}}, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; and like the surviving carved oak portrait [[Boss (architecture)|roundels]] from the King's Presence Chamber, known as the Stirling Heads, they include contemporary, biblical and classical figures.&lt;ref&gt;J. Dunbar, ''The Stirling Heads'' (London: [[RCAHMS]]/[[HMSO]], 1975), {{ISBN|0-11-491310-2}}, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformation===
{{Main article|Art in early modern Scotland|Portrait painting in Scotland}}
{{See also|Scottish Reformation}}
During the sixteenth century, Scotland underwent a [[Protestant Reformation]] that created a predominantly Calvinist national [[Church of Scotland]] (kirk), which was strongly Presbyterian in outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community'', pp. 102–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland's ecclesiastical art paid a heavy toll as a result of Protestant [[iconoclasm]], with the almost total loss of medieval stained glass, religious sculpture and paintings.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9/&gt; The nature of the Scottish Reformation may have had wider effects, limiting the creation of a culture of public display and meaning that art was channelled into more austere forms of expression with an emphasis on private and domestic restraint.&lt;ref&gt;N. Prior, ''Museums and Modernity: Art Galleries and the Making of Modern Culture'' (Oxford: Berg, 2002), {{ISBN|1859735088}}, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A self-portrait by George Jamesone.jpeg|thumb|left|Self portrait of [[George Jamesone]] (1642)]]
The loss of ecclesiastical patronage created a crisis for native craftsmen and artists, who turned to secular patrons. One result of this was the flourishing of [[Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings]] and walls, with large numbers of private houses of burgesses, lairds and lords gaining often highly detailed and coloured patterns and scenes, of which over a hundred examples survive. These include the ceiling at [[Prestongrange]], undertaken in 1581 for Mark Kerr, Commendator of Newbattle, and the long gallery at [[Pinkie House]], painted for [[Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline|Alexander Seaton]], Earl of Dunfermline in 1621. These were undertaken by unnamed Scottish artists using continental pattern books that often led to the incorporation of humanist moral and philosophical symbolism, with elements that call on heraldry, piety, classical myths and allegory.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9/&gt; The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much of the sixteenth century, but began to flourish after the Reformation. There were anonymous portraits of important individuals, including the Earl of Bothwell (1556) and George, fifth Earl of Seaton (c. 1570s).&lt;ref&gt;R. Tittler, "Portrait, politics and society", in R. Tittler and N. Jones, eds, ''A Companion to Tudor Britain'' (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008), {{ISBN|1-4051-3740-1}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;455–6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] employed two Flemish artists, [[Arnold Bronckorst]] in the early 1580s and [[Adrian Vanson]] from around 1584 to 1602, who have left us a visual record of the king and major figures at the court.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9/&gt;

The [[Union of Crowns]] in 1603 removed a major source of artistic patronage in Scotland as James VI and his court moved to London. The result has been seen as a shift "from crown to castle", as the nobility and local lairds became the major sources of patronage.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991p193"&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community'', p.&amp;nbsp;193.&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant native artist was [[George Jamesone]] of Aberdeen (1589/90-1644), who became one of the most successful portrait painters of the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and trained the Baroque artist [[John Michael Wright]] (1617–94).&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9&gt;A. Thomas, ''The Renaissance'', in Devine and Wormald, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'', pp.&amp;nbsp;198–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The growing importance of royal art can be seen in the post created in 1702 for George Ogilvie. The duties included "drawing pictures of our [the Monarch's] person or of our successors or others of our royal family for the decorment of our houses and palaces". However, from 1723 to 1823 the office was a [[sinecure]] held by members of the Abercrombie family, not necessarily connected with artistic ability.&lt;ref&gt;''The Laws of Scotland: Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia'', vol. 7 "The Crown", para 847.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Enlightenment period====
{{See also|Scottish Enlightenment}}
Many painters of the early part of the eighteenth century remained largely artisans, such as the members of the Norie family, James (1684–1757) and his sons, who painted the houses of the peerage with Scottish landscapes that were pastiches of Italian and Dutch landscapes.&lt;ref name=Baudino2011p153/&gt; The painters [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]] (1713–84), [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] (1723–98), the brothers [[John Runciman|John]] (1744–68/9) and [[Alexander Runciman]] (1736–85), [[Jacob More]] (1740–93) and [[David Allan (painter)|David Allan]] (1744–96), mostly began in the tradition of the Nories, but were artists of European significance, spending considerable portions of their careers outside Scotland, and were to varying degree influenced by forms of [[Neoclassicism]]. The influence of Italy was particularly significant, with over fifty Scottish artists and architects known to have travelled there in the period 1730–80.&lt;ref&gt;J. Wormald, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mFt2S33o8G8C&amp;pg=PT376&amp;dq=scottish+artists+italy&amp;hl=En&amp;ei=KQipT-rINemP4gTboeyOCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=scottish%20artists%20italy&amp;f=false ''Scotland: A History''] (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-19-162243-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramsay studied in Sweden, London and Italy before basing himself in Edinburgh, where he established himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility. After a second visit to Italy he moved to London in 1757 and from 1761 he was [[Principal Painter in Ordinary]] to [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. He now focused on royal portraits, often presented by the king to ambassadors and colonial governors. His work has been seen as anticipating the [[grand manner]] of [[Joshua Reynolds]], but many of his early portraits, particularly of women are less formal and more intimate studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/490799/Allan-Ramsay "Allan Ramsey"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', retrieved 7 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Gavin Hamilton studied at the [[University of Glasgow]] and in Rome, and after a brief stay in London, primarily painting portraits of the British aristocracy, he returned to Rome for the rest of his life. He emerged as a pioneering neo-classical painter of historical and mythical themes, including his depictions of scenes from Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'', as well as acting as an early archaeologist and antiquarian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/253404/Gavin-Hamilton "Gavin Hamilton"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', retrieved 7 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

John and Alexander Runciman both gained reputations as painters of mythological and historical themes. They travelled to Italy, where John died in 1768/9. Alexander returned home to gain a reputation as a landscape and portrait painter. His most widely known work, distributed in etchings, was mythological.&lt;ref name="Chilvers2009p554"&gt;I.

He produced historical and mythical scenes before moving to England, where he pursued portraiture. He then returned to Edinburgh in 1780, became director and master of the [[Academy of Arts]] in 1786. Here he produced his most famous work, with illustrations of themes from Scottish life, earning him the title of "the Scottish Hogarth".&lt;ref name="Houghton2003pp34-5"&gt;''The Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Biography'' (Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2003), {{ISBN|0-618-25210-X}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;34–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Romanticism====
{{See also|Romanticism in Scotland|Scottish genre art}}
Scotland played a major part in the origins of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] through the publication of [[James Macpherson]]'s [[Ossian]] cycle, which was proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] [[Epic poetry|epics]]. ''Fingal'', written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its deep appreciation of natural beauty and the melancholy tenderness of its treatment of the ancient legend did more than any single work to bring about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in [[German language|German]] literature, influencing [[Johann Gottfried von Herder|Herder]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Buchan ''Crowded with Genius'' (London: Harper Collins, 2003), {{ISBN|0-06-055888-1}}, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Ossian became a common subject for Scottish artists, and works were undertaken by Alexander Runciman and David Allan among others.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p554/&gt;&lt;ref name=Houghton2003pp34-5/&gt; This period saw a shift in attitudes to the Highlands and mountain landscapes in general, from viewing them as hostile, empty regions occupied by backwards and marginal people, to interpreting them as aesthetically pleasing exemplars of nature, occupied by rugged primitives, which were now depicted in a dramatic fashion.&lt;ref name="Withers2001pp151-3"&gt;C. W. J. Withers, ''Geography, Science and National Identity: Scotland Since 1520'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-521-64202-7}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;151–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Produced before his departure to Italy, Jacob More's series of four paintings "Falls of Clyde" (1771–73) have been described by art historian [[Duncan Macmillan (art historian)|Duncan Macmillan]] as treating the waterfalls as "a kind of natural national monument" and has been seen as an early work in developing a romantic sensibility to the Scottish landscape.&lt;ref name=Withers2001pp151-3/&gt; Alexander Runciman was probably the first artist to paint Scottish landscapes in watercolours in the more romantic style that was emerging towards the end of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;E. K. Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain, 1530 to 1790'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 5th edn., 1994), {{ISBN|0-300-05833-0}}, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nasmyth Alexander Highland Loch.jpg|thumb|right|''Highland Loch Landscape'' by [[Alexander Nasmyth]]]]
The effect of Romanticism can also be seen in the works of late eighteenth and early nineteenth-century artists including [[Henry Raeburn]] (1756–1823), [[Alexander Nasmyth]] (1758–1840) and John Knox (1778–1845). Raeburn was the most significant artist of the period to pursue his entire career in Scotland, born in Edinburgh and returning there after a trip to Italy in 1786. He is most famous for his intimate portraits of leading figures in Scottish life, going beyond the aristocracy to lawyers, doctors, professors, writers and ministers,&lt;ref name=Campbell2003pp142-3/&gt; adding elements of Romanticism to the tradition of Reynolds.&lt;ref&gt;C. C. Ochterbeck, ed., ''Michelin Green Guide: Great Britain Edition'' (London: Michelin, 5th edn., 2007), {{ISBN|1-906261-08-3}}, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a knight in 1822 and the King's [[painter and limner]] in 1823, marking a return to the post being associated with the production of art.&lt;ref name="Campbell2003pp142-3"&gt;D. Campbell, ''Edinburgh: A Cultural and Literary History'' (Oxford: Signal Books, 2003), {{ISBN|1-902669-73-8}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;142–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Nasmyth visited Italy and worked in London, but returned to his native Edinburgh for most of his career. He produced work in a large range of forms, including his portrait of Romantic poet Robert Burns, which depicts him against a dramatic Scottish background, but he is chiefly remembered for his landscapes and is described in the ''Oxford Dictionary of Art'' as "the founder of the Scottish landscape tradition".&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p433&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Knox continued the theme of landscape, directly linking it with the Romantic works of Scott&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Hill, ''Picturing Scotland Through the Waverley Novels: Walter Scott and the Origins of the Victorian Illustrated Novel'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2010), {{ISBN|0-7546-6806-1}}, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was also among the first artists to take a major interest in depicting the urban landscape of Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;D.

====Painting====
[[File:The Skating Minister.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[The Skating Minister|The Reverend Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch]], traditionally attributed to [[Henry Raeburn]] (1756–1823)]]
[[Andrew Geddes (artist)|Andrew Geddes]] (1783–1844) and [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]] (1785–1841) were among the most successful portrait painters, with Wilkie succeeding Raeburn as Royal Limner in 1823. Geddes produced some landscapes, but also portraits of Scottish subjects, including Wilkie and Scott, before he finally moved to London in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Geddes, Andrew |volume=11 |pages=547–548}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkie worked mainly in London, and was most famous for his anecdotal paintings of Scottish and English life, including ''[[The Chelsea Pensioners reading the Waterloo Dispatch]]'' in 1822 and for his flattering painting of the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] in [[Highland dress]] commemorating the royal visit to Scotland in 1823 that set off the international fashion for the kilt. After a tour of Europe he was more influenced by Renaissance and Baroque painting.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009pp678-9&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', pp.&amp;nbsp;678–9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] (1796–1864) became known for his prolific series of detailed [[lithograph]] prints of Egypt and the Near East that he produced during the 1840s from sketches he made during long tours of the region.&lt;ref&gt;C.

Jones, eds, ''Arab and Islamic Studies'' (American Univ in Cairo Press, 1997), {{ISBN|9774244028}}, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of highland landscape painting was continued by figures such as [[Horatio McCulloch]] (1806–67), [[Joseph Farquharson]] (1846–1935) and [[William McTaggart]] (1835–1910).&lt;ref name="Szasz200p136"&gt;F.

This was helped by [[Queen Victoria]]'s declared affection for Scotland, signified by her adoption of [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]] as a royal retreat. In this period a Scottish "grand tour" developed with large number of English artists, including [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]], flocking to the Highlands to paint and draw.&lt;ref name="Billcliffe2009p27"&gt;R. Billcliffe, ''The Glasgow Boys'' (London: Frances Lincoln, 2009), {{ISBN|0-7112-2906-6}}, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1870s Farquharson was a major figure in interpreting Scottish landscapes, specialising in snowscapes and sheep, and using a mobile heated studio in order to capture the conditions from life.&lt;ref name=Szasz200p136/&gt; In the same period McTaggart emerged as the leading Scottish landscape painter. He has been compared with [[John Constable]] and described as the "Scottish Impressionist", with free brushwork often depicting stormy seas and moving clouds.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p376&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; The fashion for coastal painting in the later nineteenth century led to the establishment of artist colonies in places such as [[Pittenweem]] and [[Crail]] in Fife,&lt;ref&gt;P.

====Sculpture====
{{Main article|Sculpture in Scotland}}
[[File:Alexander &amp; Bucephalus by John Steell.JPG|thumb|right|Alexander and Bucephalus by [[John Steell]] (1832)]]
In the early decades of the century, sculpture commissions in Scotland were often given to English artists. Thomas Campbell (c. 1790 – 1858) and [[Lawrence Macdonald]] (1799–1878) undertook work in Scotland, but worked for much of their careers in London and Rome.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, pp. 90–1.&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant Scottish sculptor to pursue their career in Scotland was [[John Steell]] (1804–91). His first work to gain significant public attention was his ''Alexander and Bucephasus'' (1832). His 1832 design for a statue of [[Walter Scott]] was incorporated into the author's memorial in Edinburgh. It marked the beginnings of a national school of sculpture based around major figures from Scottish culture and Scottish and British history. The tradition of Scottish sculpture was taken forward by artists such as Patrick Park (1811–55), [[Alexander Handyside Ritchie]] (1804–70) and [[William Calder Marshall]] (1813–94). This reached fruition in the next generation of sculptors including [[William Brodie]] (1815–81), Amelia Hill (1820–1904) and Steell's apprentice David Watson Stevenson (1842–1904). Stevenson contributed the statue of [[William Wallace]] to the exterior of the [[Wallace Monument]] and many of the busts in the gallery of heroes inside. Public sculpture was boosted by the anniversary of Burns' death in 1896. Stevenson produced a statue of the poet in [[Leith]]. Hill produced one for Dumfries. John Steell produced a statue for [[Central Park]] in New York, versions of which were made for [[Dundee]], London and [[Dunedin]]. Statues of Burns and Scott were produced in areas of Scottish settlement, particularly in North America and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 125–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early photography====
{{Main article|Scottish photography}}
[[File:His Faither’s Breeks.jpg|left|thumb|upright|'His Faither's Breeks', by [[Hill &amp; Adamson]]]]
In the early nineteenth century Scottish scientists [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[David Brewster]] played a major part in the development of the techniques of photography. Pioneering photographers included chemist [[Robert Adamson (photographer)|Robert Adamson]] (1821–48) and artist [[David Octavius Hill]] (1821–48), who as [[Hill &amp; Adamson]] formed the first photographic studio in Scotland at Rock House in Edinburgh in 1843. Their output of around 3,000 [[calotype]] images in four years are considered some of the first and finest artistic uses of photography. Other pioneers included [[Thomas Annan]] (1829–87), who took portraits and landscapes, and whose photographs of the Glasgow slums were among the first to use the medium as a social record.&lt;ref name="Burn2011"&gt;D. Burn, "Photography", in M. Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0199693056}}, pp. 476–7.&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[James Craig Annan]] (1864–1946) popularised the work of Hill &amp; Adamson in the US and worked with American photographic pioneer [[Alfred Stieglitz]] (1864–1946). Both pioneered the more stable [[photogravure]] process.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 146–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Other important figures included [[Thomas Keith (doctor)|Thomas Keith]] (1827–95), one of the first architectural photographers,&lt;ref&gt;H. Gernsheim, ''Creative Photography: Aesthetic Trends, 1839–1960'' (Mineola, NY: Courier Dover, 1962), {{ISBN|0486267504}}, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Washington Wilson]] (1823–93), who pioneered [[instant photography]]&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt; and [[Clementina Hawarden]] (1822–65), whose posed portraits were among the first in a tradition of female photography.&lt;ref&gt;G. Clarke, ''The Photograph'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0192842005}}, pp. 51–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Influence of the Pre-Raphaelites====
{{See also|Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood}}
[[David Scott (painter)|David Scott]]'s (1806–49) most ambitious historical work was the [[triptych]] ''Sir William Wallace, Scottish Wars: the Spear and English War: the Bow'' (1843). He also produced etchings for versions of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s ''[[Ancient Mariner]]'', [[John Bunyan|Bunyan]]'s ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'' and [[J. P. Nichol]]'s ''Architecture of the Heavens'' (1850). Because of this early death he was known to, and admired by, the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood mainly through his brother [[William Bell Scott]] (1811–90), who became a close friend of founding member [[D. G. Rossetti]]. The London-based Pre-Raphaelites rejected the formalism of [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] painting after [[Raphael]]. Bell Scott was patronised by the Pre-Raphaelite collector James Leathart. His most famous work, ''Iron and Coal'' was one of the most popular Victorian images and one of the few to fulfill the Pre-Raphaelite ambition to depict the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art 1460–1990'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, pp. 205–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Dyce 002.jpg|thumb|right|''[[William Dyce]] [[Pegwell Bay, Kent – a Recollection of October 5th 1858]]'' (1858–60?)]]
The figure in Scottish art most associated with the Pre-Raphaelites was the Aberdeen-born [[William Dyce]] (1806–64). Dyce befriended the young Pre-Raphaelites in London and introduced their work to [[John Ruskin]].&lt;ref name="Macmillan, p. 348"&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''The Man of Sorrows'' and ''David in the Wilderness'' (both 1860), contain a Pre-Raphaelite attention to detail, but puts the biblical subjects in a distinctly Scottish landscape, against the Pre-Raphaelite precept of truth in all things. His ''Pegwell Bay: a Recollection of October 5th 1858'' has been described as "the archetypal pre-Raphaelite landscape".&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Dyce became head of the School of Design in Edinburgh, and was then invited to London, to head the newly established Government School of Design, later to become the [[Royal College of Art]], where his ideas formed the basis of the system of training and he was highly involved in the national organisation of art.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p209&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Noel Paton]] (1821–1901) studied at the Royal Academy schools in London, where he became a friend of [[John Everett Millais]] and he subsequently followed him into Pre-Raphaelitism, producing pictures that stressed detail and melodrama such as ''The Bludie Tryst'' (1855).&lt;ref name="Macmillan"&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Also influenced by Millias was [[James Archer (artist)|James Archer]] (1823–1904) and whose work included ''Summertime, Gloucestershire'' (1860)&lt;ref name="Macmillan" /&gt; and who from 1861 began a series of [[Arthurian]]-based paintings including ''La Morte d'Arthur'' and ''Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere''.&lt;ref&gt;R.

====Arts and Crafts and the Celtic Revival====
{{See also|Arts and Crafts movement|Celtic Revival}}
The beginnings of the Arts and Crafts movement in Scotland were in the stained glass revival of the 1850s, pioneered by [[James Ballantine]] (1808–77). His major works included the great west window of [[Dunfermline Abbey]] and the scheme for [[St. Giles Cathedral]], Edinburgh. In Glasgow it was pioneered by [[Daniel Cottier]] (1838–91), who had probably studied with Ballantine, and was directly influenced by [[William Morris]], [[Ford Madox Brown]] and [[John Ruskin]]. His key works included the ''Baptism of Christ'' in [[Paisley Abbey]] (c. 1880). His followers included Stephen Adam and his son of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The Glasgow-born designer and theorist [[Christopher Dresser]] (1834–1904) was one of the first and most important, independent designers, a pivotal figure in the [[Aesthetic Movement]] and a major contributor to the allied [[Anglo-Japanese]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;H. Lyons, ''Christopher Dresser: the People's Designer – 1834–1904'' (Woodbridge: Antique Collectors' Club, 2005), {{ISBN|1851494553}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reptilian Fabric.jpg|thumb|left|Textile pattern by [[Christopher Dresser]] (1887)]]
The formation of the Edinburgh Social Union in 1885, which included a number of significant figures in the Arts and Craft and Aesthetic movements, became part of an attempt to facilitate a [[Celtic Revival]], similar to that taking place in contemporaneous Ireland, drawing on ancient myths and history to produce art in a modern idiom.&lt;ref name="Gardiner2005p170"&gt;M. Gardiner, ''Modern Scottish Culture'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-7486-2027-3}}, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Key figures were the philosopher, sociologist, town planner and writer [[Patrick Geddes]] (1854–1932), the architect and designer [[Robert Lorimer]] (1864–1929) and stained-glass artist [[Douglas Strachan]] (1875–1950). Geddes established an informal college of tenement flats for artists at [[Ramsay Garden]] on Castle Hill in Edinburgh in the 1890s.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p155-6&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 155–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the figures involved with the movement were [[Anna Traquair]] (1852–1936), who was commissioned by the Union to paint murals in the Mortuary Chapel of the [[Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh|Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh]] (1885–86 and 1896–98) and also worked in metal, illumination, illustration, embroidery and book binding. The most significant exponent was Dundee-born [[John Duncan (painter)|John Duncan]] (1866–1945), who was also influenced by [[Italian Renaissance art]] and French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. Among his most influential works are his paintings of Celtic subjects ''Tristan and Iseult'' (1912) and ''St Bride'' (1913). Other Dundee Symbolists included Stewart Carmichael (1879–1901) and George Dutch Davidson (1869–1950).&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p155-6/&gt; Duncan was a major contributor to Geddes' magazine ''The Evergreen''. Other major contributors included the Japanese-influenced [[Robert Burns (artist)|Robert Burns]] (1860–1941), [[Edward Atkinson Hornel|E. A. Hornel]] (1864–1933) and Duncan's student Helen Hay (fl. 1895–1953).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 156–7.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

====Glasgow School====
{{Main article|Glasgow School}}
[[File:Frances Macdonald, Sleeping Princess.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Sleeping Princess'', by [[Frances Macdonald]] (1909)]]
For the late nineteenth century developments in Scottish art are associated with the Glasgow School, a term that is used for a number of loose groups based around the city. The first and largest group, active from about 1880, were the [[Glasgow Boys]], including [[James Guthrie (artist)|James Guthrie]] (1859–1930), [[Joseph Crawhall]] (1861–1913), [[George Henry (painter)|George Henry]] (1858–1943) and [[Edward Arthur Walton|E. A. Walton]] (1860–1922).&lt;ref name="Billcliffe2009"&gt;R. Billcliffe, ''The Glasgow Boys'' (London: Frances Lincoln, 2009), {{ISBN|0-7112-2906-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They reacted against the commercialism and sentimentality of earlier artists, particularly represented by the Royal Academy, were often influenced by French painting and incorporated elements of [[impressionism]] and [[Realism (art)|realism]], and have been credited with rejuvenating Scottish art, making Glasgow a major cultural centre.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p255&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; A slightly later grouping, active from about 1890 and known as "The Four" or the "Spook School", was composed of acclaimed architect [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] (1868–1928), his wife the painter and [[Studio glass|glass artist]] [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald]] (1865–1933), her sister the artist [[Frances MacDonald|Frances]] (1873–1921), and her husband, the artist and teacher [[Herbert MacNair]] (1868–1955). They produced a distinctive blend of influences, including the Celtic Revival, the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], and [[Japonisme]], which found favour throughout the [[modern art]] world of continental Europe and helped define the [[Art Nouveau]] style.&lt;ref&gt;S. Tschudi-Madsen, ''The Art Nouveau Style: a Comprehensive Guide'' (Mineola, NY: Courier Dover, 2002), {{ISBN|0-486-41794-8}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;283–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scottish Colourists====
{{Main article|Scottish Colourists}}
The next significant group of artists to emerge were the Scottish Colourists in the 1920s. The name was later given to four artists who knew each other and exhibited together, but did not form a cohesive group. All had spent time in France between 1900 and 1914&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p575&gt;Chilvers, ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 575.&lt;/ref&gt; and all looked to Paris, particularly to the [[Fauvism|Fauvists]], such as [[Monet]], [[Matisse]] and [[Cézanne]], whose techniques they combined with the painting traditions of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author= |contribution= |date= |title=The Scottish Colourists |journal=Explore Art |editor= |edition= |isbn= |issn= |volume= |pages= |place= |publisher= |url=http://www.exploreart.co.uk/results.asp?SF1=art_style&amp;ST1=The%20Scottish%20Colourists&amp;SORT=sort_name |accessdate=12 November 2012 |authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were [[John Duncan Fergusson]] (1874–1961), [[Francis Cadell (artist)|Francis Cadell]] (1883–1937), [[Samuel Peploe]] (1871–1935) and [[George Hunter (painter)|Leslie Hunter]] (1877–1931).&lt;ref name="visit"&gt;{{Citation |author= |contribution= |date=|title=The Scottish Colourists |journal=Visit Scotland.com |editor= |edition= |isbn= |issn= |volume= |pages= |place= |publisher= |url=http://www.visitscotland.com/repository/library/932636/1000635/colourists |accessdate=7 May 2010 |authorlink= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429020605/http://www.visitscotland.com/repository/library/932636/1000635/colourists |archivedate=29 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been described as the first Scottish modern artists and were the major mechanism by which post-impressionism reached Scotland.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p575/&gt;

====Edinburgh School====
{{Main article|The Edinburgh School}}
The group of artists connected with Edinburgh, most of whom had studied at Edinburgh College of Art during or soon after the First World War, became known as the Edinburgh School.&lt;ref name="EdinburghGalleriesEdinbrughSchool"&gt;[http://www.edinburghmuseums.org.uk/Venues/City-Art-Centre/Collections/Fine-Art/Scottish-Art-Movements/The-Edinburgh-School "The Edinburgh School"], Edinburgh Museums and Galleries, retrieved 10 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; They were influenced by French painters and the [[St. Ives School]]&lt;ref name="Macmillan2011pp153-4"&gt;D.

====Modernism and the Scottish Renaissance====
{{See also|Modernism|Scottish Renaissance}}
[[File:Cursiter, The Regatta.jpg|thumb|right|[[Stanley Cursiter]] ''The Regatta'' (1913)]]
Patrick Geddes coined the phrase Scottish Renaissance, arguing that technological development needed to paralleled in the arts. This ideas were taken up by a new generation, led by the poet [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] who argued for a synergy between science and art, the introduction of modernism into art and the creation of a distinctive national art. These ideas were expressed in art in the inter-war period by figures including J. D. Fergusson, [[Stanley Cursiter]] (1887–1976), [[William McCance]] (1894–1970) and [[William Johnstone (artist)|William Johnstone]] (1897–1981).&lt;ref name="Macmillan, p. 348"/&gt; Fergusson was one of the few British artists who could claim to have played a part in the creation of modernism. His interest in machine imagery can be seen in paintings such as ''Damaged Destroyer'' (1918).&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt; Cursiter was influenced by the Celtic revival, post-impressionism and [[futurism (art)|Futurism]], as can be seen in his ''Rain on Princess Street'' (1913) and ''Regatta'' (1913).&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p173/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 163–4.&lt;/ref&gt; McCance's early work was in a bold post-impressionist style, but after World War I it became increasingly abstract and influenced by vorticism, as can be seen in ''Women on an Elevator'' (1925) and ''The Engineer and his Wife'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 348–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnstone studied cubism, surrealism and new American art. He moved towards [[Abstract art|abstraction]], attempting to utilise aspects of landscape, poetry and Celtic art. His most significant work, ''A Point in Time'' (1929–38), has been described by art historian Duncan Macmillan as "one of the most important Scottish pictures of the century".&lt;ref name="Gardiner2005p173"&gt;M. Gardiner, ''Modern Scottish Culture'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-7486-2027-3}}, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 351–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, [http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/scotland/review-painters-in-parallel-william-johnstone-william-gillies-1-2063707 "Review: Painters in Parallel: William Johnstone &amp; William Gillies"], ''Scotsman.com'', 19 January 2012, retrieved 8 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artists strongly influenced by modernism included [[James McIntosh Patrick]] (1907–98) and [[Edward Baird (artist)|Edward Baird]] (1904–49).&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p173/&gt; Both trained in Glasgow, but spent most of their careers in and around their respective native cities of Dundee and [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]]. Both were influenced by surrealism and the work of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]] and focused on landscape, as can be seen in McIntosh Patrick's ''Traquair House'' (1938) and more overtly in Baird's ''The Birth of Venus'' (1934). Before his success in painting McIntosh Patrick first gained a reputation as an etcher. Leading figures in the field in the inter-war period included [[William Wilson (artist)|William Wilson]] (1905–72) and Ian Fleming (1906–94).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 175–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Scottish Group====
{{Main article|New Scottish Group}}
[[File:JD Fergusson, People and Sails.jpg|thumb|left|[[J. D. Fergusson]], ''People and Sails'' (1910)]]
The longest surviving member of the Scottish Colourists, J. D. Fergusson, returned to Scotland from France in 1939, just before the outbreak of the Second World War, where he became a leading figure of a group of Glasgow artists. Members of Fergusson's group formed the New Art Club in 1940, in opposition to the established Glasgow Art Club. In 1942 they held the first exhibition of their own exhibiting society, the New Scottish Group, with Fergusson as its first president.&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art in the 20th Century, 1890–2001'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 2001), {{ISBN|1840184574}}, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group had no single style, but shared left-wing tendencies and included artists strongly influenced by trends in contemporary continental art. Painters involved included Donald Bain (1904–79), who was influenced by [[expressionism]]. William Crosbie (1915–99) was strongly influenced by surrealism. Marie de Banzie (1918–90), was influenced by expressionism and particularity [[post-expressionism|post-expressionist]] [[Gauguin]]. Isabel Babianska (born 1920), was influenced by expressionist [[Chaim Soutine]]. Expressionism can also be seen as an influence on the work of Millie Frood (1900–88), which included vivid colours and brushwork reminiscent of [[Van Gogh]]. Frood's urban scenes contain an element of social commentary and realism, influenced by Polish refugees [[Josef Herman]] (1911–2000), resident in Glasgow between 1940 and 1943&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990pp370-1&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 370–1.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jankel Adler]] (1895–1949) who was in Kirkudbright from 1941 to 1943.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Also influenced by Herman were husband and wife Tom MacDonald (1914–85) and Bet Low (born 1924), who with painter William Senior (born 1927) formed the Clyde Group, aimed at promoting political art. Their work included industrial and urban landscapes such as MacDonald's ''Transport Depot'' (1944–45) and Bet Low's ''Blochairn Steelworks'' (c. 1946).&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990pp370-1/&gt;{{clear}}

[[File:NewtonBlakePaolozzi1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eduardo Paolozzi]]'s 1995 sculpture ''[[Newton (Paolozzi)|Newton]]'', based on [[William Blake]]'s 1795 print ''[[Newton (Blake)|Newton]]'']]
Notable post-war artists included [[Robin Philipson]] (1916–92), who was influenced by the Colourists, but also [[Pop Art]] and [[neo-Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 189–90.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert MacBryde]] (1913–66), [[Robert Colquhoun]] (1914–64) and [[Joan Eardley]] (1921–63), were all graduates of the Glasgow School of Art. MacBryde and Colquhoun were influenced by neo-Romanticism and the Cubism of Adler. The English-born Eardley moved to Glasgow and explored the landscapes of Kincardineshire coast and created depictions of Glasgow tenements and children in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 191–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish artists that continued the tradition of landscape painting and joined the new generation of modernist artists of the highly influential St Ives School were [[Wilhelmina Barns-Graham]] (b. 1912–2004), [[Margaret Mellis]] (b. 1914–2009).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paris continued to be a major destination for Scottish artists, with [[William Gear]] (1916–97) and [[Stephen Gilbert]] (1910–2007) encountering the linear abstract painting of the avant-garde [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]] group there in the 1940s. Their work was highly coloured and violent in execution.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; Also a visitor to Paris was [[Alan Davie]] (born 1920),&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; who was influenced by jazz and [[Zen Buddhism]] and moved further into [[abstract expressionism]].&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p173/&gt; [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]]'s (1925–2006) work explored the boundaries between sculpture, print making, literature (especially [[concrete poetry]]) and [[landscape architecture]]. His most ambitious work, the garden of [[Little Sparta]] opened in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=K.

===Scottish Realism and the Glasgow Pups===
[[File:"The Big Heids" - geograph.org.uk - 617712.jpg|thumb|left|[[David Mach]]'s ''Big Heids'', Lanarkshire, a tribute to the steel industry]]
[[John Bellany]] (1942–2013), mainly focusing on the coastal communities of his birth, and Alexander Moffat (born 1943), who concentrated on portraiture, both grouped under the description of "Scottish realism", were among the leading Scottish intellectuals from the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;C. Richardson, ''Scottish Art Since 1960: Historical Reflections and Contemporary Overviews'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2011), {{ISBN|0-7546-6124-5}}, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The artists associated with Moffat and the [[Glasgow School of Art]] who came to prominence in the 1980s are sometimes known as the "new Glasgow Boys", or "Glasgow pups"&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p255/&gt; and included [[Steven Campbell (artist)|Steven Campbell]] (1953–2007), [[Peter Howson]] (born 1958), [[Ken Currie]] (born 1960) and Adrian Wiszniewski (born 1958). Their [[Figurative art|figurative]] work has a comic book-like quality and puts an emphasis on social commentary.&lt;ref&gt;D. Reid, ''The Rough Guide to Edinburgh'' (London: Rough Guides, 3rd edn., 2002), {{ISBN|1-85828-887-8}}, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell and Wiszniewski's [[post-modernism|post-modern]] painting adopts a whimsical approach to history. Campbell often employs figures reminiscent characters from 1930s novels confronted by the disorder and confusion of the real world, as in his ''Young Men in Search of Simplicity'' (1989).&lt;ref name="Macmillan2011"&gt;D. Macmillan, "Culture: modern times 1914–", in M. Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0199693056}}, p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt; Currie has revived historical painting devoted to the socialist history of Glasgow in a series of paintings for the [[People's Palace, Glasgow|People's Palace]] in 1987. Currie also approached the problems of historical painting through his series of prints ''The Saracen Heads'' (1988).&lt;ref name=Macmillan2011p406&gt;Macmillan, "Culture: modern times 1914–", p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary sculpture===
While sculptors [[Eric Schilsky]] (1898–1974) and [[Hew Lorimer]] (1907–93) worked in the existing tradition of modelling and carving,&lt;ref name=Macmillan2011/&gt; sculptor and artist [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] (1924–2005) was a pioneer of pop art and in a varied career produced many works that examined juxtapositions between fantasy and the modern world.&lt;ref name="Roseetal2012p25"&gt;L.

MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;
New sources of direct government arts funding encouraged greater experimentation among a new generation of sculptors that incorporated aspects of modernism, including Jake Harvey (born 1948), Doug Cocker (born 1945), Ainslie Yule (born 1941) and Gavin Scobie (1940–2012).&lt;ref name=Macmillan2011/&gt; In contrast [[Sandy Stoddart]] (born 1959) works primarily on "nationalist" figurative sculpture in clay within the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical tradition]]. He is best known for his civic monuments, including {{convert|10|ft|m}} bronze statues of the philosophers [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]], on the [[Royal Mile]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;Clive Aslet, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3556356/Alexander-Stoddart-talking-statues.html "Alexander Stoddart: talking statues"] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', retrieved 12 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:sandy smith object moved edinburgh.jpg|thumb|The first room of the installation ''The Object Moved by its Own Success'', by [[Sandy Smith]] and [[Alex Gross]] (2008)]]
In the late twentieth century, photography in Scotland enjoyed a renaissance, encouraged by figures including Richard Hough (1945–85) who founded the Stills Gallery for photography in Edinburgh in 1977 and Murray Johnston (1949–90), who was its director (1982–86).&lt;ref&gt;C.

===Contemporary artists===
Since the 1990s, the most commercially successful artist has been [[Jack Vettriano]] (born 1951), whose work usually consists of figure compositions, with his most famous painting ''[[The Singing Butler]]'' (1992), often cited as the best selling print in Britain. However, he has received little acclaim from critics.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p657&gt;Chilvers ''Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 657.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary artists emerging from Glasgow and Dundee include [[David Mach]] (born 1960), working in the medium of [[installation art]],&lt;ref&gt;P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7969">In [[reflection seismology]], a '''seismic attribute''' is a quantity extracted or derived from [[seismic data]] that can be analysed in order to enhance information that might be more subtle in a traditional seismic image, leading to a better [[geology | geological]] or [[geophysics | geophysical]] interpretation of the data.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.software.slb.com/products/petrel/petrel-geophysics/multitrace-attribute Schlumberger Seismic Attribute Analysis&lt;/ref&gt;  
Examples of seismic attributes can include measured time, [[amplitude]], [[frequency]] and [[attenuation]], in addition to combinations of these.  Most seismic attributes are [[Post-stack (seismology)|post-stack]], but those that use [[CMP gathers]], such as [[amplitude versus offset]] (AVO), must be analysed [[Pre-stack (seismology)|pre-stack]].&lt;ref&gt;Young, R. &amp; LoPiccolo, R. 2005. AVO analysis demystified. E&amp;P. http://www.e-seis.com/white_papers/AVO%20Analysis%20Demystified.pdf{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They can be measured along a single seismic trace or across multiple traces within a defined window. 

The first attributes developed were related to the 1D [[seismic trace|complex seismic trace]] and included: [[envelope amplitude]], [[instantaneous phase]], [[instantaneous frequency]], and [[apparent polarity]]. [[Acoustic impedance]] obtained from [[seismic inversion]] can also be considered an attribute and was among the first developed.&lt;ref name=Sheriff&gt;{{cite book|first=R.E.|last=Sheriff|title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Applied Geophysics|year=2002|edition=4|publisher=[[Society of Exploration Geophysicists]]|isbn=1-56080-118-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other attributes commonly used include: [[Coherence (signal processing)|coherence]], [[azimuth]], [[Dip (geology)|dip]], [[instantaneous amplitude]], [[response amplitude]], [[response phase]], [[instantaneous bandwidth]], [[Amplitude versus offset|AVO]], and [[spectral decomposition]].

A seismic attribute that can indicate the presence or absence of [[hydrocarbon]]s is known as a [[direct hydrocarbon indicator]].

==Amplitude attributes==
Amplitude attributes use the seismic signal amplitude as the basis for their computation.

===Mean amplitude===
A post-stack attribute that computes the arithmetic mean of the amplitudes of a trace within a specified window. This can be used to observe the trace bias which could indicate the presence of a [[bright spot]].

===Average Energy===
A post-stack attribute that computes the sum of the squared amplitudes divided by the number of samples within the specified window used. This provides a measure of reflectivity and allows one to map direct hydrocarbon indicators within a zone of interest.

===RMS (root mean square) amplitude===

A post-stack attribute that computes the square root of the sum of squared amplitudes divided by the number of samples within the specified window used. With this [[root mean square amplitude]], one can measure reflectivity in order to map direct hydrocarbon indicators in a zone of interest. However, RMS is sensitive to noise as it squares every value within the window.

===Maximum magnitude===
A post-stack attribute that computes the maximum value of the absolute value of the amplitudes within a window. This can be used to map the strongest direct hydrocarbon indicator within a zone of interest.

===AVO attributes===
[[Amplitude versus offset|AVO (amplitude versus offset)]] attributes are pre-stack attributes that have as the basis for their computation, the variation in amplitude of a seismic reflection with varying offset. These attributes include: AVO intercept, AVO gradient, intercept multiplied by gradient, far minus near, fluid factor, etc.&lt;ref name=Castagna&gt;{{cite book|first1=J.P.|last1=Castagna|first2=M.M.|last2=Backus|title=Offset Dependent Reflectivity - Theory and Practice of AVO Analysis|year=1993|publisher=[[Society of Exploration Geophysicists]]|isbn=1-56080-059-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anelastic attenuation factor===
The [[anelastic attenuation factor]] (or Q) is a seismic attribute that can be determined from seismic reflection data for both [[petroleum reservoir | reservoir]] characterisation and advanced [[seismic processing]].

==Time/Horizon attributes==

===Coherence===
A post-stack attribute that measures the continuity between seismic traces in a specified window along a picked horizon. It can be used to map the lateral extent of a formation. It can also be used to see faults, channels or other discontinuous features.

Although it should be used along a specified horizon, many software packages compute this attribute along arbitrary time-slices.

===Dip===
A post-stack attribute that computes, for each trace, the best fit plane (3D) or line (2D) between its immediate neighbor traces on a horizon and outputs the magnitude of [[Strike and dip|dip (gradient)]] of said plane or line measured in degrees. This can be used to create a pseudo paleogeologic map on a horizon slice.

===Azimuth===
A post-stack attribute that computes, for each trace, the best fit plane (3D) between its immediate neighbor traces on a horizon and outputs the direction of maximum slope (dip direction) measured in degrees, clockwise from north. This is not to be confused with the geological concept of azimuth, which is equivalent to [[Strike and dip|strike]] and is measured 90° counterclockwise from the dip direction.

===Curvature===
A group of post-stack attributes that are computed from the [[curvature]] of a specified horizon. These attributes include: magnitude or direction of maximum curvature, magnitude or direction of minimum curvature, magnitude of curvature along the horizon's azimuth (dip) direction, magnitude of curvature along the horizon's strike direction, magnitude of curvature of a contour line along a horizon.

==Frequency attributes==
These attributes involve separating and classifying seismic events within each trace based on their frequency content. The application of these attributes is commonly called '''spectral decomposition'''. The starting point of spectral decomposition is to decompose each 1D trace from the time domain into its corresponding [[time-frequency representation|2D representation in the time-frequency domain]] by means of any method of time-frequency decomposition such as: [[short-time Fourier transform]], [[continuous wavelet transform]], [[Wigner-Ville distribution]], [[matching pursuit]], among many others. Once each trace has been transformed into the time-frequency domain, a [[bandpass filter]] can be applied to view the amplitudes of seismic data at any frequency or range of frequencies.

Technically, each individual frequency or band of frequencies could be considered an attribute. The seismic data is usually filtered at various frequency ranges in order to show certain geological patterns that may not be obvious in the other frequency bands. There is an inverse relationship between the thickness of a rock layer and the corresponding peak frequency of its seismic reflection. That is, thinner rock layers are much more apparent at higher frequencies and thicker rock layers are much more apparent at lower frequencies. This can be used to qualitatively identify thinning or thickening of a rock unit in different directions.

Spectral decomposition has also been widely used as a direct hydrocarbon indicator.

'''Semantic analysis (computational)''' is a composite of the "[[Semantic analysis (linguistics)|semantic analysis]]" and the "computational" components.

"Semantic analysis" refers to a formal analysis of meaning, and "computational" refer to approaches that in principle support effective implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, P., and Bos, J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11877">The '''sociology of Jewry''' involves the application of [[sociological theory]] and method to the study of the [[Jews|Jewish people]] and the [[Judaism|Jewish religion]]. [[Sociologists]] are concerned with the social patterns within Jewish groups and communities; [[American Jewry]], [[Israeli Jews]] and Jewish life in the [[diaspora]]. Sociological studies of the Jewish religion include religious membership, ritual and denominational patterns. Notable journals include ''[[Jewish Social Studies]]'', ''[[The Jewish Journal of Sociology]]'' and ''[[Contemporary Jewry]].

==Emergence of the discipline==

===Beginnings: 1930s-1950s===
Sociology of Jewry initially emerged in the United States in the 1930s beginning with the 1938 publication of ''Jewish Social Studies'', sponsored by the Conference of Jewish Relations. The Journal's mission was "to promote, by means of scientific research, a better understanding of the position of Jews in the modern world." And the later publication of ''The Jewish Journal of Sociology'' in 1958 was due to the "few opportunities... for publishing academic and scientific studies of the sociology of Jews."&lt;ref name=Heilman1982&gt;Heilman, Samuel C. "The sociology of American Jewry: The last ten years." ''Annual Review of Sociology'' 8, no. 1 (1982): 135-160.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth and development: 1950s-present===
In 1955, sociologist [[Seymour Lipset]] noted that the discipline was underdeveloped, stating that there were far more "Jewish sociologists" than "sociologists of Jews".&lt;ref&gt;Lipset, Seymour. "Jewish Sociologists and Sociologists of the Jews." ''Jewish Social Studies'' (1955): 177-178.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the subfield began to grow in the late 1960s and 1970s. A professional organization was formed, namely the [[Association for the Social Scientific Study of Jewry]] (ASSJ). In 1975, a new academic journal was founded as well, ''[[Contemporary Jewry]]''.

Contributing to this growth was the work of [[Marshall Sklare]], now considered one of the founding figures in the sociology of Jewry.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Jack Nusan. "The Sociology of Jewry: Blueprints for the future from contemporary designs." ''Contemporary Jewry'' 4, no. 1 (1977): 24-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall Sklare and [[Joseph Greenblum]]’s 1967 study of Jewish identity in “Lakeville” is considered one of the most notable works of its kind. The sociological study of intergroup relations and the theories proposed by [[Nathan Glazer]] and [[Daniel P. Moynihan]] is also thought to have contributed to the growth of the sociology of Jewry.&lt;ref&gt;Dashefsky, Arnold, Bernard Lazerwitz, and Ephraim Tabory.

Accessed May 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Formation of the ASSJ====
The idea for the formation of a professional organization for scholars specializing in the sociology of Jewry first surfaced in 1966; the concept was discussed by [[Werner J. Cahnman]] and [[Norman L. Friedman]] at an American Sociological Association (ASA) conference.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman L. "Conception and Birth of the Association for the Sociological Study of Jewry," ''Ethnic Forum'' 6 (1986): 98-111.&lt;/ref&gt; The association was informally launched by Norman Friedman and [[Bernard Lazerwitz]] in 1970; the event, titled "The Sociological Study of Jewry" took place at the ASA annual conference. Sociologists [[Solomon Poll]], [[Mervin Verbit]] and [[Arnold Dashevsky]] submitted a motion to establish a formal group; the motion was voted upon and accepted. The new group, the [[Association for the Social Scientific Study of Jewry]] (ASSJ or ASSSJ) was launched and formally met the following year. The group has since organized annual conferences, established the academic journal ''Contemporary Jewry'', founded the ''ASSJ Newsletter'' and honors exceptional scholars in the field with the [[Marshall Sklare Award]].&lt;ref name=waxmanassj&gt;Waxman, Chaim I."[https://books.google.com/books?id=0s_QAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=sociology+of+Jewry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lGnh34psjS&amp;sig=IpTbg8GEyHoMQJ3zw210i3-JDro&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5N9sU9vRGMe2yASH5YGoAw&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwCA The Professional Dilemma of Jewish Social Scientists: The Case of the ASSJ]."

Swatos, Jr. Hartford Institute for Religion Research. Accessed May 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the ASSJ and ''Contemporary Jewry'' are dominated by sociologists and sociological studies - all but one of the organization's presidents earned a doctorate in sociology, the other received a doctorate in psychology&lt;ref name=Blasi/&gt; - the focus has not been restricted to sociology alone. Studies involving other social sciences and history are included as well, and professionals from those disciplines have joined as members, contributors and honorees.&lt;ref name=waxmanassj/&gt;

==General theories==

===American Jewry===
According to sociologist [[Samuel Heilman]], there are three major theoretical approaches in studying the sociology of American Jewry in particular:
*''Uniqueness of Judaism'' and ''Particularism vs. Universalism'' - a popular theoretical approach towards understanding contemporary American Jewry has been the notion that more than anything else Judaism as a religion accounts for the social situation of U.S. Jews today.&lt;ref&gt;Sharot, Stephen. ''Judaism: A Sociology.'' Newton Abbot: David &amp; Charles, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The current social and political decisions of the Jewish community are rooted in the response to the inevitable conflict between Jewish religious values on one hand, and secular American life on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Liebman, Charles S. ''The Ambivalent American Jew: Politics, religion and family in American Jewish life.'' Jewish publication society of America, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Milton Himmelfarb]], focus less on the Jewish religion per se and focus on the tension produced by balancing the particularism of the Jewish tradition vs. the universalism of American modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelfarb, Milton. ''The Jews of Modernity.'' New York, NY: Basic Books, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Marginal culture'' - in the 1940s and 1950s, some scholars, such as [[Milton M. Goldberg]], saw Jewish life in America as a successful "marginal culture," following the "[[marginal man theory]]" of [[Robert E. Park]] and [[Everett Stonequist]] popular at the time&lt;ref&gt;Bergmann, Werner, ed. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=N6W7oL3x1qAC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Error Without Trial: Psychological Research on Antisemitism].'' Vol. 2. Walter de Gruyter, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Community and organizations'' - a third approach stems from the work of political scientist [[Daniel J. Elazar]] and focuses and the underlying dynamics behind the decision making within Jewish community organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Elazar, Daniel Judah. ''Community and polity: The organizational dynamics of American Jewry.'' Jewish Publication Society, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

While other theoretical approaches have been advanced they have not majorly impacted the discipline's research agenda.&lt;ref name=Heilman1982/&gt;

==Applied sociology==
[[Samuel Klausner]], a former president of the ASSJ, noted that the sociology of Jewry is more an applied social science than a theoretical one. For Klausner, theories developed in sociology may help explain any society, not just a Jewish one. The contribution of the sociology of Jewry therefore is the application of the science, such as its methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Klausner, Samuel Z. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=TLSKRqkGMToC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=sociology+of+Jewry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RGjjdeUVLR&amp;sig=wI1-V_RSkJ3tQNEAZMCv6qNfqeM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GuBsU4_fO86wyASMg4LACw&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwATgK What is conceptually special about a sociology of Jewry]." ''Contemporary Anarchism''. Ed. Terry M. Perlin. Transaction Publishers. 1987. Accessed May 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, stress that the subfield is a part of general [[comparative sociology]].&lt;ref&gt;Zenner, Walter P. "American jewry in the light of middleman minority theories." Contemporary Jewry 5, no. 1 (1980): 11-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syllabi collections==

===1946 syllabus===
In 1946, [[Kurt H. Wolff]], a student of [[Karl Mannheim]], published “An Elementary Syllabus in the Sociology of the Jews” in ''[[Social Forces]]'', a notable sociology journal. Wolff's aim was to provide an aid to including material on Jews in courses on race relations, social disorganization, minorities, and/or introductory sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, Kurt H. "An Elementary Syllabus in the Sociology of the Jews." Social Forces (1946): 451-461.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolff's syllabus focused on three topics:
*Demographic changes following the aftermath of [[World War II]] and the [[holocaust]]
*The "ethnic identifiability" of Jews
*[[Antisemitism]]

Later scholars have noted that Wolff's syllabus on the Sociology of Jewry sought to study external structures but ignored the internal dynamics of the Jewish community.&lt;ref name=Burstein2007&gt;Burstein, Paul. "[http://www.overcominghateportal.org/uploads/5/4/1/5/5415260/sociology_of_jewry.pdf The Sociology of Jewry: Syllabi and Instructional Materials.]" ''ASA Resource Materials For Teaching''. American Sociological Association. Washington, DC. 2007. Accessed May 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1992 ASA syllabi collection===
In 1992, Rabbi [[Jack Nusan Porter]] edited the first syllabus collection and curriculum guide on the Sociology of Jewry. The collection was published by the [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA). The collection included individual syllabi on the sociology of Jews from 34 colleges and universities. However, Porter found that many of the syllabi focused exclusively on Jewish life in America. And only 10 out of 34 syllabi were from sociology departments.&lt;ref name=Burstein2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Jack N. 1998. The Sociology of Jewry: A Curriculum Guide. 2nd ed. Washington, DC: American Sociological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007 ASA syllabi collection===
[[Paul Burstein]] of the [[University of Washington]] compiled an updated collection of syllabi on the sociology of Jewry. This collection was published by the [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA) in 2007. In his work, Burstein focuses on the following themes:
*Comparative historical approach, examining changing and evolving patterns of Jewish life in the last few hundred years
*Jewish life in North America, though focusing mostly on the United States
*Jewish life in Israel
*The [[Holocaust]]

Burstein notes gaps in specific areas. For example, while Black-Jewish relations in the U.S. is covered in the syllabi, relations between Jews and other groups is not. Also, there are few areas covered outside of American and Israeli Jewry.&lt;ref name=Burstein2007/&gt;

'''Teleforce''' was a proposed defensive weapon by [[Nikola Tesla]] that accelerated pellets or slugs of material to a high velocity inside a vacuum chamber via [[electrostatic]] repulsion and then fired them out of aimed nozzles at intended targets.  Tesla claimed to have conceived of it after studying the [[Van de Graaff generator]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite news | title= Tesla's Ray |work=Time |date= 23 July 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seifer1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Seifer|first=Marc|title=Tesla's "Death Ray" Machine|url=http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/tesla/esp_tesla_2.htm|publisher=bibliotecapleyades.net|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla described the weapon as being able to be used against ground-based infantry or for anti-aircraft purposes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news | title= Beam to Kill Army at 200 Miles, Tesla's Claim on 78th Birthday |work=New York Times |date= 11 July 1934 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news | title= 'Death Ray' for Planes |work=New York Times |date= 22 September 1940 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Tesla described ''Teleforce'''s operation in 1934: &lt;blockquote&gt;My apparatus projects particles which may be relatively large or of microscopic dimensions, enabling us to convey to a small area at a great distance trillions of times more energy than is possible with rays of any kind. Many thousands of horsepower can thus be transmitted by a stream thinner than a hair, so that nothing can resist."&lt;ref name="AmtEW"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Machine to End War|url=https://www.pbs.org/tesla/res/res_art11.html|publisher=[[PBS]]|work=Tesla - Master of Lightning}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nozzle would send concentrated beams of particles through the free air, of such tremendous energy that they will bring down a fleet of 10,000 enemy airplanes at a distance of 200 miles from a defending nation's border and will cause armies to drop dead in their tracks.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a letter that was written to [[J. P. Morgan, Jr.]] on November 29, 1934, Tesla described the weapon:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have made recent discoveries of inestimable value... The flying machine has completely demoralized the world, so much that in some cities, as London and Paris, people are in mortal fear from aerial bombing. The new means I have perfected afford absolute protection against this and other forms of attack. ... These new discoveries, which I have carried out experimentally on a limited scale, have created a profound impression. One of the most pressing problems seems to be the protection of London and I am writing to some influential friends in England hoping that my plan will be adopted without delay. The Russians are very anxious to render their borders safe against Japanese invasion and I have made them a proposal which is being seriously considered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfcbooks.com/teslafaq/q&amp;a_011.htm Tesla FAQ].  Retrieved 2013-12-03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1937, Tesla wrote a treatise, "''The Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media''",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teslaradio.com/pages/teleforce.htm THE NEW ART OF PROJECTING CONCENTRATED NON-DISPERSIVE ENERGY THROUGH NATURAL MEDIA] -- System of Particle Acceleration for Use in National Defense.&lt;/ref&gt; concerning [[charged particle beam]] weapons.&lt;ref name="Seifer454"&gt;{{cite book |title=Wizard: the life and times of Nikola Tesla: biography of a genius |last=Seifer |first=Marc J |year=2001 |publisher=Citadel |page=454 |isbn=978-0-8065-1960-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h2DTNDFcC14C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla published the document in an attempt to expound on the technical description of a '[[superweapon]]" that would put an end to all war." This treatise is currently in the [[Nikola Tesla Museum]] archive in [[Belgrade]]. It describes an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging particles to millions of volts, and a method of creating and directing non-dispersive particle streams (through [[electrostatic]] repulsion).&lt;ref name="Seifer454" /&gt; 

== "Death ray" misnomer ==
Teleforce was mentioned publicly in the ''[[New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'' on July 11, 1934.&lt;ref name=polyphase&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Beam to Kill Army at 200 Miles, Tesla's Claim On 78th Birthday |url=http://www.tesla-coil-builder.com/Articles/jul_11_1934b.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201211113/http://www.tesla-coil-builder.com/Articles/jul_11_1934b.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 1, 2010 |publisher=[[New York Herald Tribune]] |date=July 11, 1934 |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Tesla, At 78, Bares New 'Death-Beam'.

Rays are not applicable because they cannot be produced in requisite quantities and diminish rapidly in intensity with distance. All the energy of New York City (approximately two million horsepower) transformed into rays and projected twenty miles, could not kill a human being, because, according to a well known law of physics, it would disperse to such an extent as to be ineffectual. My apparatus projects particles ..."&lt;ref name="AmtEW"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What set Tesla's proposal apart from the usual run of fantasy "death rays" was a unique vacuum chamber with one end open to the atmosphere. Tesla devised a unique vacuum seal by directing a high-velocity air stream at the tip of his gun to maintain "high vacua." The necessary pumping action would be accomplished with a large [[Tesla turbine]].&lt;ref name="AWtEW"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Components of Teleforce==

In total, the components and methods included:

* An apparatus for producing manifestations of energy in free air instead of in a [[Vacuum|high vacuum]] as in the past.
* A mechanism for generating tremendous electrical force.
* A means of intensifying and amplifying the force developed by the second mechanism.
* A new method for producing a tremendous electrical repelling force. This would be the projector, or gun, of the invention.&lt;ref name="AmtEW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Death-Ray Machine Described | work=New York Sun |date= 11 July 1934 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been said that the charged particles would self-focus via "[[gas focusing]],".{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} In 1940, Tesla estimated that each station would cost no more than $2,000,000 and could have been constructed in a few months.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

After Tesla died, in a box purported to contain a part of Tesla's "death ray" apparatus, [[John G. Trump]] found a 45-year-old [[Decade Box|multidecade resistance box]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|1993|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attempts at development and marketing  ==
By November 1934 Tesla was attempting (unsuccessfully) to obtain funding from J. P. Morgan's son, [[J. P. Morgan Jr.|Jack Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Bernard Carlson, Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, Princeton University Press - 2013, page 386&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of Tesla possibly having a new type of weapon and his further offer to give it to the [[League of Nations]] as a way to prevent future war was looked on as alarming security threat by one US diplomat, a view not shared by his government.&lt;ref&gt;W. Bernard Carlson, Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, Princeton University Press - 2013, page 387&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 the [[Soviet Union]], through the US [[Amtorg Trading Corporation]], paid Tesla $25,000 for detailed plans, specification, and complete information on the method and apparatus but it is unclear whether a physical device was ever produced.&lt;ref&gt;W. Bernard Carlson, Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, Princeton University Press - 2013, page 388&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AWtEW"/&gt; Tesla also attempted to get funding for his device in 1937, sending a paper ("New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-Dispersive Energy Through Natural Media") outlining his plans to the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="AWtEW"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Weapon to End War|url=https://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_wendwar.html|work=Tesla - Master of Lightning|publisher=[[PBS]]|quote=By 1937 it was clear that war would soon break out in Europe. Frustrated in his attempts to generate interest and financing for his "peace beam," he sent an elaborate technical paper, including diagrams, to a number of Allied nations including the United States, Canada, England, France, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia. Titled "New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-Dispersive Energy Through Natural Media," the paper provided the first technical description of what is today called a charged particle beam weapon.Of all the countries to receive Tesla's proposal, the greatest interest came from the Soviet Union. In 1937 Tesla presented a plan to the Amtorg Trading Corporation, an alleged Soviet arms front in New York City. Two years later, in 1939, one stage of the plan was tested in the USSR and Tesla received a check for $25,000.}}&lt;/ref&gt; United Kingdom considered Tesla's offer to sell the device to them for $30 million, maybe with the idea that even hinting they had a super weapon would be a deterrent to [[Adolf Hitler]], but by 1938 they had dropped all interest.&lt;ref&gt;W. Bernard Carlson, Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, Princeton University Press - 2013, page 388&lt;/ref&gt; 

During this period Tesla claimed that efforts had been made to steal the invention saying his room had been entered and his papers had been scrutinized, but the thieves, or spies, left empty-handed. He said that there was no danger that his invention could be stolen for he had at no time committed any part of it to paper. The blueprint for the Teleforce weapon was all in his mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1= O'Neill |first1= John J. |url=https://www.pbs.org/tesla/res/res_art12.html |title=Tesla Tries To Prevent World War II (unpublished Chapter 34 of Prodigal Genius) |work=PBS }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, at his [[Nikola Tesla#Birthday press conferences|birthday press conference]] Tesla was asked about his weapon and made the claim, "But it is not an experiment... I have built, demonstrated and used it. Only a little time will pass before I can give it to the world."&lt;ref name="seifer1"/&gt; At the 1940 birthday press conference an 84 year old Tesla offered to develop his weapon for the US but there was no interest in his offer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5486">The '''Theoretical Advanced Study Institute''' or '''TASI''' is a four-week summer school in [[high-energy physics]] or [[astrophysics]] held yearly at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]].  The school is meant primarily for advanced graduate students and consists of a series of pedagogical lectures on selected topics given by active researchers in the field.  TASI is the most common summer school attended by high-energy physics graduate students in the United States.

Writeups of the TASI lectures are traditionally collected into a published volume each year, creating a valuable resource for students hoping to learn about current research topics in an accessible way. The writeups are typically also posted by the lecturers on [[arXiv.org]], providing freely-accessible web-based sources on various physics topics.  Since 2007, TASI has also posted video recordings of the lectures online.

==History==
The first TASI was held in 1984 at the [[University of Michigan]].  Subsequent TASIs were held at [[Yale]] (1985), [[University of California at Santa Cruz|Santa Cruz]] (1986), [[Santa Fe Institute|Santa Fe]] (1987), and [[Brown University|Brown]] (1988).  Since 1989 TASI has been located in Boulder.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2814">The '''First Law of Geography''', according to [[Waldo Tobler]], is "everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."&lt;ref&gt;Tobler W., (1970) "A computer movie simulating urban growth in the Detroit region". ''Economic Geography'', 46(Supplement): 234-240.&lt;/ref&gt; This first law is the foundation of the fundamental concepts of [[spatial dependence]] and [[spatial autocorrelation]] and is utilized specifically for the [[inverse distance weighting]] method for [[spatial interpolation]] and to support the [[regionalized variable theory]] for [[kriging]].&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, Karen.  "Encyclopedia of Geographic Information Science", SAGE, 2008, p146-147&lt;/ref&gt;

Tobler first presented his seminal idea during a meeting of the [[International Geographical Union]]'s Commission on Qualitative Methods held in 1969 and later published by him in 1970. Though simple in its presentation, this idea is profound. Without it, "the full range of conditions anywhere on the Earth's surface could in principle be found packed within any small area. There would be no regions of approximately homogeneous conditions to be described by giving attributes to area objects. Topographic surfaces would vary chaotically, with slopes that were everywhere infinite, and the contours of such surfaces would be infinitely dense and contorted. Spatial analysis, and indeed life itself, would be impossible."&lt;ref&gt;De Smith, Michael John; Goodchild, Michael F.; Longley, Paul. "Geospatial Analysis: A Comprehensive Guide to Principles, Techniques and Software Tools", Troubador Publishing Ltd, 2007, p44&lt;/ref&gt;

Less well known is his second law, which complements the first: "The phenomenon external to an area of interest affects what goes on inside".&lt;ref&gt;Linear pycnophylactic reallocation—Comment on a paper by D. Martin, ''International Journal of Geographical Information Science'', 13(1), 85-90, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation and background==
The theory is based upon the concept of the [[friction of distance]] "where distance itself hinders interaction between places. The farther two places are apart, the greater the hindrance",&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Meredith; Alagona, Peter S. "AP Human Geography 2008", Barron's Educational Series, 91-92, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; or cost. For example, one is less likely to travel across town to purchase a sandwich than walk to the corner store for the same sandwich. In this example hindrance, or cost, can readily be counted in time and transportation costs which are added to the price of the purchase and thus result in high levels of friction. The friction of distance and the increase in cost combine causing the [[distance decay]] effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7188">'''Vitrified forts''' are stone enclosures whose walls have been subjected to [[vitrification]] through heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brigantesnation.com/VitrifiedForts/VitrifieedForts.htm |title=Vitrification of Hill Forts |accessdate=2008-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was long thought that these structures were unique to Scotland, but they have since been identified in several other parts of western and northern Europe.

Vitrified forts are generally situated on hills offering strong defensive positions. Their form seems to have been determined by the contour of the flat summits which they enclose. The walls vary in size, a few being upwards of {{convert|12|ft}} high, and are so broad that they present the appearance of [[levee|embankments]]. Weak parts of the defence are strengthened by double or triple walls, and occasionally vast lines of [[rampart (fortification)|ramparts]], composed of large blocks of unhewn and unvitrified stones, envelop the vitrified centre at some distance from it.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Vitrified Forts |volume=28 |pages=149–150 |first=Robert |last=Munro |authorlink=Robert Munro (archaeologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The walls themselves are termed vitrified ramparts.&lt;ref&gt;Darvill, Timothy (2008). ''Oxford Concise Dictionary of Archaeology'', 2nd ed., Oxford University Press, Oxford and New York, p. 376. {{ISBN|978-0-19-953404-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

No [[lime (mineral)|lime]] or [[cement]] has been found in any of these structures, all of them presenting the peculiarity of being more or less consolidated by the fusion of the rocks of which they are built. This fusion, which has been caused by the application of intense heat, is not equally complete in the various forts, or even in the walls of the same fort. In some cases the stones are only partially melted and [[calcined]]; in others their adjoining edges are fused so that they are firmly cemented together; in many instances pieces of rock are enveloped in a glassy enamel-like coating which binds them into a uniform whole; and at times, though rarely, the entire length of the wall presents one solid mass of vitreous substance.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

It is not clear why or how the walls were subjected to vitrification. Some [[antiquarian]]s have argued that it was done to strengthen the wall, but the heating actually weakens the structure. Battle damage is also unlikely to be the cause, as the walls are thought to have been subjected to carefully maintained fires to ensure they were hot enough for vitrification to take place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeology.about.com/od/vterms/g/vitrified_forts.htm Vitrification temperatures]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benderloch.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1139 More information and the vitrification debate]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most archaeologists now consider that vitrified forts are the product of deliberate destruction either following the capture of the site by an enemy force or by the occupants at the end of its active life as an act of ritual closure.&lt;ref name="Ralston_143"&gt;Ralston 2006, 143-63{{full citation needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process has no chronological significance and is found during both Iron Age and Early Medieval Forts in Scotland.&lt;ref name="Ralston_143"/&gt;

Since [[John Williams (geologist)|John Williams]], one of the earliest of British [[geologist]]s, and author of ''The Natural History of the Mineral Kingdom'', first described these singular ruins in 1777, over 70 examples have been discovered in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The most remarkable are:

For a long time it was supposed that these forts were peculiar to Scotland; but they are found also in the Isle of Man (Cronk Sumark) [[County Londonderry]] and [[County Cavan]], Ireland; in [[Upper Lusatia]], [[Bohemia]], [[Silesia]], [[Saxony]], and [[Thuringia]]; in the provinces on the [[Rhine]], especially in the neighbourhood of the [[Nahe (Rhine)|Nahe]]; in the [[Uecker|Ucker Lake]]; in Brandenburg, where the walls are formed of burnt and smelted [[brick]]s; in Hungary; in several places in France, such as Châteauvieux (near [[Pionnat]]), Péran, [[La Courbe]], [[Sainte-Suzanne, Mayenne|Sainte-Suzanne]], [[Puy de Gaudy]], and [[Thauron]]; also rarely in the north of England. [[Broborg|Barksdale]] is a vitrified hill-fort in [[Uppland]], Sweden.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Appearance in Media==
===''[[Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World]]''===
The 16 September 1980 episode of this series features a segment in which the archaeologist Ian Ralston examines the mystery of the vitrified fort Tap o' Noth and tries to recreate how it might be accomplished by piling stones and setting a massive bonfire, repeating the work of [[V. Gordon Childe]] and [[Wallace Thorneycroft]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur C. Clarke|Clarke, A. C]], Welfare, S and Fairley, J. ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World]]''. Collins, 1980, p.61.&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment produced a few partially vitrified stones, but no answers were gleaned as to how large-scale forts could have been crafted with the approach tried in the programme.&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World'' ([[Yorkshire Television]] 1980; episode 3: "Ancient Wisdom" ([[Network DVD]] 7952792). Segment runs from 10:58 to 17:150&lt;/ref&gt;
