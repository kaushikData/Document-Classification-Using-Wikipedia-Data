'''''A Guide to the Birds of Mexico and Northern Central America''''' is a [[field guide]] to [[bird]]s, covering 1070 species found in Mexico and five other countries in northern [[Central America]] ([[Guatemala]], [[Belize]], [[El Salvador|El&amp;nbsp;Salvador]], [[Honduras]] and [[Nicaragua]]).  It is a 1995 book by [[Steve N. G. Howell]] and [[Sophie Webb]], published by [[Oxford University Press]].

A 60-page introduction outlines the geographical area covered, explains the areas geography and bird distribution within it, and discusses climate and habitat, and bird migration. Also included within this introduction are a section summarising the history of [[ornithology]] in the region, and essay on conservation, and a short summary of birding within the region. The introduction is followed by a 25-page section entitled "Using this book". This is then followed by the species accounts themselves, from pages 87 to 764.

A series of five appendices covers extinct species, species of hypothetical occurrence, birds of Pacific islands, of Gulf and Caribbean islands, and those found in eastern Honduras. These are followed by a 26-page bibliography, and indexes to English and scientific names.

The covers are illustrated with paintings of Mexican birds: a [[black-throated magpie-jay]] on the front cover, a [[short-crested coquette]] on the spine, and an [[unspotted saw-whet owl]] and two [[plumbeous kite]]s on the rear cover.

71 colour plates are placed centrally within the book, between pages 400 and 401.

'''America's WETLAND Foundation''' ('''AWF''') is a [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit]], [[Tax exemption|tax exempt]] [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]]  organization with the stated mission to save and conserve coastal [[wetlands in the U.S. state of Louisiana]]. The organization aims to achieve this mission through a public awareness campaign on the impact [[Louisiana]]'s [[wetland]] loss has on the state, region, nation and world.

AWF is based in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. The public education campaign started in 2002, when the AWF board hired the [[public relations]] Marmillion + Company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americaswetland.com/custompage.cfm?pageid=31 America's WETLAND: Contact Us&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since being formed in 2003, America's Wetland officials say its message and outreach has resulted in more than 1 billion media impressions worldwide. That tally includes documentaries, news shows, feature stories, billboards, festivals, special events, public-service announcements and Web sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houmatoday.com/article/20081201/ARTICLES/812019961?Title=America_s_Wetland_assess_its_six_year_effect Americas Wetland assess its six-year effect | HoumaToday.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2001, Former Louisiana Governor [[Murphy J. Foster, Jr.|Mike Foster]] launched what would become the America's WETLAND Campaign, and declared a "holy war" on coastal erosion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/08/AR2005100801458_pf.html Washington Post: The Slow Drowning of New Orleans&lt;/ref&gt; Since a previous 18 month state sponsored study had determined a comprehensive restoration effort would cost more than $14 billion, it was determined the only way to raise that amount of money was through [[federal funding]] and therefore widespread public support was necessary.&lt;ref name="lacoast.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1332684 | title = Environmental Health Perspectives: Louisiana's Wetlands: A Lesson in Nature Appreciation|pmid=16393646 | volume=114 | issue=1 | date=January 2006 | pages=A40–3 | doi=10.1289/ehp.114-a40 | journal=Environmental Health Perspectives | last1 = Tibbetts | first1 = J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, AWF became an independent foundation supported by public donations, and private sponsors such as [[Shell Oil Company]], [[Tabasco Sauce|Tabasco]] pepper sauce, and others.

AWF has been supported by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] including Foster's successor, Former Louisiana Governor [[Kathleen Blanco]] who joined the effort in 2004. AWF has grown into a multimillion-dollar campaign, and describes itself as "the largest public education campaign in Louisiana history."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americaswetland.com/custompage.cfm?pageid=2 About Us | America's Wetland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hurricanes Katrina and Rita===
Hurricanes [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] were predated by AWF's first "Storm Warnings" event, which sought to illustrate the role wetlands play as a natural hurricane buffer. The event ominously involved draping a blue tarp over a block of [[Royal Street]] to illustrate the flood levels if a [[Category 5 storm]] hit New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/2005/09/05/Worldandnation/Katrina_offers_lesson.shtml Worldandnation: Katrina offers lesson on wetlands protection&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the America's WETLAND Foundation was a natural platform for Louisiana public officials to rally national public support to the region. Former Congressman [[Billy Tauzin]] stated in a ''[[Washington Post]]'' article following the disasters, "We all came together around America's Wetland... [it] was the most coordination I ever saw."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/08/AR2005100801458_pf.html | work=The Washington Post | first1=Michael | last1=Grunwald | first2=Susan B. | last2=Glasser | title=The Slow Drowning of New Orleans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, then Governor Blanco asked AWF to provide support and assistance in establishing the [[Louisiana Disaster Recovery Foundation]] to receive donations to assist Louisiana victims of the hurricanes.
An AWF related organization, "Women of the Storm" (WOS), was created following the storms. The WOS is composed of 140 New Orleans area volunteers who advocate for members of the [[United States Congress]] to visit hurricane-damaged areas. As of January 2009, their efforts have resulted in 57 [[United States Senate|Senators]] and 147 [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] witnessing damaged areas first hand.
One year after the hurricanes AWF launched "Riding the Trail to Recovery" a two-mile (3&amp;nbsp;km) [[cattle drive]] through lower [[Cameron Parish]] designed to help bring attention to victims of Hurricane Rita who may have felt forgotten by the larger focus on Hurricane Katrina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/23/AR2006092300740.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Doug | last=Simpson | title=La. Cattlemen Struggle 1 Year After Rita | date=September 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives and messages==
The America's WETLAND Foundation's public awareness campaign focuses on two themes: one, the region is of world ecological significance and, two, it is critical to the economic and energy future of the [[United States]]. The Foundation supports the [[Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority]]'s master plan for coastal restoration passed by the [[Louisiana Legislature]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americaswetland.com/custompage.cfm?pageid=2&amp;cid=5 History | America's Wetland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

AWF's Progress Report states its public education campaign has five primary objectives:

#Design a powerful, consistent and effective identity and [[brand]] along with images and core messages to define the problem and the impact of the loss of Louisiana's wetlands.
#Create outreach opportunities and utilize comprehensive print and [[electronic media|media]] strategies to increase news coverage, educate the public and engender campaign support.
#Develop a strong and active "Cooperating Organizations" [[wikt:network|network]] to support dissemination of campaign messages and information to key audiences.
#Build an education infrastructure through opportunities to engage youth and adults about coastal Louisiana issues.
#Develop funding opportunities to support the campaign and long-term restoration activities.&lt;ref name="americaswetland.com"&gt;http://www.americaswetland.com/photos/article/102408_aw-reportFinal.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awareness events==
The America's WETLAND Foundation is a multi-faceted campaign with many different related organizations, brands, and awareness events. Some of their annual awareness events include "Storm Warnings," and "Keep Your Eye on The Prize." The annual Storm Warnings event occurs around the start of each [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]] (end of May) and is designed to help focus national attention on the importance of Louisiana's coast and the wetlands' role as a natural hurricane buffer.

"Storm Warnings IV: Last Stand" was announced on February 2, 2009 and is set to take place May 30–31, 2009 and will include a large free concert in New Orleans. This will be followed the next day by flotillas of watercraft rendezvousing at the [[Houma Downtown Marina]] where they will point reflectors to the sun, to be photographed by [[satellite]]  to illustrate how the land below the line will be lost if nothing is done to restore Louisiana's eroding coast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2009/02/last_stand_24hour_rally_planne.html 24-hour rally planned for coastal restoration | NOLA.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Keep Your Eye On The Prize" is a two-month-long photo, art and poetry contest for Louisiana students in fourth through twelfth grade. The contest usually asks students to capture the importance or beauty of the wetlands through one of the above mediums. The 9 first-place winners (3 age divisions for each category) receive a $500 grant for their school to conduct a conservation project, usually in conjunction with the America's WETLAND Conservation Corps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americaswetland.com/custompage.cfm?pageid=194 Keep Your Eye On The Prize Contest | America's Wetland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Estuarians" are an animated [[superhero]] conservation action team designed to help kids learn about the importance of the wetlands. They are also [[mascots]] who have been to multiple events including [[Mardi Gras]], [[National Wetlands Research Center]], and Ocean Commotion .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americaswetland.com/custompage.cfm?pageid=28&amp;cid=183 Estuarians | America's Wetland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The America's WETLAND Foundation also helped sponsor and develop a comprehensive series of birding trails throughout the state of Louisiana in conjunction with [[Lieutenant Governor]] [[Mitch Landrieu]]. America's Wetland Birding Trail now consists of 264 sites on 26 loops and 10 scenic pathways statewide. Many of these sites are located in rural settings near rivers, [[river delta|deltas]], open meadows, lagoons and in several pine and hardwood forests. The paths follow interstate, state and federal highways around the state as individual loops stand together as one tourist attraction within the transportation network of Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americaswetland.com/custompage.cfm?pageid=125 America's WETLAND Birding Trail Loops | America's Wetland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

AWF also produces brochures, public service announcements, and documentaries.

==Related organizations==
AWF sponsors educational and restoration programs, such as the America's WETLAND Conservation Corps, which is a partnership between the America's WETLAND Foundation and the [[Louisiana State University]] [[Louisiana State University Agricultural Center|AgCenter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americaswetland.com/custompage.cfm?pageid=176]&lt;/ref&gt; This [[AmeriCorps]] program, operating in conjunction with LSU AgCenter, places members at sites throughout Louisiana to coordinate hands-on coastal restoration projects that include vegetative plantings, restorative interventions, community wide cleanups, and hands-on education projects for volunteers and communities in an effort to promote stewardship and conservation, raising public awareness of the negative impact that the erosion of Louisiana's wetlands has on the state, national and worldwide ecosystems.

An AWF related organization, "Women of the Storm," (WOS) was created following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The WOS is composed of 140 New Orleans area volunteers who advocate for members of Congress to visit hurricane-damaged areas. As of January 2009, their efforts have resulted in 57 Senators and 147 Representatives witnessing damaged areas first hand.

America's Energy  Coast is an AWF related organization which joins the [[Gulf Coast]] energy producing states of Louisiana, [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], and [[Texas]] together to develop common solutions to ensure a sustainable coastal environment and the inextricably linked activities critical to the nation's energy and economic security. Its "Accord for a New Sustainability For America's Energy Coast" is a living framework of shared principles where its disparate member groups have come to consensus. The group claims its format "will yield technology and solutions [[best practices]], and policy recommendations at all levels of government."

==Awards and endorsements==
The America's WETLAND Campaign has won over 45 awards such as [[MarCom Creative Awards]], [[Southern Growth Innovator Award]], [[Spotlight Awards]], [[Summit Creative Award]], Telly Award, [[Videographer Award]], [[Natioinal Association of Government Communicators Award]], [[Comunicator Award]], and the [[League of American Communications Professionals]] for top 50 publicity campaigns.
The ''[[Houma Courier]]'' endorsed the accomplishments of the campaign saying in an editorial, "Looking back to six years ago, when the America's Wetland Foundation was kicked off, it is easy to see how many real improvements have been made in our coastal challenges and how many of those challenges remain unabated. But this much is clear: Much of the progress that has been made can be directly or indirectly attributed to the America's Wetland and the vital work it is doing on our behalf."

The 2007 [[Miss Louisiana USA]] winner [[Elizabeth McNulty]] has worked with America's WETLAND Foundation as well as the America's WETLAND Conservation Corps.

[[File:360 anechoic chamber salford university uk.jpg|thumb|400px|360 image of an acoustic anechoic chamber]] [[File:360 image of an electromagnetic anechoic chamber.jpg|thumb|360 image of an electromagnetic anechoic chamber]]

An '''anechoic chamber'''  (''an-echoic'' meaning "non-reflective, non-echoing, echo-free") is a room designed to completely absorb reflections of either [[sound]] or [[electromagnetic waves]]. They are also often isolated from waves entering from their surroundings. This combination means that a person or detector exclusively hears direct sounds (no [[reverberation|reverberant]] sounds), in effect simulating being inside an infinitely large room.

Anechoic chambers, a term coined by American acoustics expert [[Leo Beranek]], were initially exclusively used to refer to acoustic anechoic chambers. Recently, the term has been extended to RF anechoic chambers, which eliminate reflection and external noise caused by electromagnetic waves.

Anechoic chambers range from small compartments the size of household [[microwave oven]]s to ones as large as [[aircraft hangar]]s. The size of the chamber depends on the size of the objects and frequency ranges being tested.

==Acoustic anechoic chambers==
[[File:Anechoic chamber dissipation.jpg|thumb|Minimization of the reflection of sound waves by an anechoic chamber's walls.]]
[[File:Consumer Reports - product testing - headphones in anechoic chamber.tif|thumb|Testing headphones in an anechoic chamber]]
Anechoic chambers are commonly used in acoustics to conduct experiments in nominally "[[Free field (acoustics)|free field]]" conditions, free-field meaning that there are no reflected signals. All sound energy will be traveling away from the source with almost none reflected back. Common anechoic chamber experiments include measuring the [[transfer function]] of a [[loudspeaker]] or the [[directivity]] of noise radiation from industrial machinery. In general, the interior of an anechoic chamber is very quiet, with typical noise levels in the 10–20 [[Decibel|dBA]] range. In 2005, the best anechoic chamber measured at −9.4 dBA.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web |last = Morton |first = Ella |date = 5 May 2014 |title = How Long Could You Endure the World's Quietest Place? |url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/atlas_obscura/2014/05/05/orfield_laboratories_in_minneapolis_is_the_world_s_quietest_place.html |work = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate = 5 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, an anechoic chamber on the campus of [[Microsoft]] broke the world record with a measurement of −20.6 dBA.&lt;ref name="msft"&gt;{{cite web |last = Novet |first = Jordan |title = Look Inside Microsoft’s Anechoic Chamber, Officially the Quietest Place on Earth |url = https://venturebeat.com/2015/10/01/look-inside-microsofts-anechoic-chamber-officially-the-quietest-place-on-earth/ |work = [[VentureBeat]] |accessdate = 1 October 2015 |date = 1 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The human ear can typically detect sounds above 0 dBA, so a human in such a chamber would perceive the surroundings as devoid of sound.  Anecdotally, some people may not like such quietness and can become disoriented.&lt;ref name="slate" /&gt;

The mechanism by which anechoic chambers minimize the reflection of sound waves impinging onto their walls is as follows: In the included figure, an incident sound wave I is about to impinge onto a wall of an anechoic chamber.  This wall is composed of a series of wedges W with height H.  After the impingement, the incident wave I is reflected as a series of waves R which in turn "bounce up-and-down" in the gap of air A (bounded by dotted lines) between the wedges W.  Such bouncing may produce (at least temporarily) a standing wave pattern in A.  During this process, the acoustic energy of the waves R gets dissipated via the air's molecular viscosity, in particular near the corner C.&lt;ref name="beranek-interview"&gt;{{Cite interview |last = Beranek |first = Leo |date = 10 August 2009 |title = Oral History Interview with Leo Beranek |interviewer = Richard Lyon |url = https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/34719

As a result, the component of the reflected waves R along the direction of I that escapes the gaps A (and goes back to the source of sound), denoted R', is notably reduced. Even though this explanation is two-dimensional, it is representative and applicable to the actual three-dimensional wedge structures used in anechoic chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = An Introduction to Acoustics |year = 2005 |publisher = Dover Publications |last = Randall |first = R.

===Semi-anechoic chambers===

Full anechoic chambers aim to absorb energy in all directions. Semi-anechoic chambers have a solid floor that acts as a work surface for supporting heavy items, such as cars, washing machines, or industrial machinery, rather than the mesh floor grille over absorbent tiles found in full anechoic chambers. This floor is damped and floating on absorbent buffers to isolate it from outside vibration or electromagnetic signals. [[Recording studio]]s are often semi-anechoic.

==Radio-frequency anechoic chambers==

The internal appearance of the [[radio frequency]] (RF) anechoic chamber is sometimes similar to that of an acoustic anechoic chamber; however, the interior surfaces of the RF anechoic chamber are covered with [[radar absorbent material|radiation absorbent material]] (RAM) instead of acoustically absorbent material. Uses for RF anechoic chambers include testing antennae, radars, and  is typically used to house the antennas for performing measurements of [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] [[radiation pattern]]s,  [[electromagnetic interference]].

Performance expectations (gain, efficiency, pattern characteristics, etc.) constitute primary challenges in designing stand alone or embedded [[Antenna (radio)|antennae]]. Designs are becoming ever more complex with a single device incorporating multiple technologies such as [[cellular network|cellular]], [[WiFi]], [[Bluetooth]], [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]], [[MIMO]], [[RFID]] and [[GPS]].

===Radiation-absorbent material===

{{Main|Radiation-absorbent material}}
RAM is designed and shaped to [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorb]] incident RF radiation (also known as [[non-ionising radiation]]) as effectively as possible, from as many incident directions as possible. The more effective the RAM, the lower the resulting level of [[reflection (physics)|reflected]] RF radiation. Many measurements in [[electromagnetic compatibility]] (EMC) and antenna radiation patterns require that spurious signals arising from the test setup, including reflections, are negligible to avoid the risk of causing [[observational error|measurement errors]] and ambiguities.

===Effectiveness over frequency===
[[File:Anechoic chamber wall.JPG|thumb|200px|Close-up of a pyramidal RAM]]
Waves of higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths and are higher in energy, while waves of lower frequencies have longer wavelengths and are lower in energy, according to the relationship &lt;math&gt;\lambda= v/f&lt;/math&gt; where lambda represents wavelength, v is phase velocity of wave, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is frequency. To shield for a specific wavelength, the cone must be of appropriate size to absorb that wavelength. The performance quality of an RF anechoic chamber is determined by its lowest test frequency of operation, at which measured reflections from the internal surfaces will be the most significant compared to higher frequencies. Pyramidal RAM is at its most absorptive when the incident wave is at [[surface normal|normal]] incidence to the internal chamber surface and the pyramid height is approximately equal to &lt;math&gt;\lambda/4&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[free space]] [[wavelength]]. Accordingly, increasing the pyramid height of the RAM for the same ([[Square (geometry)|square]]) base size improves the effectiveness of the chamber at low frequencies but results in increased cost and a reduced unobstructed working volume that is available inside a chamber of defined size.

===Installation into a screened room===
An RF anechoic chamber is usually built into a screened room, designed using the [[Faraday cage]] principle. This is because most of the RF tests that require an anechoic chamber to minimize reflections from the inner surfaces also require the properties of a screened room to [[attenuation|attenuate]] unwanted signals penetrating inwards and causing interference to the equipment under test and prevent leakage from tests penetrating outside.{{citation needed|date=October 2015|reason=In my experience, an anechoic RF chamber is itself a screened room, i.e. it does not need to be installed inside another one.}}

===Chamber size and commissioning===
At lower radiated frequencies, far-field measurement can require a large and expensive chamber. Sometimes, for example for radar cross-section measurements, it is possible to scale down the object under test and reduce the chamber size, provided that the wavelength of the test frequency is scaled down in direct proportion by testing at a higher frequency.{{citation needed|date=October 2015|reason=sounds neat but is it really done?}}

RF anechoic chambers are normally designed to meet the electrical requirements of one or more accredited [[Standardization|standard]]s. For example, the aircraft industry may test equipment for aircraft according to company specifications or military specifications such as [[MIL-STD 461]]E. Once built, [[acceptance test]]s are performed during commissioning to verify that the standard(s) are in fact met. Provided they are, a certificate will be issued to that effect. The chamber will need to be periodically retested.

===Operational use===
Test and supporting equipment configurations to be used within anechoic chambers must expose as few metallic (conductive) surfaces as possible, as these risk causing unwanted reflections. Often this is achieved by using non-conductive [[plastic]] or [[wood]]en structures for supporting the equipment under test. Where metallic surfaces are unavoidable, they may be covered with pieces of RAM after setting up to minimize such reflection as far as possible.

A careful assessment may be required as to whether the test equipment (as opposed to the equipment under test) should be placed inside or outside the chamber. Typically most of it is located in a separate screened room attached to the main test chamber, in order to shield it from both external interference and from the radiation within the chamber. Mains power and test signal cabling into the test chamber require high quality [[electronic filter|filtering]].

[[optical fiber|Fiber optic]] cables are sometimes used for the signal cabling, as they are immune to ordinary RFI and also cause little reflection inside the chamber.

===Health and safety risks associated with RF anechoic chamber===
The following [[occupational safety and health|health and safety]] risks are associated with RF anechoic chambers:

*RF radiation hazard
*Fire hazard
*Trapped personnel

Personnel are not normally permitted inside the chamber during a measurement as this not only can cause unwanted reflections from the [[human anatomy|human body]] but may also be a [[electromagnetic radiation and health|radiation hazard]] to the personnel concerned if tests are being performed at high RF powers. Such risks are from RF or non-ionizing radiation and not from the higher energy [[ionizing radiation]].

As RAM is highly absorptive of RF radiation, incident radiation will generate [[heat]] within the RAM. If this cannot be dissipated adequately there is a risk that hot spots may develop and the RAM [[temperature]] may rise to the point of [[combustion]]. This can be a risk if a transmitting antenna inadvertently gets too close to the RAM. Even for quite modest transmitting power levels, high [[antenna gain|gain]] antennas can concentrate the power sufficiently to cause high power [[flux]] near their [[aperture]]s. Although recently manufactured RAM is normally treated with a [[fire retardant]] to reduce such risks, they are difficult to completely eliminate. Safety regulations normally require the installation of a [[gaseous fire suppression]] system including [[smoke detector]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4277">[[File:Antiprotonic helium..svg|thumb|This is an atom of antiprotonic helium. (Note the offset between the electron and antiproton orbitals due to the repulsive force between the like charges of both particles.)]]
'''Antiprotonic helium''' is a three-body atom composed of an [[antiproton]] and an [[electron]] orbiting around a [[helium]] [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. It is thus made partly of matter, and partly of antimatter. The atom is electrically neutral, since both electrons and antiprotons each have a charge of −1, whereas helium nuclei have a charge of +2.  The antiprotonic helium atom is called an atomcule, as it has a structure like an atom, but has two nuclei like a molecule.

== Production ==

These [[exotic atoms]] can be produced by simply mixing antiprotons with ordinary helium gas; the antiproton spontaneously removes one of the two electrons contained in a normal helium atom in a chemical reaction, and then begins to orbit the helium nucleus in the electron's place. This will happen in the case of approximately 3% of the antiprotons introduced to the helium gas.  The antiproton's orbit, which has a large [[principal quantum number]] and [[angular momentum quantum number]] of around 38, lies far away from the surface of the helium nucleus. The antiproton can thus orbit the nucleus for tens of microseconds, before finally falling to its surface and [[annihilation|annihilating]].

== Laser spectroscopy ==

Antiprotonic helium atoms are under study by the [[ASACUSA]] experiment at [[CERN]]. In these experiments, the atoms are first produced by stopping a beam of antiprotons in helium gas. The atoms are then irradiated by powerful laser beams, which cause the antiprotons in them to resonate and jump from one atomic orbit to another.

== Measurement of the mass ratio between the antiproton and electron ==

By measuring the particular [[frequency]] of the laser light needed to resonate the atom, 
the [[ASACUSA]] experiment determined the mass of the antiproton, which they measured at {{val|1836.1536734|(15)}} times more massive than an [[electron]].&lt;ref name=Mhori&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Science | volume=354 |issue=6312 | pages=610–4 | year=2016 |last=Hori |first=M. | title=Buffer-gas cooling of antiprotonic helium to 1.5 to 1.7 K, and antiproton-to-electron mass ratio |doi=10.1126/science.aaf6702 | display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2016Sci...354..610H }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the same as the mass of a "regular" proton, within the level of certainty of the experiment.
This is a confirmation of a fundamental symmetry of nature called [[CPT symmetry|CPT]] (short for charge, parity, and time reversal). This law says that all physical laws would remain unchanged under simultaneous reversal of the [[electric charge|charge]] axis, [[parity (physics)|parity of the space axes]], and the orientation of the [[time]] axis. One important prediction of this theory is that particles and their [[antiparticles]] should have exactly the same mass.

== Comparison of antiproton and proton masses and charges ==

By comparing the above results on laser spectroscopy of antiprotonic helium with separate high-precision measurements of the antiproton's [[cyclotron]] frequency carried out by the [[ATRAP]] and [[Baryon Antibaryon Symmetry Experiment|BASE]] collaborations at CERN, the [[mass]] and [[electric charge]] of the antiproton can be precisely compared with the proton values. The most recent such measurements show that the antiproton's mass (and the absolute value of the charge) is the same as the proton's to a precision of 0.5 parts in a billion.

== Antiprotonic helium ions ==

An '''antiprotonic helium ion''' is a two-body object composed of a helium nucleus and orbiting antiproton. It has an electric charge of +1. Cold ions with lifetimes of up to 100&amp;nbsp;ns were produced at CERN in 2005.

The '''Baja California Desert''' is a [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|desert]] [[ecoregion]] of [[Mexico]]'s [[Baja California Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor H. Ricketts, Eric Dinerstein, David M. Olson, Colby J. Loucks, et al. 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This ecoregion occupies the western portion of the Baja California peninsula, and occupies most of the Mexican states of [[Baja California Sur]] and [[Baja California]]. It covers 77,700 square kilometers (30,000 square miles). The climate is dry, but the close proximity of the Pacific Ocean provides humidity and moderates the temperature. The flora mostly consists of [[xeric]] shrubs and over 500 [[species]] of recorded [[vascular plant]]s.

==Geography and climate==
The ecoregion covers 77,700 square kilometers (30,000 square miles) and includes most of the Peninsula's western slope. It is bounded on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]] and on the east by the [[Peninsular Ranges]] and is centered on the coordinates {{Coord|27.74|-113.6|type:landmark_region:MX|display=inline,title}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=http:%2F%2Fglobalspecies.org%2Fkmlserver%2fgetkml%2fna1301 |title= Baja California desert ecoregion |author= [http://www.worldwildlife.org/ World Wildlife Fund] |work= |publisher= globalspecies.org|accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; North of 30° north latitude, the Baja California desert transitions to the [[California chaparral and woodlands]]. The southern tip of the peninsula lies within the [[San Lucan xeric scrub]] ecoregion. To the north are the [[Sierra Juárez and San Pedro Mártir pine-oak forests]], where a number of tree species are found including the near-threatened [[California Fan Palm]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate is dry and [[Subtropics|subtropical]]. Although rainfall is low, the Pacific Ocean provides some humidity and moderates the temperature compared to the [[Sonoran desert]], which lies on the east slope of the Peninsular Ranges.

The Baja California Desert ecoregion occurs on the western portion of the Baja California peninsula and occupies most of the Mexican states of Baja California Sur and Baja California. Elevation is variable, ranging from mountain ranges on the western central part (1000 - 1500m), plains of median elevation (300 – 600m), and vast extensions of coastal dunes.

==Flora==
The ecoregion is mostly covered by [[xeric]] [[shrub]]s, which create varying associations based on elevation and soil conditions. The ecoregion has close to 500 [[species]] of [[vascular plant]]s, of which a number are [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]], for example the [[Boojum tree]] or [[Creeping Devil]].

In [[physics]], the '''Coriolis force''' is an [[fictitious force|inertial force]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mechanical Universe: Mechanics and Heat, Advanced Edition |edition=illustrated |first1=Steven C. |last1=Frautschi |first2=Richard P. |last2=Olenick |first3=Tom M. |last3=Apostol |first4=David L. |last4=Goodstein |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-521-71590-4 |page=208 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTnxQGJ1fHMC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTnxQGJ1fHMC&amp;pg=PA208 Extract of page 208]&lt;/ref&gt; that seems to act on objects that are in motion within a [[rotating reference frame|frame of reference]] that rotates with respect to an inertial frame. In a reference frame with [[clockwise]] rotation, the force acts to the left of the motion of the object. In one with anticlockwise (or counterclockwise) rotation, the force acts to the right. [[Deflection (physics)|Deflection]] of an object due to the Coriolis force is called the '''Coriolis effect'''. Though recognized previously by others, the mathematical expression for the Coriolis force appeared in an 1835 paper by French scientist [[Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis]], in connection with the theory of [[water wheel]]s. Early in the 20th century, the term ''Coriolis force'' began to be used in connection with [[meteorology]].

[[Newton's laws of motion]] describe the motion of an object in an [[inertial frame of reference|inertial (non-accelerating) frame of reference]]. When Newton's laws are transformed to a rotating frame of reference, the Coriolis force and [[centrifugal force]] appear. Both forces are proportional to the [[mass]] of the object. The Coriolis force is proportional to the rotation rate and the centrifugal force is proportional to the square of the rotation rate. The Coriolis force acts in a direction perpendicular to the rotation axis and to the velocity of the body in the rotating frame and is proportional to the object's speed in the rotating frame (more precisely, to the component of its velocity that is perpendicular to the axis of rotation). The centrifugal force acts outwards in the radial direction and is proportional to the distance of the body from the axis of the rotating frame. These additional forces are termed inertial forces, [[fictitious force]]s or ''pseudo forces''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical Mechanics: With introduction to Nonlinear Oscillations and Chaos|last=Bhatia|first=V.B.|publisher=Narosa Publishing House|year=1997|page=201|isbn=81-7319-105-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They allow the application of Newton's laws to a rotating system. They are correction factors that do not exist in a non-accelerating or inertial reference frame.

In popular (non-technical) usage of the term "Coriolis effect", the rotating reference frame implied is almost always the [[Earth]]. Because the Earth spins, Earth-bound observers need to account for the Coriolis force to correctly analyze the motion of objects.  The Earth completes one rotation per day, so for motions of everyday objects the Coriolis force is usually quite small compared to other forces; its effects generally become noticeable only for motions occurring over large distances and long periods of time, such as large-scale movement of air in the atmosphere or water in the ocean. Such motions are constrained by the surface of the Earth, so only the horizontal component of the Coriolis force is generally important. This force causes moving objects on the surface of the Earth to be deflected to the right (with respect to the direction of travel) in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and to the left in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. The horizontal deflection effect is greater near the [[Geographical pole|poles]], since the effective rotation rate about a local vertical axis is largest there, and decreases to zero at the [[equator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coriolis Effect: Because the Earth turns – Teacher's guide|url=http://www.ametsoc.org/amsedu/proj_atm/modules/Coriolis.pdf|website=Project ATMOSPHERE|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than flowing directly from areas of high pressure to low pressure, as they would in a non-rotating system, winds and currents tend to flow to the right of this direction north of the [[equator]] and to the left of this direction south of it. This effect is responsible for the rotation of large [[Cyclone#Structure|cyclones]] &lt;!--Don't add tornadoes here; the Coriolis effect is not directly responsible for tornadoes--&gt;(see [[#Meteorology|Coriolis effects in meteorology]]).

For an intuitive explanation of the origin of the Coriolis force, consider an object, constrained to follow the Earth's surface and moving northward in the northern hemisphere.  Viewed from outer space, the object does not appear to go due north, but has an eastward motion (it rotates around toward the right along with the surface of the Earth).  The further north you go, the smaller the "horizontal diameter" of the Earth (the minimum distance from the surface point to the axis of rotation, which is in a plane orthogonal to the axis), and so the slower the eastward motion of its surface.  As the object moves north, to higher latitudes, it has a tendency to maintain the eastward speed it started with (rather than slowing down to match the reduced eastward speed of local objects on the Earth's surface), so it veers east (i.e. to the right of its initial motion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Solar Energy at Urban Scale |first1=Benoit |last1=Beckers |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-118-61436-5 |page=116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GAOnjP4k7SQC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=GAOnjP4k7SQC&amp;pg=PT116 Extract of page 116]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Energy and the Environment: Resources, Technologies, and Impacts |first1=Reza |last1=Toossi |publisher=Verve Publishers |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4276-1867-2 |page=48 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-cb2EyrWbg0C}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=-cb2EyrWbg0C&amp;pg=PA48 Extract of page 48]&lt;/ref&gt; Though not obvious from this example, which considers northward motion, the horizontal deflection occurs equally for objects moving east or west (or any other direction).&lt;ref&gt;[https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences/12-090-introduction-to-fluid-motions-sediment-transport-and-current-generated-sedimentary-structures-fall-2006/course-textbook/ch7.pdf MIT: Flow in rotating environments]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ball is released from ''F''. The top of the tower moves faster than its base, so while the ball falls, the base of the tower moves to ''I'', but the ball, which has the eastward speed of the tower's top, outruns the tower's base and lands further to the east at ''L''.]]

Italian scientist [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]] and his assistant [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi]] described the effect in connection with artillery in the 1651 ''Almagestum Novum'', writing that rotation of the Earth should cause a cannonball fired to the north to deflect to the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1063/PT.3.1195|title=Coriolis effect, two centuries before Coriolis|year=2011|last1=Graney|first1=Christopher M.|journal=Physics Today|volume=64|issue=8|page=8|bibcode= 2011PhT....64h...8G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1674 [[Claude François Milliet Dechales]] described in his ''Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus'' how the rotation of the Earth should cause a deflection in the trajectories of both falling bodies and projectiles aimed toward one of the planet's poles.

Coriolis divided these supplementary forces into two categories. The second category contained a force that arises from the [[cross product]] of the [[angular velocity]] of a [[coordinate system]] and the projection of a particle's [[velocity]] into a plane [[perpendicular]] to the system's [[axis of rotation]]. Coriolis referred to this force as the "compound centrifugal force" due to its analogies with the [[centrifugal force]] already considered in category one.&lt;ref&gt;Dugas, René and J. R.

==Formula==
{{See also|Fictitious force}}

In non-vector terms: at a given rate of rotation of the observer, the magnitude of the Coriolis acceleration of the object is proportional to the velocity of the object and also to the sine of the angle between the direction of movement of the object and the axis of rotation.

The vector formula for the magnitude and direction of the Coriolis acceleration is derived through vector analysis and is&lt;ref name=Coffin&gt;{{cite book|last=Coffin|first=Joseph George David|title=Vector Analysis: An Introduction to Vector-methods and Their Various Applications to Physics and Mathematics|year=1911|publisher=J. Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|page=198|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mgGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ a}_C = 2 \, \boldsymbol{v \times  \Omega}&lt;/math&gt;

where (here and below) &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ a}_C&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration of the particle in the rotating system, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{v}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the particle with respect to the rotating system, and '''Ω''' is the [[angular velocity]] vector having magnitude equal to the rotation rate ω, with direction along the axis of rotation of the rotating reference frame, and the &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \times &lt;/math&gt;
symbol represents the [[cross product]] operator.

The equation may be multiplied by the mass of the relevant object to produce the Coriolis force:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ F}_C = 2 \, m \, \boldsymbol{v \times  \Omega}&lt;/math&gt;.

See ''[[fictitious force]]'' for a derivation.

The ''Coriolis effect'' is the behavior added by the ''Coriolis acceleration''. The formula implies that the Coriolis acceleration is perpendicular both to the direction of the velocity of the moving mass and to the frame's rotation axis. So in particular:
* if the velocity is parallel to the rotation axis, the Coriolis acceleration is zero. (For example, on Earth, this situation occurs for a body on the equator moving north or south relative to Earth's surface.)
* if the velocity is straight inward to the axis, the acceleration is in the direction of local rotation. (For example, on Earth, this situation occurs for a body on the equator falling downward, as in the Dechales illustration above, where the falling ball travels further to the east than does the tower.)
* if the velocity is straight outward from the axis, the acceleration is against the direction of local rotation. (In the tower example, a ball launched upward would move toward the west.)
* if the velocity is in the direction of local rotation, the acceleration is outward from the axis. (For example, on Earth, this situation occurs for a body on the equator moving east relative to Earth's surface. It would move upward as seen by an observer on the surface. This effect (see Eötvös effect below) was discussed by Galileo Galilei in 1632 and by Riccioli in 1651.&lt;ref name=Graney2015&gt;{{cite book|last=Graney|first=Christopher M.|title=Setting Aside All Authority: Giovanni Battista Riccioli and the Science Against Copernicus in the Age of Galileo|year=2015|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|location=Notre Dame, Indiana|pages=115–125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6r_nrQEACAAJ|isbn=9780268029883}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* if the velocity is against the direction of local rotation, the acceleration is inward to the axis. (On Earth, this situation occurs for a body on the equator moving west, which would deflect downward as seen by an observer.)

==Causes==
The Coriolis force exists only when one uses a rotating reference frame. In the rotating frame it behaves exactly like a real force (that is to say, it causes acceleration and has real effects). However, the Coriolis force is a consequence of [[inertia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Climate and Weather |editor1-first=Stephen H. |editor1-last=Schneider |editor2-first=Terry L. |editor2-last=Root |editor3-first=Michael |editor3-last=Mastrandrea |year=2011 |page=310 |volume=3 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is not attributable to an identifiable originating body, as is the case for electromagnetic or nuclear forces, for example. From an analytical viewpoint, to use [[Newton's second law]] in a rotating system, the Coriolis force is mathematically necessary, but it disappears in a non-accelerating, inertial frame of reference. For example, consider two children on opposite sides of a spinning roundabout ([[Merry-go-round]] ), who are throwing a ball to each other. From the children's point of view, this ball's path is curved sideways by the Coriolis force. Suppose the roundabout spins anticlockwise when viewed from above. From the thrower's perspective, the deflection is to the right.&lt;ref name="CalvinandHobbs"&gt;{{cite book|title=Atmospheric Science: An Introductory Survey|author1=John M. Wallace |author2=Peter V. Hobbs |pages=368–371|year=1977|publisher=Academic Press, Inc.|isbn=0-12-732950-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the non-thrower's perspective, deflection is to the left. ''For a mathematical formulation see [[Fictitious force#Mathematical derivation of fictitious forces|Mathematical derivation of fictitious forces]].'' In meteorology, a rotating frame (the Earth) with its Coriolis force provides a more natural framework for explanation of air movements than a non-rotating, inertial frame without Coriolis forces.&lt;ref name=Barry0&gt;{{Cite book|title=Atmosphere, Weather and Climate |author1=Roger Graham Barry |author2=Richard J.

The acceleration entering the Coriolis force arises from two sources of change in velocity that result from rotation: the first is the change of the velocity of an object in time. The same velocity (in an inertial frame of reference where the normal laws of physics apply) is seen as different velocities at different times in a rotating frame of reference. The apparent acceleration is proportional to the angular velocity of the reference frame (the rate at which the coordinate axes change direction), and to the component of velocity of the object in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation. This gives a term &lt;math&gt;-\boldsymbol\Omega\times\boldsymbol v&lt;/math&gt;. The minus sign arises from the traditional definition of the cross product ([[right-hand rule]]), and from the sign convention for angular velocity vectors.

The second is the change of velocity in space. Different positions in a rotating frame of reference have different velocities (as seen from an inertial frame of reference). For an object to move in a straight line, it must accelerate so that its velocity changes from point to point by the same amount as the velocities of the frame of reference. The force is proportional to the angular velocity (which determines the relative speed of two different points in the rotating frame of reference), and to the component of the velocity of the object in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation (which determines how quickly it moves between those points). This also gives a term &lt;math&gt;-\boldsymbol\Omega\times\boldsymbol v&lt;/math&gt;.

==Length scales and the Rossby number==
{{Further|Rossby number}}
The time, space and velocity scales are important in determining the importance of the Coriolis force. Whether rotation is important in a system can be determined by its [[Rossby number]], which is the ratio of the velocity, ''U'', of a system to the product of the [[Coriolis parameter]],&lt;math&gt;f = 2 \omega \sin \varphi \,&lt;/math&gt;, and the length scale, ''L'', of the motion:
:&lt;math&gt;Ro = \frac{U}{fL}.&lt;/math&gt;
The Rossby number is the ratio of inertial to Coriolis forces. A small Rossby number indicates a system is strongly affected by Coriolis forces, and a large Rossby number indicates a system in which inertial forces dominate. For example, in tornadoes, the Rossby number is large, in low-pressure systems it is low, and in oceanic systems it is around 1. As a result, in tornadoes the Coriolis force is negligible, and balance is between pressure and centrifugal forces. In low-pressure systems, centrifugal force is negligible and balance is between Coriolis and pressure forces. In the oceans all three forces are comparable.&lt;ref name=Lakshmi&gt;{{Cite book|title=Numerical Models of Oceans and Oceanic Processes |author1=Lakshmi H. Kantha |author2=Carol Anne Clayson |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=0-12-434068-7 |year=2000 |page=103 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gps9JXtd3owC&amp;pg=PA103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baseball players don't care about which hemisphere they're playing in. However, an unguided missile obeys exactly the same physics as a baseball, but can travel far enough and be in the air long enough to experience the effect of Coriolis force. Long-range shells in the Northern Hemisphere landed close to, but to the right of, where they were aimed until this was noted. (Those fired in the Southern Hemisphere landed to the left.) In fact, it was this effect that first got the attention of Coriolis himself.&lt;ref name=Butz&gt;{{cite book|title=Science of Earth Systems |author=Stephen D.

===Cannon on turntable===

{{See also|Fictitious force#Crossing a carousel}}
[[File:Target on turntable.PNG|thumb|300px|Cannon at the center of a rotating turntable. To hit the target located at position 1 on the perimeter at time ''t'' = 0&amp;nbsp;s, the cannon must be aimed ahead of the target at angle θ. That way, by the time the cannonball reaches position 3 on the periphery, the target is also at that position. In an inertial frame of reference, the cannonball travels a straight radial path to the target (curve ''y''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;). However, in the frame of the turntable, the path is arched (curve ''y''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;), as also shown in the figure.]]
[[File:Trajectory for three angles of launch.PNG|thumb|300px|Successful trajectory of cannonball as seen from the turntable for three angles of launch θ. Plotted points are for the same equally spaced times steps on each curve. Cannonball speed ''v'' is held constant and angular rate of rotation ω is varied to achieve a successful "hit" for selected θ. For example, for a radius of 1 m and a cannonball speed of 1 m/s, the time of flight ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 s, and ''ωt''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''θ'' → ''ω'' and ''θ'' have the same numerical value if ''θ'' is expressed in radians. The wider spacing of the plotted points as the target is approached show the speed of the cannonball is accelerating as seen on the turntable, due to fictitious Coriolis and centrifugal forces.]]
[[File:Vector relationships.PNG|thumb|300px|Acceleration components at an earlier time (top) and at arrival time at the target (bottom)]]
[[File:Cannon force components.PNG|thumb|300px|Coriolis acceleration, centrifugal acceleration and net acceleration vectors at three selected points on the trajectory as seen on the turntable.]]

The animation at the top of this article is a classic illustration of Coriolis force. Another visualization of the Coriolis and centrifugal forces is [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49JwbrXcPjc this animation clip].

Given the radius ''R'' of the turntable in that animation, the rate of angular rotation ω, and the speed of the cannonball (assumed constant) ''v'', the correct angle θ to aim so as to hit the target at the edge of the turntable can be calculated.

The inertial frame of reference provides one way to handle the question: calculate the time to interception, which is ''t&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''R'' / ''v'' . Then, the turntable revolves an angle ω ''t&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' in this time. If the cannon is pointed an angle θ = ω ''t&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ω ''R'' / ''v'', then the cannonball arrives at the periphery at position number 3 at the same time as the target.

No discussion of Coriolis force can arrive at this solution as simply, so the reason to treat this problem is to demonstrate Coriolis formalism in an easily visualized situation.

====Trajectory in the inertial frame====
The trajectory in the inertial frame (denoted ''A'') is a straight line radial path at angle θ. The position of the cannonball in (''x'', ''y'') coordinates at time ''t'' is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_A (t) = vt\ \left( \cos\theta,\ \sin\theta \right) \ . &lt;/math&gt;
In the turntable frame (denoted ''B''), the ''x''- ''y'' axes rotate at angular rate ω, so the trajectory becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_B (t) = vt\ \left( \cos ( \theta - \omega t), \ \sin ( \theta - \omega t)\right) \ , &lt;/math&gt;
and three examples of this result are plotted in the figure.

=====Accelerations=====

======Components of acceleration======
To determine the components of acceleration, a general expression is used from the article [[fictitious force]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{a}_B =
     \mathbf{a}_A \;-\;
    2\boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \mathbf{v}_B \;-\;
     \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \left(\boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \mathbf{r}_B\right) \;-\;
     \frac{d\boldsymbol{\Omega}}{dt} \times \mathbf{r}_B
&lt;/math&gt;

in which the term in '''Ω''' × '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the Coriolis acceleration and the term in '''Ω''' × ('''Ω''' × '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;) is the centrifugal acceleration. The results are (let α = θ − ω''t''):
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \mathbf{r}_B &amp;=
    \;\begin{vmatrix}
      \boldsymbol{i} &amp; \boldsymbol{j} &amp; \boldsymbol{k} \\
                   0 &amp;              0 &amp;         \omega \\
        tv\cos\alpha &amp;   tv\sin\alpha &amp;              0
    \end{vmatrix}\; =
    \omega t\, v\left(-\sin\alpha, \cos\alpha \right)\ , \\
  \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \left(\boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \mathbf{r}_B\right) &amp;=
    \;\begin{vmatrix}
            \boldsymbol{i} &amp;      \boldsymbol{j} &amp; \boldsymbol{k} \\
                         0 &amp;                   0 &amp;         \omega \\
      -\omega tv\sin\alpha &amp; \omega tv\cos\alpha &amp;              0
    \end{vmatrix}\; =
    \omega^2 t\, v\left(-\cos\alpha, -\sin\alpha\right),
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

======Producing accelerations======
Producing a centrifugal acceleration:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{a}_\text{Cfgl} = \omega^2 vt\left(\cos\alpha, \ \sin\alpha\right) = \omega^2 \mathbf{r}_B(t) \ .&lt;/math&gt;

Also:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathbf{v}_B = \frac{d\mathbf{r}_B(t)}{dt} &amp;=
    (v\cos\alpha + \omega tv\sin\alpha, \ v\sin\alpha - \omega tv\cos\alpha, \ 0)\ ,\\
  \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \mathbf{v}_B &amp;=
    \begin{vmatrix}
              \boldsymbol{i}   &amp;            \boldsymbol{j} &amp;   \boldsymbol{k} \\
                             0 &amp;                         0 &amp;           \omega \\
               v\cos\alpha +{} &amp;           v\sin\alpha -{} &amp;                  \\
      \quad\omega tv\sin\alpha &amp;  \quad\omega tv\cos\alpha &amp;                0
    \end{vmatrix}\ ,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

producing a Coriolis acceleration:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathbf{a}_\text{Cor}
    &amp;= -2\left[ -\omega v\left(\sin\alpha - \omega t\cos\alpha\right), \ \omega v\left(\cos\alpha + \omega t \sin \alpha \right) \right] \\
    &amp;=  2\omega v\left(\sin\alpha, \ -\cos\alpha\right) - 2\omega^2\mathbf{r}_B(t)\ .
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These accelerations are shown in the diagrams for a particular example.

It is seen that the Coriolis acceleration not only cancels the centrifugal acceleration, but together they provide a net "centripetal", radially inward component of acceleration (that is, directed toward the center of rotation):&lt;ref name=caution&gt;Here the description "radially inward" means "toward the axis of rotation". That direction is ''not'' toward the [[osculating circle|center of curvature]] of the path, however, which is the direction of the true centripetal force. Hence, the quotation marks on "centripetal".&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a_{\mathrm{Cptl}}} = -\omega^2 \mathbf{r_B}(t) \ , &lt;/math&gt;

and an additional component of acceleration perpendicular to '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''):
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_{C\perp} = 2\omega v\left(\sin\alpha, \ -\cos\alpha\right)\ .&lt;/math&gt;

The "centripetal" component of acceleration resembles that for [[circular motion]] at radius ''r''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, while the perpendicular component is velocity dependent, increasing with the radial velocity ''v'' and directed to the right of the velocity. The situation could be described as a circular motion combined with an "apparent Coriolis acceleration" of 2ω''v''. However, this is a rough labelling: a careful designation of the true centripetal force refers to a [[Centripetal force#Local coordinates|local reference frame]] that employs the directions normal and tangential to the path, not coordinates referred to the axis of rotation.

These results also can be obtained directly by two time differentiations of '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''). Agreement of the two approaches demonstrates that one could start from the general expression for fictitious acceleration above and derive the trajectories shown here. However, working from the acceleration to the trajectory is more complicated than the reverse procedure used here, which is made possible in this example by knowing the answer in advance.

As a result of this analysis an important point appears: ''all'' the fictitious accelerations must be included to obtain the correct trajectory. In particular, besides the Coriolis acceleration, the [[Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal force]] plays an essential role. It is easy to get the impression from verbal discussions of the cannonball problem, which focus on displaying the Coriolis effect particularly, that the Coriolis force is the only factor that must be considered,&lt;ref name=Owen&gt;{{cite book|title=Fundamentals of Scientific Mathematics |author=George E.

===Tossed ball on a rotating carousel===
[[File:Coriolis construction.JPG|thumb|300px|A carousel is rotating counter-clockwise. ''Left panel'': a ball is tossed by a thrower at 12:00 o'clock and travels in a straight line to the center of the carousel. While it travels, the thrower circles in a counter-clockwise direction. ''Right panel'': The ball's motion as seen by the thrower, who now remains at 12:00 o'clock, because there is no rotation from their viewpoint.]]

The figure illustrates a ball tossed from 12:00 o'clock toward the center of a counter-clockwise rotating carousel. On the left, the ball is seen by a stationary observer above the carousel, and the ball travels in a straight line to the center, while the ball-thrower rotates counter-clockwise with the carousel. On the right the ball is seen by an observer rotating with the carousel, so the ball-thrower appears to stay at 12:00 o'clock. The figure shows how the trajectory of the ball as seen by the rotating observer can be constructed.

On the left, two arrows locate the ball relative to the ball-thrower. One of these arrows is from the thrower to the center of the carousel (providing the ball-thrower's line of sight), and the other points from the center of the carousel to the ball. (This arrow gets shorter as the ball approaches the center.) A shifted version of the two arrows is shown dotted.

On the right is shown this same dotted pair of arrows, but now the pair are rigidly rotated so the arrow corresponding to the line of sight of the ball-thrower toward the center of the carousel is aligned with 12:00 o'clock. The other arrow of the pair locates the ball relative to the center of the carousel, providing the position of the ball as seen by the rotating observer. By following this procedure for several positions, the trajectory in the rotating frame of reference is established as shown by the curved path in the right-hand panel.

The ball travels in the air, and there is no net force upon it. To the stationary observer the ball follows a straight-line path, so there is no problem squaring this trajectory with zero net force. However, the rotating observer sees a ''curved'' path. Kinematics insists that a force (pushing to the ''right'' of the instantaneous direction of travel for a ''counter-clockwise'' rotation) must be present to cause this curvature, so the rotating observer is forced to invoke a combination of centrifugal and Coriolis forces to provide the net force required to cause the curved trajectory.

===Bounced ball===
[[File:Points of view.PNG|thumb|300px|Bird's-eye view of carousel. The carousel rotates clockwise. Two viewpoints are illustrated: that of the camera at the center of rotation rotating with the carousel (left panel) and that of the inertial (stationary) observer (right panel). Both observers agree at any given time just how far the ball is from the center of the carousel, but not on its orientation. Time intervals are 1/10 of time from launch to bounce.]]

The figure describes a more complex situation where the tossed ball on a turntable bounces off the edge of the carousel and then returns to the tosser, who catches the ball. The effect of Coriolis force on its trajectory is shown again as seen by two observers: an observer (referred to as the "camera") that rotates with the carousel, and an inertial observer. The figure shows a bird's-eye view based upon the same ball speed on forward and return paths. Within each circle, plotted dots show the same time points. In the left panel, from the camera's viewpoint at the center of rotation, the tosser (smiley face) and the rail both are at fixed locations, and the ball makes a very considerable arc on its travel toward the rail, and takes a more direct route on the way back. From the ball tosser's viewpoint, the ball seems to return more quickly than it went (because the tosser is rotating toward the ball on the return flight).

On the carousel, instead of tossing the ball straight at a rail to bounce back, the tosser must throw the ball toward the right of the target and the ball then seems to the camera to bear continuously to the left of its direction of travel to hit the rail (''left'' because the carousel is turning ''clockwise''). The ball appears to bear to the left from direction of travel on both inward and return trajectories. The curved path demands this observer to recognize a leftward net force on the ball. (This force is "fictitious" because it disappears for a stationary observer, as is discussed shortly.) For some angles of launch, a path has portions where the trajectory is approximately radial, and Coriolis force is primarily responsible for the apparent deflection of the ball (centrifugal force is radial from the center of rotation, and causes little deflection on these segments). When a path curves away from radial, however, centrifugal force contributes significantly to deflection.

The ball's path through the air is straight when viewed by observers standing on the ground (right panel). In the right panel (stationary observer), the ball tosser (smiley face) is at 12 o'clock and the rail the ball bounces from is at position one (1). From the inertial viewer's standpoint, positions one (1), two (2), three (3) are occupied in sequence. At position 2 the ball strikes the rail, and at position 3 the ball returns to the tosser. Straight-line paths are followed because the ball is in free flight, so this observer requires that no net force is applied.

==Applied to the Earth==
An important case where the Coriolis force is observed involves the rotating Earth together with its atmosphere. The atmosphere rotates in sync with the surface of the earth due to frictional forces between the air molecules of the atmosphere (air viscosity) and the earth's surface which causes the air molecules to be carried along and move in step with the earth's surface. Unless otherwise stated, directions of forces and motion apply to the Northern Hemisphere.

===Intuitive explanation===
As the Earth turns around its axis, everything attached to it, including the atmosphere, turns with it (imperceptibly to our senses). An object that is moving without being dragged along with the surface rotation or atmosphere such as an object in ballistic flight or an independent air mass within the atmosphere, travels in a straight motion over the turning Earth. From our rotating perspective on the planet, the direction of motion of an object in ballistic flight changes as it moves, bending in the opposite direction to our actual motion. When viewed from a stationary point in space directly above the north pole, any land feature in the Northern Hemisphere turns anticlockwise—and, fixing our gaze on that location, any other location in that hemisphere rotates around it the same way. The traced [[ground path]] of a freely moving body in ballistic flight traveling from one point to another therefore bends the opposite way, clockwise, which is conventionally labeled as "right," where it will be if the direction of motion is considered "ahead," and "down" is defined naturally.

===Rotating sphere===
[[File:Earth coordinates.svg|thumb|Coordinate system at latitude φ with ''x''-axis east, ''y''-axis north and ''z''-axis upward (that is, radially outward from center of sphere).]]


Consider a location with latitude ''φ'' on a sphere that is rotating around the north-south axis.&lt;ref name=Menke&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geophysical Theory |author1=William Menke |author2=Dallas Abbott |pages=124–126 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XP3R_pVnOoEC&amp;pg=PA120|isbn=0-231-06792-5 |year=1990 |publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local coordinate system is set up with the ''x'' axis horizontally due east, the ''y'' axis horizontally due north and the ''z'' axis vertically upwards. The rotation vector, velocity of movement and Coriolis acceleration expressed in this local coordinate system (listing components in the order east (''e''), north (''n'') and upward (''u'')) are:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ \Omega} = \omega \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \cos \varphi \\ \sin \varphi \end{pmatrix}\ ,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_e \\ v_n \\ v_u \end{pmatrix}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ a}_C =-2\boldsymbol{\Omega \times v}= 2\,\omega\, \begin{pmatrix} v_n \sin \varphi-v_u \cos \varphi \\ -v_e \sin \varphi \\ v_e \cos\varphi\end{pmatrix}\ .&lt;/math&gt;

When considering atmospheric or oceanic dynamics, the vertical velocity is small, and the vertical component of the Coriolis acceleration is small compared to gravity. For such cases, only the horizontal (east and north) components matter. The restriction of the above to the horizontal plane is (setting ''v&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0):

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{ v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_e \\ v_n\end{pmatrix}\ ,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ a}_c = \begin{pmatrix} v_n \\ -v_e\end{pmatrix}\ f\ , &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f = 2 \omega \sin \varphi \,&lt;/math&gt; is called the Coriolis parameter.

By setting ''v&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0, it can be seen immediately that (for positive φ and ω) a movement due east results in an acceleration due south. Similarly, setting ''v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0, it is seen that a movement due north results in an acceleration due east. In general, observed horizontally, looking along the direction of the movement causing the acceleration, the acceleration always is turned 90° to the right and of the same size regardless of the horizontal orientation.

As a different case, consider equatorial motion setting φ = 0°. In this case, '''Ω''' is parallel to the north or ''n''-axis, and:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ \Omega} = \omega \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\ ,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_e \\ v_n \\ v_u \end{pmatrix}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ a}_C =-2\boldsymbol{\Omega \times v}= 2\,\omega\, \begin{pmatrix}-v_u \\0 \\ v_e \end{pmatrix}\ .&lt;/math&gt;

Accordingly, an eastward motion (that is, in the same direction as the rotation of the sphere) provides an upward acceleration known as the [[Eötvös effect]], and an upward motion produces an acceleration due west.

Perhaps the most important impact of the Coriolis effect is in the large-scale dynamics of the oceans and the atmosphere. In meteorology and [[oceanography]], it is convenient to postulate a rotating frame of reference wherein the Earth is stationary. In accommodation of that provisional postulation, the [[Centrifugal force|centrifugal]] and Coriolis forces are introduced. Their relative importance is determined by the applicable [[Coriolis effect#Length scales and the Rossby number|Rossby numbers]]. [[Tornado]]es have high Rossby numbers, so, while tornado-associated centrifugal forces are quite substantial, Coriolis forces associated with tornadoes are for practical purposes negligible.&lt;ref name=Holton2&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology |year=2004 |author=James R.

Because surface ocean currents are driven by the movement of wind over the water's surface, the Coriolis force also affects the movement of ocean currents and [[hurricane|cyclones]] as well. Many of the ocean's largest currents circulate around warm, high-pressure areas called [[gyre]]s. Though the circulation is not as significant as that in the air, the deflection caused by the Coriolis effect is what creates the spiraling pattern in these gyres. The spiraling wind pattern helps the hurricane form. The stronger the force from the Coriolis effect, the faster the wind spins and picks up additional energy, increasing the strength of the hurricane.&lt;ref name="Coriolis effect"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brinney|first=Amanda|title=Coriolis Effect – An Overview of the Coriolis Effect|url=http://geography.about.com/od/physicalgeography/a/coriolis.htm|publisher=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Air within high-pressure systems rotates in a direction such that the Coriolis force is directed radially inwards, and nearly balanced by the outwardly radial pressure gradient. As a result, air travels clockwise around high pressure in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. Air around low-pressure rotates in the opposite direction, so that the Coriolis force is directed radially outward and nearly balances an inwardly radial [[pressure gradient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/coriolis-effect/|title=Coriolis effect|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-08-17|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

====Flow around a low-pressure area====
{{Main|Low-pressure area}}
If a low-pressure area forms in the atmosphere, air tends to flow in towards it, but is deflected perpendicular to its velocity by the Coriolis force. A system of equilibrium can then establish itself creating circular movement, or a cyclonic flow. Because the Rossby number is low, the force balance is largely between the [[pressure-gradient force]] acting towards the low-pressure area and the Coriolis force acting away from the center of the low pressure.

Instead of flowing down the gradient, large scale motions in the atmosphere and ocean tend to occur perpendicular to the pressure gradient. This is known as [[geostrophic flow]].&lt;ref name=Barry&gt;{{cite book|title=Atmosphere, Weather and Climate |author1=Roger Graham Barry |author2=Richard J. Chorley |url=https://books.google.com/?id=MUQOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA115|page=115 |isbn=0-415-27171-1 |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a non-rotating planet, fluid would flow along the straightest possible line, quickly eliminating pressure gradients. Note that the geostrophic balance is thus very different from the case of "inertial motions" (see below), which explains why mid-latitude cyclones are larger by an order of magnitude than inertial circle flow would be.

This pattern of deflection, and the direction of movement, is called [[Buys-Ballot's law]]. In the atmosphere, the pattern of flow is called a [[cyclone]]. In the Northern Hemisphere the direction of movement around a low-pressure area is anticlockwise. In the Southern Hemisphere, the direction of movement is clockwise because the rotational dynamics is a mirror image there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Nelson | first = Stephen | title = Tropical Cyclones (Hurricanes) | work = Wind Systems: Low Pressure Centers | publisher = [[Tulane University]] | date = Fall 2014 | url = http://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/New_Orleans_and_Hurricanes/tropical_cyclones.htm | accessdate = 2016-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At high altitudes, outward-spreading air rotates in the opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA04384 Cloud Spirals and Outflow in Tropical Storm Katrina] from [[Earth Observatory]] ([[NASA]])&lt;/ref&gt; Cyclones rarely form along the equator due to the weak Coriolis effect present in this region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XRxzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA326|title=Encyclopedia of Disaster Relief|last=Penuel|first=K.

====Inertial circles====
An air or water mass moving with speed &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; subject only to the Coriolis force travels in a circular trajectory called an 'inertial circle'. Since the force is directed at right angles to the motion of the particle, it moves with a constant speed around a circle whose radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is given by:
: &lt;math&gt;R= \frac {v}{f}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the Coriolis parameter &lt;math&gt;2 \Omega \sin \varphi&lt;/math&gt;, introduced above (where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the latitude). The time taken for the mass to complete a full circle is therefore &lt;math&gt;2\pi/f&lt;/math&gt;. The Coriolis parameter typically has a mid-latitude value of about 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; hence for a typical atmospheric speed of {{convert|10|m/s|mph|sp=us|abbr=on}} the radius is {{convert|100|km|0|sp=us|abbr=on}}, with a period of about 17&amp;nbsp;hours. For an ocean current with a typical speed of {{convert|10|cm/s|mph|sp=us|abbr=on}}, the radius of an inertial circle is {{convert|1|km|1|sp=us|abbr=on}}. These inertial circles are clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere (where trajectories are bent to the right) and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.

If the rotating system is a parabolic turntable, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is constant and the trajectories are exact circles. On a rotating planet, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; varies with latitude and the paths of particles do not form exact circles. Since the parameter &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; varies as the sine of the latitude, the radius of the oscillations associated with a given speed are smallest at the poles (latitude = ±90°), and increase toward the equator.&lt;ref name=Marshall2&gt;{{Cite book|title=p. 98 |author1=John Marshall |author2=R. Alan Plumb |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aTGYbmVaA_gC&amp;pg=PA98|isbn=0-12-558691-4 |year=2007 |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Amsterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other terrestrial effects====
The Coriolis effect strongly affects the large-scale oceanic and [[atmospheric circulation]], leading to the formation of robust features like [[jet stream]]s and [[western boundary current]]s. Such features are in [[geostrophic]] balance, meaning that the Coriolis and ''pressure gradient'' forces balance each other. Coriolis acceleration is also responsible for the propagation of many types of waves in the ocean and atmosphere, including [[Rossby wave]]s and [[Kelvin wave]]s. It is also instrumental in the so-called [[Ekman layer|Ekman]] dynamics in the ocean, and in the establishment of the large-scale ocean flow pattern called the [[Sverdrup balance]].

===Eötvös effect===
{{Main|Eötvös effect}}
The practical impact of the "Coriolis effect" is mostly caused by the horizontal acceleration component produced by horizontal motion.

There are other components of the Coriolis effect. Westward-travelling objects are deflected downwards (feel heavier), while Eastward-travelling objects are deflected upwards (feel lighter).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |title=Fundamentals of Geophysics |edition=illustrated |first1=William |last1=Lowrie |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-521-46728-4 |page=45 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7vR2RJSIGVoC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=7vR2RJSIGVoC&amp;pg=PA45 Extract of page 45]&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as the [[Eötvös effect]]. This aspect of the Coriolis effect is greatest near the equator. The force produced by this effect is similar to the horizontal component, but the much larger vertical forces due to gravity and pressure mean that it is generally unimportant dynamically.

In addition, objects travelling upwards (''i.e.'', out) or downwards (''i.e.'', in) are deflected to the west or east respectively. This effect is also the greatest near the equator. Since vertical movement is usually of limited extent and duration, the size of the effect is smaller and requires precise instruments to detect. However, in the case of large changes of momentum, such as a spacecraft being launched into orbit, the effect becomes significant. The fastest and most fuel-efficient path to orbit is a launch from the equator that curves to a directly eastward heading.

Imagine a train that travels through a [[friction]]less railway line along the [[equator]]. Assume that, when in motion, it moves at the necessary speed to complete a trip around the world in one day (465&amp;nbsp;m/s).&lt;ref name=Persson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Persson |first1=Anders |title=The Coriolis Effect – a conflict between common sense and mathematics |page=8 |url=http://met.no/english/topics/nomek_2005/coriolis.pdf |accessdate=6 September 2015 |publisher=The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute |location=[[Norrköping]], [[Sweden]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050906101226/http://met.no/english/topics/nomek_2005/coriolis.pdf |archivedate=6 September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coriolis effect can be considered in three cases: when the train travels west, when it is at rest, and when it travels east. In each case, the Coriolis effect can be calculated from the [[Rotating reference frame|rotating frame of reference]] on [[Earth]] first, and then checked against a fixed [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial frame]]. The image below illustrates the three cases as viewed by an observer at rest in a (near) inertial frame from a fixed point above the North Pole along the Earth's [[rotation around a fixed axis|axis of rotation]]; the train are a few red pixels, fixed at the left side in the leftmost picture, moving in the others &lt;math&gt;(1\text{day}\; \overset{\land}{=}\; 8\text{s}):&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Earth and train 2FPS.gif|center|Earth and train]]

:1. The train travels toward the west: In that case, it moves against the direction of rotation. Therefore, on the Earth's rotating frame the Coriolis term is pointed inwards towards the axis of rotation (down). This additional force downwards should cause the train to be heavier while moving in that direction.
:*If one looks at this train from the fixed non-rotating frame on top of the center of the Earth, at that speed it remains stationary as the Earth spins beneath it. Hence, the only force acting on it is [[gravity of Earth|gravity]] and the reaction from the track. This force is greater (by 0.34%)&lt;ref name=Persson /&gt; than the force that the passengers and the train experience when at rest (rotating along with Earth). This difference is what the Coriolis effect accounts for in the rotating frame of reference.
:2. The train comes to a stop: From the point of view on the Earth's rotating frame, the velocity of the train is zero, thus the Coriolis force is also zero and the train and its passengers recuperate their usual weight.
:*From the fixed inertial frame of reference above Earth, the train now rotates along with the rest of the Earth. 0.34% of the force of gravity provides the [[centripetal force]] needed to achieve the circular motion on that frame of reference. The remaining force, as measured by a scale, makes the train and passengers "lighter" than in the previous case.
:3. The train travels east. In this case, because it moves in the direction of Earth's rotating frame, the Coriolis term is directed outward from the axis of rotation (up). This upward force makes the train seem lighter still than when at rest.
[[File:Eotvos efect on 10Kg.png|thumb|350 px|Graph of the force experienced by a 10-kilogram object as a function of its speed moving along Earth's equator (as measured within the rotating frame). (Positive force in the graph is directed upward. Positive speed is directed eastward and negative speed is directed westward).|alt=]]
:*From the fixed inertial frame of reference above Earth, the train travelling east now rotates at twice the rate as when it was at rest—so the amount of centripetal force needed to cause that circular path increases leaving less force from gravity to act on the track. This is what the Coriolis term accounts for on the previous paragraph.
:*As a final check one can imagine a frame of reference rotating along with the train. Such frame would be rotating at twice the angular velocity as Earth's rotating frame. The resulting [[centrifugal force]] component for that imaginary frame would be greater. Since the train and its passengers are at rest, that would be the only component in that frame explaining again why the train and the passengers are lighter than in the previous two cases.

This also explains why high speed projectiles that travel west are deflected down, and those that travel east are deflected up. This vertical component of the Coriolis effect is called the [[Eötvös effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rugai|first1=Nick|title=Computational Epistemology: From Reality To Wisdom|date=1 December 2012|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=1300477237|page=304|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KUIJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above example can be used to explain why the Eötvös effect starts diminishing when an object is travelling westward as its [[tangential speed]] increases above Earth's rotation (465&amp;nbsp;m/s). If the westward train in the above example increases speed, part of the force of gravity that pushes against the track accounts for the centripetal force needed to keep it in circular motion on the inertial frame. Once the train doubles its westward speed at 930&amp;nbsp;m/s that centripetal force becomes equal to the force the train experiences when it stops. From the inertial frame, in both cases it rotates at the same speed but in the opposite directions. Thus, the force is the same cancelling completely the Eötvös effect. Any object that moves westward at a speed above 930&amp;nbsp;m/s experiences an upward force instead. In the figure&lt;!--NOW THE FIGURE IS WRONG - PLEASE CORRECT THE GRAPH AND REMOVE THIS COMMENT--&gt;, the Eötvös effect is illustrated for a 10 kilogram object on the train at different speeds. The parabolic shape is because the [[centripetal force]] is proportional to the square of the tangential speed. On the inertial frame, the bottom of the parabola is centered at the origin. The offset is because this argument uses the Earth's rotating frame of reference. The graph shows that the Eötvös effect is not symmetrical, and that the resulting downward force experienced by an object that travels west at high velocity is less than the resulting upward force when it travels east at the same speed.

===Draining in bathtubs and toilets===
Contrary to popular misconception, water rotation in home bathrooms under ''normal'' circumstances is not related to the Coriolis effect or to the rotation of the Earth, and no consistent difference in rotation direction between toilet drainage in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres can be observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bad Coriolis | url = http://www.ems.psu.edu/~fraser/Bad/BadCoriolis.html | accessdate = 2016-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Flush Bosh | url = http://www.snopes.com/science/coriolis.asp | accessdate = 2016-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Does the rotation of the Earth affect toilets and baseball games? | url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/rotation-earth-toilet-baseball2.htm | accessdate = 2016-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Can somebody finally settle this question: Does water flowing down a drain spin in different directions depending on which hemisphere you're in?

Any rotation around the plug hole that is initially present accelerates as water moves inward.

The Coriolis force still affects the direction of the flow of water, but only minutely. Only if the water is so still that the effective rotation rate of the Earth is faster than that of the water relative to its container, and if externally applied torques (such as might be caused by flow over an uneven bottom surface) are small enough, the Coriolis effect may indeed determine the direction of the vortex. Without such careful preparation, the Coriolis effect is likely to be much smaller than various other influences on drain direction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8hOLs-bmiYYC&amp;pg=PA168|pages=168–9|title=Physics: A World View|author1=Larry D.

In 1908, the Austrian physicist [[Ottokar Tumlirz]] described careful and effective experiments that demonstrated the effect of the rotation of the Earth on the outflow of water through a central aperture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ein neuer physikalischer Beweis für die Achsendrehung der Erde|year=1908|last=Tumlirz|first=Ottokar|journal=Sitzungsberichte der math.-nat. Klasse der kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften IIa|volume=117|pages=819–841|authorlink=Ottokar Tumlirz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject was later popularized in a famous 1962 article in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', which described an experiment in which all other forces to the system were removed by filling a {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us|abbr=on}} tank with {{convert|300|USgal|L|sp=us|abbr=on}} of water and allowing it to settle for 24 hours (to allow any movement due to filling the tank to die away), in a room where the temperature had stabilized. The drain plug was then very slowly removed, and tiny pieces of floating wood were used to observe rotation. During the first 12 to 15 minutes, no rotation was observed. Then, a vortex appeared and consistently began to rotate in an anticlockwise direction (the experiment was performed in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], in the Northern Hemisphere). This was repeated and the results averaged to make sure the effect was real. The report noted that the vortex rotated, "about 30,000 times faster than the effective rotation of the Earth in 42° North (the experiment's location)". This shows that the small initial rotation due to the Earth is amplified by gravitational draining and conservation of angular momentum to become a rapid vortex and may be observed under carefully controlled [[laboratory]] conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/1961080b0|title=Bath-Tub Vortex|year=1962|last1=Shapiro|first1=Ascher H.|journal=Nature|volume=196|pages=1080–1081|bibcode=1962Natur.196.1080S|issue=4859}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/fluids/www/Shapiro/ncfmf.html (Vorticity, Part 1)].

===Ballistic trajectories===
The Coriolis force is important in [[External ballistics#Coriolis drift|external ballistics]] for calculating the trajectories of very long-range [[artillery]] shells. The most famous historical example was the [[Paris gun]], used by the Germans during [[World War I]] to bombard [[Paris]] from a range of about {{convert|120|km|sp=us|abbr=on}}. The Coriolis force minutely changes the trajectory of a bullet, affecting accuracy at extremely long distances. It is adjusted for by accurate long-distance shooters, such as snipers. At the latitude of [[Sacramento]] a 1000 yard shot would be deflected 3 inches to the right. There is also a vertical component, explained in the Eötvös effect section above, which causes westward shots to hit low, and eastward shots to hit high.&lt;ref name=Taylor0 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Do Snipers Compensate for the Earth’s Rotation? |url=https://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/columns/straight-dope/article/13039128/do-snipers-compensate-for-the-earthrsquos-rotation-what-the-coriolis |accessdate=16 July 2018 |work=Washington City Paper |date=25 June 2010 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of the Coriolis force on ballistic trajectories should not be confused with the curvature of the paths of missiles, satellites, and similar objects when the paths are plotted on two-dimensional (flat) maps, such as the [[Mercator projection]]. The projections of the three-dimensional curved surface of the Earth to a two-dimensional surface (the map) necessarily results in distorted features. The apparent curvature of the path is a consequence of the sphericity of the Earth and would occur even in a non-rotating frame.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

{{anchor|parabolic turntable}}To demonstrate the Coriolis effect, a parabolic turntable can be used.
On a flat turntable, the inertia of a co-rotating object forces it off the edge. However, if the turntable surface has the correct [[paraboloid]] (parabolic bowl) shape (see the figure) and rotates at the corresponding rate, the force components shown in the figure make the component of gravity tangential to the bowl surface exactly equal to the centripetal force necessary to keep the object rotating at its velocity and radius of curvature (assuming no friction). (See [[Centripetal force#Example: The banked turn|banked turn]].) This carefully contoured surface allows the Coriolis force to be displayed in isolation.&lt;ref name=parabola&gt;When a container of fluid is rotating on a turntable, the surface of the fluid naturally assumes the correct [[parabola|parabolic]] shape. This fact may be exploited to make a parabolic turntable by using a fluid that sets after several hours, such as a synthetic [[resin]]. For a video of the Coriolis effect on such a parabolic surface, see [http://www-paoc.mit.edu/labweb/lab5/gfd_v.htm Geophysical fluid dynamics lab demonstration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120121513/http://www-paoc.mit.edu/labweb/lab5/gfd_v.htm |date=20 November 2005 }} John Marshall, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=animation&gt;For a java applet of the Coriolis effect on such a parabolic surface, see [http://mensch.org/physlets/inosc.html Brian Fiedler] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321094211/http://www.mensch.org/physlets/inosc.html |date=21 March 2006 }} School of Meteorology at the University of Oklahoma.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discs cut from cylinders of [[dry ice]] can be used as pucks, moving around almost frictionlessly over the surface of the parabolic turntable, allowing effects of Coriolis on dynamic phenomena to show themselves. To get a view of the motions as seen from the reference frame rotating with the turntable, a video camera is attached to the turntable so as to co-rotate with the turntable, with results as shown in the figure. In the left panel of the figure, which is the viewpoint of a stationary observer, the gravitational force in the inertial frame pulling the object toward the center (bottom ) of the dish is proportional to the distance of the object from the center. A centripetal force of this form causes the elliptical motion. In the right panel, which shows the viewpoint of the rotating frame, the inward gravitational force in the rotating frame (the same force as in the inertial frame) is balanced by the outward centrifugal force (present only in the rotating frame). With these two forces balanced, in the rotating frame the only unbalanced force is Coriolis (also present only in the rotating frame), and the motion is an ''[[#Inertial circles|inertial circle]]''. Analysis and observation of circular motion in the rotating frame is a simplification compared to analysis or observation of elliptical motion in the inertial frame.

Because this reference frame rotates several times a minute rather than only once a day like the Earth, the Coriolis acceleration produced is many times larger and so easier to observe on small time and spatial scales than is the Coriolis acceleration caused by the rotation of the Earth.

In a manner of speaking, the Earth is analogous to such a turntable.&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;{{cite book|title=Atmosphere, Ocean, and Climate Dynamics: An Introductory Text|author1=John Marshall |author2=R. Alan Plumb |page=101 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aTGYbmVaA_gC&amp;pg=PA101|isbn=0-12-558691-4|year=2007|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rotation has caused the planet to settle on a spheroid shape, such that the normal force, the gravitational force and the centrifugal force exactly balance each other on a "horizontal" surface. (See [[equatorial bulge]].)

The Coriolis effect caused by the rotation of the Earth can be seen indirectly through the motion of a [[Foucault pendulum]].

==Coriolis effects in other areas==

===Coriolis flow meter===
A practical application of the Coriolis effect is the [[mass flow meter]], an instrument that measures the [[mass flow rate]] and [[density]] of a fluid flowing through a tube. The operating principle involves inducing a vibration of the tube through which the fluid passes. The vibration, though not completely circular, provides the rotating reference frame that gives rise to the Coriolis effect. While specific methods vary according to the design of the flow meter, sensors monitor and analyze changes in frequency, phase shift, and amplitude of the vibrating flow tubes. The changes observed represent the mass flow rate and density of the fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Omega Engineering|url=http://www.omega.com/literature/transactions/volume4/t9904-10-mass.html|title=Mass Flowmeters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molecular physics===
In polyatomic molecules, the molecule motion can be described by a rigid body rotation and internal vibration of atoms about their equilibrium position. As a result of the vibrations of the atoms, the atoms are in motion relative to the rotating coordinate system of the molecule. Coriolis effects are therefore present, and make the atoms move in a direction perpendicular to the original oscillations. This leads to a mixing in molecular spectra between the rotational and vibrational [[energy level|levels]], from which Coriolis coupling constants can be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=califano |first1=S |title=Vibrational states |year=1976|publisher=Wiley |isbn=0471129968|pages=226–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gyroscopic precession===

When an external torque is applied to a spinning gyroscope along an axis that is at right angles to the spin axis, the rim velocity that is associated with the spin becomes radially directed in relation to the external torque axis. This causes a Coriolis force to act on the rim in such a way as to tilt the gyroscope at right angles to the direction that the external torque would have tilted it. This tendency has the effect of keeping spinning bodies stably aligned in space.

=== Insect flight ===
Flies ([[Diptera]]) and some moths ([[Lepidoptera]]) exploit the Coriolis effect in flight with specialized appendages and organs that relay information about the [[angular velocity]] of their bodies.

Coriolis forces resulting from linear motion of these appendages are detected within the rotating frame of reference of the insects' bodies. In the case of flies, their specialized appendages are dumbbell shaped organs located just behind their wings called "[[halteres]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fraenkel|first1=G.|last2=Pringle|first2=W.S.|title=Halteres of Flies as Gyroscopic Organs of Equilibrium|journal=Nature|date=21 May 1938|issue=3577|pages=919–920|doi=10.1038/141919a0|volume=141|bibcode = 1938Natur.141..919F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fly's halteres oscillate in a plane at the same beat frequency as the main wings so that any body rotation results in lateral deviation of the halteres from their plane of motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dickinson|first1=M.|title=Haltere-mediated equilibrium reflexes of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster|journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.|year=1999|issue=1385|pages=903–916|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1692594/pdf/10382224.pdf|pmc=1692594|pmid=10382224|doi=10.1098/rstb.1999.0442|volume=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In moths, their antennae are known to be responsible for the ''sensing'' of Coriolis forces in the similar manner as with the halteres in flies.&lt;ref name="Sane S., Dieudonné, A., Willis, M., Daniel, T.date = February 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Antennal mechanosensors mediate flight control in moths|last = Sane S., Dieudonné, A., Willis, M., Daniel, T.|date = February 2007|journal = Science|doi = 10.1126/science.1133598|volume=315|issue = 5813|pages=863–866|bibcode = 2007Sci...315..863S|pmid=17290001|url=http://www.hep.princeton.edu/%7Emcdonald/examples/mechanics/sane_science_315_863_07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both flies and moths, a collection of mechanosensors at the base of the appendage are sensitive to deviations at the beat frequency, correlating to rotation in the [[Aircraft principal axes#Principal axes|pitch and roll]] planes, and at twice the beat frequency, correlating to rotation in the [[yaw (rotation)|yaw]] plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=J|last2=Daniel|first2=T|title=A neural basis for gyroscopic force measurement in the halteres of Holorusia|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology|year=2008|volume=194|issue=10|pages=887–897|doi=10.1007/s00359-008-0361-z|pmid=18751714}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sane S., Dieudonné, A., Willis, M., Daniel, T.date = February 2007" /&gt;

===Lagrangian point stability===
In astronomy, [[Lagrangian point]]s are five positions in the orbital plane of two large orbiting bodies where a small object affected only by gravity can maintain a stable position relative to the two large bodies. The first three Lagrangian points (L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) lie along the line connecting the two large bodies, while the last two points (L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and L&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) each form an equilateral triangle with the two large bodies. The L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and L&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; points, although they correspond to maxima of the [[effective potential]] in the coordinate frame that rotates with the two large bodies, are stable due to the Coriolis effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spohn |first1=Tilman |last2=Breuer |first2=Doris |last3=Johnson |first3=Torrence |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0bEMAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1| title=Encyclopedia of the Solar System |year=2014|publisher=Elsevier |isbn=0124160344|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stability can result in orbits around just L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or L&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, known as [[tadpole orbit]]s, where [[trojan (astronomy)|trojans]] can be found. It can also result in orbits that encircle L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and L&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, known as [[horseshoe orbit]]s.

'''Dismal Swamp State Park''' is a [[List of North Carolina state parks|North Carolina state park]] in [[Camden County, North Carolina|Camden County]], [[North Carolina]] in the United States.  The park was created as a [[List of North Carolina state parks#State Natural Areas|state natural area]] in 1974 with the help of [[The Nature Conservancy]], and on July 28, 2007 the [[General Assembly of North Carolina|NC General Assembly]] re-designated it as a state park.&lt;ref name=ReDesignation/&gt;  It opened to the public in 2008.&lt;ref name=Dedication/&gt; This marked the first time that public access to [[Great Dismal Swamp]] was made possible in North Carolina.&lt;ref name="comeplay"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.albemarle-nc.com/camden/attractions/DismalSwampStatePark/ | title = Dismal Swamp State Park | accessdate = 2008-09-23 | publisher = ICW NET, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park covers {{convert|14432|acre|km2}} of protected land on the North Carolina/[[Virginia]] border. Park offices are three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) south of the border on [[U.S. Route 17]] near South Mills. Features of the park include the canal which is used regularly by boaters using the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] and several miles of hiking and biking trails.&lt;ref name="dssp"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ncparks.gov/Visit/parks/disw/main.php

==History==
By 1650, few [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] remained in the [[Great Dismal Swamp]] area, and European settlers showed little interest in the swamp. In 1665, [[William Drummond (colonial governor)|William Drummond]], future governor of North Carolina, was the first European to explore the lake which now bears his name. [[William Byrd II]] led a [[surveying]] party into the swamp to draw a dividing line between Virginia and North Carolina in 1728. [[George Washington]] visited the swamp and called it a "glorious paradise".&lt;ref name="dssp"/&gt; He then formed the Dismal Swamp Land Company in 1763, which proceeded to drain and harvest [[lumber|timber]] from part of the area. A five-mile (8&amp;nbsp;km) [[ditch]] on the west side of the current refuge still bears his name. In 1805, the [[Dismal Swamp Canal]] began serving as a commercial highway for timber coming out of the swamp.&lt;ref name="gds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/northeast/greatdismalswamp/History.htm |title=Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge |accessdate=2008-09-23 |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505093556/http://www.fws.gov/northeast/greatdismalswamp/History.htm |archivedate=2008-05-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before and during the [[US Civil War|American Civil War]], the Great Dismal Swamp was a hideout for runaway [[slavery|slaves]] from the surrounding area. Recent research showed that thousands of [[Great Dismal Swamp maroons]] lived in the swamp between the 1600s and 1865. [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Dred: A Tale of the Great Dismal Swamp]]'' is based on them.

While all efforts to drain the swamp failed, [[logging]] of the swamp proved to be a successful commercial activity. Logging operations continued as late as 1976. The entire swamp has been logged at least once, and many areas have been burned by periodic [[wildfire]]s. Agricultural, commercial, and residential development destroyed much of the swamp, so that the remaining portion within and around the refuge represents less than half of the original size of the swamp.

Before the refuge was established, over {{convert|140|mi|km}} of [[road]]s were constructed to provide access to the [[timber]]. These roads disrupted the swamp's natural [[hydrology]], as the ditches which were dug to provide soil for the road beds drained water from the swamp. The roads also blocked the flow of water across the swamp's surface, flooding some areas of the swamp with [[stagnant water]]. The logging operations removed natural stands of [[Taxodium distichum|bald cypress]] and [[Chamaecyparis thyoides|Atlantic white cypress]] that were replaced by other forest types, particularly [[red maple]]. A drier swamp and the suppression of wildfires, which once cleared the land for seed [[germination]], created ecological conditions that were less favorable to the survival of cypress stands. As a result, plant and animal variety decreased.

Dismal Swamp State Park opened in 2008.&lt;ref name=Dedication/&gt; It is accessed via a floating bridge over the [[Dismal Swamp Canal]].&lt;ref name="comeplay"/&gt; This is the only public access to the park's visitor's center, other than boat launches along the canal.&lt;ref name="comeplay"/&gt; Hiking and biking trails have opened and additional trails are under construction.

==Ecology==
[[Image:Chamaecyparis thyoides detail.jpg|thumb|150px|The Atlantic white cedar is an evergreen found at Dismal Swamp State Park]]
Dismal Swamp State Park is much drier than it was in the past. The efforts of man in the last 200 years to drain the swamp have left it drastically altered. Ditches and logging trails have cut off the normal flow of the swamp and created a series of stagnant pools and patches of dry land where continuously water covered swamps once stood. The trees of the area have changed from various types of cypress and other water loving plants to [[Acer rubrum|red maple]] and [[Chamaecyparis thyoides|white cedar]].&lt;ref name="ecology"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ncparks.gov/Visit/parks/disw/ecology.php | title = Dismal Swamp State Park: Ecology | accessdate = 2008-09-24 | publisher = North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The white cedar thrives in the [[peat]] that is common in the area. These trees provide a habitat for several rare species. [[Callophrys hesseli|Hessel's hairstreak]] a species of [[butterfly]] that is dependent on the white cedar has been spotted at the park. [[Black-throated green warbler]]s make their nests in the white cedars.&lt;ref name="ecology"/&gt;

The drained swamp lands have converted to hardwood forests of red maple, [[black walnut]], [[Asimina triloba|pawpaw]] and several species of oak. [[White-tailed deer]], [[wild turkey]], [[bobwhite]] and marsh rabbits live in the areas along the trails. [[Blackberry]] and [[blueberry]] patches line the trails. These berries attract a large number of [[American black bear]]s to the area. Other common animals include the [[raccoon]], [[opossum]] and [[gray fox]] as well as the occasional [[bobcat]].&lt;ref name="ecology"/&gt;

Butterflies are plentiful at Dismal Swamp State Park. Forty-three species have been found in the park, including large numbers of [[Papilio palamedes|palamedes]], [[zebra swallowtail]]s, [[Papilio appalachiensis|tiger swallowtails]] and [[Celastrina idella|Atlantic holly azures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ncparks.gov/Visit/parks/disw/ecology.php|title= Dismal Swamp State Park|publisher=N.C. Division of Parks &amp; Recreation |accessdate=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several varieties of warbler and vireo are common. Woodpeckers and hawks nest here as do [[barred owl]]s.&lt;ref name="ecology"/&gt;

==Recreation==
Dismal Swamp State Park is open for year-round recreation. [[Dismal Swamp Canal]] is open to [[canoe]]s and [[kayak]]s. A boat ramp at the park provides access to the canal. There are {{convert|16.7|mi|km}} of logging trails open to [[hiking]] and mountain biking through swamp forests. Park rangers host environmental education and interpretive events. The visitor center is accessed from a floating bridge across the canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncparks.gov/Visit/parks/disw/activities.pho |title=Dismal Swamp State Park: Activities |accessdate=2008-09-24 |publisher=North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Einasleigh Upland Savanna.jpg|thumb|The Einasleigh Upland Savanna bioregion, as shown by the [[World Wildlife Fund|WWF]].]]
The '''Einasleigh Uplands''' is an [[Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia|interim Australian]] [[bioregion]], &lt;ref name=subregions/&gt; with vegetation consisting of [[savanna]] and woodland located on a large plateau in inland [[Queensland]], [[Australia]].

==Location and description==
The uplands are an area of eroded volcanic rock on and to the west of the [[Atherton Tableland]] in the northern section of Australia's [[Great Dividing Range]] running inland as far as the town of [[Croydon, Queensland|Croydon]] in the southwest. The plateau is covered in grassland dotted with [[eucalyptus]] trees and cut through with ridges, gorges and lava tubes. The area has rich fertile soil. Natural features include the [[Great Basalt Wall National Park|Great Basalt Wall]] of dried volcanic lava and the lava tubes of [[Undara Volcanic National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=aa0705|name=Einasleigh upland savanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate is cooler than the coast with summer nights being as cool as 9&amp;nbsp;°C compared with 20&amp;nbsp;°C on the coast. The summer high temperatures are around 35&amp;nbsp;°C. There is a wet season between December and March.

Rivers that have their source in the uplands include the [[Flinders River]] which runs northwest to the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] along with the [[Palmer River (Queensland)|Palmer]], [[Mitchell River (Queensland)|Mitchell]] and [[Gilbert-Einasleigh River|Gilbert-Einasleigh]] while the [[Burdekin River|Burdekin]] and [[Herbert River]]s run south-east from the tablelands to the [[Coral Sea]] coast. 

Urban areas include [[Herberton, Queensland|Herberton]] and Croydon.

==Ecology==
Einasleigh Uplands is the name given to this area in the [[Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia]] survey of different ecosystems in the country, while in the [[World Wildlife Fund]]'s bioregion mapping they are described as Einasleigh Upland Savanna. These descriptions are based on study of the climate, plant life and terrain compared with neighbouring areas. This area is inland from the moist Queensland coast but is not as dry as the [[Brigalow Belt]] and the [[Mitchell Grass]] savannas south, while the [[Cape York Peninsula]] to the north is lower-lying and wetter. The region contains a number of specialised habitats that add to the variety of wildlife found here. These include lava flows and caves such as those of [[Chillagoe]].

===Flora===
This stony upland habitat is dominated by [[ironbark]] eucalyptus woodland but there are wetlands and patches of rainforest too. Lava flows are home to stands of thicker forest.

===Fauna===
These woodlands are home to many animals including a number of [[marsupial]]s such as the [[antilopine kangaroo]], the large [[eastern grey kangaroo]] and the near-endemic [[Godman's rock-wallaby]] and [[Mareeba rock-wallaby]]. There are a number of [[Endemism|endemic]] mammals, reptiles and insects in the region especially in the more thickly forested areas where a large number of endemic reptiles occur. The caves and lava flows harbour specific wildlife of their own as do the wetter east-facing slopes of the uplands. Rivers such as the Burdekin have important populations of waterbirds as do the unique (to Australia) wetlands of [[Innot Hot springs]].

==Threats and preservation==
The area has long been used for cattle ranching but apart from the heavily farmed Atherton Tableland is thinly populated so the landscape is well preserved although it has been changed by overgrazing, clearance for agriculture and the introduction of weeds. Some areas of the [[acacia]] gidgee ''([[Acacia cambagei]])'' in the southeast of the uplands have suffered in particular. There are a number of protected areas containing a good variety of the different types of habitat found in the region, including Undara and the Great Basalt Wall as well as part of [[Bulleringa National Park]] and the [[Chillagoe-Mungana Caves National Park|caves of Chillagoe]].

The '''FIBA World Rankings''' or '''NIKE-FIBA World Rankings''' are [[FIBA]]'s rankings of national [[basketball]] teams. FIBA ranks men's and women's national teams in both senior and junior competitions. It also publishes combined rankings for all competitions involving both sexes.

Not included are rankings for 3x3, which are tabulated for individual players.

==Calculation==
Only FIBA tournaments for full five-a-side teams are used in calculations for the tournaments. Other tournaments, such as regional championships, invitationals, and friendlies are not included. Also not counted are tournaments in FIBA's official competition for three-on-three halfcourt basketball, [[3x3 (basketball)|3x3]].&lt;ref name="how"&gt;[http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/even/rank/p/openNodeIDs/998/selNodeID/998/howItWork.html FIBA.com: How it works]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, FIBA radically changed its ranking system for men's national teams, switching from the previous competition-based system to a game-based system. Every game played by a national team within the prior 8 years in the World Cup, Olympics, continental championships, and qualifiers for these events figures into the calculations.&lt;ref name="How men"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/documents/rankingmen/howitworks |title=FIBA World Ranking Men, presented by Nike — How it works |publisher=FIBA |accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the Olympic Games 2016 the Olympic game and the men's world championship, gave identical score for being a world champion and Olympic, but since the new FIBA score emerged in 2017 these two tournaments devalued the score, passing from 5 points play an Olympic and world championship as it was until 2016, to award 2.5 points for playing a world championship, and 2 points for playing an Olympic game of basketball since 2017. Therefore, both tournaments will not grant a differential score with respect to others tournaments of National Teams, as they did in the past where there was no difference in points in the ranking for being world champion or Olympic, but if there was much difference until 2016 in fiba ranking points between these two tournaments and the rest of the competitions fiba as the continental tournaments. In the women will continue maintaining the score of 5 points for playing an Olympic or world game. But since 2017 will no longer keep the same score men.

===Rating points per game===
Each game in a ranking tournament is initially valued at 1,000 '''basis points''', divided between the two teams as follows:&lt;ref name="How men"/&gt;

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Victory margin !! Points to winner !! Points to loser
|-
| Less than 10 points || 600 || 400
|-
| 10–19 points || 700 || 300
|-
| 20 or more points || 800 || 200
|-
| Forfeit || 1000 || 0
|}

The basis points are adjusted based on the site of the game, with FIBA calling this adjustment '''home/away points'''. During the finals of ranking tournaments, only games played by a host team in its own country count as "home" games; all others are treated as neutral-site games. Adjustments are:&lt;ref name="How men"/&gt;

* Home game: −70 points
* Neutral site: No adjustment
* Away game: +70 points

The basis points are also adjusted to reflect the strength of the opponent. FIBA determines what it calls '''opposition ranking points''' by the following formula:&lt;ref name="How men"/&gt;

* Opposition ranking points = 1.5 × (average pregame ranking for all national teams − opponent's pregame ranking)

A team's final rating points for a particular game is the '''sum''' of basis, home/away, and opposition ranking points.&lt;ref name="How men"/&gt;

===Weighting===
The new calculations still account for the specific tournament and region, as in the former procedure, but no longer explicitly consider a team's final tournament placement.

In a new feature, a '''time decay''' factor has been introduced into the calculations. More recent games carry the greatest weight, steadily declining until falling out of the calculations after 8 years:&lt;ref name="How men"/&gt;

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Time of game !! Weighting 
|-
| Current year (Y) and immediately previous year (Y−1) || 1.0
|-
| Y−2 and Y−3 || 0.75
|-
| Y−4 and Y−5 || 0.5
|-
| Y−6 and Y−7 || 0.25
|}

'''Regional''' weighting remains in the system, though the specific factors vary from those used in the past men's rankings: Until the men Olympic Games 2016, the Olympic games and the men's world championship gave identical score for being a world champion and Olympic, but since the new FIBA rakning fiba emerged in 2017 these two tournaments devalued the score, passing from 5 points play an Olympic and world championship as it was until 2016, to award 2.5 points for playing a world championship, and 2 points for playing an Olympic game of basketball since 2017. Therefore, both tournaments will not grant a differential score with respect to others tournaments of national teams, as they did in the past where there was no difference in points in the ranking for being world champion or Olympic, but if there was much difference until 2016 in fiba ranking points between these two tournaments,  and the rest of the competitions fiba as the continental tournaments. In the women will continue maintaining the score of 5 points for playing an Olympic or world championship. but since 2017 will no longer keep the same ranking men.

FIBA uses a [[weighted arithmetic mean]] to determine the statistical weight of each of the tournaments. Each event is assigned point weight that is based partly on how competitive the tournament is and partly on which national teams are participating:.&lt;ref name="how"/&gt; There were constant changes in the system of the FIBA ranking, but it can be seen that until 2016 the FIBA world championship and the games awarded the same points in the FIBA ranking, therefore the FIBA world championship and the Olympic basketball games had the same value. Therefore, for those years the World Cup and the Olympic tournament had the same prestige according to the ranking of those years. In the year 2017, according to the ranking system in the FIBA ranking, published on October 11, 2017 for the first time in history, the FIBA world championship awards more points than the Olympic tournament: 2.5 points the world championship, against 2 points the olympics games. For all this the FIBA 2019 world championship will be the first more prestigious championship than an Olympic basketball, given that it will be worth 2.5 points and the Olympic 2020, 2 points.

The 2017 FIBA ranking started on October 11, 2017. Since that date, the FIBA World Cup is worth 2.5 and the Olympic Games 2 points, although the new ranking  published on October 11, 2017 is not applicable to the tournaments played until 2016, given that both tournaments they maintain the same score (5 each one).

In the future, the World Cup will be worth 2.5 points and the Olympic basketball tournament 2 points, therefore in 2019 for the first time in history the FIBA World Cup will give more points than an Olympic basketball game.

In addition to the qualifying rounds, in Europe are also included the results of the [[FIBA European Championship for Small Countries]].

====FIBA world ranking for men. Events weight since 2017====

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! width=550px | Event !! Weight
|-
| [[FIBA Basketball World Cup]] || 2.5
|-
| [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic basketball tournament]] || 2.0
|-

|-
| [[FIBA Asia Cup]] || 0.4
|-
| [[EuroBasket]] || 1.0
|-
| [[FIBA Oceania Championship]] || 0.7
|}

From 2017 forward, FIBA Asia and FIBA Oceania members compete for a single regional championship under the FIBA Asia banner. Results from the 2010–2016 period, during which FIBA Asia and FIBA Oceania held separate championships, will continue to figure into the rankings until results from 2016, the final year of separate championships in the two regions, drop from the calculations in 2025.&lt;ref name="How men"/&gt;

In a new feature, FIBA also weights game results by the '''competition stage'''.&lt;ref name="How men"/&gt;

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Stage !! Weight
|-
| Pre-qualifier || 0.25
|-
| Qualifier || 0.5
|-
| Final tournament || 1.0
|}

Additionally, FIBA has added a '''round weighting''' to the system, giving each game in a final tournament (World Cup, Olympics, or continental championship) a weighting based on the round in which it takes place. Qualifying matches for these tournaments implicitly carry a round weighting of 1.0.&lt;ref name="How men"/&gt;

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Round !! Weight
|-
| Group stage || 1.0
|-
| Round of 16 || 1.25
|-
| Quarterfinals || 1.5
|-
| Semifinals || 1.75
|-
| Final || 2.0
|}

If a competition does not have a round of 16 and/or a quarterfinal round, the results from the rounds that are held are scaled according to the number of rounds, with the group stage remaining at a 1.0 weighting and the competition final remaining at 2.0.&lt;ref name="How men"/&gt;

The final weighting is the '''product''' of the time decay, regional, competition stage, and round weights.&lt;ref name="How men"/&gt;

===Cycle and updates===
Rankings are now updated after every individual game in a ranking tournament (including qualifiers for such tournaments).

===Examples===
For examples of the new ranking calculations, see [http://www.fiba.basketball/documents/rankingmen/examples this page] on FIBA's official site.

==Women's rankings==
{{Main|FIBA Women's World Ranking}}
FIBA still uses the competition-based system to determine its women's rankings. As noted above, this system was also used to determine men's rankings prior to 2017. FIBA has announced that it will introduce a game-based ranking procedure similar to that currently used for men's rankings in the indeterminate future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/documents/rankingmen/faq |title=FIBA World Ranking Men, presented by Nike – Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) |publisher=FIBA |accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eurelectric Award 2013 ===
Paul Bulteel, [[Eurelectric]] Electricity Ambassador announced at the Eurelectric Annual Convention in Bologna on 4 June 2013, that the Eurelectric Award went to Birol for "his outstanding contribution to improving understanding of the opportunities and challenges facing the power sector." Buleel added that Birol in his 'unique position" raised awareness of power sector among policymakers, the financial community and other stakeholders. "Under Dr Fatih Birol's direction, the IEA's World Energy Outlook has become the most authoritative source of forward-looking energy market analysis. It has drawn attention to the huge challenges that will need to be overcome to maintain electricity supply in the decades ahead. Its finding that 2.6 trillion USD needs to be invested in the EU's power sector through to 2035 has become an iconic figure for the industry. Fatih Birol has made a unique contribution to raising awareness among policymakers, the financial community and other stakeholders of the issues the power sector has to deal with".&lt;ref name=EURELECTRICAward2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurelectric.org/news/2013/eurelectric-award-2013-honours-iea-chief-economist,-dr-fatih-birol/|title=EURELECTRIC Award 2013 honours IEA Chief Economist, Dr Fatih Birol|date=4 June 2013|publisher=EURELECTRIC Electricity for Europe|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Forbes'' magazine ===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9169">A '''fuel cell bus''' is a [[bus]] that uses a [[hydrogen]] [[fuel cell]] as its power source for [[Electric motor|electrically driven]] wheels, sometimes augmented in a hybrid fashion with batteries or a [[supercapacitor]].

Several companies are conducting hydrogen fuel cell research and practical fuel cell bus trials.  These include:
*[[Daimler AG]], with thirty-six experimental units powered by [[Ballard Power Systems]] fuel cells completing a successful three-year trial, in eleven cities, in January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Fuel Cell Bus Project Extended by One Year |work= |publisher=DaimlerChrysler |date= |url=http://www.daimlerchrysler.com/dccom/0-5-7153-1-596003-1-0-0-0-0-0-8-7145-0-0-0-0-0-0-1.html |accessdate=31 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929083839/http://www.daimlerchrysler.com/dccom/0-5-7153-1-596003-1-0-0-0-0-0-8-7145-0-0-0-0-0-0-1.html |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fuel cell buses |work= |publisher=[[Transport for London]] |date= |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/environment/2017.aspx |accessdate=1 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513071814/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/environment/2017.aspx |archivedate=13 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Iveco Bus|Irisbus]], based on [[United Technologies Corporation|UTC Power]] fuel cell technology
* [[TATA Motors]] and [[Indian Oil Corporation]] (Starbus -Fuel Cell) have built prototypes and are undergoing road trials

There are also fuel cell powered buses currently active or in production, such as a fleet of Thor buses with [[United Technologies Corporation|UTC Power]] fuel cells in California, operated by SunLine Transit Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UTC Power - Fuel Cell Fleet Vehicles |url=http://www.utcpower.com/fs/com/bin/fs_com_Page/0,5433,03552,00.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316222522/http://www.utcpower.com/fs/com/bin/fs_com_Page/0,5433,03552,00.html |archivedate=2006-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hydrogen fuel|Hydrogen-powered]] fuel-cell buses began operating in [[Beijing Bus|Beijing]] on an experimental basis in 2006.&lt;ref name="Fuelcellbus"&gt;[http://www.gov.cn/english/2006-06/21/content_316521.htm  "First clean fuel buses running on Beijing roads" Gov.cn] 2006-06-21&lt;/ref&gt; Three fuel cell buses, made by [[Daimler AG|Daimler]] in [[Germany]] and purchased with a grant from the [[United Nations Development Programme|U.N. Development Programme]], were the first fuel cell buses to enter operation in China.&lt;ref name="Fuelcellbus"/&gt;  The technology has not gained broader use in the city because air pollution reduced the efficiency and operating life of fuel cells.&lt;ref&gt;(Chinese) [http://news.sciencenet.cn/htmlnews/2013/3/275834.shtm 姜天海, "杨裕生院士：氢燃料电池拯救不了蓝天" 中国科学报] 2013-03-20&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Brazil]]ian [[hydrogen vehicle|hydrogen]] [[fuel cell]] bus prototype began operation in [[São Paulo]] during the first semester of 2009.  The hydrogen bus was manufactured in [[Caxias do Sul]], and the hydrogen fuel will be produced in [[São Bernardo do Campo]] from water through [[electrolysis]].  The programme, called "''Ônibus Brasileiro a Hidrogênio''" (Brazilian Hydrogen Autobus), includes three additional buses.&lt;ref name="HidroBR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inovacaotecnologica.com.br/noticias/noticia.php?artigo=onibus-brasileiro-movido-a-hidrogenio-comeca-a-rodar-em-sao-paulo|title=Ônibus brasileiro movido a hidrogênio começa a rodar em São Paulo|publisher=Inovação Tecnológica|date=2009-04-08|accessdate=2009-05-03|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EMTU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emtu.sp.gov.br/h2/noticia/release1.htm|title=Ônibus a Hidrogênio vira realidade no Brasil|publisher=Inovação Tecnológica|date=April 2009|accessdate=2009-05-03|language=Portuguese}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]] in [[British Columbia]], Canada owned and operated the largest fuel-cell bus fleet in the world, having been put in operation for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]]. However, the costs were too high and the program halted in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://gas2.org/2015/03/10/vancouver-ends-hydrogen-bus-program-amid-high-costs/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]], the Aberdeen Hydrogen Bus Project currently has 10 hydrogen fuel cell buses operating, the largest fleet in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aberdeeninvestlivevisit.co.uk/Invest/Aberdeens-Economy/City-Projects/H2-Aberdeen/Hydrogen-Bus/Hydrogen-Bus-Project.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fuel Cell Bus Club]] is a global cooperative effort in trial fuel cell buses. Ford began leasing E-350 shuttle buses in late 2006. It conducted some trials:
* 1998 - [[Chicago]] and [[Vancouver]], there were two-year three-bus demonstration projects. The six buses in those trials, which used an earlier version of Ballard fuel cell than the Fuel Cell Bus Club's trial and [[New Flyer Industries]] 40 foot low floor F40LF bodies, carried more than 200,000 passengers and traveled over {{convert|118,000|km|mi|sp=us}}. The 3 Vancouver units were deactivated,some were sold back to Ballard, who made the fuel cells and the others were converted to diesel- electric hybrids and eventually scrapped.
* 2004–present [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[California]] a two-year three-bus trial. During this period, [[AC Transit]] and [[Sunline Transit]] ([[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], California) have been operating three buses and one bus respectively. This trial has shown promising results and has been extended until new buses listed below are delivered.
* 2004–2006 [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority]] ([[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]], California) operated 3 buses Manufactured by Gilig Corp of Hayward California which were equipped with Ballard fuel cells. VTA reported in the press that these buses were too expensive to operate and that they would not continue with their trial.
* Japan, operating FCHV-BUS (Fuel Cell Hybrid Vehicle) manufactured by [[Hino Motors]] and [[Toyota Motors]] under [[Japan hydrogen fuel cell project]].
** 2003–2004 – [[Tokyo]], one year and four months one-bus demonstration operated by [[Toei Bus]].
** 2005 – [[Expo 2005]] [[Aichi]], six-month eight-fleet trial as inter-site shuttle. During Expo, 8 FCHV-BUSes carried one million visitors and traveled about 130,000 kilometers.
** 2006-[[Tokoname, Aichi]], ex-Expo 2005 fleets are leasing 1 to Chita Noriai as route bus in [[Chūbu Centrair International Airport]] island, and two to Chubu Sky Support as [[Ramp Bus|ramp bus]] in Centrair.
* 2009 – [[Oakland, California]]. A 12-bus trial program in this city in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] is underway at [[AC Transit]] which features buses specially designed by [[Van Hool]] of [[Belgium]]. These buses use near ambient pressure, PEM fuel cells manufactured by the [[Hartford, Connecticut]]-based [[United Technologies Corporation]] (UTC). AC Transit is joined by operating partners [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority]] (VTA) of [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]], [[SamTrans]] of [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]], [[Golden Gate Transit]] of [[Marin County, California|Marin]] and [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma]] counties, and [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]] (SF Muni) in the [[San Francisco|City and County of San Francisco]] which will operate the buses occasionally. UTC is also purchasing four additional buses for use in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] under AC Transit's contract with Van Hool. Deliveries are scheduled to begin in the third quarter of 2009 and be completed in 2010.{{update after|2010|12|31}}

'''''Galápagos''''' is the eleventh [[novel]] written by [[United States|American]] author [[Kurt Vonnegut]]. The novel questions the merit of the human brain from an evolutionary perspective. The title is both a reference to the islands on which part of the story plays out, and a tribute to [[Charles Darwin]] on whose theory Vonnegut relies to reach his own conclusions. It was first published in 1985 by [[Random House|Delacorte Press]].

==Plot summary==
''Galápagos'' is the story of a small band of mismatched humans who are shipwrecked on the fictional island of Santa Rosalia in the [[Galápagos Islands]] after a global financial crisis cripples the world's economy. Shortly thereafter, a disease renders all humans on Earth infertile, with the exception of the people on Santa Rosalia, making them the last specimens of humankind. Over the next million years, their descendants, the only fertile humans left on the planet, eventually [[evolution|evolve]] into a [[fur]]ry [[species]] resembling [[Pinniped|sea lions]]: though possibly still able to walk upright (it is not explicitly mentioned, but it is stated that they occasionally catch land animals), they have a [[snout]] with teeth [[adapted]] for catching fish, a streamlined skull and flipper-like hands with [[Vestigiality|rudimentary]] fingers (described as "[[:wiktionary:nubbin|nubbin]]s").

The story's narrator is a [[spirit]] who has been watching over humans for the last million years. This particular ghost is the immortal spirit of Leon Trotsky Trout, son of Vonnegut's recurring character [[Kilgore Trout]]. Leon is a [[Vietnam veteran|Vietnam War veteran]] who is affected by the massacres in Vietnam. He goes [[AWOL]] and settles in [[Sweden]], where he works as a shipbuilder and dies during the construction of the ship, the ''Bahía de Darwin''. This ship is used for the "Nature Cruise of the Century". Planned as a celebrity [[Cruise ship|cruise]], it was in limbo due to the economic downturn, and due to a chain of unconnected events the ship ended up allowing humans to reach and survive in the Galápagos.

Kilgore Trout —deceased— makes four appearances in the novel, urging his son to enter the "blue tunnel" that leads to the afterlife. When Leon refuses for the fourth time, Kilgore pledges that he, and the blue tunnel, will not return for one million years, which leaves Leon to observe the slow process of evolution that transforms the humans into aquatic mammals. The process begins when a Japanese woman on the island, the granddaughter of a [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]] survivor, gives birth to a fur-covered daughter.

Trout maintains that all the sorrows of humankind were caused by "the only true villain in my story: the oversized [[human brain]]". [[Natural selection]] eliminates this problem, since the humans best fitted to Santa Rosalia were those who could swim best, which required a [[wikt:streamline|streamlined]] head, which in turn required a smaller brain.

== Main characters ==
* '''Leon Trout''', dead narrator and son of Kilgore Trout
* '''Hernando Cruz''', first mate of the Bahía de Darwin
* '''Mary Hepburn''', an American widow who teaches at [[Ilium (Kurt Vonnegut)|Ilium]] High School
* '''Roy Hepburn''', Mary's husband who died in 1985 from a brain tumor
* '''Akiko Hiroguchi''', the daughter of Hisako that will be born with fur covering her entire body
* '''Hisako Hiroguchi''', a teacher of [[ikebana]] and Zenji's pregnant wife
* '''Zenji Hiroguchi''', a Japanese computer genius who invented the voice translator Gokubi and its successor Mandarax
* '''Bobby King''', publicity man and organizer of the "Nature Cruise of the Century"
* '''Andrew MacIntosh''', an American financier and adventurer of great inherited wealth
* '''Selena MacIntosh''', Andrew's blind daughter, eighteen years old
* '''Jesús Ortiz''', a talented Inca waiter who looks up to wealthy and powerful people
* '''Adolf von Kleist''', captain of Bahía de Darwin who doesn't really know how to steer the ship
* '''Siegfried von Kleist''', brother of Adolf and carrier of [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's chorea]] who temporarily takes care of the reception at hotel El Dorado
* '''James Wait''', a 35-year-old American swindler
* '''Pvt. Geraldo Delgado''', an Ecuadorian soldier

== Literary techniques ==

=== Form ===
The main storyline is told chronologically, but the author frequently mentions the outcome of future events (referring to 1986 as being one million years in the past). The most obvious example of this is the inclusion of an asterisk in front of a character's name if he or she will die before sunset.

=== Quotations ===
The novel contains a large number of quotations from other authors. They are related to the story itself and are functionally inserted through Mandarax, a fictional voice translator that is also able to provide quotations from literature and history. The following authors are quoted (in order of their appearance in the book): [[Anne Frank]], [[Alfred Tennyson]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[John Masefield]], [[William Cullen Bryant]], [[Ambrose Bierce]], [[Lord Byron]], Noble Claggett, [[John Greenleaf Whittier]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[John Heywood]], [[Cesare Bonesana Beccaria]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[John the Evangelist|Saint John]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Isaac Watts]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Plato]], [[Robert Browning]], [[Jean de La Fontaine]], [[François Rabelais]], [[Patrick R. Chalmers]], [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Joseph Conrad]], [[George William Curtis]], [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[A. E. Housman]], [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Charles E. Carryl]], [[Samuel Johnson]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[Edward Lear]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Sophocles]], [[Robert Frost]], and [[Charles Darwin]].

== Adaptations ==
In 2009, [[Audible.com]] produced an audio version of ''Galápagos'', narrated by [[Jonathan Davis (audiobook narrator)|Jonathan Davis]], as part of its ''Modern Vanguard'' line of audiobooks.

In 2014, artists Tucker Marder and [[Christian Scheider]] adapted "Galápagos" into a live theatrical performance at the new [[Parrish Art Museum]] in Watermill, N.Y. Endorsed by the [[Kurt Vonnegut]] Estate, the multi-media production featured 26 performers including Bob Balaban; live orchestral underscoring composed and conducted by Forrest Gray featuring Max Feldschuh on vibraphone and Ken Sacks on mbira; animal costumes by Isla Hansen; a three-story scenic design by Shelby Jackson; experimental video projections by James Bayard; and choreography by Matt Davies.

[[File:Lazarus Thick Shell Gasholder.jpg|thumb|right|30,000m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [[blast furnace]] gas holder at Rautaruukki Steel in [[Finland]]]]
A '''gas holder''', or '''gasometer''', is a large container in which [[natural gas]] or [[town gas]] is [[natural gas storage|stored]] near [[atmospheric pressure]] at [[room temperature|ambient temperatures]]. The volume of the container follows the quantity of stored gas, with pressure coming from the weight of a movable cap. Typical volumes for large gas holders are about {{Convert|50000|m3|ft3}}, with {{Convert|60|m|ft}} diameter structures. 

Gas holders now tend to be used for balancing purposes, to ensure gas pipes can be operated within a safe range of pressures, rather than for actually storing gas for later use.

== Etymology ==
[[Antoine Lavoisier]] devised the [[pneumatic chemistry#Gasometer|gazomètre]] to assist his work in [[pneumatic chemistry]] .{{sfn|Thomas|2014|loc=slides 5-7}} These enabled him to weigh the gas in a [[pneumatic trough]] with the precision he required. He published his ''Traité Élémentaire de Chimie'' in 1789.

[[James Watt Junior]] had collaborated with [[Thomas Beddoes]] in constructing the [[pneumatic medicine|pneumatic apparatus]], a short lived piece of medical equipment that incorporated a gazomètre. He  then adapted the gazomètre for coal gas storage.{{sfn|Thomas|2014|loc=slide 10}} The anglicisation ''gasometer'' was adopted by [[William Murdoch]], the inventor of [[gas lighting]], in 1782, as the name for his gas holders. {{sfn|Thomas|2014|loc=slide 8}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141029614007238|title=The refurbishment of gasometers as a relevant witness of industrial archaeology|author1=Luigi Fiorinoa |author2=Raffaele Landolfob |author3=Federico Massimo Mazzolani |journal=Engineering Structures|year=2014|doi=10.1016/j.engstruct.2014.11.035|volume=84|pages=252–265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the objections of Murdoch's associates that his so-called "gasometer" was not a [[Measuring instrument|meter]] but a container, the name was retained and came into general use. The term "gasometer" is discouraged for use in technical circles, where the term "gas holder" is preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Ed|last1=Ram|title=Will the UK's gas holders be missed?  BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30405066|accessdate=24 May 2016|work=Magazine|publisher=BBC News|date=9 February 2015|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Ordnance Survey have marked gas holders on their large-scale maps- calling them gasometers. This became used to label gas works, where there usually are several gas holders.

The spelling "gas holder" is used by the BBC, though the variant "gasholder" is commonly used by other publishers.
The meter used to measure the flow of gas through a particular pipe is a [[gas meter]].

== History ==
[[File:Gasometer in East London.jpg|thumb|A two-lift braced column-supported gas holder in [[West Ham]], East London]]

Before the mid-20th century, [[coal gas]] was produced in [[retort]]s by heating [[coal]] in the absence of air, the process being known as [[coal gasification]]. This was first used for municipal lighting; the gas passed through wooden or metal pipes from the retort to the lantern. The first public piped gas supply was to 13 [[gas lamps]], installed along the length of [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], London in 1807. The credit for this goes to the German inventor and entrepreneur [[Frederick Albert Winsor|Fredrick Winsor]]. Digging up streets to lay pipes [[easement|required legislation]], and this delayed the roll-out of street lighting and the installation of gas for domestic illumination, heating, and cooking.

Many people had experimented with coal distillation to produce a flammable gas. For instance  Jean Tardin (1618), Clayton (1684) [[Jean-Pierre Minckelers]], Leuven (1785) and Pickel (D)(1786). [[William Murdoch]] was successful. He had joined [[Boulton and Watt]], at the Soho manufactory, Birmingham, in 1777, and in 1792 he built a retort to heat coal that produced gas that illuminated his home and office in [[Redruth]]. The system, however, lacked a storage method. [[James Watt Junior]] adapted a Lavoisier gazomètre for this purpose. A gasometer was incorporated into the first small gasworks built for the Soho manufactory in 1798.{{sfn|Thomas|2014|loc= slides 8, 10-11}}

William Murdoch and his pupil [[Samuel Clegg]] installed retorts in individual factories and work places. The earliest example was in 1805, at Lee and Phillips, [[List of mills in Salford|Salford Twist Mill]] where 8 gas holders were installed. {{sfn|Thomas|2014|loc= slide 11}} This was shortly followed by one in Sowerby Bridge, constructed by Clegg for Henry Lodge.   The first independent commercial gas works was built by the [[Gas Light and Coke Company|London and Westminster Gas Light and Coke Company]] in Great Peter Street, Westminster in 1812 laying wooden pipes to illuminate [[Westminster Bridge]] with [[gas lighting|gas lights]] on New Year's Eve in 1813. Public gas lights were seen as a crime reduction measure, and as such, and until the 1840s, regulation lay with the Police Authority rather than the elected council.&lt;ref name="GM Gazetteer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/Guides/Gazeteer/gazzm2n.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211203737/http://www.gmcro.co.uk/Guides/Gazeteer/gazzm2n.htm|archivedate=11 February 2011|title=Greater Manchester Gazetteer|publisher=[[Greater Manchester County Record Office]]|accessdate=9 July 2007|at=Places names – M to N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Safety concerns expressed by the Royal Society, limited the size of gas holders to {{convert|6000|ft3|m3}} and saw them being enclosed in gasometer houses. This concern proved unfounded, and any small leak from an enclosed gas holder created a potentially explosive buildup of air and gas within the building, a far greater danger, and the practice discontinued. In the United States, however, where the gas needed to be protected from extreme weather, gasometer houses continued to be built and were architecturally decorative.{{sfn|Thomas|2014|loc= slides 17}}

By the 1850s, every small to medium-sized town and city had a gas plant to provide for street lighting. Private customers could also have piped lines to their houses. By this era, gas lighting became accepted. The advent of [[incandescent gas lighting]] in factories, homes and in the streets, replacing [[oil lamps]] and [[candles]] with steady clear light, almost matching [[daylight]] in its colour, turned night into day for many—making night [[shift work]] possible in industries where light was all important—in [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]], [[weaving]] and making up garments etc. Gas works were built in almost every town, main streets were brightly illuminated and gas was piped in the streets to the majority of urban households.

[[File:RIAN archive 403 Antiaircraft balloons in Moscow.jpg|thumb| Gas holders in [[Moscow]] in 1941]]
The telescopic gas holder was first invented as early as 1824, the cup and dip (grip) seal was patented by Hutchinson in 1833 :the first working example was built in [[Leeds]]. The benefits of the greatly increased storage the holders provided for local gas works were soon appreciated, and gas holders were built all around the country in great quantities from the middle of the century. The first were the two-lift, column supported type: later they could have four lifts being frame-guided and be retrofitted with an additional flying lift. The large gas holders at [[Kings Cross, London|King's Cross]] were built in the 1860s to provide gas storage for a large part of London.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/10473071/Gasometers-a-brief-history.html|title=Gasometers: a brief history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Gadd of Gadd &amp; Mason, from Manchester invented the spirally-guided gas holder in 1890. Instead of the use of external columns or guide frames, his design operated with spiral rails. The first commercial design was built in [[Northwich]], [[Cheshire]] in the same year. By the end of the century, most towns in Britain had their own gas works and gas holders.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

The inter-war years were marked by the development of improvements in storage, especially the waterless gas holder, and in distribution, with the advent of 2- to 4-inch steel pipes to convey gas at up to {{convert|50|psi|kPa|abbr=on}} as feeder mains to the traditional [[cast iron pipe|cast-iron pipe]]s. Municipal gas works became superfluous in the latter 20th century, but gas holders and production plant was still in use in steel works in 2016.

== Function ==
[[File:gasometer.svg|thumb|Gas holder schematic]]
A gas holder provided storage for the purified, metered gas. It acted as a buffer, removing the need for continuous gas production. The weight of the gas holder lift (cap) controlled the pressure of the gas in the mains, and provided back pressure for the gas-making plant.

A watered gas holder consisted of two parts: a deep tank of water that was used to provide a seal, and a vessel that rose above the water as the gas volume increased. {{sfn|Thomas|2014|loc=slide 12}}

==Types==
[[File:Gasometer with dumpling.svg|thumb|The tank with an internal cone or dumpling.]]
There are two basic types of gas holder: the water-sealed and the rigid waterless.

The water-sealed gas holder consists of a tank of water with a closed vessel (the lift) that rises and falls to take the gas.

Rigid waterless gas holders were a very early design that neither expanded or contracted. There are modern versions of the waterless gas holder, e.g. oil-sealed, grease-sealed and "dry seal" (membrane) types. They consist of a fixed cylinder capped by a moving piston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motherwellbridge.com/index/gasholder-types|title=Gasholder types|author=Super User|work=motherwellbridge.com|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water-sealed gas holders ===
The earliest Boulton and Watt gas holders had a single lift. The tank was above ground and was lined with wood; the lift was guided by tripods and cables.  Pulleys and weights were supplied to regulate the gas pressure.{{sfn|Thomas|2010|p=1}} Brick tanks were introduced in 1818, when a gas holder would have a capacity of {{convert|20000|ft3|m3}}. The engineer [[John Malam]] devised a tank with a central rod-and-tube guide system.

Telescoping holders fall into two subcategories. The earlier of the telescoping variety were column-guided variations and were built from 1824. To guide the telescoping walls, or "lifts", they have an external fixed frame, visible at a fixed height at all times.  A refinement was the guide frame gas holder, where the heavy columns were replaced a lighter and more extensive framework. Vertical girders (standards) were intersected by horizontal girders and cross-braced. This could be bolted onto an underground or aboveground tank. The Cutler patented guide frame dispensed with the horizontal girders using diagonal triangulated framing instead. .{{sfn|Thomas|2010|p=8}} Cable-guided gas holders, invented by Pease in 1880, had a limited use, but were useful on unstable ground where the rigid systems could buckle and jam the lift.{{sfn|Thomas|2010|p=8}}

Spiral-guided gas holders were built in the [[UK]] from 1890 until 1983.  These have no frame, and each lift is guided by the one below, rotating as it goes up as dictated by helical runners. {{sfn|Thomas|2010|p=9}}

Both telescoping types use the [[manometric]] property of water to provide a seal. The whole tank floats in a circular or annular water reservoir, held up by the roughly constant pressure of a varying volume of gas, the pressure determined by the weight of the structure, and the water providing the seal for the gas within the moving walls. Besides storing the gas, the tank's design serves to establish the pressure of the gas system. With telescoping (multiple-lift) tanks, the innermost tank has a ~1&amp;nbsp;ft wide by 2&amp;nbsp;ft high (30x60 cm) lip around the outside of the bottom edge, called a cup, which picks up water as it rises above the reservoir water level. This immediately engages a downward lip on the inner rim of the next outer lift, called a dip or grip, and as this grip sinks into the cup, it preserves the water seal as the inner tank continues to rise until the grip grounds on the cup, whereupon further injection of gas will start to raise that lift as well. Holders were built with as many as four lifts.{{sfn|Thomas|2010|p=11}} An extra flying lift could be retrofitted into column or frame gas holders. This was an additional inner tank that extended above the standards, when the infrastructure would support the extra shear forces and weight. Though not exclusively, spiral guides were used.{{sfn|Thomas|2010|p=9}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Dry-seal-type gas holder ===
[[File:Membrangasbehälter.jpg|thumb|A dry-seal Wiggins-type gas holder]]
Dry-seal gas holders have a static cylindrical shell, within which a piston rises and falls. As it moves, a grease seal, tar/oil seal or a sealing membrane which is rolled out and in from the piston keeps the gas from escaping. The MAN (''Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nürnberg AG'') was introduced in 1915: it was polygonal and used a tar/oil seal. The Klonne dry seal gas holder was circular: it used a grease seal. The ''[[Dry-seal Wiggins gasholder|Dry-seal Wiggins gas holder]]'' was patented in 1952: it used a flexible curtain that was suspended from the piston. {{sfn|Thomas|2014|p=27}} The largest low-pressure gas holders built was the Klonne gas holder built in 1938 in [[Gelsenkirchen]]. It was {{convert| 147|m|ft}} high and {{convert| 80|m|ft}} in diameter, which gave it a capacity of {{convert|594000|m3|ft3}}. There was a MAN type, built in 1934 in Chicago with a capacity of {{convert|566000|m3|ft3}}. {{sfn|Thomas|2014|p=10}}

== Advantage ==
Gas holders hold a large advantage over other methods of storage. They are the only storage method which keeps the gas at district pressure (the pressure required in local gas mains). Once the District Low Pressure Switch falls, and the booster fans come on, the gas in these holders can be at homes, being used, in a very short period of time. Gas is stored in the holder throughout the day, when little gas is being used. At about 5 pm there is a great demand for gas, and the holder will come down, supplying the service area.

However, where the distribution system is robust and contains regulators, the gas holder advantages are made redundant.

== By location ==

=== Europe ===
The pollution associated with [[gasworks]] and gas storage makes the land difficult to [[Land reclamation|reclaim]] for other purposes, but some gas holders, notably in [[Vienna]], have been converted into other uses such as living space and a [[shopping mall]] and historical archives for the city. Many sites, however, were never used for the production of 'town gas', therefore the land contamination is relatively low.

Gas holders have been a major part of the skylines of low-rise British cities for up to 200 years, due to their large distinctive shape and central location. They were originally used for balancing daily demand and generation of [[town gas]]. With the move to [[natural gas]] and construction of the [[National Transmission System|national grid pipework]], their use steadily diminished as the pipe network could both store gas under pressure, and eventually satisfy peak demand directly.&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite web | title = Will the UK's gas holders be missed? | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30405066}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[London]], [[Manchester]], [[Sheffield]], [[Birmingham]], [[Leeds]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Salisbury]] and [[Glasgow]] (which has the [[Provan Gas Works|largest gasometers]] in the UK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = archiseek: The Gasworks, Dublin. | url = http://www.nationalgridproperty.com/pdfs/Gasholder.pdf | format = PDF }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;) are noted for having many gas holders.

[[File:Gas holder 0656.JPG|thumb|A mirrored installation in the re-located [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]] Gas Holder Number 8., London.]]

Some of these gas holders have become [[listed buildings]]. The gas holders behind [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] in London were specially dismantled when the new [[High Speed 1|Channel Tunnel Rail Link]] was being created,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/97855511/St-Pancras-Gasometers|title=St Pancras Gasometers|work=scribd.com|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Gas holder No 8 being re-erected on a nearby site behind [[St Pancras station]] as part of a housing development. It has been fashioned into a park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingscross.co.uk/heritage-gasholder-no-8|title=Historic Gasholder No8 at King's Cross|work=King's Cross|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most gas holders are no longer used, and a program of dismantling is underway to release the land for reuse.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

A gasworks in [[South Lotts]], [[Dublin]], Ireland, was converted into flats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = National Grid Gasholder Demolition Case Study | url = http://www.archiseek.com/content/showthread.php?t=6304 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120723060048/http://www.archiseek.com/content/showthread.php?t=6304 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, holder stations would have an operator living on site controlling their movement. However, with the [[process control]] systems now used on these sites, such an operator is obsolete. The tallest gasometer in [[Europe]] is {{convert|117|m|ft}} tall and is located in [[Oberhausen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Gasometer Oberhausen | url = http://www.gasometer.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.K. as well as other European countries, a movement to preserve classic gasometers has emerged in recent years, especially after Britain's National Grid announced in 2013 their plans to tear down 76 gas holders, and soon afterwards, Southern and Scottish Gas networks announced that they would demolish 111 others. Christopher Costelloe, director of the [[Victorian Society]], a leader in the campaign to preserve the gasometers said, “Gasometers, by their very size and structure, cannot help but become landmarks. [They] are singularly dramatic structures for all their emptiness.”&lt;ref&gt;Sean O'Hagan, [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jun/14/gasometers-gas-holders-hold-on-for-a-new-life-repurposing Gasworks wonders...], The Guardian, 14 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Gasometers are comparatively rare in the United States.  The most notable of these were erected in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] by the Laclede Gas Light Company in the early 20th century.  These gasometers remained in use until the early first decade of the 21st century, when the last one was decommissioned and abandoned in place. The most recently used gasometer in the United States was on the southeast side of [[Indianapolis]], but it has been demolished along with the Citizens Energy Group [[Coker unit|coke plant]].  Another pair of holders at the Newtown Holder Station, in Elmhurst, Queens, in New York City, was a popular landmark for traffic reporters until they were demolished in 1996 and became [[Elmhurst Park]]. The demolition of two larger "Maspeth Tanks" in nearby [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn]], was described by [[The New York Times]] at length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/09/nyregion/last-days-for-brooklyn-s-giants-twin-tanks-carry-love-hate-reputation-end.html?src=pm&amp;pagewanted=2&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;pagewanted=print|title = Last Days for Brooklyn's Giants; Twin Tanks Carry a Love-Hate Reputation to the End|last = Newman|first = Andy|date = July 9, 2001|work = |accessdate = 2014-05-27|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6PtcEdvbN?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/09/nyregion/last-days-for-brooklyn-s-giants-twin-tanks-carry-love-hate-reputation-end.html?src=pm&amp;pagewanted=2&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;pagewanted=print|archivedate = 2014-05-28|deadurl = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large MAN-type gas holder was erected just east of [[Baltimore, Maryland]], by Koppers Inc. in 1949 and operated by [[Baltimore Gas and Electric]] for thirty-two years. The 307-foot-tall, 170-foot-diameter structure, which could hold 7 million cubic feet, was a landmark due to its unusual marking scheme, which had a red-and-white checkerboard pattern from 200 feet up. The structure was demolished in July 1984. {{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

[[File:Gasometer North Melbourne 1928.jpg|thumb|Gasometer and Arden St oval, North Melbourne, in 1928]]

As of 2016, efforts were under way to save a [[Concord Gas Light Company Gasholder House|gas holder building]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concordmonitor.com/Articles/2016/03/From-Archives-1/gasholderfollow-cm-031716 Concord Monitor: "Collapse of entrance roof at historic gasholder building reflects its problems" (March 29, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
Gasholders, though once common, have become rare in Australia. Most gasworks within the country were demolished or repurposed, and few gasometers remain because of this. A good example of a largely intact gasometer is located at the [[Launceston Gasworks]] site in [[Tasmania]]. Though the gas bell has been removed, all other components are intact. The remains of two older 1860s gasometers are also visible on site but only the foundations remain.

For many years, a huge gasholder towered over the [[Arden Street Oval]], the home ground of the [[North Melbourne Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football League]]. Television coverage of [[Australian Rules]] football matches played at the famous ground showed the gasholder dominating the landscape. It was demolished in late 1977/early 1978.

== Other storage systems ==
Gas more recently was stored in large underground reservoirs such as salt caverns. In modern times, however, [[Natural gas storage#Pipeline capacity|line-packing]] is the preferred method.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s it was thought that gas holders could be replaced with high-pressure [[Bullet (pressure vessel)|bullets]] (a cylindrical pressure vessel with hemispherical ends).  However, regulations brought in meant that all new bullets must be built several miles out of towns and cities, and the security of storing large amounts of high-pressure natural gas above ground made them unpopular with local people and [[Committee|councils]].  Bullets are gradually being decommissioned.  It is also possible to store natural gas in [[Liquefied natural gas|liquid form]], and this is widely practised throughout the world.

An '''electrical insulator''' is a material whose internal [[electric charge]]s do not flow freely; very little [[electric current]] will flow through it under the influence of an [[electric field]]. This contrasts with other materials, [[semiconductor]]s and [[electrical conductor|conductors]], which conduct electric current more easily. The property that distinguishes an insulator is its [[resistivity]]; insulators have higher resistivity than semiconductors or conductors.

A perfect insulator does not exist, because even insulators contain small numbers of mobile charges ([[charge carrier]]s) which can carry current.  In addition, all insulators become [[electrically conductive]] when a sufficiently large voltage is applied that the electric field tears [[electron]]s away from the atoms.   This is known as the [[breakdown voltage]] of an insulator.    Some materials such as [[glass]], [[Electrical insulation paper|paper]] and [[polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]], which have high [[resistivity]], are very good electrical insulators.  A much larger class of materials, even though they may have lower bulk resistivity, are still good enough to prevent significant current from flowing at normally used voltages,  and thus are employed as insulation for [[Wiring|electrical wiring]] and [[Electrical cable|cables]].  Examples include rubber-like [[polymer]]s and most [[plastic]]s which can be [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]] or [[thermoplastic]] in nature.

Insulators are used in electrical equipment to support and separate electrical [[Electrical conductor|conductors]] without allowing current through themselves.  An insulating material used in bulk to wrap electrical cables or other equipment is called ''insulation''. The term ''insulator'' is also used more specifically to refer to insulating supports used to attach [[electric power distribution]] or [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] lines to [[utility pole]]s and [[transmission tower]]s.  They support the weight of the suspended wires without allowing the current to flow through the tower to ground.

==Physics of conduction in solids==
Electrical insulation is the absence of [[electrical conduction]]. Electronic [[Electronic band structure|band theory]] (a branch of physics) says that a charge flows if states are available into which electrons can be excited. This allows electrons to gain energy and thereby move through a conductor such as a [[metal]]. If no such states are available, the material is an insulator.

Most (though not all, see [[Mott insulator]]) insulators have a large [[band gap]]. This occurs because the "valence" band containing the highest energy electrons is full, and a large energy gap separates this band from the next band above it. There is always some voltage (called the [[breakdown voltage]]) that gives electrons enough energy to be excited into this band. Once this voltage is exceeded the material ceases being an insulator, and charge begins to pass through it. However, it is usually accompanied by physical or chemical changes that permanently degrade the material's insulating properties.

Materials that lack electron conduction are insulators if they lack other mobile charges as well. For example, if a liquid or gas contains ions, then the ions can be made to flow as an electric current, and the material is a conductor. [[Electrolyte]]s and [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]] contain ions and act as conductors whether or not electron flow is involved.

===Breakdown===
When subjected to a high enough voltage, insulators suffer from the phenomenon of [[electrical breakdown]]. When the electric field applied across an insulating substance exceeds in any location the threshold breakdown field for that substance,  the insulator suddenly becomes a conductor, causing a large increase in current, an [[electric arc]] through the substance.  Electrical breakdown occurs when the [[electric field]] in the material is strong enough to accelerate free [[charge carrier]]s (electrons and ions, which are always present at low concentrations) to a high enough velocity to knock electrons from atoms when they strike them, [[ion]]izing the atoms. These freed electrons and ions are in turn accelerated and strike other atoms, creating more charge carriers, in a [[chain reaction]]. Rapidly the insulator becomes filled with mobile charge carriers, and its [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] drops to a low level.  In a solid, the breakdown voltage is proportional to the [[band gap]] energy. When [[corona discharge]] occurs, the air in a region around a high-voltage conductor can break down and ionise without a catastrophic increase in current. However, if the region of air breakdown extends to another conductor at a different voltage it creates a conductive path between them, and a large current flows through the air, creating an ''[[electric arc]]''. Even a vacuum can suffer a sort of breakdown, but in this case the breakdown or [[vacuum arc]] involves charges ejected from the surface of metal electrodes rather than produced by the vacuum itself.

In addition, all insulators become conductors at very high temperatures as the thermal energy of the valence electrons is sufficient to put them in the conduction band.&lt;ref name="Kakani2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=S. L. Kakani|title=Electronics Theory and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XrSI2C9NlDIC&amp;pg=PA7|date=1 January 2005|publisher=New Age International|isbn=978-81-224-1536-0|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Waygood2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adrian Waygood|title=An Introduction to Electrical Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qHGRTC7h-MC&amp;pg=PT41|date=19 June 2013|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=1-135-07113-6|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain capacitors, shorts between electrodes formed due to dielectric breakdown can disappear when the applied electric field is reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=N.|last2=Gafni|first2=H.|title=The maximum dielectric strength of thin silicon oxide films.|journal=IEEE Trans.

==Uses==
A very flexible coating of an insulator is often applied to electric wire and cable, this is called ''insulated wire''. Wires sometimes don't use an insulating coating, just air, since a solid (e.g. plastic) coating may be impractical.  However, wires that touch each other produce cross connections, [[short circuit]]s, and fire hazards. In [[coaxial cable]] the center conductor must be supported exactly in the middle of the hollow shield to prevent EM wave reflections. Finally, wires that expose voltages higher than 60 V{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} can cause human shock and [[electric shock|electrocution]] hazards. Insulating coatings help to prevent all of these problems.

Some wires have a mechanical covering with no voltage rating{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}—e.g.: service-drop, welding, doorbell, thermostat wire. An insulated wire or cable has a voltage rating and a maximum conductor temperature rating. It may not have an [[ampacity]] (current-carrying capacity) rating, since this is dependent upon the surrounding environment (e.g. ambient temperature).

In electronic systems, [[printed circuit board]]s are made from epoxy plastic and fibreglass. The nonconductive boards support layers of copper foil conductors. In electronic devices, the tiny and delicate active components are embedded within nonconductive [[epoxy]] or [[Phenolic resin|phenolic]] plastics, or within baked glass or ceramic coatings.

In [[semiconductor device|microelectronic components]] such as [[transistor]]s and [[integrated circuit|ICs]], the silicon material is normally a conductor because of doping, but it can easily be selectively transformed into a good insulator by the application of heat and oxygen. Oxidised silicon is [[quartz]], i.e. [[silicon dioxide]], the primary component of glass.

In [[high voltage]] systems containing [[transformer]]s and [[capacitors]], liquid insulator oil is the typical method used for preventing arcs. The oil replaces air in spaces that must support significant voltage without [[electrical breakdown]]. Other high voltage system insulation materials include ceramic or glass wire holders, gas, vacuum, and simply placing wires far enough apart to use air as insulation.

==Telegraph and power transmission insulators==
[[File:Power line with ceramic insulators.jpg|thumb|Power lines with ceramic insulators in [[California]], USA]]

Overhead conductors for high-voltage [[electric power transmission]] are bare, and are insulated by the surrounding air. Conductors for lower voltages in [[Electric power distribution|distribution]] may have some insulation but are often bare as well. Insulating supports called ''insulators'' are required at the points where they are supported by [[utility pole]]s or [[transmission tower]]s. Insulators are also required where the wire enters buildings or electrical devices, such as [[transformer]]s or [[circuit breaker]]s, to insulate the wire from the case. These hollow insulators with a conductor inside them are called [[bushing (electrical)|bushing]]s.

[[File:Ceramic electric insulator.jpg|thumb|upright|left|10 kV ceramic insulator, showing sheds]]

===Material===
Insulators used for high-voltage power transmission are made from [[glass]], [[porcelain]] or [[composite material|composite polymer materials]]. Porcelain insulators are made from [[clay]], [[quartz]] or [[alumina]] and [[feldspar]], and are covered with a smooth glaze to shed water. Insulators made from porcelain rich in alumina are used where high mechanical strength is a criterion. Porcelain has a dielectric strength of about 4–10 kV/mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Recently, some electric utilities have begun converting to polymer [[Composite material|composite]] materials for some types of insulators. These are typically composed of a central rod made of [[fibre reinforced plastic]] and an outer weathershed made of [[Silicone|silicone rubber]] or ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber ([[EPDM rubber|EPDM]]). Composite insulators are less costly, lighter in weight, and have excellent [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] capability. This combination makes them ideal for service in polluted areas. However, these materials do not yet have the long-term proven service life of glass and porcelain.

===Design===
[[File:Fotothek df n-15 0000283 Facharbeiter für Sintererzeugnisse.jpg|thumb|250px|High voltage ceramic bushing during manufacture, before [[Ceramic glaze|glazing]]. ]]

The electrical [[Breakdown voltage|breakdown]] of an insulator due to excessive voltage can occur in one of two ways:
* A ''puncture arc'' is a breakdown and conduction of the material of the insulator, causing an [[electric arc]] through the interior of the insulator. The heat resulting from the arc usually damages the insulator irreparably.  ''Puncture voltage'' is the voltage across the insulator (when installed in its normal manner) that causes a puncture arc.
* A ''flashover arc'' is a breakdown and conduction of the air around or along the surface of the insulator, causing an arc along the outside of the insulator. Insulators are usually designed to withstand [[flashover]] without damage.  ''Flashover voltage'' is the voltage that causes a flash-over arc. 
Most high voltage insulators are designed with a lower flashover voltage than puncture voltage, so they flash over before they puncture, to avoid damage.

Dirt, pollution, salt, and particularly water on the surface of a high voltage insulator can create a conductive path across it, causing leakage currents and flashovers. The flashover voltage can be reduced by more than 50% when the insulator is wet. High voltage insulators for outdoor use are shaped to maximise the length of the leakage path along the surface from one end to the other, called the creepage length, to minimise these leakage currents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

These usually include one or more ''sheds''; downward facing cup-shaped surfaces that act as umbrellas to ensure that the part of the surface leakage path under the 'cup' stays dry in wet weather. Minimum creepage distances are 20–25&amp;nbsp;mm/kV, but must be increased in high pollution or airborne sea-salt areas.

[[File:LIC U70.jpg|thumb|Suspended glass disc insulator unit used in suspension insulator strings for high voltage transmission lines]]

===Types of insulators===
These are the common classes of insulator:{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
*''[[Pin insulator|Pin type insulator]]'' - As the name suggests, the pin type insulator is mounted on a pin on the cross-arm on the pole. There is a groove on the upper end of the insulator. The conductor passes through this groove and is tied to the insulator with annealed wire of the same material as the conductor. Pin type insulators are used for transmission and distribution of communications, and electric power at voltages up to 33 kV. Insulators made for operating voltages between 33kV and 69kV tend to be very bulky and have become uneconomical in recent years.
*''Post insulator'' - A type of insulator in the 1930s that is more compact than traditional pin-type insulators and which has rapidly replaced many pin-type insulators on lines up to 69kV and in some configurations, can be made for operation at up to 115kV.
*''Suspension insulator'' - For voltages greater than 33 kV, it is a usual practice to use suspension type insulators, consisting of a number of glass or porcelain discs connected in series by metal links in the form of a string. The conductor is suspended at the bottom end of this string while the top end is secured to the cross-arm of the tower. The number of disc units used depends on the voltage.
*''[[Strain insulator]]'' - A ''dead end'' or ''anchor'' pole or tower is used where a straight section of line ends, or angles off in another direction.  These poles must withstand the lateral (horizontal) tension of the long straight section of wire. To support this lateral load, strain insulators are used. For low voltage lines (less than 11 kV), shackle insulators are used as strain insulators. However, for high voltage transmission lines, strings of cap-and-pin (suspension) insulators are used, attached to the crossarm in a horizontal direction. When the tension load in lines is exceedingly high, such as at long river spans, two or more strings are used in parallel.
*[[File:3phceramicins.jpg|thumb|A three phase insulator used on distribution lines, typically 13.8KV pase to phase.  The lines are held in a diamond pattern, multiple insulators used between poles.]]''Shackle insulator'' - In early days, the shackle insulators were used as strain insulators. But nowaday, they are frequently used for low voltage distribution lines. Such insulators can be used either in a horizontal position or in a vertical position. They can be directly fixed to the pole with a bolt or to the cross arm.
*''[[Bushing (electrical)|Bushing]]'' - enables one or several conductors to pass through a partition such as a wall or a tank, and insulates the conductors from it.&lt;ref&gt;IEC 60137:2003. 'Insulated bushings for alternating voltages
above 1,000 V.' IEC, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Line post insulator''
*''Station post insulator''
*''Cut-out'' 

===Suspension insulators ===

Pin-type insulators are unsuitable for voltages greater than about 69 kV line-to-line. Higher transmission voltages use suspension insulator strings, which can be made for any practical transmission voltage by adding insulator elements to the string.&lt;ref name=STDHBK&gt;Donald G. Fink, H. Wayne Beaty (ed).,''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, 11th Edition'',McGraw-Hill, 1978, {{ISBN|0-07-020974-X}}, pages 14-153, 14-154&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher voltage [[transmission line]]s usually use modular suspension insulator designs. The wires are suspended from a 'string' of identical disc-shaped insulators that attach to each other with metal [[clevis pin]] or ball and socket links. The advantage of this design is that insulator strings with different [[breakdown voltage]]s, for use with different line voltages, can be constructed by using different numbers of the basic units. Also, if one of the insulator units in the string breaks, it can be replaced without discarding the entire string.

Each unit is constructed of a ceramic or glass disc with a metal cap and pin cemented to opposite sides. To make defective units obvious, glass units are designed so that an overvoltage causes a puncture arc through the glass instead of a flashover. The glass is heat-treated so it shatters, making the damaged unit visible. However the mechanical strength of the unit is unchanged, so the insulator string stays together.

Standard suspension disc insulator units are {{convert|25|cm|in}} in diameter and {{convert|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long, can support a load of 80-120 k[[Newton (unit)|N]] (18-27 k[[Pound (force)|lbf]]), have a dry flashover voltage of about 72 kV, and are rated at an operating voltage of 10-12 kV.&lt;ref name="Grigsby"&gt;{{cite book| last = Grigsby| first = Leonard L.| title = The Electric Power Engineering Handbook| url = https://books.google.com/?id=wiv1tuMDbTEC&amp;pg=PA1346| year = 2001| publisher = [[CRC Press]]| location = USA| isbn = 0-8493-8578-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the flashover voltage of a string is less than the sum of its component discs, because the electric field is not distributed evenly across the string but is strongest at the disc nearest to the conductor, which flashes over first. Metal ''[[grading ring]]s'' are sometimes added around the disc at the high voltage end, to reduce the electric field across that disc and improve flashover voltage.

In very high voltage lines the insulator may be surrounded by [[corona ring]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bakshi| first = M| title = Electrical Power Transmission and Distribution| url = https://books.google.com/?id=REww2ZF2RwwC| year = 2007| publisher = Technical Publications| isbn = 978-81-8431-271-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   These typically consist of [[torus]]es of aluminium (most commonly) or copper tubing attached to the line. They are designed to reduce the electric field at the point where the insulator is attached to the line, to prevent [[corona discharge]], which results in power losses.

[[File:Pole Route.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A recent photo of an open wire telegraph pole route with porcelain insulators. [[Quidenham]], [[Norfolk]], [[United Kingdom]].]]

===History===
The first electrical systems to make use of insulators were [[telegraph]] lines; direct attachment of wires to wooden poles was found to give very poor results, especially during damp weather.

The first glass insulators used in large quantities had an unthreaded pinhole. These pieces of glass were positioned on a tapered wooden pin, vertically extending upwards from the pole's crossarm (commonly only two insulators to a pole and maybe one on top of the pole itself). Natural contraction and expansion of the wires tied to these "threadless insulators" resulted in insulators unseating from their pins, requiring manual reseating.

Amongst the first to produce ceramic insulators were companies in the United Kingdom, with Stiff and [[Royal Doulton|Doulton]] using [[stoneware]] from the mid-1840s, Joseph Bourne (later renamed [[Denby Pottery Company|Denby]]) producing them from around 1860 and Bullers from 1868. [[patent|Utility patent]] number [http://reference.insulators.info/patents/detail/?patent=48906&amp;type=U 48,906] was granted to Louis A. Cauvet on 25 July 1865 for a process to produce insulators with a threaded pinhole: pin-type insulators still have threaded pinholes.

The invention of suspension-type insulators made high-voltage power transmission possible. As transmission line voltages reached and passed 60,000 volts, the insulators required become very large and heavy, with insulators made for a safety margin of 88,000 volts being about the practical limit for manufacturing and installation. Suspension insulators, on the other hand, can be connected into strings as long as required for the line's voltage.

A large variety of telephone, telegraph and power insulators have been made; some people collect them, both for their historic interest and for the aesthetic quality of many insulator designs and finishes. One collectors organisation is the US National Insulator Association, which has over 9,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nia.org/|title=Insulators : National Insulator Association Home Page|website=www.nia.org|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insulation of antennas==
[[File:Tamagaishi.jpg|thumb|250px|Egg shaped strain insulator]]
Often a [[broadcasting]] [[radio antenna]] is built as a [[mast radiator]], which means that the entire mast structure is energised with high voltage and must be insulated from the ground. [[Steatite]] mountings are used. They have to withstand not only the voltage of the mast radiator to ground, which can reach values up to 400 kV at some antennas, but also the weight of the mast construction and dynamic forces. [[Arcing horns]] and [[lightning arrester]]s are necessary because lightning strikes to the mast are common.

[[Guy wire]]s supporting antenna masts usually have [[strain insulator]]s inserted in the cable run, to keep the high voltages on the antenna from short circuiting to ground or creating a shock hazard. Often guy cables have several insulators, placed to break up the cable into lengths unwanted electrical [[resonance]]s in the guy. These insulators are usually ceramic and cylindrical or egg-shaped (see picture). This construction has the advantage that the ceramic is under compression rather than tension, so it can withstand greater load, and that if the insulator breaks, the cable ends are still linked.

These insulators also have to be equipped with overvoltage protection equipment. For the dimensions of the guy insulation, static charges on guys have to be considered. At high masts these can be much higher than the voltage caused by the transmitter, requiring guys divided by insulators in multiple sections on the highest masts. In this case, guys which are grounded at the anchor basements via a coil - or if possible, directly - are the better choice.

[[Feedline]]s attaching antennas to radio equipment, particularly [[twin lead]] type, often must be kept at a distance from metal structures. The insulated supports used for this purpose are called ''standoff insulators''.

==Insulation in electrical apparatus==
The most important insulation material is air. A variety of solid, liquid, and [[dielectric gas|gaseous]] insulators are also used in electrical apparatus. In smaller [[transformer]]s, [[electrical generator|generators]], and [[electric motor]]s, insulation on the wire coils consists of up to four thin layers of polymer varnish film. Film insulated '''magnet wire''' permits a manufacturer to obtain the maximum number of turns within the available space. Windings that use thicker conductors are often wrapped with supplemental fiberglass [[insulating tape]]. Windings may also be impregnated with insulating varnishes to prevent [[corona discharge|electrical corona]] and reduce magnetically induced wire vibration. Large power transformer windings are still mostly insulated with [[Electrical insulation paper|paper]], wood, varnish, and [[mineral oil]]; although these materials have been used for more than 100 years, they still provide a good balance of economy and adequate performance. [[Busbar]]s and [[circuit breaker]]s in [[switchgear]] may be insulated with glass-reinforced plastic insulation, treated to have low flame spread and to prevent tracking of current across the material.

In older apparatus made up to the early 1970s, boards made of compressed [[asbestos]] may be found; while this is an adequate insulator at power frequencies, handling or repairs to asbestos material can release dangerous fibers into the air and must be carried cautiously. Wire insulated with felted asbestos was used in high-temperature and rugged applications from the 1920s. Wire of this type was sold by [[General Electric]] under the trade name "Deltabeston."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Bernhard, Frank|author2=Frank H. Bernhard| title = EMF Electrical Year Book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=pf5MAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA822| year = 1921| publisher = Electrical Trade Pub. Co.| page = 822 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Live-front switchboards up to the early part of the 20th century were made of slate or marble. Some high voltage equipment is designed to operate within a high pressure [[insulating gas]] such as [[sulfur hexafluoride]]. Insulation materials that perform well at power and low frequencies may be unsatisfactory at [[radio frequency]], due to heating from excessive dielectric dissipation.

Electrical wires may be insulated with [[polyethylene]], crosslinked polyethylene (either through [[electron beam processing]] or chemical crosslinking), [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[Kapton]], rubber-like polymers, oil impregnated paper, [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]], silicone, or modified ethylene tetrafluoroethylene ([[ETFE]]). Larger [[power cable]]s may use [[mineral-insulated copper-clad cable|compressed inorganic powder]], depending on the application.

Flexible insulating materials such as [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC (polyvinyl chloride)]] are used to insulate the circuit and prevent human contact with a 'live' wire – one having voltage of 600 volts or less. Alternative materials are likely to become increasingly used due to EU safety and environmental legislation making PVC less economic.

===Class 1 and Class 2 insulation===
{{Main|Appliance classes}}
All portable or hand-held electrical devices are insulated to protect their user from harmful shock.

Class 1 insulation requires that the metal body and other exposed metal parts of the device be connected to earth via a ''grounding wire'' that is [[earth (electricity)|earth]]ed at the main service panel—but only needs basic insulation on the conductors. This equipment needs an extra pin on the [[power plug]] for the grounding connection.

Class 2 insulation means that the device is ''double insulated''. This is used on some appliances such as electric shavers, hair dryers and portable power tools. Double insulation requires that the devices have both basic and supplementary insulation, each of which is sufficient to prevent [[electric shock]]. All internal electrically energized components are totally enclosed within an insulated body that prevents any contact with "live" parts. In the [[European Union|EU]], double insulated appliances all are marked with a symbol of two squares, one inside the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Understanding IEC Appliance Insulation Classes: I, II and III |url= http://www.fiduspower.com/news/understanding-iec-appliance-insulation-classes-i-ii-and-iii|work=Fidus Power |date=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Clipperton''' (1676 – June 1722) was an English [[privateer]] who fought against the Spanish in the 18th century. He was involved in two [[buccaneer]]ing expeditions to the South Pacific—the first led by [[William Dampier]] in 1703, and the second under his own command in 1719. He used [[Clipperton Island]] in the eastern Pacific Ocean as a base for his raids.

==Early life and personality==
John Clipperton was born in [[Great Yarmouth]], [[Norfolk]], in 1676 into a family of seafarers. In his younger days he sailed all the seas of Europe, made one trip to the [[West Indies]] and one around the world. He was an able pilot and seaman, but also a man of faults. He was a blunt, plain-spoken [[sailor]]. He was definitely no gentleman; but at times tried to be seen as one. Rash fits of rage would befall him, although he was soon appeased. Then he would be ready to repair any injustice that he had committed in the heat of anger—at least when this was possible.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

==Privateering voyage with Dampier==
[[File:Bahía de Guayaquil según el pirata John Clipperton y dedicado al Conde Robert de Oxford - AHG.jpg|left|thumb|220px|[[Gulf of Guayaquil|Bahia of Guayaquil]] on the [[Spanish Main]], as seen by Clipperton]]
In 1703 he sailed with the expedition of Captain [[William Dampier]] during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. Dampier appointed Clipperton [[captain (nautical)|captain]] of one of the Spanish ships they had taken as a [[prize ship|prize]]. This first voyage of Clipperton did not proceed well. He led a mutiny against Dampier, and was later taken captive by the Spanish. The Marquis de Villa-Rocha, who would subsequently become governor of Panama, treated him with much indifference. Clipperton returned home in 1712 after four years of captivity.

It was, however, during this journey that he is said to have discovered [[Clipperton Island]], which he would use as a hideout. He would later become captain of the ''Success'' as part of a different privateering syndicate, in which he also held under his nominal command Captain [[George Shelvocke]] of the ''Speedwell''. In his activities attacking Spanish targets on the west coast of the Americas, he used [[Clipperton Island]] as a base from which to stage his attacks and store loot and supplies, fortifying Clipperton Rock and expanding its cave network.

==Later privateering expedition==
Much more is known about Clipperton's second voyage to the Pacific Ocean in 1719. By that time he had become an able and diligent captain, but he was still unable to control his rash temper. In 1718 a group of London merchants, the "Gentleman Venturers", had financed a privateering expedition in expectation of the outbreak of the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]], with a [[letters of marque|commission]] to cruise against the Spanish in the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Sea]]. Clipperton in the ''Success'' sailed with the ''Speedwell'', captained by George Shelvocke. Clipperton had replaced Shelvocke as overall commander of the expedition before the two ships left [[Plymouth]] in February 1719.

The ships lost contact with each other shortly after during a storm in the [[Bay of Biscay]] and did not meet up again until nearly two years later in the Pacific. On the voyage around [[Cape Horn]], Clipperton dallied in the islands there hoping that ''Speedwell'', which had been separated from ''Success'' in the storm, would catch up. When the ''Success'' departed the area, Clipperton left two men marooned as punishment on [[Juan Fernández Islands|Juan Fernández]], which [[Alexander Selkirk]] (who may have partly inspired the [[Robinson Crusoe]] story) had been marooned on years before.

Clipperton sailed right around South America, raiding Spanish shipping about the coasts of Perú at the so-called "Southern Seas", where he was chased by Spanish admiral [[Blas de Lezo]] during the latter's first safety operations in the area. The privateer managed to escape Blas de Lezo and finally fled to Asian shores, where he was taken for dead. He captured his old enemy the Marquis de Villa-Rocha, whom he treated with much respect. Later, his travels carried him to Mexico and to [[Macau]], where he stayed as his health deteriorated.  He then sailed to [[Jakarta|Batavia]] (now Jakarta) in the [[Dutch East Indies]], finally returning to his family in [[Galway]] in Ireland in June 1722. He died a week after returning home.

'''Lewis H. Nash''' (1852 &amp;ndash; November 11, 1923) was an American engineer who invented the [[liquid ring|liquid-ring-vacuum pump]], and was the holder of over a hundred United States patents for pumps, engines, and other equipment. He founded the Nash Engineering Company in 1905, and served as a member of the [[Connecticut House of Representatives]].

==Education and early career==
Nash completed his public school education in [[South Norwalk, Connecticut]], in 1869. As his parents were unable to pay for college,   he took an apprenticeship course as a machinist at the Norwalk Iron Works. He next enrolled at a new institution, the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]], which offered courses in the new field of [[Mechanical Engineering]]. He joined its third class, and graduated as class [[valedictorian]].

Nash initially found his apprenticeship was of greater value in securing work than his degree, so he worked as a machinist in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. In the meantime, he continued to work on a design he had conceived while in college for a new type of water measuring device. He built a model and took it to the National Meter Company of [[Brooklyn, New York]]. Though the device did not work satisfactorily in a test, its merits were appreciated, and he was employed with instructions to perfect the meter.

==Water meters==
In a few months, Nash produced the "Crown" meter, the first of a large class of single-piston rotary meters, which practically superseded all other forms of water meters at that time. He received over sixty patents for water meters.

One type of meter, the "Gem", was built in sizes up to {{convert|36|in}}. The quantity of water that could be delivered by such a meter was nearly {{convert|500000|USgal/hour|m3/h}}. This presented a problem in testing, as that amount of water could never be taken from the water supply of any city. In fact, a single meter of that size would pass enough water to supply a large town. Nash was given the task of devising a testing plant which re-circulated the water. He accomplished this by the use of a vertical screw pump which lifts the water to a reservoir, from which it passes through the meter to be tested and thence over a [[weir]], where it is measured. The device and the meters both proved to be accurate.

==Gas engines==
After seven years at the National Meter Company, Nash began the study of the gas engine and subsequently received sixty or more patents covering their design and operation. Many of them were extensively used by engine manufacturers, including the [[two cycle engine]] with piston controlled valves. Another patent covered the starting of gas engines by the use of compressed air, and this feature was adopted by all makes of large gas engines. The National Meter Company built the Nash engine in sizes up to about {{convert|400|hp}}. These engines were used in municipal electric lighting and pumping plants as well as for general power purposes. Probably the largest installation of the Nash Engine was at the Phoenix Tube Company in [[Brooklyn, New York]], and consisted of two Nash gas engines, totaling {{convert|500|hp}}, operating on producer gas. The engines were directly connected to dynamos and although they operated under violently fluctuating load conditions, they ran well, both in regulation and economy modes. The company claimed that the Nash gas engine running on producer gas, using [[anthracite]] buckwheat coal, was the most economical of power products, costing twenty cents per {{convert|100|hph}}.

Nash became chief engineer of the company, but his relations with them were not the best. The company never prosecuted infringements of their gas engine patents, and Nash's efforts were mostly unappreciated, for those at the head of the business not only failed to push his developments, but continually curtailed his authority.

==Nash Engineering Company==
When Nash conceived the idea of a new type of vacuum pumping equipment, he decided not to assign the patents to the National Meter Company, but to manufacture the product himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent | country = US | number = 1091529| status = | title =Pump and air-compressor | pubdate =Mar 31, 1914 | gdate = | fdate = | pridate = | inventor =Lewis Hallock Nash | invent1 = | invent2 = | assign1 =Nash Engineering company| assign2 = | class =}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the beginning of the '''Nash Engineering Company''' (NEC), which initially had its offices on the third floor of his residence. In 1905, two of his friends joined to become officers and directors of the new corporation.

After three years of designing and testing, manufacture was started at a factory over a shop on Water Street in South Norwalk. In 1911, Nash and his family moved to South Norwalk, and three years later he severed his connections with the National Meter Company to devote his entire time to his own firm.  In 1909 Irving C. Jennings was hired part-time to help in testing pump technology, receiving pay in the form of company stock.

While rounding out a line of vacuum pumps and compressors and of creating a demand for the pumps was slow. A micrometer plug gauge, another invention of Nash's, was made and generated enough profits to keep the company afloat. In 1912, a steady demand had been found for the pumps, and the first floor of the present building on Wilson Point Road was erected. The building was designed and built entirely from his plans and figures of Nash.

In that year, Nash's eldest son Douglas graduated from [[Stevens Institute of Technology]], and it was his first task to superintend the construction of the new factory. Two years later, [[Harold L. Nash|Harold]], Nash's other son, became affiliated with the NEC after graduating from Stevens. The five years from 1918 to his death on November 17, 1923, Nash saw his company grow to be a prosperous, well-established concern, and was he able spend most of his time in his laboratory, where he could work out his many inventions and ideas. After his death Irving C. Jennings appointed was president of the NEC. In 1949 Ben Nash{{clarify|date=June 2016}} graduated from the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic]] and joined the NEC full-time. In 1958 Douglas Nash took over as president of the company with Irving Jennings as honorary chairman of the board. On the retirement of Douglas and Harold Nash in 1962 Benjamin Nash was elected as company resident.

During [[World War I]], he and his son, Harold, were working on an aeroplane engine which received favorable comment from the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] and engineers such as [[Elmer Sperry]], the inventor of the gyroscopic compass and stabilizing devices. The war ended before the engine was fully developed, and the idea was dropped.

During the early years, NASH developed vacuum stream heating systems and vacuum sewage collection systems for many of the growing USA cities. NASH also developed vacuum pumps{{sfn|Bloch|2006|p=137-}}{{sfn|Forsthoffer|2005|p=132-}} which were applied in the manufacture of pulp and paper and in the sugar industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mulford|first1= J.

[[File:Nocturnal Light Pillars.jpg|thumb|Nocturnal light pillars, [[Cambridge Bay]], [[Nunavut]], [[Canada]]]]
A '''light pillar''' is an [[atmospheric optics|atmospheric optical]] phenomenon in the form of a vertical band of light which appears to extend above and/or below a light source. The effect is created by the [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] of [[light]] from numerous tiny [[ice crystal]]s suspended in the atmosphere or clouds. The light can come from the [[Sun]] (usually when it is near or even below the horizon) in which case the phenomenon is called a '''sun pillar''' or '''solar pillar'''. It can also come from the [[Moon]] or from terrestrial sources such as streetlights.

== Formation ==
[[File:Light Pillars Scheme.svg|thumb|Scheme of light pillars formation]]
Since they are caused by the interaction of light with ice crystals, light pillars belong to the family of [[halo (optical phenomenon)|halos]]. The crystals responsible for light pillars usually consist of flat, hexagonal plates, which tend to orient themselves more or less horizontally as they fall through the air. Their collective surfaces act as a giant mirror, which reflects the light source upwards and/or downwards into a virtual image. As the crystals are disturbed by [[turbulence]], the angle of their surfaces deviates some degrees from the horizontal orientation, causing the reflection (i.e. the light pillar) to become elongated into a column. The larger the crystals, the more pronounced this effect becomes. More rarely, column-shaped crystals can cause light pillars as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/colpill.htm|title=Sun pillars from column crystals|website=www.atoptics.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In very cold weather, the ice crystals can be suspended near the ground, in which case they are referred to as [[diamond dust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap131218.html|title=APOD: 2013 December 18 – Light Pillars over Finland|website=apod.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike a [[light beam]], a light pillar is not physically located above or below the light source. Its appearance of a vertical line is an [[optical illusion]], resulting from the collective reflection off the ice crystals, only those of which that appear to lie in a vertical line direct the light rays towards the observer (similar to the reflection of a light source in a body of water).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/lpil.htm|title=Light Pillars|website=www.atoptics.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37821">Leaders of states in the U.S. which have significant mineral deposits often create a '''state mineral, rock, [[stone]] or gemstone''' to promote interest in their natural resources, history, tourism, etc. Not every state has an official state mineral, rock, stone and/or gemstone, however.

In the chart below, a year which is listed within parentheses represents the year during which that mineral, rock, stone or gemstone was officially adopted as a state symbol or emblem.

| {{note label|notabene_A|A|none}} California in 1965 became the first state to name an official state rock. A 2010 effort led by State Senator [[Gloria J. Romero]], a Democrat from [[Los Angeles]], sought to remove [[Serpentinite|serpentine]] from its perch as the state's official stone. Organizations such as the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization have supported the move as the olive green rock is a source of [[chrysotile]], a form of [[asbestos]] that can cause [[mesothelioma]] and other forms of cancer. Geologists have rallied to oppose the bill, arguing that there is no way to be harmed from casual exposure to serpentine.&lt;ref&gt;Steinhauer, Jennifer. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/us/14rock.html "California May Drop Rock, and Geologists Feel the Pain"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 13, 2010.

[[File:Lunar Total Eclipse on July 27, 2018 (100 2006) (43696968392) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Totality during the [[July 2018 lunar eclipse|lunar eclipse of 27 July 2018]]. Direct sunlight is being blocked by the [[Earth]], and the only light reaching it is sunlight [[Atmospheric refraction|refracted]] by Earth's atmosphere, producing a reddish color.]]
 
A '''lunar eclipse''' occurs when the [[Moon]] passes directly behind [[Earth]] and into [[Earth's shadow|its shadow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://earthsky.org/tonight/centurys-longest-lunar-eclipse-july-27
|title=Century's Longest Lunar Eclipse July 27
|first=Bruce |last=McClure |date=July 27, 2018
|website=[[EarthSky]]
|access-date=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can occur only when the [[Sun]], Earth, and Moon are exactly or very closely aligned (in [[syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]]), with Earth between the other two. A lunar eclipse can occur only on the night of a [[full moon]]. The type and length of a lunar eclipse depend on the Moon's proximity to [[lunar node|either node]] of [[orbit of the Moon|its orbit]].

During a total lunar eclipse, Earth completely blocks direct [[sunlight]] from reaching the Moon. The only light [[diffuse reflection|reflected]] from the lunar surface has been [[atmospheric refraction|refracted]] by [[Earth's atmosphere]]. This light appears reddish for the same reason that a [[sunset]] or [[sunrise]] does: the [[Rayleigh scattering]] of bluer light. Due to this reddish color, a totally eclipsed Moon is sometimes called a '''blood moon'''.

Unlike a [[solar eclipse]], which can be viewed only from a certain relatively small area of the world, a lunar eclipse may be viewed from anywhere on the [[night]] side of Earth. A total lunar eclipse lasts a few hours, whereas a total solar eclipse lasts only a few minutes as viewed from any given place, due to the smaller size of the Moon's [[umbra, penumbra, and antumbra|shadow]]. Also unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are safe to view without any [[astronomical filter|eye protection]] or special precautions, as they are dimmer than the full Moon.

For the date of the next eclipse, see the section ''[[Lunar eclipse#Recent and forthcoming lunar eclipses|Recent and forthcoming lunar eclipses]]''.

==Types of lunar eclipse {{anchor|Penumbral eclipse}}&lt;!-- [[Penumbral eclipse]] redirects here --&gt;==
[[File:Geometry of a Lunar Eclipse.svg|thumb|240px|left|A schematic diagram of the [[Earth's shadow|shadow]] cast by [[Earth]]. Within the [[umbra]], the central region, the planet totally shields direct [[sunlight]]. In contrast, within the [[penumbra]], the outer portion, the sunlight is only partially blocked. (Neither the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and Earth sizes nor the distances between the bodies are to scale.)]]
[[File:Penumbral lunar eclipse 1999 jan 31.png|thumb|240px|middle|A [[total penumbral lunar eclipse]] dims the Moon in direct proportion to the area of the Sun's disk covered by Earth. This comparison of the Moon (within the southern part of [[Earth's shadow]]) during the penumbral lunar eclipse of [[January 1999 lunar eclipse|January 1999]] (left) and the Moon outside the shadow (right) shows this slight darkening.]]

[[Earth's shadow]] can be divided into two distinctive parts: the [[umbra]] and [[penumbra]]. Earth totally occludes direct [[solar radiation]] within the umbra, the central region of the shadow. However, since the Sun's [[angular diameter|diameter appears]] about one-quarter of Earth's in the [[Extraterrestrial skies#The Moon|lunar sky]], the planet only partially blocks direct [[sunlight]] within the penumbra, the outer portion of the shadow.

A '''penumbral lunar eclipse''' occurs when the Moon passes through Earth's penumbra. The penumbra causes a subtle dimming of the lunar surface. A special type of penumbral eclipse is a '''[[total penumbral lunar eclipse]]''', during which the Moon lies exclusively within Earth's penumbra. Total penumbral eclipses are rare, and when these occur, the portion of the Moon closest to the umbra may appear slightly darker than the rest of the lunar disk.

A '''partial lunar eclipse''' occurs when only a portion of the Moon enters Earth's umbra, while a '''total lunar eclipse''' occurs when the entire Moon enters the planet's umbra. The Moon's average [[orbital speed]] is about {{convert|2300|mph|km/s|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}, or a little more than its diameter per hour, so totality may last up to nearly 107 minutes. Nevertheless, the total time between the first and the last contacts of the Moon's limb with Earth's shadow is much longer and could last up to four hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamental Astronomy |first=Hannu |last=Karttunen |publisher=Springer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DjeVdb0sLEAC&amp;pg=PA139|isbn=9783540341444 |date=2007|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[lunar distance (astronomy)|relative distance]] of the Moon from Earth at the time of an eclipse can affect the eclipse's duration. In particular, when the Moon is near [[apogee]],the farthest point from Earth in [[orbit of the Moon|its orbit]], its [[orbital speed]] is the slowest. The diameter of Earth's umbra does not decrease appreciably within the changes in the Moon's orbital distance. Thus, the concurrence of a totally eclipsed Moon near apogee will lengthen the duration of totality.

A '''central lunar eclipse''' is a total lunar eclipse during which the Moon passes through the centre of Earth's shadow, contacting the [[antisolar point]]. This type of lunar eclipse is [[list of central lunar eclipses|relatively rare]].

===Selenelion===
[[File:Lunar eclipse at sunrise Minneapolis October 2014.png|thumb|A view of the [[October 2014 lunar eclipse]] from [[Minneapolis]], with the setting and partially eclipsed Moon [[atmospheric refraction|appearing squashed]] just above the horizon just after [[sunrise]] (seen as [[sunlight]] shining on the tree in the right image)]]

A '''selenelion''' or '''selenehelion''' occurs when both the Sun and an eclipsed Moon can be observed at the same time. This can occur only just before [[sunset]] or just after [[sunrise]], when both bodies will appear just above the [[horizon]] at nearly [[opposition (planets)|opposite points]] in the sky. This arrangement has led to the phenomenon being also called a '''horizontal eclipse'''.

Typically, a number of high ridges undergoing [[false sunrise|sunrise]] or [[false sunset|sunset]] can view it. Although the Moon is in Earth's umbra, both the Sun and an eclipsed Moon can be simultaneously seen because [[atmospheric refraction]] causes each body to [[Mirage#Superior mirage|appear higher]] in the sky than their true geometric positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/community/skyblog/observingblog/97224024.html |title=Observing Blog - In Search of Selenelion |work=[[Sky &amp; Telescope]] |author= |date=2010-06-26 |accessdate=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timing==
[[File:Lunareclipsediagram.svg|thumb|280px|right|As viewed from Earth, the Earth’s shadow can be imagined as two concentric circles. As the diagram illustrates, the type of lunar eclipse is defined by the path taken by the Moon as it passes through Earth’s shadow. If the Moon passes through the outer circle but does not reach the inner circle, it is a penumbral eclipse; if only a portion of the moon passes through the inner circle, it is a partial eclipse; and if entire Moon passes through the inner circle at some point, it is a total eclipse.]] 
[[File:Lunar eclipse contact diagram.svg|thumb|left|Contact points relative to the Earth's umbral and penumbral shadows, here with the Moon near is descending node]]
{{Total_lunar_eclipse_contacts}}

==Danjon scale==
The following scale (the [[Danjon scale]]) was devised by [[André Danjon]] for rating the overall darkness of lunar eclipses:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Observing and Photographing Lunar Eclipses |url =http://skytonight.com/observing/objects/eclipses/3304036.html |authors=Paul Deans and Alan M. MacRobert |work=[[Sky &amp; Telescope]] |publisher=[[F+W]] |date=July 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''L=0''': Very dark eclipse. Moon almost invisible, especially at mid-totality.
:'''L=1''': Dark eclipse, gray or brownish in coloration. Details distinguishable only with difficulty.
:'''L=2''': Deep red or rust-colored eclipse. Very dark central shadow, while outer edge of umbra is relatively bright.
:'''L=3''': Brick-red eclipse. Umbral shadow usually has a bright or yellow rim.
:'''L=4''': Very bright copper-red or orange eclipse. Umbral shadow is bluish and has a very bright rim.

==Lunar versus solar eclipse==
[[File:Solar lunar eclipse diagram.png|320px|thumb|A solar eclipse occurs in the daytime at [[new moon]], when the Moon is between Earth and the Sun, while a lunar eclipse occurs at night at [[full moon]], when Earth passes between the Sun and the Moon.]]
[[File:Blood Moon Corrected Labels.png|320px|thumb|The Moon does not completely darken as it passes through the umbra because [[Earth's atmosphere]] [[atmospheric refraction|refracts]] [[sunlight]] into the shadow cone.]]

There is often confusion between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse. While both involve interactions between the Sun, Earth, and the Moon, they are very different in their interactions.

===Lunar eclipse appearance===
[[File:Lunar eclipse oct 8 2014 Minneapolis 4 46am.png|thumb|320px|left|In a lunar eclipse, the Moon often passes through two regions of [[Earth's shadow]]: an outer penumbra, where direct sunlight is dimmed, and an inner umbra, where indirect and much dimmer sunlight [[atmospheric refraction|refracted]] by Earth's atmosphere shines on the Moon, leaving a reddish color. This can be seen in different exposures of a partial lunar eclipse, for example here with exposures of 1/80, 2/5, and 2 seconds.]]

The Moon does not completely darken as it passes through the umbra because of the [[atmospheric refraction|refraction]] of [[sunlight]] by [[Earth's atmosphere]] into the shadow cone; if Earth had no atmosphere, the Moon would be completely dark during the eclipse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEcat5/appearance.html |title=Visual Appearance of Lunar Eclipses |publisher=NASA |authors=Fred Espenak and Jean Meeus |quote=The troposphere and stratosphere act together as a ring-shaped lens that refracts heavily reddened sunlight into Earth's umbral shadow.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reddish coloration arises because sunlight reaching the Moon must pass through a long and dense layer of Earth's atmosphere, where it is [[Rayleigh scattering|scattered]]. Shorter [[wavelength]]s are more likely to be scattered by the air molecules and [[particulates|small particles]]; thus, the longer wavelengths predominate by the time the light rays have penetrated the atmosphere. Human vision perceives this resulting light as [[red]]. This is the same effect that causes [[sunset]]s and [[sunrise]]s to turn the sky a reddish color. An alternative way of conceiving this scenario is to realize that, as viewed from the Moon, the Sun would appear to be setting (or rising) behind Earth.

[[File:Lunar eclipse from moon simulation-sep 28 2015.png|thumb|180px|From the Moon, a lunar eclipse would show a ring of reddish-orange light surrounding a silhouetted Earth in the lunar sky.]]

The amount of refracted light depends on the amount of [[particulates|dust]] or [[cloud]]s in the atmosphere; this also controls how much light is scattered. In general, the dustier the atmosphere, the more that other wavelengths of light will be removed (compared to red light), leaving the resulting light a deeper red color. This causes the resulting coppery-red hue of the Moon to vary from one eclipse to the next. Volcanoes are notable for expelling large quantities of dust into the atmosphere, and a large eruption shortly before an eclipse can have a large effect on the resulting color.

[[File:Eclipse Christophe Colomb.jpg|thumb|[[Christopher Columbus]] predicted a lunar eclipse.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}]]

==Lunar eclipse in culture==
Several cultures have [[myth]]s related to lunar eclipses or allude to the lunar eclipse as being a good or bad omen. The [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptians]] saw the eclipse as a sow swallowing the moon for a short time; other cultures view the eclipse as the Moon being swallowed by other animals, such as a [[jaguar]] in [[Mayan mythology|Mayan]] tradition, or a [[Chan Chu|three legged toad]] in [[Chinese mythology|China]]. Some societies thought it was a demon swallowing the Moon, and that they could chase it away by throwing stones and curses at it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Littmann |first=Mark|last2=Espenak|first2=Fred|last3=Willcox |first3=Ken|edition=3rd|date=2008 |title=Totality Eclipses of the Sun |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UOnH01tv078C|location=New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |chapter=Chapter 4: Eclipses in Mythology |isbn=978-0-19-953209-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks were ahead of their time when they said the Earth was round and used the shadow from the lunar eclipse as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollack|first1=Rebecca|title=Ancient Myths Revised with Lunar Eclipse|url=https://www.astro.umd.edu/openhouse/3about-the-obs/news/2003-11-10.html|publisher=University of Maryland|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Hindus believe in the importance of bathing in the Ganges River following an eclipse because it will help to achieve [[salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ani|title=Hindus take a dip in the Ganges during Lunar Eclipse|url=https://in.news.yahoo.com/hindus-dip-ganges-during-lunar-eclipse-105428179.html|website=Yahoo News|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incans===
Similarly to the Mayans, the Incans believed that lunar eclipses occurred when a jaguar would eat the Moon, which is why a blood moon looks red.  The Incans also believed that once the jaguar finished eating the Moon, it could come down and devour all the animals on Earth, so they would take spears and shout at the Moon to keep it away.&lt;ref name="National Geographic"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Jane|title=Lunar Eclipse Myths From Around the World|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/04/140413-total-lunar-eclipse-myths-space-culture-science/|website=National Geographic|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesopotamians===
The ancient Mesopotamians believed that a lunar eclipse was when the Moon was being attacked by seven demons.  This attack was more than just one on the Moon, however, for the Mesopotamians linked what happened in the sky with what happened on the land, and because the king of Mesopotamia represented the land, the seven demons were thought to be also attacking the king.  In order to prevent this attack on the king, the Mesopotamians made someone pretend to be the king so they would be attacked instead of the true king. After the lunar eclipse was over, the substitute king was made to disappear (possibly by poisoning).&lt;ref name="National Geographic"/&gt;

===Chinese===
In some Chinese cultures, people would ring bells to prevent a dragon or other wild animals from biting the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quilas|first1=Ma Evelyn|title=Interesting Facts and Myths about Lunar Eclipse|url=http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/548133/20140415/lunar-eclipse-facts-myths-superstition-nasa.htm#.VC2MJyldXmU|website=LA Times|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the nineteenth century, during a lunar eclipse, the Chinese navy fired its artillery because of this belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MYTHOLOGY OF THE LUNAR ECLIPSE|url=http://www.lifeasmyth.com/journal_planet_Eclipse.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Zhou Dynasty in the Book of Songs, the sight of a red Moon engulfed in darkness was believed to foreshadow famine or disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaul|first1=Gayatri|title=What Lunar Eclipse Means in Different Parts of the World|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-what-lunar-eclipse-means-in-different-parts-of-world-1555136|website=India.com|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blood moon==
{{see also|Blood Moon Prophecy}}

Certain lunar eclipses have been referred to as "blood moons" in popular articles but this is not a scientifically-recognized term.&lt;ref name="Sappenfield"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sappenfield|first=Mark|title=Blood Moon to arrive Monday night. What is a Blood Moon?|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2014/0413/Blood-Moon-to-arrive-Monday-night.-What-is-a-Blood-Moon|accessdate=8 February 2018|newspaper=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This term has been given two separate, but overlapping, meanings.

The first, and simpler, meaning relates to the reddish color a totally eclipsed Moon takes on to observers on Earth.&lt;ref name="Nigro"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nigro|first=Nicholas |title=Knack Night Sky: Decoding the Solar System, from Constellations to Black Holes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwim2lHciHAC&amp;pg=PA214|date=2010|publisher=[[Globe Pequot]]|isbn=978-0-7627-6604-8|pages=214–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[sunlight]] penetrates the [[atmosphere of Earth]], the gaseous layer [[Extinction (astronomy)#Atmospheric extinction|filters]] and [[atmospheric refraction|refracts]] the rays in such a way that the green to violet wavelengths on the [[visible spectrum]] [[light scattering|scatter]] more strongly than the red, thus giving the Moon a reddish cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All you need to know about the 'blood moon'|newspaper=theguardian|date=28 September 2015 &lt;!-- 09.07 BST --&gt; |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/sep/28/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-blood-moon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second meaning of "blood moon" has been derived from this apparent coloration by two [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christian]] pastors, Mark Blitz and [[John Hagee]].&lt;ref name="Sappenfield" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McClure"&gt;{{cite news|title=What is a Blood Moon?|url=http://earthsky.org/space/what-is-a-blood-moon-lunar-eclipses-2014-2015|accessdate=30 May 2014|newspaper=[[Earth &amp; Sky]]|date=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They claimed that the 2014–15 "[[tetrad (astronomy)|lunar tetrad]]" of four lunar eclipses coinciding with the feasts of [[Passover]] and [[Sukkot|Tabernacles]] matched the "moon turning to blood" described in the [[Book of Joel]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref name="McClure" /&gt; This tetrad was claimed to herald the [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Christ]] and the [[Rapture]] as described in the [[Book of Revelation]] on the date of the first of the eclipses in this sequence [[List_of_dates_predicted_for_apocalyptic_events|on April 15, 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bailey|first1=Sarah Pulliam|title=‘Blood moon’ sets off apocalyptic debate among some Christians|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/blood-moon-sets-off-apocalyptic-debate-among-some-christians/2014/04/15/00b76502-c4be-11e3-9ee7-02c1e10a03f0_story.html|accessdate=8 February 2018|work=Washington Post|agency=Religion News Service|date=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Saros (astronomy)|Eclipse cycle}}

At least two lunar eclipses and as many as five occur every year, although total lunar eclipses are significantly less common. If the date and time of an eclipse is known, the occurrences of upcoming eclipses are predictable using an [[eclipse cycle]], like the [[saros (astronomy)|saros]].

[[File:Massico.jpg|thumb|A mass flow meter of the coriolis type]]

A '''mass flow meter''', also known as an '''inertial flow meter''' is a device that measures [[mass flow rate]] of a [[fluid]] traveling through a tube. The mass flow rate is the [[mass]] of the fluid traveling past a fixed point per unit time.

The mass flow meter does not measure the volume per unit time (e.g., cubic meters per second) passing through the device; it measures the mass per unit time (e.g., kilograms per second) flowing through the device. [[Volumetric flow rate]] is the [[mass flow rate]] divided by the fluid [[density]]. If the density is constant, then the relationship is simple. If the fluid has varying density, then the relationship is not simple.  The density of the fluid may change with temperature, [[pressure]], or composition, for example.  The fluid may also be a combination of phases such as a fluid with entrained bubbles.
Actual density can be determined due to dependency of sound velocity on the controlled liquid concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/article/13900/massovyy_rashodomer_zhidkostey.htm|title=Mass flow meter for liquids.|author1=Naumchik I.V. |author2=Kinzhagulov I.Yu. |author3=Kren А.P. |author4=Stepanova К.А. |journal=Scientific and Technical Journal of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics|volume=15|issue=5|pages= 900–906.|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operating principle of a Coriolis flow meter==
There are two basic configurations of coriolis flow meter: the ''curved tube flow meter'' and the ''straight tube flow meter''. This article discusses the curved tube design.

{{multiple image | footer = &lt;center&gt;A rotating mass flow meter as illustration of the operating principle. &lt;/center&gt; 
| image1 = Coriolis meter rotating no-flow 256x256.gif
| width1 = 256
| caption1 = &lt;center&gt;Rotation without mass flow.&lt;/center&gt; &lt;center&gt;[[:Image:Coriolis meter rotating no-flow 512x512.gif|double sized version]]&lt;/center&gt;
| image2 = Coriolis meter rotating flow 256x256.gif
| width2 = 256
| caption2 = &lt;center&gt;With mass flow the tubes twist slightly.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;center&gt; [[:Image:Coriolis meter rotating flow 512x512.gif|double sized version]] &lt;/center&gt;
}}

The animations on the right do not represent an actually existing Coriolis flow meter design. The purpose of the animations is to illustrate the operating principle, and to show the connection with rotation.

Fluid is being pumped through the mass flow meter. When there is mass flow, the tube twists slightly. The arm through which fluid flows away from the axis of rotation must exert a force on the fluid, to increase its angular momentum, so it bends backwards. The arm through which fluid is pushed back to the axis of rotation must exert a force on the fluid to decrease the fluid's angular momentum again, hence that arm will bend forward. In other words, the inlet arm (containing an outwards directed flow), is lagging behind the overall rotation, the part which in rest is parallel to the axis is now skewed, and the outlet arm (containing an inwards directed flow) leads the overall rotation.

The animation on the right represents how curved tube mass flow meters are designed. The fluid is led through two parallel tubes. An actuator (not shown) induces equal counter vibrations on the sections parallel to the axis, to make the measuring device less sensitive to outside vibrations. The actual frequency of the vibration depends on the size of the mass flow meter, and ranges from 80 to 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz. The [[amplitude]] of the vibration is too small to be seen, but it can be felt by touch.

When no fluid is flowing, the motion of the two tubes is symmetrical, as shown in the left animation. The animation on the right illustrates what happens during mass flow: some twisting of the tubes. The arm carrying the flow away from the axis of rotation must exert a force on the fluid to accelerate the flowing mass to the vibrating speed of the tubes at the outside (increase of absolute angular momentum), so it is lagging behind the overall vibration. The arm through which fluid is pushed back towards the axis of movement must exert a force on the fluid to decrease the fluid's absolute angular speed (angular momentum) again, hence that arm leads the overall vibration.

The inlet arm and the outlet arm vibrate with the same frequency as the overall vibration, but when there is mass flow the two vibrations are out of sync: the inlet arm is behind, the outlet arm is ahead. The two vibrations are shifted in phase with respect to each other, and the degree of phase-shift is a measure for the amount of mass that is flowing through the tubes.

==Density and volume measurements==
The mass flow of a u-shaped coriolis flow meter is given as:
&lt;math&gt;Q_m=\frac{ K_u -I_u\omega^2  }{2Kd^2}\tau&lt;/math&gt;

where ''K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the temperature dependent stiffness of the tube, ''K'' a shape-dependent factor, ''d'' the width, ''&amp;tau;'' the time lag, ''&amp;omega;'' the vibration frequency and ''I&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'' the inertia of the tube. As the inertia of the tube depend on its contents, knowledge of the fluid density is needed for the calculation of an accurate mass flow rate.

If the density changes too often for manual calibration to be sufficient, the coriolis flow meter can be adapted to measure the density as well. The natural vibration frequency of the flow tubes depends on the combined mass of the tube and the fluid contained in it. By setting the tube in motion and measuring the natural frequency, the mass of the fluid contained in the tube can be deduced. Dividing the mass on the known volume of the tube gives us the ''density'' of the fluid.

An instantaneous density measurement allows the calculation of flow in volume per time by dividing mass flow with density.

==Calibration==
Both mass flow and density measurements depend on the vibration of the tube. 
Calibration is affected by changes in the rigidity of the flow tubes.

Changes in temperature and pressure will cause the tube rigidity to change, but these can be compensated for through pressure and temperature zero and span compensation factors.

Additional effects on tube rigidity will cause shifts in the calibration factor over time due to degradation of the flow tubes. These effects include pitting, cracking, coating, erosion or corrosion.
It is not possible to compensate for these changes dynamically, but efforts to monitor the effects may be made through regular meter calibration or verification checks.
If a change is deemed to have occurred, but is considered to be acceptable, the offset may be added to the existing calibration factor to ensure continued accurate measurement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2212">A '''microfibril''' is a very fine [[fibril]], or fiber-like strand, consisting of [[glycoproteins]] and [[cellulose]]. It is usually, but not always, used as a general term in describing the structure of protein fiber, e.g. [[hair]] and [[spermatozoon|sperm]] tail. Its most frequently observed structural pattern is the 9+2 pattern in which two central [[protofibril]]s are surrounded by nine other pairs. Cellulose inside plants is one of the examples of non-protein compounds that are using this term with the same purpose. Cellulose microfibrils are laid down in the inner surface of the primary cell wall.  As the cell absorbs water, its volume increases and the existing microfibrils separate and new ones are formed to help increase cell strength.

==Synthesis and function==
Cellulose is synthesized by [[cellulose synthase]] or Rosette terminal complexes which reside on a cells membrane. As cellulose fibrils are synthesized and grow extracellularly they push up against neighboring cells. Since the neighboring cell can not move easily the Rosette complex is instead pushed around the cell through the fluid phospholipid membrane.  Eventually this results in the cell becoming wrapped in a microfibril layer. This layer becomes the cell wall. The organization of microfibrils forming the primary cell wall is rather disorganized. However, another mechanism is used in secondary cell walls leading to its organization. Essentially, lanes on the secondary cell wall are built with microtubules. These lanes force microfibrils to remain in a certain area while they wrap. During this process microtubules can spontaneously depolymerize and repolymerize in a different orientation. This leads to a different direction in which the cell continues getting wrapped.

==Marfan syndrome==
In [[Marfan syndrome]], there is a defect in [[fibrillin]], the glycoprotein component of microfibrils.&lt;ref&gt;Ursus-Nikolaus Riede, Martin Werner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=idR7G_osdvQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=es#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Color atlas of pathology: pathologic principles, associated diseases, sequela]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicotinamide mononucleotide''' ("'''NMN'''" and "'''β-NMN'''") is a [[nucleotide]] derived from [[ribose]] and [[nicotinamide]].&lt;ref name=Bogan2008/&gt; Like [[nicotinamide riboside]], NMN is a derivative of [[niacin]], and humans have enzymes that can use NMN to generate [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] (NADH).&lt;ref name=Bogan2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bogan|first1=KL|last2=Brenner|first2=C|title=Nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, and nicotinamide riboside: a molecular evaluation of NAD+ precursor vitamins in human nutrition.|journal=Annual Review of Nutrition|date=2008|volume=28|pages=115–30|doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.28.061807.155443|pmid=18429699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''North Korea Cold Current''' (NKCC) is a cold water oceanic current in the [[Sea of Japan]] (East Sea of Korea) that flows southward from near [[Vladivostok]] along the coastline of the eastern [[Korean Peninsula]]. It is a branch of the [[Liman Current]] from the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] and has a flow rate of about a half knot. The NKCC meets the northward flowing [[East Korean Warm Current]] at latitude 37–38°&amp;nbsp;N, causing the flow to separate from the peninsula.&lt;ref name=brink_robinson2005/&gt; At about latitude 40°&amp;nbsp;N, the NKCC meets the [[Tsushima Warm Current]].&lt;ref name=osj44_1_43/&gt;

==Operations==

=== CHASE 1 ===
The [[Reserve fleet|mothballed]] C-3 [[Liberty ship]] ''[[John F. Shafroth]]'' was taken from the [[National Defense Reserve Fleet]] at [[Suisun Bay]] and towed to the [[Concord Naval Weapons Station]] for stripping and loading.  A major fraction of the munitions in CHASE 1 was [[Bofors 40 mm gun]] [[ammunition]] from the [[Naval Ammunition Depot]] at [[Hastings, Nebraska]].  CHASE 1 also included [[bomb]]s, [[torpedo]] [[warhead]]s, [[naval mine]]s, [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]], [[Shell (projectile)|projectiles]], [[Fuse (explosives)|fuzes]], [[detonator]]s, [[explosive booster|boosters]], overage [[UGM-27 Polaris]] motors, and a quantity of contaminated cake mix an army court had ordered dumped at sea.  ''Shafroth'' was sunk 47 miles (76 km) off San Francisco on 23 July 1964 with 9799 tons of munitions.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;

=== CHASE 2 ===
''Village'' was loaded with 7348 short tons of munitions at the [[Naval Weapons Station Earle]] and towed to a deep-water dump site on 17 September 1964. There were three large and unexpected detonations five minutes after ''Village'' slipped beneath the surface. An oil slick and some debris appeared on the surface.  The explosion registered on seismic equipment all over the world.  Inquiries were received regarding seismic activity off the east coast of the United States, and the [[Office of Naval Research]] and [[Advanced Research Projects Agency]] expressed interest in measuring the differences between seismic shocks and underwater explosive detonations to detect underwater nuclear detonations then banned by treaty.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;

=== CHASE 3 ===
''Coastal Mariner'' was loaded with 4040 [[Short ton|short tons]] of munitions at the [[Naval Weapons Station Earle]]. The munitions included 512 tons of actual explosives.  Four [[SOFAR bomb]]s were packed in the explosives cargo hold with booster charges of 500 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] (227 [[Kilogram|kg]]) of TNT to detonate the cargo at a depth of 1000 feet (300 m).  The United States Coast Guard issued a notice to mariners and the United States Department of Fish and Wildlife and the United States Bureau of Commercial Fisheries sent observers. The explosives detonated seventeen seconds after ''Coastal Mariner'' slipped below the surface on 14 July 1965. The detonation created a 600-[[Foot (unit)|foot]] (200 [[Metre|m]]) water spout, but was not deep enough to be recorded on seismic instruments.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;

=== CHASE 4 ===
''Santiago Iglesias'' was loaded with 8715 tons of munitions at the [[Naval Weapons Station Earle]], rigged for detonation at 1000 feet (300 m), and detonated 31 seconds after sinking on 16 September 1965.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;

=== CHASE 5 ===
''Isaac Van Zandt'' was loaded with 8000 tons of munitions (including 400 tons of high explosives) at the [[Naval Base Kitsap]] and rigged for detonation at 4000 feet (1.2 km). On 23 May 1966 the tow cable parted en route to the planned disposal area. Navy tugs [[USS Tatnuck (ATA-195)|USS ''Tatnuck'' (ATA-195)]] and [[USS Koka (ATA-185)|USS ''Koka'' (ATA-185)]] recovered the tow within six hours, but the location of sinking was changed by the delay.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;

=== CHASE 6 ===
''Horace Greeley'' was loaded at the [[Naval Weapons Station Earle]], rigged for detonation at 4000 feet (1.2 km), and detonated on 28 July 1966.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;

=== CHASE 7 ===
''Michael J. Monahan'' was loaded with overage [[UGM-27 Polaris]] motors at the [[Naval Weapons Station Charleston]] and sunk without detonation on 30 April 1967.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;

=== CHASE 8 ===
The first chemical weapons disposal via the program was in 1967 and designated CHASE 8. CHASE 8 disposed of [[mustard gas]] and [[Sarin|GB-filled]] [[M-55 rocket]]s.

=== CHASE 9 ===
''Eric C. Gibson'' was sunk on 15 June 1967.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;

=== CHASE 10 ===
CHASE 10 dumped 3000 tons of United States Army [[nerve agent]] filled rockets encased in concrete vaults.&lt;ref name=global/&gt;  Public controversy delayed CHASE 10 disposal until August 1970.  Public awareness of operation CHASE 10 was increased by mass media reporting following delivery of information from [[the Pentagon]] to the office of U.S. Representative [[Richard D. McCarthy|Richard McCarthy]] in 1969. Both American television and print media followed the story with heavy coverage. In 1970, 58 separate reports were aired on the three major network news programs on [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[CBS]] concerning Operation CHASE. Similarly, ''[[The New York Times]]'' included Operation CHASE coverage in 42 separate issues during 1970, 21 of those in the month of August.&lt;ref name=wagner/&gt;

=== CHASE 11 ===
CHASE 11 occurred in June 1968 and disposed of United States Army GB and [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]], all sealed in tin containers.

=== CHASE 12 ===
CHASE 12, in August 1968, again disposed of United States Army mustard agent and was numerically (although not chronologically) the final mission to dispose of chemical weapons.

==Aftermath==
Operation CHASE was exposed to the public during a time when the army was under increasing public criticism, especially the army's [[Chemical Corps]]. CHASE was one of the incidents which led to the near-disbanding of the [[Chemical Corps]] in the aftermath of the [[Vietnam War]]. Concerns were raised over the program's effect on the ocean environment as well as the risk of chemical weapons washing up on shore.&lt;ref name=mauroni/&gt; The concerns led to the [[Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972]], which prohibited such future missions.&lt;ref name=global&gt;[[John E. Pike|Pike, John]]. "[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/chase.htm Operation CHASE]", 27 April 2005,  ''Globalsecurity.org''. Retrieved 26 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Palynology''' is the "study of dust" (from {{lang-grc-gre|παλύνω|palunō}}, "strew, sprinkle"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpalu%2Fnw παλύνω], 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[-logy]]'') or "particles that are strewn". A classic palynologist analyses [[particulate]] samples collected from the air, from water, or from deposits including sediments of any age. The condition and identification of those particles, organic and inorganic, give the palynologist clues to the life, environment, and energetic conditions that produced them.

The term is sometimes narrowly used to refer to a subset of the discipline, which is defined as "the study of microscopic objects of macromolecular organic composition (i.e., compounds of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen), not capable of dissolution in hydrochloric or hydrofluoric acids".&lt;ref&gt;W.A.S.

Palynology does not include [[diatoms]], [[foraminiferans]] or other organisms with [[siliceous]] or [[calcareous]] [[exoskeletons]].

Palynology is an interdisciplinary science and is a branch of [[earth science]] ([[geology]] or geological science) and [[biological science]] ([[biology]]), particularly [[plant science]] ([[botany]]). [[stratigraphy|Stratigraphical]] palynology is a branch of [[micropaleontology|micropalaeontology]] and [[paleobotany]], which studies [[fossil]] palynomorphs from the [[Precambrian]] to the [[Holocene]].

===Early history===
The earliest reported observations of pollen under a microscope are likely to have been in the 1640s by the English [[botanist]] [[Nehemiah Grew]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Bradbury| first=S.| date=1967| title=The Evolution of the Microscope| publisher=Pergamon Press| place=New York| pages=375 p}}&lt;/ref&gt; who described pollen and the stamen, and concluded that pollen is required for sexual reproduction in flowering plants.

By the late 1870s, as optical microscopes improved and the principles of [[stratigraphy]] were worked out, [[Robert Kidston]] and [[P. Reinsch]] were able to examine the presence of fossil spores in the Devonian and Carboniferous coal seams and make comparisons between the living spores and the ancient fossil spores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Jansonius| first=J.| author2=D.C.

=== 1890s to 1940s===
Quantitative analysis of pollen began with [[Lennart von Post]]'s published work.&lt;ref&gt;Traverse, Alfred and Sullivan, Herbert J. "The Background, Origin, and Early History of the American Association of Stratigraphic Palynologists" Palynology 7: 7-18 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; Although he published in the Swedish language, his methodology gained a wide audience through his lectures. In particular, his [[Kristiania]] lecture of 1916 was important in gaining a wider audience.&lt;ref name="FIPol"&gt;{{cite book| last=Fægri| first=Knut| authorlink=Knut Fægri| author2=Johs.

Gunnar E. Erdtman| journal=Pollen et Spores| date=1973| volume=15| pages=5–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The isolation ended with the German publication of [[Gunnar Erdtman]]'s 1921 thesis. The methodology of pollen analysis became widespread throughout [[Europe]] and [[North America]] and revolutionized [[Quaternary]] vegetation and climate change research.&lt;ref name="FIPol" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;von Post, L (1918) "Skogsträdpollen i sydsvenska torvmosslagerföljder", Forhandlinger ved de Skandinaviske naturforskeres 16. møte i Kristiania 1916: p. 433&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier pollen researchers include Früh (1885),&lt;ref&gt;Früh, J (1885) "Kritische Beiträge zur Kenntnis des Torfes", Jahrb.k.k.Geol.Reichsanstalt 35&lt;/ref&gt; who enumerated many common tree pollen types, and a considerable number of [[spore]]s and [[herb]] pollen grains. There is a study of pollen samples taken from sediments of Swedish lakes by Trybom (1888);&lt;ref&gt;Trybom, F (1888) "Bottenprof fran svenska insjöar", Geol.Foren.Forhandl.10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pinus|pine]] and [[Picea|spruce]] pollen was found in such profusion that he considered them to be serviceable as "[[index fossils]]". [[Georg F. L. Sarauw]] studied fossil pollen of middle Pleistocene age ([[Cromerian]]) from the harbour of [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sarauw | first=G. F. L. | date= 1897 | title = Cromer-skovlaget i Frihavnen og trælevningerne i de ravførende sandlag ved København | language = Danish |trans-title= The Cromer Forest layer in the Free Harbour and Wood Remains in the Amber containing strata near Copenhagen | journal = Meddelelser fra Dansk Geologisk Forening / Bulletin of the Geological Society of Denmark | volume=1 | issue=4 | pages= 17–44 | url = http://2dgf.dk/xpdf/bull-1897-1-4-17-44.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lagerheim (in Witte 1905) and C.&amp;nbsp;A.Weber (in H.&amp;nbsp;A. Weber 1918) appear to be among the first to undertake 'percentage frequency' calculations.

=== 1940s to 1989===

The term ''palynology'' was introduced by Hyde and Williams in 1944, following correspondence with the Swedish [[geologist]] [[Ernst Antevs]], in the pages of the ''[[Pollen Analysis Circular]]'' (one of the first journals devoted to pollen analysis, produced by [[Paul Sears]] in North America). Hyde and Williams chose ''palynology'' on the basis of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words ''paluno'' meaning 'to sprinkle' and ''pale'' meaning 'dust' (and thus similar to the [[Latin]] word ''pollen'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Hyde| first=H.A.| author2=D.A. Williams| url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/palynology/riteword.html| title=The Right Word| journal=Pollen Analysis Circular| volume=8| pages=6| date=1944| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618031355/http://www.geo.arizona.edu/palynology/riteword.html| archivedate=2007-06-18| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollen analysis in North America stemmed from [[Phyllis Draper]], an MS student under Sears at the University of Oklahoma. During her time as a student, she developed the first pollen diagram from a sample that depicted the percentage of several species at different depths at Curtis Bog. This was the introduction of pollen analysis in North America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Draper|first=Phyllis|date=|title=A DEMONSTRATION OF THE TECHNIQUE OF POLLEN ANALYSIS|url=http://ojs.library.okstate.edu/osu/index.php/OAS/article/viewFile/2553/2251|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;; pollen diagrams today still often remain in the same format with depth on the y-axis and abundances of species on the x-axis.

=== 1990s to the 21st century ===
Pollen analysis advanced rapidly in this period due to advances in optics and computers. Much of the science was revised by [[Johannes Iversen]] and [[Knut Fægri]] in their textbook on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Fægri, K. &amp; Iversen, J. (1989) ''Textbook of pollen analysis''. 4th ed. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Chichester. 328 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods of studying palynomorphs ==

===Palynomorphs===
Palynomorphs are broadly defined as organic-walled [[microfossil]]s between 5 and 500 [[micrometre]]s in size.  They are extracted from [[sedimentary rock]]s and [[pollen core|sediment cores]] both physically, by ultrasonic treatment and [[sieve analysis|wet sieving]], and chemically, by chemical digestion to remove the non-organic fraction. Palynomorphs may be composed of organic material such as [[chitin]], [[pseudochitin]] and [[sporopollenin]]. Palynomorphs that have a taxonomy description are sometimes referred to as palynotaxa.

Palynomorphs form a [[geological]] record of importance in determining the type of [[prehistoric life]] that existed at the time the sedimentary formation was laid down. As a result, these microfossils give important clues to the prevailing [[paleogeography|climatic conditions]] of the time. Their paleontological utility derives from an abundance numbering in millions of [[Cell (biology)|cells]] per gram in organic marine deposits, even when such deposits are generally not [[fossiliferous]]. Palynomorphs, however, generally have been destroyed in [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] or recrystallized rocks.

Typically, palynomorphs are [[dinoflagellate cysts]], [[acritarch]]s, [[spore]]s, [[pollen]], [[fungi]], [[scolecodonts]] (scleroprotein teeth, jaws and associated features of [[polychaeta|polychaete]] [[annelid]] worms), [[arthropod]] organs (such as [[insect]] mouthparts), [[chitinozoa]]ns and [[foram|microforam]]s. Palynomorph microscopic structures that are abundant in most sediments are resistant to routine pollen extraction including strong acids and bases, and acetolysis, or density separation.&lt;!--Check this sentence, before I copy/edit-ted it. It had GROSS errors.--&gt;

==Palynofacies==
A '''palynofacies''' is the complete assemblage of [[organic matter]] and [[#Palynomorphs|palynomorph]]s in a fossil deposit. The study of the palynofacies of a  [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional environment]] of sediments can be used to learn about the depositional palaeoenvironments of [[sedimentary|sedimentary rocks]]. The term ''palynofacies'' was introduced by the French [[geologist]] [[André Combaz]] in 1964. Palynofacies studies are often linked to investigations of the palynology and organic [[geochemistry]] of [[sedimentary rock]]s.

Palynofacies can be used in two ways:
* [[Organic matter|Organic]] palynofacies considers all the acid insoluble [[particulate organic matter]] (POM), including [[kerogen]] and [[#Palynomorphs|palynomorph]]s in sediments and palynological preparations of sedimentary rocks. The sieved or unsieved preparations may be examined using [[strew mount]]s on microscope slides that may be examined using a transmitted light biological microscope or [[ultraviolet]] (UV) fluorescence microscope. The abundance, composition and preservation of the various components, together with the thermal alteration of the organic matter is considered.
* Palynomorph palynofacies considers the abundance, composition and diversity of palynomorphs in a sieved palynological preparation of sediments or palynological preparation of [[sedimentary rock]]s. The ratio of [[ocean|marine]] [[fossil]] [[phytoplankton]] ([[acritarchs]] and [[dinoflagellate]] cysts), together with [[chitinozoa]]ns, to terrestrial palynomorphs ([[pollen]] and [[spores]]) can be used to derive a terrestrial input index in marine sediments.

Both types of palynofacies studies are used for [[geology|geological interpretation]] of [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] basins in exploration geology, often in conjunction with palynological analysis and [[vitrinite]] reflectance.

===Chemical preparation===
Chemical digestion follows a number of steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially the only chemical treatment used by researchers was treatment with [[Potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) to remove [[Humic acid|humic]] substances; defloculation was accomplished through surface treatment or ultra-sonic treatment, although sonification may cause the pollen exine to rupture.&lt;ref name="InMem" /&gt; The use of [[hydrofluoric acid]] (HF) to digest [[silicate]] [[mineral]]s was introduced by Assarson and Granlund in 1924, greatly reducing the amount of time required to scan slides for palynomorphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; Palynological studies using peats presented a particular challenge because of the presence of well-preserved organic material, including fine rootlets, moss leaflets and organic litter. This was the last major challenge in the chemical preparation of materials for palynological study. [[Acetolysis]] was developed by Gunnar Erdtman and his brother to remove these fine cellulose materials by dissolving them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| last=Erdtman
| first= O.G.E.
| title=Uber die Verwendung von Essigsaureanhydrid bei Pollenuntersuchungen
| journal= Sven. Bot. Tidskr.
| volume=28
| pages=354–358}}&lt;/ref&gt; In acetolysis the specimen is treated with [[acetic anhydride]] and [[sulfuric acid]], dissolving [[cellulose|cellulistic]] materials and thus providing better visibility for palynomorphs.

Some steps of the chemical treatments require special care for safety reasons, in particular the use of HF which diffuses very fast through the skin and, causes severe chemical burns, and can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2011-12-18}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Another treatment includes kerosene flotation for [[chitin]]ous materials.

===Analysis===
Once samples have been prepared chemically, they are mounted on [[microscope]] slides using silicon oil, glycerol or glycerol-jelly and examined using light [[microscopy]] or mounted on a stub for [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]].

Researchers will often study either modern samples from a number of unique sites within a given area, or samples from a single site with a record through time, such as samples obtained from [[peat]] or lake sediments. More recent studies have used the modern analog technique in which paleo-samples are compared to modern samples for which the parent vegetation is known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Palynology can be applied to problems in many fields including [[geology]], [[botany]], [[paleontology]], [[archaeology]], [[pedology (soil study)]], and [[physical geography]].

== Applications ==
Palynology is used for a diverse range of applications, related to many scientific disciplines:

* [[Biostratigraphy]] and [[geochronology]]. Geologists use palynological studies in biostratigraphy to correlate [[stratum|strata]] and determine the relative age of a given bed, horizon, formation or [[stratigraphy|stratigraphical]] sequence.
* [[paleoecology|Palaeoecology]] and [[climate change]]. Palynology can be used to reconstruct past [[vegetation]] (land plants) and [[ocean|marine]] and [[Freshwater phytoplankton]] communities, and so infer past [[natural environment|environmental]] ([[paleoenvironment|palaeoenvironment]]al) and [[paleoclimatology|palaeoclimatic]] conditions.
* [[organic compound|Organic]] [[palynofacies]] studies, which examine the preservation of the particulate organic matter and [[#Palynomorphs|palynomorph]]s provides information on the depositional environment of sediments and depositional palaeoenvironments of [[sedimentary|sedimentary rocks]].
* [[Geothermal]] alteration studies examine the [[color|colour]] of palynomorphs extracted from rocks to give the thermal alteration and [[hydrocarbon|maturation]] of [[sedimentary]] sequences, which provides estimates of maximum [[paleotemperatures|palaeotemperatures]].
* [[Limnology]] studies. Freshwater palynomorphs and animal and plant fragments, including the [[prasinophyte]]s and [[desmid]]s ([[green alga]]e) can be used to study past lake levels and long term [[climate change]].
* [[scientific classification|Taxonomy]] and [[evolution|evolutionary studies]]. Involving the use of pollen morphological characters as source of taxonomic data to delimit plant species under same family or genus. Pollen apertural status is frequently used for differential sorting or finding similarities between species of the same taxa. This is also called Palynotaxonomy.
* [[Forensic palynology]]: the study of [[pollen]] and other palynomorphs for evidence at a crime scene.
* [[Allergy]] studies. Studies of the geographic distribution and seasonal production of pollen, can help sufferers of allergies such as [[hay fever]].
* [[Melissopalynology]]: the study of pollen and spores found in honey.
* [[Archaeological]] palynology examines human uses of plants in the past. This can help determine seasonality of site occupation, presence or absence of agricultural practices or products, and 'plant-related activity areas' within an archaeological context.  [[Bonfire Shelter]] is one such example of this application.

Because the distribution of [[acritarchs]], [[chitinozoa]]ns, [[dinoflagellate cysts]], [[pollen]] and [[spore]]s provides evidence of [[stratigraphy|stratigraphical correlation]] through [[biostratigraphy]] and [[palaeoenvironment]]al reconstruction, one common and lucrative application of palynology is in [[petroleum|oil]] and [[Natural gas|gas]] exploration.

Palynology also allows scientists to infer the climatic conditions from the vegetation present in an area [[geologic timescale|thousands or millions of years]] ago. This is a fundamental part of research into [[climate change]].

In [[Greek Mythology]], '''Sinope''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Σινώπη&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*sinw%2Fph Σινώπη], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) was one of the daughters of [[Asopus]] and thought to be an eponym of the city [[Sinop (Turkey)|Sinope]] on the [[Black Sea]].

== Mythology ==
According to [[Corinna]]&lt;ref&gt;Frag. 654&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Diodorus Siculus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Library'', [http://www.theoi.com/Text/DiodorusSiculus4D.html 4.72.2], on Theoi&lt;/ref&gt; Sinope was carried away by the god [[Apollo]] to the place where later stood the city honouring her name. Diodorus adds that she bore to Apollo a son named [[Syrus]], supposedly afterwards king of the [[Syria]]ns, who were named after him.

However, the [[Argonautica]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0227%3Abook%3D2%3Acard%3D948 2.946-951], on Perseus (Greek text)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]], ''Argonautica'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0058%3Abook%3D5%3Acard%3D63 5.109], on Perseus (Latin text)&lt;/ref&gt; relate that Sinope was abducted to the site by [[Zeus]], who, in his passion, swore to fulfil her dearest wish.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. also Dionysius Periegeta 775-779 (eponym)&lt;/ref&gt; Sinope declared she wished to remain a virgin. Sinope later tricked Apollo and the river [[Halys River|Halys]] in the same fashion and remained a virgin all her life.

'''Sociological naturalism''' is a theory that states that the [[Nature|natural world]] and [[society|social world]] are roughly identical and governed by similar principles. Sociological naturalism, in sociological texts simply referred to as '''naturalism''', can be traced back to the philosophical thinking of [[Auguste Comte]] in the 19th century, closely connected to [[positivism]], which advocates use of the [[scientific method]] of the [[natural science]]s in studying [[social science]]s. It should not be identified too closely with Positivism, however, since whilst the latter advocates the use of controlled situations like experiments as sources of scientific information, naturalism insists that social processes should only be studied in their ''natural'' setting.  A similar form of naturalism was applied to the scientific study of art and literature by [[Hippolyte Taine]] (see [[Race, milieu, and moment]]).

Contemporary sociologists do not generally dispute that social phenomena take place within the natural universe and, as such, are subject to natural constraints, such as the laws of physics.  Up for debate is the nature of the distinctiveness of social phenomena as a subset of natural phenomena. Broad support exists for the antipositivist claim that crucial qualitative differences mean that one cannot explain social phenomena effectively using investigative tools or even standards of validity derived from other natural sciences. From this point of view, naturalism does not imply [[scientism]].  

However, a classically positivist conflation of naturalism with scientism has not disappeared; this view is still dominant in some old and prestigious schools, such as the sociology departments at the University of Chicago in the United States, and McGill University in Montréal, Canada.

More recently, [[actor-network theory]] has analyzed the social construction of the nature/society distinction itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3772">[[File:Geysir01.jpg|thumb|Summer near [[Geysir]], [[Iceland]].]]
In [[Norse mythology]], '''Sumarr''' ([[Old Norse]] "Summer"&lt;ref name=ORCHARD154&gt;Orchard (1997:154).&lt;/ref&gt;) and '''Vetr''' (Old Norse "Winter"&lt;ref name=ORCHARD174&gt;Orchard (1997:174).&lt;/ref&gt;) are personified [[season]]s. Sumarr and Vetr, personified, are attested in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]. In both, the two are given genealogies, while in the ''Prose Edda'' the two figure into a number of [[kenning]]s used by various [[skald]]s.

==Attestations==
[[File:Vinter.jpg|thumb|Winter in [[Blefjell, Norway]].]]
===''Poetic Edda''===
In the stanza 26 of the  ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Vafþrúðnismál]]'', the god [[Odin]] (disguised as "[[List of names of Odin|Gagnráðr]]") asks the [[jötunn]] [[Vafþrúðnir]]  from where warm Sumarr and Vetr come from, stating that they arrived "first among the Wise powers".&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON44&gt;Larrington (1996:44).&lt;/ref&gt; In stanza 27, Vafþrúðnir responds:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Wind-cool [Vindsvalr] he is called, Winter's [Vetr's] father,
:and Mild-One [Svásuðr], the father of Summer [Sumarr].&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON44/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The second half of this stanza is missing from early manuscripts, but some later manuscripts feature the addition of:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:And both of these shall ever be
:Till the gods to destruction go.&lt;ref name=BELLOWS75&gt;Bellows (1936:75).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Prose Edda''===
In chapter 19 of the ''Prose Edda'' book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', [[Gylfi|Gangleri]] (king [[Gylfi]] in disguise) asks why there's an evident difference between summer and winter. The enthroned figure of High responds, and (after scolding him for asking a question everyone knows the answer to) states that the father of Sumarr is Svásuðr, who is quite pleasant, while the father of Vetr is referred to as Vindsvalr or, alternately, Vindljóni, and that Vetr derives his countenance from his ancestors, as they are "cruel and cold-hearted kinsmen".&lt;ref name=BYOCK30&gt;Byock (2005:30).&lt;/ref&gt;

Sumarr and Vetr are additionally personified in the ''Prose Edda'' book ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'', where they are referred to in [[kenning]]s. Kennings for Sumarr are given in chapter 30, including "son of Svásuðr", "comfort of the snakes", "growth of men", exemplified in an excerpt given from a work by the [[skald]] [[Egill Skallagrímsson]] where "Valley-fish's mercy" points to "Snake's mercy", which signifies "Summer".&lt;ref name=FAULKES94&gt;Faulkes (1995:94).&lt;/ref&gt; Kennings are given for Vetr in chapter 26; "Son of Vindsvalr", "snake's death", and "storm season". Excerpts of works by the skalds [[Ormr Steinþórsson]] (who uses the kenning "Vindsvalr's son") and Ásgrímr (who employs the kenning "snake woe") are then given as examples.&lt;ref name=FAULKES93&gt;Faulkes (1995:93).&lt;/ref&gt; Both Sumarr and Vetr are given as terms for "times" in chapter 63.&lt;ref name=FAULKES144&gt;Faulkes (1995:144).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5400">The '''SunShot Initiative''' is a federal government program run by the US Department of Energy's Solar Energy Technologies Office. It bills itself as a national effort to support solar energy adoption in order to make solar energy affordable for all Americans. The initiative is a collaboration of private companies, universities, state and local governments, and nonprofits, as well as national laboratories.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://energy.gov/eere/sunshot/sunshot-initiative-goals|title=SunShot Initiative Goals {{!}} Department of Energy|last=|first=|date=|website=energy.gov|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program began in 2011 with the initial goal of making solar energy competitive with traditional forms of electricity by 2020. The federal government invested $282 million in FY 2015 to fund the SunShot Initiative.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;FY 2015 Congressional Budget Request, U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the SunShot Q4 2016/Q1 2017 Solar Industry Update report, The United States installed 14.8 GW of [[Photovoltaics|PV]] in 2016, an increase of 97% from 2015, representing approximately $30 billion in deployed capital, along with another $2.2 billion in U.S.- manufactured PV products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://energy.gov/eere/sunshot/q4-2016q1-2017-presentation-solar-industry-update|title=Q4 2016/Q1 2017 Presentation - Solar Industry Update {{!}} Department of Energy|website=energy.gov|access-date=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2016, the program achieved 90% of the progress towards the 2020 goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://energy.gov/eere/sunshot/sunshot-initiative-goals|title=SunShot Initiative Goals {{!}} Department of Energy|website=energy.gov|access-date=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, it was announced that it had already reached its 2020 goal, and was now refocusing on grid reliability issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/09/solar-now-costs-6-per-kilowatt-hour-beating-government-goal-by-3-years/ |website=Arstechnica |first=Megan |last=Geuss |date=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals and mission==
When the program was first launched in 2011 it set a series of goals and cost targets:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* $0.09 per kilowatt hour for residential [[photovoltaics]] (PV)
* $0.07 per kilowatt hour for commercial PV
* $0.06 per kilowatt hour for utility-scale PV
In 2016, the SunShot Initiative announced new cost targets that it wanted to be achieved by the year 2030:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* $0.05 per kilowatt hour for residential PV
* $0.04 per kilowatt hour for commercial PV
* $0.03 per kilowatt hour for utility-scale PV
According to the program, "These cost targets inform the decisions SunShot makes to spur the [[Solar power in the United States|country’s solar market]] and drive deployment of solar energy."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Organization ==
The SunShot Initiative is divided into five subprograms:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Photovoltaics''' - supports the early-stage research and development of photovoltaic (PV) technologies that improve efficiency and reliability, lower manufacturing costs, and drive down the cost of solar electricity.
* '''Concentrating Solar Power''' - supports the development of novel CSP technologies that will lower cost, increase efficiency, and improve reliability compared to current state-of-the-art technologies.
* '''Systems Integration''' - seeks to enable the widespread deployment of secure, reliable, and cost effective solar energy on the nation’s electricity grid by addressing the associated technical and organizational challenges. 
* '''Soft Costs''' - addresses challenges associated with non-hardware costs of solar and remove market barriers to the adoption of solar energy technologies.
* '''Technology to Market''' - this subprogram investigates and validates groundbreaking, early-stage technology, software, and business models to strengthen early-stage concepts and move them toward readiness for greater private sector investment and scale-up to commercialization.
All subprograms issue competitive awards to universities, national laboratories, nonprofit organizations, solar companies, and state and local governments to fund research and development projects that will aid in lowering the cost of electricity generated from solar technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://energy.gov/eere/sunshot/about-sunshot-initiative|title=About the SunShot Initiative {{!}} Department of Energy|website=energy.gov|access-date=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below is a spending breakdown of the Soft Costs program for fiscal year 2015:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* $5.8 Million – Solar research at [[National Laboratories]]
* $17.4 Million – Funding pilot programs for solar incentives/subsidies
* $8 Million – Education training
* $6 Million – Study solar panel deployment on federal lands
* $5 Million – Studies on streamlining solar data to “increase access to financing”
* $2 Million – Using students to develop plans for local government policies that help solar

'''Tom Denniss''' (born 24 February 1961&lt;sup&gt;[[Tom Denniss#cite note-AOYA-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;) is an Australian athlete, inventor, scientist, and entrepreneur. A Doctor of Mathematics and Oceanography, he invented a technology to convert energy in ocean waves into electricity,&lt;sup&gt;[[Tom Denniss#cite note-NewInventors-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt; founded a company to commercialise that technology (originally named Energetech Australia Pty Ltd in 1997, later changed to [[Oceanlinx]] Ltd in 2007), played [[Warilla-Lake South Gorillas|professional rugby league]], was a finalist in the [[Australian of the Year Award]],&lt;sup&gt;[[Tom Denniss#cite note-AOYA-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and in 2013 set a new world record for the Fastest Circumnavigation of the Earth on Foot.&lt;sup&gt;[[Tom Denniss#cite note-3|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt; In October 2016, Denniss co-founded Wave Swell Energy with a technology expected to make wave energy commercially viable for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-13/sydney-runner-becomes-fastest-man-to-circle-globe-on-foot/4956662 ABC News 2013 Sydney Runner Becomes Fastest Man to Circle Globe on Foot, 13 September 2013 ABC TV]; retrieved 11 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Denniss was born in 1961 in [[Wollongong, NSW|Wollongong]], 80&amp;nbsp;km south of Sydney, Australia. He attended Warilla North Primary School from 1966 to 1973,&lt;ref name="ESPN Aussies Abroad, 2014"&gt;ESPN Aussies Abroad, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--this was a banned link--&gt; and [[Lake Illawarra High School]] from 1974 to 1979, and was Student Council President at high school in 1979.&lt;ref name=LIHS&gt;[http://www.lakeillawa-h.schools.nsw.edu.au/hall-of-fame/dr-tom-dennis Lake Illawarra High School hall of fame, 2009; NSW Department of Education and Communities]; retrieved 10 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1980 to 1982 Denniss completed a degree in Mathematics at the [[University of Wollongong]],&lt;ref name=UOWAlumni&gt;Alumni News – University of Wollongong, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and a Diploma in Education from the [[University of New South Wales]] in 1983.

A professional musician in his early life, Denniss has played to international audiences in eight different countries.&lt;ref name=NextStep&gt;[http://www.tomsnextstep.com/who%E2%80%99s-this-%E2%80%98tom%E2%80%99-guy/ "Who's This Tom Guy"; ''Tom's Next Step'' blog]; retrieved 17 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Initially a high school maths teacher, Denniss taught at [[Newtown High School of the Performing Arts|Newtown High School]] in Sydney from 1984 to 1990. While working at Newtown High, he attended UNSW part-time during 1988/89, obtaining a First Class Honours degree in Science.&lt;sup&gt;[[Tom Denniss#cite note-LIHS-5|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt; In 1990 Denniss left teaching to pursue a PhD in Mathematics and Oceanography at the same university. While completing his doctorate, from 1990 to 1994, he was an Associate Lecturer in the School of Mathematics at UNSW.&lt;sup&gt;[[Tom Denniss#cite note-AOYA-1|[1]]][[Tom Denniss#cite note-UNSW-8|[8]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

From 1994 to 1999, Denniss worked at [[Macquarie Bank]], a leading Australian investment bank.&lt;sup&gt;[[Tom Denniss#cite note-9|[9]]]&lt;/sup&gt; During this period he founded Energetech Australia and, during his spare time, began commercialising the wave energy technology he had earlier invented. In 1999 Denniss became full-time CEO of Energetech Australia.

In late 2004, Denniss stood aside as the CEO of Energetech, but continued in the role of Chief Technology Officer of the company. In 2005 he was invited by [[Jeffrey Sachs]], Special Adviser to the UN Secretary General, to be a member of the [[Global Roundtable on Climate Change]], serving on this forum until 2009.&lt;sup&gt;[[Tom Denniss#cite note-LIHS-5|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt; In 2006 the [[wave energy]] technology Denniss invented was named by the US based International Academy of Science as one of Ten Most Outstanding Technologies in the World.&lt;sup&gt;[[Tom Denniss#cite note-MayneReport-10|[10]]][[Tom Denniss#cite note-Austrade-11|[11]]]&lt;/sup&gt; At a ceremony in [[Hawaii]] in 2007, Denniss was the first person to be inducted into the International Ocean Energy Hall of Fame as an [[ocean energy]] pioneer.&lt;sup&gt;[[Tom Denniss#cite note-AOYA-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; In [[Shenzhen, China]], in 2009, his innovative technology was ranked third by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) in its annual list of the Top Ten Renewable Energy Investment Opportunities in the World.&lt;sup&gt;[[Tom Denniss#cite note-Austrade-11|[11]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Denniss served as the Australian Government's representative on the International Energy Agency's Ocean Energy Systems Committee from 2007 to 2011&lt;sup&gt;[[Tom Denniss#cite note-12|[12]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and on the Australian Government's Advisory Board for the Clean Energy Innovation Centre in 2010/11.&lt;sup&gt;[[Tom Denniss#cite note-13|[13]]]&lt;/sup&gt; In October 2016, Denniss co-founded Wave Swell Energy with a technology widely predicted to make wave energy commercially viable for the first time.

==World run==

On 31 December 2011, Denniss began a quest to run around the world. He set a new world record and while doing so raised money for [[Oxfam]]. Dennis completed the 26,232&amp;nbsp;km journey on 13 September 2013, becoming just the second person to successfully complete a fully documented world run according to the rules defined by the sport's international governing body, the World Runners Association,&lt;ref name= WorldRunners/&gt; in the process setting a new world record of 622 days for the Fastest Circumnavigation of the Earth on Foot.&lt;ref name="AOYA"&gt;[http://www.australianoftheyear.org.au/honour-roll/?view=fullView&amp;recipientID=1145 Australian of the Year Awards; Australian of the Year Honour Roll, 2014]; retrieved 12 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= WorldRunners&gt;[http://worldrunnersassociation.org/records/ World Records; World Runners Association, 2014] retrieved 13 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; His accomplishment was the equivalent of running 622 marathons in 622 days in extremes of heat and cold.

==Sporting achievements==

Denniss was a member of the Warilla North Primary School 4 x 100-metre relay team which won three consecutive New South Wales state titles from 1971 to 1973, setting state records in 1971 (Junior Boys 57.4 sec) and 1973 (Senior Boys 52.7 sec).&lt;sup&gt;[[Tom Denniss#cite note-ESPN Aussies Abroad, 2014-4|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt; He was also a member of the Lake Illawarra High 15 years 4 x 100-metre relay team in 1976 which won the New South Wales Combined High Schools state title in record time (45.4 sec).

As a 17-year-old in 1978, Denniss was selected as a reserve in the NSW Combined High Schools Rugby League team. The same year he was chosen to play first grade for the [[Warilla-Lake South Gorillas]] rugby league team in the NSW South Coast Rugby League competition.&lt;sup&gt;[[Tom Denniss#cite note-LIHS-5|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt; He was a regular First Grader until his retirement from the game in late 1982, the same year he was selected to play in the NSW Country Team in the NSWRL's annual City versus Country match.&lt;sup&gt;[[Tom Denniss#cite note-LIHS-5|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Denniss was also the leading try scorer in the South Coast competition in 1980 and 1981 for the "Warilla Gorillas".

Denniss has also run 100 metres in 10.90 seconds (24 July 1978) and 100&amp;nbsp;km in 9 hours 26 mins 12 secs (2 May 2008).&lt;sup&gt;[[Tom Denniss#cite note-NextStep-7|[7]]]&lt;/sup&gt; It has been postulated he is the only person ever to have run both 100 metres in less than 11 seconds and 100&amp;nbsp;km in less than 11 hours.&lt;sup&gt;[[Tom Denniss#cite note-LIHS-5|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Denniss also won the 2015 Icarus Ultrafest 12 hour race in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and placed 3rd overall in the 250&amp;nbsp;km six day Great Red Race in Australia’s Simpson Desert in June 2017.

[[File:Runoff of soil &amp; fertilizer.jpg|thumb|[[Surface runoff]], a type of [[nonpoint source pollution]], from a farm field in [[Iowa]] during a rain storm.&lt;br /&gt; Topsoil as well as farm [[fertilizer]]s and other potential [[water pollution|pollutants]] run off unprotected farm fields when heavy rains occur.]]

'''Topsoil''' is the upper, outermost layer of [[soil]], usually the top {{convert|2|in|cm}} to {{convert|8|in|cm}}. It has the highest concentration of [[organic matter]] and [[microorganism]]s and is where most of the [[Earth]]'s [[biology|biological]] soil activity occurs. Topsoil is composed of mineral particles, organic matter, water, and air. Organic matter varies in quantity on different soils. The strength of soil structure decreases with the presence of organic matter, creating weak bearing capacities. Organic matter condenses and settles in different ways under certain conditions, such as roadbeds and foundations. The structure becomes affected once the soil is dewatered. The soil's volume substantially decreases. It decomposes and suffers wind erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marsh|first1=William M.|title=Landscape planning : environmental applications|date=2010|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=9780470570814|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
[[Plant]]s generally concentrate their [[root]]s in and obtain most of their vital [[nutrient]]s from this layer. Actual depth of the topsoil layer can be measured as the depth from the surface to the first densely packed soil layer known as [[subsoil]].

==Classification==
In soil classification systems, topsoil is known as the [[Soil horizon#A horizon|"O Horizon or A Horizon,"]] therefore, it is the very top layer.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Soil Survey Division Staff (1993). [http://soils.usda.gov/technical/manual/ "Soil Survey Manual."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207044212/http://soils.usda.gov/technical/manual/ |date=2007-02-07 }} USDA Handbook 18. Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercially available topsoil (manufactured or naturally occurring) in the United Kingdom should be classified to British Standard BS 3882 with the current version dated 2015. The standard has several classifications of topsoil with the final classification requiring material to meet certain threshold criteria such as Nutrient Content, Extractable Phytotoxic Elements, Particle Size Distribution, Organic Matter Content, Carbon:Nitrogen ratio, Electrical Conductivity, Loss on Ignition, pH, Chemical and Physical Contamination. The topsoil should be sampled in accordance with the British Standard and European Norm BS EN 12579:2013 Soil improvers and growing media - Sampling.&lt;ref&gt;BS 3882:2015 Specification for Topsoil&lt;/ref&gt; During construction of garden areas for housing plots the topsoil should be underlain by a layer of suitably certified subsoil that conforms to the British Standard BS 8601:2013 Specification for subsoil and requirements for use.&lt;ref&gt;BS 8601:2013 Specification for subsoil and requirements for use.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is always recommended that for construction projects that topsoil is placed in accordance with the DEFRA report Construction Code of Practice for the Sustainable Use of Soils on Construction Sites &lt;ref&gt;DEFRA Construction Code of Practice for the Sustainable Use of Soils on Construction Sites https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/69308/pb13298-code-of-practice-090910.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation==
When starting a gardening project, it is crucial to check whether or not the soil is satisfactory. Different types of plants vary in their nutrient needs and preferred soil conditions, many are strongly adapted to particular conditions. However, some general guidelines for "desired levels of Topsoil nutrients" have been made, broadly suitable for many plants.&lt;ref name="ncagr.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncagr.gov/agronomi/pdffiles/sfn14.pdf|title=Topsoil . North Carolina Department of Agriculture(July, 1995)|author=|date=|website=ncagr.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is for a multipurpose grade and certain levels can alter with regard to soil pH. Other uses specified in the standard that allows for a variety of uses in different and specific scenarios includes:

Acidic, Calcareous, Low Fertility, Low Fertility Acidic and Low Fertility Calcareous. These uses are limited to specific site scenarios and acceptance should be on a case by case basis for construction projects.

==Carbon to nitrogen ratio==

Topsoil is the primary resource for plants to grow and crops to thrive and the main two parameters for this are Carbon and Nitrogen. The Carbon provides energy and Nitrogen is a tissue builder and plants require them in a range of ratios to enable suitable growth. An optimum figure for Topsoil in the UK is a ratio of less than 20:1. This ensures that the soil has a suitable energy reserve as well as tissue building material to enable the plants to thrive. A sawdust typically has a carbonaceous base and this a high C:N ratio (in the order of c. 400:1) while an Alfalfa Hay has a low carbonaceous content and can typically have a C:N ratio in the order of 12:1.&lt;ref&gt;Understanding the Carbon Nitrogen Ratio by Crow Miller ACRES http://sccd.org/carbon-nitrogen_ratio.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial application==
A variety of soil mixtures are sold [[commerce|commercially]] as topsoil, usually for use in improving [[garden]]s and [[lawn]]s, e.g. [[container garden]]s, [[potting soil]] and [[peat]]. Another important yet not commonly known use for topsoil is for proper surface grading near residential buildings such as homes. "The ground around the home should slope down six inches for the first ten feet away from the home. This can often be done by adding topsoil (not sand or gravel)."{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Erosion==
A major environmental concern known as topsoil [[erosion]] occurs when the topsoil layer is blown or washed away. Without topsoil, little plant life is possible. The estimated annual costs of public and environmental health losses related to soil erosion exceed $45 billion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ce.cmu.edu/~gdrg/readings/2007/02/20/Pimental_EnvironmentalEnergeticAndEconomicComparisonsOfOrganicAndConventionalFarmingSystems.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional agriculture encourages the depletion of topsoil because the soil must be plowed and replanted each year. Sustainable techniques attempt to slow erosion through the use of [[cover crops]] in order to build organic matter in the soil. The United States alone loses almost 3 tons of topsoil per acre per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/nri |title=Summary Report, 2007 Natural Resources Inventory |publisher= Natural Resources Conservation Services, U. S. Department of Agriculture |date=December 2009 |page= 97}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is of great ecological concern as one inch of topsoil can take between 500&lt;ref name= Topsoil&gt;{{cite news|title=Eating Locally|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2001/may/feateatlocal|accessdate= May 1, 2001|newspaper=Discover |date= May 1, 2001 |author=James Smolka}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,000 years&lt;ref name="Scientific American"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/only-60-years-of-farming-left-if-soil-degradation-continues/|title=  Only 60 Years of Farming Left If Soil Degradation Continues | work=Scientific American| date=December 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to form naturally. On current trends, the world has about 60 years of topsoil left.&lt;ref name="Scientific American"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://world.time.com/2012/12/14/what-if-the-worlds-soil-runs-out/|title= What If the World's Soil Runs Out? | work=Time | date=December 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
Because of its use in commercial application and due to the environmental concerns regarding erosion, it is important for consumers to accurately determine how much topsoil they need for a given project.  Topsoil is mainly sold by the cubic yard in the United States.  To calculate the amount of topsoil you will need, "simply take your length (in feet) multiplied by your width (in feet) multiplied by your depth (in feet so if you wanted 5 inches that would be 5/12) then divide the total by 27.  This will give you your cubic yards needed for the project.  Ex: 10L x 10W x (5/12) = 41.66/27 = 1.54 cubic yards of topsoil needed.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://topsoildirtcheap.com/|title=Topsoil Delivery Topsoil Dirt Cheap ~ Topsoil Delivery|website=Topsoil Delivery|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tornado]]es are fairly uncommon in the US region of [[New England]]. Fewer tornadoes are recorded here than anywhere else east of the [[Rocky Mountains]].&lt;ref name="NEW200"&gt;Zielinski and Keim, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; However, these deadly and destructive storms do occur; on average, about eight tornadoes are reported in the region each year. Almost 200 people have been killed by these storms in recorded history, and two of the ten most destructive tornadoes in US history occurred in this region.

Tornadoes are a violent weather phenomenon that occur most often in the United States, to the east of the Rocky Mountains. However, they most often occur in the [[Southern United States|Southern]] and [[Central United States]], and are comparatively rare in New England. However, no region is immune to tornadoes if the weather conditions are right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2011/0602/Massachusetts-tornado-What-are-deadly-tornadoes-doing-way-up-in-New-England|title=Massachusetts tornado: What are deadly tornadoes doing way up in New England?|author=Pete Spotts|publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=2011-06-02|accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While tornadoes have been recorded in almost every county in New England, there is a region just east of [[The Berkshires]] with a much higher concentration of tornado occurrences. This area is analogous to the [[Tornado Alley]] of the [[Great Plains]], but on a much smaller scale.&lt;ref name="NEW200"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NCDC"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~storms|title= NCDC Storm Events|accessdate= 2008-05-13|year= 2008|publisher= [[National Climatic Data Center]]|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060417224134/http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~storms|archivedate= 2006-04-17|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On average (1950&amp;ndash;2008), more than two tornadoes per year strike the state of [[Massachusetts]] alone, with New England as a whole recording more than 8.&lt;ref name="NEW200"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NCDC"/&gt; Most tornadoes reported in the region are "weak", rated EF0 or EF1 on the [[Enhanced Fujita Scale]] (the [[Fujita scale]] prior to 2007). Around 30% are "significant" tornadoes (rated EF2 or greater), and only 1% are violent (rated EF4 or EF5, the highest damage rating). Weak tornadoes occur in all areas of New England, but EF3 or greater tornadoes have been reported only in New England's practical "Tornado Alley" of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and southern New Hampshire.&lt;ref name="NCDC"/&gt;

Peak tornado activity in New England occurs during the summer months of June, July and August. Tornadoes typically strike between 3 and 9 pm local time, and move at a forward speed of around {{convert|30|mph|km/h}}.&lt;ref name="awareness"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/gyx/aware_thu.txt |title=Severe Weather Awareness - Tornadoes |publisher=[[National Weather Service]] |location=[[Gray, Maine]] |date=May 5, 2011 | accessdate=July 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable tornadoes==

===Deadliest===
There have been 34 killer tornadoes in New England's recorded history.&lt;ref name="NCDC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grazulis, pgs 379, 552&amp;ndash;606&lt;/ref&gt; Several of these tornadoes have killed people:

*August 15, 1787: The '''[[Four-State Tornado Swarm]]''' caused damage in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. Two people were killed by a tornado in [[Wethersfield, Connecticut]], and many were injured throughout New England.&lt;ref&gt;Grazulis, pg. 553&lt;/ref&gt;
*September 9, 1821: '''[[September 1821 New England tornado outbreak|Several tornadoes]]''' struck northern and central New England, including the Great New Hampshire Tornado, which killed 6 people in New Hampshire, and another which killed two people in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Grazulis, pg. 556&lt;/ref&gt;
*August 9, 1878: A '''[[1878 Wallingford tornado|violent tornado]]''' killed either 29 or 34 people in [[Wallingford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;Grazulis, pg. 596&lt;/ref&gt;
*July 16, 1879: Two people were killed by a tornado in [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Grazulis, pg. 605&lt;/ref&gt;
*July 26, 1890: A tornado killed eight people in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Grazulis, pg. 653&lt;/ref&gt;
*July 4, 1898: A tornado struck [[Hampton Beach, New Hampshire]], a popular resort town. More than 100 people sought refuge in the skating rink, and three people were killed and 120 injured when the roof collapsed. Twenty cottages were also destroyed. A yacht was overturned by the storm, drowning five people, but it is unclear whether this was due to the tornado.&lt;ref&gt;Grazulis, pg. 684&lt;/ref&gt;
*June 9, 1953: The '''[[1953 Worcester tornado]]''' killed 94 people as it damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in central Massachusetts, including the city of Worcester.&lt;ref&gt;Grazulis, pg. 974&lt;/ref&gt;
*August 28, 1973: A tornado touched down near [[Canaan, New York]], and moved into western [[Massachusetts]]. Three people were killed in [[West Stockbridge, Massachusetts|West Stockbridge]] when a truck stop was completely destroyed, and another person died in a destroyed house nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Grazulis, pg. 1144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Tornado Kills 4, Injures 31 Along Berkshire State Line|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4GhGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FekMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3390,3084969&amp;dq=tornado+kills+4+in+massachusetts&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[Schenectady Gazette]] |location= [[Schenectady, New York]] |date= August 29, 1973 |page= 1 |accessdate= 2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only two tornadoes in the history of New England have killed more than 10 people: the [[Flint-Worcester tornado outbreak sequence|1953 Worcester Tornado]] and the [[1878 Wallingford tornado]]. The Worcester Tornado killed as many as 94 people in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], on June 9, 1953, and the Wallingford Tornado killed as many as 34 in [[Wallingford, Connecticut]], on August 8, 1878. These two tornadoes, both estimated to be of F4 intensity on the [[Fujita scale]], killed more people than the rest of the tornadoes in the region's recorded history combined. Since most New England tornadoes are weak and short-lived, it is understandable why tornadoes causing fatalities are a rare occurrence.

===Costliest===

Of the costliest tornadoes in US history (adjusted for inflation), two occurred in New England: The [[1979 Windsor Locks, Connecticut tornado]], which caused $200 million in damage (${{Inflation|US|200|1979|r=0}} million in {{CURRENTYEAR}} [[United States Dollar|USD]]), and the 1953 Worcester tornado, which caused $52 million in damage (${{Inflation|US|52|1953|r=0}} million in {{CURRENTYEAR}} [[United States Dollar|USD]]).&lt;ref name="costliest"&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Brooks| first1 = Harold E.| authorlink1 = Harold E.

The '''United Nations-Oceans''' ('''UN-Oceans''' or '''UN-O''') is an inter-agency coordination mechanism of the [[United Nations]], set up to enhance cooperation and coordination of activities concerned with the world oceans and coasts. The UN-Oceans was formed in September 2003 by the United Nations System Chief Executive Board (CEB), to replace the Sub-Committee on Oceans and Coastal Areas (SOCA) of the Administrative Committee on coordination (ACC) that was formed in 1993.

==History==
Following the [[Earth Summit]] that took place in [[Rio de Janeiro]] on June 13, 1992, 178 governments of the [[United Nations]] agreed upon [[Agenda 21]] as an action plan for the 21st century for sustainable living. As part of this sustainable living, UN agencies involved in the coordination of ocean and coastal issues formed the 'Sub-Committee on Oceans and Coastal Issues' (SOCA) as part of the 'Administrative Committee on cooridination' (ACC). This was in compliance with chapter 17 of Agenda 21 which refers to the protection of the Earth's oceans and the rational use and development of their resources in the 21st century.

In 2001, the ACC (now the United Nations System Chief Executive Board) conducted a review of its subsidiary committees (including SOCA) and announced that they should cease to exist by the end of 2001; that task-oriented arrangements such as those to do with the ocean, and any inter-agency support requirements be handled by a lead agency. Following consultations between UN Programs, agencies and organisations involved in coordinating oceans and coasts, indications of interest in forming a new inter-agency coordination mechanism became apparent. The United Nations High Level-Committee on programmes approved the creation of the United Nations-Oceans in 2003 as the new network in the UN system.

==UN Atlas of the Oceans==
The UN Atlas of the Oceans was created under the authority of the UN-Oceans, as an information system designed for policy-makers and scientists to help them to know more about the oceans such as its [[biology]], [[geology]], research and exploration; issues of concern such as [[sustainable development]] and food security; and the uses of the ocean such as human settlement and extraction.

[[File:Localització del Baridà respecte de l'Alt Urgell i la Baixa Cerdanya.svg|thumb|200px|Baridà (in blue) inside administrative comarcas of [[Baixa Cerdanya]] (in green) and [[Alt Urgell]] (in light yellow Urgellet, in yellow southern Alt Urgell)]]

'''Urgellet''' ({{IPA-ca|uɾʒəˈʎɛt}}) is a [[historical region|historical]] territory and a [[natural region]] of [[Catalonia]]. It is located in the [[Pyrenees]] exactly in the actual administrative [[comarques of Catalonia|comarca]] of [[Alt Urgell]], that last includes [[Baridà]], Urgellet and the banks of [[Oliana]], [[Peramola]] and [[Bassella]].

==Geography==
The mountainous territory of Urgellet is almost wholly part of the [[Alt Urgell]], except for the eastern Baridà and the southern sector. The [[Mollet Gorge]] is the natural boundary between the Urgellet and Baridà.

The history of Urgellet is highly related to ''Sedes Urgelli'' ([[La Seu d'Urgell]] or city of Urgell), the [[Bishop of Urgell]] and the [[County of Urgell]]. In the latter case, the territory Urgellet was leading the county, with capital in [[la Seu d'Urgell]], and extended southwards up to the comarques of [[Urgell]] and [[Pla d'Urgell]], among others. For this reason some towns and two comarques in Lleida contain the name of ''Urgell'' that has its origin in the city of Urgell and Urgellet region.
==Etymology==
The name ''Urgell'' has a specifically Pyrenean pre-Roman origin.&lt;ref name="formació"&gt;Antoni M. Badia i Margarit, ''La formació de la llengua catalana''. Editorial L'Abadia de Montserrat, Barcelona 1987. {{ISBN|8472028763}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist Joan Coromines interprets the meaning as related to the presence of water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grec.cat/cgibin/ggcc01cl.pgm?USUARI=&amp;SESSIO=&amp;PGMORI=&amp;NDCHEC=0600501 GGCC, l'Urgell: L'origen del topònim]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="391">In [[Spanish language]] a '''ventisquero''' is a zone in a [[mountain]] where heavy [[snow]] accumulations occur. Before the term ''glaciar'' (Spanish for [[glacier]]) became widespread many glaciers in [[Patagonia]] were titled with ventisquero, such as [[Ventisquero Negro]] or [[Grandes Ventisqueros]].

Vineyard Power develops local renewable energy projects and plans to assist the island of [[Martha's Vineyard]] to meet the energy goals of the Island Plan, and work towards a 100% renewable energy supply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://islandplan.org Island Plan: The Island Plan - Moving Towards Implementation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The founding of Vineyard Power was inspired by the renewable energy vision of the people of Samso island in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;https://vineyardgazette.com/news/2010/02/19/vision-true-vineyard-energy-independence&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Wind Power==
Offshore wind development is another of the motivations for creating the Vineyard Power Co-op, with the recognition this energy source would need community support. The National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) classifies the sound and ocean around Martha's Vineyard to be "Excellent" (between 7.5 and 8 meters per second (m/s) in regard to energy generation potential, at 50 meters altitude) or "Outstanding" (between 8.0 and 8.8 m/s).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy10osti/40745.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The first proposal for offshore wind in the area, known as Cape Wind, created significant opposition focused on the lack of community involvement, and visual impacts. https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2011/1437.html That project obtained a lease for development in Federal waters six miles from land in Nantucket Sound. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.boem.gov/Massachusetts-Cape-Wind/ &lt;/ref&gt;

Vineyard Power organized public input into the planning wind farm development off the southern shores of the island,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rechargenews.com/hardcopy/article263967.ece Tiny developer has big plans off Massachusetts - Hardcopy - Renewable energy news - Recharge - wind, solar, biomass, wave/tidal/hydro and geothermal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; with [http://www.offshoremwllc.com OffshoreMW], and [http://www.boem.gov Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE)].  This collaboration began as the Martha's Vineyard Offshore Wind Alliance (MVOWA) in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mvgazette.com/article.php?29792 Vineyard Power Cooperative Joins Partner in Bid on Wind - 4/29/11 - Vineyard Gazette Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Vineyard Power Co-op signed a Community Benefits Agreement with that one developer to formalize this arrangement for mutual benefit, and to pursue better community input and economic development for the people of Martha's Vineyard. The development is now called Vineyard Wind.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vineyardwind.com/in-your-community-2/&lt;/ref&gt; The permitting process for this offshore windfarm is underway.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.boem.gov/Vineyard-Wind/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solar Power==

During the years when the Federal process for offshore wind development moved slowly, the Co-op identified opportunities to develop solar projects on the island. The first of these were solar canopies in the parking lot at the locally-owned supermaket. Benefits for more citizens came through building solar on town-owned landfills. Town of Aquinnah chose the company, after an RFP, for a solar plant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mvtimes.com/2011/12/08/aquinnah-voters-approve-solar-array-town-landfill-8735/ Aquinnah voters approve solar array at town landfill : The Martha's Vineyard Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Construction was started and completed in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mvgazette.com/article.php?34565 Solar Project Gets Early Green Light - 3/30/12 - Vineyard Gazette Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent solar project completed is on the roof of the Boys and Girls Club.&lt;ref&gt;https://us.sunpower.com/blog/2017/04/12/celebrate-earth-month-marthas-vineyard-sustainable-living-community/&lt;/ref&gt;

==100% Renewable Energy==
The Co-op promotes planning and practices that reduce fossil fuel use and the replacement with renewable electricity. The first solar canopies built by the Co-op include electric vehicle chargers. The Co-op continues to support electric vehicle adoption.  Leaders of island organizations met in September 2017 at the initiative of the Co-op and Environment Massachusetts to develop a vision of 100% renewable energy use for the island.&lt;ref&gt;https://calendar.vineyardgazette.com/event/vineyard_power_8th_annual_member_meeting#.Wu8UpNPwau4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Wandjina rock art.jpg|thumb|Wandjina [[rock art]] on the [[Barnett River]], [[Mount Elizabeth Station]]]]

The '''Wandjina''' (sometimes '''Wondjina''') are cloud and rain [[spirits]] from [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]] that are depicted prominently in [[rock art]] in [[Australia]]. Some of the artwork in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley region]] of [[Western Australia]] dates back approximately 4,000 years ago.

The stories of the Wandjina and the artwork depicting them remain important to the [[Mowanjum Community]] of Indigenous people.

Wandjina were the inspiration for a 1966 children's fantasy television series, ''[[Wandjina!]]'', produced by [[ABC Television]] in 1966.

==Dreamtime legends==
[[Dreamtime]] stories say the Wandjina created the landscape and its inhabitants, and continue to have influence over both. When the spirits found the place they would die, they painted their images on [[cave]] walls and entered a nearby waterhole. These paintings were then refreshed by Aborigines as a method of regenerating life force.&lt;ref&gt; Yorro Yorro: everything standing up alive, (1993), Mowaljarlai, D, and Malnic, J., Magabala Books, pp137-139.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wandjina can punish those who break the law with floods, lightning and cyclones.&lt;ref name= FloodRockArt&gt;{{cite book | author = Flood, Josephine
| title = Rock Art of the Dreamtime 
| year = 1997
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional rock artwork==

The broad-stroke artwork of the Wandjina rock art dates around 3800–4000 years ago. The emergence of this art style follows the end of a millennium-long drought that gave way to a wetter climate characterised by regular monsoons.&lt;ref name="ENSO Evidence"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGown|first1=Hamish|last2=Marx|first2=Samuel|last3=Moss|first3=Patrick|last4=Hammond|first4=Andrew|title=Evidence of ENSO mega-drought triggered collapse of prehistory Aboriginal society in northwest Australia|journal=Geographical Research Letters|date=28 November 2012|volume=39|issue=22|pages=5|doi=10.1029/2012GL053916|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2012GL053916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wandjina paintings have common colors of black, red and yellow on a white background.  The spirits are depicted alone or in groups, vertically or horizontally depending on the dimensions of the rock, and are sometimes depicted with figures and objects like the [[Rainbow Serpent]] or [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]].  Common composition is with large upper bodies and heads that show eyes and nose, but typically no mouth.  Two explanations have been given for this: they are so powerful they do not require speech and if they had mouths, the rain would never cease.  Around the heads of Wandjina are lines or blocks of color, depicting lighting coming out of transparent helmets.&lt;ref name=FloodRockArt/&gt;

Today, the paintings are still believed to possess these powers and therefore are to be approached and treated respectfully.  Each site and painting has a name.
Indigenous people of the [[Mowanjum Community]] repaint the images to ensure the continuity of the Wandjina's presence.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
| author = Flood, Josephine
| title = Rock Art of the Dreamtime
| year = 1997
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Annual repainting in December or January also ensures the arrival of the monsoon rains, according to Mowanjum belief.&lt;ref&gt;

|author1=Akerman, Kim  |author2=Ryan, Judith
 |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Images of Power: Aboriginal Art of the Kimberley
| year = 1993
}} p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

Repainting has occurred so often that at one site the paint is over 40 layers deep.  The painting style has evolved during this process: more recent figures are stockier and some now possess eyelashes.&lt;ref&gt;

==Depictions on Bark==
In late 1960's and early 1970's several Mowanjum artists depicted traditional Wandjina on pieces of string bark. These artworks were sold mainly through the mission at [[Kalumburu, Western Australia|Kalumbaru]]. Some of the important artists from this region include Alec Mingelmanganu&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aboriginal-bark-paintings.com/alec-mingelmanganu/|title=Alec Mingelmanganu wandjina {{!}} wondjina {{!}} sell Alec Mingelmanganu|date=2017-09-18|work=Aboriginal Bark Paintings|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Charlie Numbelmoore&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aboriginal-bark-paintings.com/charlie-numbelmoore/|title=Charlie Numbelmoore {{!}} Charlie Numbulbor {{!}} sell Charlie Numbelmoore|date=2017-09-18|work=Aboriginal Bark Paintings|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jack Karedada&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aboriginal-bark-paintings.com/jack-karedada/|title=Jack Karedada wandjina painting {{!}} wondjina {{!}} Sell Jack Karedada|date=2017-09-18|work=Aboriginal Bark Paintings|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These artworks are now in major museum collections around the world. Initially as per tradition only men painted Wandjina but in the early 1970's several women artists like Lily Karedada&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aboriginal-bark-paintings.com/lily-karedada/|title=Lily Karedada wandjina {{!}} sell Lily Karedada {{!}} wanjina {{!}} wondjina|date=2017-12-22|work=Aboriginal Bark Paintings|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ignatia Djangharra&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aboriginal-bark-paintings.com/ignatia-djanghara/|title=Ignatia Djanghara wandjina {{!}} sell Ignatia Djanghara {{!}} wanjina {{!}} wondjina|date=2017-12-13|work=Aboriginal Bark Paintings|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; also painted Wandjina on bark and later on canvass.

==Other depictions==
In 2007, [[graffiti]] depictions of Wandjina appeared in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]].  Styles ranged from stencil-work to a spray painted Wandjina driving a pink car.  Using [[Flickr]] and [[blogs]], several people engaged in 'Wandjina watching', documenting the Wandjina graffiti they found.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://perth.norg.com.au/2007/01/05/watching_the_wandjina/ perth.norg.com. au/2007/01/05/watching_the_wandjina/]&lt;/ref&gt; These 'wandering Wandjina' angered and upset some Indigenous people who said that only certain of their people are permitted to depict the Wandjina, without saying who these people are.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/wandering-wandjinas-mystery/story-e6frg13u-1111112784667&lt;/ref&gt; A short film, ''Who Paintin' Dis Wandjina'', discussed the Aboriginal reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativespirits.info/resources/movies/who-paintin-dis-wandjina.html|title=Australian Aboriginal movies, films &amp; Indigenous DVDs|first=Jens Korff, Creative|last=Spirits|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Images of the Wandjina are displayed on the walls of the [[Ringwood]] Magistrates Court in Victoria; these are referenced as produced the [[National Gallery of Victoria]].
