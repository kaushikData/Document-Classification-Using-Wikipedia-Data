      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6949">An '''advanced electronic signature''' ('''AdES''') is an [[electronic signature]] that has met the requirements set forth under [[eIDAS|EU Regulation No 910/2014 (eIDAS-regulation)]] on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the [[internal market]].&lt;ref name="Turner-advancedESig"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Advanced Electronic Signatures for eIDAS|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/advanced-electronic-signatures|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

eIDAS created standards for the use of [[electronic signature]]s so that they could be used in a secure manner when conducting [[business]] online, such as an [[Electronic funds transfer|electronic fund transfer]] or official business across borders with [[Member state of the European Union|EU Member States]].&lt;ref name="Forget-eIDAS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Forget|first1=Guillaume|title=The eIDAS regulation is coming. How can banks benefit from it?|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/the-eidas-regulation-is-coming.-how-can-banks-benefit-from-it|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advanced electronic signature is one of the standards outlined in eIDAS.

For an electronic signature to be considered as advanced, it must meet several requirements:&lt;ref name="eIDAS-Regulation"&gt;{{cite web|last1=THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION|title=Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG|publisher=EUR-Lex|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UK-ESig"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Department for Business Innovation &amp; Skills|title=Electronic Signatures (Guide)|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/356786/bis-14-1072-electronic-signatures-guide.pdf|publisher=The Government of the United Kingdom|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The [[signature|signatory]] can be uniquely identified and linked to the signature
# The signatory must have sole control of the signature creation data (typically a [[Public-key cryptography|private key]]) that was used to create the electronic signature
# The signature must be capable of identifying if its accompanying data has been tampered with after the message was signed
# In the event that the accompanying data has been changed, the signature must be invalidated

Advanced electronic signatures that are compliant with eIDAS may be technically implemented through the Ades Baseline Profiles that have been developed by the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI):&lt;ref name="eIDAS-Regulation" /&gt;
* [[XAdES]], XML Advanced Electronic Signatures is a set of extensions to XML-DSig recommendation making it suitable for Advanced Electronic Signatures. 
* [[PAdES]], PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures is a set of restrictions and extensions to PDF and ISO 32000-1 making it suitable for Advanced Electronic Signature. 
* [[CAdES (computing)|CAdES]], CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures is a set of extensions to Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) signed data making it suitable for advanced electronic signatures.
* ASiC Baseline Profile. ASiC ([[Associated Signature Containers]]) specifies the use of container structures to bind together one or more signed objects with either advanced electronic signatures or time-stamp tokens into one single digital ([[Zip_(file_format)|zip]]) container.&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{cite web|last1=|first1=|title=Asic Baseline Profile|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103100_103199/103174/02.02.01_60/ts_103174v020201p.pdf|publisher=etsi.org|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vision==

The implementation of advanced electronic signatures under the specification of eIDAS serves several purposes. Business and [[public service]]s processes, even those that go across borders can be safely expedited by using electronic signing. With eIDAS, EU States are required to establish “points of single contact” (PSCs) for trust services that ensure the electronic ID schemes can be used in public sector transactions that occur cross-borders, including access to healthcare information across borders.&lt;ref name="eIDAS-Regulation" /&gt;

In the past, when signing a document or message, the signatory would sign it and then return it to its intended recipient through the postal service, via [[facsimile]] service, or by scanning and attaching it to an email. This could lead to delays and of course, the possibility that signatures could be forged and documents altered, especially when multiple signatures from different people located in different locations are required. The process of using an advanced electronic signature saves time, is legally binding and assures a high level of technical security.&lt;ref name="eIDAS-Regulation" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mazzeo|first1=Mirella|title=Digital Signatures and European Laws|url=http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/digital-signatures-and-european-laws|publisher=Symantec|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal implications==

Following Article 25 (1) of the eIDAS regulation,&lt;ref name="eIDAS-Regulation" /&gt; an advanced electronic signature shall "not be denied legal effect and admissibility as evidence in legal proceedings". However it will reach a higher [[Relevance (law)|probative value]] when enhanced to the level of a [[qualified electronic signature]]. By adding a certificate that has been issued by a qualified [[trust service provider]] that attests to the authenticity of the qualified signature, the upgraded advanced signature then carries according to Article 24 (2) of the eIDAS Regulation&lt;ref name="eIDAS-Regulation" /&gt; the same legal value as a handwritten signature.&lt;ref name="Turner-advancedESig" /&gt; However, this is only regulated in the European Union and similarly through [[ZertES]] in [[Switzerland]]. A qualified electronic signature is not defined in the United States.&lt;ref name="TurnerDSS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tuner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Is the NIST Digital Signature Standard DSS legally binding?|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/is-the-nist-digital-signature-standard-dss-legally-binding|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DSS-Ref"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Information Technology Laboratory National Institute of Standards and Technology|title=FEDERAL INFORMATION PROCESSING STANDARDS  PUBLICATION (FIPS PUB 186 -4): Digital Signature Standard (DSS)|url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-4.pdf|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11348">[[File:Bfs uniform.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Uniform, headgear and headquarters sign of the British Frontier Service]]
The '''British Frontier Service''' was a [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] organisation that was responsible for border monitoring duties in [[West Germany]] between 1946 and 1991. Its personnel served on Germany's international borders with [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] before focusing on the [[inner German border]]. It was charged with a number of tasks, including assisting the movements of British military personnel and their dependents, monitoring the border regions and helping to defuse border incidents. It was ultimately disbanded following [[German reunification]].

==Establishment of the British Frontier Service==

Following the end of the [[Second World War]], British troops in Germany were deployed along the international borders of the British zone of [[Allied-occupied Germany]] to control the flow of refugees and prevent smuggling. They were replaced in 1946 by the Frontier Control Service, a civilian frontier force administered by the British Control Commission of Germany. It went through a series of names thereafter: the Frontier Control Service from 1946–49; the Frontier Inspection Service, 1949–55; and British Frontier Service, 1955-91.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stacy|Stacy (1984)]], p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of its members were recruited from the [[Royal Marines]], the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[British Army]]. Its first director was a Royal Navy officer, Captain Guy Maund [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]]. It was under his leadership that the BFS adopted its distinctive naval-style uniform with silver rank badges.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Shears|Shears (1970)]], p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Its personnel were given honorary Army ranks, with its director given the rank of full [[colonel]].&lt;ref name="Britons"&gt;{{cite news|title=Britons Who Help To Keep Frontier Peace|work=The Times|date=4 August 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BFS initially had 300 personnel, augmented by remaining personnel from the German customs service. Former German customs officials were released from [[prisoner of war]] camps and put to work carrying out day-to-day border control duties, while the BFS concentrated on preventing illegal activities such as smuggling and unauthorised border crossings. For the first few years after the war it concentrated almost entirely on Germany's borders with [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]] and the [[Netherlands]], leaving the border of the [[Soviet occupation zone]] almost entirely unguarded. This changed after the [[Berlin Blockade]] of 1948-49 and the increasing flow of illegal imports from the Soviet zone. The BFS and the newly established West German ''Zollgrenzdienst'' (Federal Customs Service) were deployed along what became the [[inner German border]] from [[Lübeck]] down to [[Göttingen]], a distance of some {{convert|660|km|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stacy|Stacy (1984)]], pp. 261-62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes to the role of the BFS==

In 1955 the British Control Commission was wound up as sovereignty was passed from the Western Allies to the West German state. The BFS underwent drastic changes, passing from the jurisdiction of the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] to that of the War Office, later the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (although it remained a civilian organisation). Its staff was reduced from around 300 personnel to 38, and it lost many of its executive responsibilities. A limited number of its staff worked on the eastern border but the majority worked at transit points as liaison with the German border authorities. They assisted with the movements of members of the British armed forces in Germany and their dependents, under the [[Status of Forces Agreement]] with West Germany. The headquarters of the BFS was moved to Wahner Heide near [[Bonn]] – now [[Cologne Bonn Airport]] – where it was administered as part of the Joint Services Liaison Organization. Its operations along the eastern border were administered from a regional headquarters at [[Hannover]]. Additional regional liaison offices were located in [[Berlin]], [[Düsseldorf]] and [[Helmstedt]], near the main border crossing ([[Helmstedt–Marienborn border crossing|Checkpoint Alpha]]) on the Hamburg-Berlin [[autobahn]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stacy|Stacy (1984)]], pp. 262-63&lt;/ref&gt;

The BFS went through further changes in 1967, when it was established as a permanent [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Civil Service]] organisation. Its role changed again in 1972 following the signature of the [[Basic Treaty, 1972|Treaty on the Basis of Relations]] between East and West Germany, when the two states agreed to recognise each other. The British government took the view at this point that the United Kingdom was no longer responsible for the inner German border and considered eliminating the BFS altogether. However, it was decided that it would continue to have a very limited role on the border, chiefly involving conducting liaison with the German border agencies. It was reduced to 16 members with only the British Frontier Post at Helmstedt, manned by four personnel, remaining open.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stacy|Stacy (1984)]], p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; The BFS was finally dissolved on 28 May 1991, following the reunification of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;"Grenzbewacher West". Zonengrenze-Museum, Helmstedt.&lt;/ref&gt;

==BFS on the ground==

Behind them is a high mesh fence, behind which is a tall watchtower with an octagonal cabin at its top.|Joint British Army – British Frontier Service patrol near Helmstedt, early 1970s]]
Between 1955 and 1972, the BFS played a front-line role in managing tensions on the inner German border. Its officers were called to the scene of border incidents or unusual activity to defuse disputes and provide an independent British view of situations. They dealt with a wide variety of incidents ranging from escapes over the East German border fortifications, to intruding East German border markers, or attempts to block West German boats along the disputed river border on the [[Elbe]]. West German customs or [[Bundesgrenzschutz]] (BGS Federal Border Protection) personnel would deal directly with the East Germans with the BFS officer providing advice.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Shears|Shears (1970)]], pp. 102-03&lt;/ref&gt;

The BFS also assisted the British Army in carrying out patrols of the inner German border. Its personnel were a familiar sight, guiding units of the [[British Army of the Rhine]] (BAOR) along the southern sector of the British zone from [[Lauenburg]] to Schmidekopf. Although the BAOR did not patrol the much shorter northern sector from Lübeck to Lauenburg, the BFS filled the gap with occasional "visits".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stacy|Stacy (1984)]], p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; It presented a somewhat odd appearance, described by ''The Times'' as "delightful, perhaps unique":

{{quote|With its fleet of patrol cars, carrying built-in radio telephones and Union Jack badges, and its military language ("That's the drill, Arthur"), the BFS brings to mind some imperial field force of the 1880s, nearer-flung than of yore, for whose members, perhaps, the Elbe is a faint substitute for the [[Nile]], the [[Zambezi]] or the [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy]].&lt;ref name="Britons" /&gt;}}

==Notable BFS personnel==

Several BFS personnel were honoured for their work. Jack Owen, a BFS officer and former Royal Marine, was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in 1963 following a tense incident at Bohldamm near [[Lüchow]] in [[Lower Saxony]]. The border ran along a stream, but its precise location was disputed. The West Germans considered the far side of the stream to be the location of the border, while the East Germans regarded the border as lying in the middle of the stream. An overgrown cobbled footbridge crossed the stream but was blocked by the East Germans with a movable [[barbed wire]] trestle barrier situated at the far end of the bridge. One day in 1962 the East Germans moved the barrier to the middle of the bridge, despite protests from West German border guards and customs officials. The situation escalated when the East Germans warned that they would shoot anyone who touched the trestle and backed up their warning by emplacing machine guns and armoured cars on their side of the stream. The West Germans called up a BFS platoon and a British Army section to back them up. Owen called the East Germans' bluff by walking onto the bridge with two British soldiers and carrying the trestle back to the eastern side of the stream. He then stood by it for the next eight hours to make sure that it would not be moved again.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Shears|Shears (1970)]], p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ascherson|first=Neal|title=British men in blue keep border watch|work=The Observer|date=30 January 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tommy Jones, a former member of the [[Royal Military Police]] [[Special Investigation Branch|special investigations branch]], became well known as a guide for Western journalists and visitors to the inner German border. Although he escorted around 4,000-5,000 visitors a year along the border, he averred that he "never [got] frustrated. It is important to show people this border. It is impossible to imagine it or to describe it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barker|first=Dennis|title=One of the weirdest frontiers known to man-fences and automatic guns and trenches|work=The Guardian|date=27 May 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones arrived in Germany in 1945 during the British advance to the Elbe in the closing months of the Second World War and remained there for the next 45 years. He joined the BFS in 1960, moved to Helmstedt in 1974 and became the head of the BFS in 1983, by which time it had only four personnel left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marsh|first=David|title=All Too Blinking Quiet On The Eastern Front|work=Financial Times|date=21 June 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1990, he was awarded an MBE and retired to become a [[Chelsea Pensioner]]. His departure was noted not just by the West Germans with whom he had worked for so long, but by the East German border guards as well; as he put it, "For 16 years at Helmstedt, the East German border guards never spoke to me... All they did was take pictures of me from behind bushes. When the border was opened, suddenly the East German guards decided they wanted to try and shake my hand. But I didn't feel like shaking their hands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Evans|first=Michael|title=Border watchdog, Thomas Jones, completes 30-year patrol|work=The Times|date=15 February 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''California Association of Student Councils''' ('''CASC''') is a non-profit, student-led youth leadership and advocacy organization.

== Overview ==
The '''California Association of Student Councils''' is a youth training/mentoring organization that also lobbies for youth-oriented legislation. It runs over sixty student leadership training events a year training students from elementary, middle, and high school students in leadership and team-building skills. All trainings are peer-to-peer, and thus all directors and counselors at the conferences are students.

In addition to leadership trainings, CASC serves as an advocate for youth in Sacramento, lobbying continuously through the year. CASC holds two conferences each year at which students create formal proposals to the [[California State Board of Education]] and [[California State Senate]] or [[California State Assembly]] Education Committees. 

CASC programs are hands-on experiences that demonstrate the power of peer-to-peer teaching, with students as mentors and instructors. CASC works toward the principles on which it was founded in 1947: “to give students actual experiences and involvement in decision making and democratic experiences.” Their student officers, trainers and alumni are consistently recognized for their professionalism, competence, and adaptability.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idealist.org/if/i/en/av/Org/14910-61&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mission===
“The mission of the California Association of Student Councils is to provide leadership development for elementary, middle and high school students that emphasize authenticity, ethics, and collaborative decision-making through peer counseling. Our primary focus is the training of students, advisors and organizations in California and across the world. CASC enhances the quality of education by involving students in activities and programs outside the classroom that build citizenship and encourage self-esteem. CASC serves as an advocate for youth, provides a channel for student views, and empowers youth to take action."&lt;ref name="about"&gt;http://www.casc.net/about&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purpose===

'''Canadian Unitarian Universalist Women's Association''' ('''CUUWA''') (established in May 2011) is a Canadian [[Unitarian Universalist]] [[women's rights]] organization that is an associate member of the [[Canadian Unitarian Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuuwa.org/about/ |title=About us|publisher=www.cuuwa.org |accessdate=June 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association wants to raise awareness for women and close the gender gap. For example, research has shown that in businesses, women have less than one-fifth of a chance to get promoted and move up the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kay|first1=Alison|title=Back To The Future To Speed Up Gender Parity?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ey/2016/01/20/back-to-the-future-to-speed-up-gender-parity/#7e79ee822e4e|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before the official Canadian Unitarian Universalist Women's Association was established, it was originally called the Canadian Unitarian Universalist Women's Federation that wanted to raise awareness for women's education, human rights, and equality of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.cuuwa.org/about/history-2/|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, they got participants from Prairie Women's Gathering and the Vancouver Island Women's retreat which finally got them a pre-conference workshop in Victoria. At this meeting, many women were attracted to this organization and many of Canadian women were there.  From there, they changed the name to Canadian Unitarian Universalist Women's Association and is officially the first national women movement in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.cuuwa.org/about/history-2/|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The Canadian Unitarian Universalist Women's Association main mission is to raise awareness of women history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=By-Laws|url=http://www.cuuwa.org/about/bylaws/|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past years, women weren't acknowledged for their works that they contributed to society. The Association aims to change the attitudes society placed on women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benner|first1=Louise|title=Women in the 1920s in North Carolina|url=https://www.ncpedia.org/history/20th-Century/1920s-women|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and inform our society of the issues that women have dealt with on a national and international level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=By-Laws|url=http://www.cuuwa.org/about/bylaws/|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women have always faced a gender wage gap from men and deserves to get paid equally for their contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Facts About Women and Poverty|url=http://www.canadianwomen.org/facts-about-women-and-poverty#1.|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Canadian Unitarian Universalist Women's Association wants to circulate educational learning materials that highlight their work to prove to others of their contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=By-Laws|url=http://www.cuuwa.org/about/bylaws/|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women deserve to be equal to any other human being and deserve more recognition.

==Objectives==
The women's movement hopes to have access to the women members in the congregation of their contributions, roles, and responsibilities that are affiliated with the Unitarian Universalist in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=By-Laws|url=http://www.cuuwa.org/about/bylaws/|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the movement hopes to achieve other women individuals to step up and join this organization. The Canadian Unitarian Universalist Women's Association are hosting annual meetings located in Host City or the Canadian Unitarian Council Annual Conference and hopes others will come out to support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Events|url=http://www.cuuwa.org/events/|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an emphasis on gender awareness within programmes and women from Darfur and elsewhere in Sudan have played a prominent role in the process.&lt;ref name=website/&gt;

==Methodology==

Concordis International’s interventions are based on unofficial dialogue between and across different levels of society on different sides engaged in or affected by violent conflicts.  The dialogue focuses on the issues surrounding the causes and consequences of conflicts and is informed by expert contributions and research. The aim of this is to:
*Build trust across lines of conflict and social divisions
*Facilitate consensus building on the basis of shared interest
*Contribute positively to negotiation processes
*Create the climate for more general peaceful relations
Concordis’ work is guided by:
*A commitment to justice and reconciliation grounded in the Christian roots of the organisation's history
*Conscious impartiality as a facilitator
*Recognition of the need for sustained, long-term engagement.&lt;ref name=website/&gt;

==Work in Sudan and South Sudan==

Concordis International’s work in Sudan and South Sudan has aimed to facilitate informal dialogue, providing a forum where North and South Sudanese representatives can work together on key issues.&lt;ref name=website/&gt;  Grounded in ten previous years of sustained peacebuilding engagement, the 2-year Sudanese Peace-Building Initiative (PBI), primarily funded by the European Union, lasted from January 2009 to December 2010 and, in cooperation with a number of Sudanese partners, increasingly focused on the development of cooperative, secure and economically viable relations across Sudan’s North-South border.  With further funding from the EU and Norway, this border-related work continues.
Concordis has recently started work on a new project called Cultural Healing, based on a concept developed by British-Sudanese filmmaker Taghreed Elsanhouri and funded by the European Union.  Work began for this project in 2010 and is scheduled to end in March 2013. The programme is inspired by a successful EU co-funded programme in Afghanistan which has contributed towards the development of an independent media sector. The programme involves training people from a wide range of backgrounds within Sudan and South Sudan to make films that express their own culture and traditions. It will be jointly executed with a local partner Nasaq.  
Concordis’ work on Darfur started soon after the Darfur conflict broke out in 2003. A series of inclusive consultations were held in 2004-5 on land use and tenure, on cultural, political and economic marginalisation of the region and also on enabling the sustainable and safe return as well as integration of the displaced.  After the signature of the Darfur Peace Accord in 2006, Concordis worked with senior Darfurians, the African Union and others to develop Darfurian unity as a foundation for a lasting settlement.&lt;ref name=website/&gt;
Concordis has also worked in partnership with the Sudan Inter-Religious Council (SIRC) &lt;ref name=website/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insightonconflict.org/conflicts/sudan/peacebuilding-organisations/sirc/ |title=Sudan Inter-Religious Council (SIRC) |publisher=Insight on Conflict |date=2011-08-15 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; to develop the capacity of Sudanese religious leaders of different faiths, from across the country, to cooperate in promoting and facilitating peace and reconciliation.

==Work in Kenya==
Concordis International's work in [[Kenya]] focuses on policy-makers from the national to the community level and aims to encourage dialogue on land reform as Kenya starts to implement a New Land Policy. Consultations to promote reconciliation and reduce the threat of renewed violent conflict in Kenya are held in partnership with the Sychar Centre and the Institute for the Study of African Realities, both in Nairobi.To date, three such consultations have been facilitated in Nairobi since 2008.&lt;ref name=website/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sycharcentre.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=31 |title=Links |publisher=Sychar Centre |date= |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement Elsewhere==

Concordis conducted background research and an assessment of conflict in [[Afghanistan]] in 2003 prior to a visit there in January 2004. Concordis has maintained a modest level of research and networking on Afghanistan for several years and has been involved in the Afghan/Canadian-led [[Pathways To Peace]] project.&lt;ref name=website/&gt;
Concordis  assisted the Annapolis Friends Peace and Justice Center with expert advice on its work with the Palestinian/Israeli Geneva Initiative, bringing Palestinian and Israeli participants together for three days of intensive discussions in August 2008 on the difficult issue of access to water supplies.  Concordis held a consultation in 2009 on the role of churches in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, bringing together experts and leaders from UK churches.
Concordis has undertaken in-depth research and confidential partnering discussions in other areas and also contributes to conflict analysis and public awareness, informing different groups about the complexities of conflict.&lt;ref name=website/&gt;&lt;ref name="jubilee-centre1"/&gt;

A '''credit tenant lease''' is a method of financing [[real estate]]. The landlord borrows money to finance the property and pledges as security the rents to be received from the tenant. Usually, the financing is structured as [[nonrecourse debt]], and the lease is structured as a [[triple net lease]].

Credit tenant leases may be created either in sale/leaseback transactions, or new purchase transactions.

A credit tenant is usually an organization with a national footprint, a large regional tenant, or a local tenant with excellent credit that may be better than their national competitors. Only larger companies are called credit tenants. A lender will offer better financing terms for a development with a certain amount of space preleased or currently leased to credit tenants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1567">'''Empty Beds, Wasted Dollars''' was the strategic communications and advocacy strategy developed and executed by [[Edward Borges]] to support New York State Office of Children and Family Services Commissioner [[Gladys Carrion]]'s transformation of New York's juvenile justice system from a failed, punitive, correctional model to an evidence-based program to improve outcomes for children and make communities safer, despite formidable opposition from Upstate Republican legislators in whose districts the majority of juvenile jails were located and the employees who worked in these facilities.

Empty Beds, Wasted Dollars campaign generated more than 300 newspaper, magazine, television, radio and online story and op-ed placements and 30 editorials in fewer than three years.&lt;ref&gt;http://ccf.ny.gov/files/1813/8074/4718/EmptyBeds.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely-credited with creating the political capital needed to close more than half the state's juvenile jails where children in custody had been maltreated by state employees and where an emotionally disturbed 15-year-old boy was killed in 2006, when two state workers sat on him until he stopped breathing.&lt;ref&gt;https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6DF1130F936A1575BC0A96F9C8B63&amp;scp=9&amp;sq=darryl%20thompson&amp;st=cse&lt;/ref&gt; The success of this campaign provided Carrión the clout to advance reform of the state's child welfare and child care systems and improve overall child well-being across New York.

==History==
===Meetups===
On 16 July 2005, [[Beppe Grillo]] suggested through his blog that supporters adopt social networks, such as [[Meetup (website)|Meetup]], to communicate and coordinate local meetings. The first "40 Friends of Beppe Grillo" meetups began with the initial aim to "have fun, get together, share ideas and proposals for a better world, starting from one's own city, and discuss and develop my posts, if you believe them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://temi.repubblica.it/micromega-online/grillini-in-movimento/?printpage=undefined |title=micromega - micromega-online » Grillini in movimento - Versione stampabile |work=la Repubblica |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meetups featured thematic working groups on topics entitled "technology and innovation", "press-communication", "[[ethical consumerism]]", "currency study", "no incinerators" and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2012-05-22/nelle-proposte-provocazioni-anche-063747.shtml?uuid=Ab8McLgF |title=L'economia secondo i grillini: provocazioni, ma c'è anche buon senso |publisher=Il Sole 24 ORE |date= 22 May 2012 |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forli24ore.it/news/cesena/0022390-grillini-propongono-ritorno-alla-terra |title=I grillini propongono il 'ritorno alla terra' |publisher=Forli24ore.it |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; From these beginnings, Grillo was asked to stand in the October 2005 primaries for the selection of the prime ministerial candidate of the centre-left coalition, [[The Union (political coalition)|The Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=(m.o.) |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2005/08/04/il-guru-per-lanciarsi-ha-scelto.022e.html |title=E il guru per lanciarsi ha scelto 'Meet Up' - La Repubblica |language=it |work=la Repubblica |date=4 August 2005 |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On three occasions (17 December 2005 in Turin, 26 March 2006 in Piacenza, and 16 to 18 June 2006 in Sorrento), the representatives of the Friends of Beppe Grillo meetups held national meetings with Grillo, where proposals regarding environmental issues such as the replacement of polluting incinerators with systems applying mechanical-biological waste treatment were discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beppegrillo.it/2010/05/il_centro_di_riciclo_di_vedelago.html |title=Blog di Beppe Grillo - Nulla si crea, nulla si distrugge.Il centro di riciclo di Vedelago |publisher=Beppegrillo.it |accessdate=2013-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108044519/http://www.beppegrillo.it/2010/05/il_centro_di_riciclo_di_vedelago.html# |archive-date=8 November 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
During the fourth national meeting held in Genoa on 3 February 2007, Grillo announced his desire to provide an autonomous space during his touring shows for local meetup activists.

On 14 July 2007, some [[Civic List (Italy)|civic list]] representatives who participated in local elections the previous spring met in Parma to establish a national coordination between associations, movements, and organisations. They met to practise promoting and experimenting with [[direct democracy|direct]] and [[participatory democracy|participatory]] democracy and to share a document of intent, which included the establishment of proposals, repealing [[referendum|referenda]], the direct election of the [[Ombudsman]], the institution of [[participatory budgeting]], and a "bound" mandate for public administrators and open primaries.

===V-Days===
[[File:V-day bologna 02.jpg|thumb|220px|V-Day in [[Bologna]], 2007]]
On 14 June 2007, Grillo launched ''[[wiktionary:vaffanculo|Vaffanculo]] Day'' (Fuck-off Day), or V-Day, in Bologna. V-Day was meant to mobilize the collection of signatures to submit a [[Initiative|popular initiative]] seeking to introduce preferences in the current electoral law and to prevent parliamentary candidate nominations for the criminally convicted and those who have already completed two terms in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beppegrillo.it/2007/06/vaffanculoday.html |title=Blog di Beppe Grillo - Vaffanculo-Day |publisher=Beppegrillo.it |date=14 June 2007 |accessdate=2013-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117171305/http://www.beppegrillo.it/2007/06/vaffanculoday.html# |archive-date=17 January 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The name V-Day was chosen to reflect four references. The first refers to the [[Normandy landings]] of the Allies in [[Normandy]] during [[World War II]] in order to symbolise how Italian citizens would "invade" bad policy. The second refers to the [[motion picture]] and graphic novel ''[[V for Vendetta (film)|V for Vendetta]]'' which the Five Stars Movement frequently relates with its principles of political renewal (the logo of the movement borrows the V symbol from the franchise). The third refers to the interjection "Fuck you" directed at bad policy. The fourth is a reference to the Roman numeral for five.

V-Day, which continued the "Clean Parliament" initiative promoted by Grillo since 2006, took place in many Italian cities on 8 September 2007 to evoke the state of confusion caused by the [[Badoglio Proclamation]] on 8 September 1943. On that day, 336,000 signatures were collected, far exceeding the 50,000 required to file a popular initiative law. For the occasion, [[Michele Serra]] coined the term ''grillismo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2007/08/sezioni/cronaca/grillo-v-day/serra-commento/serra-commento.html?ref=search |title=La piazza di Grillo tra politica e populismo - cronaca |work=la Repubblica |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
V2-Day was organised for 25 April 2008, a second day of action aimed at collecting signatures for three referenda. On 29 and 30 September 2007 in Lucca, several members of the meetups and local civic lists, in the initial wake of the discussions started on the net and in the wake of the previous meeting of Perugia, defined the policies for the establishment of civic lists. On 10 October 2007, Grillo gave guidance on how to create the civic lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beppegrillo.it/2007/10/liste_civiche1.html |title=Blog di Beppe Grillo - Liste civiche/1 |publisher=Beppegrillo.it |date=14 October 2007 |accessdate=2013-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110035944/http://www.beppegrillo.it/2007/10/liste_civiche1.html# |archive-date=10 November 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Five Star Civic Lists ===
On 3 December 2008, Grillo presented the symbol of the Five Star Civic Lists for the 2009 local elections. The logo in the "V" of "citizenship" is a reference to V-Day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beppegrillo.it/2008/12/liste_civiche_a.html |title=Blog di Beppe Grillo - Liste Civiche a Cinque Stelle |publisher=Beppegrillo.it |date=3 December 2008 |accessdate=2013-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117134445/http://www.beppegrillo.it/2008/12/liste_civiche_a.html# |archive-date=17 January 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 February 2009 in Bologna, a gathering of civic lists discussed the future of the movement and the coming elections. In particular, Sonia Alfano consulted with the activist base of the movement about her possible candidacy for the [[European Parliament]] as an independent candidate with the [[Italy of Values]] list.
 
On 8 March 2009, the first national meeting of the Five Star Civic Lists was held in [[Florence]]. Here, Grillo presented the ''Charter of Florence'', a 12-point program of the various local civic lists in the afternoon. About twenty local groups presented their ideas and experiences. In April, Grillo announced he had received a letter from [[Nobel Prize]] winner in economics [[Joseph Stiglitz]] in which he declared he would look carefully at the experience of local civic lists promoted through the blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beppegrillo.it/2009/04/stiglitz_e_le_l.html |title=Blog di Beppe Grillo - Stiglitz e Le Liste Civiche |publisher=Beppegrillo.it |date=15 April 2009 |accessdate=2013-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130227044700/http://www.beppegrillo.it/2009/04/stiglitz_e_le_l.html# |archive-date=27 February 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On 29 March 2009, Grillo announced that in the upcoming European elections he would support [[Luigi de Magistris (mayor)|Luigi de Magistris]] and Sonia Alfano (figures close to the movement) as independent candidates in the lists of Italy of Values, together with the journalist Carlo Vulpio (also close to the movement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/marzo/19/Magistris_politica_dico_addio_alla_co_9_090319025.shtml |title=De Magistris in politica: dico addio alla toga |work=Corriere della Sera |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 June, De Magistris and Alfano, candidates in all five constituencies, were elected to the European Parliament, resulting in the first and second preferences (of 419 000 and 143 000). In the same election, as stated by Beppe Grillo, 23 councilors were elected from the Five Star Civic Lists, especially in the municipalities of [[Emilia-Romagna]] in central Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beppegrillo.it/2009/07/comunicato_poli_15.html |title=Blog di Beppe Grillo - Comunicato politico numero ventitre |publisher=Beppegrillo.it |date=4 July 2009 |accessdate=2013-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405120545/http://www.beppegrillo.it/2009/07/comunicato_poli_15.html# |archive-date=5 April 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 2009, the launch of the National Five Star Movement, inspired by the ideologies of the ''Charter of Florence'', was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beppegrillo.it/2009/09/comunicato_politico_numero_venticinque.html |title=Blog di Beppe Grillo - Comunicato politico numero venticinque |publisher=Beppegrillo.it |accessdate=2013-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702055458/http://www.beppegrillo.it/2009/09/comunicato_politico_numero_venticinque.html# |archive-date=2 July 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;''

Along with [[Gianroberto Casaleggio]], on 4 October 2009, Grillo declared the birth of the Five Star Movement and presented a programme at the Emerald Theatre in [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.corriere.it/politica/12_maggio_30/casaleggio-regole-mov-5-stelle_9e8eca9c-aa1a-11e1-8196-b3ccb09a7f99.shtml Casaleggio: «Ho scritto io le regole del Movimento 5 Stelle]".

=== 2018 general election ===
In the [[Italian general election, 2018|2018 general election]] held on 4 March 2018, neither of the three main groupings (the M5S, the [[centre-right coalition]] and the Democratic Party-led [[centre-left coalition|centre-left]]) won a majority of seats in Parliament, although the M5S became the largest individual party, with 32.7% of the vote and 227 seats in the Chamber. In May, the M5S entered into coalition talks with the [[Lega Nord]]. The talks resulted in the proposal for a so-called [[Government of Change]] under the leadership of [[Giuseppe Conte]], a law professor close to the M5S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansa.it/english/news/2018/05/23/conte-says-to-be-italians-defence-lawyer-in-govt-of-change_3294ff64-f175-4f2d-8323-c775d270645c.html|title=Conte says to be Italians' defence lawyer in govt of change - English|date=23 May 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of the cabinet initially failed on 27 May as [[President of Italy|President]] [[Sergio Mattarella]] did not agree on the appointment of [[Paolo Savona]] as Minister of Economy and Finances due to his perceived [[Euroscepticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansa.it/english/news/politics/2018/05/27/mattarella-meets-conte-vetoed-savona_48b12bb2-f239-462d-83db-fca1f68d70b6.html|title=Mattarella meets Conte, 'vetoed' Savona - English|date=27 May 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansa.it/english/news/politics/2018/05/27/conte-drops-govt-bid_e9254d0f-03bd-4699-8599-8ec8edbcf626.html|title=Conte drops govt bid - English|date=27 May 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
In the M5S, themes derived from [[ecology|ecological]] and [[Particracy|anti-particracy]] promoting the [[E-democracy|direct participation]] of citizens converge in the management of public affairs through forms of digital democracy. The movement wants to be a "democratic encounter outside of party and associative ties and without the mediation of directive or representational organisms, recognising to all users of the [[Internet]] the role of government and direction that is normally attributed to a few".&lt;ref name=utopia&gt;[http://www.beppegrillo.it/en/2011/06/the_5_star_movement_between_ut.html The 5 Star MoVement between Utopia and reality] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928170523/http://www.beppegrillo.it/en/2011/06/the_5_star_movement_between_ut.html# |date=28 September 2017 }}.

===Direct democracy===
The movement bases its principles on [[direct democracy]] as an evolution of [[representative democracy]]. The idea is that citizens will no longer delegate their power to parties (considered old and corrupted intermediates between the state and themselves) that serve the interests of lobby groups and financial powers. They will succeed only by creating a collective intelligence made possible by the Internet.&lt;ref name="utopia"/&gt;

In order to go in this direction, the M5S chose its Italian and European parliamentary candidates through online voting by registered members of Beppe Grillo's blog.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-20643620 Italy's Five Star protest party makes waves].

===Politics is not a career===
One of the most important rules of M5S is that politics is a temporary service: no one who has already been elected twice at any level (local or national) can be a candidate again and has to return to their original job.&lt;ref name="utopia"/&gt; Another feature of the movement is the so-called "zero-cost politics",&lt;ref name="Zero-Cost Politics"/&gt; according to which politics must not become a career and way to make money.

===Same-sex marriage===
On 15 July 2012, Grillo publicly expressed his support for [[same-sex marriage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilmattino.it/articolo.php?id=208514&amp;sez=ITALIA |title=Articolo non trovato |work=Il Mattino |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the subject was discussed in the National Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Redazione |url=http://www.ilsussidiario.net/News/Politica/2012/7/14/ASSEMBLEA-PD-Il-partito-si-spacca-sui-matrimoni-gay-Bindi-contro-Concia/302133/ |title=ASSEMBLEA PD/ Il partito si spacca sui matrimoni gay, Bindi contro Concia |publisher=Ilsussidiario.net |date=14 July 2012 |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In offering his support to marriage between homosexual citizens, Grillo broke his silence on the subject.

===No alliances===
Grillo's campaign has an unwillingness to form alliances as a result of his refusal to be associated or characterised like any of the older political families including the [[Centre-left coalition|centre-left]] and [[Centre-right coalition|centre-right]]. As the government itself is made up of both centre-left and centre-right parties, the M5S has had difficulties coming to an agreement with any of the other parties. Despite the different views within the party, the issues on which the movement agrees keep the party intact through advocating the main five principles of the M5S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bordignon &amp; Ceccarini|first1=Fabio &amp; Luigi|title=The Five-Star Movement: a hybrid actor in the net of state institutions|journal=Journal of Modern Italian Studies|volume=20|issue=4|pages=454–473|doi=10.1080/1354571X.2015.1066112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Tecné poll in the aftermath of the [[Italian general election, 2018|2018 Italian general election]] suggested that 56% of M5S voters preferred a government coalition between M5S and [[Lega Nord]]. A coalition between the M5S and the [[centre-right coalition]] as a whole was preferred by only 4%. 22% preferred a coalition between the M5S, the [[centre-left coalition]] led by the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] along with the hard-left [[Free and Equal (Italy)|Free and Equal]]. A technocratic government was only supported by 1% of the M5S's voters.&lt;ref&gt;Tecné s.r.l., Gli scenari all'indomani delle elezioni politiche.

===Immigration===
The M5S's position on immigration has been ambiguous, but Grillo wrote in his blog on 23 December 2016 that all illegal immigrants should be expelled from Italy, that [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] should be temporarily suspended in the event of a terrorist attack until the threat has been removed, and that there should be revision of the [[Dublin Regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansa.it/english/news/politics/2016/12/23/grillo-calls-for-mass-deportations-2_c2583737-0f97-4157-a2f3-d2a9137728b6.html | title=Grillo calls for mass deportations|accessdate=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2016/12/23/grillo-terrorismo-migrant_n_13813082.html |title=Beppe Grillo chiede 4 misure per proteggere l'Italia dal "viavai dei terroristi".

=== Vaccination ===
The Five-Star Movement has strong links to anti-vaccination activists, and party leaders have called for rolling back mandatory vaccination laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2017/05/03/news/vaccini_grillo_pretende_scuse_nyt_bufala_nostra_campagna_contro_ma_la_rete_si_scatena-164511716/ Tutte le volte del Movimento 5 Stelle contro i vaccini, la Rete smentisce Grillo] repubblica.it. 3 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/afd472be-996c-11e8-9702-5946bae86e6d|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European affiliation===
About the politics of the [[European Union]] and the [[Euro]], the M5S has often been highly critical, but like on other issues its position is ambiguous. On 12 June 2014, the M5S having been rejected by both the Greens/EFA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nielsen |first=Nikolaj |url=http://euobserver.com/eu-elections/124495 |title=EUobserver / Greens reject Beppe Grillo's offer to team up |publisher=Euobserver.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ALDE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alde.eu/nc/press/press-and-release-news/press-release/article/alde-response-to-the-seven-conditions-of-the-movimento-5-stelle-43004/ |title=Press Release |publisher=Alde.eu |date=2014-01-27 |accessdate=2014-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129103727/http://www.alde.eu/nc/press/press-and-release-news/press-release/article/alde-response-to-the-seven-conditions-of-the-movimento-5-stelle-43004/ |archivedate=29 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; European Parliament groups, offered its activists a limited-choice online referendum to choose a group for the party. 78% of participating activists voted for the Eurosceptic EFDD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Altri articoli dalla categoria &amp;raquo; |url=http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2014/06/12/news/m5s_blog_grillo_si_vota_su_alleanze_ue-88731934/ |title=Alleanze in Europa, il M5S sceglie l'Ukip di Farage.

On January 2017, the M5S tried to change its group inside the European Parliament, moving from the EFDD to the ALDE. Despite an initial agreement, ALDE leader [[Guy Verhofstadt]] refused the M5S' adhesion to the group due to insufficient guarantees to come to a common position on European integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2017/01/09/news/m5s_europarlamento_alde-155680742/|title=M5s, Parlamento Ue: salta il passaggio a eurogruppo Alde.

In December 2017, the M5S electoral leader Luigi Di Maio stated that he supported a referendum for Italy to leave the [[Eurozone]] and would vote to leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zapperi|first=Cesare|url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/17_dicembre_18/di-maio-renzi-euro-scontro-referendum-7d355ba8-e3fe-11e7-8530-b320f0c560cc.shtml|title=M5S, Di Maio: voterei per l’uscita dall’euro.

Since 2007, Grillo has criticized the cost of politics by supporting the reduction of payment for [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|deputies]] and [[Senate of the Republic (Italy)|senators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beppegrillo.it/movimento/codice_comportamento_parlamentare.php |title=MoVimento |publisher=Beppegrillo.it |accessdate=2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this policy, the benefits received by members of parliament would not exceed €5,000 gross per month, with any surplus returned to the state with solidarity allowance (also called end-term). However, according to the regional director of the M5S, Giovanni Favia, the deduction of €5,000 gross salary of parliamentarians is contrary to the principles of the movement as it would result in a reduction of only €2,500 net. In an interview published in several newspapers in November 2012, Favia estimated at €11,000 per month the fees prescribed for a member of M5S. The article does not explain how Favia got to deduct that amount because it necessarily includes reimbursements and per diem is not flat as costs and expenses which vary from member to member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Redazione Il Fatto Quotidiano |url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2012/11/27/stipendi-5-stelle-favia-critica-grillo-tagli-irrisori-per-nostri-deputati-3000-euro/428510/ |title=Stipendi 5 Stelle, Favia critica Grillo: "Tagli irrisori, 3000 euro di stipendio bastano" |work=Il Fatto Quotidiano |accessdate=2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Galician Socialist Union''' (USG, ''Unión Socialista Galega'' in [[Galician language]]) was a [[Galician nationalism|Galician nationalist]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] party founded in August 1932 by [[Xohán Xesús González]] a prominent militant of the [[Unión General de Trabajadores|UGT]] and a member of the Seminary of Socialist Studies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.galizalivre.org/?q=noticia/22.11.2011/entrevista-h-itor-picalho-arredor-da-figura-de-joh-m-jesus-gon-ales-1-parte&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1936 several of the party members were killed by the [[Francoism|Francoist]] forces, including almost all their leadership. The USG was the historical and ideological antecedent of the [[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[Galician nationalism|Galician nationalist]] parties that appeared in [[Galiza]] in the 60s. A lot of the USG members were supporters of the [[independence]] of [[Galiza]], including their leader [[Xohán Xesús González]].&lt;ref&gt;Beramendi, J e Núñez Seixas, ''O Nacionalismo Galego'', Edicións [[A Nosa Terra]], [[Vigo]], 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory became a point of reference for [[Romantic nationalism|nationalists]], as well as a catalyst for various Romanian forces to achieve a single Romanian state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Giurescu | first = Constantin C. | authorlink = Constantin C.

The [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|Romanian revolution]] in 1848 already carried the seeds of the national dream of a unified and united Romania,&lt;ref name="Ivan T.

The [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)]] was signed between [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] on 4 ([[Old Style]])/17 ([[New Style]]) August 1916 in [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref name=Kiritescu&gt;[[Constantin Kirițescu]], "''Istoria războiului pentru întregirea României: 1916-1919''", 1922, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty stipulated the conditions under which Romania agreed to join the war on the side of the Entente, particularly territorial promises in [[Austria-Hungary]]. The signatories bound themselves to keep secret the contents of the treaty until a general peace was concluded.

''Romanians!''

''The war which for the last two years has been encircling our frontiers more and more closely has shaken the ancient foundations of Europe to their depths.

''It has brought the day which has been awaited for centuries by the national conscience, by the founders of the Romanian State, by those who united the principalities in the war of independence, by those responsible for the national renaissance.''

''It is the day of the union of all branches of our nation.  Today we are able to complete the task of our forefathers and to establish forever that which Michael the Great was only able to establish for a moment, namely, a Romanian union on both slopes of the Carpathians.''

''For us the mountains and plains of Bukowina, where Stephen the Great has slept for centuries.  In our moral energy and our valour lie the means of giving him back his birthright of a great and free Rumania from the Tisza to the Black Sea, and to prosper in peace in accordance with our customs and our hopes and dreams.''

===Interwar Romania===
[[File:GreaterRomaniaHistoricRegions.png|thumb|right|250px|Regions of the Kingdom of Romania (1918–1940)]]
The concept of ''"Greater Romania"'' materialized as a geopolitical reality after the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name="Berteanu"/&gt; Romania gained control over [[Bessarabia]], [[Bukovina]] and [[Transylvania]]. The borders established by the treaties concluding the war did not change until 1940. The resulting state, often referred to as "România Mare" or, alternatively, as {{lang-ro|România Întregită}} (roughly translated in English as "Romania Made Whole," or "Entire Romania"), was seen as the 'true', ''whole'' Romanian state, or, as Tom Gallagher states, the "[[Holy Grail]] of [[National awakening of Romania|Romanian nationalism]]".&lt;ref name="Gallagher" &gt;{{cite book |author=Gallagher, Tom | title= Modern Romania: the end of communism, the failure of democratic reform, and the theft of a nation | publisher= [[New York University Press]] | location=New York |year= 2005 | page= 28 | isbn= 0-8147-3172-4 | oclc= | doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its constitution, proclaimed in 1923, "largely ignored the new ethnic and cultural realities".&lt;ref name="Hitchins"&gt;Keith Hitchins, [https://books.google.com/books?id=j1ytAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+Concise+History+of+Romania++By+Keith+Hitchins&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bJZqU7vUCOWuyQHRwYDoBA&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20Concise%20History%20of%20Romania%20%20By%20Keith%20Hitchins&amp;f=false A Concise History of Romania], Cambridge University Press, 2014, p. 183, {{ISBN|9781107782709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romanian ideology changed due to the demographic, cultural and social alterations, however the nationalist desire for a homogeneous Romanian state conflicted with the multiethnic, multicultural truth of Greater Romania.&lt;ref name="Livezeanu"/&gt; The ideological rewriting of the role of ''"spiritual victimization"'', turning it into ''"spiritual police''", was a radical and challenging task for the Romanian intellectuals because they had to entirely revise the national identity and the destiny of the Romanian nation.&lt;ref name="icr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icr.ro/bucharest/identity-and-destiny-ideas-and-ideology-in-interwar-romania-29-2007/ideas-and-ideology-in-interwar-romania.html |title=Ideas And Ideology In Interwar Romania|publisher=www.icr.ro |year=2007 |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with this view, Livezeanu states that the [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|Great Union]] created a ''"deeply fragmented"'' interwar Romania where the determination of national identity met with great difficulties mainly because of the effects of the hundred years of political separation.&lt;ref name="Conflicted Memories"&gt;Konrad Hugo Jarausch, Thomas Lindenberger, Annelie Ramsbrock, [https://books.google.com/books?id=k6rwRi-5UqQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Conflicted+Memories:+Europeanizing+Contemporary+Histories&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kbZ5U5eDHceyPPzSgLAH&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Conflicted%20Memories%3A%20Europeanizing%20Contemporary%20Histories&amp;f=false Conflicted Memories: Europeanizing Contemporary Histories], Berghahn Books, 2007, pp. 39-42&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the inability of the government to solve the problems of the Transylvanian Romanians' integration and the effects of the [[Great Depression|worldwide economic depression]] ''"the population gradually lost its faith in the democratic conception of Greater Romania"''.&lt;ref name="Kührer-Wielach, Florian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://othes.univie.ac.at/28458/ |title=Siebenbürgen ohne Siebenbürger? |publisher=University of Vienna |year=2013 |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Japan]] recognized the incorporation of Bessarabia through the [[Treaty of Paris (1920)|Treaty of Paris]]. The [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] however refused to do so, the latter maintaining a claim to the territory for the whole interwar period. Furthermore, Japan failed to ratify the treaty, which therefore never entered into force.

===World War II losses===
[[File:Romania 1930 ethnic map EN.png|thumb|250px|Ethnic map of interwar Romania ([[Demographic history of Romania#29 December 1930 census|1930 Romanian Census]])]]
{{Main|Romania during World War II}}
In 1940, the Romanian state agreed to cede Bessarabia to the [[Soviet Union]], as provided for by the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop pact]] between the Soviet Union and [[Germany]]. It also lost Northern Bukovina and the [[Herța region]], which were not mentioned in the pact, to the Soviet Union. It lost [[Northern Transylvania]] to Hungary, through the [[Second Vienna Award]], and the [[Southern Dobruja]] to Bulgaria by the [[Treaty of Craiova]]. In the course of World War II, Romania, which was allied with the [[Axis Powers]], not only re-annexed Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, but also took under administrative control lands to the east of Dniester (parts of recently formed [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavian SSR]], and of [[Odessa Oblast|Odessa]] and [[Vinnytsia Oblast|Vinnytsia]] oblasts of [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]]), creating [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria Governorate]]. [[File:RECENSAMANT 1941 JUDETE.png|thumb|250px|Population structure in Romania (Transnistria Governorate included) according to the 1941 census.]]Despite clear Ukrainian majority in the governorate's ethnic composition, demonstrated by census conducted in December 1941, Romanian government hoped to annex it eventually as a "compensation" for [[Northern Transylvania]] lost to [[Hungary]].

These territories were lost again when the tide of the war turned. After the war, Romania regained the Transylvanian territories lost to Hungary, but not territory lost to Bulgaria or the Soviet Union. In 1948 a treaty between the Soviet Union and Soviet-occupied [[Communist Romania]] also provided for the transfer of four uninhabited islands to the Soviet Union, three in the [[Danube Delta]] and [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|Snake Island]] in the [[Black Sea]].

===After World War II===

After the war, the concept was interpreted as "obsolete" because of the Romanian defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard A.

The fall of the socialist regimes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and the economic downturn accompanying it led to a resurgence of nationalism in the region. Romania and Moldova, state comprising the bulk of Bessarabia which had become independent after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, confronted with their eastern neighbor, [[Ukraine]]. Bucharest and [[Chișinău]] announced territorial claims on Ukrainian lands (on parts of [[Chernivtsi Oblast|Chernivtsi]] and [[Odessa Oblast|Odessa]] regions).&lt;ref&gt;Bohdan Nahaylo, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iPCPxwubpYUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Ukrainian+Resurgence&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xvN5U4jhMtSM7AbIroDoBw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Ukrainian%20Resurgence&amp;f=false The Ukrainian Resurgence], C.

In 1992, the issue on unification of [[Moldova]] and Romania was negotiated between Romanian and Moldovan governments and they wanted to achieve it until the end of the year.&lt;ref name="Moldova - Narrative"/&gt; However, the "unionists" lost their dominance in Moldova in the middle of the year.&lt;ref name="Moldova - Narrative"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/ir/cews/database/Moldova/moldova.pdf |title=Ideas And Ideology In Interwar Romania|publisher=University of Southern California|date= |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bucharest]] admitted the existence of the two Romanian states (Romania and Moldova) and defined priorities in reference to this matter: ''"the creation of a common cultural space; the creation of an economically integrated zone; and gradual political integration"''.&lt;ref name="Arbatov"&gt;Alekseĭ Georgievich Arbatov, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ArKtx7XsMHAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Managing+Conflict+in+the+Former+Soviet+Union:+Russian+and+American+Perspectives&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Tfh5U8iTHYe4O8fFgegJ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Managing%20Conflict%20in%20the%20Former%20Soviet%20Union%3A%20Russian%20and%20American%20Perspectives&amp;f=false Managing Conflict in the Former Soviet Union: Russian and American Perspectives], MIT Press, 1997, pp. 202-204&lt;/ref&gt; The Moldovan [[Mircea Snegur|Snegur]] government became more pragmatic and realized that the nationalist propaganda from Bucharest did not help their aims especially on the problem of "Soviet annexed Bessarabia".&lt;ref name="Arbatov"/&gt; The Romanian organizations ignored the result of the [[Moldovan referendum, 1994|Moldovan referendum on independence]] because the referendum did not ask Romanians in Romania.&lt;ref name="Arbatov"/&gt; Romanian politicians blamed [[Russia]] and the Moldovan regime that unification became unreal.&lt;ref name="Arbatov"/&gt; According to Edward Ozhiganov (Head of the Division for Ethnopolitical Research at the Analytical Center of the Federation Council in Russia), the armed conflict in Moldova was due to the Romanian ethnic nationalism, in other words, ''"the attempt to create a unitary, ethnic state with power concentrated in the hands of ethnic nationalists in what was actually a multiethnic society."''&lt;ref name="Arbatov"/&gt;

Bucharest's behavior toward Ukraine did not change until 1997 when Romanian politicians realized that resolving border disputes were a precondition for [[NATO]] membership.&lt;ref&gt;Marta Dyczok, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iTX_AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=%22ukraine%27s+only+western+neighbour%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=opt7U4LwD8Sy7Abr14G4Ag&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ukraine's%20only%20western%20neighbour%22&amp;f=false Ukraine: Movement Without Change, Change Without Movement], Routledge, 2013, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Group Risk Protection''' ('''GRP''') is a form of [[crop insurance]] available in certain parts of the [[United States]] that makes an [[Indemnity|indemnity payment]] to all participating crop farmers in a particular area when the entire county’s crop production is a certain percentage below the normal production level of the county. This differs from the basic crop insurance program that makes payments to participating farmers when the individual farmer’s own crop yield is less than the producer’s normal yield.

'''Jacques-Louis David''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒaklwi david|lang}}; 30 August 1748 – 29 December 1825) was a French painter in the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] style, considered to be the preeminent painter of the era. In the 1780s his cerebral brand of [[history painting]] marked a change in taste away from [[Rococo]] frivolity toward classical austerity and severity and heightened feeling,&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew Collings]]. {{cite episode

David later became an active supporter of the [[French Revolution]] and friend of [[Maximilien Robespierre]] (1758–1794), and was effectively a dictator of the arts under the [[French First Republic|French Republic]]. Imprisoned after Robespierre's fall from power, he aligned himself with yet another political regime upon his release: that of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], The First Consul of France. At this time he developed his [[Empire style]], notable for its use of warm [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian]] colours. After Napoleon's fall from Imperial power and the Bourbon revival, David exiled himself to [[Brussels]], then in the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], where he remained until his death. David had [[:Category:Pupils of Jacques-Louis David|a large number of pupils]], making him the strongest influence in French art of the early 19th century, especially academic [[Paris Salon|Salon]] painting.

==Early life==
Jacques-Louis David was born into a prosperous family in Paris on 30 August 1748. When he was about nine his father was killed in a duel and his mother left him with his well-off architect uncles. They saw to it that he received an excellent education at the [[Collège des Quatre-Nations]], [[University of Paris]], but he was never a good student-- he had a facial tumor that impeded his speech, and he was always preoccupied with drawing. He covered his notebooks with drawings, and he once said, "I was always hiding behind the instructor's chair, drawing for the duration of the class". Soon, he desired to be a painter, but his uncles and mother wanted him to be an architect. He overcame the opposition, and went to learn from [[François Boucher]] (1703–1770), the leading painter of the time, who was also a distant relative. Boucher was a [[Rococo]] painter, but tastes were changing, and the fashion for Rococo was giving way to a more classical style. Boucher decided that instead of taking over David's tutelage, he would send David to his friend, [[Joseph-Marie Vien]] (1716–1809), a painter who embraced the classical reaction to Rococo. There, David attended the [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture|Royal Academy]], based in what is now the [[Louvre]].
[[File:Mademoiselle Guimard as Terpsichore, by Jacques-Louis David.jpg|thumbnail|upright|''Mademoiselle Guimard as Terpsichore'', 1774–5, an early work]]
Each year the Academy awarded an outstanding student the prestigious [[Prix de Rome]], which funded a 3-5 year stay in the Eternal City. Since artists were now revisiting classical styles, the trip to Rome provided its winners the opportunity to study the remains of classical antiquity and the works of the Italian Renaissance masters at first hand. Each ''pensionnaire'' was lodged in the French Academy's Roman outpost, which from the years 1737 to 1793 was the Palazzo Mancini in the Via del Corso. David competed for, and failed to win, the prize for three consecutive years (with ''[[Minerva Fighting Mars]]'', ''[[Diana and Apollo Killing Niobe's Children]]'' and ''[[The Death of Seneca (David)|The Death of Seneca]]''). Each failure contributed to his lifelong grudge against the institution. After his second loss in 1772, David went on a hunger strike, which lasted two and a half days before the faculty encouraged him to continue painting. Confident he now had the support and backing needed to win the prize, he resumed his studies with great zeal—only to fail to win the Prix de Rome again the following year. Finally, in 1774, David was awarded the Prix de Rome on the strength of his painting of ''[[Erasistratus Discovering the Cause of Antiochus' Disease]]'', a subject set by the judges. In October 1775 he made the journey to Italy with his mentor, Joseph-Marie Vien, who had just been appointed director of the [[French Academy in Rome|French Academy at Rome]].&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;

While in Italy, David mostly studied the works of 17th-century masters such as [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]], [[Caravaggio]], and [[the Carracci]].&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; Although he declared, "the Antique will not seduce me, it lacks animation, it does not move",&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; David filled twelve sketchbooks with drawings that he and his studio used as model books for the rest of his life. He was introduced to the painter [[Raphael Mengs]] (1728–1779), who opposed the [[Rococo painting|Rococo]] tendency to sweeten and trivialize ancient subjects, advocating instead the rigorous study of classical sources and close adherence to ancient models. Mengs' principled, historicizing approach to the representation of classical subjects profoundly influenced David's pre-revolutionary painting, such as ''[[The Vestal Virgin (David)|The Vestal Virgin]]'', probably from the 1780s. Mengs also introduced David to the theoretical writings on ancient sculpture by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] (1717–1768), the German scholar held to be the founder of modern art history.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Potts, ''Flesh and the Ideal: Winckelmann and the Origins of Art History'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the Prix de Rome, David toured the newly excavated ruins of [[Pompeii]] in 1779, which deepened his belief that the persistence of classical culture was an index of its eternal conceptual and formal power. During the trip David also assiduously studied the High Renaissance painters, [[Raphael]] making a profound and lasting impression on the young French artist.

==Early work==

Although David's fellow students at the academy found him difficult to get along with, they recognized his genius. David's stay at the French Academy in Rome was extended by a year. In July 1780, he returned to Paris.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; There, he found people ready to use their influence for him, and he was made and official member of the Royal Academy. He sent the Academy two paintings, and both were included in the [[Paris Salon|Salon]] of 1781, a high honor. He was praised by his famous contemporary painters, but the administration of the Royal Academy was very hostile to this young upstart. After the Salon, the King granted David lodging in the Louvre, an ancient and much desired privilege of great artists. When the contractor of the King's buildings, M. Pécoul, was arranging with David, he asked the artist to marry his daughter, [[Marguerite Charlotte Pécoul|Marguerite Charlotte]]. This marriage brought him money and eventually four children. David had about 50 of his own pupils and was commissioned by the government to paint "''Horace defended by his Father''", but he soon decided, "''Only in Rome can I paint Romans.''" His father-in-law provided the money he needed for the trip, and David headed for Rome with his wife and three of his students, one of whom, [[Jean-Germain Drouais]] (1763–1788), was the Prix de Rome winner of that year.
[[File:Jacques-Louis David - Oath of the Horatii - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'' (second version; 1786)]]
In Rome, David painted his famous ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'', 1784. In this piece, the artist references [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] values while alluding to [[Rousseau]]'s social contract. The republican ideal of the general became the central focus of the painting with all three sons positioned in compliance with the father. The Oath between the characters can be read as an act of unification of men to the binding of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boime|1987|p=394}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of gender roles also becomes apparent in this piece, as the women in Horatii greatly contrast the group of brothers. David depicts the father with his back to the women, shutting them out of the oath. They also appear to be smaller in scale and physically isolated from the male figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boime|1987|p=399}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The masculine virility and discipline displayed by the men's rigid and confident stances is also severely contrasted to the slouching, swooning female softness created in the other half of the composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boime|1987|p=398}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Here we see the clear division of male-female attributes that confined the sexes to specific roles under Rousseau's popularized doctrine of "separate spheres".

These revolutionary ideals are also apparent in the ''[[Distribution of Eagles]]''. While ''Oath of the Horatii'' and ''[[The Tennis Court Oath (David)|The Tennis Court Oath]]'' stress the importance of masculine self-sacrifice for one's country and patriotism, the ''Distribution of Eagles'' would ask for self-sacrifice for one's Emperor ([[Napoleon]]) and the importance of battlefield glory.
[[File:David - The Death of Socrates.jpg|thumb|''[[The Death of Socrates]]'' (1787)]]

In 1787, David did not become the Director of the French Academy in Rome, which was a position he wanted dearly. The Count in charge of the appointments said David was too young, but said he would support him in 6 to 12 years. This situation would be one of many that would cause him to lash out at the Academy in years to come.

For the Salon of 1787, David exhibited his famous ''[[The Death of Socrates|Death of Socrates]]''. "Condemned to death, Socrates, strong, calm and at peace, discusses the immortality of the soul. Surrounded by Crito, his grieving friends and students, he is teaching, philosophizing, and in fact, thanking the God of Health, Asclepius, for the [[Conium|hemlock]] brew which will ensure a peaceful death... The wife of Socrates can be seen grieving alone outside the chamber, dismissed for her weakness. Plato is depicted as an old man seated at the end of the bed." Critics compared the Socrates with [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel|Sistine Ceiling]] and Raphael's Stanze, and one, after ten visits to the Salon, described it as "in every sense perfect". [[Denis Diderot]] said it looked like he copied it from some ancient [[bas-relief]]. The painting was very much in tune with the political climate at the time. For this painting, David was not honored by a royal "works of encouragement".

[[File:David Brutus.jpg|thumb|''[[The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons]]'' (1789)]]

For his next painting, David created ''[[The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons]]''. The work had tremendous appeal for the time. Before the opening of the Salon, the [[French Revolution]] had begun. The [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] had been established, and the [[Bastille]] had fallen. The royal court did not want propaganda agitating the people, so all paintings had to be checked before being hung. David's [[Portrait of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and his wife|portrait of Lavoisier]], who was a chemist and physicist as well as an active member of the Jacobin party, was banned by the authorities for such reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|1977|p=72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When the newspapers reported that the government had not allowed the showing of ''The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons'', the people were outraged, and the royals were forced to give in. The painting was hung in the exhibition, protected by art students. The painting depicts [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], the Roman leader, grieving for his sons. Brutus's sons had attempted to overthrow the government and restore the monarchy, so the father ordered their death to maintain the republic. Brutus was the heroic defender of the republic, sacrificing his own family for the good of the republic. On the right, the mother holds her two daughters, and the nurse is seen on the far right, in anguish. Brutus sits on the left, alone, brooding, seemingly dismissing the dead bodies of his sons. Knowing what he did was best for his country, but the tense posture of his feet and toes reveals his inner turmoil. The whole painting was a Republican symbol, and obviously had immense meaning during these times in France. It exemplified civic virtue, a value highly regarded during the Revolution.

==The French Revolution==
In the beginning, David was a supporter of the Revolution, a friend of [[Robespierre]], and a member of the [[Jacobin Club]]. While others were leaving the country for new and greater opportunities, David stayed behind to help destroy the old order; he was a regicide who voted in the National Convention for the Execution of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]. It is uncertain why he did this,{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} as there were many more opportunities for him under the King than the new order; some people suggest David's love for the classical made him embrace everything about that period, including a republican government.
 
Others believed that they found the key to the artist's revolutionary career in his personality. Undoubtedly, David's artistic sensibility, mercurial temperament, volatile emotions, ardent enthusiasm, and fierce independence might have been expected to help turn him against the established order but they did not fully explain his devotion to the republican regime. Nor did the vague statements of those who insisted upon his "powerful ambition...and unusual energy of will" actually account for his revolutionary connections. Those who knew him maintained that "generous ardor", high-minded idealism and well-meaning though sometimes fanatical enthusiasm, rather than opportunism and jealousy, motivated his activities during this period.

Soon, David turned his critical sights on the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. This attack was probably caused primarily by the hypocrisy of the organization and their personal opposition against his work, as seen in previous episodes in David's life. The Royal Academy was controlled by royalists, who opposed David's attempts at reform; so the National Assembly finally ordered it to make changes to conform to the new constitution.

David then began work on something that would later hound him: propaganda for the new republic. David's painting of Brutus was shown during the play ''[[Brutus (tragedy)|Brutus]]'' by [[Voltaire]].

In 1789, Jacques-Louis David attempted to leave his artistic mark on the historical beginnings of the French Revolution with his painting of ''[[Tennis Court Oath|The Oath of the Tennis Court]]''. David undertook this task not out of personal political conviction but rather because he was commissioned to do so. The painting was meant to commemorate the event of the same name but was never completed. A meeting of the Estates General was convened in May to address reforms of the monarchy. Dissent arose over whether the three estates would meet separately, as had been tradition, or as one body. The King's acquiescence with the demands of the upper orders led to the deputies of the Third Estate renaming themselves as the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] on 17 June. They were locked out of the meeting hall three days later when they attempted to meet, and forced to reconvene to the royal indoor tennis court. Presided over by [[Jean-Sylvain Bailly]], they made a 'solemn oath never to separate' until a national constitution had been created. In 1789 this event was seen as a symbol of the national unity against the ''[[Ancien Régime|ancien regime]]''. Rejecting the current conditions, the oath signified a new transition in human history and ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Warren|title=Jaques-Louis David and Jean-Louis Prieur revolutionary artists : the public, the populace, and images of the French revolution|date=2000|publisher=State university of New York press|location=New York|isbn=0791442888|pages=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; David was enlisted by the Society of Friends of the Constitution, the body that would eventually form the Jacobins, to enshrine this symbolic event.&lt;ref name="Crow 2007"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crow|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This instance is notable in more ways than one because it eventually led David to finally become involved in politics as he joined the Jacobins. The picture was meant to be massive in scale; the figures in the foreground were to be life-sized portraits of the counterparts, including [[Jean-Sylvain Bailly]], the President of the Constituent Assembly. Seeking additional funding, David turned to the Society of Friends of the Constitution. The funding for the project was to come from over three thousand subscribers hoping to receive a print of the image. However, when the funding was insufficient, the state ended up financing the project.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;Lee, Simon. "David, Jacques-Louis." Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. 14 Nov 2014.&lt;http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T021541&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

David set out in 1790 to transform the contemporary event into a major historical picture which would appear at the Salon of 1791 as a large pen-and-ink drawing. As in the ''Oath of the Horatii'', David represents the unity of men in the service of a patriotic ideal. The outstretched arms which are prominent in both works betray David's deeply held belief that acts of republican virtue akin to those of the Romans were being played out in France. In what was essentially an act of intellect and reason, David creates an air of drama in this work. The very power of the people appears to be "blowing" through the scene with the stormy weather, in a sense alluding to the storm that would be the revolution.

Symbolism in this work of art closely represents the revolutionary events taking place at the time. The figure in the middle is raising his right arm making the oath that they will never disband until they have reached their goal of creating a "constitution of the realm fixed upon solid foundations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bordes|2005|p=??}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of this symbol is highlighted by the fact that the crowd's arms are angled to his hand forming a triangular shape. Additionally, the open space in the top half contrasted to the commotion in the lower half serves to emphasize the magnitude of the [[Tennis Court Oath]].
[[File:Le Serment du Jeu de paume.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing by Jacques-Louis David of the Tennis Court Oath. David later became a deputy in the [[National Convention]] in 1792 ]]
In his attempt to depict political events of the Revolution in "real time", David was venturing down a new and untrodden path in the art world. However, [[Thomas E. Crow|Thomas Crow]] argues that this path "proved to be less a way forward than a cul-de-sac for history painting."&lt;ref name="Crow 2007"/&gt;   Essentially, the history of the demise of David's ''The Tennis Court Oath'' illustrates the difficulty of creating works of art that portray current and controversial political occurrences.  Political circumstances in France proved too volatile to allow the completion of the painting. The unity that was to be symbolized in ''The Tennis Court Oath'' no longer existed in radicalized 1792.  The National Assembly had split between conservatives and radical Jacobins, both vying for political power.  By 1792 there was no longer consensus that all the revolutionaries at the tennis court were "heroes".  A sizeable number of the heroes of 1789 had become the villains of 1792. In this unstable political climate David's work remained unfinished. With only a few nude figures sketched onto the massive canvas, David abandoned ''The Oath of the Tennis Court''. To have completed it would have been politically unsound. After this incident, when David attempted to make a political statement in his paintings, he returned to the less politically charged use of metaphor to convey his message.

When Voltaire died in 1778, the church denied him a church burial, and his body was interred near a monastery. A year later, Voltaire's old friends began a campaign to have his body buried in the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]], as church property had been confiscated by the French Government. In 1791, David was appointed to head the organizing committee for the ceremony, a parade through the streets of Paris to the Panthéon. Despite rain and opposition from conservatives due to the amount of money spent, the procession went ahead. Up to 100,000 people watched the "Father of the Revolution" being carried to his resting place. This was the first of many large festivals organized by David for the republic. He went on to organize festivals for martyrs that died fighting royalists. These funerals echoed the religious festivals of the pagan Greeks and Romans and are seen by many as Saturnalian.

[[File:Le représentant du peuple François en fonction2.jpg|right|thumb|Republican costume designed by David. Engraving by [[Dominique Vivant|Denon]].]]David incorporated many revolutionary symbols into these theatrical performances and orchestrated ceremonial rituals, in effect radicalizing the applied arts themselves. The most popular symbol for which David was responsible as propaganda minister was drawn from classical Greek images; changing and transforming them with contemporary politics. In an elaborate festival held on the anniversary of the revolt that brought the monarchy to its knees, David's Hercules figure was revealed in a procession following the [[Liberty (goddess)|Goddess of Liberty]] ([[Marianne]]). Liberty, the symbol of Enlightenment ideals was here being overturned by the Hercules symbol; that of strength and passion for the protection of the Republic against disunity and factionalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunt|2004|p=97}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech during the procession, David "explicitly emphasized the opposition between people and monarchy; Hercules was chosen, after all, to make this opposition more evident".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunt|2004|p=99}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ideals that David linked to his Hercules single-handedly transformed the figure from a sign of the old regime into a powerful new symbol of revolution. "David turned him into the representation of a collective, popular power. He took one of the favorite signs of monarchy and reproduced, elevated, and monumentalized it into the sign of its opposite."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunt|2004|p=103}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hercules, the image, became to the revolutionaries, something to rally around.

In June 1791, the King made an [[flight to Varennes|ill-fated attempt to flee the country]], but was apprehended short of his goal on the Austrian Netherlands border and was forced to return under guard to Paris. Louis XVI had made secret requests to [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold II of Austria]], Marie-Antoinette's brother, to restore him to his throne. This was granted and Austria threatened France if the royal couple were hurt. In reaction, the people arrested the King. This led to an Invasion after the trials and execution of Louis and Marie-Antoinette. The Bourbon monarchy was destroyed by the French people in 1792—it would be restored after Napoleon, then destroyed again with the Restoration of the House of Bonaparte. When the new National Convention held its first meeting, David was sitting with his friends [[Jean-Paul Marat]] and Robespierre. In the Convention, David soon earned a nickname "ferocious terrorist". Soon, Robespierre's agents discovered a secret vault of the king's proving he was trying to overthrow the government, and demanded his execution. The National Convention held the trial of Louis XVI and David voted for the death of the King, causing his wife, a royalist, to divorce him.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

When Louis XVI was executed on 21 January 1793, another man had already died as well—[[Louis Michel le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau]]. Le Peletier was killed on the preceding day by a royal bodyguard in revenge for having voted for the death of the King. David was called upon to organize a funeral, and he painted ''Le Peletier Assassinated''.  In it, the assassin's sword was seen hanging by a single strand of horsehair above Le Peletier's body, a concept inspired by the proverbial ancient tale of the sword of Damocles, which illustrated the insecurity of power and position. This underscored the courage displayed by Le Peletier and his companions in routing an oppressive king. The sword pierces a piece of paper on which is written "I vote the death of the tyrant", and as a tribute at the bottom right of the picture David placed the inscription "David to Le Peletier. 20 January 1793". The painting was later destroyed by Le Peletier's royalist daughter, and is known by only a drawing, an engraving, and contemporary accounts. Nevertheless, this work was important in David's career because it was the first completed painting of the French Revolution, made in less than three months, and a work through which he initiated the regeneration process that would continue with ''[[The Death of Marat]]'', David's masterpiece.

[[File:Jacques-Louis David - Marat assassinated - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|'' [[The Death of Marat]]'' (1793)]]

On 13 July 1793, David's friend Marat was assassinated by [[Charlotte Corday]] with a knife she had hidden in her clothing. She gained entrance to Marat's house on the pretense of presenting him a list of people who should be executed as enemies of France. Marat thanked her and said that they would be guillotined next week upon which Corday immediately fatally stabbed him. She was guillotined shortly thereafter. Corday was of an opposing political party, whose name can be seen in the note Marat holds in David's subsequent painting, ''[[The Death of Marat]]''. Marat, a member of the National Convention and a journalist, had a skin disease that caused him to itch horribly. The only relief he could get was in his bath over which he improvised a desk to write his list of suspect counter-revolutionaries who were to be quickly tried and, if convicted, guillotined. David once again organized a spectacular funeral, and Marat was buried in the Panthéon. Marat's body was to be placed upon a Roman bed, his wound displayed and his right arm extended holding the pen which he had used to defend the Republic and its people. This concept was to be complicated by the fact that the corpse had begun to putrefy. Marat's body had to be periodically sprinkled with water and vinegar as the public crowded to see his corpse prior to the funeral on 15 and 16 July. The stench became so bad however that the funeral had to be brought forward to the evening of 16 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schama|1989|p=83}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Death of Marat'', perhaps David's most famous painting, has been called the [[Pietà]] of the revolution. Upon presenting the painting to the convention, he said "Citizens, the people were again calling for their friend; their desolate voice was heard: David, take up your brushes.., avenge Marat... I heard the voice of the people. I obeyed."  David had to work quickly, but the result was a simple and powerful image.

''The Death of Marat'', 1793, became the leading image of the Terror and immortalized both Marat and David in the world of the revolution. This piece stands today as "a moving testimony to what can be achieved when an artist's political convictions are directly manifested in his work".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boime|1987|p=454}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A political martyr was instantly created as David portrayed Marat with all the marks of the real murder, in a fashion which greatly resembles that of Christ or his disciples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosenblum|1969|p=83}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The subject although realistically depicted remains lifeless in a rather supernatural composition. With the surrogate tombstone placed in front of him and the almost holy light cast upon the whole scene; alluding to an out of this world existence.  "Atheists though they were, David and Marat, like so many other fervent social reformers of the modern world, seem to have created a new kind of religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Janson|Rosenblum|1984|p=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the very center of these beliefs, there stood the republic.

[[File:Jacques-Louis David - Marie Antoinette on the Way to the Guillotine.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marie Antoinette]] on the Way to the [[Guillotine]], 16 October 1793. Sketched from a window in the rue Sainte-Honoré while the cart went past.]]

After the King's execution, war broke out between the new Republic and virtually every major power in Europe. David, as a member of the [[Committee of General Security]], contributed directly to the Reign of Terror.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boime|1987|p=442}}.&lt;/ref&gt; David organized his last festival: the festival of the Supreme Being. Robespierre had realized what a tremendous propaganda tool these festivals were, and he decided to create a new religion, mixing moral ideas with the Republic and based on the ideas of Rousseau. This process had already begun by confiscating church lands and requiring priests to take an oath to the state. The festivals, called fêtes, would be the method of indoctrination. On the appointed day, 20 Prairial by the [[French Republican Calendar|revolutionary calendar]], Robespierre spoke, descended steps, and with a torch presented to him by David, incinerated a cardboard image symbolizing atheism, revealing an image of wisdom underneath.

Soon, the war began to go well; French troops marched across the southern half of the Netherlands (which would later become Belgium), and the emergency that had placed the Committee of Public Safety in control was no more. Then plotters seized Robespierre at the National Convention and he was later guillotined, in effect ending the Reign of Terror. As Robespierre was arrested, David yelled to his friend "if you drink hemlock, I shall drink it with you."&lt;ref&gt;Carlyle, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; After this, he supposedly fell ill, and did not attend the evening session because of "stomach pain", which saved him from being guillotined along with Robespierre. David was arrested and placed in prison, first from 2 August to 28 December 1794 and then from 29 May to 3 August 1795.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; There he painted his own portrait, showing him much younger than he actually was, as well as that of his jailer.

==Post-revolution==
[[File:The Intervention of the Sabine Women.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Intervention of the Sabine Women]]'' (1799)]]
After David's wife visited him in jail, he conceived the idea of telling the story of [[The rape of the Sabine women]].  ''The Sabine Women Enforcing Peace by Running between the Combatants'', also called ''The Intervention of the Sabine Women'' is said to have been painted to honor his wife, with the theme being love prevailing over conflict. The painting was also seen as a plea for the people to reunite after the bloodshed of the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|pp=90–112}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

David conceived a new style for this painting, one which he called the "Pure Greek Style", as opposed to the "Roman style" of his earlier historical paintings. The new style was influenced heavily by the work of art historian [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]]. In David's words, "the most prominent general characteristics of the Greek masterpieces are a noble simplicity and silent greatness in pose as well as in expression."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|pp=90–115}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of the muscularity and angularity of the figures of his past works, these were more air-brushed, feminine, and painterly. 

[[File:Jacques-Louis David - The Emperor Napoleon in His Study at the Tuileries - Google Art Project 2.jpg|thumbnail|upright|''The Emperor Napoleon in His Study at the Tuileries'' (1812) [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.  ]]
This work also brought him to the attention of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]. The story for the painting is as follows: "The Romans have abducted the daughters of their neighbors, the Sabines. To avenge this abduction, the Sabines attacked Rome, although not immediately—since Hersilia, the daughter of Tatius, the leader of the Sabines, had been married to [[Romulus]], the Roman leader, and then had two children by him in the interim. Here we see Hersilia between her father and husband as she adjures the warriors on both sides not to take wives away from their husbands or mothers away from their children. The other Sabine Women join in her exhortations." During this time, the martyrs of the Revolution were taken from the Pantheon and buried in common ground, and revolutionary statues were destroyed. When David was finally released to the country, France had changed. His wife managed to get him released from prison, and he wrote letters to his former wife, and told her he never ceased loving her.  He remarried her in 1796. Finally, wholly restored to his position, he retreated to his studio, took pupils and for the most part, retired from politics.

In August 1796, David and many other artists signed a petition orchestrated by [[Quatremère de Quincy]] which questioned the wisdom of the planned seizure of works of art from Rome. The Director Barras believed that David was "tricked" into signing, although one of David's students recalled that in 1798 his master lamented the fact that masterpieces had been imported from Italy.

==Napoleon==
[[File:Jacques Louis David - Bonaparte franchissant le Grand Saint-Bernard, 20 mai 1800 - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Napoleon at the Saint-Bernard Pass]]'' (1801)]] 
David's close association with the Committee of Public Safety during the Terror resulted in his signing of the death warrant for [[Alexandre de Beauharnais]], a minor noble. Beauharnais's widow, [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Joséphine]], went on to marry [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] and became his empress; David himself depicted their coronation in the ''Coronation of Napoleon and Josephine, 2&amp;nbsp;December 1804''.

[[File:Bodleian Libraries, Le peintre d'histoire encouragé par le gouvt.jpg|thumb|''Historical painter encouraged by the government'', 1814 caricature, [[bodleian library]].]]
David had been an admirer of Napoleon from their first meeting, struck by Bonaparte's classical features. Requesting a sitting from the busy and impatient general, David was able to sketch Napoleon in 1797. David recorded the face of the conqueror of Italy, but the full composition of Napoleon holding the peace treaty with Austria remains unfinished. Bonaparte had high esteem for David, and asked him to accompany him to [[Egypt]] in 1798, but David refused, claiming he was too old for adventuring and sending instead his student, [[Antoine-Jean Gros]].{{Citation needed|reason=Please prove where it says Gros even went to Egypt|date=May 2016}}

After Napoleon's [[18 Brumaire|successful coup d'état]] in 1799, as First Consul he commissioned David to commemorate his daring crossing of the Alps. The crossing of the St. Bernard Pass had allowed the French to surprise the Austrian army and win victory at the [[Battle of Marengo]] on 14 June 1800. Although Napoleon had crossed the Alps on a mule, he requested that he be portrayed "calm upon a fiery steed". David complied with ''[[Napoleon Crossing the Alps|Napoleon Crossing the Saint-Bernard]].''  After the proclamation of the Empire in 1804, David became the official [[court painter]] of the regime. During this period he took students, one of whom was the Belgian painter [[Pieter van Hanselaere]].

[[File:Jacques Louis David - Le couronnement de l'Empereur et de l'Impératrice, 2 décembre 1804 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Coronation of Napoleon]]'', (1806)]]

One of the works David was commissioned for was ''The Coronation of Napoleon in Notre Dame''. David was permitted to watch the event. He had plans of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] delivered and participants in the coronation came to his studio to pose individually, though never the Emperor (the only time David obtained a sitting from Napoleon had been in 1797). David did manage to get a private sitting with the Empress Joséphine and Napoleon's sister, [[Caroline Bonaparte|Caroline Murat]], through the intervention of erstwhile art patron Marshal [[Joachim Murat]], the Emperor's brother-in-law. For his background, David had the choir of Notre Dame act as his fill-in characters. [[Pope Pius VII]] came to sit for the painting, and actually blessed David. Napoleon came to see the painter, stared at the canvas for an hour and said "David, I salute you." David had to redo several parts of the painting because of Napoleon's various whims, and for this painting, he received twenty-four thousand Francs.

On the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] returning to power, David figured in the list of proscribed former revolutionaries and Bonapartists—for having voted execution for the deposed King Louis XVI; and for participating in the death of [[Louis XVII of France|Louis XVII]]. Mistreated and starved, the imprisoned Louis XVII was forced into a false confession of incest with his mother, Queen Marie-Antoinette. This was untrue, as the son was separated from his mother early and was not allowed communication with her, nevertheless, the allegation helped earn her the guillotine. The newly restored Bourbon King, Louis XVIII, however, granted amnesty to David and even offered him the position of court painter. David refused, preferring self-exile in Brussels. There, he trained and influenced Brussels artists like [[François-Joseph Navez]] and [[Ignace Brice]], painted ''Cupid and Psyche'' and quietly lived the remainder of his life with his wife (whom he had remarried). In that time, he painted smaller-scale mythological scenes, and portraits of citizens of Brussels and Napoleonic émigrés, such as the Baron Gerard.

David created his last great work, ''[[Mars Being Disarmed by Venus|Mars Being Disarmed by Venus and the Three Graces]]'', from 1822 to 1824. In December 1823, he wrote: "This is the last picture I want to paint, but I want to surpass myself in it. I will put the date of my seventy-five years on it and afterwards I will never again pick up my brush." The finished painting—evoking painted porcelain because of its limpid coloration—was exhibited first in Brussels, then in Paris, where his former students flocked to view it. 
[[File:Jacques-Louis David - Mars desarme par Venus.JPG|thumb|''[[Mars Being Disarmed by Venus|Mars Being Disarmed by Venus and the Three Graces]]'', David's last great work (1824)]] 
The exhibition was profitable—13,000 francs, after deducting operating costs, thus, more than 10,000 people visited and viewed the painting. In his later years, David remained in full command of his artistic faculties, even after a stroke in the spring of 1825 disfigured his face and slurred his speech. In June 1825, he resolved to embark on an improved version of his ''Anger of Achilles'' (also known as the ''Sacrifice of Iphigenie''); the earlier version was completed in 1819 and is now in the collection of the [[Kimbell Art Museum|Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, Texas]]. David remarked to his friends who visited his studio "this [painting] is what is killing me" such was his determination to complete the work, but by October it must have already been well advanced, as his former pupil Gros wrote to congratulate him, having heard reports of the painting's merits. By the time David died, the painting had been completed and the commissioner Ambroise Firmin-Didot brought it back to Paris to include it in the exhibition "Pour les grecs" that he had organised and which opened in Paris in April 1826.

When David was leaving a theater, a carriage struck him, and he later died, on 29 December 1825. At his death, some portraits were auctioned in Paris, they sold for little; the famous ''Death of Marat'' was exhibited in a secluded room, to avoid outraging public sensibilities. Disallowed return to France for burial, for having been a regicide of King Louis XVI, the body of the painter Jacques-Louis David was buried in Brussels and moved in 1882 to [[Grave of Jacques-Louis David|Brussels Cemetery]], while some say his heart was buried with his wife at [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]], Paris.
David was made a Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur in 1803. He was promoted to an Officier in 1808. And, in 1815, he was promoted to a Commandant (now Commandeur) de la Légion d'honneur.

==Freemasonry==
The theme of the oath found in several works like ''The Oath of the Tennis Court'', ''The Distribution of the Eagles'', and ''Leonidas at Thermopylae'', was perhaps inspired by the rituals of Freemasonry. In 1989 during the "David against David" conference Albert Boime was able to prove, on the basis of a document dated in 1787, the painter's membership in the "La Moderation" Masonic Lodge.&lt;ref&gt;Les thèmes du serment, David et la Franc-maçonnerie ;page 83 (Boime, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Le Paris des Francs- Maçons (Emmanuel Pierret, Laurent Kupferman - 2013 - ed. Cherche midi)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical analysis of David's face==
[[File:David Self-Portrait 1791.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright=0.6|''Self-Portrait'' (1791)]]
Jacques-Louis David's facial abnormalities were traditionally reported to be a consequence of a deep facial sword wound after a [[fencing]] incident. These left him with a noticeable asymmetry during facial expression and resulted in his difficulty in eating or speaking (he could not pronounce some consonants such as the letter 'r'). A sword scar wound on the left side of his face is present in his self-portrait and sculptures and corresponds to some of the buccal branches of the facial nerve. An injury to this nerve and its branches are likely to have resulted in the difficulties with his left facial movement.

Furthermore, as a result of this injury, he suffered from a growth on his face that biographers and art historians have defined as a [[benign tumor]]. These, however, may have been a [[granuloma]], or even a post-traumatic [[neuroma]].&lt;ref&gt;Ashrafian, H. ''Jacques-Louis David and his post-traumatic facial pathology''. ''J R Soc Med'' 2007;100:341-342.&lt;/ref&gt; As Simon Schama has pointed out, witty banter and public speaking ability were key aspects of the social culture of 18th-century France. In light of these cultural keystones, David's tumor would have been a heavy obstacle in his social life.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, Simon. ''The Power of Art: Jacques-Louis David''. https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/powerofart/david.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; David was sometimes referred to as "David of the Tumor".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|pp=1–30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portraiture==
In addition to his history paintings, David completed a number of privately commissioned portraits. Warren Roberts, among others, has pointed out the contrast between David's "public style" of painting, as shown in his history paintings, and his "private style", as shown in his portraits.&lt;ref name="RobertsWarren"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|pp=42–45}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His portraits were characterized by a sense of truth and realism. He focused on defining his subjects’ features and characters without idealizing them.&lt;ref&gt; Bordes, Phillip. “Jacques-Louis David: Empire to Exile.” New Haven: Yale University Press, 2007. &lt;/ref&gt; This is different from the style seen in his historical paintings, in which he idealizes his figures’ features and bodies to align with Greek and Roman ideals of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Elizabeth Barkley. "Jacques-Louis David." Smithsonian 29, no. 5 (August 1998): 80. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed November 18, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; He puts a great deal of detail into his portraits, defining smaller features like hands and fabric. The compositions of his portraits remain simple with blank backgrounds that allow the viewer to focus on the details of the subject.

The portrait he did of his wife (1813) is an example of his typical portrait style.&lt;ref name="RobertsWarren"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|pp=42–45}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The background is dark and simple without any clues as to the setting, which forces the viewer to focus entirely on her. Her features are un-idealized and truthful to her appearance.&lt;ref name="RobertsWarren"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|pp=42–45}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a great amount of detail that can be seen in his attention to portraying the satin material of the dress she wears, the drapery of the scarf around her, and her hands which rest in her lap. 

[[File:Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès - crop.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=|''[[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès]]'', 1817]]
In the painting of Brutus (1789), the man and his wife are separated, both morally and physically. Paintings like these, depicting the great strength of patriotic sacrifice, made David a popular hero of the revolution.&lt;ref name="RobertsWarren" /&gt;

In the ''[[Portrait of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and his wife]]'' (1788), the man and his wife are tied together in an intimate pose. She leans on his shoulder while he pauses from his work to look up at her. David casts them in a soft light, not in the sharp contrast of Brutus or of the Horatii. Also of interest—Lavoisier was a tax collector, as well as a famous chemist. Though he spent some of his money trying to clean up swamps and eradicate malaria, he was nonetheless sent to the guillotine during the Reign of Terror as an enemy of the people. David, then a powerful member of the National Assembly, stood idly by and watched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|pp=43–45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other portraits include paintings of his sister-in-law and her husband, Madame and Monsieur Seriziat. The picture of Monsieur Seriziat depicts a man of wealth, sitting comfortably with his horse-riding equipment. The picture of the Madame shows her wearing an unadorned white dress, holding her young child's hand as they lean against a bed. David painted these portraits of Madame and Monsieur Seriziat out of gratitude for letting him stay with them after he was in jail.&lt;ref&gt;Lajer-Burcharth, Ewa. “Necklines: The Art of Jacques-Louis David After the Terror.” New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of David's life, he painted a portrait of his old friend ''[[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès|Abbé Sieyès]]''. Both had been involved in the Revolution, both had survived the purging of political radicals that followed the reign of terror. 

==Shift in attitude==
The shift in David's perspective played an important role in the paintings of David's later life, including this one of Sieyès.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|pp=90–150}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the height of the reign of terror, David was an ardent supporter of radicals such as Robespierre and Marat, and twice offered up his life in their defense. He organized revolutionary festivals and painted portraits of martyrs of the revolution, such as Lepeletier, who was assassinated for voting for the death of the king. David was an impassioned speaker at times in the National Assembly. In speaking to the Assembly about the young boy named Bara, another martyr of the revolution, David said, "O Bara! O Viala! The blood that you have spread still smokes; it rises toward Heaven and cries for vengeance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|pp=88–92}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Robespierre was sent to the guillotine, however, David was imprisoned and changed the attitude of his rhetoric. During his imprisonment he wrote many letters, pleading his innocence. In one he wrote, "I am prevented from returning to my atelier, which, alas, I should never have left. I believed that in accepting the most honorable position, but very difficult to fill, that of legislator, that a righteous heart would suffice, but I lacked the second quality, understanding."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|p=90–94}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, while explaining his developing "Grecian style" for paintings such as ''[[The Intervention of the Sabine Women]]'', David further commented on a shift in attitude: "In all human activity the violent and transitory develops first; repose and profundity appear last. The recognition of these latter qualities requires time; only great masters have them, while their pupils have access only to violent passions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|pp=100–112}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:David dessinant Marie-Antoinette--van den Büssche-IMG 2385.JPG|thumb|upright|75 years after his death, David is painted by the painter Emmanuel Van Den Büssche, ([[Musée de la Révolution française]]).]]
Jacques-Louis David was, in his time, regarded as the leading painter in France, and arguably all of Western Europe; many of the painters honored by the restored Bourbons following the French Revolution had been David's pupils.&lt;ref name="Lee 321"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Simon|title=David|pages=321}}&lt;/ref&gt;  David's student [[Antoine-Jean Gros]] for example, was made a Baron and honored by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s court.&lt;ref name="Lee 321"/&gt;  Another pupil of David's, [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]] became the most important artist of the restored Royal Academy and the figurehead of the Neoclassical school of art, engaging the increasingly popular Romantic school of art that was beginning to challenge Neoclassicism.&lt;ref name="Lee 321"/&gt; David invested in the formation of young artists for the Rome Prize, which was also a way to pursue his old rivalry with other contemporary painters such as [[Joseph-Benoît Suvée]], who had also started teaching classes.&lt;ref&gt;P. Bordes, Jacques-Louis David:Empire to Exile. Yale University Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; To be one of David's students was considered prestigious and earned his students a lifetime reputation.&lt;ref name="Lee 321–322"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Simon|title=David|pages=321–322}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also called on the more advanced students, such as [[Jérôme-Martin Langlois]], to help him paint his large canvases.

Despite David's reputation, he was more fiercely criticized right after his death than at any point during his life. His style came under the most serious criticism for being static, rigid, and uniform throughout all his work. David's art was also attacked for being cold and lacking warmth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Simon|title=David|pages=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; David, however, made his career precisely by challenging what he saw as the earlier rigidity and conformity of the French Royal Academy's approach to art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; David's later works also reflect his growth in the development of the [[Empire style]], notable for its dynamism and warm colors. It is likely that much of the criticism of David following his death came from David's opponents; during his lifetime David made a great many enemies with his competitive and arrogant personality as well as his role in the Terror.&lt;ref name="Lee 321–322"/&gt; David sent many people to the guillotine and personally signed the death warrants for [[King Louis XVI]] and [[Marie Antoinette]]. One significant episode in David's political career that earned him a great deal of contempt was the execution of Emilie Chalgrin. A fellow painter [[Carle Vernet]] had approached David, who was on the [[Committee of Public Safety]], requesting him to intervene on behalf of his sister, Chalgrin. She had been accused of crimes against the Republic, most notably possessing stolen items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Simon|title=David|pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; David refused to intervene in her favor, and she was executed. Vernet blamed David for her death, and the episode followed him for the rest of his life and after.

In the last 50 years David has enjoyed a revival in popular favor and in 1948 his two-hundredth birthday was celebrated with an exhibition at the [[Musée de l'Orangerie]] in Paris and at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] showing his life's works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Simon|title=David|pages=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following World War II, Jacques-Louis David was increasingly regarded as a symbol of French national pride and identity, as well as a vital force in the development of European and French art in the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Simon|title=David|pages=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The birth of Romanticism is traditionally credited to the paintings of eighteenth century French artists such as Jacques-Louis David. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee Palmer|first=Allison|title=Historical Dictionary of Romantic Art and Architecture|pages=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Filmography==
''[[Danton (1983 film)|Danton]]'' ([[Andrzej Wajda]], France, 1982) – Historical drama. Many scenes include David as a silent character watching and drawing. The film focuses on the period of the Terror.

[[File:Seat of the Košice Self-governing Region.jpg|thumb|275px|The seat of the Košice Self-governing Region]]
The '''Košice Self-governing Region''' ({{lang-sk|Košický samosprávny kraj}}, ''KSK'') or the '''Košice Higher Territorial Unit''' (Slovak: ''Košický vyšší územný celok'', ''KVÚC'') is one of [[Slovakia]]'s eight "self-governing regions" whose territory is identical with that of the administrative [[Košice Region]].

The establishing session of the first Council of the Košice Self-governing Region was held on December 19, 2001 in the historical hall of former ''Župný dom'' ([[Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)|County]] House, today's [[East Slovak Gallery]] building) with the participation of 57 [[deputies]] elected in the first regional [[elections in Slovakia|elections for the second level of self-government]] in [[Slovakia]]. [[Rudolf Bauer (politician)|Rudolf Bauer]] (a [[Christian democrat]]) was elected as the first president of the Košice Self-governing Region. His successor is [[Zdenko Trebuľa]] (a [[social democrat]]) elected for the president of the Košice Self-governing Region on December 10, 2005. He was inaugurated on January 9, 2006.

The seat of the Košice Self-governing Region is a former military headquarters building (generally known as ''The Division'') on the eastern part of the ''Námestie Maratónu mieru'' (Peace Marathon Square) in [[Košice]]. It was completed in 1908 as the largest and the most modern building in the town at that time.

Several [[land reform]]s were done in [[Prussia]], beginning at 1763, in order to liberate the peasants from the bondages of [[Feudalism]].

== Reforms in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] ==
* In 1763, [[Frederick II of Prussia]] abolished the [[serfdom]] on all Crown lands. Additionally, he issued an order to end the supperssion of the peasant, relieving him and his children of domestic services to the landlord. His intentions were good - he believed that peasants should be well-treated in order to function properly. But, his reform did not have much effect, because the peasants had no land, and thus were forced to return to serving their previous lords in return to a right to till their lands.
* In 1798, [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] expressed his royal desire to see serfdom abolished throughout the kingdom, and permitted peasants to redeem their [[Corvée]] for cash payments. He also secured the rights of [[precarious]] tenants.
* In 1806, Prussia was defeated by Napoleon I and lost half its territory in the second of the [[Treaties of Tilsit]]. This was the trigger to the [[Prussian reforms]], whose main goal was to modernize the Prussian state so that it may regain its lost power. As part of these reforms, [[serfdom]] was legally abolished throughout the kingdom. The peasant was allowed to become a free proprietor of land, if only he could buy it. Since peasants had no money, they were allowed to pay for the land by giving up their rights to assistance from their landlords and giving up their rights to use common lands for grazing. Alternatively, they could "pay" by giving some of their lands to their landlords. The net outcome was that the peasants' situation has ''worsened'' - they had less land to till, and no access to common lands. On the other hand, the nobles managed to buy much of the peasants' lands and gained exclusive access to the common lands, so land holding became more concentrated - just the opposite of what the reformers intended.
* Over the next three decades, the government made it easier for peasants to buy land, as part of a sweep towards liberal sentiment in much of western Europe.
* After the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]], peasants refused to pay their remaining obligations to their landlords. Most of these obligations were legally abolished at 1850. The price for redeeming land was set at 25 times its annual revenue, and peasants could buy land by taking mortgages from banks.

== Aftermath in [[Germany]] ==
* Although serfdom was legally abolished, the [[Prussian Junkers]] (members of the landed nobility) kept most of their power through the [[German Conservative Party]] in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]], until World War II.
* After WWII, in 1945, the communist ''[[History of the German Democratic Republic#Economic policy, 1956–75|Bodenreform]]'' in [[East Germany]] nationalised all private property exceeding an area of 100 hectares, and redistributed it to publicly owned estates.
* Since 1990, after [[German reunification]], some Junkers tried to regain their former estates through civil lawsuits, but the German courts have upheld the land reforms and rebuffed all claims for compensation.

'''Land registration''' generally describes systems by which matters concerning [[ownership]], [[Possession (law)|possession]] or other rights in [[Real estate|land]] can be recorded (usually with a [[government]] agency or department) to provide evidence of [[title (property)|title]], facilitate transactions and to prevent unlawful disposal. The information recorded and the protection provided will vary by jurisdiction.

In [[common law]] countries, particularly in [[jurisdiction]]s in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], when replacing the [[deeds registration]] system, title registrations are broadly classified into two basic types: the [[Torrens title]] system and the English system, a modified version of the Torrens system.&lt;ref name="Ireland p 24"&gt;Lyall, Andrew. ''Land Law In Ireland''. {{ISBN|1-85800-186-2}}; Ch. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cadastre]] and land registration are both types of land recording and complement each other.&lt;ref name=Henssen1995&gt;Jo Henssen, BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE MAIN CADASTRAL SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD, {{cite web |url=https://www.fig.net/organisation/comm/7/activities/reports/events/Delft_seminar_95/paper2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327084326/https://www.fig.net/organisation/comm/7/activities/reports/events/Delft_seminar_95/paper2.html |archivedate=27 March 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hong Kong==
{{Main|Land Registry (Hong Kong)}}
The [[Hong Kong]] [[Land Registry (Hong Kong)|Land Registry]] administers the Land Registration Ordinance and provides facilities for search of the Land Register and related records by the public and government departments. It has responsibility for the registration of owners corporations under the Building Management Ordinance.

==Ireland (Republic of)==
Land registration is compulsory across all of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and two parallel registries are maintained: the '''[[Irish Land Registry|Land Registry]]''' ('''Clárlann na Talún''' in [[Irish language|Irish]]) and the '''[[Irish Registry of Deeds|Registry of Deeds]]''' ('''Clárlann na nGníomhas''').

The system in Ireland follows the English system, but with features typical of the Torrens system (for example, anyone can inspect the register). [[Robert Torrens]] himself drafted the Record of Title (Ireland) Act, 1865 in order to record  titles conveyed. The Landed Estates Court a register, the "Record of Title". While the record was not open to the public, the index could be inspected by anyone, today the index and folios can be viewed by anyone with an administration charge.  Recording of title under the Act was voluntary and this was one of the reasons why the Act proved ineffective.&lt;ref name="Ireland p 24"/&gt;

The Land Registry has been dealing with the registration of all transactions (purchase, sale, [[Mortgage law|mortgage]], remortgage and other burdens) concerning ''registered land'' since 1892, and issued ''land certificates'' which are a state guarantee of the registered owner's good title up to 1 January 2007. Land Certificates have been abolished by virtue of Section 23 of the Registration of Deeds and Title Act, 2006. Every piece of land  in the register — which is arranged by [[County#Ireland|county]] — is granted a folio number, under which all transactions pertaining to the land can be examined on request and after payment of a fee. Approximately 90% of land by area, and 85% of title, is registered.

The Registry of Deeds has since 1708 dealt with the registration of wills, title deeds, mortgage documents and other documentation concerning granting of title over land. It was originally set up to enforce the legislation regarding ownership of land by Catholics. A registered deed took precedence over an unregistered deed.  Original deeds and their schedules were not retained by the registry, but rather detailed summaries (called "memorials") of conveyancing and mortgage documents are stamped and filed by the registrar. These documents are generally signed by at least one of the parties and one of the witnesses of the deeds.  No certificates or guarantees of title are issued: the registry merely endeavours to provide information concerning the deeds lodged against a certain property — and, crucially, the order in which they were lodged — such as the last named owner or the latest mortgage to be lodged.

Both registries are managed by the [http://www.prai.ie Property Registration Authority] and have offices in [[Dublin]], [[Waterford]] and in [[Roscommon]]. Since most of Ireland gained independence in 1922, the registries have dealt with the land in the 26 counties of the Republic of Ireland (formerly the [[Irish Free State]], 1922–37) only, the registers of land in [[Northern Ireland]] now being administered by the Land and Property Services in the Northern Ireland Department of Finance and Personnel.

Recording of title under recent legislative changes is now compulsory. Public access to the index and folios is limited to individuals who have an account with the [http://www.prai.ie Property Registration Authority].

The Property Registration Authority in Ireland is connected to the European Land Information Service [[EULIS]].

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom there are several land registers, including [[HM Land Registry]] for England and Wales, [[Registers of Scotland]], and Land and Property Services in Northern Ireland.

===England and Wales===
{{main|English land law|Registered land in English law}}
A national system of land registration was first attempted in [[England and Wales]] under the [[Land Registration Act 1862]], a register having operated for the county of [[Middlesex]] (excluding the [[City of London]]) since 1709.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer &amp; Pemberton (2000) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; This voluntary national system proved ineffective and, following further attempts in 1875 and 1897, the present system was brought into force by the [[Land Registration Act 1925]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayer &amp; Pemberton (2000) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; It is operated by ''[[HM Land Registry]]''.

Over time various areas of the country were designated areas of compulsory registration by order so in different parts of the country compulsory registration has been around longer than in others.  The last order was made in 1990, so now virtually all transactions in land result in compulsory registration.  One difference is land changing ownership after death, where land is gifted rather than sold; these became compulsorily registrable only in April 1998. Similarly it became compulsory to register land when a mortgage is created on it in 1998.

The [[Land Registration Act 2002]] leaves the 1925 system substantially in place but enables the future compulsory introduction of [[electronic conveyancing]] using [[electronic signature]]s to transfer and register property.

The Land Registry is connected to the European Land Information Service [[EULIS]].

Details of registrations are available to any person upon payment of the prescribed fees. Precautionary measures have been introduced in recent years to verify the identity of persons attempting to change records of title. No details will be on record for any land which has not had a relevant transaction recorded as will often occur if, for example, ownership was last transferred before the introduction of compulsory registration in a particular area. Public access to the title and filed plans in pdf format is available for a fee at [http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/ Land Registry of England and Wales]. Public access to a digital version of the boundaries on aerial photography is available at [http://www.landregistry-uk.com/map-search].

A legal boundary deals with the precise separation of ownership of land. It is an invisible line dividing one person's land from another's. It does not have thickness or width and usually, but not always, falls somewhere in or along a physical boundary feature such as a wall, fence or hedge. The exact positions of the legal boundaries are almost never shown on registered title plans and are not shown on Ordnance Survey maps.

In a joint statement between Land Registry (England and Wales) and Ordnance Survey they state that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/public/about-us/policy-statements/ordnance-survey-joint-statement|title=About us - HM Land Registry|author=|date=|website=landregistry.gov.uk|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140807113641/http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/public/about-us/policy-statements/ordnance-survey-joint-statement|archivedate=7 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|This title plan shows the general position of the boundaries: it does not show the exact line of the boundaries. Measurements scaled from this plan may not match measurements between the same points on the ground.}}

===Scotland===
Scotland is one of the first countries in the world to have a system of land registration. Land registration commenced in Scotland with the creation of the "Register of [[Sasines]]" by the [[Registration Act 1617]].

Today, almost all land in Scotland is registered in the Register of Sasines making it possible (but, because of the mapping limitations of that register, sometimes difficult) to determine who owns what.

Since 1981 the Register of Sasines is being replaced by the [[Registers of Scotland]], although certain deeds can continue to be recorded in the old register for the time being. The Registers of Scotland agency is responsible for maintaining both the Register of Sasines and the new register.

The governing legislation is the Land Registration etc. (Scotland) Act 2012, replacing the earlier [[Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979]]. The Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979 introduced a new system which now records all changes of ownership of land and creation of new titles.

Scotland is divided into 33 registration counties. The Land Register was introduced in a rolling programme beginning with [[Renfrew]] in 1981 and finishing in 2003 with [[Banff, Aberdeenshire|Banff]], [[Caithness]], [[Moray]], [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]]. The scheme is that, once a county becomes operational for the Land Register, properties switch from the Sasine to the Land Register on the first occasion that they are transferred. The switching process is known as first registration. According to the latest figures, some 55% (1.4 million) of all properties are now on the Land Register. This represents only 21% of the land mass although there is considerable variation throughout the 33 registration counties. In Glasgow and its conurbation the figure is over 50%, reflecting both its urban nature and the relatively early date at which it was brought on to the Register.

===Northern Ireland===
Land registration in [[Northern Ireland]] is operated by ''Land and Property Services'', an executive agency within the Department of Finance and Personnel for Northern Ireland. Prior to 1 Apr 2007 it was dealt with by the ''Land Registers Northern Ireland'' government agency.

==United States of America==
{{Main|Recording (real estate)}}
Land registration is a matter for individual states in the USA. Thus each state will define the officials, authorities, and their functions and duties with respect to the ownership of land within that state, as is more fully described in the specified main article.

The '''Library Freedom Project''' teaches [[library|librarians]] about surveillance threats, privacy rights, and digital tools to thwart surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Library Freedom Project|title=Our Work|url=https://libraryfreedomproject.org/ourwork/|website=Library Freedom Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the Project began an endeavour to place relays and, particularly, exit nodes of the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] anonymity network in public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-exit-nodes-libraries-pilot-phase-one |title=Tor Exit Nodes in Libraries - Pilot (phase one) &amp;#124; The Tor Blog |publisher=Blog.torproject.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yro.slashdot.org/story/15/07/31/2149206/tor-project-pilots-exit-nodes-in-libraries |title=Tor Project Pilots Exit Nodes In Libraries - Slashdot |publisher=Yro.slashdot.org |date=2015-07-31 |accessdate=2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tor Exit Relay Project==
Its [[pilot project]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concordmonitor.com/readerservices/businessxml/18550899-95/lebanon-library-at-center-of-internet-privacy-debate-in-shutting-its-tor-server |title=Lebanon library at center of internet privacy debate in shutting off its Tor server |publisher=Concord Monitor |date=2015-09-11 |accessdate=2015-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930074648/http://www.concordmonitor.com/readerservices/businessxml/18550899-95/lebanon-library-at-center-of-internet-privacy-debate-in-shutting-its-tor-server |archivedate=2015-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; enabled the Kilton Public Library in [[Lebanon, New Hampshire]] to become in July 2015 the first [[library]] in the United States to host Tor, running a middle relay on its excess bandwidth. This service was put on hold in early September, however, when the library was visited by the local police department after they had received a "heads up" e-mail from [[Department of Homeland Security]] highlighting the criminal uses of the Tor network (and which falsely claimed that this was the network's primary usage),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://libraryfreedomproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Kilton-Letter.pdf |title=Letter to Kilton Library, signed by Library Freedom Project, ACLU, EFF, and significant others |date=2015-09-02|accessdate=2016-01-15 |publisher=Library Freedom Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereupon the library began reconsidering the deployment from a [[public relations]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Angwin |first=Julia |url=https://www.propublica.org/article/library-support-anonymous-internet-browsing-effort-stops-after-dhs-email |title=First Library to Support Tor Anonymous Internet Browsing Effort Stops After DHS Email |publisher=ProPublica |date=2015-09-10 |accessdate=2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://act.eff.org/action/support-tor-and-intellectual-freedom-in-libraries |title=Support Tor and Intellectual Freedom in Libraries &amp;#124; EFF Action Center |publisher=Act.eff.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yro.slashdot.org/story/15/09/11/175201/first-library-to-support-anonymous-internet-browsing-halts-project-after-dhs-email |title=First Library To Support Anonymous Internet Browsing Halts Project After DHS Email - Slashdot |publisher=Yro.slashdot.org |date=2015-09-11 |accessdate=2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an outpouring of support from the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], the Massachusetts and New Hampshire affiliates of the [[ACLU]], the Tor Project itself, an editorial in the local paper [[Valley News]] strongly in favor of the pilot project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vnews.com/opinion/18606492-95/editorial-privacy-concerns-and-the-kilton-library |title=Editorial: Privacy Concerns and the Kilton Library &amp;#124; Valley News |publisher=Vnews.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and virtually unanimous public testimony, the library board of trustees decided on 15 September 2015 to renew the anonymity service, letting stand its previous unanimous vote to establish the middle relay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glaser |first=April |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/09/16/how_new_hampshire_s_lebanon_libraries_fought_back_against_dhs_fearmongering.html |title=How New Hampshire's Lebanon Libraries fought back against DHS fearmongering about Tor |publisher=Slate.com |date=2015-09-11 |accessdate=2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vnews.com/photos/inthenews/18620952-95/despite-law-enforcement-concerns-lebanon-board-will-reactivate-privacy-network-tor-at-kilton-library |title=Despite Law Enforcement Concerns, Lebanon Board Will Reactivate Privacy Network Tor at Kilton Library &amp;#124; Valley News |publisher=Vnews.com |date=2015-06-15 |accessdate=2015-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918031540/http://www.vnews.com/photos/inthenews/18620952-95/despite-law-enforcement-concerns-lebanon-board-will-reactivate-privacy-network-tor-at-kilton-library |archivedate=2015-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A dozen libraries and their supporters nationwide expressed interest hosting their own nodes after the DHS involvement became public (an example of the [[Streisand effect]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiofree.org/us/small-town-library-stands-up-to-government-scare-tactic-aimed-at-digital-privacy-tool/ |title=Small town library stands up to government scare tactic aimed at digital privacy tool |publisher=Radio Free |date=2015-09-16 |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/09/17/library_freedom_project_dozen_more_tor_nodes/ |title=SCREW YOU, FEDS!

[[Zoe Lofgren]] (D-Calif) released a letter on 10 December 2015, in which she asked the DHS to clarify its procedures, stating that “While the Kilton Public Library’s board ultimately voted to restore their Tor relay, I am no less disturbed by the possibility that DHS employers are pressuring or persuading public and private entities to discontinue or degrade services that protect the privacy and anonymity of U.S. citizens.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lofgren.house.gov/|title=Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren|website=Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/politics/tor-libraries-dhs-zoe-lofgren-letter/|title=Rep.

In March 2016, New Hampshire state representative [[Keith Ammon]] introduced a bill&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billText.aspx?id=796&amp;txtFormat=html&lt;/ref&gt; allowing public libraries to run privacy software such as Tor which specifically referenced Tor itself. The bill was crafted with extensive input from Library Freedom director Alison Macrina, and was the direct result of the Kilton Public Library imbroglio.&lt;ref name="Proposed New Hampshire bill"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailydot.com/politics/new-hampshire-tor-library-legislation/ | title=New Hampshire bill allows for libraries' usage of encryption and privacy software | publisher=The Daily Dot | date=2016-03-10 | accessdate=2016-03-10 | author=O'Neill, Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was passed by the House 268-62.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://legiscan.com/NH/text/HB1508/id/1288060|title=New Hampshire HB1508 - 2016 - Regular Session|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in March 2016, the first Tor middle relay at a library in Canada was established, at the [[University of Western Ontario]].&lt;ref name="Western FIMS relay"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fims.uwo.ca/news/2016/library_in_fims_joins_global_network_fighting_back_against_digital_surveillance_censorship_and_the_obstruction_of_information.html | title=Library in FIMS joins global network fighting back against digital surveillance, censorship, and the obstruction of information | publisher=FIMS News | date=2016-03-16 | accessdate=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that the running of a Tor exit node is an unsettled area of Canadian law,&lt;ref name="Legality of running a Tor exit node in Canada"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://motherboard.vice.com/read/can-you-be-arrested-for-running-a-tor-exit-node-in-canada | title=Can You Be Arrested for Running a Tor Exit Node In Canada? | publisher=Motherboard | date=2016-09-25 | accessdate=2016-03-16 | author=Pearson, Jordan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that institutions are more capable than individuals to cope with legal pressures, Alison Macrina has opined that in some ways she would like to see intelligence agencies and law enforcement attempt to intervene in the event that an exit node were established.&lt;ref name="Fighting the Feds on running a Tor node"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_ca/read/canadian-librarians-must-be-ready-to-fight-the-feds-on-running-a-tor-node-western-library-freedom-project | title=Canadian Librarians Must Be Ready to Fight the Feds on Running a Tor Node | publisher=Motherboard | date=2016-03-16 | accessdate=2016-03-16 | author=Pearson, Jordan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in March 2016, the Library Freedom Project was awarded the [[Free Software Foundation]]'s 2015 
Free Software Award for Projects of Social Benefit at [[MIT]].&lt;ref name="2015 Free Software Award winner "&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.fsf.org/news/library-freedom-project-and-werner-koch-are-2015-free-software-awards-winner | title=Library Freedom Project and Werner Koch are 2015 Free Software Awards winners | publisher=Free Software Foundation | date=2016-03-19 | accessdate=2016-03-19 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 26 June 2016, the Kilton Library is the only library in the U.S. running a Tor exit node.&lt;ref name="Only Library Tor Node in the U.S."&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3660721/Browse-free-die-New-Hampshire-library-privacy-fore.html | title=Browse free or die? New Hampshire library is at privacy fore | publisher=DailyMail.com | date=2016-06-26 | accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in August of that same year, Kilton Library's IT Manager, Chuck McAndrew, said they still hoped other libraries would run their own, adding, "We always planned on our library simply being the pilot for a larger nationwide program. Like everything, this will take time. We continue to talk to other libraries, and the Library Freedom Project is actively working with a number of libraries that have an interest in participating."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/chuck-mcandrew-defends-tor/|title=Tor crusader discuss privacy, freedom with ExpressVPN|date=2016-08-04|work=Home of internet privacy|access-date=2017-08-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Workshops ==
[[File:LibraryFreedomProjectStickerSwag.jpg|thumb|The director of the Library Freedom Project, Alison Macrina, at unBound, the technology lab and [[maker space]] of the [[Meridian, Idaho|Meridian]] Library District in Idaho, shortly after giving a privacy workshop in January 2016. The logos are those of assorted privacy enhancing technologies, institutions and advocacy groups such as the [[Tor project]], the [[Electronic Freedom Foundation]], [[Privacy Badger]] and [[Noisebridge]]]] Working with ACLU affiliates across the country, the Library Freedom Project provides workshops to educate librarians about "some of the major surveillance programs and authorizations, including [[Patriot Act|the USA PATRIOT Act]], section 702 of [[FISA Amendments Act|the FISA Amendments Act]], [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], [[XKeyscore|XKEYSCORE]], and more, connecting the [[National Security Agency|NSA]]’s dragnet with [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and local police surveillance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Workshops – Library Freedom Project|url = https://libraryfreedomproject.org/ourwork/workshops/|website = libraryfreedomproject.org|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also discuss current and developing privacy law on both the federal and state levels, in addition to advising librarians how to handle issues like gag orders and [[National security letter|National Security Letters]].  Other topics covered include Privacy Enhancing Technology (PET) that might help library patrons browse anonymously or evade online tracking.

Furthermore, the project conducts training classes for library patrons themselves which focus on on-line security and privacy.  The classes can be adjusted to accommodate any level of user, from beginner to advanced, and various security needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Community classes – Library Freedom Project|url = https://libraryfreedomproject.org/communityclasses/|website = libraryfreedomproject.org|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that library patrons, including but not limited to [[domestic violence]] survivors, political [[activism|activists]], [[whistle blower]]s, [[journalism|journalists]], and [[LGBT]] teens or adults in many communities, face various threat models, the gestalt of digital security is not a matter of one-size-fits-all. In this regard Alison Macrina has remarked at a library conference that " “Digital security isn’t about which tools you use; rather, it’s about understanding the threats you face and how you can counter those threats. To become more secure, you must determine what you need to protect, and whom you need to protect it from. Threats can change depending on where you’re located, what you’re doing, and whom you’re working with.”&lt;ref name="Digital security gestalt"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2016/03/advocacy/library-freedom-project-nyclu-discuss-privacy-and-online-security/|title=Library Freedom Project, NYCLU Discuss Privacy and Online Security|publisher=Library Journal | date=2016-03-31 | accessdate=2016-05-03 | author=Enis, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Library Freedom Project is a member of the [[torservers.net]] network, an organization of nonprofits which specializes in the general establishment of exit nodes via workshops and donations.&lt;ref name="TorServers.net Members"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-heart-torserversnet |title=Tor at the Heart: Torservers.net|last=Steele |first=Sharon |authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding ==
In January 2015 the Library Freedom Project received $244,700&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/politics/internet-freedom-heroes-2015/|title=The heroes who saved the Internet in 2015 - The Daily Dot|date=31 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[grant (money)|grant]] funding from the [[Knight Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/201450256/ |title=The Library Freedom Project |publisher=Knight Foundation |date= |accessdate=2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in January 2016 $50,000 from the [[The Rose Foundation for Communities and the Environment|Rose Foundation]]'s Consumer Privacy Rights Fund&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://libraryfreedomproject.org/rosefunding/|title=LFP wins Rose Foundation funding – Library Freedom Project|website=libraryfreedomproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the fiscal sponsor of that grant being the [[Ruth Shack|Miami Foundation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rosefdn.org/consumer-privacy-rights-fund/grantees|title=Current Grantees - Rose Foundation|website=rosefdn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017 the Library Freedom Project was awarded a $249,504 grant from the [[Laura Bush]] 21st Century Librarian Program to facilitate the use of practical privacy tools in libraries using a "training the trainers" model. 40 geographically dispersed Privacy Advocates are expected to be trained in a six month course.&lt;ref name="IMLS $50K Grant"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/re-95-17-0076-17 |title=RE-95-17-0076-17 |date=2017-08-31 |website=Institute of Museum and Library Services  |access-date=2017-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York University]] (NYU) and the Library Freedom Project have since created a formal collaborative program funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services called Library Freedom Institute; its inaugural course is expected to begin in June 2018.&lt;ref name="Library Freedom Institute"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://blog.torproject.org/new-program-turns-librarians-privacy-advocates |title=New Program Turns Librarians into Privacy Advocates |last=Macrina |first=Alison |date=2017-12-22 |website=The Tor Project |access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''May Day riots of 1894''' were a series of violent demonstrations that occurred throughout [[Cleveland]], Ohio on May 1, 1894 ([[May Day]]).  Cleveland's unemployment rate increased dramatically during the [[Panic of 1893]].  Finally, riots broke out among the unemployed who condemned city leaders for their ineffective relief measures.&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland: A Concise History, 1796-1996 by Carol Poh Miller and Robert Anthony Wheeler {{ISBN|0-253-21147-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the New York Times, "[t]he desire to stop work seemed to take possession of every laborer..." on May Day of 1894.&lt;ref&gt;"Day of Terror in Cleveland." The New York Times 3 May 1894. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
May Day, or [[International Workers' Day]] was a day for remembering the workers who died during the [[Haymarket affair]] of 1886.&lt;ref name="llco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://llco.org/on-may-day-and-occupy |title=On May Day and Occupy in the USA |publisher=''The Leading Light'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528234946/http://llco.org/on-may-day-and-occupy/ |archivedate=2016-05-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a General Strike in [[Chicago]], Illinois, an unknown person threw a bomb into the crowd, prompting police to fire into the crowd, killing civilians and police alike. The same day in 1890, Raymond Lavigne called for international demonstrations to commemorate the day.&lt;ref name="llco"/&gt; In 1894 the [[Pullman Strike]] in Illinois, as well as this series of unemployed workers' riots on May Day in Cleveland, prompted U.S. President [[Grover Cleveland]] to propose a bill that would make a Labor Day a national public holiday.&lt;ref&gt;"Labor Day." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online School Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., 2012. Web. 15 May 2012.&lt;http://school.eb.com/eb/article-9002416&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Haymarket Square riot in May, 1886, US President Grover Cleveland 
feared that commemorating Labor Day on May 1 could become an opportunity to commemorate the riots.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Did May Day Turn Into Riot Day?" SodaHead.com. Web. &lt;https://www.sodahead.com/united-states/why-did-may-day-turn-into-riot-day/question-2608639/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; May Day celebrations have diminished in the United States, because of the creation of [[Labor Day]].&lt;ref name="llco"/&gt;

===Causes===
One of the major causes of the riots was the [[Panic of 1893]]. The panic precipitated one of the most severe depressions in American History. The closure of two major railroads and other major companies triggered a stock market collapse. The New York banks had heavily invested in the stock market, and bank failures soon began. This caused a contraction of credit, and many other, newer, businesses started to shut down as well. The depression produced widespread social unrest, mostly among the now-unemployed workers. Some people tried to create public works programs for the unemployed, but this was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Brinkley, Alan. "The Panic of 1893." The Unfinished Nation: A Concise History of the American People. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2010, p. 523&lt;/ref&gt;

The riot is now known to have associations with [[left-wing politics]] and [[communism]].&lt;ref&gt;Lisio, Donald J. "The President and Protest: Hoover, Macarthur and the Bonus Riots." Questia School. Web. &lt;http://www.questiaschool.com/PM.qst?a=o&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Red Scare]] followed soon after the riots.

===Effects===
The riots of 1894, along with the Haymarket Affair, brought about a series of discussions about the workforce in America and the depression. In 1904, the International Socialist Conference meeting in Amsterdam called on "all Social Democratic Party organizations and trade unions of all countries to demonstrate energetically on May First for the legal establishment of the 8-hour day, for the class demands of the proletariat, and for universal peace." The congress made it "mandatory upon the proletarian organizations of all countries to stop work on May 1, wherever it is possible without injury to the workers."&lt;ref&gt;"May Day." Socialphy. Web. &lt;http://www.socialphy.com/posts/off-topic/11605/May-Day.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
The city was suffering from an economic crisis. Eventually scores of people lost their jobs and this led to the massive demonstrations and rallies. These became violent and led to confrontations with authorities.&lt;ref&gt;"When Is Labor Day Weekend?" When Is Labor Day Weekend? Web. 18 May 2012. &lt;http://www.whenguide.com/when-is-labor-day-weekend.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The mob consisted of around 4 000 men, who were said to be "a rabble made up chiefly of foreigners".&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;"Day of Terror in Cleveland." The New York Times 3 May 1894. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The mob marched through the manufacturing district of the city, called "The Flats" armed with clubs and stones.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt; Much property was destroyed, but they were ultimately taken down by the police.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt; Men with flags shouted to the crowd to encourage them to join the riots, but only about a dozen boys joined them. The square was abandoned as the mob marched on. The crowd was "hooting and jeering those who didn't join them."

They then attacked firemen, believing they were police. The firemen held their ground as clubs flew. They soon met up with the leader of the mob, who encouraged them to keep peace; he was ignored. They entered the foundry department, where workmen were forced to halt. One man attempted to restart his work, but was held by mob members while others fled from the building. Shops were closed and barred, while employees fled&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;

Mobmen all ran at the Standard Paint Works with the cry "Victory!" The workers of the shop joined the ranks of the men in their attack of the Upson Nut Works.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt; People threw coal at the shop, breaking windows and knocking down workers before they had the chance to retreat. Many men on the inside of the factory were injured in the raid. The coal-throwing stopped as the mob rushed the gates. This slight resistance made the mob take "vengeance by tearing the doors and gates to pieces."&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt; The men then took complete possession over the building, and workers fled in terror. Everything breakable in the shop was destroyed. They left the destroyed shop and went down the railroad tracks to the main office of the company.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;

The police came, which deterred the mob for a short period of time. They took over the coal carts and used them as barriers as they surrounded the police; they threw stones at them. Some of the rioters were scared by the presence of the police, and fled. The crowd of 5 000 "dwindled to half that number."&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt; The leaders of the riot planned an attack on the Faulhaber Furniture Company; but the police stopped them before there could be a repeat of the event at the Upson factory. The police grew to such numbers that they "presented a formidable appearance."&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt; They dispersed the rioters and arrested their leader, Tom Moore.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;

The eastern part of the city was little better off. A throng of 200 Italians marched through the streets armed with clubs, iron and wire rods, and gate posts. At Gates's quarry there were speeches and threats; workers dropped their tools and joined them. The same speeches and threats were made at Neff's quarry, and more men joined. At Reader's quarry, there was little opposition. They broke into boarding houses and compelled more to join them.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;

The Mayor urged the people not to riot, and called for police forces to be assembled. The stated that the city would use every power to maintain law and order. Armories were prepared for discharge at the mayor's order.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;

Another mob forced the workers of the United Salt Company out. They proceeded to the [[Cleveland Rolling Mill]]s where they met by the police. After several minutes of serious clubbing, the mob dispersed in every direction. Seven men, all with broken heads, were arrested.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;

Policemen were stationed in the public square to prevent any gathering there. There was also considerable fear that the rioters would gather the dynamite used by the railroad companies to blow up factories and private residences; however, there is no evidence that they did so.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;

[[File:Map Greece expansion 1832-1947-en.svg|thumb|The territorial expansion of Greece, 1832–1947.]]

The '''Megali Idea''' ({{lang-el|Μεγάλη Ιδέα}}, ''Megáli Idéa'', "Great Idea")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AjDYlMB9amwC|title=The Mediterranean in the Age of Globalization: Migration, Welfare &amp; Borders|last=Mateos|first=Natalia Ribas|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[irredentist]] concept of [[Greek nationalism]] that expressed the goal of establishing a Greek state that would encompass all historically ethnic [[Greeks|Greek]]-inhabited areas, including the large Greek populations that were still under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule after the end of the [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821–1828) and all the regions that traditionally belonged to Greeks in ancient times (the Southern Balkans, Anatolia and Cyprus).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsd.uib.no/european_election_database/country/greece/introduction.html "Introduction: Greece"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term appeared for the first time during the debates of [[Prime Ministers of Greece|Prime Minister]] [[Ioannis Kolettis]] with [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]] that preceded the promulgation of the 1844 constitution.&lt;ref name="BA0"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-26420 ''History of Greece''] Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt; This was a visionary nationalist aspiration that was to dominate foreign relations and, to a significant extent, determine domestic politics of the Greek state for much of the first century of independence. The expression was new in 1844 but the concept had roots in the Greek popular psyche. It long had hopes of liberation from Turkish rule and restoration of the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref name="BA0" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Πάλι με χρόνια με καιρούς,
:πάλι δικά μας θα 'ναι!
(''Once more, as years and time go by, once more they shall be ours'').&lt;ref name="BK0"&gt;D. Bolukbasi and D. Bölükbaşı, ''Turkey And Greece: The Aegean Disputes'', Routledge Cavendish 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Megali Idea'' implied the goal of reviving the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, by establishing a [[Greece|Greek state]], which would be, as ancient geographer [[Strabo]] wrote, a Greek world encompassing mostly the former Byzantine lands from the [[Ionian Sea]] to the west, to [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Black Sea]] to the east and from [[Thrace]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Epirus]] to the north, to [[Crete]] and [[Cyprus]] to the south. This new state would have [[Constantinople]] as its capital: it would be the "Greece of Two Continents and Five Seas" (Europe and Asia, the Ionian, Aegean, Marmara, Black and Libyan seas, respectively).

The ''Megali Idea'' dominated foreign policy and domestic politics of [[Greece]] from the [[Greek War of Independence|War of Independence]] in the 1820s through the [[Balkan wars]] in the beginning of the 20th century. It started to fade after the defeat of Greece in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)]] and the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]] in 1922, followed by the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] in 1923. Despite the end of the Megali Idea project in 1922, the Greek state expanded five times in its history, either through military conquest or diplomacy (often with British support). After the creation of Greece in 1830, it later annexed the [[Ionian Islands]] ([[Treaty of London, 1864]]), [[Thessaly]] ([[Convention of Constantinople (1881)]]), [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Crete]], [[Epirus (region)|southern Epirus]] and the Eastern Aegean Islands ([[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)]]), [[Western Thrace]] ([[Treaty of Neuilly]], 1920) and the [[Dodecanese]] ([[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947]]), making them Greek territory.

==Fall of Constantinople==

Though the [[Byzantine Empire]] was [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] in origin and was called the "Roman Empire" by its inhabitants and the entire world, until some 120 years after its fall, when [[Hieronymus Wolf]] coined the usage of Byzantium. It became [[Byzantium under the Heraclians|Hellenistic with time to the point where Greek replaced Latin as the official language]] in AD 610, owing to several factors: Its religion, being Christian, with the New Testament written in Greek; its location in the Greek-speaking realm and sphere of influence; and the fact that, following the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], it became the eastern continuation of the Roman Empire. Byzantium held out against the invasions of the centuries with a vitality that the Western Roman Empire lost, repelling the Visigoths, the Huns, the Saracens, the Mongols and finally the Turks (during the first siege). Constantinople, the capital of Byzantium, fell to the [[Fourth Crusade]]rs in the early years of the 13th century. The city was eventually liberated by the [[Empire of Nicaea]], a Byzantine successor, and the Empire was restored. However, the city fell to a different foe in 1453—the Ottoman Turks—and this fall of Constantinople marked the nadir of Byzantine civilization; the city was comprehensively sacked and looted; the [[Hagia Sophia]] was turned into a mosque. Following the conquest of Constantinople, the capture of the remainder of the Byzantine territories was easily accomplished by the Ottomans.

== Greeks under Ottoman rule==
{{Further information|Ottoman Greece}}
In the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millet]] system in force during the [[Ottoman empire]], the population was classified according to religion rather than language or ethnicity. Orthodox Greeks were seen as part of the ''millet-i Rûm'' (literally "Roman community") which included all [[Orthodox Christians]], including besides Greeks also [[Bulgarians]], [[Serbs]], [[Vlachs]], [[Slavs]], [[Georgians]], [[Arabs]], [[Romanians]] and [[Albanians]], despite their differences in ethnicity and language and despite the fact that the religious hierarchy was Greek dominated. It is not clear to what extent one can speak of a Greek identity during those times as opposed to a Christian or Orthodox identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Greece: The Modern Sequel |last1=Koliopoulos |first1=John S. |last2=Veremis |first2=Thanos |year=2007 |publisher=C Hurst &amp; Co Publishers Ltd |location= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1780s, [[Catherine II of Russia]] and [[Joseph II of Austria]] intended to reclaim the Byzantine heritage and restore the Greek statehood as part of their joint [[Greek Plan]].

It is notable that during the Middle Ages and the Ottoman period, Greek-speaking Christians identified as ''Romans'' and thought of themselves as the descendants of the [[Roman Empire]] (including the Medieval [[Eastern Roman Empire]]). Indeed, the term ''Roman'' was often interpreted as synonymous with ''Christian'' throughout Europe and the Mediterranean during this time. The terms ''Greek'' or ''Hellene'' were largely seen by Ottoman Christians as referring to the ancient pagan peoples of the region. This, however, changed during the late stages of the Ottoman Empire and the emergence of the Greek independence movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Standard Languages and Multilingualism in European History | editor1=Honing, Matthias|editor2=Vogl, Ulrik|editor3=Moliner, Olivier | publisher=John Benjamins| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tXAc72rjwBcC | page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Hellenisms: Culture, Identity, and Ethnicity from Antiquity to Modernity | editor= Zacharia, Katerina | publisher=Ashgate Publishing | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H1fGJRxUG6wC | page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek War of Independence==

|source=Kolettis voicing his convictions in the National Assembly in January 1844.&lt;ref&gt;Smith M., ''Ionian Vision'', (1999), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the [[Greek War of Independence]] ended in 1829, a new Southern Greek state was established, with assistance from the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and [[Imperial Russia]]. However, this new Greek state under [[John Capodistria]] after the [[Greek War of Independence]] was, with Serbia, one of the only two countries of the era whose population was smaller than the population of the same ethnicity outside its borders; most of ethnic Greeks still resided within the borders of Ottoman Empire.  This version of  Greece was designed by the [[Great Powers]], who had no desire to see a larger Greek state supplant the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The Great Idea embodied a desire to bring all ethnic Greeks into the Greek state, and subsequently revive the [[Byzantine Empire]]; specifically those Greeks in [[Epirus]], [[Thessaly]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Thrace]], the [[Aegean Islands]], [[Crete]], [[Cyprus]], parts of [[Anatolia]], and the city of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], which would replace [[Athens]] as capital.

When the young Danish prince [[George I of Greece|Wilhelm Georg]] was elected king in 1863, the title offered to him by the Greek National Assembly was ''not'' "King of Greece", the title of his deposed predecessor, King [[Otto of Greece|Otto]]; but rather "King of ''the [[Hellene]]s''". Implicit in the wording was that George I was to be king of all Greeks, regardless of whether they then lived within the borders of his new kingdom.

The first areas to be incorporated into the Kingdom were the [[Ionian islands]] in 1864, and later [[Thessaly]] with the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)]].

[[File:King Constantine I of Greece, by Georges Scott.png|thumb|left|140px|[[Constantine I of Greece]] was called ''Constantine XII'' by his supporters, the legitimate successor to the Emperor [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]]]]
[[File:Ελευθέριος Βενιζέλος.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Eleftherios Venizelos]], the radical politician who tried to realize the Megali Idea]]

In January 1897, violence and disorder were escalating in [[Crete]], polarizing the population. Massacres of the Christian population took place in Chania and Rethimno. The Greek government, pressured by public opinion, intransigent political elements, extreme nationalist groups (e.g. [[Ethniki Etairia]]) and with the Great Powers reluctant to intervene, decided to send warships and personnel to assist the Cretans. The Great Powers had no option then but to proceed with the occupation of the island, but they were too late. A Greek force of 1,500 men had landed at Kolymbari on 1 February 1897, and its commanding officer, Colonel [[Timoleon Vassos]], declared that he was taking over the island "in the name of the King of the Hellenes" and that he was announcing the union of Crete with Greece. This led to an uprising that spread immediately throughout the island. The Great Powers finally decided to land their troops and stopped the Greek army force from approaching Chania. At the same time their fleets blockaded Crete, preventing both Greeks and Turks from bringing any more troops to the island.

The Ottoman Empire, in reaction to the rebellion of Crete and the assistance sent by Greece, relocated a significant part of its army in the Balkans to the north of Thessaly, close to the borders with Greece. Greece in reply reinforced its borders in Thessaly. However, irregular Greek forces and followers of the Megali Idea acted without orders and raided Turkish outposts, leading the Ottoman Empire to declare war on Greece; the war is known as the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1897]]. The Turkish army, far outnumbering the Greek, was also better prepared, due to the recent reforms carried out by a German mission under [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz|Baron von der Goltz]]. The Greek army fell back in retreat. The other Great Powers then intervened and an armistice was signed in May 1897. The war, however, only ended in December of that year.

The military defeat of Greece in the Greco-Turkish war cost it small territorial losses along the border line in northern Thessaly, and a large sum of financial reparations that wrecked Greece's economy for years, while giving no lasting solution to the Cretan Question. The Great Powers (Britain, France, Russia, and Italy) in order to prevent future clashes and trying to avoid the creation of a revanchist climate in Greece, imposed what they thought of as the final solution on the Cretan Question: Crete was proclaimed an autonomous ''[[Cretan State]]''. The four Great Powers assumed the administration of Crete; and, in a decisive diplomatic victory for Greece, Prince George of Greece (second son of King George I) became High Commissioner.

==Early 20th century==

===Balkan Wars===
{{Main article|Greece in the Balkan Wars}}
[[File:Maximal Greek claims in Epirus and Macedonia.png|thumb|200px|Greek claims in Epirus and Macedonia after the first Balkan war]]
[[File:New Greece.jpg|thumb|200px|Poster celebrating the "New Hellas" after the [[Balkan Wars]].]]

A major proponent of the Megali Idea was [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], under whose leadership Greek territory doubled in the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912–13 — southern [[Epirus]], [[Crete]], [[Lesbos]], [[Chios]], [[Samos]] along with the totality of Aegean Islands and the majority of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] were attached to Greece. Born and raised in Crete, in 1909 Venizelos was already a prominent Cretan and had influence in mainland Greece. As such, he was chosen after the [[Goudi coup]] in 1909 to become Prime Minister of Greece. A proponent of the ''Megali Idea'', Venizelos pressed forward a series of reforms in society, as well as the military and administration, which helped Greece succeed in its goals during the Balkan Wars.

===World War I===
{{Main article|Greece during World War I|Treaty of Sèvres}}
[[File:Greece in the Treaty of Sèvres.jpg|thumb|200px|Map of Megali Hellas after the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] and featuring a picture of [[Eleftherios Venizelos]].]]

The ongoing [[Greek genocide]] and refugees speaking of Turkish atrocities as well as a victory in [[World War I]] seemed to promise an even greater realization of the Megali Idea. Greece gained in Asia Minor the administration of [[Smyrna]] and its hinterland for five years (after with a referendum it could be incorporated), the islands of [[Imbros]] and [[Tenedos]], [[Western Thrace|Western]] and [[Eastern Thrace]], the border then drawn a few miles from the walls of [[Constantinople]]: the Imperial City seemed within reach.

===Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)===
{{Main article|Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)}}
[[File:Izmir15Mayis1919.jpg|thumb|200px|Greek soldiers in Smyrna, May 1919.]]

A major defeat followed in 1922, however, when the [[Turkish revolutionaries]] defeated and expelled the Greeks from Anatolia during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]]. The [[Treaty of Lausanne]] saw Greece lose Eastern Thrace, Imbros and Tenedos, [[Smyrna]] and the possibility of staying in [[Anatolia]]. To avoid any further territorial claims, both Greece and Turkey engaged in an "[[exchange of populations]]": During the conflict, 151,892 Greeks had already fled Asia Minor. The Treaty of Lausanne moved 1,104,216 Greeks from Turkey,&lt;ref&gt;André Billy, ''La Grèce'', Arthaud, 1937, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; while 380,000 Turks left the Greek territory for Turkey. Also, in Greece had also moved (after WWI) 40,027 Greeks from Bulgaria, 58,522 from Russia (because of the defeat of Wrangel) and 10,080 from other lands (for example [[Dodecanese]] or [[Albania]]), while 60,000 Bulgarians from [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] had moved to [[Bulgaria]].

The immediate reception of refugees to Greece cost 45 million francs, so the League of Nations arranged for a loan of 150 million francs to aid settlement of refugees. In 1930, Venizelos even went on an official visit to [[Turkey]], where he proposed that [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]] be awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

== World War II, annexation of Dodecanese and the Cyprus dispute ==
{{See also|Military history of Greece during World War II|EOKA|1974 Cypriot coup d'état}}

Although the Great Idea ceased to be a driving force behind Greek foreign policy, some remnants continued to influence Greek foreign policy throughout the remainder of the 20th century.

Thus, after his coup d'état of 4 August 1936, [[Ioannis Metaxas]] proclaimed the advent of the "Third Hellenic Civilization", similar to Adolf Hitler's Third Reich.&lt;ref&gt;R. Clogg, op. Cit, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The attack by Italy from Albania and the Greek victories enabled Greece to conquer, during the winter of 1940–1941, parts of southern [[Albania]] ([[Northern Epirus]], as it is identified by [[Greeks]]) which were administered as a province of Greece for a short time until the German offensive of April 1941.

The occupation, resistance and the [[Greek civil war|civil war]] initially put the Great Idea in the background. Nevertheless, another very good diplomatic performance by the Greek side at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1946]] secured a further enlargement of Greek territory, in the form of the Dodecanese Islands, despite the very strong opposition of [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and the Soviet delegates.&lt;ref&gt;K. Svolopoulos, Greek Foreign Policy 1945–1981. Cit, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet opposition was also the main reason for the non incorporation of the [[Northern Epirus]], since Albania was, after WW2, communist controlled.

The British colony of [[Cyprus]] became the "apple of discord" in Greco-Turkish relations. In 1955, a [[Hellenic Army|Greek army]] colonel of Greek Cypriot origin, [[George Grivas]], began a campaign of civil disobedience whose purpose was primarily to drive the British from the island, then move for ''[[Enosis]]'' with Greece. The Greek Prime Minister, [[Alexandros Papagos]], was not unfavourable to this idea.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} There was increasing polarisation of opinion between the dominant Greek population and the minority Turks.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The problems in Cyprus affected the continent itself. In September 1955, in response to the demand for ''Énosis'', an anti-Greek riot took place in Istanbul. During the [[Istanbul Pogrom]] 4,000 stores, 100 hotels and restaurants and 70 churches were destroyed or damaged.&lt;ref&gt;R. Clogg, op. Cit, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the last great wave of migration from Turkey to Greece.

[[File:Cyprus districts named.png|thumb|200px|The partition of Cyprus showing the [[Northern Cyprus|Turkish-occupied north]] and government controlled south.]]

The [[Zürich and London Agreement|Zürich Agreement]] of 1959 culminated in independence of the island within the [[British Commonwealth]]. The inter-ethnic clashes from 1960 led to the dispatch of a [[United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus|peacekeeping force]] of the [[United Nations Organisation|United Nations]] in 1964.

The Cyprus issue was revived by the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|dictatorship of the colonels]], who presented their April 21, 1967, ''coup d'état'' as the only way to defend the traditional values of what they called the "Hellenic-Christian Civilization".

{{cquote|Youth of Greece ... you recall, in your heart and your faith, the deep sense of sacrifice. It dates back to [[Leonidas]], "[[Molon labe|Come and take them]]!", to Constantine XI, "I do not wish to give the City.", and Metaxás, "No!". It is in the "Stop or I draw!".|April 21, 1967|&lt;ref&gt;R. Clogg, op. Cit, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Against the backdrop of the oil crisis in the Aegean, Brigadier General Ioannidis arranged, in July 1974, to overthrow Cypriot President [[Archbishop]] [[Makarios III|Makarios]], and proceed to ''[[Enosis]]'' with Greece.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} This led to an immediate reaction from Turkey. Turkey invaded the north part of the island. The two countries moved to a general mobilization and there was a well-founded fear of an imminent war with Turkey.

==Today==
{{See also|Greco-Turkish relations}}

Today, there is no significant population of Greeks in Turkey, due to the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] and the [[Greek genocide]]. There are several extant Greek–Turkish border disputes, most notably taking place at [[Imia/Kardak]].

Relations between Greece and Turkey improved after the Greek aid sent after the [[1999 İzmit earthquake]] and the Turkish aid sent after the [[1999 Athens earthquake]]. This period of mutual reconciliation is known as the [[Greek-Turkish earthquake diplomacy|earthquake diplomacy]], and Greco-Turkish relations have been more cordial since then.

The [[Greek nationalism|nationalist]] [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn party]], which has had a recent surge in electoral support, supports the Megali Idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=el:Μιχαλολιάκος: Του χρόνου στην Κωνσταντινούπολη, στην Σμύρνη, στην Τραπεζούντα…|url=http://www.stoxos.gr/2012/12/blog-post_7247.html|accessdate=3 November 2013|newspaper=[[Stochos]]|date=31 December 2012|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moussa Ibrahim''' ({{lang-ar|موسى إبراهيم}} ; [[Romanization of Arabic|romanized]] also as ''Mussa'' and ''Musa'', born 7 December 1974) is a [[Libya]]n political figure who rose to international attention in 2011 as [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s [[Information minister|Information Minister]] and official spokesman, serving in this role until the government was toppled in the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]]. Ibrahim held frequent press conferences in the course of the war, denouncing [[National Liberation Army (Libya)|rebel forces]] and the [[NATO]]-led [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military intervention]], often in defiant and impassioned tones. His status and whereabouts remained unknown following the [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)|Battle of Tripoli]] in which the Gaddafi government was overthrown, although there were several claims and subsequent refutations of his capture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20016076 "Libya: Confusion at fate of Gaddafi aide Moussa Ibrahim"]. BBC News. 21 October 2012. Retrieved 22 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, in late 2014, it was discovered he was in Egypt before he was deported and fled to Serbia. On 12 January 2015 Moussa Ibrahim spoke publicly by video link at a political event hosted at the Committee Rooms Houses of Parliament, Westminster, London from an undisclosed location, also the Director of Private Security Company.  

== Biography ==
Ibrahim was born on 7 December 1974 into Gaddafi's [[Qadhadhfa]] tribe. He studied politics at the [[University of Exeter]] in the early 2000s, where he met his future wife Julia Ramelow, a German-born theology student, with whom he has a young son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/uk-loving-true-believer-sells-gaddafis-message/story-e6frg6so-1226036217419 "UK-loving true believer sells Gaddafi's message"]. ''The Australian''. 11 April 2011. Retrieved 20 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked on a PhD in media arts at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]], completing his final exam in May 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Coward | first = Ros | author-link = Rosalind Coward | title = My Christmas with Gaddafi's spokesman | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/25/my-christmas-with-gaddafis-spokesman | date = 25 October 2011 | access-date = 12 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although he has not formally received his doctorate as supervisors are awaiting a small number of required amendments to his thesis. One of Ibrahim's lecturers at the University of Exeter, Dr. [[Larbi Sadiki]], described him as an engaging, friendly but serious student&amp;nbsp;— "a nice guy but with a short fuse."&lt;ref name=BBC-Kelly-1&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kelly|first=Jon|title=Moussa Ibrahim: How Libya's voice was shaped in Britain|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12918246|publisher=BBC News Magazine|accessdate=2 April 2011|date=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told [[Sky News]]: "I lived in London for 15 years.

On 19 August 2011, his brother was allegedly killed by an [[Apache helicopter]] in [[Zawiya, Libya|Zawiya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/08/18/libya.war/|work=CNN|title=Brother of Libya's information minister reported killed in NATO strike|date=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)|Battle of Tripoli]], he called for a ceasefire and blamed NATO and the West for the situation, saying that the conflicting parties should sit down and negotiate; although he also said that thousands of professional soldiers were ready to defend Tripoli against rebel forces staging an uprising within the capital, as well those advancing towards the city from [[Zawiya, Libya|Zawiya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14606749|work=BBC News|date=21 August 2011|title=Libya conflict: Rebels push towards Tripoli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was incorrectly reported by [[Misrata]]-based Freedom TV on 29 September 2011 that Ibrahim had been captured near [[Sirte]] by [[National Transitional Council|NTC]] fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-09/29/c_131168143.htm|title=Gaddafi's spokesman arrested near Sirte: TV|work=Xinhua|date=29 September 2011|accessdate=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; No independent confirmation was forthcoming, and the report was denied by a pro-Gaddafi TV channel. Later that day a spokesman for the Misrata military council, Adel Ibrahim, told [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] "We cannot confirm he was arrested", and two days later an NTC commander admitted they had not captured him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/312204|title=NTC commander admits did not capture Moussa Ibrahim|publisher=Digital Journal|first=Katerina|last=Nikolas|date=1 October 2011|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 October 2011, Reuters reported that Ibrahim had been captured near [[Sirte]], according to a Libyan transitional forces commander;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFL5E7LK3CW20111020|title=Gaddafi spokesman Moussa Ibrahim captured --NTC|agency=Reuters|work=Reuters Africa|date=20 October 2011|accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this was again proven to be untrue. On 22 October 2011, he was reportedly captured for a third time, along with [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]], near [[Bani Walid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/313227 |title=Libya's NTC claim Saif al-Islam Gaddafi captured alive, uninjured|publisher=Digital Journal|first=Katerina |last=Nikolas|date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim was also discredited, as Saif was not captured until 19 November near the town of Ubari. On 20 January 2012, it was reported for the fourth time that Ibrahim had been captured in [[Asbi'a]], Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/home/world-news/article/16153453|title=Reports: Former Gaddafi Spokesman Captured |publisher=SKY News|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the following day these claims were denied by officials in [[Tripoli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/inspectors-uncover-gaddafis-secret-stash-of-chemical-weapons-6292670.html|title=Inspectors uncover Gaddafi's secret stash of chemical weapons|work=The Independent | location=London|first=Andy|last=McSmith|date=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NEAR.JPG|right|thumb|The N.E.A.R. Warning Device.]]
The '''National Emergency Alarm Repeater''' (NEAR) was a civilian emergency warning device in the United States. It was a 2–3" (5–7.5&amp;nbsp;cm) square box  designed to plug into a standard [[Power outlet#NEMA 1-15|power outlet]] to receive a special signal sent over the [[electric power transmission]] lines.  Research and testing for the NEAR program was developed in 1956 during the Cold War to supplement the existing siren [[warning systems]] and radio broadcasts in the event of a [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] attack. The advent of the radio [[Emergency Broadcast System]] rendered NEAR obsolete, although a severe disadvantage inherent in the Emergency Broadcast System was that it required a television or radio to be turned on for a household to receive the emergency alarm, whereas NEAR did not. Despite this advantage, upon the introduction of the Emergency Broadcast System, stockpiled NEAR repeaters were destroyed by their respective manufacturers.&lt;ref name=pbs.org&gt;{{cite web|title=Investigations: N.E.A.R Device (Transcript)|publisher=PBS|work=''207 KB'', History Detectives |url=http://www-tc.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/static/media/transcripts/2011-05-22/709_near.pdf|format=[[PDF]]}}  August 2009. No. 8, season 7. Retrieved 23 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar program was proposed in the United Kingdom during the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Personal communication: Wayne Gilbert, 4 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Time magazine article==
A [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] article in the November 14, 1960 issue&lt;ref name=time/&gt; outlined a new program supplementing the then "basically unsound" warning system consisting of localized sirens and the [[CONELRAD]] radio-alert system.

The [[U.S. Army]] argued that in the age of [[intercontinental ballistic missiles]] a civil-defense warning system should be capable of warning 90% of the population within 30 seconds after a signal is given by the national civil-defense center in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]].

The device is a buzzer installed into ordinary electrical outlets. The devices would be set off in an emergency by altering the regular AC signal being generated and transmitted by the local power companies. This would be done by having a specific alternating current of a specific frequency superimposed upon it; the imposed current would be generated by special generators and would be at 270&amp;nbsp;Hz at 3&amp;nbsp;volts RMS for 50,000&amp;nbsp;cycles ({{US Patent|3284791}}),&lt;ref name=near_patent&gt;{{cite patent

problems with NEAR might have included limited instructions on what to do when an alert was received and the device's inability to provide information on what exactly was happening.

The '''New Fourth Army''' ({{Zh|t=新四軍|s=新四军|p=Xīn Sì Jūn}}) was a unit of the [[National Revolutionary Army]] of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] established in 1937. In contrast to most of the National Revolutionary Army, it was controlled by the [[Communist Party of China]] and not by the ruling [[Kuomintang]]. The New Fourth Army and the [[Eighth Route Army]] were the two main communist forces from 1938. The New Fourth Army was active south of the [[Yangtze River]] (Chang Jiang), while the Eighth Route Army was based in [[Yan'an]] in the northwest.

Members of the New Fourth Army wore their [[badge]]s on the left arm, with ''"N4A"'' and the soldier's unit and name listed on the badge.

After the [[Xi'an Incident]], the [[Kuomintang]] led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the [[Communist Party of China]] led by [[Mao Zedong]] formed a [[Second United Front|United Front]] against Japan, which was already in control of [[Manchuria]] and pushing into North China. The [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] in July 1937 marked the beginning of the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)]].

In October, 1937, an announcement was made that Red Army soldiers active in the eight provinces in southern China &amp;mdash; those who did not embark on the [[Long March]] would be part of the New Fourth Army. The New Fourth Army was established on December 25, 1937 in [[Hankou]], moving to [[Nanchang]] on January 6, 1938, when the detachments began marching to the battlefront. At the beginning, the New Fourth Army had four detachments and one task force battalion and numbered roughly ten thousand. Later the army moved to [[Anhui|Anhui province]]. [[Ye Ting]] was the army commander, [[Xiang Ying]] the deputy army commander.

It was in theory a united front against Japan but in practice there was friction between Nationalist and Communist Forces, which intensified in the fall of 1940, culminating in the [[New Fourth Army Incident]] with a full-fledged battle between the New Fourth Army and KMT [[National Revolutionary Army]] forces. Up until that point, most of the battles had been [[skirmish]]es. The army was fully reorganised after the incident and remained in active combat until the end of the war.

The '''North Korea Peace Museum''' is in the building constructed to house the signing of the [[Korean War]] [[Korean Armistice Agreement|Armistice Agreement]] on 27 July 1953. It is located in the former village of [[Panmunjeom]] (P'anmunjŏm) in [[North Hwanghae Province]], [[North Korea]].

It is located approximately {{convert|1.2|km|mi}} north-west of the [[Joint Security Area]] (JSA), in the northern half of the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarized Zone]]. The building is all that remains of the former village, and since the mid-1950s, references to Panmunjom actually refer to the Joint Security Area itself. It is about {{convert|1.9|km|mi}} north-east of [[Kijong-dong]], often referred to as ''Propaganda Village''.

The weapons used to kill U.S. Army Captain Arthur Bonifas and Lieutenant Mark Barrett in the [[axe murder incident]] of 1976 are housed within the Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/mark-seddon-how-to-take-the-heat-out-of-the-north-korean-crisis-8565515.html |title=How to take the heat out of the North Korean crisis |author=Mark Seddon |newspaper=Evening Standard |date=9 April 2013 |accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a symbol of a dove above the door. At the time of the signing of the armistice, a copy of [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''The Dove'' was hanging inside the building. The Americans objected to it as a symbol of Communism (Picasso was a Communist), and it was covered up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jager | first = Sheila Miyoshi | authorlink = Sheila Miyoshi Jager| title = Brothers at War – The Unending Conflict in Korea | year = 2013 | publisher = Profile Books | location = London | isbn = 978-1-84668-067-0|pp=284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oil imperialism theories''' assert that direct and indirect control of world [[petroleum]] reserves is a root factor in current [[international politics]].

==Control of oil==
While economists and historians agree that access to and control of the access of others to important resources has throughout history been a factor in warfare and in diplomacy, oil imperialism theorists generally tend to assert that control of petroleum reserves has played an overriding role in international politics since [[World War I]]. In recent years, oil resources were certainly important considerations behind the [[Gulf War]], the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], and the [[Libyan Crisis]]. Some theories hold that access to oil defined 20th-century [[empire]]s and was the key to the ascendance of the [[United States]] as the world's sole [[superpower]], and explained how a transitioning country like [[Russia]] was able to obtain rapid GDP growth for a time (see [[Economy of the Soviet Union]]).

'''Paul Hausser''' (7 October 1880 – 21 December 1972) was a high-ranking commander in the ''[[Waffen-SS]]'' of [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]] who played a key role in the post-war efforts by former members of the ''Waffen-SS'' to [[HIAG#Effectiveness|achieve historical and legal rehabilitation]].

Hausser served as an officer in the [[Prussian Army]] during [[World War I]] and attained the rank of general in the inter-war ''[[Reichsheer]]''. After retirement, he joined the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) of [[Nazi Germany]] and was instrumental in forming the ''Waffen-SS''. During [[World War II]], he rose to the level of army group commander. He led ''Waffen-SS'' troops in the [[Third Battle of Kharkov]], the [[Battle of Kursk]] and the [[Operation Overlord|Normandy Campaign]]. Hausser was the highest-ranking officer in the ''Waffen-SS'' alongside [[Sepp Dietrich]]. Unlike Dietrich, Hausser was a professional staff officer before joining the SS.

After the war Hausser became a founding member and the first spokesperson of [[HIAG]], a lobby group and a [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] veterans' organisation, founded by former high-ranking ''Waffen-SS'' personnel in [[West Germany]] in 1951. It campaigned for the restoration of legal and economic rights of the ''Waffen-SS'' employing a multi-prong propaganda campaign to achieve its aims.

Hausser wrote two books, published by right-wing imprints, arguing the purely military role of the ''Waffen-SS'' and advancing the notion that its troops were "soldiers like any other", according to the title of the second book. Under Hausser's leadership, HIAG reshaped the image of the ''Waffen-SS'' as a so-called pan-European force that fought honorably and had no part in war crimes or Nazi atrocities. These ideas have since been discredited by historians.
{{TOC limit}}

==Early life and military career==
Hausser was born on 7 October 1880 in [[Brandenburg an der Havel]] into a [[Prussian Army|Prussian military]] family and entered the army in 1892. In 1899, he graduated from a cadet academy and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 155th (7th West Prussian) Infantry Regiment. Hausser graduated from the [[Prussian Military Academy]] in [[Berlin]] in 1911. Hausser married Elisabeth Gerard in 1912; the couple had one daughter who was born in December 1913.{{sfn|Mitcham|2009|pp=81–82}}

During [[World War I]] he served in the [[German General Staff]] and in staff roles on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], primarily serving with the [[109th Infantry Division (German Empire)|109th Infantry Division]] between 1916 and 1918. He was promoted to major in 1918 and was retained in the postwar ''[[Reichswehr]]'', reaching the rank of ''[[Oberst]]'' (colonel) by 1927.{{sfn|Mitcham|2009|pp=81–82}}

Hausser retired from the ''Reichswehr'' in 1932 with the rank of ''Generalleutnant'', having filled various appointments including chief of staff of ''Wehrkreis II'' (Military District 2) in Stettin, commander of the 10th Infantry Regiment, and deputy commander of the 4th Infantry Division.{{sfn|Mitcham|2009|p= 82}} Hausser joined the right-wing World War I veterans' organization ''[[Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Stahlhelm]]'', becoming the head of its [[Brandenburg]]-[[Berlin]] chapter in 1933. Soon after, the ''Stahlhelm'' was incorporated into the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA), and, with the SA's demise, into the SS.{{sfn|Williamson|2006|p=7}}

==Waffen-SS career==
In November 1934 Hausser was transferred to the ''[[SS-Verfügungstruppe]]'' (SS Dispositional Troops; SS-VT) and assigned to the [[SS-Junkerschule Bad Tölz|SS officer training school]].{{sfn|Williamson|2006|p=7}} He became the Inspector of the SS-VT in 1936.{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|p=146}} In this role, Hausser was in charge of the troop's military and ideological training, but did not have command authority. The decision on deployment of the troops remained in [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]]'s hands. This aligned with Hitler's intentions to maintain these troops exclusively at his disposal, "neither [a part] of the army, nor of the police", according to Hitler's order of 17 August 1938.{{sfn|Tauber Volume I|1967|pp=335–336}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 192-305, KZ-Mauthausen, Himmlervisite.jpg|thumb|Paul Hausser (far right, in overcoat) walking up the Stairs of Death at the [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]], June 1941.]]
Hausser served during the 1939 [[invasion of Poland]] as an observer with the mixed ''Wehrmacht''/SS [[Panzer Division Kempf|Panzer Division ''Kempf'']]. In October 1939 the SS-VT was formed as a motorized infantry division known as the [[SS-Verfügungs-Division|SS-''Verfügungs''-Division]] with Hausser in command.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=32}} He led the division, later renamed [[2nd SS Division Das Reich]], through the [[Battle of France|French campaign]] of 1940 and in the early stages of [[Operation Barbarossa]].{{sfn|Mitcham|2009|p=83}} For his service in the Soviet Union, Hausser was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] in 1941 and the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves#Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves (mit Eichenlaub)|Oak Leaves]] in 1943 (he received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|Swords]] for his service in Normandy) and was severely wounded, losing an eye.{{sfn|Williamson|2006|pp=7–8}}

After recovering, he commanded the newly formed SS-Panzer Corps (renamed [[II SS Panzer Corps]] in June 1943) and against Hitler's explicit orders withdrew his troops from [[Kharkov]] to avoid encirclement. He led the [[1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler|1st]], [[2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich|2nd]] and [[3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf|3rd]] SS divisions during the [[Battle of Kursk]].{{sfn|Healy|1992|p=73}} After Kursk, his Corps was reformed (substituting the 1st, 2nd and 3rd SS Panzer Divisions with the [[9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen|9th]] and [[10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg|10th]] SS divisions) and sent to Italy, then to France where he commanded them in the early stages of the [[Operation Overlord|Normandy Campaign]].{{sfn|Mitcham|2009|p=81}}

After the death of [[Friedrich Dollmann]], commander of the [[7th Army (Wehrmacht)|Seventh Army]], Hausser was promoted to its command. During the [[Falaise pocket|Falaise encirclement]] in 1944, Hausser was seriously wounded (shot through the jaw). Hausser was promoted to SS-''[[Oberst-Gruppenführer]]'' in August 1944 and subsequently commanded [[Army Group Oberrhein (Germany)|Army Group Oberrhein]] and later [[Army Group G]] until 3 April 1945. On the day he was relieved, [[Joseph Goebbels]] wrote, "He has definitely not stood the test." He ended the war on ''Generalfeldmarschall'' [[Albert Kesselring]]'s staff.{{sfn|Williamson|2006|p=8}} At the [[Nuremberg Trials]] he claimed that the ''Waffen-SS'' only had a military role and denied that it was involved in war crimes and atrocities.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=250}}

==Post-war activities==

===Work for U.S. Army Historical Division===
Following the war, Hausser participated in the work of the [[U.S. Army Historical Division]], where under the guidance of [[Franz Halder]], German generals wrote World War II operational studies for the [[U.S. Army]], first as POWs and then as employees. In the late 1940s, Hausser authored an operational study on the Seventh Army's response to the Allied Normandy breakout. The study, together with contributions from [[Rudolf Christoph von Gersdorff]], [[Heinrich Freiherr von Lüttwitz]], [[Wilhelm Fahrmbacher]] and [[Heinrich Eberbach]], was published in 2004 as ''Fighting the Breakout: The German Army in Normandy from COBRA to the Falaise Gap''.{{sfn|Kienle|2005}}

===Leader of ''Waffen-SS'' lobby group===
From 1950, Hausser was active in [[HIAG]], a [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] organization and a [[advocacy group|lobby group]] of former ''Waffen-SS'' members. HIAG began in the late 1950 as a loose association of local groups; by October 1951, however, it claimed to embrace 376 local branches across [[West Germany]]. In December 1951, Hausser became its first spokesperson.{{sfn|Large|1987}}

With the publication of its first periodical in late 1951, HIAG was beginning to draw attention to itself and generate public controversy, including speculation that it was a neo-Nazi organization. In response, Hausser wrote an open letter to the ''[[Bundestag]]'' denying these accusations and describing the HIAG as an advocacy organisation for former ''Waffen-SS'' troops. Hausser asserted that its members rejected all forms of radicalism and were "upstanding citizens".{{sfn|Large|1987|pp=82–83}}

As part of its lobbying efforts, HIAG attempted to "manipulate historical record or simply to ignore it", according to the historian David C. Large, who studied HIAG in the 1980s.{{sfn|Large|1987|p=81}} HIAG's rewriting of history included significant multi-prong [[Propaganda|propaganda efforts]], including tendentious periodicals, books and public speeches, along with the publishing house of Munin Verlag, to serve as a platform for its publicity aims. The express aim of Munin Verlag was to publish the "war narratives" of former ''Waffen-SS'' members, in cooperation with HIAG.{{sfn|Wilke|2011|p=399}}{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|p=138}}

===Memoirs===
Paul Hausser's 1953 book ''[[Waffen-SS in Action|Waffen-SS im Einsatz]]'' ("Waffen-SS in Action") was the first major work by one of the HIAG leaders. It was published by {{Illm|Plesse Verlag|de|Plesse-Verlag}}, owned by a right-wing politician and publisher {{illm|Waldemar Schütz|de|Waldemar Schütz}}. A foreword from the former ''Wehrmacht'' General [[Heinz Guderian]] provided an endorsement for the ''Waffen-SS'' troops and referred to them as "the first realization of the European idea".{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|pp=137–138}}

The book described the growth of ''Waffen-SS'' into a multinational force where foreign volunteers fought heroically as a "militant example of the great European idea".{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|pp=137–138}} Historians have refuted this characterisation, arguing that it was largely Nazi propaganda employed to bolster the ranks of the ''Waffen-SS'' with foreign volunteers. The message was later repurposed by HIAG as it sought historical and legal rehabilitation of the force.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|pp=137–138}} ''Waffen-SS in Action'' was included in the index of objectionable war books maintained by West Germany's [[Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons]]. The index was created in the early 1960s to limit the sale of such works to minors due to their [[chauvinism]] and glorification of violence.{{sfn|Tauber Volume I|1967|p=539}}

Hausser later wrote another book, published in 1966 by HIAG's imprint {{illm|Munin Verlag|de|Munin-Verlag}}, under the title ''Soldaten wie andere auch'' ("Soldiers Like Any Other"). According to the military historian [[Simon MacKenzie|S.P. MacKenzie]], the work epitomised how HIAG leaders wanted the ''Waffen-SS'' to be remembered, while the historian Charles Sydnor described it as "equally tendentious".{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|p=137}}{{sfn|Sydnor|1973}}

Hausser's books, along with those by other key HIAG members and former ''Waffen-SS'' Generals [[Felix Steiner]] and [[Kurt Meyer]], have been characterised by the historian Charles Sydnor as the "most important works of [Waffen-SS] apologist literature." These works demanded rehabilitation of the military branch of the Nazi Party and presented ''Waffen-SS'' members as both victims and misunderstood heroes.{{sfn|Sydnor|1990|p=319}}

==Historical revisionism==
By the mid-1950s, under Hausser's guidance, HIAG attempted to establish a position that separated the ''Waffen-SS'' from other SS formations and shifted responsibility for crimes that could not be denied to the ''[[Allgemeine-SS]]'' (security and police), the ''[[SS-Totenkopfverbände]]'' (concentration camp organisation, "Death's Head troops") and the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' (mobile killing units). The ''Waffen-SS'', according to this position, could thus be successfully integrated into the parallel myth of the [[clean Wehrmacht|clean ''Wehrmacht'']].{{sfn|Wienand|2015|p=39}}

Hausser continued to deny that there was any connection between the ''Waffen-SS'' and Nazi atrocities. In 1957, he wrote an open letter in ''Der Freiwillige'', HIAG's official publication, to West Germany's minister of defence, stating that Death's Head troops "merely served as external guards in the concentration camps without the possibility of interfering with the internal procedure". He did not mention that the guards accompanied prisoners on external labor details and that commanders of concentration camps generally came from the ''Waffen-SS''.{{sfn|Tauber Volume I|1967|pp=337–338}}{{sfn|Tauber Volume II|1967|p=1163}} This apologist position also ignored the fact that the organizational structure of the SS tied the ''Waffen-SS'' to the Nazi annihilation machine through transfer of personnel between various SS units and the shifting responsibilities of the units themselves, as they may perform frontline duties at one time and then be reassigned to "pacification actions", the Nazi term for punitive operations in the rear.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=257–281}}

The German historian Karsten Wilke, who wrote a book on HIAG, ''Die "Hilfsgemeinschaft auf Gegenseitigkeit" (HIAG) 1950–1990: Veteranen der Waffen-SS in der Bundesrepublik'' ("HIAG 1950–1990: Waffen-SS veterans in the Federal Republic"), notes that, by the 1970s, HIAG attained a monopoly on the historical representation of the ''Waffen-SS''. Its recipe was simple and contained just four ingredients:
*The ''Waffen-SS'' was apolitical
*It was elite
*It was innocent of all war crimes or Nazi atrocities
*It was a European army par excellence, the Army of Europe.{{sfn|Wilke|2011|pp=379 and 405}}

Historians dismiss, and even ridicule, this characterisation. The French author Jean-Paul Picaper labels it as a "self-panegyric",{{sfn|Picaper|2014}} while David Clay Large uses the words "extravagant fantasies about [Waffen-SS's] past and future".{{sfn|Large|1987|pp=111–112}} The historian James M. Diehl describes HIAG's claims of the ''Waffen-SS'' being the "fourth branch of the Wehrmacht" as "false", and HIAG's insistence that the force was a precursor to [[NATO]] as "even more outrageous".{{sfn|Diehl|1993|p=225}}

Hausser's last project within HIAG was the five-hundred page SS picture tome under the nostalgic title ''Wenn alle Brüder schweigen'' ("When All Our Brothers Are Silent"); the project was spearheaded by Hausser, with [[Jochen Peiper]], another prominent ''Waffen-SS'' figure, as a contributor. The publication was released in 1973.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=215}}

Hausser died at the age of 92, on 21 December 1972 at Ludwigsburg.{{sfn|Williamson|2006|p=8}}

The '''polder model''' ({{lang-nl|poldermodel}}) is [[consensus decision-making]], based on the acclaimed [[Netherlands|Dutch]] version of [[consensus]]-based economic and social policy making in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name=Sanders&gt;[[Ewoud Sanders]], ''Woorden met een verhaal'' (Amsterdam / Rotterdam, 2004), 104–06.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stijn Kuipers, ''Het begin van het moderne Nederlandse poldermodel; De Hoge Raad van Arbeid van 1920 als eerste manifestatie van het Nederlandse tripartiete sociaaleconomische overlegmodel?'' (Nijmegen, 2015), 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The polder model has been described as "a pragmatic recognition of pluriformity" and "cooperation despite differences". It is thought that the Dutch politician [[Ina Brouwer]] was the first to use the term ''poldermodel'', in her 1990 article "Het socialisme als poldermodel?" (Socialism as polder model?), although it is uncertain whether she coined the term or simply seems to have been the first to write it down.&lt;ref name=Sanders/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ewoud Sanders, [http://www.nrc.nl/handelsblad/2002/04/22/poldermodel-7586691 "Poldermodel"], ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', 22 April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socioeconomic polder model==
[[File:Wim Kok 1994.jpg|thumbnail|Wim Kok, a former Prime Minister of Netherlands, supported the Polder Model.]]
The Dutch polder model is characterised by the [[Tripartism|tri-partite cooperation]] between [[employers' organisation]]s such as [[VNO-NCW]], [[labour union]]s such as the [[Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging|Federation Dutch Labour Movement]], and the [[government]]. These talks are embodied in the [[Social-Economic Council]] ({{lang-nl|Sociaal-Economische Raad}}, SER). The SER serves as the central forum to discuss labour issues and has a long tradition of consensus, often defusing labour conflicts and avoiding [[Strike action|strike]]s. Similar models are in use in [[Finland]], namely [[Comprehensive Income Policy Agreement]] and [[universal validity of collective labour agreements]].

The current Dutch polder model is said to have begun with the [[Wassenaar Agreement|Wassenaar Accords]] of 1982, when unions, employers, and government decided on a comprehensive plan to revitalise the economy involving shorter working times and less pay on the one hand, and more employment on the other. This polder model, combined with a [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic policy of [[Privatization|privatisation]] and budget cuts has been held to be responsible for the Dutch economic miracle of the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Elke van Riel, "Akkoord van Wassenaar keerpunt in relatie regering en sociale partners", ''SER Magazine'', 2010 (versie 9) ([https://web.archive.org/web/20150415042502/http://www.ser.nl/nl/publicaties/overzicht%20ser%20bulletin/2010/september_2010/06.aspx archived] 15 April 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

An important role in this process was played by the Dutch [[CPB (Netherlands)|Central Planning Bureau]] (CPB), founded by [[Jan Tinbergen]]. The CPB's policy advice since 1976, in particular with the Den Hartog and Tjan model, in favour of [[incomes policy|wage restraint]], was an important argument, supportive for government and employers, that the unions could not easily counter.

Many authors and researchers, however, have argued that the Wassenaar Agreement has been largely overrated.&lt;ref&gt;Agnes Akkerman, [http://www.ru.nl/@752137/pagina/ "Zo historisch was het Akkoord van Wassenaar niet"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924092540/http://www.ru.nl/@752137/pagina/ |date=2015-09-24 }}, [[Radboud University Nijmegen]], 2007 (retrieved 25 February 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaap Woldendorp, ''The Polder Model: From Disease to Miracle? Dutch Neo-corporatism 1965–2000'' (Amsterdam, 2005), 267–69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piet de Rooy, ''Republiek van rivaliteiten; Nederland sinds 1813'' (2nd printing Amsterdam, 2005), 216–17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuipers&gt;Stijn Kuipers, [https://www.academia.edu/11843938/Het_begin_van_het_moderne_Nederlandse_poldermodel "Het begin van het moderne Nederlandse poldermodel; De Hoge Raad van Arbeid van 1920 als eerste manifestatie van het Nederlandse tripartiete sociaaleconomische overlegmodel?"], Radboud University Nijmegen, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of these writers have argued that considerable continuity can be seen from the 1950s on. The young historian Stijn Kuipers, however, draws the line even further. In an article which is much indebted to the work of Coen Helderman,&lt;ref&gt;Coen Helderman, [http://www.tseg.nl/2004/2-helderman.pdf "De Hoge Raad van Arbeid, 1919-1940(-1950)"], ''Tijdschrift voor Sociale en Economische Geschiedenis'' I:2 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Kuipers argues that the modern socioeconomic polder model already manifested itself in 1920 with the Dutch High Council of Labour. It would follow that the polder model is much older and therefore could have had a larger influence on Dutch society and economy than has generally been thought up to now.&lt;ref name=Kuipers/&gt;

==Other uses==
The term polder model and especially the verb ''polderen'' (to [[polder]]) has been used pejoratively by some politicians to describe the slow decision-making process where all parties have to be heard. The model flourished under the "[[Purple (government)|Purple]]" governments of [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Dutch prime minister]] [[Wim Kok]], a coalition including the traditional rivals the [[Dutch Labour Party|Labour Party]] (a [[social democracy|social-democratic party]], whose colour is red) and the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] ([[conservative liberalism|right-wing liberals]], whose colour is blue). In the declining economic climate of the early 21st century the model came under fierce attack particularly from [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] politicians and [[Pim Fortuyn]] in his book entitled ''[[De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars]]'' ("The wreckage of eight years Purple").

==Historical background==
There is no consensus about the exact historical background of the polder model. In general there are three views on this subject.

One explanation points to the rebuilding of the Netherlands after [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]]. [[Corporatism]] was an important feature of [[Christian democracy|Christian Democratic]], and particularly [[Catholic]], political thought. During the postwar period, the Catholic, Protestant, Christian, social-democratic, and liberal parties decided to work together to reconstruct the Netherlands, as did [[Trade union|unions]] and [[employers' organization]]s. Important institutions of the polder model, like the SER, were founded in this period. No single political party has ever had anything approaching an overall majority in parliament, so coalition government is inevitable. This makes parties extremely cautious, since today's enemy may be tomorrow's ally, all the more so in present times when the "death of ideology" has made it possible for almost all the parties to work together.

Another explanation points to the dependency of the Netherlands on the [[International trade|international economy]]. The Dutch cannot afford [[protectionism]] against the unpredictable tides of the international economy, because the Netherlands is not an [[Autarky|autarkic]] economy. Therefore, to cushion against the international economy, they set up a [[Social-Economic Council|tri-partite council]] which oversaw an extensive [[welfare state]].

A third explanation refers to a unique aspect of the Netherlands, that it consists in large part of [[polder]]s, land reclaimed from the sea, which requires constant pumping and maintenance of the [[Dyke (construction)|dykes]]. So ever since the [[Middle Ages]], when the process of land reclamation began, different societies living in the same polder have been forced to cooperate because without unanimous agreement on shared responsibility for maintenance of the dykes and pumping stations, the polders would have flooded and everyone would have suffered. Crucially, even when different cities in the same polder were at war, they still had to cooperate in this respect. This is thought to have taught the Dutch to set aside differences for a greater purpose.

The '''[[police]] of Denmark''' ({{lang-da|Politiet}}) is the interior part of the Danish legitimate force providers (the [[Danish Defence|Danish military]] being the exterior). The police are empowered to enforce the law and to effect public and social order, as well as being responsible for [[border control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/documents/policies/borders-and-visas/schengen/docs/handbook-annex_01.pdf |chapter=Annex 1: List of national services responsible for border control |title=Practical Handbook for Border Guards (Schengen Handbook) |date=6 November 2006 |publisher=[[European Commission]] |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The common police of Denmark consists of 12 districts each managed by a director and two minor districts in [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]], run by a local chief of police.
The district of [[Copenhagen]] is somewhat differently organized due to its size and tasks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Besides the regular districts other organizations exist that work outside the common police:
* [[Rigspolitiet]] - a nationwide police force with specialized tasks such as ''Budgets and Accounts'', ''Building Surveying Department'' and the ''Data Investigating Department''
* [[Politiets Efterretningstjeneste]] - the national security intelligence agency of Denmark
* [[Politiets Aktionsstyrke]] - the special forces unit of the Danish police

==Equipment==
===Uniform===
The common uniform is a light blue shirt with the police insignia on the sleeve. Usually a tie is also worn. Rank-insignia is worn on the shoulders. The pants are dark blue with reflective patches. Black shoes are also included in the standard uniform. Special tactical suits are made of flame-resistant materials and are worn in situations requiring such equipment. The tactical suit also includes a protected helmet.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} 

===Vehicles===
For the daily duties, the patrol-vehicles are white and dog-patrols are mostly dark blue. They have a blue strobe-light or flashing light and the word "POLITI" painted on the side in a reflective and clear paint. The most commonly used patrol vehicles are [[Ford Mondeo]], [[Volkswagen Passat]] and [[Opel Vectra]], with 2.0 to 2.2 litre engines. In 2009, the 3.6 litre [[Škoda Superb]] was added to the fleet. Unmarked cars are usually fitted with engines with a size of around 1.6 to 2.2 litre. In addition a large number of small unmarked cars are used like [[Peugeot 307]], [[Opel Astra]], [[Ford Focus (international)|Ford Focus]] and Toyota Yaris - with engine size of around 1.2 to 1.6 litre. The [[Peugeot 607]] is used as a security attachment for cabinet members and the royal court. [[Toyota Landcruiser]] and VW Touareg are used for special tasks. Small detachments typically use [[Volkswagen Transporter|VW Transporters]], while [[Volkswagen LT|VW LTs]] and [[Ford Transit]] mini-buses are used in larger operations, which require a lot of manpower (demonstrations, football matches and larger civil unrests). In extreme events, a variation of the [[Mercedes-Benz Vario|MB Vario]] is used. It is generally known as the ''Dutchman's vehicle'' (in Danish ''Hollændervogn''). This name derives from the fact that these vehicles are fitted in the Netherlands as [[Armoured personnel carrier|light APC's]] with reinforced windows, wheels and metal parts and [[Fireproofing|fire-resistant]] coating. They are used both as light APCs in event of demonstrations or public disturbances, and as general transportation of large numbers of arrestees.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Other vehicles in use are the [[Mercedes-Benz Vito]] (used by both Central Turnout Leaders, a kind of on-street watch commanders) and [[Nissan Patrol]]s used by the mounted police squads with a horse carrier attached.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

The traffic police also use unmarked vans for automatic traffic control. These are primarily VW Transporters, Mercedes Benz Vitos, [[Toyota Hiace]]s, but others are used as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.10-20.dk/fotovogn.htm |title=Fotovogne i Danmark |trans-title=Photo vehicles in Denmark |website=10-20.dk |language=da  |accessdate=7 November 2018 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020021815/http://www.10-20.dk/fotovogn.htm |archivedate=20 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some rural police officers use civilian vehicles with a dismountable magnet roof flash.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

For traffic regulation and VIP and ambulance escorts [[motorcycle]]s are also used, primarily [[Yamaha FJR1300]]A, [[Honda ST1300]]a,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politi.dk/da/aktuelt/nyheder/2005/motorcykler_220905.htm |title=Politiet får nye motorcykler |trans-title=Police get new motorcycles |date=22 September 2005 |website=Politi.dk |language=da |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BMW K1200R]]S and [[BMW K1200GT]] (over time replacing older [[BMW motorcycles#K Series|BMW K1100LT]] and [[BMW motorcycles#R Series|BMW R1100RT]]).

===Weapons===
The standard service handgun is the [[Heckler &amp; Koch USP|H&amp;K USP Compact]] 9mm [[pistol]]. For special tasks the [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5|H&amp;K MP5]] [[sub-machine gun]] is used. Officers are also equipped with batons and pepper spray cans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politi.dk/NR/rdonlyres/20DE43AF-33F4-48C5-A710-6A58457E35D2/0/Engelskresum%C3%A9afendeligrapport.pdf |title=The use of police firearms in Denmark |first=Frode Z. |last=Olsen |date=2008 |website=Politi.dk |accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law about police enforcement==
The operation of [[Denmark|Danish]] [[police]] is regulated in the ''Act on Police Enforcement'' (da: ''Lov om politiets virksomhed''), commonly known as ''The Police Act'' (da: ''politiloven'') of 20 August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/forms/R0710.aspx?id=143225 |title=Lov om politiets virksomhed |trans-title=Law on Police Activity |language=da |website=Retsinformation.dk |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its first section states that:

"The police must work to ensure security, safety, peace and order in society. The police must promote this purpose through preventive, helping and enforcing work."

The second section states that other areas of police jurisdiction include:

# preventing criminal actions, disturbances of the public peace and order and danger to individual citizens and public safety
# stopping criminal actions and investigating and prosecuting criminal actions
# supporting citizens in dangerous situations
# checking and inspecting under current rules and regulations
# supporting other agencies under current rules and regulations
# performing other tasks under current rules and regulations, as well as handling other tasks which are naturally associated with police duties.

Lastly, the third section states:
"The police may in other situations than those mentioned in statutory law only interfere with citizens under this Act."&lt;ref group=note&gt;Though this may seem obvious, it is a precaution that clearly states that the police under no circumstances may act towards the citizens in ways that isn't stated by law (da: ''hjemlet''). This ensures that the police can't make their own interpretations of laws nor regulations.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ranks and insignia==
In Denmark, the local prosecution service is part of the police. Since 2014, only Chief Prosecutors wear uniforms; other prosecutors, such as senior prosecutors, prosecutors, associate prosecutors, and advocates, do not.

==Military police==

[[File:Danish military police Mercedes.JPG|thumb|right|Danish military police]]

The [[Military Police#Denmark|military police (MP) in Denmark]] are police units within the armed forces branches. Each branch has its own MP corps, although they often work together and wear similar insignias.

MP personnel typically wear either specific display dress uniforms with white MP shoulder markings or the branch-common daily [[Battle Dress Uniform|battle dress uniforms]] with a red [[beret]].

MP personnel generally do not have any legal authority towards civilians in non-military places, but only towards military personnel as towards everyone on military installations (also publicly accessible places such as the [[Holmen naval base]] in [[Copenhagen]]), in the buildings housing [[Ministry of Defence (Denmark)|the Ministry of Defence]], royal palaces (like [[Amalienborg Palace]]) and parts of [[Christiansborg Palace]]. On some occasions, MP personnel can provide support to the civilian police for certain tasks, but will only have slightly more legal authority than civilians, similar to the police home guard.

==Police Home Guard==
[[File:Politi-hjemmeværnet (MC betjent).jpg|thumb|right|Police Home Guard [[Police motorcycle|motorcycle]] operator.]]

The Danish police can call upon assistance from a section of the [[Danish Home Guard|Danish home guard]]: [[Politihjemmeværnet]] the ''police home guard''. The police home guard consists of 47 companies, each led by professional police officers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

The volunteers are mainly used for traffic control at [[festival]]s, [[Missing person|searches for victims]] and guarding community installations and are never used in tasks involving direct confrontation with civilians ([[riot control]] or planned [[arrest]]s). These companies are part of the Army Home Guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vistillerop.dk/vores-organisation/haerhjemmevaernet/ |title=Hærhjemmeværnet |trans-title=The Home Guard |website=Vistillerop.dk |language=da |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They wear branch-common daily battle dress uniforms, green berets and bright yellow vests with the text "POLITI HJEMMEVÆRNET" (POLICE HOME GUARD). 

Members of the police home guard have slightly more legal authority than regular citizens when the service they provide calls for it, but they are always under the supervision of the civilian police.

'''Potere Operaio''' ("Workers' Power") was a radical left-wing Italian political group, active between 1968 and 1973. (It shouldn't be confused with "Potere Operaio Pisano" which was one of the components of a competing revolutionary group, [[Lotta Continua]].) Among the group's leaders were [[Antonio Negri|Antonio ('Toni') Negri]], [[Nanni Balestrini]], [[Franco Piperno]], [[Oreste Scalzone]] and [[Valerio Morucci]], who led its clandestine armed wing. {{fact|date=November 2011}} It was part of the "workerist" movement (''[[operaismo]]''), leading to the later development of the [[Autonomist]] movement.

''Potere Operaio''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s main sphere of operations was in factories, especially big factories in the industrial North, and publishing newspapers and leaflets. It sought to base its Marxist theory on the everyday life of supposedly revolutionary factory workers.

Potere Operaio officially ceased to exist on 3 June 1973. Most of its core members went on to be involved in [[Autonomia Operaia]], signalling the shift from operaismo to autonomism. Some of the leaders later drifted towards more radical groups such as the [[Red Brigades]], including Morucci and [[Adriana Faranda]], who took part in the [[Aldo Moro|Moro]] murder. Negri was arrested in the late 1970s, accused of being the leader of the Red Brigades, before being cleared of charges. Oreste Scalzone also was arrested, in connection with violent acts.

== Background ==
On September 27, 1821 after three centuries of Spanish rule, [[Mexico]] reached its independence. The [[Treaty of Córdoba]] recognized part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] as an Independent Empire, which was recognized as "Monarchist, constitutional and moderate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=24 de agosto de 1821. Se firman los tratados de Córdoba|url=http://www.bicentenario.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1055:24-de-agosto-de-1821-se-firman-los-tratados-de-cordoba&amp;catid=120:agosto&amp;Itemid=221 |publisher=Gobierno Federal |accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new country adopted the name of [[First Mexican Empire|Mexican Empire]].

A minority of the Constituent Congress in search of stability elected as monarch [[Agustín de Iturbide]] and thus he was proclaimed Emperor of Mexico on May 18, 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Álvarez Cuartero, Izaskun ''Op.cit.'' p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 
''Constitutional Empire'' soon demonstrated the incompatibility of its two main parts, the Emperor and the Constituent Congress. The deputies were imprisoned simply for expressing their disagreements with Iturbide and finally, Iturbide decided to permanently eliminate the Congress, establishing instead a National Junta Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=La Transición del Imperio a la Republica (1821–1823) |url=http://www.iih.unam.mx/moderna/ehmc/ehmc11/136.html#nf41|publisher=Estudios de Historia Moderna y Contemporánea de México|accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of Congress, the arbitrary nature of the Emperor and the absence of solutions to the serious problems that the country was facing increased conspiracies to change the imperial system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Suárez y Navarro |first=Juan  |title=Historia de México y del general Antonio López de Santa Anna |year=1850 |location=México |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] proclaimed the [[Plan of Casa Mata]] which was later joined by [[Vicente Guerrero]] and [[Nicolás Bravo]]. Iturbide then was forced to reestablish the Congress and in a vain attempt to save the order and keep the situation favorable to his supporters, he abdicated to the crown of the Empire on March 19, 1823.&lt;ref name=iih&gt;{{cite news | title=La Transicion del Imperio a la Republica o la Participacion Indiscriminada | url=http://www.iih.unam.mx/moderna/ehmc/ehmc11/136.html| language =Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
However, the Congress nullified the designation of Iturbide and therefore the recognition of the abdication and made seem the coronation of Iturbide as a logic error in the consummation of Independence.&lt;ref name=iih/&gt;

On March 31, 1823, Constituent Congress appointed a [[triumvirate]] consisting by [[Nicolás Bravo]], [[Guadalupe Victoria]] and [[Pedro Celestino Negrete]] to lead the nation, this organization was named Supreme Executive Power.&lt;ref name=Supremo&gt;{{cite web |title=31 de marzo de 1823.

The Supreme Executive Power was commissioned to summon the former provinces now Free States, to create the Federal Republic and also to call elections for a new constituent congress. Also, had to overcome a series of political difficulties as the case of the Central American provinces that chose not to join Mexican Federation, the provinces of [[Oaxaca]], [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]], [[Jalisco]] and [[Zacatecas]] that declared itself free and sovereign states,&lt;ref name=INEHRM /&gt; also faced a conspiracy of supporters of Iturbide and anti-Spanish rebellion attempt.&lt;ref name=Supremo /&gt;

On November 5, 1823 was installed the new constituent congress. On January 31, 1824 was issued the decree which created the Constitutive Act of the Mexican Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Acta constitutiva de la Federación Mexicana |url=http://www.biblioteca.tv/artman2/publish/1824_121/Acta_constitutiva_de_la_Federaci_n_Mexicana_192.shtml|publisher=500 años de México en documentos|accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The draft constitution was submitted for discussion on April 1, 1824, and was approved on October 3 of that year, and finally, was enacted the [[Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States of 1824]] on October 4, 1824 by which was officially founded the [[United Mexican States (1824–1864)|United Mexican States]].

On October 10, 1824, [[Guadalupe Victoria]] took office as the first [[President of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=10 de octubre de 1824.

The crown of the [[Queen of Norway]] was made in 1830 for [[Désirée Clary]]'s coronation. It did not take place, and was first used in 1860, for the coronation of [[Louise of the Netherlands]].

It was made in [[Stockholm]] and, though it is unknown by whom, probably by [[Marc Giron]], the royal jeweller, some have speculated it may have been by [[Erik Lundberg]], or, perhaps is a combination of both's work, and the design is probably based on the crown of [[Louisa Ulrika of Prussia]].

It made of [[silver-gilt]] and [[gold]], and is decorated with a number of multicoloured gems and pearls, including violet ([[Amethysts]]), yellow ([[Citrine quartz|Citrine]] and [[Topaz]]) and green ([[chrysoprase]]). It weighs approx 530g.

Originally created to fund Ray Anderson’s personal philanthropic giving, family members announced the rebirth and refocus of the Foundation on Anderson’s birthday, nearly one year after his 2011 death. The purpose of the Ray C. Anderson Foundation is to perpetuate shared values and continue the legacy that Anderson left behind. The Ray C. Anderson Foundation is a not-for-profit 501(c)3 organization whose mission is to promote and advance the concepts of sustainable production and consumption.

==Life and career==

Anderson was an honors graduate of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in the school of industrial and systems engineering in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.gatech.edu/newsroom/release.html?nid=69252 |title= ISyE Alumnus and Interface Chairman Ray Anderson Dies |publisher= Georgia Tech |date= August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He learned the carpet trade through more than 14 years at [[Milliken &amp; Company|Deering, Milliken &amp; Company]] and Callaway Mills.

Anderson founded Interface in 1973 to produce the first free-lay carpet tiles in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.interfaceglobal.com/Company/History.aspx |title= Company History |publisher= Interface, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interface is one of the world’s largest producers of modular commercial floorcoverings, with sales in 110 countries and manufacturing facilities on four continents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecdm.gatech.edu/content/interface-inc Georgia Tech Interface]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental focus==
Anderson first turned his focus toward the environment in 1994 when he read ''The Ecology of Commerce'' by [[Paul Hawken]],&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; and also ''[[Ishmael (novel)|Ishmael]]'' by [[Daniel Quinn]], seeking inspiration for a speech to an internal task force on the company’s environmental vision. Hawken argues that the [[industrialisation|industrial system]] is destroying the planet and only industry leaders are powerful enough to stop it.

In 2009, Anderson estimated that Interface was more than halfway towards the vision of “Mission Zero,”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grist.org/article/2009-10-19-ray-anderson-sustainability-interview-book “Green-biz pioneer Ray Anderson says sustainability literally pays for itself,”] Grist&lt;/ref&gt; the company’s promise to eliminate any negative impact it may have on the environment by the year 2020 through the redesign of processes and products, the pioneering of new technologies, and efforts to reduce or eliminate waste and harmful emissions while increasing the use of renewable materials and sources of energy.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/ray-anderson-dies-interface-john-elkington-tribute “Ray Anderson, sustainable business pioneer, dies aged 77,”] The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfaceglobal.com/Newsroom/Ecometrics.aspx Interface’s Mission Zero Progress] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903182722/http://www.interfaceglobal.com/Newsroom/Ecometrics.aspx |date=September 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson chronicled the Mission Zero journey in two books, ''Mid-Course Correction:  Toward a Sustainable Enterprise:  The Interface Model'' (1998) and ''Confessions of a Radical Industrialist: Profits, People, Purpose: Doing Business by Respecting the Earth'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|M3qFL3kRDDE|Ray Anderson Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenlivingonline.com/article/confessions-radical-industrialist “Confessions of a Radical Industrialist,”] Green Living&lt;/ref&gt; The latter was released in paperback as ''Business Lessons from a Radical Industrialist'' in 2011.

==Recognition and awards==
Anderson was featured several documentaries and films, such as ''[[The Corporation (2003 film)|The Corporation]]'', (2004 Canadian documentary); ''[[The 11th Hour (2007 film)|The 11th Hour]]'' (2007 [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] film); ''[[I Am (2011 film)|I Am]]'' (2011 [[Tom Shadyac]] documentary); ''[[Big Ideas for a Small Planet]]'' ([[Sundance Channel (United States)|Sundance Channel]] series); and others.

The Interface story is the focus of the documentary film “So Right, So Smart” (2009).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090217191844/http://magicwig.com/WhatWeDo/documentary/index.html Magic Green Pictures, So Right, So Smart]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ray served a stint as co-chair of the President’s Council on Sustainable Development during President Clinton’s administration, which led to him co-chairing the Presidential Climate Action Plan in 2008, a team that presented the Obama Administration with a 100-day action plan on climate.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.interfaceglobal.com/Company/Leadership-Team/Ray-Watch/Meet-Ray.aspx Ray Anderson Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; Together, he and Interface funded the creation of the Anderson-Interface Chair in Natural Systems at Georgia Tech, where Associate Professor Valerie Thomas conducts research in [[sustainability]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenbuildingchronicle.com/2011/08/07/ray-anderson-awarded-honorary-doctorate-at-georgia-tech/ “Ray Anderson awarded honorary doctorate at Georgia Tech,”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122213329/http://greenbuildingchronicle.com/2011/08/07/ray-anderson-awarded-honorary-doctorate-at-georgia-tech/ |date=November 22, 2011 }} Green Building Chronicle&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Re Bristol South-East Parliamentary Election''''' ([1961] 3 All ER 354) is a 1961 United Kingdom [[election court]] case brought about by an [[election petition]] by [[Malcolm St Clair (politician)|Malcolm St Clair]] against [[Tony Benn]], the winner of the [[Bristol South East by-election, 1961|1961 Bristol South-East by-election]] where Benn had won the most votes but was disqualified from taking his seat in the [[House of Commons]] as he had inherited a [[hereditary peer]]age as 2nd [[Viscount Stansgate]].&lt;ref name=wiley&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2230.1961.tb00672.x/pdf |title=No parity for peers |work=The Modern Law Review |date= |accessdate=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benn argued that as he had not applied for a [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|writ of summons]], he was not a member of the [[House of Lords]] and that the voters had the right to choose who they wanted to represent them.&lt;ref name=nlj /&gt;

The court made a ruling of undue election because the voters were aware that Benn was legally disqualified from sitting in the House of Commons, their votes had to be counted as being "thrown away" and [[Malcolm St Clair (politician)|Malcolm St Clair]] as the runner-up would take the seat instead.&lt;ref name="lawcom1"&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://www.lawcom.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Electoral-Law_Legal-Challenge.pdf |title=Legal challenge to elections |publisher=Law Commission |date= |accessdate=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Anthony Wedgwood Benn had been elected as the MP for Bristol South East since 1950 as a [[Labour Party (United Kingdom)|Labour Party]] candidate. During that time he was heir to the Viscount Stansgate title held by his father [[William Wedgwood Benn, 1st Viscount Stansgate]], which Benn tried several times to renounce his right to. When his father died in 1961, Benn called the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] to inform him of this. The Speaker told Benn that because he was now legally a peer, he was disqualified from sitting and speaking in the House of Commons.&lt;ref name=pow /&gt; A by-election was called and Benn decided to fight it anyway. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] candidate, Malcolm St Clair ran several adverts in local papers telling voters that there was no point in voting for Benn as he was disqualified from sitting in the House of Commons as he was a hereditary peer.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; Despite this, Benn won the election and went to the door of the House of Commons to take his [[oath of allegiance]]. However the doorkeeper of the House had been told by the Speaker to not allow Benn access, specifically authorising the use of force to prevent him entering,&lt;ref name=pow&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Powell | title =Tony Benn: A Political Life | publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing | edition = | year = 2001 |volume=| isbn =0826456995|pages=20-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because he was not legally allowed in the Commons as a hereditary peer.&lt;ref name=pow /&gt; 

St Clair issued an election petition against the results stating that Benn could not take his seat as he was disqualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/guides/newsid_82000/82135.stm |title=Election petitions |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-08-20 |accessdate=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition was accepted by the [[Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales]] and the case would be heard by an election court. During the two months preceding the case, Benn along with his sons [[Stephen Benn|Stephen]] and [[Hilary Benn|Hilary]], and his legal advisor [[Michael Zander]] were granted permission by the Speaker to access the [[House of Commons Library]] to help with their case.&lt;ref name=nlj&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael |last=Zander |authorlink=Michael Zander |url=https://www.newlawjournal.co.uk/content/how-lose-title |title=How to lose a title |work=New Law Journal |date= |accessdate=2018-05-04}}{{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Court hearing ==
Against legal advice of the Labour Party's [[Queen's Counsel]]s, Benn represented himself ''[[Litigant in person|in pro per]]'' during the proceedings.&lt;ref name=nlj /&gt; During his opening address, Benn took 22 hours to make it and took 537 questions while doing so.&lt;ref name=nlj /&gt; Sir Andrew Clark QC, acting as St Clair's barrister argued in his response that a peer upon succession, regardless of whether they had asked for one or not, was entitled to a [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|writ of summons]] to the House of Lords which the Crown could not refuse to grant. He argued that merely having that right was grounds for disqualification as being a member of the House of Lords was incompatible with being an MP in the House of Commons.&lt;ref name=nlj /&gt;

Benn argued that to expel an elected member of the House of Commons on the grounds that he had the right for a writ of summons, was to punish him for doing something he hadn't done. He cited there was no precedence to punish a hereditary peer for refusing a writ of summons and referenced the [[Garter King of Arms]]'s [[Roll of the Peerage|Register of Lords Spiritual and Temporal]], where there were forty instances in 500 years of peers not claiming their right to a writ.&lt;ref name=nlj /&gt; Since 1955, if a peer did not reply to the [[Lord Chancellor]] in relation to their right, they were deemed to be on a [[leave of absence]] and attendance was not expected.&lt;ref name=nlj /&gt;

== Verdict ==
Justices Gorman and McNair delivered their verdict, which took two hours to read out. During it they praised Benn for “the magnificent way he had presented his case”.&lt;ref name=nlj /&gt; However, they found the election of Benn to be undue, as he had succeeded his father as Viscount Stansgate and thus was disqualified from being elected as a hereditary peer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.paimages.co.uk/image-details/2.18238862 |title=Election Court Hearing – Tony Benn – The Strand, London |publisher=PA Images |date= |accessdate=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; They stated that a hereditary peerage was "an incorporeal hereditament affixed to your blood and annexed for posterity".&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-23447489 |title=Peers' battle to stay in the Commons |publisher=BBC News |date=2013-07-26 |accessdate=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They made their judgement in favour of St Clair as despite the voters knowing that Benn was disqualified during the election campaign, their votes were to be treated as being "thrown away" as they had been given notice by St Clair of Benn's ineligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davies |first=Leila |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/158678 |title=Letters – Without peerage |work=New Statesman |date=2003-11-10 |accessdate=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benn's attempts to renounce his title were stated as being too technical for voters to have easily understood.&lt;ref name="lawcom1"/&gt; As a result, St Clair was elected in place of Benn.&lt;ref name="lawcom1"/&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Despite losing the court case, Benn continued to campaign to be able to renounce his peerage. The [[Peerage Act 1963]] was passed which allowed for hereditary peers to disclaim their peerage and surrender their right to sit in the House of Lords.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; This act was created partially as a result of Benn's campaign but also because of the Conservative Party wishing for either [[Alec Douglas-Home|Alec Douglas-Home, Earl of Home]] or [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg, Viscount Hailsham]] to become Prime Minister and it was considered constitutionally inappropriate for the Prime Minister to sit in the House of Lords.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; Benn took the opportunity to disclaim his title 22 minutes after the bill had come into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/43072/page/6534 |title=page 6534, Issue 43072 |work=The London Gazette |date=1963-08-02 |accessdate=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; St Clair, acting pursuant to a promise he made to respect the wishes of the people of his constituency, agreed to take the position of [[Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead]], an [[office of profit]] under the Crown, in order to disqualify himself from his seat. This forced a by-election  which Benn won, allowing him to reclaim his seat in the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/articles/2008/04/03/tony_benn_profile_feature.shtml |title=Profile: Tony Benn |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Clive Desmond''' (born 8 December 1951) is a British publisher, businessman and philanthropist. He is the former owner of [[Express Newspapers]] and founder of [[Northern &amp; Shell]], which publishes various celebrity magazines, such as ''[[OK!]]'' and ''[[New!]]'', and British national newspapers ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' and ''[[Daily Express]]''. Express Newspapers were sold to Reach Plc (formerly Trinity Mirror) for a consideration of £200m of which £74m was invested in the Express newspapers pension scheme until 2027.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/trinity-mirror-buys-express-star&lt;/ref&gt; Northern &amp; Shell owned Channel 5 before selling it to US broadcaster Viacom for £463m in May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, 1 May 2014 https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/may/01/viacom-purchase-channel-5-richard-desmond&lt;/ref&gt; The company sold its adult television network, Portland, in April 2016 for less than £1m.&lt;ref name="Plunkett010416" /&gt;

In 2010, Desmond was ranked the equal-57th richest man in Britain according to ''[[Sunday Times Rich List 2010|The Sunday Times Rich List]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/specials/rich_list/rich_list_2009/article6139764.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Richard Desmond | date=26 April 2009 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a net worth of £950 million. He was once again listed on [[Sunday Times Rich List 2011|the 2011 ''Sunday Times Rich List'']], with his fortune still at £950 million. In 2014, he was ranked 78th and worth £1.2 billion.&lt;ref name=STRL/&gt; In 2016 Forbes estimated his fortune at close to $1.49 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/richard-desmond/|title=Richard Desmond|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Sunday Times Rich List 2016|the 2016 ''Sunday Times Rich List'']] reported his net worth at £2.25 billion. When [[Sunday Times Rich List 2017|the 2017 ''Sunday Times Rich List'']] was announced, it recorded a rise in his net worth of £250m, to £2.5 billion, making him the 46th richest person in Britain.

In 2015, Desmond released his autobiography ''The Real Deal''.&lt;ref&gt;The Sunday Times, 21 June 2015 http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/books/non_fiction/article1569500.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Desmond was born in Hampstead, London, into a [[British Jews|Jewish]] family, the youngest of three children, and grew up in Edgware, in north west London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article6727593.ece | location=London | work=The Times | title=PROFILE Richard Desmond | date=26 July 2009 | first1=Patrick | last1=Hosking | first2=David | last2=Wighton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejc.com/35583/richard-desmond-new-tv-bid |title=Richard Desmond in new TV bid |first= |last= |work=BBC |year=2010 |accessdate=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was descended from Latvian Jews, and his mother was of Ukrainian-Jewish descent.&lt;ref name="Desmond2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Desmond|title=The Real Deal: The Autobiography of Britain's Most Controversial Media Mogul|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6K4BgAAQBAJ|date=18 June 2015|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4735-1854-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Cyril, was at one time managing director of cinema advertising company [[Pearl &amp; Dean]]. An ear infection caused the sudden loss of Cyril's hearing and, according to Richard, he used to take him along, when he was no more than three years old, to act as "his ears" in business meetings, where he ostensibly acquired his "first taste of business dealings".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/richard-desmond-ive-got-so-much-money-its-ridiculous-2006112.html "Richard Desmond: 'I've got so much money it's ridiculous'"] ''The Independent'', 21 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; After Cyril lost a significant amount of family money to gambling, his parents divorced&lt;ref name="guard"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2010/aug/15/tim-adams-profile-richard-desmond "Richard Desmond: Never afraid to Express himself"] ''The Guardian'', 15 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and 11-year-old Desmond moved with his mother, Millie, into a flat above a garage; he has described his impoverished early adolescence as a time when he was "very fat and very lonely".&lt;ref name="guard" /&gt;

Desmond was educated at Edgware Junior School and [[Christ's College, Finchley]].&lt;ref name="Desmond2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blackhurst"&gt;Blackhurst, Chris (1 December 2010) [http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/features/1042695/the-mt-interview-richard-desmond/ "The MT Interview: Richard Desmond"]. ''Management Today''. Retrieved 25 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early business career==
Desmond left school at 15 and started working in the classified advertisements section of the [[Thomson Newspapers|Thomson Group]], while playing the drums at gigs after a day's work.&lt;ref name="Blackhurst"/&gt; After moving to another company, he became sales director of Beat Instrumental Magazine at 18. Desmond owned two record shops by the time he was 21.&lt;ref name="Benady"&gt;Alex Benady [http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/412585/LARGING-RICHARD-DESMOND/ "Larging It Up With Richard Desmond"], ''Management Today'', 1 October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1970s, Desmond combined his interest in music and advertising to found, with [[Ray Hammond]], ''[[International Musician and Recording World]]'', a monthly magazine for musicians, eventually driving out of business long-established publications such as ''[[Beat Instrumental]]''.

He was an early pioneer of the international licensing of magazines: ''International Musician'' soon had editions in the US, Australia, Japan, Germany as well as the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Snoddy| first=Raymond|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/richard-desmond-the-demon-proprietor-of-fleet-street-6159168.html |title=Richard Desmond: The demon proprietor of Fleet Street |work=The Independent| date= 25 October 2004 |accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the publication of ''Home Organist'', whose editor contributed the old-school motto ''Forti Nihil Difficile'' ("Nothing is difficult for the strong" – it was Disraeli's motto), still used by the Northern &amp; Shell publishing group. Desmond eventually bought out Hammond.

In 1982, Northern &amp; Shell began to publish the UK edition of ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'', although the licensing deal ended in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Kirby [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/from-penthouse-to-penury-the-man-who-would-be-king-of-the-centrefold-100224.html "From 'Penthouse' to penury? The man who would be King of the Centrefold"], ''The Independent'', 14 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The company soon moved on to publishing a range of adult titles, including ''[[Asian Babes]]'', alongside about 40 other specialist publications, on subjects such as green issues, bicycles, fitness, stamps, cars and cooking. It was the first company to move to the revamped [[London Docklands|Docklands]] and the [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Royal]] opened the offices, which were cleaned temporarily of all evidence of ''Penthouse''.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} When the company moved to the Northern &amp; Shell Tower, the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] presided over the ceremonies.

Northern &amp; Shell began publication of the celebrity ''[[OK!]]'' magazine as a monthly in 1993, later becoming a weekly in March 1996. It is the largest weekly magazine in the world, with 23 separate editions from the US to Australia to Azerbaijan and with a readership in excess of 31 million. It was originally an imitation of ''[[Hello (magazine)|Hello!]]'' magazine but now outsells its rival.&lt;ref name="Blackhurst"/&gt;

==New York controversy==
Claims of dealings with the New York mafia in the early 1990s emerged in a May 2001 article by [[John Sweeney (journalist)|John Sweeney]] of ''[[The Observer]]''.&lt;ref name="Sweeney"&gt;John Sweeney [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/may/20/uknews.theobserver "Desmond's New York venture"], ''The Observer'', 20 May 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Desmond had made a deal in 1991 with Norman Chanes for running advertisements in his adult titles for telephone sex lines run by Chanes mafia associate, [[Richard Martino]] of the [[Gambino crime family]].&lt;ref name="Sweeney"/&gt; The ''[[Village Voice]]'' newspaper asserted in February 2005 that the three men had a meeting in September 1992 at the [[Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts|Four Seasons hotel]] near Hyde Park in London at which Martino accused Desmond of charging high rates for advertisements in magazines which sold no copies.&lt;ref name="Robbins"&gt;Tom Robbins [http://www.villagevoice.com/news/porn-stars-6404931 "Porn Stars"], ''Village Voice'', 1 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; BBC News reported in 2004 that Desmond did not know the other two men were connected to organised crime,&lt;ref name="BBC090604"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3087061.stm "Porn Star!"], BBC News, 9 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; while a spokesman for Northern and Shell said  in 2005 that Desmond had never met Martino or had dealings with him.&lt;ref name="Teather"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/feb/17/pressandpublishing.dailyexpress |title=Mafia told Desmond: we'll kill you over porn deal |last1=Teather |first1=David |last2=Milmo|first2=Dan|work=The Guardian |accessdate=26 March 2009 |location=London |date=17 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This deal reportedly left the Americans out of pocket, and an October 1992 incident in New York followed in which Desmond's then managing director, Philip Bailey, was violently and sexually assaulted as an explicit threat to Desmond himself.&lt;ref name="Sweeney"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Teather"/&gt; "If your boss sets foot here, he's a dead man", one of the attackers told Bailey according to the article in the ''Village Voice''.&lt;ref name="Robbins"/&gt; Desmond hired James Brown, a convicted criminal, as his bodyguard.&lt;ref name="BBC090604"/&gt; Desmond has asserted that this account is false.&lt;ref name="BBC090604"/&gt; Desmond continues to regularly visit New York having started OK! USA and grown Northern &amp; Shell in North America since 2004.

In February 2005, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the claim Desmond had received death threats from the New York Gambino mafia family was contained in affidavits from [[FBI]] agents released during Martino's trial relating to the fraudulent use of the telephone lines.&lt;ref name="Teather"/&gt; Martino pleaded guilty to the charge of trying to extort money from Desmond and Northern and Shell.&lt;ref name="Teather"/&gt; Desmond has denied the whole episode; he asserted there was no evidence he knew about the fraud perpetrated by Martino.&lt;ref name="Teather"/&gt;

==Business career (2000–8)==
In November 2000, Northern &amp; Shell acquired [[Express Newspapers]] from United News &amp; Media for £125 million,&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3479581.stm | title=Profile: Richard Desmond | author=Jorn Madslien | date=12 February 2006 | publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; enlarging the group to include the ''[[Daily Express|Daily]]'' and ''[[Sunday Express]]'' titles, the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' and ''[[Daily Star Sunday]]'' (which Desmond started), and the ''[[Irish Daily Star]]'' (owned jointly with the Irish [[Independent News &amp; Media]] group). The ''Daily'' and ''Sunday Express'' each sell around 700,000 copies per issue.&lt;ref name="circ"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.org.uk | title=ABC Circulation Figures | publisher=Audit Bureau of Circulations | accessdate = 4 February 2009}} (December 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Daily Star'' was the only national paper to increase sales year on year with an 18% increase from September 2008 to September 2009 {{update inline|date=July 2013}} and circulation figures of around 850,000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=44481&amp;c=1 National newspaper circulations] ''Press Gazette'', 16 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; largely due to aggressive pricing policies which significantly undercut competitors such as ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''.

After buying Express Newspapers, Desmond became embroiled in a feud with [[Jonathan Harmsworth, 4th Viscount Rothermere|Viscount Rothermere]], publisher of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', the rival to the ''Daily Express'', largely derived from stories relating to Rothermere's private life.

In February 2004, in a move that some newspapers interpreted&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/desmond-breaks-links-with-porn-as-he-fights-for-telegraph-571818.html "Desmond breaks links with porn as he fights for 'Telegraph'"] ''The Independent'', 2 March 2004&lt;/ref&gt; as an attempt to clear and bolster his image&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3479581.stm "Profile: Richard Desmond"] BBC, 12 February 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article1101821.ece "Blackout"] ''The Sunday Times'', 23 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; in view of his bid for the ''Daily Telegraph'', Desmond sold the adult magazine business to [[Remnant Media]] for approximately £10 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/richard-desmond-the-rebel-entrepreneur-who-went-too-far-561027.html "The rebel entrepreneur who went too far"] ''The Independent'', 24 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
In April 2004, the ''Daily Express'' reverted to supporting the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], after a period backing Labour. On the same day, Desmond accused ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', (with which he was a joint venture partner in the West Ferry newspaper printing plant) then considering accepting a takeover by the German [[Axel Springer AG|Axel Springer]] group, of giving in to [[Nazism|Nazis]].&lt;ref name="nazi"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1200881,00.html | title= Desmond taunts Telegraph in 'Nazi' tirade |work=The Guardian |date=22 April 2004 |location=London |first=Chris |last=Tryhorn |accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desmond reportedly harangued ''The Daily Telegraph''{{'s}} chief executive and associates in faux German at a business meeting and imitated [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref name="Blackhurst"/&gt; This incident was described as a form of [[institutionalised racism]] prevalent among newspaper proprietors.&lt;ref name="KeebleReeves2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Keeble|author2=Ian Reeves|title=The Newspapers Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DvJTBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83|date=21 August 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-50077-0|pages=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, in August 2001, the [[National Union of Journalists]]' chapel at the ''[[Express &amp; Star]]'' also condemned Desmond for the newspaper's "hysterical and racist" campaign against [[asylum seekers]];&lt;ref name="KeebleReeves2014" /&gt; this campaign was also criticised by [[Yasmin Alibhai-Brown]], writing for ''[[The Independent]]'' in June 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alibhai-Brown|first1=Yasmin|authorlink1=Yasmin Alibhai-Brown|title=I can take Mr Desmond's porn but not his racism|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/yasmin-alibhai-brown/i-can-take-mr-desmonds-porn-but-not-his-racism-178897.html|accessdate=1 April 2016|work=The Independent|date=2 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, the former executive editor of the ''Daily Express'' [[Ted Young (journalist)|Ted Young]] made an out-of-court settlement with Desmond's company ahead of an industrial tribunal. This related to an incident with Desmond in the newsroom in September 2004, during which Desmond was said to have hit the journalist.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Tryhorn [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/aug/24/pressandpublishing.dailyexpress "Express settles with former executive"], ''The Guardian'', 24 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Desmond has repeatedly denied the claims.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Tryhorn [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/aug/23/dailyexpress.pressandpublishing "Desmond punched me, claims former Express man"], ''The Guardian'', 23 August 2005M&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, 15 June 2015 https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jun/19/richard-desmond-interview-hate-to-admit-never-hit-anyone&lt;/ref&gt;

Desmond is often referred to as "Richard 'Dirty' Desmond"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard 'dirty' Desmond: A Humbuggery Special|url=http://www.private-eye.co.uk/sections.php?section_link=street_of_shame&amp;issue=1323&amp;article=619|deadurl=no|accessdate=1 April 2016|work=Private Eye|issue=1323|date=18 September 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202075158/http://www.private-eye.co.uk/sections.php?section_link=street_of_shame&amp;issue=1323&amp;article=619|archivedate=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Dirty Des"&lt;ref name="IndyJune2010"&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Desmond: 'I've got so much money it's ridiculous'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/richard-desmond-ive-got-so-much-money-its-ridiculous-2006112.html|accessdate=1 April 2016|work=The Independent|date=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''[[Private Eye]]'' magazine due to his company [[Northern &amp; Shell]] formerly owning a number of pornographic magazines and television channels.&lt;ref name="Plunkett010416"/&gt; Desmond was apparently "wounded" by references to himself as a pornographer.&lt;ref name="IndyJune2010" /&gt; In an interview with [[BBC Breakfast]] in 2015, Desmond was referred to as Digi Des due to his investments in digital media. A headline in the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' in 2000 said "Porn Publisher to Buy Express" in reference to Desmond.&lt;ref name="IndyJune2010" /&gt; In a 2002 interview  for ''[[BBC Newsnight]]'' with [[Jeremy Paxman]], [[Tony Blair]] was asked if it were appropriate to accept a controversial £100,000 donation from Desmond due to Desmond's links with the pornography industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Soft-porn' donation defended by Blair|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1991084.stm|accessdate=1 April 2016|work=BBC News Online|date=17 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which Blair replied "if someone is fit and proper to own one of the major national newspaper groups in the country then there is no reason why we would not accept donations from them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hogson|first1=Jessica|title=Desmond's good enough for me, says Blair|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/may/16/bbc.dailyexpress|accessdate=1 April 2016|work=The Guardian|date=16 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desmond has emphasised that his material has been available through [[WHSmith]] and [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], saying that: "If it was pornography you would end up in prison because pornography is illegal".&lt;ref name="IndyJune2010" /&gt; In 2008, Northern &amp; Shell reported a turnover of £483.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northernandshell.co.uk/ir/2008_accounts.php Financial Results 2008] Northern &amp; Shell announcement&lt;/ref&gt;

==Libel case==
Litigation began at the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] on 6 July 2009 over claims in journalist [[Tom Bower]]'s joint biography of [[Conrad Black]] and [[Barbara Amiel]], ''[[Conrad and Lady Black: Dancing on the Edge]]'', that Desmond had made a "humiliating climbdown" over an ''Express'' story at the end of 2002 on the state of Lord Black's finances, which it was alleged Desmond had ordered to be written.

This claim of a weakening of Desmond's "super-tough" reputation as a businessman was viewed as defamation by Desmond. Bower denied libel on the grounds of the story being "substantially true".&lt;ref&gt;James Robinson [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jul/07/richard-desmond-tom-bower "Tom Bower book damaged Richard Desmond's 'super-tough' reputation, court hears",] ''The Guardian'', 7 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, the presiding judge [[David Eady|The Hon. Mr Justice Eady]], discharged the jury as "fundamental" evidence and legal submissions had emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Spence [http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article6657094.ece "Jury discharged in Richard Desmond libel case",] ''The Times'', 7 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The new jury later found in favour of Bower.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Foster [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article6725500.ece "Richard Desmond loses libel case with Tom Bower over Conrad Black claims"], ''The Times'', 24 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A biography of Desmond, ''Rough Trader'', was written by Bower and printed in 2006, but still awaits publication.&lt;ref name="tbweek"&gt;{{cite news|author=Tom Bower|publisher=The Observer|date=26 July 2009|title=My week: Tom Bower|accessdate=6 June 2013|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jul/26/tom-bower-diary-richard-desmond|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian 13 April 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= Tom Bower to speak to NUJ after being barred from Express offices |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/apr/13/tom-bower-to-speak-to-nuj-after-being-barred-from-express-offices | last= Greenslade| first= Roy| date= 13 April 2015 | website= The Guardian | accessdate= 20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments since 2010==
In July 2010, Desmond bought the UK terrestrial-television channel [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], which was losing money, from the German group [[RTL Television|RTL]], for £103.5 million.&lt;ref name="N&amp;Sacquisition1"&gt;{{cite press release | publisher = RTL Group | date = 23 July 2010 | title = RTL Group sells UK broadcaster Five | url = http://www.rtlgroup.com/www/htm/home_news.aspx?ID=C57D4206AF294A979A24C3EE4270E175 | accessdate = 24 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="N&amp;Sacquisition2"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Never before", wrote Tom Bower in ''[[The Guardian]]'' at the time, "has a government regulator (Ofcom) lowered the threshold for the suitability of the prospective owner of a TV channel enough for someone like Desmond to control a potentially lucrative franchise."&lt;ref&gt;Tom Bower [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/24/richard-desmond-porn-kings-coup "Richard Desmond: the porn king's coup"], ''The Guardian'', 24 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The new owner immediately proceeded to cut costs, starting with the dismissal of seven of Channel 5's nine directors, beginning a drive to eliminate "£20m of yearly expenses". The stated plan included the dismissal of up to 80 of the network's 300 employees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/aug/12/bloodbath-five-richard-desmond "Bloodbath on Five as Richard Desmond clears out seven directors"] ''The Guardian'', 12 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year before Desmond acquired Channel 5 it had made a total loss of €41m (£37m), or a €9m loss at an operating level under its previous owner. Despite specific cost cutting, Desmond made significant investments in Channel 5 content, significantly increasing the programming budget. In the first full year of Desmond’s ownership of Channel 5, the broadcaster saw a 28% surge in revenue - the biggest TV advertising haul in the broadcaster's 14-year history - "thanks to factors including the arrival of Big Brother and the return of a major media buying contract with Aegis".&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, 18 December 2011 https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/dec/18/channel-5-ad-revenues-soar&lt;/ref&gt; He sold Channel 5 to Viacom for £463m in May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sweney |first=Mark |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/may/01/viacom-purchase-channel-5-richard-desmond |title= Viacom confirms purchase of Channel 5 from Richard Desmond for £450m |work=The Guardian |location= London |date=1 May 2014 |accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By December 2010, the privately owned publishing venture employed more than 2,000 people internationally, according to Desmond.&lt;ref name="Blackhurst"/&gt; Northern &amp; Shell's business interests in pornography finally ended in April 2016 when the Portland Television subsidiary, which broadcasts Television X and the Red Hot channels, was sold for under £1 million in a management buyout.&lt;ref name="Plunkett010416"/&gt;

==Charity work and political activity==
In 2003, Desmond and [[Roger Daltrey]] formed the [[RD Crusaders]], a rock group featuring Desmond on drums, to raise money for charitable causes. Since its inception, the group has raised around £14 million via a series of fundraising concerts for charities including Marie Curie, the Teenage Cancer Trust, Norwood Child Care and the Evelina Children's Hospital. As well as Daltrey and Desmond, the line-up occasionally includes [[Robert Plant]], [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[Steve Harley]], guitarists [[Russ Ballard]] (of [[Argent (band)|Argent]]) and [[Rick Wills]] (of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] and [[Bad Company]]), keyboardist [[Steve Smith (musician)|Steve Smith]] and organist [[Zoot Money]].

Desmond, an active supporter of children's charities, became president of [[Norwood (charity)|Norwood]] in 2006. Norwood is a leading UK Jewish charity, supporting vulnerable children, families and people with learning disabilities. He also ensured the attachment of his name to a children's centre at [[Moorfields Eye Hospital]], by contributing £2.5m to the £15m project.&lt;ref&gt;''Camden New Journal'', 8 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The centre is the world's largest specialist paediatric eye clinic, a centre treating more than 25,000 children a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moorfields.nhs.uk/aboutus/thericharddesmondchildrenseyecentre "The Richard Desmond Children's Eye Centre"]. Moorfields Eye Hospital. 25 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The centre was officially inaugurated in 2007 by [[Queen Elizabeth II]].

In December 2014, during the run up the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], Desmond was reported to have agreed to donate £300,000 to the [[UK Independence Party]].&lt;ref name="Sky News 12 December 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kleinman |first1=Mark |title=Express Owner Desmond Hands £300k To UKIP |url= http://news.sky.com/story/1390791/express-owner-desmond-hands-300k-to-ukip |date=12 December 2014 |accessdate=18 December 2014 |work=Sky News}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was speculation at the time that a further donation could follow,&lt;ref name="Sky News 12 December 2014"/&gt; and in April 2015 it was announced that he had given an additional £1 million to the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Express owner Richard Desmond gives UKIP £1m |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32340976| accessdate=16 April 2015 |date= 16 April 2015 |work= BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Health Lottery==
Desmond's company, [[Northern and Shell]], launched the [[Health Lottery]] in October 2011 of which around 20% of turnover goes to charity. The grants, distributed by the People's Health Trust (PHT), help many good causes and the elderly in local communities across the UK. By March 2018, [[The Health Lottery]] has raised nearly £100m for charities around the [[United Kingdom]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Benjamin|first=Alsion|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/oct/19/health-lottery-good-news-charities|title=Is the health lottery good news for charities? |work=The Guardian|date=19 October 2011|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It supports local health causes throughout England, Scotland and Wales. The Health Lottery was to return 20.34p per £1 lottery ticket to good causes, which was compared unfavourably with the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] donating 28p per £1 ticket. Sir [[Stephen Bubb]], then Chief Executive of the [[Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations]], accused Desmond of "profiteering on the back of charities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15070628|title=Media group launches commercial lottery|publisher=BBC News|date=27 September 2011|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, The Health Lottery's public accounts confirm that, as of 2017, the company had not made a profit since inception. &lt;ref&gt;[https://document-api-images-prod.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docs/g2cA7tc7BCROdzBnrnRjRsMxQGd8gUZOucNNIIX4tmg/application-pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAWRGBDBV3ENKL6JVO%2F20181109%2Feu-west-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20181109T144714Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=60&amp;X-Amz-Security-Token=FQoGZXIvYXdzEHwaDD2CEzWVDsWu466C5SK3A31D6j3qNMT8e9loIgUqUIaTWI0cNBzQVcbb9%2F3B7OGWWAe1KHOjzP06BQfBpf1kEJmFguy%2FCsIuCfRTCH6%2FINSz%2F0nmreqY%2B%2BIljzDMEfAYBRTB8m251vyqaNDm555r3Mv%2B5kFhQ98T0yIOmQQwnhyrvMYUXYSsUAysLMBwGElEfEguILRmcYfGNKMCsONR3rz7rc7gWHeSP0UAlmlQ%2FTeXMpXkAOZFRWMj4Vj197mbsS3UL%2BW8MCIIRZOON2s2XGd3HTara9vJ7Cy9SNET7%2FaCRtIGAFrBaIgJTYgIR6q%2BV7M9gCHZZ37YcZyr1ok1%2BbyaKBgUJi1cTbLKKiqqSy0gtpXOgRter8uclWyaBcS6Mf3SXAerqYfh1aMqZTStlbTxxw9NJFeI1Na5VU%2BxDrZBwutllK3mnide7v1ov2lo4yd2gHwvZMnNmrPrGtfOUg59wpJhN0FiJ7NaJglumMn9YnFOwU3FQQQsL2YXeFQIO0BqPoEb4GY1tmhcokV7tXSS89EWeFNbtAZVxp7DZEazzld1HDI2d02fI%2Bl3fMl8FkiBUo2FpS6abtgVuqBI0ChX%2B3uHfTQohseV3wU%3D&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=5aac0d11f0096b61b2959bbcf0870580a80dc6cd45a7a91581c74eeb00810167]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017, [[Sir Henry Bellingham]], MP, North West Norfolk, led a debate in Westminster Hall with members of [[Parliament]] representing 5 parties from across the [[United Kingdom]] on the ''‘Future of Society Lotteries, the Health Lottery and limits on prize values’''. The debate concluded that the much-needed changes to the prize limits of these lotteries  - to £1m - would receive widespread support - not just from the Government benches but from the entire House - if they were to be made by the [[Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport]].

In an article in the [[Financial Times]] on 12 November, Desmond announced his intention to bid for the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] license when it comes up for renewal in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/1946797c-c4ac-11e7-a1d2-6786f39ef675&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Satire Ménippée''''' ({{IPA-fr|satiʁ menipe}}) or ''La Satyre Ménippée de la vertu du Catholicon d'Espagne'' (written in 1593, published in [[Tours]] in 1594) was a political and satirical work (in French) in prose and verse which criticized the excesses of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]] and Spanish pretensions during the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] in France and defended the idea of an independent but Catholic France. The title derives from the classical Roman literary genre "[[menippean satire]]" which included a mixture of prose and verse.

The work was written during the [[French States-General|Etats Généraux]] which were convened by [[Charles of Lorraine, Duke of Mayenne]] (leader of the Catholic League) in Paris (on February 10, 1593) in the hopes of electing himself to the French throne (replacing the pretender to the throne, the future [[Henry IV of France]]). The work was conceived by [[Pierre le Roy (canon)|Pierre le Roy]] ([[canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Rouen]] and [[chaplain]] to the cardinal of Bourbon) during discussions with friends ("français en politique et gallicans en religion" or "French in politics and Gallicans in religion") in Paris at the home of [[Jacques Gillot (jurist)|Jacques Gillot]] (canon of the [[Sainte-Chapelle]]). The work was written by [[Nicolas Rapin]], [[Jean Passerat]] and [[Florent Chrestien]], and edited/revised by [[Pierre Pithou]].

The philosophy of the group around Pithou and Rapin and the ''Satire Ménippée'' is that of the "[[Politiques]]", moderate Catholics who privileged peace, conceived of a distinction between the State and Religion, and sought political accommodation with the [[Huguenot]]s.  By the end of the civil wars, the "politiques" were the favored target of attack of the Catholic League.

The work includes several remarkable passages, including a description of a procession and all the forces of the League, the public orations of the Duke of Mayenne, of the legate of the Pope, and of the cardinals Pelvé (attributed to Chrestien) and Aubray (attributed to Pithou). The writers paint the miseries of the nation and the blindness of their detractors, and they encourage an alliance of the people and the monarchy to save the nation.

Notably, Diderot's ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' praises the work for its "singularity" and notes its usefulness to [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0000.809 | title = Satire, Menippean | accessdate = 1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sustainable Commodity Initiative''' (SCI) is a joint initiative launched by the [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] (IISD) and the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) in 2003.  The SCI works closely with the international community to discover ways to ensure that sustainable practices are adopted into commodity production and trade that enhance social, environmental and economic welfare on a global scale. The SCI was formed to facilitate the development of sustainable commodity production and trade sectors.  The initiative works collaboratively with producers and producer organizations, voluntary sustainability initiatives (VSI's), the private sector, government institutions and development focussed NGO’s. The initiative receives project funding from numerous governments worldwide, United Nations agencies, foundations, the private sector and individual donors.

== Activities ==
The SCI conducts targeted research on market impacts, facilities collaboration and information sharing across existing voluntary sustainability initiatives (VSI's) and facilitates policy and initiative development.

Specific objectives include:
* Improve stakeholder and policy decision making capacity through enhanced access to information on sustainability in commodity markets
* Improve return on investment ratios for VSI's through enhanced efficiencies and economies of scale
* Improve the poverty reduction abilities of VSI's through enhanced participation of rural stakeholders in initiative development
* Improve the environmental impacts of voluntary initiatives through market growth and continual improvements

Through ongoing multi-stakeholder consultation, the SCI identified five cross-cutting areas for the development of sustainable production practices across global supply chains, which include:
*Supporting access to '''market information''' on sustainable products
*Strengthening '''technical assistance''' for sustainable production
*Improving '''[[access to finance]]''' for sustainable production
*Strengthening the '''evidence base on impacts''' of sustainable products and supply chains
*Facilitating the development of '''supportive policy''' for sustainable products and markets

== Definition of voluntary sustainability initiatives ==
The SCI considers "voluntary sustainability initiatives" or "VSI's" to be any non-mandatory, rules based partnership or collaboration among multiple supply chain stakeholders aimed at improving the social, economic and environmental sustainability of commodity production and/or trade. Over the last decade, more than 20 new global VSI's have been established with the aim of
leveraging market forces to promote sustainable development.

Examples of operational VSI's include; [[Fairtrade]], [[International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements]] (IFOAM), [[Forest Stewardship Council]], [[Marine Stewardship Council]], The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, [[United Nations Global Compact|Global Compact]], [[ISO 14000]], [[Global Reporting Initiative]], CERES Principles etc.

Voluntary initiatives have the potential to bring many benefits to international trade sectors including:

* Higher and more stable revenues through the identification of sustainable products and markets
* Better farm and business management practices among rural producers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SME's)
* Improved stakeholder awareness of market trends
* Reduced stakeholder risk exposure to market volatility
* More efficient and strategic natural resource use
* Improved consistency, quality and supply of products to consumers
* Improved consumer awareness of producer conditions through private sector communication channels
* Improved coordination and efficiency of supply chain management
* Increased private sector investment for sustainable production and consumption

VSI's also offer a vehicle for channelling a growing private sector interest in promoting sustainability towards common approaches and pooled investment. With the potential to create unified approaches and the economies of scale needed to bring about widespread change at the global level, voluntary supply-chain approaches are ready to establish a new paradigm for commodity production and trade.

"Cross-cutting" initiatives seek to promote inter-initiative cooperation to improve efficiency, transparency and effectiveness within the sector. The growth in the number of NGO, government and industry led initiatives has increased the opportunities to promote sustainable practice in commodity sectors, but has also led to a multiplication of transaction and implementation costs that threaten the viability and impact of these approaches. Most initiatives have the potential to benefit considerably from shared learning and collaboration with service provision since they have similar objectives implement similar activitieson the ground.

Since the majority of voluntary initiatives focus on the practices of individual supply chain actors, a largely untapped global "macro" oriented approach to production poses new opportunities for the development of sustainable commodity supply chains. In addition to carrying out its own inter-ininitiative collaboration, the SCI is either a participant or member of the following cross-cutting initiatives:

* [http://www.isealalliance.org International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labelling (ISEAL) Alliance]
* The World Bank's [http://www.tradestandards.org Trade Standards Practitioners Network]

== SCI Projects ==

=== Impact Assessment- COSA ===
The [[Committee on Sustainability Assessment (COSA)]] project is a multi-stakeholder led research consortium assessing the costs and benefits of sustainability standards.

Recent growth in sustainable markets has created new opportunities for producers in developing countries to sell higher priced specialty products and create more stable trading relationships. The adoption of sustainable production methods and the entry into sustainable markets however, is becoming increasingly more complicated for producers and other supply chain actors to navigate, especially as the number of sustainability programs/processes and certification bodies grow.

With a diverse range of sustainability programs to choose from, producers, consumers, policy-makers and companies lack independent, credible data on what it really means to become compliant with social, economic and environmental sustainability initiatives. To date, there is very little detailed information on the impacts of sustainability standards. Information is limited for example, on what costs and benefits producers experience when adopting compliance with any given sustainability initiative, and how much time it takes for producers to see returns on an investment in a particular sustainability initiative. Where information is available it is usually partial, often partisan and rarely based on comparable science-based methodologies. An apt analogy may be that we have designed a class of medicines but are not really certain of their full impact or to what extent they may have unintended side-effects. Since many standards are either requested or required by buyers in international markets, the need for improved information on field level impacts is urgent.&lt;ref&gt;Daniele Giovannucci and Jason Potts with B. Killian, C.Wunderlich, G. Soto, S. Schuller, F. Pinard, K. Schroeder, I. Vagneron. 2008. Seeking Sustainability: COSA Preliminary Analysis of Sustainability
Initiatives in the Coffee Sector. Committee on Sustainability Assessment:Winnipeg, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sustainable Commodity Initiative’s [[Committee on Sustainability Assessment (COSA)]] project was founded to strengthen the evidence base on the impacts of sustainable products and supply chains. COSA has developed a scientific methodology using multi-criteria analysis for gathering and understanding concrete, fact-based data on the outcomes associated with sustainability programs.

The COSA executive committee includes the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), Nicaragua’s [http://www.catie.ac.cr/magazin.asp?CodIdioma=ESP Centro Agronómico Tropical de Investigación y Enseñanza] (CATIE), Costa Rica’s [Centro de Inteligencia sobre Mercados Sostenibles] (CIMS/INCAE), France’s [http://www.cirad.fr/en/index.php Centre de coopération internationale en recherche agronomique pour le développement] (CIRAD) and Switzerland’s [http://www.seco.admin.ch/index.html?lang=en State Secretariat for Economic Affairs] (SECO). This committee, with the endorsement of the [[International Coffee Organization]] and initial seed support from [[USAID]], [[NORAD]] and BTC, worked with leading institutions in several producing countries to adapt and develop the COSA methodology.

=== Finance for Sustainable Trade - FAST ===
Created in 2007, the [http://www.fastinternational.org Finance Alliance for Sustainable Trade] (FAST) is a member driven, non-profit international organization headquartered in Montreal, Canada. Its current membership base (over 100 members) represents Small and Medium Enterprise producer organizations, commercial and socially-oriented lenders, development focused NGOs, and other sustainable trade stakeholders.

Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) producers have been identified as one of the most important drivers of economic growth and poverty reduction in developing countries. Sustainable SME producers are growing in number and are key drivers behind a global transition to sustainable trade. Currently, a major barrier facing the continued growth and development of SME's is the unmet need for external finance. Since entry into sustainable markets typically requires additional capital investment - many producers in developing countries simply cannot afford to invest in the transition.

FAST's mission is to facilitate a global collaborative effort among its members to ensure continued growth of the sustainable trade sector. This is made possible by increasing the number of producers in developing countries who can successfully access affordable trade finance and longer-term loans, tailored to their business needs as they enter sustainable markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastinternational.org Finance Alliance for Sustainable Trade website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The SCI's role in the development of FAST dates back to 2003, when discussions among members of the SCI's Sustainable Coffee Partnership identified improving producer access to finance as a key strategy in achieving its core objectives of enabling the adoption of more sustainable practices across commodity markets. The SCI took the lead in convening FAST stakeholders at the Specialty Coffee Association of America's annual conference in 2005 and 2006 and continued to lead the process, along with steering committee participants, until FAST's formal establishment as a non-profit organization in 2007. Currently, the SCI and FAST work collaboratively on a number of projects.

=== Technical Assistance - SCAN ===
The [http://www.sustainablecommodities.org/node/20 Sustainable Commodity Assistance Network] (SCAN) partnership is a multi-initiative platform led by the Sustainable Commodity Initiative (SCI) and funded by [http://www.hivos.nl/english HIVOS] and [[Solidaridad]]. The goal of the SCAN partnership is to improve the livelihoods of rural commodity producers, workers and communities in developing countries by empower smallholder producer groups through focused technical assistance to undertake sustainable farm and business management practices and attain efficient entry into sustainable markets. SCAN will link the technical assistance efforts of VSI's through a common platform.

SCAN is working with existing technical assistance providers, VSI's and development focussed NGO's to create a more cohesive global technical assistance platform that will address the following observations:

*'''Market Growth:''' As markets for sustainable products continue to grow producers gain a unique opportunity to utilize a ‘specialty market' structure to sell higher priced products while also incorporating a high level of social and environmental integrity. Market growth for sustainable products has created an increased opportunity for producers to participate in specialty markets that ensure sustainable development impacts. This has created an increased need for larger-scale technical assistance delivery across a growing number of commodities and regions.
* '''Overlap in Training Practices:''' There is a growing area of overlap between the objectives and implementation frameworks of different standards. Most initiatives now promote a similar set of social, health, economic and environmental standards and realize that insufficient attention has been given to product quality and the overall market implications. With the high transaction costs associated with the delivery of training and the depth of the technical assistance needed throughout commodity producing countries, there lies a clear opportunity to improve efficiency and scale. By reducing overlap and creating a collaborative network, initiatives will be better able to identify and implement best practice and create substantial administrative and cost savings.
* '''Gaps in Business Training:''' Most technical assistance programs currently in place are topic specific and are often linked to a specific sustainability initiative. Similarly, existing training activities that these initiatives conduct often focus only on achieving compliance due to insufficient resources to go further. As a result, today very limited resources exist to train producers on how to manage a sustainable business and actively participate in international sustainable and specialty markets. By improving training to include modules on access to sustainable markets, marketing and risk management, producers will better able to take a more proactive role in planning and sales.
* '''Quality Management Systems:''' There is a lack of coherence in quality management systems (QMS) procedures amongst most standards-based initiatives. Most initiatives allow group certification for organized smallholders on the condition that they apply some form of Internal Control System (ICS). At present, the ICS's required by the different standards bodies are neither standardized nor consistent and, more importantly, do not always promote a sound "business management" approach. One producer group should have only one ICS (or QMS) even if the group wishes to comply with more than one global standard. By ensuring that the technical assistance package delivered through SCAN includes comprehensive training on best practices in QMS, producers will improve their ability to successfully comply and gain improved market access.
* '''Enhanced Producer Organization:''' Producer organization is often a prerequisite to enabling access to sustainable markets for smallholder producers. Compliance-based technical assistance strategies typically do not currently have the resources or tools to build the requisite organizational structures for producers. Also important is developing improved producer access and interaction with international markets, an approach which requires effective producer organization. Standards bodies agree that producer organization play a central role in enabling disadvantaged producers to benefits from sustainable markets. Specifically, SCAN technical assistance will have a particular focus on facilitating the organization of unorganized producers and improve the organizational capacity of existing organizations.
* '''Lack of Resources:''' Comparatively little attention has been given by initiatives to support large-scale transition to sustainable production and management due to limited resources available to any one initiative. By pooling efforts and resources and expertise, SCAN is at the forefront of developing a program that supports the "mainstreaming" of sustainable commodity production and trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustainablecommodities.org SCI website]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reporting - State of Sustainability Initiatives (SSI) ===
The [[State of Sustainability Initiatives]] (SSI) is a global initiative that will research and report on the impacts of market-based, voluntary approaches to sustainable commodity production and trade.  The SSI is a knowledge-sharing programme that will improve information-sharing and transparency in voluntary supply chain initiatives through an independent annual reporting service and learning network. The SSI began in 2008 and is coordinated by the [[International Institute for Environment and Development]] (IIED), the [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] (IISD), [http://www.aidenvironment.org AidEnvironment] and the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD).

Over the past two decades a growing number of voluntary sustainability initiatives and other multi-stakeholder alliances have emerged to improve the livelihoods of the millions of commodity-dependent producers and manufacturers around the world.  The growth of such initiatives represents an important opportunity for all stakeholders to participate in the greening of global supply chains and improvement of producer livelihoods.  The multiplication of these initiatives makes it increasingly challenging for all stakeholders to stay abreast of the latest developments and best practices across the voluntary sector.  Moreover, it is exceedingly difficult to assess their utility and performance, let alone the steps required to mainstream best practice.  The reporting activities the SSI will enable stakeholders to interact with each other, helping them to benchmark performance and become more effective.

The '''State of Sustainability Initiatives Annual Review''' will begin in 2009 and will provide a regular overview of the voluntary initiatives sector, including statistics, market trends, performance metrics in development and use, forward looking strategies. Each annual issue will focus on the relationship between voluntary sustainability initiatives and a key sustainable development theme. The SSI will also peoduce journalistic updates on developments in sustainable commodity markets and voluntary initiatives around the world, and thematic reports and briefings.

== Research ==
SCI Research projects in 2008 included:
* '''Committee on Sustainability Assessment COSA)''': A scientific methodology using multi-criteria analysis for gathering and understanding concrete, fact based data on the outcomes associated with sustainability programs.
* '''China Council''': A research program funded by SECO and implemented with the Chinese Ministry of Trade. The project provides policy recommendations based on the environmental impacts of forest, cotton and electronics supply chains linked to Chinese import and export.
* '''Sustainable Commodity Evidence Base''': A DEFRA funded research program, the Sustainable Commodity Evidence Base project is implemented in collaboration with Scott Wilson, WWF and GFN. The project is aimed at providing policy recommendations based on the environmental impacts of fish meal, palm oil, soy, sugar, shrimp, forest supply chains linked to UK consumption.
* '''Sustainable Coffee Partnership''': A multi-stakeholder platform, the Sustainable Coffee Partnership is developing and implementing a global strategy for sustainability within the coffee sector.
* '''ENTWINED Consortium''': A research program funded by the MISTRA Foundation, the [http://www.entwined.se ENTWINED Consortium] is aimed at improving understanding on the economic implications and opportunities of applying trade-based policy as an instrument for improved global environmental governance.

== Publications ==
The SCI frequently publishes research reports, working papers and policy briefings and recommendations. The majority of the SCI's publications are available to download as pdfs from the [http://www.sustainablecommodities.org SCI website] and hard copies of many can be ordered.

==Terminology==
The Swedish term ''finlandssvensk'' (literally ''Finland-Swede''), which is used by the group itself, does not have an established English translation. The Society of Swedish Authors in Finland and the main political institutions for the Swedish-speaking minority such as the [[Swedish People's Party]] and [[Swedish Assembly of Finland]] use the expression ''Swedish-speaking population of Finland'', but Swedish-speaking [[NGO]]s often use the term Finland-Swedes.&lt;ref&gt;See, Finland-Swedish Think Tank Magma and Finland-Swedish Association&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Research Institute for the Languages of Finland]] proposes ''Swedish-speaking Finns'', ''Swedish Finns'', or ''Finland-Swedes'', the first of which is the sole form used on the institute's website. Some debators insist for the use of the more traditional English-language form, ''Finland-Swedes'', as they view the labelling of them as ''Swedish-speaking Finns'' as a way of depriving them their ethnic affiliation, reducing it to merely a matter of language and de-emphasising the "Swedish part" of Finland-Swedish identity, i.e. their relations to Sweden.{{#tag:ref|"Less well known internationally is the 6 percent minority of ethnic Swedes in Finland. While we never hear of 'Sami-speaking Norwegians', 'Hebrew-speaking Palestinians' etc., one often stumbles on the term 'Swedish-speaking Finns' to denote a certain group of ethnic Swedes.

Consistent with this, Allardt (2000:35) claims that the most serious contemporary problem for the Finland Swedes is the members of the group themselves: their 'submissiveness' and willingness to 'conceal their Finland-Swedishness' in the face of the majority. Furthermore, the Finland-Swedes' relations to Sweden are considered a sensitive issue in Finland.

===Debate about the age of the Swedish-speaking population in Finland===
The age of the Swedish-speaking population in the territory that today constitutes Finland was a subject of fierce debate in the early 20th century as a part of the [[Finland's language strife]]. Some Finland-Swede scholars, such as [[Ralf Saxen|Ralf Saxén]], [[Hugo Pipping|Knut Hugo Pipping]] and [[T.E. Karsten|Tor Karsten]], used place names in trying to prove that the Swedish settlement in Finland dates back to prehistoric times. Their views were opposed mainly by [[Heikki Ojansuu]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kotikielenseura.fi/virittaja/hakemistot/jutut/1980_319.pdf|title=Nimistö Suomen esihistorian tutkimuksen aineistona|last=Kiviniemi|first=Eero|date=1980|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the historian Hämäläinen (as referenced by McRae 1993) addressed the strong correlation between the scholar's mother-tongue and the views on the age and continuity of the Scandinavian settlement history of Finland.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whereas Finnish-speaking scholars tended to deny or minimize the presence of Swedish-speakers before the historically documented Swedish expeditions starting from the 12th century, Swedish-speaking scholars have found archeological and philological evidence for a continuous and Swedish or Germanic presence in Finland from pre-historic times."&lt;ref&gt;McRae, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|"Many scholars were drawn into this debate, and a later writer notes "a correlation between the scholar's mother-tongue and his view on the age and continuity of Scandinavian settlements of the country" (Hämäläinen, 1966), whereas Finnish writers tended to deny or minimize the presence of Swedish speakers before the historically documented expeditions of the twelfth century, Swedish-speaking scholars have found archeological and philological evidence for a continuous Swedish or Germanic presence in Finland from pre-historic times."&lt;ref&gt;McRae 1993, ''Conflict and Compromise in Multilingual Society'', case Finland.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Medieval Swedish colonisation===
The first Swedish arrivals in Finland have often been linked to the putative [[First Swedish Crusade]] (ca. 1150) which, if it took place, served to expand Christianity and annex Finnish territories to the kingdom of Sweden. Simultaneously the growth of population in Sweden, together with lack of land, resulted in Swedish settlements in Southern and Western coastal areas of Finland.{{#tag:ref|" Den svenska kolonisationen av Finland och områdets införlivande med Sverige hör till detta sammanhang. Sveriges jord räckte inte under denna expansiva tid till för befolkningen i Sverige. Skaror av svenskar sökte sig nytt land i Finlands kustområden, och fann där nya boplatser.

Their departure from Sweden proper to Finland was encouraged and organized by the Swedish authorities.{{#tag:ref|"Den svenska kolonisationen hade en uppenbar masskaraktär och var styrd uppifrån, främst av kronan, vilket framgår av att hemmanen var kronohemman.

===Nationalism and language strife===
{{Main|Finland's language strife}}

The proportion of Swedish speakers in Finland has declined since the 18th century, when almost 20% spoke Swedish (these 18th-century statistics excluded [[Karelia]] and [[Kexholm County]], which were ceded to Russia in 1743, and the northern parts of present-day Finland were counted as part of [[Norrland]]). When the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] was formed and Karelia was reunited with Finland, the share of Swedish speakers was 15% of the population.
  
During the 19th century a national awakening occurred in Finland. It was supported by the Russian central administration for practical reasons, as a security measure to weaken Swedish influence in Finland. This trend was reinforced by the general wave of nationalism in Europe in the mid-19th century. As a result, under the influence of the German idea of one national language, a strong movement arose that promoted the use of the Finnish language in education, research and administration.{{#tag:ref|"Den nationella rörelsen i Finland, fennomanin, som utgick från Friedrich Hegels tankar, strävade efter att skapa en enad finsk nation för att stärka Finlands ställning. Nationens gränser skulle sammanfalla med dess folks gränser, och alltså också dess språks gränser. Målet var bland annat en förfinskning av Finland"&lt;ref&gt;Tavaststjerna i provinsialismernas snårskog.Det sverigesvenska förlagsargumentet i finlandssvensk språkvård Av CHARLOTTA AF HÄLLSTRÖM-REIJONEN, 2007 http://www.kotus.fi/files/912/152-192.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Many influential Swedish-speaking families learned Finnish, [[fennicized]] their names and changed their everyday language to Finnish, sometimes not a very easy task. This linguistic change had many similarities with the linguistic and cultural revival of 19th century Lithuania where many former Polish speakers expressed their affiliation with the Lithuanian nation by adopting Lithuanian as their spoken language. As the educated class in Finland was almost entirely Swedish-speaking, the first generation of the Finnish nationalists and [[Fennomans]] came predominantly from a Swedish-speaking background.

The language issue was not primarily an issue of ethnicity, but an [[Ideology|ideological]] and [[Philosophy|philosophical]] issue as to what language policy would best preserve Finland as a nation. This also explains why so many academically educated Swedish speakers changed to Finnish: it was motivated by ideology. Both parties had the same patriotic objectives, but their methods were completely the opposite. The language strife would continue up until [[World War II]].

The majority of the population – both Swedish and Finnish speakers – were farmers, fishermen and other workers. The farmers lived mainly in unilingual areas, while the other workers lived in bilingual areas such as Helsinki. This co-existence gave birth to [[Helsinki slang]] – a Finnish slang with novel slang words of Finnish, local and common Swedish and Russian origin. Helsinki was primarily Swedish-speaking until the late 19th century, see further: [[Fennicization of Helsinki]].

===The Swedish nationality and quest for territorial recognition===
The Finnish-speaking parties, under the lead of Senator [[Eemil Nestor Setälä|E.N Setälä]] who played a major role in the drafting the language act (1922) and the language paragraphs (1919) in the Finnish constitution, interpreted the language provisions so that they are not supposed to suggest the existence of two nationalities. According to this view Finland has two national languages but only one nationality. This view was never shared in the Swedish-speaking political circles and paved the way for a linguistic conflict. Contrary to the Finnish-speaking view the leaders of the Swedish nationality movement ([[Axel Lille]] and others) maintained that the Swedish population of Finland constituted a nationality of its own and the provisions of the constitution act were seen to support the view.&lt;ref name="Modeen_56"/&gt; The Finnish-speaking political circles denoted the cultural rights of Finland-Swedes as minority rights. The Finland-Swedish political view emphasized the equality of the Swedish nationality next to the Finnish-speaking nationality and the fact the national languages of Finland were the languages of the respective nationalities of the country, not the languages of the state itself. The concept of minority, although de facto the case for Swedish speakers, was perceived as being against the spirit of the constitution. However, gradually after the Second World War, the concept of minority has been increasingly applied to Swedish speakers, even within the Finland-Swedish political discourse.

The Swedish nationality movement was effectively mobilized during the aftermath of Finnish independence and the civil war that shortly followed. The Swedish assembly of Finland was founded to protect the linguistic integrity of Swedish-speakers and seek fixed territorial guarantees for the Swedish language for those parts of the country where Swedish speakers made up the local majority.&lt;ref&gt;Nikander, Gabriel &amp; Ernst von Born, 1921.Den svenska nationaliteten i Finland. Helsingfors. Holger Schildts Förlagsaktiebolag.&lt;/ref&gt; The Finnish-speaking parties and leadership studiously avoided self-government for Swedish speakers in the Finnish mainland. Of the broader wishes of the Swedish-speaking political movement only cultural concessions—most notably administrative autonomy for Swedish schools and a Swedish [[diocese]]—were realized, which nevertheless were sufficient to prevent more thorough conflict between the ethno-linguistic groups.{{#tag:ref|"For the mainland provinces, the Finnish-speaking parties and leadership studiously avoided self-government for Swedish speakers but instead offered cultural concessions—most notably administrative autonomy for Swedish schools and a Swedish diocese—that were sufficient to satisfy moderate Swedish-speakers and to discourage activists from striving for more. As our previous analysis has suggested at several points, a retrospective view of subsequent language development strongly suggest that the centre-oriented Swedish-speaking leadership made a flawed decision in accepting this settlement, though whether more could have been achieved at that point by harder bargaining is difficult to assess".{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}|group=Note}}{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Developments since the late 19th century===
The urbanization and industrialization that began in the late 19th century increased the interaction between people speaking different languages with each other, especially in the bigger towns. Helsinki (Helsingfors in Swedish and dominantly used until the late 19th century), named after medieval settlers from the Swedish province of [[Hälsingland]], still mainly Swedish speaking in the beginning of the 19th century, attracted Finnish-speaking workers, civil servants and university students from other parts of Finland, as did other Swedish-speaking areas.{{#tag:ref|"In towns, however, the linguistic balance started to change in the 20th century. The most significant changes have taken place in the past few decades, when new native speakers of Finnish moved into the towns in large numbers. The capital region of Helsinki has been affected the most by this development. Gradually, what were formerly profoundly Swedish-speaking parishes in the countryside have become densely populated towns with a majority of Finnish-speaking inhabitants"&lt;ref name="Pitkänen_Saarikivi"/&gt;|group=Note}} As a result, the originally unilingual Swedish-speaking coastal regions in the province of [[Uusimaa|Nyland]] [[Uusimaa]] were cut into two parts. There was a smaller migration in the opposite direction, and a few Swedish-speaking "islands" emerged in towns like [[Tampere]], [[Oulu]] and [[Kotka]].

According to official statistics, Swedish speakers made up 12.89% of the total population of Finland of 2.6 million in 1900. By 1950 the share had fallen to 8.64% of a total of 4 million people. By 1990 the share was 5.94% of 5 million people. This sharp decline has since levelled off to a decline of 0.02% or 0.03% per year.

An important contribution to the decline of Swedish speakers in Finland during the second half of the 20th century was that many Swedish speakers emigrated to Sweden. An estimated 30% – 50% of all Finnish citizens who moved to Sweden were Swedish-speaking Finns. Reliable statistics are not available, as the Swedish authorities, as opposed to their Finnish counterpart, do not register languages. Another reason is that the [[natural increase]] of the Finnish-speakers has been somewhat faster than that of the Swedish-speakers until recent times, when the trend has reversed.

During most of the 20th century, marriages across language borders tended to result in children becoming Finnish speakers, and knowledge of Swedish declined. During the last decades the trend has been reversed: many bilingual families chose to register their children as Swedish speakers and put their children in Swedish schools. One motive is the language skills needed during their professional lives. Population statistics do not recognize bilingualism.

==Historical relationship of the Swedish- and Finnish-speaking populations==
The Finnish substrate toponyms (place names) within today's Swedish-speaking areas have been interpreted as indicative of earlier Finnish settlements in the area.{{#tag:ref|"However, this does not mean that Swedes would have inhabited only settled areas that were completely unpopulated. Indeed, it is probable that no such areas were available. We can assume that the rest of the coastal area was inhabited by Finns at the time when the Swedish settlers arrived in the country. Our assumption is based on place names: the Swedish place names on the coast include numerous Finnish substrate names—incontrovertible proof of early Finnish settlement."&lt;ref name="Pitkänen_Saarikivi"&gt;Borrowing of Place Names in the Uralian Languages, edited by Ritva Liisa Pitkänen and Janne Saarikivi [http://mek.oszk.hu/06000/06010/06010.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}{{#tag:ref|"Another indication of older Finnish settlement is evidenced by the fact that native speakers of Finnish named so many different types of places in the area that the substrate nomenclature seems to consist of names referring to village settlement rather than to names of natural features."&lt;ref name="Pitkänen_Saarikivi"/&gt;|group=Note}} A toponymical analysis from e.g. the Turunmaa archipelago—today largely Swedish-speaking—suggests the existence of a large population of native Finnish speakers up until the early modern age.{{#tag:ref|"This seems to support our conception that there was a large population of native speakers of Finnish in the archipelago and that it remained Finnish-speaking for a longer period than was previously believed."&lt;ref name="Pitkänen_Saarikivi"/&gt;|group=Note}} Whether the Finnish settlements prior the arrival of the Swedes have been permanent or seasonal is debated.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} According to another toponymic study, some Finnish villages and farms on the south-western coast and the archipelago became Swedish-speaking by assimilation.{{#tag:ref|"The Swedish colonization primarily focused on coastal areas and the archipelago, but eventually expanded as farms and villages that had previously been Finnish became Swedish-speaking".&lt;ref&gt;A study by Lars Huldén, Professor of Scandinavian Philology (2001), referred in the doctoral dissertation by Felicia Markus ''Living on the Other Shore''. Stockholm University 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

According to another view (e.g. Tarkiainen 2008) the two major areas of Swedish language speakers ([[Uusimaa]] and [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]]) were largely uninhabited at the time of the arrival of Swedes.{{#tag:ref|"Östra Nyland var vid 1200-talets mitt ett ännu jungfruligt område än västra Nyland. Landskapet hade karaktären av en ofantlig, nästan obebudd ödemark med en havskust som endast sporadiskt, vid tiden för strömnings och laxfiske, besöktest av finnar från Tavastland samnt troligen även av samer"&lt;ref name="Tarkiainen"/&gt; "Efter kolonisationen fick kusten nästan helsvensk bosättning; bynamnen är till 70-100% av svensk ursprung.

According to an interpretation based on the results of recent (2008) genome-wide SNP scans and on church records from the [[early modern]] period, Swedish-speaking peasantry has been overwhelmingly endogamous. Historian Tarkiainen (2008) presents that from the late Middle Ages onwards until relatively recent times, Swedish-speaking peasants tended to select their marriage partners from the same parish, often from the same village as themselves. This tends to be the rule among traditional peasant communities everywhere. As tightly-knit peasant communities tend to assimilate potential newcomers very quickly, this has meant that most marriages within the Swedish-speaking peasantry during this period were contracted with members of the same language group. During the time of early immigration by Swedes to the coastal regions (approximatively between 1150 and 1350), the situation was different and according to a study from the 1970s (as referenced by Tarkiainen, 2008) the intermarriage rate between local Finns and Swedish newcomers was considerable. According to Tarkiainen, in the areas of initial Swedish immigration, the local Finns were assimilated into the Swedish-speaking population.{{#tag:ref|"Från senare tid vet man genom släktforskning att den svenska kustbefolkningen har varit starkt endogam i sin fortplantning, på så sätt att äkta makar kom från familjer som levde nära varandra, ofta i samma by. Så var fallet överallt bland allmogen, även den finska, och man gissar att antalet blandäktenskap mellan kontrahenter från olika språkgrupper under den tid som kyrkoböcker har förts har hållit sig stadigt under en procentenhet. När befolkningstalet har uppnått en viss storlek och näringslivet stabiliserats är det lätt att finna sin äktenskapliga partner på nära håll. Invandringstiden tycks däremot ha varit en tid då ett stort antal blandäktenskap ingicks mellan svenskar och finnar i de kustnära bygderna. Förhållandena måste ha varit mycket rörliga och den manliga övervikten bland inflyttarna stor. Forskarna har räknat ut att om blandningsprocenten var ca 20 procent - d.v.s. om bara vart femte äktenskap var ett blandäktenskap  - skulle det ha tagit fyra till fem generationer innan de gemensamma dragen utgjorde 60 procent av de två gruppernas totala genuppsättning. Om blandningsprocenten däremot var endast 10 procent - bara vart tionde äktenskap var svensk-finskt - skulle det ha tagit åtta till nio generationer att uppnå samma resultat. Med tanke på att kolonisationstiden varade ungefär från 1150 till 1300, eller kanske 1350, och generationerna var kortare än i dag, är båda alternativen möjliga. Mest troligt är det att blandäktenskap var mycket vanliga i kolonisationens tidigaste fas. Det stora upptagandet av finska ortnamn tyder på detta, liksom också den finskpåverkade satsintonation som de finlandssvenska dialekterna uppvisar. Man får sålunda sannolikt räkna med en hög andel finnar, inte bara in särskilda byar eller "finnbölen", utan också i de svenska bosättningarna som familjemedlemmar och tjänstefolk. Språksituationen kan sålunda under den tidiga kolonisationsfasen och tiderna därefter betraktas som blandspråkig. Först så småningom smälter det finska inslaget ihop med det svenska och det exogama samhället sluter sig och blir endogamt".&lt;ref name="Tarkiainen"/&gt;|group=Note}}

===Culture, literature and folklore===
The Finland-Swedish folklore at the coast has been traditionally maritime influenced. The themes for the folklore are typical in the Nordic context. Stories and tales involving the evil water-spirit are in central. The origins of the tales have been German and French from where they have adapted to the Nordic-milieu. The (Finland)-Swedish folklore has had a significant impact also to the folklore of Finnish-speakers.{{#tag:ref|"En del av stoffet har har gått vidare till finnarna och utgör ett element i västra Finlands folklore. Särskilt när det gäller folksångerna har finlandssvenskarna haft en stor betydelse för den yngre finska folkpoesin".&lt;ref name="Tarkiainen"/&gt;|group=Note}}

Finland-Swedish literature has a rich legacy. Under the lead of [[Edith Södergran]], who also captivated audiences in English-speaking world, [[Gunnar Björling]] and [[Elmer Diktonius]], the Finland-Swedish modernists of the early 20th century had a significant impact for the whole Scandinavian modernism.

[[Tove Jansson]] is perhaps the most renowned example of Finland-Swedish prose. Her [[Moomin]] books have fascinated children and adults throughout the world.

==Genetics==
In a 2008 study a joint analysis was performed for the first time on Swedish and Finnish autosomal genotypes. Swedish-speakers from Ostrobothnia (reference population of the study representing 40% of all Swedish-speakers in Finland) did not differ significantly from the neighbouring, adjacent Finnish-speaking populations but formed a genetic cluster with the [[Swedish people|Swedes]]{{#tag:ref|"Clear East-West duality was observed when the Finnish individuals were clustering using Geneland. Individuals from the Swedish-speaking part of Ostrobotnia clustered with Sweden when a joint analysis was performed on Swedish and Finnish autosomal genotypes".&lt;ref&gt;Population Genetic Association and Zygosity testing on preamplified Dna. 2008.

According to a 2008 Y-DNA study, a Swedish-speaking reference group from [[Larsmo]], Ostrobothnia, differed significantly from the Finnish-speaking sub-populations in the country in terms of Y-STR variation. This study however was comparing one small Swedish-speaking municipality of 4652 inhabitants to Finnish-speaking provinces and only tells about the origin of two different Y-DNA haplotypes.{{#tag:ref|"The subpopulation LMO (Larsmo, Swedish-speaking) differed significantly from all the other populations". "The geographical substructure among the Finnish males was notable when measured with the ΦST values, reaching values as high as ΦST=0.227 in the Yfiler data. This is rather extreme, given that, e.g., subpopulations Larsmo and Kymi are separated by mere 400 km, with no apparent physical dispersal barriers between them".&lt;ref&gt;Jukka U. Palo et al. 2008.

According to a sociological study published in 1981, the Swedish-speaking Finns meet the four major criteria for a separate ethnic group: self-identification of ethnicity, language, social structure, and ancestry.{{#tag:ref|Finland has generally been regarded as an example of a monocultural and egalitarian society. However, Finland has a Swedish-speaking minority that meets the four major criteria of ethnicity, i.e. self-identification of ethnicity, language, social structure and ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Allardt and Starck, 1981; Bhopal, 1997). [http://her.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/18/6/770 Markku T. Hyyppä and Juhani Mäki: Social participation and health in a community rich in stock of social capital]&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} However, not all Swedish-speaking Finns are willing to self-identify as representatives of a distinct ethnicity. The major political organisation representing the Swedish-speakers in Finland, the [[Swedish People's Party (Finland)|Swedish People's Party]], has defined the Swedish-speaking Finns as a people who express Finnish identity in the Swedish language. The issue is debated: an opposite view is still that the Swedish-speaking Finns are a sub-group of the ethnic Swedes, ''östsvenskar'' or "East Swedes".

Despite these varying viewpoints, the Swedish-speaking population in Finland in general have their own identity distinct from that of the majority, and they wish to be recognized as such.{{#tag:ref|"The identity of the Swedish[-speaking] minority is however clearly Finnish (Allardt 1997:110). But their identity is twofold: They are both Finland Swedes and Finns (Ivars 1987)." (Die Identität der schwedischen Minderheit ist jedoch eindeutig finnisch (Allardt 1997:110). Ihre Identität ist aber doppelt: sie sind sowohl Finnlandschweden als auch Finnen (Ivars 1987).)&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021229101429/http://www.linguistik-online.de/3_00/saari.html Saari, Mirja: Schwedisch als die zweite Nationalsprache Finnlands] . Retrieved 10 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} In speaking Swedish, Swedish-speaking Finns predominantly use the Swedish word ''finländare'' (approximately translatable as ''Finlanders'') when referring to all Finnish nationals. The purpose is to use a term that includes both themselves and Finnish-speaking Finns because the Swedish word ''finnar'', in Finland-Swedish usage, implies a Finnish-speaking Finn. In Sweden, this distinction between ''finländare'' and ''finnar'' is not widely understood and often not made.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

In literature regarding to international law and minority rights, a view that the Swedish-speakers in Finland not only constitute an ethnic minority but a distinct nationality has also been presented.{{#tag:ref|"In Finland this question (Swedish nationality) has been subjected to much discussion. The Finnish majority tries to deny the existence of a Swedish nationality. An example of this is the fact that the statutes always use the concept "Swedish-speaking" instead of Swedish", "The wording of the Finnish Constitution (Art. 14.1): "Finnish and Swedish shall be the national languages of the republic" has been interpreted by linguist and constitution-writing politician E.N. Setälä and others as meaning that these languages are the State languages of Finland instead of the languages of the both nationalities of Finland", "It is not correct to call a nationality a linguistic group or minority, if it has developed culture of its own. If there is not only a community of language, but also of other characteristics such as folklore, poetry and literature, folk music, theater, behavior, etc."&lt;ref name="Modeen_56"/&gt;|group=Note}}

Marriages between Swedish- and Finnish-speakers are nowadays very common. According to a study commissioned by the Swedish Assembly of Finland in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.folktinget.fi/pdf/publikationer/finlanssv2005.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 48.5% of all families with children where at least one of the parents was Swedish-speaking were bilingual in the sense of one parent being Swedish- and the other Finnish-speaking (only families living in those municipalities where Swedish was at least a co-official language were included in this study). 67.7% of the children from these bilingual families were registered as Swedish-speaking. The proportion of those who attended schools where Swedish was the language of instruction was even higher.  The Finnish authorities classify a person as a Swedish- or Finnish-speaker based only upon that person's (or parent's) own choice, which can be changed at any time. It is only possible to be registered either as Swedish- or Finnish-speaking, not both as in Canada, for example. It is significantly more common nowadays than it used to be{{when|date=July 2012}} for children from bilingual families to be registered as Swedish-speaking.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Historical predominance of the Swedish language among the gentry==
[[Image:GustafHorn.jpg|100px|left|thumb|Finnish 17th century nobleman [[Gustaf Horn]] ]]

Areas of modern-day Finland were integrated into the [[Realm of Sweden|Swedish realm]] in the 13th century, at a time when that realm was still in the [[Consolidation of Sweden|process of being formed]]. At the time of [[Late Middle Ages]] [[Medieval Latin|Latin]] was still the language of instruction from the secondary school upwards and in use among the educated class and priests. As Finland was part of [[Sweden proper]] for 550 years, [[Swedish language|Swedish]] was the language of the nobility, administration and education. Hence the two highest [[estates of the realm]], i.e. [[Nobility|nobles]] and [[clergy|priests]], had Swedish as their language. In the two minor estates, [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]] and [[peasant]]s, Swedish also held sway, but in a more varying degree depending on regional differences.

Most noble families of the medieval period arrived directly from Sweden.{{#tag:ref|"Nyland has always been characterised as an area of medieval colonisation conducted by the Swedes. Previously this colonisation has been seen as an immigration of independents peasants. As a new result a significant noble impact has been verified both in the colonisation activity itself and the establishing of parish churches as well".&lt;ref&gt;Haggren &amp; Jansson, 2005. New light on the colonisation of Nyland, http://www.ennenjanyt.net/4-04/haggren.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}{{#tag:ref|"Frälseståndets ursprung var till två tredjedel svenskt, till en tredjedel tyskt. Någon social rörelse som skulle ha fört kristnade finnar uppåt till dessa poster fanns inte, då jordegendomen inte var ett vilkor för en ledande ställning inom förvaltning, rättskipning och skatteadministration".&lt;ref name="Tarkiainen"/&gt;|group=Note}} A significant minority of the nobility had foreign origins (predominantly [[Germans|German]]), but their descendants normally adopted Swedish as their first language.

The clergy in the earlier part the formation of the [[Lutheran Church]] (in its [[High Church Lutheranism|High Church]] form) was constituted most often of the wealthier strata of the peasantry with the closely linked medieval [[Finnish nobility]] and the rising burgher class in the expanding cities. The Church required fluency in Finnish from clergymen serving in predominantly or totally Finnish-speaking parishes (most of the country); consequently clerical families tended to maintain a high degree of functional bilingualism. Clerical families in the whole seem to have been more fluent  in Finnish than the burghers as whole. In the [[Middle Ages]], commerce in the Swedish realm, including Finland, was dominated by German [[merchants]] who immigrated in large numbers to the cities and towns of Sweden and Finland.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} As a result, the wealthier burghers in Sweden (and in cities as [[Turku]] (Åbo) and [[Vyborg]] (Viborg)) during the late Middle Ages tended to be of German origin. In the 19th century, a new wave of immigration came from German-speaking countries predominantly connected to commercial activities, which has formed a notable part of the grand bourgeoisie in Finland to this day .{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

After the [[Finnish war]], Sweden lost Finland to Russia. During the [[Grand Duchy of Finland|period of Russian sovereignty]] (1809–1917) the Finnish language was promoted by the Russian authorities as a way to sever the cultural and emotional ties with Sweden and to counter the threat of a reunion with Sweden. Consequently, the Finnish language began to replace Swedish in the administrative and cultural sphere during the later part of the 19th century.

The rise of the Finnish language to an increasingly prevalent position in society was, at the outset, mainly a construct of eager promoters of the Finnish language from the higher strata of society, mainly with Swedish-speaking family backgrounds. A later development, especially at the beginning of the 20th century, was the adoption or translation or modification of Swedish surnames into Finnish ([[fennicization]]). This was generally done throughout the entire society. In upper-class families it was predominantly in cadet branches of families that the name translations took place.&lt;ref&gt;See [[List of Finnish noble families]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to the Swedish language was partly based around historical prejudices and conflicts that had sprung up during the 19th century. The intensified [[Finland's language strife|language strife]] and the aspiration to raise the Finnish language and Finnic culture from peasant status to the position of a national language and a national culture gave rise to negative portrayals of Swedish speakers as foreign oppressors of the peaceful Finnish-speaking peasant.

Even though the proportional distribution of Swedish-speakers among different social strata closely reflects that of the general population, there is still a lingering conception of Swedish as a language of the historical upper class culture of Finland. This is reinforced by the fact that Swedish-speakers are statistically overrepresented among "[[old money]] " families as well as within the [[Finnish nobility]] consisting of about 6000 persons, of which about two thirds are Swedish-speakers. Still the majority of the Swedish-speaking Finns have traditionally been farmers and fishermen from the Finnish coastal municipalities and archipelago.

==Bilingualism==
[[Image:Helsinki bus stop sign.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Many geographical places in Finland have two names.]]

Finland is a [[bilingual]] country according to its [[Constitution of Finland|constitution]]. This means that members of the Swedish language minority have the right to communicate with the state authorities in their mother tongue.

On the municipal level, this right is legally restricted to municipalities with a certain minimum of speakers of the minority language. All Finnish communities and towns are classified as either monolingual or bilingual. When the proportion of the minority language increases to 8% (or 3000), then the municipality is defined as bilingual, and when it falls below 6%, the municipality becomes monolingual. In bilingual municipalities, all civil servants must have satisfactory language skill in either Finnish or Swedish (in addition to native-level skill in the other language). Both languages can be used in all communications with the civil servants in such a town. Public signs (such as street and traffic signs, as illustrated) are in both languages in bilingual towns and municipalities the name in majority language being on the top.

The Swedish-speaking areas in Finnish Mainland do not have fixed territorial protection, unlike the languages of several national minorities in Central Europe such as [[German-speaking community in Belgium|German in Belgium]] and [[South Tyrol|North Italy]]. This has caused a heated debate among Swedish-speaking Finns. The current language act of Finland has been criticized as inadequate instrument to protect the linguistic rights of Swedish-speaking Finns in practice.{{#tag:ref|"One factor for instability is that Finland's language legislation, unlike that of Belgium or Switzerland, is based on flexible rather than fixed linguistic territoriality, except in the Åland islands, where Swedish enjoys a permanently protected special status"&lt;ref&gt;Finland: Marginal Case of Bicommunalism?, Kenneth D.

Following an educational reform in the 1970s, both Swedish and Finnish became [[Mandatory Swedish|compulsory school subjects]]. The school subjects are not called ''Finnish'' or ''Swedish''; the primary language in which lessons are taught depends upon the pupil's mother tongue. This language of instruction is officially and in general practice called the ''mother tongue'' (''{{lang|fi|äidinkieli}}'' in Finnish, ''{{lang|sv|modersmål}}'' in Swedish). The secondary language, as a school subject, is called the ''other domestic language'' (''{{lang|fi|toinen kotimainen kieli}}'' in Finnish, ''{{lang|sv|andra inhemska språket}}'' in Swedish). Lessons in the "other domestic language" usually start in the third, fifth or seventh form of [[comprehensive school]] and are a part of the curriculum in all secondary education. In [[institute of technology#Finland - Ammattikorkeakoulu - Yrkeshögskola|polytechnics]] and [[university|universities]], all students are required to pass an examination in the "other domestic language" on a level that enables them to be employed as civil servants in bilingual offices and communities. The actual linguistic abilities of those who have passed the various examinations however vary considerably.

Being a small minority usually leads to functional bilingualism. Swedish-speaking Finns are more fluent in Finnish than Finnish-speakers are in Swedish due to the practical matter of living in a predominantly Finnish-speaking country. In big cities with a significant Swedish-speaking population such as [[Helsinki]] and [[Turku]], most of them are fluent in both Swedish and Finnish. Although in some municipalities Swedish is the only official language, Finnish is the dominant language in most towns and at most employers in Finland. In areas with a Finnish-speaking majority, Finnish is most often used when interacting with strangers and known Finnish speakers. However, 50% of all Swedish speakers live in areas in which Swedish is the majority language and in which they can use Swedish in all or most contexts (see demographics below).

Swedish speakers have migrated to many parts of the world. For a number of reasons such as geographic and linguistic among others [[Sweden]] has traditionally been the number one destination for Swedish-speaking emigrants and about 65 000 Finland-Swedes live in Sweden, according to ''[[:sv:Finlandssvenskarnas Riksförbund i Sverige|Finlandssvenskarnas Riksförbund i Sverige]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fris.nu/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Timothy James "T.J." Clark''' (born 12 April 1943 in [[Bristol]], England) is a British art historian and writer. He taught art history in a number of universities in England and the United States, including [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

Clark has been influential in developing the field of art history, examining modern paintings as an articulation of the social and political conditions of modern life. His orientation is distinctly leftist, and he has often referred to himself as a Marxist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistorians.info/clarkt|title=Clark, T. J.|first=|last=admin|date=21 February 2018|website=arthistorians.info|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/T-J--Clark-and-the-Marxist-critique-of-modern-painting-6863|title=T.J. Clark and the Marxist critique of modern painting|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==

[[File:UC-Berkeley-campus-overview-from-hills.h.jpg|thumb|University of California, Berkeley, where Clark was a professor until his retirement in 2010]]

Clark attended [[Bristol Grammar School]]. He completed his undergraduate studies at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], he obtained a first-class honours degree in 1964. He received his PhD in art history from the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]], [[University of London]] in 1973. He lectured at the [[University of Essex]] 1967–69 and then at [[Camberwell College of Arts]] as a senior lecturer, 1970–74.

During this time he was also a member of the British Section of the [[Situationist International]], from which he was expelled along with the other members of the English section. He was also involved in the group [[King Mob]].

In 1973 he published two books based on his PhD dissertation: ''The Absolute Bourgeois: Artists and Politics in France, 1848–1851'' and ''Image of the People: Gustave Courbet and the Second French Republic, 1848–1851.'' He taught at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1974–76. In 1976, he became a founding member of the Caucus for Marxism and Art of the [[College Art Association]].

Clark returned to Britain in 1976 when he was appointed professor and head of the Department of Fine Art at the [[University of Leeds]].  In 1980 Clark joined the Department of Fine Arts at [[Harvard University]], which angered some of the more conservative, connoisseurship-oriented faculty members, especially the [[Renaissance]] art historian [[Sydney Freedberg]], with whom he had a public feud.

In 1982 he published an essay, "[[Clement Greenberg]]'s Theory of Art", critical of prevailing Modernist theory, which prompted a notable and pointed exchange with [[Michael Fried]]. This exchange contributed to the debate between formalist and social histories of art.

Clark's works have taken art history in a new direction, away from traditional preoccupations with [[artistic|style]] and [[iconography]]. His books regard modern paintings as expressions of sociopolitical conditions in modern life.

In 1988 he joined the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley, where he held the George C. and Helen N. Pardee Chair as Professor of Modern Art until his retirement.

In 1991 Clark was awarded the College Art Association's Distinguished Teaching of Art History Award. Notable students include Brigid Doherty, Hollis Clayson, [[Thomas E. Crow]], Margaret Werth, Nancy Locke, Christina Kiaer, [[Michael Kimmelman]], Howard Lay, Michael Leja, Ara H. Merjian, Richard Meyer, [[John O'Brian]], Bridget Alsdorf, Matthew Jackson, Joshua Shannon, and [[Jonathan Weinberg]].

As a member of [[Retort collective|Retort]], a Bay Area-based collective of radical intellectuals, he co-authored the book ''Afflicted Powers: Capital and Spectacle in a New Age of War'', published by Verso Books in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.versobooks.com/books/nopqrs/r-titles/retort_afflicted_powers.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923235124/http://www.versobooks.com/books/nopqrs/r-titles/retort_afflicted_powers.shtml |archivedate=23 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }} {{ISBN|1844670317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Clark received a Mellon Foundation Distinguished Achievement Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mellon.org/news_publications/announcements-1/2005-distinguished/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526042346/http://www.mellon.org/news_publications/announcements-1/2005-distinguished/ |archivedate=26 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 he received an honorary degree from the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]]. He and his wife [[Anne Wagner]], who also taught art history at Berkeley, retired in 2010 and moved to London. He continues to be active as a guest lecturer, author, and now as a poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wheelercentre.com/calendar/event/tj-clark-the-art-historian-and-the-poet/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611055847/http://wheelercentre.com/calendar/event/tj-clark-the-art-historian-and-the-poet/ |archivedate=11 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''Picasso and Truth: From Cubism to Guernica'' is based on his Mellon Lectures in Fine Art delivered in spring 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mills.edu/news/2010/newsarticle02022010art_historians.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903074707/http://www.mills.edu/news/2010/newsarticle02022010art_historians.php |archivedate=3 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Texas Workforce Commission''' is a governmental agency in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]] that provides [[unemployment benefits]] and services related to employment to eligible individuals and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twc.state.tx.us/twcinfo/whatis.html What is the Texas Workforce Commission?] Texas Workforce Commission. Retrieved on October 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

For employers, TWC offers recruiting, retention, training and retraining, and outplacement services, as well as valuable information on [[labor law]] and unemployment insurance, [[tax]]-saving programs and labor market planning. For job seekers, TWC offers career development information, job search resources, training programs, and administers the unemployment benefits program.

TWC's [[online]] job-matching system, '''WorkInTexas.com''', features thousands of opportunities for Texas jobseekers and qualified applicants for Texas employers.

One large program, the Skills Development Fund, is Texas' premier job–training program providing training dollars for Texas businesses to help workers learn new skills and upgrade existing skills.

Through TWC's new "Texas Back to Work" program, employers can earn up to $2,000 for each new employee they hire who has been receiving unemployment insurance.

TWC also administers the Texas Payday Law, Texas [[Child Labor]] Law and Child Care Services. TWC works with 28 Local Workforce Development Boards to provide employment assistance and promote self-sufficiency for customers. The boards oversee the delivery of child care services, employment and training programs for welfare recipients, as well as planning employment services in their area's Texas Workforce Centers. They also direct the services called for under the Workforce Investment Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twc.state.tx.us/twcinfo/compact.html Compact With Texans] Texas Workforce Commission.

Texas Workforce Commission. Retrieved on October 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

TWC is responsible for administering the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act to investigate and regulate unlawful forms of discrimination in employment in the state of Texas. The Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (TCHRA) is codified in chapter 21 of the Texas Labor Code although it is commonly still referred to as the TCHRA. The TCHRA/chapter 21 of the Texas Labor Code empowers the TWC similar to the federal Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC) with analogous responsibilities at the state level.

In 2016, several vocational rehabilitation services provided through the Department of Assistive and Rehabilitation Services were transferred. These included:
 
•The Vocational Rehabilitation program for individuals with visual impairments, including the Criss Cole Rehabilitation Center
•The Vocational Rehabilitation program for individuals with other disabilities
•The Business Enterprises of Texas program
•The Independent Living Services program for older individuals who are blind.
 

==Incidents==
In 2018, the Coalition of Texans with Disabilities threatened to sue because TWC staff were not offering to help Texans with disabilities receiving VR services register to vote or updating voter registration information under the 1993 National Voter Registration Act. This service had previously been provided by DARS&lt;Ref&gt; https://www.mystatesman.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/disability-group-threatens-sue-texas-over-voter-registration-policy/2NFrsVuanPjJtnazjgJAqN/&lt;/ref&gt;.TWC Staff later agreed to provide the services in a letter signed by the Texas Secretary of State&lt;ref&gt;https://www.statesman.com/news/after-lawsuit-threat-texas-agency-changes-voter-registration-policy/2wY0AtEl1L6mWjqmPFLLnK/&lt;/ref&gt; 


In 2013, a Fort Worth TWC employee was sentenced to six months in federal prison for identity theft and mail fraud. Deshon Haynes diverted unemployment insurance of deceased individuals and at least five other claimants. Haynes was also required to pay full restitution.[https://archive.is/20130721200614/http://focusdailynews.com/former-twc-employee-sentenced-to-six-years-in-prison-p7120-1.htm]

In 2011, the TWC was involved in a data breach exposing personal information of 3.5 million Texans, Encryption procedures to conceal Social Security, names, addresses, and other identifying material had not been utilized. The Texas Attorney General and the FBI reviewed security procedures [http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/FBI-AG-looking-at-how-Texans-info-was-exposed-1686684.php]

'''''Die Globalisierungsfalle: Der Angriff auf Demokratie und Wohlstand''''' is a [[1996 in literature|1996]] non-fiction book by [[Hans-Peter Martin]]  (born 1957 in [[Bregenz]], [[Austria]]), and Harald Schumann (born 1957 in [[Kassel]], [[Germany]]), that describes possible implications of current trends in [[globalization|globalisation]]. It was published in English as '''''The Global Trap: Globalization and the Assault on Democracy and Prosperity''''' in [[1997 in literature|1997]]. At this time, both authors were editors of the news magazine [[Der Spiegel]]. From 1999 to 2014, Hans-Peter Martin, who is stated in the book to be one of just three journalists to be allowed to take part in all activities at the Fairmont convention, was a member of the [[European Parliament]].

The book was a best-seller in the author's native Austria and Germany&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|quote=''The new world of brands is not a pretty place according to The Global Trap: Civilisation and the Assault on Democracy and Prosperity, by Hans Peter Martin and Harald Schumann. The German best-seller outlines the scenario as companies react to new technology and globalisation. Ultimately, a few global brands will grow to dominate, driving down taxes, starving public services of funds. Nike is one of its principal villains.''|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/its-advertising-but-not-as-we-know-it-1148300.html|title=It's advertising, but not as we know it|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=5 March 1998|author=[[Hugh Aldersey-Williams]]|accessdate=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to be a worldwide bestseller with over 800,000 copies sold and translated into 27 languages.

In particular, the book is known for defining a possible "20/80 society". In this possible society of the 21st century, 20 percent of the working age population will be enough to keep the world economy going. The other 80 percent live on some form of [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] and are entertained with a concept called "[[wikt:tittytainment|tittytainment]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Workplace Faith|url=http://kwinrc.blogspot.de/2010/12/workplace-faith.html|accessdate=4 May 2014|quote=Certain trends in society indicate that there could be several painful good-byes.  In September 1995, there was an assembly of experienced world leaders in the famous Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco.  Among them were [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], [[George H. W. Bush|George Bush]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], and [[George Schultz]].  There were also certain business magnates, key players in the IT field, as well as equally respected financiers and professors from Stanford, Harvard, and Oxford.  This "global braintrust" predicted that just 20 percent of the world's workforce will be sufficient to keep world economy going.  Just one-fifth of the workforce is needed.  The pragmatists in the Fairmont Hotel summed up our future in the ration "20:80" and the phrase "tittitainment."  In other words, 20 percent of the world's workforce will live a very active life, earn money, and have the capacity to be good consumers, regardless of which country they come from.  But what about the rest, the other 80 percent?  For them the future will be very different, as one of the leaders put it, "To have lunch - or be lunch!"  Mr Abigniew Brzezinski, the former advisor to Jimmy Carter, coined the word "Tittitainment."  This word is a combination between "entertainment" and "tits" - American slang word for female breasts.  It describes the need for plenty of entertainment and enough food to keep the world's frustrated 80 percent in a good mood!  What a world to live in!  We could be describing the Roman Empire just before its fall.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims at keeping the 80 percent of frustrated citizens happy with a mixture of deadeningly predictable, [[wikt:lowest common denominator|lowest common denominator]] entertainment for the soul and nourishment for the body.

==Contents==

The book deals mainly with the effects of globalization. It describes a growing social divide as a result of "delimitation" of the economy and a loss of political control by the state over the economic development, which is increasingly controlled by global corporations. The authors warn of a so-called "20-to-80-society"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tittytainment|url=https://errantbodiesspace.blogspot.de/2015/08/tittytainment-ylva-bentancor.html|accessdate=24 July 2017|quote=...The pragmatists in the Fairmont Hotel reduce the future to a pair of numbers and a term: "20 to 80" and "tittytainment". 20 percent of the working age population will be enough in the coming century to keep the world economy going. "More workers will not be needed", said magnate Washington SyCip. A fifth of all jobseekers will be enough to produce all the goods and perform all the top-flight services that the world society can afford.... What about the others? Will 80 percent of those willing to work be without a job? "Certainly"... The question in the future will be "to have lunch or be lunch", to eat or be devoured. ....The term "tittytainment" makes the rounds... The frustrated population of the world could be kept happy with a mixture of numbing entertainment and adequate food. The managers soberly discuss the possible doses and reflect how the wealthy fifth can employ the superfluous remnant.... The organizers of the three memorable days in the Fairmont imagined themselves underway to a new civilization. However, the direction envisaged by the assembled experts from the executive floors and science leads directly back into the pre-modern age... The world model of the future follows the formula 20 to 80. The one-fifth society is brewing in which the excluded will be immobilized with "tittytainment".}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They describe how a global 80:20 distribution already exists in many aspects, and illustrate possible economic, social and political consequences of free trade and deregulated financial markets.

In the beginning, they describe how at a conference at the invitation of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] with 500 leading politicians, business leaders and academics from all continents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What about the global poor? Globalisation from above and below|url=http://www.multiculturalaustralia.edu.au/doc/gopalkrishnan_globalisation.pdf|accessdate=14 July 2014|quote=The Foundation, headed by Mikhail Gorbachev convened a meeting to discuss the global situation inviting politicians like George Bush and Margaret Thatcher, corporate heavyweights like [[Ted Turner]] of [[CNN]], [[John Gage]] of [[Sun Microsystems]], Southeast Asian magnate SyCip, global players in finance, as well as academics from Stanford, Harvard, and Oxford. The press was noticeably kept out of the picture.}}&lt;/ref&gt; from September 27 - October 1st 1995 at the [[Fairmont San Francisco|Fairmont Hotel]] in [[San Francisco]], the term "one-fifth-society" arose. The authors describe an increase in productivity caused by the decrease in the amount of work, so this could be done by one-fifth of the global labor force and leave four-fifths of the working age people out of work. The authors predict huge number of unemployed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fairmont Conference|url=http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2007/bustani110907p.html|accessdate=14 July 2014|quote=There was no tolerance with wasted time at this conference: 5 minutes for each speaker, and 2 minutes for each comment. The condensed results of the future that the invitees came out with were terse, a cryptic duo: "20-80," and "Tittytainment." "20-80" represents the ratio of workers to unemployed in the future society. ... "Tittytainment" is a term crafted by the [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] and a portmanteau of  two words: tits (as a reference to breast-feeding) and entertainment.  This Tittytainment is a mixture of "intoxicating entertainment and sufficient nourishment" that can "tranquilize the frustrated minds of the globe's population." ... In noting the huge number who lost their jobs in the wake of 9-11, as mentioned by Petras, it is instructive to recall the statement of John Gage, one of the founders and top executives of Sun Microsystems, at the Fairmont conference back in 1995: "I have 16,000 workers, if we excluded a very few number, the vast majority are a reserve that can be laid-off when re-organizing."}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps finding themselves in low-paid voluntary community services to boost their morale.

'''''The Radical Therapist''''' was a journal that emerged in the early 1970s in the context of the [[Counterculture|counter-culture]] and the radical U.S. [[Peace movement|antiwar movement]]. It was an "alternate journal" in the [[mental health]] field that published 12 issues between 1970 and 1972, and "voiced pointed criticisms of [[psychiatrists]] during this period".&lt;ref name=talb&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?Volume=131&amp;page=121&amp;journalID=13 |title=Radical Psychiatry: An Examination of the Issues |author=John A. Talbott |date=February 1, 1974  |work=Am J Psychiatry 1974;131:121-128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was run by a group of psychiatrists and activists who believed that mental illness was best treated by [[social change]], not [[behaviour modification]]. Their motto was "Therapy means social, political and personal change, not adjustment".&lt;ref name=bitter/&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Anti-psychiatry}}

In the 1960s, a movement developed to challenge many principals of [[psychiatry]] and dispute the mental health system as a successful humanitarian enterprise. The challenge came from [[Ernest Becker]], [[Erving Goffman]], [[R.D. Laing]], [[Thomas Scheff]], and [[Thomas Szasz]]. Their writings, along with articles in the journal ''The Radical Therapist'', were given the umbrella label [[anti-psychiatry]] despite wide divergences in philosophy. This critical literature, with an associated left-wing activist movement, "emphasized the hegemony of medical model psychiatry, its spurious sources of authority, its mystification of human problems, and the more oppressive practices of the mental health system, such as involuntary hospitalisation, drugging, and electroshock".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brown.uk.com/brownlibrary/BARNEY.htm |title= Limitations of the Critique of the Medical Model |author=Ken Barney |date=Winter and Spring 1994. Volume 15. Numbers 1 and 2 Pages 19-34 |work=The Journal of Mind and Behaviour }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings: Minot, North Dakota==
''The Radical Therapist'' took shape in the winter of 1969, in [[Minot, North Dakota]], the product of three officers in the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] Regional Hospital. The idea for the journal came from Michael Glenn, a psychiatrist who had recently arrived as Chief of [[Neurology]] and [[Psychiatry]]. He was joined by David Bryan, the [[Social work|hospital social worker]], and by Michael Galan, an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] working in the hospital business office. The three of them further developed the idea, and — with Sara Glenn and Linda Bryan — formed the Radical Therapist Collective. The Collective solicited articles, [[contributing editor]]s and subscriptions, and worked to produce and distribute the [[Magazine|journal]]. After a year, they were joined by Deborah Levitt, from [[Bennington (town), Vermont|Bennington, Vermont]], who had traveled cross-country to work with them. Their manifesto stated: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Why have we begun another journal? No other publication meets the need we feel exists: to unite all people concerned with the radical analysis of therapy in this society. It is time we grouped together and made common cause. We need to exchange experience and ideas, and join others working toward change. The other “professional” journals are essentially establishment organs which back the status quo on most controversial issues… We need a new forum for our views.

In the midst of a society tormented by [[war]], [[racism]], and social turmoil, therapy goes on with business as usual. In fact, therapists often look suspiciously at [[social change]] and label as [[wikt:disturbed|‘disturbed’]] those who press towards it.

Therapy today has become a commodity, a means of social control. We reject such an approach to people`s distress. We reject the pleasant careers with which the system rewards its adherents. The social system must change, and we will be workers toward such change.&lt;ref name=bitter&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aphvan.wordpress.com/community-health-projects/bitter-melons-consciousness-raising-for-liberation/
 |title=Bitter Melons |author= |date= |work=Alliance for People's Health }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Manifesto promised that the journal would provide a needed forum for all people working in the therapy fields; work to liberate therapy, therapists and others from backwards ideology; help develop new training programs; encourage the elaboration of a new psychology of men and women, as well as a new concept of family and community life; foster the development of more responsive therapy programs under client control; encourage new techniques; and confront the various ways U.S. society uses mental health institutions to oppress various people.

The journal was highly critical of [[The Establishment|the “Establishment”]] and all its institutions. In this sense, ''The Radical Therapist'' was similar to ''The Insurgent Sociologist'', ''[[Science for the People]]'', ''[[Radical Teacher]]'', and other publications that targeted various groups of professionals whose [[political spectrum]] included [[Left-wing politics|left-leaning]], [[Political radicalism|radical]], and [[Revolutionary|revolutionary-minded activists]].

During its time in Minot, the journal was typeset and published locally, and mailed out via a collective effort. The journal printed articles critiquing the therapy “establishment” and its practice and outlining a “radical” approach to the ways therapy could be used instead. It enthusiastically promoted [[Women's liberation movement|women’s liberation]] and [[Gay Liberation|gay liberation]], and critically examined how therapy ideology and practice were alleged to contribute to sexist and [[Homophobia|homophobic oppression]], and to the [[oppression]] and abuse of [[Mental disorder|mental patients]]. “The Radical Therapist” also spoke out against the Vietnam War, racism, and the greed of [[Consumerism|consumerist]] society, and it was an early supporter of the struggle of mental patients for their rights.

Contributing editors and authors while the RT was in Minot included Joe Berke, Judith Brown, Phil Brown, [[Phyllis Chesler]], Larry Constantine, Rona Fields, Dennis Jaffe, Kenneth Keniston, David Koulack, Rick Kunnes, Terry Kupers, Howard Levy, Robert Jay Lifton, Ken Locke, Peter Roemer, Kris Rosenthal, [[Steve Sharfstein]], Pam Skinner, [[Claude Steiner]], Irving Weisberg, Steve Wood and others. Early issues of ''The Radical Therapist'' also reprinted and made more widely available articles such as [[Anne Koedt|Anne Koedt’s]] “The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm,” [[Carol Hanisch|Carol Hanish’s]] “The Personal is Political,” and Howard Levy’s “Prison Psychiatry".

The 3rd issue of the RT focussed entirely on Women. It examined both women’s oppression and women’s psychology. The issue began with an editorial by the feminist Judith Brown, and followed with the Redstockings’ “Manifesto;” a critique of male supremacy, private property and the family by [[Carol Giardina]]; and a reprint of [[Naomi Weisstein]]’s “Kinder, Kuche Kirche.”’ There were also articles by [[Kathie Sarachild]], [[Phyllis Chesler]], [[Marilyn Zweig]], [[Martha Shelley]], and others, as well as a Women’s Liberation bibliography.

During its first year, The Radical Therapist worked collegially with many other groups, including Psychologists for a Democratic Society, the Radical Caucus of the American Psychiatric Association, the Radical Caucus in the American Orthopsychiatry Association, the Association for Women in Psychology, the Feminist Psychology Coalition, the [[Medical Committee for Human Rights]], Psychologists for Social Action, Joe Berke’s Anti-Psychiatry group in London, Claude Steiner’s “Radical Psychiatry” movement in Berkeley, Dennis and Yvonne Jaffe’s Number Nine in New Haven, and other radical groups in the therapy and health professions. It reported on developments affecting mental health issues around the country, and published a list of radical therapy centers around the country.

Many of the articles which appeared during the first year of the RT were collected together in ''The Radical Therapist'', (Ballantine Books, New York, 1971), an anthology gathered together by the collective and produced by Jerome Agel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8K5rAAAAMAAJ |title=The Radical therapist |author=Jerome Agel |year=1971 |work=Ballantine Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume Two of ''The Radical Therapist'' began in Minot in April 1971. But the collective only published that one issue (Number 1) of Volume Two from Minot. That summer, after David Bryan, Michael Galan, and Michael Glenn were discharged from the Air Force, the collective moved from North Dakota to Somerville, Massachusetts. Volume Two, Number 2 which appeared in September 1971, would be the product of a substantially different collective.

==The Somerville Years: ''The Radical Therapist'' becomes ''Rough Times''==
The new Radical Therapist Collective that formed in Somerville in the late summer of 1971 included Michael Glenn, Sara Snow (Glenn) and Debbie Levitt from the Minot group, as well as Michael Galan, who continued to handle the business aspects of the journal. Phil Brown, who had been active in Psychologists for a Democratic Society, and who had enthusiastically worked with the journal since its inception, moved from New York to join the collective that summer; so did Nancy Henley, an activist feminist psychologist from Baltimore. Other new members joined the Somerville collective over the next few months. These included the therapists John Bayliss, Cynthia Ganung, and Chuck Robinson; as well as Anne Mine, Christine Nozchese and Laurin Pensel. After publishing the first Somerville issue (Volume Two, Number 2) the third issue was entirely devoted to articles from the Radical Psychiatry movement in Berkeley, California — including a number of articles by [[Claude Steiner]], Hogie Wyckoff, and Dot Vance.

By the winter of 1971, sharp political struggle had broken out in the collective over issues of elitism and professionalism. Some members raised questions as to whether therapists really had any skills at all, and whether the field had simply mystified its practices. There were also questions as to the journal’s real audience. The use of the words “radical” and “therapist” were heatedly debated; many in the collective held them to be suspect. The struggle spilled onto the pages of the journal itself. Therapists who were deeply critical of their own therapy “establishment” now found themselves having to defend therapy as a ''bona fide'' discipline — and themselves as “privileged” individuals. Contention among the collective about the journal’s name, and by implication its base and audience, deepened. Some members of the collective felt that the original focus on therapy professionals had been both limited and elitist, and the more revolutionary-minded staff members urged the journal to go beyond the therapy world and expand its support to all bona fide liberation movements. More and more, the collective simply called the journal the “RT.” Soon after arriving in Somerville, the collective established close ties with the mental patients' rights movement, including the Mental Patients Liberation Front in Boston and many others throughout North America. The RT quickly began publishing articles by its leaders, which were sharply critical of the therapy profession as a whole for tolerating and participating in a wide range of abusive psychiatric practices.

With the April 1972 issue (Volume Two, number 6), the collective changed the journal’s name to Rough Times, and stopped being a publication aimed predominantly at [[mental health professional]]s. As Nancy Henley recalled in 1980, “Many of us (and our readers) disliked the original name when it became clear that this might be a contradiction in terms, there was much more to combat than therapeutic practice; radical had bad connotations for some, therapist did for others, [and] the magazine wasn’t necessarily by or for therapists….”

By July 1972 (Volume Two, Number 8), almost all the members of the Somerville collective with any clinical therapy experience (or an identity as “therapists”) had left. From this point on, the journal’s articles were mainly written by and for people who were not therapists.

In December 1972, the RT Collective published an article, "Combat Liberalism in Radical Therapy," formally criticizing the Radical Psychiatry Center group in Berkeley. The article was sparked by the RPC's efforts to promote its own new journal to the RT's readers and by genuine political differences. The RT said it had relayed criticisms to the RPC in private, but they had been ignored. The criticisms therefore had to be made publicly. The RT decried the RPC as individualistic and middle-class. It said the RPC avoided political action or organizing, and instead clung to their elite status as therapists. "Hip therapies are part of the system," the Collective said. The RPC was too concerned with ways of "getting it together" and elaborating "how to do it" techniques, rather than "attacking the real political/economic/social bases of power." They also ignored mental patients' organizing as a major force in the mental health arena.

The RPC did not respond, but instead continued to promote its own journal, ''Issues in Radical Therapy''. After this time, the “IRT” contained articles that were concerned with “radical therapy,” whereas ''Rough Times'' focussed on exposing the abuses and oppressive institutional practices of the mental health profession, as well as on promoting liberation struggles in the U.S. and around the world, especially the movement of mental patients to defend and claim their rights.

In the second collection of articles from the RT that appeared (Rough Times, Ballantine Books, 1973—also produced by Jerome Agel), the new collective clarified its ideological perspective further:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A year ago we were fewer in number and tucked away in North Dakota. Although we had different positions on RT’s role in making a revolution, there was a de facto consensus of aiming our work toward professionals, students, and intellectuals, believing that they held the key to radical work in the mental health fields. We have been finding, primarily in the last half year, that while some of those people are open to change, most of them are too comfortable in their professionally detached attitudes, pseudo-hip life-styles, and removed position from world revolution as well as personal change.

We began to see our position in terms of being part of a revolutionary movement. Our goals were more linked to a broad-based socialist movement than to a radical caucus at a professional convention. We began to reassert, with more force and conviction, that RT should be part of a movement to build a revolutionary new world.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The new direction continues: ''Rough Times'' which later became ''State and Mind''==
By the time Volume Three, Number 1 of ''Rough Times formerly The Radical Therapist'' came out in December 1972, the collective had contracted down to a few people. An “RT Position Paper” laid out the staff’s evolved position: support for worldwide socialist revolution; belief in the exploitation of labor as today’s primary cause of people’s oppression; support for all just liberation struggles; deep involvement in and support for the mental health/self-help struggle; belief that the psychological/psychiatric establishment per se is a tool of oppression and that mental illness is a myth; demands for an end to abuses of mental patients; dedication to a search for new, liberating ways of helping people in emotional pain; and at the same time an openness to working with therapy professionals who could identify with the interests of the people.

“Rough Times” continued on for several more years, continuing to contain sections such as “Unmasking the Enemy,” “Mental Hospitals,” and “On the Move.” It reported on the struggles of mental patients for their rights and against all forms of abusive treatment. And it continued to support movements for liberation — for women, gays, mental patients, and others — around the world.

Eventually, somewhere around 1975, “Rough Times” changed its name to “State and Mind.” As such, it continued into the 1980s. Its 10th anniversary issue in the summer of 1980 contained a personal retrospective article by Nancy Henley entitled “Ten Years in the Life of a Radical Psychology Journal.”

In 1974, the psychiatrist John Talbott published an article critical of ''The Radical Therapist'' in the ''American Journal of Psychiatry''. The piece reviewed articles published in the first twelve issues, and included commentary by Dr. Talbott.&lt;ref name=talb/&gt;

'''''The Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved: Inside America's Underground Food Movements''''' is a 2003 book by food activist [[Sandor Katz]] that examines how [[Timeline of agriculture and food technology|contemporary food production differs drastically from our recent past]]. The author challenges the corporate [[food industry]] as well as the way we think about [[food]].  He suggests how traditional cultural practices of [[sustainable agriculture]] might subvert the [[Corporate farming|corporate farm system]].

An '''urban guerrilla'''  is someone who fights a [[government]] using [[unconventional warfare]] or [[domestic terrorism]] in an [[urban area|urban]] environment.

== Theory and history ==
The urban guerrilla phenomenon is essentially one of [[industrialisation|industrialised society]], resting both on the presence of large [[urban agglomeration]]s where hideouts are easy to find and on a theory of [[Social alienation|alienation]] proper to the modern society of [[mass consumption]].

[[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], a commander of the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) is often considered to be the father of modern urban guerrilla warfare.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}  In April 1919 an elite assassination unit, known as [[The Squad (Irish Republican Army unit)|The Squad]] or ''Twelve Apostles'' was created in [[Dublin]].  The unit was tasked with hunting down and executing British Intelligence operatives in the city, they can be considered one of the first true urban guerrilla units.

Historically guerrilla warfare was a rural phenomenon, it was not until the 1960s that the limitations of this form were clearly demonstrated. The technique was almost entirely ineffective when used outside of the later colonial environment, as was shown by the Cuban sponsored efforts in Latin America during the 1960s culminating in the ''[[foco]]'' campaign headed by [[Che Guevara]] in Bolivia that culminated in his death. The need for the target government to be simultaneously incompetent, iniquitous, and politically isolated was rarely met.

The failure of rural insurgency forced the discontented to find new avenues for action, essentially random terrorism aimed at creating maximum publicity, provoking the targeted regimes into excessive repression and so inciting the general population to join a wider revolutionary struggle. This movement found its mentor in the leader of the ephemeral [[Ação Libertadora Nacional]], [[Carlos Marighela]]. Before his death in 1969 he wrote the ''[[Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla]]'' which, between the polemics, gave clear advice on strategy and was quickly adopted by others around the world.

However, not all urban political violence can be labeled as ''urban guerrilla''.  The [[Black Panther Party]] might not qualify, due to its public nature, although its policy of "self-defense" was interchangeable with a policy of armed struggle in militarily occupied African American communities.  Similarly the Italian [[Autonomia]] movement, and the German [[Autonomen]] engaged in urban political violence, but not as urban guerrillas due to their policies of public, mass and non-deadly violence.

In the 1970s BBC comedy "[[Citizen Smith]]" Wolfie Smith, the leader of the fictional "Tooting Popular Front" described himself as an Urban Guerrilla.
