The '''Abri de la Madeleine''' (Magdalene Shelter) is a prehistoric shelter under an overhanging cliff situated near [[Tursac]], in the [[Dordogne]] département and the [[Aquitaine]] Région of South-Western France.  The [[Magdalenian]] culture of the [[Upper Paleolithic]] is named after it, as the [[type site]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian M. Fagan, Leo S. Klejn, Keith N. Schoville, Ian Morris, Douglas R. Givens "History of Archaeology Before 1900"   The Oxford Companion to Archaeology. Brian M. Fagan, ed., Oxford University Press 1996. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. 30 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Prehistoric finds from the site include the [[Bison Licking Insect Bite]], a carving estimated [[20,000 BC in art|20,000 BC]]. The shelter was reoccupied during the [[Middle Ages]]. The medieval castle of Petit Marsac stands on the top of the cliff just above the shelter.

==Excavations==
[[Édouard Lartet]] &amp; [[Henry Christy]] were the first systematic excavators of the site, and published their findings in 1875 as the [[Age of the Reindeer]] ("L'âge du renne").  Finds from '''la Madeleine''' are distributed among a number of museums, including the [[Muséum de Toulouse]], the [[National Archaeological Museum (France)|Musee des Antiquites Nationales]], [[St. Germain-en-Laye]] and the [[British Museum]].

'''AmeriCorps VISTA''' is a national service program designed to alleviate [[poverty]]. President [[John F. Kennedy]] originated the idea for VISTA, which was founded as Volunteers in Service to America in 1965, and incorporated into the [[AmeriCorps]] network of programs in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americorps.gov/about/programs/vista_legacy.asp |title=AmeriCorps &amp;#124; Corporation for National and Community Service |publisher=Americorps.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; VISTA is an [[initialism]] for Volunteers in Service to America.

On May 23, 2017, the President sent his official Fiscal Year 2018 (FY 2018) Budget request to Congress. As previously outlined in the President’s Budget Blueprint released in March, this budget proposes the elimination of the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) in FY 2018, and provides funding for an orderly shutdown, including all CNCS programs, such as Senior Corps and AmeriCorps (which includes VISTA and NCCC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalservice.gov/about/budget|title=Budget|website=Corporation for National and Community Service|language=en|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
VISTA is an [[poverty reduction|anti-poverty program]] created by [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s [[Economic Opportunity Act of 1964]] as the domestic version of the [[Peace Corps]].&lt;ref name="nprVISTA"&gt;"President Lyndon Johnson's Great
Society ... included a domestic equivalent of the Peace Corps called Volunteers in Service to America, or
VISTA." {{harv|Neuman|2009|p=3}}:  {{citation|first=Scott |last=Neuman |title=National Service Act continues U.S. tradition |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] (NPR.org) |date=21 April 2009 |url=http://voicesforservice.org/news/NPR_042109.pdf |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330182549/http://voicesforservice.org/news/NPR_042109.pdf |archivedate=30 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the program increased employment opportunities for conscientious people who felt they could contribute tangibly to the War on Poverty. Volunteers served in communities throughout the U.S., focusing on enriching educational programs and vocational training for the nation's underprivileged classes.

VISTA's legislative purpose, as defined under the Domestic Volunteer Service Act (DVSA) of 1973, is to supplement efforts to fight poverty in low-income communities by engaging Americans from all walks of life in a year of full-time service. VISTA members support the program's purpose through three primary objectives: 1) encouraging volunteer service at the local level, 2) generating the commitment of private sector resources, and 3) strengthening local agencies and organizations that serve low-income communities. There are currently over 5,000 VISTA members serving in over 1,000 projects throughout the nation.

During the [[Clinton Administration]], VISTA was brought under the newly created [[AmeriCorps]] program, a division of the [[Corporation for National and Community Service]], and was renamed "AmeriCorps*VISTA".  VISTA members sign up with a host agency to a full-time term of service – 365 days. In return for their service, members are provided with orientation and training, a living stipend calculated at no less than 105% of the poverty line, settling in and transportation costs, child care benefits, and a basic health care plan. Upon completion of their one-year term, VISTA members have the option of receiving a cash award or the Segal AmeriCorps Education Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 3794|url=http://www.americorps.gov/for_individuals/benefits/benefits_ed_award.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ancient history}}
{{Human history}}

'''Ancient history''' as a term refers to the aggregate of past events&lt;ref name="wordnet"&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn WordNet Search – 3.0], "History" {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050917065532/http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn |date=2005-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the beginning of writing and [[history of writing|recorded]] [[History of the world|human history]] and extending as far as the [[post-classical history]]. The phrase may be used either to refer to the period of time or the academic discipline.

The span of [[recorded history]] is roughly 5,000 years, beginning with [[Sumer]]ian [[Cuneiform script]]; the oldest discovered form of coherent writing from the [[protoliterate]] period around the 30th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Jemdet Nasr period]], [[Kish tablet]]; see also ''The Origin and Development of the Cuneiform System of Writing'', [[Samuel Noah Kramer]], ''Thirty Nine Firsts In Recorded History'', pp. 381–383&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient History covers all continents inhabited by humans in the 3,000 BC – 500 AD period.

The broad term Ancient History is not to be confused with ''Classical Antiquity''.  The term [[classical antiquity]] is often used to refer to [[Western world#Historical divisions|Western History]] in the [[History of the Mediterranean region|Ancient Mediterranean]] from the beginning of recorded Greek history in 776 BC (First [[Olympiad]]). This roughly coincides with the traditional date of the founding of Rome in 753 BC, the beginning of the history of [[ancient Rome]], and the beginning of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] in [[Ancient Greece]].

The academic term "history" is additionally not to be confused with colloquial references to times past. History is fundamentally the study of the past through documents, and can be either scientific ([[archaeology]]) or [[Humanistic historiography|humanistic]] (history through language).

Although the ending date of ancient history is disputed, some [[Western culture|Western]] scholars use the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in 476 AD (the most used),&lt;ref&gt;Clare, I.S. (1906). Library of universal history: containing a record of the human race from the earliest historical period to the present time; embracing a general survey of the progress of mankind in national and social life, civil government, religion, literature, science and art. New York: Union Book. p. 1519 (cf., Ancient history, as we have already seen, ended with the fall of the Western Roman Empire; [...])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Center for Research and Training in History. (1973). Bulgarian historical review. Sofia: Pub. House of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]. p. 43. (cf. ... in the history of Europe, which marks both the end of ancient history and the beginning of the Middle Ages, is the fall of the Western Roman Empire.)&lt;/ref&gt; the closure of the [[Platonic Academy]] in 529 AD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Greek Literature |last=Hadas |first=Moses |year=1950 |publisher= Columbia University Press |isbn=0-231-01767-7 |page=273 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dOht3609JOMC&amp;pg=PA273&amp;dq=%22end+of+antiquity%22+%2B+%22529%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the death of the emperor [[Justinian I]] in 565 AD,&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, C.A. (1951). ''Ancient history from prehistoric times to the death of Justinian''. New York: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; the coming of [[Islam]]&lt;ref&gt;Breasted, J.H. (1916). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vwZqAAAAIAAJ Ancient times, a history of the early world: an introduction to the study of ancient history and the career of early man]''. Boston: Ginn and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; or the rise of [[Charlemagne]]&lt;ref&gt;Myers, P.V.N. (1916). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gSQOAAAAYAAJ Ancient History]''. New York [etc.]: Ginn and company.&lt;/ref&gt; as the end of ancient and Classical European history. Outside of Europe the 450-500 time frame for the end of ancient times has had difficulty as a transition date from Ancient to Post-Classical times.

During the time period of 'Ancient History' starting roughly from 3000 BC [[world population]] was already exponentially increasing due to the [[Neolithic Revolution]] which was in full progress. According to HYDE estimates from the Netherlands world population increased exponentially in this period. At 10,000 BC in [[Prehistory]] world population had stood at 2 million, rising to 45 million by 3,000 BC.  By the rise of the [[Iron Age]] in 1,000 BC that population had risen to 72 million. By the end of the period in 500 AD world population stood possibly at 209 million.&lt;ref name="mnp.nl"&gt;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0959683609356587 Data] from [http://themasites.pbl.nl/tridion/en/themasites/hyde/index.html History Database of the Global Environment.]  K.

==Study==
Historians have two major avenues which they take to better understand the ancient world: [[archaeology]] and the study of [[source text]]s. [[Primary source]]s are those sources closest to the origin of the information or idea under study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lib.umd.edu/guides/primary-sources.html |title=Primary, secondary and tertiary sources |publisher=Lib.umd.edu |date=2008-05-23 |accessdate=2010-01-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091230070606/http://www.lib.umd.edu/guides/primary-sources.html| archivedate= 30 December 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml |title=Primary, secondary and tertiary sources |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050212093611/http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml |archivedate= 2005-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary sources have been distinguished from [[secondary sources]], which often cite, comment on, or build upon primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Handlin et al., ''Harvard Guide to American History'' (1954) p. 118-246&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeology===
{{Main|Archaeology}}

Archaeology is the excavation and study of artefacts in an effort to interpret and reconstruct past human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, W.M.F. (1972).

{{Main|Source text}}

Most of what is known of the ancient world comes from the accounts of antiquity's own historians. Although it is important to take into account the bias of each ancient author, their accounts are the basis for our understanding of the ancient past. Some of the more notable ancient writers include [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]], [[Arrian]], [[Plutarch]], [[Polybius]], [[Sima Qian]], [[Sallust]], [[Livy]], [[Josephus]], [[Suetonius]], and [[Tacitus]].

A fundamental difficulty of studying ancient history is that [[recorded history|recorded histories]] cannot document the entirety of human events, and only a fraction of those documents have survived into the present day.&lt;ref name="GardnerP"&gt;Gardner, P. (1892). New chapters in Greek history, historical results of recent excavations in Greece and Asia Minor. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons. pp. 1–.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the reliability of the information obtained from these surviving records must be considered.&lt;ref name="GardnerP" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M.S. (2002). The early history of God: Yahweh and the other deities in ancient Israel. The Biblical resource series. Grand Rapids, Mich: William B. Eerdmans Pub. pp. xxii–xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; Few people were capable of writing histories, as literacy was not widespread in almost any culture until long after the end of ancient history.&lt;ref&gt;Nadin, M. (1997). The civilization of illiteracy. Dresden: Dresden University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known systematic historical thought emerged in [[ancient Greece]], beginning with [[Herodotus of Halicarnassus]] (484–c. 425 BC). [[Thucydides]] largely eliminated divine causality in his account of the war between Athens and Sparta,&lt;ref name="Cochrane, Charles Norris 1929. p. 179"&gt;Cochrane, Charles Norris. ''Thucydides and the Science of History'', Oxford University Press, 1929. p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; establishing a rationalistic element which set a precedent for subsequent Western historical writings. He was also the first to distinguish between cause and immediate origins of an event.&lt;ref name="Cochrane, Charles Norris 1929. p. 179" /&gt;

The [[Roman Empire]] was one of the ancient world's most literate cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Harris, W.V. (1989). Ancient literacy. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. (cf. ... extent of literacy in the Roman Empire has been investigated, previous writers have generally concluded that a high degree of literacy ...)&lt;/ref&gt; but many works by its most widely read historians are lost. For example, [[Livy]], a Roman historian who lived in the 1st century BC, wrote a history of Rome called ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' (''From the Founding of the City'') in 144 volumes; only 35 volumes still exist, although short summaries of most of the rest do exist. Indeed, only a minority of the work of any major Roman historian has survived.

==Chronology==

===Prehistory===
{{Main|Prehistory|Neolithic Revolution}}

Prehistory is the period before [[Recorded history|written history]]. The [[early human migration]]s&lt;ref&gt;H. Liu, F. Prugnolle, A. Manica, F. Balloux, ''A Geographically Explicit Genetic Model of Worldwide Human-Settlement History.'' The American Journal of Human Genetics, Volume 79, Issue 2, pp. 230–237&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Lower Paleolithic]] saw [[Homo erectus]] spread across Eurasia 1.8 million years ago. The controlled use of fire occurred 800,000 years ago in the [[Middle Paleolithic]]. 250,000 years ago, [[Homo sapiens]] (modern humans) [[Human evolution|emerged]] in [[Africa]]. 60–70,000 years ago, Homo sapiens migrated out of Africa along a coastal route to [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] and reached [[Australia]]. 50,000 years ago, modern humans spread from [[Asia]] to the [[Near East]]. [[Europe]] was first reached by modern humans 40,000 years ago. Humans [[migration to the New World|migrated to the Americas]] about 15,000 years ago in the [[Upper Paleolithic]].

The 10th millennium BC is the earliest given date for the [[Neolithic revolution|invention of agriculture]] and the beginning of the ancient era. [[Göbekli Tepe]] was erected by [[hunter-gatherer]]s in the [[10th millennium BC]] (c. 11,500 years ago), before the advent of [[sedentism]]. Together with [[Nevali Cori|Nevalı Çori]], it has revolutionized understanding of the Eurasian [[Neolithic]]. In the 7th millennium BC, [[Jiahu]] culture began in [[China]]. By the 5th millennium BC, the late Neolithic civilizations saw the invention of the [[wheel]] and the spread of [[proto-writing]]. In the 4th millennium BC, the [[Cucuteni culture|Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]] in the [[Ukraine]]-[[Moldova]]-[[Romania]] region develops. By 3400 BC, "proto-literate" [[cuneiform]] is spread in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Diamond|1999|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 30th century BC, referred to as the [[Early Bronze Age II]], saw the beginning of the literate period in [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt]]. Around the 27th century BC, the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt]] and the First Dynasty of [[Uruk]] are founded, according to the earliest reliable [[regnal era]]s.

The [[Bronze Age]] forms part of the [[three-age system]]. It follows the [[Neolithic Age]] in some areas of the world. In most areas of civilization Bronze smelting became a foundation for more advanced societies. There was some contrast with New World Societies who often still preferred stone to metal for utilitarian purposes. Modern historians have identified five original civilizations which emerged in the time period.&lt;ref name="Haviland 2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haviland |first1=William |displayauthors=etal |title=Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2013 |page=250 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DfEWAAAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22civilization+refers+to+societies%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Early Civilizations: A Comparative Study'', Trigger, Bruce G., Cambridge University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2018}}

The first civilization emerged in Sumer in the southern region of Mesopotamia now part of modern-day Iraq. By 3,000 B.C, Sumerian city states had collectively formed [[civilization]], with government, religion, diversity of labor and writing. Among the city states [[Ur]] was among the most significant.
In the 24th century BC, the [[Akkadian Empire]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/nt/Gilgamesh/akkadian.html|title=Akkadian Empire|work=angelfire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wells, H.G. (1921). [https://books.google.com/books?id=rTAMAAAAIAAJ&amp;client=firefox-a The outline of history, being a plain history of life and mankind] New York: Macmillan company. p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in [[Mesopotamia]]. From Sumer, civilization and Bronze smelting spread westward to Egypt, Minoa and the Hittites.

The [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]] of the 22nd century BC was followed by the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] between the 21st to 17th centuries BC. The [[Sumerian Renaissance]] also developed c. the 21st century BC in [[Ur]]. Around the 18th century BC, the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt]] began. Egypt was a superpower at the time. By 1600 BC, [[Mycenaean Greece]] developed and invaded the remains of [[Minoan civilization|Minoan Civilization]]. The beginning of [[Hittites|Hittite]] dominance of the Eastern [[Mediterranean]] region is also seen in the 1600s BC. The time from the 16th to the 11th centuries BC around the Nile is called the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]]. Between 1550 BC and 1292 BC, the [[Amarna Period]] developed in Egypt.

East of Persia, was the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus River Valley civilization]] which organized cities neatly on grid patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World History Cultures, States and Society to 1500|last=Berger|first=Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|last4=Parkinson|first4=Brian|last5=Reeves|first5=Andrew|last6=Williams|first6=Nadejda|publisher=University of North Georgia, Press|year=|isbn=978-1-940771-10-6|location=Dahlonega, Georgia|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However the Indus River Valley civilization diminished after 1900 BC and was later replaced with [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Ayran peoples]] who established [[Vedic period|Vedic Culture]].

The beginning of the [[Shang dynasty]] emerged in China in this period, and there was evidence of a fully developed [[Chinese writing system]]. The Shang Dynasty is the first Chinese regime recognized by western scholars though Chinese historians insist that the [[Xia dynasty|Xia Dynasty]] preceded it. The Shang Dynasty practiced forced labor to complete public projects. There is evidence of massive ritual burial.

====Early Iron Age====
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2018}}
The [[Iron Age]] is the last principal period in the three-age system, preceded by the Bronze Age. Its date and context vary depending on the country or geographical region. The Iron Age over all was characterized by the prevalent smelting of iron with [[Ferrous metallurgy]] and the use of [[Carbon steel]]. Smelted iron proved more durable than earlier metals such as [[Copper]] or [[Bronze]] and allowed for more productive societies. The Iron Age took place at different times in different parts of the world, and comes to an end when a society began to maintain historical records.

During the 13th to 12th centuries BC, the [[Ramesside Period]] occurred in Egypt. Around 1200 BC, the [[Trojan War]] was thought to have taken place.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Barry S. (2006) The Trojan War: A New History. Simon &amp; Schuster {{ISBN|0-7432-6441-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; By around 1180 BC, the disintegration of the [[Hittite Empire]] was under way. The collapse of the Hitties was part of the larger scale Bronze Age Collapse which took place in the Ancient Near East around 1200 BC. In Greece the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenae]] and [[Minoan civilization|Minona]] both disintegrated. A wave of [[Sea Peoples]] attacked many countries, only [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] survived intact. Afterwards some entirely new successor civilizations arose in the Eastern Mediterranean.

In 1046 BC, the Zhou force, led by [[King Wu of Zhou]], overthrew the last king of the Shang dynasty. The [[Zhou dynasty]] was established in China shortly thereafter. During this Zhou era China embraced a feudal society of decentralized power. Iron Age China then dissolved into the [[Warring States period|warring states]] period where possibly millions of soldiers fought each other over feudal struggles.

[[Pirak]] is an early iron-age site in [[Balochistan]], [[Pakistan]], going back to about 1200 BC. This period is believed to be the beginning of the [[Iron Age India|Iron Age in India]] and the subcontinent. Around the same time came the [[Vedas]], the oldest sacred texts for the [[Hinduism|Hindu Religion]].
In 1000 BC, the [[Mannaeans|Mannaean]] Kingdom began in [[Western Asia]]. Around the 10th to 7th centuries BC, the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] developed in [[Mesopotamia]]. In 800 BC, the rise of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city-states began. In 776 BC, the first recorded [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] were held. In contrast to neighboring cultures the Greek City states did not become a single militaristic empire but competed with each other as separate ''[[polis]]'' .

==== Axial Age ====
The preceding [[Iron Age]] is often thought to had ended in the Middle East around 550 BC due to the rise of [[Historiography]] (the historical record). The [[Axial Age]] is used to describe history between 800 and 200 BC of Eurasia, including [[Ancient Greece]], [[History of Iran|Persia]], [[Middle kingdoms of India|India]] and [[History of China|China]]. Widespread trade and communication between distinct regions in this period, including the rise of the [[Silk Road]]. This period saw the rise of [[philosophy]] and proselytizing religions.

Philosophy, religion and science were diverse in the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] producing thinkers such as [[Confucius]], [[Laozi|Lao Tzu]] and [[Mozi]] during the sixth century BC. Similar trends emerged throughout Eurasia in India with the rise of [[Early Buddhism|Buddhism]], in the Near East with [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Judaism]] and in the west with [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek Philosophy]]. In these developments religious and philosophical figures were all searching for human meaning.&lt;ref name = "Neville"&gt;{{cite book | last = Neville | first = Robert Cummings | title=Religion in Late Modernity | url= https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN079145424X&amp;id=OWkrdZ2yh3EC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;vq=%22Axial+Age | year = 2002 | publisher = SUNY Press | isbn =0-7914-5424-X | page = 104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Axial Age and its aftermath saw large wars and the formation of large empires that stretched beyond the limits of earlier Iron Age Societies. Significant for the time was the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Achaemenid Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peter|first=Turchin|date=14 April 2012|title=Religion and Empire in the Axial Age|url=http://peterturchin.com/PDF/Bellah_RBB.pdf|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|publisher=University of Connecticut|volume=|page=3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The empire's vast territory extended from modern day [[Egypt]] to [[Xinjiang]]. The empire's legacy include the rise of commerce over land routes through Eurasia as well as the spreading of Persian culture through the middle east. The [[Royal Road]] allowed for efficient trade and taxation.  Macedonian [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in its entirety, the unity of Alexander's conquests did not survive past his lifetime. Greek culture, and technology spread through West and South Asia often synthesizing with local cultures.

'''Formation of Empires and Fragmentation'''

Separate [[Diadochi|Greek Kingdoms]] Egypt and Asia encouraged trade and communication like earlier Persian administrations.&lt;ref&gt;"Mastering World History" by Philip L. Groisser, New York, 1970, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with the expansion of the [[Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]] westward the [[Silk Road]] as a series of routes made possible the exchange of goods between the Mediterranean Basin, South Asia and East Asia.  In South Asia, the Mauryan empire briefly annexed much of the Indian Subcontinent though short lived, its reign had the legacies of spreading Buddhism and providing an inspiration to later Indian states.

Supplanting the warring Greek Kingdoms in the western world came the growing [[Roman Republic]] and the Iranian [[Parthian Empire]].  As a result of empires, urbanization and literary spread to locations which had previously been at the periphery of civilization as known by the large empires. Upon the turn of the millennium the independence of tribal peoples and  smaller kingdoms were threatened by more advanced states. Empires were not just remarkable for their territorial size but for their administration and the dissemination of culture and trade, in this way the influence of empires often extended far beyond their national boundaries. Trade routes expanded by land and sea and allowed for flow of goods between distant regions even in the absence of communication. Distant nations such as Imperial Rome and the Chinese Han Dynasty rarely communicated but a horde of Roman Coins have been discovered in modern-day Vietnam. At this time most of the world's population inhabited only a small part of the earth's surface. Outside of civilization large geographic areas such as [[Siberia]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub Saharan Africa]] and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] remained sparsely populated. The [[New World]] hosted a variety of separate civilizations but its own trade networks were smaller due to the lack of draft animals and the wheel.

Empires with their immense military strength remained fragile to civil wars, economic decline and a changing political environment internationally. In 220 AD Han China collapsed into [[Three Kingdoms|warring states]] while the European Roman Empire began to suffer from political turmoil such as the [[Crisis of the Third Century|Third Century Crisis]]. In Persia regime change took place from Parthia to the more centralized [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanian Empire]]. The land based Silk Road continued to deliver profits in trade but came under continual assault by nomads all on the northern frontiers of Eurasian nations. Safer sea routes began to gain preference in the early centuries AD

Proselytizing religions began to replace polytheism and folk religions in many areas. Christianity gained a wide following in the Roman Empire, [[Zoroastrianism]] became the state enforced religion of Iran and Buddhism spread to East Asia from South Asia. Social change, political transformation as well as ecological events all contributed to the end of Ancient Times and the beginning of the Post Classical era in Eurasia roughly around the year 500.

==Developments==

===Religion and philosophy===
{{Main|Axial age|History of philosophy|Development of religion|History of religion}}
{{Further|Axial Age|Religions of the Ancient Near East|Ancient Egyptian religion|Historical Vedic religion|Ancient Greek religion|Hellenistic philosophy|Roman imperial cult|Early Christianity|Decline of Greco-Roman polytheism}}
New [[philosophy|philosophies]] and [[religions]] arose in both east and west, particularly about the 6th century BC. Over time, a great variety of religions developed around the world, with some of the earliest major ones being [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]] in [[India]], and [[Zoroastrianism]] in [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]]. The [[Abrahamic religion]]s trace their origin to [[Judaism]], around 1800 BC.

The ancient [[Indian philosophy]] is a fusion of two ancient traditions: [[Sramana]] tradition and [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic tradition]]. Indian philosophy begins with the ''[[Vedas]]'' where questions related to laws of nature, the origin of the universe and the place of man in it are asked. Jainism and Buddhism are continuation of the Sramana school of thought. The Sramanas cultivated a pessimistic world view of the samsara as full of suffering and advocated renunciation and austerities. They laid stress on philosophical concepts like Ahimsa, Karma, Jnana, Samsara and Moksa. While there are ancient relations between the Indian [[Vedas]] and the Iranian [[Avesta]], the two main families of the [[Iranian philosophy|Indo-Iranian philosophical traditions]] were characterized by fundamental differences in their implications for the human being's position in society and their view on the role of man in the universe.

In the east, three schools of thought were to dominate [[China|Chinese]] thinking until the modern day. These were [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] and [[Confucianism]]. The Confucian tradition, which would attain dominance, looked for [[political]] [[morality]] not to the force of law but to the power and example of tradition. Confucianism would later spread into the [[Korean peninsula]] and [[Goguryeo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skkok.com/?_page=43 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081713/http://www.skkok.com/?_page=43 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-16 |title= 자랑스런 성균관 꽃피우는 유교문화 올바른 인성교육 성균관 예절교실  |publisher=Skkok.com |accessdate=2010-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and toward [[Japan]].

In the west, the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophical tradition, represented by [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]], was diffused throughout [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] in the 4th century BC by the conquests of [[Alexander III of Macedon]], more commonly known as [[Alexander the Great]]. After the [[Bronze and Iron Age religion]]s formed, the rise and spread of [[Christianity]] through the Roman world marked the end of [[Hellenistic]] philosophy and ushered in the beginnings of [[Medieval philosophy]].

[[File:Making Paper.gif|left|thumb|The process of Chinese Paper making. Chinese commoner [[Cai Lun]] invented paper.]]
In the [[history of technology]] and [[ancient science]] during the growth of the ancient civilizations, [[ancient technology|ancient technological]] advances were produced in [[engineering]]. These advances stimulated other societies to adopt new ways of living and governance.

The characteristics of [[Ancient Egyptian technology]] are indicated by a set of artifacts and customs that lasted for thousands of years. The Egyptians invented and used many basic machines,[[File:Pont Du Gard.jpg|thumb|[[Roman aqueduct|Roman Aqueduct]]  in [[Pont du Gard|Pont Du Gard, France]]]] such as the ramp and the lever, to aid construction processes. The Egyptians also played an important role in developing Mediterranean maritime technology including ships and lighthouses.

The [[history of Science and Technology in India|history of science and technology in India]] dates back to ancient times. The Indus Valley civilization yields evidence of [[hydrography]],  and sewage collection and disposal being practiced by its inhabitants. Among the fields of science and technology pursued in India were [[History of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent|metallurgy]], [[Indian astronomy|astronomy]], [[Indian mathematics|mathematics]] and [[Ayurveda]]. Some ancient [[List of Indian inventions|inventions]] include [[plastic surgery]], [[cataract surgery]], [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system]] and [[Wootz steel]].

The [[history of science and technology in China]] show significant advances in science, technology, mathematics, and astronomy. The first recorded observations of comets and [[SN 185|supernovae]] were made in China. Traditional [[Chinese medicine]], [[acupuncture]] and herbal medicine were also practiced.

[[Ancient Greek technology]] developed at an unprecedented speed during the 5th century BC, continuing up to and including the Roman period, and beyond. Inventions that are credited to the ancient Greeks such as the gear, screw, bronze casting techniques, water clock, water organ, torsion catapult and the use of steam to operate some experimental machines and toys. Many of these inventions occurred late in the Greek period, often inspired by the need to improve weapons and tactics in war. [[Roman technology]] is the engineering practice which supported Roman civilization and made the expansion of Roman commerce and Roman military possible over nearly a thousand years. The Roman Empire had the most advanced set of technology of their time, some of which may have been lost during the turbulent eras of Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. Roman technological feats of many different areas, like civil engineering, construction materials, transport technology, and some inventions such as the mechanical reaper went unmatched until the 19th century.

[[Qanat]]s which likely emerged on the [[Iran]]ian plateau and possibly also in the [[Arabian peninsula]] sometime in the early 1st millennium BC spread from there slowly west- and eastward.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Wilson (classical archaeologist)|Andrew Wilson]]: "Hydraulic Engineering and Water Supply", in: [[John Peter Oleson]]: ''Handbook of Engineering and Technology in the Classical World'', New York: Oxford University Press, 2008 (editor), {{ISBN|978-0-19-973485-6}}, pp. 291f.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maritime activity===
{{Main|Ancient maritime history}}

The history of ancient navigation began in earnest when men took to the sea in [[Plank (wood)|planked]] boats and ships propelled by [[sail]]s hung on [[Mast (sailing)|masts]], like the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Khufu ship]] from the mid-3rd millennium BC. According to the [[Greece|Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]], [[Necho II]] sent out an expedition of [[Phoenicians]], which in three years sailed from the [[Red Sea]] around [[Africa]] to the mouth of the [[Nile]]. Many current historians tend to believe Herodotus on this point, even though Herodotus himself was in disbelief that the Phoenicians had accomplished the act.

[[Hannu]] was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[exploration|explorer]] (around 2750 BC) and the first explorer of whom there is any knowledge. He made the first recorded exploring expedition, writing his account of his exploration in stone. Hannu travelled along the Red Sea to [[Punt (region)|Punt]], and sailed to what is now part of eastern [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somalia]]. He returned to Egypt with great treasures, including precious [[myrrh]], [[metals|metal]] and [[wood]].

===Warfare===
[[File:Ballista (PSF) vector.svg|left|thumb|Technical drawing of Roman [[Ballista]] mechanism. ]]
{{Main|Ancient warfare}}

[[Ancient warfare]] is war as conducted from the beginnings of recorded history to the end of the ancient period. In Europe, the end of antiquity is often equated with the fall of Rome in 476. In China, it can also be seen as ending in the 5th century, with the growing role of mounted warriors needed to counter the ever-growing threat from the north.

The difference between [[prehistoric warfare]] and ancient warfare is less one of technology than of organization. The development of the first [[city-state]]s, and then [[empire]]s, allowed warfare to change dramatically. Beginning in [[Mesopotamia]], states produced sufficient agricultural surplus that full-time ruling elites and military commanders could emerge. While the bulk of military forces were still farmers, the society could support having them campaigning rather than working the land for a portion of each year. Thus, organized armies developed for the first time.

These new armies could help states grow in size and became increasingly centralized, and the first empire, that of the [[Sumer]]ians, formed in Mesopotamia. Early ancient armies continued to primarily use [[bow and arrow|bows]] and [[spear]]s, the same weapons that had been developed in prehistoric times for hunting. Early armies in [[Egypt]] and [[China]] followed a similar pattern of using massed infantry armed with bows and spears.

{{Main|Ancient art history|Ancient music|Ancient art}}

[[Ancient music]] is music that developed in literate cultures, replacing prehistoric music. Ancient music refers to the various musical systems that were developed across various geographical regions such as Persia, India, China, Greece, Rome, Egypt and Mesopotamia (see [[music of Mesopotamia]], [[music of ancient Greece]], [[music of ancient Rome]], [[music of Iran]]). Ancient music is designated by the characterization of the basic audible tones and scales. It may have been transmitted through oral or written systems. [[Ancient art|Arts of the ancient world]] refers to the many types of art that were in the cultures of ancient societies, such as those of ancient China, Egypt, Greece, India, Persia, Mesopotamia and Rome.

The [[Ancient Near East]] is considered the [[cradle of civilization]]. It was the first to practice intensive year-round [[agriculture]]; created the first [[history of writing|coherent writing system]], invented the [[potter's wheel]] and then the vehicular- and mill [[wheel]], created the first [[centralized government]]s, [[law code]]s and [[empire]]s, as well as introducing [[social stratification]], [[slavery]] and organized [[warfare]], and it laid the foundation for the fields of [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]].

====Mesopotamia====
[[Mesopotamia]] is the site of some of the earliest known [[civilization]]s in the world. Early settlement of the alluvial plain lasted from the [[Ubaid period]] (late 6th millennium BC) through the [[Uruk period]] (4th millennium BC) and the Dynastic periods (3rd millennium BC) until the rise of [[Babylon]] in the early 2nd millennium BC. The surplus of storable foodstuffs created by this economy allowed the population to settle in one place instead of migrating after crops and herds. It also allowed for a much greater population density, and in turn required an extensive labor force and [[division of labor]]. This organization led to the necessity of record keeping and the development of [[history of writing|writing]] (c. 3500 BC).

[[Babylonia]] was an [[Amorite]] state in lower [[Mesopotamia]] (modern southern [[Iraq]]), with Babylon as its capital. Babylonia emerged when [[Hammurabi]] (fl. c. 1728–1686 BC, according to the [[short chronology]]) created an empire out of the territories of the former kingdoms of [[Sumer]] and [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]. The Amorites being [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]], Babylonia adopted the written [[Akkadian language]] for official use; they retained the [[Sumerian language]] for religious use, which by that time was no longer a spoken language. The Akkadian and Sumerian cultures played a major role in later Babylonian culture, and the region would remain an important cultural center, even under outside rule. The earliest mention of the city of [[Babylon]] can be found in a tablet from the reign of [[Sargon of Akkad]], dating back to the 23rd century BC.

The [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], or [[Chaldea]], was Babylonia under the rule of the 11th ("Chaldean") dynasty, from the revolt of [[Nabopolassar]] in 626 BC until the invasion of [[Cyrus the Great]] in 539 BC. Notably, it included the reign of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], who conquered the [[Kingdom of Judah]] and [[Jerusalem]].

Akkad was a city and its surrounding region in central Mesopotamia. Akkad also became the capital of the [[Akkadian Empire]].&lt;ref name="WebsterNinthNewCollege"&gt;Mish, Frederick C., Editor in Chief. "Akkad." ''[[Webster's Dictionary#The Collegiate Dictionary|Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary]]''. 9th ed. Springfield, MA: [[Merriam-Webster]] Inc., 1985. {{ISBN|0-87779-508-8|0-87779-509-6}} (indexed), and {{ISBN|0-87779-510-X}} (deluxe).&lt;/ref&gt; The city was probably situated on the west bank of the [[Euphrates]], between [[Sippar]] and [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] (in present-day Iraq, about {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of the center of [[Baghdad]]). Despite an extensive search, the precise site has never been found. Akkad reached the height of its power between the 24th and 22nd centuries BC, following the conquests of king Sargon of Akkad. Because of the policies of the Akkadian Empire toward linguistic assimilation, Akkad also gave its name to the predominant Semitic dialect: the Akkadian language, reflecting use of ''akkadû'' ("in the language of Akkad") in the Old Babylonian period to denote the Semitic version of a Sumerian text.

[[Assyria]] was originally (in the [[Middle Bronze Age]]) a region on the Upper [[Tigris]], named for its original capital, the ancient city of [[Assur]]. Later, as a nation and empire that came to control all of the [[Fertile Crescent]], [[Egypt]] and much of [[Anatolia]], the term "Assyria proper" referred to roughly the northern half of Mesopotamia (the southern half being Babylonia), with [[Nineveh]] as its capital. The Assyrian kings controlled a large kingdom at three different times in history. These are called the ''Old'' (20th to 15th centuries BC), ''Middle'' (15th to 10th centuries BC), and ''[[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]]'' (911–612 BC) kingdoms, or periods, of which the last is the most well known and best documented. Assyrians invented [[sapping|excavation to undermine]] [[fortification|city walls]], [[battering ram]]s to knock down gates, as well as the concept of a corps of [[engineers]], who bridged rivers with pontoons or provided soldiers with inflatable skins for swimming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bertman|first=Stephen|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|location=New York|publisher=Oxford UP|year=2005|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its culture played a crucial role in the [[Gutian Empire]], especially during the [[Achaemenid dynasty]] that succeeded it, when the [[Elamite language]] remained among those in official use. The Elamite period is considered a starting point for the [[history of Iran]].

The [[Medes]] were an [[Ancient Iranian peoples|ancient Iranian people]]. They had established their own empire by the 6th century BC, having defeated the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] with the [[Chaldea]]ns. They overthrew [[Urartu]] later on as well. The Medes are credited with the foundation of the first Iranian empire, the largest of its day until [[Cyrus the Great]] established a unified Iranian empire of the Medes and [[Persian people|Persian]], often referred to as the [[Achaemenid]] [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], by defeating his grandfather and overlord, [[Astyages]] the king of Media.

The [[Achaemenid Empire]] was the largest and most significant of the [[Persian Empire (disambiguation)|Persian Empires]], and followed the [[Median Empire]] as the second great empire of the Iranians. It is noted in western history as the foe of the [[Greek city states]] in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]], for freeing the [[Israelites]] from their [[Babylonian captivity]], for its successful model of a centralized bureaucratic administration, the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]] (one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]), and for instituting [[Aramaic]] as the empire's [[official language]]. Because of the Empire's vast extent and long endurance, Persian influence upon the language, religion, architecture, philosophy, law and government of nations around the world lasts to this day. At the height of its power, the Achaemenid dynasty encompassed approximately 8.0&amp;nbsp;million square kilometers, held the greatest percentage of world population to date, stretched three continents (Europe, Asia and Africa) and was territorially the largest empire of classical antiquity.
[[File:Scythia-Parthia 100 BC.png|thumb|Geographical extent of Iranian influence in the 1st century BC. The [[Parthia]]n Empire (mostly [[Western Iranian languages|Western Iranian]]) is shown in red, other areas, dominated by [[Scythia]] (mostly [[Eastern Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian]]), in orange.]]

[[Parthia]] was an Iranian civilization situated in the northeastern part of modern Iran. Their power was based on a combination of the guerrilla warfare of a mounted nomadic tribe, with organizational skills to build and administer a vast empire – even though it never matched in power and extent the Persian empires that preceded and followed it. The [[Parthian Empire]] was led by the Arsacid dynasty, which reunited and ruled over significant portions of the [[Near East]] and beyond, after defeating and disposing the Hellenistic [[Seleucid Empire]], beginning in the late 3rd century BC. It was the third native dynasty of ancient Iran (after the [[Medes|Median]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] dynasties). Parthia had many wars with the [[Roman Republic]] (and subsequently the [[Roman Empire]]), which marked the start of what would be over 700 years of frequent [[Roman-Persian Wars]].

The [[Sassanid Empire]], lasting the length of the [[Late Antiquity]] period, is considered to be one of Iran's most important and influential historical periods. In many ways the Sassanid period witnessed the highest achievements of [[Persian culture|Persian civilization]] and constituted the last great Iranian Empire before the [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Muslim conquest]] and the adoption of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Hourani, Albert (1991), A History of the Arab Peoples, London: Faber and Faber. {{ISBN|0-571-22664-7}}. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; During Sassanid times, Persia influenced Roman civilization considerably,&lt;ref&gt;Bury, J.B. (1923), History Of The Later Roman Empire. p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Romans reserved for the Sassanid Persians alone the status of equals.

====Armenia====
The early history of the [[Hittite empire]] is known through tablets that may first have been written in the 17th century BC but survived only as copies made in the 14th and 13th centuries BC. These tablets, known collectively as the [[Anitta]] text,&lt;ref&gt;ed. [[StBoT]] 18&lt;/ref&gt; begin by telling how [[Pithana]] the king of [[Kussara]] or Kussar (a small [[city-state]] yet to be identified by archaeologists) conquered the neighbouring city of [[Neša]] ([[Kanesh]]). However, the real subject of these tablets is [[Pithana]]'s son [[Anitta]], who conquered several neighbouring cities, including [[Hattusa]] and [[Zalpuwa]] ([[Zalpa]]).

Assyrian inscriptions of [[Shalmaneser I]] (c. 1270 BC) first mention ''[[Urartu|Uruartri]]'' as one of the states of [[Nairi (people)|Nairi]] – a loose confederation of small kingdoms and tribal states in the [[Armenian Highland]] from the 13th to 11th centuries BC. Uruartri itself was in the region around [[Lake Van]]. The Nairi states were repeatedly subjected to attacks by the Assyrians, especially under Tukulti-Ninurta I (c. 1240 BC), [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (c. 1100 BC), Ashur-bel-kala (c. 1070 BC), [[Adad-nirari II]] (c. 900), [[Tukulti-Ninurta II]] (c. 890), and [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883–859 BC).

The [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] was an independent kingdom from 321 BC to 428 AD, and a client state of the Roman and Persian empires until 428. Between 95–55 BC under the rule of King Tigranes the Great, the kingdom of Armenia became a large and powerful empire stretching from the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]s. During this short time it was considered to be the most powerful state in the Roman East.&lt;ref&gt;''Time Almanac', p. 724 by Editors of Time Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New Review''. p. 208 edited by Archibald Grove, William Ernest Henley&lt;/ref&gt;

====Israel====
[[File:Kingdoms of Israel and Judah map 830.svg|upright=0.9|thumb|The Iron Age kingdom of Israel (blue) and kingdom of Judah (yellow)]]
{{Main|History of Ancient Israel and Judah}}
[[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] were related Iron Age kingdoms of the ancient Levant and had existed during the Iron Ages and the Neo-Babylonian, Persian and Hellenistic periods.
The name Israel first appears in the [[Merneptah stele|stele]] of the Egyptian pharaoh [[Merneptah]] c. 1209&amp;nbsp;BC, "Israel is laid waste and his seed is no more."&lt;ref&gt;Stager in Coogan 1998, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; This "Israel" was a cultural and probably political entity of the central highlands, well enough established to be perceived by the Egyptians as a possible challenge to their [[hegemony]], but an ethnic group rather than an organised state;&lt;ref&gt;Dever 2003, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist Paula McNutt says: "It is probably ... during Iron Age I [that] a population began to identify itself as 'Israelite'," differentiating itself from its neighbours via prohibitions on [[cultural exogamy|intermarriage]], an emphasis on [[family history]] and [[genealogy]], and religion.&lt;ref&gt;McNutt 1999, pp. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel had emerged by the middle of the 9th century BC, when the Assyrian king [[Shalmaneser III]] names "[[Ahab]] the Israelite" among his enemies at the [[battle of Qarqar]] (853). Judah emerged somewhat later than Israel, probably during the 9th century BC, but the subject is one of considerable controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Grabbe 2008, pp. 225–226&lt;/ref&gt; Israel came into increasing conflict with the expanding [[neo-Assyrian empire]], which first split its territory into several smaller units and then destroyed its capital, Samaria (722). A series of campaigns by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] between 597 and 582 led to the destruction of Judah.

Followed by the fall of Babylon to the [[Persian empire]], Jews were allowed, by [[Cyrus the Great]], to [[Return to Zion|return to Judea]]. The [[Hasmonean Kingdom]] (followed by the [[Maccabean revolt]]) had existed during the Hellenistic period and then the [[Herodian kingdom]] during the Roman period.

====Others====
{{Main|Pre-Islamic Arabia|Ancient history of Yemen}}

The history of [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]] before the rise of [[Islam]] in the 630s is not known in great detail. Archaeological exploration in the [[Arabian peninsula]] has been sparse; indigenous written sources are limited to the many inscriptions and coins from southern Arabia. Existing material consists primarily of written sources from other traditions (such as [[Egypt]]ians, [[Greece|Greeks]], [[Persia]]ns, [[Roman Empire|Romans]], etc.) and [[oral tradition]]s later recorded by Islamic scholars. Many small kingdoms prospered from Red sea and [[Indian Ocean trade]]. Major kingdoms included the [[Sabaeans]], [[Kingdom of Awsan|Awsan]], [[Lakhmids|Lahkimid]] [[Himyarite Kingdom|Himyar]] and the [[Nabataeans|Nabateans]]. Arab kingdoms are occasionally mentioned in the Hebrew [[Old Testament]] under the name of [[Edom]].
Though the [[Ugarit]]ic site is thought to have been inhabited earlier, [[Neolithic]] Ugarit was already important enough to be fortified with a wall early on. The first written evidence mentioning the city comes from the nearby city of [[Ebla]], c. 1800 BC. [[Ugarit]] passed into the sphere of influence of Egypt, which deeply influenced its art. On the Mediterranean coast of modern-day Israel, Palestine and Lebanon, Canaanite peoples became wealth through trade inspiring Phoenicians.

[[Phoenicia]] was an ancient civilization centered in the north of ancient [[Canaan]], with its heartland along the coastal regions of modern-day [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Israel]]. Phoenician civilization was an enterprising [[thalassocracy|maritime trading culture]] that spread across the [[Mediterranean]] between the period of 1550 to 300 BC. One of Phoenician colony – [[Carthage]] became a powerful nation in its own right.

==== Carthage ====

{{Main|Carthage}}
[[Carthage]] was founded in 814 BC by [[Phoenicia]]n settlers from the city of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], bringing with them the [[tutelary deity|city-god]] [[Melqart]].&lt;ref&gt;As recounted by Timaeus, FrGrH 566, fr. 60. Archaeological attestation for so early a date is still wanting, though recent discoveries in situ may point nearly as far back in time.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Carthage]] was an informal [[hegemony]] of [[Phoenicia]]n [[city-state]]s throughout North Africa and modern [[Spain]] from 575 BC until 146 BC. It was more or less under the control of the city-state of [[Carthage]] after the fall of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] to [[Babylonia]]n forces. At the height of the city's influence, its empire included most of the western Mediterranean. The empire was in a constant state of struggle with the [[Roman Republic]], which led to a series of conflicts known as the [[Punic Wars]]. After the third and [[Third Punic War|final Punic War]], Carthage was destroyed then occupied by Roman forces. Nearly all of the territory held by Carthage fell into Roman hands.

==== Egypt ====
{{Main|Ancient Egypt|Outline of ancient Egypt}}

[[File:Egypt.Giza.Sphinx.01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Khafre's Pyramid]] ([[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|4th dynasty]]) and [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] (c. 2500 BC or perhaps earlier)|alt=|left]] [[Ancient Egypt]] was a long-lived [[civilization]] geographically located in north-eastern [[Africa]]. It was concentrated along the middle to lower reaches of the [[Nile River]] reaching its greatest extension during the 2nd millennium [[Before Christ|BC]], which is referred to as the [[New Kingdom]] period. It reached broadly from the [[Nile Delta]] in the north, as far south as [[Jebel Barkal]] at the [[Fourth Cataract]] of the Nile. Extensions to the geographical range of ancient Egyptian civilization included, at different times, areas of the southern [[Levant]], the Eastern Desert and the [[Red Sea]] coastline, the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and the [[Libyan Desert|Western Desert]] (focused on the several [[oasis|oases]]).

Ancient Egypt developed over at least three and a half [[millennia]]. It began with the incipient unification of Nile Valley polities around 3500 BC and is conventionally thought to have ended in 30 BC when the early [[Roman Empire]] conquered and absorbed [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] as a province. (Though this last did not represent the first period of foreign domination, the Roman period was to witness a marked, if gradual transformation in the political and religious life of the Nile Valley, effectively marking the termination of independent civilisational development).

The civilization of ancient Egypt was based on a finely balanced control of natural and human resources, characterised primarily by controlled [[irrigation]] of the fertile Nile Valley; the mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions; the early development of an independent [[writing|writing system]] and [[literature]]; the organisation of collective projects; [[trade]] with surrounding regions in east / central Africa and the eastern [[Mediterranean]]; finally, [[military]] ventures that exhibited strong characteristics of imperial hegemony and territorial domination of neighbouring cultures at different periods. Motivating and organizing these activities were a socio-political and economic [[elite]] that achieved social consensus by means of an elaborate system of [[religion|religious belief]] under the figure of a (semi)-divine ruler (usually male) from a succession of ruling [[dynasty|dynasties]] and which related to the larger world by means of [[polytheism|polytheistic beliefs]].

==== Nubia ====

The [[Kushite]] civilization, which is also known as Nubia, was formed before a period of Egyptian incursion into the area. The first cultures arose in what is now [[Sudan]] before the time of a unified [[Egypt]], and the most widespread culture is known as the [[Kerma culture|Kerma civilization]]. Egyptians referred to Nubia as "Ta-Seti," or "The Land of the Bow," since the Nubians were known to be expert archers. The two civilization shared an abundance of peaceful cultural interchange and cooperation, including mixed marriages and even the same gods. In the New Kingdom, Nubians became indistinguishable in the archaeological record from Egyptians. The Kingdom of Kush survived longer than that of Egypt and at its greatest extent Nubia ruled over Egypt (under the leadership of king [[Piye]]), and controlled Egypt during the 8th century BC as the [[Kushite Empire|25th Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientsudan.org/history_06_nubconegypt.htm|title=Ancient Sudan~ Nubia: History: The Kushite Conquest of Egypt|work=ancientsudan.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:NubianPharoahs.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pharaoh]]s of Nubia]]

During this period Nubia's entire landscape up to the region of the Third Cataract was dotted with temples indistinguishable in style and decoration from contemporary temples erected in Egypt. The same observation obtains for the smaller number of typically Egyptian tombs in which these elite Nubian princes were interred.&lt;ref&gt;Bianchi, 2004, ''Daily Life of the Nubians''. pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt;  It is through [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], [[Hebrew]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] records that most of our knowledge of [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]] (Cush) comes, as the Nubians own form of writing the [[Meroitic alphabet]] has yet to be translated.

It is also referred to as [[Aethiopia|Ethiopia]] in ancient Greek and Roman records. According to Josephus and other classical writers, the Kushite Empire covered all of Africa, and some parts of Asia and Europe at one time or another. In contrast to the Egyptians the Nubians had an unusually high number of ruling queens also known as [[Kandake]], especially during the golden age of the Meroitic Kingdom. Although ruling queens, in themselves, may not be unusual, the portrayal of Nubian queen smiting her enemies has no equivalent in either Egyptian, Aksum, or art of Classical Antiquity. Throughout the history and culture of Nubia, it becomes apparent that women played an important role. Unlike the rest of the world at the time, women in Nubia exercised significant control in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Kneller  |first=Tara L. |url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Role_Women.html |title=Role of Women in Nubia [Kneller] |website=africa.upenn.edu|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kushites are also famous for having buried their monarchs along with all their courtiers in mass graves. The Kushites also built burial mounds and pyramids, and shared some of the same gods worshipped in Egypt, especially [[Amun|Amon]] and [[Isis]].[[File:Relief of Hatshepsut's expedition to the Land of Punt by Σταύρος.jpg|thumb|Egyptian soldiers from Hatshepsut's expedition to the Land of Punt as depicted from her temple at [[Deir el-Bahri]].|alt=|left]]

==== Axum /Ancient Ethiopia ====

The Axumite Empire was an important trading nation in northeastern [[Africa]] centered in present-day [[Eritrea]] and northern [[Ethiopia]], it existed from approximately 100–940 AD, growing from the Iron Age proto-Aksumite period c. fourth century BC to achieve prominence by the first century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=xeJMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48|title=The Oxford Companion to Archaeology|author=Phillipson, David|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|editor=Neil Asher Silberman|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the Book of Aksum, Aksum's first capital, Mazaber, was built by Itiyopis, son of Cush.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWBPAQAAIAAJ|title=Africa Geoscience Review|year=2003|publisher=Rock View International|page=366|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capital was later moved to Axum in northern Ethiopia. The Kingdom used the name "Ethiopia" as early as the fourth century.&lt;ref name="Munro-Hay57"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul B. Henze 2005"&gt;Henze, Paul B.

The Empire of Aksum at its height at its climax by the early sixth century extended through much of modern Ethiopia and across the Red Sea to Arabia.  The capital city of the empire was [[Axum|Aksum]], now in northern Ethiopia.

Its ancient capital is found in northern Ethiopia, the Kingdom used the name "Ethiopia" as early as the 4th century.&lt;ref name="Munro-Hay57"&gt;Stuart Munro-Hay, Aksum: An African Civilization of Late Antiquity.

He is also said to have been familiar with Greek literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/periplus.html ''Periplus of the Erythreaean Sea''], chs. 4, 5&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an alleged resting place of the [[Ark of the Covenant]] and home of the [[Queen of Sheba]]. Aksum was also one of the first major empires to convert to [[Christianity]].

The [[Nok culture]] appeared in Nigeria around 1000 BC and mysteriously vanished around 200 AD. The civilization's social system is thought to have been highly advanced. The Nok civilization was considered to be the earliest sub-Saharan producer of life-sized Terracotta which have been discovered by archaeologists.&lt;ref name="archaeology"&gt;''Shaw, Thurstan, Nigeria: Its Archaeology and early history.

The earliest evidence of human civilization in South Asia is from the [[Mehrgarh]] region (7000 BC to 3200 BC) what is now [[Pakistan]]. Located near the Bolan Pass, to the west of the Indus River valley and between the present-day Pakistani cities of [[Quetta]], [[Kalat, Pakistan|Kalat]] and [[Sibi]], Mehrgarh was discovered in 1974 by an archaeological team directed by French archaeologist Jean-François Jarrige, and was excavated continuously between 1974 and 1986. The earliest settlement at Mehrgarh&amp;nbsp;– in the northeast corner of the {{convert|495|acre|km2}} site&amp;nbsp;– was a small farming village dated between 7000–5500 BC.
Early Mehrgarh residents lived in mud brick houses, stored their grain in granaries, fashioned tools with local copper ore, and lined their large basket containers with bitumen. They cultivated six-row barley, einkorn and emmer wheat, jujubes and dates, and herded sheep, goats and cattle. Residents of the later period (5500 BC to 2600 BC) put much effort into crafts, including flint knapping, tanning, bead production, and metal working. The site was occupied continuously until about 2600 BC.[2] [[File:Shiva Pashupati.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A possible representation of a "[[yogi]]" or "proto-[[Shiva]]", 2600–1900 BCE]]The [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (c. 3300–1700 BC, flourished 2600–1900 BC), abbreviated IVC, was an ancient [[civilization]] that flourished in the [[Indus River|Indus]] and [[Ghaggar-Hakra River|Ghaggar-Hakra]] [[river]] valleys primarily in what is now [[Pakistan]], although settlements linked to this ancient civilization have been found in eastern [[Afghanistan]], and western [[India]]. Minor scattered sites have been found as far away as [[Turkmenistan]]. Another name for this civilization is the Harappan Civilization, after the first of its cities to be excavated, [[Harappa]] in the Pakistani province of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]. The IVC might have been known to the [[Sumer]]ians as the [[Meluhha]], and other trade contacts may have included Egypt, Africa, however, the modern world discovered it only in the 1920s as a result of archaeological excavations and rail road building. Prominent historians of Ancient India would include [[Ram Sharan Sharma]] and [[Romila Thapar]].

The births of [[Mahavira]] and [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] in the 6th century BC mark the beginning of well-recorded history in the region. Around the 5th century BC, the ancient region of [[Pakistan]] was invaded by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] under [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] in 522 BC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/pak_history/persian.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/pak_history/persian.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+14:11:44 |archivedate=2009-10-25 |title=Part of Persian Empire |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; forming the easternmost satraps of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]. The provinces of Sindh and Panjab were said to be the richest ''satraps'' of the Persian Empire and contributed many soldiers to various Persian expeditions. It is known that an ''Indian'' contingent fought in Xerxes' army on his expedition to Greece. Herodotus mentions that the Indus satrapy supplied cavalry and chariots to the Persian army. He also mentions that the Indus people were clad in armaments made of cotton, carried bows and arrows of cane covered with iron. Herodotus states that in 517 BC Darius sent an expedition under Scylax to explore the Indus. Under Persian rule, much irrigation and commerce flourished within the vast territory of the empire. The Persian empire was followed by the invasion of the Greeks under [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s army. Since Alexander was determined to reach the eastern-most limits of the Persian Empire he could not resist the temptation to conquer India (i.e. the Punjab region), which at this time was parcelled out into small chieftain-ships, who were feudatories of the Persian Empire. Alexander amalgamated the region into the expanding Hellenic empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/pak_history/alexander.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/pak_history/alexander.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+14:11:37 |archivedate=2009-10-25 |title=Alexander's Invasion |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Rigveda]]'', in [[Sanskrit]], goes back to about 1500 BC. The Indian literary tradition has an oral history reaching down into the [[Vedic period]] of the later 2nd millennium BC.

''[[History of India|Ancient India]]'' is usually taken to refer to the "golden age" of classical [[Indian culture]], as reflected in [[Sanskrit]] literature, beginning around 500 BC with the sixteen monarchies and 'republics' known as the [[Mahajanapadas]], stretched across the [[Indo-Gangetic plains]] from modern-day Afghanistan to [[Bangladesh]]. The largest of these nations were [[Magadha]], [[Kosala]], [[Kuru (India)|Kuru]] and [[Gandhara]]. Notably, the great epics of [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] are rooted in this classical period.[[File:TNMStandingBuddha.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Standing [[Greco-Buddhism|Greek-Buddha]], [[Gandhara]], 1st century AD.|alt=|left]]Amongst the sixteen Mahajanapadas, the kingdom of [[Magadha]] rose to prominence under a number of dynasties that peaked in power under the reign of [[Ashoka]] [[Maurya]] one of India's most legendary and famous emperors. During the reign of [[Ashoka]], the four dynasties of [[Chola dynasty|Chola]], [[Chera dynasty|Chera]], and [[Pandya]] were ruling in the South, while the King [[Devanampiya Tissa]] was controlling the Anuradhapura Kingdom (now [[Sri Lanka]]). These kingdoms, while not part of Ashoka's empire, were in friendly terms with the [[Maurya Empire]]. There was a strong alliance existed between [[Devanampiya Tissa]] (250–210 BC) and [[Ashoka]] of India,&lt;ref&gt;Mendis (1999), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; who sent [[Arahat]] [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Mahinda]], four monks, and a novice being sent to Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;Wijesooriya (2006), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

They encountered Devanampiya Tissa at [[Mihintale]]. After this meeting, Devanampiya Tissa embraced Buddhism the order of monks was established in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Wijesooriya (2006), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Devanampiya Tissa, guided by Arahat Mahinda, took steps to firmly establish Buddhism in the country.

The period between AD 320–550 is known as the Classical Age, when most of [[North India]] was reunited under the [[Gupta Empire]] (c. AD 320–550). This was a period of relative peace, law and order, and extensive achievements in religion, education, mathematics, arts, Sanskrit literature and drama. Grammar, composition, logic, metaphysics, mathematics, medicine, and [[astronomy]] became increasingly specialized and reached an advanced level. The Gupta Empire was weakened and ultimately ruined by the raids of [[Huna people|Hunas]] (a branch of the [[Hephthalite]]s emanating from Central Asia). Under [[Harsha]] (r. 606–47), North India was reunited briefly.

The educated speech at that time was [[Sanskrit]], while the dialects of the general population of northern India were referred to as [[Prakrit]]s. The South Indian [[Malabar Coast]] and the [[Tamil people]] of the [[Sangam period|Sangam]] age traded with the [[Graeco-Roman]] world. They were in contact with the [[Phoenicians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Greeks]], [[Arabs]], [[Demographics of Syria|Syrians]], [[Jew]]s, and the [[China|Chinese]].&lt;ref name="Blandstrom"&gt;(Bjorn Landstrom, 1964; Miller, J.

The regions of South Asia, primarily present-day Pakistan and India, were estimated to have had the largest [[Economic history of India|economy]] of the world between the 1st and 15th centuries AD, controlling between one third and one quarter of the world's wealth up to the time of the [[Mughal empire|Mughals]], from whence it rapidly declined during British rule.&lt;ref&gt;[[Angus Maddison]] (2001).

====China====

[[File:Shang dynasty inscribed scapula.jpg|thumb|right|upright|An oracle bone]]
Chinese Civilization that emerged within the [[Yellow River|Yellow River Valley]] is one of five original civilizations in the world. Prior to the formation of civilization neolithic cultures such as the [[Longshan culture|Longshan]] and [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] dating to 5,000 BC lived in wall cities and likely had social organizations of complex chiefdoms. The practice of rice cultivation was vital to settled life in China.

Chinese history records such as the ''Records of the Grand Historian'' claim of the existence of the [[Xia dynasty|Xia Dynasty]]. However, as the Xia left behind no written record themselves, the time and location of their civilization has been in doubt. Some historians believe that the neolithic Erlitou culture (1900-1600 BC) is the [[Xia dynasty|Xia Dynasty]] but whether archaeological discoveries in the area Xia Dynasty or a different culture remains in doubt.

The early part of the [[Shang dynasty]] described in traditional histories (c. 1600–1300) is commonly identified with archaeological finds at [[Erligang culture|Erligang]], [[Zhengzhou]] and [[Yanshi]], south of the [[Yellow River]] in modern-day [[Henan]] province.
The last capital of the Shang (c. 1300–1046 BC) at [[Anyang]] (also in Henan) has been directly confirmed by the discovery there of the earliest Chinese texts, inscriptions of divination records on the bones or shells of animals&amp;nbsp;– the so-called "[[oracle bones]]".

Towards the end of the 2nd millennium BC, the Shang were overrun by the [[Zhou dynasty]] from the [[Wei River]] valley to the west. The death of [[King Wu of Zhou]] soon after the conquest triggered a succession crisis and civil war that was suppressed by Wu's brother, the [[Duke of Zhou]], acting as regent. The Zhou rulers at this time invoked the concept of the [[Mandate of Heaven]] to legitimize their rule, a concept that would be influential for almost every successive dynasty. The Zhou initially established their capital in the west near modern [[Xi'an]], near the Yellow River, but they would preside over a series of expansions into the [[Yangtze River]] valley. This would be the first of many population migrations from north to south in Chinese history.

In the 8th century BC, power became decentralized during the [[Spring and Autumn period]], named after the influential ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]''. In this period, local military leaders used by the Zhou began to assert their power and vie for hegemony. The situation was aggravated by the invasion of other peoples from the northwest, such as the [[Quanrong]], forcing the Zhou to move their capital east to [[Luoyang]]. This marks the second large phase of the Zhou dynasty: the Eastern Zhou. In each of the hundreds of states that eventually arose, local strongmen held most of the political power and continued their subservience to the Zhou kings in name only. Local leaders for instance started using royal titles for themselves. The [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] of Chinese philosophy blossomed during this period, and such influential intellectual movements as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] and [[Mohism]] were founded, partly in response to the changing political world. The Spring and Autumn period is marked by a falling apart of the central Zhou power. China now consisted of hundreds of states, some only as large as a village with a fort.

After further political consolidation, seven prominent states remained by the end of the 5th century BC, and the years in which these few states battled each other is known as the [[Warring States period]]. Though there remained a nominal [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] king until 256 BC, he was largely a figurehead and held little power. As neighboring territories of these warring states, including areas of modern [[Sichuan]] and [[Liaoning]], were annexed, they were governed under the new local administrative system of [[Commandery (China)|commandery]] and [[prefecture]]. This system had been in use since the Spring and Autumn period and parts can still be seen in the modern system of [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|Sheng and Xian]] (province and county). The final expansion in this period began during the reign of Ying Zheng, the king of Qin. His unification of the other six powers, and further annexations in the modern regions of [[Zhejiang]], [[Fujian]], [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] in 214 BC enabled him to proclaim himself the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor]] (Qin Shi Huangdi).

Qin Shi Huangdi ruled the unified China directly with absolute power. In contrast to the decentralized and feudal rule of earlier dynasties the Qin set up a number of 'commandries' around the country which answered directly to the emperor. Nationwide the philosophy of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]] was enforced and publications promoting rival ideas such as Confucianism were prohibited. In his reign unified China created the first continuous [[Great Wall]] with the use of forced labor. [[Qin's campaign against the Yue tribes|Invasions]] were launched southward to annex Vietnam.  After the emperor's death rebels rose against the Qin's brutal reign in new civil wars. Ultimately the Han Dynasty arose and ruled China for over four centuries in what accounted for a long period in prosperity, with a brief interruption by the [[Xin dynasty|Xin Dynasty]].  The Han Dynasty played a great role in developing the Silk Road which would transfer wealth and ideas for millennia, and also invented paper. Though the Han enjoyed great military and economic success it was strained by the rise of aristocrats who disobeyed the central government. Public frustration provoked the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] – though a failure it nonetheless accelerated the empire's downfall. After 208 AD the Han Dynasty broke up into [[Three Kingdoms period|rival kingdoms]]. China would remain divided until 581 under the Sui Dynasty, during the era of division Buddhism would be introduced to China for the first time.

====Neighbors of China====

Mongolia in Ancient times was from nomadic, the cultures and languages are modern Mongolian territory were fluid and changed frequently. The use of horses to herd and move started during the Iron Age.  North-western Mongolia was Turkic while south-western Mongolia had come under Indo-European (Tocharian and Scythian) influence. In antiquity, the eastern portions of both [[Inner Mongolia|Inner]] and [[Outer Mongolia|Outer]] Mongolia were inhabited by Mongolic peoples descended from the [[Donghu people]], including the [[Xianbei state|Xianbei]], [[Wuhuan]], [[Rouran]], [[Tuoba]], [[Murong]], [[Shiwei]], [[Kumo Xi]] and [[Khitan people|Khitan]]. These were [[Tengriism|Tengriist]] horse-riding pastoralist kingdoms that had close contact with the agrarian Chinese.

As a nomadic confederation composed of various clans the Donghu were prosperous in the 4th century BC, forcing surrounding tribes to pay tribute and constantly harassing the Chinese [[Zhao (state)|State of Zhao]] (325 BC, during the early years of the reign of [[King Wuling of Zhao|Wuling]]). To appease the nomads local Chinese rulers often gave important hostages and arranged marriages.  In 208 BC Xiongnu emperor [[Modu Chanyu]], in his first major military campaign, defeated the [[Donghu people|Donghu]], who split into the new tribes [[Xianbei]] and [[Wuhuan]]. The Xiongnu were the largest nomadic enemies of the Han Dynasty fighting wars for over three centuries with the Han Dynasty before dissolving. Afterwards the Xianbei returned to rule the Steppe north of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]]. The titles of Khangan and Khan come from the [[Xianbei]].

Korea's early history was often determined by its relationship with early Chinese states. According to [[Records of the Grand Historian]] by Chinese  historian [[Sima Qian|Sima Quan]], Korea was founded by [[Wei Man|Wiman]] from China in 197 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Records of the Grand Historian]] Vol.55 Korea 史記 朝鮮列伝第五十五 "朝鮮王満者、故燕人也"&lt;/ref&gt; In 105 BC, [[Han dynasty|Han dynasty China]] ruined Korea and ruled for about 400 years. The [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] ([[Baekje]], [[Goguryeo]], and [[Silla]]) conquered other successor states of Gojoseon and came to dominate the peninsula and much of Manchuria. The three kingdoms competed with each other both economically and militarily; Goguryeo and Baekje were the more powerful states for much of the three kingdoms era. At times more powerful than the neighboring Sui dynasty, Goguryeo was a regional power that defeated massive [[Goguryeo-Sui Wars|Chinese invasions]] multiple times.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/history.htm#The%20Ko%20Choson|title=Korea's History (Ko-Choson, Three Kingdoms, Parhae Kingdom, Unified Shilla, Koryo Dynasty, Colonial Period, Independence Struggle, Provisional Government of Korea, Independence Army, Republic of Korea,)|publisher=Asianinfo.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128065300/http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/history.htm|archivedate=28 January 2010|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2010-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, Silla gradually extended across Korea and eventually became the first state since [[Gojoseon]] to cover most of Korean peninsula in 676. In 698, former Goguryeo general [[Dae Jo-yeong]] founded [[Balhae]] as the successor to Goguryeo.

In Vietnam Archaeologists have pointed to the [[Phùng Nguyên culture]] as the beginning of the Vietnamese identity from around 2000 B.C which engaged in early Bronze Smelting.
Eight hundred years later the [[Dong Son culture|Đông Sơn]] culture arose a prehistoric [[Bronze Age]] culture that was centered at the [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]] Valley of northern [[Vietnam]].  Large scale rice cultivation began around 1200 BC, onward. Pottery and Bamboo working became common in this time period as well as widespread trade and navigation on inland rivers. During this time Vietnam was allegedly ruled by the semi-mythical [[Hong Bang Dynasty]], the last Hong King was deposed by a Chinese Qin Invasion, in turn however a Chinese General declared independence and founded the [[Nanyue]] combining Chinese and Vietnamese traditions.

[[Nanyue|Nan Yue]], after a century of political maneuvers the country was annexed by the [[Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]] in 111 B.C Originally the Han were lenient governors and attempted to integrate the Vietnamese upper class into Chinese Patriarchy. However Chinese abuse of certain vassals led to the famous but futile revolt of the [[Trưng Sisters|Trung Sisters]]. Afterwards Chinese authorities ruled Vietnam directly and attempted to push Chinese culture upon the populace though peasants continued to speak [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]].

While Northern Vietnam came under Chinese Domination, the [[Champa|Champa Kingdom]] became closer to Indian kingdoms through trade and embraced Hinduism.

Japan first appeared in written records in AD 57 with the following mention in China's ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'':&lt;ref&gt;後漢書, 會稽海外有東鯷人 分爲二十餘國&lt;/ref&gt; "Across the ocean from [[Luoyang]] are the people of [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]]. Formed from more than one hundred tribes, they come and pay tribute frequently. The''[[Book of Wei]]'', written in the 3rd century, noted the country was the unification of some 30 small tribes or states and ruled by a [[shaman]] queen named [[Himiko]] of [[Yamataikoku]].

During the [[Han dynasty]] and [[Cao Wei|Wei dynasty]], Chinese travelers to [[Kyūshū]] recorded its inhabitants and claimed that they were the descendants of the Grand Count (Tàibó) of the [[Wu (state)|Wu]]. The inhabitants also show traits of the pre-sinicized Wu people with tattooing, teeth-pulling and baby-carrying. The ''Book of Wei'' records the physical descriptions which are similar to ones on ''[[Haniwa]]'' statues, such men with braided hair, tattooing and women wearing large, single-piece clothing.

In [[pre-Columbian]] times, several large, centralized ancient civilizations developed in the [[Western Hemisphere]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MziRd4ddZz4C The Encyclopedia of world history] By Peter N.

The Central [[Andes]] in [[South America]] has the largest ancient civilization register, spanning 4,500 years from [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte chico]] to the latest civilization, the [[Inca Empire]].

====Mesoamerica====
{{Further| Mesoamerica}}

Mesoamerican ancient civilizations included the [[Olmec]]s and [[Maya civilization|Mayans]]. Between 2000 and 300 BC, complex cultures began to form and many matured into advanced [[Mesoamerica]]n civilizations such as the: Olmec, [[Izapa]], [[Teotihuacan]], Maya, [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], [[Mixtec]], [[Huastec civilization|Huastec]], Which flourished for nearly 4,000 years before the first contact with Europeans. These civilizations' progress included pyramid-temples, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and theology.

The Zapotec emerged around 1500 years BC. They left behind the great city [[Monte Alban]]. Their writing system had been thought to have influenced the Olmecs but, with recent evidence, the Olmec may have been the first civilization in the area to develop a true writing system independently. At the present time, there is some debate as to whether or not Olmec symbols, dated to 650 BC, are actually a form of writing preceding the oldest Zapotec writing dated to about 500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20021207/fob1.asp Script Delivery: New World writing takes disputed turn] ''Science News'' December 7th, 2002; Vol.162 #23&lt;/ref&gt;

====Etruria, Greece and Rome====
The [[history of the Etruscans]] can be traced relatively accurately, based on the examination of [[burial]] sites, [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], and [[writing]]. [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] culture that is identifiably and certainly Etruscan developed in Italy in earnest by 800 BC approximately over the range of the preceding [[Iron Age]] [[Villanovan culture]]. The latter gave way in the 7th century to a culture that was influenced by Greek traders and Greek neighbors in [[Magna Graecia]], the [[Hellenic civilization]] of southern Italy.

From the descendants of the [[Villanovan]] people in [[Etruria]] in central [[Italy]], a separate Etruscan culture emerged in the beginning of the 7th century BC, evidenced by around 7,000 inscriptions in an alphabet similar to that of [[Euboean Greek]], in the non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Etruscan language]]. The burial tombs, some of which had been fabulously decorated, promotes the idea of an aristocratic [[city-state]], with centralized power structures maintaining order and constructing public works, such as irrigation networks, roads, and town defenses.{{Main|Ancient Greece}}
[[Ancient Greece]] is the period in [[Greek history]] lasting for close to a millennium, until the rise of [[Christianity]]. It is considered by most historians to be the foundational culture of [[Western world|Western Civilization]]. Greek culture was a powerful influence in the [[Roman Empire]], which carried a version of it to many parts of [[Europe]].

The earliest known human settlements in Greece were on the island of [[Crete]], more than 9,000 years ago, though there is evidence of tool use on the island going back over 100,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/01/ancient-seafarers/|title=Hominids Went Out of Africa on Rafts|author=|date=|website=wired.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest evidence of a civilisation in ancient Greece is that of the [[Minoan civilisation|Minoans]] on Crete, dating as far back as 3600 BC. On the mainland, the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] civilisation rose to prominence around 1600 BC, superseded the Minoan civilisation on Crete, and lasted until about 1100 BC, leading to a period known as the [[Greek Dark Ages]].

The Archaic Period in Greece is generally considered to have lasted from around the eighth century BC to the invasion by Xerxes in 480 BC. This period saw the expansion of the Greek world around the Mediterranean, with the founding of Greek city-states as far afield as Sicily in the West and the Black sea in the East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Boardman|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Hammond|editor2-first=N.G.L|title=The Cambridge Ancient History Volume III, Part 3: The Expansion of the Greek World, Eighth to Sixth Centuries B.C.|page=xiii|chapter=Preface|isbn=0-521-23447-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politically, the Archaic period in Greece saw the collapse of the power of the old aristocracies,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Boardman|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Hammond|editor2-first=N.G.L|title=The Cambridge Ancient History Volume III, Part 3: The Expansion of the Greek World, Eighth to Sixth Centuries B.C.|page=xv|chapter=Preface|isbn=0-521-23447-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; with democratic reforms in Athens and the development of Sparta's unique [[Spartan Constitution|constitution]]. The end of the Archaic period also saw the rise of Athens, which would come to be a dominant power in the Classical period, after the reforms of [[Solon]] and the tyranny of [[Pisistratus]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The Classical Greek world was dominated throughout the fifth century BC by the major powers of Athens and Sparta. Through the Delian League, Athens was able to convert Pan-hellenist sentiment and fear of the Persian threat into a powerful empire, and this, along with the conflict between Sparta and Athens culminating in the [[Peloponnesian war]], was the major political development of the first part of the Classical period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Lewis|editor2-last=Boardman|editor3-last=Davies|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Ostwald|editor1-first=D.M.|editor2-first=John|editor3-first=J.K.|editor4-first=M.|title=The Cambridge Ancient History Volume V: The Fifth Century B.C.|chapter=preface|pages=xiii–xiv|isbn=978-0-521-23347-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period in Greek history from the death of [[Alexander the Great]] until the rise of the Roman empire and its conquest of Egypt in 30 BC is known as the [[Hellenistic period]]. The name derives from the Greek word ''Hellenistes'' ("the Greek speaking ones"), and describes the spread of Greek culture into the non-Greek world following the conquests of Alexander and the rise of his successors.

Following the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|Battle of Corinth]] in 146 BC, Greece came under [[ancient Rome|Roman]] rule, ruled from the province of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]]. In 27 BC, Augustus organised the Greek peninsula into the province of [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]]. Greece remained under Roman control until the [[Tetrarchy|break up]] of the Roman empire, in which it remained part of the Eastern Empire. Much of Greece remained under Byzantine control until the end of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine empire]] in 1453 AD.{{Main|Ancient Rome}}[[File:RomanEmpire 117 recoloured 2.svg|center|thumb|Roman Empire 117 AD. The Senatorial Provinces marked on the map were considered to be the 'developed' areas of the empire by Ancient Romans. |500x500px]] [[Ancient Rome]] was a civilization that grew out of the city-state of Rome, originating as a small agricultural community founded on the Italian Peninsula in the 9th century BC. In its twelve centuries of existence, Roman civilization shifted from a monarchy to an oligarchic republic to an increasingly autocratic empire.

Roman civilization is often grouped into "classical antiquity" with [[ancient Greece]], a civilization that inspired much of the [[culture of ancient Rome]]. Ancient Rome contributed greatly to the development of [[Roman law|law]], [[Roman military|war]], [[Roman art|art]], [[Roman literature|literature]], [[Roman architecture|architecture]], and [[Romance languages|language]] in the [[Western world]], and its [[history of Rome|history]] continues to have a major influence on the world today. The Roman civilization came to dominate Europe and the Mediterranean region through conquest and assimilation.

Throughout the territory under the control of ancient Rome, residential [[architecture]] ranged from very modest houses to [[Roman villa|country villas]]. A number of Roman founded cities had [[monument]]al structures. Many contained fountains with fresh drinking-water supplied by hundreds of miles of [[Aqueduct (Roman)|aqueducts]], [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatres]], [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasiums]], [[thermae|bath complexes]] sometime with libraries and shops, marketplaces, and occasionally functional sewers. A number of factors led to the eventual [[decline of the Roman Empire]]. The western half of the empire, including [[Hispania]], [[Gaul]], and Italy, eventually broke into independent kingdoms in the 5th century; the Eastern Roman Empire, governed from [[Constantinople]], is referred to as the [[Byzantine Empire]] after AD 476, the traditional date for the "fall of Rome" and subsequent onset of the [[post-classical age|Middle Ages]].

====Late Antiquity====
[[File:Invasions of the Roman Empire 1.png|center|thumb|400x400px|The [[Migration Period|Age of Migrations]] in Europe was deeply detrimental to the late [[Roman Empire]]. ]]
{{Main|Late Antiquity}}

The [[Roman Empire]] underwent considerable social, cultural and organizational change starting with reign of [[Diocletian]], who began the custom of splitting the Empire into [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] and [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] halves ruled by multiple emperors. Beginning with [[Constantine the Great]] the Empire was [[Christianization|Christianized]], and a new capital founded at [[Constantinople]]. [[Germanic migrations|Migrations]] of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes disrupted Roman rule from the late 4th century onwards, culminating in the eventual [[Decline of the Roman Empire|collapse of the Empire in the West]] in 476, replaced by the so-called [[Germanic monarchy|barbarian kingdoms]]. The resultant cultural fusion of [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] and Christian traditions formed the cultural foundations of [[Europe]].

====Nomads and Iron Age Peoples====
The Huns left practically no written records. There is no record of what happened between the time they left [[Mongolian Plateau]] and arrived in Europe 150 years later. The last mention of the northern Xiongnu was their defeat by the Chinese in 151 at the [[lake of Barkol]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Barkol Kazakh Autonomous County|Barkol]]&lt;/ref&gt; after which they fled to the western steppe at [[Kangju]] (centered on the city of [[Hazrat-e Turkestan|Turkistan]] in [[Kazakhstan]]). Chinese records between the 3rd and 4th centuries suggest that a small tribe called [[Yueban]], remnants of Northern Xiongnu, was distributed about the steppe of Kazakhstan.

The [[Huns|Hun-Xiongnu]] connection is controversial at best and is often disputed but is also not completely discredited.{{sfn|Wright|2011|p=60}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/806039879|title=The fall of the Roman Empire : a new history of Rome and the Barbarians|last=J.)|first=Heather, P.J.

They later dissolved and became part of the native population.{{Germanic tribes (750 BC – 1 AD)}}

The [[Celts]] were a diverse group of [[tribal societies]] in [[Iron Age Europe]]. [[Proto-Celtic]] culture formed in the [[Early Iron Age]] in [[Central Europe]] ([[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] period, named for the site in present-day Austria). By the later Iron Age ([[La Tène culture|La Tène]] period), Celts had expanded over wide range of lands: as far west as [[Ireland]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], as far east as [[Galatia]] (central [[Anatolia]]), and as far north as [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-209125/Turkey Britannica] (Turkey) People and Culture{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early centuries AD, following the expansion of the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Migration Period|Great Migrations]] of [[Germanic peoples]], Celtic culture had become
restricted to the [[British Isles]] ([[Insular Celtic]]), with the [[Continental Celtic]] languages extinct by the mid-1st millennium AD.

Migration of [[Germanic peoples]] to Britain from what is now northern Germany and southern [[Scandinavia]] is attested from the 5th century (e.g. [[Undley bracteate]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/07/060721-england.html |title=Ancient Britain Had Apartheid-Like Society, Study Suggests |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |accessdate=2010-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Bede's ''Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum'', the intruding population is traditionally divided into Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, but their composition was likely less clear-cut and may also have included [[Frisii|ancient Frisians]] and [[Franks]]. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' contains text that may be the first recorded indications of the movement of these [[Germanic Tribes]] to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpus.cam.ac.uk/about-corpus/newstest/770-parker-library-on-the-web Parker Library on the Web] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827110457/http://www.corpus.cam.ac.uk/about-corpus/newstest/770-parker-library-on-the-web |date=2010-08-27 }}, The Parker Library.

{{Main|Late Antiquity|Post-classical history}}

The term [[Late antiquity|Late Antiquity]] is the transitional centuries from Classical Antiquity to the Middle Ages in both mainland Europe and the Mediterranean world: generally from the end of the Roman Empire's Crisis of the 3rd century (c. 284) to the Islamic conquests and the re-organization of the [[Byzantine Empire]] under [[Heraclius]] that occurred in the seventh century. The beginning of the post-classical age (known as the [[Middle Ages]] for Europe)  following the fall of the Western Roman Empire spanning roughly from AD 500 to 1500. Aspects of continuity with the earlier classical period are discussed in greater detail under the heading "Late Antiquity".

There has been attempt by scholars to connect European Late Antiquity to other areas in Eurasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Humphries|first=Mark|date=2017-02-01|title=Late Antiquity and World History: Challenging Conventional Narratives and Analyses|url=http://sla.ucpress.edu/content/1/1/8|journal=Studies in Late Antiquity|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=8–37|doi=10.1525/sla.2017.1.1.8|issn=2470-6469}}&lt;/ref&gt; To an extent most centralized kingdoms within proximity to Steppe grasslands faced major challenges or in some cases complete destruction in the 5th–6th century in the case of nomadic invasions and political fragmentation. The [[Western Roman Empire]] in Europe and the [[Gupta Empire]] in India and  North China were overwhelmed by tribal invasions. Nomadic invasions along with worldwide natural climate change, the [[Plague of Justinian]] and the rise of proselytizing religions changed the face of the Old World. Still disconnected was the New World who also built complex societies but at a separate and different pace. By 500 the world era of [[Post-classical history]] had begun.

The '''Artios Award for Outstanding Achievement in Comedy Pilot Casting''' is an award handed out annually by the [[Casting Society of America]]. It was introduced at the Art Directors Guilds' twelfth annual honors, in 1996 (honoring work from the previous year, as well as early months of the ceremony's year), after first being grouped together with casting for dramatic pilot episodes for the category '''Outstanding Achievement in Pilot Casting''', which was introduced at the seventh annual awards in 1991. It is an award that is given to casting directors for their work on television [[Television pilot|pilot]] episodes, or a series first episode.

==Development and overview==
''Auteuring Nollywood'' is a 455-page book and it contains a "collection of scholarly essays," interrogating "the thematic focus and cinematic style employed in ''The Figurine''"; it also  provides series of interviews with the key actors and technicians that featured in the film, and explores the trends in the New Nigerian Cinema.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The idea of a book adaptation of ''The Figurine'' was originally the idea of Shina Afolayan, who is a Scholar in the department of Philosophy, [[University of Ibadan]]. He gave birth to the idea when the film was still in production; after seeing a rough cut of the film, he was very impressed with what he saw that he had to interview Kunle Afolayan, along with the other cast and crew of the film at the time. The idea was not taken seriously, until film scholars in other countries also got keen on writing on the film.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The book's content was contributed by a number of scholars from various educational institutions, including: Sola Osofisan, Dele Layiwola, Chukwuma Okoye, Jane Thorburn, Matthew H. Brown, Gideon Tanimonure, A.G.A Bello, Foluke Ogunleye and Hyginus Ekwuazi. Foreword was written by Professor Jonathan Haynes of the [[Long Island University]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; an Afterword on "Neo-Nollywood and its Other" by Onookome Okome and the book as a whole was edited by Adeshina Afolayan.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The book is packaged and published by Relentless Media, in conjunction with Golden Effects Services.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

==Release==
''Auteuring Nollywood'' was launched on 31 July 2014 at the Agip Recital Hall of the Muson Centre, Lagos.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; The event was attended by several political and film stakeholders, including Peace Anyim-Osigwe, the former [[Chief Executive Officer|C.E.O]] of [[Africa Movie Academy Awards|Africa Film Academy]], [[Governor of Kwara State]]: Governor [[Abdulfatah Ahmed]] (represented by Prince Deji Oni), Speaker of the [[Lagos State House of Assembly]]: Honourable Adeyemi Ikuforiji, Corporate Affairs Adviser of [[Nigerian Breweries]]: Kufre Ekanem, Nigerian Guild of Editors: Mr. Femi Adeshina,&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.thecable.ng/from-screen-to-paper-heres-the-figurine | title= From screen to paper, here's 'The Figurine' | publisher=TheCable | work=The Cable News | date=1 August 2014 | accessdate=16 August 2014 | author=Okoye, Chinenye}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chairman of Doyin Group of Companies: Chief Samuel Adedoyin, and the event was chaired by Rasheed Gbadamosi, former Nigerian Minister for National Planning. Other notable people at the event include: Chief Tunde Oloyede, [[Tunde Kelani]], Mahmood Ali-Balogun, Yomi Fash Lanso, Ohaneze Ndi Igbo Nollywood, Gabriel Afolayan, Shina Afolayan, media mogul [[Kennis Music|Dayo Adeneye]], designer [[Deola Sagoe]], [[Kennis Music#Current roster|Kenny Saint Brown]], talking Drummer: Ara and comedians such as [[Alibaba Akporobome|Ali Baba]], Julius Agwu, [[Teju Babyface]], Princess and [[Kofi Adu|Kofi]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Comedian Gbenga Adeyinka was the Host of the event.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Some challenges facing the film industry was also discussed at the event as well.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Reception==
The book has been met with positive reception since its release. Ikechukwu Obiaya, the director of Nollywood Study Centre, [[Pan-African University]], commends the quality of the book and stated: "This is a highly impressive book. Hope it will be the first of many more to come of Kunle Afolayan's works". He also comments that the book reveals interesting perspectives into "artistic" life of the filmmaker, Kunle Afolayan.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Nduka Otiono of [[Association of Nigerian Authors]] (ANA), and African Studies, [[Carlton University]] stated: "this book is seminal in its inauguration of a new chapter in the study of Nigeria's phenomenal contribution to global film culture," "it makes a strong case for a more in-depth artistic and critical approach to the study of Nollywood that triangulates around orality".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; [[Akin Adesokan]] of the [[Indiana University]] comments that the book is: "comprehensive and informed about its subject and in unexpected ways gives solidity to the characterization of Nollywood as 'telling our own stories'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cknnigeria.com/2014/07/kunle-afolayans-figurine-returns-in.html | title=Kunle Afolayan's Figurine Returns In Book Form…set for launch at MUSON Centre | publisher=CKN Nigeria | date=2 July 2014 | accessdate=16 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Ayorinde of Relentless Media, commended that ''Auteuring Nollywood'' arrived  "at a time that the Nigerian film industry is opening up to the Academy Awards and is also being duly acknowledged as a major contributor to the Nigerian economy". He commented that the book is "championing a new and positive development in cinematic and literary studies in Nigeria by focusing exclusively on the work of a single cineaste while also expanding the narrative around a film industry that continues to announce its arrival on the global scene in a spectacular way".&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.topcelebritiesng.com/kunle-afolayans-figurine-returns-in-book-form/ | title=Kunle Afolayan's Figurine Returns In Book Form | publisher=Top Celebrities Online | work=Top Celebrities NG | accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The director of the original film, [[Kunle Afolayan]] revealed that after reading a copy of the book, he shed tears of joy, "because this is about me and my work, and because I have never read a book so detailed in its analysis". He also commented: "Releasing one's movie to scholarly interrogation like this is one of the next levels for our film industry to climb and I'm excited that this is already happening through my film".&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Peace Anyiam-Osigwe of [[Africa Movie Academy Awards|Africa Film Academy]] comments that: "AMAA is proud to be associated with this project because it serves an important purpose,"  "It is significant to see that five years after ''The Figurine'' won [[6th Africa Movie Academy Awards|AMAA]]'s top award as [[Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Film|Best Film]], the film is still being discussed and has earned a rich collection of academic essays that are as important to the film as they are to the entire industry". Danjuma Dadu of Nigerian Film Corporation stated: "''Auteuring Nollywood'' was a welcome addition to the body of knowledge on film discourse in Nigeria and that the Film Corporation is proud to be associated with it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ogtv.com.ng/nfc-amaa-endorse-book-on-figurine/ | title=NFC, AMAA Endorse Book On Figurine | publisher=OGTV | work=Ogun State Television | date=22 July 2014 | accessdate=16 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Café Central''' is a traditional [[Viennese coffee house|Viennese café]] located at [[Herrengasse]] 14 in the [[Innere Stadt]] first district of [[Vienna]], Austria. The café occupies the ground floor of the former Bank and Stockmarket Building, today called the Palais Ferstel after its architect [[Heinrich von Ferstel]].&lt;ref name="marboe"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marboe |first=Ernst Wolfgang |title=Café Central |publisher=Verlag Müller |location=Vienna |year=1989 |isbn=9783900784065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The café was opened in 1876, and in the late 19th century it became a key meeting place of the Viennese intellectual scene. Key regulars included: [[Peter Altenberg]], [[Theodor Herzl]], [[Alfred Adler]],&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Edward (1994). The Drive for Self: [[Alfred Adler]] and the founding of Individual Psychology. Reading, MA: [[Addison Wesley]], pp. 52, 77, 85-86, 101&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egon Friedell]], [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]], [[Anton Kuh]], [[Adolf Loos]], [[Leo Perutz]], [[Alfred Polgar]], [[Adolf Hitler]], and [[Leon Trotsky]]. In January 1913 alone, [[Josip Broz Tito]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Joseph Stalin]], Hitler, and Trotsky (the latter two being regulars) were patrons of the establishment.

The café was often referred to as the "Chess school" (''Die Schachhochschule'') because of the presence of many chess players who used the first floor for their games.&lt;ref name="SkjoldagerNielsen2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Skjoldager|first1=Per|last2=Nielsen|first2=Jørn Erik|title=Aron Nimzowitsch: On the Road to Chess Mastery, 1886-1924|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fSChBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA29|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-6539-2|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the [[Vienna Circle]] of [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] held many meetings at the café&lt;ref name="Stadler2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stadler|first=Friedrich|title=The Vienna Circle: Studies in the Origins, Development, and Influence of Logical Empiricism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rAlCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA370|year=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-16561-5|page=370}}&lt;/ref&gt; before and after [[World War I]].

A well known story is that when [[Victor Adler]] objected to [[Count Leopold Berchtold|Count Berchtold]], foreign minister of Austria-Hungary, that war would provoke revolution in Russia, even if not in the [[Habsburg monarchy]], he replied: "And who will lead this revolution? Perhaps Mr. Bronstein ([[Leon Trotsky]]) sitting over there at the Cafe Central?"&lt;ref&gt;[[A. J. P. Taylor]], in The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848-1918 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

The café closed at the end of [[World War II]]. In 1975, the Palais Ferstel was renovated and the Central was newly opened, however in a different part of the building. In 1986, it was fully renovated once again.

Today it is both a tourist spot and a popular café marked by its place in literary history.

'''Carlos Ramirez Sandoval''' (4 November 1939 - 29 January 2016) was born in [[Morelia]] in the state of [[Michoacán]], [[Mexico]]. He studied at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM) as well as the [[San Carlos Academy]] (now known as the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plasticas). He later obtained his Ph.D from the [[University of Paris]].

He has been part of Mexican cultural activities since the 1960s as museographer, curator, administrator, teacher, writer and communicator among other positions. His major projects include installing some of the first exhibition galleries in the Academy of San Carlos, the overall plan and museography of the Museum of Technology of the Federal Electricity Commission (Comision Federal de Electricidad, C.F.E) in Mexico City of which he was the first director, setting up the "Coloquio de Invierno" along with Victor Flores Olea and Javier Wimer (among others) as well as bringing together the group of artists who collaborated on the 'Espacio Escultorico' at the UNAM. He has directed several museums and cultural centres including the defunct National Education Library, the Museum of Technology, and [[Leon Trotsky Museum, Mexico City|the Trotsky Museum]] which he helped revive and restore. It is only until recently that he has been widely acknowledged as an innovator within Mexican cultural circles.

Following a prolonged battle with [[Parkinson's Disease]], Dr. Ramirez Sandoval died in Mexico City on 29 January 2016.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2230">{{short description|Archaeological term for baked clay building material}}
'''Ceramic building material''', often abbreviated to '''CBM''', is an [[umbrella term]] used in [[archaeology]] to cover all building materials made from baked [[clay]]. It is particularly, but not exclusively, used in relation to [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] building materials. 

It is a useful and necessary term because, especially when initially found in [[archaeological excavation]], it may be difficult to distinguish, for example, fragments of bricks from fragments of roofing or flooring tiles. However, ceramic building materials are usually readily distinguishable from fragments of ceramic [[pottery]] by their rougher finish.

Local villagers refer to the light as Chir Batti in their [[Kutchi language|Kutchhi]]-[[Sindhi language]], with Chir meaning ghost and Batti meaning light.&lt;ref name="Ghost lights that dance on Banni grasslands when it’s very dark; August 28, 2007; The Indian Express Newspaper"/&gt;

It is described as an unexplained light occurring on dark nights as bright as a mercury lamp that changes its colour to blue, red and yellow and resembles a moving ball (reported also pear shaped form) of fire, which may move as fast as an arrow but may also stop.&lt;ref name="wondermondo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/As/India/Gujarat/ChirBatti.htm |title=Chir Batti |accessdate=2010-08-29 |date=2010-08-29 |publisher=Wondermondo}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per local folklore, these lights have been a part of life in the Banni grasslands and the adjoining Rann of Kutch for centuries, but are little known beyond the immediate area and people continue to call them "ghost lights". Witnesses claim the lights at times appear to be playing [[hide and seek]] or following them.&lt;ref name="Ghost lights that dance on Banni grasslands when it’s very dark; August 28, 2007; The Indian Express Newspaper"/&gt; Some reports claim the light can only be seen after 8 pm on dark nights, are always two to ten feet above the ground, and if followed during the night, one could be misled from the road and lose their way in thorny jungles or desert of the salt flats of the Rann.&lt;ref name="Ghost lights that dance on Banni grasslands when it’s very dark; August 28, 2007; The Indian Express Newspaper"/&gt; A team of local and US [[ornithologists]] &lt;ref name="Ghost lights that dance on Banni grasslands when it’s very dark; August 28, 2007; The Indian Express Newspaper"/&gt; and soldiers of the Indian [[Border Security Force]] (BSF) who patrol the adjoining Rann of Kutch [[international border]] area of India with [[Pakistan]] have allegedly seen the light.

In modern science, it is generally accepted that most [[Will-o'-the-wisp|ignes fatui]] are caused by the oxidation of [[phosphine]] (PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[diphosphane]] (P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). These compounds, produced by organic decay, can cause photon emissions. Since phosphine and diphosphane mixtures spontaneously ignite on contact with the oxygen in air, only small quantities of it would be needed to ignite the much more abundant methane to create ephemeral fires. Furthermore, phosphine produces phosphorus pentoxide as a by-product, which forms phosphoric acid upon contact with water vapor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2688">A '''compulsory purchase order''' ('''CPO''') is a legal function in the United Kingdom and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] that allows certain bodies which need to obtain land or property to do so without the consent of the owner. It may be enforced if a proposed development is considered one for public betterment; for example, when building [[motorway]]s where a land owner does not want to sell. Similarly, if [[town council]]s wish to develop a town centre, they may issue compulsory purchase orders. CPOs can also be used to acquire historic buildings in order to preserve them from neglect.

In Ireland, CPOs became quite common in the early 21st century due to the massive road upgrade programme under the [[National Development Plan]]. CPOs are also used for railway projects. If one objects to the issuing of a CPO, one may appeal to the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1966/en/act/pub/0021/sec0078.html Housing Act 1966 (ROI)]&lt;/ref&gt; Compensation is available to ensure that the person is restored, as far as possible, to the same position that they were in before the land and property were compulsorily purchased, so that the person is left in the same financial position after the CPO as they were in before the process.&lt;ref name="urlCompulsory Purchase"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/losing_your_home/compulsory_purchase_and_compensation.html |title=Compulsory Purchase |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, most Orders are made as subordinate legislation under powers given to Local Authorities in existing legislation (e.g. an Order for road works is made under the Highways Act 1980). Whilst the powers are strong, the Authority must demonstrate that the taking of the land is necessary and there is a "compelling case in the public interest". Owners or occupiers can challenge this, and their objection will be heard by an independent Inspector.

Compensation rights usually include the value of the property, costs of acquiring and moving to a new property, and sometimes additional payments. Costs of professional advice regarding compensation are usually reimbursed by the Authority, so that people affected by a compulsory purchase order can seek advice from a [[solicitor]] and a [[surveying|surveyor]] and expect to be reimbursed.

The '''conservation of taxidermy''' is the ongoing maintenance and preservation of zoological specimens that have been mounted or stuffed for display and study. [[Taxidermy]] specimens contain a variety of organic materials, such as fur, bone, feathers, skin, and wood, as well as inorganic materials, such as burlap, glass, and foam. Due to their composite nature, taxidermy specimens require special care and conservation treatments for the different materials.

== Types and uses ==
[[File:Common Blackbird at BNHS.jpg|thumb|Example of a study skin]]
[[File:White Memorial Conservation Center 12 - museum display about taxidermy.jpg|thumb|Display with different examples of support forms]]
Traditional [[taxidermy]] specimens are cleaned and preserved animal skins that have been mounted over a form.&lt;ref name=1natsca&gt;NatSCA. Taxidermy and Skins. Retrieved from http://www.natsca.org/taxidermy&lt;/ref&gt; Full mounts are the entire specimen, while shoulder mounts only include the head, neck, and shoulders. Study skins are another form of taxidermy in which the skins of small mammals and birds are stuffed with cotton, wool, or synthetic fibers in order to support the skin and original body shape.&lt;ref name=2vertebrates&gt;Carter, D. &amp; Walker, A. K. (1999). Chapter 1: Vertebrates. Care and Conservation of Natural History Collections. Retrieved from http://www.natsca.org/care-and-conservation&lt;/ref&gt; These are typically used by researchers rather than put on display.

Taxidermy has a robust [[History of taxidermy|history]], and specimens can be found in a number of public and private institutions, as well as personal collections. Natural history museums, zoos, science &amp; nature centers, historic houses, art museums, and children’s museums are examples of institutions that may have taxidermy specimens in their collections.&lt;ref name=3trophies&gt;Troublesome Trophies and Fragile Feathered Friends: Introduction to the Care of Historic Taxidermy webinar. Retrieved from http://www.connectingtocollections.org/troublesome-trophies-and-fragile-feathered-friends-introduction-to-the-care-of-historic-taxidermy/&lt;/ref&gt;

While it may not be necessary to conserve mounts or skins of commonly occurring animals beyond educational use,&lt;ref name=4handbook&gt;National Park Service Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections. Retrieved from https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/mushbkI.html&lt;/ref&gt; some taxidermy mounts represent extinct or critically endangered species. The Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History houses Martha, the last [[passenger pigeon]] and a some collections still have [[Great Auk]] specimens, a bird species that went extinct in 1844.&lt;ref name=1natsca /&gt;

== Causes of deterioration ==
As with other types of collections, taxidermy specimens are susceptible to agents of deterioration, including pests, lights, temperature, humidity, and custodial neglect. Improper storage, display, and handling of taxidermy specimens can lead to many of these causes of deterioration.&lt;ref name=3trophies /&gt;

=== Pest damage ===
Pests, such as [[Dermestid Beetle|dermestid beetles]], clothes moths, and rodents, can cause damage to taxidermy specimens by eating materials and leaving larvae husks behind. Dermestid beetles in particular can digest keratin and will feed on hair, horns, and feathers.&lt;ref name=4handbook /&gt; Signs of a pest infestation in taxidermy include small piles of dust (known as frass) underneath a specimen and shedding skin from growing larvae.&lt;ref name=5natsca&gt;NatSCA and ICON. Care and Conservation of Zoological Specimens. Retrieved from http://natsca.org/sites/default/files/publications-full/care-and-conservation-of-zoological-specimens.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Additional signs of an infestation include chewing marks, loss of hair, fur, or feathers on mounts, webbing, and fecal pellets or stains.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service Conserve O Gram. Identifying Museum Insect Pest Damage. Retrieved from https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/03-11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental damage ===

==== Pollutants ====
Over time, taxidermy specimens can accumulate layers of dust, dirt, and other airborne pollutants, especially if they are house on open shelving or display. Additionally, cases and containers made of unstable materials can off gas pollutants, such as H2s, SO2, formaldehyde, peroxides, and organic acids, which can damage the surfaces of taxidermy.&lt;ref name=7standards&gt;Standards in the Care of Skins and Taxidermy Collections. Retrieved from http://conservation.myspecies.info/node/32&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Light ====
Fading of fur, feathers, and skins is almost exclusively caused by improper lighting conditions, such as long-term exposure to [[Ultraviolet light|ultraviolet (UV) light]]. UV light can come from both natural and artificial lighting sources.

==== Temperature ====
Specimens may lose fur or feathers when exposed to warm environments because the high temperature causes residual fats in skins to release.&lt;ref name=5natsca /&gt;

==== Humidity ====
Taxidermy specimens are especially susceptible to fluctuations in humidity due to their composite materials. Relative humidity fluctuations below 40% can cause greater damage than fluctuations above 40%.&lt;ref name=7standards /&gt; Dry environments with low humidity may cause de-lamination or cracking in horns, bones, and turtle shells. Additionally, dry environments can cause skins and leathers to contract and shrink over the support form, which eventually leads to cracking and splitting. High humidity and moist environments can promote mold growth and attract pests. Bones will contract and swell due to humidity fluctuations, which may lead to cracking and splitting.&lt;ref name=5natsca /&gt; This may lead to further structural damage if the bones are used as support within the specimen.

=== Damage caused by humans ===

==== Improper handling ====
Breakage of appendages is likely to occur if specimens are not properly handled. Bird specimens are especially susceptible to breaking at the neck,&lt;ref name=3trophies /&gt; while mammals’ ears tend to be the first component to break or become disfigured.

==== Packing and shipping ====
Given their unique shape and form, taxidermy specimens can be difficult to ship and if not packed properly, can be easily damaged. Ears, necks, and birds’ beaks can break or bend during shipment if not properly supported.&lt;ref name=2vertebrates /&gt;

==== Theft and vandalism ====
[[File:Stolen Rhinoceros horn 2.jpg|thumb|Rhinoceros specimen with missing horn due to theft]]
Some taxidermy specimens are vulnerable to direct damage by humans, especially if the species is associated with a valuable body part. Thieves may opt to take only part of a taxidermy specimen, which can impact the structural integrity of the entire specimen.

=== Inherent vice ===
Sometimes taxidermy specimens are susceptible to damage that is difficult to avoid and inherent to the nature of taxidermy. Metals, such as nickel and copper, used in support structures and forms can react to fatty acids in skins and cause corrosion.&lt;ref name=7standards /&gt; Gravity can also negatively impact taxidermy specimens by pulling unsupported components, such as tails and horns, away from the main structure, thus causing tears and breaks.&lt;ref name=3trophies /&gt; Gravitational damage typically occurs with specimens on display, where support structures are not part of a diorama or case. However, hanging study skins in storage experience a gravitational pull that causes stretching and tearing of the skins.&lt;ref name=7standards /&gt;

== Hazardous materials in taxidermy ==
Before extensive handling, hands-on display use &lt;ref name=4handbook /&gt; or conservation treatments are carried out, it is important to test taxidermy specimens for hazardous materials. [[Arsenic]], mercury, [[napthalene]], paradichlorobenze, [[asbestos]], and [[DDT]] are all commonly found in taxidermy collections.&lt;ref name=4handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=8pesticides&gt;American Museum of Natural History. Residual Pesticides. Retrieved from http://www.amnh.org/our-research/natural-science-collections-conservation/general-conservation/health-safety/residual-pesticides&lt;/ref&gt; These chemicals were used to treat skins during preparation and helped reduce mold and pest damage. However, they can cause serious health concerns and illness in humans. Conservators may test for the presence of these hazardous materials in order to determine the appropriate course of treatment. In addition to testing, conservators may also review museum records, inspect specimens, or examine storage areas to determine what hazardous materials may be present.&lt;ref name=8pesticides /&gt;

== Conservation and restoration treatments ==
Treatments should be carried out by conservators or qualified taxidermists. Some taxidermists have experience working with museums and can coordinate with conservators to preserve specimens. When cleaning specimens, it is necessary to wear protective gear such as nitrile gloves, dust masks, eye protection, and lab coats.

=== Basic cleaning ===
Taxidermy specimens can gather dirt and dust over time and may only need basic remedial treatments to be conserved. Basic cleaning can be done on a regular basis to help keep specimens in good condition.

==== Fur ==== 
[[File:Taxidermied tiger head, Natural History Museum, Berlin, Germany - 20101107.jpg|thumb|Example of fur on a tiger specimen]]
{{Main article|Conservation and restoration of fur objects}}
[[Fur]] may be gently cleaned with a soft-bristled brush or comb, which will help loosen particulates that have built up. A vacuum with a soft brush attachment will also work to remove dust and dirt.	For particularly dirty furs, conservators may opt to wash the specimen’s fur with water and a mild detergent or soap. If a mount has been exposed to fire and is covered with fine soot, a smoke sponge may be used to wipe down the fur. Some taxidermists promote cleaning of fur with furniture polish, however, this method will cause wax to build up and eventually dull the color of the fur.&lt;ref name=9carolina&gt;Carolina Conservation blog. Cleaning Taxidermy. Retrieved from https://carolinaconservation.wordpress.com/tag/cleaning-taxidermy/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Feathers ====
[[File:Ardea cinerea - Museum fur Naturkunde, Berlin - DSC00189.JPG|thumb|A variety of feathers are present on some bird specimens (Great Blue Heron pictured)]]
{{Main article|Conservation and restoration of feathers}}
Dust and dirt can accumulate feathers and can be cleaned manually. The preferred methods are gentle brushing with a soft bristled brush or pinpoint vacuuming through a screen. These methods will leave the feathers in good condition in their natural alignment. However, solvents may be needed to clean feathers if dust is held in place by grease, which can leach out of skins. Distilled water may be used if dry methods fail, but more stubborn dust may need to be cleaned with non-denatured 70% ethanol. However, solvents may strip natural oils in feathers and leave them brittle.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, S. (1996). Cleaning Mounted Birds. Retrieved from http://cool.conservation-us.org/byform/mailing-lists/cdl/1996/1168.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Skin ====
Exposed skin on a mount, such as noses, mouths, or birds’ feet, may be cleaned with a soft microfiber cloth or brush. Some birds’ feet may be artificially colored and will not react well if solvents are applied.&lt;ref name=9carolina /&gt;

==== Bone, horns and antler objects ====
{{Main article|Conservation and restoration of bone, horn, and antler objects}}
Horns that are starting to crack may be treated with conservation-grade beeswax polish that will help protect against dehydration.&lt;ref name=5natsca /&gt; Beaks are another component of taxidermy specimens that are typically artificially colored and should only be cleaned with brushes and soft clothes.&lt;ref name=9carolina /&gt;

==== Glass components ====
{{Main article|Conservation and restoration of glass objects}}
Taxidermy specimens have glass eyes that can be gently cleaned with glass cleaner.&lt;ref name=9carolina /&gt;

=== Repair and restoration techniques ===
If a taxidermy specimen has been significantly damaged, conservators may have to use more thorough and sometimes invasive techniques to restore them. These techniques can help to stabilize the specimen's condition while also restoring the appearance to be more scientifically accurate. Before undertaking any repairs, conservators use a variety of imaging techniques, such as photography and x-rays, to get a good idea of the structure and level of damage of the specimen.

==== Structural repair ====
Fill materials may be used on taxidermy specimens to correct areas of loss. It is important that the specimen is in stable condition because many fill materials have drawbacks that can further damage the specimen.  Fills typically consist of a backing made of inert fabric combined with a resin, starch, or cellulose ether.&lt;ref&gt;Nieuwenhuizen, L. (1998). Synthetic Fill Materials for Skins, Leathers, and Furs. Retrieved from http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic37-01-010.html&lt;/ref&gt; For example, bird specimens that have been badly damaged by pests may be repaired with a mixture of synthetic fabrics and wheat starch. This mixture is used to infill areas of loss and feathers are replaced where possible with a wheat starch paste adhesive. In addition to infilling, taxidermy specimens may require structural repairs. Small specimens that have experienced loss of a head or appendage, a new wire armature may be inserted into the specimen in order to remount the broken piece. Adhesive can be used to further secure the broken piece to its original body.&lt;ref&gt;Horniman Museum and Gardens. Conserving Our Taxidermy. Retrieved from http://www.horniman.ac.uk/collections/conserving-our-taxidermy&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Recoloring fur ====
A relatively recent development in taxidermy restoration, metal complex dyes have been used to recolor fur. The [[American Museum of Natural History]] performed extensive research and tests using these dyes to recolor the furs of taxidermy specimens during the restoration of the Hall of North American Mammals. Many of the dyes have a high lightfastness and are more resistant to fading. When applied to fur, they also allow for a more natural look and feel. Another major benefit to using dyes, as opposed to acrylic paints, to recolor fur is they are reversible. The dyes can be reduced or entirely removed with application of ethanol. Research is still being done into the dyes’ lightfastness and fixability, as well as whether or not they cause the fur to degrade over time.&lt;ref name=13true&gt;In Their True Colors blog. A Horse of a Different Color: Researching Colorants for Recoloring Taxidermy. Retrieved from https://intheirtruecolors.wordpress.com/category/renovation-of-the-bernard-family-hall-of-north-american-mammals/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Diorama repair ====
3D printing is a newer method being used to replace foliage in some dioramas because it can quickly replicate hundreds of leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Yale University. 3D Printing: Restoring Museum Dioramas. Retrieved from http://dmca.yalecollege.yale.edu/news/3d-printing-restoring-museum-exhibitions&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pest treatments ====
Pests may be treated with a number of methods, including freezing, insecticide, or anoxia.&lt;ref name=5natsca /&gt; These treatments help kill off adults and larvae, though specimens may require additional cleaning and stabilization after these treatments are performed.

== Preventative care and maintenance ==
In order to prolong the life of a taxidermy specimen, it is necessary for museums and conservators to implement [[Collections care|preventative care]] and maintenance strategies. These strategies help protect specimens from damage caused by humidity, temperature, pests, humans, and more.

=== Proper storage and display conditions ===
One of the most effective ways to prevent damage from occurring to taxidermy collections is to establish a monitoring system or procedure that routinely checks the condition of specimens.&lt;ref name=7standards /&gt; When not on display, taxidermy specimens should be housed in well-sealed cabinets or cases. Metal cabinets may be made of aluminum and/or stainless steel with an epoxy powder coating and are effective at preventing pest and light damage. Wood cabinets can provide better protection from fluctuations in relative humidity, though they off-gas chemicals that may damage collections.&lt;ref name=7standards /&gt; Though it is essential for cabinets and cases to be well-sealed, they should also allow for minimal airflow to prevent off-gassed chemicals or humidity from building up inside the container. For taxidermy specimens housed on open shelving, a polythene sheet can provide temporary protection from pollutants, though dust may accumulate electrostatically (2).
Controlled lighting conditions with UV filters are important for reducing fading in taxidermy specimens.&lt;ref name=13true /&gt; Specimens should be regularly rotated in order to reduce light damage. 50-100 lux is the recommended light exposure for taxidermy, though some types of feathers are susceptible to damage at 50 lux.&lt;ref name=7standards /&gt; The maximum annual exposure levels for biological specimens, feathers, fur, and leather is 180,000 lux hours.&lt;ref name=4handbook /&gt; In the span of one year, a taxidermy mount will fade half as much if displayed in low light compared to the same conditions in high light.&lt;ref name=4handbook /&gt; 
Ideal relative humidity conditions for taxidermy specimens are 40% minimum and 55% maximum.&lt;ref name=7standards /&gt; An [[Museum integrated pest management|integrated pest management system]] is important to manage and monitor pests that can damage collections.

=== Proper handling ===
Proper handling techniques are essential to protect specimens from damage. Conservators will inspect taxidermy specimens for signs of weakness or detachable parts before moving the object. It is important for anyone handling taxidermy to remove jewelry, such as watches, rings, or bracelets, that may scratch or snag parts of the specimen. If the taxidermy specimen is mounted on a base or in a tray, it is preferred to only handle the base or tray while moving the object, rather than the specimen itself. Conservators will also use a secondary support, such as padding, to support the taxidermy specimen while in transit.&lt;ref&gt;American Museum of Natural History. Specimen Handling Checklist. Retrieved from http://www.amnh.org/our-research/natural-science-collections-conservation/general-conservation/preventive-conservation&lt;/ref&gt; Wearing nitrile gloves while handling specimens will help prevent oil and perspiration transfer.&lt;ref name=5natsca /&gt;

=== Packing and shipping ===
Bases of taxidermy mounts should be affixed to a shipping container with screws, straps, staples or tapes, with light and loose packing materials supporting the specimen’s structure.&lt;ref name=2vertebrates /&gt; This keeps the specimen stable during shipment, and informs the receiver which way the specimen is oriented within the container. Additionally, polystyrene or polyethylene bags may be used to cover taxidermy specimens during shipment.&lt;ref name=7standards /&gt;

== Notable Examples ==
=== American Museum of Natural History mammal hall ===
[[File:Alaska Moose at the American Museum of Natural History.jpg|thumb|Alaska moose diorama at the American Museum of Natural History in 2012, after restoration]]
In 2011-2012, the [[American Museum of Natural History]] undertook the restoration of 43 dioramas in its Bernard Family Hall of North American Mammals. In addition to repairing mounts, conservators worked on restoring the dioramas’ set pieces and background paintings.&lt;ref&gt;American Museum of Natural History. Bernard Family Hall of North American Mammals. Retrieved from http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent-exhibitions/mammal-halls/bernard-family-hall-of-north-american-mammals&lt;/ref&gt; In order to restore the taxidermy mounts and specimens, conservators removed smaller animals from the dioramas and built temporary scaffolding around larger animals, such as the 500-pound bison. Many of the larger mounts are affixed to their diorama case and could not easily be moved without risking further damage. One of the main goals of the project was to bring back scientific accuracy to the specimens, including their fur coloring. The museum’s conservators tested and developed a new method of treatment for recoloring furs that uses metal dyes instead of traditional materials, such as paints and hair dyes. Other details of specimens were updated and restored - the cougar’s whiskers were replaced with porcupine quills to give the face a fuller appearance and veins were added to the antelope jackrabbit’s ears to give a realistic appearance. In order to protect the restored taxidermy specimens and dioramas, UV-filtered lights were installed throughout the mammal hall.&lt;ref&gt;Scientific America. New Technology for Old Dioramas. Retrieved from https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-technology-old-dioramas/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Postal Museum’s "Owney"===
[[File:OwneyDog.jpg|thumb|Owney, before treatments]]
In 2011, the Smithsonian’s National Postal Museum restored its beloved “Owney”, the canine mascot of the Railway Mail Service. Owney was taxidermied in 1987 and had undergone previous restoration attempts. Using new methods and treatments, conservators removed dust, built-up wax, paint, and traces of arsenic. They also reshaped his face to be more accurate based on photographic evidence, as well as replaced his vest with a more accurate leather harness. As a result of the restoration, Owney’s fur is fuller, his tail is fluffier, and he has a more historically accurate appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Postal Museum Blog.

===Napoleon’s Horse "Vizir"===
Almost 200 years old, Vizir was one of Napoleon Bonaparte’s horses, and its mount has been on display at the Musee de l’Armee in Paris. The horse was showing significant signs of deterioration and a campaign was launched to fund its restoration. Conservators and taxidermists worked to rehydrate the skin, repair tears in the body, and restore coloration to the fur. Once the treatments were completed, Vizir was placed in a climate-controlled case to prevent further deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;Hyperallergic. Taxidermists Restore Napoleon’s Beloved White Horse.

===Henry the Elephant===
The Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History revamped its main rotunda in 2015, and restored its centerpiece elephant, Henry, which has been on display since 1959. Previous restorations have been performed, including one in the 1970s that involved replacing the tusks with fiberglass replicas to reduce stress on the specimen. The elephant was dusted and vacuumed to remove debris, then waxes were used to infill cracks and make other repairs. The skin was retextured and recolored to more closely resemble an elephant hide.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post. How a Museum Gives an Elephant a Facelift.

'''Domestic drama''' expresses and focuses on the realistic everyday lives of [[middle-class|middle or lower classes]] in a certain society, generally referring to the post-[[Renaissance]] eras. According to the ''English Communications Syllabus'', domestic drama refers to a dramatic story containing an emphasis on its “characters' intimate relationships and their responses to [the] unfolding events in their lives.” The characters, their lives, and the events that occur within the show are usually classified as 'ordinary' events, lives, and characters, but this does not limit the extent of what domestic drama can represent. Domestic drama does, however, take the approach in which it “concerns people much like ourselves, taken from the lower and middle classes of society, who struggle with everyday problems such as poverty, sickness, crime, and family strife.” 

==Roots==
Domestic is derived from the Latin domus, or home. The word domestic is defined as “of or relating to the household.” [[Drama]] receives the definition of “A prose or verse composition, especially one telling a serious story, that is intended for representation by actors impersonating the characters and performing the dialogue and action,” and it is derived from the Greek word drao, to act or to take action. The combination of both domestic and drama provides a literal translation of “a serious story relating to the household,” clearly a synonymous definition to the given definition provided by the English Communications Syllab

==Development and History==
Dramatic works have nearly always contained a sense of domestic drama within its fundamental plot line.&lt;ref&gt;{{answers.com|drama}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the early ages of [[Greek drama]], there has been a sense of ordinary people's struggles with their lives (though this cannot be classified as domestic drama due to the incorporation of the Greek gods interfering with the common people and the enabling of the common people to have “godlike” attributes). [[Medieval theatre]] tended to express religious themes within their shows with miracles and the creation of [[morality play]]s, in which the shows were used as religious allegories. Though not yet emphasizing the ordinary lives, the development of dramatic works is slowly working towards more realistic plot lines, one of the essential elements in domestic drama.
[[History of theatre#Renaissance theatre|Renaissance theatre]] marks the arrival of [[pastoral drama]], drama referring to the relationships of the [[peasant|rustics]]. Though this describes the events of 'ordinary people', the shows tended to stretch realism, focussed mainly on the [[romantic relationship]]s of the rustics, and were decorated with an emphasis on the [[comedic]] aspect of theater. Pastoral drama was considered to be more successful than the traditional [[comedy|comedies]] and [[tragedy|tragedies]], enforcing the further development into domestic drama.

Drama in the late seventeenth century consisted of [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] comedies focusing on the comedic relationships within the [[upper class]]es. This era also consisted of the [[Restoration drama]] and placed an emphasis on the usage of [[poetry|poetic language]], “sensational incidents, and epic personages” within the show. These styles of shows are not considered domestic dramas because they focus on the relationships of the higher classes, as opposed to the middle or lower classes. This further develops into domestic drama as the plot lines become more realistic and centered around [[Fictional character|character]]s' relationships and their actions towards each other.

The eighteenth century marks the arrival of domestic drama as the shows start focusing on the problems of the ordinary people. The early eighteenth century playwrights used domestic drama to express the “trend toward sentimental [[bourgeois]] realism.” These new domestic dramas also incorporated realistic comedies of fairly sophisticated characterizations [with] middle-class [[morality]]. These early domestic dramas are classified as part of the Romantic era of all types of arts.

[[Image:Ibsen-Dresden01.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Portrait of a younger Henrik Ibsen, one of the first playwrights to adapt domestic drama into his works.]]Nineteenth century drama took the complete step in incorporating [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] into drama, thus resulting in more serious and [[philosophical]] drama. Characters and [[Setting (fiction)|setting]]s gradually developed into the realistic truths of the current society. Along with realism was [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]]: “selective realism emphasizing the more sordid and pessimistic aspects of life.” This movement of combined realism and naturalism gave way to the “slice-of-life” shows commonly synonymous with domestic drama. One outstanding playwright of this era was [[Henrik Ibsen]] of [[Norway]]. His frequent usage of realism within his shows “brought to a climax the realistic movement of the nineteenth century and also served as a bridge to twentieth century symbolism.”&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University Press via answers.com, section 7 paragraph 5&lt;/ref&gt; Ibsen used middle-class characters dealing with his complex plots and “surpassed other such works” of his time. Playwrights such as Ibsen have drawn much attention to domestic drama and have brought this method to its high significant stature in modern theatrical works.

The twentieth century introduced [[symbol]]ism into the makings of domestic dramas, ultimately causing variations within domestic drama. Early twentieth century shows incorporated such [[psychological device]]s as “minimal scenery, telegraphic dialogue, talking machines, and characters portrayed as types rather than individuals.”&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University Press via answers.com
section 8 paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic drama suddenly became a combination of [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], [[expressionism]], symbolism, and commonly used psychological affairs. The classification of domestic dramas became unclear as shows challenged new ideas and created a difficulty in determining the [[illusion]]s and [[Realism (arts)|realism]] of a show.

Modern dramas usually revolve around [[psychological]], [[social]], and [[political]] affairs, all of which seem to have their roots in domestic drama. Modern works also use interpretive ideas, such as “distinctive voice and vision, stark settings, austere language in spare dialog, meaningful silences, the projection of a powerful streak of menace, and outbursts of real or implied violence.”&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University Press via answers.com section 8 paragraph 9&lt;/ref&gt;  The utensils of dramatic works have greatly expanded, but all still carry the roots of domestic drama. Domestic drama also carries the implications of current affairs with society: such as [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]], [[feminism]], and current political and sociological disputes. Current domestic drama itself tends to express the “war-at-home” style of theater, whereas twentieth century domestic drama could be classified as [[experimental theater]] or [[symbolic theater]].

==Audience Appeal==
Domestic drama tends to appeal to the audience because most of the audience can relate to the events within a domestic drama. The audience is appealed to this style of drama in four ways: empathy, humor, suspense, and resolution of the issues. This group of spectators can empathize with the domestic drama at hand because the domestic drama touches incidents that are common to the 'ordinary' people. Many playwright use the audience's empathy to manipulate the proposed expression of the show. David Williamson's “Brilliant Lies” uses “domestic unit battling” to create sympathy from the audience as they are confronted with the issue.
Humor provides the entertainment value within a domestic drama as these usually touch base with serious matters. The entertainment value of a show keeps the people engaged without having to continually use serious turns of events in order to maintain an audience's interest.
Suspense provides “dramatic irony” as the audience indulges itself within the characters' situation and privacy of their backgrounds. Suspense is used in a domestic drama in order for the audience to react with the characters of the show. This “[positions] the audience to feel privileged and therefore involved with the unfolding drama.”
As in all shows, an audience expects a resolution to the conflict within a show. Domestic dramas drive the show to its resolution to keep the audience desiring to reach the climax. Domestic dramas use such a technique that is very similar to the style of modern soap operas.

==Text==
The text of a domestic drama follows a specific guideline in order to stay within this genre: subject, structure, and language. By deviating from this guideline too excessively, the classification as a domestic drama becomes problematic.
The subject of a domestic drama must be that of the 'ordinary' people. The audience (generally 'ordinary') needs to connect with the characters of the domestic drama, and the plot must the following the “[[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]]” of “traditional families, urban family units, or domestic households.” The subject of the domestic drama could also imply to relationships at a workplace as this does relate to the 'ordinary' events of 'ordinary' people. The subjects of concern could vastly range from poverty to family strife, from civil rights to economic injustices. Due to the audience relationship with the material of the domestic drama, most domestic dramas are most successful in the society in which the plot is direct towards because the audience is most familiar with the culture of the show.
Domestic dramas follow a fairly linear structure and generally have a sort of patriarchal figure as a representative of the family. This patriarchal figure provides the guidelines of the everyday nature of the subjects of the show. Confrontations with the patriarchal figure are also a common structure within domestic dramas.
The language used in a domestic drama generally relates with the 'ordinary' subjects of a show to reinforce the “realistic impression” of the show onto and audience. The usage of a specific language enables a specific audience to further connect with the subjects of the domestic drama as language is an “intimate personal way of communicating.”

==Social expression==
Theater has been commonly used as a public expression of the humanitarian affairs of a certain era. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth era, drama expressed the ideals of the caste and court system, with nobility on high and rustics down low. This expression gave way to the public in order to see and understand how this system was to work within their society. Some might say that theater has played a very important role in the shaping of societies when used in this way. Nineteenth century induced the importance of the middle-class within drama and introduced the role of the bourgeois and the usage of aristocratic entertainment. The political aspects of a certain era were inevitably present within these shows, especially shows leading towards domestic drama. Theater was considered to have “good [socially] position” characters against the immoral acts of society, usually a sort of infringement against a certain code of behavior. Theater was the way to explain the rights and wrongs of a certain lifestyle in a society, especially if the characters were of the 'ordinary' people so that the audience could relate with the characters. Modern drama changed this aspect of theater as it was not directed towards any one class in society, but rather the collaboration of the artistic aspects within these classes. Such a combination created much difficulty in domestic drama as domestic drama appeals to a specific class.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12722">'''Early American molded [[glass]]''' refers to functional and decorative objects, such as [[bottle]]s and [[dishware]], that were manufactured in the [[United States]] in the 19th century.  The objects were produced by blowing [[molten]] glass into a mold, thereby causing the glass to assume the shape and pattern design of the mold.
Common blown molded [[tableware]] items bearing designs include salt dishes, [[Sugar bowl (dishware)|sugar bowls]], [[creamer (crockery)|creamer]]s, celery stands, decanters, and [[drinking glass]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Kenneth M.  ''New England Glass and Glassmaking''.  Corning, NY:Corning Museum of Glass, 1972., p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;  Household items, other than dishware, made using the three-mold method include [[inkwells]], [[Kerosene lamp|oil lamps]], [[birdcage]] fountains, [[hat]]s, medicine and [[perfume bottles]], and [[witch balls]].&lt;ref&gt;Papert, Emma.  ''The Illustrated Guide to American Glass''. New York:Hawthorn Books, 1972 p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Whiskey]] flasks bearing unique designs were made in two part molds.  Undecorated bottles used as containers for a variety of [[liquids]] were blown into [[Square (geometry)|square]] molds to give them corners so they could be packed into compartments of [[wooden]] cases.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, Lura Woodside.  ''American Glass and Glassmaking''. New York:Chanticleer Press, 1950., p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After the [[War of 1812]], American glass manufacturers began using molds as an inexpensive way to produce glassware similar in appearance to the very costly cut glass that was imported from [[Waterford, Ireland]].&lt;ref name="Papert, 1972, p. 83"&gt;Papert, 1972, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;     A dearth of skilled [[Glassblowing|glassblowers]] may have also led to the increased use of molds.&lt;ref&gt;McKearin, George S. and Helen McKearin  ''American Glass''. New York:Crown Publishing, 1948., p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Blown molded glass was popular for about twenty years before it was superseded by [[pressed glass]].&lt;ref name="Papert, 1972, p. 83"/&gt;

==Production==
The process of blowing molten glass into a mold made of [[clay]] is known to have been employed in [[Syrian]] workshops as early as the 4th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, R.W. and Susan Frank.  ''A history of glassmaking''.  London and Tonbridge: The Whitefriars Press Ltd., 1972., p.3&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rome|Romans]] adopted the technique in the 1st century CE.&lt;ref&gt;”blow molding” ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'',2010. http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/70079/blow-molding(retrieved 10/26/2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  Molds used in 19th-century European and American glass [[factories]] were cast in [[iron]] or [[bronze]].&lt;ref&gt;Stern, E. Marianne.  ''Roman mold-blown glass: the first through sixth centuries''. Rome: L’Erma di Bretschneider, 1995., p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;  They were made by [[professional]] mold manufacturers in many large United States [[cities]] and were universally available. Although no intact molds have been found, fragments of molds have been excavated at glass manufacturing sites in [[Sandwich, Massachusetts]] and Kent and [[Mantua, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;Papert, 1972, p.112&lt;/ref&gt;

The mold, which was placed on the [[floor]] or below floor level,&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, 1950, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; was not three molds, but one mold in three parts.  It was made of [[hinged]] sections that could be opened and closed by means of a foot or hand operated [[treadle]]. One of the vertical walls of the mold was permanently fastened to the base and the other walls were attached to it by removable pins. Designs were cut into the inside walls of all mold parts. Some molds impressed a pattern on the object and base, while others omitted the base. Most molds were in three parts, but could also be constructed of two or four parts. Regardless of the number of parts of a mold, all objects produced in a mold are called three-mold glass.&lt;ref&gt;Papert 1972, p.100&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of molding was just the initial step in the manufacture of three-mold glass.  After removal from the mold, the glass was expanded by means of additional blowing.&lt;ref name="Watkins,1950, p.44"&gt;Watkins,1950, p.44&lt;/ref&gt;   The object was then cracked off at the rim and hand finished by grinding and polishing.&lt;ref name="Wilson 1972, p.237"&gt;Wilson 1972, p.237&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pitcher (container)|Pitcher]] rims, [[decanter]] necks and bases all required hand work.  In New England, pieces were often finished with threaded lips. Handles were also added after removal from the mold.&lt;ref name="Watkins,1950, p.44"/&gt;  Lamps, [[candlesticks]] and [[vases]] were pressed in separate parts and fused together while still hot.&lt;ref&gt;McKearin, 1948,  p.18&lt;/ref&gt;  Finished pieces were fire polished by reheating in the [[furnace]], which softened the pattern and gave the piece a diffuse brilliance.&lt;ref name="Papert 1972, p.102"&gt;Papert 1972, p.102&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1820 and 1840, one hundred glass factories are known to have been in operation in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, 1950, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  It is known from descriptions in [[advertisements]] and [[invoices]] that the [[Boston and Sandwich Glass Company]] and the [[New England Glass Company]] were major producers of blown three-mold glass.&lt;ref name="Wilson 1972, p.237"/&gt;  Most colorless glass was made by the New England Glass Company in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Papert 1972, p.112"&gt;Papert 1972, p.112&lt;/ref&gt;  Also producing three-mold glass in [[New England]] was the Boston Crown Glass Manufactory,&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, 1950, p.43&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Quincy Glass Works in Massachusetts, which made snuff bottles molded to a square form.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, 1950, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;  Three-piece molds were used from 1815 to 1835 in [[midwestern]] houses, most notably in [[Ohio]].   Marlboro Street Factory in [[Keene, NH]] manufactured dark green and amber bottle glass and was known for the manufacture of inkwells.  In [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]], famous glass manufacturers of blown three-mold glass include the [[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]] Glass Company, [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]] Flint Glass Works, and [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] Glassworks. The [[Coventry, CT]] Glass Company was also a manufacturer of three-mold items.  It is believed that glass factories in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[Baltimore]] also produced three-mold glassware, but since [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] is not possible, no proof exists. Some foreign molded three-part glass manufactured in [[England]], [[Ireland]] (two part molds) and [[France]] (three part molds) in the early 19th century, is sometimes mistaken for American glass.&lt;ref name="Papert 1972, p.112"/&gt;

==Colors and Patterns==
Colors of blown three-mold glass are relatively rare,&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, 1950, p.44&lt;/ref&gt; however, some objects in deep gray-blue, sapphire blue, olive green, yellow-green, citron, aquamarine and amethyst-purple have survived.&lt;ref name="Papert 1972, p.102"/&gt;  Items made of colorless glass and green bottle glass are most commonly seen.

The three main categories of three-mold glass patterns are Geometric, Arch and Baroque.  Diamond patterning, also known as diamond diapering or diamond quilting,&lt;ref&gt;Papert 1972, p.104&lt;/ref&gt; is the most common Geometric design found on molded glass.&lt;ref name="Wilson 1972, p.237"/&gt;  Other common designs include ribbed and popcorn.&lt;ref&gt;Papert 1972, p.83&lt;/ref&gt;  Items bearing Geometric designs are the most numerous and include tableware, such as [[decanters]], stoppers, [[cruet]]s, casters, [[condiment]] sets, pitchers, [[punch bowl]]s, [[pans]], [[Dishware|dishes]], [[preserves|preserve]] dishes, [[mugs]], [[glassware|tumblers]], [[wine glasses]], celery glasses and salts, and doll dishes.  Also in the Geometric category is ribbing, which could be imprinted on the object [[Vertical direction|vertically]], [[Horizontal plane|horizontally]], [[diagonal]]ly or in a swirled pattern. Ribs can be narrow or wide, differently spaced, rounded, flat or inverted.&lt;ref name="Papert 1972, p.102"/&gt;  Arch, the most rare of the three designs, uses a series of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] (pointed) or [[Roman architecture|Roman]] (rounded) [[arch]]es. Sometimes both types of arches appear.&lt;ref&gt;Papert 1972, p.108&lt;/ref&gt;  Baroque patterning includes Shell ([[Rocailles|rocaille]]) ornaments with broad, rounded, vertical ribbing and often combined with design of a band of [[palmette]]s or [[trefoil]]s. Other Baroque designs include stars in [[circles]], [[Rosette (design)|rosettes]], thick chains([[Guilloché|guilloches]]), hearts, a [[Cornucopia|horn of plenty]], pinwheels, and fluid [[drapery]].&lt;ref&gt;Papert 1972, p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

Designs imprinted on whiskey bottles include [[political]] events, [[celebrities]], the [[Bald eagle|American eagle]], [[Cornucopia|horn of plenty]], head of [[Liberty (goddess)|Lady Liberty]], [[agricultural]] symbols and [[Masonic]] emblems. A favorite whiskey bottle [[illustration]] was the head of [[George Washington]] under which was inscribed a text. Two texts found on bottles with the Washington design are “The Father of His Country,” and “I Have Endeavor’d to do my Duty.” [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] with [[DeWitt Clinton]] were popular whiskey bottle designs at the time of the opening of the [[Erie Canal]]. Other political figures include [[Stonewall Jackson|General Jackson]] and [[Zachary Taylor]]. Taylor flasks have been discovered with the captions, “Corn for the world,” and “Gen’l Taylor Never Surrenders.” Images of [[John Quincy Adams]], [[Henry Clay]] and [[William Henry Harrison]] also appear on flasks.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, 1950 p.61&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distinguishing Characteristics===
The main characteristic that sets apart three-mold ware from pressed glass is that the inverse of the pattern of three-mold glass can be felt on the inside of the object.  Pressed glass is patterned only on the exterior and smooth inside.&lt;ref&gt;Papert 1972, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;  Pressed glass, termed “mold-pressed,” has an interior form independent of the exterior, in contrast to mold-blown glass, whose interior corresponds to the outer form.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse, David, compiler.  ''Glass: A pocket dictionary of terms commonly used to describe glass and glassmaking''. Corning, NY:Corning Museum of Glass, 1993, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;  Plates, lamp bases and [[door knobs]] were usually made of pressed glass.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson,1972, p.237&lt;/ref&gt;

Molded glass can be easily distinguished from cut glass, since cut glass sparkles with [[Prism (optics)|prismatic]] brilliance as the sharp angles of the cuts in the glass break up light into all [[color spectrum|colors of the spectrum]], and molded glass has a softer, more rounded surface which transmits a silvery, more [[Luminance|luminous]] [[Reflectivity|gleam]].  Tiny raised hairline seams where the mold sections were joined and a slight displacement in parts of the pattern are often seen on molded glass.&lt;ref name="Papert 1972, p.102"/&gt;

==Nomenclature==
Although Early American glassware advertisements are often found using the terms “moulded” and “prest” interchangeably, pattern-molded (pressed) and blown three-mold glass were manufactured by means of two distinct processes. Blown three-mold glass was sometimes called “prest” (pressed) because the glass was blown into a mold and “impressed” with a design.&lt;ref name="Wilson, 1972, p.237"&gt;Wilson, 1972, p.237&lt;/ref&gt;  Various names for blown three mold glass have been used by [[Collecting|collectors]] since its rediscovery in the early 20th century. It was first called “Stiegel glass” by collector Frederick W. Hunter because a few pieces of three-mold glass were included in his Stiegel collection. Later, it was called [[Stoddard, New Hampshire|Stoddard glass]], after the name of a factory that, in fact, never made three-mold glass. In the 1920s, American glass writer Rhea Mansfield Knittle unsuccessfully tried to introduce the term “[[Insufflation|insufflated]].”&lt;ref&gt;Papert, 1972 p.100&lt;/ref&gt;  Blown-three-mold pieces might also be called “blown molded” &lt;ref&gt;Lee, Ruth Webb. "Flashback: Blown Molded Glass of New England," ''American Collector'' (April 1940) reprinted online in ''Collectors Weekly'' (April 1, 2009) http://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/blown-molded-glass-of-new-england/ (retrieved 10/23/2010)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as “pre-blown-three-mold” because molten glass was partially inflated before it was inserted into the mold.&lt;ref name="Wilson, 1972, p.237"/&gt;  The names currently used by collectors are three-mold or blown three-mold.

Among other things, she has proposed that if 19th-century scientists had thought to name prehistorical periods with an eye on women’s work and the things they invented, instead of focusing their naming only on men’s more durable inventions ([[Iron Age]], [[Bronze Age]], etc.), that they might have acknowledged women's invention of string as what she has named “The String Revolution.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imow.org/community/blog/viewBlog?id=1&amp;archiveDate=8%2F1%2F2009 |title=Clio Talks Back - International Museum of Women |publisher=Imow.org |date=2009-11-08 |accessdate=2012-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624010623/http://www.imow.org/community/blog/viewBlog?id=1&amp;archiveDate=8%2F1%2F2009 |archivedate=2011-06-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernst Karl Abbe''' [[FRMS|HonFRMS]] (23 January 1840 – 14 January 1905) was a [[Germany|German]] [[physicist]], [[optical engineering|optical scientist]], [[entrepreneur]], and social reformer. Together with [[Otto Schott]] and [[Carl Zeiss]], he laid the foundation of modern [[optics]]. Abbe developed numerous optical instruments. He was a co-owner of [[Carl Zeiss AG]], a German manufacturer of research microscopes, astronomical telescopes, planetariums and other optical systems.

Abbe was born 23 January 1840 in [[Eisenach]], [[Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]],&lt;ref name="NDB"&gt;{{harvnb|Blasius|1953|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Georg Adam Abbe and Elisabeth Christina Barchfeldt.&lt;ref name=wws&gt;{{harvnb|Debus|Calinger|Collins|Kennedy|1968|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came from a humble home — his father was a foreman in a spinnery. Supported by his father's employer, Abbe was able to attend secondary school and to obtain the general qualification for university entrance with fairly good grades, at the Eisenach Gymnasium, which he graduated from in 1857.&lt;ref name =gu/&gt; By the time he left school, his scientific talent and his strong will had already become obvious. Thus, in spite of the family's strained financial situation, his father decided to support Abbe's studies at the Universities of [[University of Jena|Jena]] (1857–1859) and [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] (1859–1861).&lt;ref name="NDB"/&gt; During his time as a student, Abbe gave private lessons to improve his income. His father's employer continued to fund him. Abbe was awarded his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in Göttingen on 23 March 1861.&lt;ref name=gu&gt;{{harvnb|Günther|1970|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at school, he was influenced by [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]], who also happened to be one of the [[Göttingen Seven]].&lt;ref name=gu2&gt;{{harvnb|Günther|1970|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by two short assignments at the Göttingen [[observatory]] and at Physikalischer Verein in [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] (an association of citizens interested in physics and chemistry that was founded by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] in 1824 and still exists today).&lt;ref name=gu2/&gt; On 8 August 1863 he qualified as a university lecturer at the University of Jena. In 1870, he accepted a contract as an associate [[professor]] of experimental [[physics]], [[mechanics]] and [[mathematics]] in Jena.&lt;ref name="NDB"/&gt;&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, he married Else Snell, daughter of the mathematician and physicist Karl Snell, one of Abbe's teachers,{{refn|group=nb|Some sources give his wife's name as Elisabeth.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt;}} with whom he had two daughters.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; He attained full professor status by 1879.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; He became director of the [[Jena Observatory|Jena astronomical and meteorological observatory]] in 1878.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|The dates of his job appointments at the University of Jena, including his appointment as director of the Jena Observatory has some uncertainty, as sources give different dates, as following. 1870: assistant lecturer on mechanics and experimental physics; 1873: associate professor; 1877: director of the Jena Observatory meteorological and astronomy departments.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt;}} In 1889, he became a member of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]]. He also was a member of the Saxon Academy of Sciences. He was relieved of his teaching duties at the University of Jena in 1891. Abbe died 14 January 1905 in Jena.&lt;ref name="NDB"/&gt; He was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph McCabe (1945). A Biographical Dictionary of Ancient, Medieval, and Modern Freethinkers. Haldeman-Julius Publications. Retrieved 7 April 2013. He was not only a distinguished German physicist and one of the most famous inventors on the staff at the Zeiss optical works at Jena but a notable social reformer, By a generous scheme of profit-sharing he virtually handed over the great Zeiss enterprise to the workers. Abbe was an intimate friend of Haeckel and shared his atheism (or Monism). Leonard Abbot says in his life of Ferrer that Abbe had "just the same ideas and aims as Ferrer."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abbe-Grab kl.jpg|thumb|upright|Ernst Abbe, relief at his grave]]In 1866, he became a research director at the [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss Optical Works]], and in 1886 he invented the [[Apochromat|apochromatic lens]], a microscope lens which eliminates both the primary and secondary color distortion.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; By 1870, Abbe invented the [[Abbe condenser]], used for microscope illumination.&lt;ref name =EB/&gt; In 1871, he designed the first [[refractometer]], which he described in a booklet published in 1874.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abbe|1874}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He developed the laws of image of non-luminous objects by 1872.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; Zeiss Optical Works began selling his improved microscopes in 1872, by 1877 they were selling microscopes with homogenous immersion objective, and in 1886 his apochromatic objective microscopes were being sold.&lt;ref name=pf&gt;{{harvnb|Pfeiffer|1991|p=445}}&lt;/ref&gt; He created the [[Abbe number]], a measure of any [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] material's variation of [[refractive index]] with [[wavelength]] and Abbe's criterion, which tests the hypothesis, that a systematic trend exists in a set of observations (in terms of resolving power this criterion stipulates that an angular separation cannot be less than the ratio of the wavelength to the aperture diameter, see [[angular resolution]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Joint Committee of Civil Engineers, American Congress on Surveying and Mapping, and American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already a professor in [[Jena]], he was hired by [[Carl Zeiss]] to improve the manufacturing process of optical instruments, which back then was largely based on trial and error.

Abbe was the first to define the term [[numerical aperture]],&lt;ref name="NA Est"&gt;{{harvnb|Abbe|1881}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the sine of the half angle multiplied by the refractive index of the medium filling the space between the cover glass and front lens.

Abbe is credited by many for discovering the resolution limit of the microscope, and the formula (published in 1873)

{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;d = \frac{\lambda}{2 NA}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq. 1}}}}

although in a publication in 1874 by [[Helmholtz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helmholtz|Fripp|1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; (another early appearance of this formula), [[Helmholtz]] states this formula was first derived by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], who had died 61 years prior. Helmholtz was so impressed as to offer a professorship at the [[University of Berlin]], which he refused due to his ties to Zeiss.&lt;ref name=gu2/&gt; Abbe was in the camp of the wide aperturists, arguing that microscopic resolution is ultimately limited by the aperture of the optics, but also argued that depending on application there are other parameters that should be weighted over the aperture in the design of objectives. In Abbe's 1874 paper, titled "A Contribution to the Theory of the Microscope and the nature of Microscopic Vision",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abbe|1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbe states that the resolution of a microscope is inversely dependent on its aperture, but without proposing a formula for the resolution limit of a microscope.

In 1876, Abbe was offered a partnership by Zeiss and began to share in the considerable profits.&lt;ref name=gu2/&gt; Although the first theoretical derivations of {{EquationNote|Eq. 1}} were published by others, it is fair to say that Abbe was the first to reach this conclusion experimentally. In 1878, he built the first homogenous immersion system for the microscope.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; The objectives that the Abbe Zeiss collaboration were producing were of ideal ray geometry, allowing Abbe to find that the aperture sets the upper limit of microscopic resolution, not the curvature and placement of the lenses. Abbe's first publication of {{EquationNote|Eq. 1}} occurred in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abbe|1883}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this publication, Abbe states that both his theoretical and experimental investigations confirmed {{EquationNote|Eq. 1}}. Abbe's contemporary Henry Edward Fripp, English translator of Abbe's and Helmholtz's papers, puts their contributions on equal footing. He also perfected the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference method]] by [[Fizeau]], in 1884.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; Abbe, Zeiss, Zeiss' son, [[Roderich Zeiss]], and [[Otto Schott]] formed, in 1884, [[Schott AG|Jenaer Glaswerk Schott &amp; Genossen]]. This company, which in time would in essence merge with Zeiss Optical Works, was responsible for research and production of 44 initial types of optical glass.&lt;ref name=pf/&gt; Working with [[telescope]]s, he built image reversal system in 1895.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt;

In                                     order to produce high quality objectives, Abbe made significant contributions to the diagnosis and correction of [[optical aberration]]s, both [[spherical aberration]] and [[coma aberration]], which is required for an objective to reach the resolution limit of {{EquationNote|Eq. 1}}. In addition to spherical aberration, Abbe discovered that the rays in optical systems must have constant angular magnification over their angular distribution to produce a diffraction limited spot, a principle known as the [[Abbe sine condition]].&lt;ref name="NA Est"/&gt; So monumental and advanced were Abbe's calculations and achievements that [[Frits Zernike]] based his [[Phase contrast microscopy|phase contrast]] work on them, for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1953, and [[Hans Busch (physicist)|Hans Busch]] used them to work on the development of the [[electron microscope]].&lt;ref name=gu2/&gt;

During his association with [[Carl Zeiss]]' [[microscope]] works, not only was he at the forefront of the field of optics but also labor reform as he also, in 1900, introduced the [[Eight hour day|eight-hour workday]], in remembrance of the 14-hour workday of his own father.&lt;ref name=pf/&gt; In addition, he created a pension fund and a discharge compensation fund.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; In 1889, Ernst Abbe set up and endowed the [[Carl Zeiss Foundation]] for research in science.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; The aim of the foundation was "to secure the economic, scientific, and technological future and in this way to improve the job security of their employees."&lt;ref name=pf/&gt; He made it a point that the success of an employee was based solely on their ability and performance, not on their origin, religion, or political views.&lt;ref name=pf/&gt; In 1896, he reorganized the Zeiss optical works into a cooperative with profit-sharing.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; His social views were so respected as to be used by the [[Prussia]]n state as a model and idealized by [[Alfred Weber]] in the 1947 book ''Schriften der Heidelberger Aktionsgruppe zur Demokratie und Zum Freien Sozialismus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Günther|1970|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crater [[Abbe (crater)|Abbe]] on the [[Moon]] was named in his honour.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The '''European Institute for Gender Equality''' is a [[Vilnius]]-based [[Agencies of the European Union|agency of the European Union]] inaugurated in 2007. It was established by [[European Union regulation|Council Regulation]] (EC) No 1922/2006 of 20 December 2006. Recruitment of its Director was advertised in April 2007.

Funded by the Commission, with a proposed budget of €52.5 million for the period 2007 to 2013, this new European Institute will support the EU institutions and the Member States in promoting equality between women and men and combating sex discrimination. The Institute will gather, analyse and disseminate reliable and comparable research data and information needed by policy-makers. It will have a documentation centre and a library which will be open to the public.

The Management Board of the institute consists of eighteen representatives of the EU Member States appointed by the Council and of one member representing the European Commission. An Experts' forum as further body of the institute consists of delegates designated by the Member States (28), the European Parliament (2) and the Commission (3), the latter including representatives from non-governmental, employers' and workers' organisations at EU level.

'''''Gjurmime albanologjike''''' (Albanological reconnaissance) is a scientific magazine published by the [[Albanological Institute of Pristina]], in [[Kosovo]]. The first issue came out in 1962&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|language=Albanian|publisher=Zeri Online|url=http://zeri.info/kultura/14276/50-vjet-gjurmime-albanologjike-nga-emine-fatahu-abdixhiku/| date=2015-01-08|title=50 vjet gjurmime albanologjike nga Emine Fatahu – Abdixhiku |trans-title=50 years of Gjurmime Albabanologjike frm Emine Fetahu-Abdixhiku}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since then has been a major contributor to all [[albanology]] fields study. The contributors come from Kosovo, [[Albania]], other Albanian populated areas in the [[Balkans]] as well as [[Arbëreshë people|Arbereshe]].&lt;ref name="AIP"&gt;[http://www.institutialbanologjik.com/index.aspx?SID=19&amp;LID=2&amp;AID=1171&amp;Ctype=1&amp;ACatID=15 Albanological Institute - Publishing Activity]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1970 it is split is three series: History Sciences, Philological Sciences, and [[Folklore]] and [[Ethnology]].&lt;ref name="AIP"/&gt;

== History ==
The magazine started as a scientific bulletin of the Albanology Cathedre, part of the Faculty of Philosophy of the [[University of Pristina (1969–1999)|University of Prishtina]]. Its editor-in-chief was [[Idriz Ajeti]].

Initially, it was structured as a yearly collection of articles and studies. One volume was published in 1962, followed by 1965, and 1966. The [[Albanological Institute of Pristina]] was reconstructed in 1967, and took over the magazine starting from 1968. At the time, ''Gjurmime Albanologjike'' came out as a semi-annual. In 1971, with the establishment of additional branches and disciplines inside the institute, the magazine split in three series: the History Sciences series with Ali Hadri as editor, the Philological Science series led by Idriz Ajeti, and the Folklore and Ethnology series led by [[Anton Çeta]]. The series continued to be published as yearly volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sq0BoMs861oC&amp;pg=PA627&amp;lpg=PA627&amp;dq=srednjovekovni+gradovi+i+dvorci+na+kosovu&amp;source=web&amp;ots=kA9wvrugC4&amp;sig=r3mJotyu0Fn-n2cbxvxAN5d3FH0#v=onepage&amp;q=gjurmime%20albanologike&amp;f=false| page=42|title=Historische Bücherkunde Südosteuropa| author=Mathias Bernath, Gertrud Krallert|volume=1| series= Südosteuropäische Arbeiten|number=76|publisher=Oldenbourg|oclc=5099033|year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before its split in series, the magazine focused on researches on Albanian philology and general history. After that, it covered broader thematic covering all periods from antiquity till today, plus contemporary history specific topics, as well as a bibliography of possible references for further studies and researches.&lt;ref name="AIP"/&gt;

'''Golden Week''' is the colloquial term for a unique period of early voting time during Ohio's election season in which citizens can register to vote and cast an absentee ballot on the same day.

== History ==
Golden Week was created in 2005 with new early voting legislation that allowed voters to cast absentee ballots up to 35 days before the election. The legislation was passed in response to vast complications and inefficiencies experienced during the 2004 presidential election. On top of the technical issues with vote counts and voting machines, there were many logistical issues that discouraged turnout and voter participation. Precincts were ill-equipped to handle the number of voters coming out, and in some cases waiting lines were reported to be as high as nine hours long.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Voting Problems in Ohio Set Off an Alarm|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/07/politics/campaign/voting-problems-in-ohio-set-off-an-alarm.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2004-11-07|access-date = 2015-10-08|issn = 0362-4331|first = Adam|last = Liptak}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expansion of voting time resulted in about a week of overlap with the deadline of voter registration, which was October 6.

== Usage ==
As with any period of early voting, citizens used Golden Week (and the rest of the period that did not overlap with registration deadlines) as an opportunity to cast their ballots at a time more convenient for them than Election Day itself. The added ability to vote on the same day of registration created an ideal opportunity for those who could not afford to take too much time out of their work schedules, or other obligations. While people from all walks of life have reasons to take advantage of early voting, the practice is more often associated with minorities and low-income citizens. The number of people who took advantage of these opportunities proved to be considerable. During the 2012 general election, approximately 90,000 people cast votes during Golden Week, which translated to about 14% of the total early, in-person absentee ballots cast that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/018-01_smith_report.pdf|title = ANALYSIS OF EFFECTS OF SENATE BILL 238 AND DIRECTIVE 2014-06 ON EARLY IN-PERSON (EIP) ABSENTEE VOTING BY BLACKS AND WHITES IN OHIO|date = 30 June 2014|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Smith|first = Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were several instances of organized intent to take advantage of the opportunities provided by Golden Week, as well. Many predominantly African-American churches coordinated "Souls to the Polls" campaigns designed to encourage their communities to get registered and exercise their voting rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Take Your Souls to the Polls: Voting Early in Ohio |url=https://www.aclu.org/podcast/take-your-souls-polls-voting-early-ohio |website=[[American Civil Liberties Union]] |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contention and elimination ==
Golden Week and early voting opportunities in general haven been the subject of much debate among policymakers. Some see early voting as a safeguard against the disenfranchisement of minority and lower-income citizens who are believed to use such services more often. According to some studies, there is truth to this. Data from the Pew Research Center states that youth, minorities and the poor are much more likely to be nonvoters&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Party of Nonvoters|url = http://www.people-press.org/2014/10/31/the-party-of-nonvoters-2/|website = Pew Research Center for the People and the Press|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corroborated with research from Caltech and MIT, it becomes clearer why this might be the case. Their study found that a multitude of reasons for not voting are more often used by minorities and youth than whites and older citizens. These reasons include illness, being too busy, or not having the proper transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why Are the Poor and Minorities Less Likely to Vote?|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/why-are-the-poor-and-minorities-less-likely-to-vote/282896/|website = The Atlantic|accessdate = 2015-12-18|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is factors such as those that lead many to believe that having ample early voting opportunities is particularly beneficial to those demographics. In addition to that, some believe that early voting opportunities help offset logistical issues during election day, and promote a larger overall voter turnout. Others see offering voting opportunities to the extent that Ohio has as a waste of resources and as a detriment to informed decision-making. To some, voting too early before an election represents making too hasty a decision, as important information can surface any time that has potential to shift opinions. Others believe that tighter voting procedures help minimize fraud. As such, Ohio's voting policies have been an ever-present topic in the state's political arena.

=== NAACP v. Husted ===
This debate came to a head in 2014 when the Ohio House passed Senate Bill 238, which eliminated Golden Week. This action was followed by a directive from Secretary of State John Husted, which set statewide early voting hours to be used in forthcoming elections. Husted's opponents criticized the directive for its lack of evening hours, as well as for not providing hours on Sundays or on the Monday prior to Election Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Golden Week on the chopping block for Ohio Republicans and Democrats for years (time line)|url = http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/11/golden_week_on_the_chopping_bl.html|website = cleveland.com|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discontent with these measures eventually prompted the American Civil Liberties Union to file a lawsuit that came to be known as NAACP v. Husted, as the complaint was filed on behalf of several civil rights groups including the Ohio Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the League of Women Voters of Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ACLU Files Federal Lawsuit Challenging Ohio’s Latest Attempts to Slash Early Voting Opportunities|url = https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-files-federal-lawsuit-challenging-ohios-latest-attempts-slash-early-voting-opportunities|website = American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case  was contested until it made its way to the US Supreme Court, which did not fully consider the case but still stayed the decision of the lower courts to uphold Husted's legislation. Due to persistent action by the ACLU, however, a new compromise was reached in April 2015, in which Husted agreed to restore some weekend and evening voting hours. Golden Week remained eliminated.

There has been discontent since the elimination of Golden Week from invested groups such as the ACLU, but until recently there has not been much action in the form of concentrated effort to reinstate the lost voting time. As of November 2015, attorneys have filed a new lawsuit representing Ohio democrats aimed at getting the judiciary to reexamine the state's voting policies regarding early ballot opportunities as well as rules on [[provisional ballot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Federal judge hearing dispute over Ohio’s voting rules|url = http://www.news-herald.com/general-news/20151116/federal-judge-hearing-dispute-over-ohios-voting-rules|website = www.news-herald.com|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:György Ligeti (1984).jpg|thumb|György Ligeti, 1984]]
'''György Sándor Ligeti''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|g|ə|t|i}}; {{lang-hu|Ligeti György Sándor}}, {{IPA-hu|ˈliɡɛti ˈɟørɟ ˈʃaːndor|pron}}; 28 May 1923&amp;nbsp;– 12 June 2006) was a Hungarian-Austrian [[composer]] of [[contemporary classical music]]. He has been described as "one of the most important avant-garde composers in the latter half of the twentieth century" and "one of the most innovative and influential among progressive figures of his time".&lt;ref&gt;Cummings n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Transylvania]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], he lived in [[People's Republic of Hungary|Communist Hungary]] before emigrating to [[Austria]] in 1956. He became an Austrian citizen in 1968. In 1973 he became professor of composition at the [[Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg|Hamburg Hochschule für Musik und Theater]], where he worked until retiring in 1989. He died in Vienna in 2006.

Restricted in his musical style by the authorities of Communist Hungary, only when he reached the west in 1956 could Ligeti fully realise his passion for [[avant-garde]] music and develop new compositional techniques. After experimenting with electronic music in Cologne, his breakthrough came with orchestral works such as ''[[Atmosphères]]'', for which he used a technique he later dubbed [[micropolyphony]]. After writing his "anti-anti-opera" ''[[Le Grand Macabre]]'', Ligeti shifted away from [[chromaticism]] and towards [[polyrhythm]] for his later works.

He is best known by the public through the use of his music in [[Soundtrack|film soundtracks]]. Although he did not directly compose any film scores, excerpts of pieces composed by him were taken and adapted for film use. The sound design of [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s films, particularly the music of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', drew from Ligeti's work and also contained pieces by other classical composers.&lt;!-- Needs name of sound designer/composer --&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Ligeti was born in 1923 at Dicsőszentmárton (which was renamed [[Târnăveni]] in 1941), in the [[Romania]]n region of [[Transylvania]], to Dr. Sándor Ligeti and Dr. Ilona Somogyi. His family was [[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarian]] Jewish. He was the grandnephew of the violinist [[Leopold Auer]] and cousin of Hungarian philosopher [[Ágnes Heller]].

Ligeti recalled that his first exposure to languages other than Hungarian came one day while listening to a conversation among the Romanian-speaking town police. Before that he had not known that other languages existed.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;Tusa 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]] with his family when he was six years old. He did not return to the town of his birth until the 1990s. In 1940, [[Northern Transylvania]] was annexed by Hungary following the [[Second Vienna Award]], and Cluj became part of Hungary.

In 1941 Ligeti received his initial musical training at the [[Gheorghe Dima Music Academy|conservatory in Cluj]],&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; and during the summers privately with [[Pál Kadosa]] in [[Budapest]]. In 1944, Ligeti's education was interrupted when he was sent to a [[The Holocaust#Hungary|forced labor brigade]] by the [[Hungary in World War II|Horthy regime]] during events of the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; His brother, age 16, was deported to the [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]] and both of his parents were sent to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. His mother was the only other person to survive in his immediate family.&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[World War II]], Ligeti returned to his studies in Budapest, graduating in 1949 from the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music]]. He studied under Pál Kadosa, [[Ferenc Farkas]], [[Zoltán Kodály]] and [[Sándor Veress]]. He conducted [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicological]] research into the [[Hungarian folk music]] of Transylvania. However, after a year he returned to Franz Liszt Academy in Budapest, this time as a teacher of [[harmony]], [[counterpoint]] and [[musical analysis]]. He had secured this position with the help of Kodály, and held it from 1950 to 1956.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; As a young teacher, Ligeti took the unusual step of regularly attending the lectures of an older colleague, the conductor and musicologist [[Lajos Bárdos]]. He was a conservative Christian whose circle represented a safe haven for Ligeti. The composer acknowledged Bardos's help and advice in the prefaces to his two harmony textbooks (1954 and 1956).&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 31&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the restrictions of the [[communism|communist]] government, communications between Hungary and the West by then had become difficult, and Ligeti and other artists were effectively cut off from recent developments outside the [[Eastern Bloc]].

===After leaving Hungary===
In December 1956, two months after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian revolution]] was violently suppressed by the Soviet Army, Ligeti fled to Vienna with his ex-wife Vera Spitz. (They remarried in 1957 and had a son together.)&lt;ref name="Steinitz 2003, 70–73"&gt;Steinitz 2003, 70–73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Publications |first=Europa |date=2003 |title=The International Who's Who 2004 |url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=sR4Ch1dMe8IC&amp;pg=PA1005&amp;lpg=PA1005&amp;dq=ligeti+international+whos+who&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3bQjk82VoZ&amp;sig=NTyNxUeqHDn9LLR2jJM6zZTy6EE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ligeti%20international%20whos%20who&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Psychology Press |page=1005 |isbn=9781857432176 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He would not see Hungary again for fourteen years, when he was invited there to judge a competition in Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 250.&lt;/ref&gt; On his rushed escape to Vienna, he left most of his Hungarian compositions in Budapest, some of which are now lost. He took only what he considered to be his most important pieces. He later said, "I considered my old music of no interest. I believed in [[twelve-tone]] music!"&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually took Austrian citizenship in 1968.&lt;ref name="Steinitz 2003, 70–73"/&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F004566-0002, Darmstadt, Internationaler Kurs für neue Musik.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] lecturing at the [[Internationale Ferienkurse für Neue Musik|Internationale Ferienkurse für neue Musik]] in [[Darmstadt]], July 1957]]

A few weeks after arriving in Vienna, Ligeti left for Cologne. There he met several key [[avant-garde]] figures and learned more contemporary musical styles and methods.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; These people included the composers [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] and [[Gottfried Michael Koenig]], both then working on groundbreaking [[electronic music]]. During the summer, he attended the [[Internationale Ferienkurse für Neue Musik]] in [[Darmstadt]]. Ligeti worked in the [[Studio for Electronic Music (WDR)|Cologne Electronic Music Studio]] with Stockhausen and Koenig and was inspired by the sounds he heard there. However, he produced little electronic music of his own, instead concentrating on instrumental works which often contain electronic-sounding [[texture (music)|textures]].

After about three years' working with them, he fell out with the [[Cologne School (music)|Cologne School]],{{Clarify|date=January 2016}}&lt;!--The linked article says this group of composers and performers came to prominence only in the mid-1970s; on the other hand it says that Ligeti was working not with them, but with Stockhausen and Koenig.--&gt; this being too dogmatic{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;!--The quotation from Ligeti does not mention dogmatism.--&gt; and involving much factional in-fighting: "there were {{sic}} a lot of political fighting because different people, like Stockhausen, like Kagel wanted to be first. And I, personally, have no ambition to be first or to be important."&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

Between 1961 and 1971 he was guest professor for composition in Stockholm. In 1972 he became composer-in-residence at [[Stanford University]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gyorgy-ligeti.com/home.php?page=biography,7,1,00,141,00,00,1,47 | title=Biography | accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 Ligeti became professor of composition at the [[Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg|Hamburg Hochschule für Musik und Theater]], eventually retiring in 1989. While he was living in Hamburg, his wife Vera remained in Vienna with their son, [[Lukas Ligeti|Lukas]], who later also became a composer.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

Invited by [[Walter Fink]], Ligeti was the first composer featured in the annual [[Rheingau Musik Festival#Portraits of living composers|Komponistenporträt]] of the [[Rheingau Musik Festival]] in 1990.&lt;ref name="munchner"&gt;Anon. n.d.(b)&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from his far-reaching interest in different styles of music, from Renaissance to African music, Ligeti was also interested in literature (including the writers [[Lewis Carroll]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], and [[Franz Kafka]]), painting, architecture, science, and mathematics. He was especially fascinated by the [[fractal|fractal geometry]] of [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] and the writings of [[Douglas Hofstadter]].&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Ligeti.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Ligeti's grave in [[Vienna Central Cemetery]], Vienna]]
Ligeti's health deteriorated after the turn of the millennium; he died in Vienna on 12 June 2006 at the age of 83.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Paul Griffiths (writer)|Paul Griffiths]]|title=Gyorgy Ligeti, Central-European Composer of Bleakness and Humor, Dies at 83|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/13/arts/music/13ligeti.html?pagewanted=all|quote=Gyorgy Ligeti, the Central European composer whose music was among the most innovative of the last half of the 20th century — sometimes eerie, sometimes humorous usually fantastical and always polished — died yesterday in Vienna. He was 83. His family confirmed his death but declined to divulge the cause, saying only that he had been ill for several years.|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 13, 2006|accessdate=2015-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was known that he had been ill for several years and had used a wheelchair for the last three years of his life, his family declined to release details of his cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrian Chancellor [[Wolfgang Schüssel]] and Art Secretary {{ill|Franz Morak|de}} both paid tribute to Ligeti. His funeral was held at the Vienna Crematorium at the [[Vienna Central Cemetery]], with the Republic of Austria and the Republic of Hungary represented by their respective cultural affairs ministers. The ashes were buried at the cemetery in a grave dedicated to him by the City of Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.n-tv.de/archiv/Gyoergy-Ligeti-ist-tot-article185683.html |title=György Ligety ist tot; Ehrengrab in Wien |accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was survived by his wife Vera and son [[Lukas Ligeti|Lukas]].&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; The latter is a composer and percussionist based in the United States.

==Music==
{{See also|List of compositions by György Ligeti}}

===Compositions in Hungary===
Many of Ligeti's earliest works were written for chorus and included settings of folk songs. His largest work in this period was a graduation composition for the [[Budapest Academy of Music|Budapest Academy]], entitled ''Cantata for Youth Festival'', for four vocal soloists, chorus and orchestra. One of his earliest pieces now in the repertoire is his [[Sonata for Solo Cello (Ligeti)|''Cello Sonata'']], a work in two contrasting movements that were written in 1948 and 1953, respectively. It was initially banned by the Soviet-run [[Composer's Union]] and was not performed publicly for a quarter of a century.&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ligeti's earliest works are often an extension of the musical language of [[Béla Bartók]]. Even his piano cycle ''[[Musica ricercata]]'' (1953), though written according to Ligeti with a "Cartesian" approach, in which he "regarded all the music I knew and loved as being... irrelevant",&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 54.&lt;/ref&gt; the piece has been described by one biographer as from a world very close to Bartók's set of piano works, ''[[Mikrokosmos (Bartók)|Mikrokosmos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Toop 1999, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Ligeti's set comprises eleven pieces in all. The work is based on a simple restriction: the first piece uses exclusively one pitch A, heard in multiple [[octave]]s, and only at the very end of the piece is a second note, D, heard. The second piece uses three notes (E{{music|sharp}}, F{{music|sharp}}, and G), the third piece uses four, and so on, so that in the final piece all twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]] are present.

Shortly after its composition, Ligeti arranged six of the movements of ''Musica ricercata'' for [[wind quintet]] under the title 'Six Bagatelles for Wind Quintet'. The Bagatelles were performed first in 1956, but not in their entirety: the last movement was censored by the Soviets for being too 'dangerous'.&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of Soviet censorship, his most daring works from this period, including ''Musica ricercata'' and his [[String Quartet No. 1 (Ligeti)|String Quartet No. 1 ''Métamorphoses nocturnes'']] (1953–1954), were written for the 'bottom drawer'. Composed of a single movement divided into seventeen contrasting sections linked [[Motif (music)|motivically]],&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 63–64&lt;/ref&gt; the First String Quartet is Ligeti's first work to suggest a personal style of composition. The string quartet was not performed until 1958, after he had fled Hungary for Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon arriving in Cologne, Ligeti began to write electronic music alongside [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] and [[Gottfried Michael Koenig]] at the electronic studio of [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|West German Radio (WDR)]]. He completed only two works in this medium, however—the pieces ''Glissandi'' (1957) and ''[[Artikulation (Ligeti)|Artikulation]]'' (1958)—before returning to instrumental music. A third work, originally entitled ''Atmosphères'' but later known as ''Pièce électronique Nr. 3'', was planned, but the technical limitations of the time prevented Ligeti from realizing it completely. It was finally realised in 1996 by the Dutch composers Kees Tazelaar and Johan van Kreij of the [[Institute of Sonology]].&lt;ref&gt;Iverson 2009, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ligeti's music appears to have been subsequently influenced by his electronic experiments, and many of the sounds he created resembled electronic [[texture (music)|textures]]. Ligeti coined the term "[[micropolyphony]]" to describe the texture of the second movement of ''Apparitions'' (1958–59) and ''[[Atmosphères]]'' (1961). This texture is a similar to that of [[polyphony]], except that the polyphony is obscured in a dense and rich stack of pitches.&lt;ref name="micropolyphony"&gt;Jones n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; Micropolyphony can be used to create the nearly static but slowly evolving works such as ''Atmosphères'' in which the individual instruments become hidden in a complex web of sound. According to Ligeti, after ''Apparitions'' and ''Atmosphères'', he "became famous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ronsen.org/monkminkpinkpunk/9/gl4.html |title=A Budapest Interview with Gyorgy Ligeti |author=Istvan Szigeti |date=July 29, 1983 |work= |publisher=First published in New Hungarian Quarterly |accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With ''Volumina'' (1961–62, revised 1966) for solo organ, Ligeti continued with [[Tone cluster|clusters of notes]], translated into blocks of sound. In this piece, Ligeti abandoned conventional music notation, instead using diagrams to represent general pitch areas, duration, and flurries of notes.&lt;ref name="volumina"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/composition/volumina-for-organ-mc0002406515 | title=Volumina, for organ | publisher=allmusic.com | accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Aventures'' (1962), like its companion piece ''Nouvelles Aventures'' (1962–65), is a composition for three singers and instrumental septet, to a text (of Ligeti's own devising) that is without semantic meaning. In these pieces, each singer has five roles to play, exploring five areas of emotion, and they switch from one to the other so quickly and abruptly that all five areas are present throughout the piece.&lt;ref&gt;Plaistow n.d., 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Requiem'' (1963–65) is a work for soprano and mezzo-soprano soloists, twenty-part chorus (four each of soprano, mezzo-soprano, alto, tenor, and bass), and orchestra. Though, at about half an hour, it is the longest piece he had composed up to that point,&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Ligeti sets only about half of the [[Requiem]]'s traditional text: the "[[Introit]]us", the "[[Kyrie]]" (a completely [[chromatic]] quasi-[[fugue]], where the parts are a montage of [[melismatic]], skipping micropolyphony), and the "[[Dies irae]]"—dividing the latter sequence into two parts, "De die judicii" and "[[Lacrimosa (Requiem)|Lacrimosa]]".

''[[Lux Aeterna (Ligeti)|Lux Aeterna]]'' (1966) is a 16-voice ''a cappella'' piece whose text is also associated with the Latin Requiem.

Ligeti's Cello Concerto (1966), which is dedicated to [[Siegfried Palm]], is composed of two movements: the first begins with an almost imperceptible cello which slowly shifts into static tone clusters with the orchestra before reaching a crescendo and slowly decaying, while the second is a virtuoso piece of dynamic atonal melody on the part of the cello.&lt;ref name="celloconcerto"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/composition/cello-concerto-mc0002384607 | title=György Ligeti Cello Concerto | accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lontano'' (1967), for full orchestra, is another example of micropolyphony, but the overall effect is closer to harmony, with complex woven textures and opacity of the sound giving rise to a harmonious effect. It has become a standard repertoire piece.&lt;ref name="lontano"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.schott-music.com/shop/9/show,175056.html | title=Schott Music – Shop – György Ligeti – Lontano | accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[String Quartet No. 2 (Ligeti)|String Quartet No. 2]] (1968) consists of five movements. They differ widely from each other in their types of motion. In the first, the structure is largely broken up, as in ''Aventures''. In the second, everything is reduced to very slow motion, and the music seems to be coming from a distance, with great lyricism. The ''[[pizzicato]]'' third movement is a machine-like studies, hard and mechanical, whereby the parts playing repeated notes create a "granulated" continuum. In the fourth, which is fast and threatening, everything that happened before is crammed together. Lastly, in strong contrast, the fifth movement spreads itself out. In each movement, the same basic configurations return, but each time their colouring or viewpoint is different, so that the overall form only really emerges when one listens to all five movements in context.&lt;ref name="Stephen Plaistow p. 3"&gt;Plaistow n.d., 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Ramifications (Ligeti)|Ramifications]]'' (1968–69), completed a year before the Chamber Concerto, is scored for an ensemble of strings in twelve parts—seven violins, two violas, two cellos and a double bass—each of which may be taken by one player or several. The twelve are divided into two numerically equal groups but with the instruments in the first group tuned approximately a quarter-tone higher (four violins, a viola and a cello). As the group play, the one tuned higher inevitably tends to slide down toward the other, and both get nearer each other in pitch.&lt;ref name="Stephen Plaistow p. 3"/&gt;

In the ''Chamber Concerto'' (1969–70), several layers, processes and kinds of movement can take place on different planes simultaneously. In spite of frequent markings of "senza tempo", the instrumentalists are not given linear freedom; Ligeti insists on keeping his texture under strict control at any given moment. The form is like a "precision mechanism". Ligeti was always fascinated by machines that do not work properly and by the world of technology and automation. The use of periodic mechanical noises, suggesting not-quite-reliable machinery, occurs in many of his works. The scoring is for flute (doubling piccolo), oboe (doubling oboe d'amore and cor anglais), clarinet, bass clarinet (doubling second clarinet), horn, trombone, harpsichord (doubling Hammond organ), piano (doubling celesta), and solo string quintet.&lt;ref&gt;Plaistow n.d., 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these compositions establish timbre, rather than the traditionally-favored dimensions of pitch and rhythm, as their principal formal parameter, a practice that has come to be known as [[sonorism]].&lt;ref&gt;Schell 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s, Ligeti turned away from sonorism and began to concentrate on rhythm. Pieces such as ''[[Continuum (Ligeti)|Continuum]]'' (1968) and ''Clocks and Clouds'' (1972–73) were written before he heard the music of [[Steve Reich]] and [[Terry Riley]] in 1972. But the second of his ''Three Pieces for Two Pianos'' (1976), entitled "Self-portrait with Reich and Riley (and Chopin in the background)", commemorates this affirmation and influence. During the 1970s, he also became interested in the [[polyphonic]] pipe music of the [[Banda people|Banda]]-Linda tribe from the [[Central African Republic]], which he heard through the recordings of one of his students.&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 271–72.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Le-grand-macabre.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Scene from ''[[Le Grand Macabre]]'' from a production at the [[Gran Teatre del Liceu]] in 2009]]
In 1977, Ligeti completed his only opera, ''[[Le Grand Macabre]]'', thirteen years after its initial commission. Loosely based on [[Michel de Ghelderode]]'s 1934 play, ''La balade du grand macabre'', it is a work of [[Absurd theatre]]—Ligeti called it an "anti-anti-opera"—in which [[Death (personification)|Death]] (Nekrotzar) arrives in the fictional city of Breughelland and announces that the end of the world will occur at midnight. Musically, ''Le Grand Macabre'' draws on techniques not associated with Ligeti's previous work, including [[quotation]]s and pseudo-quotations of other works&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 230.&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of consonant thirds and sixths.

After ''Le Grand Macabre'', Ligeti would abandon the use of [[pastiche]],&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 244.&lt;/ref&gt; but would increasingly incorporate consonant harmonies (even [[major triad|major]] and [[minor triad]]s) into his work, albeit not in a [[diatonic]] context.

===After ''Le Grand Macabre''===
[[File:Michael Daugherty et al at ISCM World Music Days 1982.jpg|thumb|right|280px|From left to right: György Ligeti, [[Lukas Ligeti]], Vera Ligeti, [[Conlon Nancarrow]], and [[Michael Daugherty]] at the [[ISCM]] World Music Days in [[Graz]], Austria, 1982]]

After ''Le Grand Macabre'', Ligeti struggled for some time to find a new style. Besides two short pieces for [[harpsichord]], he did not complete another major work until the [[Trio for Violin, Horn and Piano (Ligeti)|Trio for Violin, Horn and Piano]] in 1982, over four years after the opera. His music of the 1980s and 1990s continued to emphasise complex mechanical rhythms, often in a less densely chromatic idiom, tending to favour displaced major and minor triads and [[polytonality|polymodal]] structures. During this time, Ligeti also began to explore alternate tuning systems through the use of natural [[harmonic]]s for horns (as in the Horn Trio and [[Piano Concerto (Ligeti)|Piano Concerto]]) and [[scordatura]] for strings (as in the [[Violin Concerto (Ligeti)|Violin Concerto]]). Additionally, most of his works in this period are multi-movement works, rather than the extended single movements of ''Atmosphères'' and ''San Francisco Polyphony''.

From 1985 to 2001, Ligeti completed three books of [[Études (Ligeti)|Études]] for piano (Book I, 1985; Book II, 1988–94; Book III, 1995–2001). Comprising eighteen compositions in all, the Études draw from a diverse range of sources, including [[gamelan]],&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 1992, {{Page needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;!--The single word "gamelan" cannot possibly be spread over the entire article.--&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chen 2007, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnowitt 2009"&gt;Arnowitt [2009].&lt;/ref&gt; African [[polyrhythm]]s, Béla Bartók, [[Conlon Nancarrow]], [[Thelonious Monk]],&lt;ref name="Arnowitt 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 292&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bill Evans]]. Book I was written as preparation for the Piano Concerto, which contains a number of similar [[Motif (music)|motivic]] and melodic elements. Ligeti’s music from the last two decades of his life is unmistakable for its rhythmic complexity. Writing about his first book of Piano Études, the composer claims this rhythmic complexity stems from two vastly different sources of inspiration: the Romantic-era piano music of [[Chopin]] and [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] and the [[Rhythm in Sub-Saharan Africa|indigenous music of sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 2003, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between the earlier and later pieces lies in a new conception of [[pulse (music)|pulse]]. In the earlier works, the pulse is something to be divided into two, three and so on. The effect of these different subdivisions, especially when they occur simultaneously, is to blur the aural landscape, creating the micropolyphonic effect of Ligeti’s music.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 2003, 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the later music—and a few earlier pieces such as ''[[Continuum (Ligeti)|Continuum]]''—treats the pulse as a musical atom, a common denominator, a basic unit, which cannot be divided further. Different rhythms appear through multiplications of the basic pulse, rather than divisions: this is the principle of African music seized on by Ligeti. It also appears in the music of [[Philip Glass]], [[Steve Reich]] and others; and significantly it shares much in common with the [[additive rhythm]]s of [[Balkan music|Balkan folk music]], the music of Ligeti’s youth.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 2003, 87.&lt;/ref&gt; He described the music of Conlon Nancarrow, with its extremely complex explorations of polyrhythmic complexity, as "the greatest discovery since [[Anton Webern|Webern]] and [[Charles Ives|Ives]]... something great and important for all music history! His music is so utterly original, enjoyable, perfectly constructed, but at the same time emotional... for me it's the best music of any composer living today."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Kyle Gann. ''The Music of Conlon Nancarrow'', p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Ligeti completed his Piano Concerto, writing that "I present my artistic credo in the ''Piano Concerto'': I demonstrate my independence from criteria of the traditional [[Avant-garde music|avantgarde]], as well as the fashionable [[Postmodern music|postmodernism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.schott-music.com/shop/konzert-no153614.html|title=Concerto for Piano and Orchestra|last=|first=|date=|website=Schott music|language=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial sketches of the Concerto began in 1980, but it was not until 1985 that he found a way forward and the work proceeded more quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 315–16&lt;/ref&gt; The Concerto explores many of the ideas worked out in the Études but in an orchestral context.

In 1993, Ligeti completed his [[Violin Concerto (Ligeti)|Violin Concerto]] after four years of work. Like the Piano Concerto, the Violin Concerto uses the wide range of techniques he had developed up until that point as well as the new ideas he was working out at the moment. Among other techniques, it uses a passacaglia,&lt;ref&gt;Schell 2018&lt;/ref&gt; "[[microtonality]], rapidly changing [[texture (music)|textures]], comic juxtapositions... [[Hungarian folk music|Hungarian folk melodies]], [[Bulgarian dances|Bulgarian dance rhythms]], references to [[Medieval music|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance music]] and solo violin writing that ranges from the slow-paced and sweet-toned to the angular and fiery."&lt;ref&gt;Kozinn 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable works from this period are the [[Viola Sonata (Ligeti)|Viola Sonata]] (1994) and the ''Nonsense Madrigals'' (1988–93), a set of six [[a cappella]] compositions that set English texts from [[William Brighty Rands]], [[Lewis Carroll]], and [[Heinrich Hoffman]]. The third Madrigal is a setting of the English [[alphabet]].

Ligeti's last works were the ''[[Hamburg Concerto]]'' for solo horn, four [[natural horn]]s and chamber orchestra (1998–99, revised 2003, dedicated to [[Marie Luise Neunecker]]), the [[song cycle]] ''[[Síppal, dobbal, nádihegedüvel]]'' ("With Pipes, Drums, Fiddles", 2000), and the eighteenth piano étude "Canon" (2001). Additionally, after ''Le Grand Macabre'', Ligeti planned to write a second opera, first to be based on [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]'' and later on Carroll's ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', but neither came to fruition.

===Music in the films of Stanley Kubrick===
{{Listen|image=none|filename=|title="Star Gate" sequence|alt=|description=Part of the "Star Gate" sequence from ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''}}Ligeti's music is best known to the general public for its use in three films of [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s, which gained him a world-wide audience.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; The [[2001: A Space Odyssey (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' includes excerpts from four of his pieces: ''[[Atmosphères]]'', ''[[Lux Aeterna (Ligeti)|''Lux Aeterna'']]'', ''Requiem'' and ''Aventures''.&lt;ref name="Allmusic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/2001-a-space-odyssey-r241365|title=Album at Allmusic|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Atmosphères'' is heard during the "Star Gate" sequence, with portions also heard in the Overture and Intermission. ''Lux Aeterna'' is heard in the moon-bus scene en route to the Tycho monolith. The ''Kyrie'' sequence of his ''Requiem'' is heard over the first three monolith encounters. An electronically altered version of ''Aventures'', unlisted in the film credits, is heard in the cryptic final scenes. The music was used, and in some cases modified, without Ligeti's knowledge, and without full [[copyright]] clearance. When he learned about the use of his music in the film, he "successfully sued for having had his music distorted",&lt;ref&gt;Agel 1970, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; but [[settled out of court]]. Kubrick in return sought permission and compensated Ligeti for use of his music in later films.&lt;ref name="ld-oflss"&gt;Crilly 2011, 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lux Aeterna'' was used again in [[Peter Hyams]]'s 1984 sequel to ''2001'', ''[[2010 (film)|2010]]''.&lt;ref name="allegro-c.de" /&gt;

A later Kubrick film, ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', uses small portions of ''Lontano'' for orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;Crilly 2011, 245n2.&lt;/ref&gt;

One motif from the second movement of Ligeti's ''Musica ricercata'' is used at pivotal moments in Kubrick's ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Powrie and Stilwell 2006, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; At the German premiere of that film, by which time Kubrick had died, his widow was escorted by Ligeti himself.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Platt, [http://www.newyorker.com/culture/goings-on/clarke-kubrick-and-ligeti-a-tale "Clarke, Kubrick and Ligeti: A Tale"].

===Music in other films and media===

Ligeti is also known to the public through the use of his music in other films by other directors. ''Lontano'' was also used in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s 2010 psychological thriller film ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/shutter-island-music-from-the-motion-picture-mw0001767560 |title=Original Soundtrack: Shutter Island [Music from the Motion Picture] |publisher=allmusic.com |year=2013 |accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first movement of the Cello Concerto was used in the [[Michael Mann]] 1995 crime film ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]''.&lt;ref name="allegro-c.de"&gt;Anon. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Requiem'' was used in the 2014 film [[Godzilla (2014 film)|''Godzilla'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/movie/godzilla-2014/|title=''Godzilla'' (2014) – Soundtrack.net|date=12 May 2014|accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cello Concerto and the Piano Concerto were used in [[Yorgos Lanthimos]]' 2017 film ''[[The Killing of a Sacred Deer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.soundtrack.net/album/the-killing-of-a-sacred-deer/|title=''The Killing of a Sacred Deer'' (2017) – Soundtrack.net|date=20 October 2017|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-killing-of-a-sacred-deer-mw0003111192|title=The Killing of a Sacred Deer - Original Soundtrack - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His music has also been used in television and radio. ''Lontano'', ''Atmosphères'', and the first movement of the Cello Concerto were used in [[Sophie Fiennes]]'s documentary ''[[Over Your Cities Grass Will Grow]]'', about the German post-war artist [[Anselm Kiefer]].&lt;ref name="overyourcities"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/13/over-your-cities-grass-review | title=Over Your Cities Grass Will Grow – review | publisher=The Guardian | date=13 October 2010 | accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lontano'', ''Melodien'', and ''Volumina'' were used in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the First|Fit the First]], [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Fifth|Fit the Fifth]], and {{H2G2|radio|6|link=yes}} of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' as background music to sections of narrative from the Guide.&lt;ref name="scripts"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Original Radio Script|author=Adams, Douglas|isbn=0-330-29288-9|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3236">'''Inter-American Literature''' involves the comparative study of authors and texts from all the Americas:  North, South and Central, including the Caribbean.  This all-inclusive scope—Canada, the United States, [[Ibero-America|Spanish America]], Brazil, smaller Anglophone and Francophone countries, and Native America—covers the principal languages of the extreme Western Hemisphere—English, Spanish, Portuguese, French—as well as, in some cases, indigenous languages.

The method can have a broad focus, as in studies of [[race relations]] in the Americas or the literary representation of the Native American, or it can focus more narrowly on issues of influence and reception that link specific authors and texts. For example, certain novels by Brazil’s [[Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis|Machado de Assis]] influenced John Barth’s ''The Floating Opera'', and Faulkner influenced a number of writers from Spanish America, including [[Gabriel García Márquez]] and [[Mario Vargas Llosa]].

Inter-American Literature can also deal with the development of certain literary forms, such as the immigrant novel or the New-World [[Epic poetry|epic poem]], or with literary periods and movements, such as the colonial period, the nineteenth-century, or [[Modernism]] in the Americas.

Ideally, every Inter-American Literature project should involve at least two of the New World’s languages and literatures, as, for instance, in a study of the “New Novel” form in Canada, the United States, Peru, and Brazil during the 1960s.

As in [[Cross-cultural studies|comparative studies]] generally, inter-American literary scholarship should work, as often as possible, with texts written in their original languages and should seek to identify those similarities (of theme, form, or period) that tie the literatures of the Americas together while also recognizing and maintaining the very important differences (of history, style, and culture) that distinguish them and that make them separate works of art.

At present, Inter-American Literature is mostly dominated by U.S. scholars. The fact that the U.S. has become the prime locus of production of Inter-American studies poses several problems, the most important of which is that the field betrays its own raison-d'etre. The field cannot be truly inter-American when most American countries are relegated to the position of object of study.

VanderMeer has been called "one of the most remarkable practitioners of the literary fantastic in America today,"&lt;ref name=Gale&gt;"Jeff VanderMeer entry, Contemporary Authors Online, 2016," Gale Biography in Context, accessed Sept. 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; with ''[[The New Yorker]]'' naming him the "King of Weird Fiction."&lt;ref name=NewYorker2&gt;"[http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/weird-thoreau-jeff-vandermeer-southern-reach The Weird Thoreau]" by Joshua Rothman, The New Yorker, January 14, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; VanderMeer's fiction is noted for eluding genre classifications&lt;ref name=PW1&gt;"[https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-374-11524-1 Starred review of Borne by Jeff VanderMeer,]" Publisher's Weekly, February 06, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; even as his works bring in themes and elements from genres such as [[Postmodern literature|postmodernism]],&lt;ref name=PW3&gt;"Review of City of Saints and Madmen by Jeff VanderMeer," Publisher's Weekly, May 06, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[ecofiction]],&lt;ref name=NYTBR&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/05/books/review/borne-jeff-vandermeer.html There’s No Escape From Contamination Above the Toxic Sea]" by Wai Chee Dimockmay, The New York Times Book Review, May 5, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[New Weird]] and [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic fiction]].&lt;ref name=NewYorker1&gt;"[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/24/jeff-vandermeer-amends-the-apocalypse Jeff VanderMeer Amends the Apocalypse]" by Laura Miller, The New Yorker, April 24, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

VanderMeer's writing has been described as "evocative" and containing "intellectual observations both profound and disturbing,"&lt;ref name=PW2&gt;"[https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-374-10409-2 Starred review of Annihilation by Jeff Vandermeer]," Publisher's Weekly, December 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been compared with the works of [[Jorge Luis Borges]],&lt;ref name=PW2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Borges&gt;"[https://www.believermag.com/issues/200609/?read=review_vandermeer SHRIEK: AN AFTERWORD BY JEFF VANDERMEER]," Believermag.com, Sept. 2006, accessed June 26, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franz Kafka]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]].&lt;ref name=NewYorker2/&gt;

== Personal life ==

VanderMeer was born in [[Bellefonte, Pennsylvania]] in 1968, and spent much of his childhood in the [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]], where his parents worked for the [[Peace Corps]].&lt;ref name=LocusInterview&gt;"[http://www.locusmag.com/Perspectives/2014/07/jeff-vandermeer-south-of-reality/ Jeff VanderMeer: South of Reality,]" Locus Magazine, July 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to the United States, he spent time in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], New York, and [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]], Florida. He attended the [[University of Florida]] for three years and, in 1992, took part in the [[Clarion Writers Workshop]].&lt;ref name=LocusInterview/&gt;

When VanderMeer was 20, he read [[Angela Carter]]'s novel ''[[The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman]]'', which he has said "blew the back of my head off, rewired my brain: I had never encountered prose like that before, never such passion and boldness on the page."&lt;ref name=Atlantic1&gt;"[https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/04/the-invention-of-angela-carter-review/523326/ The Thrill and Pain of Inventing Angela Carter]" by Jeff VanderMeer, The Atlantic, April 20, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Carter's fiction inspired VanderMeer to both improve and be fearless with his own writing.&lt;ref name=Atlantic1/&gt;

In 2003, VanderMeer married [[Ann VanderMeer|Ann Kennedy]], then editor for the small Buzzcity Press and magazine the ''Silver Web''. {{As of|2018|alt=The couple lives in [[Tallahassee, Florida]].}} They have two cats.&lt;ref name="Tallahassee Democrat staff 2017"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tallahassee Democrat staff|title=Meet Author Jeff VanderMeer|url=https://www.tallahassee.com/insider/events/2017/05/08/meet-author-jeff-vandermeer/101438014/|work=[[Tallahassee Democrat]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=8 May 2017|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One is named Neo.&lt;ref name="Harvilla 2017"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvilla|first=Robert|title=The Darkest (and Coolest) Timeline of Jeff VanderMeer|url=https://www.theringer.com/2017/5/30/16040198/jeff-vandermeer-new-book-borne-95e6ac07bea1|work=[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]]|publisher=SBNation.com|date=30 May 2017|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tallahassee Democrat staff 2017" /&gt;

== Writing ==

=== Early career ===

VanderMeer began writing in the late 1980s while still in high school and quickly became a prolific contributor to small-press magazines.&lt;ref name=StJames&gt;St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost &amp; Gothic Writers by David Pringle, St. James Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time VanderMeer wrote a number of [[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] short stories, some of which were collected in his 1989 self-published book ''The Book of Frog'' and in the 1996 collection ''The Book of Lost Places''.&lt;ref name=StJames/&gt; He also wrote poetry—his poem "Flight Is for Those Who Have Not Yet Crossed Over" was a co-winner of the 1994 [[Rhysling Award]]—and edited two issues of the self-published [[zine]] ''Jabberwocky''.&lt;ref name=StJames/&gt;&lt;ref name=LocusInterview/&gt;

One of VanderMeer's early successes was his 2001 short-story collection ''[[City of Saints and Madmen]],'' set in the imaginary city of Ambergris. Several of VanderMeer's novels were subsequently set in the same place, including ''[[Shriek: An Afterword]]'' (2006) and ''[[Finch (novel)|Finch]]'' (2009), the latter of which was a finalist for the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfwa.org/2010/02/2009-nebula-awards-final-ballot/|title=2009 Nebula Awards Final Ballot – SFWA|work=SFWA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, his novella ''The Transformation of Martin Lake'' won the [[World Fantasy Award—Long Fiction|World Fantasy Award]].

VanderMeer has also worked in other media, including on a movie based on his novel ''Shriek'' that featured an original soundtrack by rock band [[The Church (band)|The Church]]. The band [[Murder By Death (band)|Murder By Death]] likewise recorded a soundtrack for ''[[Finch (Murder By Death album)|Finch]]'', which was released alongside a limited edition of the book. VanderMeer also wrote a ''[[Predator (novel series)|Predator]]'' tie-in novel for ''[[Dark Horse Comics]]'' called ''Predator: South China Seas'' and worked with animator [[Joel Veitch]] on a Play Station Europe animation of his story "A New Face in Hell".

=== The Southern Reach Trilogy ===
{{Main|Southern Reach Trilogy}}

In 2014, [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] published VanderMeer's [[Southern Reach Trilogy]], consisting of the novels ''[[Annihilation (VanderMeer novel)|Annihilation]], [[Authority (novel)|Authority]],'' and ''[[Acceptance (novel)|Acceptance]]''. The story focuses on a secret agency that manages expeditions into a location known as Area X. The area is an uninhabited and abandoned part of the United States that nature has begun to reclaim after a mysterious world-changing event.&lt;ref name="IS inspired"&gt;{{cite web|first=Ian |last= Spiegelman| date= 28 February 2014 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2014/02/28/jeff-vandermeer-annihilation/5902023/ |title=Jeff VanderMeer: 'Power of Nature' Inspired New Sci-Fi Novel 'Annihilation' |newspaper= [[USA Today]] |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VanderMeer has said that the main inspiration for Area X and the series was his hike through [[St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schardl|first1=Kati|title=Exploring ‘Area X’: Local author has hit with book series based on St. Marks Wildlife Refuge|url=http://www.tallahassee.com/story/life/2014/03/29/exploring-area-x-local-author-has-hit-with-book-series-based-on-st-marks-wildlife-refuge/7055811/|work= Tallahassee Democrat| publisher= Gannett | accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Other Side of the Mountain'' by [[Michel Bernanos]] is among the books VanderMeer has cited as also having had an influence.&lt;ref name="IS inspired" /&gt;

The trilogy was released in quick succession over an 8-month period, in what has been called an innovative "[[Netflix]]-inspired strategy."&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;"[http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-ca-jc-mcd-imprint-20170728-story.html The boundary-pushing fiction of Sean McDonald and his new FSG imprint, MCD,]" by Margaret Wappler, The Los Angeles Times, July 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The strategy helped the second and third books reach the [[New York Times Bestseller list|''New York Times'' Bestseller list]], and established VanderMeer as "one of the most forward-thinking authors of the decade."&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 25, 2014 |title=Paperback Trade Fiction |url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2014-05-25/trade-fiction-paperback/list.html?date=2014-05-25&amp;category=trade-fiction-paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Best Sellers – Paperback Trade Fiction |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 25, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2014-09-21/trade-fiction-paperback/list.html|accessdate=September 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series ended up being highly honored, with ''Annihilation'' winning the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel|Nebula]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; and [[Shirley Jackson Award|Shirley Jackson]] Awards for Best Novel.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; The entire trilogy was also named a finalist for the 2015 [[World Fantasy Award—Novel|World Fantasy Award]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.locusmag.com/News/2015/11/world-fantasy-awards-winners-2015/ World Fantasy Awards Winners 2015]," Locus Magazine, November 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2016 [[Kurd-Laßwitz-Preis]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://file770.com/?p=28642 2016 Kurd Laßwitz Preis Nominees,]" File 770, April 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Annihilation'' was also adapted into [[Annihilation (film)|a film of the same name]] by writer-director [[Alex Garland]].&lt;ref name="variety.com"/&gt; The film stars [[Natalie Portman]], [[Gina Rodriguez]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alex Garland Sets Natalie Portman and Frances McDormand for ‘Annihilation’; Neill Blomkamp Lines Up Next Project|url=http://thefilmstage.com/news/alex-garland-sets-natalie-portman-and-frances-mcdormand-for-annihilation-neill-blomkamp-lines-up-next-project/|work=thefilmstage.com|date=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tessa Thompson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sneider|first1=Jeff|title='Creed's' Tessa Thompson Eyed to Join Natalie Portman, Gina Rodriguez in 'Annihilation' (Exclusive)|url=http://www.thewrap.com/creeds-tessa-thompson-eyed-to-join-natalie-portman-gina-rodriguez-in-annihilation-exclusive/|accessdate=January 5, 2016|work=TheWrap|date=January 4, 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://collider.com/jennifer-jason-leigh-annihilation-movie/|title=Jennifer Jason Leigh Up for Ex Machina Director's Annihilation|date=February 10, 2016|website=Collider|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Oscar Isaac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/annihilation/39553/annihilation-oscar-isaac-joins-alex-garland-s-new-film|title=Annihilation: Oscar Isaac joins Alex Garland’s new film|website=Den of Geek|access-date=May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent work ===

In 2017 VanderMeer released ''[[Borne (novel)|Borne]],'' a "biotech apocalypse" novel&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/15/borne-by-jeff-vandermeer-review Borne by Jeff VanderMeer review – after the biotech apocalypse]" by Neel Mukherjee, The Guardian, June 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; about a scavenger named Rachel trying to survive both a city "plunged into a primordial realm of myth, fable, and fairy tale"&lt;ref name=NewYorker1/&gt; and a five-story-tall flying bear named Mord. As with the Southern Reach trilogy, the novel was highly praised, with ''[[The Guardian]]'' saying, "VanderMeer’s recent work has been [[Ovid]]ian in its underpinnings, exploring the radical transformation of life forms and the seams between them."&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly|Publisher's Weekly]]'' said the novel reads "like a dispatch from a world lodged somewhere between science fiction, myth, and a video game" and that with ''Borne'' Vandermeer has essentially invented a new literary genre, "weird literature."&lt;ref name=PW1/&gt;

[[Paramount Pictures]] has optioned the film rights to ''Borne''.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://variety.com/2016/film/news/paramount-scott-rudin-borne-jeff-vandermeer-1201893053/ Paramount and Scott Rudin Team on Next Novel From ‘Annihilation’ Author (EXCLUSIVE)]" by Justin Kroll, Variety, October 18, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017 VanderMeer released the novella ''The Strange Bird: A Borne Story''.&lt;ref name=PW4&gt;"[https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/interviews/article/74379-four-questions-for-jeff-vandermeer.html Four Questions for...Jeff VanderMeer]" by John Maher, Publisher's Weekly, August 01, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The stand-alone story is set in the same world as ''Borne'' but features different characters.

VanderMeer's upcoming novels include ''Hummingbird Salamander'', which is set ten seconds into the future and deals with "bioterrorism, ecoterrorism, and climate change," and a [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] series called ''Jonathan Lambshead and the Golden Sphere''.&lt;ref name=PW4/&gt; He's also working on a story called "The Three," based on the dead astronauts mentioned in ''Borne'', along with another Southern Reach story.&lt;ref name=PW4/&gt;

== Critical reputation ==

VanderMeer has been called "one of the most remarkable practitioners of the literary fantastic in America today,"&lt;ref name=Gale/&gt; with ''[[The New Yorker]]'' naming him the "King of Weird Fiction."&lt;ref name=NewYorker2/&gt; VanderMeer's fiction is noted for eluding genre classifications&lt;ref name=PW1/&gt; even as his works bring in themes and elements from genres such as [[Postmodern literature|postmodernism]],&lt;ref name=PW3/&gt; [[ecofiction]],&lt;ref name=NYTBR/&gt; the [[New Weird]] and [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic fiction]].&lt;ref name=NewYorker1/&gt;

VanderMeer's fiction has been described as "evocative (with) intellectual observations both profound and disturbing"&lt;ref name=PW2/&gt; and "lyrical and harrowing,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-ca-jc-borne-vandermeer-20170413-story.html Jeff Vandermeer's new dystopian novel 'Borne' is lyrical and harrowing; Elizabeth Hand reviews]&lt;/ref&gt; with his mixing of genres producing "something unique and unsettling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Brown |authorlink=Eric Brown (writer) |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/18/finch-jeff-vandermeer-ambergris-review |title=Finch by Jeff VanderMeer |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 18, 2010 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

VanderMeer's writing has been compared with the works of [[Jorge Luis Borges]],&lt;ref name=PW2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Borges/&gt; [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], and [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau]].&lt;ref name=NewYorker2/&gt;

== Literary criticism and editing ==
{{BLP sources section|date=February 2018}}
VanderMeer is a frequent writer of critical literary reviews and essays, which have appeared in numerous publications including ''[[The Atlantic]], [[The Washington Post]]'' Book World, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', and other places. For a number of years he was a regular columnist for the Amazon book-culture blog and has served as a judge for the [[Eisner Awards]], among others. He has been a guest speaker at such diverse events as the [[Brisbane Writers Festival]], [[Finncon]] in Helsinki, and the [[American Library Association]] annual conference.

VanderMeer has also edited a number of anthologies. He won a 2003 [[World Fantasy Award—Anthology|World Fantasy Award]] for ''Leviathan, Volume Three'', a collection of genre-bending stories he edited with [[Forrest Aguirre]]. He and Mark Roberts were also finalists for the same award the next year for the anthology ''The Thackery T. Lambshead Pocket Guide to Eccentric &amp; Discredited Diseases''.

Most of his recent anthologies have been collaborations with his wife, [[Ann VanderMeer]], the Hugo-award-winning former editor of ''[[Weird Tales]]''. These anthologies include ''[[The New Weird]]'', a collection of stories from New Weird authors; ''Last Drink Bird Head'', a charity anthology benefiting literacy; ''[[The Weird]]'', a [[World Fantasy Award—Anthology|World Fantasy Award]] winning collection of weird fiction; ''[[Time Traveler's Almanac]]'', an anthology of time-travel fiction; ''Fast Ships, Black Sails'', a pirate fiction anthology; and the [[Locus Award]] winning ''The Big Book of Science Fiction''.&lt;ref name=LocusAward/&gt;

Dick Award]] in 1997.

== Teaching ==

In addition to editing and writing, VanderMeer has also been involved in teaching creative writing. One of the projects he is involved with is Shared Worlds, an annual two-week program that aims to teach creative writing to teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wofford.edu/sharedworlds/ |title=Shared Worlds' 2014 Visiting Writers Announced |date=May 6, 2014 |accessdate=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; VanderMeer has also taught at the [[Clarion Workshop]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Clarion Instructors|url=http://clarion.ucsd.edu/faculty.html|accessdate=May 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at Trinity Prep School.

'''''Jumanji''''' is a 1981 [[fantasy]] [[children's literature|children's]] [[picture book]], written and illustrated by the American author [[Chris Van Allsburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Jill C.|title=Chris Van Allsburg|year=2005|publisher=ABDO Pub. Co.|location=Edina, Minn. |isbn=978-1-59197-721-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=-VG3qYxbCvcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=jumanji+allsburg#v=onepage&amp;q=jumanji&amp;f=false|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made into a [[Jumanji|1995 film of the same name]]. Both the book and the film are about a magical board game that implements real animals and other jungle elements as the game is played; thus the dangers which the players have to overcome in the game also appear in real life. ''Jumanji'' star [[Robin Williams]] said "jumanji" is a [[Zulu language|Zulu]] word meaning "many effects",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Flashes: Name of the Game|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299864,00.html|accessdate=November 18, 2011|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly|date=December 8, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did Van Allsburg.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} In 2011, Williams recorded an audiobook for its 30th edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fictiondb.com/author/chris-van-allsburg~jumanji-30th-anniversary-edition~433680~b.htm|title=Jumanji 30th Anniversary Edition|website=FictionDB|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fritz, a bull terrier in all of [[Chris Van Allsburg]]'s books, appears as a toy dog on wheels in the third illustration.

==Storyline==
While their parents are out for the evening, Judy and Peter Shepherd, after playing with some toys, become bored and decide to go to the park. There they find a jungle adventure game called ''Jumanji''. Taking the game home, they find a warning message; "Do not begin unless you intend to finish". Ignoring the warning, they start to play.

The pair soon discovers that any dangers encountered in the game spring to life somewhere in the house. For example, when Peter rolls on a lion, a real lion appears, which Judy and Peter trap in their mother's bedroom. Continuing on, Judy rolls on a stampede, Peter rolls on a monsoon, and Judy rolls on an explorer—each appears in real life to wreak havoc in the house. Still they continue to play, hoping that by finishing the game everything will go back to normal. The game finally ends when Judy rolls a volcano and yells "Jumanji!".

In an instant everything is back to normal and the siblings quickly return to the park and abandon the game before their parents return. The story ends when Judy and Peter look outside and see their neighbors, Danny and Walter, excitedly returning from the park with ''Jumanji'' in their hands with the knowledge that their mother claims the brothers never bother to finish the games they play nor read the instructions.

==Adaptations==
* ''[[Jumanji]]'', a 1995 film based on the story. Unlike the short story, the film has adult characters that did not appear in the original short story like Alan Parrish ([[Robin Williams]]), Sarah Whittle ([[Bonnie Hunt]]), Officer Carl Bentley ([[David Alan Grier]]), Aunt Nora ([[Bebe Neuwirth]]) and a big-game hunter named Van Pelt ([[Jonathan Hyde]] who also portrayed Alan's father, Sam Parrish). Not only is Alan Parrish the main protagonist instead of Judy ([[Kirsten Dunst]]) and Peter ([[Bradley Pierce]]), but a background story is added, in which the game trapped Alan in the jungle many years earlier while he and Sarah were playing back in 1969. Danny and Walter Budwing from the end of the original book do not appear in the film. Also in the film, Judy and Peter are orphaned after their parents died in a car accident in Canada and their aunt is now their legal guardian. Other changes are that the animals wreak havoc all over town, Peter transforming into a monkey while trying to cheat and Alan ultimately winning the game instead of Judy with everything including time restored back to the way it was before. The drumbeats in the game are also heard far away, which never happened in the book.
* [[Jumanji (TV series)|''Jumanji'' (TV series)]], an animated TV series roughly based on the book and the film, which ran from 1996 to 1999. Unlike the book and film, the game transports Judy and Peter in the jungle after taking turns and reading a clue instead of releasing all of the jungle elements and there are other villains besides Van Pelt. Also, Peter transforms into various animals while trying to cheat in a few episodes and Alan Parrish from the film remains trapped in the game until the final episode and Danny and Walter from the end of the original book are absent.
* ''[[Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle]]'' came out in 2017 and stars [[Dwayne Johnson]], [[Jack Black]], [[Kevin Hart]] and [[Karen Gillan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/2016/08/20/the-rock-says-new-jumanji-is-not-a-reboot/|title=The Rock Says New Jumanji Is Not A Reboot|author=Matthew Mueller |publisher=Comicbook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not a strict sequel, it uses many of the same premises as the 1995 film.

==Sequel==
''[[Zathura]]'' (published in 2002) is a sequel to ''Jumanji'' also written by Van Allsburg. In ''Zathura'', Danny and Walter Budwing from the end of the ''Jumanji'' story, find a science fiction board game that similarly causes the effects of the game to come to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zbaracki |first=Matthew D. |title=Best Books for Boys: A Resource for Educators |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=mVThAAAAMAAJ |publisher=[[Libraries Unlimited]] |year=2008 |page=56 |isbn=9781591585992}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been [[Zathura: A Space Adventure|adapted to film]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kümmerling-Meibauer |first=Bettina |title=The Routledge Companion to Picturebooks |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=jtNBDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT690 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=December 6, 2017 |pages=526 |isbn=9781317526599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tompkins |first=Gail E. |title=Literacy for the 21st Century: Teaching Reading and Writing in Grades 4 Through 8 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=qARKAAAAYAAJ |publisher=Pearson/Merrill/Prentice Hall |year=2003 |page=263 |isbn=9780130986542}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Leypoldt |first=E. |title=The Publishers Weekly |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=2xDDLHfovXAC |volume=54 |issue=44-51 |year=2004 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Owen |first=Lynette |title=Selling Rights |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=8oDZBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA318 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=October 17, 2014 |page=318 |isbn=9781317611813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16649">This is a '''List of [[Amarna letters]] by size''', mostly length X width, and starting with the shortest (in Height). Note: a few Amarna letters are wider than tall, for example [[Amarna letter EA 290|EA 290]].

It should be understood the definition of ''"mayor"'' in the Amarna letters. (The definition of ''King'' is relatively obvious). Some mayors are called the ''"Man Town XXX"''. The obvious description is to call the mayor a [[governor]], (the man who governs, no matter the size of the [[City-state]]; ("governor" means "govern-or"). The power of local governors depended on conflicts, or [[commerce|commerc]]ial local successes, or of course the discourses, including the everpresent [[Habiru]], ([[habiru|'Apiru]]).

A [[fatwa]] ({{lang-ar|فتوى}}), is a legal pronouncement in [[Islam]], issued by a religious law specialist on a specific issue. 
{{Dynamic list}}

== Fatwa against [[Man sa yarbah al malyoon]] ==

In 2001, Egypt's [[Grand Mufti]] issued a fatwa stating that the show "من سيربح المليون؟" (''Man sa yarbah al malyoon?''&amp;nbsp;– literally "Who will Win the Million?"), modelled on the British show [[Who Wants to be a Millionaire?]], was un-Islamic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1457145.stm|title='Millionaire' fatwa rejected|date=2001-07-26|publisher=BBC News|access-date=2010-05-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031106063935/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1457145.stm#|archive-date=2003-11-06|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sheikh of Cairo's [[Al-Azhar University]] later rejected the fatwa, finding that there was no objection to such shows since they spread general knowledge.

==Fatwa regarding theology==
* [[al-Azhar Shia Fatwa]] on July 6, 1959:
:''"The [[Jafari]] [[fiqh]] of the [[Shi'a]] is a school of thought that is religiously correct to follow in worship as are other [[Sunni]] schools of thought."

Many other fatwas have been [[Sunni fatwas on Shias|made by Sunnis]] regarding the Shia.

==The Fatwa against production, stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons==
{{main|Khamenei's fatwa against nuclear weapons}}
It refers to the [[fatwa]] against the acquisition, development and use of [[nuclear weapons]] by [[supreme leader]] of [[Iran]], [[Ali Khamenei]].&lt;ref name="AT"&gt;{{cite web|last=L Afrasiabi|first=Kaveh|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/HC17Ak02.html|title=An Iran option the US prefers to ignore|date=17 March 2006|work=[[Asia Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the fatwa originally dates back to mid-1990s,&lt;ref name="forein policy" /&gt; the first public issue of it is reported to be that of October 2003, which was followed by an official statement at a meeting of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) in [[Vienna]], two years later on August 2005.

The fatwa have received criticisms regarding the existence, applicability and  constancy of it.&lt;ref name="Kessler-7-4-15"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kessler|first1=Glenn|title=Fact Checker Did Iran’s supreme leader issue a fatwa against the development of nuclear weapons?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2013/11/27/did-irans-supreme-leader-issue-a-fatwa-against-the-development-of-nuclear-weapons/|accessdate=7 April 2015|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=November 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403161326/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2013/11/27/did-irans-supreme-leader-issue-a-fatwa-against-the-development-of-nuclear-weapons/#|archive-date=2015-04-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Khalaji"&gt;{{citation|last=Eisenstadt|first=Michael|last2=Khalaji|first2=Mehdi|5=|url=https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/PolicyFocus115.pdf|title=Nuclear Fatwa; Religion and Politics in Iran’s Proliferation Strategy|publisher=[[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]]|date=September 2011|access-date=2015-08-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428003851/http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/PolicyFocus115.pdf#|archive-date=2015-04-28|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Khalaji, Khamenei may alter his fatwa under critical circumstances, in a similar manner as [[Khomeini]] did.&lt;ref name="Khalaji"/&gt; While, according to [[Gareth Porter]] in [[Foreign Policy]], Iran has sincerely banned the atomic bombs considering the "historical episode during its eight-year [[Iran–Iraq War|war with Iraq]]", when Iran never sought revenge for Iraqis chemical attacks killing 20,000 Iranians and severely injuring 100,000 more.&lt;ref name="forein policy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Porter|first=Gareth|authorlink=Gareth Porter|title=When the Ayatollah Said No to Nukes|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/10/16/when-the-ayatollah-said-no-to-nukes/|accessdate=21 August 2015|work=[[Foreign Policy]]|date=16 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921001025/https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/10/16/when-the-ayatollah-said-no-to-nukes/#|archive-date=2017-09-21|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the fatwa is considered consistent with Islamic tradition.&lt;ref name="Khalaji"/&gt;

==Fatwa against illegal hunting and wildlife trade==
In March 2014 the [[Indonesian Council of Ulama]] (Indonesia's highest Islamic clerical body) issued a fatwa against illegal hunting and wildlife trafficking. The fatwa instructed Muslims to protect [[endangered species]] by conserving their habitat and stopping illegal trade. The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] described the fatwa as a positive step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26452346|title=Muslim clerics ban illegal hunting and wildlife trade|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2014-03-05|access-date=2018-06-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806044120/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26452346#|archive-date=2017-08-06|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fatwas against terrorism, Al-Qaeda and ISIS==
[[Islam in Spain|Spanish Muslims]] proclaimed a fatwa against [[Osama Bin Laden]] in March 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturekitchen.com/archives/002868.html |title=Text of the Fatwa Declared Against Osama Bin Laden by the Islamic Commission of Spain |accessdate=2006-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050727013942/http://www.culturekitchen.com/archives/002868.html |archivedate=2005-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; issued by Mansur Escudero Bedate, Secretary General of the [[Islamic Commission of Spain]]. The ruling says that [[Osama bin Laden|Bin Laden]] and "his" [[al-Qaeda]] had [[apostacy|abandoned their religion]] and should thus be called "al-Qaeda terrorists" without using the [[adjective]] "Islamic". The fatwa urges other Muslims to make similar proclamations. They were followed in July 2005 by the [[Fiqh Council of North America]], a ruling council that issued a fatwa against providing support to "terrorist" groups that make up their own rules by unjustifiably referring to Islam (see [[Istihlal]]).

===Fatwa on terrorism===
The [[Fatwa on Terrorism]] is a 600-page Islamic decree against terrorism and suicide bombings released in March 2010. This fatwa is a direct refutation of the ideology of [[Al-Qaeda]] and the [[Taliban]]. It is one of the most extensive rulings, an "absolute" condemnation of terrorism without "any excuses or pretexts" which goes further than ever and declares [[terrorism]] as [[kufr]] under [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Jerome |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sheikh-issues-fatwa-against-all-terrorists-1915000.html |title=Sheikh issues fatwa against all terrorists |publisher=The Independent |date=3 March 2010 |accessdate=25 October 2011 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912181128/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sheikh-issues-fatwa-against-all-terrorists-1915000.html# |archive-date=2011-09-12 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced in [[Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2010/03/30/tor-ul-qadri-gta.html |title=Influential Pakistani cleric based in GTA |publisher=CBC News |date=March 30, 2010 |accessdate=October 25, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402102656/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2010/03/30/tor-ul-qadri-gta.html# |archive-date=2010-04-02 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by an influential Muslim scholar Dr [[Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri]] and was launched in [[London]] on March 2, 2010. Dr Qadri said during the launch "Terrorism is terrorism, violence is violence and it has no place in Islamic teaching and no justification can be provided for it, or any kind of excuses or ifs or buts." According to [[CNN]], experts see the fatwa as a significant blow to terrorist recruiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Khalid |first=Kiran |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/03/03/terror.fatwa.analysis/index.html |title=Some experts see fatwa as significant blow to terrorist recruiting |publisher=CNN |date=March 3, 2010 |accessdate=October 25, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108010752/http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/03/03/terror.fatwa.analysis/index.html# |archive-date=2012-11-08 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2, 2013 in [[Lahore]], 50 Muslim scholars of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) issued a collective fatwa against suicide bombings, the killing of innocent people, bomb attacks, and targeted killings declaring them as Haram or forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1022298 |title=Fatwa issued against suicide bombings, targeted killings and terrorism |date=2 July 2013 |location=Lahore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have also declared that terrorism is not Islamic by issuing fatwas against terrorism and fifteen lakh muslims support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sheikh-issues-fatwa-against-all-terrorists-1915000.html|title=Sheikh issues fatwa against all terrorists|work=The Independent|accessdate=1 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202021756/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sheikh-issues-fatwa-against-all-terrorists-1915000.html#|archive-date=2015-02-02|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/70000-clerics-issue-fatwa-against-terrorism-15-lakh-Muslims-support-it/articleshow/50100656.cms|title=70,000 clerics issue fatwa against terrorism, 15 lakh Muslims support it|work=The Times of India|accessdate=5 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105231801/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/70000-clerics-issue-fatwa-against-terrorism-15-lakh-Muslims-support-it/articleshow/50100656.cms#|archive-date=2018-11-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fatwa on ISIS membership===
On March 11, 2015, [[Syed Soharwardy]], the founder of the [[Islamic Supreme Council of Canada]], and 37 other Muslim leaders of various Islamic sects from across Canada gathered in [[Calgary]] and issued a fatwa condemning followers of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State (ISIS)]] as non-Muslims. Soharwardy cited capturing opponents and beheading them, killing Muslims who disagree with ISIS's actions, destroying mosques, burning enemy soldiers alive and encouraging Muslim girls to join ISIS, among others, as acts by ISIS that violate Islamic law. Under this fatwa, anybody who even wishes to join the group will be "excommunicated from the Muslim community" and no longer considered Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://ca.news.yahoo.com/canadian-imams-issue-fatwa-isil-supporters-calling-them-183339522.html# |title=Canadian Press story about Calgary fatwa |access-date=2015-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402143620/https://ca.news.yahoo.com/canadian-imams-issue-fatwa-isil-supporters-calling-them-183339522.html# |archive-date=2015-04-02 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.islamicsupremecouncil.com/resources/historic-islamic-edict-fatwa-on-joining-isis-isil/# |title=ISCC's announcement of fatwa against ISIS |access-date=2015-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312160925/http://www.islamicsupremecouncil.com/resources/historic-islamic-edict-fatwa-on-joining-isis-isil/# |archive-date=2015-03-12 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fatwas promoting violence against a particular individual==
Fatwas involving violence are more likely to be well known than other fatwas, especially to non-Muslims. One possible reason is that non-Muslims regard most fatwas as not affecting them, but fatwas involving violence can potentially affect them. Fatwas do not only affect non-Muslims. It is important to note that a Fatwa is meant to be issued by a legal scholar, not by any political entity. Generally, any given case may have many fatwas (legal opinions) written by the scholars of the region and time. The fatwa backed by the State is the one with legal power. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In 2011, an Egyptian Muslim cleric, [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]], issued a fatwa that urged soldiers to kill [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]], the leader of Libya, if they were able to do so.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10707969"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10707969 |title='Shoot Gaddafi' fatwa issued |date=February 22, 2011 |agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=October 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024210536/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10707969# |archive-date=2012-10-24 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Jerry Falwell}}

In an interview given on September 30, 2002, for the October 6 edition of ''[[60 Minutes]]'', American [[Southern Baptist]] [[pastor]] and [[Televangelism|televangelist]] [[Jerry Falwell]] said: "I think Muhammad was a terrorist. I read enough by both Muslims and non-Muslims, [to decide] that he was a violent man, a man of war."

The following Friday, [[Mohsen Mojtahed Shabestari]], an Iranian cleric, issued a fatwa calling for Falwell's death, saying Falwell was a "mercenary and must be killed." He added, "The death of that man is a religious duty, but his case should not be tied to the Christian community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harpers.org/archive/2002/10/WeeklyReview2002-10-15#20030930004639-8368231218 Weekly Review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009212052/http://harpers.org/archive/2002/10/WeeklyReview2002-10-15#20030930004639-8368231218#20030930004639-8368231218 |date=2011-10-09 }}, Harper's Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salman Rushdie===
{{main|Salman Rushdie}}
{{main|The Satanic Verses controversy}}

One of the first well-known fatwas was proclaimed in 1989 by the [[Iran]]ian [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], against [[Salman Rushdie]] over his novel ''[[The Satanic Verses (novel)|The Satanic Verses]]''. The reason was an allegedly blasphemous statement taken from an early biography of [[Muhammad]], regarding the incorporation of pagan [[goddess]]es into Islam’s strongly monotheistic structure. Khomeini died shortly after issuing the fatwa. In 1998 Iran stated it is no longer pursuing Rushdie’s death; however, that decree was again reversed in early 2005 by the present [[theocrat]], [[Ayatollah]] [[Ali Khamenei]].

In 1991, Rushdie's [[Japanese language|Japanese]] translator, [[Hitoshi Igarashi]], was stabbed to death in [[Tokyo]], and his [[Italian language|Italian]] translator was beaten and stabbed in [[Milan]]. In 1993, Rushdie's [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] publisher [[William Nygaard]] was shot and severely injured in an attack outside his house in [[Oslo]]. Thirty-seven guests died when their hotel in [[Sivas, Turkey]] was torched by locals protesting against [[Aziz Nesin]], Rushdie's [[Turkish language|Turkish]] translator.

In February 2016, in celebration of the anniversary of the fatwa against Rushdie, Iranian state-run median agencies added $300,000 to the estimated $3.3 Million bounty for the death of Rushdie.

===Taslima Nasreen===
{{main|Taslima Nasreen}}

Fundamentalists in [[Bangladesh]] proclaimed a fatwa against [[Taslima Nasreen]] in 1993, against a series of newspaper columns in which she was critical of the treatment of [[women in Islam|women under Islam]]. The next year she wrote ''[[Lajja]]'' (Shame) which described the abuse of women and minorities. Again there were calls for her death, and her passport was confiscated. Within the legal system, she felt that she might have faced a jail term of up to two years, where she was likely to be murdered. She managed to escape the country via [[Calcutta]], was granted [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in [[Sweden]], and then lived in [[Paris]], and finally went to India. Even in India, she had to flee the city of [[Kolkata]] and move to [[Delhi]] under the Indian government's strict orders following riots in Kolkata.

=== Ulil Abshar Abdalla ===
{{main|Ulil Abshar Abdalla}}

In 2003, a group of Indonesian Islamic clerics from Forum Ulama Umat Islam issued a death fatwa against Ulil&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/southeast/01/22/indo.fatwa/# |title=CNN |access-date=2012-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914151817/http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/southeast/01/22/indo.fatwa/# |archive-date=2012-09-14 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for an article that Ulil wrote in ''[[Kompas]]'' in 2002, "Menyegarkan Kembali Pemahaman Islam" (Rejuvenating the Islamic Understanding)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0211/18/opini/meng04.htm Kompas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513061236/http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0211/18/opini/meng04.htm |date=2007-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://islamlib.com/id/index.php?page=article&amp;id=1# |title=Article in JIL website |access-date=2012-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206090935/http://islamlib.com/id/index.php?page=article&amp;id=1# |archive-date=2012-02-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is considered heretical by the clerics. In March 2011, a letter bomb addressed to Ulil at Komunitas Utan Kayu exploded, injuring a police officer.

=== Farag Foda ===
{{main|Farag Foda}}

In June 1992, Egyptian writer [[Farag Foda]] was assassinated following a fatwa issued by [[ulama]]s from [[Al-Azhar University|Al-Azhar]] who had adopted a previous fatwa by Sheikh al-Azhar, [[Gad al-Haq|Jadd al-Haqq]], accusing Foda and other secularist writers of being "enemies of Islam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bar |first=Shmuel |authorlink= |title=Warrant for Terror: The Fatwas of Radical Islam and the Duty to Jihad |year=2008 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |page=16, footnote 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jihadist group [[Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]] claimed responsibility for the murder.&lt;ref name="deWaal"&gt;{{cite book |last=de Waal |first=Alex |authorlink=Alex de Waal |title=Islamism and Its Enemies in the Horn of Africa |year=2004 |publisher=C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9163">The '''Sir Hugh Casson Award''' for the worst new building of the year has been awarded annually since 1982 by the 'Nooks and Corners' column of the British satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]''. The name ironically honours [[Hugh Casson|Sir Hugh Casson]]. Column author [[Gavin Stamp]] explained in 2015 that "he would turn up - take a fee - for giving evidence at public inquiries to recommend the demolition of buildings: a trade I despise". Stamp noted that Casson would sometimes mention his office as Vice-Chairman of [[The Victorian Society]] when arguing for the demolition of Victorian buildings. The medal of the award uses a sketch of Casson which is a [[self-portrait]].&lt;ref name="Page 94"&gt;{{cite podcast |title=Page 94: The Private Eye Podcast.

{{Marxism|Aspects}}

'''Marxist historiography''', or [[historical materialist]] historiography, is a school of [[historiography]] influenced by [[Marxism]].  The chief tenets of Marxist historiography are the centrality of [[social class]] and [[economic]] constraints in determining historical outcomes.

Marxist historiography has made contributions to the history of the [[working class]], oppressed nationalities, and the [[methodology]] of [[People's history|history from below]]. The chief problematic aspect of Marxist historiography has been an argument on the nature of history as ''determined'' or ''dialectical''; this can also be stated as the relative importance of [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and [[Objectivity (journalism)|objective]] factors in creating outcomes.

Marxist history is generally [[Determinism|deterministic]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Elgar Companion to Marxist Economics|author1=Ben Fine|author2=Alfredo Saad-Filho|author3=Marco Boffo|publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing|page=212|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xe0VQArHt8sC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=determinism#v=onepage&amp;q=determinism&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A2WSBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=marxist+history+deterministic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRsLn61NfXAhUJK48KHXprAcg4ChDoAQgyMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=marxist%20history%20deterministic&amp;f=false|page=5|title=|first=J.J.|last= O'Rourke|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9pem7Ip_WUgC&amp;pg=PA247|first=Kenneth|last=Stunkel|page=247|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; it posits a direction of history, towards an end state of history as [[classless]] human society. Marxist historiography, that is, the writing of Marxist history in line with the given historiographical principles, is generally seen as a tool. Its aim is to bring those oppressed by history to [[Self-actualization#Self-actualization|self-consciousness]], and to arm them with tactics and strategies from history: it is both a historical and a liberatory project.

Historians who use Marxist methodology, but disagree with the mainstream of Marxism, often describe themselves as ''marxist'' historians (with a lowercase ''M'').  Methods from Marxist historiography, such as class analysis, can be divorced from the liberatory intent of Marxist historiography; such practitioners often refer to their work as ''marxian'' or ''Marxian''.

==Marx and Engels==

[[Friedrich Engels]]' most important historical contribution was ''Der deutsche Bauernkrieg'' (''The [[German Peasants' War]]''), which analysed social warfare in early Protestant Germany in terms of emerging capitalist classes. ''The German Peasants' War'' indicate the Marxist interest in [[People's history|history from below]] and class analysis, and attempts a dialectical analysis.

Marx's most important works on social and political history include ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'', ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', ''[[The German Ideology]]'', and those chapters of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' dealing with the historical emergence of [[Capitalism|capitalists]] and [[Proletariat|proletarians]] from [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial]] English society.

Engels' short treatise ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' (1870s) was salient in creating the [[socialist]] impetus in British politics.

==Marx and labor==

Key to understanding Marxist historiography is his view of labor. For Marx "historical reality is none other than objectified labor, and all conditions of labor given by nature, including the organic bodies of people, are merely preconditions and 'disappearing moments' of the labor process."&lt;ref&gt;Andrey Maidansky. "The Logic of Marx's History," Russian Studies in Philosophy, vol. 51, no. 2 (Fall 2012): 45.&lt;/ref&gt; This emphasis on the physical as the determining factor in history represents a break from virtually all previous historians. Until Marx developed his theory of [[historical materialism]], the overarching determining factor in the direction of history was some sort of divine agency.  In Marx's view of history "God became a mere projection of human imagination" and more importantly "a tool of oppression".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Breisach. Historiography: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern, 3rd Ed. (Chicago, Il: University of Chicago Press, 2007), pg. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no more sense of divine direction to be seen. History moved by the sheer force of human labor, and all theories of divine nature were a concoction of the ruling powers to keep the working people in check. For Marx, "The first historical act is... the production of material life itself."&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Stern. The Varieties of History: From Voltaire to the Present. Vintage Books Edition (New York, NY: Random House: 1973), 150.&lt;/ref&gt; As one might expect, Marxist history not only begins with labor, it ends in production: "history does not end by being resolved into "self-consciousness" as "spirit of the spirit," but that in it at each stage there is found a material result: a sum of productive forces, a historically created relation of individuals to nature and to one another, which is handed down to each generation from its predecessor..."&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Stern. The Varieties of History: From Voltaire to the Present. Vintage Books Edition (New York, NY: Random House: 1973), 156-157.&lt;/ref&gt; For further, and much more comprehensive, information on this topic, see [[historical materialism]].

==In the Soviet Union==
{{details|Historiography in the Soviet Union}}

Marxist historiography suffered in the [[Soviet Union]], as the government requested overdetermined historical writing. Soviet historians tended to avoid contemporary history (history after 1905) where possible and effort was predominantly directed at premodern history.  As history was considered to be a politicised academic discipline, historians limited their creative output to avoid prosecution.

Notable histories include the ''Short Course History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ([[Bolshevik]])'', published in the 1930s, which was written in order to justify the nature of Bolshevik party life under [[Joseph Stalin]].

==The Communist Party Historians Group in Britain==
{{Main|Communist Party Historians Group}}
A circle of historians inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) formed in 1946. They shared a common interest in "history from below" and class structure in early capitalist society. While some members of the group (most notably [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] and [[E. P. Thompson]]) left the CPGB after the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. They placed a great emphasis on the subjective determination of history. E. P. Thompson famously engaged [[Louis Althusser|Althusser]] in ''[[The Poverty of Theory]]'', arguing that Althusser's theory overdetermined history, and left no space for historical revolt by the oppressed.

Thompson's ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'' is one of the works commonly associated with this group. [[Eric Hobsbawm]]'s ''Bandits'' is another example of this group's work.

[[C. L. R. James]] was also a great pioneer of the 'history from below' approach. Living in Britain when he wrote his most notable work ''[[The Black Jacobins]]'' (1938), he was an [[anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]] Marxist and so outside of the CPGB.

In India, [[Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi|D. D. Kosambi]] is considered the founding father of Marxist historiography. The senior-most scholars of Marxist historiography are [[Ram Sharan Sharma|R. S. Sharma]], [[Irfan Habib]], [[D. N. Jha]] and [[K. N. Panikkar]].&lt;ref&gt;Bottomore, T. B. 1983. A Dictionary of Marxist thought. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

One debate in Indian history that relates to a [[historical materialist]] schema is on the nature of [[feudalism]] in India. [[Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi|D. D. Kosambi]] in the 1960s outlined the idea of "feudalism from below" and "feudalism from above". R. S. Sharma largely agrees with Kosambi in his various books.&lt;ref&gt;R S Sharma, ''[[Indian Feudalism (book)]], 2005''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R S Sharma, ''Early Medieval Indian Society: A Study in Feudalisation'', Orient Longman, Kolkata, 2001, pp. 177-85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R S Sharma, ''India's Ancient Past'', Oxford University Press, New Delhi, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D N Jha, ''The Feudal Order: State Society and Ideology in Early Medieval India'', Manohar Publishers, New Delhi, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Most Indian Marxists argue that the economic origins of communalism are feudal remnants and the economic insecurities caused by slow development under a "world capitalist system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dalit women in India: issues and perspective|page=138|first=Prahlad|last=Jogdand|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[B. R. Ambedkar]] criticized Marxists, as he deemed them to be unaware or ignorant of the specifics of [[caste]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M7ffDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA167|title=Development-Induced Displacement in India and China: A Comparative Look at the Burdens of Growth|last=Padovani|first=Florence|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|quote=Bhimrao Ambedkar himself, who criticized Indian Marxists}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of historians have also debated Marxist historians and critically examined their analysis of [[history of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Legacy of Muslim Rule in India|quote=Marxists who always try to cover up the black spots of Muslim rule with thick coats of whitewash|first=Kishori Saran|last=Lal|publisher=Aditya Prakashan|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Politics, Then and Now: Essays in Historical Perspective|first=K|last=Seshadri|publisher=Pragatee Prakashan|page=5|quote=certain attempts made by some ultra-Marxist historians to justify and even whitewash tyrannical emperors of the medieval India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in World Affairs, Volume 1|first=KR|last=Gupta|publisher=Atlantic Publisher|page=249|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hw9uf7sRKtIC&amp;pg=PA249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Al-Hind the Making of the Indo-Islamic World: The Slave Kings and the Islamic Conquest : 11Th-13th Centuries|last=Wink|first=André|publisher=BRILL|page=309|quote="apologists for Islam, as well as some marxist scholars in India have sometimes attempted to reduce Islamic iconoclasm.."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1990s, [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist]] scholars especially have polemicized against the Marxist tradition in India for neglecting what they believe to be the country's 'illustrious past.'

'''Narrative poetry''' is a form of [[poetry]] that tells a story, often making the voices of a narrator and characters as well; the entire story is usually written in metered verse. Narrative poems do not need rhyme. The poems that make up this genre may be short or long, and the story it relates to may be complex. It is normally dramatic, with objectives, diverse and meter.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meyer, ''The Bedford Introduction to Literature'', Bedford/St. Martin's, 2005, p2134.&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative poems include [[epic poetry|epic]]s, [[ballad]]s, [[idyll]]s, and [[Lyric poetry|lays]].

Some narrative poetry takes the form of a [[verse novel|novel in verse]]. An example of this is ''[[The Ring and the Book]]'' by [[Robert Browning]]. In the terms of narrative poetry, a [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] is a narrative poem that tells a story of [[chivalry]]. Examples include the ''[[Romance of the Rose]]'' or [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s  ''[[Idylls of the King]]''. Although those examples use [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Arthurian]] materials, romances may also tell stories from [[Mythology|classical mythology]]. 

Shorter narrative poems often similar in style to the [[short story]]. Sometimes, these short narratives are collected into interrelated groups, as with [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''. So [[saga]]s include both incidental poetry and the biographies of poets. An example is "[[The Cremation of Sam McGee]]" by [[Robert W. Service|Robert Service]].

==Oral tradition==
{{Literature}}
The [[oral tradition]]  essentially all other modern forms of communication. For thousands of years, people groups accurately passed on their history through the Oral Tradition from generation to generation. As a clear example and the oldest one comes from Ancient India, the [[Vedic Chant]], which is often considered the oldest unbroken oral tradition in existence today. In addition, one of the most notable was the ancient Hebrews, people of the Middle East; they were taught and passed on the stories of God in over 115 countries worldwide. The poetry in the [[Bible]] is called the [[Psalms]], that capture stories of conquest, failure, confession and more. Some of it is narrative in nature.

Historically, much of poetry has its source in an [[oral tradition]]: in more recent times the [[Scotland|Scots]] and [[England|English]] [[ballad]]s, the tales of [[Robin Hood]], of [[Alexander the Great|Iskandar]], and various [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] [[hero]]ic poems all were originally intended for [[recitation]], rather than reading. In many cultures, there remains a lively tradition of the recitation of traditional tales in verse formativeness. It has been suggested that some of the distinctive features that distinguish poetry from [[prose]], such as [[metre (poetry)|metre]], [[alliteration]] and [[kenning]]s, at one time served as [[memory aid]]s that allowed the [[bard]]s who recited traditional tales to reconstruct them from [[memory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Rubin (psychologist)|David C. Rubin]], ''Memory in Oral Traditions. The Cognitive Psychology of Epic, Ballads, and Counting-out Rhymes'' (Taco University Press, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

A narrative poem usually tells a story using a poetic theme. Epics are very vital to narrative poems, although it is thought those narrative poems were created to explain oral traditions. The focus of narrative poetry is often the pros and cons of life.

'''''Programa Silvio Santos''''' is a Brazilian [[variety program]] presented and created by [[Silvio Santos]] and  broadcast by [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão]] (SBT). Airing since June 2, 1963, it is the second oldest television program in Brazil. It is the main attraction of SBT on Sundays. The program airs from 20:00 until midnight.  It is best known as a program of sequential segments, game shows, pranks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://top10mais.org/top-10-pegadinhas-mais-engracadas-silvio-santos/|title=Top 10 pegadinhas mais engraçadas de todos os tempos (Silvio Santos)|publisher=Top 10 Mais|date=|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its famous airplanes of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extra.globo.com/tv-e-lazer/seu-assis-faz-todos-os-avioezinhos-do-silvio-santos-sinto-muito-orgulho-por-criar-algo-que-da-tao-certo-7790959.html|title=Seu Assis faz todos os aviõezinhos do Silvio Santos: ‘Sinto muito orgulho por criar algo que dá tão certo’|publisher=Extra|date=10 March 2013|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rural letter carriers''' are [[United States Postal Service]] and [[Canada Post]] employees who [[Rural delivery service|deliver mail]] in what are traditionally considered [[rural]] and [[suburban]] areas of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. Before [[Rural Free Delivery]] (RFD), rural citizens of the US and Canada were required to go to the post office in the cities to get their mail.

==Types of carriers==
The rural carrier work force is divided into the following categories of employees:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nrlca.org/UploadedImages/ContentDocument/EL-902_%282010-2015%29.pdf|article=Article 7|title=Agreement Between the United States Postal Service &amp; the National Rural Letter Carriers’ Association|date=2010–2015|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regular carriers (Designation Code 71)===
For administrative and reporting purposes, regular rural carriers who serve on an established rural route on the basis of triweekly, five, five-and-a-half, or six days in a service week, are considered full-time employees.

===Part-time flexible rural carriers (Designation Code 76)===
Part-time flexible rural carriers (PTFs) are those substitutes or rural carrier associates appointed following an assignment posting. These employees provide service on regular and auxiliary routes as directed by management.

===Substitutes, associates &amp; reliefs===
The following employees provide service on established regular and auxiliary rural routes in the absence of regular or auxiliary rural carriers. This service may be as leave replacement and/or covering vacant regular routes pending the selection of regular rural carriers, as an auxiliary assistant or as an auxiliary route carrier:

*'''Substitute rural carriers (Designation Code 72)''' appointed via Form 50 to serve full-time on a vacant regular route or in the absence of a regular carrier for more than 90 calendar days.
*'''Substitute rural carriers (Designation Code 73)''' are those employees hired prior to July 21, 1981, with an appointment without time limitation.
*'''Rural carrier associates (Designation Code 74)''' are appointed via Form 50 to serve full-time on a vacant route or in the absence of the regular carrier for more than 90 calendar days. Designation Code 75 are those employees hired between July 21, 1981 and November 12, 1986 without time limitation. Designation Code 78 are those employees hired from a register or reassigned from rural carrier relief or auxiliary carrier positions, on or after April 11, 1987, without time limitation. Designation Code 79 are appointed via Form 50 after being assigned to the auxiliary route for more than 90 calendar days.

===Auxiliary rural carriers (Designation Code 77)===
Persons hired prior to 1981 to serve an auxiliary rural route without time limitation.

===Assistant Rural Carriers (Designation Code 70-5)===
Assistant Rural Carriers (ARCs) were added to the 2016 contract. They primarily assist with package delivery on weekends &amp; holidays, but can also be used to perform standard route duties on Saturdays.

==History==
Much support for the introduction of a nationwide rural mail delivery service came from [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry]], the nation's oldest agricultural organization. Formerly, residents of rural areas had to either travel to a distant [[Post office]] to pick up their mail, or else pay for delivery by a private carrier. Free mail delivery began in American cities in 1863 with a limited scope. Shortly afterwards, rural citizens began petitioning for equal consideration. [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] [[John Wanamaker]] first suggested rural free deliver (RFD) of mail in the [[United States]] in his annual report for fiscal year 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=988&amp;dat=19790111&amp;id=rnMmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BhMGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3682,59015&amp;hl=en|title=Rural Letter Carriers to Serve More Homes|newspaper=Pennsboro News|date=January 11, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Post Office Department]] first experimented with the idea of rural mail delivery on October 1, 1891 to determine the viability of RFD. They began with five routes covering ten miles, 33 years after free delivery in cities had begun. The first routes to receive RFD during its experimental phase were in [[Jefferson County, West Virginia]], near [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]], [[Halltown, West Virginia|Halltown]] and [[Uvilla, West Virginia|Uvilla]].

After five years of controversy, RFD finally became an official service in 1896 under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Grover Cleveland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://greenbrierhistorical.wordpress.com/tag/grover-cleveland/|title=Item of the Week|publisher=Greenbrier Historical Society – North House Museum &amp; Archives|date=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, 82 rural routes were put into operation. The service has grown steadily. By 1901, the mileage had increased to over 100,000; the cost was $1,750,321 and over 37,000 carriers were employed. In 1910, the mileage was 993,068; cost $36,915,000; carriers 40,997. In 1913 came the introduction of [[parcel post]] delivery, which caused another boom in rural deliveries. Parcel post service allowed the distribution of national newspapers and magazines, and was responsible for millions of dollars of sales in mail-order merchandise to customers in rural areas. In 1930, there were 43,278 rural routes serving about 6,875,321 families. The cost was $106,338,341.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.si.edu/ondisplay/parcelpost/cf/view.cfm|title=Parcel Post: Delivery of Dreams|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, the Good Roads Bill authorized federal funds for highway construction, which opened up roads in rural America to allow passage of mail.

Today, as in years past, the rural delivery service uses a network of rural routes traveled by carriers to deliver and pick up mail to and from roadside mailboxes. Formerly, an address for mail to a rural delivery address included both the rural route number and the box number, for example "RR 5, Box 10." With the creation of the [[9-1-1|911 emergency system]], it became necessary to discontinue the old rural route numbers in favor of house numbers and street names as used on city routes. This change enabled emergency services to more quickly locate a rural residence.

==Labor union==
{{Main|National Rural Letter Carriers' Association}}
The National Rural Letter Carriers' Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrlca.org/|title=National Rural Letter Carriers' Association|accessdate=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; was formed in 1903 at a cost of fifty cents per year in dues to its members. Since its inception, it has had an effective legislative program in the [[United States Congress]] to promote and protect the interests of rural carriers. In 1962, President [[John F. Kennedy]] signed executive order 10988 establishing employee-management cooperation in the federal service. Rural carriers selected the NRLCA as their agent, and they have held exclusive recognition to represent the rural carrier craft within the United States Postal Service ever since. The NRLCA negotiates all labor agreements for the rural carrier craft with the USPS, including salaries. Rural letter carriers are considered bargaining unit employees in the United States Postal Service. This means that there is a contract between the Postal Service and the NRLCA. Only NRLCA can represent members of the rural carrier craft in the grievance procedure, including providing protection in disciplinary actions.

To be able to join the NRLCA, one must first be employed by the USPS and work in the rural carrier craft as a rural carrier associate, substitute rural carrier, rural carrier relief, part-time flexible or regular carrier. Temporary relief carriers, under guidelines covered by article 7 of the NRLCA/USPS contract, are excluded from membership.  Upon completion and processing of NRLCA form 1187, an official membership card is mailed, and the benefits of membership begin. NRLCA provides information and fellowship for its members at county, district, state and national meetings where all members may participate in a democratic process of developing association policy. The NRLCA provides a monthly publication, ''The National Rural Letter Carrier'', to keep its members informed on postal and legislative matters of vital interest.

==Attire==
Rural carriers wear civilian clothes, not uniforms, while they deliver the mail. A minimal dress code is enforced, requiring cleanliness and a manner of dress that reflects a positive image of the Postal Service. Suggestive dress is prohibited. Proper footwear is required (no open toes or heels).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uspsoig.gov/blog/it-time-uniform-approach-uniforms|title=Is it Time for a Uniform Approach to Uniforms?|date=December 17, 2012|publisher=Office of the Inspector General}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With national attention focusing on heightening security, rural carriers wear and display identification badges. ID badges are issued for security control of access to postal premises and operations and to identify individuals as USPS employees. An ID badge is provided to each rural carrier to be displayed during official duty hours.

==Vehicle==
[[File:USPS Dodge CV.JPG|thumb|160px|[[Dodge Caravan]] used for rural delivery in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].]]
Rural carriers are responsible for furnishing all vehicle equipment necessary for safe and prompt handling of the mail,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&amp;dat=19820403&amp;id=AhMhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QXUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3519,395081&amp;hl=en|author=Karen Markin|date=April 3, 1982|title=Mail Delivery: Rural Carriers Put Their Stamp on Postal Routes|newspaper=[[The Day (New London)]]|pages=1 &amp; 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; unless a USPS-owned/leased vehicle is assigned to the route. (If a USPS-owned/leased vehicle is assigned to the route, relief carriers may be requested, but not required, to furnish a vehicle during emergency situations). The vehicle is required to be large enough to accommodate the normal mail volume and constructed to protect the mail from loss or damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nrlca.org/UploadedImages/ContentDocument/EL-902_%282010-2015%29.pdf|article=Article 9.2.J.2|title=Agreement Between the USPS &amp; the NRLCA|date=2010–2015|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For each day servicing a route using a privately owned vehicle, the USPS pays an "Equipment Maintenance Allowance" (EMA) in accordance with the applicable schedule. The carrier receives EMA for each service day he reports to the Post Office, and is scheduled to perform delivery.

Advertisements of any kind and offensive slogans are prohibited from appearing on the vehicle and attire of the rural carrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apwu.org/sites/apwu/files/resource-files/PO-603%20Rural%20Carrier%20Duties%20and%20Responsibilities%2009-13.pdf|title=PO-603 Rural Carrier Duties &amp; Responsibilities|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, Canada Post has designated that rural mail routes with more than 330 rural mailboxes (RMB's) are designated right hand drive (RHD) routes. RHD vehicles used by Canada Post employees can be purchased with the help of a vehicle allowance from Canada Post or provided by Canada Post directly. Vehicle maintenance allowances are similar to those offered in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://postal-vehicles.com/faqs/|title=Postal Vehicles FAQs|website=Canada Post RSMC's &amp; Right Hand Drive Vehicles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Payment==
In 1962, the NRLCA and Post Office negotiated their first contract under Executive Order 10988, and within it, the Heavy Duty Agreement, or Evaluated Pay System was instituted. Rural Carriers are paid a salary based on an evaluation of the route they deliver. Credit is given for all a carrier's duties and compensated accordingly. Adjustments to the annual salary may be made periodically as route situations change, such as the addition or deletion of territory or mileage.  As an example, for every 12 houses with curbside service the route would be compensated for 24 minutes per week (4 minutes per day) along with associated time values for mail that is delivered or picked up, and mileage driven. The yearly salary range for most regular Rural Carriers on will vary between $40,000 and $65,000 depending on the route evaluation and longevity. Rural carriers cannot earn overtime pay except for short period during the Christmas season.

There are Cost of living adjustments and salary increases that are negotiated in each four-year contract. There are 15 step increases in a Rural Carrier pay scale. It takes about 12 years for a Rural Carrier to max out at the top of the pay scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nrlca.org/UploadedImages/ContentDocument/EL-902_%282010-2015%29.pdf|article=Article 9.1|title=Agreement Between the USPS &amp; the NRLCA|date=2010–2015|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relief carriers can be required to be trained on up to three routes. A relief carrier may be required to carry a route other than the primary route. The time would then be recorded on the PS Form 4240 for that route. PS Form 1234 Utility Card (commonly called green card) is used to record work hours when the carrier is doing miscellaneous duties or when attending training. Carriers will use more than one utility card if they work in more than one station. All times are compiled by the timekeeper and submitted for pay.

'''''Saints Row IV''''' is an [[open world]] [[action-adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[Volition (company)|Volition]] and published by [[Deep Silver]]. It is the fourth title in the ''[[Saints Row]]'' series. In the game, the [[playable character]] is the leader of the 3rd Street Saints, a [[street gang]] that has become the world's most powerful and popular organization, and must fend off an alien invasion after becoming [[President of the United States]] and receiving [[superpower]]s. The player is free to explore their environment while completing main and side [[Level (video gaming)|missions]] at their leisure. The game incorporates elements from science fiction video games and films, and continues the series' reputation for over-the-top [[parody]]. It was released in August 2013 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]], and was later [[Porting of video games|ported]] to [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Linux]] in 2015.

The game was Volition's first after its sale to [[Koch Media]] in early 2013. The supernatural and superpower concept for the game started in ''[[Enter the Dominatrix]]'', a cancelled [[expansion pack|expansion]] planned for ''[[Saints Row: The Third]]'', which the team expanded into ''Saints Row IV''. Volition later released a "director's cut" of ''Enter the Dominatrix'' as [[downloadable content]] for ''Saints Row IV'' alongside ''How the Saints Saved Christmas'', other weapons, costumes, and vehicle packs, and a standalone expansion, ''[[Saints Row: Gat out of Hell]]'' (which serves as the epilogue to the story). ''Saints Row IV'' received several limited and summative edition releases, and was briefly banned in Australia. Critics praised ''Saints Row IV''{{'s}} humor and character customization options, but criticized its lack of challenge. It sold over one million copies in its first week.

Similar to previous ''[[Saints Row]]'' series games,&lt;ref name="IGN: review"/&gt; ''Saints Row IV'' is an [[open world]] [[action game]] with [[third-person shooter]] elements wherein the player is free to explore the environment and, at their leisure, play story or side [[Level (video gaming)|missions]].&lt;ref name="Polygon: review"/&gt; As the leader of the Saints, a [[street gang]] that has become the world's most "powerful and popular" organization, the player is elected [[President of the United States]], receives [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]], and fends off an [[alien invasion]].&lt;ref name="Polygon: review"/&gt; Most often the player will engage in shooting and racing activities, though other activities vary from fighting crowds of zombies, shoot-outs in tanks,&lt;ref name="Polygon: review"/&gt; [[side-scrolling]] [[brawlers]], fights against supersized, [[daikaiju]] [[energy drink]] cans, and using a [[dubstep]] gun to interrupt 1950s [[Americana]].&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: review"/&gt; The player-character receives elemental powers and superpowers that greatly increase their jump height and running speed, such that the player can hop over buildings and outrun vehicles.&lt;ref name="Polygon: review"/&gt; The elemental powers include abilities to shoot fire and ice projectiles, [[telekinetic]]ally toss things, and create shockwaves upon landing jumps.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: review"/&gt;  As the player progresses through the game, they can optionally upgrade their abilities and weapons [[skill tree]]&lt;ref name="Polygon: review"/&gt; by using collectible "data clusters" scattered around town.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: review"/&gt; If the player becomes too rowdy, the alien race's police analogue will intervene.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: review"/&gt; As in previous games, the player-character's look and feel is entirely customizable via a robust character editor feature.&lt;ref name="IGN: review"/&gt;

The game is set in a nearly identical&lt;ref name="IGN: review"/&gt; simulation of Steelport, the fictional city setting from ''[[Saints Row: The Third]]'',&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: review"/&gt; though individual story missions have new, custom-designed [[Level (video gaming)|levels]].&lt;ref name="IGN: review"/&gt; ''Saints Row IV''{{'s}} story parodies science fiction video games, especially ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'', as well as films like ''[[The Matrix]]'' and ''[[Zero Dark Thirty]]'', and other "nerd culture".&lt;ref name="Polygon: review"/&gt; Some story missions are propelled by individual characters' existential crises,&lt;ref name="Polygon: review"/&gt; as each Saint character is stuck in a personal simulation of their own hell, and must be rescued by the player.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: review"/&gt; Other elements borrowed from video game culture include [[BioWare]]-style character romances games and a ''[[Metal Gear]]''-style mission with an unhelpful partner.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: review"/&gt;

City districts are "liberated" from alien occupation as the player completes side missions in occupied districts.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: review"/&gt; Liberated districts increase the player's hourly income, which can be spent on weapons, skills, and perks. Side missions include Insurance Fraud (where the player jumps into traffic to collect insurance money),&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: review"/&gt; [[demolition derby]]-style Mayhem, and superpowered foot races. ''Saints Row IV'' has a two-player [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] mode.&lt;ref name="IGN: review"/&gt;

== Synopsis ==

=== Plot ===
A few months after the events of ''[[Saints Row: The Third]]'', The Boss, Shaundi and Pierce Washington are called upon to assist [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI-6]] agent Asha Odekar and her contact, reformed former Deckers leader Matt Miller, in infiltrating a Middle Eastern compound to assassinate former STAG leader Cyrus Temple and prevent a nuclear missile strike against Washington D.C. The Boss kills Cyrus, but is unable to stop him from launching the missile. Climbing aboard it, the Boss disarms the nuke before it reaches Washington, earning the adoration of America.

Five years later, The Boss has been elected [[President of the United States]], with the other members of the Saints, [[Keith David]] and former Vice Kings leader Benjamin King acting as cabinet. While preparing for a press conference, the Boss is told that Asha and Matt have arrived at the [[White House]] to warn them of what they suspect is an impending [[alien invasion]]. Just as the Boss is informed, the invasion begins, spearheaded by the alien warlord Zinyak, who captures the entire cabinet, including the Boss.

The Boss wakes up in a 1950s [[sitcom]] set in the city of Pleasantville, devoid of violence and foul language. The Saints' computer hacking specialist, Kinzie Kensington, contacts the Boss and informs them that they are trapped inside a simulation, with each of the Zin's prisoners trapped inside personal simulations of their own fears in order to break their will. With Kinzie's help, the Boss breaks free of the simulation and joins Kinzie and Keith in a stolen Zin ship.

While the trio attempt to contact reinforcements from Earth, Zinyak atomizes the planet, killing everyone not already captured by the Zin, including Oleg Kirlov, Josh, Zimos, and Viola. Enraged, the Boss returns to the Steelport simulation to find their friends and reach Zinyak. After rescuing another prisoner of Zinyak, an artificial intelligence later named CID, and providing him with a physical body, the Boss, with his help, goes into the other Saint's simulations and rescues them from their nightmares.

As the simulation begins to weaken under the Saints' influence, Zinyak floods virtual Steelport with copies of gang members the Boss has faced in the past. Kinzie determines that the copies are being made from someone's memory, leading the Boss to conclude Johnny Gat, who was seemingly killed during the events of ''Saints Row: The Third'', is still alive and trapped within the simulation. Despite protests from Kinzie and Matt that rescuing Johnny will reveal their location to Zinyak, the Boss rescues Johnny from his [[Saints Row 2|nightmare of Aisha's death]] and gets him back to the ship. Johnny explains that during the fight in which he was presumed killed, he was actually abducted by Zinyak years in advance of their invasion, as Zinyak had concluded that Johnny could have single-handedly stopped him if left on Earth.

The Saints rally inside the simulation in order to confront Zinyak, but are ambushed by an enormous Zin force. They escape, but Kinzie is captured by Zinyak and the Boss emerges from the simulation to find that Keith betrayed the Saints and fled. Returning to Steelport, the Boss finds Keith has been declared president of the simulation. When confronted, Keith claims that Zinyak has the means to restore Earth, and has agreed to do so in exchange for the Boss' life. The Boss, determined to find Kinzie, pursues Keith into his nightmare, and with help from [[Roddy Piper]], beats Keith up until he barely manages to tell them where Kinzie has been taken to, Keith ultimately comes to his senses and rejoins the Saints.

After the Boss rescues Kinzie from her nightmare, she devises a plan to crash the simulation, which will force the Zin to draw power from their ship to keep it running, thus weakening the ship itself and creating an opening for the Saints to enter. Working together, the remaining Saints manage to overload the simulation, shutting it down just as the Boss escapes. Assaulting Zinyak's ship, the Boss finds [[power armor]] emulating the powers they had in the simulation, and confronts Zinyak in his throne room. While the entire Zin Empire watches, Zinyak and the Boss battle each other. With help from the Saints, the Boss kills Zinyak by tearing his head off and emerges victorious. Impressed, the Zin forces surrender to the Boss, who becomes the new head of the Zin Empire.

The Boss asks Zinjai, Zinyak's main servant, for technology to bring Earth back. Zinjai says they cannot restore Earth as it was atomized, but can use [[time-travel]] technology to return to Earth, explaining that Zinyak had used this technology to collect his favorite historical figures, keeping them in [[suspended animation]]. The Boss looks at the Saints and says, "Let's go on a field trip." In a post-credits scene, the nineteenth century writer [[Jane Austen]], whom the Boss is a fan of, is woken out of her stasis, revealing that she had been the narrator throughout the game.

If all of the loyalty missions have not been completed, an alternate ending plays out, which sees the Saints make plans to take over more planets, unaware of their ability to use time travel.

=== Characters ===
A number of characters from earlier games in the franchise - both members of the Third Street Saints and former adversaries - make a return in ''Saints Row IV'', many of whom take up the protagonist's Presidential administration. Kinzie Kensington, the socially awkward [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] hacker from ''Saints Row: The Third'' becomes the White House's [[White House Press Secretary|Press Secretary]], often tasked with clearing up the mess left behind by the President's verbal missteps. Benjamin King, former leader of the Vice Kings gang from the original Saints Row, becomes the President's [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]], while Pierce Washington has been appointed the [[White House Communications Director|Communications Director]] and Shaundi as the [[Director of the United States Secret Service|Director of the Secret Service]].

Matt Miller, having abandoned the Deckers and, according to news broadcasts in ''Saints Row: The Third'', announced an abstinence from the use of technology, presumably returned to the United Kingdom and became employed by MI-6 alongside new character Asha Odekar. Johnny Gat also returns after being thought dead in ''Saints Row: The Third''. Stilwater, the location of the first two games, makes an appearance for one mission with most of the street gangs from the first three games making appearances as well.

== Development ==
After the release of ''Saints Row: The Third'', preliminary work on a game called ''Saints Row: Part Four'' began. The game would take place after the events of ''The Third'' in a new city and feature gameplay similar to ''The Third''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXKeOTo9AH0&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, a [[standalone expansion]] to ''The Third'' called ''Enter the Dominatrix'' was first announced as a 2012 [[April Fool's]] joke,&lt;ref name="Ginf: April Fool's"/&gt; but still went into development. The [[expansion pack]]'s basic concept included a superpowered player-character trapped by alien commander Zinyak in a simulation of Steelport.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Dominatrix"/&gt; With [[THQ]] suffering financially, its president Jason Rubin encouraged company subsidiary and ''Saints Row'' series developer [[Volition (company)|Volition]] to grow elements from the expansion into a full game.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Volition"/&gt; The company announced this change in direction in June 2012,&lt;ref name="Polygon: merging"/&gt; cancelling ''Saints Row: Part Four'' and expanding ''Enter the Dominatrix'' into a full sequel, ''Saints Row IV''.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Volition"/&gt; The company's strategy was partly to avoid sales issues by releasing the game in August 2013, prior to the circulation of rumors about [[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)|next generation]] video game consoles.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Volition"/&gt; Volition was sold to [[Koch Media]] in early 2013 when its parent company, THQ, filed for bankruptcy. It became Koch's first internal video game studio. The studio officially announced ''Saints Row IV'' two months later, which was published by Koch Media brand [[Deep Silver]]. Acquired without rights to their ''[[Red Faction]]'' series, Volition's new goals were to make connected, open world games where "the player is an agent of mayhem". The entire company worked on the one game.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Volition"/&gt;

Each of the ''Saints Row'' series games had a core intent, and while the first three games built on the first's "outlandishness and irreverence", the fourth focused on "the [[supernatural]] and superpowers".&lt;ref name="Polygon: Disney"/&gt; Senior producer Jim Boone recalled reviewers that asked whether the company could be "more over-the-top" than ''Saints Row: The Third'', which they took as a challenge.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Volition"/&gt; The team focused more on making the game "fun" than "for the sake of being over the top", and felt that superpowers helped the game's basic navigation and combat.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Volition"/&gt; They also chose to remove the previous game's in-game mobile phone-based navigation, which hindered its narration, and replaced it with a "quest log structure".&lt;ref name="Polygon: Volition"/&gt; The team chose not to devote as much time improving the game's graphics, considering the impending release of next generation platforms. The game spent less time in development than prior series games.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Volition"/&gt;

In August 2014, Volition announced that they would be releasing a [[development kit]] for the Windows version of the game, which lets players [[video game mod|modify]] game assets&lt;ref name="Polygon: modders"/&gt; and create new weapons.&lt;ref name="Polygon: port"/&gt;

The in-game radio has seven pre-programmed radio stations and 109 licensed tracks. The game's original soundtrack is composed by Malcolm Kirby Jr.,&lt;ref name="Polygon: soundtrack"/&gt; who also composed the previous game's soundtrack.&lt;ref name="GamersHell: Sumthing Else"/&gt;

On November 2016, the PC version included [[Steam Workshop]], allowing players to release [http://steamcommunity.com/app/206420/workshop/ a wide number of mods] such as characters and weapons included in the game.

=== Release and downloadable content ===

{{see also|Enter the Dominatrix|Saints Row: Gat Out of Hell}}

''Saints Row IV'' was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 in North America on August 20, 2013, and worldwide on three days later.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Game of the Gen"/&gt; Preorders included a patriot-themed downloadable content pack that included flamethrower, dubstep, and rocket launcher weapons, a bald eagle jet, and an [[Uncle Sam]] outfit.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Commander in Chief"/&gt; A [[limited edition]] release of the game included a replica of the game's dubstep gun, a [[big red button|doomsday button]], and Johnny Gat statuette.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Wub Wub"/&gt; Another limited edition release, the Game of the Generation Edition, included the previous items as well as a display case for the game.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Game of the Gen"/&gt; The game was originally [[refused classification|refused ratings classification]] and effectively banned [[Australian Classification Board|in Australia]],&lt;ref name="IGN: banned"/&gt; but was later accepted when modified to remove an optional mission&lt;ref name="IGN: recall"/&gt; that involved an [[anal probe]] weapon and incentivized drug use.&lt;ref name="IGN: refused"/&gt; The country's PlayStation 4 release was later recalled due to a classification error.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: RE recall"/&gt;

The game received multiple downloadable content packs. A Season Pass, which features two new mission packs and the aforementioned anal probe weapon, was announced prior to the game's release. The first mission pack, ''Enter the Dominatrix'',&lt;ref name="Polygon: season pass"/&gt; was released October 22, 2013.&lt;ref name="EGM EtD review"/&gt; The pack was originally intended as [[Saints Row: The Third downloadable content|a mission pack for ''Saints Row: The Third'']] but evolved into the full sequel, ''Saints Row IV''. The leftover content became the sequel's first mission pack.&lt;ref name="EGM: SR4EtD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Resurrected"/&gt; It tells an alternative story about the Zin invasion wherein the Steelport simulation is hijacked by a rogue [[artificial intelligence]] called the Dominatrix. The pack's storytelling frequently breaks the [[fourth wall]] and self-referentially acknowledges its own plot holes and incongruence with the larger ''Saints Row'' story.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: EtD review"/&gt; Some scenes end in [[concept art]] or videos of Volition employees acting out the drama so as to give the game an unfinished feel. The pack also casts characters from ''Saints Row: The Third'' who did not return in the sequel.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: EtD review"/&gt; There are five missions in total,&lt;ref name="OXM EtD review"/&gt; new weapons, vehicles, and [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|computer-controlled]] support characters ("homies").&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: EtD review"/&gt; The second and final mission pack, ''How the Saints Save Christmas'', features new weapons and vehicles and a plot to save [[Santa Claus]] from the Steelport simulation. It was released in December 2013.&lt;ref name="Engadget: Christmas"/&gt; Non-mission downloadable content packs include new costumes, vehicles, and weapons, e.g., face masks of United States Presidents [[George Washington]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name="Polygon: 1 mil"/&gt;

''Saints Row IV'' was released in several summative editions.&lt;ref name="Polygon: National Treasure"/&gt; The Game of the Century edition included 20 downloadable content sets and was released May 9, 2014.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Century"/&gt; The National Treasure Edition included 29 downloadable content sets and was released on July 8, 2014.&lt;ref name="Polygon: National Treasure"/&gt; High Voltage Software [[Porting of video games|ported]] the game to [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] with all of its downloadable content as ''Saints Row IV: Re-Elected''. It was announced in late August 2014 alongside ''[[Saints Row: Gat Out of Hell]]'', a standalone ''Saints Row IV'' expansion developed by Volition in conjunction with High Voltage.&lt;ref name="Polygon: port"/&gt; Both were released in North America on January 20, 2015, and worldwide three days later,&lt;ref name="IGN: Gat new dates"/&gt; both separately and bundled together. The release included new features such as [[voice command]]s.&lt;ref name="Polygon: port"/&gt; A Linux port was presented in December 2015.

The game received generally positive reviews, according to video game [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MC-PC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MC-X360"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MC-PS3"/&gt; Reviewers praised its over-the-top humor and character customization options,&lt;ref name="IGN: review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon: review"/&gt; and criticized its lack of challenge.&lt;ref name="IGN: review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: review"/&gt; Several also commented on its "even-handed treatment" of gender, particularly female characters,&lt;ref name="Polygon: review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: review"/&gt; and spotlighted hacker and former FBI agent Kinzie Kensington's character performance.&lt;ref name="IGN: review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: review"/&gt; ''Saints Row IV'' sold over one million copies in its first week,&lt;ref name="Polygon: 1 mil"/&gt; and as of 2013, Volition has not released total sales figures.&lt;ref name="GameZone: strong"/&gt;

''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]''{{'s}} Danielle Riendeau described ''Saints Row IV'' as "big, goofy, and self-referential fun" and thought that the game accomplished what it set out to be: "an outrageous exercise in player power fantasy".&lt;ref name="Polygon: review"/&gt; She also praised the game's degree of freedom around character identity, its "dumb and lovable" narrative, and its transitions between varied sequences. Riendeau wrote that Volition "trimmed the fat" from previous games, and that their addition of superpowers "blew the constraints off a genre already known for player freedom".&lt;ref name="Polygon: review"/&gt; She considered the story funny and "as obvious as can be", but found its characters "well-realized".&lt;ref name="Polygon: review"/&gt; Riendeau particularly praised the game's "treatment of gender"—bold female characters who could pursue same-sex relationships or even switch their gender mid-game, and were not treated differently for being female—but found the game's continued association between women and sex workers "problematic" and a "vestige from the series' roots as a juvenile crime drama".&lt;ref name="Polygon: review"/&gt;

Reflecting on the series' progression, ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'s}} Chris Schilling said that ''Saints Row IV'' successfully reinvented the series yet again, with superpowers replacing the usefulness of in-game vehicles. He compared the game's exploration mechanics to that of ''[[Crackdown (video game)|Crackdown]]'', and its superpowers to the ''[[Infamous (series)|Infamous]]'' and ''[[Prototype (series)|Prototype]]'' series, and added that the game's silliness fulfilled a specific niche in gaming. Schilling wrote that the need to restock at ammo shops was a "jarring holdover" from the previous games, but appreciated the recurrence of elements such as the GPS navigation system, side mission gameplay, and city district liberation.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: review"/&gt; He regarded the game overall as artful but "gloriously dumb", like "the [[Sistine Chapel]] ceiling of stupidity".&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: review"/&gt; Schilling also commented on how he felt an urge to simply forgo the story to search for collectibles, though despite these options, the game became "wearying" over long play sessions.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: review"/&gt;

Similarly, Dan Stapleton of [[IGN]] became bored when his superhero protagonist had little "to overcome", and ultimately likened the game to "enabling [[invulnerability|god-like]] [[cheat code]]s" in its predecessor.&lt;ref name="IGN: review"/&gt; He wrote that it was very difficult to die, given the large amount of [[power-ups]] dropped by enemies, and that the otherwise praiseworthy features from ''Saints Row: The Third'' felt "vestigial" when outmoded by superpowers.&lt;ref name="IGN: review"/&gt; Stapleton said the player received the powers too early, which let the player play without caring about the city, and thus removed the "sense of place and character it had in the previous game".&lt;ref name="IGN: review"/&gt; He considered the game's large number of collectibles an acknowledgement of this hole, which while originally rewarding, quickly becomes a "chore".&lt;ref name="IGN: review"/&gt; Stapleton praised the ''Red Faction''-style Disintegrator and Abductor guns, though considered the dubstep gun an "ineffective disappointment".&lt;ref name="IGN: review"/&gt; As a symbol, though, ''Polygon'' described the dubstep gun as "iconic" of ''Saints Row IV''.&lt;ref name="Polygon: replica"/&gt;

'''Sally Patience''' is an [[Australia]]n actress and one of the country's most prominent voice-over artists.  She was born in Melbourne and grew up in the city's south eastern suburbs.  She attended the [[Victorian College of the Arts]] where she trained as a dancer.  Sally Patience worked in the dance field for several years before moving into acting and ultimately [[voice-over]] work where she continues to work today.

== Double Take ==
The Double Take shows began in Sydney in 1986 and was part of the dub parody genre in which ostensibly serious films were deliberately re-voiced in a satirical or spoof-like manner. Well-known examples of this genre include the 1960s [[Jay Ward]] TV series [[Fractured Flickers]] and [[Woody Allen|Woody Allen's]] [[What's Up, Tiger Lily?]] (1966).

Double Take performances featured distinctly Australian voicings (often with exaggerated "[[Ocker]]" and ethnic Australian accents) and many local humorous references and the films that the Double Take team sent up were presented in their entirety with scripts were carefully tailored to follow the original sequencing of the movies.  Double Take scripts were developed by Des Mangan and Lisa Sweeney and Sally Patience joined much later to become a contributor who provided voices for the films.

Mangan and Patience later gained a strong following around [[Australia]] with  Double Take shows, which were performed live in a cinema, after Mangan and Sweeney had established the troupe's reputation.  Typically seated at the back of the auditorium, using microphones plugged into the cinema's sound system, the Double Take team performed live comedic voice-overs of movies such as the American B-grade sci-fi film The Astro-zombies and the 1960s Italian low-budget '[[Sword and Sandal]]' epic Ercole, Sansone, Maciste e Ursus gli invincibili. Of necessity much of their voice-over performance was tightly scripted, but working live also allowed the team scope to occasionally insert topical jokes and references.

== Hercules Returns ==
The Double Take show was taken to a new level in the feature film [[Hercules Returns]].&lt;ref&gt;See "Making of Hercules Returns" - see www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=1384&amp;s=features.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sally Patience played a major role in the movie by contributing to its script and by providing the bulk of the female voices for the film.&lt;ref&gt;See www.imdb.com, http://movies.nytimes.com/person/1079171/Sally-Patience.&lt;/ref&gt;

The managers of the [[Hercules Returns]] project purchased the rights to both the original Ercole film and Mangan's script, hired cinematographer and film maker David Parker to help write a story to wrap around the Double Take routine. The film was Parker's first as a director and the project came in on time and on budget at a cost of less than A$1 million, and shooting was completed in just eight days.

On release of the film Urban Cinefile reported that -

::Des Mangan and Sally Patience have travelled the country - and some of the world - performing their unique show, Double Take, to great acclaim. And good houses; they've grossed over a million dollars to date, with shows in all capital cities. It was launched in Sydney in 1986, in a modest sort of way, but two years ago the show settled as a resident of Melbourne.

::They put words into people's mouths; new words that LOOK as though they belong on the screen, but in fact have jumped from Des Mangan's rampant, ribald, risky and often riotous imagination.&lt;ref&gt;See "Making of Hercules Returns" - see www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=1384&amp;s=features.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the Mark Takacs in his review of Hercules Returns on the Internet Movie Data Base comments that -
 
::"I've done it. You've probably done it. You're sitting up late one night watching an incredibly *bad* movie of some sort, and you start throwing in your own versions of the lines -- "Don't shoot me yet, I need to flex first!", things like that.

::Well, the team "Double Take" (Des Mangan and Sally Patience) has turned this concept into a hilarious and profitable business. It started March 1986 at an underground cinema in Sydney, Australia when they rescripted and redubbed Astro Zombies live to a forty-person audience. A few months later they were playing in Sydney's arthouse theatre, sold out five hours before the show, and turned away 600 people.

::Now director David Parker and producer Philip Jaroslow brings the "Double Take" team to the movies with Hercules Returns. There's really only maybe fifteen or twenty minutes of "wrapper" -- the rest of the film is the old Italian movie with double takes redubs and occasional shots of the chaos going on in the projection booth as the characters bustle to provide the live dialogue.

::The movie was quite a hit at the `93 Seattle Film Festival, and the audience I saw it with was laughing out loud throughout the movie. The general style makes me want to use adjectives like "madcap" and "zany"; it's certainly not a dark or intellectual comedy. The humor is definitely adult: Hercules grabs the queen's daughter, Labia, which prompts the queen to say "Get your hands off my Labia!" The original incredibly bad Italian sets (really fake looking leftover stuff) also adds to the fun.&lt;ref&gt;See www.imdb.com/reviews/21/2125.html.&lt;/ref&gt;"

The lead actors who appeared on screen in Hercules Returns were well-known to local Australian audiences. [[Bruce Spence]] has been one of the country's most prominent stage and screen actors since the early 1970s. [[Mary Coustas]] was a member of the popular "Wogs Out of Work" team, where she created her Greek-Australian character "Effie", and she co-starred in the popular TV sitcom [[Acropolis Now]]. [[David Argue]] was well known from his many live comedy, TV and film appearances. Director David Parker has had a long association with writer-director [[Nadia Tass]] and they have collaborated on many popular films including Malcolm.  [[Hercules Returns]] is also notable as the last screen credit for veteran actor [[Frank Thring]] (who performed the voice of Zeus) and there are also cameo appearances by Australian film critics [[David Stratton]], [[Margaret Pomeranz]] and Ivan Hutchinson.

Ironically, the 'real' stars of the film, Des Mangan and Sally Patience, do not appear on screen in the movie and their voice-overs are instead mimed by Argue, Spence and Coustas.When revoiced for the sound track for the film The voice over artists Included argue who provided Diolouge for a character. Mathew king voiced Frank thring, several other characters, and another voice over artist; assorted characters .
Des mangan had originally written the Screen play for he and Patience. But after being auditioned by parker, It was recast with actors.

== Other screen appearances ==
Sally Patience has appeared in a number of other screen roles including as a backing singer in the Australian film Billy's Holiday and in the television drama Dog's Head Bay as Dimity Todd.

== Current work ==
Sally Patience has since become one of Australia's best known [[voice-over]] artists and she regularly works on major national and local advertising campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;See www.emvoices.com.au.&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Selling out'''" is a common idiomatic pejorative expression for the compromising of a person's integrity, morality, [[wikt:authentic|authenticity]], or principles in exchange for personal gain, such as money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=sellout|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sellout|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=21 February 2012|date=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of music or art, selling out is associated with attempts to tailor material to a [[mainstream]] or commercial audience. For example, a musician who alters his material to encompass a wider audience, and in turn generates greater revenue, may be labeled by fans who pre-date the change as a "sellout." A sellout also refers to someone who gives up, or disregards, hence the term 'sells' – someone or something – for some other thing or person. The term could also be used as 'sold out' depending on the context.

==In politics==
In political movements a "sellout" is a person or group claiming to adhere to one ideology, only to follow these claims up with actions contradicting them, such as a revolutionary group claiming to fight for a particular cause, but failing to continue this upon obtaining power.

An example of political "selling out" is a political party who has formed a coalition with another party it had historically opposed, such as the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]' leader [[Nick Clegg]]'s coalition with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] after the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]] in the United Kingdom, during which he reneged on his pledge to oppose any increase in student tuition fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clegg sold out to get power, say voters|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/clegg-sold-out-to-get-power-say-voters-2083293.html|newspaper=Independent|first=Matt|last=Chorley|date=19 September 2010|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2010/09/lib-dem-clegg-poll-principles|title=Clegg "sold out" for power|first=Sophie|last=Elmhirst|publisher=New Statesman|date=19 September 2010|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music and entertainment==

===Music===
&lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY UNSOURCED CONTENT! NOT LIKING AN ARTISTS LATEST SONG IS SUBJECTIVE, NOT INDICATIVE OF SELLING OUT! --&gt;
There are two distinct forms of "selling out" in terms of music. First, there is the use of the term "sell out" to refer to those who sign for major labels or to those who licence their music to companies for use in advertising&lt;ref name=GreatSellOut&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/30/rocknroll-sellout|title=The great rock'n'roll sellout|first=Dorian|last=Lynskey|publisher=The Guardian|date=30 June 2011|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that contradicts their apparent values. Secondly, the expression can refer to those who sacrifice their musical integrity through a change in their musical sound, sometimes due to pressure from [[Music industry|major labels]]&lt;ref name=InDefense&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nyulocal.com/entertainment/2012/03/20/in-defense-of-sell-out-musicians/|title=In Defense of "Sell Out" Musicians|first=Lizzie|last=Azran|publisher=NYU Local|date=20 March 2012|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in order to gain profit by making their music more appealing to a [[mainstream]] audience.

====Record labels and advertising====

Since the time of [[big band]] radio shows there has been an established relationship between musicians and commercialisation. There had been some signs of resistance to this model as early as the 1960s, when gospel group [[The Blind Boys of Alabama]] refused to sign record deals to record secular music.&lt;ref&gt;http://ktep.org/post/clarence-fountain-leader-and-founding-member-blind-boys-alabama-dies-88&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the [[punk subculture]] in the 1970s that the notion that musicians should be completely independent of commercial influences began to increase in popularity.&lt;ref name=GreatSellOut /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cnet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13526_3-20002543-27.html|title=Can bands sell out anymore?|first=Matt|last=Rosoff|publisher=Cnet|date=14 April 2010|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This partly manifested itself in the reluctance of bands to sign for major labels, as this would include taking part in activities that were seen as crass and overly commercial.&lt;ref name=Science&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7901003.stm|title=The science of selling out|first=Stephen|last=Dowling|publisher=BBC|date=20 February 2009|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This continued into the 1980s, when bands were scorned by [[fanzines]] for signing with major labels as the mainstream success this would bring was symptomatic of the general decay in culture.&lt;ref name=GreatSellOut /&gt; However, after a number of bands maintained the quality of their records after signing for a major label, by the end of the 1980s the focus on "selling out" shifted to advertising.&lt;ref name=GreatSellOut /&gt;

The attitude held by those who disliked the idea of "selling out" towards advertising was negative; comedian [[Bill Hicks]] claimed that any band who licensed their music for advertising was "off the artistic roll call forever",&lt;ref name=GreatSellOut /&gt;&lt;ref name=Science /&gt; and [[Neil Young]] mocked the fact that songs became associated with brands on his 1988 album ''[[This Note's for You]]''.&lt;ref name=GreatSellOut /&gt; However, although it was possible for fans to feel a sense of betrayal due to the relationship they developed with the song and artist, when artists did allow their music to be used for commercials others considered the advertised product to be more appealing.&lt;ref name=Science /&gt; As CD sales fell and record companies became unwilling or unable to afford the push new bands needed to become established, sponsorship of bands by major companies began to be seen as more acceptable, with even minor record labels devoting time and money towards marketing deals with well-known brands.&lt;ref name=Cnet /&gt;

By the 2010s the use of licensing of artists in commercials had become an accepted part of the music industry, and even those who would previously have been considered part of the 1970s resistance to "selling out" have been used in advertising products, such as former [[Sex Pistols]] frontman [[John Lydon]] advertising Country Life [[butter]] and [[Iggy Pop]] endorsing car insurance.&lt;ref name= Science /&gt; Consequently, it has been suggested&lt;ref name=Cnet /&gt;&lt;ref name=Risk&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/monitormix/2009/11/risk_management_can_an_artist.html|title=Risk Management: Can An Artist Sell Out When There Are No Boundaries?|first=Carrie|last=Brownstein|publisher=NPR Music|date=11 November 2009|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the acceptance of music in advertising is generational, as younger listeners are comfortable with the relationship to the point of indifference&lt;ref name=Science /&gt;&lt;ref name=Risk /&gt; whilst those who have seen the industry evolve still reject it.&lt;ref name=Cnet /&gt;&lt;ref name=Science /&gt;

====Musical integrity====
[[File:Metallica 46.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Metallica playing live at Illinois in 2004.]]
Another definition of "selling out" refers to putting aside musical quality or original intentions in favor of commercial success,&lt;ref name=Anti&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antimusic.com/lowdown/05/integrity.shtml|title=The Art of Selling Out: Compromising the Music|first=Trent|last=McMartin|publisher=antimusic|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a distinction is made for those who achieve success without changing their original sound.&lt;ref name=InDefense /&gt; The difference between the two is often subjective.&lt;ref name=Anti /&gt; Whilst artists may change their musical direction for commercial reasons, such as pressure from major labels who require songs to appeal to mass markets,&lt;ref name=InDefense /&gt; a change in sound may also be part of a natural progression of creative maturity.&lt;ref name=Science /&gt;

An example of artists being accused of "selling out" is the band [[Metallica]], whose [[Metallica (album)|1991 eponymous album]] has been considered the turning point in the band's musical direction;&lt;ref name=Review&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/8b8c|title=Metallica (The Black Album) Review|first=Sid|last=Smith|publisher=BBC|date=18 April 2007|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the band members were called the "poster boys for musical un-integrity" after the band attempted to sue fans who were downloading their music through [[Napster]].&lt;ref name=Lulu &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/10/metallicas-lulu-problem-why-dont-they-just-sell-out-again/247295/|title=Metallica's 'Lulu' Problem: Why Don't They Just Sell Out Again?|first=Daniel|last=Snyder|publisher=The Atlantic|date=25 October 2011|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album, known as ''The Black Album'', saw critics&lt;ref name=Review /&gt; and [[Bob Rock]],&lt;ref name=Rock&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/metallicas-black-album-track-by-track-485030#!1|title=Metallica's Black Album track-by-track|first=Joe|last=Bosso|publisher=MusicRadar|date=1 August 2011|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the album’s [[Record producer|producer]], acknowledged that there was a move away from the band's previous sound. Rock claimed that the change stemmed from the band’s desire to "make the leap to the big, big leagues",&lt;ref name=Rock /&gt; whilst some fans blamed Rock himself, going as far to eventually create an internet petition demanding the band cut their ties with him.&lt;ref name=Review /&gt; However, other fans did not consider the change in sound to be significant enough to be considered "selling out,"&lt;ref name=Anti /&gt; and others accepted the change as part of a natural evolution of the band’s style.&lt;ref name=Geeks&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2011/08/13/metallica-20th-anniversary-of-the-black-album/|title=Metallica: 20th Anniversary Of The ‘Black Album’|publisher=Geeks of Doom|date=13 August 2011|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately ''The Black Album'' became the band’s most commercially successful release,&lt;ref name=Anti /&gt; going [[Music recording sales certification|16x platinum]].&lt;ref name=Lulu /&gt; The differing reaction by fans to the album demonstrates the difficulty in labelling an artist as a "sellout" objectively.

"[[Poseur]]" is a pejorative term, often used in the [[Punk subculture|punk]], [[Heavy metal subculture|heavy metal]], [[hip hop]], and [[goth subculture|goth]] [[subculture]]s, to describe a person who copies the dress, speech, and/or mannerisms of a group or subculture, generally for attaining acceptability within the group or for popularity among various other groups, yet who is deemed not to share or understand the values or philosophy of the subculture.
 
While this perceived [[wikt:inauthentic|inauthenticity]] is viewed with scorn and contempt by members of the subculture, the definition of the term and to whom it should be applied is subjective. While the term is most associated with the 1970s- and 1980s-era punk and [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] subculture, English use of the term originates in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=poseur Definition of poseur] at Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; A hardcore punk band that signed a lucrative contract with a major label would probably be labelled as poseurs.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Film and television===
In film and television "selling out" refers to compromising the content of produced media, primarily for financial reasons; for example, introducing [[product placement]].

Product placement, or embedded marketing, is the placement of brands or products in media in order to advertise,&lt;ref name=Chron&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/concept-embedded-marketing-product-placement-20278.html|title=Concept of Embedded Marketing &amp; Product Placement|first=Neil|last=Kokemuller|publisher=Chron|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been in television from almost the very beginning, but has increased with introduction of devices such as [[Digital video recorder|DVR]]s which allow viewers, and therefore consumers, to fast-forward through adverts.&lt;ref name=tvg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/product-placement-tv-1042607.aspx|title=Product Placement: Is TV Selling Out?|first=Michael|last=Schneider|publisher=TVguide.com|date=31 January 2012|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the idea that product placement is a form of selling out is [[Eurocentrism|Anglocentric]],&lt;ref name=Pisfor&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/p-is-for-product-placement-as-tv-shows-sell-out-to-advertisers-2213863.html|title=P is for product placement as TV shows sell out to advertisers|first=Ian|last=Burrell|publisher=The Independent|date=14 February 2011|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as American television shows such as ''[[American Idol]]'' and ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|Celebrity Apprentice]]'' recorded over 500 examples of brand integration in 2011 according to [[Nielsen Company|Nielsen]].&lt;ref name=tvg /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pisfor /&gt;

===Comedy===
[[File:Jesus is coming.. Look Busy (George Carlin).jpg|thumb|right|200px|George Carlin has been accused of being a sellout for appearing in commercials for MCI, a company he had previously criticized.]]
[[Stand-up comedians]] occasionally face accusations of "selling out." Comedians who start out in comedy clubs might often use foul language and [[blue humor]] in their routines. A comic who alters his or her routine by "sugar-coating" his language and using less-offensive material to obtain mainstream success may be accused of "selling out."

[[George Carlin]] was accused of being a "sellout" for appearing in television commercials for [[MCI Inc.|MCI]]'s [[10-10-220]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gettingit.com/article/394|title=Gettingit.com: The Happy Pessimist|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530071427/http://www.gettingit.com/article/394|archivedate=30 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shadowculture.com/adman/admn1129.html|title=The adMan - A Knee-Jerk to the Groin of American Advertising|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teevee.org/archive/1999/01/18/index.html|title=1-800-SELL-OUT|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704090058/http://www.teevee.org/archive/1999/01/18/index.html|archivedate=4 July 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlin had previously spoken of his dislike for MCI's commercials in his 1996 album ''[[Back in Town (George Carlin album)|Back in Town]]''. In his 1999 album ''[[You Are All Diseased]]'', which contains rants against advertising and business, Carlin admits the dichotomy but makes no attempt to explain himself, stating, "You're just gonna have to figure that shit out on your own." In interviews, Carlin revealed he appeared in the advertisements to help pay off a large tax debt to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22917&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bankrate.com/csites/news/investing/20010316a.asp|title=Carlin's got his act together, on stage and off|publisher=[[Bankrate.com]]|author=Getlen, Larry|date=2001-03-16|accessdate=2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian/actress [[Janeane Garofalo]] has described herself as a "sellout" based on her participation with the TV show ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' playing [[Janis Gold]]. Garofalo initially turned down the role because of the way the show depicted torture scenes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/24/24-its-a-chloejanis-rivalryor-26069.aspx|title=24: It's A Chloe-Janis Rivalry--Or Not, As It Seems|date=February 2, 2009|publisher=Buddy TV|accessdate=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; however changed her mind later on, saying in an interview, “Being unemployed and being flattered that someone wanted to work with me outweighed my stance [on torture].”&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/16/arts/television/16twen.html?_r=1|title=Deep Inside the Grim ‘24,’ Two Comics’ Inside Joke|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|date=February 15, 2009|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garofalo admitted to "selling out" for losing weight in order to gain more acting work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Janeane Garofalo on Botox, Spanx, and the Troubles of Finding Work As a 45-Year-Old Former Slacker Icon&amp;#124;|work=Vulture|publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|author=Yuan, Jada|date=2010-02-19|accessdate=2012-11-23|url=http://www.vulture.com/2010/02/janeane_garofalo_on_botox_span.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the term==
An artist may also be accused of "selling out" after changes in artistic direction.  This conclusion is often due to the perception that the reason for the artist changing artistic style or direction was simply potential material gain. This ignores other causes of artistic [[Personal development|development]], which may lead an artist in new directions from those that attracted their original fans.  Artists' improvements in musical skill or change in taste may also account for the change.

Other times, artists (including those with politically oriented messages) resent the term on the grounds that the perceived desire for material gain is simply a result of the band seeking to expand its message. To such artists, ''not'' going mainstream or signing to a bigger label to avoid "selling out" prevents them from addressing a wider audience, regardless of whether or not there is any real artistic change, and arbitrarily hampers the artists' course of mainstream success. Such an accusation, then, assumes that mainstream success must be against the artists' original intentions. For example, when questioned about signing to a major label, [[Rage Against the Machine]] answered "We're not interested in preaching to just the converted. It's great to play abandoned squats run by anarchists, but it's also great to be able to reach people with a revolutionary message, people from [[Granada Hills, Los Angeles|Granada Hills]] to [[Stuttgart]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ratm.de/faq/ragefaq.html#1_9|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526032423/http://www.ratm.de/faq/ragefaq.html#1_9|title=Rage Against The Machine Online : F.A.Q.|author=RinO|archivedate=26 May 2006|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, when confronted with the accusation of "selling out" in 2001, [[Mike Dirnt]] of [[Green Day]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"If there's a formula to selling out, I think every band in the world would be doing it," he said. "The fact that you write good songs and you sell too many of them, if everybody in the world knew how to do that they'd do it. It's not something we chose to do...The fact was we got to a point that we were so big that tons of people were showing up at punk-rock clubs, and some clubs were even getting shut down because too many were showing up. We had to make a decision: either break up or remove ourselves from that element. And I'll be damned if I was going to flip fucking burgers. I do what I do best. Selling out is compromising your musical intention and I don't even know how to do that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/archives/2001/jul/20/512106831.html?%22green+day%22 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930031510/http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/archives/2001/jul/20/512106831.html?%22green+day%22 |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts have debated whether national politics in the [[United States of America]] is {{as of | 2016 | alt = currently}} in the era of a '''Sixth Party System''', or whether the [[Fifth Party System]] continues in some form to the present. Opinions also differ on when a Sixth Party System may have begun, with suggested dates ranging from the 1960s to the 1990s. Maisel and Brewer (2011) argue that the consensus among specialists is that the Sixth System is underway based on American electoral politics since the 1960s:
{{quote|Although most in the field now believe we are in a sixth party system, there is a fair amount of disagreement  about how exactly we arrived at this new system and about its particular contours. Scholars do, however, agree that there has been significant change in American electoral politics since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1= L. Sandy Maisel|author2= Mark D.

The perceived Sixth Party System is characterized by an electoral shift from the electoral coalitions of the Fifth Party System during the New Deal: the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] became the dominant party in the South, rural areas, and suburbs; while the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] increasingly started to assemble a coalition of African-Americans, Latinos and white urban Progressives. A critical factor was the major transformation of the political system in the [[Reagan Era]] or Age of Reagan of the 1980s and beyond, led by [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref&gt;Sean Wilentz, ''The Age of Reagan: A History, 1974–2008 (2008)''&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=February 2016}}

However, no clear disciplinary consensus has emerged pinpointing an electoral event responsible for shifting presidential and congressional control since the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] of the 1930s, when the Fifth Party System emerged. Much of the work published on the subject has come from [[political science|political scientist]]s explaining the events of their time either as the imminent breakup of the Fifth Party System, and the installation of a new one; or in terms of such transition taking place some time ago.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Paulson (2006) argues that a decisive realignment took place in the late 1960s.&lt;/ref&gt; Other current writing on the Fifth Party System expresses admiration of its longevity: the first four systems lasted about 30 to 40 years each, which would have implied that the early twenty-first century should see a Seventh Party System.&lt;ref name=Aldrich&gt;Aldrich (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible, as argued in Jensen (1981) and elsewhere, that the party system has given way, not to a new party system, but to a period of dealignment in politics. Previous party systems ended with the dominant party losing two consecutive House elections by large margins, and also losing a presidential election coinciding with or immediately following (in 1896) the second House election—decisive electoral evidence of political realignment. Such a shift took place between 2006 and 2008 in favor of the Democrats, but the Republicans won the elections of 2010 by their biggest landslide since 1946 and finished the 2014 elections with their greatest number of House seats since 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sean Sullivan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/12/17/mcsally-win-gives-gop-historic-majority-in-house|title=McSally win gives GOP historic majority in House|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=2014-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinions differ on when the Sixth Party System began, varying from elections of 1966–68 or the 1980s when both parties began to become more unified and partisan, to the 1990s over cultural divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sixthpartysystem.wordpress.com/2011/05/19/what-is-the-sixth-party-system|title=What is the sixth party system}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/FORUM/index.php?topic=147219.0|title=The Sixth Party System in American Politics (1976–2012)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketfailure.wordpress.com/2013/07/24/perpetual-crisis-and-the-sixth-party-system|title=Perpetual Crisis and the Sixth Party System|author=Alex Copulsky|date=July 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig argues for the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 elections]], when [[Richard Nixon]] won a 49-state landslide. He notes that, "There seems to be consensus on the appropriate name for the sixth party system.... Changes that occurred during the 1960s were so great and so pervasive that they cry out to be called a critical-election period. The new system of candidate-centered parties is so distinct and so portentous that one can no longer deny its existence or its character."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen C. Craig, ''Broken Contract? Changing Relationships between Americans and Their Government'' (1996) p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History'' dates the start in 1980, with the election of Reagan and a Republican Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kazin, et al. eds, ''The Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History'' (2009) Vol. 2, pg. 288&lt;/ref&gt;

One possible explanation for the lack of an agreed upon beginning of the Sixth Party System is that there was a brief period of [[dealignment]] immediately preceding it. Dealignment is a trend or process whereby a large portion of the electorate abandons its previous partisan affiliation without developing a new one to replace it.

A period of dealignment would certainly explain the voting patterns of the [[Southern United States|Southern states]] during this time period.  In [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]], [[Richard Nixon]] barely eked out a popular vote victory in the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] with 35% of the vote. In comparison, [[George Wallace]] and [[Hubert Humphrey]] received 34% and 31%, respectively. In [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972]], Republicans won the South in a landslide, only to see the region swing dramatically back into the Democratic column [[United States presidential election, 1976|four years later]] when native son [[Jimmy Carter]] ran for president. It was not until the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Revolution]] in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]] that the South became a Republican stronghold on the presidential level, though Democratic Arkansas Governor [[Bill Clinton]] had some success in the South in his two election victories.

Assuming the Sixth Party System spanned from 1981 to 2017, it would corroborate and explain a number of items. First, it would fit [[Walter Dean Burnham]]'s argument for a 36-year "cycle" of [[Realigning election|realignments]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Analysis-When-political-parties-realign/63011011291556/|title=Analysis: When political parties realign|work=UPI|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]], [[George H. W. Bush]] was first elected to serve as vice-president under [[Ronald Reagan]]. The Reagan-Bush ticket was re-elected in a landslide in [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984]]. Bush went on to win the presidency in his own right in [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988]], as did his son, [[George W. Bush]], in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] and [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]]. 

Between the Bushes was the presidency of [[Bill Clinton]], who was elected and re-elected in [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]] and [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996]], respectively.

==Political history==
{{main|History of the United States (1964–1980)|History of the United States (1980–1991)|History of the United States (1991–2008)|History of the United States (2008–present)}}
With support for the 1960s [[Civil Rights Movement]] growing, [[Richard Nixon]] devised the so-called "[[Southern strategy]]" to win the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 elections]] for himself and other Republican candidates in the [[Southern United States|South]], ending a century of Democratic dominance in the region. Nixon also won the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 re-elections]] in landslide. The [[Watergate scandal]] forced Nixon to resign, and [[Jimmy Carter]] defeated Nixon's Vice President, [[Gerald Ford]], in 1976.

[[Ronald Reagan]] produced a major [[realigning election|realignment]] with his [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|1980]] and [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984]] landslide elections. The Democrats had control of Congress with two breaks since 1932. The Republican Party took control of the Senate in 1980 and both houses in 1994. It built a strong base in the white South, while losing the Northeastern base of the liberal and moderate Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;Nicol C. Rae, ''The Decline and Fall of the Liberal Republicans: From 1952 to the Present'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan's economic policies (dubbed "[[Reaganomics]]") and the implementation of the [[Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981]] called for sharply reduced federal budgets, sharply reduced federal regulation of businesses, and sharp cuts in the federal income tax rates, the latter two of which were partially achieved. The top marginal income tax rate on high incomes was lowered from 70% to 28% over the course of seven years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdoc.cfm?index=5324&amp;type=0&amp;sequence=0|title=Effective Federal Tax Rates: 1979–2001|publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis|date=July 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; with regulations on [[Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984|cable communication]], [[Surface Freight Forwarder Deregulation Act of 1986|shipping]], and [[Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act|savings and loan associations]] being reduced.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

The [[Highway Revenue Act of 1982|federal fuel tax]] and [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax]] were both increased, and the [[Tax Reform Act of 1986]], while reducing income taxes on upper-income individuals, increased taxes on lower-income individuals, capital gains, and corporate income. Regulation of [[Firearm Owners Protection Act|firearms]] was increased and a federal standard for regulations on [[Indian gaming]] was [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act|created]]. Annual federal spending increased from about $1.6 trillion in 1981 to about $2.1 trillion in 1988. Increased federal spending, coupled with major taxation legislation that reduced tax revenue, caused the federal government's public debt to increase from 31.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1981 to 49.8% of GDP in 1988, with a tripling of the federal government's nominal debt during that time period. Following the [[early 1980s recession]], economic growth and inflation maintained an average of about 4% per annum for the remainder of the decade, and the unemployment rate gradually decreased to nearly 5% by the end of the decade.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

As the [[Cold War]] drew to a close, [[George H W Bush]] promised to [[Read my lips: no new taxes|not increase taxes]] as he won the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 election]], but broke his promise in office in the 1990 federal budget. This led to [[Ross Perot]]'s candidacy in the [[Ross Perot presidential campaign, 1992|1992]] and [[Ross Perot presidential campaign, 1996|1996]], as a main talking point of his campaign was balancing the federal budget. But [[Bill Clinton]] won both the elections, and even managed a surplus towards the end of his second term. However, despite this, Clinton's Vice President [[Al Gore]] lost in the disputed [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 election]] to [[George W Bush]], losing in the official count of [[United States presidential election in Florida, 2000|Florida]] as well as Clinton and Gore's home states of Arkansas and Tennessee. Gore attempted to arrange a recount of the controversial ballot in Florida, but this was ultimately struck down by the Supreme Court.

==Characteristics==
{{Unsourced|section|date=September 2017}}
Some of the characteristics which this era displays are:
* Increased role of technology by television and later the internet
* Increased role of the financing of electioneering communications in the electoral process (the issue of [[Campaign finance in the United States|money in politics]])
* Seemingly increased partisanship, with heated rhetoric and confrontations, and congressional gridlock
* Reduced concentration of the Democratic Party on economics or labor as compared to the New Deal or Progressive Era
* Greater Republican Party emphasis on values than in the previous system
* Candidates de facto chosen through caucuses and primaries instead of nomination conventions
* Rise and fall of [[Ross Perot]]'s [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] and the near collapse of the system between 1991 and 2000.

==Issues==
Harris and Tichenor argue:
:At the level of issues, the sixth party system was characterized by clashes over what rights to extend to various groups in society. The initial manifestations of these clashes were race-based school desegregation and affirmative action, but women's issues, especially abortion rights, soon gained equal billing....To these were added in the 1980s environmental defense and in the 1990s gay rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard A. Harris|author2=Daniel J. Tichenor|title=A History of the U.S. Political System: Ideas, Interests, and Institutions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1q0hcy1F2dMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA98|year= 2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=98|isbn=9781851097180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voter coalitions==
New voter coalitions included the emergence of the "religious right"—a combination of right-wing Catholics and Evangelical Protestants united on opposition to abortion and gay marriage. Southern white voters started voting for Republican presidential candidates in the 1960s, and Republican state and local candidates in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;J. David Woodard, ''The New Southern Politics'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a graph of the movement of Southern white voters see {{cite book|author=Brian F. Schaffner|title=Politics, Parties, and Elections in America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7kcTUn1G40C&amp;pg=PA341|year=2010|edition=7th|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=31|isbn=9780495899167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules of the game==
New rule changes involved campaign financing, as very large sums were raised and candidates spent much of their energy focused on raising money behind the scenes.  New campaign technologies involved the Internet, but television advertising continued to grow in importance, overshadowing the Internet as a campaign tool. [[Howard Dean]] in 2004 demonstrated that the Internet could be used to organize and finance a campaign, and this model was followed by most of the candidates for the 2008 election, with [[Barack Obama]] the most successful. In 2016, [[Bernie Sanders]] also financed his campaign heavily from small-dollar donations generated online. &lt;ref&gt;Anthony Corrado and Molly Corbett, “Rewriting the Playbook on Presidential Campaign Financing,” in ''Campaigning for President, 2008'', edited by Dennis W. Johnson (Routledge, 2009) pp. 126–46&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Speed learning''' is a collection of methods of [[learning]] which attempt to attain higher rates of learning without unacceptable reduction of [[Understanding|comprehension]] or [[Storage (memory)|retention]]. It is closely related to [[speed reading]], but encompasses other methods of learning, such as [[observation]], [[listening]], [[conversation]], [[question]]ing, and [[Introspection|reflection]].

The general approach is to use procedures or a sequence of techniques that have been shown to provide a more efficient path to attaining the same goal. Some of the techniques have existed since ancient times (e.g. [[Mnemonic]]s) whilst others are a result of more recent scientific research (e.g. [[Forgetting curve|Forgetting Curves]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bremer|first1=Rod|title=The Manual: A Guide to the Ultimate Study Method|publisher=Fons Sapientiae Publishing|isbn=978-0993496424|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
[[Psychologist]]s and [[education]]al specialists have long sought methods for improving not just the quality of learning, the comprehension and retention of knowledge, but the rate at which knowledge can be acquired, especially in an age in which the amount of information people need to deal with is growing rapidly and threatening to overwhelm them.

The limited "channel capacity" of human individuals has also led to investigation of rapid knowledge acquisition and appropriate dissemination of it by organizations. This is an important part of the science of [[management]]. It generally involves dividing the knowledge-acquisition effort among multiple individuals, each of whom becomes a "subject matter expert" on some specialized area of the larger topic, then having them extract and abstract the more important findings and recommendations from that investigation into reports to and discussions with others in the organization. This filtering process necessarily involves some loss of detail, but if done well should enable the organization or its managers to make high-quality, error-avoiding decisions. On the other hand, the loss of detail as abstraction of information ascends a hierarchical organization can lead to distortion that results in bad decision-making.

'''Strip map and sample''' is a method of [[archaeological excavation]] applied in the [[United Kingdom]] to preserve archaeological remains by record in the face of development threat. It involves machine stripping of an area, plotting observed features onto a [[Archaeological plan|site plan]] and then partially excavating those features ([[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]]).

Strip map and sample is undertaken when a site is to be destroyed by development and no satisfactory method of preserving archaeological remains ''in situ'' can be devised or adequate funding and time has not been factored into development project planning to allow for a full archaeological investigation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2113">In [[linguistics]], a '''syntagma''' is an elementary constituent segment within a text. Such a segment can be a [[phoneme]], a [[word]], a grammatical [[phrase]], a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], or an event within a larger narrative structure, depending on the level of analysis. Syntagmatic analysis involves the study of relationships (rules of combination) among syntagmas.

At the lexical level, syntagmatic structure in a [[language]] is the combination of words according to the rules of [[syntax]] for that language. For example, English uses determiner + adjective + noun, e.g. ''the big house''. Another language might use determiner + noun + adjective (Spanish {{lang|es|la casa grande}}) and therefore have a different syntagmatic structure.

At a higher level, narrative structures feature a realistic temporal flow guided by tension and relaxation; thus, for example, events or rhetorical figures may be treated as syntagmas of epic structures.

Syntagmatic structure is often contrasted with paradigmatic structure. In [[semiotics]], "[[syntagmatic analysis]]" is [[semantic analysis (linguistics)|analysis]] of syntax or surface structure (syntagmatic structure), rather than [[paradigm]]s as in [[paradigmatic analysis]]. Analysis is often achieved through [[commutation test (semiotics)|commutation test]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/S4B/sem04.html | title=Semiotics for Beginners: Syntagmatic Analysis | author=Daniel Chandler | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000512022604/http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/S4B/sem04.html | archivedate=May 12, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic''''' is an [[archaeology|archaeological]] study of the material evidence for [[ritual]] and [[magic (paranormal)|magical practices]] in Europe, containing a particular emphasis on London and South East England. It was written by the English archaeologist [[Ralph Merrifield]], the former deputy director of the [[Museum of London]], and first published by [[B.T. Batsford]] in 1987.

Merrifield opens ''The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic'' by discussing how archaeologists have understood magic and ritual practices in past societies, opining that on the whole it had been a neglected area of study. Looking at the archaeological evidence for ritual activity in the [[British Iron Age|pre-Roman Iron Age]] and the [[Roman Britain|Roman Iron Age]] of Britain, he discusses [[animal sacrifice|animal]] and [[human|human sacrifice]], as well as the offering of [[votive deposits]] in rivers and other bodies of water. He moves on to explore the rituals surrounding death and burial, suggesting areas where this ritual activity is visible in the burial record of multiple societies. Merrifield goes on to discuss the archaeological evidence for ritual practices in Christian Europe, highlighting areas of ritual continuance from earlier pagan periods, in particular the deposition of metal goods in water. Looking at the evidence for foundation deposits in European buildings that likely had magico-religious purposes, he then looks at several examples of written charms and spells which have survived in the archaeological record.

Upon publication, ''The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic'' received predominantly positive reviews in academic peer-reviewed journals such as ''[[The Folklore Society|Folklore]]'' and ''The Antiquaries Journal''. In ensuing years, the book has been widely cited by scholars as an influential and pioneering text in the study of the archaeology of ritual and magic.

==Background==
[[Ralph Merrifield]] (1913&amp;ndash;1995) was born and raised in [[Brighton]], and, following an education at [[Varndean Grammar School]], he worked at [[Brighton Museum]]. Gaining a [[University of London International Programmes|London External Degree]] in [[anthropology]] in 1935, he developed a lifelong interest in the religious and magical beliefs of England. After serving in the [[Royal Air Force]] during the [[Second World War]], he returned to working at Brighton Museum, but in 1950 was appointed Assistant Keeper of the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall Museum]] in the [[City of London]]. Over a six-month period in 1956 and 1957, he was stationed in [[Accra]], Ghana, where he worked at the [[National Museum of Ghana]], organising the collection in preparation for the country's independence from the British Empire in March 1957. Returning to the Guildhall Museum, Merrifield compiled the first detailed study of Roman London for 35 years, which was published as ''The Roman City of London'' (1965). Following the creation of the Museum of London in 1975, he became its Deputy Director, a post which he held until his retirement in 1978.&lt;ref name="Marsden 1995"/&gt;

In the preface of ''The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic'', Merrifield noted that the book's bias was to the archaeology of London, and that this was particularly evident in its use of illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mer87|Merrifield 1987]]. p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;
He dedicated the book to the memory of H.S. Toms, the former Curator of Brighton Museum and a one-time assistant to the archaeologist [[Augustus Pitt Rivers]]; in his dedication, Merrifield noted that Toms had been his "first mentor in archaeology and folk studies".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mer87|Merrifield 1987]]. un-numbered page.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his preface, Merrifield noted that while archaeologists studying prehistoric periods have paid increasing attention to the evidence for ritual and magic in the archaeological record, their counterparts working in later historical periods have failed to follow their lead. Presenting this book as a rectifier, he outlines his intentions and the study's limitations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mer87|Merrifield 1987]]. pp. xiii&amp;ndash;xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter one, "Ritual and the archaeologist", begins by describing the ritual deposits from the pre-Roman Iron Age sites of [[Cadbury Castle, Somerset|Cadbury Castle]] and [[Danebury]], [[hillforts]] in southern Britain. Merrifield laments the fact that the majority of archaeologists, particularly those studying literate, historical periods, have avoided ritual explanations for unusual phenomenon in the archaeological record; he believes that they exhibit a "ritual phobia". He contrasts this view with that of those archaeologists studying the [[Neolithic British Isles|Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age Britain]], who have widely accepted the ritual uses of [[chambered tomb]]s and [[stone circles]]. He specifies particular definitions for words such as "ritual", "religion" and "superstition", arguing that such terms must be used with precision by archaeologists. Offering a case study, he describes how Neolithic stone axes were adopted as amulets or talismans in the later Roman Iron Age onward in Britain, and that as such archaeologists should expect to find them in non-prehistoric contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mer87|Merrifield 1987]]. pp. 1&amp;ndash;21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Swinside (p4160146).jpg|left|thumb|300px|alt=A photo of large stones arranged in a circle at Swinside, England|Merrifield noted that archaeologists studying Neolithic and Bronze Age Europe regularly recognised the ritual significance of monuments, such as this stone circle at [[Swinside]] in the [[Lake District]], England, but that their counterparts studying later periods of history often neglected to consider ritual explanations.]]

In the second chapter, "Offerings to earth and water in Pre-Roman and Roman Times", Merrifield explores the various forms of archaeological evidence for [[Votive offering|ritual deposits]] in the [[British Iron Age|pre-Roman Iron Age]] and the [[Roman Britain|Roman Iron Age]] of Britain. He provides an overview of the evidence for [[animal sacrifice|animal]] and [[human sacrifice]], as well as that in support of ritual offerings in bodies of water such as the [[River Thames]]. Merrifield deals with [[votive deposit]]s on land, in particular looking at the evidence for deposition in ditches, shafts and wells. He rounds off the chapter by examining evidence for Iron Age rituals that took place at the commencement and termination of building constructions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mer87|Merrifield 1987]]. pp. 22&amp;ndash;58.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter three, "Rituals of Death", deals with the religious rituals accompanying death and burial, and their visibility in the archaeological record. It explains the three main ways which human communities have dealt with the corpses of the dead: through exposing them to elements and scavengers, through [[inhumation]] and through [[cremation]]. Looing at beliefs surrounding the [[afterlife]], Merrifield discusses ways in which these beliefs might be visible in the archaeological record, such as through the deposition of [[grave goods]]. Discussing evidence for rituals of separation through which the deceased is separated from the world of the living, including those that deal with the [[decapitation]] of the body, Merrifield then looks at the effect of Christianity on burials in Europe, arguing that it brought a new intimacy with the dead through the collection of [[relics]], which was in contrast to the pagan beliefs of the Roman Empire, which portrayed the deceased as unclean.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mer87|Merrifield 1987]]. pp. 59&amp;ndash;82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth chapter, "From Paganism to Christianity", explores the continuing practice of ritual in Christian Europe. Discussing the early Roman Catholic Church's demonisation of pagan deities, Merrifield states that the Church continued propagating a form of [[polytheism]] through the "cult of the blessed dead", the veneration of saints and martyrs, throughout the Middle Ages. Discussing the ritual use of Christian relics, he also looks at votive offerings that were presented in a Christian context at shrines and churches, paying particular reference to the tradition of offering bent coins to shrines in Late Medieval England. Examining the construction of churches on earlier pagan ritual sites, he deals with evidence for the destruction of pagan statues by the early Christians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mer87|Merrifield 1987]]. pp. 83&amp;ndash;106.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sator Square at Oppède.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=A sator square etched in stone|An example of the Sator Square, a magical practice widely found throughout Europe from ancient times to the present day; this example is from in [[Oppède]] in France.]]

Chapter five, "Survivals, revivals and reinterpretations", continues Merrifield's exploration of ritual practices in Christian Europe. He examines Late- and Post-Medieval items that have been deposited in rivers, including swords and pilgrimage souvenirs, speculating that their deposition might represent a survival from the pagan tradition of casting votive offerings into water. He speculates that the contemporary practice of throwing a coin into a fountain for good luck is a further survival of the custom. He then discusses the evidence for ritual foundation deposits under buildings, noting the widespread Medieval deposition of an animal's head or jaw in a construction's foundations, presumably for protective magical purposes. Proceeding to deal with the Late- and Post-Medieval deposition of pots under foundations, he looks at their place in churches, where it was believed that they aided the acoustics. Continuing with this theme, he discusses the British folk custom of burying a horse's head under the floor to improve a building's acoustics, speculating as to whether this was a survival of the pagan foundation deposit custom. Rounding off the chapter, Merrifield examines at magical items that have been intentionally placed in the walls, chimneys and roofs of buildings in Britain, in particular the widespread use of dead cats and old shoes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mer87|Merrifield 1987]]. pp. 107&amp;ndash;136.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sixth chapter, "Written spells and charms", Merrifield discusses the use of the written word in magical contexts. Highlighting archaeological examples from the ancient [[Greco-Roman world|Graeco-Roman world]], he looks at inscriptions on lead tablets that were buried in cemeteries and [[amphitheatre]]s, both places associated with the dead. Moving on to the use of [[magic square]]s, Merrifield highlights various examples of the [[Sator square]] in archaeological contexts, before also discussing squares that contained numerical data with [[astrology|astrological]] significance. He rounds off the chapter with an examination of Post-Medieval curses and charms containing the written word, citing examples that have been found by archaeologists across Britain, hidden inside various parts of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mer87|Merrifield 1987]]. pp. 137&amp;ndash;158.&lt;/ref&gt; In the seventh chapter, "Charms against witchcraft", he deals with archaeological evidence for a variety of Early Modern and Modern British spells designed to ward off malevolent witchcraft. After briefly discussing the role of holed stone charms, he looks at the evidence for [[witch bottles]], making reference to their relation to beliefs about [[familiar spirit|witches' familiars]]. Proceeding to focus on 19th- and 20th-century examples, Merrifield discusses the case of [[James Murrell]], an English [[cunning folk in Britain|cunning man]], and his involvement with the witch bottle tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mer87|Merrifield 1987]]. pp. 159&amp;ndash;184.&lt;/ref&gt; Merrifield's final chapter, "The ritual of superstition: recognition and potential for study", provides an overview of the entire book, highlighting the evidence of ritual continuity from pre-Christian periods to the present day. Pointing out what he sees as areas of further exploration for archaeologists, he calls for "systematic investigation" of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mer87|Merrifield 1987]]. pp. 185&amp;ndash;195.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and recognition==

===Academic reviews===
''The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic'' was reviewed by John Hutchings for the ''Folklore'' journal, the published arm of [[The Folklore Society]]. He highlighted how the work would be of benefit to [[Folkloristics|folklorists]], by putting various charms then in museum exhibits&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; such as dead cats, buried shoes and witch bottles&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; into the wider context of ritual activity. He opined that it was "a little disappointing" that the examples were almost all from London and the [[Home Counties]], but described the book as "lucidly written, carefully argued, and well illustrated."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut89|Hutchings 1989]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a short review for ''The Antiquaries Journal'', the historian of religion [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] praised the "cautious and balanced arguments" of Merrifield's work. She opined that it should be read by every archaeologist as a corrective to what she thought was their widespread ignorance of folklore, noting that the wide array of evidence for ritual behaviour in the archaeological record would surprise "many readers".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ell88|Ellis Davidson 1988]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wider recognition===
Writing Merrifield's obituary for ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper, the Museum of London archaeologist Peter Marsden described ''The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic'' as "a masterly study of an unusual subject."&lt;ref name="Marsden 1995"&gt;[[#Mar95|Marsden 1995]].&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of Merrifield's book was discussed by the Englishman Brian Hoggard, an independent researcher who authored a 2004 [[academic paper]] entitled "The archaeology of counter-witchcraft and popular magic". Being published in the ''[[Beyond the Witch Trials]]'' anthology, edited by the historians [[Owen Davies (historian)|Owen Davies]] and [[Willem de Blécourt]], Hoggard recounted that ''The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic'' was the "notable exception" to a trend in which archaeological studies of magic were restricted to small journals, magazines and newspaper articles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hog04|Hoggard 2004]]. pp. 167&amp;ndash;186.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influential nature of Merrifield's work was also recognised by the Medieval archaeologist Roberta Gilchrist of the [[University of Reading]]. In an academic paper published in a 2008 edition of the ''Medieval Archaeology'' journal, Gilchrist referenced Merrifield's study, noting that it offered a "rare contribution" to the archaeology of ritual and magic in Britain. In particular she highlighted his belief that many archaeologists dealing with literate cultures exhibited a "ritual phobia" as accurate.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gil08|Gilchrist 2008]]. p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Bill Hall Trio''' was a musical comedy act originally consisting of Bill Hall (violin), Johnny Mulgrew (double bass) and [[Spike Milligan]] (guitar).  They met through the Combined Services Entertainment programme during World War II and the trio continued in its original form until 1947/8.  After Milligan left, the Bill Hall Trio obtained a new guitarist (who according to Mulgrew was like [[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]]) and other new members whenever old members left or died. The group went on until the death (from throat cancer]) of Johnny Mulgrew in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;From Spike Milligan's "Peace Work"&lt;/ref&gt; (Johnny Mulgrew died on 1 August 1985, as Peace Work was published in 1992, and in it Milligan stated that when Johnny Mulgrew died 6 years ago, the trio came to an end.). In an interview with Tony Brown in 1970, Spike mentions that Bill Hall and Johnny Mulgrew were already dead then. "The trio I worked with was the Bill Hall Trio—which became Hall, Norman and Ladd eventually. Bill Hall died from consumption; Johnny Mulgrew who used to play bass with the Ambrose Octet before the war, he died—also from consumption. I think the act is still going."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1017">'''The Leiden school''' is a school of thought in [[linguistics]] that models languages as [[meme]]s or benign neurological parasites,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semioticon.com/virtuals/imitation/van_driem_paper.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and tries to use rigorous mathematical tools borrowed by analogy from biological evolution to model the origin and spread of language in general and specific languages in particular.

It is based at the [[University of Leiden]], and its chief proponents are [[George van Driem]], [[Frederik Kortlandt]], and [[Jeroen Wiedenhof]]. The Leiden School has a significant overlap in personnel with the [[Himalayan Languages Project]].

The Leiden school of linguistics should not be confused with the current research institute of linguistics at Leiden University, the Leiden University Centre for Linguistics (LUCL).

'''''The Two Cultures''''' is the first part of an influential 1959 [[Rede Lecture]] by [[United Kingdom|British]] scientist and novelist [[C. P. Snow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Snow| first= Charles Percy | title = The Two Cultures |year=2001 | origyear = 1959 |publisher=Cambridge University Press| location= London | isbn = 978-0-521-45730-9 | page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = TLS /&gt; Its thesis was that "the intellectual life of the whole of western society" was split into the titular two cultures – namely the [[science]]s and the [[humanities]] – and that this was a major hindrance to solving the world's problems.

'''''The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution''''' (1959) was a published version of the lectures in book form. 

==The lecture==
The talk was delivered 7 May 1959 in the [[Senate House (University of Cambridge)|Senate House]], Cambridge, and subsequently published as ''The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution''. The lecture and book expanded upon an article by Snow published in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' of 6 October 1956, also entitled ''The Two Cultures''.{{Sfn | Snow | 2013}}  Published in book form, Snow's lecture was widely read and discussed on both sides of the Atlantic, leading him to write a 1963 follow-up, ''The Two Cultures: And a Second Look: An Expanded Version of The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Two Cultures: And a Second Look: An Expanded Version of The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution |last=Snow |first=Charles Percy |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow's position can be summed up by an often-repeated part of the essay:
{{Quote |A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who, by the standards of the traditional culture, are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists. Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]]. The response was cold: it was also negative. Yet I was asking something which is the scientific equivalent of: ''Have you read a work of [[Shakespeare]]'s?''&lt;ref name= Nature&gt;{{cite journal |title=Across the Great Divide |journal=Nature Physics |year=2009 |volume=5 |issue=5 |page=309 |url = http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v5/n5/full/nphys1258.html |doi= 10.1038/nphys1258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I now believe that if I had asked an even simpler question – such as, What do you mean by [[mass]], or [[acceleration]], which is the scientific equivalent of saying, ''Can you read?'' – not more than one in ten of the highly educated would have felt that I was speaking the same language. So the great edifice of modern [[physics]] goes up, and the majority of the cleverest people in the [[western world]] have about as much insight into it as their [[neolithic]] ancestors would have had.&lt;ref name=Nature /&gt;}}

In 2008, ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' included ''The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution'' in its list of the 100 books that most influenced Western public discourse since the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name = TLS&gt;{{cite news| url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article5418361.ece | location = London | work= The Times | title= The hundred most influential books since the war | date=30 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow's Rede Lecture condemned the [[British education]]al system as having, since the [[Victorian era]], over-rewarded the humanities (especially [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]) at the expense of scientific and [[engineering]] education, despite such achievements having been so decisive in winning the [[Second World War]] for the Allies.&lt;ref name=Jardine&gt;{{cite journal | title = CP Snow's Two Cultures Revisited | last = Jardine | first = Lisa | authorlink = Lisa Jardine | journal = Christ's College Magazine | year = 2010 | pages = 48–57 | format = PDF | url = http://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/cms_misc/media/Publications_Christs_Magazine_2010_web.pdf | accessdate = 2012-02-13 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120417151018/http://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/cms_misc/media/Publications_Christs_Magazine_2010_web.pdf | archivedate = 17 April 2012 | df = dmy-all }} Jardine's 2009 C. P. Snow Lecture honored the 50th anniversary of Snow's Rede Lecture. She places Snow's lecture into its historical context, and emphasizes the expansion of certain elements of the Rede Lecture in Snow's Godkin Lectures at Harvard University in 1960. These were ultimately published as {{cite book |title = Science and Government |publisher=New American Library |year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in practice deprived British [[elite]]s (in politics, administration, and industry) of adequate preparation to manage the modern scientific world. By contrast, Snow said, [[German education|German]] and [[American schools]] sought to prepare their citizens equally in the sciences and humanities, and better scientific teaching enabled these countries' rulers to compete more effectively in a scientific age. Later discussion of ''The Two Cultures'' tended to obscure Snow's initial focus on differences between British systems (of both schooling and [[social class]]) and those of competing countries.&lt;ref name=Jardine /&gt;

== Implications and influence ==
The literary critic [[F. R. Leavis]] called Snow a "public relations man" for the scientific establishment in his essay ''Two Cultures?: The Significance of C. P. Snow'', published in ''[[The Spectator]]''.  The article attracted a great deal of negative correspondence in the magazine's letters pages.&lt;ref name=kimball&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kimball |first=Roger |url = http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/-The-Two-Cultures--today-4882 |title=The Two Cultures' today: On the C. P. Snow–F. R. Leavis controversy | journal=[[The New Criterion]] |date=12 February 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1963 book Snow appeared to revise his thinking and was more optimistic about the potential of a mediating third culture.  This concept was later picked up in {{Citation | year = 1995 | title = The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution | author-link = John Brockman (literary agent)| first = John | last = Brockman| title-link = The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution }}. Introducing the reprinted {{Citation | title = The Two Cultures | year = 1993}}, [[Stefan Collini]]{{Sfn | Collini | 1993 | p = lv}} has argued that the passage of time has done much to reduce the cultural divide Snow noticed, but has not removed it entirely.

[[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s ''[[The Hedgehog, the Fox, and the Magister's Pox]]'' provides a different perspective. Assuming the [[dialectical]] interpretation, it argues that Snow's concept of "two cultures" is not only off the mark, it is a damaging and short-sighted viewpoint, and that it has perhaps led to decades of unnecessary fence-building.

[[Simon Critchley]], in ''Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction'' suggests:{{Sfn | Critchley | 2001 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=syhsLJ1eMOEC&amp;pg=PA49  49]}}
{{Quote |[Snow] diagnosed the loss of a common culture and the emergence of two distinct cultures: those represented by scientists on the one hand and those Snow termed 'literary intellectuals' on the other. If the former are in favour of social reform and progress through science, technology and industry, then intellectuals are what Snow terms 'natural [[Luddites]]' in their understanding of and sympathy for advanced industrial society. In [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]]'s terms, the division is between [[Jeremy Bentham|Benthamites]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridgeans]].|Simon Critchley}}

That is, Critchley argues that what Snow said represents a resurfacing of a discussion current in the mid-nineteenth century. Critchley describes the Leavis contribution to the making of a controversy as "a vicious ''ad hominem'' attack"; going on to describe the debate as "a familiar clash in English cultural history" citing also [[T. H. Huxley]] and [[Matthew Arnold]].{{Sfn | Critchley | 2001 | p = 51}}{{Sfn | Collini | 1993 | p = xxxv}}

In his opening address at the [[Munich Security Conference]] in January 2014, the Estonian president [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] said that the current problems related to security and freedom in cyberspace are the culmination of absence of dialogue between "the two cultures": "Today, bereft of understanding of fundamental issues and writings in the development of liberal democracy, computer geeks devise ever better ways to track people... simply because they can and it's cool. Humanists on the other hand do not understand the underlying technology and are convinced, for example, that tracking meta-data means the government reads their emails."&lt;ref&gt;Ilves, Toomas Hendrik: "[http://www.president.ee/en/official-duties/speeches/9796-qrebooting-trust-freedom-vs-security-in-cyberspaceq/index.html Rebooting Trust? Freedom vs Security in Cyberspace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223112412/http://www.president.ee/en/official-duties/speeches/9796-qrebooting-trust-freedom-vs-security-in-cyberspaceq/index.html |date=23 February 2014 }}" Opening address at Munich Security Conference Cyber 31 January 2014. 31.01.2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antecedents==
Contrasting scientific and humanistic knowledge is a repetition of the ''[[Methodenstreit]]'' of 1890 German universities.&lt;ref name="Brint2002p212"&gt;{{Citation | last = Brint | first = Steven G | year = 2002 | title = The Future of the City of Intellect: The Changing American University | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TDfrzER0obYC&amp;pg=PA212 | pages = 212–3 | quote = positivism-versus-interpretation language [...] these fractal distinctions are generally quite old. Most of them have been around at least since the celebrated ''Methodenstreit'' of the German universities in the late nineteenth century. CP Snow's "two cultures" argument captures a later instantiation of them. [...] In negotiating the complexities of social scientific and humanistic knowledge, it is extremely helpful to have a dichotomy like positivism versus interpretation, because it saves our having to remember the exact degree of positivism of any scholarly group. [...] Every single social science discipline has internal debates about positivism/interpretation, narrative/analysis, and so on. The narrative/analytic debate may look very different in economics, anthropology, and English. But underneath all the surface differences it is quite similar.| isbn = 9780804745314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A quarrel in 1911 between [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[Giovanni Gentile]] on the one hand and [[Federigo Enriques]] on the other one [https://books.google.it/books?id=oXjMYIonXTYC&amp;pg=PA422&amp;lpg=PA422&amp;dq=1911+croce+gentile+enriques+fight&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y-I3OzBiJi&amp;sig=KYsoohR9-x53CW8pBXJbYflTqGU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjzrcu80JDeAhWKk4sKHUdaCgEQ6AEwD3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false is believed] to have had enduring effects in the separation of the two cultures in Italy and to the predominance of the views of (objective) idealism over those of (logical) positivism. In the social sciences it is also commonly proposed as the quarrel of [[positivism]] versus [[Antipositivism|interpretivism]].&lt;ref name="Brint2002p212" /&gt;
