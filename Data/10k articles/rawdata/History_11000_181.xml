The year '''1952 in [[radio]]''' involved some significant events.
__TOC__

==Events==
*4 March: The Courier, the first seagoing radio station, is dedicated by president [[Harry Truman]].
*21 March: The [[Moondog Coronation Ball]] is hosted by star deejay [[Alan Freed]] and WJW (AM) in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] (now [[WKNR]]) at the [[Cleveland Arena]]. Among those scheduled to perform at the event were [[Paul Williams (saxophonist)|Paul Williams and the Hucklebuckers]], [[The Dominoes]], [[Varetta Dillard]] and [[Tiny Grimes]], but only the Hucklebuckers are able to perform before the concert is shut down by officials.  So many tickets were counterfeited that the 12,500 seat Arena now had ''25,000'' people in attendance, alarming Cleveland Police Capt. William Zimmerman, who stopped the show. A near riot ensues when close to 7,000 additional fans, unable to buy tickets, rush the gates and storm into the arena. Freed and WJW gain national attention and prestige, and the event is now universally recognized as the first [[rock 'n roll]] concert.

{{Japanese name|Aida}}
{{Nihongo|'''Aida Yūji'''|会田 雄次||5 March 1916 &amp;ndash; 17 September 1997}} was a  Japanese historian specialising in the [[Renaissance]]. He was active as a conservative thinker, commentator and major exponent of the [[Nihonjinron]]. He was born in [[Kyōto]] on 5 March 1916. He graduated from [[Kyoto University]] in 1940 and had his master's degree in history interrupted in 1943, when he was drafted into the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. He fought on the Burmese front against the British as an infantryman. He surrendered to the [[British Army]] at the war's end and was detained at [[Ahlone]] Camp in the British-controlled [[Burma]]. His experiences, especially alleged mental torture by his captors through their nonchalance towards the Japanese [[PoW]]s, are described in his best-selling memoir, ''Aaron Shūyōjo'' (1962)&lt;ref&gt;''Prisoner of the British. A Japanese Soldier’s Experience in Burma'', trans. Hide Ishiguro, Louis Allen, Cresset Press, London 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; On his repatriation in 1947, he began to teach at [[Kobe University]]. He was appointed full professor at Kyoto University's Humanities Department in 1952. He retired from the University in 1979, when he became an [[emeritus professor]]. He died of [[pneumonia]] on 17 September 1997.

== Theory of European Rationalism ==

Aida is best remembered for the theory that the "[[rationality]]" of Western civilization was consequential upon the practice of raising and killing [[livestock]]. This hypothesis, called the {{Nihongo|"livestock rearing theory"|家畜飼育説|kachiku shiikusetsu}},&lt;ref&gt;Alternatively the ''kachiku shiyōsetsu'' {{nihongo2|家畜飼養説}})&lt;/ref&gt; was set forth in his 1966 book ''Rationalism'' (''Gōrishugi''). He associated the slaughter of domestic animals, which had been hitherto reared with great care, with the nonchalant belligerence of Western soldiers. In his view, Westerners are free from the kind of [[hysteria]] Japanese soldiers would often show at the sight of bloodshed. Aida blamed this hysteria for the excessive acts of cruelty that the Japanese were accused of during the Second World War. Westerners, on the other hand, have so long been accustomed to calmly butchering animals that they developed a rational approach to slaughter, which they extended to human conflict. The Japanese hardly had any contact with livestock owing to the [[Buddhist]] [[taboo]] of eating meat and were too emotive to master the Western sort of nonchalance.

'''Alfred Auguste Nemours''' (13 July 1883 – 17 October 1955) was a [[Haitian people|Haitian]] General, diplomat and military historian.

==Biography==
He was born into a wealthy family in [[Cap-Haïtien]], northern [[Haiti]]. His father was [[Nemours Auguste]] and his mother Amétise Albaret. He adopted Nemours as his principal name later in life.&lt;ref name=Dupuis&gt;{{cite web|last=Dupuis|first=Charles|title=Le général Nemours|url=http://www.myclipboard.com/vastey/nemoursnouvelliste.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Alfred was sent to the [[Lycee]] in [[Paris]], followed by the military academy [[École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]].

During the [[United States occupation of Haiti]], Auguste Nemours wrote his ''Histoire Militaire''.&lt;ref&gt;Higman B. W. (1999), ''UNESCO General History of the Caribbean - Volume VI: Methodology and Historiography of the Caribbean: 6''.&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 1918 Nemours was appointed Conseiller d'Etat.
*From 1922 to 1925 he was Secretary and President du Conseil d'Etat.
*From 1926 to 1930 he served as [[Minister Plenipotentiary]] to [[Paris]].
He was the Haitian delegate to the 7th (1926), 9th (1928) and 16th (1935) Ordinary Session of the  Assembly of the [[League of Nations]], held in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~league/7thordinaryassemb.htm Sevennth Ordinary Session of the Assembly, Geneva, September 6 - September 25, 1926]; accessed 25 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~league/9thordinaryassemb.htm Ninth Ordinary Session of the  Assembly, Geneva, September 3 - September 26, 1928] accessed 25 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~league/16thordinaryassemb.htm Sixteenth Ordinary Session of the  Assembly, Geneva, September 9 - October 11, 1935]; accessed 25 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
As a noted speaker at the League of Nations in Geneva, Nemours pronounced these words soon to become well-known on the question of the invasion of Ethiopia by Mussolini's fascist troops, 
{{Quote|Craignez d'être un jour l'Ethiopie de quelqu'un.|Alfred Auguste Nemours}}
Fear to ever become someone's Ethiopia.

*From 1928 to 1929 he was concurrently accredited to the [[Holy See]].
*In 1938 he was Senator of the Republic.
*In 1940 he was Secretary of State of Interior.
[[C. L. R. James]] met Nemours in [[Paris]] when he was writing ''[[The Black Jacobins]]'' (1938).

==Life and career==
Herbst was born in the [[German Democratic Republic|German Democratic Republic (East Germany)]] and was almost 35 by the time (as officially identified) of [[German reunification]].   Between 1977 and 1982 he studied [[:de:Geschichtswissenschaft|Historical Sciences]] at Berlin's [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]].   After obtaining his degree he worked as a research assistant at the [[:de:Museum für Deutsche Geschichte|Museum for German History (''Museum für Deutsche Geschichte'')]] in Berlin.   The museum celebrated the nation's history through the [[Historical materialism|Marxist prism]], as something driven by [[The Communist Manifesto|class struggle]].   In the context of the [[Die Wende|changes of 1989/90]] the [[Council of Ministers of the GDR|East German government]] decided to close it during 1990.  Herbst moved on to work for the [[:de:Historische Kommission zu Berlin|Berlin Historical Commission]], now being transformed under the leadership of [[:de:Wolfram Fischer|Wolfram Fischer]].&lt;ref&gt;For biographical background see also Andreas Herbst, [[:de:Hermann Weber (Historiker, 1928)|Hermann Weber]]: ''Deutsche Kommunisten.

'''Archibald Bower''' (17 January 1686 – 3 September 1766) was a Scottish historian, now noted for his complicated and varying religious faith, and the accounts he gave of it, now considered by scholars to lack credibility.

Educated at the [[Scots College, Douai]], Bower became a [[Jesuit]] in Rome. He joined the [[Church of England]] a while after returning to London in 1726. He wrote a ''History of the Popes'' (1748–66, 7 volumes). This works was drawn into a damaging controversy, concerning his apparent return to the Jesuit or Catholic fold. By the end of his life it appeared he had changed religion three times.

==Early life==
He was born on 17 January 1686 at or near [[Dundee]]. In 1702 he was sent to the [[Scots College, Douai]]; he then went to Rome, and was admitted to the Society of Jesus on 9 December 1706. After a novitiate of two years he went in 1712 to [[Fano]], where he taught classics till 1714, when he moved to [[Fermo]]. In 1717 he was recalled to Rome to study divinity in the [[Roman College]], and in 1721 he was transferred to the college of Arezzo, where he remained till 1723, and became reader of philosophy. He was next sent to [[Florence]], and the same year moved on to [[Macerata]], where he stayed till 1726. By then he was, probably, professed of the [[four vows]] (his own statements concerning himself may not be reliable).&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Bower, Archibald|volume=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The turning-point in Bower's career was his transfer from Macerata to [[Perugia]], and his departure from there to England in 1726. Jesuit records show that the Order sent him to England.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=3043|title=Bower, Alexander|first=Geoffrey|last=Holt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bower gave a quite different story in ''Answer to a Scurrilous Pamphlet'' (1757). Another account had been previously published by [[Richard Baron (dissenting minister)|Richard Baron]] in 1750,&lt;ref&gt;''A faithful Account of Mr. Archibald Bower's Motives for leaving his Office of Secretary to the Court of Inquisition; including also a relation of the horrid treatment of an innocent gentleman, who was driven mad by his sufferings, in this bloody Court; and of a Nobleman who expired under his tortures. To both which inhuman and shocking scenes the author was an eye-witness.''&lt;/ref&gt; allegedly based on the story Bower gave of his "escape" to Dr. Hill, chaplain to the archbishop of Canterbury. A third account is printed at the end of ''Bower and Tillemont compared'' (1757) by Douglas.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==In England==
On his arrival in England in June or July 1726 Bower became acquainted with [[Edward Aspinwall]], formerly a Jesuit, who introduced him to [[Samuel Clarke]]. After several meetings with Aspinwall, Clarke, and [[George Berkeley]], he withdrew from the communion of the Roman Catholic church, and left the Society of Jesus. He wrote that he was then for six years a Protestant of no particular denomination, before l he conformed to the [[church of England]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; In fact he was making tentative contact again with the Jesuits, in the early 1630s.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

Through the royal physician Thomas Goodman, Bower obtained a recommendation to [[Henry Aylmer, 2nd Baron Aylmer|Lord Aylmer]], who wanted a classical tutor. He was for several years on close terms with Aylmer, and was introduced to connections including [[George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton|George Lyttelton]], who became a loyal friend. He took on a tutoring post, the education of the son of a Mr. Thompson, of [[Cooley, Berkshire|Cooley]], Berkshire; he switched after a year to Aylmer's household.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Bower was reconciled to the Catholic church in 1744 by the Jesuit Philip Carterest. This reconversion was preceded by negotiations of over a decade, and financial arrangements.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; Bower, however, soon again grew dissatisfied with his situation. He began a correspondence with Father Sheldon, the Jesuit provincial; and he received back his invested funds on 20 June 1747.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

On the death of Francis Say,&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|SY708F|Say, Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; keeper of Queen [[Caroline of Ansbach]]'s library (10 September 1748), Bower obtained the place through the interest of Lyttelton with the prime minister [[Henry Pelham]]. The next year (4 August 1749) he married a niece of Bishop [[William Nicolson]], a daughter of a clergyman of the church of England. This lady had a fortune, and a child by a former husband. He had already been engaged in a treaty of marriage, which did not take effect, in 1745. In April 1754 Lyttelton appointed him clerk of the buck-warrants.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Death==
Bower died on 3 September 1766, and was buried in [[Marylebone]] churchyard. The epitaph on his tomb describes him as "a man exemplary for every social virtue, justly esteemed by all who knew him for his strict honesty and integrity, a faithful friend, and a sincere christian". He bequeathed all his property to his wife, who attested that he died a Protestant (''London Chronicle'', 11 October 1766).&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
While he resided with Lord Aylmer, Bower wrote ''Historia Literaria'', a monthly review that appeared from 1730 to 1734. During the following nine years (1735–1744) he was employed on the ''[[Universal History (Sale et al)|Universal History]]'', to which he contributed the history of Rome. He was paid to revise its second edition.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

On 25 March 1747 Bower issued proposals for printing by subscription his ''History of the Popes''. He explained that researches designed to vindicate [[papal supremacy]] had had the opposite effect on him. He presented the first volume to the king 13 May 1748. The second volume appeared in 1751, and towards the end of 1753 the third volume, which brought down his history to the death of [[Pope Stephen II]] in 757. It was in 1754 that the first serious attack was made on the work, in a pamphlet by [[Alban Butler]], published anonymously at Douai as ''Remarks on the two first volumes of the late Lives of the Popes; in letters from a Gentleman to a Friend in the Country.''&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

A controversial storm then broke over Bower. Letters addressed by Bower to the provincial of the Jesuits fell into the hands of [[Sir Henry Bedingfeld, 3rd Baronet|Sir Henry Bedingfield]], who asserted that they showed Bower was a Catholic. Bower maintained that these letters were forgeries, by the Jesuits. Then [[John Douglas (bishop of Salisbury)|John Douglas]] published in 1756 a pamphlet&lt;ref&gt;''Six Letters from A——d B——r to Father Sheldon, provincial of the Jesuits in England; illustrated with several remarkable facts, tending to ascertain the authenticity of the said letters, and the true character of the writer.''&lt;/ref&gt; supporting the genuineness of the letters; and testimony of a Mrs. Hoyles whom Bower had converted. There was a reply from Bower's side, and Douglas published a second tract, ''Bower and Tillemont compared'' (1757), in which he argued that the ''History of the Popes'', especially the first volume, was in effect a translation of the work of [[Louis-Sébastien Le Nain de Tillemont]]. In 1757 Bower brought out three long pamphlets, and Douglas followed with ''A Full Confutation of all the Facts advanced in Mr. Bower's Three Defences'' (1757), and ''A Complete and Final Detection of A——d B——r'' (1758), with documentation from Italy, and arguing that Bower was an imposter.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

[[David Garrick]], once a friend of Bower, threatened to write a farce in which Bower was to be introduced on the stage as a mock convert. Bower replied with personal attacks and rebuttals. Before the controversy had ended he published his fourth volume, and in 1757 an abridgment of the first four volumes of his work was published in French at Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In 1761 Bower seems to have had a hand in the anonymous ''Authentic Memoirs concerning the Portuguese Inquisition, in a series of letters to a friend''. Around the same time he produced the fifth volume of his ''History of the Popes'', with a summary his deakins with Catholics. The rest of his history did not appear till just before the author's death, when the sixth and seventh volumes were published together; but with the period from 1600 to 1758 covered in 26 pages. The ''History of the Popes'' was reprinted with a continuation by [[Samuel Hanson Cox]], in 3 vols., Philadelphia, 1844-5.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

'''Auguste''' Armand Ghislain Marie Joseph Nompar de Caumont '''de La Force''' (18 August 1878, [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]] – 3 October 1961, [[Saint-Aubin-de-Locquenay]]), 12th Duke of La Force, was a French duke and historian. Specialising in the 17th century (he was himself a descendent of the 1000-year-old Caumont de la Force family), his work allowed him to reconstruct events in which his ancestors had taken part. He was elected a member of the [[Académie française]] on 19 November 1925.

The '''Battle of Roncevaux Pass''' ([[French language|French]] and English spelling, ''[[Roncesvalles]]'' in Spanish, ''Orreaga'' in [[Basque language|Basque]]) in 778 saw a large force of [[Basque people|Basques]] ambush a part of [[Charlemagne]]'s  army in [[Roncevaux Pass]], a high mountain pass in the [[Pyrenees]] on the present border between France and Spain, after his invasion of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].

The Basque attack was a retaliation for Charlemagne's destruction of the city walls of their capital, [[Pamplona, Spain|Pamplona]].  As the Franks retreated across the Pyrenees back to [[Francia]], the rearguard of Frankish [[Knight#Carolingian age|lords]] was cut off, [[Last stand|stood its ground]], and was wiped out.  Roncevaux was Charlemagne's only military defeat.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Among those killed in the battle was a relatively obscure Frankish commander, [[Roland]], whose death elevated him and the [[paladins]], the foremost warriors of Charlemagne's court, into legend, becoming the quintessential role model for [[knights]] and also greatly influencing the code of [[chivalry]] in the [[Middle Ages]].  There are numerous written works about the battle, some of which change and exaggerate events.  The battle is recounted in the 11th century ''[[The Song of Roland]]'', the oldest surviving major work of [[French literature]], and in ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', one of the most celebrated works of [[Italian literature]].  Modern adaptations of the battle include books, plays and works of fiction, and monuments in the Pyrenees.

==Background==
{{Main|Abbasid–Carolingian alliance}}

With the rise of the [[Carolingians]] and [[Pepin the Short]]'s war on Aquitaine, the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]] led by [[Waiofar|Waifer]] was defeated and further ensued Frankish penetration into the duchy. The Basques (''Vascones'', ''Wascones'') of the [[Duchy of Vasconia]], one of the mainstays of the Aquitanian army, submitted to Pepin in 766 and 769, but the territory south of the Garonne remained largely unscathed and self-governed. However, as of 778 Charlemagne expanded Frankish takeover of Aquitaine to present-day [[Gascony]], by appointing trusted Franks, Burgundians and Church officials in key regional positions and establishing counties, such as [[County of Fezensac|Fezensac]], Bordeaux, and Toulouse, on the left bank of the Garonne.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

[[Sulayman al-Arabi]], the pro-[[Abbasid]] [[Wāli|Wali]] (governor) of [[Barcelona]] and [[Girona]], sent a delegation to [[Charlemagne]] in [[Paderborn]], offering his submission, along with the allegiance of [[Husayn of Zaragoza]] and [[Abu Taur of Huesca]] in return for military aid.&lt;ref name="Lewis 2008 p. 244"&gt;Lewis (2008) p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; Their masters had been cornered in the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] peninsula by [[Abd ar-Rahman I]], the [[Umayyad]] [[emir of Córdoba]]. The three rulers also conveyed that the caliph of [[Baghdad]], [[Al-Mahdi|Muhammad al-Mahdi]], was preparing an invasion force against Abd ar-Rahman.&lt;ref name="Lewis 2008 p. 244"/&gt;

Seeing an opportunity to extend [[Christendom]] and his own power, Charlemagne agreed to go to Spain. Al-Arabi induced him to invade [[al Andalus]] by promising him an easy surrender of its [[Upper March]], of which Zaragoza was the capital. Following the sealing of this alliance at Paderborn,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (2008) p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; Charlemagne marched across the [[Pyrenees]] in 778 "at the head of all the forces he could muster".&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (2008) p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Charlemagne led the [[Neustria]]n army over [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]] into the Western [[Pyrenees]], while the [[Austrasia]]ns, [[Lombards]], and [[Burgundians]] passed over the Eastern Pyrenees through [[Catalonia]]. His troops were welcomed in [[Barcelona]] and [[Girona]] by Sulayman al-Arabi.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (2008) p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; As he moved towards [[Zaragoza]], the troops of Charlemagne were joined by troops led by al-Arabi, before eventually putting the city in a siege.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Abd ar-Rahman of Córdoba sent his most trusted general, Thalaba Ibn Obeid, to take control of the possibly rebellious city and to prevent the Frankish invasion. Husayn and Ibn Obeid clashed repeatedly; eventually Husayn managed to defeat and to imprison Ibn Obeid. Reinforced in his autonomous position, Husayn became reluctant to yield his new privileged status to the Frankish monarch and refused to surrender the city to Charlemagne, claiming that he had never promised Charlemagne his allegiance. He seems to have tried to appease Charlemagne by giving him the prisoner General Ibn Obeid and a large tribute of gold, but Charlemagne was not easily satisfied, putting Sulayman al-Arabi in chains. Meanwhile, the force sent by the Baghdad caliphate seems to have been stopped near [[Barcelona]]. Though initially having the upper hand, the siege of Zaragoza dragged for over a month.&lt;ref name="History Day"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis 2008 p.249"&gt;Lewis (2008) p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually a deal was struck between Charlemagne and Husayn. The latter would pay gold and the release of several prisoners, while the Franks in return would withdraw their siege.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Before leaving the Iberian peninsula he decided to further secure his hold on the Basque territory (Wasconia).&lt;ref name="Lewis 2008 p.249"/&gt; Charlemagne first eliminated any possible opposition from the natives of the region (the [[Basque people|Basque]] tribes), believing that many of them were allied with the Moors. He gave orders to tear down the walls of the Basque capital [[Pamplona, Spain|Pamplona]], possibly fearing that it could be used for future conflicts. Some primary sources suggest that he destroyed the city altogether,&lt;ref name="Lewis 2008 p.249"/&gt; and many towns in the region were also razed.&lt;ref name="Britannia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Roncesvalles#ref211366|title=Orreaga; Roncevaux |last=Vicente|first=Rodriguez |publisher=''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' |date= |accessdate=December 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrisons and military outposts were placed throughout the territory, and there were accounts of the Franks' harsh treatment of the Basques during their occupation.&lt;ref name="Ham"/&gt; After securing the region, Charlemagne marched for the Pyrenees mountain pass in hopes of returning to France. Many of his notable [[Knight#Carolingian age|lords]], such as Roland, military governor of the [[Breton March]], and Eggihard, [[Mayor of the Palace]], were placed in the rearguard probably to protect the retreat and the baggage train.&lt;ref name="Butt"&gt;Butt, John J.

In the evening of August 15, 778, Charlemagne's rearguard was suddenly attacked by the Basques as they crossed the mountain pass. The Franks were caught off guard by the surprise attack, with their army in confusion and disarray as they tried to escape the ambush.&lt;ref name="Nar"/&gt; The Basques managed to cut off and isolate the Frankish rearguard and the baggage train from the rest of the escaping army, and although the Basques were not as well equipped, they held the upper ground and the knowledge of the terrain that gave them a huge advantage in the skirmish.&lt;ref name="History Day"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historychannel.com.au/classroom/day-in-history/754/battle-of-roncevaux-pass|title=This Day In History: August 15, 778 |last=|first= |publisher=''[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]]'' |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Charlemagne tried to regroup and evacuate his army, Roland and the others held for a considerable amount of time, before the Basques finally massacred them completely.

{{quote|text=Having decided to return, [Charlemagne] entered the mountains of the Pyrenees, in whose summits the [[Vascones]] had set up an ambush. They attacked the rearguard, causing confusion which spread to all the army. And, while the Franks were superior to the Vascones both in armament and in courage, the roughness of the terrain and the difference in the style of combat made them generally weaker. In this battle were killed the majority of the paladins that the King had placed in command of his forces. The baggage was sacked, and suddenly the enemy vanished, thanks to their knowledge of the terrain. The memory of the injury so produced overshadowed in the King's heart that of the feats done in Hispania.}}

===The Basque army===
One of the principal units of the Vascones was the [[guerrilla]] army of the Basques.&lt;ref name="Lewis 2008 p. 244"/&gt;  A later source, the anonymous ''Saxon Poet'', talks of the Basque spears, agreeing with the Pyrenean and Basque tradition much later among the [[almogavars]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entrada1598.com/games/whancients/9thcenturyspain.pdf 9th Century Spain]&lt;/ref&gt;  A typical Basque mountain warrior was armed with two short spears and a knife or short sword as his main weapons, and bows or javelins for missile weapons.  He would not normally wear armour.  [[Pierre de Marca]], a [[Béarn]]ese author, suggests that the attackers were a reduced number of mostly local [[Lower Navarre|Low Navarrese]], [[Soule]]tines, and [[Baztan, Navarre|Baztanese]], whose main motivation may have been plunder.&lt;ref name="Nar"/&gt;  The Vascones have a history of resisting Carolingian rule since the incursion of Frankish king [[Pepin the Short]], which saw the defeat of [[Waiofar]], the last independent Duke of [[Aquitaine]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1965) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The accounts of Einhard and Pierre de Marca suggest that the perpetrator of the attack was [[Lupo II of Gascony]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (2008) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;  He held the territory of the  Pyrenees, making him responsible for the tragedy that happened in his realm.  Regions surrounding his kingdom such as Bordeaux were under the control of the Carolingians. While the Duke did pay homage to Charlemagne by offering Hunald II (a rebel leader and a possible heir to Waiofar) and his wife to him, there were disputes over the trans-Pyrenean Basques lands ruled by Lupo and those under Carolingian suzerainty.&lt;ref name="Nar"/&gt; The authors of the General History of [[Languedoc]] also believed in the same theory that the Duke was the leader of the attack. Their reasons were that he and the Vascones opposed Carolingian expansion into [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]] after the [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|Franco-Aquitanian war (760–769)]].&lt;ref name="Texas"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society, 718–1050|last=Lewis |first=Archibald R.|authorlink= Archibald R.

The Pyrenees are a mountain range in southwest Europe that form a natural border between France and Spain, extending about 490&amp;nbsp;km (305 m) from [[Cap Higuer]] on the [[Bay of Biscay]], to [[Cap de Creus]] on the Mediterranean Sea. The range also separates the Iberian Peninsula from the rest of Western Europe. Beyond the Northern part of the pass lies much of the French frontier and wilderness. The mountains are older than the Alps and have an elevation of 1,777 m (3,862 feet).&lt;ref name="Britannia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://worldwalking.org/route/qsygf3/milestone/nqo0ol |title=Roncesvalles |last= |first= |publisher=''World Walking'' |date= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222130449/https://worldwalking.org/route/qsygf3/milestone/nqo0ol |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These descriptions have suggested various places from which the battle could have taken place, ranging from Navarre and [[Aragon]] to as far as [[Catalonia]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The mainstream opinion is that the battle took place somewhere not far from Roncevaux itself, as it is not just on one of the easiest routes but also the traditional one. Indeed, the Roman road ''"Via ab Asturica Burdigalam"'' which started in Castra Legiones (current León) and went to [[Lescar|Benearnum]], crossed the Pyrenees through Roncevaux. However, the traditional Roman road (also called the ''Route of Napoleon'') followed a route different from the modern one, not crossing at Ibañeta (the traditional location) but heading up eastwards and crossing instead the Lepoeder and Bentartea passes—next to the mount Astobizkar—not far from the mount [[Urkulu]], identified as the ''Summum Pyreneum'' of the classic Roman sources.&lt;ref name="Nar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walk"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins1990&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Roger|title=The Basques|year=1990|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=0-631-17565-2|edition=2nd |page=122|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Lavisse elementaire 022 roncevaux.jpg|thumb|right|The death of Roland and his men]]
Charlemagne biographer [[Einhard]] stated that the men in the rear were "massacred to the last man."&lt;ref name="Ein"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.karwansaraypublishers.com/pw/medieval-warfare/blog/a-legend-grows/|title=A legend grows |last=Baker |first=Patrick |publisher=''Karwasaray Publishers'' |date= January 23, 2014 |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Vita Karoli'' mentions the names of the most important lords killed such as Eggihard, Roland and Anselmus; the [[Palatine Count]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Einhard]], Notker the Stammerer.

While the skirmish was a small setback, Charlemagne did lose huge quantities of treasure and good men.&lt;ref name="Count"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ein"/&gt; It was the only significant defeat that Charlemagne ever suffered in his otherwise successful military career.&lt;ref name="Ein"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kearney, Milo. ''Further Studies in Rio Grande Valley History''. [[University of Texas at Brownsville]] (2006). ASIN: B000NLBN3Y.&lt;/ref&gt; Never again would Charlemagne take it upon himself to lead an army to battle in Spain, having to rely instead on his generals for future campaigns in the Iberian Peninsula.&lt;ref name="Nar"/&gt; The Franks failed to capture Zaragoza and suffered a significant loss at the hands of the Vascones, but Charlemagne would return to establish the [[Marca Hispanica]], to serve as a buffer region between his Christian empire and the Muslims to the south. A decade later the Franks finally captured [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref name="Count"/&gt; He would also later establish the Kingdom of [[Aquitaine]] with the son of [[Louis the Pious]] as its first king. Land in the Pyrenees would be directed upon by Carolingian officials, and distributed among colonisers and to the Spanish Church who were allied to Charlemagne. A Christianization program was put in place across the high Pyrenees. The Basque would continue their rebellion to Carolingian rule until the appointment of [[William of Gellone|William of Orange]], who would dissolve their rebellion after capturing and exiling Lupo's son and Basque leader [[Adalric of Gascony|Adalric]] in 790.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3407711861/william-aquitaine-st.html "William of Aquitaine, St."]. Encyclopedia.com. Retrieved on 2014-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zaragoza, however, remained a Muslim city and capital of the Upper March, and later of an [[Taifa|independent emirate]] until the 11th century. Pamplona, itself, would still remain in the hands of the Muslims and held until a rebellion in 798–801 expelled them as well. The Vascones would finally consolidate the [[Banu Qasi]] realm and eventually the constitution of the independent [[Kingdom of Navarre|Kingdom of Pamplona]] in 824 after the birth of a new resistance to Carolingian rule. In that same year, the Basque army defeated another [[Carolingian]] army in the same mountain pass. The second [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass (824)|Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] was almost similar to the first, with the Basques again taking advantage of the terrain, but against a much larger Frankish force. Unlike the first battle in which Charlemagne's army managed to escape, the Carolingians led by [[Aeblus|Count Aeblus]] were trapped and routed, and a larger number of men were slaughtered than those of Charlemagne's.&lt;ref name="Texas"/&gt; Frankish vassals Aeblus and [[Aznar Sánchez|Aznar]] were captured by the joint forces of [[Iñigo Arista]]'s [[Kingdom of Navarre|Pamplona]] and of the [[Banu Qasi]], consolidating the independence of both realms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/38128?op=4&amp;primR=21&amp;regs=10&amp;idi=en&amp;EIKVOGEN=Ducado%20Vasconia&amp;pos=25 Ducado de Vasconia (Auñamendi Encyclopedia)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, this battle was [[Romance (heroic literature)|romanticized]] by oral tradition into a major conflict between [[Christian]]s and [[Muslim]]s although in fact, the Basques of the period were mainly Pagans and Charlemagne had been allied to some of the Muslims. In the tradition, the Basques are replaced by a force of 400,000 [[Saracen]]s, and mythical objects such as [[durendal]] and [[Olifant (instrument)|oliphant]] were also added.&lt;ref name="Lewis 2008 p.249"/&gt; Although Roland died in the battle with little information about him, the battle popularized him as a chivalric hero of honor in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, ''Medieval Romance in England'', New York Burt Franklin,1963 p. iii. {{ISBN|978-0-8337-2144-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Song of Roland]]'', which commemorates the battle, was written by an unknown poet of the 11th century. It is the earliest surviving of the ''[[chansons de geste]]'' or epic poems of medieval France in the ''[[langue d'oïl]]'', in what would become the French language. Together with the [[Knights of the Round Table]] in Britain, the story of Roland and the [[paladins]] have become the archetypal icons of [[chivalry]] in Europe; greatly influencing [[Knight#Chivalric code|knightly culture]] and inspiring many Christian warriors that came after. During the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066, knights and soldiers under [[William the Conqueror]], chanted the poem to inspire themselves before their fight with the Anglo-Saxons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com.ph/?gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=wsJ2VtT2H4LN8gfUzpPADg#q=song+of+roland+battle+of+hastings|title=THE BATTLE OF HASTINGS AND THE BEGINNINGS OF ANGLO-NORMAN ENGLAND|date=December 20, 2015|work=England and English History|author=Gareth Pullen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English expression, "to give a Roland for an [[Oliver (paladin)|Oliver]]", meaning either to offer a ''[[quid pro quo]]'' or to give as good as one gets, which is referenced directly from the companionship of Roland and Oliver during the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Canteen Kopje''' is an archaeological site, formally protected as a grade 2 provincial heritage site, and approved in 2017 for re-grading to national status, situated outside [[Barkly West]] in the [[Northern Cape]], South Africa. The place was previously known as Klipdrift, meaning stony drift, a translation from a still earlier !Ora name, !''a'' |''aub''. Canteen Kopje is best known for its long and exceptionally rich [[Early Stone Age|Earlier Stone Age]] sequence, spanning circa &gt;0.5 to 1.7 million years, occurring within gravels exposed in late nineteenth/early twentieth century mining pits. Also attracting attention are more recent archaeological levels in the overlying Hutton Sands, which contain material known as Fauresmith, Middle Stone Age, Later Stone Age, and late Iron Age with evidence of protocolonial/colonial contact and interaction, probably, with nineteenth century diamond diggers. 
 
The importance of Canteen Kopje as a heritage site was recognized, and a 9 hectare area known as Erf 91 was proclaimed as a protected reserve in 1948. Gideon Retief, Mining Commissioner of Barkly West from 1942 to 1951, was instrumental in preserving the site and creating the first open air exhibit here. Subsequently, in 2000, information panels were erected by the McGregor Museum. These were refurbished in 2016. A walking trail was laid out for visitors to view the early diamond diggings and archaeological research sites. The [[Barkly West Museum]] contains further information and examples of artefacts from the site, while material excavated by archaeologists is housed principally by the [[McGregor Museum]], the approved archaeological repository for the Northern Cape Province in nearby Kimberley.

In 2016 the protected heritage site was directly threatened after the Department of Minerals and Energy issued a permit for part of the site to be mined. Although a heritage permit had not been issued by the [[South African Heritage Resources Agency]], mining commenced on 18 March 2016. An urgent interdicted was granted by the Northern Cape Division of the High Court of South Africa on 19 March, being made final on 19 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canteenkopje.com/ Canteen Kopje - Cultural Heritage under Threat]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s the archaeologist [[Clarence Van Riet Lowe|C. van Riet Lowe]] predicted: “When the last diamond claim has been abandoned, archaeologists throughout the world will be interested in Canteen Kopje, in the Vaal River diggings, where lie the prehistoric remains of a million years of human evolution.”

==Alluvial diamond diggings==
One of the hills in the vicinity of Canteen Kopje was the site of the first [[alluvial]] diamond diggings (as opposed to surface prospecting) on the [[Diamond Fields]] of South Africa, which precipitated the rush to these parts in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Babe, J. 1872. ''The South African Diamond Fields''. New York: David Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; Digging continued here until the early 1940s.

[[Tswana people|Batlhaping]] ''Kgosi'' (Chief) [[Jantjie Mothibi]] controlled, for as long as he could, the influx of white “diamond seekers” to the region. Prospectors were allowed to use sharp sticks, but were not permitted to “touch the ground with pick and shovel”. For their part, as noted by Jerome Babe in his 1872 book, ''The South African Diamond Fields'', “Natives would form themselves in long lines, joined hand in hand, and walk slowly over the ground and look for diamonds, especially after rain; and if they found one they would take it to a trader...[Finds were exchanged for] horses, wagons, cows, sheep, cash, goods, etc at a deuce of a pace”.&lt;ref&gt;Babe, J. 1872. ''The South African Diamond Fields''. New York: David Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1870 diggers from KwaZulu-Natal were working their way along the [[Vaal River]], finding diamonds at Klipdrift, on the “Old Koppie”, upslope from Canteen Kopje. Using “pick and shovel, in spite of the natives”, they unearthed more, precipitating the diamond rush. Soon both banks of the Vaal River were thronging with diggers of many nationalities, and by the end of the year there were five thousand people at Klipdrift alone.&lt;ref&gt;Babe, J. 1872. ''The South African Diamond Fields''. New York: David Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;

The diggers formed a Mutual Protection Association and elected [[Stafford Parker]] as their leader. Klipdrift was renamed Parkerton (from 1873 it was called Barkly West), and a Diggers’ Republic was proclaimed in July 1870.

A popular early cradle sieve for recovery of diamonds was the so-called “Long Tom”, which was reliant on large quantities of water. An improved version less dependent on water was developed by the American digger, author of ''The South African Diamond Fields'', Jerome Babe. His ‘dry sifter’, known as the “Yankee Baby”, is still used in the twenty first century by some small-scale diggers. At the time, its inventor was said to be “the first Babe to rock his own cradle”.

The centrifugal or rotary washing machine – now standard on diggings in the area – is more sophisticated. In a slurry, a concentrate of heavy diamond-bearing deposit is separated from lighter waste.

Diggers staked their claims near the river, and dug the gravel where it was exposed at or near the surface. Where the gravel was buried deeper under silt and sand - such as at Canteen Kopje - large pits were dug. From these and from vertical shafts, the diggers tunnelled out precarious passageways in which a man could hardly stand.

==Geology==
The sequence of geological deposits in the vicinity of Canteen Kopje comprises:

*Resistant 2 800 million year old andesitic lavas of the Ventersdorp Supergroup, underlying the entire area.
*Thin patches of circa 280 million year old basal Karoo Sequence sediments made up of tillite and shale locally.
*Shallow remnants of 19-17 million year old Older Gravels on the tops and upper slopes of adjacent hills.
*Up to circa 10m thickness of &gt;0.5 to 1.7 million year old Younger Gravels formed largely from rock debris washed from adjacent hillsides.
*Up to 4m thick reddish windblown Hutton Sands that accumulated during drier intervals since about 0.3-0.5 million years ago.

Diamonds at or near Canteen Kopje are confined to the Older and Younger Gravels. Around 90-120 million years ago, a swarm of volcanic pipes, centred on Kimberley to the east, brought  diamond-bearing kimberlite to a higher surface formed of Karoo Sequence sediments. Subsequent erosion has lowered the entire regional landscape by over 1200 metres and in the process the diamonds were released from their host rock. It has been estimated that at least 50 million carats of diamonds were set free in this way from the five kimberlite pipes in the vicinity of Kimberley alone. Most of those were flushed away to the sea long ago in past and present river channels, but along the way some were trapped in alluvial deposits such as the Older and Younger Gravels along rivers in this region.

==Recognition of archaeological significance==
[[File:Canteen Kopje-2.JPG|thumb|general view of Canteen Kopje site from the nearby hill]]
Earlier Stone Age artefacts were noted in the area by Colonel [[James Henry Bowker]] and [[Mary Elizabeth Barber]] at the time of the earliest diamond diggings. Eminent prehistorians including [[Clarence Van Riet Lowe|C. van Riet Lowe]], the French prehistorian, the Abbé [[Henri Breuil]] and [[J. Desmond Clark]] visited and described it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Young | first2 = R.B. | year = 1906 | title = The relation of ancient deposits of the Vaal River to the palaeolithic period of South Africa | url = | journal = Transactions of the Geological Society of South Africa | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 53–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Péringuey | first1 = Louis | authorlink = Louis Péringuey | year = 1911 | title = The stone ages of South Africa as represented in the collections of the South African Museum | url = | journal = Annals of the South African Museum | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 1–218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Power | first1 = J.H. | year = 1949 | title = The contribution of the northern Cape to the study of prehistoric man | url = | journal = South African Journal of Science | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 107–116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Söhnge | first1 = P.G. | last2 = Visser | first2 = D.J.L. | last3 = van Riet Lowe | first3 = C. | year = 1937 | title = The geology and archaeology of the Vaal River basin | url = | journal = Geological Survey of South Africa Memoir | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 1–134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Breuil was here in 1929 and again in the 1940s, when he famously noted that "not only are there enough specimens [there] to fill a museum to overflowing but to build it of them also."

==Preserved and almost lost==
On account both of the mining history as well as the finding of Acheulean artefacts at this spot, a 10 morgen portion of Canteen Kopje was declared a National Monument (since 2000 known as a [[Provincial heritage site (South Africa)|provincial heritage site]]) in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Oberholster, J.J. 1972. ''The historical monuments of South Africa''. Stellenbosch: The Rembrandt van Rijn Foundation for Culture for the National Monuments Council.&lt;/ref&gt; Mining recommenced in the vicinity in the 1990s and Canteen Kopje was nearly lost. Pressure was exerted for the site to be de-proclaimed as a heritage site, to allow for renewed diamond digging and ‘empowerment’ of small scale miners.  The local community recognised the value of conserving heritage and supported the efforts of the then National Monuments Council and the [[McGregor Museum]] to preserve the site, which was then developed as an open-air museum. The new [[Barkly West Museum]] was created at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turkington | first1 = T. | year = 2000 | title = Realising a dream: Canteen Kopje and the new Barkly West Museum | url = | journal = The Digging Stick | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 1–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewed threat was experienced in 2016. In 2014 the [[Department of Mineral Resources (South Africa)|Department of Minerals]] (DMR) issued a permit for mining to take place on part of the declared site. The [[South African Heritage Resources Agency]] (SAHRA) was alerted and in response, because of the existing formal declaration, a Cease Works Order was put in place to prevent mining from taking place. Pressure was exerted however and in March 2016 the Cease Works Order was lifted, following which, on 16 March 2016, a diamond mining operation commenced work by fencing off an area around that for which they have a DMR mining permit. Public access to the remainder of the heritage site was blocked. Section 27(18) of the National Heritage Resources Act (NHRA) (Act 25 of 1999) states that: "No person may destroy, damage, deface, excavate, alter, remove from its original position, subdivide or change the planning status of any heritage site without a permit issued by the heritage resources authority responsible for the protection of such site." Section 51. (1) of the NHRA states that: "Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, any person who contravenes— (a) sections 27(18), 29(10), 32(13) or 32(19) is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine or imprisonment or both such fine and imprisonment as set out in item 1 of the Schedule." Since the mining concern has commenced mining operations without such a permit issued by SAHRA, it is clearly in contravention of an Act of the Republic of South Africa and therefore is guilty of an offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anetos|first1=Pericles|title=Diamond company mines illegally in heritage site rich in early stone age artefacts|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/scitech/2016/03/19/Diamond-company-mines-illegally-in-heritage-site-rich-in-early-stone-age-artefacts|accessdate=19 March 2016|agency=Time Live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morris|first1=Michael|title=Outrage over mining at world heritage site|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/northern-cape/outrage-over-mining-at-world-heritage-site-2000275|website=IOL|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilian|first1=Anine|title=Local scientists dismayed at mining operations at heritage site.|url=http://www.miningweekly.com/article/local-scientists-dismayed-at-mining-operations-at-heritage-site-2016-03-18|website=Mining Weekly|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leader|first1=George M.|title=World Heritage Gone: South African Diamond Mining Destroys Archaeological Sites Daily|url=https://leakeyfoundation.org/world-heritage-gone-south-african-diamond-mining-destroys-archaeological-sites-daily/|website=The Leakey Foundation|accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological and geological investigations from the 1990s==
Excavations in the late 1990s were carried out by [[Peter Beaumont (archaeologist)|Peter Beaumont]] of the McGregor Museum. [[John McNabb]] from the [[University of Southampton]] worked with Beaumont in analysing the [[Acheulean]] stone artefact technology.&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont, P.B. 1990. Canteen Koppie (Klipdrift). In Beaumont, P. &amp;  Morris, D. (eds.) ''Guide to Archaeological sites in the Northern Cape''. 14–16. McGregor Museum: Kimberley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont, P. &amp; McNabb, J. (2000a.) Report for the National Monuments Council of South Africa on excavations by Peter Beaumont at Canteen Koppie, Barkly West, Northern Cape Province, South Africa.

(2001) The shape of things to come: a speculative essay on the role of the Victoria West phenomenon at Canteen Koppie during the South African Earlier Stone Age. In Milligen, S. &amp; Cook, J. (eds) ''"A very remote period indeed": papers on the Palaeolithic presented to Derek Roe''. Oxford: Oxbow Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Further excavations have been carried out by archaeologists from the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] (inter alia for application of [[cosmogenic nuclide burial dating]]) and the University of Toronto. The current active programme of research has yielded an as yet unpublished basal date of some 2.3 million years, while excavations involving students from the Sol Plaatje University in Kimberley investigate the most recent circa 19th century contact period archaeology showing interaction between local communities and colonial diggers.

Crucial to the interpretation of the archaeology of the site, is an understanding of site formation in relation to the adjacent hill and the [[Vaal River]] which at different periods cut down first to the north of the site and then the south west.&lt;ref&gt;Helgren, D.M. (1979) ''River of diamonds: an alluvial history of the lower Vaal basin, South Africa''. Chicago: University of Chicago. Department of Geography. Research Paper 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Wit, M.C.J., Ward, J.D. &amp; Jacob, J.R. (1997) Diamond-bearing deposits of the Vaal-Orange River System. ''Field Excursion Guidebook 6th International Conference on Fluvial Sedimentology'', University of Cape Town, September 1997 2, 1–61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2113/gssajg.111.1.53 | last1 = De Wit | first1 = M.C.J. | year = 2008 | title = Canteen Koppie at Barkly West: South Africa's first diamond mine | url = | journal = [[South African Journal of Geology]] | volume = 111 | issue = | pages = 53–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sajg.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/111/1/53 Canteen Koppie at Barkly West: South Africa’s first diamond mine]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007-9 a 7-metre sequence through Hutton Sands and Gravels was excavated to carry out dating and a detailed analysis of the lithic profile. There is a marked 'Victoria West' Acheulean horizon (named for the [[Victoria West|town in the Karoo]] where these stone tools were first described) in the upper part of the gravels, subject to a current Southampton PhD project. The lower part of the sequence contains simpler, older Acheulean technology.

Later Stone Age material at and just below the surface has been studied in two excavations by archaeologists from the University of the Witwatersrand and Toronto.

==Canteen Kopje Skull==
The [[Canteen Kopje Skull]] was found in the vicinity in 1925 by diamond digger Kenneth Kemp, working 2.4 m down at an unrecorded locality at Canteen Kopje. A number of fitting skull fragments were presented by Kemp to the magistrate J.G. van Alphen, who in turn donated them to the McGregor Museum. They were studied soon afterwards by [[Robert Broom]], who described it in ''Nature'' in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Broom | first1 = R. | year = 1929 | title = Australoid elements in the Korannas | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 124 | issue = 3127| page = 507 | bibcode=1929Natur.124..507B | doi = 10.1038/124507a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = L.H. | year = 1948 | title = The Canteen Koppie skull | url = | journal = South African Science | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 156–157 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Broom’s reconstruction, the skull appeared to have features similar to an allegedly archaic skeleton found at Boskop near Johannesburg. In 2011-12 X-ray Computerised Tomography scans of the skull, carried out at the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation near Pretoria, suggested it falls within the range of variation of Khoe-San populations of the Holocene (last 12 000 years), and is not ‘archaic’ as Broom had suggested. Reconsideration of the evidence also points to it having come from the Hutton Sands and not the Younger Gravels, as previously presumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Patricia|last2=Nshimirimana|first2=Robert|last3=de Beer|first3=Frikkie|last4=Morris|first4=David|last5=Jacobson|first5=Leon|last6=Chazan|first6=Michael|last7=Horwitz|first7=Liora K.|title=Canteen Kopje: a new look at an old skull|journal=South African Journal of Science|date=Jan 2012|volume=108|issue=1-2|url=http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S0038-23532012000100017&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="77198">'''Detlev Peukert''' (September 20, 1950 in [[Gütersloh]] – May 17, 1990 in [[Hamburg]]) was a German [[historian]], noted for his studies of the relationship between what he called the "spirit of science" and [[the Holocaust]] and in [[social history]] and the [[Weimar Republic]]. Peukert taught modern history at the [[University of Essen]] and served as director of the Research Institute for the History of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi Period]]. Peukert was a member of the [[German Communist Party]] until 1978, when he joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]. A politically engaged historian, Peukert was known for his unconventional take on modern German history, and in an obituary, the British historian [[Richard Bessel]] wrote that it was a major loss that Peukert had died at the age of 39 as a result of AIDS.{{sfn|Bessel|1990|p=323-324}}

==Working class history==
Peukert was born in a working-class family in the Ruhr, his father a coal miner and his mother a housewife, and he was the first member of his family to attend university.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1991|p=245}} Many of his father's fellow coal miners had been members of either the SPD or KPD, and were sent to concentration camps during the Nazi era.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1991|p=245}} Growing up in the coal miners' milieu, where many so had been sent to concentration camps for anti-Nazi views, left Peukert very interested in the subject of outsiders in the Third Reich, as he wanted to know why so many coal miners chose to oppose the Nazi regime when so many other ordinary people were passive, indifferent or supportive of the Nazi regime.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1991|p=245}} The coal miners of the Ruhr formed a distinctive sub-culture in Germany, known for their defiant, rebellious attitude to authority, left-wing views, and their often confrontational relations with the firm of Krupp AG, Germany's biggest corporation, which in turn was owned by the Krupp family, Germany's richest family. As a student, Peukert studied under [[Hans Mommsen]] at Bochum university, and began teaching at the University of Essen starting in 1978.{{sfn|Bessel|1990|p=323}}

As a "68er" whose politics were defined by the student protests of 1968, Peukert was active in left-wing politics and joined the  [[German Communist Party]].{{sfn|Bessel|1990|p=321}} The historian Michael Zimmerman who knew Peukert as an undergraduate in the early 1970s described Peukert as active in the student federation MSP Spartakus and the DKP, but described him as a committed Communist who grew disillusioned following the expulsions of [[Rudolf Bahro]] and [[Wolf Biermann]] together with the "freeze" on discussing Euro-communism within the party following orders from East Germany.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1991|p=245}} Peukert's writings on German Communist resistance in Nazi Germany differed greatly from the party line laid down in East Germany that the entire German working class under the KPD had opposed the Nazi regime, and ultimately led to him leaving the Communist Party in 1978 to join the Social Democratic party.{{sfn|Bessel|1990|p=321}} The DKP was secretly subsidized by East Germany and as a result, the party was slavishly loyal to its East German paymasters. Peukert during his time in the Communist party had come to find the party line on history was too dogmatic and rigid as he kept finding the facts of history were more complex and nuanced than the version of history laid by the party line.{{sfn|Bessel|1990|p=321}} Peukert's work was criticized within Communist circles for his willingness to be critical of the decisions of the underground KPD in Nazi Germany, and his sensitivity to "human frailty" as he examined working class life in the Third Reich, writing that not everybody wanted to be a hero and die for their beliefs.{{sfn|Bessel|1990|p=321}}

Peukert's first book was his 1976 book ''Ruhrarbeiter gegen den Faschismus'' (''Ruhr Workers Against Fascism''), a study of anti-Nazi activities among the [[working class]] of the [[Ruhr]] during the Third Reich.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1991|p=245-246}} Reflecting his left-wing views, Peukert praised "our red grandfathers" who chose to oppose National Socialism, despite their downtrodden status, arguing that their willingness to take action when so many were passive or supportive of National Socialism, made them heroes.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1991|p=245–246}} Peukert's PhD thesis, published in 1980, was ''Die KPD im Widerstand Verfolgung und Untergrundarbeit am Rhein und Ruhr, 1933-1945'' (''The KPD in the Resistance Persecution and Underground work in the Rhine and the Ruhr 1933-1945'').{{sfn|Zimmermann|1991|p=246}} Peukert's work went beyond what the title of his PhD dissertation would suggest, as he examined the ideological motivation, organizational structure of the underground Communist Party, and the motivation and social background of a single individual Communist in the Ruhr and Rhineland convicted by German courts of belonging to the KPD.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1991|p=246}} Peukert's work on the Communist resistance led him to engage in many bitter, polemical disputes with his former associates in the Communist Party who did not like his conclusions.{{sfn|Bessel|1990|p=323}}

From the right, criticism of ''Die KPD im Widerstand Verfolgung und Untergrundarbeit am Rhein und Ruhr, 1933-1945'' came from the American historian [[Albert Lindemann]] who complained that Peukert's focus on Communist resistance in the Rhineland and Ruhr regions did not merit a 460-page long book, through Lindemann wrote that wrote the book was not "an exercise in hagiography" and praised Peukert for his "critical remarks" about East German historiography.{{sfn|Lindemann|1982|p=205}} On the broader subject of Communism, Lindemann wrote that Peukert's book was flawed by what the reviewer considered his moral blind spot, writing that for Peukert fascism was "a convenient absolute evil; anti-fascism, however flawed in its particulars is thus in some ultimate sense heroic".{{sfn|Lindemann|1982|p=205}} Lindemann wrote that "the author [Peukert] appears to consider it absurd to suggest the KPD and the NSDAP morally resembled each other. Yet Stalinism in the 1930s was at least as brutish in form as Hitlerlism and was responsible, at least until 1939, for many more deaths, indeed for organized murder on an unparalleled scale. The KPD enthusiastically associated itself with the nightmarish inhumanities of Stalin's rule".{{sfn|Lindemann|1982|p=205}} Lindemann ended his review that Peukert's approach in considering Communist resistance in Nazi Germany to be "heroic" was wrong as the subject of "Communist heroism" in Nazi Germany was more morally nuanced than what Peukert would consider.{{sfn|Lindemann|1982|p=205}}

==Historian of ''Alltagsgeschichte'' in the Third Reich==
Peukert was a leading expert in ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' ("history of everyday life") and his work often examined the effect of Nazi social policies on ordinary Germans and on persecuted groups such as Jews and Roma.{{sfn|Bessel|1990|p=321}} The subject of ''Alltagsgeschichte'' had first been established as a subect in the 1970s, and had first attracted attention when [[Martin Broszat]] and his protégés launched the "Bavaria project" in 1973, intended to document everyday life in [[Bavaria]] in the Third Reich.{{sfn|Nolan|1988|p=57}} Broszat had begun the study of ''Alltagsgeschichte'' in the early 1970s with two goals. The first was to counter what Broszat considered to be the excessively "from above" high politics approach to writing about Nazi Germany which largely saw the story of the Third Reich by looking at the actions of Hitler and the rest of the Nazi elite and treating almost everybody else in Germany as merely passive objects controlled and manipulated by the state.{{sfn|Nolan|1988|p=57}} Broszat wanted to treat the German people as subjects in their own lives during the Nazi era, making choices in their everyday lives, both for good and ill, albeit within a reduced range.{{sfn|Nolan|1988|p=57}} The second goal of Broszat with ''Alltagsgeschichte'' was to end the "monumentalization" of the men involved in the July 20 ''putsch'' in 1944, with Broszat complaining treated the story of resistance in Nazi Germany as one of few conservatives from the traditional elites in the aristocracy, the military, the bureaucracy, and the diplomatic corps struggling to overthrow the Nazi regime.{{sfn|Nolan|1988|p=57}} Broszat wished to examine resistance by ordinary people at least in part to show there was resistance other than those involved in the 20 July ''putsch'' attempt.{{sfn|Nolan|1988|p=57}}

Peukert admitted to being influenced by Broszat's work with the "Bavaria Project", but he gave another reason for becoming interested in ''alltagsgeschichte'' in 1979.{{sfn|Nolan|1988|p=57}} In January 1979, the 1978 American TV mini-series ''Holocaust'' was shown in West Germany and caused a sensation, being watched by 50% of West Germans. The airing of ''Holocaust'' first time that many Germans born after 1945 had learned about the Holocaust, which was something of a taboo subject for the first decades after 1945.{{sfn|Nolan|1988|p=57}} Writing in 1981, Peukert wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Looking back, people's own everyday experience seemed to have been so different that they could not find themselves in the picture which historians painted, because in their remembrance the everyday life situation was often viewed positively. Even for those who strove for a critical coming to terms [''Bewältigung''] with their experience of repression, of yielding to the temptations of the regime and of involvement with criminal inhumanity, even they often remained at loss about how to build a bridge from their own experience to the contemporary historical critical state of knowledge".{{sfn|Nolan|1988|p=57-58}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; In the early 1980s, Peukert began teaching ''Alltagsgeschichte'', until then a subject mostly ignored by German historians before the 1970s, as he argued that the subject was important.{{sfn|Bessel|1990|p=321}} Peukert wanted to explore why so many ordinary Germans who lived through the Nazi era remembered it as a time of "normality" and often in a very positive way while at the same time genocide was taking place.{{sfn|Nolan|1988|p=58}} Peukert argued there was a disconnect between the popular image today of the Nazi era as a time of unparalleled horror vs. the way in which most ordinary Germans remembered it as a time of benign "normality", and that studying ''Alltagsgeschichte'' would explore what the Third Reich was actually like in "everyday life".{{sfn|Nolan|1988|p=58}} In the early 1980s, ''Alltagsgeschichte'' exploded in popularity in West Germany with numerous work groups being set, usually by left-wing groups, to explore the history of their home towns in the Nazi era.{{sfn|Nolan|1988|p=59}} The study of ''Alltagsgeschichte'' was greatly influenced by the History Workshop movement in Britain set up by the Marxist historian [[E.P. Thompson]] and like the British Workshop groups, many involved in the ''Alltagsgeschichte'' study groups were not historians with a disproportional number of the volunteers being high-school students.{{sfn|Nolan|1988|p=59}} The American historian Mary Nolan wrote with some envy about the way in which thousands of German high school students became involved in the ''Alltagsgeschichte'' study groups, observing that it was simply inconceivable that thousands of American high school students would join study groups to research the histories of their home towns in the 1930s-1940s as most Americans have no interest in history.{{sfn|Nolan|1988|p=63}} In 1984, Peukert was awarded the annual culture prize given by the city of Essen for his work with a history workshop group in Essen.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1991|p=248}}

A historian with a very strong work ethic, Peukert believed that history "belonged to everybody", not just the historians, and was very energetic in attempting to break down barriers to interest the public in history by settling up exhibitions about  ''Alltagsgeschichte'' in the Third Reich.{{sfn|Bessel|1990|p=322}} In 1980, Peukert planned the historical exhibition at the Old Synagogue of Essen on the subject "Resistance and Persecution in Essen 1933-1945".{{sfn|Zimmerman|1991|p=247}} In 1984, Peukert won the Maeier-Leibnitz prize for his habilitation on youth policy in Germany in late 19th and early 20th centuries.{{sfn|Bessel|1990|p=322}}  Moving beyond the subject of resistance (''Widerstand''), Peukert became interested in "oppositionality" (''Widerständigkeit'') in everyday life in Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1991|p=246}} Peukert was especially interested in the [[Edelweiss Pirates]], a group of working class teenagers in Cologne and the other cities of the Rhineland who formed a distinctive anti-Nazi subculture, and who often fought the Hitler Youth.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1991|p=246}} Another related area of interest for Peukert was resistance, opposition and dissent in the Third Reich. Peukert developed a pyramid model starting with "nonconformity" (behavior in private that featured partial rejection of the Nazi regime) running to "refusal of co-operation" (''Verweigerung'') to "protest", and finally to ''Widerstand'' (resistance), which involved total rejection of the Nazi regime.{{sfn|Kershaw|2000|p=205}}

In particular, Peukert looked at how in "everyday life" in Nazi Germany, aspects of both "normality" and "criminality" co-existed with another.{{sfn|Kershaw|2000|p=230}} For Peukert, to examine resistance and opposition in ''Alltagsgeschichte'' with no reference to the broader society led the historian no-where, and to resolve this problem he wrote his 1982 book ''Volksgenossen und Gemeinschaftsfremde'' (''National Comrades and Community Aliens''), which was translated into English as ''Inside Nazi Germany'' in 1987.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1991|p=246}} The book's title was taken from the two legal categories which the entire population of Germany was divided into during the Nazi era; the ''Volksgenossen'' (National Comrades) who were the people who belonged to the ''Volksgemeinschaft'' and the  ''gemeinschaftsfremde'' (Community Aliens) who did not.  In ''Volksgenossen und Gemeinschaftsfremde'', Peukert  looked at the experience of "everyday life" in Nazi Germany in its totality, examining both conformity and resistance equally to examine how all Germans, not just those in sub-cultures like the Edelweiss Pirates or the Ruhr miners had behaved.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1991|p=246}}

Peukert also sought to critically explore why so many ordinary Germans remembered the Third Reich as a time of blissful normality, arguing that there was a certain selectivity to what many people sought to remember, arguing that memories of genocide were not ones to cherish.{{sfn|Nolan|1988|p=74}} Peukert further argued that: "the memory of an unpolitical "normality" in the 1930s could have taken hold of the collective memory also because of a certain structural parallelism existed because of the "normality" of the first German economic miracle in the 1930s and the economic miracle of the 1950s".{{sfn|Nolan|1988|p=74}} Peukert argued that the central feature of the policies of the National Socialist regime in shaping the ''Volksgemeinschaft'' was racism with the emphasis on "selection" of those considered to have "healthy" Aryan genes and the "eradication" of those who were considered not.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1991|p=246}} In the final chapter of ''Volksgenossen und Gemeinschaftsfremde'', Peukert wrote: "In the use of terror against ''gemeinschaftsfremde'' ("community aliens") and in the fostering of an atomized, compulsorily normalized society, National Socialism demonstrated all too clearly and with lethal consistency the pathological, warped features of the modern civilization process".{{sfn|Zimmermann|1991|p=246}} As ''Inside Nazi Germany'' as the book was titled in English, ''Volksgenossen und Gemeinschaftsfremde'' is regarded as the most "standard" text about ''alltagsgeschichte'' in the Third Reich.{{sfn|Bessel|1990|p=322}} A 1990 review by the German historian Rolf Schörken called ''Volksgenossen und Gemeinschaftsfremde'' a brilliant book explaining how Nazi ''Herrschaft'' (domination) of Germany rested upon the "multi-layered, contradictory and complex realities" of "everyday life" in Germany.{{sfn|Crews|1992|p=326}}

Peukert wrote that the popular claim, made after the war, that the Nazi regime stayed in power only because of terror was incorrect.{{sfn|Crews|1992|p=325}} Peukert wrote though terror played a role in sustaining the Nazi regime, the majority of victims of the violence of that the German state inflicted in the Nazi era tended to be people considered to be "outsiders" in Germany like Jews, the Romany, "Marxists", the mentally ill, the disabled, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, and the "asocial", and that for the most part, the state in the Nazi era left ordinary Germans alone to live their lives as they pleased.{{sfn|Crews|1992|p=325}} Peukert wrote with the "popular experience" of most Germans in the Nazi era, there were no clear-cut "villains and victims" with the American historian David Crews writing that Peukert had presented "a complex, morally disturbing picture" of ordinary people adjusting to what Peukert called "the multiple ambiguities of ordinary people".{{sfn|Crews|1992|p=325}} Peukert wrote that most ordinary Germans lived in a "grey zone" choosing support, accommodation and nonconformity at various times, never totally supporting the Nazi regime, but willing to accommodate themselves to the regime provided it served their own self-interests.{{sfn|Crews|1992|p=325}} As part of his studies into "everyday life" in Nazi Germany, Peukert very strongly argued that it was not a black-and-white picture with many of those taking part in youthful sub-cultures like the Edelweiss Pirates and the Swing Kids, grumbling at work, and attending illegal jazz dance sessions at very least partially endorsed the regime and accepted the "Hitler myth" of a brilliant, benevolent ''Führer''.{{sfn|Nolan|1988|p=56}} Peukert noted those who took part in such manifestations of "oppositionality" like the Swing Kids and the Edelweiss Pirates were challenging the regime, but not in such a way as not to threaten its hold on power, which is why Peukert called these activities "oppositionality" rather than resistance.{{sfn|Nolan|1988|p=56}} In particular, Peukert wrote the Edelweiss Pirates by settling themselves apart from adults and those not from the Rhineland were in fact weakening the traditional German working class sub-culture.{{sfn|Nolan|1988|p=56}} Peukert wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The Third Reich cannot have failed to leave its mark on all members of society...Even resistance fighters who did not conform were weighted by the experience of persecution, by the sense of their own impotence, and of the petty compromises that were necessary for survival. The system did its work on the anti-fascists too, and often enough it worked despite the shortcomings of the fascists themselves".{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=325}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Peukert wrote that even those Germans who went into "inner emigration", withdrawing from society as much as possible to avoid dealing with the Nazis as much as they could, helped the system worked.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=325}} Peukert wrote that "inner emigration" led to "...self-absorption and self-sufficiency, to the mixture of "apathy and pleasure-seeking" described by one wartime diarist...Paradoxically, then, even the population's counter-reaction to the National Socialist pressure of mobilization served to stabilize the system".{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=325}}

Using a phrase coined by the British historian Sir [[Ian Kershaw]], Peukert argued that the "Hitler myth" of a brilliant, infallible, and larger-than-life ''Führer''-a charismatic statesman who was also a talented general and artist-was the main psychological mechanism that held together popular support and acquiescence in the regime as even many Germans who did not like the Nazis accepted the "Hitler myth".{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=325}} Peukert noted that Hitler's role in standing in many ways above his system, with the standard explanation being that  ''der Führer'' was so busy with questions of war, art and statecraft that he had to delegate policy in the domestic sphere to his subordinates  meant that most Germans did not blame the failures of the Nazi system on Hitler.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=325}} Peukert noted that instead of blaming Hitler, most Germans held to the hope that if only ''der Führer'' would pay attention to domestic policy, then matters would be set right.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=325}} Peukert argued that many Germans disliked the NSDAP functionaries who assumed such power in their neighborhoods and believed if only their "abuses" were brought to Hitler's attention, he would dismiss them.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=325}} In common with many historians, Peukert noted that the "Hitler myth" of a superhuman ''Führer'' who was steadily making Germany into the world's greatest power first began to fall apart with the German defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad as Hitler had staked his personal prestige on a victory on the Volga, repeatedly stating in his radio speeches in the fall of 1942 that he was executing his master-plan for victory at Stalingrad.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=325}} The fact that Hitler's "master-plan" for victory at Stalingrad instead ended with the destruction of the entire German 6th Army, made worse by the fact that it was the hands of the "Asiatic hordes" as Nazi propaganda always called the Red Army, was a terrible blow to Hitler's prestige, but even then the "Hitler myth" continued to exert it power, albeit in a diluted form .{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=325}} Against the traditional view that the "Hitler myth" came "from above", being the work of Joseph Goebbels's Propaganda Ministry, Peukert argued that the "Hitler myth" came just as much "from below" as ordinary people chose to invest their hopes in the "Hitler myth" as a way of rationalizing their passivity in the Third Reich.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=325}}

Another interest for Peukert were the experiences of youth in the Imperial, Weimar and Nazi era. In two books, ''Grenzen der Sozialdiziplinierung Austieg und Krise der deutschen Jugendfürsorge von 1878 bis 1932'' (''The Frontiers of Social Discipline The Rise and Crisis of German Youth 1878 to 1932'') and its sequel, ''Jugend zwischen Krieg und Krise Lebenswetlen von Arbeiterjungen in der Weimarer Republik'' (''Youth Between War and Crisis The World of Working Class Boys in the Weimar Republic''), Peukert examined how the concept of ''jugendlicher'' ("youth") changed from the 19th into the 20th centuries and how the state sought to dominate the lives of youth people via education and mandatory activities.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1991|p=246}} Both books were part of Peukert' habilitation, and reflected his lifelong interest in the experiences of young people in the Imperial, Weimar and Nazi eras.{{sfn|Bessel|1990|p=322}}

Peukert was one of the first historians to make a detailed examination of the persecution of the [[Romani people|Romani]]. Peukert often compared Nazi policies towards Roma with Nazi policies towards Jews. On the basis of his research into popular attitudes towards "outsiders" in the Third Reich, Peukert came up with the concept of "everyday racism" to explain the contrast between the "normality" of life for most Germans while genocide was being committed.{{sfn|Nolan|1988|p=77}} By "everyday racism", Peukert meant a certain causal racism that allowed people to accept violence being committed against those considered to be different.{{sfn|Nolan|1988|p=77}} Peukert wrote about: "a fatal continuum of discrimination, selection, and rejection/elimination, whose monstrous consequences perhaps remained hidden from most contemporaries in their totality but whose inhumane daily racism was not only constantly and everywhere present but until today has not been critically worked through".{{sfn|Nolan|1988|p=77}} As part of his research into "everyday racism", Peukert explored how ordinary people use of disparaging language to describe the homeless allowed them to see as justified the mass incarceration of the homeless into the concentration camps under the grounds that the homeless were part of the "asocial" threatening the ''volksgemeinschaft''.{{sfn|Nolan|1988|p=77}} In his research into opinion during the war years, Peukert noted that thousands of Polish and Frenchmen were brought to work in Germany as slave laborers to replace German men who been called up into the Wehrmacht.{{sfn|Kater|1992|p=292}} Those Poles and sometimes Frenchmen found to be enjoying sexual relationships with German women were harshly punished, being publicity hanged and on some occasions  castrated as "race-defilers" threatening the ''Volksgemeinschaft''.{{sfn|Kater|1992|p=292}} Peukert noted even through the ''Volksgemeinschaft'' as depicted in Nazi propaganda never really existed, many ordinary Germans if not sharing the exactly the same racial ideology as their regime seemed to approve of these executions as necessary to protect German racial purity.{{sfn|Kater|1992|p=292}} As a homosexual, Peukert was especially interested in the Nazi persecution of homosexuals. As a gay man, Peukert was especially troubled by those who used the homosexuality of Nazi leaders like [[Ernst Röhm]] as an excuse for homophobia, writing: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The National Socialists' fundamental hostility to homosexuals should not be trivialized by references to individual Nazi leaders' homosexuality. The disgraceful denunciation of SA leader Ernst Röhm, precisely by the Social Democratic press, to gain votes in 1930, thus sullying its own liberal tradition, was taken up again after the so-called Röhm ''putsch'' of 1934 and used by the National Socialists to justify their murderous actions".{{sfn|Zimmermann|1991|p=247}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another interest of Peukert were the youth movements like the Swing Kids and the Edelweiss Pirates that clashed with the Nazi regime. The American historian Peter Baldwin criticized Peukert for treating the Swing Kids and Edelweiss Pirates sent to concentration camps as morally just as much as victims of the National Socialist regime as the Jews exterminated in the death camps.{{sfn|Baldiwn|1990|p=33}} Baldwin took Peukert to task for his 1987 statement: "As long as the Nazis needed armament workers and future soldiers, they could not exterminate German youth as they exterminated the Poles and Jews".{{sfn|Baldwin|1990|p=33}} Baldwin called this statement "a wholly fanciful suggestion" that the Nazi leaders were planning to exterminate the young people of Germany, going on to comment that the reader should "note also the order of priority among the actual victims".{{sfn|Baldwin|1990|p=33}} Baldwin wrote that "This is Reagan's Bitburg fallacy of the SS as victims, this time committed from the Left".{{sfn|Baldwin|1990|p=33}} In 1985, the U.S. president Ronald Reagan had taken part in a memorial ceremony at a cemetery in Bitburg whose graves were those of soldiers killed in the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS. When criticized for honoring the sacrifice of SS men, Reagan had stated those Germans killed fighting in the SS were just as much victims of Hitler as the Jews exterminated in the death camps, and that therefore placing a memorial wreath honoring the memory of the SS men buried at the Bitburg cemetery was no different from placing a memorial wreath at Auschwitz. Reagan's statement that the SS and the Jews exterminated by the SS were all equally victims of Hitler is known to historians as the Bitburg fallacy.{{sfn|Baldwin|1990|p=3-4}}

In his 1987 book ''Spuren des Widerstands Die Bergarbeiterbewegung im Dritten Reich und im Exil'' (''Traces of Resistance The Miners' Movement in the Third Reich and In Exile''), Peukert began with the question "How does one write a history of continual failure?", which he answered with "To write a history of the resistance from the "loser's" viewpoint means trying to understand why, in spite of everything, they did not give up".{{sfn|Zimmerman|1991|p=247}} Peukert argued even through the Social Democratic and Communist miners failed utterly in their attempts to overthrow the Nazi dictatorship, their willingness to take a stand, no matter how hopeless, and to suffer for their beliefs in the concentration camps meant that they should not be dismissed by historians as "losers".{{sfn|Zimmerman|1991|p=247}} In the late 1980s, Peukert had been working as a project for a comprehensive ''alltagsgeschichte'' in Nazi Germany in northern Germany that was intended to be the counterpart to the "Bavaria project" led by Martin Broszat that sought to produce a comprehensive ''alltagsgeschichte'' in Nazi Germany in Bavaria.{{sfn|Bessel|1990|p=323}}

==Problems of modernity==
In his 1982 book ''Volksgenossen und Gemeinschaftsfremde'' (''National Comrades and Community Aliens''), Peukert argued that the Nazi regime's:&lt;blockquote&gt;"racism offered a model for a new order in society...It rested on the racially legitimated removal of all elements that deviated from the norm, refractory youth, idlers, the asocial, prostitutes, homosexuals, people who were incompetent or failures at work, the disabled. National Socialist eugenics...laid down criteria of assessment that were applicable to the population at whole".&lt;ref&gt;Pendas, Devin &amp; Roseman, Mark ''Beyond the Racial State'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2017 page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; Peukert described the aim of National Socialism as:&lt;blockquote&gt;“ The goal was an utopian ''Volksgemeinschaft'', totally under police surveillance, in which any attempt at nonconformist behaviour, or even any hint or intention of such behaviour, would be visited with terror”.&lt;ref&gt;Peukert, Detlev ''Inside Nazi Germany: Conformity, Opposition and Racism In Everyday Life'', London : Batsford, 1987 page 220.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; At the same time, Peukert argued that the  ''völkisch'' ideology was not "an inexplicable, sudden appearance of 'medieval barbarism' in a progressive society" but rather "demonstrated with heightened  clarity and murderous consistency, the pathologies and seismic fractures of the modern civilizing progress".&lt;ref&gt;Pendas, Devin &amp; Roseman, Mark ''Beyond the Racial State'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2017 page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Peukert's thesis that all aspects of the National Socialist regime reflected the ''völkisch'' ideology and that far from being a break with modernity, that the National Socialism regime represented at very least an aspect of modernity was very novel at the time and proved to be influential on the historiography of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Pendas, Devin &amp; Roseman, Mark ''Beyond the Racial State'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2017 page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fascinated by the theories of [[Max Weber]], Peukert began his last book with a quote from Weber who warned that the modern age would bring about "experts without spirit" and the "hedonist without a heart".{{sfn|Zimmerman|1990|p=247}} Peukert went on to write about this modern age: &lt;blockquote&gt;"At its beginning there is immense loneliness and religious distress, which however help to bring about an unsuspected enhancement of the individual's attachment to this life, his rational control of the world and intellectual autonomy; at its end we may find routine "enslavement to the future", emptied of all meaning and causing the dynamic, expansive force of rationalization to ossify. In both cases, however, the growing pressure of suffering is the price paid for the gain in rationality".{{sfn|Zimmerman|1990|p=247}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; For Peukert, inspired by the theories of Weber, saw the purpose of his work to help foster experts who have spirit and hedonists with a heart.{{sfn|Zimmerman|1990|p=247}} Through Peukert worked primarily as a historian (an occupation that has far greater prestige in Germany than it does in the English-speaking world), he also wrote about at times about literacy theory, philosophy, and anthropology.{{sfn|Zimmerman|1990|p=247}} Peukert was also politically engaged, and his last essay written shortly before his death, ''Rechtsradikalismus in historisher Perspektive'' (''Right-wing Radicalism in the Historical Perspective'') warned against the rise of the Republican Party led by the former SS-''Unterscharführer'' [[Franz Schönhuber]], which had some popular support in Germany with its call for a ban on Turkish "guest workers".{{sfn|Zimmerman|1990|p=247}} In 1988, Peukert was appointed director of the Research Center for the History of National Socialism at Hamburg University and in 1989 was appointed Chair of Modern History at the University of Essen.{{sfn|Zimmerman|1990|p=247}} The attempt to appoint Peukert to Hamburg University caused much opposition from the more conservative historians, who made it clear they did not want an openly gay man teaching at their university.{{sfn|Bessel|1990|p=323}} Until 1994, [[Paragraph 175]] was still in effect in Germany as homophobia was rampant in Germany long after the end of the Third Reich, and many historians did not want to work with a "criminal" like Peukert.

One of the central issues of German historiography has been the debate over the ''[[Sonderweg]]'' question, namely whatever German history in the 19th and 20th centuries developed along such lines as to make the Third Reich inevitable.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=319-320}} The "[[Bielefeld School]]" associated with [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], [[Jurgen Kocka]] and others have argued for a failed modernization of Germany with the ''Junkers'' holding inordinate political and social power in the 19th century that led to Nazi Germany in the 20th century. The most famous riposte to the ''Sonderweg'' thesis was the 1984 book ''The Peculiarities of German history'' by two British Marxist historians, [[David Blackbourn]] and [[Geoff Eley]]. In ''The Peculiarities of German History'', Eley and Blackourn argued for the "normality" of modern German history.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=319-320}}

Peukert rejected both viewpoints, instead arguing for seeing Nazi Germany as the product of the "crisis of classical modernity".{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=320}} One of the central objections to the "normality" thesis promoted by Eley and Blackbourn has been if Germany was such a "normal" and "modern" nation, how does one explain the Holocaust?{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=320}} Though Peukert rejected the ''Sonderweg'' thesis, he criticized Eley and Blackbourn for associating modernity with "progress", and argued for a "skeptical de-coupling of modernity and progress".{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=320}} Peukert argued that historians must: &lt;blockquote&gt;"raise questions about the pathological and seismic fractures within modernity itself, and about the implicit destructive tendencies of modern industrial class society, which National Socialism made explicit and which elevated it into mass destruction...This approach is supported by a wide variety of debates that have gone within the social sciences, using such notions as 'social disciplining' (Foucault), the pathological consequences of the civilizing progress (Elias), or the colonisation of the ''Lebenswelten'' (Habermas).{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=320}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Peukert often wrote on the [[social history|social]] and [[cultural history]] of the [[Weimar Republic]] whose problems he saw as more severe examples of the problems of [[modernity]]. Peukert argued that societies that have reached "classical modernity" are characterized by advanced capitalist economic organization and mass production, by the "rationalization" of culture and society, massive bureaucratization of society, the "spirit of science" assuming a dominant role in popular discourses, and the "social disciplining" and "normalization" of the majority of ordinary people.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=320}} Peukert was greatly influenced by the theories of [[Max Weber]], but unlike many other scholars, who saw Weber attempting to rebut [[Karl Marx]], he viewed Weber's principle intellectual opponent as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=320}} Peukert wrote that for Weber, the principle problems of modern Germany were:
*The increasing "rationalization" of everyday life via bureaucratization and secularism had led to a "complete demystification of the world".{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=320}}
*The popularity of the "spirit of science" had led to a misguided belief that science could solve all problems within the near-future.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=321}}

Contrary to the "Bielefield school", Peukert argued by the time of the Weimar Republic, Germany had broken decisively with the past, and had become a thoroughly "modern" society in all its aspects.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=321}} Peukert argued that the very success of German modernization inspired by the "dream of reason" meant the contradictions and problems of "classical modernity" were felt more acutely in Germany than elsewhere.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=321}} For Peukert, the problems of "classical modernity" were:
*The very success of modernization encourages "utopian" hopes that all problems can be solved via the "spirit of science" that are inevitably dashed.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=321}}                     
*Modern society causes unavoidable "irritations" which led to people looking backwards to "traditions" and/or a "clean" modernity where the state would attempt to solve social problems via radical means.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=321}}
*The "demystification of the world" leads people to seek faith and self-validation either via irrational theories such as "race" and/or a charismatic leader who would revitalize society.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=321}}
*Modernity creates a mass society that can be more easily manipulated and mobilized to ends that can be either moral or amoral.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=321}}

Peukert argued that starting in 1929 that the disjoint between Weimar democracy vs. the problems of "classical modernity" started to fell apart when faced with the Great Depression.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=324}} Peukert maintained that the Weimar Republic was a muddled system built out of the compromises between so many different interests with for instance [[Weimar Coalition]] consisting of the left-wing SPD, the liberal DDP, and the centre-right ''Zentrum'' being the only political parties wholeheartedly committed to the Weimar republic.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=324}} Other competing interests in Germany included the struggle between men vs. women, farmers vs. towns, Catholics vs. Protestants, and unions vs. business.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=324}} Peukert argued that the creation of the Weimar welfare state in the 1920s had "politicized" economic and social relationships, and in the context of the Great Depression where economic resources were shrinking set off a Darwinian struggle for scare economic resources between various societal groups.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=324}} Peukert wrote by 1930 German society had with the notable exceptions of the working class and the Catholic milieus had turned into a mass of competing social interests engaged in a Darwinian ''verteilungskampf'' (distribution struggle).{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=324}} In this context, Peukert argued that for much of German society, some sort of authoritarian government was welcome out of the belief that an authoritarian regime would favor one's own special interest group at the expense of the others.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=324}} Given the ''verteilungskampf'', Peukert argued that this explain why the "presidential governments"-which from March 1930 onward by-passed the ''Reichstag'' and that answered only to President Paul von Hindenburg-governing Germany in a highly authoritarian manner were so approved of by German elites.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=324}} Peukert further maintained that the Hitler government of 1933, which was the last of the "presidential governments" was merely the final attempt by traditional elites in Germany to safeguard their status.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=324}} Peukert insisted that National Socialism was not some retrogression to the past, but instead reflected the "dark side" of modernity, writing: "The NSDAP was at once a symptom and a solution to the crisis".{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=320}}

Peukert saw his work as a "warning against the fallacious notion that the normality of industrial society is harmless" and urged historians to consider the "dark side of modernity", instead of seeing modernity as a benign development that was always for the best.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=327}} Peukert wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The view that National Socialism was...one of the pathological development forms of modernity does not imply that barbarism is the inevitable logical outcome of modernization. The point, rather, is that we should not analyse away the tensions between progressive and aberrant features by making a glib opposition between modernity and tradition: we should call attention to the rifts and danger-zones which result from the civilizing process itself, so that the opportunities for human emancipation which it simultaneously creates can be more thoroughly charted. The challenges of Nazism shows that the evolution to modernity is not a one-way trip to freedom. The struggle for freedom must always be resumed afresh, both in inquiry and in action".{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=327}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Peukert argued that though ''völkisch'' racism was extreme, it was by no means exceptional, and instead reflected the logic promoted by the social sciences throughout the West which had argued that the state can and should foster "normality" while identifying "the non-conformity that is to be segregated and eliminated".{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=323}} Seen in this perspective, for Peukert the genocide against the Jews and Romany were only part of a wider project to eliminate all unhealthy genes from the ''volksgemeinschaft''.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=323}} Peukert argued for an integrated view of Nazi Germany with the social policies to encourage "healthy Aryan" families to have more children, the "social racism" that saw the bodies of "healthy Aryan" women as belonging to the ''volksgemeinschaft'', the effort to sterilize "anti-social families" and the extermination of Jews and Romany as part and parcel of the same project.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=323}} Likewise, Peukert argued that Nazi Germany was not some freakish "aberration" from the norms of Western civilization, as he noted that the ideas about eugenics and racial superiority that the National Socialists drew upon were widely embraced throughout the Western world.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=323}}

In the same way, Peukert noted in ''Inside Nazi Germany'' as part of his argument against the "freakish aberration" view of the Nazi era that homosexual sex had been made illegal in Germany with Paragraph 175 in 1871 and all the Nazis did with the 1935 version of Paragraph 175 was to make it tougher, as the 1935 version of Paragraph 175 made being homosexual in and of itself a criminal offense, whereas the 1871 version of Paragraph 175 had only made homosexual sex a criminal offense.{{sfn|Peukert|1987|p=220}} Peukert also noted against the "freakish aberration" view of Nazi Germany that the 1935 version of Paragraph 175 stayed on the statue books in West Germany until 1969 as it was considered to be a "healthy law", leading to German homosexuals who survived the concentration camps continuing to be convicted all through the 1950s and 1960s under exactly the same law that sent them to the concentration camps under the [[Third Reich]].{{sfn|Peukert|1987|p=220}} Peukert further commented that the Federal Republic of Germany never paid reparations to those homosexuals who survived the concentration camps as Paragraph 175 was considered a "healthy law" that was worth keeping, and those homosexual survivors who suffered so much in the concentration camps remained outcasts in post-war Germany.{{sfn|Peukert|1987|p=220}} Writing in the 1970s and 1980s at a time when Paragraph 175 was still in effect, Peukert argued that the sort of homophobia which made the Nazi persecution of homosexuals possible, was still very much present in modern West Germany.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=327}} In the same way, Peukert wrote the "everyday racism" that allowed ordinary people to accept violence directed against "others" in the Third Reich had not disappeared, noting that many ordinary Germans were willing to accept neo-Nazi skinheads beating up Turkish guest workers because they were "foreigners".{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=327}} Crews writing in 1992 wrote that the "recent epidemic of violence against 'foreigners' in both the 'old' and 'new' ''Länder'' suggests he may have been right".{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=327}}

Peukert wrote that through the Nazis did use an "anti-modernist" disclosure inspired by the theories of [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], but their solution to the problems of "classical modernity" were not "merely backward-looking".{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=324}} Peukert wrote the attempt to create the ''volksgemeinschaft'' was not an effort to return to the pre—industrial age, but rather a purged and cleansed "classical modernity".{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=324}} Peukert wrote: "Eclectic as regards to ideas, but up to date in its attitude to technology, National Socialism laid claims to offer a "conclusive" new answer to the challenges and discomforts of the modern age".{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=324}} Peukert wrote that: "The much heralded ''Volksgemeinschaft'' of the National Socialists in no way abolished the real contradictions of a modern industrial society; rather these were inadvertently aggravated by the use of highly modern industrial and propaganda techniques for achieving war readiness. In fact, the long-term characteristics of a modern industrial society, which had been interrupted by the world economic crisis, continued to run their course".{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=324-325}} Reflecting the influence of functionalist historians like [[Martin Broszat]] and [[Hans Mommsen]], Peukert wrote the inability to achieve the idealized ''volksgemeinschaft'' of their dreams left the National Socialists increasingly frustrated and led them to lash out against groups considered to be enemies of the ''volksgemeinschaft'' as a way of compensation.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=325}}

Peukert argued that for the National Socialists' "it was more important to travel hopefully than to arrive", as for the Nazis had no solutions to the problems of classical modernity other than a creating a sense of movement towards the vague goal of the utopian society that was to be the  ''volksgemeinschaft''.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=326}} Peukert wrote the "violent answers" of the Nazis to the "contradictions of modernity" were not the basis of a successful social order, and as such the dynamism of the Nazi movement was primarily negative and the "movement" had a strong self-destructive streak.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=326}} Peukert noted that having promised "paradise" in the form of the ''volksgemeinschaft'' under the Weimar republic, there was much frustration within the Nazi movement when in 1933 the ''volksgemeinschaft'' in reality did not meet the idealized version of the ''volksgemeinschaft'' that had promised before 1933.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=326}} Peukert wrote that because of this frustration that the Nazis gave the  ''volksgemeinschaft'' an increasing negative definition, lashing out in increasing vicious ways against any perceived "threats" to the  ''volksgemeinschaft''.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=326}} As part of this trend, there was a tendency as the Third Reich went along for the Nazis to seek to erase all nonconformity, deviance and differences from German society with anyone who was not a perfect ''Volksgenossen'' ("National Comrade") considered to be in someway an "enemy".{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=326}} In this way, the violence that the Nazis had directed against "outsiders" in Germany had gradually started to be applied against at least some of the previous "insiders" as those ''Volksgenossen'' who for whatever reason did not quite measure up to the ideal found there was no place for them in the ''volksgemeinschaft''.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=327}} Peukert concluded that the National Socialists failed to create the idealized ''volksgemeinschaft'', but they unwittingly laid the foundations for the stability of the Adenauer era in 1950s West Germany by promoting a mass consumerist society combined with extreme violence against their "enemies", which made politically engagement dangerous.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=327}} Peukert argued that what many considered to be the most notable aspect of the Adenauer era, namely an atomized, materialistic society made up of people devoted to consumerism and generally indifferent to politics was the Nazi legacy in West  Germany.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=327}}

In the last chapter of his 1987 book ''Die Weimarer Republik : Krisenjahre der Klassischen Moderne'', Peukert quoted [[Walter Benjamin]]'s remark: "The concept of progress must be rooted in catastrophe. The fact that things just "carry on" ''is'' the catastrophe".{{sfn|Zimmerman|1991|p=247}}

==Dominican studies==
Peukert was fluent in Spanish, and was very interested in the history of Latin America, especially the [[Dominican Republic]], which he spent much of the late 1980s visiting.{{sfn|Bessel|1990|p=323}} As the name Detlev is hard for Spanish speakers to pronounce, Peukert took to calling himself "Julio" Peukert.{{sfn|Bessel|1990|p=323}} Peukert was interested in youth policy in the Dominican Republic and spent much time in the ''barrios'' (slums) of [[Santo Domingo]] working as a volunteer helping poor teenagers.{{sfn|Bessel|1990|p=323}} In 1986, Peuket published a book in Spanish ''Anhelo de Dependencia Las Ofertas de Anexion de la Republica Dominicana a los Estados Unidos en siglo XIX'' about the debate concerning American plans to annex the Dominican Republic in the 19th century.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1991|p=248}} Always a politically engaged historian, Peukert engaged in city planning for Santo Domingo and criticized the Dominican government for not doing more to help with the problems of poverty.{{sfn|Bessel|1990|p=323}} At the time of his death, Peukert had begun writing a biography of the Dominican dictator General [[Rafael Trujillo]].{{sfn|Bessel|1990|p=323}}

=="The Genesis of the 'Final Solution’ from the Spirit of Science"==
Peukert is perhaps best known for his 1989 essay “The Genesis of the 'Final Solution’ from the Spirit of Science” from his book ''Max Webers Diagnose der Moderne''. Peukert began his essay with an attack on the conservative side in the ''Historikerstreit'', stating that the obsession of Ernst Nolte with proving that Hitler had been somehow forced into committing genocide by the fear of the Soviet Union was an apologistic argument meant to diminish the horror of Auschwitz.{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=276}} Peukert further noted that on the origins of the Holocaust question that the internationalist argument that the "Final Solution to the Jewish Question" was all part of a master-plan carried out by Hitler and a few of his followers is not longer accepted by most historians with the "Final Solution" being seen instead as the product of several processes coming together at the same time.{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=277}} Peukert wrote that the ''Shoah'' was not the result solely of anti-Semitism, but was instead the a product of the “cumulative radicalization” in which “numerous smaller currents” fed into the “broad current” that led to genocide.{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=280}} Peukert wrote the Holocaust was a product of:
*the attempt to put into practice the radical theories of  ''völkisch'' antisemitism from 1933 onward together with the policy following the beginning of the Second World War of forcibly moving around millions of people.{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=277}}
*the Nazi policies of dividing the population into those of genetic "value" and "non-value" in terms of education, social policy, health policy and demographics with the theme of "selecting" those with "value" over those of "non-value".{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=277}}
*the policies of "racial hygiene" of sterilizing the "genetically unhealthy" which was followed up by the Action T4 program launched in January 1939 of killing all mentally and physically disabled Germans, which provided the prototype for the extermination of the Jews.{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=277}} The Action T4 program of killing the disabled marked the first time that an entire group had been selected for extermination based solely for their perceived genetic flaws. 
*starting with the conquest of Poland, the "forced employment of millions of foreign workers meant that the ''völkisch'' hierarchy of ''Herrenmensch'' and ''Untermensch'' became a structural feature of daily life" which provided a context for genocide as it desensitized much of the German public to the sufferings of others.{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=277}}
*the "escalation of terror" following the conquest of Poland in September 1939 and then by the "war of extermination" launched against the Soviet Union with Operation Barbarossa in June 1941 with Hitler giving the Commissar Order, unleashing the ''Einszatgruppen'' to exterminate Soviet Jews, and the orders to allow millions of Soviet POWs to stave to death.{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=277}}
*rivalries between Nazi leaders for Hitler's favor that led to the "cumulative radicalization" of racial policy was Hitler always favored those with the most radical ideas.{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=277}}
*the tendency of the Nazis to define the ''volksgemeinschaft'' in a negative sense in terms of who was to be excluded together with an xenophobic and paranoid tendency to see Germany as besieged by external and internal enemies.{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=277-278}}

Peukert wrote all "monocausal explanations of the 'Final Solution' are inadequate", but then asked if out of this "tangle of causes" one might find a "central thread" linking them all.{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=278}} Peukert suggested that this "thread" was not antisemitism-through he admitted that Jews were the largest single group of victims of the Nazi regime-but rather the "fatal racist dynamism present within the human and social sciences", which divided all people into terms of "value" and "non-value", and made the ''volkskörper'' (the collective "body" of the "German race") its main concern with the "selection" of those with healthy genes and the "eradication" of those with unhealthy genes.{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=278}} In this regard, Peukert noted the genocide against the Jews grew out of the Action T4 program which starting in January 1939 sought to liquidate all physically and mentally disabled Germans as a threat to the health of the  ''volkskörper''. Peukert wrote that it was not antisemitism per se that led to genocide, but rather the project to purge the  ''volksgemeinschaft'' of those seen as carrying unhealthy genes that was the beginning of genocide, which started with the Action T4 program. Peukert argued that the Holocaust was not inevitable, but in the story of the "cumulative radicalization" of Nazi racial policy, "the most deadly option for action was selected at every stage".{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=278}} Within the context of an ideology that divided the entire population of the world into people of "value" and people of "non-value" , decision-makers in the Nazi state had choices about what policy to pursue, and always chose the most extreme option.{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=278}} Peukert made it clear in "The Genesis of the 'Final Solution' from the Spirit of Science" that he was describing a necessary, but not a sufficient cause for the "Final Solution", arguing that without the "spirit of science" there would have been no genocide, but the "spirit of science" was not sufficient in itself for the decisions that were taken between 1939-1941.{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=278}}

Peukert argued in his essay that the late 19th and early 20th centuries had seen tremendous scientific and technological change together with, in Germany, the growth of the welfare state, which had created widespread hopes both within the government and in society that “utopia” was at hand and soon all social problems would be solved.{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=280-284}}  Peukert wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;"From the 1890s...the conviction that social reform was necessary was increasingly outflanked and overtaken by the belief that all social problems could find their rational solution through state intervention and scientific endeavor...The dream of a final solution to the social problem resonated in the plans of the 'social engineers', regardless of whatever they were active as youth welfare workers, social hygienists or city planners. Just as medicine had put paid to bacteria, so too, the union of science and social technology in public interventions would make all social problems disappear".{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=322}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Peukert wrote that by the beginning of the 20th century, the pattern of death had changed from being common amongst young people to being only common amongst the old, and this "banishment of death from everyday life" dramatically increased the prestige of science so that it was believed would soon solve all social problems.{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=282}}

At the same time, owing to the great prestige of science, a scientific racist, Social Darwinist and eugenicist worldview which declared some people to be more biologically “valuable” than others was common amongst German elites.{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=279-280}} Peukert argued that because the modern welfare state began in Germany in the 1870s, that this had encouraged an "utopian" view of social policy within Germany.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=321}} Peukert wrote that the great success by medical practitioners in reducing morality in the 19th century had encouraged hopes that practitioners of the new emerging social sciences like sociology, criminology and psychology would soon solve all problems and personal unhappiness would be banished forever.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=321-322}} At the same time, Peukert argued that the "spirit of science" had aided the rise of racism.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=322}} Peukert argued that scientific advances had reduced morality, but could not end death, and unlike religion, science could offer no spiritual consolation.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=322}} Peukert wrote that for precisely these reasons, scientific racism was embraced since though the body of the individual would inevitably end, the ''volkskörper'' (the "eternal" body of the race) would live on.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=323}} Peukert wrote that "actual target of scientific effort" switched from "the individual, whose cause in the long run was always hopeless, to the "body" of the nation, the ''volkskörper''".{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=282}} In this sense, ensuring the survival of the "healthy genes" was a bid for a type of immortality.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=323}} Conversely, this required the elimination of "deficient genes" carried by the "unfit".{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=323}}

Peukert wrote that as death is inevitable, scientists and those influenced by the scientists came to become obsessed with improving the health of the ''volk'' via "racial hygiene" as a bid for a sort of immorality.{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=284}} Peukert stated "the conquest of the world by a secularized, scientific rationality was so overwhelming, that the switch from religion to science as the main source of a meaning-creating mythology for everyday life took place almost without resistance. The result, however, was that science took upon itself a burden of responsibility that it would soon find a heavy one".{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=284}} Peukert wrote science could not offer spiritual consolation as in a world dominated by science the question of "how can the rationalist, secular ideal of the greatest happiness of the greatest number be vindicated, given that it is rebutted in the case of each individual by illness, suffering and death?", which was impossible to answer.{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=284}} As such, scientists came to be concerned with the body of the individual as a way of determining if that individual should be allowed to pass on his/her genes to the next generation with the criterion being whatever the individual was of "value" or not.{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=285}} In this way, there was a shift from the individual as the center of medical concern to the collective of the ''volkskörper'' (the "body" of the entire race).{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=285}}

Peukert argued that the very growth of the welfare state under the [[Weimar Republic]] ensured the backlash when social problems were not solved was especially severe.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=322}} Peukert wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Weimar installed the new principle of the social state, in which, on the one hand, the citizen could now claim public assistance in (his/her) social and personal life, while on the other, the state set up the institutional and normative framework, (defining how) a 'normal' life of the citizen of the state could progress...This process, which had already began before the turn of the century, reached its apex in the Weimar Republic and was also thrown into crisis, as the limits of social technology could achieve were reached in every direction".{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=322}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Peukert wrote that after the [[First World War]], the pre-war mood of optimism gave way to disillusionment as German bureaucrats found social problems to be more insolvable than at first thought, which in turn, guided by the prevailing Social Darwinist and eugenicist values led them to place increasing emphasis on saving the biologically “fit” while the biologically “unfit” were to be written off.{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=288}} Peukert used as an example that fact that social workers had before the First World War had believed it was possible to ensure that every child in Germany was brought up in a happy home and by 1922 were instead declaring that certain young people were "biologically" prone to being "unfit", requiring a law on detention that was to remove them from society forever.{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=288}} Peukert maintained that after 1929, when the [[Great Depression]] began, the economic limits of the welfare state to end poverty were cruelly exposed, which led German social scientists and doctors to argue that the "solution" was now to protect the "valuable" in society from the "incurable".{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=322}} Peukert wrote that rather than accept that the "spirit of science" could not solve all social problems, those who believed in the "spirit of science" started to blame the victims of poverty themselves for their plight, depicting their poverty as due to biological instead of economic factors, and began to devise measures to exclude the biologically "incurable" from society.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=322}} Peukert described the appeal of National Socialism to scientists and social engineers as offering a simplistic "racial" explanations for social failures in modern Germany, which allowed those making social policy to disregard economic and psychological factors as a reason for why some families were "losers".{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=323}}

Peukert wrote that when faced with the same financial contains that their predecessors in the Imperial and Weimar periods had faced, social workers, teachers, professors and doctors in the Third Reich began to advocate plans to ensure that the genes of the "racially unfit" would not be passed on to the next generation, first via sterilization and then by killing them.{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=289-290}} Furthermore, Peukert argued that ''völkisch'' racism was part of a male backlash against women's emancipation, and was a way of asserting control over women's bodies, which were viewed in a certain sense as public property since women had the duty of bearing the next generation that would pass on the "healthy genes".{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=323}} Peukert maintained that as the bearers of the next generation of Germans that Nazi social policies fell especially heavily upon German women.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=323}} Peukert that for ''volksgenossenlinnen'' (female "national comrades"), any hint of non-conformity and the "pleasures of refusal" in not playing their designated role within the  ''volksgemeinschaft'' as the bearers of the next generation of soldiers could expect harsh punishments such as sterilization, incarceration in a concentration camp or for extreme case ''vernichtung'' ("extermination").{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=323}} Peukert wrote that "after 1933 any critical public discussion and any critique of racism in the human sciences from amongst the ranks of the experts was eliminated: from then on, the protective...instances of the ''Rechstaat'' (legal state) no longer stood between the racist perpetrators and their victims; from then on, the dictatorial state put itself solely on the side of racism".{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=323-324}} Peukert argued that all of the National Socialist social policies such as natalist policies that relentlessly pressured Aryan women to have more and children were all part of the same effort to strengthen the ''volksgemeinschaft''.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=323}} Peukert argued that despite a turn towards Social Darwinism when confronted with the failure of the welfare state to solve all social problems in the 1920s, that it was the democratic Weimar constitution that had provided a thin legal wedge that prevented the full implications of this from being worked out.{{sfn|Crew|1992|p=323-324}}

Peukert argued that in 1939 that the entire system that had been built up for scientifically identifying those of racial "non-value" served as the apparatus for genocide.{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=290}} Peukert wrote that the all of the criterion for identifying Jews and Romany as peoples of racial "non-value" was based on the pseudo-scientific theories that had been promoted by generations of "race scientists" and that those serving in the "human sciences and social professions" worked to provide the theories for an "all-embracing racist restructuring of social policy, educational policy and health and welfare policy".{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=290}} The culmination of these efforts was the proposed 1944 "Law for the Treatment of Community Aliens" which called for sending to the concentration camps anyone who failed to live be up to be a proper '''volksgenossen'' as a ''gemeinschaftsfremde'' (community alien).{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=290-291}} Only the fact that Germany was fully engaged in World War II prevented Hitler from signing "Law for the Treatment of Community Aliens", which was put off until the ''Reich'' won the "final victory".{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=291}} Peukert wrote: "Nazi racism, the professed goal which had been to secure the immorality of the racially pure ''volkskörper'' in practice inevitably became converted into a crusade against life".{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=291}}

Peukert wrote that the Holocaust would never had happened without the shift from the thinking of scientists from concern with the body of the individual to concern with the body of the collective ''volkskörper'', the tendency to break society into those of "value" and those of "lesser value" and with seeing the solution to social problems as eliminating the genes of those of "lesser value".{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=291}} Peukert wrote that the fascination with pseudo-scientific racial theories and eugenics were common to all of the West, but it was the specific conditions in Germany which allowed the National Socialists to come to power 1933 that led to the "Final Solution to the Jewish Question".{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=292}} Peukert wrote: "The 'death of God' in the nineteenth century gave science dominion over life. For each individual human being, however, the borderline experience of death rebuts this claim to dominion. Science therefore sought its salvation in the specious immorality of the racial  ''volkskörper'', for the sake of which real-and hence more imperfect-life could be sacrificed. Thus the instigators of the "Final Solution" finally achieved dominion over death".{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=293}} Through Peukert was on the left, the conservative American intellectual M.D. Aeschliman praised Peukert's essay in ''The National Review'' as "important" and "haunting".{{sfn|Aeschliman|2005|p=50}}

Peukert wrote that after the war that scientists who had provided the intellectual justification for the "Final Solution" were not prosecuted and a massive effort to block the memory of their actions started which largely prevented any discussion of the subject in the 1950s-1960s.{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=294}} Peukert ended his essay that that there were debates about "our dealings with others, notably those different from ourselves. Recent debates about foreign migrants and AIDs present a conflicting picture. On one hand, we can see the continuing survival of a discourse on segregation, untouched by any historical self-consciousness. On the other hand, however, there is a considerable body of opinion pledging for tolerance and responsibility that spring from an awareness of German history and of the genesis of the "Final Solution" from the spirit of science".{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=294-295}}

==Death and legacy==
Peukert died of AIDS in 1990, aged 39. The British historian [[Richard Bessel]] described Peukert's last months as a "nightmare of suffering".{{sfn|Bessel|1990|p=324}} At the time, there were no drugs to treat HIV, and Peukert died in much agony, but was described by as having kept his spirits up the end.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1991|p=245}}

In a 2017 review of the 2015 book ''Detlev Peukert und die NS-Forschung'' (''Detlev Peukert and the National Socialist Research'') the American historian Helmut Walser Smith called Peukert one of "the most prolific German historians of the post-war era" who wrote important books in social history, "extremely influential articles, like ‘The Final Solution from the Spirit of Science’, still often cited" and "stunning, provocative works of synthesis" such as his book on the Weimar Republic.{{sfn|Smith|2017|p=485}} Smith wrote that in general most historians have issues with his thesis about the Weimar Republic as a paradigm of "classical modernity", writing that the concept of "classical modernity" was too vague and that Peukert's point that modernity does not automatically equal freedom now seems self-evident.{{sfn|Smith|2017|p=485}}

The editors of ''Detlev Peukert und die NS-Forschung'', Rüdiger Hachtmann and Sven Reichardt, argued that Peukert was one of the most important historians on the Nazi era as he shifted research from the subject of ''Verführung und Gewalt'' (Seduction and Violence) to ''Volksgenossen und Gemeinschaftsfremde'' (National Comrades and Community Aliens) focusing on "the role of ordinary people, as insiders (believers, conformers, bystanders) in their relation to perceived outsiders."{{sfn|Smith|2017|p=485}} One of the contributors to  ''Detlev Peukert und die NS-Forschung'', Nikolaus Wachsmann, argued that Peukert's focus on looking at all groups victimized by the Nazi regime as ''Gemeinschaftsfremde'' (Community Aliens) such as the Romany, homosexuals, and the disabled missed the centrality of ''völkisch'' anti-Semitic ideology to the "Final Solution of the Jewish Question".{{sfn|Smith|2017|p=486}} Wachsmann further noted that a central problem with Peukert's work was it was entirely concerned with Germany and he missed that the majority of the people killed by the Nazi regime were in Eastern Europe.

Waschsman criticized Peukert for failing to go beyond his own point that the violence of the Nazi regime tended to be directed against people considered to be "outsiders" in Germany which meant the vast majority of the victims of Nazi violence were people in Eastern Europe, observing that Peukert had little to say about the extermination of Eastern European Jews, the sheer brutality of German policies in Poland or the mass murder of three million Red Army POWs in 1941-42 as all this happened outside of Germany. Smith in his review largely agreed with Waschman's point about that Peukert's focus on developments entirely within Germany was limited one.{{sfn|Smith|2017|p=486}} However, Smith argued that Peukert's "subtle understanding of consent, accommodation and non-conformity" by ordinary people in Nazi Germany still made him relevant today as Peukert helped show how the absence of "public protest and genuine outrage at the treatment of others" made genocide possible.{{sfn|Smith|2017|p=486}}

In 2016, the American journalist [[Rod Dreher]] wrote that much about what Peukert described as "crisis of classical modernity" in the Weimar Republic was applicable to the modern United States, citing Peukert's remarks about the cultural struggle between the ''avant-garde'' Weimar culture vs. the traditional militarist culture, the "crisis of youth" and debates about masculinity in Weimar Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Einhard''' (also '''Eginhard''' or '''Einhart'''; {{lang-la|E(g)inhardus}}; {{circa}} 775 – March 14, 840 AD) was a [[Franks|Frankish]] scholar and courtier. Einhard was a dedicated servant of [[Charlemagne]] and his son [[Louis the Pious]]; his main work is a biography of Charlemagne, the ''[[Vita Karoli Magni]]'', "one of the most precious literary bequests of the early Middle Ages."&lt;ref&gt;Hodgkin 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public life==
Einhard was from the eastern [[German language|German-speaking]] part of the [[Francia|Frankish Kingdom]]. Born into a family of landowners of some importance, his parents sent him to be educated by the monks of [[Fulda]] - one of the most impressive centers of learning in the Frank lands. Perhaps due to his small stature, which restricted his riding and sword-fighting ability, Einhard concentrated his energies on scholarship, especially the mastering of [[Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith 62&lt;/ref&gt; He was accepted into the hugely wealthy court of Charlemagne around 791 or 792. Charlemagne actively sought to amass [[scholar]]ly men around him and established a royal school led by the [[Northumbria]]n scholar [[Alcuin]]. Einhard evidently was a talented builder and [[construction]] manager, because Charlemagne put him in charge of the completion of several [[palace]] complexes including [[Charlemagne's Palace in Aachen|Aachen]] and [[Imperial Palace Ingelheim|Ingelheim]]. Despite the fact that Einhard was on intimate terms with Charlemagne, he never achieved office in his [[reign]]. In 814, on Charlemagne's death, his son [[Louis the Pious]] made Einhard his private [[secretary]]. Einhard retired from [[Noble court|court]] during the time of the disputes between Louis and his sons in the spring of 830.

He died at [[Seligenstadt]] in 840.

==Private life==
Einhard was married to Emma, of whom little is known. There is a possibility that their marriage bore a son, Vussin. Their marriage also appears to have been exceptionally liberal for the period, with Emma being as active as Einhard, if not more so, in the handling of their property.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 58.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that in the later years of their marriage Emma and Einhard abstained from sexual relations, choosing instead to focus their attentions on their many religious commitments. Though he was undoubtedly devoted to her, Einhard wrote nothing of his wife until after her death on 13 December 835, when he wrote to a friend that he was reminded of her loss in ‘every day, in every action, in every undertaking, in all the administration of the house and household, in everything needing to be decided upon and sorted out in my religious and earthly responsibilities’.&lt;ref&gt;From Einhard’s letter of April 836 to Lupus of Ferrieres. Qtd. in Smith 55.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Denkmal Einhard Eschweiler.jpg|thumb|Einhard memorial in the German city of [[Eschweiler]]]]

==Religious beliefs==
Einhard made numerous references to himself as a "sinner" according to his strong Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt; He erected churches at both of his estates in Michelstadt and Mulinheim. In Michelstadt, he also saw fit to build a basilica completed in 827 and then sent a servant, Ratleic, to Rome with an end to find relics for the new building. Once in Rome, Ratleic robbed a catacomb of the bones of the Martyrs [[Marcellinus and Peter]] and had them translated to Michelstadt. Once there, the relics made it known they were unhappy with their new tomb and thus had to be moved again to Mulinheim. Once established there, they proved to be miracle workers. Although unsure as to why these saints should choose such a "sinner" as their patron, Einhard nonetheless set about ensuring they continued to receive a resting place fitting of their honour.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 831 and 834 he founded a Benedictine Monastery and, after the death of his wife, served as its Abbot until his own death in 840.

==Local lore==
Local lore from Seligenstadt portrays Einhard as the lover of Emma, one of [[Charlemagne]]'s daughters, and has the couple elope from court. Charlemagne found them at Seligenstadt (then called Obermühlheim) and forgave them. This account is used to explain the name "Seligenstadt" by [[folk etymology]].&lt;ref&gt;"Der hessische Spessart" par. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Einhard and his wife were originally buried in one sarcophagus in the choir of the church in Seligenstadt, but in 1810 the sarcophagus was presented by the Grand Duke of Hesse to the count of Erbach, who claims descent from Einhard as the husband of Imma, the reputed daughter of Charlemagne. The count put it in the famous chapel of his castle at Erbach in the Odenwald.&lt;ref&gt;Schaff par. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
The most famous of Einhard's works is his [[biography]] of Charlemagne, the ''[[Vita Karoli Magni]]'', "The Life of Charlemagne" (c. 817–836), which provides much direct information about Charlemagne's life and character, written sometime between 817 and 830. In composing this he relied heavily upon the [[Royal Frankish Annals]]. Einhard's literary model was the classical work of the Roman historian [[Suetonius]], the ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Lives of the Caesars]]'', though it is important to stress that the work is very much Einhard's own, that is to say he adapts the models and sources for his own purposes. His work was written as a praise of Charlemagne, whom he regarded as a foster-father (''nutritor'') and to whom he was a debtor "in life and death". The work thus contains an understandable degree of bias, Einhard taking care to exculpate Charlemagne in some matters, not mention others, and to gloss over certain issues which would be of embarrassment to Charlemagne, such as the morality of his daughters; by contrast, other issues are curiously not glossed over, like his concubines.

Einhard is also responsible for three other extant works: a collection of letters, ''On the Translations and the Miracles of SS. Marcellinus and Petrus'', and ''On the Adoration of the Cross''.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Müller 252.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter dates from ca. 830 and was not rediscovered until 1885,&lt;ref&gt;"Einhard ca. 770-840" par. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Ernst Dümmler]] identified a text in a manuscript in [[Vienna]] as the missing ''Libellus de adoranda cruce'',&lt;ref&gt;Dümmler.&lt;/ref&gt; which Einhard had dedicated to his pupil [[Lupus Servatus]].&lt;ref&gt;Levison 271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stofferahn par. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the common law form of action|a fuller discussion of modern proceedings|Eviction}}

'''Ejectment''' is a [[common law]] term for civil action to recover the possession of or title to land.  It replaced the old real actions and the various possessory assizes (denoting county-based pleas to local sittings of the courts) where boundary disputes often featured.  Though still used in some places, the term is now obsolete in many common law jurisdictions, in which possession and title are sued by the actions of [[eviction]] (also called possession proceedings) and [[quiet title]] (or injunctive and/or declaratory relief), respectively.   

Originally, successful ejectment meant recovery of possession of land, for example against a defaulting tenant or a [[trespasser]], who did not have (or no longer had) any right to remain there.  It has continued to be used for this, though in some jurisdictions the terminology has changed.

The old real actions, which were concerned with the title to land, were found to be too technical and difficult to use. A practice developed of trying the title to ownership of land by means of a special ejectment chiefly for ensuring a low court and had the added advantage of some confidentiality among the landed gentry. The claimant granted (or so professed) a lease to a friend which had passed to a [[legal fiction|fictitious]] person (such as [[John Doe]]), who became the nominal plaintiff: the real claimant (plaintiff) was thereby the "lessor of the plaintiff".  The action was vicarious.  The action was brought against the real defendant or, more usually, for semi-secrecy and to ensure the low court, against another fictitious person (e.g. [[John Doe|William Styles]]), in many papers termed the "casual ejector",&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
  |url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Casual+ejector
  |title=Casual ejector
  |work=Legal Dictionary
  |publisher=TheFreeDictionary.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; who both sides' papers would state evicted the first fictitious tenant(s) by virtue of an (equally fictitious) lease granted by the real defendant. The title of the action would then be "Doe dem. [name of real claimant] v. [Defendant] or [fictitous counter-tenant]".  E.g. ''Doe dem. John Hurrell Luscombe {{abbreviation|v|versus}} Yates, Hawker, and Mudge (1822) 5 B. &amp; Ald. 544'' (England; 1822),&lt;ref name="england"&gt;[https://deedpolloffice.com/change-name/law/case-law/Doe-dem-Luscombe-v-Yates-1822 ''Doe dem. John Hurrell Luscombe v Yates, Hawker, and Mudge (1822) 5 B. &amp; Ald. 544'']&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter was sent in the name of the casual ejector to the real defendant, inviting him to defend the case on behalf of his supposed tenant. The defendant's right to appear depended on the existence of the fictitious lease (an existence he would willingly assert). This enabled the rights of the real parties to be litigated in a low court. Such fictitious actions have been abolished in many jurisdictions as a result of the provision of alternative remedies.

("Essay on the customs and spirit of nations and key facts of history from Charlemagne to Louis XIII.")&lt;/ref&gt; is a work by the French writer, historian, and philosopher [[Voltaire]], published for the first time in 1756.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bGFECQAAQBAJ|title=The Crisis from Within: Historians, Theory, and the Humanities|last=Raab|first=Nigel|date=2015|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004292727|pages=26–28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It discusses the [[history of Europe]] before [[Charlemagne]] until the dawn of the age of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], also addressing the colonies and the East.

The 174-chapter work resulted from fifteen years of research by Voltaire at [[Cirey-sur-Blaise]], [[Brussels]], [[Paris]], [[Lunéville]], [[Prussia]], [[Alsace]] and [[Geneva]].

Voltaire revised the text until his death in 1778, expanding an Appendix with defences of the work and responses to criticism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Enlightenment Historiography|last=Pierse|first=Siofra|publisher=BRILL|year=2013|isbn=9789004251847|editor-last=Bourgault|editor-first=Sophie|location=|pages=162–163|chapter=Voltaire: Polemical Possibilities of History|editor-last2=Sparling|editor-first2=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
The ''Essai'' is a work of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophy as much as of history. It urges the active rejection of [[superstition]] and fable and their replacement by knowledge based on reason.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Voltaire traced common themes across various human cultures and languages, explained by a shared reality but also shared human failings, such as superstitions and dreams, that kept humans from appreciating this reality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Voltaire was reacting against [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet]]'s ''[[Speech of Universal History]]'', which had presented [[Judeo-Christian]] nations as the most advanced. In contrast, the ''Essai'' praised ancient [[China]] and [[India]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Voltaire also attempted to refute prejudices about the [[Muslim world]], according to which the [[Ottoman Empire]] and all other Muslim states were [[despotism]]s in which individuals had no rights and no property of their own. He countered that these states differed among each other just as Christian states did, none of them treating subjects as slaves. He also pointed out that European [[feudalism]] gave individuals no more rights than a typical person in [[Turkey]] or [[Prussia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PZ2aAAAAIAAJ|title=The Anthropology of the Enlightenment|last=Pagden|first=Anthony|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780804779432|editor-last=Wolff|editor-first=Larry|pages=55|language=en|chapter=The Immobility of China: Orientalism and Occidentalism in the Enlightenment|editor-last2=Cipollnin|editor-first2=Marco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While arguing that Christianity was not essential for a civilised and highly moral society, Voltaire countered writers, including [[Pierre Bayle]], who had used China as an example of a morally advanced culture based on [[atheism]]. Pointing to Chinese classic literature, including [[Confucius]], Voltaire wrote that all societies, China included, had recognised a supreme being and used ideas of this being as a basis for morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GvETDAAAQBAJ|title=Enlightenment Contested: Philosophy, Modernity, and the Emancipation of Man 1670–1752|last=Israel|first=Jonathan I.|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199279227|pages=657–658|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voltaire credited his intellectual partner [[Émilie du Châtelet]] as an influence: the Marquise had criticised works of history that were dull lists of facts. The ''Essai'' was written to show that history could be readable and engaging so as to "enlighten the soul" rather than weigh it down.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Reception ==
The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] preacher [[Claude-Adrien Nonnotte]] spent much of his life opposing the view on Christianity that Voltaire had taken in the ''Essai''. At first, he anonymously published ''Examen critique ou Réfutation du livre des moeurs'' ("Critical examination or refutation of the book of customs"). Over the next twenty years, he wrote a succession of revised editions of this work, which was translated into Italian, German, Polish, and Portuguese. Voltaire, in turn, responded with criticisms of Nonnotte in revised editions of the ''Essai'' and in his ''Eclaircissements historiques'' ("Historical clarifications").&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Claude-Adrien Nonnotte}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The critic Paul Sakmann praised the ''Essai'' as "large-scale, critically-sifted, and treated in a philosophical spirit".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Siófra Pierse in 2013 wrote that it is "a magisterial work of compression, summary, synthesis and selectivity."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Saul Anton in 2012 described it as "a masterpiece of prose that pioneered many of the foundations of modern historical study and a style of historical discourse that placed the reader’s experience at the center."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anton|first1=Saul|title=[Review]|journal=H-France review|date=April 2012|volume=12|issue=54|pages=1–5|url=http://www.h-france.net/vol12reviews/vol12no54anton.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2016|publisher=Society for French Historical Studies|issn=1553-9172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4247">The '''Hartlake disaster''' was an accident in [[Kent]], England, that resulted in the death of 30 [[Hops|hop-pickers]] on 20 October 1853.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tragedy at Hartlake Bridge - 20 October 1853|url=http://www.kentishpeople.co.uk/article.php?id=2|work=Kentish People|accessdate=11 February 2013|date=18 Feb 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident==
The Hartlake bridge is a bridge over the [[River Medway]] in [[Golden Green]] of the parish of [[Hadlow]], Kent. On the evening of 20 October 1853, a wagon was taking around 40 hop-pickers and their families back to their camp site. One of the horses pulling the wagon shied on the bridge, causing one of its wheels to crash through the side of the bridge. This upended the cart, tipping its passengers into the river, which at the time was swollen in flood.&lt;ref name="onefifty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/3204756.stm |title=Tribute to drowned hop pickers |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-10-19 |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victims were casual workers and either Irish or [[Romani people]]. The Romanis were all from one extended family. The victims were aged between 59 years and 2 years old.&lt;ref name=thd&gt;{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=Ann|title=The Hartlake Disaster|url=http://www.romanyroad.co.uk/#/hartlake-disaster/4524088998|work=Romany Road}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inquest==
The inquest into the deaths was held at the Bell Inn&lt;ref&gt;{{coord|51.2103|0.3429|format=dms|type:landmark|display=inline}}&lt;/ref&gt; by D N Dudlow Esq&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hartlake memorial: news coverage of the tragedy|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/kent/voices/hartlake/news_report.shtml|work=Romany Roots|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and returned a verdict of accidental death.  The coroner found that "the accident arose entirely from the defective state of the road and the wooden bridge, and their dangerous construction, which ought to have been before remedied".&lt;ref name=tc&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeffery|first=Shaun|title=Hartlake Bridge|url=http://tonbridgecollectables.com/page23.php|work=Tonbridge Collectables|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maintenance of the bridge had been the responsibility of the Medway Navigation Company.

==Memorial==

The deceased were buried in the nearby [[St. Mary's Church, Hadlow|St Mary's Church]], where a monument in the form of an [[oast house]] has been erected.&lt;ref name=Memorial&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stmaryshadlow.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=49:hop-pickers-memorial&amp;catid=51:history&amp;Itemid=66 |title=Hop Pickers Memorial |publisher=St Mary's, Hadlow |accessdate=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monument is [[Listed building|Grade II listed]].&lt;ref name=Listed2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/default.aspx?pid=2&amp;id=179460 |title=Hoppers Memorial approximately 20 metres East South East of the chancel of Church of St Mary, Church Street, Hadlow, Tonbridge and Malling, Kent |publisher=English Heritage |accessdate=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full cost of the burial was borne by the parish of Hadlow, the Medway Navigation Company refusing to contribute. In October 2013, on the 160th anniversary of the disaster, a new plaque carrying the names of the dead was added to the by now weathered memorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-24587705 |title=Hartlake Disaster: New memorial to killed hop pickers |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=2003-10-19 |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the youngest victim, a two-year-old girl, remains unknown as her parents died with her in the accident.&lt;ref name="onefifty" /&gt;

The '''Hazaraspids ('''{{lang-fa|هزاراسپیان}}) (1155–1424), was a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[Sunni Muslim]] dynasty&lt;ref&gt;C. E. Bosworth, ''The New Islamic Dynasties: A Chronological and Genealogical Manual'', (Columbia University Press, 1996), 205, {{ISBN|0-231-10714-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=|first1=|title=HAZĀRASPIDS|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hazaraspids|website=www.iranicaonline.org|publisher=Encyclopædia Iranica|accessdate=20 February 2017|language=en|quote=HAZĀRASPIDS, a local dynasty of Kurdish origin which ruled in the Zagros mountains region of southwestern Persia,...}}&lt;/ref&gt; that ruled the [[Zagros Mountains]] region of southwestern [[Iran]], essentially in [[Lorestān Province|Lorestan]] and the adjacent parts of [[Fars province|Fars]] which flourished in the later [[Seljuk dynasty|Saljuq]], [[Ilkhanid]], [[Muzaffarids (Iran)|Muzaffarid]], and [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;C. E. Bosworth,[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hazaraspids], Encyclopædia Iranica&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
Although the founder was [[Abu Tahir ibn Muhammad]], the dynasty is named after the latter's son and successor, [[Malik Hazarasp]]. The name of the dynasty is of [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] origin, and means "thousand horses".{{sfn|Luzac|Co|1986|p=336-337}}

== History ==
The founder of dynasty was Abu Tahir ibn Muhammad, a descendant of the [[Shabankara]] chieftain [[Fadluya]], who was initially a commander of the [[Salghurids]] of Fars and was appointed as the governor of [[Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province|Kuhgiluya]],&lt;ref&gt;B. Spuller,[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v2f8/v2f8a075.html Atabakan-e Lorestan]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Encyclopædia Iranica.&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually gained independence in [[Luristan]] and extended his realm as far as [[Isfahan]] and assumed the prestigious title of ''[[atabeg]].''&lt;ref&gt;C. E. Bosworth, ''The New Islamic Dynasties: A Chronological and Genealogical Manual'', 205.&lt;/ref&gt; His son, Malik Hazarasp fought a successful campaign against Salghurids and assisted [[Mingburnu|Jalal-al-din Khwarezmshah]] in his struggle against the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]]. Another Hazaraspid ruler Takla, accompanied [[Hulagu]] on his march to [[Baghdad]], but deserted because of the murder of the last [[Abbasid Caliphate|caliph]]. He was eventually caught and executed on Hulagu's order.

Yusuf Shah I received [[Abaqa|Ilkhan Abaqa]]'s confirmation of his rule and added [[Khuzestan province|Khuzestan]], Kuhgiluya, Firuzan (near Isfahan) and [[Golpayegan]] to his domain. Afrasiab I attempted to extend his control to the coast of [[Persian Gulf]] but faced stiff opposition from the Mongols who defeated his army at Kuhrud near [[Kashan]]. He was reinstated by [[Gaykhatu|Ilkhan Gaykhatu]] but was executed by [[Mahmud Ghazan|Gazan]] in October 1296.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v2f8/v2f8a075.html ATĀBAKĀN‵E LORESTĀN, rulers of Lorestān, part of the Zagros highlands of southwestern Iran in the later middle ages&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The capital of Hazaraspids was located at [[Izeh|Idaj]] located in present-day northern [[Khuzestan]]. Yusuf Shah II annexed the cities of [[Shushtar]], [[Hoveizeh]] and [[Basra]] in the first half of fourteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;S. Lane-Poole, ''The Mohammedan Dynasties: Chronological and Genealogical Tables with Historical Introductions'', 412 pp., Kessinger Publishing, 2004 (originally 1894), {{ISBN|1-4179-4570-2}}, p.174&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of Shams-al-din Pashang, the dynasty faced attacks from the [[Muzaffarids (Iran)|Muzaffarids]] and the capital Idaj temporarily fell into their hands, until the occupiers had to retreat due to their own internecine fighting.

In 1424, the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] ruler [[Shahrukh Mirza]] overthrew the last Hazaraspid ruler Ghiyath al-Din thereby ended the dynasty.

'''Henrik Gabriel Porthan''' (1739 in [[Viitasaari]] – 1804 in [[Turku]]) was a scholar sometimes known as ''The Father of Finnish History''. He was a student of [[Daniel Juslenius]] and a [[Fennophile]]. He brought Finnish history-writing, study of [[mythology]] and [[folk poetry]], and other [[human science|humanistic sciences]] to an international level. His ''De Poësi Fennica'' (published in five parts 1776-78), a study on Finnish folk poetry, had great importance in awakening public interest in the [[Kalevala]]-poetry and [[Finnish mythology]], and the study was also the basis of all later study of the poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Juha Y. Pentikäinen, ''Kalevala Mythology: Expanded Edition'', ed. and trans. by Ritva Poom (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1999), p. 3; Henricus Gabriel Porthan, ''Dissertationis de poësi Fennica'', issued in 5 parts (Åbo: Frenckell, 1766-78), pp. 87-88; fascicule 1: http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi-fd2014-00004879; fascicule 2: http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi-fd2014-00004872; fascicule 4: http://www.doria.fi/handle/10024/109616; fascicule 5: http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi-fd2014-00004890; Henrik Gabriel Porthan, ''Suomalaisesta runoudesta'', ed. and trans. by Iiro Kajanto ([Helsinki]: SKS [= Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura], 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; He was among the founders of the [[Aurora Society]] that advocated Finnish literary pursuits and was the editor of the first Finnish newspaper, ''Tidningar ugifne af et sällskap i Åbo'', founded in 1771. He supervised [[Christian Erici Lencqvist]], whose 1782 dissertation ''De superstitione veterum Fennorum theoretica et practica'' was a seminal study of Finnish charms.&lt;ref&gt;Juha Y. Pentikäinen, ''Kalevala Mythology: Expanded Edition'', ed. and trans. by Ritva Poom (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1999), p. 4; Christianus Erici Lencqvist, ''Specimen academicum de superstitione veterum fennorum theoretica et practica'', 2 vols (Åbo: Frenchell, 1782), http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi-fd2014-00004930, http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi-fd2014-00004909.&lt;/ref&gt;

Porthan was the teacher of [[Frans Mikael Franzén]] and also inspired the following generation of Finnish authors, poets and researchers, many of whom were among the founders of the [[Finnish Literature Society]] in 1831.

The [[Porthania]] building of the University of Helsinki is named after Porthan.

==Editions==
The main edition of Porthan's works remains ''Opera selecta. Skrifter i urval'', ed. by Sven Gabriel Elmgren and Josef August Schauman, 5 vols (Helsingfors: Finska Litteratur-Sällskapets tryckeri, 1859–73). However, scans of the original publications are now available via http://www.doria.fi.

'''Henry Quastler''' (November 11, 1908 – July 4, 1963) was an Austrian physician and radiologist who became a pioneer in the field of [[information theory]] applied to biology after emigrating to America.  His work with [[Sidney Dancoff]] led to the publication of what is now commonly called Dancoff's Law. He also developed early versions of the theory of [[emergence]] in biology.

==Life==
Quastler spent his early career in Vienna as a doctor. He received his medical degree in Vienna in 1932, focusing on histology and radiology. He met his wife, [[Gertrude Quastler]], a milliner, when she came to him for treatment for tuberculosis. They married in 1933. The couple moved to Albania when King [[Zog I of Albania|Zog]] asked for Quastler to train up radiologists. While there he also worked on malaria. Quastler's malaria expertise earned him a place on the International Health Board. As [[World War II]] approached in 1939, the couple left Albania and traveled to America. Within a year Quastler was working as a radiologist at New Rochelle Hospital in New York. In 1942, the Quastlers relocated to Urbana, Illinois, where Henry was employed as chief radiologist at Carle Hospital Clinic.&lt;ref name = "lil"/&gt; While in Illinois, Gertrude Quastler studied art. She soon became a noted artist. Henry also painted as an amateur. According to his sister Johanna, the couple sometimes exhibited together.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pittsburgh Press'' - Aug 21, 1980, S-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 Quastler gave up his medical practice to concentrate on science. [[Heinz von Foerster]], who knew Quastler well, said that he became even more interested in radiation after the invention of the atomic bomb, which he considered "a horrifying human catastrophe". Foerster recalled Questler pondering: "[Quastler asked] 'Can I now, as a working person, find out what damage has been done by the radiation of atomic bombs?'—that was his research question. Thus he started to conduct experiments on radiation damage in living organisms."&lt;ref name = "for"&gt;Müller, Albert, (ed), Michael Kasenbacher (trans) ''The Beginning of Heaven and Earth Has No Name: Seven Days with Second-Order Cybernetics''. , Elinor Rooks, Fordham University Press, 2014, pp.108–9.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Foerster, Quastler came to information theory while trying to find a way to "qualitatively describe the damage caused by radiation. ... Henry Quastler learned the basic concepts and formalisms of information theory with a speed that was almost unbelievable. And why? Because he needed this instrument urgently.".&lt;ref name = "for"/&gt;  
 
In the 1940s Quastler met Dancoff and collaborated with him to develop information theory in biology. They were interested in the problem of how to define the information content of a gene. After Dancoff's death, Quastler organized the symposium Information Theory in Biology, founded by him in 1952. Quastler soon became interested in how information theory could be used to understand the origin of life. In 1953 he edited ''Essays on the Use of Information Theory in Biology''.&lt;ref name ="eve"&gt;Harold J. Morowitz, ''The Emergence of Everything: How the World Became Complex'', Oxford University Press, 2004, pp.12; 84&lt;/ref&gt; He edited another collection of essays, ''Information Theory in Psychology: Problems and Methods'', in 1956.

Despite his best efforts, his wife's tuberculosis slowly worsened. A deterioration in his wife's health led Quastler to take a job at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] in New York, where he continued to work on both radiation and information biology.&lt;ref name = "dan"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "lil"/&gt; When his wife died in 1963, Quastler was devastated. He took an overdose of pills, laid down beside her and held her hand until he died. [[Richard Diebenkorn]] later said, "Neither my wife nor I can think of a couple we encountered more indivisible."&lt;ref name = "dan"&gt;Daniel Baumann, "Gertrude Quastler", ''2013 Carnegie International'', Carnagie Museum of Art, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Heinz von Foerster said of Quastler that he was "an exceptionally conscientious, ethically and morally conscious human being."&lt;ref name = "for"/&gt;

==Work with Dancoff==
In Foerster's words Quastler and Dancoff attempted to answer the following problem:

{{quote|How many bits have to go in there? And what is the informational content of that which produces these bits? What—in the language of information theory—is the relationship between the quantity of diversity or complexity that this system can create and give rise to, and the quantity of diversity or complexity with which it itself has been built?&lt;ref name = "for"/&gt;  }}

According to Lily E. Kay, Quastler and Dancoff created "the first technical application of the Weiner-Shannon theory in genetics."&lt;ref name = "lil"/&gt; Quastler and Dancoff proposed that the replication errors inevitable in biological reproduction must be held in check by a statistical process that functioned as a "checking device" within the gene. Quastler compared this to the system of "checks and balances" in the American constitution.&lt;ref name = "lil"/&gt; The proposition known as "Dancoff's Law" emerged from this work. A non-mathematical statement of this law is, "the greatest growth occurs when the greatest number of mistakes are made consistent with survival".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = S. M. Dancoff and H. Quastler | year = 1953 | title = Essays on the Use of Information Theory in Biology | chapter = The Information Content and Error Rate of Living Things | editor = Henry Quastler (Ed.) | location = Urbana | publisher = University of Illinois Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Emergence of Biological Organization''==
In 1964 Quastler's book ''The Emergence of Biological Organization'' was published posthumously. In 2002, Harold J. Morowitz described it as a "remarkably prescient book" which is "surprisingly contemporary in outlook". In it Quastler pioneers a theory of emergence, developing model of "a series of emergences from probionts to prokaryotes".&lt;ref name ="eve"/&gt;

The work is based on lectures given by Quastler during the spring term of 1963, when he was Visiting Professor of Theoretical Biology at Yale University. In these lectures Quastler argued that the formation of single-stranded polynucleotides was well within the limits of probability of what could have occurred during the pre-biologic period of the Earth.  However, he noted that polymerization of a single-stranded polymer from mononucleotides is slow, and its hydrolysis is fast; therefore in a closed system consisting only of mononucleotides and their single-stranded polymers, only a small fraction of the available molecules will be polymerized.  However, a single-stranded polymer may form a double-stranded one by complementary polymerization, using a single-stranded polynucleotide as a template.  Such a process is relatively fast and the resulting double-stranded polynucleotide is much more stable than the single single-stranded one since each monomer is bound not only along the sugar phosphate backbone, but also through inter-strand bonding between the bases.

The capability for self-replication, a fundamental feature of life, emerged when double-stranded polynucleotides disassociated into single-stranded ones and each of these served  as a template for synthesis of a complementary strand, producing two double-stranded copies.  Such a system is mutable since random changes of individual bases may occur and be propagated.  Individual replicators with different nucleotide sequences may also compete with each other for nucleotide precursors.  Mutations that influence the folding state of polynucleotides may affect the ratio of association of strands to dissociation and thus the ability to replicate.  The folding state would also affect the stability of the molecule.  Thus Quastler speculated that a nucleic acid system is even capable, in a primitive way, of Darwinian evolution.  These ideas were then developed to speculate on the emergence of genetic information, protein synthesis and other general features of life.

Lily E. Kay says that Quastler's works "are an illuminating example of a well reasoned epistemic quest and a curious disciplinary failure". Quastler's aspiration to create an information based biology was innovative, but his work was "plagued by problems: outdated data, unwarranted assumptions, some dubious numerology, and, most importantly, an inability to generate an experimental agenda." However Quastler's "discursive framework" survived.&lt;ref name = "lil"&gt;Lily E. Kay ''Who Wrote the Book of Life?: A History of the Genetic Code'', Stanford University Press, 2000, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Forty-five years after Quastler's 1964 proposal, Lincoln and Joyce&lt;ref name="pmid19131595"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lincoln TA, Joyce GF |title=Self-sustained replication of an RNA enzyme |journal=Science |volume=323 |issue=5918 |pages=1229–32 |date=February 2009  |pmid=19131595 |pmc=2652413 |doi=10.1126/science.1167856 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19131595}}&lt;/ref&gt; described a cross-catalytic system that involves two RNA enzymes (ribosymes) that catalyze each other's synthesis from a total of four component substrates.  This synthesis occurred in the absence of protein and could provide the basis for an artificial genetic system.

'''''Historia regum Britanniae''''' (''The History of the Kings of Britain''), originally called '''''De gestis Britonum''''' (''On the Deeds of the Britons''), is a [[pseudohistory|pseudohistorical]] account of British history, written around 1136 by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]. It chronicles the lives of the [[List of legendary kings of Britain|kings of the Britons]] over the course of two thousand years, beginning with the [[Troy|Trojans]] founding the [[Britons (historical)|British]] nation and continuing until the [[Anglo-Saxons]] assumed control of much of Britain around the 7th century. It is one of the central pieces of the [[Matter of Britain]].

Although taken as historical well into the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;[[Polydore Vergil]]'s skeptical reading of Geoffrey of Monmouth provoked at first a reaction of denial in England, "yet the seeds of doubt once sown" eventually replaced Geoffrey's romances with a new Renaissance historical approach, according to Hans Baron, "Fifteenth-century civilization and the Renaissance", in ''The New Cambridge Modern history'', vol. 1 1957:56.&lt;/ref&gt; it is now considered to have no value as history. When events described, such as [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|invasions of Britain]], can be corroborated from contemporary histories, Geoffrey's account can be seen to be wildly inaccurate. It remains, however, a valuable piece of medieval literature, which contains the earliest known version of the story of [[Leir of Britain|King Lear]] and his three daughters, and helped popularise the legend of [[King Arthur]].

==Contents==
===Dedication===
Geoffrey starts the book with a statement of his purpose in writing the history: "I have not been able to discover anything at all on the kings who lived here before the Incarnation of Christ, or indeed about Arthur and all the others who followed on after the Incarnation. Yet the deeds of these men were such that they deserve to be praised for all time." He claims that he was given a source for this period by [[Walter of Oxford|Archdeacon Walter]] of Oxford, who presented him with a "certain very ancient book written in the British language" from which he has translated his history. He also cites [[Gildas]] and [[Bede]] as sources. Then follows a dedication to [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert, earl of Gloucester]] and [[Waleran de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Worcester|Waleran, count of Meulan]], whom he enjoins to use their knowledge and wisdom to improve his tale.&lt;ref name="Thorpe1966"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thorpe|first=Lewis G. M.|authorlink=Lewis Thorpe|title=The history of the Kings of Britain|year=1966|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=0-14-044170-0|pages=51–52|chapter=Dedication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book One===
The ''Historia'' itself begins with the [[Troy|Trojan]] [[Aeneas]], who according to Roman legend settled in Italy after the [[Trojan War]]. His great-grandson [[Brutus of Troy|Brutus]] is banished, and, after a period of wandering, is directed by the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] to settle on an island in the western ocean. Brutus lands at [[Totnes]] and names the island, then called [[Albion]], "Britain" after himself. Brutus defeats the giants who are the only inhabitants of the island, and establishes his capital, Troia Nova, on the banks of the Thames; after his time it is renamed [[London]].

===Book Two===
When Brutus dies, his three sons, Locrinus, Kamber and Albanactus, divide the county between themselves; the three kingdoms are named Loegria (England), Kambria (Wales) and Albany (Scotland). The story then progresses rapidly through the reigns of the descendants of Locrinus, including [[Bladud]], who uses magic and even tries to fly, but dies in the process.

Bladud's son [[Leir of Britain|Leir]] reigns for sixty years. He has no sons, so upon reaching old age he decides to divide his kingdom among his three daughters, Goneril, Regan and Cordelia. To decide who should get the largest share, he asks his daughters how much they love him. Goneril and Regan give extravagant answers, but Cordelia answers simply and sincerely; angered, he gives Cordelia no land. Goneril and Regan are to share half the island with their husbands, the Dukes of Albany and Cornwall. Cordelia marries Aganippus, King of the Franks, and departs for Gaul. Soon Goneril and Regan and their husbands rebel and take the whole kingdom. After Leir has had all his attendants taken from him, he begins to regret his actions towards Cordelia and travels to Gaul. Cordelia receives him compassionately and restores his royal robes and retinue. Aganippus raises a Gaulish army for Leir, who returns to Britain, defeats his sons-in-law and regains the kingdom. Leir rules for three years and then dies; Cordelia inherits the throne and rules for five years before Marganus and Cunedagius, her sisters' sons, rebel against her. They imprison Cordelia; grief-stricken, she kills herself. Marganus and Cunedagius divide the kingdom between themselves, but soon quarrel and go to war with each other. Cunedagius eventually kills Marganus in Wales and retains the whole kingdom, ruling for thirty-three years. He is succeeded by his son Rivallo.

A later descendant of Cunedagius, King Gorboduc, has two sons called Ferreux and Porrex. They quarrel and both are eventually killed, sparking a civil war. This leads to Britain being ruled by five kings, who keep attacking each other. [[Dunvallo Molmutius]], the son of Cloten, the King of Cornwall, becomes pre-eminent. He eventually defeats the other kings and establishes his rule over the whole island. He is said to have "established the so-called [[Molmutine Laws]] which are still famous today among the English".

===Book Three===
Dunvallo's sons, [[Belinus]] and [[Brennius]], fight a civil war before being reconciled by their mother, and proceed to sack [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. Victorious, Brennius remains in Italy, while Belinus returns to rule Britain.

Numerous brief accounts of successive kings follow. These include [[Lud son of Heli|Lud]], who renames [[Trinovantum]] "[[Caer|Kaer]]lud" after himself; this later becomes corrupted to Lon[[Dun|don]]. Lud is succeeded by his brother, [[Cassivellaunus|Cassibelanus]], as Lud's sons [[Mandubracius|Androgeus]] and [[Tasciovanus|Tenvantius]] are not yet of age. In recompense, Androgeus is made Duke of [[Kent]] and [[Trinovantum]] ([[London]]), and Tenvantius is made Duke of [[Cornwall]].

===Book Four===
After his conquest of Gaul, [[Julius Caesar]] looks over the sea and resolves to order Britain to swear obedience and pay tribute to Rome. His commands are answered by a letter of refusal from Cassivellaunus. Caesar sails a fleet to Britain, but he is overwhelmed by Cassivellaunus's army and forced to retreat to Gaul. Two years later he makes another attempt, but is again pushed back. Then Cassivellaunus quarrels with one of his dukes, Androgeus, who sends a letter to Caesar asking him to help avenge the duke's honour. Caesar invades once more and besieges Cassivellaunus on a hill. After several days Cassivellaunus offers to make peace with Caesar, and Androgeus, filled with remorse, goes to Caesar to plead with him for mercy. Cassivellaunus pays tribute and makes peace with Caesar, who then returns to Gaul.

Cassivelaunus dies and is succeeded by his nephew Tenvantius, as Androgeus has gone to Rome. Tenvantius is succeeded in turn by his son [[Cunobelinus|Kymbelinus]], and then Kymbelinus's son [[Guiderius]]. Guiderius refuses to pay tribute to emperor [[Claudius]], who then invades Britain. After [[Guiderius]] is killed in battle with the Romans, his brother [[Arvirargus]] continues the defence, but eventually agrees to submit to Rome, and is given the hand of Claudius's daughter Genvissa in marriage. Claudius returns to Rome, leaving the province under Arviragus's governorship.

The line of British kings continues under Roman rule, and includes [[Lucius of Britain|Lucius]], Britain's first [[Christianity|Christian]] king, and several Roman figures, including the emperor [[Constantine I]], the usurper [[Allectus]] and the military commander [[Asclepiodotus of Heraclea|Asclepiodotus]]. When Octavius passes the crown to his son-in-law Maximianus, his nephew Conan Meriadoc is given rule of Brittany to compensate him for not succeeding. After a long period of Roman rule, the Romans decide they no longer wish to defend the island and depart. The Britons are immediately besieged by attacks from Picts, Scots and Danes, especially as their numbers have been depleted due to Conan colonizing Brittany and Maximianus using British troops for his campaigns. In desperation the Britons send letters to the general of the Roman forces, asking for help, but receive no reply (this passage borrows heavily from the corresponding section in Gildas' ''[[De Excidio Britanniae]]'').

===Books Five and Six===
After the Romans leave, the Britons ask the King of Brittany (Armorica), Aldroenus, descended from Conan, to rule them. However Aldroenus instead sends his brother Constantine to rule the Britons. After Constantine's death [[Vortigern]] assists their eldest son Constans in succeeding, before enabling their murder and coming to power. Constantine's remaining sons [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]] and [[Uther Pendragon|Uther]] are too young to rule and are taken to safety in Amorica. Vortigern invites the [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxons]] under [[Hengest|Hengist]] and [[Horsa]] to fight for him as mercenaries, but they rise against him. He loses control of much of his land and encounters [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]].

===Book Seven: The Prophecies of Merlin===
At this point Geoffrey abruptly pauses his narrative by inserting a series of prophecies attributed to [[Merlin]]. Some of the prophecies act as an [[epitome]] of upcoming chapters of the ''Historia'', while others are veiled allusions to historical people and events of the [[Norman people|Norman]] world in the 11th-12th centuries. The remainder are obscure.

===Book Eight===
After Aurelius Ambrosius defeats and kills Vortigern, becoming king, Britain remains in a state of war under him and his brother Uther. They are both assisted by the wizard Merlin. At one point during the continuous string of battles, Ambrosius takes ill and Uther must lead the army for him. This allows an enemy assassin to pose as a physician and poison Ambrosius. When the king dies, a comet taking the form of a dragon's head ([[pendragon]]) appears in the night sky, which Merlin interprets as a sign that Ambrosius is dead and that Uther will be victorious and succeed him. So after defeating his latest enemies, Uther adds "Pendragon" to his name and is crowned king.

But another enemy strikes, forcing Uther to make war again. This time he is temporarily defeated, gaining final victory only with the help of [[Gorlois|Duke Gorlois of Cornwall]]. But while celebrating this victory with Gorlois, he falls in love with the duke's wife, [[Igraine|Igerna]]. This leads to war between Uther Pendragon and Gorlois of Cornwall, during which Uther clandestinely lies with Igerna through the magic of Merlin. [[King Arthur|Arthur]] is conceived that night. Then Gorlois is killed and Uther marries Igerna. But he must war against the Saxons again. Although Uther ultimately triumphs, he dies after drinking water from a spring the Saxons had poisoned.

===Books Nine and Ten===
Uther's son [[King Arthur|Arthur]] assumes the throne and defeats the Saxons so severely that they cease to be a threat until after his death. In the meantime, Arthur conquers most of northern Europe and ushers in a period of peace and prosperity that lasts until the Romans, led by [[Lucius Hiberius]], demands that Britain once again pay tribute to Rome. Arthur defeats Lucius in Gaul, intending to become Emperor, but in his absence, his nephew [[Mordred]] seduces and marries [[Guinevere]] and seizes the throne.

===Books Eleven and Twelve===
Arthur returns and kills Mordred at the [[Battle of Camlann]], but, mortally wounded, he is carried off to the isle of [[Avalon]], and hands the kingdom to his cousin [[Constantine III of Britain|Constantine]], son of [[Cador]] and Duke of Cornwall.

The Saxons returned after Arthur's death, but would not end the line of British kings until the death of [[Cadwaladr|Cadwallader]]. Cadwallader is forced to flee Britain and requests the aid of King Alan of the Amoricans. However an angel's voice tells him the Britons will no longer rule and he should go to Rome. Cadwallader does so, dying there, though leaves his son and nephew to rule the remaining Britons. The remaining Britons are driven into Wales and the Saxon Athelstan becomes King of Loegria.

Geoffrey claimed to have translated the ''Historia'' into Latin from "a very ancient book in the British tongue", given to him by [[Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Thorpeintro"&gt;Thorpe (1966: 14–19)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Neil|title=The Historia Regum Britannie of Geoffrey of Monmouth|year=1984|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|location=Woodbridge, England|isbn=978-0-85991-641-7|page=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lang|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Lang|title=History Of English Literature - From  Beowulf to Swinburne|publisher=Vincent Press|page=45|quote=He says that he has had the advantage of using a book in the Breton tongue which Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford, brought out of Brittany; this book he translates into Latin.|oclc=220536211}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no modern scholars take this claim seriously.&lt;ref name="Thorpeintro"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Neil|title=The Historia Regum Britannie of Geoffrey of Monmouth|year=1984|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|location=Woodbridge, England|isbn=978-0-85991-641-7|pages=xvii–xviii|quote=This fusion of heterogeneous sources, which is apparent almost everywhere in the ''Historia'', completely dispels the fiction that the work is no more than a translation of a single Breton (or Welsh) book}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"...the ''Historia'' does not bear scrutiny as an authentic history and no scholar today would regard it as such.": Wright (1984: xxviii)&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the work appears to be derived from [[Gildas]]'s 6th-century polemic ''[[The Ruin of Britain]]'', [[Bede]]'s 8th-century ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', the 9th-century ''[[Historia Britonum|History of the Britons]]'' ascribed to [[Nennius]], the 10th-century ''[[Annales Cambriae|Welsh Annals]]'', medieval Welsh genealogies (such as the [[Harleian Genealogies]]) and king-lists, the poems of [[Taliesin]], the Welsh tale ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', and some of the medieval Welsh saints' lives,&lt;ref name="Thorpeintro" /&gt; expanded and turned into a continuous narrative by Geoffrey's own imagination.

==Influence==
In an exchange of manuscript material for their own histories, [[Robert of Torigny]] gave [[Henry of Huntington]] a copy of ''Historia Regum Britanniae'', which both Robert and Henry used uncritically as authentic history and subsequently used in their own works,&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Warren Hollister]], ''Henry I'' (Yale English Monarchs), 2001:11 note44.&lt;/ref&gt; by which means some of Geoffrey's fictions became embedded in popular history. The history of Geoffrey forms the basis for much [[Great Britain|British]] lore and literature as well as being a rich source of material for [[Welsh language|Welsh]] [[bard]]s. It became tremendously popular during the [[High Middle Ages]], revolutionising views of British history before and during the Anglo-Saxon period despite the criticism of such writers as [[William of Newburgh]] and [[Giraldus Cambrensis|Gerald of Wales]].{{cn|date=November 2017}} The prophecies of Merlin in particular were often drawn on in later periods, for instance by both sides in the issue of [[History of England|English]] influence over [[History of Scotland|Scotland]] under [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] and his successors.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

The ''Historia'' was quickly translated into [[Norman language|Norman]] verse by [[Wace]] (the ''[[Roman de Brut]]'') in 1155.  Wace's version was in turn translated into [[Middle English]] verse by [[Layamon]] (the ''[[Brut (Layamon)|Brut]]'') in the early 13th century.  In the second quarter of the 13th century, a version in Latin verse, the ''[[Gesta Regum Britanniae]]'', was produced by [[William of Rennes]].  Material from Geoffrey was incorporated into a large variety of [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] and [[Middle English]] prose compilations of historical material from the 13th century onward.

Geoffrey was translated into a number of different Welsh prose versions by the end of the 13th century,&lt;ref&gt;A. O. H. Jarman, ''Geoffrey of Monmouth'', University of Wales Press, 1965, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; collectively known as ''[[Brut y Brenhinedd]]''. One variant of the ''Brut y Brenhinedd'', the so-called ''Brut Tysilio'', was proposed in 1917 by the [[archaeology|archaeologist]] [[William Matthew Flinders Petrie|William Flinders Petrie]] to be the ancient British book that Geoffrey translated,&lt;ref&gt;[[William Matthew Flinders Petrie|Sir William Flinders Petrie]], ''[[s:Neglected British History|Neglected British History]]'', 1917&lt;/ref&gt; although the ''Brut'' itself claims to have been translated from Latin by Walter of Oxford, based on his own earlier translation from Welsh to Latin.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Cooper, ''[http://www.annomundi.com/history/chronicle_of_the_early_britons.pdf Chronicle of the Early Britons]'' (pdf), 2002, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Geoffrey's work is greatly important because it brought the Welsh culture into British society and made it acceptable. It is also the first record we have of the great figure King Lear, and the beginning of the mythical King Arthur figure. 

For many centuries, the ''Historia'' was accepted at face value, and much of its material was incorporated into [[Raphael Holinshed|Holinshed]]'s 16th-century ''Chronicles''.

Modern historians have regarded the ''Historia'' as a work of fiction with some factual information contained within. [[John Morris (historian)|John Morris]] in ''The Age of Arthur'' calls it a "deliberate spoof", although this is based on misidentifying Walter, archdeacon of Oxford, as [[Walter Map]], a satirical writer who lived a century later.&lt;ref&gt;John Morris. ''The Age of Arthur: A History of the British Isles from 350 to 650''. Barnes &amp; Noble Books: New York. 1996 (originally 1973). {{ISBN|0-7607-0243-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It continues to have an influence on popular culture, e.g. [[Mary Stewart's Merlin Trilogy|Mary Stewart's ''Merlin Trilogy'']] and the TV miniseries ''[[Merlin (miniseries)|Merlin]]'' both contain large elements taken from the ''Historia''.

==Manuscript tradition and textual history==
Two hundred and fifteen medieval manuscripts of the ''Historia'' survive, dozens of them copied before the end of the 12th century. Even among the earliest manuscripts a large number of [[Textual criticism|textual]] variants, such as the so-called "First Variant", can be discerned. These are reflected in the three possible prefaces to the work and in the presence or absence of certain episodes and phrases. Certain variants may be due to "authorial" additions to different early copies, but most probably reflect early attempts to alter, add to or edit the text. Unfortunately, the task of disentangling these variants and establishing Geoffrey's original text is long and complex, and the extent of the difficulties surrounding the text has been established only recently.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

The variant title ''Historia regum Britaniae'' was introduced in the Middle Ages, and this became the most common form in the modern period. A critical edition of the work published in 2007, however, demonstrated that the most accurate manuscripts refer to the work as ''De gestis Britonum'', and that this was the title Geoffrey himself used to refer to the work.{{sfn|Reeve|2007|p=lix}}

==Early history==
Throughout history, [[waste]] has been generated by humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewp.rpi.edu/hartford/~ernesto/S2014/SHWPCE/Papers/SHW-Introduction/Crowell-HistoryofWaste.pdf|title=The History of Waste}}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas with low [[population density]] waste generation may have been negligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://benandjerry.org.uk/blog/effects-of-population-density-on-waste-generation.html|title=Effects of Population Density on Waste Generation|first=George|last=Hensel|access-date=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In higher population areas even largely [[biodegradable waste]] had to be dealt with. Sometimes this was released back into the ground water with [[environmental degradation|environmental impact]] like [[Nor Loch#Middle Ages to 19th century|Nor Loch]]. The [[Maya civilization|Maya]] of [[Central America]] had a fixed monthly ritual, in which the people of the village would gather together and burn their garbage in large dumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://environmentalchemistry.com/yogi/environmental/wastehistory.html|title=The History of Waste}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era==
[[File:SirEdwinChadwick.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sir Edwin Chadwick]]
Following the onset of [[industrial revolution|industrialization]] and the sustained urban growth of large population centres in [[England]], the buildup of waste in the cities caused a rapid deterioration in levels of sanitation and the general quality of urban life. The streets became choked with filth due to the lack of waste clearance regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Florence Nightingale, [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/nightingale-rural.asp Selected Writings of Florence Nightingale], ed. Lucy Ridgely Seymer (New York: The Macmillan Co., 1954), pp. 38287&lt;/ref&gt; Calls for the establishment of a municipal authority with waste removal powers were mooted as early as 1751 by [[Corbyn Morris]] in London, who proposed that "...as the preservation of the health of the people is of great importance, it is proposed that the cleaning of this city, should be put under one uniform public management, and all the filth be...conveyed by the [[Thames]] to proper distance in the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciwm.co.uk/web/FILES/About_CIWM/100_yrs_London_and_SE_centre.pdf|title=CENTENARY HISTORY OF WASTE AND WASTE MANAGERS IN LONDON AND SOUTH EAST ENGLAND|access-date=2013-10-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813042213/http://www.ciwm.co.uk/web/FILES/About_CIWM/100_yrs_London_and_SE_centre.pdf|archive-date=2013-08-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first occurrence of organised solid waste management system appeared in London in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Velis|first=Costas A. |author2=David C. Wilson |author3=Christopher R. Cheeseman|date=April 2009|title=19th century London dust-yards: A case study in closed-loop resource efficiency|journal=Waste Management|volume=29|issue=4|pages=1282–1290|doi=10.1016/j.wasman.2008.10.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A waste collection and resource recovery system was established around the 'dust-yards'. Main constituent of municipal waste was the coal ash (‘dust’) which had a market value for brick-making and as a soil improver. Such profitability encouraged dust-contractors to recover effectively 100% of the residual wastes remaining after readily saleable items and materials had been removed by the informal sector in the streets ('rag-and-bone men'). Therefore, this was an early example of organised, municipal-wide solid waste management. The dust-yard system had been working successfully up to middle 1850s, when the market value of ‘dust’ collapsed. It was important in facilitating a relatively smooth transition to an institutionalised, municipally-run solid waste management system in England.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

In the mid-19th century, spurred by increasingly devastating [[cholera]] outbreaks and the emergence of a public health debate that the first consolidated legislation on the issue emerged. Highly influential in this new focus was the report ''The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population'' in 1842&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=excerpt from ''Report...from the Poor Law Commissioners on an Inquiry into the Sanitary Conditions of the Labouring Population of Great Britain'' (pp.369-372) (online source)|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/chadwick2.html|last=Chadwick|first=Edwin|chapter=Chadwick's Report on Sanitary Conditions|year=1842|publisher=to The Victorian Web|location=added by Laura Del Col|accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[social reform]]er, [[Edwin Chadwick]], in which he argued for the importance of adequate waste removal and management facilities to improve the health and wellbeing of the city's population. Chadwick's proposals were based on the [[miasmatic]] theory of disease transmission, which was proven to be false following the turn of the 1900s.

The [[environmental health officer|Nuisance Removal and Disease Prevention Act]] of 1846 began what was to be a steadily evolving process of the provision of regulated waste management in London. The [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] was the first citywide authority that centralized sanitation regulation for the rapidly expanding city and the [[Public Health Act 1875]] made it compulsory for every household to deposit their weekly waste in 'moveable receptacles' for disposal - the first concept for a dust-bin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environmentalistseveryday.org/publications-solid-waste-industry-research/information/history-of-solid-waste-management/early-america-industrial-revolution.php|title=History of Solid Waste Management|access-date=2013-10-23|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131024012358/http://www.environmentalistseveryday.org/publications-solid-waste-industry-research/information/history-of-solid-waste-management/early-america-industrial-revolution.php|archive-date=2013-10-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manlove, Alliott furnace.jpg|thumb|[[Manlove, Alliott &amp; Co. Ltd.]] 1894 destructor furnace.]]
The dramatic increase in waste for disposal led to the creation of the first [[incineration]] plants, or, as they were then called, 'destructors'. In 1874, the first incinerator was built in [[Nottingham]] by [[Manlove, Alliott &amp; Co. Ltd.]] to the design of Alfred Fryer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centenary History of Waste and Waste Managers in London and South East England|first=Lewis|last=Herbert|publisher=[[Chartered Institution of Wastes Management]]|year=2007|url=http://ciwm.activedition.com/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.aspx?lID=1094&amp;sID=469|format=PDF}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these were met with opposition on account of the large amounts of ash they produced and which wafted over the neighbouring areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oG45tkEtprwC&amp;dq=corbyn+morris+waste+management&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Recycling and the Politics of Urban Waste|author=Gandy, Matthew|year=1994|publisher=Earthscan|accessdate=2013-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar municipal systems of waste disposal sprung up at the turn of the 20th century in other large cities of [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. In 1895, [[New York City]] became the first U.S. city with public-sector garbage management.

Early [[garbage truck|garbage removal trucks]] were simply open bodied [[dump truck]]s pulled by a team of horses. They became motorized in the early part of the 20th century and the first close body trucks to eliminate odours with a dumping lever mechanism were introduced in the 1920s in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tigerdude.com/garbage/covered/index.html|title=Covered Bodies}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were soon equipped with 'hopper mechanisms' where the scooper was loaded at floor level and then hoisted mechanically to deposit the waste in the truck. The [[Garwood Load Packer]] was the first truck in 1938, to incorporate a hydraulic compactor.

In the 19th century, in the United States, cities often became choked with horse manure. While the odor was tolerable to 19th century sensitivities, walking through the streets without boots, resulted in deplorable appearing footwear. In many cities, lacking trash collection, pigs and dogs ran loose, consuming the trash, but excreting dung, which smelled offensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/2013/11/18/new-york-citys-free-roaming-trash-eating-pigs/ |title=Ephemeral New York |accessdate=November 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dead animals, particularly horses, were left lying in the streets, facilitating disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.banhdc.org/archives/ch-hist-19711000.html |title=URBAN POLLUTION-Many long years ago  |accessdate=November 13, 2016 |author=Joel A.

[[File:Einsatzgruppen murder Jews in Ivanhorod, Ukraine, 1942.jpg|thumb |upright=1.3|'' Einsatzgruppen ''  murder Jewish civilians in [[Ivanhorod]], Ukraine, 1942.]]
The '''Ivanhorod Einsatzgruppen photograph''' is an image of [[the Holocaust]], showing a soldier aiming a rifle at a woman who is trying to shield a child with her body. It depicts the murder of Jews by an ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' death squad near [[Ivanhorod]], Ukraine in 1942. The photograph was mailed, intercepted by the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance]] in [[Warsaw]], and kept by [[Jerzy Tomaszewski (photographer)|Jerzy Tomaszewski]]. In the 1960s, it was alleged that the image was a Communist forgery, but that claim was debunked. Since then, the photograph has been frequently used in books, museums, and exhibitions relating to the Holocaust. Photograph historian Janina Struk describes it as "a symbol of the barbarity of the Nazi regime and their industrial scale murder of 11 million people including 6 million European Jews".{{r|Struk|p=77}}

==Background ==

During the Holocaust, more than a million Jews were murdered in Ukraine. Most of them were shot in mass executions by ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' ([[death squads]]) and [[Ukrainian collaborators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lower |first1=Wendy |title=Introduction: the Holocaust in Ukraine |journal=Holocaust and Genocide Studies |url=https://academic.oup.com/hgs/pages/the_holocaust_in_Ukraine |language=en |page=3 |access-date=29 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181014091901/https://academic.oup.com/hgs/pages/the_holocaust_in_Ukraine |archive-date=14 October 2018 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897, the [[Russian Empire Census]] found that there were 442 Jews (out of a population of 3,032) living in [[Ivanhorod]], a village in the [[Cherkasy Oblast]] in central Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%95%D0%AD%D0%91%D0%95/%D0%93%D0%B0%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BD | encyclopedia=Brockhaus and Efron Jewish Encyclopedia |year=1910 |volume=6 |language=ru |title=Гайсин |trans-title=Haysyn |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cemetery" /&gt; In 1942, a mass shooting by ''Einsatzgruppen'' south of the town killed an unknown number of victims.

==Photograph==
[[File:Einsatzgruppen murder Jews in Ivanhorod, Ukraine, 1942 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Cropped photograph as it often appears in publications]]
There are six victims in the photograph. The body lying at the feet of the German soldier appears to be a woman who was already shot. In the center of the photograph is a woman who appears to be shielding a child. One of her feet is raised as if she is trying to flee, or else the photograph was taken just after she was shot. To her right are four men. Only one soldier is fully visible in the picture; he appears to be aiming at the men. Rifles held by German soldiers off the left edge of the photograph are visible and point at the woman and child. The shadows at the left edge of the photograph suggest that more German soldiers may be present. A wooden stake and a shovel are visible on the right side of the photo. [[Robert Fisk]] hypothesized that the victims may have been ordered to dig their own graves before being shot.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fisk |first1=Robert |title=Ukraine, 1942. What are we seeing? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/fisk/robert-fisk-ukraine-1942-what-are-we-seeing-6264646.html |accessdate=28 September 2018 |work=The Independent |date=19 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929013759/https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/fisk/robert-fisk-ukraine-1942-what-are-we-seeing-6264646.html |archive-date=29 September 2018 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|Struk|p=77}}

The identity of the photographer is unknown, but he was probably a German soldier. Many German soldiers photographed atrocities in which they were complicit.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;{{r|Struk|p=77}}

==Discovery and publication==
[[File:1939-1945 We have not forgotten cover.jpg|thumb|right|The image as it appears on the cover of the 1959 book]]
The  Polish resistance infiltrated the postal office in Warsaw in order to intercept sensitive correspondence, which they sent to the [[Polish government-in-exile]] in London.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt; Poles and Jews were forbidden to own cameras, but the Polish resistance established underground workshops for developing clandestine photographs of Nazi atrocities.{{r|Struk|pp=78–79}} A teenage boy named [[Jerzy Tomaszewski (photographer)|Jerzy Tomaszewski]] worked with an underground lab called "Foto-Rys",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Struk |first1=Janina |title='My duty was to take pictures' |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1537991,00.html |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=28 July 2005 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he intercepted a photograph with the words "Ukraine 1942, Judenaktion [Jewish Action], Iwangorod [Ivanhorod]" written on the reverse. He kept the original, which remains in his personal archive; a copy was sent to the government-in-exile in London.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;{{r|Struk|p=81}}

The photograph was first published in Poland in 1959 by the [[Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy]] on the cover of a book of photographs entitled ''1939–1945. We have not forgotten / Nous n'avons pas oublié / Wir haben es nicht vergessen''. Tomaszewski worked as one of the editors, although he knew that the book was using the photographs for Communist propaganda; he supported the publication because there was no other way to print the photographs.{{r|Struk|p=86}}&lt;ref name=notforgotten&gt;{{cite book| author =Zwiazek Bojowników o Wolnosc i Demokracje / League of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy / Union des Combattants pour la Liberté et la Démiocratie / Verband der Kämpfer für Freiheit und Demokratie| title =1939–1945. We have not forgotten / Nous n'avons pas oublié / Wir haben es nicht vergessen.| year =1959| editor =| pages =267| chapter =| chapterurl =| publisher =Polonia| location =Warsaw|oclc=804648925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many publications crop the image to the one soldier, the woman, and the child. Fisk criticized this presentation, arguing that it makes the image more aesthetically appealing at the expense of historical accuracy.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt; Conversely, photography historian Janina Struk states that cropping the image omits "the less emotional and more confusing parts of the picture".{{r|Struk|p=77}} 

Since then, the Ivanhorod photograph has been reproduced in many books, museums, and exhibitions relating to the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;{{r|Struk|p=77}} In her book ''Reading the Holocaust'', it was described by [[Inga Clendinnen]] as "iconic in its distillation of German atrocity".&lt;ref name="Clendinnen-Goldhagen"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=schciHrtx9oC&amp;pg=PA114 | title=Reading the Holocaust | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=2 May 2002 | author=Inga Clendinnen | page=114 | isbn=978-0521012690}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fisk, the photograph is "one of the most impressive and persuasive images of the Nazi Holocaust".&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;  Struk stated that it "has become a symbol of the barbarity of the Nazi regime and of the murder of 6 million European Jews".{{r|Struk|p=77}}

==Falsification allegations==
The German newspaper ''[[National Zeitung|Deutsche Soldaten Zeitung]]'' (DSZ, ''German Soldiers' Newspaper''){{r|Struk|p=86}} printed an allegation on 26 January 1962 by Professor Otto Croy, known for his writings on photographic technique, under the title ''Achtung Fälschungen'' ("Beware Fakes"). Croy claimed that the photograph had been fabricated by Communist authorities in Poland in order to falsely accuse Germany of war crimes; he alleged that the image did not depict a German soldier and that the weapons and uniforms were not authentic.{{r|Struk|p=86}}&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt; Before publishing the book, German publishing house Verlag Kurt Desch had verified the authenticity of the image by writing to Roman Karsk, professor of German literature at the [[University of Warsaw]], and he replied that it was a faithful copy of an image held by the historical archives in Warsaw depicting 1942 mass shootings.&lt;ref name="Spiegel"&gt;{{cite news |title=Abermals Fälschungen |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213132608/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46176158.html |accessdate=28 September 2018 |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=2 December 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the allegations, Tomaszewski and Tadeusz Mazur (one of the editors of ''1939–1945 We have not forgotten'') published another image from the same source in the Polish magazine ''Świat'' on 25 February. The second image depicted five armed men, one in civilian clothes and the other four in uniform, standing and looking at the camera over a pile of corpses. It bore several similarities to the better-known photograph, but lacked the "dramatic impact", according to Struk. The flat, barren terrain was identical; one of the men bore a strong resemblance to a soldier in the previous photograph; and the words "Ukraine 1942" had been written on the back of the image in the same handwriting. In the article, Tomaszewski described the DSZ as a supporter of the Third Reich and accused the paper of "revisionism".{{r|Struk|p=86}} 

The allegations continued to be recirculated in the German press for more than two years, in what Tomaszewski described as a "press war". The Polish government was concerned about a potential diplomatic incident if the image was in fact a falsification, and they sent officials to Tomaszewski's home to inspect the image. In 1965, ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' published a letter from Kurt Vieweg, a former member of a German police battalion stationed in Norway, and he confirmed that the weapons and uniforms matched those used by his unit and those of the ''Einsatzgruppen''.{{r|Struk|pp=86–87}}&lt;ref name="Spiegel"/&gt;

The '''M75''' grenade (English: Kashikara, [[Serbian Latin]]: Kašikara, [[Serbian Cyrillic]]: Кашикара) is a [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[hand grenade]],&lt;ref&gt;http://republikasrpska.forumotion.net/forum-f13/topic-t35.htm&lt;/ref&gt; efficient in trenches, forests and bunkers. The grenade consists of a body, an explosive charge and "mouse trap" style fuse mechanism, all contained in a plastic transportation can.

The core contains 3,000 steel balls with a diameter of 2.5–3&amp;nbsp;mm with an effective killing radius is 12&amp;ndash;18&amp;nbsp;m, and a  casualty radius of 30&amp;ndash;54&amp;nbsp;m. The explosive charge is 36&amp;ndash;38&amp;nbsp;grams of [[plastic explosive]]. The fuse, named "Bušon" in Serbian, has a delay time of 3 to 4.4 seconds. Its name comes from the Turkish word for a spoon, "Kašika". In [[American English]], the lever of the grenade is colloquially known as the "Spoon". The M-75 hand grenade was also produced in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], where it is designated M-93.

==Use by criminal gangs in England, Sweden and Belgium==
A shipment of leftover grenades of this type (and the M-93) from the [[Yugoslav Wars]] was taken to Sweden and sold for as little as 20 [[Swedish krona|kronor]] (cheaper than an ice cream cone) to organised criminals, who have been using them in [[List of grenade attacks in Sweden|numerous attacks]] since 2008 (ongoing as of 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/skane/billigare-att-kopa-handgranat-an-en-falafel |title=Billigare att köpa handgranat än en glass |newspaper=[[SVT]] |date=31 July 2015 |first=Diana |last=Olofsson |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ssd_ 23july2015"&gt;{{cite news|title=Malmö värst drabbat av sprängningar i hela Skandinavien|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/malmo/malmo-varst-drabbat-av-sprangningar-i-hela-skandinavien/|accessdate=24 July 2015|publisher=[[Sydsvenskan]]|date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others were used by criminal families in England, including an attack that [[Murders of Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone|killed two police officers]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-22890788 Grenade stash in Oldham drain - BBC News - 13 June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, two M75 hand grenades were used in [[Deurne, Belgium|Deurne]] (Antwerp). The attack is possibly linked a drug war in Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20180316_03414135|title=‘Granaten gebruik je toch alleen in oorlog?’|work=De Standaard|access-date=2018-03-17|language=nl-BE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Magnus Sinus''' or '''Sinus Magnus''' ([[Latin]]; {{lang-grc-gre|ὀ Μέγας Κόλπος}}, ''o Mégas Kólpos''),{{sfnp|Ptolemy|c. 150|loc=Vol.&amp;nbsp;VII, §3 &amp; 5}}{{sfn|Agathemerus|loc=Vol.&amp;nbsp;I, p.&amp;nbsp;53}} also [[anglicization of names|anglicized]] as the {{nowrap|'''Great Gulf''',}} was the form of the [[Gulf of Thailand]] and [[South China Sea]] known to [[Greek geographers|Greek]], [[Roman geographers|Roman]], [[medieval Arab geographers|Arab]], [[medieval Persian geographers|Persian]], and [[Renaissance cartographers]] before the [[Age of Discovery]]. It was then briefly conflated with the [[Pacific Ocean]] before disappearing from maps.
__NOTOC__

==History==
{{further|Sino-Roman relations|Daqin|Chinese cartography|Chinese geography}}
The gulf and its major port of [[Cattigara]] had supposedly been reached by a 1st-century [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]] trader named Alexander, who returned safely and left a [[periplus]] of his voyage.{{sfnp|Glover|2005}} His account that Cattigara was "some days" sail from [[Zaba (Ptolemy)|Zaba]] was taken by [[Marinus of Tyre|Marinus]] of [[Tyre (city)|Tyre]] to mean "numberless" days and by [[Ptolemy]] to mean "a few".{{sfnp|Suárez|1999|p=99}}{{refn|group=note|"Marinus does not exhibit the mileage from the [[Golden Chersonese]] to [[Cattigara]]. But he says that Alexander has described the land beyond to lie facing the south, and that after sailing by this for 20 days you reach the city of Zaba, and still saying on for some days southward but rather to the left [i.e., east] you reach Cattigara. He exaggerates the distance, for the expression is ''some days'' not ''many days''. He says indeed that no numerical statement of the days was made because they were so many: but this I take to be ridiculous."{{refn|Ptolemy,{{sfnp|Ptolemy|c. 150}} translated by Yule.{{sfnp|Yule|1866|p=cl}}}}}} Both Alexander and Marinus's works have been lost, but were claimed as authorities by Ptolemy in [[Ptolemy's Geography|his ''Geography'']].{{sfnp|Ptolemy|c. 150|loc=Vol.&amp;nbsp;I, §14}} Ptolemy (and presumably Marinus before him) followed [[Hipparchus]] in making the [[Indian Ocean]] a landlocked sea, placing Cattigara on its [[terra incognita|unknown eastern shoreline]]. The expanse formed between it and the [[Malay Peninsula]] (the "[[Golden Chersonese]]"), he called the Great Gulf.{{sfnp|Bunbury|1911|p=625}}

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Al-Khwarizmi's map.png|thumb|left|[[Hubert Dauntich|Dauntich]]'s reconstruction of the [[Indian Ocean]] area of [[al-Khwārizmī]]'s [[Book of the Description of the Earth|world map]], showing the replacement of the eastern shore of the Great Gulf with the [[Dragon's Tail (peninsula)|Dragon's Tail]]]] --&gt;
[[Ptolemy's Geography|Ptolemy's ''Geography'']] was translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] by a team of scholars including [[al-Khwārizmī]] in the 9th century during the reign of [[al-Maʿmūn]]. By that time, Arab merchants such as [[Soleiman the Merchant|Soleiman]] had begun regular commerce with [[Tang China]] and, having passed through the [[Strait of Malacca]] ''en route'', shown that the Indian Sea communicated with the [[World Ocean|open ocean]]. African traders similarly showed{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} that the coastline did not turn sharply east south of [[Cape Prasum]] below [[Zanzibar]] as Ptolemy held.{{sfnp|Bunbury|1911|p=624}} [[Al-Khwārizmī]]'s influential ''[[Book of the Description of the Earth]]'', therefore, removed Ptolemy's unknown shores from the Indian Ocean. The robustly-described lands east of the Great Gulf, however, were retained as a phantom peninsula (now generally known as the [[Dragon's Tail (peninsula)|Dragon's Tail]]).

Just after 1295, [[Maximus Planudes]] restored Ptolemy's Greek text and maps at [[Chora Monastery]] in [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]). This was translated into Latin at [[Republic of Florence|Florence]] by [[Jacobus Angelus]] around 1406 and quickly spread the work's information and misinformation throughout Western Europe. The maps initially repeated Ptolemy's enclosed Indian Sea. Following word of [[Bartholomew Dias]]'s circumnavigation of Africa, maps by [[Henricus Martellus|Martellus]] and by [[Martin of Bohemia]] replaced this with a new form of the [[Dragon's Tail peninsula]], including details from [[Il Milione|Marco Polo]]. As early as 1540, [[Age of Discovery|continuing exploration]] led [[Sebastian Münster]] to conflate the Great Gulf with the [[Pacific Ocean]] west of the [[Americas]], supposing that the 1st-century Alexander had crossed to a port in [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]] and safely returned.{{sfnp|Suárez|1999|p=99}} The idea was repeated by [[Ortelius]] and others.{{sfnp|Suárez|1999|p=71}} (Some modern [[South America]]n scholars have returned to the idea as recently as the 1990s, but there remains no substantial evidence to support the idea.{{sfnp|Richardson|2003}}) The Great Gulf was finally dispensed with in all its forms as more accurate accounts returned from both the [[East Indies|East]] and [[West Indies]].

[[File:DAnville Cattigara 1794.jpg|thumb|right|A detail from an 18th-century map showing the common identification of the Great Gulf with the Gulf of Thailand{{sfnp|d'Anville|1763}}]]

==Details==
The details of the Great Gulf changed somewhat among its various forms, but the ancient and Renaissance [[Ptolemy's Geography|Ptolemaic accounts]] had it bound on the west by the [[Golden Chersonese]] and on the north and east by the ports of the [[Sinae]], chief among which was [[Cattigara]].{{sfnp|Vaux|1854b}} [[Medieval Islamic cartographers]] followed [[al-Khwārizmī]] in having a strait southeast of the gulf communicating with the [[Sea of Darkness]]. Believing the [[circumference of the Earth]] to follow Ptolemy's reduced figures or even smaller ones, cartographers during the early phases of the [[Age of Discovery]] expanded the Gulf to form the [[Pacific Ocean]] west of [[South America]], considered to represent a [[Dragon's Tail (peninsula)|southeastern peninsula]] of Asia.

Modern reconstructions agree in naming the [[Golden Chersonese]] a form of the [[Malaysian Peninsula]] but differ in their considerations of how much of the [[South China Sea]] to include within Ptolemy's reckoning of the Great Gulf. Those following Alexander's route from Zaba on its northern shore to Cattigara to its southeast consider it to be no more than the [[Gulf of Thailand]], with Cattigara located in the [[Kingdom of Funan|Funanese]] [[Óc Eo]] ruins at [[Thoại Sơn]]. Its [[Cottiaris River]] would then be a former course of the [[Mekong River|Mekong]] which once passed the site to enter the [[Gulf of Thailand]].{{sfnp|Herrmann|1938}}{{sfnp|Malleret|1962}}{{sfnp|Glover|2005}} Others ignoring the route as garbled but taking Cattigara to be the major [[Han Empire|Han]] entrepôt of [[Longbian Commandery|Longbian]] consider the Great Gulf to have been the [[Gulf of Tonkin]], hypothesizing that the Gulf of Thailand (if present) was represented by the smaller inlet on the eastern shore of the Golden Chersonese. Its Cottiaris River would have been [[Vietnam]]'s [[Red River (Vietnam)|Red River]]. [[Panyu]] ([[Guangzhou]]) had been the major port of the [[Kingdom of Nanyue]] but identifications of Ptolemy's Cattigara with Han-era [[Nanhai Commandery|Nanhai]], though common in the past,{{sfnp|Smith|1854}}{{sfnp|Vaux|1854a}} are credited little more than those placing it in Peru.

The '''Mosaic of Reḥob''' (also known as the '''Tel Rehov inscription''' and '''Baraita of the Boundaries''') is a [[mosaic]] discovered in 1973, inlaid in the floor of the [[foyer]] or narthex of an ancient synagogue near [[Tel Rehov]],&lt;ref&gt;The actual archaeological site was located ca. {{convert|800|m|ft}} northwest of Tel Rehov.&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|4.5|km|mi|sp=us}} south of [[Beit She'an]] and about {{convert|6.5|km}} west of the [[Jordan River]], containing the longest written text hitherto discovered in any mosaic in the [[Land of Israel]], and also the oldest known [[Talmud]]ic text.

Unlike other mosaics found in the region, the Reḥob mosaic has very little in the form of ornate design and symmetric patterns, but is unique due to its inscription, acclaimed by scholars to be one of the most important epigraphical findings discovered in Israel in the last century.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Sussmann, ''The Inscription in the Synagogue at Rehob'', pub. in: "Qadmoniot": A Journal for the Antiquities of Eretz-Israel and Bible Lands, vol. no. 4 (32) / 1975, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Its text sheds invaluable light on the [[historical geography]] (toponymy) of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and late-[[Byzantium|Byzantine]] periods, as well as on Jewish and non-Jewish ethnographic divisions in Palestine for the same periods and their relation to one another, specifically, on agricultural produce cultivated by farmers, and the extent of Jewish law regulating the use of such farm products grown in the region of Beit Shean ([[Beit She'an|Scythopolis]]) and the Jordan valley, Sussitha ([[Hippos]]) and its neighboring cities on the east bank of the [[Sea of Galilee]], Naveh ([[Nawa, Syria|Nawā]]) in the Roman province of [[Arabia Petraea]], [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and its neighboring cities to the south, as well as towns in the vicinity of [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebaste]] and [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]], and [[Ashqelon]] to the south. By delineating the boundaries of the [[Land of Israel]], it seeks to establish the legal status of the country in its various parts from the time of Israel's return from the [[Babylonian captivity]],&lt;ref&gt;The Baraitta of the borders of Eretz-Israel is, for all practical purposes, only a geographical reference to the old borders, as once settled, but not an ethnographic reference to the border for all time, since demographics change.&lt;/ref&gt; and whether or not local farm products acquired by Jews from other Jews, or from gentiles and Samaritans, are exempt or obligated in what concerns the laws of [[Seventh Year]] produce, and of ''[[demai]]''-produce. The mosaic also describes different kinds of fruits and vegetables that were cultivated in the country at the time.

The site of the ancient synagogue was first discovered by members of [[Kibbutz]] [[Ein HaNetziv]] while preparing their lands for cultivation in the late 1960s, lands that had belonged to the villagers of [[Farwana]] before 1948. An archaeological excavation of the site in 1973, led by a team under [[Israel Antiquities Authority|IAA]] Fanny Vitto, revealed the mosaic and its content, which is now on display at the [[Israel Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Archaeology Wing - Ward 6 (The Holy Land).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of mosaic==
The mosaic pieces are made of black [[limestone]] tesserae contrasted against a white background, measuring {{convert|4.30|x|2.75|m|ft}}, with an accompanying text written on 29&amp;nbsp;lines, comprising a total of 350&amp;nbsp;words,&lt;ref&gt;Fanny Vitto, ''Ancient Synagogue at Rehov'', pub. in: Israel Antiquities Authority ('Atiqot: Hebrew Series), 1974, pp. 102–104&lt;/ref&gt; with an average length of {{convert|4|m|ft}} to each line. It begins with the salutation, "Shalom" – Peace!, followed by a long [[halakhic]] text, and ends with the salutation, "Shalom," followed by an appendix where it lists some eighteen towns in the vicinity of [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebaste]] (the ancient city of Samaria) whose fruits and vegetables were exempt from tithes and the stringencies applied to Seventh Year produce. There is little uniformity in the size of the letters, while the spelling of some words is faulty. Portions of the main text contain elements that are related to late second-century [[rabbinic literature]], particularly that found in the [[Tosefta]] (''Shevi'it'' 4:8–11), the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''Demai'' 2:1; ''Shevi'it'' 6:1) and [[Sifrei]] on Deuteronomy 11:24, although the mosaic of Reḥob expands on aspects of each. The more ancient text in the Reḥob mosaic has been used to correct errors in transmission of extant rabbinic texts.

==Legal (''halakhic'') background==
The text in the Reḥob mosaic can only be understood in the context of [[Halakha|Jewish law]] at the time, which required the [[Tithes in Judaism|tithing]] of agricultural produce six years out of a seven-year cycle, as well as the observance of [[Shmita|Seventh Year]] law strictures on the same produce once in every seven years. This, too, was contingent upon lands that had been settled by returning Jews from the [[Babylonian captivity]]. The underlying principle in Jewish law states that when the Jewish exiles returned from the Babylonian captivity in the 4th century BCE, the extent of territories resettled by them in [[Galilee]] and in [[Judea]] did not equal nor exceed the territory originally conquered by Israel at the time of [[Joshua]], more commonly referred to as "those who came-up from Egypt."&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Hullin'' 7a; ''Yebamot'' 16a); [[Maimonides]], [[Mishne Torah]] (Hil. ''Terumot'' 1:5).&lt;/ref&gt; The practical bearing of this restructuring of boundaries (although still part of the biblical [[Land of Israel]] proper)&lt;ref&gt;As argued by [[Ishtori Haparchi]] in his seminal work, ''Kaftor Vaferach'' (vol. 2), Third edition, Chapter 11, Jerusalem 2007, pp. 40, 42 (Hebrew). Although [[Rashi]] in BT Hullin 6b (s.v. את בית שאן כולה) says that Beit She'an was not part of the Land of Israel, Ishtori Haparchi argues that the sense here is to places not captured by the Returnees from Babylon, although they were conquered by Joshua, and which places have only the technical name of "outside the Land of Israel," just as we see with [[Acre, Israel|Akko]] in BT Gittin 76b. Likewise, Beit She'an was subdued by Israel during the time of Joshua, forcing its inhabitants to pay tribute unto Israel (BT Hullin 7a on [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0701.htm Judges 1:27–28]), but was not taken by the Returnees from Babylon.&lt;/ref&gt; meant that places then settled by non-Jewish residents in the land (whether [[Phoenicians]], [[Syrians]], [[Grecians]], or otherwise) and not taken by Israel were not deemed as consecrated land&lt;ref&gt;As explained by [[Menachem Meiri]] in his ''Beit HaBechirah'' (''Hullin'' 6b, s.v. בית שאן), although [[Ishtori Haparchi]] (''Kaftor Vaferach'') disputes this, saying that the land was always consecrated, but that the laws regarding the land differed with Israel's return from the Babylonian exile.&lt;/ref&gt; and, therefore, fruits and vegetables grown in such places and purchased by Jews were exempt from the laws of tithing, and of Seventh Year restrictions. However, if fruits and vegetables were purchased by gentile vendors from Israelites in their respective places and transported into these non-consecrated places in order to be sold in the marketplaces, they were still made subject to tithing as ''[[demai]]''-produce by prospective Jewish buyers.&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Safrai, ''Marginal Notes on the Rehob Inscription'' (vol. 1977), Zion: Historical Society of Israel, p. 17 (note 91) (Hebrew). The term "demai" is a Halakhic term meaning "dubious," referring to agricultural produce, the owner of which was not trusted with regard to the correct separation of the tithes assigned to the Levites, although the ''terumah'' (the part designated unto priests) was believed to have been separated from such fruits. In such "dubious" cases, all that was necessary was to separate the [[Terumat Ma'aser|one-tenth portion]] due to the priests from the [[First tithe|First Tithe]] given to the Levites, being the 1/100th part of the whole. The Second Tithe is also removed (redeemed) from the fruit in such cases of doubt.&lt;/ref&gt; The fruits and vegetables mentioned in the Reḥob mosaic with respect to Beit She'an (as detailed in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]) were not locally grown in Beit She'an, but were transported there from places settled by Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Talmud]], ''Demai'' 2:1 (Commentary of [[Solomon Sirilio]]); p. 16a in the ''Oz veHadar'' edition of the Jerusalem Talmud.&lt;/ref&gt; Beit She'an was a frontier city along the country's eastern front with Transjordan, and since it was not initially settled by Israelites upon their return from Babylon, although later Israelites had joined the local inhabitants,&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]] mentions a population of above 13,000 Jews in Beit She'an at the outset of the war with Rome in the second half of the 1st century CE (Josephus, ''[[The Jewish War]]'', ii.xviii.§3).&lt;/ref&gt; all home-grown fruits and vegetables there were made exempt from tithing in the days of Rabbi [[Judah HaNasi]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Hullin'' 6b–7a); [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''Demai'' 2:1, s.v. ר' זעירא ר' חייא בשם ר' יוחנן רבי התיר בית שאן). According to the Talmud, Rabbi Judah HaNasi, taking as an [[exemplum]] an act that he heard performed by [[Rabbi Meir]], released the entire region of Beit Shean from the obligations of tithing home-grown produce, and from observing the Seventh Year laws with respect to the same produce. He also did the same for the cities of Kefar Ṣemaḥ, [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] and [[Beit Jibrin|Beit Gubrin]]. Rabbi [[Abraham ben David]] of [[Posquières]] holds that the enactment made by Rabbi Judah HaNasi applied only to vegetables, but not unto produce belonging to harvested grain (wheat, barley, spelt, etc.), the fruit of the vine (grapes, raisins, wine), or to produce derived from the olive tree (olives and olive oil), since the commandment to tithe these products is a biblical injunction.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translation of ancient text==
{{cquote|Shalom. These fruits are forbidden in [[Beit She'an]] during the [[Seventh Year]], but during other years of the seven-year cycle they are tithed as ''[[demai]]''-produce: cucumbers,&lt;ref&gt;The Hebrew word used is '''הקישואין''' (''ha-qishū'īn''), a word that has since changed in meaning, but which had the original connotation of "cucumbers," as explained by [[Maimonides]]' commentary on [[Mishnah]] (''Terumah'' 8:6), and just as it is found in the Aramaic [[Targum]]s of Numbers 11:5 = בוציניא / קטייה, which words, in both cases, are explained by [[J. Payne Smith]]'s, ''A Compendious Syriac Dictionary'', Oxford 1903, pp. 39, 500, as meaning "cucumbers." Rabbi [[Saadia Gaon]], in his [[Judeo-Arabic]] translation of the Pentateuch, uses the Arabic word אלקת'א (Ar. القثاء) for the same fruit, meaning "cucumbers," believed by scholars to have been the [[Armenian cucumber]], or related varieties, such as ''Cucumis melo convar adzhur'', and what is now known as ''al-fāḳḳūs'' in Arabic.&lt;/ref&gt; [[watermelons]], [[muskmelons]],&lt;ref&gt;The Hebrew word used here is a Greek loanword, '''המלפפונות''' (''ha-melephephonot''; sing. ''melephephon''). The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''Kilayim'' 1:2) relates an ancient belief that if one were to take a seed from a watermelon and a seed from an apple, and then place them together in an impression made in the earth, the two seeds would fuse together and become [[Kil'ayim (prohibition)|diverse kinds]]. "It is for this reason," says the narrator of the Talmud, "that they call it (i.e. the fruit) by its Greek name, ''melephephon''. The old Greek word for "melon" was actually μήλο = ''mêlo(n)'' apple + πεπόν = ''pépōn'' melon, meaning literally "apple-shaped melon" (see: Random House Webster's College Dictionary, s.v. melon). This fruit, muskmelon ([[Cucumis melo]]), was thought to be a cross-breed between a watermelon and an apple. Maimonides, however, calls "melephephon" in [[Mishnah]] ''Kilayim'' 1:2 and ''Terumah'' 8:6 by the Arabic name, ''al-khiyyar'', meaning "cucumbers" ([[Cucumis sativus]]) – far from being anything related to apples and watermelons. Talmudic exegete, Rabbi [[Solomon Sirilio]] (1485–1554), disputed Maimonides' view in his commentary on the Jerusalem Talmud (Kila'im 1:2, s.v. קישות), saying that Maimonides explained "melephephon" to mean in Spanish "pepinos" = cucumbers (Cucumis sativus), which, in the opinion of an early Mishnaic exegete, Rabbi Isaac of [[Siponto]] (c. 1090–1160), was really to be identified as “small, round melons” (Cucumis melo), since Rabbi Yehudah in our Mishnah holds that it is a diverse kind in relation to ''kishūt'' (a type of cucumber). Moreover, had the "melephephon" simply been a subspecies of ''kishūt'', explained by Maimonides as having the meaning of ''al-fakous'' (Egyptian cucumber = Cucumis melo var. chate), in the Arabic language, they would not have been considered diverse kinds with respect to each other, similar to a black ox and a white ox that plough together are not considered diverse kinds. Nevertheless, today, in [[Modern Hebrew]], the word ''melephephon'' is now used to denote "cucumbers," based on Maimonides' identification. Cf. Elad Kapah, ''The Identification of the Mishna Plants According to Rabbi Natan's Commentary of the Mishna'', [[Bar-Ilan University]]: Ramat-Gan 2007, p. 74; Zohar Amar (2012), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pastinaca sativa|parsnip]] ([[Daucus carota|carrots]]),&lt;ref&gt;The Hebrew word used here is '''האסטפליני''' (''ha-esṭafulīnī''), being a Greek loanword (σταφυλῖνος), meaning carrot ([[Daucus carota]]). Cf. Tosefta (''Uktzin'' 1:1). Zohar Amar, ''Agricultural Produce in the Land of Israel in the Middle Ages'' (Hebrew title: '''גידולי ארץ-ישראל בימי הביניים'''), [[Ben-Zvi Institute]]: Jerusalem 2000, p. 270 {{ISBN|965-217-174-3}} (Hebrew), cites physician and botanist [[Ibn al-Baitar]] (1197–1248), and his identification of flora described by [[Dioscorides]], in Ibn al-Baitar's seminal work entitled, “Tafsīr Kitāb Diāsqūrīdūs” (ed. Ibrahim Ben Mrad), chapter 3, section 49, pp. 230– 231, and where he writes that this word can mean either the wild carrot, or cultivated carrot. The word was also used to describe the "white carrot," or what is now called in English parsnip ([[Pastinaca sativa]]). Ibn al-Baitar, who lived and worked in the Levant during the Ayyubid period, mentions "eṣṭafulīn" as being the carrot, so-called in the dialect spoken by the inhabitants of al-Shām (i.e. [[Greater Syria]]). The old Hebrew word for carrot is found in Tosefta Uktzin 1:1, but also in the Jerusalem Talmud (Maaserot, ch. 2; Hallah, 4 (end); Kila'im, ch. 1).&lt;/ref&gt; mint that is bound by itself,&lt;ref&gt;The binding of the mint leaves ([[Menta]]) renders them liable to tithes and was a sign that they were not locally grown in Beit Shean. As for the mint grown in Beit Shean, it was customary bound with other herbs and was exempt from tithing ([[Solomon Sirilio]] in [[Jerusalem Talmud]], ''Demai'' 2:1).&lt;/ref&gt; [[black-eyed pea]]s&lt;ref&gt;Called in Hebrew, '''פול המצרי''' (''pōl ha-miṣrī''), which is effectually translated as the "Egyptian fava bean," although not a real Fava bean, but as Rabbi [[Nissim ben Jacob|Nissim]] has described it in his commentary known as ''Ketav ha-Mafteach,'' as being the bean which has the Arabic name of "lubiya" and which has "a dark eye in its center," meaning to say, our regular black-eyed pea, a sub-species of the cowpea ([[Vigna unguiculata]]).&lt;/ref&gt; that are bound with rush,&lt;ref&gt;Meaning, freshly grown black-eyed peas with their bean pods. Those in the marketplace which were not bound by rush were locally grown produce, and exempt from tithing.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allium ampeloprasum|wild leeks]]&lt;ref&gt;The Hebrew word used here is '''הקפלוטות''' (''ha-qaflūṭot''), a word explained in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''Kilayim'' 2:1) as meaning "wild leeks," and by [[Nathan ben Abraham]] as "Syrian leeks" ([[Judeo-Arabic]]: '''אלכראת אלשאמי'''). This may refer to [[Allium ascalonicum]], or to [[Allium ampeloprasum]], but especially to Allium ampeloprasum var. kurrat. The latter herb is called in Arabic, in the dialect spoken in Palestine, ''karrāth berri'' (=wild leek).&lt;/ref&gt; between [[Shavuot]] and [[Hanukkah]],&lt;ref&gt;Explained by [[Rabbi Zeira|Rabbi Ze'ira]] in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''Demai'' 2:1) who said that wild leeks were prohibited in Beit Shean until tithed, because the majority of wild leeks brought into the Beit Shean marketplace during these months were those wild leeks grown in other places of the country which required tithing and the observance of Seventh Year restrictions (per after growths).&lt;/ref&gt; the seed kernels,&lt;ref&gt;The Hebrew word used here is '''הזירעונין''', and refers principally to vegetable seeds, such as chickpeas ([[Cicer arietinum]]), or white peas ([[Lathyrus sativus]]), but not to cereal grains, as explained in [[Maimonides]]' commentary on [[Mishnah]] (''Kilayim'' 3:2) when describing the זרעונים of the previous Mishnah (ibid. 3:1) Cf. Maimonides on Mishnah Kelim 3:2 (Mossad Harav Kook edition).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nigella sativa|black cumin]],&lt;ref&gt;The Hebrew word used here is '''הקצע''' (''ha-qeṣaʿ''), more commonly spelled '''הקצח''' (''ha-qeṣaḥ''), since the Hebrew characters ''`ayin'' and ''ḥet'' were often interchanged in the Palestinian dialect (cf. "Pesikta deRav Kahana", Solomon Buber edition of 1949, Section 25, "Shuvah", p. 162b, note 110).&lt;/ref&gt; [[sesame]], [[Sinapsis alba|mustard]], rice, [[cumin]], dried [[Lupinus pilosus|lupines]],&lt;ref&gt;The Hebrew word used here is '''התורמסין''' (''ha-tūrmosīn''), a plant that is endemic to the hill-country of [[Judea]]. One of the more common species of lupine in the Land of Israel is [[Lupinus pilosus]], and its large bean-like seed is ready for gathering in mid-summer. The seeds, though edible, require leaching several times in boiling water to cure them from their acidity and to render them soft. Once cured, they are served salted and peppered on a platter.&lt;/ref&gt; large-sized peas&lt;ref&gt;Possibly, beans ([[Marcus Jastrow]]). The Hebrew words used here are '''האפונין הגמלונין''' (''ha-afūnīn ha-ğimlōnīn''), explained by [[Maimonides]] in his commentary on [[Mishnah]] ''Kilayim'' 3:2 as meaning "large-sized peas." The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''Demai'' 2:1), when speaking about the same peas, says that they were black in color (possibly, [[Vigna mungo]]). In any rate, these were to be distinguished from the ordinary pea ([[Pisum sativum]]). In Modern Hebrew, '''אפונים''' is understood as meaning garden pea (Pisum sativum). However, in old Hebrew, the word '''אפונים''', as explained by [[Maimonides]] in his commentary on [[Mishnah]] (''Peah'' 3:3 and ''Shabbat'' 21:3), meant [[garbanzo bean]]s (Cicer arietinum), and where he uses the [[Judeo-Arabic]] word '''אלחמץ''' (garbanzo beans) for this plant. However, according to one of the oldest Mishnah commentaries now at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, in which it preserves the commentaries of [[Nathan ben Abraham I|Rabbi Nathan]] (President of the Academy in Eretz Israel during the 11th century), the word '''אפונים''' also had the equivalent meaning of the Arabic word '''الكشد''', meaning stringed beans [[Vigna nilotica]] (see: Elad Kapah, ''The Identification of the Mishna Plants According to Rabbi Natan's Commentary of the Mishna'', [[Bar-Ilan University]]: Ramat-Gan 2007, p. 25).&lt;/ref&gt; that are sold by measure, [[garlic]], [[scallion]]s&lt;ref&gt;The sense here is to spring onions.&lt;/ref&gt; of the city that are sold by measure, [[grape hyacinth]]s,&lt;ref&gt;The Hebrew word used here is '''הבולבסין''' (''ha-būlḇosīn''), meaning the grape hyacinth (Muscari commutatum), endemic to Israel; a pleasant flowering plant with bulbous roots that are eaten fresh or pickled after boiling several times (see [[Lampascioni#Cuisine|Method of Preparing]]). The plant was formerly cultivated in the hill country of Judea, and used also as an ornamental or for use in perfume. Other species of the grape hyacinth endemic to Israel are ''Muscari parviflorum'' and ''M. neglectum''. The Hebrew word is a Greek loanword, derived from βολβός, an edible bulbous plant described in [[Theophrastus]]' ''Enquiry into Plants''.&lt;/ref&gt; late-ripening [[Date palm|dates]],&lt;ref&gt;The Hebrew words used here are '''התמרין אפסיות''' (''ha-temarin afsiyot''), which meaning is disputed by the commentators. Some say, by way of conjecture, that the adjective (''Afsiyot'') may probably be a denominative, meaning dates brought into Beit Shean from Ephes or Afsit ([[Moses Margolies]] in ''P'nei Moshe''; [[Marcus Jastrow]] in ''Dictionary of the Targum'', s.v. אפסיות). Others (Immanuel Löw, in ''Die Flora der Juden'' vol. 2, p. 343) say that "it seems to be referring to late ripening dates." [[Elijah of Fulda]] says that the sense here is to "bitter dates." In contrast, Dr. Akiva London, an agronomist from the Department of Land of Israel Studies and Archaeology at [[Bar-Ilan University]], has suggested that ''temarim afsiyot'' may have actually been a cultivar of date that grew either in Jericho (the ''Posittatium'') and used primarily for matting, or else a cultivar that grew in Hippos near the Sea of Galilee, from whence it derived its name ''ipposiyot'' (rather than ''afsiyot''), literally meaning "from Hippos."

In this case, they too would require the removal of the tithe known as ''demai''. All other fruits and vegetables cultivated in Beit She'an would have been exempt from tithing altogether, seeing that when Rabbi [[Judah HaNasi]] permitted the eating of vegetables in the Seventh Year in Beit She'an,&lt;ref&gt;That is to say, when he released Israel from observing the restrictions associated with that year (such as the rabbinic prohibition of eating "aftergrowths," or the requirement to discard from one's home any Seventh Year fruit once the growing season for such fruit had ended and the like of such fruit could no longer be found in the fields &lt;[[Ishtori Haparchi]], ''Kaftor Vaferach'' [vol. 1, ch. 5; p. 62 in Avraham Yosef Havatzelet's 2004 edition]; [[Obadiah of Bertinoro]]&gt;). However, Ishtori Haparchi (ibid. ch. 5, p. 68) has explained that Rabbi Judah HaNasi would still require the tithing of any of the five cereal grains, grapes, and olives in Beit She'an, since their ordinance is a rabbinic ordinance that is still applicable and has not been cancelled.&lt;/ref&gt; it was one and the same enactment, namely, the release from the Seventh Year obligations and the release from tithing all produce throughout the remaining six years of the seven-year cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''Shevi'it'' 6:4); p. 51a in the ''Oz veHadar'' edition, or [http://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevi'it.18a?lang=he 18a] in most other editions.&lt;/ref&gt;]&lt;/small&gt;

The word, ''ḳumpon'', is a Greek loanword, derived from κάμπον (campus), and used in [[Mishnah]] ''Kelim'' 23:2, s.v. '''קומפון'''. Rabbi [[Hai Gaon]] explains its import as meaning: "a [level] field where kings entertain themselves" (i.e. in the presence of their soldiers), hence: "Gate of the open field." [[Maimonides]], writing similarly, says that it has the connotation of a "stadium, where the king's soldiers would show-off their valor and good horsemanship by riding their horses while standing upon the stirrups" (cf. Marcus Jastrow, ''Dictionary of the Targumim'', s.v. '''קומפון'''). Rabbi [[Hillel ben Eliakim]] of Salonika (12th century CE) explained the word '''קומפון''' in the [[Sifrei]] of Deuteronomy as meaning, "[[hippodrome]] in the Greek language in which all the people enter" (Zeev Weiss, 2001 - p. 40).&lt;/ref&gt; extending as far as the White Field;&lt;ref&gt;The name of this place is written in Aramaic, '''חקלה''' = field + '''חיורתה''' = white (White Field).&lt;/ref&gt; from the west, that is to say, [from] the Gate of Zayara extending as far as the end of the pavement; from the north, that is to say, the Gate of Sakkūtha extending as far as Kefar Ḳarnos,&lt;ref&gt;Text: כפר קרנוס (=The Village of Ḳarnos).&lt;/ref&gt; while Kefar Ḳarnos [itself] is deemed as Beit She'an;&lt;ref&gt;Meaning, the butts and bounds of Beit She'an and its special laws of release from tithing of produce, &amp;c. apply to the village of Kefar Ḳarnos as well, making its inhabitants as the citizens of Beit She'an in this regard.&lt;/ref&gt; and from the east, that is to say, the Gate of the Dung-spreaders&lt;ref&gt;The name of this place is written in Aramaic, '''פילי''' = gate + '''ד''' = the genitive case ''of'' + '''זבלייה''' = the dung spreaders. This last word, "dung spreaders," is the same word used in [[Midrash Rabba]] (Canticles Rabba 1:9): "Said Rabbi Elʻazar: In all my days, no man has ever gone into the House of Study before me. Neither have I ever left a man sitting there by himself while I departed. Once, I rose up [from my sleep] and I found those that spread manure (Aramaic: '''זבלייה''') [in their fields] and those that mowed hay [who had already risen up before me to do their work], etc."&lt;/ref&gt; extending as far as the monument of Fannuqatiah,&lt;ref&gt;The sense here is to a burial monument, just as the word נפש is explained by Rabbi [[Hai Gaon]], in his commentary on the [[Mishnah]] (''Seder Ṭaharot'',Ohelot 7:1).&lt;/ref&gt; while the Gate of Kefar Zimrin and the Gate of the marshland,&lt;ref&gt;Fanny Vitto understood the graphemes of the text to read: '''ופילי ראגמה''' = ''the Gate of Ragama'', but since the Hebrew character ''resh'' (ר) is often confounded with ''daleth'' (ד), Jacob Sussmann (1975, p. 125) has corrected the text to read: '''ופילי דאגמה''' = ''the Gate of the marshland''.&lt;/ref&gt; in those places that are within the gate, [what is grown] is permitted, but beyond [the gate without, what is grown] is prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;Meaning, the release from tithes applies to them as well only where produce is grown within the village walls.&lt;/ref&gt; The towns that are prohibited in the region of Sussitha ([[Hippos]])&lt;ref&gt;Meaning, the town that once stood 3 km. east of the lower eastern shore of the [[Sea of Galilee]], also known as ''Qalʻat el-Ḥuṣn''. The novelty of this teaching is that, although this part of the country was partly settled by Israel during their return from Babylonia, by the late 1st century CE, it was mostly populated by a non-Jewish majority, as evidenced by Josephus ([[The Jewish War]] ii.xviii.§5), who relates how the Syrians of that place persecuted the Jews during the [[Great Jewish Revolt]]. Elsewhere, Josephus (''Antiquities'' xvii.xi.iv) writes that in the days of [[Herod Archelaus]] (died c. 18 CE), Hippos was already a Grecian city. According to [[Ishtori Haparchi]] (''Kaftor Vaferach'', vol. 1, ch. 5, p. 69 in Avraham Yosef Havatzelet's 2004 edition), a discrepancy is found in the [[Tosefta]]. In one place (''Ohelot'' 18:4) it says: "Towns that are swallowed-up in the Land of Israel, such as Sussitha and her neighboring towns, [or] Ashqelon and her neighboring towns, even though they are '''exempt from tithing''' and from the law of Seventh Year produce, they do not fall under the category of [defilement by] the land of the gentiles," but in another place (Tosefta, ''Shevi'it'' 4:10) it says: "The towns that are '''obligated in what concerns tithes''' in the region of Sussitha, etc." In one place it says they are exempt, but in another place it says they are obligated. Ishtori Haparchi (''ibid''.) attempts to rectify the discrepancy by saying that "region" (in ''Shevi'it'') and the "neighboring towns" (in ''Ohelot'') have two distinct ''halakhic'' implications. The "neighboring towns" (in ''Ohelot'') refer to non-Jewish towns (such as Sussitha) stretching along the periphery of Israel's borders; the word "region" (in ''Shevi'it'') refers to Jewish towns in the region of Sussitha. In any rate, by saying "towns that are prohibited," the Rehob inscription requires tithing in such places.&lt;/ref&gt; [are as follows]: 'Ayyanosh,&lt;ref&gt;Text: '''עינוש''', a place identified by [[Michael Avi-Yonah]] (1979), p. 170, as being what is now called ''`Awânish''.&lt;/ref&gt; 'Ain-Ḥura,&lt;ref&gt;A destroyed village in the upper [[Golan Heights]], ca. {{convert|16|km|mi|sp=us}} east of where the [[Hasbani River]], and the [[Dan River (Middle East)|Dan]] and [[Banias]] tributaries converge to form the Jordan River.

&lt;small&gt;['''Excursus:''' The import of detailing the above frontier towns and villages was to show the boundaries of the Land of Israel as retained by the Jews who returned from the [[Babylonian captivity]]. Where agricultural produce was prohibited unto Jews living in these areas, this implies that these places were originally part of those places settled by the Returnees from Babylon, and that since the land was consecrated by their arrival in those parts, all fruits and vegetables were prohibited until the time that they could be tithed, and the land was required to lie fallow during the Seventh Year. However, where the places were designated as "dubious," this is explained in the [[Tosefta]] (''Shevi'it'' 4:8) as meaning that initially these places were permitted (as there was no requirement to tithe produce grown in these places), but later the [[Sages of Israel]] made all fruits and vegetables in these places prohibited until they were first tithed. This may have been the result of produce being brought into these towns and villages from regions liable to tithing and sold there, or else it was not clear unto the Sages if these places had actually been settled by the people of Israel who returned from Babylon. In any case, the practice is to behave stringently with regard to such produce.] &lt;/small&gt;

===Regulation of produce between Achziv (Chezib) and Tyre===
The maritime city of [[Acre, Israel|Akko]] (Ptolemais), and the river south of [[Achziv]] (Chezib),&lt;ref&gt;On the far western coastline, the precise place marking the extent of the boundary of ''Eretz Israel'' in the vicinity of Chezib was understood to be the River below Chezib (i.e. ''Nahr Mefshukh'', or what is now called ''Naḥal Ga'athon''), in accordance with a teaching in [[Tosefta]] (''Shevi'it'' 4:6): "Which is the Land of Israel? From the river south of Achzib, etc." Some have erroneously identified this river as the Kasmieh River (also called [[Litani River]]) in southern Lebanon. The river (''Nahr Mefshukh'') is shown in the [http://www.iaa-archives.org.il/zoom/zoom.aspx?folder_id=93&amp;type_id=6&amp;id=8366 Palestine Exploration Fund map] produced in 1878. As one moved further east of this place, the border extended northward.&lt;/ref&gt; a small coastal town ca. {{convert|15|km|mi|sp=us}} north of Acre, according to the [[Mishnah]] (''Demai'' 1:3 and ''Gittin'' 1:2), were the extent of the northern boundary settled by Jews returning from the [[Babylonian captivity]] in the days of [[Ezra]].&lt;ref&gt;A view largely held by many, including by [[Ishtori Haparchi]] in his seminal work, ''Kaftor Vaferach'', vol. 1, ch. 5, p. 69 (note 120) in the Avraham Yosef Havatzelet edition of 2004. Although the butts and bounds of Akko were mentioned to imply that bills of divorce written there must be done in the presence of competent witnesses, see the [[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Gittin 76b''), where it states that whenever the Rabbis would escort their companions northbound, they would only go with them as far as Akko, so as not to leave the border of the country taken by the Returnees from Babylonia. Nevertheless, part of the country taken by the Returnees from Babylon also bypassed Akko to the right-hand side, and extended as far as Achziv (Chezib) to the north, just as it is explained in the [[Tosefta]] (''Ohelot'' 18:14): "He that walks [northbound] from Akko to Chezib, from his right-side towards the east the route is pure in terms of [defilement from] land of the gentiles, and he is obligated in what concerns the tithe and Seventh Year produce, until it becomes known [to him once again] that it is exempt; but from his left-side towards the west the route is defiled in terms of land of the gentiles, and [such produce] is exempt from tithes and from the laws governing the Seventh Year, until it becomes known [to him once more] that it is obligated, until he reaches Chezib." The same Baraitta is quoted in the Jerusalem Talmud, (''Shevi'it'' [http://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevi'it.16a?lang=he 16a]). On the [http://www.iaa-archives.org.il/zoom/zoom.aspx?folder_id=93&amp;type_id=6&amp;id=8366 Palestine Exploration Fund Map] of 1878, the coastal city of Achziv is written there by its Arabic name, ''ez-Zīb''.&lt;/ref&gt; Produce locally grown in the country beyond Achziv was exempt from the rules of ''demai''-produce.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mishnah'' (ed.

Israelites who frequented these areas, or who had moved there, were likely to buy fruits that had not been properly tithed in Israel. The emphasis on the regulation of agricultural produce obtained by Israel in the following northern areas, or, as the Rehob inscription says, "what an Israelite has purchased" in those parts, was because of its doubtful nature.

See previous note for its location.&lt;/ref&gt; Bebarah,&lt;ref&gt;The word, as spelt in the original mosaic, reads as '''ביברה''', which Raphael Frankel suggests is the town formerly known as ''Bibra'' ([[sic]]), but which is now a ruin, known as ''Khurbet Bobriyeh'', and which lies ca. {{convert|5.5|km|mi|sp=us}} east of ''Naḥal Keziv'', what was formerly called ''Wady el Kurn'' (see: Raphael Frankel - 1979). The ancient mound is shown on the ''Survey of Western Palestine map'' produced by CR. Conder and H.H. Kitchener ([http://www.iaa-archives.org.il/zoom/zoom.aspx?folder_id=93&amp;type_id=6&amp;id=8366 sheet # 3]). [[Ze'ev Safrai]], however, suggested that the word ''Bebarah'' (or ''Bebadah'', as he understood its graphemes) is actually a contraction of two words: ''Be'' ('''בי'''), meaning "House" + ''Bada'' ('''בדה'''), meaning the shortened form of ''ʿAbdah'', being the ancient city of ''ʿAbdon'', a city called in late antiquity by the name ''ʿAbdah'' and where is now built the Israeli settlement [[Avdon]] (Zeev Safrai, 1977, p. 17).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ras al-Ain, Lebanon|Rosh Mayya]],&lt;ref&gt;Hebrew: '''ראש מייה'''; [[Samuel Klein (scholar)|Samuel Klein]] suggests its identification with ''Ras al-Ain'' (Lit. Fountain-head), just as its name implies in Hebrew, a place located 6 km. south of Tyre, in the municipality of Batouliyat in south Lebanon, in the District of Tyre (Sour), which, to this very day, is the main source of water for the people of Tyre since Phoenician days. Its artesian wells gush up into stone reservoirs that have been maintained through the ages. One of the reservoirs fed the arched aqueducts of the Roman period that once stretched as far as Tyre. Remains of these aqueducts can be seen along the Roman road running under the monumental arch on the necropolis. Klein's identification of this place is supported by [[Ze'ev Safrai]] (1977, p. 17). [https://archive.org/stream/lagographiedutal00neub#page/22/mode/1up A. Neubauer] (1868), citing [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Robinson]], also identifies it with ''Ras el-Ain'' of southern Lebanon.&lt;/ref&gt; 'Ammon,&lt;ref&gt;Archaeologist, J. Braslawski, conjectured by giving plausible arguments that it is the place now called ''Khurbet Umm el Amud'', ca. 2 km. north of ''Kh.

===Boundary of the Land of Israel in 4th c. BCE===

The following frontier cities once marked the boundary of the Land of Israel, or the extent of places repopulated after the return from Babylonian exile. In a broader sense, the list of frontier towns and villages herein named represent the geographical limits of regulations imposed upon all agricultural produce, making them fully liable to tithing and to sabbatical-year restrictions within that same border, or, in the event of being purchased from the common people of the land, to separate therefrom only the ''[[demai]]''-tithe. As one moved further east of [[Achziv]], the border extended northward, into what are now portions of south [[Lebanon]], and as far east as places in the present-day [[Kingdom of Jordan]]. While the settlements here named reflect a historical reality, bearing heavily on Jewish legal law ([[Halacha]]), they did not always reflect a political reality, insofar that the political borders have since changed owing to a long history of occupiers and conquerors.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Frankel and [[Israel Finkelstein]], ''The Northwest Corner of Eretz-Israel in the Baraita `Boundaries of Eretz-Israel`'', p. 45 (Hebrew). (See: {{cite journal |last=Finkelstein |first=Israel |title='The Northwest Corner of Eretz-Israel' in the Baraita 'Boundaries of Eretz-Israel' |journal=Cathedra: For the History of Eretz Israel and Its Yishuv |volume=27 |issue= |pages=39–46 |jstor=23398920|date=1983}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

The same description of the boundaries of the Land is brought down also in [[Sifre]] on Deuteronomy 11:24 and in [[Tosefta]] (''Shevi'it'' 4:11).&lt;/ref&gt; the wall of Sharoshan Tower [of [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]]],&lt;ref&gt;The Rehob mosaic has inscribed '''חומת מיגדל שרושן'''  (''wall of Sharoshan Tower''), without the words "of Caesarea." The completion of this text is based on a [[conflation]] of the Rehob mosaic with its parallel text found in the [[Tosefta]] (''Shevi'it'' 4:11), which latter places the Sharoshan Tower in Caesarea (חומת מגדל שרשן דקיסרי). Some suggest that this Sharoshan Tower may have actually been the old Hebrew appellation given for the city of Caesarea, or what [[Josephus]] calls "Straton's Tower" (Στράτωνος Πυργὸς) in his ''Antiquities'' (xv.ix.§6). The copyist of the [[Leiden Jerusalem Talmud|Leiden MS.]] of the Jerusalem Talmud (from which text all modern copies of the Jerusalem Talmud were printed), while copying his own manuscript from an older version had at his disposal, seemed to have been unsure about the proper rendering of the word Sharoshan, or else made use of a corrupt text, and wrote in reference to the same place: חומת מגדל שיד ושינה, dividing the word ''Sharoshan'' into two words, ''viz.'' "the wall of the Tower of ''Sīd and Shinah''."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tel Dor|Dor]],&lt;ref&gt;The coastal city of Dora.&lt;/ref&gt; the wall of [[Acre (city)|Akko]], the source of the spring of [[Ga'aton River|Ǧiyāto]]&lt;ref&gt;This place has been identified by archaeologists, Raphael Frankel and [[Israel Finkelstein]], in an article published by them, entitled ''The Northwest Corner of Eretz-Israel in the Baraita `Boundaries of Eretz-Israel`'' (p. 43), and where they describe it as "natural springs issuing from the fountain-head of the riverine-brook called Gaʻaton, being two springs: ''ʻain a-tinah'' and  ''ʻain al-ʻanqalit''." The aforenamed place is situated inland between Achziv and Akko. Today, the [[Tell (archaeology)|mound]] is located to the northwest of the modern-day [[kibbutz]], [[Ga'aton]].

Described by archaeologists, Raphael Frankel and [[Israel Finkelstein]], as the ruin, ''Khurbet Ǧa'thūn'' (Ja'thun), situated ca. 3 miles east of ''el-Kabireh'', now near the present-day site of kibbutz [[Ga'aton]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Kabri| Kabri[tha]]],&lt;ref&gt;The last letters of this word were broken in the Rehob mosaic, but reconstructed by using the parallel text in [[Sifrei]] (on Deuteronomy 11:24). Place identified by archaeologists, Raphael Frankel and [[Israel Finkelstein]], as the village site of [[Al-Kabri]] which, in turn was built to the east of the old ruin [[Tell Kabri]]. Today, a kibbutz by the name of [[Kabri, Israel|Kabri]] is built on the site Al-Kabri. The place, under its variant spelling, ''el-Kabry'', can be seen in the [http://www.iaa-archives.org.il/zoom/zoom.aspx?folder_id=93&amp;type_id=6&amp;id=8366 Palestine Exploration Fund Map] of 1878. [[Samuel Klein (scholar)|Samuel Klein]] (1928), citing G. Dalman (''Palästina Jahrbuch'', pp. 18–19) had formerly identified this place with ''Kh. Kabarsa'', directly north of Akko where Nahariya is now built, but with the discovery of the Rehob mosaic its place has been readjusted (Raphael Frankel and Israel Finkelstein).&lt;/ref&gt; [B]eit Zanitha,&lt;ref&gt;Part of the writing of this toponym was defected in the Rehob mosaic. However, its reconstruction by Jacob Sussmann (1975) is based after its parallel text in [[Sifrei]] (on Deuteronomy 11:24). Archaeologist, Raphael Frankel, identified the town as being what is now a ruin, ''Kh. Zuweinita'', about 5 km. (3.1 miles) northeast of Kabri and shown in the [http://www.iaa-archives.org.il/zoom/zoom.aspx?folder_id=93&amp;type_id=6&amp;id=8366 Palestine Exploration Fund Map] of 1878. (See: Raphael Frankel, ''Bibra — A Forbidden Village in the Territory of Tyre'', [[Israel Exploration Journal]], Vol. 29, No. 3/4 [1979], pp. 194-196).&lt;/ref&gt; the Castle of Galilee,&lt;ref&gt;Text: '''קסטרה רגלילה''' ([[sic]]), but corrected to read '''קסטרה דגלילה'''. Identified by archaeologists, Raphael Frankel and [[Israel Finkelstein]] (ibid.), as ''Khurbet Jalil'' (''Kh. Jelil''). ''Kh. Jelil'' is shown on the [http://www.iaa-archives.org.il/zoom/zoom.aspx?folder_id=93&amp;type_id=6&amp;id=8366 Palestine Exploration Fund Map] of 1878, north of ''Wady el Kûrn''. ''Kh. Jelil'' would have been the first station one encounters as he proceeds northbound across ''Wady el Kûrn''. Today, the ruins are in the vicinity of the new settlements of [[Eilon]] and [[Goren]].&lt;/ref&gt; Quba'ya of Ayata,&lt;ref&gt;The original text reads: '''קובעייה ראייתה''', the genitive case “of” ('''ד''') being mistaken for the letter ''resh'' ('''ר''') by its copyist, but corrected by Jacob Sussmann (1975) to read '''קובעייה דאייתה'''. The Aramaic word '''קובעייה''' (Syriac ܩܘܒܥܝܐ) has the connotation of “hats; habits; hoods; caps” ([[Payne Smith]], ''[[Thesaurus Syriacus]]''), which words when joined together mean “The Hats of Ayta.” The place has been identified by archaeologists, Raphael Frankel and [[Israel Finkelstein]] (ibid.), as being what is now called ''[[Ayta ash Shab]]'' in south Lebanon, ca. 1.5 km. from the Israeli border, and about {{convert|14|km|mi|sp=us}} northeast of Qal'at al-Qurain. [[Adolf Neubauer|Neubauer]] thought this place may have been ''el-Koubéa'' (now [[Qabba'a]]), north of [[Safed]] (see: ''La Géographie du Talmud'',
 [https://archive.org/stream/lagographiedutal00neub#page/15/mode/1up p. 15]).&lt;/ref&gt; Mamṣiya of Yarkhetha, Miltha of Kurayim,&lt;ref&gt;Text: '''מלתה דכוריים'''. Believed by Raphael Frankel and [[Israel Finkelstein]] (ibid.) to be the ruin known as ''Khurbet Kuriyyah'', a place situated to the north of ''[[Ain Ebel|Kafr 'Ain Abil]]'' in south Lebanon.&lt;/ref&gt; Saḥratha of Yatī[r],&lt;ref&gt;Text: '''...סחרתה דיתי'''. The last letter of this proper noun was defected in the Rehob mosaic, but its reconstruction was made by comparing it with parallel texts in [[Sifrei]] on Deuteronomy 11:24, and [[Tosefta]] (Shevi'it 4:11). The Aramaic word '''סחרתה''' (or what is in Syriac ܣܚܪܬܐ), according to Payne Smith's ''Thesaurus Syriacus'', has the meaning of "a walled enclosure; a palace." Together, the sense would be: ''the Walled enclosure of Yatīr''. [[Marcus Jastrow]], in his ''Dictionary of the Targumim'', believes it has the connotation of "environs" – viz. ''the environs of Yatir'' (cf. Ezek. 32:22). In any case, the place has been identified by archaeologists, Raphael Frankel and [[Israel Finkelstein]] (ibid.), as being the village [[Yater|Ya'ṭer]] in [[Jabal Amel]], in south Lebanon.&lt;/ref&gt; [the riveri]ne brook of Baṣāl,&lt;ref&gt;This part of the Rehob mosaic was partly defective, but its reconstruction by Jacob Sussmann (1975), based on a comparison with its parallel text in [[Sifrei]] on Deuteronomy 11:24, reads: נחלה דבצאל. Baṣāl itself has been identified by archaeologists, Raphael Frankel and [[Israel Finkelstein]] (ibid., p. 44) as the riverine brook (Heb. נחל) that is located near a former Lebanese town by the name of Baṣāl. Today, a mountain in southern Lebanon bears the name, Jabal Bâssîl, believed to be a corruption of the former name. The variant forms of spelling for Jabal Bâssîl are: Jebel Bassîl, Jabal Bāşīl, Jabal Bâssîl, Jabal Basil, Jabal Bassil, Jabal Bâssîl, Jabal Bāşīl, Jebel Bassil, Jebel Bassîl. On an 1858 map of southern Lebanon compiled by [[Charles William Meredith van de Velde|C.W.M. van de Velde]], to the west of ''Aitha esh-Shab'', there is a mountain called ''el-Bassal Ajleileh'', directly adjacent to and south of Rameh (Ramah) and east of Terbikhah (see Section 3 in [http://imagebase.ubvu.vu.nl/cdm/compoundobject/collection/krt/id/1288/rec/2# Map]). The riverine brook (''naḥal'') runs from it in a south-easterly direction to the sea.&lt;/ref&gt; Beit 'Ayit,&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Frankel and [[Israel Finkelstein]] (ibid., p. 44) have identified this place with '''Aita az Zutt'' (also known as '''Aita al Jebal'') in south Lebanon.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baraachit|Barashatha]],&lt;ref&gt;Text: '''ברשתה''', a place identified by archaeologists, Raphael Frankel and [[Israel Finkelstein]] (1983, p. 44), as the Lebanese village [[Baraachit]] in [[Jabal Amel]] of South Lebanon; [[F. M. Abel]], ''Géographie de la Palestine'', vol. 1, Paris 1933, p. 309, s.v. ''Meraḥseth'' (French)&lt;/ref&gt; Awali of Battah,&lt;ref&gt;There is often confusion between the Hebrew letters ''daleth'' (ד) and ''resh'' (ר) in the Rehob mosaic. Archaeologist, Fanny Vitto, understood the graphemes of the text here to read with the genetive case "of" = אולי '''ד'''בתה, as in: ''Awali of Battah'', or ''Awali Debattah''), although Frankel and Finkelstein saw the same word as carrying the Hebrew character ''resh'' (ר) and wrote in their essay, אולי רבתה (''the Great Awali'').&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Marjayoun|Gorge of 'Iyyon]],&lt;ref&gt;Text: '''ניקבתה רעיון''', the text corrected to read: '''ניקבתה דעיון''', a place identified by archaeologists, Raphael Frankel and [[Israel Finkelstein]] (ibid., p. 44), as [[Marjayoun]] (Merj 'Ayun). The word '''ניקבתה''', according to the said archaeologists, means "cleft; mountain pass." Cf. Marcus Jastrow's ''Dictionary of the Targumim'', s.v. נקיפתא = ''Hollow of Iyyon''; in Conder and Kitchener's ''The Survey of Western Palestine: Memoir''s, [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp01conduoft#page/96/mode/1up p. 96], they interpret its meaning as the ''Gorge of 'Iyyon''. ''Iyyon'' (Ijon) itself was once a village, but is now a ruin called ''Tell Dibbin'' in the plain called Merj 'Ayyun, between the Upper Jordan and the [[Leontes River]], first mentioned in [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09b15.htm II Kings 15:29] (See [[Mukaddasi|Muḳaddasi]], ''Description of Syria, Including Palestine'', ed. [[Guy Le Strange]], London 1886, p. 95 note 5).&lt;/ref&gt; Massab Sefanḥa,&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Klein (scholar)|Samuel Klein]] wrote in "Das tannaitische Grenzverzeichnis Palästinas" (The Tannaitic Boundary Index of Palastina), in: ''[[HUCA]]'' V (1928), p. 203: "''Sefanta'' ([[sic]]) can only be the ''es-Sefine'' located between [[Hasbaya]] and [[Rashaya]]." Klein, citing Hildesheimer, adds: "That it is 'too far up north' may surprise us, but does not speak in the least against the correctness of the equation."&lt;/ref&gt; the walled city of B[ar-Sa]nnigora,&lt;ref&gt;Text here defected in Rehob mosaic, but its reconstruction by Jacob Sussmann (1975) was based on parallel texts in [[Sifrei]] on Deuteronomy 11:24 and [[Tosefta]] (''Shevi'it'' 4:11). The words "Bar-Sannigora" can effectually be translated as 'The son of Sannigora," a border town between Syria and Palestine ([[Marcus Jastrow]], ''Dictionary of the Targumim'', s.v. '''סניגורה'''), place as of yet unidentified. [[Félix-Marie Abel|F.M. Abel]]  (1933, p. 309), citing Hirsch Hildesheimer, thinks it to be ''[[Nimrod Fortress|Qalaʻat eṣ-Ṣubeibé]]'' (the Castle of Nimrod). The name "Bar-Sannigora" is also mentioned in the description of the northeastern border of the land of Canaan in the ''Targum Yerushlami'' ([[Targum Pseudo-Jonathan]]), on Numbers 34:8, as corresponding with the biblical Zedad: "...the outer reaches of the boundary thereof will be from the two sides reaching as far as to the walled cities of Bar-Za'amah (thought by [[Samuel Klein (scholar)|Klein]] in ''Sefer Ha-Yishuv'', p. 161, to mean "the son of Soëmos," a former governor of a tetrarchy about Libanus) and to the walled cities of Bar-Sannigora, and from the shape of the Rooster (''Turnegol'') as far as Caesarion (''Baniyas''), etc."&lt;/ref&gt; the Upper Rooster of [[Caesarea Philippi|Caesarion]],&lt;ref&gt;Text:  '''תרנגולה עלייה דקיסריון'''; = ''turnegolah 'aliyah de-qesariyon'', a proper noun indicating that anything lying below this place is within the boundary of Israel, but anything lying above it is not. According to John Francis Wilson (''Caesarea Philippi'', p. 76), the place has yet to be identified, but, using his own words, "it is reasonable that the term refers to the hill just behind and east of [[Banias]] where the ruins of the medieval [[Nimrod Fortress|castle of Subaybah]] now stand." The Castle of Subaybah is also known as ''Nimrod Fortress''. [[Félix-Marie Abel|F.M. Abel]]  (1933, p. 309), citing Hirsch Hildesheimer, disputes this view, saying that the walled city of Bar-Sannigora should be identified with ''Qalaʻat eṣ-Ṣubeibé'' (the Castle of Subaybah), but the place known as the "Upper Rooster" should be identified with Saḥītha, a town located between Baniyas and [[Beit Jinn|Beit Ǧenn]] in Hermon. A description of these places is had in the ''Targum Yerushlami'' ([[Targum Pseudo-Jonathan]]), on Numbers 34:8, as corresponding with the biblical Zedad: "...the outer reaches of the boundary thereof will be from the two sides reaching as far as to the walled cities of Bar-Za'amah and to the walled cities of Bar-Sannigora, and from the shape of the Rooster (''Turnegol'') as far as Caesarion (''Baniyas''), etc." According to [[Tosefta]] ''Shevi'it'' 4:11, the Upper Rooster was ''above'' [[Cesarea Philippi|Cesarea-Philippi]].&lt;/ref&gt; Beit Sabal,&lt;ref&gt;The Mosaic text clearly writes "Sa'''b'''al" with the Hebrew letter "bet," and which the copyist of the Aramaic [[Targum Jonathan ben Uzziel]] on Numbers 34:9–10, when describing this region of the country, writes "Beit Sa'''k'''al," the Hebrew "bet" being interchanged with "kaf." According to the Aramaic Targum, this place is associated with the biblical Ḥazar ʿEnan, translated in Aramaic as ''ṭirath ʿenawatha'' ("walled suburb of the springs"), a place in Israel's far northeast as one goes in the direction of Damascus. It was located between the "walled suburb of the springs" (Ḥazar ʿEnan) and Damascus.&lt;/ref&gt; Ḳanat,&lt;ref&gt;Text: '''קנת''', a place mentioned in Numbers 32:42 and which [[Ishtori Haparchi]] in  ''Kaftor Vaferach'' (vol. 2, p. 88 - chapter 11 - in Avraham Ḥavatzelet's 2007 edition) identifies with '''אל-קונייא''' (''el-Quniyye''), possibly [[Ein Qiniyye]], ca. {{convert|3.5|km|mi|sp=us}} southeast of [[Banias]]. According to Hirsch Hildesheimer (1886, p. 50), there was also another place by the name ''Ḳanat'' (=Kanata or Kanatha), located in the middle of Batanea, at the point of today's ruins known as ''Kerak'', in Syria's [[Daraa Governorate]], meaning "fortress," 4 hours east of Edre'at in Wadi Talit. [[Avi-Yonah]] (1949, p. 42) held the view that the reference here is to [[Canatha]] (Qanawat), in Syria, as did Peter Freimark, in his article entitled, ''Zu einigen Ortsnamen im Tosefta - Traktat Schebiit'' (published in: ''Festgabe für Hans Wehr'', ed. Wolfdietrich Fischer), Wiesbaden 1969, p. 9 (German).&lt;/ref&gt; Reḳam,&lt;ref&gt;According to Jacob Sussmann, this was a place in the region of Trachonitis and is not to be confused with the other Rekem, now known as Petra in Arabia. (See: Jacob Sussmann, ''The Boundaries of Eretz-Israel'', Tarbiẕ (Academic Journal), pub. by: Mandel Institute for Jewish Studies, Jerusalem 1976, p. 239).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trachonitis]]&lt;ref&gt;Text: '''טרכון''', the usual designation for a wide area east of the Golan Heights (Gaulonitis).&lt;/ref&gt; [of] Zimra&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Klein (scholar)|Samuel Klein]], in "Das tannaitische Grenzverzeichnis Palaestinas" (The Tannaitic Boundary Index of Palaestina), in: ''[[HUCA]]'' V (1928), p. 206, following [[Sifrei]] on Deut. 11:24 and a manuscript of the Yalkut, corrects this to read: "Trachonitis of Zimra which is in the region of Buṣrah" ('''טרכונא דזימרא דבתחום בוצרא'''). He suggests that the name "Zimra" refers to a Babylonian Jew who was so-called and who, with his family and group of followers, had moved to that region of the country and settled there under the directives of [[Herod the Great]], and were made exempt from paying taxes. Although they initially settled in the toparchy called [[Batanea]] which country is bounded with Trachonitis, they held sway over Trachonitis and protected Herod's subjects there from the brigandage of robbers. Based on this eponym, perhaps due to the benevolent acts of Zimra and his kin who built the country and protected its citizens, the pioneering founder's name was applied to the toparchy of Trachonitis (See: [[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' 17.2.1–3).&lt;/ref&gt; which is in the region of [[Busra al-Harir|Buṣrah]],&lt;ref&gt;Buṣrah is now called ''Busra al-Harir'', a town in southern Syria.&lt;/ref&gt; Yanqah, [[Heshbon|Ḥeshbon]],&lt;ref&gt;Today, the site is a ruin bearing its old namesake, ''Tell Ḥesbān'', located ca. {{convert|9|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} north of [[Madaba]], in the plains east of the Dead Sea.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Wadi Zered|brook of Zered]],&lt;ref&gt;A place mentioned also in the Hebrew Bible (Deuteronomy 2:13; Numbers 21:12, etc.) and being identified with ''Wadi el-Hesa'' (Arabic:'''وادي الحسا'''), a riverine gulch that stretches for ca. 35 miles in [[Jordan]] and empties into the Dead Sea. The first to identify this place as such was [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]], ''Biblical Researches in Palestine'', II, London 1841, p. 555, a view nearly unanimously accepted by scholarship today. Even so, there is still with respect to this place a conflict of opinions, with some holding "the brook of Zered" to be ''Wadi Tarfawiye'' (now ''Wadi Ḥafirah'') in Jordan, and others suggesting that it is ''Wadi Sa'idah'' (David Ben-Gad Hacohen – 1998, pp. 21– ff.).&lt;/ref&gt; Igor Sahadutha,&lt;ref&gt;Text: '''איגר סהדותה'''; Apparently the place mentioned in Genesis 31:47, with a slightly different spelling: '''יְגַר שָׂהֲדוּתָא''', meaning "the Heap of Witness."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beth-nimrah|Nimrin]],&lt;ref&gt;A village that is now a ruin in present-day [[Jordan]], located approximately {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} north of the Dead Sea and {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} east of Jericho.

Identified by [[Eusebius of Caesaria|Eusebius]] (''Onomasticon'') and by Jacob Sussmann as being [[Petra]] in Arabia, the southernmost extent of the boundary of Israel in the 4th century BCE (See: Jacob Sussmann, "The Boundaries of Eretz-Israel", ''Tarbiẕ'' (Academic Journal), pub. by: Mandel Institute for Jewish Studies, Jerusalem 1976, p. 239). Cf. [[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (iv.vii.§1) who names five Madianite kings who formerly governed the region, but by the 1st century CE the place had already come under the possession of the Arabs: "Of these there were five: Ochus and Sures, Robees and Ures, and, the fifth, Rekem; the city which bears his name ranks highest in the land of the Arabs and to this day is called by the whole Arabian nation, after the name of its royal founder, Rekeme: it is the Petra of the Greeks" ([[Loeb Classical Library]]). Others have identified Kadesh-barnea, not with Petra, but with ''Ein el Qudeirāt'', or what is also called ''[[Tell el-Qudeirat|Tell Qudeirāt]]'' near Quseimah in the region of the central [[Negev]], now belonging to Egypt (Ben-David Ben-Gad Hacohen, 1998 - pp. 28–29), arguing that Reḳam (Petra) in Mishnah ''Gittin'' was not considered the Land of Israel, while Reḳam of Ǧayāh is listed as a frontier city of the Land of Israel. (See also Y. Aharoni, "Kadesh-barnea," ''Encyclopaedia Biblica'', 7:39-42; R. Cohen, "Kadesh-Barnea," ''New Encyclopedia of Archaeological Excavation'' 3:843–847).&lt;/ref&gt; the Gardens of [[Ashkelon]]&lt;ref&gt;The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''Shevi'it'' [http://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevi'it.16b?lang=he 6:1]) says that this place of gardens was situated north of the city of Ashkelon, and that Ashkelon itself was considered outside the boundaries of Israel held by those returning from the Babylonian exile.&lt;/ref&gt; and the great road that leads into the desert.&lt;ref&gt;David Ben-Gad Hacohen, in the article ''The Southern Boundary of the Land of Israel in Tannaitic Literature and the Bible'' (1998, p. 25) has suggested that this expanse of territory extended from Ashkelon as far as [[Zoara|Zoar]], on the southeastern shore of the Dead Sea, passing in a southeasterly direction as far as ''Tell Qudeirāt'' before turning eastward toward the [[Akrabbim]] pass and thence to ''Ein Haṣeba'', and continuing northeast to the southern end of the Dead Sea.&lt;/ref&gt; These are the fruits that are prohibited in [[Caesarea Philippi|Paneas]]&lt;ref&gt;Fanny Vitto understood the graphemes of the text to read: '''בפנים''', with some doubt as to the last letter (which could be read as ''mim'' or ''samekh''). However, in the Talmudic discourse about this subject in JT Demai 2:1, it follows that the reference here was to Paneas (Baniyas) (Heb. '''פניס''') a place later called Caesarea Philippi.&lt;/ref&gt; on the sabbatical-year,&lt;ref&gt;Meaning, an Israelite who lives in this frontier city, a city near to Syria in the far northwest of the country, such fruits are to be deemed as coming from Israel proper, rather than from Syria, since these fruits are typically grown in Israel proper and supplied to the border cities ([[Jerusalem Talmud]], ''Demai'' 2:1, ''P'nei Moshe''; p. 17a in ''Oz ve'Hadar'' edition). So long as the like produce is still growing in the Upper Galilee, these fruits may be eaten by him during the sabbatical-year, but he is not permitted to harvest them in their regular fashion. Moreover, once this produce has begun to wither in the fields, the gathered produce of that same species must be discarded from one's house - that is, be eaten forthwith, or burnt or thrown into the sea ([[Maimonides]]).&lt;/ref&gt; but in the remaining years of the seven-year cycle they are tithed entirely as ''[[demai]]''-produce: [[Rice]], [[walnuts]], [[sesame]], [[black-eyed peas]], [and] there are those who also say early ripening [[Damascene plum]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Text: '''אחוניות הבכירות'''. English translation follows the explanation given by [[Moses Margolies]], in his commentary ''P'nei Moshe'' on the Jerusalem Talmud (Demai, ch. 2). [[Immanuel Löw]], in his ''Die Flora der Juden'' (vol. ii, p. 341, and vol. iv, p. 163), brings down two explanations for the word '''אחוניות'''. In one place he says it is a kind of early-ripening dates (which opinion follows that of [[Solomon Sirilio]]), while in another place he says that the sense here is to plums (as explained by [[Moses Margolies]]). It is worthy of noting that [[Al-Mukaddasi]], a 10th century Arab geographer, mentions a certain ''Kâfûrî plum'' which, according to him, was one of seven products found only in Palestine (s.v. ''Description of Syria, including Palestine'', London 1886, p. 71). There was also an early prune grown in Palestine called in Arabic ''at-Tari'', but which could also be found in other lands (ibid.). If the reference here is to such fruits, the same produce was brought into Paneas from places in Israel proper. Cf. Zohar Amar, ''The Contribution of Arabic Sources to the Identification of Types of Plums in Ancient Israel'', Lĕšonénu: A Journal for the Study of the Hebrew Language and Cognate Subjects, Jerusalem 2009, pp. 233–235 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; lo! These are [all] to be treated on the Seventh Year as seventh-year produce,&lt;ref&gt;That is, with respect to their removal when the growing season has ended, and the prohibition of after growths.&lt;/ref&gt; but in the remaining years of the seven-year cycle they are tithed as produce that has certainly been left untithed, and even [had they been brought] from the Upper Rooster&lt;ref&gt;See earlier comment under "the Upper Rooster of Caesarion." According to [[Félix-Marie Abel|F.M. Abel]] (1933, p. 309), the "Upper Rooster" should be identified with ''Saḥītha'', a town located between [[Caesarea Philippi|Baniyas]] and [[Beit Jinn|Beit Ǧenn]] in Hermon.&lt;/ref&gt; and beyond.&lt;ref name="Vitto" /&gt;}}

&lt;small&gt;['''Excursus:''' [[Jose ben Joezer]] of Ẓareda and [[Jose ben Jochanan|Jose ben Yoḥanan]] of Jerusalem decreed defilement in respect of the country of the gentiles (BT, ''Shabbat'' 14b), so that the [[Kohanim|priests]] of Aaron's lineage will not venture beyond the borders of Israel and, in so doing, become defiled unawares by corpse-uncleanness and turn again to defile their offerings (which must needs be eaten by them in a state of ritual purity). Ashkelon was long deemed as one of such cities, as it was settled by gentiles and not conquered by Israel upon their return from the Babylonian exile.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''Shevi'it'' 6:1); p. 44b in the ''Oz ve'Hadar'' edition.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''Shevi'it'' 6:1) relates how that Rabbi [[Phinehas ben Jair]], a priest of Aaron's lineage, and others with him, used to go down into the marketplace of the [[Saracens]] in Ashkelon to buy wheat during the Seventh Year, and return to their own city, and immerse themselves in order to eat their bread ([[Terumah]]) in a state of ritual purity. The Beth-Din of Rabbi [[Ishmael ben Jose|Ishmael, the son of Rabbi Jose]], and Ben HaKapar, when they heard about what Rabbi Phinehas ben Jair had done, a most pious man on all other accounts, but who went down into Ashkelon when it was not permitted for priests to venture outside the Land of Israel, understood thereby that Ashkelon – though not conquered by those returning from the Babylonian exile – was not like other lands of the gentiles, and that defilement had not been decreed upon that city.&lt;ref&gt;Excepting only in specific places, such as in the dwelling place of a gentile, where a gentile has dwelt for at least forty days, in accordance with the [[Mishnah]] (''Ohelot'' 18:7), in which case it was suspected that a foetus was buried in that house and conveys uncleanness (JT, ''Shevi'it'' 6:1, [[Solomon Sirilio]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, taking as an [[exemplum]] the act they heard performed by Rabbi Phinehas ben Jair, they assembled themselves and reverted the old practice, decreeing a state of cleanness over the city's air, and that, henceforth, Jews (including those of the priestly stock) were permitted to go into the city without harboring feelings of guilt or fear of contracting uncleanness. The next day, they assembled themselves again, this time to declare, by a majority vote, that the city's agricultural produce was exempt from tithes – even with such doubtful produce as had been carried into the city from places in Israel proper, unlike the restrictions regarding produce brought into the region of Tyre.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Talmud]] (Shevi'it 6:1); p. 45a in the Oz ve'Hadar edition.&lt;/ref&gt; This was done with the intent of easing the burden of the poor of Israel during the Seventh Year.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], [[Mishne Torah]] (''Hil. Terumot'' 1:5)&lt;/ref&gt;]&lt;/small&gt;

===Caesarea Maritima===
The maritime city of [[Caesarea Maritima]] was an enclave along the Mediterranean coast not immediately settled by Jewish émigrés returning from the Babylonian exile. Later, however, Jews joined the inhabitants of the city, yet, by the 1st century CE, it was still principally settled by foreigners, mostly Grecians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[Wars of the Jews]]'' (ii.xiv.§4; iii.ix.§1)&lt;/ref&gt; To ease the strictures placed upon the poor of the Jewish nation during the Seventh Year (since planting was prohibited throughout that year, and after-growths could not be taken by the people), Rabbi [[Judah HaNasi]] (2nd century CE) found the juridical legitimacy to release the city (and its bounds) from the obligation of tithing locally-grown produce, and from the restrictions associated with Seventh Year produce.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''Demai'' 2:1); p. 16b in the ''Oz ve'Hadar'' edition. Cf. [[Tosefta]] (''Ohelot'' 18:16), which brings down a dispute concerning Caesarea.&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding, on certain fruits and on one commodity spice (see ''infra''.), they still required the separation of the ''[[demai]]'' tithe because of the majority of these specific items being transported into Caesarea from other places of the country held by Israel. However, during the Seventh Year, since these items were usually not harvested or worked by Jews in that year, the majority of such produce were esteemed as such that had been harvested and worked by the gentiles of that place and who are not obligated in the laws of the Seventh Year. This, therefore, made it permissible unto Jews to purchase from them such items.
{{cquote|These fruits are tithed as ''[[demai]]''-produce in [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]]: wheat and [if] bread stuffs the [[Hallah (Talmud)|dough-portion]] is always removed, but as for wine and [olive] oil, dates, rice and cumin, lo! These are permitted during the Seventh Year in Caesarea, but on the remaining years of the seven-year cycle they are mended by separating [only] the ''demai'' tithe. Now there are some who prohibit [eating] white-petal [[grape hyacinth]]s&lt;ref&gt;Text: '''בולבסין הלבנין''', meaning the white-petal grape hyacinth (''Muscari''), of the kind cultivated in Israel, a pleasant flowering plant with bulbous roots that are eaten fresh or pickled after boiling several times (see [[Lampascioni#Cuisine|Method of Preparing]]). The Hebrew word is a Greek loanword, derived from βολβός, an edible bulbous plant described in [[Theophrastus]]' ''Enquiry into Plants''.&lt;/ref&gt; that come from the King's Mountain.&lt;ref&gt;A large tract of country, incorporating all of the hill-country of Judea and viewed as Israel proper since its territory was traditionally settled by Jews at the time of Ezra, known in Hebrew as ''Har ha-Melekh'' (Heb. '''הר המלך'''). The Jerusalem Talmud (''Demai'' 2:1) explains that in Caesarea during the seventh year, the majority of this cultivar of hyacinth was brought there from other regions of the country, and since it is prohibited for a Jew to trade in seventh year produce, the bulbs of this herb are forbidden to buy. On the ''King's Mountain'', see [[Mishnah]] ''Shevi'it'' 9:2.&lt;/ref&gt; Unto which place [is it considered] 'within the parameters' of Caesarea? Unto Ṣuwarnah and the Inn of Ṭabitha and [the Inn of] 'Amuda,&lt;ref&gt;Effectually translated as "the Inn of the Column." Place unidentified.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tel Dor|Dor]] and [[Antipatris|Kefar Saba]],&lt;ref&gt;Text: '''כפר סבה'''. Jewish historian, [[Josephus]], in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (xvi.v.§2 and xiii.xv.§1), says that Kefar Saba was renamed ''Antipatris'' by [[Herod the Great|King Herod]] after his father, Antipater. Under Arab-rule, its name was changed to ''Ras el 'Ain''. Cf. [[Jerusalem Talmud]], ''Demai'' 2:1 (8a). [[Solomon Sirilio]] explains in his commentary on the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (Demai 2:1) that these five places, namely: Ṣuwarnah, the Inn of Ṭabitha, the Inn of 'Amuda, Dor and Kefar Saba, have all the same status as Caesarea, and are permitted, since they were not conquered by Israel upon their return from Babylonia.&lt;/ref&gt; and if there is any place purchased by an Israelite,&lt;ref&gt;That is to say, in the place settled originally by foreigners.&lt;/ref&gt; our masters (i.e. the [[rabbis]]) are apprehensive concerning it [i.e. in what concerns the requirement to separate tithes]. Shalom.&lt;ref name="Vitto" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The conclusion of this treatise, meaning "Peace!" and which archaeologist, Fannie Vitto, speculates may have originally been a letter written to the community in Rehob, outlining for them the laws touching on agricultural produce and tithing, as there were signs of an identical inscription that was inscribed in ink on a plastered wall in the synagogue, but which may have been recopied later and inlaid in the mosaic floor in the foyer of the synagogue. This would explain the mosaic's opening and closing with the words "Shalom."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Addendum: Permitted towns in region of Sebaste===
Between the country of [[Judea]] and the country of [[Galilee]] lies an intermediate stretch of land known as "the strip of the Samaritans."&lt;ref&gt;The enclave inhabited by Samaritans. Cf. Jerusalem Talmud (''Ḥagigah'' 3:4) and Babylonian Talmud (''Ḥagigah'' 25a). These are said to have converted to Judaism in later years, but again ostracized by mainstream Judaism. Still, in what concerns tithes, they were obligated to abide by such laws, although in reality they often neglected its practice. Compare the [[Tosefta]] (''Kelim - Baba Metzia'' 6:10), where it speaks of a Gaba in Samaria, belonging to the Samaritans, saying: "They did not mention the pomegranates of [[al-Badhan|Bāden]] nor the leeks of [[Jaba', Jenin|Jabaʻ]] of the House of the Samaritans (Heb. ''Kūthīm'') except to say that they are tithed as produce [that went] certainly untithed."&lt;/ref&gt; Jews often passed through the region, while ''en route'' from Galilee to Jerusalem during the three annual pilgrimages, and again when returning home.
[[File:Mosaic of Rehob - Israel Museum.jpg|thumb|Mosaic of Rehob, at the Israel Museum, Jerusalem]]
Although the region of Samaria was not seized at the very outset by those Jews returning from the Babylonian exile,&lt;ref&gt;See Itzhaq Hamitovsky (2004, p. 37) who cites [[Megillat Taanit]], where it alleges that the Samaritans would not allow them to do so in the beginning, until at length (on the 25th of the lunar month ''Meraḥšǝwan'') the Returnees from Babylonia went to ''Shomron'' (later called Sebaste) and there settled, building a wall around that place, and later being joined by other Jewish villagers who established yet other towns and who were given the term "grafted cities" (Heb. '''ערי נברכתא''').&lt;/ref&gt; the priests of Aaron's descent were still permitted to pass through their country, without fear of contracting defilement in respect to the country of the gentiles. Nonetheless, with respect to fruits and vegetables had in Samaria, there were some places in Samaria that were exempt from tithes, as if they had been a foreign land.

The [[Jerusalem Talmud]], when speaking about the impropriety of leaving the Land of Israel, describes the standard rule of practice of the time: "Said [[Abbahu|Rabbi Abbahu]]: 'There are hamlets belonging to the [[Samaritans]] wherein it has been customary to permit [a Jew's passage through them], since the days of Joshua, the son of Nun, and they are permitted' (i.e. released from the laws requiring tithing of produce)."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''Shevi'it'' 6:1); p. 46a in the ''Oz ve'Hadar'' edition.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this exemption is explained by Talmudic exegete, [[Solomon Sirilio]], as being that these villages in Samaria and their suburbs had the status of feudal or [[usufruct]] lands given by grant from the State to [[Sharecropper|farm-laborers]] for a share of its increase, while the majority of increase accrued unto the State.&lt;ref&gt;[[Solomon Sirilio]], on Jerusalem Talmud (''Shevi'it'' 6:1) (p. 46a in the ''Oz ve'Hadar'' edition); Itzhaq Hamitovsky, ''Changes and Developments of the Samaritan Settlement in the Land of Israel during the Hellenistic-Roman Period'', Ramat-Gan 2004, p. 43 (Hebrew); Shimon Dar, ''Landscape and Pattern: An Archaeological Survey of Samaria 800 B.C.E.-636 C.E'', Oxford 1986, pp. 257, 259, 261 {{ISBN|0 86054 395 1}}; Shimon Applebaum, ''Judaea in Hellenistic and Roman Times'', E.J. Brill: Leiden 1989, pp. 106–110 {{ISBN|90-04-08821-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was enough to exempt such produce from the requirement of tithing, since the kingdom ([[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] or [[Roman Empire|Roman]], or otherwise) had not forfeited its hold over such lands, and since the Jewish regulations for tithing prescribe that produce or grain that is to be tithed must be the property of its tither, in accordance with Deuteronomy 14:22, "''…you shall tithe all the produce of your seed"'' &amp;ndash; meaning, ''your'' seed, but not the seed belonging to others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Solomon Sirilio]], Jerusalem Talmud (''Shevi'it'' 6:1), s.v. בגין דלא חלטתון מלכותא בידא.&lt;/ref&gt; The following list of towns concerns those hamlets held by the State (kingdom) in the region of [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebaste]] (the biblical city of [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]]) and which were, therefore, exempt from the laws of tithing.&lt;ref&gt;Other villages (here unnamed) are assumed to not have been under the same leniency, as being privately owned and inhabited by either Samaritans or Jews.&lt;/ref&gt; The list is not known from any other source, and is only alluded to in the Jerusalem Talmud.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Sussmann, ''The Inscription in the Synagogue at Rehob'', Qadmoniot: Journal for the Antiquities of Eretz-Israel and Bible Lands, vol.4 (32), 1975, p. 127 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Japanese name|Naitō}}
{{nihongo|'''Naitō Torajirō'''|内藤 虎次郎|extra=August 27, 1866 – June 26, 1934|lead=yes}}, commonly known as  {{nihongo|'''Naitō Konan'''|内藤 湖南}}, was a [[Japan]]ese historian and [[Sinology|Sinologist]]. He was the founder of the Kyoto School of [[historiography]], and along with [[Shiratori Kurakichi]] (the founder of the [[Tokyo School]]), was one of the leading Japanese historians of East Asia in the early twentieth century. His most well-known book is called ''[[Nara (book)|Nara]]''.

== Biography ==
He was born in what is today [[Akita Prefecture]]. He distinguished himself as a journalist. In 1907 he discovered [[Manwen Laodang]] in [[Mukden]]. As an authority of Chinese history, he was invited to [[Kyoto Imperial University]] by [[Kano Kokichi]] in 1907 and got involved in the foundation of the Department of Oriental History.

Naitō's most influential contribution to historiography was the recognition and analysis of the [[Tang-Song transition]] as an important watershed. He argued that the social, political, demographic and economic changes that occurred between the mid-[[Tang Dynasty]] and early [[Song Dynasty]] represented the transition between the medieval (''chūsei'') and early modern (''kinsei'') periods of Chinese history.

In Japanese history, Naitō argued that [[Yamataikoku]] was located in [[Kyūshū]] rather than in [[Kinki]].

'''Ngodo''' is an Igbo community in [[Uturu]], [[Isuikwuato Local Government Area]], [[Abia State]] in [[Nigeria]] which houses a stone age site that provides evidence that humans inhabited the region as far back as 250,000&amp;nbsp;years ago. It was the largest handaxe factory in Nigeria, and possibly in the world.&lt;ref name=Uzukwu1997/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Ikechukwu Joshua Okonkwo, Umuakam kindred, Ngodo&lt;/ref&gt;

The site at NGODO-Uturu, which lies on a [[dolerite]] ridge, was excavated between 1977 and 1981.&lt;ref name=Shaw1999/&gt;
Archaeologists were led to the site by local people who were aware of the unusual artifacts to be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The northern end of the site held a huge accumulation of stone-age artifacts up to 6&amp;nbsp;meters in depth.
There was no pottery and no polished stone tools, but there were triangular preforms for bifacial tools as well as many flakes and some cores.
Handaxes, mostly broken, accounted for four out of five of the tools, and there were also cleavers, picks and sidescrapers. Based on this mix, the site has been classified as [[Acheulean]].
It is possible that these tools were rough or unsuccessful attempts, and the successful tools were carried elsewhere to be refined further.&lt;ref name=Shaw1999/&gt;

There are three layers of occupation. The oldest and lowest holds quartz flakes, small stone tools and points. Above that is a layer with hoe-like tools, polished stone axes, red ochre, bored stone and red pottery.
The top level, with dates between 2935&amp;nbsp;BC and 15&amp;nbsp;AD, held grey pottery wares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7882">'''Oba''' means [[ruler]] in the [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] and [[Bini people|Bini]] languages of contemporary [[West Africa]]. Kings in [[Yorubaland]], a region which is in the modern republics of [[Benin]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Togo]], make use of it as a pre-nominal [[honorific]]. Post-colonial examples of Yoruba bearers include Oba [[Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi|Ogunwusi]] of [[Ile Ife]], Oba Aromolaran of [[Ilesha]] and Oba [[Lamidi Adeyemi III|Adeyemi]] of [[Oyo State|Oyo]]. An example of a Bini bearer is Oba Ewuare II of [[Kingdom of Benin|Benin]].

The title is distinct from that of '''Oloye''', which is used in like fashion by subordinate titleholders in the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] chieftaincy system.

==Aristocratic titles among the Yoruba==

The Yoruba [[chieftaincy]] system can be divided into four separate [[Nobility|ranks]]: royal chiefs, noble chiefs, religious chiefs and common chiefs. The royals are led by the obas, who sit at the apex of the hierarchy and serve as the [[fons honorum]] of the entire system. They are joined in the class of royal chiefs by the titled [[dynast]]s of their royal families. The three other ranks, who traditionally provide the membership of a series of [[privy council]]s, [[sect]]s and [[guild]]s, oversee the day-to-day administration of the Yoruba [[List of Nigerian traditional states|traditional states]] and are led by the [[Ogboni#The Iwarefa|Iwarefa]]s, the [[Babalawo|Araba]]s and the titled [[Elder (administrative title)|elder]]s of the kingdoms' constituent families.

==Oba==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 70.109.2 Beaded Crown Ade of Onijagbo Obasoro Alowolodu Ogoga of Ikere 1890-1928.jpg|thumbnail|Beaded Crown "Ade" of King Onijagbo Obasoro Alowolodu, the Ogoga of Ikere]]
There are two different kinds of Yoruba monarchs: The kings of Yoruba [[clan]]s, which are often simply networks of related towns (For example, the Oba of the [[Egba people|Egba]] bears the title "[[Alake of Egba (title)|Alake of Egbaland]]" because his ancestral seat is the [[Egba Alake|Ake]] quarter of [[Abeokuta]], hence the title Alake, which is Yoruba for ''Man of Ake''. The [[Oyo Kingdom|Oyo]] oba, meanwhile, bears the title "[[Alaafin]]", which means ''Man of the palace'') and the kings of individual Yoruba towns, such as that of [[Iwo, Nigeria|Iwo]] - a town in [[Osun]] State - who bears the title "Olu'wo" (Olu of Iwo, lit. ''Lord of Iwo'').

The first generation towns of the Yoruba homeland, which encompasses large swathes of the said countries of Benin, Nigeria, and Togo, are those with obas who generally wear beaded crowns; the rulers of many of the 'second generation' settlements are also often obas. Those that remain and those of the third generation tend to only be headed by the holders of the title "Baale" (lit. ''Head of the Clan''), who do not wear crowns and who are, at least in theory, the reigning viceroys of people who do.

==Oloye==

All of the subordinate members of the Yoruba aristocracy, both traditional titleholders and honorary ones, use the pre-nominal "Oloye" (lit. ''Owner of a title'', also appearing as "Ijoye") in the way that kings and queens regnant use 'Oba'. It is also often used by princes and princesses in colloquial situations, though the title that is most often ascribed to them officially is "Omoba" (lit. ''Child of a Monarch'', sometimes rendered alternatively as "Omo'ba", "Omooba" and "Omo-Oba"). The wives of kings, princes and chiefs of royal background usually make use of the title "Olori" (the equivalent of ''Princess Consort'', otherwise spelled "Oloori"), though some of the wives of dynastic rulers prefer to be referred to as "Ayaba" (the equivalent of ''Queen Consort''). The wives of the non-royal chiefs, when themselves titleholders in their own right, tend to use the honorific "Iyaloye" (lit. ''Lady who owns a title'') in their capacities as married chieftesses.

==The Oba's crown==
{{Main|Oba's crown}}

The bead-embroidered crown with beaded veil, foremost attribute of the oba, symbolizes the aspirations of a civilization at the highest level of authority. In his seminal article on the topic, Robert F. Thompson writes, "The crown incarnates the intuition of royal ancestral force, the revelation of great moral insight in the person of the king, and the glitter of aesthetic experience."&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Robert F.|title=African art &amp; leadership|year=1972|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison|isbn=0299058204|pages=227–260|editor=Douglas Fraser and Herbert M. Cole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal duties==
[[File:US Navy 060602-N-8637R-010 Commanding Officer USS Barry (DDG 52), Cmdr. Jeffrey Wolstenholme, presents the Oba of Nigeria, with a ship's plaque during the ship's visit.jpg|thumb|June 2006, [[:w:USS Barry (DDG-52)|USS ''Barry'']] (DDG 52), Cmdr. Jeffrey Wolstenholme, presents [[Rilwan Akiolu]], the [[Oba of Lagos]], with a ship's plaque during the ship's visit.]]

The role of the oba has diminished with the coming of [[Colonialism|colonial]] and [[democracy|democratic]] [[institutions]]. However, an event that still has symbolic prestige and capital is that of chieftaincy title-taking and awarding. This dates back to the era of the [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]] warrior chiefs and [[palace]] officials in the medieval period, when powerful individuals of varied ancestries held prominent titles in the [[empire]]. In [[Yorubaland]], like in many other areas of Benin, Nigeria and Togo, chieftaincy titles are mostly given to successful men and women from within a given sub-sectional territory, although it is not unheard of for a person from elsewhere to receive one. The [[title]]s also act as symbolic capital that can be used to gain favour when desired by the individual oba that awarded them, and sometimes vice versa. During any of the traditional [[investiture]] ceremonies for the chiefs-designate, the oba is regarded by the Yoruba as the major center of attention, taking precedence over even the members of the official governments of any of the three countries if they are present. As he leads the procession of nominees into a specially embroidered dais in front of a wider audience of guests and well wishers, festivities of varied sorts occur to the accompaniment of traditional drumming. Emblems are given out according to seniority, and drapery worn by the oba and chiefs are created to be elaborate and also expensive. Most of the activities are covered by the local [[Mass media|media]] and enter the public domain thereafter. Only the secret initiations for traditional chiefs of the highest rank are kept secret from all outsiders. Ceremonies such as this, and the process of selection and maintenance of networks of chiefs, are two of the major sources of power for the contemporary royals of [[West Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Caplan, Humphrey Fisher, David Parkin; The Politics of Cultural Performance. Berghahn Books, 1996, p 30-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Priestly duties==

As a sacred ruler, the oba is traditionally regarded by the Yoruba as the ex officio chief priest of all of the [[Orisha]] sects in his or her domain. Although most of the day-to-day functions of this position are delegated in practice to such figures as the Arabas, certain traditional rites of the Yoruba religion can only be performed by the oba, and it is for this reason that the holders of the title are often thought of as being religious leaders in addition to being politico-ceremonial monarchs.

== Biography ==
Mayr was born in [[Essen]] as son of Otto Mayr and Dorothea (Grunau) Mayr. He obtained his engineering diploma in [[mechanical engineering]] from the [[Technical University of Munich]] in 1956.&lt;ref name="KD 1992"&gt;Horst Kliemann, John C. Dove. ''Who's who in Germany ''. Vol. 1, 1992. p. 1192.&lt;/ref&gt; After his graduation in 1956 he had started career as Research Assistant at the MIT Heat Power Laboratory for a year. Back in Europe he worked at the Swiss industrial engineering and manufacturing firm [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer Ltd.]] for three years. 

In 1960 Mayer returned to the USA, where he worked another two years at the Control Instruments Division of Taylor Instruments Companies in [[Rochester, New York]]. From 1962 to 1965 he was lecturer and later Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]]. In 1964 he had obtained his Master of Science at the [[University of Rochester]].&lt;ref name="KD 1992"/&gt;

In 1965 he returned to Munich, Germany, where he was appointed research assistant at the [[Deutsches Museum]] at its research institute for science and technology history. In 1968 he obtained his PhD from the [[Technical University of Munich]] for a thesis about the early history of the technical regulations.

After his graduation in 1968 Mayr returned to the United States, where he was appointed curator at the National Museum of History and Technology of the Smithsonian Institution, and chairman of the Department of History of Science and Technology. In 1983 he returned to Munich to become general director of the [[Deutsches Museum]], where he served until his retirement in 1992. 

In 1988 Mayr was awarded the first-class merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, and in 1992 he received the [[Leonardo da Vinci Medal]] from the [[Society for the History of Technology]] (SHOT).

In the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY), one of the indictments against Serbian leader [[Slobodan Milošević]] was his use of the Serbian state-run [[mass media]] to create an atmosphere of fear and hatred among Yugoslavia's [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Serbs]] by spreading "exaggerated and false messages of ethnically based attacks by [[Bosniaks|Bosnian Muslims]] and [[Catholic]] [[Croats]] against the Serb people..."

===Milošević's reign and control of media in Serbia===
[[Slobodan Milošević]] began his efforts to gain control over the media in 1986-[[8th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Serbia|87]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/karadzic/bosnia/media.html Frontline: The world's most wanted man: Bosnia: How Yugoslavia's destroyers harnessed the media], ''[[Public Broadcasting Service]]'', 1998&lt;/ref&gt; a process which was complete by the summer of 1991. In 1992 Radio Television Belgrade, together with Radio Television Novi Sad (RTNS) and Radio Television Pristina (RTP) became a part of [[Radio Television of Serbia]], a centralized and closely governed network intended to be a loudspeaker for Milošević's policies. During the 1990s, ''Dnevnik'' (Daily news) was used to glorify the "wise politics of Slobodan Milošević" and to attack "the servants of Western powers and the forces of chaos and despair", i.e., the Serbian [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/62/328.html|title=Serbian state media begins to waver in its support of Milosevic|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Professor Renaud De la Brosse, Senior Lecturer at the [[University of Reims]], a witness called by the ICTY's Office of the Prosecutor, Serbian authorities used media as a weapon in their military campaign. "In Serbia specifically, the use of media for nationalist ends and objectives formed part of a well thought through plan - itself part of a strategy of conquest and affirmation of identity."&lt;ref name="Brosse"&gt;EXPERT REPORT OF RENAUD DE LA BROSSE "Political Propaganda and the Plan to Create 'A State For All Serbs:' Consequences of using media for ultra-nationalist ends" in five parts [http://hague.bard.edu/reports/de_la_brosse_pt1.pdf 1] [http://hague.bard.edu/reports/de_la_brosse_pt2.pdf 2] [http://hague.bard.edu/reports/de_la_brosse_pt3.pdf 3] [http://hague.bard.edu/reports/de_la_brosse_pt4.pdf 4] [http://hague.bard.edu/reports/de_la_brosse_pt5.pdf 5]&lt;/ref&gt; According to de la Bosse, nationalist ideology defined the Serbs partly according to a historical myth, based on the defeat of Serbia by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces at the [[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389 and partly on the [[genocide]] committed against Serbs during the [[Second World War]] at the hands of the Croatian extremists that were governing the [[Independent State of Croatia]]. The Croatian will for independence fed the flames of fear, especially in Serb majority regions of Croatia. According to de la Bosse, the new Serbian identity became one in opposition to the "others" - Croats (collapsed into ''[[Ustashe]]'') and Muslims (collapsed into ''[[Turk (disambiguation)|Turks]]'').&lt;ref name="Brosse"/&gt; Even Croatian democracy was dismissed since ‘[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] came to power in Germany within the framework of a multi-party mechanism but subsequently became a great dictator, aggressor and criminal’&lt;ref&gt;[http://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/ojs/index.php/portal/article/viewFile/90/58 Globalizing the Holocaust: A Jewish ‘useable&lt;!-- (sic) spelling variant matches linked document 20080904 --&gt; past’ in Serbian Nationalism], by David MacDonald, University of Otago&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vreme.com/arhiva_html/431/8.html Politika falsifikata], by Serbian newspaper VREME {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Milošević, until the run up to the [[Kosovo War]], allowed independent print media to publish, their distribution was limited. His methods of controlling the media included creating shortages of paper, interfering with or stopping supplies and equipment, confiscating newspapers for being printed without proper licenses, etc. For publicly owned media, he could dismiss, promote, demote or have journalists publicly condemned. In 1998, he adopted a media law which created a special misdemeanor court to try violations. It had the ability to impose heavy fines and to confiscate property if they were not immediately paid.&lt;ref name="Brosse"/&gt;
According to the report by de la Brosse, the Milošević-controlled media reached more than 3.5 million people every day. Given that and the lack of access to alternative news, de la Brosse states that it is surprising how great the resistance to Milošević's propaganda was among Serbs - evidenced not only in massive demonstrations in Serbia in 1991 and 1996-97 both of which almost toppled the regime, but also widespread draft resistance and desertion from the military.&lt;ref name="Brosse"/&gt;

De la Brosse describes how RTS ([[Radio Television of Serbia]]) portrayed events in [[Dubrovnik]] and [[Sarajevo]]: "The images shown of Dubrovnik came with a commentary accusing those from the West who had taken the film of manipulation and of having had a tire burnt in front of their cameras to make it seem that the city was on fire. As for the shells fired at Sarajevo and the damage caused, for several months it was simply as if it had never happened in the eyes of Serbian television viewers because Belgrade television would show pictures of the city taken months and even years beforehand to deny that it had ever occurred." The Serbian public was fed similar disinformation about Vukovar, according to former Reuters correspondent Daniel Deluce, "Serbian Radio Television created a strange universe in which Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, had never been besieged and in which the devastated Croatian town of [[Vukovar]] had been 'liberated'."&lt;ref name="Brosse"/&gt;

ICTY sentencing judgement for [[Milan Babić]] which has been first president of [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]], a self-proclaimed Serbian dominated entity within Croatia will declare:

{{quotation |Babić made ethnically based inflammatory speeches during public events and in the media that added to the atmosphere of fear and hatred amongst Serbs living in Croatia and convinced them that they could only be safe in a state of their own. Babic stated that during the events, and in particular at the beginning of his political career, he was strongly influenced and misled by [[Serbia]]n [[propaganda]], which repeatedly referred to an imminent threat of genocide by the Croatian regime against the Serbs in Croatia, thus creating an atmosphere of [[hatred]] and fear of the Croats. Ultimately this kind of propaganda led to the unleashing of violence against the Croat population and other non-Serbs.|The ICTY in its judgement against Milan Babić&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/babic/cis/en/cis_babic_en.pdf|title=Milan Babić Verdict - Case Information Sheet|date=March 2006|publisher=International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|accessdate=11 September 2011|location=The Hague}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Željko Kopanja]], the editor of the independent newspaper ''Nezavisne Novine'', was seriously hurt by a car bomb after publishing stories detailing atrocities committed by Serbs against Bosniaks during the Bosnian War. He believed that the bomb was planted by Serbia's security services to stop him from publishing further stories. An [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigation supported his suspicions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/25/world/europe/25iht-bosnia.html | work=The New York Times | first=Nicholas | last=Wood | date=2005-04-26 | title=Balkan states yielding to Hague}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serbian propaganda cases===

===="Pakrac genocide" case====
{{Main|Pakrac clash}}
During the [[Pakrac clash]], Serbian newspaper "[[Večernje Novosti]]" reported that about 40 Serb civilians were killed in [[Pakrac]] on 2 March 1991 by the [[Croatia]]n forces. The story was widely accepted by the public and some ministers in the Serbian government (e.g. Dragutin Zelenović). Attempts to confirm the report in other media from all 7 municipalities with the name Pakrac throughout the former Yugoslavia failed.&lt;ref name="Politika Falsifikata"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vreme.com/arhiva_html/431/8.html#IVC|title=Politika Falsifikata}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Vukovar baby massacre" case====
{{Main|Vukovar massacre|Vukovar children massacre}}
A day before the execution of 264 Croatian [[prisoners of war]] and civilians in the [[Vukovar massacre|Ovčara massacre]], Serbian media reported that 40 Serb [[babies]] had been killed in [[Vukovar]]. Dr. Vesna Bosanac, the head of [[Vukovar]] hospital from which the Croatian POW's and civilians were taken, said she believed the story of slaughtered babies was released intentionally to incite Serb nationalists to [[Capital punishment|execute]] [[Croats]].&lt;ref name="ICTY - Testimony dr.Vesna Bosanac"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/milosevic/trialc/order-e/030117_2.htm#IVC|title=ICTY - Testimony dr.Vesna Bosanac}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Dubrovnik 30,000 Ustaše" case====
{{Main|Siege of Dubrovnik|Ustaše}}
[[File:Pobjeda-ratna-propaganda.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Yugoslav People's Army|JNA]] soldier reads the propaganda of "''[[Pobjeda]]''", in which the newspaper describes [[Ustaše]] hiding behind the walls of [[Dubrovnik]].]]

Before the [[Siege of Dubrovnik]], JNA officers (namely [[Pavle Strugar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/svjedok-strugar-je-lagao-da-30-000-ustasa-napada-boku/181800.aspx|title=Svjedok: Strugar je lagao da 30. 000 ustaša napada Boku|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) made a concerted effort at misrepresenting the military situation on the ground and exaggerated the "threat" of a [[Croatia]]n attack on [[Montenegro]] by "30,000 armed [[Ustaše]] and 7000 [[terrorists]], including [[Kurdistan|Kurdish]] [[Mercenary|mercenaries]]".&lt;ref name ="Pavlovic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pi.library.yorku.ca/ojs/index.php/soi/article/view/8001/7150|title=Reckoning: The 1991 Siege of Dubrovnik and the Consequences of the "War for Peace"|last= Pavlovic |first=Srdja|work= spacesofidentity |issue= Vol 5, No 1 Special Issue: War Crimes|date=2005|issn = 1496-6778| publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This propaganda was widely spread by the state-controlled media of Serbia and Montenegro.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCoLieou2-4 Attack on Dubrovnik: 30 000 Ustasa marsira na Crnu Goru] ("Rat za mir" documentary)&lt;/ref&gt;

In reality, Croatian military forces at the area in September were virtually non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/comexpert/XI-A.htm#VII.C Annex XI.A : The battle of Dubrovnik] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029204025/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/comexpert/XI-A.htm |date=29 October 2013 }}.

Accessed 7 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Croat forces consisted of just one locally conscripted unit, which numbered less than 1,500 men and had no [[tank]]s or [[Heavy machine gun|heavy guns]]. Also, there were no mercenaries, Kurdish or otherwise, on the Croat side.&lt;ref name="Pavlovic" /&gt;

===="Dubrovnik burning tires" case====
{{Main|Siege of Dubrovnik}}
During the [[Siege of Dubrovnik]] in 1991, while the [[Yugoslav Army]] shelled the [[Croatia]]n port town, [[Radio Television of Serbia]] showed [[Dubrovnik]] with columns of smoke claiming that the local people were burning automobile [[tire]]s to simulate the destruction of the city.&lt;ref name="Serbian Media is One-Man Show"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00EFDE133CF933A2575BC0A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all#IVC|title=Serbian Media is One-Man Show | work=The New York Times | first=Jane | last=Perlez | date=10 August 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Fourth Reich" and the "Vatican conspiracy"====
The Belgrade-based media sometimes reported about the alleged conspiracy of ‘foreign forces’ to destroy Yugoslavia. In one instance, TV Belgrade showed Tuđman shaking hands with German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]], accusing them of plotting to impose 'a [[Fourth Reich]]', whereas even the [[Holy See|Vatican]] was blamed for 'supporting secessionists'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/01/magazine/carving-out-a-greater-serbia.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm | title= Carving out a Greater Serbia | author= Stephen Engelberg| publisher=New York Times | date=1 September 1991 | accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, in September 1991, the German and Vatican Embassy were even targets of Serbian protesters, who shouted that ‘[[Pope John Paul II]] supports neo-facism in Croatia’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-09/news/mn-1418_1_yugoslavia-macedonians-croatia | title=Macedonians Voting on Split With Yugoslavia | author= William D.

====Operation Opera Orientalis====
{{Main|Operation Labrador}}
During the notorious [[false flag]] [[Operation Labrador|Operation Opera Orientalis]] conducted in 1991 by the [[Yugoslav Air Force]] intelligence service, the Serbian media repeatedly made false accusations in which [[Croatia]] was connected with [[World War II]], [[Fascism]], [[Nazism]] and [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] with the aim to discredit the Croatian demands for independence in the West.&lt;ref name="ANATOMY OF A BALKAN FRAME-UP"&gt;{{citation|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/doc/321083857.html?FMT=&amp;FMTS=&amp;type=current&amp;date=&amp;author=&amp;pub=&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=|title=Anatomy of a Balkan frame-up|work=Jerusalem Post|last= Tsur|first=Batsheva|date= 3 February 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Affairs In the Army"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scc.rutgers.edu/serbian_digest/44/t44-1.htm#IVC|title=Affairs In the Army}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1992 Tuđman quote about "Croatia Wanting the War"====
The Serbian media emphasized that Croatian president [[Franjo Tuđman]] started the war in Croatia. In order to corroborate that notion, the media repeatedly referenced his speech in Zagreb, on 24 May 1992, claiming that he allegedly said: "''There would not have been a war had Croatia not wanted one''". During their trials at the [[ICTY]], [[Slobodan Milošević]] and [[Milan Martić]] also frequently resorted to Tuđman's quote in order to prove their innocence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/martic/trans/en/060817IT.htm|title=Milan Martic Transcript|date=17 August 2006|publisher=International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|page=6621|accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the ICTY prosecutors obtained the integral tape of his speech and played it in its entirety during Martić's trial on 23 October 2006, proving that Tuđman never said that Croatia "wanted the war".&lt;ref name="Martic transcript 23 October 2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/martic/trans/en/061023IT.htm|title=Milan Martic Transcript|date=23 October 2006|publisher=International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|accessdate=25 September 2011|pages=9913, 9914|quote=Do you see that in fact he does not say, as you claimed, that the war wouldn't have happened had we didn't want it. He does not say that. In fact, what he says, sir, is that they wanted -- they wanted to achieve their goals through peace but that they were ready for war and that they would not give up their goals for an independent Croatia. But he does not say that: "The war would not have happened had we not wanted it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon playing that tape, Borislav Đukić had to admit that Tuđman did not say that.&lt;ref name="Martic transcript 23 October 2006"/&gt; The quote is actually the following: "''Some individuals in the world who were not friends of Croatia claimed that we too were responsible for the war. And I replied to them: Yes, there would not have been a war had we given up our goal to create a sovereign and independent Croatia. We suggested that our goal should be achieved without war, and that the Yugoslav crisis should be resolved by transforming the federation, in which nobody was satisfied, particularly not the Croatian nation, into a union of sovereign countries in which Croatia would be sovereign, with its own army, own money, own diplomacy. They did not accept''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrvatski-vojnik.hr/hrvatski-vojnik/3502011/domovinskirat.asp|title=Lažni citati [Fake quotes]|accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Bosnian mujahideen" case====
{{Main|Bosnian mujahideen#Propaganda}}
Serbian propaganda during the [[Bosnian War]] portrayed the [[Bosniaks|Bosnian Muslims]] as violent extremists and Islamic-fundamentalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slobodnaevropa.org/specials/al_kaida/index.htm|title=AL-KAI'DA U BOSNI I HERCEGOVINI: MIT ILI STVARNA OPASNOST?|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a [[Bosnian Genocide|series of massacres]] of [[Bosniaks]], a few hundred (between 300&lt;ref name="sense-agency.com"&gt;SENSE Tribunal:ICTY - WE FOUGHT WITH THE BH ARMY, BUT NOT UNDER ITS COMMAND [http://www.sense-agency.com/icty/we-fought-with-the-bh-army-but-not-under-its-command.29.html?cat_id=1&amp;news_id=10495]; 9 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Islam, Bosna, Sloveni:Evropska izgubljena bitka "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islam.co.ba/razmisljanja/index.php?subaction=ostalo&amp;id=1070747643|title=Predrag Matvejević analysis|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121208130905/http://www.islam.co.ba/razmisljanja/index.php?subaction=ostalo&amp;id=1070747643|archivedate=8 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,500&lt;ref name="sense-agency.com"/&gt;) [[Arabic]]-speaking mercenaries primarily from the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], called [[Mujahideen]], came into Bosnia in the second half of 1992 with the aim of helping ''their Muslim brothers''.&lt;ref&gt;According to the conclusion in ''Amir Kubura case''&lt;/ref&gt; The Serb media, however, reported a much bigger number of [[Mujahideen]] and presented them as terrorists and a huge threat to [[Europe]]an security&lt;ref name="Islam, Bosna, Sloveni:Evropska izgubljena bitka "/&gt; in order to inflame [[Islamophobia|anti-Muslim]] hatred among Serbs and other Christians.&lt;ref name="ICTY: Milomir Stakić judgement - The media"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/stakic/trialc/judgement/sta-tj030731e.htm#ID2di|title=ICTY: Milomir Stakić judgement - The media}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICTY: Duško Tadić judgement - Greater Serbia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/tadic/trialc2/judgement/tad-tj970507e.htm#_Toc387417236|title=ICTY: Duško Tadić judgement - Greater Serbia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Serbian media created much controversy about alleged war crimes committed by them, no indictment was issued by [[ICTY]] against any of these foreign volunteers.

===="Prijedor monster doctors" case====
{{Main|Prijedor massacre}}
Just before the [[Prijedor massacre]] of Bosniak and Croat civilians, Serb propaganda characterized prominent non-Serbs as [[criminal]]s and [[Extremism|extremists]] who should be punished for their behaviour. Dr. Mirsad Mujadžić, a Bosniak politician, was accused of injecting drugs into Serb women in order to make them incapable of conceiving male children, which in turn contributed to a reduction in the [[birth rate]] among Serbs, and Dr. Željko Sikora, a Croat, referred to as the ''Monster Doctor'', was accused of forcing abortions onto Serbian women if they were pregnant with male children and of castrating the male babies of Serbian parents.&lt;ref name="ICTY: Milomir Stakić judgement - The media"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/sid/190|title=ICTY - TPIY : Ivo Atlija|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in a "Kozarski Vjesnik" article dated 10 June 1992, Dr. Osman Mahmuljin was accused of deliberately having provided incorrect medical care to his Serb colleague Dr. Živko Dukić, who had a heart attack.

Mile Mutić, the director of Kozarski Vjesnik and [[journalist]] Rade Mutić regularly attended meetings of Serb [[politician]]s in order to get informed about the next steps of spreading propaganda.&lt;ref name="ICTY: Milomir Stakić judgement - The media"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ICTY: Duško Tadić judgement - Greater Serbia"/&gt;

====Lions from Pionirska Dolina case====
During the [[Siege of Sarajevo]], Serb propaganda was trying to justify the siege at any cost, and as the result of that effort the Serbian national television showed a report about ''Serb children being given as food for lions in Sarajevo Zoo called [[Pionirska dolina|Pionirska Dolina]] by Muslim extremists''.&lt;ref name="Brosse"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzUqQxNb8qw&amp;e|title=Televizija Srbija (RTS): Srpsku decu bacaju lavovima|date=2 May 2007|work=YouTube|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crovid.com/televizija+srbije+rts+vidovnjaci+velika+srbija/2801/video|title=crovid.com|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kravica as the cause for revenge in Srebrenica====
{{main|Kravica attack (1993)|Kravica execution (1995)|Srebrenica massacre}}
While the [[Srebrenica]] enclave was under siege by the Army of the Republika Srpska, its commander [[Naser Orić]] led several attacks around the nearby Serb held villages, many of which were Muslim villages prior to conflict overtaken by Serbian forces during the first months of the siege. Orić was later even indicted by the [[ICTY]]. In his judgment, it was established that the regular Bosnian troops in Srebrenica were often unable to restrain the large groups of starving civilians who took part in the attacks to get food from Serbian villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Human Rights Watch | title= Oric's Two Years| url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2006/07/11/orics-two-years | date=12 July 2006| accessdate= 9 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, these attacks were described by some Serb media as the main trigger for the Serb attack on Srebrenica in 1995. A TV presenter in [[Pale, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Pale]] told 'Srebrenica was liberated from terrorists' and that 'the offensive took place after the Muslim side attacked the Serb villages outside the Srebrenica protected zone'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.bim.ba/en/226/10/29364/ | publisher=Birn| author= Balkan Insight | title= Hague Recognises Propaganda's Role in Srebrenica Genocide | accessdate =9 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propaganda as part of the indictment at ICTY===

====Propaganda as part of the indictment against Milošević====

Two members of the Federal Security Service (KOG) testified for the Prosecution in Milosevic's trial about their involvement in Milošević's propaganda campaign. [[Slobodan Lazarević]] revealed alleged KOG [[clandestine operation|clandestine]] activities designed to undermine the peace process, including mining a soccer field, a water tower and the reopened railway between Zagreb and Belgrade. These actions were blamed on Croats. Mustafa Candić, one of four assistant chiefs of KOG, described the use of technology to fabricate conversations, making it sound as if Croat authorities were telling Croats in Serbia to leave for an ethnically pure Croatia. The conversation was broadcast following a Serb attack on Croatians living in Serbia, forcing them to flee. He testified to another instance of [[disinformation]] involving a television broadcast of corpses, described as Serb civilians killed by Croats. Candić testified that he believed they were in fact the bodies of Croats killed by Serbs, though this statement has not been verified. He also corroborated the existence of [[Operation Opera Orientalis|Operations Opera and Labrador]].&lt;ref name="Brosse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Candic"&gt;[http://www.borrull.org/e/noticia.php?id=11236 Yugoslav Army's Central Intelligence Unit: Clandestine Operations Foment War] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235029/http://www.borrull.org/e/noticia.php?id=11236 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.icty.org/x/cases/slobodan_milosevic/trans/en/021111ED.htm | title = Transcript pages 12732-12848 | work = Slobodan Milosevic Trial | publisher = ICTY | date = 2002-11-11 | accessdate = 2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Overthrow of Slobodan Milošević|Milošević's government was overthrown]] in October 2000, RTS was a primary target of demonstrators. After attacking the Parliament, the demonstrators headed for the RTS building.&lt;ref name="Brosse"/&gt;

====Serbian State TV Apology====
On 23 May 2011, Radio Television of Serbia (RTS) issued an official apology for the way their programming was misused for spreading propaganda and discrediting political opponents in the 1990s, and for the fact that their programming had "hurt the feelings, moral integrity and dignity of the citizens of Serbia, humanist-oriented intellectuals, members of the political opposition, critically minded journalists, certain minorities in Serbia, minority religious groups in Serbia, as well as certain neighbouring peoples and states."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/sr/story/125/Dru%C5%A1tvo/896794/Programska+izjava+UO+RTS.html|title=RTS Apology|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=24&amp;nav_id=74507 | publisher= B92 | author= Tanjug | title= State broadcaster "sorry" for 1990s | date= 24 May 2011 | accessdate= 10 July 2012 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725235923/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=24&amp;nav_id=74507 | archivedate= 25 July 2011 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Croatian media==
[[File:Evstafiev-bosnia-travnik-girl-doll-refugee.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Refugee]]s in [[Travnik]], a town in the Lašva Valley, 1992-1993. Photo by [[Mikhail Evstafiev]]]]
The [[Croats]] also used propaganda against [[Serbs]] and against [[Bosniaks]] during the 1992-1994 [[Croat–Bosniak War|Croat-Bosniak War]], which was part of the larger [[Bosnian War]]. In its 1993 report, the [[OHCHR]] warned that a major Croatian TV media was under the government control and that the state of the media was a one of "prevailing climate of national and religious hatred which is often encouraged through [[misinformation]], [[censorship]] and [[indoctrination]]". During the [[Croat-Bosniak conflict]], the Croatian media called Bosnian Muslims "aggressors". A report by ''[[Vjesnik]]'' alleging that 35 Croats were hanged near the Catholic church in [[Zenica]] on 9 August 1993 was later proven to be false.{{Sfn|OHCHR|1993|p=19—20}}

During the [[Lašva Valley ethnic cleansing]], Croat forces seized the television broadcasting stations (for example at Skradno) and created their own local radio and television to broadcast propaganda. In the same incident, they seized the public institutions, raised the Croatian flag over public institution buildings, and imposed the Croatian Dinar as the unit of currency. During this time, [[Busovača]]'s Bosniaks were forced to sign an act of allegiance to the Croat authorities and fell victim to numerous attacks on shops and businesses and, gradually, left the area out of fear that they would be the victims of mass crimes.&lt;ref name="ICTY: Blaškić verdict&amp;nbsp;— A. The Lasva Valley: May 1992&amp;nbsp;– January 1993 - b) The municipality of Busovača"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/blaskic/trialc1/judgement/bla-tj000303e-3.htm#IIIA1b|title=ICTY: Blaškić verdict&amp;nbsp;— A. The Lasva Valley: May 1992&amp;nbsp;– January 1993 - b) The municipality of Busovača}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ICTY Trial Chambers in the ''Blaškić case'', Croat authorities created a [[radio station]] in [[Kiseljak]] to broadcast nationalist propaganda.&lt;ref name="ICTY: Blaškić verdict&amp;nbsp;— A. The Lasva Valley: May 1992&amp;nbsp;– January 1993 - c) The municipality of Kiseljak"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/blaskic/trialc1/judgement/bla-tj000303e-3.htm#IIIA1c|title=ICTY: Blaškić verdict&amp;nbsp;— A. The Lasva Valley: May 1992&amp;nbsp;– January 1993 - c) The municipality of Kiseljak}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar pattern was applied in [[Mostar]] and [[Gornji Vakuf]] (where the [[Croat]]s created a radio station called ''Radio Uskoplje'').&lt;ref name="ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict&amp;nbsp;— IV. Attacks on towns and villages: killings - 2. The Conflict in Gornji Vakuf"&gt;{{cite web|url=

Local propaganda efforts in parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina controlled by the Croats, were supported by Croatian daily newspapers such as [[Večernji List]] and [[Croatian Radiotelevision|Croatian Radio-Television]], especially by controversial reporters [[Dijana Čuljak]] and [[Smiljko Šagolj]] who are still blamed by the families of Bosniak victims in the ''[[Vranica Case]]'' for inciting the massacre of Bosnian POWs in Mostar, when broadcasting a report about alleged terrorists arrested by Croats who victimized Croat civilians. The bodies of the Bosnian POWs were later found in a Goranci mass grave. Croatian Radio-Television presented the Croat attack on Mostar, as a Bosnian Muslim attack on Croats who were aligned with the Serbs. According to the ICTY, in the early hours of 9 May 1993, the [[Croatian Defence Council]] (HVO) attacked Mostar using artillery, mortars, heavy weapons and small arms. The HVO controlled all roads leading into Mostar and international organisations were denied access. Radio Mostar announced that all Bosniaks should hang out a white flag from their windows. The HVO attack was well prepared and planned.&lt;ref name="ICTY: Naletilić and Martinović verdict"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/naletilic/trialc/judgement/nal-tj030331-1.htm#IIB2|title=ICTY: Naletilić and Martinović verdict&amp;nbsp;— Mostar attack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[ICTY]] trials against Croat war leaders, many Croatian journalists participated as the defence witnesses trying to relativise war crimes committed by Croatian troops against non-Croat civilians (Bosniaks in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbs in Croatia). During the trial against General [[Tihomir Blaškić]] (later convicted of war crimes), [[Ivica Mlivončić]], Croatian columnist in [[Slobodna Dalmacija]], tried to defend the General by presenting a number of claims in his book ''Zločin s Pečatom'' about the alleged ''genocide against Croats'' (most of it unproven or false), which was considered by the Trial Chambers as irrelevant for the case. After the conviction, he continued to write in ''Slobodna Dalmacija'' against the ICTY presenting it ''as the court against Croats'', with chauvinistic claims that the ICTY cannot be unbiassed because ''it is financed by [[Saudi Arabia]] (i.e. [[Muslims]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Slobodna Dalmacija&amp;nbsp;— NAJVEĆI DONATOR HAAŠKOG SUDA JE&amp;nbsp;— SAUDIJSKA ARABIJA [http://www.hsp1861.hr/vijesti1/011228im.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aimpress.ch/dyn/pubs/archive/data/200110/11005-004-pubs-zag.htm|title=2001/10/05 12:12 Izlog izdavačkog smeća|date=5 October 2001|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bosnian media==
In "Intelligence and the war in Bosnia, 1992-1995", Cees Wiebes writes that US intelligence had "exposed many media reports from Sarajevo as little more than Bosnian propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;Cees Wiebes, Intelligence and the war in Bosnia, 1992-1995, LIT Verlag, 2003. (p. 65)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1995 book ''"Selling the Bosnian Myth to America: Buyer Beware"'', John E. Sray claimed that the media played up the "Good Guy, Bad Guy" dichotomy between the [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serbs]] and [[Bosniaks|Bosnian Muslims]], and ignored or played-down massacres committed by Muslims against Serbs: "Much of the media has become so engrossed in platitudes and their own self-fulfilling prophecies that Bosnian propaganda is now widely accepted as an article of faith, and journalists have abrogated their responsibility to verify their information."&lt;ref&gt;LTC John E. Sray, "Selling the Bosnian Myth to America: Buyer Beware", FMSO, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Bosnian newspaper, Dani, an article shortly after the war began contributed every war in the region since the [[Treaty of Ghent]] to "the Serbs".  Later in the war, the newspaper called on every Bosnian Muslim to name one Serb and then to kill that person.

Most of Bosniak politicians were inflating the numbers of Bosniaks killed in order to gain the sympathies of the west. [[Haris Silajdžić]], Bosnian Foreign Minister, claimed that there were 128,444 Bosniaks killed by December 1992.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/23/magazine/the-bosnian-calculation.html?pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary inline|date=April 2018}}
However, after the war the total number of deaths in the three-and-a-half of years of the war from all sides is estimated to be around 100,000.

Silajdžić also claimed that from April to December 1992 60,000 instances of rape against Bosniak women committed by Serbs. [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] estimates the total number to be around 20,000 from all three sides during the whole war.&lt;ref&gt;http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-XML2HTML-en.asp?fileid=17741&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls''''' is a book was written by [[Lawrence Schiffman]], published in 1994 by Doubleday, as part of the Anchor Research Library. The book's aim was to explain the true meaning of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] for [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]. Previous to the publication of the book, many exaggerated and irresponsible claims about the scrolls were published. ''Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls'' "sets before the public the real Dead Sea Scrolls."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Schiffman, ''Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls'', p.xiii-xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also sets forth the author's theory that the Dead Sea Scrolls were gathered at [[Qumran]] by a sect which left [[Jerusalem]] in the aftermath of the [[Maccabean Revolt]]. When the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean rulers]] accepted the rulings of the [[Pharisees]], these [[Sadducees]] took up residence in the Judean desert.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Schiffman, ''Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls'', p.xxii&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Alexander Hamilton.jpg|thumb|right|[[portrait]] of Alexander Hamilton , [[John Trumbull]], 1792]]

The '''Report on the Subject of Manufactures''', generally referred to by its shortened title '''Report on Manufactures''', is the third major report, and ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', of [[Founding Fathers of the United States|American founding father]] and first [[U.S. Treasury Secretary]] [[Alexander Hamilton]]. It was presented to [[United States Congress|Congress]] on December 5, 1791.

It laid forth economic principles rooted in both the [[mercantilism|Mercantilist]] system of [[Elizabeth I]]'s England and the practices of [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] of France. The principal ideas of the Report would later be incorporated into the "[[American System (economic plan)|American System]]" program by Senator [[Henry Clay]] of Kentucky and his [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. [[Abraham Lincoln]], who called himself a "Henry Clay tariff Whig" during his early years, would later make the principles cornerstones, together with opposition to the institution and expansion of [[slavery]], of the fledgling [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].

Hamilton's ideas formed the basis for the [[American School (economics)|''American School'' of economics]].

==Economic plan==
Hamilton reasoned that to secure American independence, the United States needed to have a sound policy of encouraging the growth of manufacturing and ensure its future as a permanent feature of the economic system of the nation. He argued these could be achieved through bounties or [[subsidies]] to industry, regulation of [[trade]] with moderate [[tariff]]s (not intended to discourage imports but to raise revenue to support American manufacturing through subsidy), and other government encouragement. These policies would not only promote the growth of manufacturing but provide diversified employment opportunities and promoted [[immigration]] into the young [[United States]]. They would also expand the applications of [[technology]] and [[science]] for all quarters of the economy, including [[agriculture]].

===Tariffs===
{{See also|List of tariffs in the United States|Tariffs in United States history|Protectionism in the United States}}
Hamilton reasoned that tariffs issued in moderation would raise revenue to fund the nation. The tariff could also be used to encourage domestic (or national) manufacturing and growth of the economy by applying the funds raised in part towards subsidies (called bounties in his time) to manufacturers. Hamilton sought to use the tariff to:

* Protect infant American industry for a short term until it could compete
* Raise revenue to pay the expenses of government
* Raise revenue to directly support manufacturing through bounties (subsidies)

===Industrial subsidies===
Hamilton reasoned that bounties ([[subsidies]]) to industry, which would rely on funds raised by moderate tariffs, would be the best means of growing manufacturing without decreasing supply or increasing prices of goods. Such encouragement through direct support would make American enterprise competitive and independent along with the nation as a whole. In part subsidies would be used to:

* Encourage the spirit of enterprise, innovation, and invention within the nation
* Support [[internal improvements]], including roads and canals to increase and encourage domestic commerce
* Grow the infant United States into a manufacturing power independent of control by foreign powers through reliance on their goods for domestic and especially defense supplies

==Adoption by Congress==
Though Congress refused to accept Hamilton's proposals in 1791, due to opposition from James Madison and his supporters, much of Hamilton's third report would later be adopted by the [[United States Congress]] despite continued opposition to the support of industry through subsidy. Both sides agreed that manufacturing independence was desirable and necessary but disagreed on how to obtain it. The [[Thomas Jefferson|Jeffersonian]] [[Democratic-Republican Party]]'s main objection to subsidy was their fear that subsidy would lead to corruption and favoritism of certain sections of the new nation over others; namely the north over the agrarian south. This divide (north vs. south) would come up again and again in issues of economic policy until the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]].

It is often thought that Hamilton's report was completely ignored, but in fact "Hamilton worked to ensure that Congress enacted virtually every tariff recommendation in the report within five months of its delivery."{{sfn|Irwin|2004|pp=801–2. "Although the report is often associated with protectionist trade policies, Hamilton's proposed tariffs were quite modest, particularly in light of later experience [i.e. compared to import duties of the nineteenth century]" }} Hamilton's revenue-based trade policy, with its more moderate tariffs, meant that, by 1794, manufacturers had switched their support from the Federalists to the Republicans.{{sfn|Nelson|1979|p=977. "By the end of 1793 Hamilton's pro-importer political economy was driving manufacturers from Boston to Charleston into opposition to the Federalists" }}

==Opposition to the Report==
Leading opponents of Alexander Hamilton's economic plan included [[Thomas Jefferson]] (until later years) and [[James Madison]], who were opposed to the use of subsidy to industry along with most of their fledgling [[Democratic-Republican Party]]. Instead of bounties they reasoned in favor of high tariffs and restrictions on imports to increase manufacturing; which was favored by the manufacturers themselves who desired protection of their home market.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Although the Jeffersonian stance originally favored an "agrarian" economy of farmers, this changed over time to encompass many of Hamilton's original ideas,{{sfn|Irwin|2004|pp=819–20. "The tumultuous experience of dealing with British trade policies after independence had transformed Jefferson from someone who had written in 1785 that farmers were 'the chosen people of God' and had pleaded 'let our workshops remain in Europe' to conceding in 1816 that 'we must now place the manufacturer by the side of the agriculturalist.' 'Within the thirty years that have elapsed, how are circumstances changed!' Jefferson wrote. "[E]xperience has taught me that manufactures are now as necessary to our independence as to our comfort" }} while "the Madison administration helped give rise to the first truly protectionist tariff in U.S. history."{{sfn|Irwin|2004|p=819}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5794">{{Scotism}}

'''Scotistic realism''' (also '''Scotist realism''' or '''Scotist formalism''') is the [[Scotist]] position on the [[problem of universals]]. It is a form of [[moderate realism]].

The "problem of universals", which was an ancient problem in [[metaphysics]] about whether [[universals]] exist. For [[John Duns Scotus]], a [[Franciscan]] [[philosopher]], [[theologian]] and [[Catholic priest]], universals such as "greenness" and "goodness" exist in reality. This is opposed to the later [[conceptualism]] of [[William of Ockham]], and the earlier views of [[Abelard]] and others, which say universals exist only within the mind and have no external or substantial reality.&lt;ref&gt;"conceptualism" in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy''. Simon Blackburn. Oxford University Press, 1996. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. 8 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spade 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==In scholasticism==

The problem of universals existed as early as [[Plato]], who taught the [[Theory of Forms]], that universal "forms" existed. This opinion was rejected by many later thinkers, such as [[Peter Abelard]], who instead argued that forms are merely mental constructs.&lt;ref&gt; Abelard:Logica Ingredientibus (Glosses on Porphyry)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:De Fantis - Opus Oxoniense - 4324737.tif|thumb|[[Antonio De Fantis]], ''Opus Oxoniense'']]
Scotus denied these claims; in his ''[[Opus Oxoniense]]'' he argued that universals have a real and substantial existence.&lt;ref&gt;Opus Oxoniense II. D3, 1-6, 1-212&lt;/ref&gt; For Scotus, the problem of universals was closely tied to that of [[individuation]], by identifying what makes a particular thing this or that particular thing; we could also come to understand if any form of universal exists, it is in this work that Scotus introduces the word "[[haecceity]]", which means the "thisness" of a particular object – what makes it what it is.

{{Quotation|I say then that the main reason for the likening or similarity is the form itself shared between the generator and the generated, not according to individual unity and identity insofar as it is "this" form, but according to a lesser unity and identity insofar as it is a form. The reason for generating is in accordance with this. Form also is a more principal reason for the distinction than matter is, because just as the form is more principally that by which something is a composite than the matter is, so it is more principally that by which a composite is one, and consequently not distinguished in itself and yet distinct from everything else|Scotus|Ordinatio II, d. 3, p. 1. q. 6, n. 210 [Scotus, (1950-), 7:412-413; Spade (1994), 69]}}

In this, Scotus argues that form is a better means of individuating a particular object; because according to him the form of an object as a composite is the best manner of making objects distinct from one another, rather than the matter of the object. This is at the heart of Scotist realism, particularly at the theories of haecceity and [[formal distinction]]. Scotus also argues, against [[Aquinas]] and others, that there is no distinction between the [[essence]] of a thing and its [[existence]].&lt;ref&gt;Opus Oxoniense I iii 1-2, &lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation of C. S. Peirce==

The American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] was quite influenced by Scotus. Here is a statement of Peirce's interpretation of Scotistic Realism by [[T. A. Goudge]]:

The gist of that 'subtle and difficult' doctrine is taken by Peirce to be as follows.  Apart from thought, only singular things exist.  But there are in singulars certain 'natures,' themselves neither universal nor particular, which constitute the ground of intelligibility.  In things, these natures are particular; when brought into relation with an act of the intellect, they are universal ... Thus, for example, the directly experienced hard surface of a particular stone is determinate, whereas the universal hardness which the intellect grasps is indeterminate or general.  A consequence of this view is that the individual per se is not a proper object of knowledge.  What we know are genera and species, themselves the product of mental action.  Yet because complete being embraces both universality and particularity, because man perceives the singular with his senses while cognizing the universal with his intellect, it is possible for him to attain to the singular by relating universals to something which is ''this.''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Goudge, The Thought of C. S. Peirce (Dover 1969), p. 99.  &lt;/ref&gt;

Peirce interprets Scotus's idea of individuation or '''haecceity''' (thisness) in terms of his own category of "secondness." When we think of ''this,'' we are relating our pointing finger, for example, or a particular sense organ with another individual thing. As Scotus said, "nothing is ''this'' in itself." It is so only in relation to something else. Goudge goes on to give Peirce's argument for the objectivity of universals: 

The objection may be raised that such a view destroys the reality of the universal by making it depend on a relation to thought.  Peirce replies that this objection springs from the belief that the real must be wholly independent of reflective activity, i.e., must be a thing in itself.  But the notion of the thing in itself is self-contradictory, for it requires us to think about what is per definitionem out of relation to thought.  We can have no conception of any incognizable reality ... Indeed, “a realist is simply one who knows no more recondite reality than that which is represented in a true representation.”&lt;ref&gt;Charles S. Peirce, Collected papers 5.312.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sigurður Gylfi Magnússon''' (born August 29, 1957) is an [[Iceland]]ic [[historian]] specialising in [[microhistory]]. He has been an [[independent scholar]] for most of his career. He established the Center for Microhistorical Research (http://www.akademia.is/sigm/) at the Reykjavík Academy (http://www.akademia.is/index.php/en) in 2003. He currently holds a research position at the [[National Museum of Iceland]] (http://www.natmus.is/english) named after Dr. [[Kristján Eldjárn]], the former president of Iceland and an archaeologist. The following text is based on his book The History War: Essays and Narrative on Ideology (Reykjavik, The Center for Microhistorical Research, 2007) (http://www.akademia.is/sigm/sogustrid.html), which is [[Autobiography|autobiographical]] in nature and deals with [[Historiography|historiographical]] issues such as the development of ideas which are part of the microhistorical agenda.  Magnússon is the author of 16 books (http://www.akademia.is/sigm/publications.html) and has been involved in the publication of nine more through a book series which he has co-edited. His latest book, titled Wasteland with Words. A social history of Iceland (http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk/book.html?id=412) was published in 2010 by [[Reaktion Books]] (http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk/) in [[England]].

== Biography ==
Sigurður Gylfi Magnússon was born in the West End of [[Reykjavík]]. He completed his B.A. in history and philosophy in 1984 from [[University of Iceland]] (http://www.hi.is/en/introduction). His thesis was published year later in a book called, The Mode of Living in Iceland, 1930–1940, by the Institute of History at the University of Iceland (http://www.akademia.is/sigm/lifshaettir.html). That same year he started his doctoral studies in [[Pittsburgh]], [[United States|USA]], at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in history where he received a M.A. degree in 1988 and a doctoral degree (Ph.D.) in 1993. His dissertation dealt with [[popular culture]] and is titled The Continuity of Everyday Life: Popular Culture in Iceland 1850–1940 (http://www.akademia.is/sigm/dissertation.html).

Magnússon has taught part-time at the University of Iceland (http://www.akademia.is/sigm/namskeid.html) and in other academic settings in Iceland from 1994 when he returned from the USA. He taught at his former university, Carnegie Mellon, in the spring of 2002 when he was a [[Fulbright Scholar]] for six months. In 1998 he became in the first chair of an independent research institute called The Reykjavik Academy (http://www.akademia.is/), which was founded by independent scholars who received their education in Iceland, [[Scandinavia]], [[Europe]] and USA. The colorful saga of the Reykjavík Academy attracted considerable outside attention, from its humble beginnings as a forum for ten independent scholars to its eventually housing 80 researchers from all areas of the [[humanities]] and [[social science]]s.

In 2003, Magnússon founded and chaired the Center for Microhistorical Research (http://www.akademia.is/sigm/), which, among other things, runs the international web-page microhistory.org (http://www.microhistory.org/) and publishes books on microhistorical issues. He is the editor of the web-journal The Journal of Microhistory (http://www.microhistory.org/journal2006.php) with his co-worker and a long-time friend Dr. Davið Ólafsson (http://www.akademia.is/index.php/en/the-society/society-members/47-d/113-davie-olafsson-).  Magnússon is the founder and one of three editors of the book series Anthology of Icelandic Popular Culture (http://www.akademia.is/index.php/is/utgafa/synisbaekur-islenskrar-altyeu) which has already published 14 books in cooperation with the University of Iceland Press (http://www.haskolautgafan.hi.is/page/hu_utgafan). The other editors are Dr. Már Jónsson (http://notendur.hi.is/marj/), professor at the University of Iceland, and Dr. Davíð Ólafsson, a researcher and independent scholar at the Reykjavik Academy.

It could be argued that the primary objective of many of Magnússon's work has been to present a view of the ways in which [[history]], and in particular social history, has developed in the last 15–20 years, at a time of major reassessment within the academic world manifested in the radical ideas grouped under the banner of [[postmodernism]] and/or [[poststructuralism]]. The History War is based on his former research, which he has published in recent years on first hand sources, microhistory and everyday life. That includes the following books: Dreams of Things Past: Life Writing in Iceland (2004) (http://www.akademia.is/sigm/dreams.html); Metastories: Memory, Recollection, and History (2005) (http://www.akademia.is/sigm/metastories.html); Academic Liturgy. Humanities and the Society of Scholars (2007) (http://www.akademia.is/sigm/liturgy.html), and finally a book, which he co-edited, called From Re-evaluation to Disintegration. Two Final Theses, One Introduction, Three Interviews, Seven Articles, Five Photographs, One Afterword and A Few Obituaries from the Field of Humanities (2006) (http://www.akademia.is/sigm/disintegration.html).

After mostly dealing with the methods of microhistory for over ten years Magnússon turned back to his [[empirical research]] in 2007 with the focus on [[material culture]] and [[everyday life]]. Just recently, his book Wasteland with Words. A Social History of Iceland (2010) (http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk/book.html?id=412), was published by Reaktion books (http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk/) in England (see criticism in The Economist: http://www.economist.com/culture/displaystory.cfm?story_id=16213940&amp;fsrc=rss). The book is written as an attempt to explain how the [[culture of Iceland]] was formed through a long process of literary practice from the beginning of the settlement in the ninth century up to modern times. It is also an analysis of an island culture, which successfully stepped into the twentieth century without losing its [[cultural identity]]. That success story ends with the meltdown of the banking, economic, and the political system in 2008. The focus of the book is on the people of Iceland, how they managed to survive in a relatively hostile environment thorough the centuries and become, for a while, one of the wealthiest countries in the world. The resent sequence of events in 2008 are explained in the light of the historical development in Iceland. This is an experiment in social- and/or microhistorical studies, in which he strives to deal with a long period of time using the methods of microhistory.

'''Tajar Zavalani''' (1903–1966) was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] historian, publicist, and writer. He was mostly known in UK by the name Thomas Henri Zavalani.

==Life==
Zavalani was born on 15 August 1903 in [[Bitola|Monastir]],&lt;ref name="TO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="libohovaonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libohovaonline.com/kryeministrat-shqiptare-qe-i-kane-varret-jashte-mes-tyre-edhe-eqrem-bej-libohova/ |title=libohovaonline.com Kryeministrat shqiptarë që i kanë varret jashtë, mes tyre edhe Eqrem Bej Libohova|author=Roland Qafoku|publisher=libohovaonline.com|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ottoman Empire]], today's Bitola in the [[Republic of Macedonia]], or [[Korça]],&lt;ref name="Elsie"&gt;{{citation| page=487|author=Robert Elsie|title=Historical Dictionary of Albania| edition=2| series=Historical Dictionaries of Europe|volume=75| year=2010| publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.| isbn=978-0-8108-6188-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; today's [[Albania]]. He was the son of Albanian activist and nationalist [[Fehim Zavalani]] and Qerime Frashëri from [[Korçë]].&lt;ref name="TO"/&gt; His father had settled in Monastir, very active within the Albanian patriotic circles of [[Monastir Vilayet]], close cooperator of the [[Kyrias family]], and participant in the [[Congress of Monastir]] (1908) and [[Congress of Dibra]] (1909). The Congress of Monastir was held in a hotel owned by him.
&lt;br&gt;Tajar Zavalani took his first studies in the [[Marist Brothers]] French [[Catholic School]], and after the bombardment of Monastir during [[World War I]] he left for [[Salonica]], where he enlisted in the French [[lyceum]]. He studied [[Literary criticism|studied literature]] there.&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Zavalani came in [[Tirana]] in 1922. He started working for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, initially as a secretary of the Commission for the Border Delimitation headed by [[Ali Pasha Kolonja]]. The commission was part of task-force commissions throughout post-World War I Europe for delimiting disputable border segments, as decided by [[Paris Peace Conference of 1919]].
&lt;br&gt;In [[June Revolution|June 1924]], he took part in the uprising of [[Vlora]] as a member of the "Bashkimi" (Unity) Organization of the recently assassinated [[Avni Rustemi]]. These events led to [[Fan Noli]] and his supporters coming to power. After the return of [[Ahmet Zogu]] in power by December 1924, Zavalani fled to Italy. The [[Soviet]] Union offered to let him study in Russia as a "victim of [[counterrevolution]]". After a year in Moscow, despite his hobby of [[electrotechnics]], he attended the [[Leningrad Communist University|Marxist–Leninist school in Leningrad]]. In the summer of 1929, he returned to Moscow and worked at the [[Moscow Agricultural Institute|Agrarian Institute]], specialising in economics. In November 1930, he managed to get out of Soviet Union with his perception of the [[Soviet Union]] being altered by the [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivisation campaign]]. He settled in [[Berlin]], and soon-after in [[Leysin]], near [[Montreux]] in Switzerland. There he was treated for [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt;
&lt;br&gt;In January 1933, Zavalani returned to Albania, where he was active in the translation of literary works, mostly from Russian and [[French literature]], and as a publicist.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=beRDAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=tajar+zavalani&amp;dq=tajar+zavalani&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Hs6wVJq5BbDbsAS5oIGwBQ&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBjgy| author=Hamit Boriçi| title=Një shekull e gjysmë publicistikë shqiptare (1848–1997)| year=1997|publisher=Enti Botues Poligrafik "Gjergj Fishta"| page=94|oclc=42598494}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other translations was ''[[The Mother (Gorky novel)|The mother]]'', a novel of [[Maxim Gorky|Gorky]] which was banned by the authorities.&lt;ref name="Hoti"/&gt; In 1935 he was Director of State Lyceum in [[Tirana]], later director of "Malet T'ona" College, and chaired Tirana branch of the [[Vllaznija Literary Society]]. Meanwhile, his brother Hysen, who had also settled in the Soviet Union, would be executed by the Soviets due to involvement in some turmoils in [[Saratov]] (1938). From a bearer of the Communist ideas,&lt;ref name="Hoti"&gt;{{citation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4AGzAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=tajar+zavalani&amp;dq=tajar+zavalani&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bcCwVK-bEczCsATjlID4CA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBDgU| pages=189–190|year=1997| location=Prishtina| author=Izber Hoti| title=Italian diplomacy's attitude towards Albania and Albanians (1930–1941)| publisher=Instituti i historisë, Prishtinë| oclc=81960085}}&lt;/ref&gt; he abandoned the Communist movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DV2Fxq_NBdkC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=tajar+zavalani&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YJqwVMzFO-rfsASWnILwDg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=tajar%20zavalani&amp;f=false| page=189| title=East Central Europe: Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow| author=Milorad M.

&lt;br&gt;In 1936, he married Selma Vrioni (1915–1995), also known as Maria Selma, daughter of [[Kahreman Vrioni]] (1889–1955), a rich [[bey]] from [[Fier]] area, and Emine Frashëri (daughter of [[Abdyl Frashëri]]).&lt;ref name="TO"/&gt;
&lt;br&gt;After the [[Italian invasion of Albania|Italian invasion of 1939]], he was interned in northern Italy, from where he escaped with his wife, who was a former [[lady-in-waiting]] to former [[Queen Geraldine]], reaching former [[King Zog]]'s party and settling to England in 1940. In November 1940, he was given a job in the [[BBC]]'s Albanian-language
service. With his friend [[Costa Chekrezi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=guoaAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=tajar+zavalani&amp;dq=tajar+zavalani&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bcCwVK-bEczCsATjlID4CA&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBzgU| title=Faik Konitza: Selected Correspondence| year=2000|page=101|editor=Bejtullah D.

&lt;br&gt;Zavalani worked for BBC for the rest of his life. He was a member of [[English PEN|PEN Club]] and published in its press organ ''Arena'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_JLL32RzrkC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=tajar+zavalani&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qcuwVL2ZMZLIsQTGgIGgCg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBzge#v=onepage&amp;q=tajar%20zavalani&amp;f=false| page=13|title=Columbia Dictionary of Modern European Literature|editor= Jean-Albert Bede, William Edgerton| year=1980|isbn= 978-0231037174|publisher=Columbia University Press|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chairman of [[Assembly of Captive European Nations|ACEN]] branch of London.&lt;ref name="ACEN"/&gt; Zavalani died in an accident in 1966.&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt; His wife engaged as a representative of the [["Free Albania" National Committee]] after his death.&lt;ref name="ACEN"/&gt;

'''Tanfield Valley''', also referred to as Nanook, is an [[archaeological site]] located on the southernmost projection of [[Baffin Island]] in the [[Canada|Canadian]] territory of [[Nunavut]]. It is possible that the site was known to [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Norsemen|Norse explorers]] from [[Greenland]] and [[Iceland]]. It may be in the region of ''[[Helluland]]'', spoken of in the Icelandic [[sagas]] (''[[Greenland Saga]]'' and ''[[Saga of Erik the Red]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Vikings and Native Americans | journal = National Geographic | date = November 2012 | author=Heather Pringle | volume = 221 | issue = 11 | url = http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2012/11/vikings-and-indians/pringle-text | accessdate = January 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hamilton&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.counter-currents.com/2013/02/the-medieval-norse-on-baffin-island/ |title=The Medieval Norse on Baffin Island |publisher=Counter-Currents Publishing |author=Andrew Hamilton

The Helluland Archaeology Project is a research initiative that was set up at the Canadian Museum of Civilization, now the [[Canadian Museum of History]], to investigate [[Patricia Sutherland]]'s theory of an extended Norse presence on Baffin Island with extensive trading with the indigenous [[Dorset people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/archeo/helluland/str0101e.shtml |title= Helluland Archaeology Project |publisher=Canadian Museum of History

Moreau Maxwell (1918-1998), professor and curator of Anthropology at [[Michigan State University]], had previously researched the site in his study of the prehistory of Baffin island, the findings of which were summarized in his publication ''Prehistory of the Eastern Arctic'' (1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=  http://www.saa.org/portals/0/saa/publications/saabulletin/16-2/SAA9.html |title=Moreau Sanford Maxwell |journal=Society for American Archaeology Bulletin |volume=16 |issue=2 |author=   William A.

'''Thomas Molineux''' (1759–1850) was an English stenographer and schoolteacher.

==Life==
Born in [[Manchester]] on 14 May 1759, Molineux studied at the school in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] run by [[Henry Clarke (mathematician)|Henry Clarke]]. There he learned [[John Byrom]]'s system of [[shorthand]], and before he was 17 he became a writing-master and teacher of accounts in [[King Edward VI's Grammar School, Macclesfield]].&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Molineux, Thomas|volume=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molineux resigned from the school in 1802, and died in [[Macclesfield]] on 15 November 1850, aged 91.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
Molineux published ''An Abridgement of Mr. Byrom's Universal English Short-hand'', London, 1796; called the second edition, really the first. It is a simplified representation of the Byrom system, with a few alterations. Molineux later brought out other works on the same subject, with engraved copperplates. One of them is partly written in [[epistolary form]]. Popular, they passed through about a dozen editions. Some are entitled ''An Introduction to Byrom's Universal English Short-hand'', and others ''The Short-hand Instructor or Stenographical Copy Book''. The editions of ''The Instructor'' published in 1824 and 1838 have a portrait of Molineux, engraved by [[Robert Cabbell Roffe]] from a painting by Scott.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Molineux was also the author of a short treatise on arithmetic. His letters to Roffe were edited and printed privately in a limited edition, as ''The Grand Master'' (London, 1860).  Roffe was an engraver in London, whom Molineux taught shorthand by correspondence, and who became the author of another modification of the Byrom system.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Cabbell Roffe|author2=Thomas Molineux|author3=Alfred Thomas Roffe|title=The Grand Master. Being Some Extracts from the Shorthand Correspondence of Robert Cabbell Roffe ... with ... Thomas Molineux ...

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Molineux was married and had a daughter, who married John Jackson, vicar of [[Over, Cheshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=18911|first=Page|last=Life|title=Molineux, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''2000'''
**No events.

* '''2001'''
**13 September – Magic launches a spin-off [[Magic (TV channel)|television channel]].
**December – EMAP decides that it is more economical for north of England Magic stations to share off-peak programmes and begins networking with the London station [[Magic 105.4]] between 10am-2pm, and 7pm-6am, although there are local commercial breaks, and local news on the hour. During these hours the station is simply known as Magic.

*'''2002'''
**No events. 

*'''2003'''
**January – Due to a sharp decline in listening, Emap ends the networking of London station [[Magic 105.4]] on the north of England Magic stations and a regional northern network is created with programmes broadcast from [[Magic 1152]] in Newcastle. During networked hours, local adverts are aired, as well as local news on the hour.
**September – 
***Live evening programmes on [[Magic 105.4]] are replaced by automated output. 
***[[Richard Skinner (broadcaster)|Richard Skinner]] leaves. He had been mid-morning presenter for Magic, and its predecessor Melody Radio, since 1997.

**No events. 

*'''2005'''
**12 September – [[Neil Fox (broadcaster)|Neil Fox]] joins Magic 105.4 as the station's breakfast presenter.

* '''2006'''
**July – 
***More networking is introduced across the northern Magic network with only the 4 hour breakfast show presented from the local studios. 
*** [[Dave Lee Travis]] joins to present shows on [[Magic Radio]].

[[File:CMB Timeline300 no WMAP.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|Diagram of Evolution of the universe from the Big Bang (left) to the present]]
This is a timeline of the formation and subsequent evolution of the Universe from the [[Big Bang]] (13.799 ± 0.021 billion years ago) to the present day. 
Times are measured from the moment of the Big Bang.

==The first second==
{{Nature timeline}}

===Planck epoch===
* c. 0 seconds (13.799 ± 0.021 [[Gya]]): [[Planck Epoch]] begins: earliest meaningful time. The Big Bang occurs in which ordinary space and time develop out of a primeval state (possibly a [[virtual particle]] or [[false vacuum]]) described by a [[Quantum gravity|quantum theory of gravity]] or "[[Theory of Everything]]". All matter and energy of the entire visible universe is contained in an unimaginably hot, dense point ([[gravitational singularity]]), a billionth the size of a nuclear particle. This state has been described as a particle [[Desert (particle physics)|desert]]. Other than a few scant details, conjecture dominates discussion about the earliest moments of the universe's history since no effective means of testing this far back in space-time is presently available. WIMPS (weakly interacting massive particles) or [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] may have appeared and been the catalyst for the expansion of the singularity. The infant universe cools as it begins expanding outward. It is almost completely smooth, with quantum variations beginning to cause slight variations in density.

===Grand unification epoch===
* c. 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds: [[Grand unification epoch]] begins: While still at an infinitesimal size, the universe cools down to 10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; [[kelvin]]. [[Gravity]] separates and begins operating on the universe—the remaining fundamental forces stabilize into the [[electronuclear force]], also known as the Grand Unified Force or [[Grand Unified Theory]] (GUT), mediated by (the hypothetical) [[X and Y bosons]] which allow early [[matter]] at this stage to fluctuate between [[baryon]] and [[lepton]] states.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 |author1=Cheng, Ta-Pei |author2=Li, Ling-Fong |year=1983
 |title=Gauge Theory of Elementary Particle Physics
 |page=437
 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]
 |isbn=0-19-851961-3
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electroweak epoch===
*c. 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds: [[Electroweak epoch]] begins: The Universe cools down to 10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; kelvin. As a result, the [[Strong Nuclear Force]] becomes distinct from the [[Electroweak Force]] perhaps fuelling the [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]] of the universe. A wide array of exotic elementary particles result from decay of X and Y bosons which include [[W and Z bosons]] and [[Higgs bosons]].
*c. 10&lt;sup&gt;−33&lt;/sup&gt; seconds: Space is subjected to [[cosmic inflation|inflation]], expanding by a factor of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; over a time of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−33&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds. The universe is [[supercooled]] from about 10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; down to 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; kelvin.&lt;ref&gt;Guth, "Phase transitions in the very early universe", in: Hawking, Gibbon, Siklos (eds.), ''The Very Early Universe'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; 
*c. 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds: Cosmic inflation ends. The familiar [[elementary particle]]s now form as a soup of hot ionized gas called [[quark-gluon plasma]]; hypothetical components of [[Cold dark matter]] (such as [[axion]]s) would also have formed at this time.

===Quarks epoch===
*c. 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds: Electroweak phase transition: the four [[fundamental interaction]]s familiar from the modern universe now operate as distinct forces. The [[Weak nuclear force]] is now a short-range force as it separates from [[Electromagnetic force]], so matter particles can [[Higgs mechanism|acquire mass]] and interact with the [[Higgs Field]]. The temperature is still too high for quarks to coalesce into [[hadron]]s, and the [[quark-gluon plasma]] persists ([[Quark epoch]]). The universe cools to 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; kelvin.
*c. 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; seconds: [[Baryogenesis]] may have taken place with matter gaining the upper hand over anti-matter as [[baryon]] to [[antibaryon]] constituencies are established.

===Hadron epoch===
*c. 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds: [[Hadron epoch]] begins: As the universe cools to about 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; kelvin, a quark-hadron transition takes place in which quarks bind to form more complex particles—[[hadrons]]. This quark confinement includes the formation of [[protons]] and [[neutrons]] ([[nucleons]]), the building blocks of [[atomic nuclei]].

===Lepton Epoch===
*c. 1 second: [[Lepton epoch]] begins: The universe cools to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; kelvin. At this temperature, the hadrons and antihadrons annihilate each other, leaving behind [[leptons]] and [[antileptons]] – possible disappearance of [[antiquarks]]. Gravity governs the expansion of the universe: neutrinos [[Decoupling (cosmology)|decouple]] from matter creating a [[cosmic neutrino background]].

===Photon epoch===
* c. 10 seconds: [[Photon epoch]] begins: Most of the leptons and antileptons annihilate each other. As [[electrons]] and [[positrons]] annihilate, a small number of unmatched electrons are left over – disappearance of the positrons.
* c. 10 seconds: Universe dominated by photons of radiation – ordinary matter particles are coupled to [[light]] and radiation while dark matter particles start building non-linear structures as [[dark matter halo]]s. Because charged electrons and protons hinder the emission of light, the universe becomes a super-hot glowing fog.
* c. 3 minutes: Primordial [[nucleosynthesis]]: [[nuclear fusion]] begins as [[lithium]] and heavy hydrogen ([[deuterium]]) and [[helium]] [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] form from protons and neutrons.
* c. 20 minutes: Nuclear fusion ceases: normal matter consists of 75% hydrogen nuclei and 25% helium nuclei – free electrons begin scattering light.

== [[Matter]] era ==

=== Matter and radiation equivalence ===

*c. 47,000 years (z=3600): Matter and radiation equivalence: at the beginning of this era, the expansion of the universe was decelerating at a faster rate.
*c. 70,000 years:  Matter domination in Universe: onset of gravitational collapse as the [[Jeans length]] at which the smallest structure can form begins to fall.

===Cosmic Dark Age===
[[File:Ilc 9yr moll4096.png|thumb|All-sky map of the [[CMB]], created from nine years of [[WMAP]] data]]

* c. 370,000 years (z=1,100): The "[[Dark Ages (cosmology)|Dark Ages]]" is the period between [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]], when the universe first becomes transparent, until the formation of the first [[star]]s. [[Recombination (cosmology)|Recombination]]: electrons combine with nuclei to form [[atoms]], mostly [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]. Distributions of hydrogen and helium at this time remains constant as the electron-baryon plasma thins. The temperature falls to 3000 kelvin. Ordinary matter particles decouple from radiation. The photons present at the time of decoupling are the same photons that we see in the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) radiation.
* c. 400,000 years: Density waves begin imprinting characteristic [[polarization (waves)]] signals.
* c. 10 million years: With a trace of [[heavy elements]] in the Universe,{{citation needed|reason=|date=May 2017}} the chemistry that later [[Abiogenesis|sparked life]] begins operating.
* c. 10-17 million years: The "Dark Ages" span a period during which the temperature of [[cosmic background radiation]] cooled from some 4000&amp;nbsp;K down to about 60&amp;nbsp;K. The background temperature was between 373&amp;nbsp;K and 273&amp;nbsp;K, allowing the possibility of [[liquid water]], during a period of about 7 million years, from about 10 to 17 million after the Big Bang (redshift 137–100). [[Avi Loeb|Loeb]] (2014) speculated that [[Abiogenesis|primitive life]] might in principle have appeared during this window, which he called "the Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe".&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~loeb/habitable.pdf |date=October 2014 |journal=[[International Journal of Astrobiology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |doi=10.1017/S1473550414000196 |accessdate=15 December 2014 |bibcode=2014IJAsB..13..337L |arxiv = 1312.0613 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARXIV-20131202"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337 |arxiv=1312.0613 |date=2 December 2013|doi=10.1017/S1473550414000196 |bibcode=2014IJAsB..13..337L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141202"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dreifus |first=Claudia |authorlink=Claudia Dreifus |title=Much-Discussed Views That Go Way Back - Avi Loeb Ponders the Early Universe, Nature and Life |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/science/avi-loeb-ponders-the-early-universe-nature-and-life.html |date=2 December 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=3 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* c. 100 million years: Gravitational collapse: ordinary matter particles fall into the structures created by dark matter. [[Reionization]] begins: smaller ([[stars]]) and larger non-linear structures ([[quasars]]) begin to take shape – their [[ultraviolet]] light ionizes remaining neutral gas.
* 200–300 million years: First stars begin to shine: Because many are [[Population III stars]] (some [[Population II stars]] are accounted for at this time) they are much bigger and hotter and their life-cycle is fairly short. Unlike later generations of stars, these stars are metal free. As reionization intensifies, photons of light scatter off free protons and electrons – Universe becomes opaque again.
* 200 million years: [[HD 140283]], the "Methuselah" Star, formed, the unconfirmed oldest star observed in the Universe. Because it is a [[Population II star]], some suggestions have been raised that second generation star formation may have begun very early on.&lt;ref name=nature&gt;

* 300 million years: First large-scale astronomical objects, protogalaxies and [[quasars]] may have begun forming. As Population III stars continue to burn, [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] operates – stars burn mainly by fusing hydrogen to produce more helium in what is referred to as the [[main sequence]]. Over time these stars are forced to fuse helium to produce [[carbon]], [[oxygen]], [[silicon]] and other heavy elements up to [[iron]] on the periodic table. These elements, when seeded into neighbouring gas clouds by [[supernova]], will lead to the formation of more [[Population II]] stars (metal poor) and [[gas giants]].

===Renaissance===
* 600 million years: Renaissance of the Universe—end of the Dark Ages as visible light begins dominating throughout. Possible formation of the [[Milky Way Galaxy]]: although age of the Methusaleh star suggests a much older date of origin, it is highly likely that HD 140283 may have come into our galaxy via a later galaxy merger. Oldest confirmed star in Milky Way Galaxy, [[HE 1523-0901]]. Extent of the [[Hubble Extreme Deep Field]].

* 670 million years: [[EGS-zs8-1]], the most distant starburst or [[Lyman-break galaxy]] observed, forms. This suggests that [[Interacting galaxy|galaxy interaction]] is taking place very early on in the history of the Universe as [[starburst galaxies]] are often associated with collisions and galaxy mergers.
* 700 million years: Galaxies form. Smaller galaxies begin merging to form larger ones. Galaxy classes may have also begun forming at this time including [[Blazars]], [[Seyfert galaxies]], [[radio galaxies]], [[normal galaxies]] ([[elliptical]], [[Spiral galaxy|Spiral galaxies]], [[barred spiral]]) and [[dwarf galaxies]]. [[UDFy-38135539]], the first distant quasar to be observed from the reionization phase, forms. Dwarf galaxy [[z8 GND 5296]] forms. Galaxy or possible proto-galaxy [[A1689-zD1]] forms.

* 740 million years: [[47 Tucanae]], second-brightest globular cluster in the Milky Way, forms
* 750 million years: Galaxy [[IOK-1]] a Lyman alpha emitter galaxy, forms. [[GN-108036]] forms—galaxy is 5 times larger and 100 times more massive than the present day Milky Way illustrating the size attained by some galaxies very early on.
* 770 million years: Quasar [[ULAS J1120+0641]], one of the most distant, forms. One of the earliest galaxies to feature a [[supermassive black hole]] suggesting that such large objects existed quite soon after the Big Bang. The large fraction of neutral hydrogen in its spectrum suggests it may also have just formed or is in the process of star formation.
* 800 million years: Farthest extent of [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]]. Formation of [[SDSS J102915+172927]]: unusual population II star that is extremely metal poor consisting of mainly hydrogen and helium. [[HE0107-5240]], one of the oldest Population II stars, forms as part of a [[binary star system]]. [[LAE J095950.99+021219.1]], the Bogwiggit Galaxy, one of the most remote [[Lyman alpha emitter]] galaxies, forms. Lyman alpha emitters are considered to be the progenitors of spiral galaxies like the Milky Way. [[Messier 2]], globular cluster, forms.
* 870 million years: [[Messier 30]] forms in the Milky Way. Having experienced a [[Core collapse (cluster)]], the cluster has one of the highest densities among globular clusters.
* 890 million years: Galaxy [[SXDF-NB1006-2]] forms
* 900 million years: Galaxy [[BDF-3299]] forms.

===Galaxy epoch ===
{{further|List of the most distant astronomical objects}}

* 1 billion years (12.8 [[Gya]], z=6.56): Galaxy [[HCM-6A]], the most distant normal galaxy observed, forms. Formation of hyper-luminous quasar [[SDSS J0100+2802]], which harbors a black hole with mass of 12 billion solar masses one of the most massive black hole discovered so early in the universe. [[HE1327-2326]], a population II star, is speculated to have formed from remnants of earlier Population III stars. Visual limit of the [[Hubble Deep Field]]. Reionization complete—the Universe becomes transparent again. Galaxy evolution continues as more modern looking galaxies form and develop. Because the Universe is still small in size, galaxy interactions become common place with larger and larger galaxies forming out of the [[galaxy merger]] process. Galaxies may have begun clustering creating the largest structures in the Universe so far - the first [[galaxy clusters]] and [[galaxy superclusters]] appear.

* 2.4 billion years (11.4 Gya): Quasar [[PKS 2000-330]] forms.
* 2.41 billion years (11.39 Gya): [[Messier 10]] globular cluster forms. [[Messier 3]] forms: prototype for the [[Oosterhoff type I]] cluster, which is considered "metal-rich". That is, for a globular cluster, Messier 3 has a relatively high abundance of heavier elements.
* 2.5 billion years (11.3 Gya): [[Omega Centauri]], largest globular cluster in the Milky Way forms
* 3.0 billion years (10.8 billion Gya): Formation of the [[Gliese 581 planetary system]]: [[Gliese 581c]], the first observed [[ocean planet]] and [[Gliese 581d]], a super-earth planet, possibly the first observed [[habitable planets]], form.

* 5.0 billion years (8.8 Gya): Earliest [[Population I]], or Sunlike stars: with heavy element saturation so high, [[planetary nebula]] appear in which rocky substances are solidified – these nurseries lead to the formation of rocky [[terrestrial planets]], [[moons]], [[asteroids]], and icy [[comets]]
* 5.1 billion years (8.7 Gya): Galaxy collision: spiral arms of the Milky Way form leading to major period of star formation.
* 5.3 billion years (8.5 Gya): [[55 Cancri]] B, a "[[hot Jupiter]]", first planet to be observed orbiting as part of a star system, forms. [[Kepler 11]] planetary system, the flattest and most compact system yet discovered, forms – Kepler 11 [[Kepler-11c|c]] considered to be a giant ocean planet with hydrogen-helium atmosphere.

* 6.0 billion years (7.8 Gya): The Universe continues to organize into larger wider structures. The great walls, sheets and filaments consisting of galaxy clusters and superclusters and voids crystallize. How this crystallization takes place is still conjecture. Certainly, it is possible the formation of super-structures like the [[Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall]] may have happened much earlier, perhaps around the same time galaxies first started appearing. Either way the [[observable universe]] becomes more modern looking.
* 6.2 billion years (7.7 Gya): [[16 Cygni Bb]], the first gas giant observed in a single star orbit in a [[trinary star system]], forms – orbiting moons considered to have habitable properties or at the least capable of supporting water

* 11.2 billion years (2.5 Gya): [[Proterozoic]] begins
* 11.6 billion years (2.2 Gya): Last great tectonic period in Martian geologic history: [[Valles Marineris]], largest canyon complex in the Solar System, forms – although some suggestions of thermokarst activity or even water erosion, it is suggested Valles Marineris is rift fault

'''Women in Aztec civilization''' shared some equal opportunities. [[Aztec civilization]] saw the rise of a military culture that was closed off to women and made their role complementary to men. The status of Aztec women lasted until the 15th century, when Spanish conquest forced European norms onto the culture. However, many pre-Columbian norms survived and their legacy still remains.

==History==
The status of Aztec women changed throughout the history of the civilization. As emphasis on warfare increased, notions of egalitarianism became less important.&lt;ref name="Nash 356–362"&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
Aztec marriage practices were similar to those of other [[Mesoamerican]] civilizations such as the [[Maya civilization|Mayans]]. Aztecs married at a later age, during their late teens and early twenties, whereas in Mayan culture it was not unusual for marriages to be arranged by parents for a son and daughter who were still children. Aztec marriages were initiated by the parents of the potential groom. After consulting with the extended kinship group, the parents would approach a professional matchmaker (''ah atanzah''), who would approach the potential bride's family. The parents of the young woman would advise the matchmaker whether or not they accepted the proposal. Brides were expected to be virgins before marriage, although young people of both sex were advised to be celibate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Evans| first =Susan| doi=10.1086/RESv33n1ms20167007| title =Sexual Politics in the Aztec Palace: Public, Private, and Profane | journal =RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics | volume =33 | pages =166–183|jstor=20167007 | date =1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The marriage celebration was a four-day event, and the wedding ceremony took place on the first day. The bride would wear fine robes. Her kinswomen would decorate her arms and legs with red feathers, and paint her face with a paste containing small shimmering crystals. The ceremony would take place at the house of the groom's parents. A fire would be lit in the hearth, and incense would be burned as an offering to the gods. The groom's parents would give presents (robes and mantles) to the bride's parents. The ritual for finalizing the marriage involved the matchmaker tying the groom's cape to the bride's skirt, and then the groom's mother would give the bride and groom each four mouthfuls of tamales. Four days of feasting followed the ceremony.

For the purpose of political, military or economic alliances marriages among Aztec nobles were arranged. For example, when [[Cosijoeza]] married [[Ahuitzotl]]'s daughter to seal the alliance between the Aztecs and the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotecs]] in 1496.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamnett|first=Brian R.|title=A Concise History of Mexico|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-61802-1|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aztec kings reportedly had dozens of wives and many children. However, [[polygamy]] was only a practice among the nobles of Aztec civilization; the majority of the population were monogamous.

==Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Tlamatlquiticitl==
One of the few positions of power women could hold in Aztec society was that of the tlamatlquiticitl, or the [[midwife]]. These women were proficient in dealing with difficulties arising during pregnancy and labour but as most of the information we have about their practices is passed on from upper class Aztec men and the Spanish conquerors, much of the traditional knowledge has been lost.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women in Ancient America|last=Bruhns|first=Karen Olsen|last2=Stothert|first2=Karen E.|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-8061-4628-7|location=Norman|pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tlamatlquiticitl attended every pregnant woman, no matter status or class, although women of higher status often had a more than one attend them. The tlamatlquiticitl was essential to assisting in birth, and additionally to providing [[prenatal care]] advice.

The [[Florentine Codex]] outlines much of the advice the tlamatlquiticitl gave to excepting mothers. The mother was advised to engage in sex with her husband during the first few months of the pregnancy so as to help the child develop, but around the seventh or eighth month she was to abstain.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=General History of the Things of New Spain|last=de Sahagún|first=Bernardino|publisher=The University of Utah|year=1969|isbn=|location=Santa Fe|pages=156|translator-last=Dibble|translator-first=Charles E.|translator-last2=Anderson|translator-first2=Arthur J. O.}}&lt;/ref&gt; If she did not it was believed that the semen may act like glue and the baby would not come out, or if it did it would be feeble with misshaped fingers and toes and covered in what looks like [[atole]] so that everyone would see how the couple could not abstain, and they would be shamed.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The expecting mother was also told she must avoid prolonged periods in the sweat bath, for too much heat was thought to roast the child and it would be stuck inside the womb; however, too much heat specifically around the abdomen area would cause the child to swell and suffer from the heat.&lt;ref&gt;de Sahagún 1969, p 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Chewing [[chicle]] was not allowed otherwise the baby would be born with perforated lips and would not be able to suckle or eat.&lt;ref name="de Sahagún 1969, p. 155"&gt;de Sahagún 1969, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise if she ate earth or chalk the child would be in poor health.&lt;ref name="de Sahagún 1969, p. 156"&gt;de Sahagún 1969, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; The tlamatlquiticitl knew that the baby took nourishment from the mother and so what she ate it would absorb; if she fasted the child would starve.&lt;ref name="de Sahagún 1969, p. 156"/&gt; Because of this the mother was to eat and drink well, even after the birth.&lt;ref name="de Sahagún 1969, p. 156"/&gt; The mother was also warned not to look at anything red otherwise the child would extend crosswise, making for a complicated delivery.&lt;ref name="de Sahagún 1969, p. 156"/&gt; She was not allowed to observe lunar eclipses, otherwise the child would be born with a clef palate.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Citation|last=Burkhart|first=Louise M.|title=Spain and Mexico|url=|work=The Cambridge History of Magic and Witchcraft in the West|volume=|pages=445|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139043021|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eclipses were also associated with miscarriages.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Virgin's Children: Life in an Aztec Village Today.|last=Madsen|first=William|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=1960|isbn=9780292741348|location=Austin, Texas|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; And she was also not to look at anything that would frighten or anger her lest she should harm the child.&lt;ref name="de Sahagún 1969, p. 156"/&gt; Walking around late at night was avoided otherwise the child would cry incessantly.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; If the mother took naps during the day the tlamatlquiticitl warned that the child would be born with unusually large eyelids.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Lifting heavy objects was also associated with damaging the fetus.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; The tlamatlquiticitl also told others that the expectant mother should not be in want of anything, all her desires should be fulfilled quickly otherwise the child would suffer.&lt;ref name="de Sahagún 1969, p. 156"/&gt; Not only did the tlamatlquiticitl provide this advice but she also attended and took over household duties for the expectant mother towards the end of the pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wasserman|first=Martin|date=1985|title=The Aztec Community and Abnormal Behaviour: A Look at its Program for Primary Prevention|journal=Anthropologie|volume=23|issue=1|pages=75–76|jstor=26295517}}&lt;/ref&gt; This support, in combination with the advice on stress management, such as avoiding stressful relationships, and the suggestion to not lift heavy objects or overwork themselves, helped to contribute to the healthy psychological development of their children.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt;

The woman would know when it was almost time for her delivery as she would feel discomfort in her womb a few days prior. Because the tlamatlquiticitl resided in the house, the mother was well prepared for the birth. If the child presented in [[Breech birth|breech position]] the tlamatlquiticitl, who was skilled in massage, would take the mother into a sweat bath and massage the womb to turn the baby around.&lt;ref name="de Sahagún 1969, p. 155"/&gt; The typical position for labour was squatting, as gravity would assist as the child was being pushed out.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=978-3-319-71538-4|last=Schwartz|first=David A.|date=2018|editor-last=|editor-first=|title=Maternal Death and Pregnancy-Related Morbidity Among Indigenous Women of Mexico and Central America|series=Global Maternal and Child Health|volume=|page=22|doi=|issn=2522-8382}}&lt;/ref&gt; To induce labour the tlamatlquiticitl would at first give the mother [[Montanoa tomentosa]], and failing that, they would then administer a drink made from &amp;nbsp;possum tail, that was shown to prompt contractions.&lt;ref&gt;Burkhart 2014, p. 444&lt;/ref&gt; In modern clinical trials, many of these mixtures have been proven to have induced contractions.&lt;ref&gt;Bruhns 2014, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; However the Spanish Friars believed these concoctions to be witchcraft, and since both ritualistic and natural elements were used by the tlamatlquiticitl, the Spanish decided the tlamatlquiticitl was evil and the colonizers eradicated these practices.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; TThe act of birthing was considered a battle and the tlamatlquiticitl would give the mother a miniature shield and spear for the fight.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 2018, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; When the baby was born, the midwife would make a series of battle cries, praising the mother who had fought through her labour to deliver the baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women in the Crucible of Conquest: The Gendered Genesis of Spanish American Society, 1500–1600|last=Powers|first=Karen Vieira|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8263-3519-7|location=‎Albuquerque, New Mexico|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tlamatlquiticitl would cut the [[umbilical cord]] which connects the child to its mother and the gods, and it would be dried.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eberl|first=Markus|date=2013|title=Nourishing Gods: Birth and Personhood in Highland Mexican Codices|journal=Cambridge Archaeological Journal|volume=23|issue=3|pages=453–476|doi=10.1017/S0959774313000437}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[placenta]] came out it was taken and buried in a corner of the house by the tlamatlquiticitl.&lt;ref&gt;de Sahagún 1969, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Then the preserved umbilical cords were buried, and according to the Spanish accounts, they would be buried near a battlefield if the child was a boy or beneath the hearth if it was a girl, to indicate their futures.&lt;ref name="Eberl 2013, p. 466"&gt;Eberl 2013, p. 466.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the birthing almanacs such as the [[Codex Borgia|Codex Yoalli Ehēcatl]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;the umbilical cord was planted to ensure the relationship between the gods and child.&lt;ref name="Eberl 2013, p. 466"/&gt;

If the child died in childbirth, the tlamatlquiticitl would employ an [[obsidian]] knife to remove the fetus in pieces so as not to harm the mother.&lt;ref name="de Sahagún 1969, p. 157"&gt;de Sahagún 1969, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The tlamatlquiticitl warned the mother not to be trouble by the loss of her child otherwise the spirit of the child would suffer.&lt;ref name="de Sahagún 1969, p. 157"/&gt; Scholars argue, with evidence based in [[Bioarchaeology|bioarcheology]], that this same method was also used to perform abortions, although they were generally frowned upon.&lt;ref name=":82"&gt;Schwartz 2018, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The life of the mother was the priority over saving the fetus if the situation was life-threatening, and if the mother was at risk, then the fetus would be dismembered so she would survive.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; Women who died during childbirth were given the same honour as a soldier who was slain in battle, and were portrayed as spirits known as [[cihuateteo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brumfiel|first=Elizabeth M.|date=1998|title=Huitzilopochtli's Conquest: Aztec Ideology in the Archaeological Record|journal=Cambridge Archaeological Journal|volume=8|issue=1|pages=3–13|doi=10.1017/S095977430000127X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After delivery the tlamatlquiticitl would remain in the house so as to help the mother and monitor her milk supply. Since the child would not begin weaning until after 24 months, this was an important process.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 2018, p. 26"&gt;Schwartz 2018, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; These four days of monitoring also were to ensure a speedy recovery of the mother, and so the tlamatlquiticitl would prepare baths and meals for her. After this period, the bathing ceremony would take place.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 2018, p. 26"/&gt;

The [[Codex Mendoza]] depicts the bathing ceremony, which was conducted by the tlamatlquiticitl, four days after the birth. The child was washed in an [[earthenware]] tub on a rush mat and on each side were symbols, one for boys and the other for girls.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Codex Mendoza|last=|first=|publisher=Miller Graphics|year=1978|isbn=|location=Barcelona, Spain|pages=71|translator-last=Ross|translator-first=Kurt}}&lt;/ref&gt; For girls the three objects had to do with homemaking: a basket, a broom, and a [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]].&lt;ref name="Ross 1978, p. 70"&gt;Ross 1978, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; And there were five objects for boys, which had to do with male professions: an obsidian blade representing a featherworker, a brush for a [[scribe]], an [[Scratch awl|awl]] that carpenters work with, a tool used by goldsmiths, and shields with a bow and arrow for a warrior.&lt;ref&gt;Eberl 2013, p. 465.&lt;/ref&gt; The tlamatlquiticitl circled around the mat counter-clockwise with the child, washed the child, and then shouted out the name she has chosen for the child as she presented it to the gods.&lt;ref name="Ross 1978, p. 70"/&gt; The water she used to cleanse the outside and inside of the body does not serve the same symbolic function that it does in a Christian baptism, but rather it is used to arouse the spirit of the child and let the gods in.&lt;ref&gt;Eberl 2013, p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt; The Codex Yoallo Ehēcatl depicts this bathing ceremony as performed by the gods, and but it is understood that the tlamatlquiticitl impersonated the gods while performing these rituals because they so closely resemble what is depicted.&lt;ref&gt;Eberl 2013, p. 469.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Yoallo Ehēcatl shows images of the gods presenting the children as well as cutting the umbilical cord.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digi.vatlib.it/view/MSS_Borg.mess.1|title=Codex Borgia|last=|first=|date=|website=digi.vatlib.it|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the ceremony the tlamatlquiticitl would swaddle the child and give a speech to the mother on how valiantly she had fought and how it was time for rest.&lt;ref name="de Sahagún 1969, p. 179"&gt;de Sahagún 1969, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsmen were then invited to see the child and praise the mother, which concluded a successful birth.&lt;ref name="de Sahagún 1969, p. 179"/&gt;

==Women and labor==
Women mainly worked inside the home, spinning and weaving thread from cotton, henepen, or maquey [[agave]]. They used a handheld drop spindle, then wove cloth using a loom that they strapped to their backs and held in their laps. They were responsible for tending turkeys and dogs that were raised for meat. Extra cloth, vegetables or other items were taken by women to the nearest market to be sold or bartered for a needed item.&lt;ref name="Phillips 2011 446–7"&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Charles|title=The Complete Illustrated History: Aztec &amp; Maya|year=2011|publisher=Hermes House|location=London|isbn=978-0-85723-680-7|pages=446–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important roles of Aztec women in the home was to prepare [[masa|maize flour]] for making [[tortilla]]s, an important tradition for Mexican families today. Dried maize was soaked in lime water, a process known as [[nixtamalization]], and the nixtamalized grains ground. As part of Aztec etiquette, men ate before women.&lt;ref name="Madsen 1960"&gt;{{cite book |last=Madsen |first=William |date=1960 |title=The Virgin's Children: Life in an Aztec Village Today |publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0292741348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women had a number of other professions in Aztec civilization, including priest, doctor, sorcerer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buffington, Robert and Lila Caimari, eds.|title=Keen's Latin American Civilization: History Of Society, 1492 to the Present|year=2009|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-4408-9|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were often recognized in their civilization as professional weavers and crafters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Powers|first=Karen Vieira|title=Women in the Crucible of Conquest: The Gendered Genesis of Spanish American Society, 1500–1600|year=2005|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=978-0-8263-3519-7|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Images in [[Aztec codex|Aztec codices]], ceramics and sculptures display the elaborate and colorful designs of Aztec weavers. There were regional textile specialties, with associated graphic designs. Most designs were geometric, with some regions specializing in textiles with animal and plant images. Cotton was generally used, and dyes came from blue clays, yellow ochres, and red came from insects living in nopal cacti. Purple was derived from the sea snail ''[[Purpura patula]]'', similar to how the [[Phoenicians]] also derived purple dye used for royal robes from snails.&lt;ref name="Phillips 2011 446–7"/&gt;

However, Aztec women were not allowed a role in the military.&lt;ref name="Nash 356–362"/&gt; They could not be admitted into the military training school. This meant that women were denied access to one of the largest sources of wealth and prestige within Aztec society.

==Women and Aztec religion and mythology==
Fertility was considered to be part of the realm of the Aztec earth goddesses, particularly the mother goddess [[Tonantzin]].&lt;ref name="Madsen 1960"/&gt; Another earth goddess was [[Cihuacoatl]], as well as a supporter of women who died during childbirth. Rain and earth goddesses were considered responsible for droughts when they were not properly appeased.

==Spanish rule==
[[File:Blowing on maize.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of an Aztec woman blowing on maize (corn) before putting it into the cooking pot, so that it will not fear the fire. From the late 16th-century [[Florentine Codex]]]]
The Spanish
conquest of Aztec territories decreased much of the indigenous population, through warfare and by bringing new diseases, such as smallpox, for which the Aztecs had no immunities. The population that did survive these threats was confronted by other profound attacks upon their culture in the form of Spanish institutions such as the Roman Catholic religion.

As early as 1529, the Spanish began coercively converting Aztecs to Catholicism. They focused on the Aztec nobility initially, to create an example for the other Aztecs to follow. Nobles such as Quetzalmacatzin, King of Amaquemecan ([[Chalco (altépetl)|Chalco]]), were forced to choose one wife and abandon the others, to comply with the current Christian institution of marriage, which meant monogamy. Aztec polygamous arrangements, with secondary wives and children, were not legally recognized by the Spanish, who considered such women and children illegitimate and disinherited from claims to ranks or property. This also tore apart the political and economic fabric of Aztec culture, since noble marriages were made with political and territorial claims in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Powers|first=Karen Vieira|title=Women in the Crucible of Conquest: The Gendered Genesis of Spanish American Society, 1500–1600|year=2005|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=978-0-8263-3519-7|pages=59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working demands became harsh for women after the Spanish arrived and the [[encomienda]]s were created. Aztec communities had already lost many men to war and epidemics, and the encomiendas meant that more men worked outside of their villages for the [[encomendero]]s. Traditional gender-based divisions of labour became irrelevant. Women no longer had men to do plowing, and were left to do all the agricultural tasks themselves, which included the planting and harvesting, as well as growing enough produce to meet the tribute demands of the encomiendas. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Powers|first=Karen Vieira|title=Women in the Crucible of Conquest: The Gendered Genesis of Spanish American Society, 1500–1600|year=2005|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=978-0-8263-3519-7|pages=64–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over several generations, many young women left the rural areas to work as domestic servants or as market vendors in the cities. By the 17th century, Andean women were the majority of the market vendors in colonial cities such as [[La Paz]] (Bolivia), [[Cuzco]] (Peru), and [[Quito]] (Ecuador).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Powers|first=Karen Vieira|title=Women in the Crucible of Conquest: The Gendered Genesis of Spanish American Society, 1500–1600|year=2005|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=978-0-8263-3519-7|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Spanish culture prohibited women working outside of their home as their priority was to raise children. Their independence as workers with paid occupations was ended by the Spanish, particularly in textile work. When the Spanish eventually set up industrial textile mills, they had only men working in the mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Powers|first=Karen Vieira|title=Women in the Crucible of Conquest: The Gendered Genesis of Spanish American Society, 1500–1600|year=2005|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=978-0-8263-3519-7|pages=59–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Øyvind Bjorvatn''' (26 April 1931 – 9 February 2015) was a Norwegian politician for the [[Liberal Party of Norway|Liberal Party]] and later the [[Liberal People's Party (Norway)|Liberal People's Party]]. He was born in [[Herefoss]].

He was elected to the [[Storting|Norwegian Parliament]] from [[Aust-Agder]] in 1965, and was re-elected on one occasion. During his second term, in December 1972, Bjorvatn joined the [[Liberal People's Party (Norway)|Liberal People's Party]] which split from the Liberal Party over disagreements of Norway's proposed entry to the [[European Economic Community]]. He later served in the position of deputy representative for the joint list of the Centre Party, the Christian Democratic Party, the Liberal Party and the Liberal People's Party during the term 1977&amp;ndash;1981. He then became the party leader of the Liberal People's Party, and held this position from 1982 to 1986.

Bjorvatn was a member of [[Tvedestrand]] municipality council during the terms 1963&amp;ndash;1967 and 1967&amp;ndash;1971.
