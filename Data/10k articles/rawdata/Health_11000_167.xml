'''Alto Lindoso Dam''' ({{lang-pt|Barragem do Alto Lindoso|links=no}}) is a [[concrete]] double curvature [[arch dam]] on the [[Limia (river)|Lima River]]. It is located in the municipality [[Ponte da Barca]], in [[Viana do Castelo District]], [[Portugal]]. The dam lies in [[Peneda-Gerês National Park]] close to the border with [[Spain]].

Construction of the dam began in 1983. The dam was completed in 1992. It is owned by ''Companhia Portuguesa de Produção de Electricidade'' (CPPE). The dam is used for power production.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;

==Dam==
Alto Lindoso Dam is a 110 m tall (height above foundation) and 297 m long double curvature arch dam with a crest altitude of 339 m.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt; The width at the base is 21 m (crest 4 m).&lt;ref name="mde"/&gt; The volume of the dam is 308,500 m³. The dam contains 2 shaft [[spillway]]s with 3 gates each (combined maximum discharge 2,760 m³/s) and 2 bottom outlets (combined maximum discharge 400 m³/s).&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;

==Reservoir==
At full reservoir level of 338 m (maximum flood level of 339 m) the reservoir of the dam has a surface area of 1.05 (10.72)&lt;ref name="mde"/&gt;&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt; km² and its total capacity is 379.01 mio. m³. Its active capacity is 347.91 (270)&lt;ref name="ren"/&gt; mio. m³. Minimum operating level is 280 m.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt; With the 347.9 mio. m³ water 224.6 [[GWh]] can be produced.&lt;ref name="EDP"/&gt;

==Power plant ==
The [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage]]&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt; [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power plant went operational in 1992. It is owned by CPPE, but operated by [[Energias de Portugal|EDP]]. The plant has a [[nameplate capacity]] of 630&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EDP"/&gt; (634)&lt;ref name="ren"/&gt; [[Megawatt|MW]]. Its average annual generation is 933.8&lt;ref name="EDP"/&gt; (909.6,&lt;ref name="da"/&gt; 910&lt;ref name="ren"/&gt; or 948&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt;) [[GWh]].

The power station contains 2 [[Francis turbine]]-generators with 317 MW (350 [[Volt-ampere|MVA]]) each in an underground powerhouse 340 m below the surface.&lt;ref name="mde"/&gt; The turbine rotation is 214.3 rpm. The minimum [[hydraulic head]] is 227 m, the maximum 288 m. Maximum flow per turbine is 125 m³/s.&lt;ref name="EDP"/&gt;

As lower reservoir for Alto Lindoso the reservoir of [[Touvedo Dam|Touvedo dam]] is used,&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt; which is connected via a tailrace tunnel with a length of 4,883 m.&lt;ref name="mde"/&gt;&lt;ref name="da"/&gt;

'''Anthoxanthins''' ([[flavone]]s and [[flavonol]]s)&lt;ref&gt;Isolation of a UDP-glucose: Flavonoid 5-O-glucosyltransferase gene and expression analysis of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in herbaceous peony (Paeonia lactiflora Pall.). Da Qiu Zhao, Chen Xia Han, Jin Tao Ge and Jun Tao, Electronic Journal of Biotechnology, 15 November 2012, Volume 15, Number 6, {{doi|10.2225/vol15-issue6-fulltext-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a type of [[flavonoid]] pigments in plants.  Anthoxanthins are water-soluble pigments which range in color from white or colorless to a creamy to yellow, often on petals of flowers. These pigments are generally whiter in an acid medium and yellowed in an [[alkaline]] medium. They are very susceptible to color changes with minerals and metal ions, similar to anthocyanins. As with all flavonoids, they exhibit antioxidant properties, and are important in [[nutrition]], and are sometimes used as [[food additive]]s. Darkening with iron is particularly prominent in food products. They are considered to have more variety than  [[anthocyanins]]. Some examples are [[quercitin]].

'''Azerizin''' is claimed to be a proprietary blend of the natural ingredients [[nicotinamide]], [[azelaic acid]], [[quercetin]] and [[curcumin]] that purportedly combine the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, along with inhibiting effects on sebum production.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The cascade of events in the inflammatory pathway that result from cell membrane disruption is well documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herskowitz|first=Ahvie|author2=Mangano, Dennis T.|title=Inflammatory Cascade: A Final Common Pathway for Perioperative Injury?|journal=Anesthesiology|date=November 1996|volume=85|issue=5|pages=957–960|url=http://journals.lww.com/anesthesiology/fulltext/1996/11000/inflammatory_cascade__a_final_common_pathway_for.1.aspx|doi=10.1097/00000542-199611000-00001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chainani-wu |first=Nita |title=Safety and Anti-Inflammatory Activity of Curcumin: A Component of Tumeric {sic} (Curcuma longa) |journal=The Journal of Alternate and Complementary Medicine |year=2003 |volume=9 |pages=161–168 |url=https://pinnaclife.com/sites/default/files/research/Curcumin-Safety.pdf |doi=10.1089/107555303321223035 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014162028/https://pinnaclife.com/sites/default/files/research/Curcumin-Safety.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The release of membrane phospholipids leads to increased production of [[arachidonic acid]] which in turn results in elevated [[leukotriene]], [[prostaglandin]] and [[thromboxane]] production. The ingredients in Azerizin are known to inhibit each of these three major paths of [[inflammation]] by blocking or down-regulating pro-inflammatory catalysts at multiple points in the inflammatory cascade, e.g., inhibition of [[phospholipase]], [[lipooxygenase]], [[COX-2]], [[leukotrienes]], [[thromboxane]], [[prostaglandins]], nitric oxide, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chirumbolo|first=S|title=The role of quercetin, flavonols and flavones in modulating inflammatory cell function|journal=Inflamm Allergy Drug Targets|date=Sep 2010|volume=9|issue=4|pages=263–85|doi=10.2174/187152810793358741|pmid=20887269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fivenson|first=DP|title=The mechanisms of action of nicotinamide and zinc in inflammatory skin disease|journal=Cutis|date=Jan 2006|issue=1 Suppl|pages=5–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jurenka|first=Julie S|title=Anti-inflammatory properties of curcumin, a major constituent of Curcuma longa:  A review of preclinical and clinical research|journal=Alternative Medicine Review|date=2 Nov 2009|volume=14|issue=f2|pages=141–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shalita|first=A|author2=Falcon R|author3=Olansky A|author4=Oannotta P|author5=Akhavan A|author6=Day D|author7=Janiga A|author8=Singri P|author9=Kallal J|title=Inflammatory acne management with a novel prescription dietary supplement|journal=Journal of Drugs in Dermatology|year=2012|volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these anti-inflammatory actions, the components of Azerizin possess potent antimicrobial activity against ''[[Propionibacterium acnes]]'' and ''[[Staphylococcus epidermis]]'', at least in part attributed to inhibition of microbial cellular protein synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=C|author2=Huang H|title=In Vitro Anti-Propionibacterium Activity by Curcumin Containing Vesicle System|journal=Chem Pharm Bull|year=2013|volume=61|issue=4|pages=419–425|doi=10.1248/cpb.c12-01043|pmid=23546001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=azelaic acid - Compound Summary|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=2266|publisher=PubChem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fitton|first=Andrew|author2=Goa, Karen L|title=Azelaic acid: A review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic efficacy in acne and hyperpigmentary skin disorders|journal=Drugs|year=1991|volume=41|pages=780–798|doi=10.2165/00003495-199141050-00007|pmid=1712709|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Azerizin was developed at [[Elorac]] for use as an adjunct in the management of acne vulgaris and rosacea.

'''Bjerrum's area''' is central 25° of the [[visual field]] from the fixation point, popularized scientifically by the Danish [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] [[Jannik Petersen Bjerrum]]

Bjerrum believed that this central portion of the [[visual field]] was of far more use than the perimeter - as he had observed 90% of the early [[glaucoma]]tous changes were inside these 25°.

Multiple types of [[scotoma]]s form inside Bjerrums area, typically in patients with open-angle [[glaucoma]].

Of particular note is the arcuate scotoma (also called the Bjerrums scotoma). It is characterized by starting at the [[Blind spot (vision)|blind spot]], and arching over the macular area, ending a horizontal line nasally. The arcuate scotoma doesn't cross the horizontal divide of the [[visual field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrington|first=David O.|date=1964|title=The Bjerrum Scotoma|journal=Transactions of the American Ophthalmological Society|volume=62|pages=324–348|issn=0065-9533|pmc=1310164|pmid=14269898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cause''', also known as '''etiology''' ({{IPAc-en|iː|t|i|ˈ|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}) and '''aetiology''', is the [[Causality|reason]] or origination of something.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kenneth J. |last=Rothman |authorlink=Kenneth Rothman (epidemiologist) |first2=Sander |last2=Greenland |authorlink2=Sander Greenland |first3=Charles |last3=Poole |first4=Timothy L. |last4=Lash |chapter=Causation and Causal Inference |title=Modern Epidemiology |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |edition=Third |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7817-5564-1 |pages=6–7 |chapterurl=https://books.google.de/books?id=Z3vjT9ALxHUC&amp;pg=PA6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|αἰτιολογία}}, ''aitiologia'', "giving a reason for" ({{lang|grc|αἰτία}}, ''aitia'', "cause"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Aetiology | work = Oxford English Dictionary | edition = 2nd | year = 2002 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-521942-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In medicine, the term refers to the causes of [[disease]]s or [[pathology|pathologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Greene J | url = http://www.widesmiles.org/cleftlinks/WS-364.html | title = The three C's of etiology | work = Wide Smiles | year = 1996 | accessdate = 2007-08-20 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070630061038/http://www.widesmiles.org/cleftlinks/WS-364.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-30}} Discusses several examples of the medical usage of the term ''etiology'' in the context of [[cleft lip]]s and explains methods used to study causation.&lt;/ref&gt; Where no etiology can be ascertained, the disorder is said to be [[idiopathic]].
Traditional accounts of the causes of disease may point to the "[[evil eye]]".&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] scholar [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] put forward early ideas about [[microorganism]]s in a 1st-century BC book titled ''On Agriculture''.&lt;ref&gt;''Varro On Agriculture'' 1, xii Loeb&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval thinking on the etiology of disease showed the influence of [[Galen]] and of [[Hippocrates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pmj.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/83/979/352 Maimonides: an early but accurate view on the treatment of hemorrhoids -- Magrill and Sekaran 83 (979): 352 -- Postgraduate Medical Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval [[Europe]]an doctors generally held the view that disease was related to the air and adopted a [[Miasma theory of disease|miasmatic approach]] to disease etiology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/index/w44720475g378602.pdf Case study: the history and ethics clean air]&lt;/ref&gt;

Etiological discovery in medicine has a history in [[Robert Koch]]'s demonstration that the tubercle bacillus (''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' complex) causes the disease [[tuberculosis]], ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' causes [[anthrax]], and ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' causes [[cholera]].  This line of thinking and evidence is summarized in [[Koch's postulates]]. But proof of causation in infectious diseases is limited to individual cases that provide experimental evidence of etiology.

In [[epidemiology]], several lines of evidence together are required to infer causation. [[Austin Bradford Hill|Sir Austin Bradford-Hill]] demonstrated a causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer, and summarized the line of reasoning in the epidemiological criteria for causation. Dr. Al Evans, a US epidemiologist, synthesized his predecessors' ideas in proposing the Unified Concept of Causation.

==Chain of causation and correlation==

Further thinking in epidemiology was required to [[correlation is not causation|distinguish causation from association or statistical correlation]]. Events may occur together simply due to [[Randomness|chance]], [[bias]] or [[confounding]], instead of one event being caused by the other. It is also important to know which event is the cause. Careful sampling and measurement are more important than sophisticated statistical analysis to determine causation. Experimental evidence involving interventions (providing or removing the supposed cause) gives the most compelling evidence of etiology.

Related to this, sometimes several symptoms always appear together, or more often than what could be expected, though it is known that one cannot cause the other. These situations are called [[syndrome]]s, and normally it is assumed that an underlying condition must exist that explains all the symptoms.

Other times there is not a single cause for a disease, but instead a chain of causation from an initial trigger to the development of the clinical disease. An etiological agent of disease may require an independent co-factor, and be subject to a promoter (increases expression) to cause disease. An example of all the above, which was recognized late, is that [[peptic ulcer disease]] may be induced by stress, requires the presence of acid secretion in the stomach, and has primary etiology in ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' infection. Many chronic diseases of unknown cause may be studied in this framework to explain multiple epidemiological associations or [[risk factor]]s which may or may not be causally related, and to seek the actual etiology.{{r to section}}

==Etiological heterogeneity==

Some diseases, such as [[diabetes]] or [[hepatitis]], are syndromically defined by their signs and [[symptom]]s, but include different conditions with different etiologies. These are called [[heterogeneous condition]]s.

Conversely, a single etiology, such as [[Epstein-Barr virus]], may in different circumstances produce different diseases such as [[Infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]], [[nasopharyngeal carcinoma]], or [[Burkitt's lymphoma]].

===Endotype===
{{main|endotype}}
An '''endotype''' is a subtype of a condition, which is defined by a distinct functional or [[Pathobiology|pathobiological]] mechanism. This is distinct from a [[Phenotype (clinical medicine)|phenotype]], which is any observable characteristic or trait of a [[disease]], such as [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], development, biochemical or physiological properties, or behavior, without any implication of a mechanism. It is envisaged that [[patient]]s with a specific endotype present themselves within phenotypic clusters of diseases.

One example is asthma, which is considered to be a [[syndrome]], consisting of a series of endotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lötvall |first=J. |last2=Akdis |first2=C. A. |last3=Bacharier |first3=L. B. |last4=Bjermer |first4=L. |last5=Casale |first5=T. B. |last6=Custovic |first6=A. |last7=Lemanske |first7=R. F. Jr. |last8=Wardlaw |first8=A.

Other example could be [[AIDS]], where an HIV infection can produce several [[clinical stage]]s. AIDS is defined as the clinical stage IV of the HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Kenneth G. |last=Castro |first2=John W. |last2=Ward |first3=Laurence |last3=Slutsker |first4=James W. |last4=Buehler |first5=Harold W. |last5=Jaffe |first6=Ruth L. |last6=Berkelman |title=1993 Revised Classification System for HIV Infection and Expanded Surveillance Case Definition for AIDS among Adolescents and Adults |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=17 |issue=4 |year=1993 |pages=802–810 |jstor=4457386 |doi=10.1093/clinids/17.4.802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In healthcare, a '''change-of-shift report''' is a meeting between healthcare providers at the change of shift in which vital information about and responsibility for the [[patient]] is provided from the off-going provider to the on-coming provider (Groves, Manges, Scott-Cawiezell, 2016).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Groves|first = Patricia S.|last2 = Manges|first2 = Kirstin A.|last3 = Scott-Cawiezell|first3 = Jill|date = 2016-02-08|title = Handing Off Safety at the Bedside|url = http://cnr.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/02/05/1054773816630535|journal = Clinical Nursing Research|language = en|pages = 1054773816630535|doi = 10.1177/1054773816630535|issn = 1054-7738|pmid = 26858262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other names for change-of-shift report include handoff, shift report, handover, or sign-out. Change-of-shift report is key to [[Inpatient care|inpatient]] care because healthcare providers ([[nurses]], [[physician]]s, [[nursing assistants]] etc.) are essential to providing around the clock care.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Nursing change-of-shift report ==
During report, the outgoing nurses discuss with the oncoming nurses the condition of each patient and any changes that have occurred to the patient during the shift. The purpose is not to cover all details recorded in the patient's medical record, but to summarize individual patient progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wywialowski|first1=Elizabeth F|title=Managing Client Care|date=2004|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323024822|pages=167–182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=smda_ScaWVsC&amp;pg=PA167#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content of the report often depends on the local organization.

==Issues with report ==
While report is necessary in order to communicate important information between nurses, various problems are posed by the giving of report.
* Nurses in many places are legally not permitted to leave the facility until the provider has given report to the next shift. "Walking off the job" may be considered abandonment, which may be grounds for revocation of the nurse's license. At the same time, facilities are not legally required in all places to pay nurses for the extra time beyond their shift they are forced to stay over to complete report. It is not uncommon for nurses to attend report in their own time before and after a shift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scovell|first1=S|title=Role of the nurse-to-nurse handover in patient care.|journal=Nursing Standard|date=2010|volume=24|issue=20|pages=35–39|doi=10.7748/ns2010.01.24.20.35.c7453|url=http://rcnpublishing.com/doi/pdfplus/10.7748/ns2010.01.24.20.35.c7453|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* While privacy laws require report to be given in a location where unauthorized people cannot hear the report (patients and authorized visitors for that patient are allowed to hear their report, but patients and visitors are not allowed to hear reports for other patients), some facilities prohibit family members from visiting patients during report times.  In contrast, some facilities require shift reports to take place in front of each affected patient, including authorized visitors.

== Nursing Bedside Shift Report and patient safety ==
There is evidence to suggest that performing change of shift report at the bedside is key to patient safety. In 2001, the [[National Academy of Medicine|Institute of Medicine]] stated that "it is in inadequate handoff that safety often fails first."&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Medicine. (2001). Crossing the quality chasm: A new health system for the 21st century. Washington, DC: National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because at every change of shift, there is a chance for miscommunication about vital patient information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A specific type of change-of-shift report is '''Nursing Bedside Shift Report''' in which the off going nurse provides change-of-shift report to the on coming nurse at the patient's bedside.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

(2016)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; NBSR is used by nurses to keep patients safe by "reducing risk of harm through conveying the patient story from shift to shift."

'''''Chlorella''''' is a [[genus]] of single-[[Cell (biology)|cell]]ed [[green algae]] belonging to the division [[Chlorophyta]]. It is spherical in shape, about 2 to 10 [[Micrometre|μm]] in diameter, and is without [[flagella]].  ''Chlorella'' contains the green photosynthetic pigments [[chlorophyll-a]] and [[Chlorophyll b|-b]] in its [[chloroplast]]. Through [[photosynthesis]], it multiplies rapidly, requiring only [[carbon dioxide]], [[water]], [[sunlight]], and a small amount of [[mineral]]s to reproduce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John |last=Scheffler |date=3 September 2007 |title=Underwater Habitats |journal=Illumin |volume=9 |issue=4 |url=http://illumin.usc.edu/163/underwater-habitats/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Chlorella'' is taken from the [[Greek language|Greek]] χλώρος, ''chloros'', meaning green, and the [[Latin]] diminutive suffix ''ella'', meaning small. German [[biochemist]] and cell physiologist [[Otto Heinrich Warburg]], awarded with the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1931 for his research on [[cell respiration]], also studied photosynthesis in ''Chlorella''. In 1961, [[Melvin Calvin]] of the [[University of California]] received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his research on the pathways of [[Calvin cycle|carbon dioxide assimilation in plants]] using ''Chlorella''.

Many people believe ''Chlorella'' can serve as a potential source of food and energy because its [[photosynthetic efficiency]] can, in theory, reach 8%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=I. |last=Zelitch |title=Photosynthesis, Photorespiration and Plant Productivity |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |year=1971 |page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; which exceeds that of other highly efficient crops such as [[sugar cane]].

== As a food source ==

''Chlorella'' is a  potential food source because it is high in [[protein]] and other essential nutrients; when dried, it is about 45% [[protein]], 20% [[fat]], 20% [[carbohydrate]], 5% fiber, and 10% minerals and [[vitamin]]s. Mass-production methods are now being used to cultivate it in large artificial circular ponds. It is commonly used as a 'superfood' and can be found as an ingredient in certain liquid-based cocktails.

When first harvested, ''Chlorella'' was suggested as an inexpensive protein supplement to the human diet.  Advocates sometimes focus on other supposed health benefits of the algae, such as claims of [[weight control]], [[cancer prevention]], and [[immune system enhancer|immune system support]].&lt;ref name= "belasco"/&gt; According to the [[American Cancer Society]], "available scientific studies do not support its effectiveness for preventing or treating cancer or any other disease in humans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Under certain growing conditions, ''Chlorella'' yields oils that are high in [[polyunsaturated fat]]s—''Chlorella minutissima'' has yielded [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] at 39.9% of total lipids.&lt;ref name=Yongmanitchai&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=2014989 |year=1991 |last1=Yongmanitchai |first1=W |last2=Ward |first2=OP |title=Growth of and omega-3 fatty acid production by Phaeodactylum tricornutum under different culture conditions |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=419–25 |pmc=182726 |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===

Following global fears of an uncontrollable human population boom during the late 1940s and the early 1950s, ''Chlorella'' was seen as a new and promising primary food source and as a possible solution to the then-current world hunger crisis. Many people during this time thought hunger would be an overwhelming problem and saw ''Chlorella'' as a way to end this crisis by providing large amounts of high-quality food for a relatively low cost.&lt;ref name= "belasco"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Warren |last1=Belasco |date=July 1997 |title=Algae Burgers for a Hungry World? The Rise and Fall of Chlorella Cuisine |journal=Technology and Culture |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=608–34 |jstor=3106856 |doi=10.2307/3106856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many institutions began to research the algae, including the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington|Carnegie Institution]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], the [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]], [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], and [[Stanford University]]. Following [[World War II]], many Europeans were starving, and many [[Malthusianism|Malthusians]] attributed this not only to the war, but also to the inability of the world to produce enough food to support the increasing population. According to a 1946 [[FAO]] report, the world would need to produce 25 to 35% more food in 1960 than in 1939 to keep up with the increasing population, while health improvements would require a 90 to 100% increase.&lt;ref name= "belasco"/&gt; Because meat was costly and energy-intensive to produce, protein shortages were also an issue. Increasing cultivated area alone would go only so far in providing adequate nutrition to the population. The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] calculated that, to feed the U.S. population by 1975, it would have to add 200 million acres (800,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of land, but only 45 million were available. One way to combat national food shortages was to increase the land available for farmers, yet the American frontier and farm land had long since been extinguished in trade for expansion and urban life. Hopes rested solely on new agricultural techniques and technologies. Because of these circumstances, an alternative solution was needed.

To cope with the upcoming postwar population boom in the United States and elsewhere, researchers decided to tap into the unexploited sea resources. Initial testing by the [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]] showed ''Chlorella'' (when growing in warm, sunny, shallow conditions) could convert 20% of solar energy into a plant that, when dried, contains 50% protein.&lt;ref name= "belasco"/&gt; In addition, ''Chlorella'' contains fat and vitamins. The plant's photosynthetic efficiency allows it to yield more protein per unit area than any plant—one scientist predicted 10,000 tons of protein a year could be produced with just 20 workers staffing a 1000-acre (4-km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) ''Chlorella'' farm.&lt;ref name= "belasco"/&gt; The pilot research performed at Stanford and elsewhere led to immense press from journalists and newspapers, yet did not lead to large-scale algae production. ''Chlorella'' seemed like a viable option because of the technological advances in agriculture at the time and the widespread acclaim it got from experts and scientists who studied it. Algae researchers had even hoped to add a neutralized ''Chlorella'' powder to conventional food products, as a way to fortify them with vitamins and minerals.&lt;ref name= "belasco"/&gt;

When the preliminary laboratory results were published, the scientific community at first backed the possibilities of ''Chlorella''. ''[[Science News Letter]]'' praised the optimistic results in an article entitled "Algae to Feed the Starving". John Burlew, the editor of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]] book ''Algal Culture-from Laboratory to Pilot Plant'', stated, "the algae culture may fill a very real need,"&lt;ref name="Algal Culture"&gt;{{cite book |title=Algal Culture-from Laboratory to Pilot Plant |publisher=Carnegie Institution of Washington |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Burlew |year=1953 |page=6 |isbn=978-0-87279-611-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ''Science News Letter'' turned into "future populations of the world will be kept from starving by the production of improved or educated algae related to the green scum on ponds." The cover of the magazine also featured [[Arthur D. Little]]'s Cambridge laboratory, which was a supposed future food factory. A few years later, the magazine published an article entitled "Tomorrow's Dinner", which stated, "There is no doubt in the mind of scientists that the farms of the future will actually be factories." ''[[Science Digest]]'' also reported, "common pond scum would soon become the world's most important agricultural crop." However, in the decades since those claims were made, algae have not been cultivated on that large of a scale.

=== Current status ===
Since the growing world food problem of the 1940s was solved by better crop efficiency and other advances in traditional agriculture, ''Chlorella'' has not seen the kind of public and scientific interest that it had in the 1940s. ''Chlorella'' has only a niche market for companies promoting it as a dietary supplement.&lt;ref name= "belasco"/&gt;

==== Production difficulties ====
The experimental research was carried out in laboratories, rather than in the field, and
scientists discovered that ''Chlorella'' would be much more difficult to produce than previously thought. To be practical, the algae grown would have to be placed either in [[artificial light]] or in shade to produce at its maximum photosynthetic efficiency. Also, for the ''Chlorella'' to be as productive as the world would require, it would have to be grown in [[carbonated water]], which would have added millions to the production cost. A sophisticated process, and additional cost, was required to harvest the crop, and, for ''Chlorella'' to be a viable food source, its cell walls would have to be pulverized. The plant could reach its nutritional potential only in highly modified artificial situations. Another problem was developing sufficiently palatable food products from ''Chlorella.''&lt;ref name="becker" /&gt;

Although the production of ''Chlorella'' looked promising and involved creative technology, it has not to date been cultivated on the scale some had predicted. It has not been sold on the scale of ''[[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|Spirulina]]'', [[soybean]] products, or whole grains. Costs have remained high, and ''Chlorella'' has for the most part been sold as a health food, for cosmetics, or as [[animal feed]].&lt;ref name="becker"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biotechadv.2006.11.002 |title=Micro-algae as a source of protein |year=2007 |last1=Becker |first1=E.W. |journal=Biotechnology Advances |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=207–10 |pmid=17196357}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a decade of experimentation, studies showed that following exposure to sunlight, ''Chlorella'' captured just 2.5% of the solar energy, not much better than conventional crops.&lt;ref name= "belasco"/&gt; ''Chlorella'', too, was found by scientists in the 1960s to be impossible for humans and other animals to digest in its natural state due to the tough cell walls encapsulating the nutrients, which presented further problems for its use in American food production.&lt;ref name= "belasco"/&gt;

In 1965, the Russian [[Controlled Ecological Life Support System|CELSS]] experiment [[BIOS-3]] determined that 8 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of exposed ''Chlorella'' could remove carbon dioxide and replace oxygen within the sealed environment for a single human. The algae were grown in vats underneath artificial light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Permanent |title=Russian CELSS Studies |url=http://www.permanent.com/russian-celss.html |accessdate=3 November 2012 |work=Space Colonies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 study showed that ''Chlorella'' cell walls contain [[lipopolysaccharide]]s, [[endotoxin]]s found in [[Gram-negative bacteria]] that affect the [[immune system]] and may cause [[inflammation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://robbwolf.com/2012/01/19/trojan-horses-of-chlorella-superfood/ |title=Trojan horses of ''Chlorella'' 'superfood' |first=Roman |last=Sasik |date=19 January 2012 |publisher=Robb Wolf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12414578 |year=2002 |last1=Armstrong |first1=PB |last2=Armstrong |first2=MT |last3=Pardy |first3=RL |last4=Child |first4=A |last5=Wainwright |first5=N |title=Immunohistochemical demonstration of a lipopolysaccharide in the cell wall of a eukaryote, the green alga, Chlorella |volume=203 |issue=2 |pages=203–4 |journal=The Biological Bulletin |doi=10.2307/1543397|jstor=1543397 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/glia.20467 |title=Systemic LPS causes chronic neuroinflammation and progressive neurodegeneration |year=2007 |last1=Qin |first1=Liya |last2=Wu |first2=Xuefei |last3=Block |first3=Michelle L. |last4=Liu |first4=Yuxin |last5=Breese |first5=George R. |last6=Hong |first6=Jau-Shyong |last7=Knapp |first7=Darin J. |last8=Crews |first8=Fulton T. |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=453–62 |pmid=17203472 |pmc=2871685 |journal=Glia}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent studies have found that the lipopolysaccharides in organisms other than Gram-negative bacteria, for example in cyanobacteria, are considerably different from the lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1186/1476-069X-5-7 | year = 2006 | last1 = Stewart | first1 = Ian | last2 = Schluter | first2 = Philip J | last3 = Shaw | first3 = Glen R | journal = Environmental Health: A Global Access Science Source | volume = 5 | pages = 7 | pmid=16563160 | pmc=1489932 | title=Cyanobacterial lipopolysaccharides and human health - a review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aquaria ==
''Chlorella'' can create green and opaque water problems in [[aquarium|aquaria]]. ''Chlorella'' can grow due to high [[nitrate]] and [[phosphate]] levels or by direct sunlight. Decreasing phosphate and nitrate by partial water change and moving the aquarium to shade can help alleviate the problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9302">'''Clive Robbins''', (23 July 1927 in [[Handsworth, West Midlands]] - 7 December 2011 in New York)
was a British [[Music therapy|music therapist]], [[Special Needs]] educator, [[Anthroposophy|anthroposophist]] and co-founder of [[Nordoff-Robbins]] music therapy.

==Early years==

Born on 23 July 1927 in Handsworth, Birmingham as the son of a baker, Clive Robbins did not discover until he was 17 that the woman he had always been told was his older sister, was actually his mother, due to prejudices surrounding the issue of [[illegitimacy]] at the time. He started life somewhat disoriented and in search of meaning and purpose. During the [[World War II]], he was sent away to foster parents. Here he developed his lifelong passion for music, was able to hear classical music and take piano lessons.

While in the [[RAF]] at 18, Clive was injured by a bullet that nearly killed him, leaving his left hand and arm partially paralysed and dashing his hopes of becoming a pianist. Instead, he attempted photography and painting but found no vocation until becoming a teacher in 1954 at [[Sunfield Children's Home]], a [[Rudolf Steiner]] 'curative educational community' for mentally disabled children in the Clent Grove, [[Stourbridge]]. He described it as "the first profoundly fulfilling experience of my life". He and his wife Mildred lived with their two children, Tobias and Jennifer, on the grounds of the school in a small trailer.

==Sunfield Homes==

It was in 1958 at Sunfield that Clive met [[Paul Nordoff]], who was an eminent American composer and pianist. Paul Nordoff was always fascinated by Steiner's philosophy, known as anthroposophy, and was so impressed by what he found at Sunfield that he went on to explore his growing interest in the therapeutic potential of music. In 1959, Clive Robbins teamed up with Paul Nordoff and pioneered an extraordinary new way of reaching and engaging disabled children through musical improvisation, music therapy being practically unknown at the time.

Paul Nordoff and Clive Robbins were both involved in the thinking and practice of Anthroposophy previous to their meeting. "Our studies of anthroposophy had independently instilled in each of us an attitude of reverence for the destiny of humanity as a whole and the meaningfulness of each human existence" Robbins later wrote, going on to describe the individual music therapy work that they soon began together at Sunfield as "creative empiricism" (Robbins, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;10).&lt;ref&gt;[http://mtp.oxfordjournals.org Practicing "Gentle Empiricism "—The Research Heritage Nordoff Robbins by GARY ANSDELL &amp; MERCEDES PAVLICEVIC]&lt;/ref&gt;

The time Paul Nordoff spent at Sunfield in 1959-60 working with Clive Robbins was life-changing. The two men formed a close relationship and carried out experimental musical work with many of the most disabled and unreachable children who bore tragic lives of distress and self-injury. With the help of carefully chosen harmonies, appealing melodies and rhythms, the children were drawn into musical participation developing increased social and self-awareness, discipline and concentration. Placed in front of a snare drum and cymbal, they revealed their sensitivities and their expressive, receptive and relational abilities in their musical responses. It was a profound discovery of how music could be used for human benefit and Paul and Clive documented their observations and techniques in painstaking detail, making and transcribing recordings of their sessions.

==Nordoff-Robbins music therapy==

When Paul left Sunfield in June 1960 Clive accompanied him, gripped by the urge to continue what they had started. They visited 26 curative homes across Europe, giving illustrated presentations and live demonstrations of their work, then spent the next six years in Philadelphia exploring and establishing the work which they called therapy in music. A research grant from the National Institute of Mental Health supported them in this. There followed seven years in Europe where Paul and Clive worked as Lecturing Fellows of the American-Scandinavian Foundation from 1967 to 1974. This period saw the fruition of their work together with teaching engagements across Europe, the evolution of music therapy training for musicians, publications and television documentaries about their work.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Paul and Clive toured the world demonstrating their work, with groups of followers starting to work wherever they went. After Paul Nordoff's died in 1977, Robbins continued his music therapy work, teaching and lecturing well into his 80s and renowned for his ability to inspire and captivate audiences with real-life stories of his charismatic life-transforming work in music.

In 1975, Clive returned to the US where he married his second wife Carol Matteson, also a music therapist. Together they worked at the New York State School for the Deaf in Rome, NY (1975–81), at [[Southern Methodist University]], Dallas (1981–82), continuing courses and lectures and maintaining ties in Europe with annual teaching engagements. From 1982 until 1989 they lived in [[Australia]] where they established a Music Therapy Centre at [http://www.warrah.org/ Warrah], an anthroposophical disability service centre and [[Biodynamic agriculture|biodynamic]] farm, and a Nordoff-Robbins Association in Australia. In 1989 a dream was fulfilled with the establishment of the Nordoff-Robbins Center for Music Therapy at [[New York University]], of which Clive and Carol became Co-Directors. The new Centre served as a music therapy clinic and training venue for music therapists in the Nordoff-Robbins approach. Here Clive stayed active until his death, becoming Founding Director in 1998.

==Final years==

After Carol's untimely death in 1996, Clive married another music therapist, Kaoru Mochizuki, with whom he worked and lectured also in the Far East - Japan, Taiwan and Korea. The improvisational approach to music therapy which he pioneered with Nordoff has influenced the entire professional field, extending well beyond the range of those who were trained specifically in the Nordoff-Robbins approach. Music therapy represents a new force in contemporary music, with roots all over the globe and the Nordoff-Robbins approach has played a pivotal role in this development, championed by Clive Robbins. It was named by its co-creators Creative Music Therapy and is both a philosophy and a practical craft, based on a deep insight into the transformative power of music in human experience.

Clive's gift was to help Paul Nordoff harness his musicianship, giving it direction and finding a language for communicating the ideas. Clive has inspired thousands with his love, emotion and sensitivity, his embracing personality and humanistic values. His descriptions of the power of music and its impact on the emotional states of human experience were profoundly moving to the many who heard and shared his passion for music and people.

Clive saw the establishment in 1996 of the International Trust for Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy which came into being to preserve the name and reputation of Nordoff Robbins and to hold the worldwide intellectual property assets arising from the work of Paul Nordoff and Clive Robbins. He held honorary doctorates from [[Combs College of Music]], Philadelphia, the [[University of Witten-Herdecke]], Germany, and the [[State University of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nordoff-robbins.org.uk/news/memoriam-clive-robbins-1927-2011 In memoriam: Clive Robbins 1927-2011 Nordoff-Robbins UK retrieved 2014.10.08] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015072920/http://www.nordoff-robbins.org.uk/news/memoriam-clive-robbins-1927-2011 |date=2014-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''complete protein''' or '''whole protein''' is a food source of [[protein]] that contains an adequate proportion of each of the [[essential amino acid|nine essential amino acid]]s necessary in the human [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]].&lt;ref name="medline"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Medline Plus Medical Encyclopedia | title = Protein in diet | url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002467.htm | accessdate = 2006-10-28 | date=  September 2, 2003 | publisher = U.S. National Library of Medicine and National Institute of Health|quote=In the published meta-analysis of nitrogen balance studies by Rand and coworkers (2003), there were no significant differences in the intakes of dietary nitrogen required to meet nitrogen equilibrium between those studies that supplied dietary protein predominantly from animal, vegetable, or mixed protein sources.  It is important to realize, however, that this aggregate analysis does not suggest that dietary protein quality is of no importance in adult protein nutrition.  ... the quality of well-processed soy proteins was equivalent to animal protein ... while wheat proteins were used in significantly lower efficiency ... while lysine is likely to be the most limiting of the indispensable amino acids in diets based predominantly on cereal proteins, the risk of a lysine inadequacy is essentially removed by inclusion of relatively modest amounts of animal or other vegetable proteins, such as those from legumes and oilseeds, or through lysine fortification in cereal flour.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of single-source complete proteins are [[red meat]], [[poultry]], fish, eggs, milk, cheese, [[yogurt]], [[soybean]]s and [[quinoa]].&lt;ref name="FNB"&gt;Food and Nutrition Board of [[Institute of Medicine]] (2005) ''Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids'' [https://www.nap.edu/read/10490/chapter/12#691], page 691, from [[National Academies Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="myplate"&gt;{{cite web|title=All About the Protein Foods Group|url=https://www.choosemyplate.gov/protein-foods|publisher=US Department of Agriculture|accessdate=20 May 2018|date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="&amp;quot;FAOquinoaancientcrop&amp;quot;"&gt;{{cite web|title=Quinoa: An ancient crop to contribute to world food security|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/aq287e/aq287e.pdf|publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]]|date=July 2011|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept does not include whether or not the food source is high in total protein, or any other information about that food's nutritious value.

It was once thought that plant sources of protein are deficient in one or more amino acids, and so [[vegetarian]] diets had to specifically [[Protein combining|combine foods during meals]], which would create a complete protein. However, the most recent position of the [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]] is that protein from a variety of plant foods eaten during the course of a day supplies enough essential amino acids when caloric requirements are met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melina|first=Vesanto|last2=Craig|first2=Winston|last3=Levin|first3=Susan|date=2016-12-01|title=Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Vegetarian Diets|url=http://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(16)31192-3/fulltext|journal=Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|language=English|volume=116|issue=12|pages=1971|doi=10.1016/j.jand.2016.09.025|issn=2212-2672|pmid=27886704|via=http://www.eatrightpro.org/~/media/eatrightpro%20files/practice/position%20and%20practice%20papers/position%20papers/vegetarian-diet.ashx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normal [[Physiology|physiological]] functioning of the body is possible if one obtains enough protein and sufficient amounts of each amino acid from a plant-based diet.&lt;ref name="VRYoung"&gt;{{cite journal | authors=Young VR, Pellett PL | title=Plant proteins in relation to human protein and amino acid nutrition | journal=[[American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] | volume=59 | issue=5&amp;nbsp;Suppl | year=1994 | pages=1203S-1212S |  id= | pmid=8172124 | doi=10.1093/ajcn/59.5.1203s}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the highest [[PDCAAS]] scores are not given to commonly eaten meat products, but rather to animal-derived vegetarian foods like [[Cow’s milk|milk]] and eggs and the [[vegan]] food [[soy protein isolate]].

[[File:Blausen 0259 CoronaryArteryDisease 02.png|thumb|Illustration depicting coronary artery disease]]
Limitation of blood flow to the heart causes [[ischemia]] (cell starvation secondary to a lack of oxygen) of the heart's [[myocardium|muscle cells]].  The heart's muscle cells may die from lack of [[oxygen]] and this is called a [[myocardial infarction]] (commonly referred to as a heart attack). It leads to damage, death, and eventual scarring of the heart muscle without regrowth of heart muscle cells. Chronic high-grade [[stenosis|narrowing]] of the coronary arteries can induce transient [[ischemia]] which leads to the induction of a [[ventricular arrhythmia]], which may terminate into a dangerous heart rhythm known as [[ventricular fibrillation]], which often leads to death.&lt;ref name="AmbroseSingh2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ambrose|first1=John|last2=Singh|first2=Manmeet|title=Pathophysiology of coronary artery disease leading to acute coronary syndromes|journal=F1000Prime Reports|volume=7|pages=08|year=2015|issn=2051-7599|doi=10.12703/P7-08|pmc=4311268|pmid=25705391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, coronary artery disease occurs when part of the smooth, elastic lining inside a [[coronary artery]] (the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle) develops [[atherosclerosis]]. With atherosclerosis, the artery's lining becomes hardened, stiffened, and accumulates deposits of calcium, fatty lipids, and abnormal inflammatory [[Cell (biology)|cells]] – to form a [[Atheromatous plaque|plaque]]. Calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) deposits in the muscular layer of the blood vessels appear to play a significant role in stiffening the arteries and inducing the early phase of coronary [[arteriosclerosis]]. This can be seen in a so-called metastatic mechanism of [[calciphylaxis]] as it occurs in [[chronic kidney disease]] and [[hemodialysis]] (Rainer Liedtke 2008). Although these people suffer from a kidney dysfunction, almost fifty percent of them die due to coronary artery disease. Plaques can be thought of as large "pimples" that protrude into the channel of an artery, causing a partial obstruction to blood flow. People with coronary artery disease might have just one or two [[Atheromatous plaque|plaque]]s, or might have dozens distributed throughout their [[coronary arteries]]. {{anchor|CTO}}A more severe form is ''chronic total occlusion'' (CTO) when a coronary artery is completely obstructed for more than 3 months.&lt;ref name="Aziz2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aziz|first1=S|title=Chronic total occlusions—a stiff challenge requiring a major breakthrough: is there light at the end of the tunnel?|journal=Heart|volume=91|issue=suppl_3|year=2005|pages=iii42–iii48|issn=1355-6037|doi=10.1136/hrt.2004.058495|pmid=15919653|pmc=1876352}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The diagnosis of "Cardiac Syndrome X" – the rare coronary artery disease that is more common in women, as mentioned, is a diagnosis of exclusion. Therefore, usually the same tests are used as in any person with the suspected of having coronary artery disease:
* [[Baseline (medicine)|Baseline]] [[electrocardiography]] (ECG)
* Exercise ECG – [[Cardiac stress test|Stress test]]
* Exercise radioisotope test (nuclear stress test, myocardial [[scintigraphy]])
* [[Echocardiography]] (including stress echocardiography)
* [[Coronary angiography]]
* [[Intravascular ultrasound]]
* [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI)

The diagnosis of coronary disease underlying particular symptoms depends largely on the nature of the symptoms. The first investigation is an [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG/EKG), both for "stable" angina and acute coronary syndrome. An [[Chest X-ray|X-ray of the chest]] and [[blood test]]s may be performed.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Stable angina===
{{main|Angina pectoris}}
In "stable" angina, chest pain with typical features occurring at predictable levels of exertion, various forms of [[cardiac stress test]]s may be used to induce both symptoms and detect changes by way of electrocardiography (using an ECG), [[echocardiography]] (using [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] of the heart) or [[scintigraphy]] (using uptake of [[radionuclide]] by the heart muscle). If part of the heart seems to receive an insufficient blood supply, [[Coronary catheterization|coronary angiography]] may be used to identify [[stenosis]] of the coronary arteries and suitability for [[angioplasty]] or [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coronary Angiography|url=https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/ca|website=National Heart, Blood, and Lung Institute|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acute coronary syndrome===
{{main|Acute coronary syndrome}}
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
Diagnosis of [[acute coronary syndrome]] generally takes place in the [[emergency department]], where ECGs may be performed sequentially to identify "evolving changes" (indicating ongoing damage to the heart muscle). Diagnosis is clear-cut if ECGs show elevation of the "[[Electrocardiogram#ST segment|ST segment]]", which in the context of severe typical chest pain is strongly indicative of an acute [[myocardial infarction]] (MI); this is termed a STEMI (ST-elevation MI) and is treated as an emergency with either urgent [[Coronary catheterization|coronary angiography]] and [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] (angioplasty with or without [[stent]] insertion) or with [[thrombolysis]] ("clot buster" medication), whichever is available. In the absence of ST-segment elevation, heart damage is detected by [[cardiac marker]]s (blood tests that identify heart muscle damage). If there is evidence of damage ([[infarction]]), the chest pain is attributed to a "non-ST elevation MI" (NSTEMI). If there is no evidence of damage, the term "unstable angina" is used. This process usually necessitates hospital admission and close observation on a [[coronary care unit]] for possible complications (such as [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s – irregularities in the heart rate). Depending on the risk assessment, stress testing or angiography may be used to identify and treat coronary artery disease in patients who have had an NSTEMI or unstable angina.

===Risk assessment===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
There are various risk assessment systems for determining the risk of coronary artery disease, with various emphasis on different variables above. A notable example is [[Framingham Score]], used in the [[Framingham Heart Study]]. It is mainly based on age, gender, diabetes, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, tobacco smoking and systolic blood pressure.

==Prevention==
Up to 90% of cardiovascular disease may be preventable if established risk factors are avoided.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGill|first=Henry C.|last2=McMahan|first2=C.

Most guidelines recommend combining these preventive strategies. A 2015 Cochrane Review found some evidence that such an approach might help with [[blood pressure]], [[body mass index]], and [[waist circumference]]. However, there was insufficient evidence to show an effect on mortality or actual cardiovascular events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue = 1|pages = CD001561|last=Ebrahim|first=Shah|last2=Taylor|first2=Fiona|last3=Ward|first3=Kirsten|last4=Beswick|first4=Andrew|last5=Burke|first5=Margaret|last6=Davey Smith|first6=George|date=2011-01-19|isbn=|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd001561.pub3|pmid = 21249647|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[diabetes mellitus]], there is little evidence that very tight [[blood sugar]] control improves cardiac risk although improved sugar control appears to decrease other problems such as [[kidney failure]] and [[blindness]]. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommends "low to moderate alcohol intake" to reduce risk of coronary artery disease while high intake increases the risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/5_population_nutrient/en/index12.html|title=5.

[[File:Daisy player.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A DAISY player and audio book.]]
'''DAISY''' ('''Digital Accessible Information SYstem''') is a [[technical standard]] for digital [[audiobook]]s, [[periodicals]] and computerized text. DAISY is designed to be a complete audio substitute for print material and is specifically designed for use by people with "print disabilities", including [[blindness]], impaired vision, and [[dyslexia]]. Based on the [[MP3]] and [[XML]] formats, the DAISY format has advanced features in addition to those of a traditional audio book. Users can search, place bookmarks, precisely navigate line by line, and regulate the speaking speed without distortion. DAISY also provides aurally accessible tables, references and additional information.&lt;ref name = goethe&gt;Sabine Tenta: ''The Audible Gate to the World: The West German Audio Book Library for the Blind'' (Goethe-Institut, 2009) [http://www.goethe.de/wis/bib/dos/bip/nrw/en4789945.htm online] {{en icon}} retrieved 26-May-2012&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, DAISY allows visually impaired listeners to navigate something as complex as an [[encyclopedia]] or [[textbook]], otherwise impossible using conventional audio recordings.&lt;ref&gt;Ask-it: [http://www.ask-it.org/documents/best_practices/BP_Daisy%20Digital.doc A5.5.3: Examples of best practices of design for all]. Accessed 2009-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

DAISY multimedia can be a book, magazine, newspaper, journal, computerized text or a synchronized presentation of text and audio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daisy.org/z3986/ DAISY/NISO Standard]. Accessed 2009-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt; It provides up to six embedded "navigation levels" for content, including embedded objects such as images, graphics, and [[MathML]]. In the DAISY standard, navigation is enabled within a sequential and hierarchical structure consisting of ([[Markup language|marked-up]]) text synchronized with audio.&lt;ref&gt;George Kerscher: "[http://www.digitaltalkingbook.com/publications/docs/20040510214528/DAISY-in-Brief_final.htm DAISY is]", December 2003. Accessed 2009-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt; DAISY 2 was based on [[XHTML]] and [[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language|SMIL]].&lt;ref&gt;DAISY Consortium: [http://www.daisy.org/z3986/specifications/daisy_202.html DAISY 2.02 Specification - Recommendation, February 28 2001]. Accessed 2009-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt; DAISY 3 is a newer technology, also based on XML, and is standardized as [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]]/[[National Information Standards Organization|NISO]] Z39.86-2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/Z3986-2005.html ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005 Specifications for the Digital Talking Book]. Accessed 2009-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DAISY Consortium was founded in 1996 and consists of international organizations committed to developing equitable access to information for people who have a print disability.&lt;ref&gt;DAISY Consortium: [http://www.daisy.org/about_us/ About The DAISY Consortium]. Accessed 2009-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The consortium was selected by the [[National Information Standards Organization]] (NISO) as the official maintenance agency for the DAISY/NISO Standard.&lt;ref&gt;DAISY Consortium: [http://www.daisy.org/z3986/index.php DAISY/NISO Standard]. Accessed 2009-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specification ==
A '''Digital Talking Book''' ('''DTB''') is a collection of electronic files arranged to present information to the target population via alternative media, namely, human or synthetic speech, refreshable Braille, or visual display, e.g., large print. The DTB files comprising the DAISY format is
* Package File: A set of metadata describing the DTB
* Textual content file: Contains the text of the document in XML
* Audio Files: human or synthetic speech MP3 recordings
* Image files: for visual displays
* Synchronization files: synchronizes the different media files of the DTB during playback
* Navigation control file: for viewing the document's hierarchical structure
* Bookmark/Highlight file: support to user-set highlights
* Resource file: for playback management
* Distribution Information File: maps each SMIL file to a specific media unit

== Access to materials ==
Since DAISY is often used by people with disabilities, many of the existing organizations which produce accessible versions of copyrighted content are moving to the DAISY standard, and slowly moving away from more traditional methods of distribution such as cassette tape.

In the United States, [[Learning Ally]] (Formally "Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic" or RFB&amp;D)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfbd.org/ Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic (RFB&amp;D)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[AMAC Accessibility]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amacusg.org/ AMAC Accessibility]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Bookshare]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookshare.org/ Bookshare - Accessible Books for Individuals with Print Disabilities]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped]] (NLS),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/nls/ National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS)]&lt;/ref&gt; among others, offer content to blind and visually impaired individuals. Learning Ally and Bookshare also allows access by those with [[dyslexia]] or other disabilities which impair the person's ability to read print. The NLS uses a library methodology, on the basis that the books are loaned (as they traditionally have been, on physical cassette), hence they are able to offer content free of charge, just as any public library can. Learning Ally and Bookshare both are subscription-based services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learningally.org/Membership/20/ Learning Ally Membership]&lt;/ref&gt; Bookshare membership is free to U.S. students due to funding from the U.S. Department of Education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookshare.org/membershipOptions Bookshare membership]&lt;/ref&gt;

Content from both the NLS and the Learning Ally organizations utilizes the '''DAISY Protected Digital Book''' ('''PDTB''') encryption standard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/nls/specs/1205_Final_nov15_1_07.pdf NLS/BPH Secification 1205]&lt;/ref&gt; The basic structure of the DAISY definition files remains the same, however, the audio itself, and in some cases certain information tags in the DAISY [[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language|SMIL]] files, are encrypted and must be decrypted in order to be read/played back. The organization which offers the content provides a decryption key to the user, which can be installed into a DAISY player to allow decryption. As the encryption schemes are not part of the core DAISY standard, only players which specifically implement the necessary algorithms and key management will be able to access these titles. Bookshare utilizes its own digital rights management plan including fingerprinting each digital book with the identity of the downloading user.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bookshare.org/cms/legal/seven-point-digital-rights-management-plan Bookshare Seven Point Digital Rights Management Plan]&lt;/ref&gt; These actions are done to comply with law 17 U.S.C. § 121 requiring copyrighted material to be distributed in a specialized format to prevent unauthorized individuals, such as those who do not have a qualifying disability, from accessing the materials.

==Playback and production==
DAISY books can be heard on standalone DAISY players,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daisy.org/tools/tools.shtml?Cat=hplayback DAISY: Hardware Playback Tools]&lt;/ref&gt; computers using DAISY playback software,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daisy.org/tools/tools.shtml?Cat=splayback DAISY: Software Playback Tools]&lt;/ref&gt; mobile phones, and MP3 players (with limited navigation). DAISY books can be distributed on a CD/DVD, memory card or through the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daisy.org/about_us/dtbooks.shtml DAISY: Technology Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

A computerized text DAISY book can be read using refreshable Braille display or screen-reading software, printed as [[Braille]] book on paper, converted to a talking book using synthesised voice or a human narration, and also printed on paper as large print book. In addition, it can be read as large print text on computer screen.&lt;ref&gt;DAISY Consortium: "[http://www.daisyindia.org/02HelloDAISY.html WHAT IS DAISY?]". Accessed 2009-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Kerscher: "[http://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/Us_Eu/conf/z19/z19001/z1900115.html Braille Production the DAISY Way]", IFLA/SLB Pre-conference Seminar in Penang 1999.

===Hardware players===
There are a wide range of hardware products available that can play DAISY content, usually in a portable form factor. Some of these devices are dedicated to playback of books, while others focus on other functionality, such as PDA or mobile Internet access, and offer DAISY playback as either a feature of the unit or as a software add-on.

A short (incomplete) list of products that have built-in support for DAISY playback includes:
* American Printing House for the Blind, Inc., Book Port Plusand Book Port DT &lt;ref&gt;http://tech.aph.org/bpdt_doc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''definitive map''' is a record of public [[Right-of-way (transportation)|rights of way]] in England and Wales. In law it is the definitive record of where a right of way is located. The highway authority (normally the county council, or unitary authority in areas with a one-tier system) has a statutory duty to maintain a definitive map, though in national parks the National Park Authority usually maintains the map. The [[Inner London]] boroughs are exempt from the statutory duty though they have the powers to maintain a map: currently none does so.

Each right of way also has a written description referred to as the [[definitive statement]]. Generally the definitive map takes legal precedence over the definitive statement.

'''Disability in Singapore''' describes the different aspects of life affecting people with disabilities in Singapore. [[Singapore]] does not have a formal definition of [[disability]], but has been making changes in regards to the visibility of people with disability and also with increasing accessibility of all areas of the country. Early in the country's history, human rights issues for people with disabilities took second place to the need to secure independence and building the economy. Singapore signed on to the  [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] (UNCRPD) in 2013 and coordinates the Enabling Masterplan with both government and [[Non-governmental organization|non governmental organisations]].

== History ==
A discourse of charity generally permeated in Singapore since the post world war 2 period. Support for disabled people was left to the community, who set up various voluntary organisations.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuansong|first=Zhuang|date=2010|title=Enabling the Singapore Story: Writing a History of Disability|url=|journal=Monograph 42: Studies in Malaysian &amp; Singapore History: Mubin Sheppard Memorial Essays|volume=|pages=47–81|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the war saw the British implement the welfare state based on the Beveridge Report, which had repercussions in Singapore. As part of this focus on welfare, a Social Welfare Department (SWD) was setup in 1946.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; SWD was meant to provide permanent assistance only for those with a permanent disability or because of old age.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; However, the SWD was not as comprehensive as the British system.{{Sfn|Luk|2014|p=96}} The SWD also did not provide provisions for [[special education]] and in fact, seemed to have the idea that children with special needs would "hinder the typical child's education."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The 1960s and 1970s, with Singapore's emphasis on economic growth, saw a new priority on rehabilitating disabled people so as to enable them to join and return to the work force.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It was only in 1981, when the first world congress of Disabled People's International was held in Singapore that began a new discourse based on the social model of disability.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Disabled activists from around the world, including [[Vic Finkelstein]], [[Ed Roberts (activist)]] and [[Bengt Lindqvist]], elected a Singaporean, Ron Chandran Dudley as the first founder chairperson. This was to lead to a growth in disability activism from the 1980s onwards.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In 1983, the [[Ministry of Social and Family Development|Ministry of Social Affairs]] held a workshop on people with disabilities and came up with a formal policy about how to advocate for people with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The workshop came up with the first nationally endorsed definition of disability that recognized their needs in society.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The Advisory Council on the Disabled was formed in April 1988 and was first chaired by [[Tony Tan]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The council emphasized the importance of integrating disabled people as equal citizens.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] included disabled people on the [[Remaking Singapore Committee|Remaking Singapore]] campaign in 2002.{{Sfn|Wong|Ng|Lor|Wong|2017|p=175}} Also in 2002, the government created a voluntary, affordable form of [[health insurance]] called ElderShield.{{Sfn|Luk|2014|p=91}} The insurance helps pay for expenses in the care of severely disabled people.{{Sfn|Luk|2014|p=91}}

In 2013, Singapore signed onto the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] (UNCRPD).{{Sfn|Wong|Ng|Lor|Wong|2017|p=171}}

== Demographics ==
For individuals over 50, around 13.3% are considered disabled; between ages 18 and 49, around 3.4% are disabled and 2.1% of children under 18 are disabled in Singapore.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msf.gov.sg/media-room/Pages/Number-and-profile-of-persons-with-disabilities.aspx|title=Number and profile of persons with disabilities|last=|first=|date=|website=Ministry of Social and Family Development|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those who have a disability, around half are considered physical or sensory disabilities.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; One in 68 children in Singapore has been diagnosed with [[autism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/living-with-disabilities-that-are-not-visible|title=Living With Disabilities That Are Not Visible|last=Hui|first=Kok Xing|date=2016-05-08|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2017-09-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of children diagnosed with autism has increased in Singapore over time.{{Sfn|Fam|2016|p=15}} Around 5 to 6 percent of children born in Singapore have developmental problems of various types.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Only 0.55% of the Singapore workforce has a disability of some kind.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/call-to-integrate-people-with-disabilities-early|title=Call to integrate people with disabilities early|last=Hui|first=Kok Xing|date=2017-03-05|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2017-09-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
Around half of people with physical disabilities acquired them through [[Congenital disorder|congenital]] or hereditary means.{{Sfn|Raghunathan|Balakrishnan|Smith|Kadir|2015|p=4}}

== Cultural attitudes towards disability ==
In Singapore, there has been an emphasis on rehabilitating those with disabilities.{{Sfn|Wong|Ng|Lor|Wong|2017|p=172}} People who were unable to work have often been seen through a [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] lens, since they were deemed as unable to contribute economically to the country.{{Sfn|Wong|Ng|Lor|Wong|2017|p=175}}

In addition, the prevention of disabilities was seen as important. In 1970, Singapore passed the Voluntary Sterilisation Act (VSA) which allowed any spouse, parent or  legal guardian of a person with recurring or permanent mental or physical disabilites to consent to sterilization on their behalf.{{Sfn|Wong|Ng|Lor|Wong|2017|p=173}} This gave caregivers of people with disabilities "inordinate power to make decisions on their behalf."{{Sfn|Wong|Ng|Lor|Wong|2017|p=173}} During the 1980s and 90s, many disabled people were kept at home or put into institutions.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/the-hard-and-heart-part-of-inclusivenes-for-the-disabled|title=The hard - and heart - part of inclusiveness for the disabled|last=Tan|first=Theresa|date=2016-06-09|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2017-09-28|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who have disabilities that are less obvious face social judgement and stigma for their disability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They are often questioned whether they need assistance because they don't "look" disabled.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 2015 study conducted by the [[National Council of Social Service]] (NCSS) found that a third of people in Singapore would not employ individuals with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-disability-awareness-campaign-calls-for-the-public-to-see-th-7967158|title=New disability awareness campaign calls for the public to 'see the true me'|last=|first=|date=2 June 2016|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2017-09-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Singaporeans are unsure how to interact with people with disabilities because the [[etiquette]] in such situations was unclear.{{Sfn|Fam|2016|p=18}}

===Sport===
{{see also|Singapore at the Paralympics}}
Since the founding of the [[Singapore Disability Sports Council]] (then named the "Singapore Sports Council for the Handicapped")  in 1973, Singaporean disabled athletes started participation in regional and [[Commonwealth]] disability sport events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://sdsc.org.sg/about-us/|website=Singapore Disability Sports Council|accessdate=12 October 2017|date=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore entered a team in [[Paralympic Games]] for the first time at the [[1988 Summer Paralympics]], and have participated in every [[Summer Paralympic Games|Summer Games]] since.

== Policy ==
Singapore, in comparison to other similar countries, does not spend a lot of money on social welfare services.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/articles/social-policy-in-singapore-a-crucible-of-individual-responsibility/|title=Social Policy in Singapore: A Crucible of Individual Responsibility|last=Haskins|first=Ron|date=2011-06-01|work=Brookings|access-date=2017-09-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government emphasizes the ideas of self-reliance with the family being the first line of a person's support and volunteer and grassroots organizations helping next.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Because family is the "first line of support," people with disabilities who rely on caregivers are "often at the mercy of the vagaries of family relationships."{{Sfn|Raghunathan|Balakrishnan|Smith|Kadir|2015|p=7}}

Modern views on working with people who have disabilities in Singapore have evolved over time. Nevertheless, the government does not have a "clear definition of disability and persons with disability."{{Sfn|DPA|2015|p=6}}

The Enabling Masterplan 2012-2016 recommended promoting inclusiveness for people with disabilities through educational campaigns.{{Sfn|DPA|2015|p=11}} Several campaigns took place in 2013, some promoted by the government and others by NGOs.{{Sfn|DPA|2015|p=12}}

In 2016, a campaign to raise Singaporean's awareness of people with disabilities was unveiled.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The five-year campaign was created by NCSS and is called "See the True Me."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 2017 the government of Singapore allocated $400 on people with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A school-to-work transition program for students who have developmental and intellectual disabilities was created in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/more-help-for-the-disabled-and-their-caregivers|title=More help for the disabled and their caregivers|last=Goy|first=Priscilla|date=2017-02-21|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2017-09-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals with a developmental disability are able to use a Developmental Disability Registry Identity Card (DDR ID Card) which provides discounts and access to participating facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sgenable.sg/pages/content.aspx?path=/schemes/developmental-disability-registry-identity-card/|title=Developmental Disability Registry Identity Card|last=|first=|date=|website=SG Enable|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, people with developmental disabilities are aided in police investigations by the Appropriate Adult Scheme (AAS) of 2015.{{Sfn|DPA|2015|p=17-18}}

=== Infrastructure ===
[[File:Wheelchair_ramp_on_a_bus.jpg|thumb|Wheelchair bus ramp.]]
All [[train station]]s in Singapore are equipped with accessible entrances and [[elevator]]s.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asiaone.com/health/facilities-disabled-singapore|title=Facilities for the disabled in Singapore|work=AsiaOne|access-date=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stations also have [[braille]] information and tactile surface indicators.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Train station names are announced for the visually impaired and red lights flash to warn of door closings for the deaf.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The Enabling Masterplan 2012-2016 also provided Singapore with accessible signage for public transportation and in public areas and buildings.{{Sfn|DPA|2015|p=13}}

Housing structures provided by the [[Housing and Development Board|Housing Development Board]] (HDB) are free of barriers and since 2006, older housing estates have been upgraded with ramps, handrails and provide other types of assistance to people with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The public environment since has been improved through the Code on Accessibility in the Built Environment 2013, which provides greater accessibility in buildings  and infrastructure constructed after 2013.{{Sfn|DPA|2015|p=13}} Companies are provided support through the government to upgrade existing facilities in order to provide "basic accessibility features."{{Sfn|DPA|2015|p=14}}

=== Education ===
''Chin Pu'' (or "Progress") centers were set up by the Singapore Association for Retarded Children (SARC), which is now known as the [[Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore]] (MINDS).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.minds.org.sg/AboutUs.html|title=MINDS' Vision and Mission|last=|first=|date=|website=Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of SIngapore|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These centers or schools were first sponsored by the [[Rotary International|Rotary Club]] of Singapore in 1961.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, children with multiple disabilities and who had disabilities other than intellectual disabilities did not qualify for the ''Chin Pu'' centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yyG3CgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q=%22chin%20pu%22&amp;f=false|title=Many Dawns: A Brief History of Services for Individuals with Intellectual Disability in Singapore|last=Cherian|first=Mary|last2=Ho|first2=Jeannie|date=2002-11-22|publisher=World Scientific|year=|isbn=9789814632553|location=|pages=53|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, children with various special needs were not accepted by schools in Singapore.{{Sfn|Wong|Ng|Lor|Wong|2017|p=176}} One of the first schools for children with disabilities was opened on March 12, 1979 by [[Leaena Tambyah]].{{Sfn|Wong|Ng|Lor|Wong|2017|p=176}} The school was called AWWA's Handicapped Children's Playgroup and operated out of St Ignatius Church.{{Sfn|Wong|Ng|Lor|Wong|2017|p=176}}

Since around 2011, the government of Singapore has created [[early childhood intervention]] services which include therapy and educational support.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/your-son-has-special-needs-so-do-my-dogs|title='Your son has special needs?

The first inclusive [[preschool]], Kindle Garden, was started in 2016 by the [[Asian Women's Welfare Association]] (AWWA).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Higher education institutions, such as [[Singapore Management University]] (SMU), don't always provide accommodations for students with disabilities on hand.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ahead.org/standing-committees/member-development/singapore-interview-part-2|title=Interview from Singapore (Part 2)|last=|first=|date=|website=AHEAD: Association on Higher Education and Disability|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of SMU, when students were seen needing accommodations, the university created a committee with Jack Yong Ho as the head to procure items for inclusion.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Non Governmental Organisations ===
Activist, [[Ron Chandran-Dudley]], who was also [[Visual impairment|visually impaired]], played an important part in the 1980s by representing Singapore at the first [[Disabled Peoples' International|Disabled People's International]] (DPI) World Congress.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Chandran-Dudley pointed out that many people who are disabled in Singapore were not in leadership positions in the organizations developed for them.{{Sfn|Wong|Ng|Lor|Wong|2017|p=174}} He also advocated that it was important to focus on what disabled people could do, not what they couldn't do.{{Sfn|Wong|Ng|Lor|Wong|2017|p=174}} In April 1986, the Singapore chapter of DPI, called the [[Disabled People's Association]] (DPA), was registered, becoming the first advocacy group for the rights of people with disabilities to be officially recognized.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; DPA continues to advocate for the rights of people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dpa.org.sg/about-us/history/|title=History|last=|first=|date=|website=DPA - The Disabled People's Association|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; DPA promotes cultural understanding for people with disabilities by visiting places such as schools and offices.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

An organization for children with intellectual disabilities, [[Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore|Singapore Association for Retarded Children]] (SARC), which later changed its name to Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore, (MINDS) was started in 1962 by medical social worker, [[Daisy Vaithliningam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0eW6CgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP15&amp;ots=lRTG_sXtcW&amp;dq=%22Daisy%20Vaithilingam%22&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Daisy%20Vaithilingam%22&amp;f=false|title=Singapore Childhood: Our Stories Then And Now|last=Koh|first=Jaime|publisher=World Scientific|year=2012|isbn=9789814405799|location=|pages=129–130|language=en|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislation ===
Legislation that supported and protect the rights of people with disabilities in Singapore started in the 1980s.{{Sfn|Wong|Ng|Lor|Wong|2017|p=173}}

There is no law against denying service or access to people with disabilities in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/why-spore-needs-disability-legislation?singlepage=true|title=Why S’pore needs disability legislation|last=Yap|first=Alvan|date=3 December 2013|work=TODAY Online|access-date=2017-09-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The VSA, which allows individuals to be sterilized was amended in 2012 to give greater consent to people who may undergo the process.{{Sfn|DPA|2015|p=20}}

Singapore is a state party to the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], having signed on 30 November 2012 and ratified on 18 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dpa.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Singapore-and-UN-CRPD.pdf|title=Singapore and the UN CRPD|publisher=Disabled People's Association, Singapore|year=2015|location=Singapore|page=5|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[HIV]] and [[AIDS]] affects [[economic growth]] by reducing the availability of [[human capital]].&lt;ref name="Bell-et-al-2003"/&gt; Without proper [[Prevention of HIV/AIDS|prevention]], [[nutrition]], health care and medicine that is available in developing countries, large numbers of people are falling victim to AIDS.

People living with HIV/AIDS will not only be unable to work, but will also require significant medical care. The forecast is that this will probably cause a collapse of babies and societies in countries with a significant AIDS population. In some heavily infected areas, the epidemic has left behind many [[orphan]]s cared for by elderly [[grandparent]]s.&lt;ref name=Greener&gt;{{cite book

 | pages = 49&amp;ndash;55
 | publisher = IAEN
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased mortality in this region will result in a [[population decline|smaller skilled population]] and [[labor force]].&lt;ref name="Greener"/&gt; This smaller [[labor force]] will be predominantly young people, with reduced knowledge and [[work experience]] leading to reduced productivity. An increase in workers’ time off to look after sick family members or for [[sick leave]] will also lower productivity. Increased mortality will also weaken the mechanisms that generate human capital and [[investment]] in people, through loss of [[income]] and the death of parents.&lt;ref name="Greener"/&gt; As the epidemic progresses, the age profile of those infected will increase, though the peak is expected to stay within the working age population. HIV disproportionately infects and impacts on women, so those sectors employing large numbers of women e.g. education, may be disproportionately economically impacted by HIV&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Risley |first=Claire L. |last2=Drake |first2=Lesley J. |last3=Bundy |first3=Donald A. P. |date=November 16, 2012 |title=Economic Impact of HIV and Antiretroviral Therapy on Education Supply in High Prevalence Regions |journal=PLoS One |volume=7 |issue=11 |pages=e42909 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0042909|pmid=23173030 |bibcode=2012PLoSO...742909R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on taxable population==
By killing off mainly young adults, AIDS seriously weakens the [[tax]]able population, reducing the resources available for [[public expenditure]]s such as education and health services not related to AIDS resulting in increasing pressure for the state's finances and slower growth of the economy. This results in a slower growth of the tax base, an effect that will be reinforced if there are growing expenditures on treating the sick, training (to replace sick workers), sick pay and caring for AIDS orphans. This is especially true if the sharp increase in adult mortality shifts the responsibility and blame from the family to the government in caring for these orphans.&lt;ref name=Greener /&gt;

On the level of the household, AIDS results in both the loss of income and increased spending on healthcare by the household. The income effects of this led to spending reduction as well as a substitution effect away from education and towards healthcare and funeral spending. A study in [[Côte d'Ivoire]] showed that households with an HIV/AIDS patient spent twice as much on medical expenses as other households.&lt;ref name="WBank"&gt;{{cite journal
| author=Over M
| title=The macroeconomic impact of AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa, Population and Human Resources Department
| publisher=The World Bank | year=1992
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With economic stimulus from the government, however, HIV/AIDS can be fought through the economy. With some money, HIV/AIDS patients will have to worry less about getting enough food and shelter and more about fighting their disease. However, if economic conditions aren't good, a person with HIV/AIDS may decide to become a sex trade worker to earn more money. As a result, more people become infected with HIV/AIDS.

==Relationship to GDP==
UNAIDS, WHO and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] have documented a correlation between the decreasing life expectancies and the lowering of [[gross national product]] in many African countries with prevalence rates of 10% or more. Indeed, since 1992 predictions that AIDS would slow [[economic growth]] in these countries have been published. The degree of impact depended on assumptions about the extent to which illness would be funded by savings and who would be infected.&lt;ref name="WBank"/&gt;

Conclusions reached from models of the growth trajectories of 30 sub-Saharan economies over the period 1990&amp;ndash;2025 were that the economic growth rates of these countries would be between 0.56 and 1.47% lower. The impact on [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) per capita was less conclusive. However, in 2000, the rate of growth of Africa's per capita GDP was in fact reduced by 0.7% per year from 1990&amp;ndash;1997 with a further 0.3% per year lower in countries also affected by [[malaria]].&lt;ref name="Bonnel"&gt;{{cite journal

| doi=10.1111/j.1813-6982.2000.tb01282.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forecast now is that the growth of GDP for these countries will undergo a further reduction of between 0.5 and 2.6% per annum.&lt;ref name="Greener"/&gt; However, these estimates may be an underestimate, as they do not look at the effects on output [[per capita]].&lt;ref name="Bell-et-al-2003"&gt;{{

==Response in sub-Saharan Africa==
Many governments in sub-Saharan Africa denied that there was a problem for years, and are only now starting to work towards solutions. Underfunding is a problem in all areas of HIV prevention when compared to even conservative estimates of the problems.

Recent research by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI) has suggested that the private sector has begun to recognize the impact of HIV/AIDS on the bottom line, both directly and indirectly. It is estimated that a company can generate an average return of US$3 for every US$1 invested in employee health due to a reduced absenteeism, better productivity and reduction in employee turnover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The launching of the world's first official HIV/AIDS Toolkit in [[Zimbabwe]] on October 3, 2006 is a product of collaborative work between the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]], [[World Health Organization]] and the [[South Africa|Southern Africa]] HIV/AIDS Information Dissemination Service. It is for the strengthening of people living with HIV/AIDS and nurses by minimal external support. The package, which is in form of eight modules focusing on basic facts about HIV and AIDS, was pre-tested in Zimbabwe in March 2006 to determine its adaptability. It disposes, among other things, categorized guidelines on clinical management, education and counseling of AIDS victims at community level.&lt;ref name="xinhua"&gt;{{

==Copenhagen Consensus==
The [[Copenhagen Consensus]] is a project that seeks to establish priorities for advancing global welfare using methodologies based on the theory of [[welfare economics]]. The participants are all economists, with the focus of the projg a rational prioritization based on economic analysis. The project is based on the contention that, in spite of the billions of dollars spent on global challenges by the United Nations, the governments of wealthy nations, foundations, charities, and non-governmental organizations, the money spent on problems such as malnutrition and climate change is not sufficient to meet many internationally agreed targets. The highest priority was assigned to implementing new measures to prevent the spread of HIV and AIDS. The economists estimated that an investment of $27&amp;nbsp;billion could avert nearly 30&amp;nbsp;million new infections by 2010.&lt;ref name="Kaiserfunds"&gt;{{

==Life==
Dr. Harvold received his degrees in Medicine and Dentistry in Germany and Norway respectively. He practiced as an Orthodontist in 1937 in Norway. After few years of practicing Orthodontics, he received his Ph.D in Anatomy from [[Oslo, Norway]]. Because of his interested in Cleft Lip &amp; Palate and other craniofacial anomalies, he became interested in becoming a research fellow at a dental institute in Oslo. He eventually came to [[University of Michigan]] for teaching for couple years. After then, he went to [[University of Toronto]] in 1959, where he became a Professor and Head of Orthodontic Department until 1961.

In 1963, he headed off to [[University of California, San Francisco]] where he became the Director of Center of Craniofacial Anomalies until his retirement in 1980. Dr. Harvold's research focused on interrelationship between genetic and environmental factors in development of head an face.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = University of California: In Memoriam, 1993|url = http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb0h4n99rb&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00029&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=|website = texts.cdlib.org|accessdate = 2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Exercise is Medicine®''' '''(EIM)''' is a nonprofit initiative co-launched by the [[American College of Sports Medicine]] (ACSM) and the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA), with support from the Office of the Surgeon General and the 18th Surgeon General Regina Benjamin, on November 5, 2007.

==Overview &amp; history==
The Exercise is Medicine (EIM) initiative calls for [[physical activity]] to be included as a standard part of medical treatment and the patient care process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lobelo|first=Felipe|last2=Stoutenberg|first2=Mark|last3=Hutber|first3=Adrian|date=December 2014|title=The Exercise is Medicine Global Health Initiative: a 2014 update|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=48|issue=22|pages=1627–1633|doi=10.1136/bjsports-2013-093080|issn=1473-0480|pmid=24759911}}&lt;/ref&gt; EIM urges healthcare providers to assess the physical activity levels of their patients at every visit, provide physically inactive patients with brief counseling, and to 'write' a basic exercise prescription. Before leaving the clinic setting, inactive patients should also receive a referral to available physical activity resources in the local community to assist them in becoming more physically active.

EIM was started by then ACSM President Robert E. Sallis, MD, FACSM in 2007, who has continued to serve as the Chair of the EIM initiative since its inception. Under the guidance of Dr. Sallis and the EIM Advisory Board, Adrian Hutber, PhD, served as the first Vice President of EIM and has overseen the global development of the initiative over its first decade of existence. From 2007-2017, EIM grew into a "global health" initiative with a presence in more than 40 countries worldwide. The initial five years of the initiative focused on increasing global awareness that "exercise is good medicine".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pedersen|first=B.

1. The first step, and initiator, of the EIM Solution is the systematic ''assessment'' of every patient's physical activity levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sallis|first=Robert E.|last2=Matuszak|first2=Jason M.|last3=Baggish|first3=Aaron L.|last4=Franklin|first4=Barry A.|last5=Chodzko-Zajko|first5=Wojtek|last6=Fletcher|first6=Barbara J.|last7=Gregory|first7=Andrew|last8=Joy|first8=Elizabeth|last9=Matheson|first9=Gordon|date=May 2016|title=Call to Action on Making Physical Activity Assessment and Prescription a Medical Standard of Care|journal=Current Sports Medicine Reports|volume=15|issue=3|pages=207–214|doi=10.1249/JSR.0000000000000249|issn=1537-8918|pmid=27172086}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Physical Activity Vital Sign (PAVS) is an evidence- and practice-based tool for assessing patient physical activity levels that has been successfully integrated into the Kaiser Permanente health systems of Northern&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coleman|first=Karen Jacqueline|last2=Ngor|first2=Eunis|last3=Reynolds|first3=Kristi|last4=Quinn|first4=Virginia P.|last5=Koebnick|first5=Corinna|last6=Young|first6=Deborah Rohm|last7=Sternfeld|first7=Barbara|last8=Sallis|first8=Robert E.|date=November 2012|title=Initial validation of an exercise "vital sign" in electronic medical records|journal=Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise|volume=44|issue=11|pages=2071–2076|doi=10.1249/MSS.0b013e3182630ec1|issn=1530-0315|pmid=22688832}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Southern&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Deborah Rohm|last2=Coleman|first2=Karen J.|last3=Ngor|first3=Eunis|last4=Reynolds|first4=Kristi|last5=Sidell|first5=Margo|last6=Sallis|first6=Robert E.|date=2014-12-18|title=Associations between physical activity and cardiometabolic risk factors assessed in a Southern California health care system, 2010-2012|journal=Preventing Chronic Disease|volume=11|pages=E219|doi=10.5888/pcd11.140196|issn=1545-1151|pmc=4273545|pmid=25523350}}&lt;/ref&gt; California, as well as in [[Intermountain Healthcare|Intermountain Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ball|first=Trever J.|last2=Joy|first2=Elizabeth A.|last3=Gren|first3=Lisa H.|last4=Shaw|first4=Janet M.|date=2016-02-04|title=Concurrent Validity of a Self-Reported Physical Activity "Vital Sign" Questionnaire With Adult Primary Care Patients|journal=Preventing Chronic Disease|volume=13|pages=E16|doi=10.5888/pcd13.150228|issn=1545-1151|pmc=4747440|pmid=26851335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. The second step of the EIM Solution provides eligible patients (i.e., patients who are not completing 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity in a week) with a basic ''physical activity prescription''. Prescriptions can be given out in a number of different formats including written exercise prescriptions using a pad (a format that patients are familiar with in receiving prescriptions for medications) to semi-customized physical activity prescriptions for specific health conditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exerciseismedicine.org/support_page.php/your-rx-for-health-series/&lt;/ref&gt; The first major exercise prescription program was the [http://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/preventative-health-wellness/physical-activity/green-prescriptions Green Prescription] started by the Sport and Recreation New Zealand in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elley|first=C.

3. In addition to giving a physical activity prescription, healthcare providers may also wish to provide their patients with ''brief physical activity counseling''.

Within the community setting, all physical activity places (i.e., YMCAs), programs, and exercise professionals should be considered for inclusion in a larger physical activity network.

==Exercise is Medicine in Action==

'''Exercise is Medicine on Campus''' (EIM-OC) is a program calling upon universities and colleges to engage in promoting physical activity as a vital sign on college and university campuses. EIM-OC encourages faculty, staff and students to work together toward improving the health and well-being of the campus community by: a) assessing physical activity at every student health visit, b) providing students with the tools necessary to strengthen healthy physical activity habits, and c) connecting university health care providers with campus exercise specialists to provide a referral system for exercise prescription. Currently, there are more than 150 registered EIM-OC campus program in the U.S., with an equal number of international programs.

The '''Exercise is Medicine Credential''' is a specialized designation earned by exercise professionals who work closely with the health care sector. The EIM Credential prepares exercise professionals to work as an extended part of the health care team and effectively collaborate with health care providers. Through this partnership, a closer relationship and line of communication is developed to assist patients who need specialized fitness programming in order to change their health behaviors and improve health outcomes.

The month of May has been designated as '''Exercise is Medicine Month''' to bring awareness to and focus on the issue of physical inactivity - one of the fastest growing public health concerns. Local communities are encouraged to celebrate EIM Month by hosting events that highlight collaborations between health systems and the local community.

==EIM Supporters==
Numerous health and professional organizations have signed on in partnership of the Exercise is Medicine initiative including: the [[American Council on Exercise|American Council on Exercise (ACE)]], the [[American Physical Therapy Association|American Physical Therapy Association (APTA)]], the Foundation for Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation (FPM&amp;R), the Medical Fitness Association (MFA), and the Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association (PCNA).

==The EIM Global Health Network==
Over its first decade of existence, EIM has expanded to include partners in more than 40 countries worldwide. The EIM Global Health Network consists of EIM Regional Centers in Chile (EIM Latin America), Germany (EIM Europe), and Singapore (EIM Southeast Asia) that help oversee the expansion and development of the initiative in their respective regions.

To establish an EIM National Center, national leaders in a country are required to enlist the support of a national primary care organization, a national sports medicine and/or exercise science organization, as well a leading academic institution. It is also strongly encouraged that the national ministry of health is also invited to participate as a part of the National Center. The National Center is host by a national institution (an academic institution, health organization, or other non-profit organization) under the direction of a National Center Director, acting on behalf of the National Center Advisory Board.

EIM National Centers have been formally established in the following countries:

It was invented in 1696 by Claes Tilly and was marketed as a cure for many ailments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Samuel |last=North |entry=Haarlem oil |title=The family physician and guide to health, together with some remarks on surgery |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YH8XAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA303 |year=1830 |place=Waterloo, NY |publisher=Wm. Child |pp=303–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''haarlemmerolie'' (with a lowercase 'h') is now used in Dutch to indicate a fix for all problems. For example: "lowering taxes will be like haarlemmerolie for the economy". This is also used sarcastically.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

'''Healing the ear of a servant''' is one of the [[miracles of Jesus in the Gospels]].&lt;ref&gt;Bauckham, Richard (2006).

Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. p. 195. {{ISBN|0-8028-3162-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the incident of the servant's ear being cut off is recorded in all four [[gospels]], {{bibleverse||Matthew|26:51|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Mark|14:47|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Luke|22:51|KJV}}; and {{bibleref2|John|18:10-11|9|John 18:10&amp;ndash;11}};  the servant and the disciple are named as [[Malchus]] and [[Simon Peter]] only in John. Only Luke records that Jesus healed the servant.

The [[Gospel of Luke]] (22:49-51) describes Jesus healing the servant of a high priest during the [[Arrest of Jesus]] after one of the followers of Jesus had cut his right ear off:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When Jesus' followers saw what was going to happen, they said, "Lord, should we strike with our swords?" And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. But Jesus answered, "No more of this!" And he touched the man's ear and healed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Bible Gateway|title=Luke 22:49-51 NIV|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2022:49-51&amp;version=NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This healing episode follows [[the kiss of Judas]] and is the last miracle reported in the [[Canonical Gospel]]s prior to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]].

Health care in [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]] is administered by both private and public health care providers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/news/1061601/integrated-healthcare Integrated healthcare]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Health care]] is the diagnosis, [[Medical case management|treatment]], and prevention of [[disease]], [[illness]], injury, and other [[disability|physical and mental impairments]] in human beings.

==Public health care==
Health care in [[Pakistan]] is mostly private where the government provides a small amount of the total health expenditures, with the remainder being entirely private, out-of-pocket expenses. Health care delivery in Pakistan on the other hand, is the worst of both worlds; not only the health care delivery is predominantly private there are no watchdog bodies, agencies or audit commissions to monitor quality. The result is a thriving private practice; which is unregulated and unmonitored. The majority of clinicians in the city of [[Karachi]] are practising without any accountability and are not answerable to any higher authority. More than often complex procedures are undertaken in clinics and smaller hospitals, which are unequipped to deal with complications. Health and safety regulations simply do not exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpma.org.pk/full_article_text.php?article_id=1537 Health care delivery in Karachi - The worst of both worlds]&lt;/ref&gt; honey yes

'''Herbal cigarettes''' (also called '''tobacco-free cigarettes''' or '''nicotine-free cigarettes''') are [[cigarette]]s that usually do not contain any [[tobacco]], instead being composed of a mixture of various [[herb]]s and/or other plant material.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/background_briefings/smoking/272145.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Alert over herbal cigarettes |date=February 5, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chinese herbal cigarettes contain tobacco and nicotine with herbs added, unlike European and North American herbal cigarettes which have tobacco and nicotine omitted.&lt;ref name="cebp"&gt;[http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/18/12/3497 "Chinese 'Herbal' Cigarettes are as Carcinogenic and Addictive as Regular Cigarettes."] ''Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention'', 18(12) December, 2009,&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[herbal smokeless tobacco]], they are often used as a substitute for standard [[tobacco]] products (primarily cigarettes).{{cn|date=November 2015}} Herbal cigarettes are considered a "non-smoking aid."&lt;ref name="tox"&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4395654/ "Safety Assessment of Mainstream Smoke of Herbal Cigarette"]. ''Toxicological Research'', 31(1) March, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; European countries advertise herbal cigarettes as a cessation smoking aid.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Herbal cigarettes are also used in acting scenes by performers who are non-smokers, or—as is becoming increasingly common—where anti-smoking legislation prohibits the use of tobacco in public spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/8223836/Rufus-Sewell-interview.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Craig |last=McLean |title=Rufus Sewell interview |date=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/blogs/the-human-condition/2009/09/25/will-the-herbal-cigarette-ban-make-a-quitter-out-of-don-draper.html |title=Will the Herbal-Cigarette Ban Make a Quitter Out of Don Draper? |website=The Daily Beast |date=2009-09-25 |accessdate=2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fiona Byrne |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2008/09/jon_hamm_on.html |title='Mad Men' Star Jon Hamm on Smoking Clove Cigarettes – Vulture |website=New York |date=September 4, 2008 |accessdate=2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbal cigarettes can carry [[carcinogens]] which can have health implications.&lt;ref name="tox" /&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:Herbal Dhoompan.jpg|thumb|Nirdosh herb, Herbal Dhoompan cigarettes]]

===Paper and filter===
Herbal cigarettes are most often made using standard-issue [[rolling paper]]s and [[cigarette filters]].

===Herbal blend===
A wide range of consumable products may be used as a filling, in lieu of tobacco. [[Corn]] silk and a number of flavorful herbs, such as [[mentha|mint]], [[cinnamon]] or [[lemongrass]], have been utilized by a wide number of herbal cigarette producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Dennis |url=http://www.everydayhealth.com/stop-smoking/herbal-and-natural-cigarettes.aspx |title=Are Herbal and "Natural" Cigarettes Safer? - Smoking Cessation Center |website=EverydayHealth.com |date=2011-08-31 |accessdate=2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other manufacturers have included non-herbs like [[rose]] petals or [[clover]] leaves. Some use the flavorless [[bagasse]] and make the herbal cigarette depend on the flavoring; this is especially common in [[Mu‘assel|shisha]]. Some are made with dried [[lettuce]] leaves or shredded [[cabbage]] leaves.

===Toxic chemicals===
* [[Tar (tobacco residue)|Tar]]: The tar level was found at 5.5 mg/cig, which was higher than the package indicated.&lt;ref name="tox" /&gt; In Korea, a study found that tar levels were higher than the tolerance range set by the Korean tobacco business law. Chinese herbal cigarettes were found to have the same amount of tar as regular cigarettes.&lt;ref name="cebp" /&gt;
* [[Carbon monoxide]] (CO): In a Korean study there was carbon monoxide detected at 12.30 ± 0.30 mg/cig.&lt;ref name="tox" /&gt; Vegetable based herbal cigarettes can produce carbon monoxide equivalent to regular cigarettes.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;
*[[Aromatic amine]]s: [[4-aminobiphenyl]], a [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|group 1 carcinogen]], was marginally higher in herbal cigarettes than in regular cigarettes and [[1-Naphthylamine|1-aminonaphthalene]], [[2-Naphthylamine|2-aminonaphthalene]], and [[3-aminobiphenyl]] was lower in herbal cigarettes than in regular cigarettes.&lt;ref name="tox" /&gt;
*[[Smoke]] [[condensation|condensate]]:  The [[mutagen]]ic aspect of the smoke condensate of herbal cigarettes is similar to regular cigarettes.&lt;ref name="tox" /&gt;

==Health effects==
Research shows that herbal cigarettes compared with regular cigarettes can be just as harmful in terms of the [[carcinogens]] they carry.&lt;ref name="tox" /&gt; Dr. John Moore-Gillan, chairman of the British Lung Foundation, states the addictive qualities to herbal cigarettes may be taken out, however other harmful elements remain.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; A study on Chinese herbal cigarettes found they had about the same amount of carcinogens as regular cigarettes.&lt;ref name="cebp" /&gt; There are toxic components of the smoke of herbal cigarettes which are similar to regular cigarettes.&lt;ref name="tox" /&gt; Aminobiphenyl can cause bladder cancer.&lt;ref name="tox" /&gt; CO can be fatal in "low concentration of approximately 667 μg/mL."&lt;ref name="tox" /&gt; CO can cause coronary artery disease as well.&lt;ref name="tox" /&gt; Short term symptoms of CO include headaches, dizziness, irritability and difficulty breathing.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

==Herbal cigarettes in different countries==

===China===
The Chinese Tobacco industry markets herbal cigarettes as having health benefits, yet scientific studies show there is no difference to peoples' health between Chinese herbal cigarette brands and regular cigarette brands.&lt;ref name="cebp" /&gt; Chinese cigarette brands are equally as addictive as regular cigarettes, although they are marketed as healthier.&lt;ref name="cebp" /&gt; Chinese herbal cigarettes are sold in Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia, Myanmar, Canada, and Taiwan.&lt;ref name="cebp" /&gt; People observed in a study showed they smoked more herbal cigarettes than regular cigarettes.&lt;ref name="cebp" /&gt; Herbal cigarettes started in the 1970s and became popular in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="cebp" /&gt; Two of the biggest herbal brands in China, Jinsheng and Wuyeshen, sold 1%, or 20 billion cigarettes, of all cigarettes sold in China in 2008.&lt;ref name="cebp" /&gt;

===Korea===
In Korea regular cigarette prices have risen making herbal cigarettes a more popular smoking alternative.&lt;ref name="tox" /&gt; Evidence shows people in Korea choose to use herbal cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid.&lt;ref name="tox" /&gt; Sales of herbal cigarettes increased by 118% in 2014.&lt;ref name="tox" /&gt;

===United States===
A study investigating smokers' perception on cigarette products thought of as "less harmful" than regular cigarettes found 3.3 % named herbal cigarettes, which was higher than medical nicotine at 2.4%.&lt;ref&gt;[doi: 10.1016/j.amepre.2005.04.013 "Smoker Awareness of and Beliefs About Supposedly Less-Harmful Tobacco Products"]. ''American Journal of Preventive Medicine'', 29(2) August, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{third-party|section|date=February 2017}}
Originating from the United Kingdom in 1947, the seemingly{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} oldest brand of herbal cigarettes are Honeyrose and Black Swan; they are currently sold worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tobaccodocuments.org/bw/1178391.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102091847/http://tobaccodocuments.org/bw/1178391.html |date=January 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honeyrose.co.uk/prod.html |accessdate=January 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230051651/http://www.honeyrose.co.uk/prod.html |archivedate=December 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SpanishFluWardWalterReed.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Influenza ward at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed Hospital]], in Washington, D.C. during the [[Spanish flu]] pandemic of 1918–1919.]]

An '''influenza pandemic''' is an [[epidemic]] of an [[influenza]] virus that spreads on a worldwide scale and infects a large proportion of the [[world population]]. In contrast to the regular seasonal epidemics of influenza, these [[pandemic]]s occur irregularly&amp;nbsp;– there have been about 9 influenza pandemics during the last 300 years. Pandemics can cause high levels of mortality, with the [[1918 flu pandemic|1918 Spanish influenza pandemic]] being the worst in recorded history; this pandemic was estimated to be responsible for the deaths of approximately 50–100&amp;nbsp;million people. There have been about three influenza pandemics in each century for the last 300 years, the most recent one being the [[2009 flu pandemic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nicholls H |title=Pandemic influenza: the inside story |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=e50 |year=2006 |pmid=16464130 |pmc=1363710 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenza pandemics occur when a new strain of the influenza virus is transmitted to humans from another animal species. Species that are thought to be important in the emergence of new human strains are pigs, chickens and ducks. These novel strains are unaffected by any [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] people may have to older strains of human influenza and can therefore spread extremely rapidly and infect very large numbers of people. [[Influenza A virus]]es can occasionally be transmitted from wild birds to other species causing outbreaks in domestic poultry and may give rise to human influenza pandemics.&lt;ref name=sobrino6&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/avir|author=Klenk|year=2008|chapter=Avian Influenza: Molecular Mechanisms of Pathogenesis and Host Range|title=Animal Viruses: Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn=978-1-904455-22-6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kawaoka&gt;{{cite book | editor=Kawaoka Y | title = Influenza Virology: Current Topics | publisher=Caister Academic Press | year = 2006 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/flu | id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/flu  ] | isbn = 1-904455-06-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The propagation of influenza viruses throughout the world is thought in part to be by bird migrations, though commercial shipments of live bird products might also be implicated, as well as human travel patterns.

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has produced a six-stage classification that describes the process by which a novel influenza virus moves from the first few infections in humans through to a pandemic. This starts with the virus mostly infecting animals, with a few cases where animals infect people, then moves through the stage where the virus begins to spread directly between people, and ends with a pandemic when infections from the new virus have spread worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/ Current WHO phase of pandemic alert] ''World Health Organization'' 2009  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928032422/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/ |date=28 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One strain of virus that may produce a pandemic in the future is a highly [[pathogen]]ic variation of the [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1|H5N1]] subtype of [[influenza A virus]]. On 11 June 2009, a new strain of [[Pandemic H1N1/09 virus|H1N1]] influenza was declared to be a global pandemic (Stage 6) by the WHO after evidence of spreading in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. World now at the start of 2009 influenza pandemic. http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2009/h1n1_pandemic_phase6_20090611/en/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The 13 November 2009 worldwide update by the WHO stated that "[a]s of 8 November 2009, worldwide more than 206 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported [503,536] laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 6,250 deaths."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/don/2009_11_13/en/index.html |title=Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 – update 74 |date=13 November 2009 |work=Situation updates – Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While sometimes confused with the [[common cold]], influenza is a much more severe disease and is caused by a different type of virus.&lt;ref name=Eccles&gt;{{cite journal | last = Eccles | first = R | title = Understanding the symptoms of the common cold and influenza | journal=[[The Lancet Infectious Diseases]] | volume = 5 | issue = 11 | pages = 718–25 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16253889 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(05)70270-X | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although nausea and vomiting can be produced, especially in children,&lt;ref name=Merck/&gt; these symptoms are more characteristic of the unrelated [[gastroenteritis]], which is sometimes called "stomach flu" or "24-hour flu."&lt;ref&gt;[http://coldflu.about.com/od/flumisconceptions/f/stomachflu.htm Seasonal Flu vs. Stomach Flu] by Kristina Duda, R.N.; accessed 12 March 2007 (Website: "About, Inc., A part of The New York Times Company")&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, influenza is transmitted from infected mammals through the air by coughs or sneezes, creating [[particulate|aerosols]] containing the virus, and from infected birds through their [[feces|droppings]].  Influenza can also be transmitted by [[saliva]], [[mucus|nasal secretions]], feces and blood.  Healthy individuals can become infected if they breathe in a virus-laden aerosol directly, or if they touch their eyes, nose or mouth after touching any of the aforementioned bodily fluids (or surfaces contaminated with those fluids). Flu viruses can remain infectious for about one week at human body temperature, over 30 days at 0&amp;nbsp;°C (32&amp;nbsp;°F), and indefinitely at very low temperatures (such as lakes in northeast [[Siberia]]). Most influenza strains can be inactivated easily by [[disinfectant]]s and [[detergent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Suarez DL, Spackman E, Senne DA, Bulaga L, Welsch AC, Froberg K |title=The effect of various disinfectants on detection of avian influenza virus by real time RT-PCR |journal=Avian Dis. |volume=47 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=1091–95 |year=2003 |pmid=14575118 |doi=10.1637/0005-2086-47.s3.1091 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/biofacts/avflu_human.html  Avian Influenza (Bird Flu)]: Implications for Human Disease.

Flu spreads around the world in seasonal epidemics. Three influenza [[pandemics]] occurred in the 20th century and killed tens of millions of people, with each of these pandemics being caused by the appearance of a new [[strain (biology)|strain]] of the virus in humans. Often, these new strains result from the spread of an existing flu virus to humans from other animal [[species]]. When it first killed humans in Asia in the 1990s, a deadly avian strain of H5N1 posed a great risk for a new influenza pandemic; however, this virus did not [[mutation|mutate]] to spread easily between people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Avian influenza ("bird flu") fact sheet | url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/avian_influenza/en/ |date=February 2006 | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] | accessdate=20 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vaccination]]s against influenza are most commonly given to high-risk humans in industrialized countries&lt;ref name=WHOvaccines&gt;

[[Antiviral drug]]s can be used to treat influenza, with [[neuraminidase inhibitor]]s being particularly effective.

==Variants and subtypes of Influenzavirus A==
{{Main|Influenzavirus A}}
Variants of [[Influenzavirus A]] are identified and named according to the isolate that they are like and thus are presumed to share lineage (example [[Fujian flu]] virus like); according to their typical host (example [[Human flu]] virus); according to their subtype (example [[H3N2]]); and according to their deadliness (example LP). So a flu from a virus similar to the  isolate A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2) is called Fujian flu, human flu, and H3N2 flu.

[[File:Influenza subtypes.svg|thumb|right|375px|The various types of [[influenza]] viruses in humans. Solid squares show the appearance of a new strain, causing recurring influenza pandemics. Broken lines indicate uncertain strain identifications.&lt;ref name=Palese&gt;{{cite journal |author=Palese P |title=Influenza: old and new threats |journal=[[Nature Medicine]] |volume=10 |issue=12 Suppl |pages=S82–87 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15577936 |doi=10.1038/nm1141 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Variants are sometimes named according to the species (host) the strain is endemic in or adapted to. Some variants named using this convention are:&lt;ref&gt;See the articles for references that use these names.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Avian influenza|Bird Flu]]
* [[Human flu|Human Flu]]
* [[Swine flu|Swine Flu]]
* [[Horse flu|Horse Flu]]
* [[Dog flu|Dog Flu]]

Avian variants have also sometimes been named according to their deadliness in poultry, especially chickens:
* Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI)
* Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), also called: deadly flu or death flu

The Influenza A virus subtypes are labeled according to an H number (for [[hemagglutinin]]) and an N number (for [[neuraminidase]]). Each subtype virus has [[mutate]]d into a variety of strains with differing [[pathogenic]] profiles; some pathogenic to one species but not others, some pathogenic to multiple species. Most known strains are extinct strains. For example, the annual flu subtype H3N2 no longer contains the strain that caused the [[Hong Kong Flu]].&lt;ref name=Harder&gt;{{cite book |author1=Harder, T.

Influenza A viruses are negative sense, single-stranded, segmented [[RNA virus]]es. "There are 16 different HA [[antigen]]s (H1 to H16) and nine different NA [[antigen]]s (N1 to N9) for influenza A.

==Nature of a flu pandemic==
Some pandemics are relatively minor such as [[H2N2|the one in 1957 called "Asian flu"]] (1–4&amp;nbsp;million dead, depending on source). Others have a higher [[Pandemic Severity Index]] whose severity warrants more comprehensive social isolation measures.&lt;ref name=CIDRAP&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/panflu/news/feb0107pandemic.html|accessdate=3 February 2007|date=1 February 2007|last=Roos|first=Robert|author2=Lisa Schnirring|title=HHS ties pandemic mitigation advice to severity|publisher=[[University of Minnesota]] Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1918 pandemic killed tens of millions and sickened hundreds of millions; the loss of this many people in the population caused upheaval and psychological damage to many people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | editor-link = Institute of Medicine  | veditors=Knobler SL, Mack A, Mahmoud A, Lemon SM  | title = The Threat of Pandemic Influenza: Are We Ready?

&lt;/ref&gt; There were not enough doctors, hospital rooms, or medical supplies for the living as they contracted the disease. Dead bodies were  often left unburied as few people were available to deal with them. There can be great social disruption as well as a sense of fear. Efforts to deal with pandemics can leave a great deal to be desired because of human selfishness, lack of trust, illegal behavior, and ignorance. For example, in the 1918 pandemic: "This horrific disconnect between reassurances and reality destroyed the credibility of those in authority. People felt they had no one to turn to, no one to rely on, no one to trust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | editor-link = Institute of Medicine  | veditors=Knobler SL, Mack A, Mahmoud A, Lemon SM  | title = The Threat of Pandemic Influenza: Are We Ready?

A letter from a physician at one U.S. Army camp in the 1918 pandemic said:

:It is only a matter of a few hours then until death comes [...]. It is horrible. One can stand it to see one, two or twenty men die, but to see these poor devils dropping like flies [...]. We have been averaging about 100 deaths per day [...]. Pneumonia means in about all cases death [...]. We have lost an outrageous number of Nurses and Drs. It takes special trains to carry away the dead. For several days there were no coffins and the bodies piled up something fierce [...].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | editor-link = Institute of Medicine  | veditors=Knobler SL, Mack A, Mahmoud A, Lemon SM  | title = The Threat of Pandemic Influenza: Are We Ready?

===Wave nature===
Flu pandemics typically come in waves. The 1889–1890 and 1918–1919 flu pandemics each came in three or four waves of increasing lethality.&lt;ref name=Knobler&gt;{{cite book  | editor-link = Institute of Medicine  | title = The Threat of Pandemic Influenza: Are We Ready?

===Variable mortality===
Mortality varies widely in a pandemic. In the 1918 pandemic:

:In U.S. Army camps where reasonably reliable statistics were kept, case mortality often exceeded 5 percent, and in some circumstances exceeded 10 percent. In the British Army in India, case mortality for white troops was 9.6 percent, for Indian troops 21.9 percent. In isolated human populations, the virus killed at even higher rates. In the Fiji islands, it killed 14 percent of the entire population in 16 days. In Labrador and Alaska, it killed at least one-third of the entire native population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | editor-link = Institute of Medicine  | veditors=Knobler SL, Mack A, Mahmoud A, Lemon SM  | title = The Threat of Pandemic Influenza: Are We Ready?

===Spanish flu (1918–1920)===
{{Main|Spanish flu}}
The 1918 flu pandemic, commonly referred to as the [[Spanish flu]], was a [[Pandemic Severity Index|category 5]] influenza pandemic caused by an unusually severe and deadly [[Influenza A virus]] [[Strain (biology)|strain]] of subtype [[H1N1]].

The Spanish flu pandemic lasted from 1918 to 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Price-Smith, Contagion and Chaos (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press,2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Older estimates say it killed 40–50&amp;nbsp;million people&lt;ref name=Patterson1&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Patterson KD, Pyle GF |title=The geography and mortality of the 1918 influenza pandemic |journal=Bull Hist Med |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=4–21 |year=1991 |pmid=2021692}}&lt;/ref&gt; while current estimates say 50&amp;nbsp;million to 100&amp;nbsp;million people worldwide were killed.&lt;ref name=Knobler/&gt; This pandemic has been described as "the greatest medical holocaust in history" and may have killed as many people as the [[Black Death]],&lt;ref name=Potter&gt;{{cite journal | last =Potter | first = CW| title=A History of Influenza | url= http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-2672.2001.01492.x | journal=J Appl Microbiol |date=October 2006 |volume=91 |issue= 4 | pages = 572–79 | pmid = 11576290| doi=10.1046/j.1365-2672.2001.01492.x | ref =harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the Black Death is estimated to have killed over a fifth of the world's population at the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/worldhis.html |title=Historical Estimates of World Population |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=3 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; a significantly higher proportion. This huge death toll was caused by an extremely high infection rate of up to 50% and the extreme severity of the symptoms, suspected to be caused by [[cytokine storm]]s.&lt;ref name=Patterson1/&gt; Indeed, symptoms in 1918 were so unusual that initially influenza was misdiagnosed as dengue, [[cholera]], or typhoid. One observer wrote, "One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from mucous membranes, especially from the nose, stomach, and intestine. Bleeding from the ears and [[petechia|petechial hemorrhages]] in the skin also occurred."&lt;ref name=Knobler/&gt; The majority of deaths were from [[bacterial pneumonia]], a [[secondary infection]] caused by influenza, but the virus also killed people directly, causing massive [[bleeding|hemorrhages]] and [[edema]] in the lung.&lt;ref name="pmid11779381"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Taubenberger JK, Reid AH, Janczewski TA, Fanning TG |title=Integrating historical, clinical and molecular genetic data in order to explain the origin and virulence of the 1918 Spanish influenza virus |journal=Philos.

The Spanish flu pandemic was truly global, spreading even to the [[Arctic]] and remote Pacific islands. The unusually severe disease killed between 2 and 20% of those infected, as opposed to the more usual flu epidemic [[mortality rate]] of 0.1%.&lt;ref name=Knobler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Taubenberger/&gt; Another unusual feature of this pandemic was that it mostly killed young adults, with 99% of pandemic influenza deaths occurring in people under 65, and more than half in young adults 20 to 40 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Simonsen L, Clarke MJ, Schonberger LB, Arden NH, Cox NJ, Fukuda K  | title = Pandemic versus epidemic influenza mortality: a pattern of changing age distribution | journal=J Infect Dis | volume = 178 | issue = 1 | pages = 53–60 |date=July 1998 | pmid = 9652423 | ref = harv | doi=10.1086/515616}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is unusual since influenza is normally most deadly to the very young (under age 2) and the very old (over age 70). The total mortality of the 1918–1919 pandemic is not known, but it is estimated that up to 1% of the world's population was killed. As many as 25&amp;nbsp;million may have been killed in the first 25 weeks; in contrast, [[AIDS|HIV/AIDS]] has killed 25&amp;nbsp;million in its first 25 years.&lt;ref name=Knobler/&gt;

The Hong Kong Flu was a [[Pandemic Severity Index|category 2]] [[flu pandemic]] caused by a strain of H3N2 descended from [[H2N2]] by [[antigenic shift]], in which genes from multiple subtypes reassorted to form a new virus. The Hong Kong Flu pandemic of 1968 and 1969 killed an estimated  one million people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paul|first=William E. |title=Fundamental Immunology|pages=1273|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oPSG1PGmZUkC|isbn=0-306-44407-0|year=1993|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/usandworld/43705182.html|title=World health group issues alert Mexican president tries to isolate those with swine flu|date=25 April 2009|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=26 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/2009/04/26/9248411-sun.html|title=No need to panic ... yet Ontario officials are worried swine flu could be pandemic, killing thousands|last=Mandel|first=Michael|date=26 April 2009|publisher=Toronto Sun|accessdate=26 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those over 65 had the greatest death rates.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; In the US, there were about 33,800 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, http://www.pandemicflu.gov/general/historicaloverview.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian Flu (1977–1978)===
In 1977, a strain of H1N1 appeared. It was a "benign" pandemic, primarily affecting people born after 1950, because the older generation had protective immunity resulting from prior experience with H1N1 strains. The 1977 virus was similar to other A/H1N1 viruses that had circulated prior to 1957. The virus was included in the 1978–79 vaccine.

===H1N1/09 Flu Pandemic (2009–2010)===
{{Main|2009 flu pandemic}}
An epidemic of influenza-like illness of unknown causation occurred in [[2009 flu pandemic in Mexico|Mexico in March–April 2009]]. On 24 April 2009, following the isolation of an A/H1N1 influenza in 7 ill patients in the southwest US. The [[WHO]] issued a statement on the outbreak of "influenza like illness" in the confirmed cases of A/H1N1 influenza had been reported in Mexico, and that 20 confirmed cases of the disease had been reported in the US.The next day, the number of confirmed cases rose to 40 in the US, 26 in Mexico, 6 in Canada, and 1 in Spain. The disease spread rapidly through the rest of the spring, and by 3 May, a total of 787 confirmed cases had been reported worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/don/2009_05_03/en/index.html|title= Influenza A(H1N1) – update 11|publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 11 June 2009, the ongoing outbreak of Influenza A/H1N1, commonly referred to as "swine flu", was officially declared by the WHO to be the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century and a [[2009 A/H1N1|new strain]] of [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1]] first identified in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jTkkEKE5LtPih_5Jcc-3MpD0gOYQD98OH0U00 |title=WHO: Swine flu pandemic has begun, 1st in 41 years |date=11 June 2009 |accessdate=11 June 2009 |publisher=The Associated Press |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614173823/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jTkkEKE5LtPih_5Jcc-3MpD0gOYQD98OH0U00 |archivedate=14 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought to be a [[mutation]] (reassortment) of four known strains of [[influenza A virus]] subtype H1N1: one [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in humans, one endemic in birds, and two endemic in pigs (swine).&lt;ref name="NewSci-20090424-pandemic"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17025-deadly-new-flu-virus-in-us-and-mexico-may-go-pandemic.html |title=Deadly new flu virus in U.S. and Mexico may go pandemic |work=[[New Scientist]] |date=28 April 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gNd9HTT9?url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17025-deadly-new-flu-virus-in-us-and-mexico-may-go-pandemic.html |archivedate=28 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid spread of this new virus was likely due to a general lack of pre-existing antibody-mediated immunity in the human population.&lt;ref&gt;

On 1 November 2009, a worldwide update by the WHO stated that "199 countries and overseas territories/communities have officially reported a total of over 482,300 laboratory confirmed cases of the influenza pandemic H1N1 infection, that included 6,071 deaths."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/don/2009_10_16/en/index.html Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 – update 70], "As of 1 November 2009 [...] Laboratory-confirmed cases of the pandemic influenza H1N1 as officially reported to the WHO by States Parties to the International Health Regulations (2005)".

==Other pandemic threat subtypes==
"Human influenza virus" usually refers to those subtypes that spread widely among humans. H1N1, [[H1N2]], and H3N2 are the only known Influenza A virus subtypes currently circulating among humans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/facts.htm CDC] ''Key Facts About Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) and Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus''&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic factors in distinguishing between "[[human flu]] viruses" and "avian influenza viruses" include:
:'''PB2''': ([[RNA polymerase]]): [[Amino acid]] (or [[residue (chemistry)|residue]]) position 627 in the PB2 protein encoded by the PB2 [[RNA]] gene. Until [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1|H5N1]], all known avian influenza viruses had a [[Glutamic acid|Glu]] at position 627, while all human influenza viruses had a [[lysine]].
:'''HA''': ([[hemagglutinin]]): Avian influenza HA bind alpha 2–3 [[sialic acid]] receptors while human influenza HA bind alpha 2–6 sialic acid receptors.

"About 52 key genetic changes distinguish avian influenza strains from those that spread easily among people, according to researchers in Taiwan, who analyzed the genes of more than 400 A type flu viruses."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&amp;sid=a6S3ZQwqZkS4&amp;refer=latin_america Bloomberg News] article '' Scientists Move Closer to Understanding Flu Virus Evolution'' published 28 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; "How many mutations would make an avian virus capable of infecting humans efficiently, or how many mutations would render an influenza virus a pandemic strain, is difficult to predict. We have examined sequences from the 1918 strain, which is the only pandemic influenza virus that could be entirely derived from avian strains. Of the 52 species-associated positions, 16 have residues typical for human strains; the others remained as avian signatures. The result supports the hypothesis that the 1918 pandemic virus is more closely related to the avian influenza A virus than are other human influenza viruses."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal  |vauthors=Chen GW, Chang SC, Mok CK, etal | title=Genomic signatures of human versus avian influenza A viruses | journal=Emerging Infect.

Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza kills 50% of humans that catch it. In one case, a boy with H5N1 experienced [[diarrhea]] followed rapidly by a coma without developing respiratory or flu-like symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;

The Influenza A virus subtypes that have been confirmed in humans, ordered by the number of known human pandemic deaths, are:
* H1N1 caused "[[Spanish Flu]]" and the [[2009 swine flu outbreak]] ([[Pandemic H1N1/09 virus|novel H1N1]])
* [[H2N2]] caused "Asian Flu"
* [[H3N2]] caused "Hong Kong Flu"
* [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1|H5N1]] is "bird flu", endemic in avians
* [[H7N7]] has unusual [[zoonotic]] potential
* [[H1N2]] is currently endemic in humans and pigs
* [[H9N2]], [[H7N2]], [[H7N3]], [[H10N7]]

;H1N1
{{main|H1N1|Pandemic H1N1/09 virus}}
H1N1 is currently endemic in both human and pig populations. A variant of H1N1 was responsible for the [[Spanish flu]] [[pandemic]] that killed some 50&amp;nbsp;million to 100&amp;nbsp;million people worldwide over about a year in 1918 and 1919.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/books/0309095042/html/7.html "The Threat of Pandemic Influenza: Are We Ready? Workshop Summary (2005)"] [[National Academies Press|The National Academies Press]], page 7&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy arose in October 2005, after the H1N1 [[genome]] was published in the journal, ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''. Many fear that this information could be used for [[bioterrorism]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.

"When he compared the [[Spanish flu|1918 virus]] with today's human flu viruses, Dr. Taubenberger noticed that it had alterations in just 25 to 30 of the virus's 4,400 amino acids. Those few changes turned a bird virus into a killer that could spread from person to person."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/08/science/08flu.html ''Hazard in Hunt for New Flu: Looking for Bugs in All the Wrong Places''] [[The New York Times]] Published: 8 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-April 2009, an H1N1 variant appeared in Mexico, with its center in Mexico City. By 26 April the variant had spread widely; with cases reported in Canada, the US, New Zealand, the UK, France, Spain and Israel.

;H2N2
{{Main|H2N2}}
The [[Asian Flu]] was a [[pandemic]] outbreak of H2N2 avian influenza that originated in China in 1957, spread worldwide that same year during which an [[influenza vaccine]] was developed, lasted until 1958 and caused between one and four million deaths.

;H3N2
{{Main|H3N2}}
H3N2 is currently endemic in both human and pig populations. It evolved from H2N2 by [[antigenic shift]] and caused the [[Hong Kong Flu]] pandemic of 1968 and 1969 that killed up to 750,000.&lt;ref&gt;Detailed chart of its evolution [http://www.eletrica.ufsj.edu.br/~nepomuceno/references/epidemiology/ear_eal02.pdf here] at PDF called ''Ecology and Evolution of the Flu'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509025529/http://www.eletrica.ufsj.edu.br/~nepomuceno/references/epidemiology/ear_eal02.pdf |date=9 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;"An early-onset, severe form of influenza A H3N2 made headlines when it claimed the lives of several children in the United States in late 2003."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/books/0309095042/html/115.html "The Threat of Pandemic Influenza: Are We Ready? Workshop Summary (2005)"] [[National Academies Press|The National Academies Press]], p. 115 – "There is particular pressure to recognize and heed the lessons of past influenza pandemics in the shadow of the worrisome 2003–2004 flu season. An early-onset, severe form of influenza A H3N2 made headlines when it claimed the lives of several children in the United States in late 2003. As a result, stronger than usual demand for annual flu inactivated vaccine outstripped the vaccine supply, of which 10 to 20 percent typically goes unused. Because statistics on pediatric flu deaths had not been collected previously, it is unknown if the 2003–2004 season witnessed a significant change in mortality patterns."&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant strain of annual flu in January 2006 is H3N2. Measured resistance to the standard antiviral drugs [[amantadine]] and [[rimantadine]] in H3N2 has increased from 1% in 1994 to 12% in 2003 to 91% in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reason.com/rb/rb101905.shtml Reason] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026092508/http://www.reason.com/rb/rb101905.shtml |date=26 October 2006 }} [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/15/health/15drugs.html ''This Season's Flu Virus Is Resistant to 2 Standard Drugs''] By Altman LK, [[The New York Times]], Published: 15 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

"[C]ontemporary human H3N2 influenza viruses are now endemic in pigs in southern China and can reassort with avian H5N1 viruses in this intermediate host."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/books/0309095042/html/126.html "The Threat of Pandemic Influenza: Are We Ready? Workshop Summary (2005) "] [[National Academies Press|The National Academies Press]], page 126&lt;/ref&gt;

;H7N7
{{Main|H7N7}}
[[H7N7]] has unusual zoonotic potential. In 2003 in Netherlands 89 people were confirmed to have H7N7 influenza virus infection following an outbreak in poultry on several farms. One death was recorded.

;H1N2
{{Main|H1N2}}
[[H1N2]] is currently endemic in both human and pig populations. The new [[H1N2]] strain appears to have resulted from the reassortment of the genes of the currently circulating influenza H1N1 and [[H3N2]] subtypes. The [[hemagglutinin]] protein of the [[H1N2]] virus is similar to that of the currently circulating H1N1 viruses and the [[neuraminidase]] protein is similar to that of the current [[H3N2]] viruses.

==Strategies to prevent a flu pandemic==
This section contains strategies to prevent a flu pandemic by a [[Council on Foreign Relations]] panel.&lt;ref name="The Threat of Global Pandemics"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Council on Foreign Relations  | authorlink = Council on Foreign Relations  |author2=Michael Osterholm |author3=Rita Colwell |author4=Laurie Garrett |author5=Anthony S. Fauci |author6=James F. Hoge |author7=Nancy E.

If influenza remains an animal problem with limited human-to-human transmission it is not a pandemic, though it continues to pose a risk. To prevent the situation from progressing to a pandemic, the following short-term strategies have been put forward:
* Culling and [[Vaccination|vaccinating]] livestock
* Vaccinating poultry workers against common flu
* Limiting travel in areas where the virus is found&lt;ref name="The Threat of Global Pandemics"/&gt;

The rationale for vaccinating poultry workers against common flu is that it reduces the probability of common influenza virus recombining with avian H5N1 virus to form a pandemic strain. Longer term strategies proposed for regions where highly pathogenic H5N1 is endemic in wild birds have included:
* changing local farming practices to increase farm hygiene and reduce contact between livestock and wild birds.
* altering farming practices in regions where animals live in close, often unsanitary quarters with people, and changing the practices of open-air "[[wet markets]]" where birds are kept for live sale and slaughtered on-site. A challenge to implementing these measures is widespread poverty, frequently in rural areas, coupled with a reliance upon raising fowl for purposes of [[subsistence farming]] or income without measures to prevent propagation of the disease.
* changing local shopping practices from purchase of live fowl to purchase of slaughtered, pre-packaged fowl.
* improving veterinary [[vaccine]] availability and cost.&lt;ref name="The Threat of Global Pandemics"/&gt;

==Strategies to slow down a flu pandemic==

===Public response measures===
The main ways available to tackle a flu pandemic initially are behavioural. Doing so requires a good public health communication strategy and the ability to track public concerns, attitudes and behaviour. For example, the Flu TElephone Survey Template (FluTEST) was developed for the UK Department of Health as a set of questions for use in national surveys during a flu pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk/hsdr/volume-2/issue-41 The design of a survey questionnaire to measure perceptions and behaviour during an influenza pandemic: the Flu TElephone Survey Template (FluTEST)], by Rubin GJ, Bakhshi S, Amlôt R, Fear N, Potts HWW, Michie S. ''Health Services &amp; Delivery Research'', '''2'''(41). 12 November 2014. {{doi|10.3310/hsdr02410}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Social distancing:''' By traveling less, [[working from home]] or closing schools, there is less opportunity for the virus to spread. Reduce the time spent in crowded settings if possible. And keep your distance (preferably at least 1 metre) from people who show symptoms of influenza-like illness, such as coughing and sneezing.&lt;ref name="WHO-What-can-I-do"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Pandemic (H1N1) 2009: frequently asked questions: What can I do?   | publisher=[[World Health Organization]]  |date=January 2010  | url = http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/frequently_asked_questions/what/en/index.html  | accessdate = 28 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Respiratory hygiene:''' Advise people to cover their coughs and sneezes. If using a tissue, make sure you dispose of it carefully and then clean your hands immediately afterwards. (See "Handwashing Hygiene" below.) If you do not have a tissue handy when you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth as much as possible with the crook of your elbow.&lt;ref name="WHO-What-can-I-do" /&gt;
* '''Handwashing Hygiene:''' Frequent handwashing with soap and water (or with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer) is very important, especially after coughing or sneezing, and after contact with other people or with potentially contaminated surfaces (such as handrails, shared utensils, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Stop Germs, Stay Healthy!  | publisher=[[King County, Washington]] web site  | url = http://www.metrokc.gov/health/stopgerms/index.htm  | accessdate = 13 September 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205163024/http://www.metrokc.gov/health/stopgerms/index.htm|archivedate=5 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Other hygiene:''' Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth as much as possible.&lt;ref name="WHO-What-can-I-do" /&gt;
* '''[[Surgical mask|Masks]]:''' No mask can provide a perfect barrier but products that meet or exceed the [[NIOSH]] N95 standard recommended by the [[World Health Organization]] are thought to provide good protection. [[WHO]] recommends that health-care workers wear N95 masks and that patients wear surgical masks (which may prevent respiratory secretions from becoming airborne).&lt;ref name="non-pharm-interven"&gt;{{cite web|title=Non-pharmaceutical interventions: their role in reducing transmission and spread |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |date=November 2006 |url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/pharmaintervention2005_11_3/en/index.html |accessdate=13 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920002731/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/pharmaintervention2005_11_3/en/index.html |archivedate=20 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Any mask may be useful to remind the wearer not to touch the face. This can reduce infection due to contact with contaminated surfaces, especially in crowded public places where coughing or sneezing people have no way of washing their hands.  The mask itself can become contaminated and must be handled as medical waste when removed.
* '''Risk communication:''' To encourage the public to comply with strategies to reduce the spread of disease, "communications regarding possible community interventions [such as requiring sick people to stay home from work, closing schools] for pandemic influenza that flow from the federal government to communities and from community leaders to the public not overstate the level of confidence or certainty in the effectiveness of these measures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Committee on Modeling Community Containment for Pandemic Influenza  | title = Modeling Community Containment for Pandemic Influenza: A Letter Report  | pages = 47  | publisher=[[National Academies Press|The National Academies Press]]  | date = 11 December 2006  | isbn = 0-309-66819-0  | url = http://www.iom.edu/?id=39066  | accessdate = 6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two groups of antiviral drugs available for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza neuraminidase inhibitors such as [[Oseltamivir]] (trade name Tamiflu) and [[Zanamivir]] (trade name Relenza) as well as adamantanes such as amantadine and rimantadine. Due to the high rate of side effects and risk of antiviral resistance, use of adamantanes to fight influenza is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pandemic Influenza: Use of Antiviral Agents|url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/panflu/biofacts/panflu_antiviral.html|publisher=Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many nations, as well as the World Health Organization, are working to stockpile [[anti-viral drug]]s in preparation for a possible pandemic. [[Oseltamivir]] is the most commonly sought drug, since it is available in pill form.  [[Zanamivir]] is also considered for use, but it must be inhaled. Other anti-viral drugs are less likely to be effective against pandemic influenza.

Both Tamiflu and Relenza are in short supply, and production capabilities are limited in the medium term. Some doctors say that co-administration of Tamiflu with [[probenecid]] could double supplies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7064/full/438006a.html Wartime tactic doubles power of scarce bird-flu drug] Nature 438, 6. 3 November 2005. {{doi|10.1038/438006a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There also is the potential of viruses to evolve drug resistance. Some H5N1-infected persons treated with oseltamivir have developed resistant strains of that virus.

Tamiflu was originally discovered by [[Gilead Sciences]] and licensed to Roche for late-phase development and marketing.

===Vaccines===
A [[vaccine]] probably would not be available in the initial stages of population infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/pandemics.htm|title=Information on Avian Influenza|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A vaccine cannot be developed to protect against a virus which does not exist yet. The avian flu virus H5N1 has the potential to mutate into a pandemic strain, but so do other types of flu virus. Once a potential virus is identified and a vaccine is approved, it normally takes five to six months before the vaccine becomes available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_vaccine_20090806/en/|title= Pandemic influenza vaccine manufacturing process and timeline|website=www.WHO.int|access-date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The capability to produce vaccines varies widely from country to country; only 19 countries are listed as "influenza vaccine manufacturers" according to the World Health Organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Influenza vaccine manufacturers |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/manulist/en/index.html |access-date=13 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822222456/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/manulist/en/index.html |archivedate=22 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that, in a best scenario situation, 750&amp;nbsp;million doses could be produced each year, whereas it is likely that each individual would need two doses of the vaccine to become immuno-competent. Distribution to and inside countries would probably be problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = The clock is ticking  | publisher=Phacilitate  | url = http://www.phacilitate.co.uk/pages/phaciliate/article_fedson.html  | accessdate = 13 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several countries, however, have well-developed plans for producing large quantities of vaccine. For example, Canadian health authorities say that they are developing the capacity to produce 32&amp;nbsp;million doses within four months, enough vaccine to inoculate every person in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = Canada to launch avian flu vaccine trial  | publisher=CTV.ca  |date= 20 April 2005  | url = http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1114000609146_109409809/  | accessdate = 13 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern is whether countries which do not manufacture vaccines themselves, including those where a pandemic strain is likely to originate, will be able to purchase vaccine to protect their population. Cost considerations aside, they fear that the countries with vaccine-manufacturing capability will reserve production to protect their own populations and not release vaccines to other countries until their own population is protected. Indonesia has refused to share samples of H5N1 strains which have infected and killed its citizens until it receives assurances that it will have access to vaccines produced with those samples. So far, it has not received those assurances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = GAO cites barriers to antiviral, vaccine roles in pandemic  | publisher=CIDRAP  | url = http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/panflu/news/jan2308gao.html  | accessdate = 6 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in September 2009, The United States and France agreed to make 10 percent of their H1N1 vaccine supply available to other countries through the World Health Organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-flu-vaccine/u-s-to-offer-10-percent-of-h1n1-vaccine-internationally-idUSTRE58G4MW20090917|title=U.S. to offer 10 pct of H1N1 vaccine internationally|date=17 September 2009|publisher=|access-date=19 January 2018|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20090917-france-donate-swine-flu-vaccines-who-presidency|title=France to donate swine flu vaccines to WHO: presidency. 17 September 2009.|website=France24.com|access-date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two serious technical problems associated with the development of a vaccine against H5N1. The first problem is this: seasonal influenza vaccines require a single injection of 15 μg haemagluttinin in order to give protection; H5 seems to evoke only a weak immune response and a large multicentre trial found that two injections of 90&amp;nbsp;µg H5 given 28 days apart provided protection in only 54% of people {{Harv|Treanor|2006}}. Even if it is considered that 54% is an acceptable level of protection, the world is currently capable of producing only 900&amp;nbsp;million doses at a strength of 15 μg (assuming that all production were immediately converted to manufacturing H5 vaccine); if two injections of 90 μg are needed then this capacity drops to only 70&amp;nbsp;million {{Harv|Poland|2006}}.  Trials using [[adjuvant]]s such as [[alum]], [[AS03]], [[AS04]] or [[MF59]] to try and lower the dose of vaccine are urgently needed.  The second problem is this: there are two circulating [[clade]]s of virus, clade 1 is the virus originally isolated in Vietnam, clade 2 is the virus isolated in Indonesia. Vaccine research has mostly been focused on clade 1 viruses, but the clade 2 virus is antigenically distinct and a clade 1 vaccine will probably not protect against a pandemic caused by clade 2 virus.

Since 2009, most vaccine development efforts have been focused on the current pandemic influenza virus H1N1. As of July 2009, more than 70 known clinical trials have been completed or are ongoing for pandemic influenza vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/immunogenicity/immunogenicity_table.xls|title=World Health Organization.

&lt;!--from [[File:WHO_Pandemic_Influenza_Phases_(2009).png|thumb|310px|[[World Health Organization|WHO]] Pandemic Influenza Phases (2009)]]--&gt;
The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a global influenza preparedness plan, which defines the stages of a pandemic, outlines WHO's role and makes recommendations for national measures before and during a pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;The [[World Health Organization]] announces the current phase of the pandemic alert [http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/index.html here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422154143/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/index.html |date=22 April 2009 }}.

See "Assessing the pandemic threat" at [http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/en/]. The WHO published a first edition of the Global Influenza Preparedness Plan in 1999, and updated it in April 2005 and 2009.{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422154143/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/index.html |archivedate=22 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}. See [http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/pandemic/en/index.html] and [http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/WHO_CDS_CSR_EDC_99_1/en/] which define the responsibilities of the WHO and national authorities in case of an influenza pandemic. This is the first time a pandemic has been anticipated and is being prepared for.

The aims of such plans are, broadly speaking, the following:
* Before a pandemic, attempt to prevent it and prepare for it in case prevention fails.
* If a pandemic does occur, to slow its spread and allow societies to function as normally as possible.
 {{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902025055/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/index.html |archivedate=2 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 revision of the phase descriptions, the WHO has retained the use of a six-phase approach for easy incorporation of new recommendations and approaches into existing national preparedness and response plans. The grouping and description of pandemic phases have been revised to make them easier to understand, more precise, and based upon observable phenomena. Phases 1–3 correlate with preparedness, including capacity development and response planning activities, while phases 4–6 clearly signal the need for response and mitigation efforts. Furthermore, periods after the first pandemic wave are elaborated to facilitate post pandemic recovery activities.

The phases are defined below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Current WHO phase of pandemic alert| url =http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/|publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nature, influenza viruses circulate continuously among animals, especially birds. Even though such viruses might theoretically develop into pandemic viruses, in '''Phase 1''' no viruses circulating among animals have been reported to cause infections in humans.

In '''Phase 2''' an animal influenza virus circulating among domesticated or wild animals is known to have caused infection in humans, and is therefore considered a potential pandemic threat.

In '''Phase 3''', an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus has caused sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in people, but has not resulted in human-to-human transmission sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks. Limited human-to-human transmission may occur under some circumstances, for example, when there is close contact between an infected person and an unprotected caregiver. However, limited transmission under such restricted circumstances does not indicate that the virus has gained the level of transmissibility among humans necessary to cause a pandemic.

'''Phase 4''' is characterized by verified human-to-human transmission of an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus able to cause "community-level outbreaks". The ability to cause sustained disease outbreaks in a community marks a significant upwards shift in the risk for a pandemic. Any country that suspects or has verified such an event should urgently consult with the WHO so that the situation can be jointly assessed and a decision made by the affected country if implementation of a rapid pandemic containment operation is warranted. Phase 4 indicates a significant increase in risk of a pandemic but does not necessarily mean that a pandemic is a foregone conclusion.

'''Phase 5''' is characterized by human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region. While most countries will not be affected at this stage, the declaration of Phase 5 is a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent and that the time to finalize the organization, communication, and implementation of the planned mitigation measures is short.

'''Phase 6''', the pandemic phase, is characterized by community level outbreaks in at least one other country in a different WHO region in addition to the criteria defined in Phase 5. Designation of this phase will indicate that a global pandemic is under way.

During the '''post-peak period''', pandemic disease levels in most countries with adequate surveillance will have dropped below peak observed levels. The post-peak period signifies that pandemic activity appears to be decreasing; however, it is uncertain if additional waves will occur and countries will need to be prepared for a second wave.

Previous pandemics have been characterized by waves of activity spread over months. Once the level of disease activity drops, a critical communications task will be to balance this information with the possibility of another wave. Pandemic waves can be separated by months and an immediate "at-ease" signal may be premature.

In the '''post-pandemic period''', influenza disease activity will have returned to levels normally seen for seasonal influenza. It is expected that the pandemic virus will behave as a seasonal influenza A virus. At this stage, it is important to maintain surveillance and update pandemic preparedness and response plans accordingly. An intensive phase of recovery and evaluation may be required.

==Government preparations for a potential H5N1 pandemic (2003–2009)==
According to ''[[The New York Times]]'' as of March 2006, "governments worldwide have spent billions planning for a potential influenza pandemic: buying medicines, running disaster drills, [and] developing strategies for tighter border controls" due to the [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1|H5N1]] threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Rosenthal  | first = Elisabeth  |author2=Bradsher, Keith  | title = Is Business Ready for a Flu Pandemic?  |work=The New York Times   |date= 16 March 2006  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/16/business/16bird.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin  | accessdate = 13 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[T]he United States is collaborating closely with eight international organizations, including the [[WHO|World Health Organization]] (WHO), the [[FAO|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), the [[OIE|World Organization for Animal Health]] (OIE), and 88 foreign governments to address the situation through planning, greater monitoring, and full transparency in reporting and investigating avian influenza occurrences. The United States and these international partners have led global efforts to encourage countries to heighten surveillance for outbreaks in poultry and significant numbers of deaths in migratory birds and to rapidly introduce containment measures. The [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] (USAID) and the [[U.S. Department of State|U.S. Departments of State]], [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|Health and Human Services]] (HHS), and [[U.S. Department of Agriculture|Agriculture]] (USDA) are coordinating future international response measures on behalf of the White House with departments and agencies across the federal government.&lt;ref name="usaid" /&gt;}}

Ongoing detailed mutually coordinated onsite surveillance and analysis of human and animal H5N1 avian flu outbreaks are being conducted and reported by the [[USGS]] National Wildlife Health Center, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], the [[ECDC]], the [[World Health Organization]], the [[European Commission]], the [[National Influenza Centers]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Monitoring Outbreaks  | publisher=PandemicFlu.gov web site  | url = http://www.pandemicflu.gov/outbreaks/  | accessdate = 16 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, [[David Nabarro]], a lead UN health official warned that a bird flu outbreak could happen anytime and had the potential to kill 5–150&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = Bird flu 'could kill 150m people'  | publisher=BBC News  |date= 30 September 2005  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4292426.stm  | accessdate = 16 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Health Organization===
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), believing that the world was closer to another influenza pandemic than it has been any time since 1968, when the last of the 20th century's [[Influenza A virus subtype H3N2|three pandemics]] swept the globe, has developed guidelines on pandemic influenza preparedness and response. The March 2005 plan includes guidance on roles and responsibilities in preparedness and response; information on pandemic phases; and recommended actions for before, during, and after a pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization.

Each State and Territory of the United States has a specific Pandemic Flu Plan which covers Avian Flu, Swine Flu (H1N1) and other potential influenza epidemics.  The State Plans together with a professionally vetted search engine of flu related research, policies, and plans, is available at the current portal: [http://www.pandemicflusearch.net Pandemic Flu Search].

On 26 August 2004, Secretary of Health and Human Services, [[Tommy Thompson]] released a draft Pandemic Influenza Response and Preparedness Plan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan  | publisher=[[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]  |date= 20 March 2006  | url = https://www.hhs.gov/nvpo/pandemicplan/index.html  | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; which outlined a coordinated national strategy to prepare for and respond to an influenza pandemic. Public comments were accepted for 60 days.

In a speech before the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 14 September 2005, President [[George W. Bush]] announced the creation of the [[International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza]].  The Partnership brings together nations and international organizations to improve global readiness by:
* elevating the issue on national agendas;
* coordinating efforts among donor and affected nations;
* mobilizing and leveraging resources;
* increasing transparency in disease reporting and surveillance; and
* building capacity to identify, contain and respond to a pandemic influenza.

On 5 October 2005, Democratic Senators [[Harry Reid]], [[Evan Bayh]], [[Dick Durbin]], [[Ted Kennedy]], [[Barack Obama]], and [[Tom Harkin]] introduced the [[Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act]] as a proposal to deal with a possible outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release  | title = Democrats Work to Protect Americans From Avian Flu  | publisher=Senate Democratic Communications Center  |date= 5 October 2005  | url = http://democrats.senate.gov/~dpc/press/05/2005A06424.html  | accessdate = 16 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 October 2005, the Department of Health and Human Services awarded a $62.5&amp;nbsp;million contract to [[Chiron Corporation]] to manufacture an avian influenza vaccine designed to protect against the H5N1 influenza virus strain.  This followed a previous awarded $100&amp;nbsp;million contract to [[sanofi pasteur]], the vaccines business of the [[sanofi-aventis]] Group, for avian flu vaccine.

In October 2005, President Bush urged bird flu vaccine manufacturers to increase their production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = Bush focuses on bird flu vaccines  | publisher=BBC News  |date= 8 October 2005  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4320678.stm  | accessdate = 16 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 November 2005 President Bush unveiled the National Strategy To Safeguard Against The Danger of Pandemic Influenza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza |publisher=The White House |date=1 November 2005 |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/pandemic-influenza.html |accessdate=16 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109011356/http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/pandemic-influenza.html |archivedate=9 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also submitted a request to Congress for $7.1&amp;nbsp;billion to begin implementing the plan. The request includes $251&amp;nbsp;million to detect and contain outbreaks before they spread around the world; $2.8&amp;nbsp;billion to accelerate development of cell-culture technology; $800&amp;nbsp;million for development of new treatments and vaccines; $1.519&amp;nbsp;billion for the Departments of Health and Human Services ([[United States Department of Health and Human Services|HHS]]) and Defense to purchase influenza vaccines; $1.029&amp;nbsp;billion to stockpile antiviral medications; and $644&amp;nbsp;million to ensure that all levels of government are prepared to respond to a pandemic outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bush Outlines $7&amp;nbsp;Billion Pandemic Flu Preparedness Plan |publisher=usinfo.state.gov web site |date=1 November 2005 |url=http://usinfo.state.gov/gi/Archive/2005/Nov/01-432345.html |accessdate=16 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914184240/http://usinfo.state.gov/gi/Archive/2005/Nov/01-432345.html |archivedate=14 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 March 2006, Mike Leavitt, Secretary of Health and Human Services, said U.S. health agencies are continuing to develop vaccine alternatives that will protect against the evolving avian influenza virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Health Secretary Says More Bird Flu Vaccines Coming |publisher=usinfo.state.gov web site |date=7 March 2006 |url=http://usinfo.state.gov/gi/Archive/2006/Mar/07-312370.html |accessdate=16 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914184926/http://usinfo.state.gov/gi/Archive/2006/Mar/07-312370.html |archivedate=14 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. government, bracing for the possibility that migrating birds could carry a deadly strain of bird flu to North America, plans to test nearly eight times as many wild birds starting in April 2006 as have been tested in the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Manning  | first = Anita  | title = With avian flu spreading, U.S. to expand its testing  |work=USA Today |date= 7 March 2006  | url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2006-03-07-bird-migration_x.htm  | accessdate = 16 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 March 2006, Dr. David Nabarro, senior UN coordinator for avian and human influenza, said that given the flight patterns of wild birds that have been spreading avian influenza (bird flu) from Asia to Europe and Africa, birds infected with the H5N1 virus could reach the Americas within the next six to 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aita |first=Judy |title=United Nations Predicts Bird Flu in the Americas within a Year |publisher=usinfo.state.gov web site |date=9 March 2006 |url=http://usinfo.state.gov/gi/Archive/2006/Mar/09-520042.html?chanlid=globalissues |accessdate=16 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516023155/http://usinfo.state.gov/gi/Archive/2006/Mar/09-520042.html?chanlid=globalissues |archivedate=16 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] follows the [[World Health Organization|WHO's]] categories, but has expanded them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/cpip-pclcpi/index-eng.php | publisher=Public Health Agency of Canada | title = The Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan for the Health Sector}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Avian Flu scare of 2006 prompted The Canadian Public Health Agency to release an updated Pandemic Influenza Plan for Health Officials.  This document was created to address the growing concern over the hazards faced by public health officials when exposed to sick or dying patients.

===Malaysia===
Since the [[Henipavirus|Nipah]] virus outbreak in 1999, the [[Healthcare in Malaysia|Malaysian Health Ministry]] have put in place processes to be better prepared to protect the Malaysian population from the threat of infectious diseases. Malaysia was fully prepared during the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)]] situation (Malaysia was not a SARS affected country) and the episode of the [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1|H5N1 (bird flu)]] outbreak in 2004.

The [[Politics of Malaysia|Malaysian government]] has developed a [https://web.archive.org/web/20090509001006/http://www.moh.gov.my/MohPortal/DownloadServlet?id=2873&amp;type=2 National Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Plan (NIPPP)] which serves as a time bound guide for preparedness and response plan for influenza pandemic. It provides a policy and strategic framework for a multisectoral response and contains specific advice and actions to be undertaken by the Ministry of Health at the different levels, other governmental departments and agencies and non governmental organizations to ensure that resources are mobilized and used most efficiently before, during and after a pandemic episode.

Intraguild predation is common in nature and can be asymmetrical, in which one species feeds upon the other, or symmetrical, in which both species prey upon each other.&lt;ref name="ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION OF IGP"/&gt;  Because the dominant intraguild predator gains the dual benefits of feeding and eliminating a potential competitor, IGP interactions can have considerable effects on the structure of ecological communities.

==Types==
Intraguild predation can be classified as asymmetrical or symmetrical.  In asymmetrical interactions one species consistently preys upon the other, while in symmetrical interactions both species prey equally upon each other.&lt;ref name="ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION OF IGP"/&gt;  Intraguild predation can also be age structured, in which case the vulnerability of a species to predation is dependent on age and size, so only juveniles or smaller individuals of one of the predators are fed upon by the other.&lt;ref name="ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION OF IGP"/&gt;  A wide variety of predatory relationships are possible depending on the symmetry of the interaction and the importance of age structure.  IGP interactions can range from predators incidentally eating [[parasitism|parasites]] attached to their prey to direct predation between two [[apex predator]]s.&lt;ref name="ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION OF IGP"/&gt;

==Ecology of intraguild predation==
Intraguild predation is common in nature and widespread across communities and ecosystems.&lt;ref name="widespread interaction"/&gt;  Intraguild predators must share at least one prey species and usually occupy the same trophic [[guild (ecology)|guild]], and the degree of IGP depends on factors such as the size, growth, and population density of the predators, as well as the population density and behavior of their shared prey.&lt;ref name="ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION OF IGP"/&gt;  When creating theoretical models for intraguild predation, the competing species are classified as the "top predator" or the "intermediate predator," (the species more likely to be preyed upon).  In theory, intraguild predation is most stable if the top predator benefits strongly from killing off or feeding on the intermediate predator, and if the intermediate predator is a better competitor for the shared prey resource.&lt;ref name="theory"/&gt;

The ecological effects of intraguild predation include direct effects on the survival and distribution of the competing predators, as well as indirect effects on the abundance and distribution of prey species and other species within the community.  Because they are so common, IGP interactions are important in structuring communities.&lt;ref name="widespread interaction"/&gt;  Intraguild predation may actually benefit the shared prey species by lowering overall predation pressure, particularly if the intermediate predator consumes more of the shared prey.&lt;ref name="dynamics"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Intraguild Predation: the dynamics of complex trophic interactions |author=Gary A.

==Examples==

===Terrestrial===
Intraguild predation is well documented in terrestrial [[arthropod]]s such as [[insect]]s and [[arachnid]]s.&lt;ref name="lacewing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="centipedes"/&gt;  [[Hemiptera]]n insects and larval [[Neuroptera|lacewings]] both prey upon [[aphid]]s, but the competing predators can cause high enough mortality among the lacewings to effectively relieve predation upon the aphids.&lt;ref name="lacewing"&gt;{{cite journal|title=''Influence of intraguild predation among generalist insect predators on the suppression of an herbivore population''|author= Jay A.

Among the most dramatic examples of intraguild predation are those between large mammalian [[Carnivora|carnivores]].  Large [[Canidae|canines]] and [[Felidae|felines]] are the mammal groups most often involved in IGP, with larger species such as [[lion]]s and [[gray wolf|gray wolves]] preying upon smaller species such as [[fox]]es and [[lynx]].&lt;ref name="mammals"&gt;{{cite web |title=''Interspecific Killing among Mammalian Carnivores'' |author=F.

===Aquatic and marine===
Intraguild predation is also important in aquatic and marine ecosystems.  As top predators in most marine environments, [[shark]]s show strong IGP interactions, both between species of sharks and with other top predators like [[Odontoceti|toothed whales]].

For example, invertebrate predators such as insect larvae and predatory copepods and cladocerans can act as intraguild prey, with planktivorous fish the interguild predator and herbivorous zooplankton acting as the basal resource.&lt;ref name="trophic cascades1"/&gt;

==Importance to management and conservation==
The presence and intensity of intraguild predation is important to both management and conservation of species.&lt;ref name="dugongs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wolves"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fisheries"/&gt;  Human influence on communities and ecosystems can affect the balance of these interactions, and the direct and indirect effects of IGP may have economic consequences.

[[Fisheries management|Fisheries managers]] have only recently begun to understand the importance of intraguild predation on the availability of fish stocks as they attempt to move towards [[ecosystem-based management]].  IGP interactions between sharks and seals may prevent seals from feeding in areas where commercially important fish species are abundant, which may indirectly make more of these fish available to fishermen.&lt;ref name="seals"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Do shark declines create fear-released systems?|author= Alejandro Frid|author2= Gregory G. Baker|author3= Lawrence M. Dill|last-author-amp= yes |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.16134.x/pdf|publisher=Onlinelibrary.wiley.com|accessdate=2014-02-18|doi=10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.16134.x|volume=117|issue= 2|journal=Oikos|pages=191–201|year= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, IGP may also negatively influence fisheries.  Intraguild predation by [[spiny dogfish]] and various [[skate (fish)|skate]] species on economically important fishes like [[Atlantic cod|cod]] and [[haddock]] have been cited as a possible reason for the slow recovery of the [[groundfish]] [[Georges Bank|fishery]] in the western North Atlantic.&lt;ref name="fisheries"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/1051-0761%281998%298%5BS6%3ALDATSO%5D2.0.CO%3B2 |title=Large-Scale Disturbance and the Structure of Marine Systems : Fishery Impacts on Georges Bank |journal=Ecological Applications |volume=8 |pages=S6 |author=Michael J.

Intraguild predation is also an important consideration for restoring ecosystems.  Because the presence of top predators can so strongly affect the distribution and abundance of both intermediate predator and prey species, efforts to either restore or control predator populations can have significant and often unintended ecological consequences.  In [[Yellowstone National Park]], the reintroduction of wolves caused them to become intraguild predators of coyotes, which had far-reaching effects on both the animal and plant communities in the park.&lt;ref name="wolves"/&gt;  Intraguild predation is an important ecological interaction, and conservation and management measures will need to take it into consideration.&lt;ref name="dugongs"/&gt;

Captain '''John Todd''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|MBE|MC|DFC|sep=yes}} (1899–1980) was a Scottish [[World War I|First World War]] [[flying ace]] credited with [[List of World War I aces credited with 15–19 victories|eighteen aerial victories]].&lt;ref name="theaerodrome"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/scotland/todd1.php |title=John Todd |work=The Aerodrome |year=2016 |accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military service==
Todd was a medical student at [[Edinburgh University]]{{sfnp|Franks|2003|p=64}} before he joined the [[Royal Flying Corps]] as a cadet. He was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant (on probation) on the General List on 2 August 1917,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=24 August 1917 |supp=y |issue=30249 |pages=8782–8783 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was confirmed in his rank on 3 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=30401 |date=23 November 1917 |page=12334 |supp=y |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was posted to [[No. 70 Squadron RAF|No. 70 Squadron RFC]] to fly the [[Sopwith Camel]] single-seat fighter, and scored his first victory on 22 January 1918. Further victories followed, and Todd had brought his score up to five by the end of March, to make him an ace.&lt;ref name="theaerodrome"/&gt; On 1 April 1918, the Royal Flying Corps was merged with the Royal Naval Air Service to form the Royal Air Force, and his unit became No. 70 Squadron RAF. He gained three more victories by the end of the month,&lt;ref name="theaerodrome"/&gt; and on 7 May he was appointed a [[flight commander]] with the [[acting rank]] of captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=24 May 1918 |issue=30702 |page=6110 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such he gained six more victories in May, three in June, and his eighteenth and last on 1 July 1918.&lt;ref name="theaerodrome"/&gt; His final total was ten enemy aircraft destroyed (two shared), seven driven down out of control (one shared), and one captured. Fourteen of them were fighters and four were reconnaissance aircraft.&lt;ref name="theaerodrome"/&gt;

Todd was posted back to the Home Establishment in Britain to serve as an instructor in July 1918.{{sfnp|Franks|2003|p=64}} On 3 August his award of the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] was [[gazetted]],&lt;ref name="LG30827"&gt;{{London Gazette |date=2 August 1918 |supp=y |issue=30827 |page=9204 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by his [[Military Cross]] on 16 September.&lt;ref name="LG30901"&gt;{{London Gazette |date=13 September 1918 |supp=y |issue=30901 |page=11025 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 January 1919 he was transferred to the RAF's unemployed list.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=17 January 1919 |issue=31131 |page=906 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A replica of the F.1 Sopwith Camel B7320 flown by Todd is on permanent display at [[Montrose Air Station Heritage Centre]] in [[Montrose, Angus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage Centre Layout|url=http://rafmontrose.org.uk/exhibits-2|website=Montrose Air Station Heritage Centre|publisher=Ian McIntosh Memorial Trust|accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
After the war Todd returned to his medical studies. After graduating in 1922, he went to [[Livingstonia]], [[Nyasaland]], as a medical missionary.&lt;ref name="theaerodrome"/&gt; His efforts were rewarded by being made a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] in the [[1955 Birthday Honours]] "for medical and missionary services in [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland|Northern Rhodesia]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=3 June 1955 |supp=y |issue=40497 |pages=3280–3284  |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2472">'''Lenticonus'''  (/len·ti·co·nus/ (len″tĭ-ko´nus)) [lens + L. conus, cone] is a rare [[congenital anomaly]] of the [[eye]] characterized by a conical protrusion on the crystalline [[Capsule of lens|lens capsule]] and the underlying cortex. It can reach a diameter of 2 to 7&amp;nbsp;mm. The conus may occur anteriorly or posteriorly. If the bulging is spherical, instead of conical, the condition is referred to as ''lentiglobus''. It produces a decrease in [[visual acuity]] and irregular refraction that cannot be corrected by either spectacle or contact lenses.&lt;ref&gt;http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/lenticonus&lt;/ref&gt;

Biomicroscopically ''lenticonus'' is characterized by a transparent, localized, sharply demarcated conical projection of the lens capsule and cortex, usually axial in localization. In an early stage, retro-illumination shows an [[oil droplet]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;configuration. Using a narrow slit, the image of a conus is observed. In a more advanced stage associated subcapsular and cortical opacities appear. Retinoscopically the oil droplet produces a [[pathognomonic]] scissors movement of the light reflex. This phenomenon is due to the different refraction in the central and the peripheral area of the lens. [[Ultrasonography]] also can illustrate the existence of a ''lenticonus''. A-scan ultrasonography may reveal an increased lens thickness and B- scanultrasonography may show herniated lenticular material, suggestive of a lenticonus. [[Amblyopia]], [[cataract]], [[strabismus]] and loss of central fixation may be observed in association with lenticonus posterior. Cataract, flecked [[retinopathy]], posterior polymorphous dystrophy and [[Corneal arcus|corneal arcus juvenilis]] may be encountered in association with lenticonus anterior that occurs as a part of the Alport syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs K., Meire F.M. ''Lenticonus''. Departement of Ophthalmology, Ghent University Hospital; Bull. Soc. belge Ophtalmol., 277, 65-70, 2000 - www.ophthalmologia.be/download.php?dof_id=74&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist two distinct types of ''lenticonus'' based on the face of the lens affected.

==Types==

# '''Lenticonus anterior'''; lenticonus anterior is part of the [[waardenburg syndrome]]
# '''Lenticonus posterior'''; lenticonus posterior is more common than lenticonus anterior and is sometimes found in [[Lowe syndrome]]

Alport syndrome can cause both lenticonus anterior and posterior.

'''Lombart Instrument''' is the largest distributor of [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] instruments based in the  United States. They distribute equipment to eye doctors, teaching institutions, government installations, and hospitals worldwide. Headquartered in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], the company has sales and service branches throughout the United States.

The company was founded in 1979 by Richard and Kenneth Lombart. The company was formed after the two brothers left a career in the contact lens industry which was founded by their father, Adolph Lombart, and built into the world's largest manufacturer of hard [[contact lens]]es. That company (Lombart Lenses) was sold to an NYSE company. Lombart Instrument was acquired by Atlantic Street Capital in April 2016.

'''Marceline the Vampire Queen''' is a fictional character in the American [[List of animated television series|animated]] [[Cartoon Network]] [[television series]] ''[[Adventure Time]]'', created by [[Pendleton Ward]]. She is voiced by [[Olivia Olson]] in most appearances, by [[Ava Acres]] as a child and by [[Cloris Leachman]] as an old woman. Marceline is a fun-loving 1,000-year-old [[vampire]] queen, as well as a musician who plays an electric bass that she made from her family's heirloom battle-axe. The artistic design for Marceline was created by Ward, with small changes and additions added by Phil Rynda, former lead character and [[Property designer|prop designer]] for ''Adventure Time''.

Marceline makes her debut in the first season episode "[[Evicted!]]", in which she forces [[Adventure Time#Main characters|Finn]] and [[Adventure Time#Main characters|Jake]] from their home. However, as the series progresses, Marceline becomes a close friend to the two. Several backstory episodes have established that she was born to an unnamed human mother (voiced by [[Rebecca Sugar]]) and the demon [[Adventure Time#Minor characters|Hunson Abadeer]] (voiced by Olivia's real-life father, [[Martin Olson]]). Furthermore, when she was a child, the cataclysmic Mushroom War occurred, and soon after she developed a father-daughter-like bond with Simon Petrikov (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]), who would one day turn into the Ice King.

Marceline has been critically acclaimed and is popular with fans of ''Adventure Time''. The character was also the focus of a miniseries entitled ''[[Stakes (miniseries)|Stakes]]'' (2015), which was part of the show's [[Adventure Time (season 7)|seventh season]]. Early in the show's history, Ward himself stated that Marceline was his favorite character because he did not know everything about her history and backstory, which he felt added a mysterious element to her character. Marceline's relationship with [[Princess Bubblegum]] created controversy when the episodes "[[What Was Missing]]" and "[[Sky Witch]]" implied that they been in a relationship—a relationship that was openly confirmed in the series finale "Come Along with Me".

==Creation and design==
[[File:Olson_Stage.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A brunette woman is seated at a chair; she is wearing a hat.|Marceline is voiced by [[Olivia Olson]].]]
Marceline is one of the major characters in ''Adventure Time''.&lt;ref name=cotw/&gt; Although she did not appear in the series' pilot, the groundwork for her design and character were present in the series pitch book, penned by series creator [[Pendleton Ward]].&lt;ref name="SeriesBible"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ward|first=Pendleton|title=Adventure Time&amp;nbsp;– Original Bible Pitch|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/3122798/Adventure-Time-series-presentation|accessdate=October 30, 2012|author2=Seibert, Fred|date=October 26, 2010|publisher=[[Scribd]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=philfav/&gt; Ward purposely set out to make Marceline's character complex, as he explained that "with the female characters it’s easy to either write them as clichés or write them as the extreme opposite of those clichés ... I just try to make them have faults and strengths just like [[Finn the Human|Finn]] and [[Jake the Dog|Jake]] have."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview Time: GeekDad Talks With Adventure Time's Pen Ward|url=http://archive.wired.com/geekdad/2012/03/adventure-times-pen-ward/|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, in the series bible, Marceline is described as being "friendly rivals" with Bubblegum.&lt;ref name="SeriesBible"/&gt;

The design for Marceline was created by Ward, with small changes and additions added by Phil Rynda, former lead character and prop designer for ''Adventure Time''.&lt;ref name=philfav&gt;{{cite web|author=Rynda, Phil [philrynda] |title=What's your favorite character that you've designed? |url=http://www.formspring.me/philrynda/q/1093837859 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FBzvttvT?url=http://www.formspring.me/philrynda/q/1093837859 |archivedate=March 17, 2013 |via=[[Formspring]] |accessdate=October 26, 2012 |date=September 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Visually, Marceline has long, dark hair. She rarely walks on the ground, generally preferring to float when she travels, moves, and sleeps.&lt;ref name="evicted"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marceline's Closet"/&gt; Marceline, unlike many of the other characters, wears varying outfits in most of her appearances. According to Ward, her clothing changes from episode to episode because "girls own more than one outfit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ward, Pendleton [buenothebear] |title=Why does Marceline change clothes in the preview for Henchman? |url=http://www.formspring.me/buenothebear/q/989214198 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130412185720/http://www.formspring.me/buenothebear/q/989214198 |archivedate=April 12, 2013 |via=[[Formspring]] |accessdate=October 25, 2012 |date=August 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Olivia Olson]], the voice actress who plays Marceline, was impressed by her character's fashion design stating, "she has really cool style ... I love what they come up with [in] every episode."&lt;ref name=interviewwithvampire/&gt; Olson explained that when she goes in to record the voices for each episode, she is "totally surprised" by the costuming for Marceline.&lt;ref name=interviewwithvampire/&gt; While she says her lines, she is able to view the [[Storyboard#Animatics|animatics]] for the episode and sometimes has to stop to admire the unique designs.&lt;ref name=interviewwithvampire&gt;{{cite web|last=Orange|first=B.

Rynda later called this "one of the coolest parts" about the character's animation due to the fact that "every artist leaves a little bit of their own taste and sensibilities in what they draw."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rynda, Phil [philrynda] |title=Is Marceline drawn by many different people? |url=http://www.formspring.me/philrynda/q/252821032048534924 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130219005714/http://www.formspring.me/philrynda/q/252821032048534924 |archivedate=February 19, 2013 |via=[[Formspring]] |accessdate=October 26, 2012 |date=October 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marceline is voiced by Olivia Olson. When production on ''Adventure Time'' began, Ward contacted his friend [[Martin Olson]], who was a writer on the animated [[Disney]] series ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'', and asked if he knew who played the character Vanessa Doofenshmirtz on ''Phineas and Ferb'', as he wanted "her as a voice" on his show; reportedly, Ward was unaware that the actress was actually Martin Olson's daughter.&lt;ref name=msinterview&gt;{{cite web|last=Chevat|first=Zoe|title=The Mary Sue Exclusive Interview: Olivia Olson, Voice of Marceline the Vampire Queen|url=http://www.themarysue.com/olivia-olson-interview/|publisher=The Mary Sue|accessdate=August 6, 2013|date=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes-end"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lloyd |first1=Robert |title=As 'Adventure Time' Wraps, a Look Back at How the Series Broke Barriers and Changed the Genre |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-ca-adventure-time-oral-history-20180823-htmlstory.html |accessdate=September 5, 2018 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the casting audition, Olivia Olson first read for Princess Bubblegum, but was later asked to read for the role of Marceline. Upon seeing character designs, Olson was "definitely impressed by the character".&lt;ref name=interviewwithvampire/&gt; Because Ward knew that he wanted Olivia on his show, Martin Olson later joked that her audition was simply a "sham" to please network executives.&lt;ref name=soundcloudoliviamartin&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Zack |title=Adventure Time Ancient Psychic Tandem Warcast Episode 5 |url=https://soundcloud.com/zack-smith-81/martin-and-olivia-final |publisher=[[Soundcloud]] |accessdate=May 3, 2014 |date=April 14, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503090827/https://soundcloud.com/zack-smith-81/martin-and-olivia-final |archivedate=May 3, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to get into character, Olson often dresses in a manner similar to Marceline when she records her lines; she explained, "I always find ... that on the days that I go in to record Marceline, I’ll dress like her, in a weird way ... I’ll throw on some rock n’ roll boots, maybe some red lipstick, and just go in there."&lt;ref name=msinterview/&gt; In flashback sequences, younger Marceline is voiced by Ava Acres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Ava-Acres/|title=Ava Acres|publisher=Behind the Voice Actors|accessdate=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Adventure Time (season 5)|fifth season]] episodes "[[Finn the Human / Jake the Dog|Finn the Human" / "Jake the Dog]]", an older, alternate universe version of the character is voiced by [[Cloris Leachman]].&lt;ref name="FinntheHumanEp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JaketheDogEp"/&gt; Martin Olson also provides the voice for Marceline's demonic father [[Adventure Time#Minor characters|Hunson Abadeer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Olson|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Martin-Olson/|publisher=Behind the Voice Actors|accessdate=March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rocketmag/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seibert|first=Fred|title='Nightosphere' Odds and Ends|url=http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/adventure_time/2010/10/12/nightosphere-odds-ends/|publisher=[[Frederator]]|accessdate=March 18, 2013|date=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olivia Olson later noted that the opportunity to voice act with her father was "pretty cool".&lt;ref name=rocketmag&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaddy|first=Laura|title=Comic-Con Interview with Adventure Time!|url=http://racketmag.com/interviews/comic-con-interview-with-adventure-time/|work=Rocket Magazine|accessdate=March 18, 2013|date=July 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
Roughly a thousand years prior to the events of the series, Marceline was born to a demon lord named Hunson Abadeer (voiced by Martin Olson) and a human woman (voiced by [[Rebecca Sugar]]).&lt;ref name="everythingstays"&gt;{{cite episode| title=Stakes Part 2: Everything Stays | series=Adventure Time| serieslink=Adventure Time |credits = Ito, Elizabeth (supervising director); Sandra Lee (art director); Adam Muto &amp; Hanna K.

During this time, Simon Petrikov—the name of the [[Ice King]] before he was overcome by the evil power of his crown—found Marceline in the ruins of a city and gave her a stuffed animal named Hambo to cheer her up.&lt;ref name="I Remember You"&gt;{{cite episode| title=I Remember You | series=Adventure Time| serieslink=Adventure Time |credits = Leichliter, Larry (director); Nick Jennings (art director); Cole Sanchez &amp; Rebecca Sugar (storyboard artists) | network = [[Cartoon Network]] |airdate=October 15, 2012 | season = 4 | number = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two developed a caring relationship, although the crown took a toll on Simon's mental health, forcing him to leave Marceline alone.&lt;ref name=samep&gt;{{cite episode| title=Simon &amp; Marcy | series=Adventure Time| serieslink=Adventure Time |credits = Muto, Adam (supervising director); Nick Jennings (art director); Rebecca Sugar &amp; Cole Sanchez (storyboard artists) | network = [[Cartoon Network]] |airdate=March 25, 2013 | season = 5 | number = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="everythingstays"/&gt; During this period in her life, she was reunited with her father,&lt;ref name=marcy&amp;hunsonep/&gt; only to be disgusted by his cold and heartless ways.

While Abadeer ravages the land, Finn discovers that there is animosity between Marceline and her father.

Following Ash's advice, the two enter into Marceline's mind to retrieve the "memory core" in an attempt to wake her up. Along the way, they encounter various memories of her as a child following the Mushroom War. However, the duo soon learn that it was an elaborate trick by Ash; Finn and Jake actually removed Marceline's memory of their break-up.

In the [[Adventure Time (season 4)|fourth season]] episodes, "[[Return to the Nightosphere / Daddy's Little Monster|Return to the Nightosphere" / "Daddy's Little Monster]]", Marceline's dad returns and gives her an amulet that causes her to become the demonic and evil overlord of the Nightosphere.

The miniseries ''[[Stakes (miniseries)|Stakes]]'', which aired during the show’s seventh season, documents the reemergence of five of Marceline’s most powerful vampiric foes: the Fool (voiced by [[Ron Funches]]), the Empress Eyes (voiced by [[Rebecca Romijn]]), the Hierophant (voiced by [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]]), the Moon (voiced by [[Beau Billingslea]]), and the Vampire King himself (voiced by [[Billy Brown (actor)|Billy Brown]]).

The reappearance of these vampires forces Marceline, Bubblegum, Finn, Jake, and Peppermint Butler (voiced by [[Steve Little (actor)|Steve Little]]) to stake them one-by-one (although the Vampire King is neutralized through a scientific process that removes the vampiric essence from his body); in the ensuing action, Marceline is once again turned into a vampire, but comes to terms with her immortal fate.&lt;ref name=avclubstakes&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sava|first1=Oliver|title=''Adventure Time'': ''Stakes'' Slays Marceline’s Demons Without Puncturing Her Heart|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/adventure-time-stakes-slays-marcelines-demons-with-228306|website=[[The A.V.

===Relationships===
Marceline has a close relationship with Finn and Jake. Marceline and Finn have many things in common with one another; in the episodes "Evicted" and "Henchman" it is stated that the reason Marceline befriended Finn is because he simply enjoys being himself.&lt;ref name="evicted"/&gt;&lt;ref name="henchman"/&gt; Although she has kissed Finn [[Platonic love|platonically]] on the cheek twice,&lt;ref name="evicted"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gowithme"/&gt; Ward has noted that there is no romantic subtext between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ward |first=Pendelton |title=Does Marceline, by any chance, have a crush on Finn?

At the start of the series, Marceline shares a rocky relationship with Princess Bubblegum. However, as the show has gone on, their relationship has been fleshed out and changed. Marceline was the first person to address Bubblegum by her first name—Bonnibel—which occurred in the episode "Go with Me".&lt;ref name="gowithme"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Muto, Adam [MrMuto] |title=Do you know why Marcy called PB "Bonnibel" in "Go with Me"? |url=http://www.formspring.me/MrMuto/q/172174757477782733 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130112102232/http://www.formspring.me/MrMuto/q/172174757477782733 |archivedate=January 12, 2013 |via=[[Formspring]] |accessdate=October 25, 2012 |date=March 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their connections are explored further in the season three episode "What Was Missing". In the episode, Marceline's song "I'm Just Your Problem" and the dialogue between her and Bubblegum implied that there may have had some sort of relationship in the past, although the exact details surrounding the nature of the relationship were not explained.

Marceline and her father, Hunson Abadeer, have trouble accepting one another. Initially, Marceline believes her father does not care for her, and expresses her feelings through the before-mentioned "Fry Song".&lt;ref name="it came"/&gt; Although they admit to loving each other, Abadeer constantly pressures Marceline to follow in the family business and take over ruling the Nightosphere, a prospective job Marceline does not want.&lt;ref name="it came"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Return to the Nightosphere"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Daddy's Little Monster"/&gt; Marceline and the Ice King also have a complicated relationship. In the episode "I Remember You", it is revealed that the Ice King—then, the human man named Simon Petrikov—discovered her crying in the ruins of a city destroyed by the Mushroom Wars. It was Simon who gave little Marceline Hambo and attempted to watch over her. This kind gesture made the Ice King a long-time close friend and father figure to Marceline. However, as the crown's power increased, Simon began to forget more and more about his relationship with Marceline, until he had all but forgotten their friendship.&lt;ref name="I Remember You"/&gt; Former storyboard artist and showrunner for the series Adam Muto explained that Marceline and the Ice King's history was not part of the series' initial plan, but something that "evolved from [the show's] original course and it will likely continue to evolve in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Muto, Adam [MrMuto] |title=At what point in the show's production (or conception) did you guys decide to give Marceline and Ice King a shared history? |url=http://www.formspring.me/MrMuto/q/383709896052339288 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130412184327/http://www.formspring.me/MrMuto/q/383709896052339288 |archivedate=April 12, 2013 |via=[[Formspring]] |accessdate=March 18, 2013 |date=October 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:MarcelineCosplay.jpg|thumb|200px|right|alt=A woman, dressed in a grey shirt holding a red axe-bass hybrid.|According to Britt Hayes of ''Screen Crunch'', "it takes a special kind of attitude" to [[cosplay]] as Marceline due to her complex character.&lt;ref name=britt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screencrush.com/marceline-adventure-time-cosplay-of-the-day/|publisher=''Screen Crunch''|title=Cosplay of the Day: Marceline the Vampire Queen|last=Hayes|first=Britt|date=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Marceline has attracted positive critical attention. Oliver Sava of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' praised her as one "of this show’s most tragic characters".&lt;ref name="I Remember You"/&gt; He later wrote that her addition "was a major turning point for the series, introducing a hip, adventure-loving female to the cast who can hold her own against Finn and Jake and also has a strong connection to Ooo’s past."&lt;ref name=redstarved/&gt; Furthermore, he noted that "she’s been at the center of some of the show’s most emotional episodes", and "beyond her dramatic value, Marceline tends to just make every episode better" because "her writers clearly enjoy writing scenes for her".&lt;ref name=redstarved/&gt; Susana Polo of The Mary Sue referred to the character as "one of the radder characters" in the series.&lt;ref name=marysue&gt;{{cite web|last=Polo|first=Susana|title=Adventure Time's Marceline Gets Her Own Comicbook Spinoff, By the Creator of ''Octopus Pie''|url=http://www.themarysue.com/adventure-time-marceline-comic/|work=TheMarySue|publisher=TheMarySue, LLC|accessdate=October 26, 2012|date=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cam Shea of [[IGN]] named Marceline's introduction in "Evicted!" as the fourth best moment in the series' first season. He wrote that "sure, in this episode she evicts Finn and Jake from their home ... but hey, this is the first time we meet her and she's awesome."&lt;ref name=ign&gt;{{cite web|last=Shea|first=Cam|title=Our Top 10 Adventure Time Moments&amp;nbsp;– Season 1|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/22/our-top-10-adventure-time-moments-season-1|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|accessdate=October 30, 2012|date=October 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[io9]] writer Charlies Jane Anders wrote that Marceline's—as well as the Ice King's—appearance in "I Remember You" was "one of the most intense things I've seen in ages."&lt;ref name=io9&gt;{{cite web|last=Anders|first=Charlie|title=How Did Adventure Time Become Better Than Most Live-Action TV Shows?|url=http://io9.com/5952962/how-did-adventure-time-become-better-than-most-live+action-tv-shows|work=[[io9]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|accessdate=March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She praised Marceline's development from a "pretty one-note villain" to a type of person that "we sort of knew".&lt;ref name=io9/&gt; CartoonNetwork.co.uk named her "Character of the Week" on January 24, 2012.&lt;ref name=cotw&gt;{{cite web|title=Character of the Week: Marceline {{!}} Character Facts of the Week: Marceline from Adventure Time|url=http://www.cartoonnetwork.co.uk/blogs/character-facts-of-the-week-marceline-from-adventure-time|publisher=[[Cartoon Network|CartoonNetwork.co.uk]]|accessdate=October 26, 2012|date=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' called Marceline the best character in ''Adventure Time'' in a DVD review of the series, noting in particular that "she's … responsible for some of the show's best songs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Neill|first=Phelim|title=Adventure Time – Box Set Review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/dec/19/adventure-time-box-set-review|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=December 22, 2013|date=December 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, WhatCulture ranked her the fourth best character on the show, writing that she is a "bad ass" and "the coolest character in the series", and that—after the anti-vampire backlash in pop culture caused largely by the book and film series ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|Twilight]]'' and the television show ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'' in the mid-to-late 2000s—"Marceline ... prove[s] that vampires can still be awesome."&lt;ref name="whatcult"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lloyd|first1=Gavin|title=Adventure Time: Ranking Every Major Character From Worst To Best|url=http://whatculture.com/tv/adventure-time-ranking-every-major-character-from-worst-to-best?page=10|publisher=WhatCulture|accessdate=October 6, 2016|date=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lauren Rearick of ''[[Teen Vogue]]'' argued that Marceline is important in a discussion of on-screen representation, as she is from "a [[non-traditional family]] [whose] emotions ... sometimes mirrored depression".&lt;ref name=teenvogue/&gt; This, Rearick argues, gave the series "the opportunity to explore complex topics under the guise of a children's show."&lt;ref name=teenvogue&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rearick |first1=Lauren |title=''Adventure Time'' Showrunner Adam Muto and Olivia Olson on the Show's Legacy |url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/adventure-time-finale-empowerment |website=[[Teen Vogue]] |accessdate=August 30, 2018 |date=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production crew of ''Adventure Time'' are also pleased with the character. In 2010, near the start of the series, Ward stated that Marceline was his favorite character because he did not "know everything about her character yet", which he found to be "mysterious [and] cool".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ward, Pendleton [buenothebear] |title=Who plays Marceline's voice?

Ward later noted that he felt "good about that. It's nice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ward, Pendleton [buenothebear] |title=How do you feel about the ridiculously massive fanbase Marceline has gained after only one episode with her? |url=http://www.formspring.me/buenothebear/q/713638549 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130412184323/http://www.formspring.me/buenothebear/q/713638549 |archivedate=April 12, 2013 |via=[[Formspring]] |accessdate=October 25, 2012 |date=June 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marceline is also popular with [[cosplay]]ers, or [[performance art]]ists who wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent characters from the ''Adventure Time'' universe.&lt;ref name=britt/&gt; The character's popularity has been recognized by the company that owns ''Adventure Time''. In fact, the official press release for the ''Adventure Time: Marceline and the Scream Queens'' companion comic book referred to the character as a "fan-favorite".&lt;ref name=fanfav&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Eddie|title='Adventure Time: Marceline and the Scream Queens' #1 Gets a Badass Baltimore Comic-Con Variant|url=http://geek-news.mtv.com/2012/08/30/adventure-time-marceline-and-the-scream-queens-1-baltimore-comic-con-variant/|work=MTV Geek|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=October 26, 2012|date=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marceline's popularity has transcended into other mediums of popular culture. For instance, American singer [[Willow Smith|Willow]] dedicated two tracks of her debut album ''[[Ardipithecus (album)|Ardipithecus]]'' (2015) to the character, which were eponymously named after her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/willow-smith-releases-suprise-album-love-song-adve-229687|title=Willow Smith releases surprise album with love song to Adventure Time’s Marceline|last=|first=|date=December 11, 2015|website=[[The A.V.

===Relationship controversy===
The episode "What Was Missing" became controversial due to implications that Marceline and Princess Bubblegum had been in a past relationship.&lt;ref name=bitchmag/&gt;&lt;ref name=seibertlesbian/&gt; The controversy largely began after an accompanying "Mathematical" recap—a studio-endorsed behind the scenes video series implied that there were [[lesbian]] relations between Princess Bubblegum and Marceline and that the writing staff actively seeks input from fans.&lt;ref name=seibertlesbian/&gt;&lt;ref name=marysuecontr&gt;{{cite web|last=Polo|first=Susana|title=Did Adventure Time Just Admit To Lesbian Characters|url=http://www.themarysue.com/adventure-time-lesbian-characters/|work=''TheMarySue.com''|publisher=The Mary Sue, LLC|accessdate=March 24, 2013|date=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=muto1&gt;{{cite web|author=Muto, Adam [MrMuto] |title=Could you explain what this whole Mathematical video thing did that was bad? |url=http://www.formspring.me/MrMuto/q/243840879511470446 |via=[[Formspring]] |accessdate=March 20, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FGgACKo7?url=http://www.formspring.me/MrMuto/q/243840879511470446 |archivedate=March 20, 2013 |date=September 29, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident was addressed by the show's producer, [[Fred Seibert]], who said that "in trying to get the show’s audience involved we got wrapped up by both fan conjecture and spicy fanart and went a little too far."&lt;ref name=bitchmag&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Kjerstin|title=Adventure Time Gay Subtext: "Spicy" or Adorbz?|url=http://bitchmagazine.org/post/what-the-math|work=[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]]|accessdate=March 20, 2013|date=October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=seibertlesbian/&gt; Soon after, the video recap and the entire channel was pulled off of YouTube, although "What Was Missing" still airs during reruns.&lt;ref name=seibertlesbian&gt;{{cite web|last=Seibert|first=Fred|title=Well I Completely Screwed Up|url=http://yamino.tumblr.com/post/10825567451/adventuretime-well-i-completely-screwed-up|publisher=[[Frederator Studios]]|accessdate=March 6, 2013|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seibert's decision to remove the video also proved controversial; ''[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]]'' magazine later wrote an article about how the episode "handled female desire—female queer desire at that—in a subtle but complex way", and that the removal of the recap and the studio's perceived treatment of the controversy was detrimental towards the acceptance of queer romance in children's television.&lt;ref name=bitchmag/&gt; Ward later addressed the issue and gave a more neutral view; he said that, because there were "so many extreme positions taken on it all over the Internet", he did not "really want to comment on it [because] it was a big hullaballoo."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Zack|title=Adventure Time Creator Pen Ward Talks Before Season Finale|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/advneture-time-pendleton-ward-120213.html|work=''Newsarama.com''|publisher=TechMediaNetwork|accessdate=October 30, 2012|date=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following "What Was Missing", the pairing of Bubblegum and Marceline became popular with many fans of the show, and was labelled "Bubbline".&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{cite web |title=It’s Time to Make the Call: Bubbline is Canon |url=https://www.thefandomentals.com/time-make-call-bubbline-canon/ |publisher=The Fandomentals |accessdate=June 17, 2018 |date=June 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, Olson commented on the controversy, telling a crowd of fans gathered at a [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] book signing from ''The Adventure Time Encyclopedia'', that, according to Ward, Marceline and Princess Bubblegum had dated in the past, but that because the series airs in [[LGBT rights by country or territory|some areas where homosexual relationships are illegal]], the show has not been able to officially make clear the relationship in the series itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wu|first1=Connie|title=Adventure Time Fans Rejoice!

It certainly wasn’t in the show’s original pitch. It was a relationship that evolved over time."&lt;ref name="tvlinekiss"/&gt; Storyboard artist Hanna K. Nyström was responsible for adding in the kiss. According to Muto, this scene was not originally in the script; it merely noted that Bubblegum and Marceline "have a moment".&lt;ref name="tvlinekiss"/&gt; When Nyström was working on the sequence, Muto gave her creative control as to how she wanted that "moment" to unfold. Muto noted, "When Hanna boarded that, there was a little note in the margin that said 'Come on!' with a big exclamation point. That was the only note. I can’t argue with that."&lt;ref name="tvlinekiss"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Muto |first1=Adam |title=''Adventure Time'' EP Talks Bubblegum and Marceline's Series Finale Moment: 'There's Enough to Draw a Conclusion' |url=https://tvline.com/2018/09/03/adventure-time-series-finale-bubblegum-marceline-kiss-bubbline-confirmed/ |publisher=[[TVLine]] |accessdate=September 4, 2018 |date=September 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6930">Process of reviewing and assessing the dossier to support a medicinal product in view of its marketing (also called licensing, registration, approval, etc.), finalized by granting of a document also called '''marketing authorization''' (MA) (equivalent: product license). This process is performed within a legislative framework which defines the requirements necessary for application to the concerned (competent) regulatory authority, details on the assessment procedure (based on quality, efficacy and safety criteria) and the grounds for approval or rejection of the application, and also the circumstances where a marketing authorization already granted may be withdrawn, suspended or revoked.&lt;ref name="name"&gt;http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Licensingofmedicines/Marketingauthorisations/index.htm#3&lt;/ref&gt;

The application dossier for marketing authorization is called a [[New Drug Application]] (NDA) in the USA or [[Marketing Authorization Application]] (MAA) in the European Union and other countries, or simply registration dossier. Basically, this consists of a dossier with data proving that the drug has quality, efficacy and safety properties suitable for the intended use, additional administrative documents, samples of finished product or related substances and reagents necessary to perform analyses of finished product as described in that dossier. The content and format of the dossier must follow rules as defined by the competent authorities. For example, since 2003, the authorities in the United States, the European Union and Japan ask for the [[Common Technical Document]] (CTD) format, and more recently,{{When|date=November 2015}} its electronic version – the [[electronic Common Technical Document]] (eCTD).

The application is filed with the competent drug regulatory authority in the concerned country, which can be either an independent regulatory body or a specialized department in the ministry of health.

In accordance with local legislation, the resulting document allowing to the applicant to market the product may be more detailed (in addition to data identifying the product and its marketing authorization holder) it may contain addresses of all manufacturing sites, appended labeling, artwork of packaging components, etc.) until a one-page document called certificate of registration (and containing minimal data identifying the product and its source). 

==Procedures for obtaining a marketing authorization==

Authorization processes follow either a purely national procedure, with rules and requirements as per national legislation in force, as it occurs in most of countries worldwide, or should follow a centrally approval or a mutual recognition or decentralized procedure within the European Union. In the European Union a new authorization process is being defined for the [[Identification of medicinal products]] (IDMP) (as of 2017) based on the article 40 of the Pharmacovigilance Implementing Measures.

==Types of applications==

The type of application may vary according to status of the active ingredient.

Thus, if the application concerns a new active ingredient (new active substance, new chemical entity, new molecular entity), one talks about a full application.

Once a new active ingredient authorized, any additional strengths, pharmaceutical forms, administration routes, presentations, as well as any variations (changes to the existing marketing authorization) and extensions shall also be granted an authorization or be included in the initial marketing authorization, being subject of an abridged application.&lt;ref&gt;Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use. Official Journal of the European Union, L 311, 28.11.2001, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Special consideration is to be given to application for authorization of  biological products and biotechnology products,&lt;ref name="name"/&gt; homeopathic products, herbal drugs, radionuclide generators,  kits, radionuclide precursor radiopharmaceuticals and industrially prepared radiopharmaceuticals; in such instances, requirements are specific, in the meaning that they are special, more or less detailed, as per the nature of active ingredient.

==Validity of marketing authorizations==

In most countries, a marketing authorization is valid for a period of 5 years. After this period, one should apply for renewal of the marketing authorization, usually by providing minimal data proving that quality, efficacy and safety characteristics are maintained and the risk-benefit ratio of the medicinal product is still favourable. However, in the European Union, after one renewal, the marketing authorization shall remain valid for an unlimited period, unless the competent regulatory authority decides otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Directive 2004/27/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 amending Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use. L 136, 30.4.2004, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the marketing authorization is not renewed in due time as requested by the local legislation, in order to maintain the pharmaceutical product on a market, one can apply for re-authorization (re-registration). In such situations, the applicant may be requested to submit the whole items necessary for a full application.

Marketing authorization may be withdrawn, suspended, revoked or varied by regulatory authorities if under normal conditions of use the benefit over risk ratio is no more favorable, the product is harmful, or if it lacks therapeutic efficacy; also, one of the above actions can be taken if the qualitative and quantitative composition or other qualitative aspects (control) are not as currently declared.

Marketing authorization may be also withdrawn, suspended or revoked if the marketing authorization holder or its representative does not fulfill other legal or regulatory obligations necessary to maintaining of product on the market, as per the legislation in force.

Also, the marketing authorization is withdrawn in the EU if the product is not placed on the market within next 3 consecutive years after granting of authorization or if it is no more marketed for 3 consecutive years (so-called “sunset clause”).&lt;ref&gt;CMD(h) Agreement on Sunset Clause and its application to MAs granted in more than one Member State. Co-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures -Human, December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1691">'''Martin J. Cline''' (born 1934) is Professor of Medicine at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). He did postdoctoral training in [[hematology]]-[[oncology]] at the [[University of Utah]] and was at the [[University of California, San Francisco]] before going to [[UCLA]]. His research has been in [[cell biology]], [[molecular biology]], and [[genetics]].

==Accomplishments==
Cline was the first to successfully transfer a functioning [[gene]] into a living mouse, creating the first [[transgenic]] organism. His research has also pertained to the molecular genetic alterations in [[cancer]], especially in [[leukemia]].

In 1980, Cline conducted a rDNA transfer into the bone marrow cells of two patients with hereditary blood disorders. He did so in direct opposition to National Institute of Health gene therapy guidelines and without the approval of the Institutional Review Board at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), where his research was conducted. The ethical concerns that were generated prompted a call for review by a number of organizations – including the National Council of Churches, Synagogue Council of America, and the United States Catholic Conference. Consequently, Cline was forced to resign his department chairmanship at UCLA and lost several research grants.

'''Mold health issues''' are potentially harmful effects of [[mold]]s.

Molds (US usage; British English "moulds") are ubiquitous in the biosphere, and mold [[spores]] are a common component of household and workplace dust. The United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] reported in its June 2006 report, 'Mold Prevention Strategies and Possible Health Effects in the Aftermath of Hurricanes and Major Floods,' that "excessive exposure to mold-contaminated materials can cause adverse health effects in susceptible persons regardless of the type of mold or the extent of contamination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weinhold B |title=A spreading concern: inhalational health effects of mold |journal=Environ. Health Perspect. |volume=115 |issue=6 |pages=A300–5 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17589582 |pmc=1892134 |doi=10.1289/ehp.115-a300}}&lt;/ref&gt; When mold spores are present in abnormally high quantities, they can present especially hazardous health risks to humans after prolonged exposure, including allergic reactions or poisoning by [[mycotoxin]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/indoorenv/mold.html Indoor Environmental Quality: Dampness and Mold in Buildings]. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. August 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; or causing fungal infection ([[mycosis]]).

==Health effects==

Studies have shown that people who are [[atopic]] (sensitive), already suffer from [[allergies]], [[asthma]], or compromised [[immune system]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stöppler|first=Melissa Conrad|title=Mold Exposure|website=medicinenet.com|date=July 16, 2014|accessdate=February 1, 2015|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/mold_exposure/page2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occupy damp or moldy buildings are at an increased risk of health problems such as inflammatory and toxic responses to mold spores, metabolites and other components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Elisabeth |last1=Heseltine |first2=Jerome |last2=Rosen, ed.|title=WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: dampness and mould|year= 2009 |page=93| ISBN= 978 92 890 4168 3 |url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/43325/E92645.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common health problem is an allergic reaction. Other problems are respiratory and/or immune system responses including respiratory symptoms, respiratory infections, exacerbation of asthma, and rarely [[hypersensitivity pneumonitis]], allergic alveolitis, chronic rhinosinusitis and allergic fungal sinusitis. Severe reactions are rare but possible. A person's reaction to mold depends on their sensitivity and other health conditions, the amount of mold present, length of exposure and the type of mold or mold products.

Some molds also produce [[mycotoxins]] that can pose serious health risks to humans and animals. The term "toxic mold" refers to molds that produce mycotoxins, such as ''[[Stachybotrys chartarum]]'', not to all molds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/indoorenv/mold.html Indoor Environmental Quality Dampness and Mold in Buildings]. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. August 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Exposure to high levels of mycotoxins can lead to neurological problems and in some cases death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 19854819| year = 2009| author1 = Empting| first1 = L. D.| title = Neurologic and neuropsychiatric syndrome features of mold and mycotoxin exposure| journal = Toxicology and Industrial Health| volume = 25| issue = 9–10| pages = 577–81| doi = 10.1177/0748233709348393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prolonged exposure, e.g., daily workplace exposure, can be particularly harmful.

The five most common genera of indoor molds are ''[[Cladosporium]]'', ''[[Penicillium]]'', ''[[Aspergillus]]'', ''[[Alternaria]]'' and ''[[Trichoderma]]''.

Damp environments which allow mold to grow can also produce bacteria and help release [[volatile organic compounds]].

===Symptoms of mold exposure===
Symptoms of mold exposure can include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Minnesota Department of Health|title=Mold and Moisture in Homes|url=http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/indoorair/mold/|publisher=Minnesota North Star|accessdate=November 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Nasal and sinus congestion, runny nose
*Respiratory problems, such as wheezing and difficulty breathing, chest tightness
*Cough
*Throat irritation
*Sneezing / Sneezing fits

==== Health effects linking to asthma ====
Infants may develop respiratory symptoms as a result of exposure to a specific type of fungal mold, called Penicillium. Signs that an infant may have mold-related respiratory problems include (but are not limited to) a persistent cough and/or wheeze. Increased exposure increases the probability of developing respiratory symptoms during their first year of life.  Studies have shown that a correlation exists between the probability of developing asthma and increased exposure to ''Penicillium''. The levels are deemed ‘no mold’  to ‘low level’, from ‘low’  to ‘intermediate’, and from ‘intermediate’  to ‘high’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gent|first=Janneane|title=Levels of Household Mold Associated with Respiratory Symptoms in the First Year of Life in a Cohort at Risk for Asthma|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1241132/pdf/ehp0110-a00781.pdf|journal= Environ Health Perspect|accessdate=November 18, 2011|pmc=1241132|pmid=12460818|volume=110|pages=A781-6|doi=10.1289/ehp.021100781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mold exposures have a variety of health effects depending on the person. Some people are more sensitive to mold than others. Exposure to mold can cause a number of health issues such as; throat irritation, nasal stuffiness, eye irritation, cough and wheezing, as well as skin irritation in some cases.  Exposure to mold may also cause heightened sensitivity depending on the time and nature of exposure.  People at higher risk for mold allergies are people with chronic lung illnesses, which will result in more severe reactions when exposed to mold.

There has been sufficient evidence that damp indoor environments are correlated with upper respiratory tract symptoms such as coughing, and wheezing in people with asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Aaron|title=WHO Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality: Dampness and Mould|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/43325/E92645.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flood specific mold health effects===
Among children and adolescents, the most common health effect post-flooding was lower respiratory tract symptoms though there was a lack of association with measurements of total fungi.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rabito|first=Felicia A.|last2=Iqbal|first2=Shahed|last3=Kiernan|first3=Michael P.|last4=Holt|first4=Elizabeth|last5=Chew|first5=Ginger L.|title=Children's respiratory health and mold levels in New Orleans after Katrina: A preliminary look|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0091674907022609|journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|volume=121|issue=3|pages=622–625|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2007.11.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that these respiratory symptoms were positively associated with exposure to water damaged homes, exposure included being inside without participating in clean up.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Despite lower respiratory effects among all children, there was a significant difference in health outcomes between children with pre-existing conditions and children without.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Children with pre-existing conditions were at greater risk that can likely be attributed to the greater disruption of care in the face of flooding and natural disaster.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Health effects in children and adolescents with chronic risk were also found to be at an increased risk of adverse outcomes following a natural disaster including diabetes, asthma, chronic lung disease, allergies, HIV/AIDS, other immune disease, heart defects, cystic fibrosis, depression, seizure disorders, Sickle Cell disease, kidney failure, and liver failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rath|first=Barbara|last2=Donato|first2=Jessica|last3=Duggan|first3=Alyson|last4=Perrin|first4=Keith|last5=Bronfin|first5=Daniel R.|last6=Ratard|first6=Raoult|last7=VanDyke|first7=Russell|last8=Magnus|first8=Manya|date=2007-05-01|title=Adverse Health Outcomes after Hurricane Katrina among Children and Adolescents with Chronic Conditions|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/214414|journal=Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved|volume=18|issue=2|pages=405–417|doi=10.1353/hpu.2007.0043|issn=1548-6869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although mold is the primary focus post flooding for residents, the effects of dampness alone must also be considered. According to the Institute of Medicine, there is a significant association between dampness in the home and wheeze, cough, and upper respiratory symptoms.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendell|first=Mark J.|last2=Mirer|first2=Anna G.|last3=Cheung|first3=Kerry|last4=Tong|first4=My|last5=Douwes|first5=Jeroen|title=Respiratory and Allergic Health Effects of Dampness, Mold, and Dampness-Related Agents: A Review of the Epidemiologic Evidence|url=http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1002410|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|language=en-US|volume=119|issue=6|pages=748–756|doi=10.1289/ehp.1002410}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later analysis determined that 30% to 50% of asthma-related health outcomes are associated with not only mold, but also dampness in buildings.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Another health effect associated with dampness and mold is Sick Building Syndrome (SBS), which is defined by manifestations of symptomatic illness as a result of poor indoor air quality and pollutant exposures .&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Signs of potentially illness-causing buildings include condensation on the windows, high humidity in the bathrooms, a moldy odor, or water leakage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anyanwu|first=Ebere C.|last2=Campbell|first2=Andrew W.|last3=Vojdani|first3=Aristo|title=Neurophysiological Effects of Chronic Indoor Environmental Toxic Mold Exposure on Children|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1100/tsw.2003.22|journal=The Scientific World Journal|language=en|volume=3|pages=281–290|doi=10.1100/tsw.2003.22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is a proven correlation between mold exposure and the development of upper and lower respiratory syndromes, there are still fewer incidences of negative health effect than one might expect.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barbeau|first=Deborah N.|last2=Grimsley|first2=L.

== Mold-associated conditions ==
Health problems associated with high levels of airborne [[mold spore]]s include&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date =November 8, 2005  |title = Mold: A Health Hazard (Release #1605-096) | url= http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=20379  | publisher= FEMA | accessdate= September 25, 2007 }}{{Unreliable medical source|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=October 2010}} [[allergic reaction]]s, [[asthma]] episodes, irritations of the eye, nose and throat, [[Sinus cavity|sinus]] congestion, and other respiratory problems, although it should be noted that mold spores won't actually cause asthma, just irritate existing conditions.  For example, residents of homes with mold are at an elevated risk for both respiratory infections and bronchitis.&lt;ref name="Fisk 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fisk WJ, Eliseeva EA, Mendell MJ |title=Association of residential dampness and mold with respiratory tract infections and bronchitis: a meta-analysis |journal=Environ Health |volume=9 |pages=72 |year=2010 |pmid=21078183 |pmc=3000394 |doi=10.1186/1476-069X-9-72 |url=http://www.ehjournal.net/content/9//72}}&lt;/ref&gt; When mold spores are inhaled by an [[Immunodeficiency|immunocompromise]]d individual, some mold spores may begin to grow on living tissue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Müller FM, Seidler M |title=Characteristics of pathogenic fungi and antifungal therapy in cystic fibrosis |journal=Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=957–64 |date=August 2010 |pmid=20695750 |doi=10.1586/eri.10.72 |url=http://www.future-drugs.com/doi/abs/10.1586/eri.10.72?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed}}&lt;/ref&gt; attaching to cells along the [[respiratory tract]] and causing further problems.&lt;ref&gt;Simicic S, Matos T, “Microbiological diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.” Zdravnisji vestnik-slovanian medical journal. 2010, Vol. 79, Issue 10, p. 716-725.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Erol S |title=Nosocomial aspergillosis: epidemiology and control |language=Turkish |journal=Mikrobiyol Bul |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=323–38 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20549969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, when this occurs, the illness is an [[epiphenomenon]] and not the primary pathology. Also, mold may produce mycotoxins, either before or after exposure to humans, potentially causing toxicity.

===Fungal infection===
{{Further|Mycosis}}
A serious health threat from mold exposure for immunocompromised individuals is systemic fungal infection (systemic [[mycosis]]). Immunocompromised individuals exposed to high levels of mold, or individuals with chronic exposure may become infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nucci M, Anaissie E |title=Fusarium infections in immunocompromised patients |journal=Clin.

Mycotoxins may or may not be produced by the invading mold.

[[Dermatophyte]]s are the parasitic fungi that cause skin infections such as [[athlete's foot]] and [[tinea cruris]]. Most dermataphyte fungi take the form of a mold, as opposed to a yeast, with appearance (when cultured) that is similar to other molds.

===Mold-induced hypersensitivity===
The most common form of [[hypersensitivity]] is caused by the direct exposure to inhaled mold spores that can be dead or alive or [[hypha]]l fragments which can lead to [[allergic asthma]] or [[allergic rhinitis]].&lt;ref name="Indian"&gt;Indian Health Service: Bemidji Area Office of Environmental Health and Engineering Environmental Health Services Section “Guideline on the Assessment and Remediation of Fungi in Indoor Environments”&lt;/ref&gt;  The most common effects are [[rhinorrhea]] (runny nose), watery eyes, coughing and [[asthma|asthma attacks]].  Another form of hypersensitivity is [[hypersensitivity pneumonitis]].  Exposure can occur at home, at work or in other settings.&lt;ref name="Indian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/hp/hp_summary.html |title=What Is Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis? |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |date=October 1, 2010 |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is predicted that about 5% of people have some airway symptoms due to allergic reactions to molds in their lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pmid = 12762072| year = 2003| last1 = Hardin | first1 = B.

Hypersensitivity may also be a reaction toward an established fungal infection in [[allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis]].

===Mycotoxin toxicity===
{{Main|Mycotoxin}}
Molds excrete toxic compounds called [[mycotoxin]]s, secondary metabolites produced by fungi under certain environmental conditions. These environmental conditions affect the production of mycotoxins at the transcription level. Temperature, water activity and pH, strongly influence mycotoxin biosynthesis by increasing the level of transcription within the fungal spore. It has also been found that low levels of fungicides can boost mycotoxin synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reverberi M, Ricelli A, Zjalic S, Fabbri AA, Fanelli C |title=Natural functions of mycotoxins and control of their biosynthesis in fungi |journal=Appl.

Extreme exposure to very high levels of mycotoxins can lead to neurological problems and in some cases death; fortunately, such exposures rarely to never occur in normal exposure scenarios, even in residences with serious mold problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Prolonged exposure, such as daily workplace exposure, can be particularly harmful.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The health hazards produced by mold have been associated with [[sick building syndrome]], but no validated studies have been able to demonstrate that normal indoor exposures to these common organisms pose a significant threat.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

It is thought{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} that all molds may produce [[mycotoxins]] and thus all molds may be potentially toxic if large enough quantities are ingested, or the human becomes exposed to extreme quantities of mold. Mycotoxins are not produced all the time, but only under specific growing conditions. Mycotoxins are harmful or lethal to humans and animals only when exposure is high enough, [[The dose makes the poison|as with absolutely all other substances]].

Mycotoxins can be found on the mold spore and mold fragments, and therefore they can also be found on the substrate upon which the mold grows.  Routes of entry for these insults can include ingestion, dermal exposure and inhalation.

Some mycotoxins cause immune system responses that vary considerably, depending on the individual. The duration of exposure, the frequency of exposure and the concentration of the insult (exposure) are elements in triggering immune system response.

[[Aflatoxin]] is an example of a mycotoxin. It is a cancer-causing poison produced by certain fungi in or on foods and feeds, especially in field corn and peanuts.&lt;ref name=fsis&gt;[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/molds-on-food-are-they-dangerous_/ United States Food Safety and Inspection Service &gt; Molds On Food: Are They Dangerous?] Last Modified: August 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, [[Toxicity|toxic effects]] from mold were thought to be the result of exposure to the [[mycotoxin]]s of some mold species, such as ''[[Stachybotrys chartarum]]''.  However, studies are suggesting that the so-called toxic effects are actually the result of chronic activation of the immune system, leading to chronic inflammation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Studies indicate that up to 25% of the population have the genetic capability of experiencing chronic inflammation to mold exposure, but it is unknown how many actually experience such symptoms due to frequent misdiagnosis.  A 1993–94 [[case study]] based on cases of [[pulmonary hemorrhage]] in infants in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] originally concluded there was [[Causality|causal relationship]] between the exposure and the disease.  The investigators revisited the cases and established that there was no link to the exposure to ''S. chartrum'' and the infants in their homes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The common house mold, ''[[Trichoderma longibrachiatum]]'', produces small toxic peptides containing amino acids not found in common proteins, like alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, called trilongins (up to 10% w/w). Their toxicity is due to absorption into cells and production of nano-channels that obstruct vital [[ion channels]] that ferry potassium and sodium ions across the [[cell membrane]]. This affects in the cells [[action potential]] profile, as seen in [[cardiomyocytes]], [[pneumocytes]] and [[neurons]] leading to conduction defects. Trilongins are highly resistant to heat and [[antimicrobials]] making [[primary prevention]] the only management option.&lt;ref&gt;Reason Discovered for the Toxicity of Indoor Mould – ScienceDaily (Oct. 12, 2012) : https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/10/121012074655.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;20-Residue and 11-residue peptaibols from the fungus Trichoderma longibrachiatum are synergistic in forming Na+/K+-permeable channels and adverse action towards mammalian cells      Raimo Mikkola1,†,     Maria A.

== Exposure sources and prevention ==
The main sources of mold exposure are from the indoor air in buildings with substantial mold growth, and from ingestion of food with mold growths.

===Air===
{{Main|Indoor air quality}}
Prevention of mold exposure and its ensuing health issues begins with prevention of mold growth in the first place by avoiding a mold-supporting environment such as humid air. Extensive flooding and water damage can support extensive mold growth. Following hurricanes, homes with greater flood damage, especially those with more than {{convert|3|ft|m}} of indoor flooding, demonstrated higher levels of mold growth compared with homes with little or no flooding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barbeau DN, Grimsley LF, White LE, [[Jane El-Dahr|El-Dahr JM]], Lichtveld M |title=Mold exposure and health effects following hurricanes Katrina and Rita |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |volume=31 |pages=165–78 |year=2010 |pmid=20070193 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103643 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103643?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shoemaker RC, House DE |title=Sick building syndrome (SBS) and exposure to water-damaged buildings: time series study, clinical trial and mechanisms |journal=Neurotoxicol Teratol |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=573–88 |year=2006 |pmid=17010568 |doi=10.1016/j.ntt.2006.07.003 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0892-0362(06)00085-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aftermath of a hurricane is the worst-case scenario, but the concept of water damage supporting widespread mold growth is more generally applicable.

It is useful to perform an assessment of the location and extent of the mold hazard in a structure. Various practices of remediation can be followed to mitigate mold issues in buildings, the most important of which is to reduce moisture levels.&lt;ref name="control"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kumar, Manisha |author2=Verma, Rajesh K |title=Fungi diversity, their effects on building materials, occupants and control– a brief review |journal=Journal of Scientific and industrial Research |volume=69 |issue=9 |pages=657–661 |date=September 2010 |url=http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/10103 |issn=0975-1084}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal of affected materials after the source of moisture has been reduced and/or eliminated may be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Wilson SC, Holder WH, Easterwood KV, etal |title=Identification, remediation, and monitoring processes used in a mold-contaminated high school |journal=Adv.

A common issue with mold hazards in the household is the placement of furniture, and the lack of ventilation which this causes to certain parts of the wall. The simplest method of avoiding mold in a home so affected is to move the furniture in question.

Adverse respiratory health effects are associated with occupancy in buildings with moisture and mold damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Krieger J, Jacobs DE, Ashley PJ, etal |title=Housing interventions and control of asthma-related indoor biologic agents: a review of the evidence |journal=J Public Health Manag Pract |volume=16 |issue=5 Suppl |pages=S11–20 |year=2010 |pmid=20689369 |doi=10.1097/PHH.0b013e3181ddcbd9 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1078-4659&amp;volume=16&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=S11|pmc=3934496 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molds may excrete liquids or low-volatility gases, but the concentrations are so low that frequently they cannot be detected even with sensitive analytical sampling techniques.  Sometimes these by-products are detectable by odor, in which case they are referred to as "ergonomic odors" meaning the odors are detectable, but do not indicate toxicologically significant exposures.

===Food===
[[File:Moldy nectarines.jpg|thumb|Moldy [[nectarine]]s that were in a refrigerator. The nectarine with black mold is also affecting the nectarine underneath.]]
Molds that are often found on meat and poultry include members of the genera ''[[Alternaria]]'', ''[[Aspergillus]]'', [[Botryotinia|''Botrytis'']], ''[[Cladosporium]]'', ''[[Fusarium]]'', ''[[Geotrichum]]'', ''[[Mortierella]]'', ''[[Mucor]]'', ''[[Neurospora]]'', ''[[Paecilomyces]]'', ''[[Penicillium]]'', and ''[[Rhizopus]]''.&lt;ref name=foodborne_fungi/&gt;  Grain crops in particular incur considerable losses both in field and storage due to pathogens, post-harvest spoilage, and insect damage. A number of common microfungi are important agents of post-harvest spoilage, notably members of the genera ''Aspergillus'', ''Fusarium'', and ''Penicillium''.&lt;ref name=foodborne_fungi/&gt; A number of these produce mycotoxins (soluble, non-volatile toxins produced by a range of microfungi that demonstrate specific and potent toxic properties on human and animal cells&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kankolongo M, Hell K, Nawa I |title=Assessment for fungal, mycotoxin and insect spoilage in maize stored for human consumption in Zambia |journal=J.

Dietary exposure to the mycotoxin aflatoxin B1, commonly produced by growth of the fungus ''Aspergillus flavus'' on improperly stored ground nuts in many areas of the developing world, is known to independently (and synergistically with Hepatitis B virus) induce liver cancer.&lt;ref name=liu2010/&gt; Mycotoxin-contaminated grain and other food products have a significant impact on human and animal health globally. According to the World Health Organization, roughly 25% of the world's food may be contaminated by mycotoxins.&lt;ref name="Upadhaya" /&gt;

Prevention of mold exposure from food is generally to consume food that has no mold growths on it.&lt;ref name="fsis" /&gt; Also, mold growth in the first place can be prevented by the same concept of [[mold growth, assessment, and remediation]] that prevents air exposure. In addition, it is especially useful to clean the inside of the refrigerator, and to ensure dishcloths, towels, sponges and mops are clean.&lt;ref name="fsis" /&gt;

Ruminants are considered to have increased resistance to some mycotoxins, presumably due to the superior mycotoxin-degrading capabilities of their gut microbiota.&lt;ref name="Upadhaya" /&gt;  The passage of mycotoxins through the food chain may also have important consequences on human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Tanuma H, Hiramatsu M, Mukai H, etal |title=Case report.

=== Flooding ===
Flooding in houses causes a unique opportunity for mold growth which may be attributed to adverse health effects in people exposed to the mold, especially children and adolescents. In a study on the health effects of mold exposure after hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the predominant types of mold were ''[[Aspergillus]], [[Penicillium|Penicillum]]'', and ''[[Cladosporium]]'' with indoor spore counts ranging from 6,142 – 735,123 spores&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Molds isolated following flooding were different from mold previously reported for non-water damaged homes in the area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Further research found that homes with greater than three feet of indoor flooding demonstrated significantly higher levels of mold than those with little or no flooding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Mitigation ====

Recommended strategies to prevent mold include: avoiding mold-contamination; utilization of environmental controls; the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) including skin and eye protection and respiratory protection; and environmental controls such as ventilation and suppression of dust.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandt|first=Mary|last2=Brown|first2=Clive|last3=Burkhart|first3=Joe|last4=Burton|first4=Nancy|last5=Cox-Ganser|first5=Jean|last6=Damon|first6=Scott|last7=Falk|first7=Henry|last8=Fridkin|first8=Scott|last9=Garbe|first9=Paul|date=2006|title=Mold Prevention Strategies and Possible Health Effects in the Aftermath of Hurricanes and Major Floods|jstor=24842334|journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report: Recommendations and Reports|volume=55|issue=8|pages=1–CE–4|doi=10.2307/24842334}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When mold cannot be prevented, the CDC recommends clean-up protocol including first taking emergency action to stop water intrusion.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Second, they recommend determining the extent of water damage and mold contamination. And third, they recommend planning remediation activities such as establishing containment and protection for workers and occupants; eliminating water or moisture sources if possible; decontaminating or removing damaged materials and drying any wet materials; evaluating whether the space has been successfully remediated; and reassembling the space to control sources of moisture.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== History ==
In the 1930s, mold was identified as the cause behind the mysterious deaths of farm animals in Russia and other countries. ''[[Stachybotrys chartarum]]'' was found growing on wet grain used for animal feed.  Illness and death also occurred in humans when starving peasants ate large quantities of rotten food grains and cereals that were heavily overgrown with the ''Stachybotrys'' mold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=JD|last2=Rand|first2=TG|last3=Jarvis|first3=BB|title=Stachybotrys chartarum: cause of human disease or media darling?|journal=Medical mycology|date=August 2003|volume=41|issue=4|pages=271–91|doi=10.1080/1369378031000137350|pmid=12964721|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369378031000137350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, building [[construction]] techniques changed in response to changing economic realities including the [[energy crisis]]. As a result, homes and buildings became more airtight.  Also, cheaper materials such as [[drywall]] came into common use. The newer building materials reduced the drying potential of the structures making moisture problems more prevalent.  This combination of increased moisture and suitable substrates contributed to increased mold growth inside buildings.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Today, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|US Food and Drug Administration]] and the agriculture industry closely monitor mold and mycotoxin levels in grains and foodstuffs in order to keep the contamination of animal feed and human food supplies below specific levels. In 2005 [[Diamond Pet Foods]], a US pet food manufacturer, experienced a significant rise in the number of corn shipments containing elevated levels of [[aflatoxin]]. This mold toxin eventually made it into the pet food supply, and dozens of dogs and cats died before the company was forced to recall affected products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diamond Pet Food Recalled Due to Aflatoxin|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ArchiveRecalls/2005/ucm111929.htm|work=FDA.gov|accessdate=May 9, 2014|author=Mark Brinkman|date=December 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA Investigation of Diamond Pet Food Finds Some Product Exported|url=http://www.fda.gov/animalveterinary/newsevents/cvmupdates/ucm048391.htm|work=FDA.gov|accessdate=May 9, 2014|author=FDA, Center for Veterinary Medicine Communications Staff|date=December 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy ==
While there is a national policy regarding mold, each state is responsible for independently creating and administering their own policy. For example, following Hurricane Harvey, the governor of Texas sought to expand the emergency response to allow mold remediation companies to come from out of state.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bouldercounty.org/disasters/flood/health/mold-remediation/|title=Mold Remediation After a Flood|work=Boulder County|access-date=2017-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5362">'''PIMEX''' is one of the so-called video exposure monitoring methods which are used in [[occupational hygiene]] practise since their introduction in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="Rosen, G. 2005"&gt;Rosen, G.; Andersson, I.M.; Walsh, P.T.; Clark, R.D.R.; Säämänen, Arto; Heinonen, Kimmo; Riipinen, H.; Pääkkönen, R.. 2005. A review of video exposure monitoring as an occupational hygiene tool. Annals of Occupational Hygiene, vol. 49, 3, ss. 201–217 {{doi|10.1093/annhyg/meh110}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The name PIMEX is an acronym from the words '''PI'''cture '''M'''ix '''EX'''posure, and implies that the method is based on mixing pictures, in this case from a [[video camera]], with data on a worker’s exposure to some agent. The main idea of the method is to make invisible [[hazard]]s in the work environment visible and in this manner facilitate the reduction of hazards in workplaces.

== Invention ==
The method PIMEX was originally developed in Sweden during the 1980s by Gunnar Rosén and Ing-Marie Andersson.&lt;ref&gt;Rosén G, Lundström S. (1987) Concurrent video filming and measuring for visualization of exposure. Am Indust Hyg Ass J; 48: 688–92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosén G, Andersson I-M. (1989) Video filming and pollution measurement as a teaching aid in reducing exposure to airborne pollutants. Ann Occ Hyg; 33: 137–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar technique was developed also in USA where [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] researchers described a technique using a [[video overlay]] board and [[computer program]] to display, in real-time or after recording of data and video on tape, the measured value as a [[Bar chart|bar graph]] and the picture on the [[Computer display|computer screen]].&lt;ref&gt;Gressel M, Heitbrink WA, McGlothlin JD et al. (1987) Realtime, integrated, and ergonomic analysis of dust exposure during manual materials handling. Appl Ind Hyg J; 2: 108–13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gressel MG, Heitbrink WA, McGlothlin JD et al. (1988) Advantages of [[real-time data]] acquisition for [[exposure assessment]]. Appl Ind Hyg; 3: 316–20&lt;/ref&gt; 

Video exposure monitoring has thereafter been further developed and used in a number of countries.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh PT, Clark RDR, Flaherty S et al.(2000) Computer-aided video exposure monitoring. Appl Occup Environ Hyg; 15: 48–56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin P, Brand F, Servais M. (1999) Correlation of the exposure to a pollutant with a task-related action or workplace: the CAPTIV system. Ann Occup Hyg; 43: 221–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kovein RJ. (1997) Video exposure monitoring at NIOSH: an update. Appl Occup Environ Hyg; 12: 638–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xu F, McGlothlin JD. (2003) Video exposure assessments of solvent exposures in university pharmaceutical laboratories—a pilot study. Chemical Health and Safety; 10: 23–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The workers’ knowledge of risks associated with their tasks and, perhaps more importantly, how these risks can be controlled, is essential to improve their health.&lt;ref name="Rosen, G. 2005"/&gt; Applications of the PIMEX methods are various, focusing on work [[task analysis]], training and risk communication, encouraging worker participation in and motivation for improvements in the workplace environment.

== Use ==
PIMEX is used in many different countries. It is a widely used in the [[Netherlands]] for risk communication in the field of chemical exposure and it has been proven to be a very strong [[communication]] tool. There are more than 100 professional videos made with PIMEx for many different industries. They are all free available. The Dutch Ministry of social affairs developed a new promo video of PIMEX. It demonstrates the function and use of PIMEX with various examples from [[Occupational safety and health|working environments]].

There are a number of situations where PIMEX has been used:

* To train workers to use PPE and control measurements in the right way;
* To enlarge the knowledge of chemical risks and to motivate workers of management to use safe working procedures or to take measures;
* Workplace analyses (hazard identification);
* Visualization of a good practice method

In the Netherlands, the method is available to small and medium enterprises by the use of a half day workplace analysis or simple videos can be made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ects.nl/ ECTS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724151614/http://www.ects.nl/ |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PIMEX is also used to visualize [[noise]], [[heat stress]], [[nanoparticle]]s, [[electromagnetic field]]s and  physical [[Structural load|load]]. In the Netherlands there are also videos available that are made for employees in health services who are working with a mobile [[Patient lift|patient hoist]]. Such mobile hoists are used to reduce physical overload. The video shows the difference in exposure between using the hoist in the wrong and the correct way, for example when the wheels are in the wrong or right position.

The '''Pharmaceutical Association of Israel''' ({{lang-he|הסתדרות הרוקחים}}, ''Histadrut HaRokhim'') is a [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] umbrella organization for promoting and supporting [[pharmacy|pharmacies]] and pharmacists in [[Israel]]. It was founded in 1920 as '''The Internationally Licensed Pharmacists Association of the Land of Israel''' and got its current name with the founding of the state in 1948. The association has 500 full members and another 800 associates, and is a member of the [[International Pharmaceutical Federation]] (FIP).

==Overview==
The association provides professional courses held throughout the year and holds conferences and workshops. It also provides a supply of insurance and nursing care, professional books, holidays, pharmacy equipment etc. at reduced rates for its members. The association is represented in [[Knesset|parliamentary]] committees on issues pertaining to the pharmaceutical profession.

Permanent public relations, financial and legal facilities are available to members. The association publishes a journal, ''The Israeli Pharmaceutical Journal'', which provides updates on the profession and a platform for discussion among all pharmacists in the country. It also works closely with the [[pharmaceutical industry]], including distribution and [[Pharmaceutical manufacturing|manufacturing]].

The association has three branches, [[Tel Aviv]], [[Jerusalem]] and [[Haifa]], dividing the country into these three regions. Each branch has its own officers, who are represented on the Central Council. It has scientific, professional, ethical, social, strategy and educational committees, and a disciplinary court. Although it is not compulsory to be a member of the association, it enjoys the support of most pharmacists in the private sector.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2066">[[File:Roach joint comparison.jpg|thumb|Several roaches and a joint]]

A '''roach''' is the remains of a [[Joint (cannabis)|joint]], [[Blunt (marijuana cigar)|blunt]] or [[roll up cigarette]] after most of it has been smoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/roach|title=Roach|website=Thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=9 April 2018|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Small metal clips to facilitate the smoking of a "roach" are called [[roach clips]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Free Dictionary|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/roach+clip|website=Thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In Europe, the United Kingdom and most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations, "roach" can also refer to a bit of rolled thin cardboard in one end to serve as a mouthpiece - called a "filter" in North America. When this is employed, a joint can still be held securely after it has burnt down to a short length; thus, the entire length of the joint may be smoked without the aid of a roach clip.&lt;ref name="Arooka"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arooka|title=James Bong's Ultimate SpyGuide to Marijuana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w8N4DwMb19oC&amp;pg=PA178|publisher=Free World Press Ltd.|isbn=978-0-9738928-0-2|pages=178–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology ==
In Spanish, {{lang|es|tabaco de cucaracha}} ("roach tobacco") refers to powdery, low-quality tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lema.rae.es/drae/srv/search?id=yq0uMwyZT2x5wBn3psh. Real Academia Española. Diccionario Usual.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal implications ==
Roaches found in cars, etc and in a few cases embedded in the soles of shoes have been responsible for several drugs convictions in the UK and Channel Islands, despite in some cases other evidence being circumstantial or coincidental.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3146">'''Siempre Unidos''' is the leading care provider for [[HIV]]-positive individuals in [[Honduras]].  It is a unique fusion of a local self-help group and a US-based not-for-profit, ensuring both that the services provided are closely tied to the needs of the community and that the community has access to the resources and cutting-edge medicine of the United States.

==History==

Siempre Unidos began in 1995 as a Honduran self-help group organized out of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal church]].  Rev Pascual Torres, Chancellor of the Episcopal Diocese of Honduras, helped organize

After [[Hurricane Mitch]], volunteers from St. Stephen's Episcopal Church in [[Belvedere, CA]] came to Honduras to rebuild houses and help provide safe drinking water.  When they discovered the Siempre Unidos self-help group, the life expectancy of members was 6 months. Dr. [[Denise Main]] began work creating a sister organization in the states to help organize and provide resources for the self-help groups.

==Clinics==

Starting in 2003, the [[San Pedro Sula]] meeting area became a true clinic, offering medical care and triple anti-retroviral medications. By 2004,  they had opened clinics in [[Siguatepeque]] and [[Roatan]], growing to be one of the largest AIDS care provider in Honduras.

Patients cook and share free hot meals and provide support for each other.  They have a dedicated staff of Honduran physicians and nurses, while a US HIV specialist visits every few months to evaluate especially complicated cases.  Affordable [[anti-retroviral]] treatment is provided through the Honduran government and [http://www.rampusa.org/ RAMP].

Now that they can expect to lead full, productive lives, Siempre Unidos members are faced with the prospect of finding employment.  In Honduras,  job discrimination against HIV-positive people is severe; it isn't uncommon for a large employer to force all employees to take HIV tests, firing all those that are positive.

As a result, Siempre Unidos has developed a variety of forms of employment for its members, including sewing and jeweling, guaranteeing a [[living wage|fair wage]] and safe, secure working conditions.  The resulting products are sold in the United States under the [[SiempreSol]] brand, with profits returning to the clinics to expand access and services.  SiempreSol is [[fair trade]] certified by the [[Fair Trade Federation]].

The aim to is create a new model of sustainable AIDS care, where patients are able to pay for their own care.

==Outreach==

Recognizing that the only way to end the epidemic is through stopping its spread, Siempre Unidos does extensive outreach and education, reaching the most at risk groups--commercial sex workers, street children, and high school and university students. 

Siempre Unidos is also one of the only organizations in Honduras that offers voluntary confidential and accurate HIV screenings.

The '''Suchtmittelgesetz''' (SMG) (roughly translates to Addictives Law) is the controlled-substances law of [[Austria]], being passed in its current form in 1998 after the accession of the country to the European Union.  It is a modification of the earlier Suchtgiftverordnung of 1951, and like the [[Betäubungsmittelgesetz]] (BtMG) of Germany, the BtMG of Switzerland, the Controlled Substances Act of Canada and the United States, the Misuse Of Drugs Act of the UK and other such laws, is a consolidation of earlier laws and an implementation of international treaty obligations, such as the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]].

Suchtmittel and Betäubungsmittel are somewhat different concepts; the latter are drugs which numb, namely narcotics like morphine, whilst Suchtmittel and Suchtgiften are drugs which cause a morbid seek orientation for their use in the user, therefore poisoning or corrupting the individual sense of initiative and concern for other matters.

The SMG brought Austrian narcotics law into line with the prevailing standards in the European Union, which Austria joined in 1995.  Some vestiges of the 1951 SVV and earlier laws remain in place, such as local and provincial regulations dealing with registry and permit programmes for those dependent on narcotics including chronic pain patients and long-term unsupervised users of narcotics and the over the counter availability of [[codeine]], [[dihydrocodeine]], [[nicocodeine]] and similar drugs including some in other chemical/pharmaco-neurological categories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15017">A '''Summary Care Record''' (SCR) is an [[electronic patient record]], a summary of [[National Health Service]] patient data held on a central [[database]] covering [[England]], part of the [[NHS National Programme for IT]]. The purpose of the database is to make patient data readily available anywhere that the patient seeks treatment, for example if they are staying away from their home town or if they are unable to give information for themselves. Despite opposition from some quarters, by September 2010, 424 GP practices across at least 36 [[Primary Care Trust]]s had uploaded 2.7 million Summary Care Records.&lt;ref name=pulse2010.09.10&gt;[http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=35&amp;storycode=4127023&amp;c=2 Summary Care Record rollout pushes ahead as National Programme for IT axed] published 2010-09-10, accessed 2011-01-13&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 October 2010, the [[Secretary of State for Health|Health Secretary]] announced that the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition government]] would continue with the introduction, but that the records would 'hold only the essential medical information needed in an emergency – that is medication, allergen and [drug] reactions'.&lt;ref name=hsj2010.10.11&gt;[http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/policy/lansley-confirms-summary-care-record-roll-out-will-proceed/5020341.article Lansley confirms summary care record roll-out will proceed] Health Service Journal, published 2010-10-11, accessed 2011-01-13&lt;/ref&gt; By March 2013, more than 24 million SCRs had been created across England.&lt;ref  name=healthspace&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/systemsandservices/healthspace|title=HealthSpace — NHS Connecting for Health|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
Access to data is available to NHS personnel anywhere in England, but only if they have had the correct access rights on their smartcard approved by senior management {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}. Pharmacists in five regions were given read-only access in an NHS England pilot in October 2014 so they could verify and compare a patient's medicines during [[Medicine use review]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pharmacists given records access as pilot goes live|url=http://www.chemistanddruggist.co.uk/news-content/-/article_display_list/19311002/pharmacies-have-records-access-as-pilot-goes-live|accessdate=13 October 2014|publisher=Chemist and Druggist|date=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients were able to view their own records via the [[HealthSpace]] website, which closed down in December 2012.&lt;ref name=healthspace /&gt;

===Initial content===
The initial content of the database was to include the following:

* Drugs which the patient has been prescribed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.leeds.ac.uk/lsmp/healthadvice/summarycarerecord/scr.html | work =Leeds University Student Medical Service | title = Summary Care Record | accessdate = 2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Known [[Adverse drug reaction|adverse reactions to drugs]]
* Known [[allergies]]
* 
In his announcement on 10 October 2010, the Health Secretary implied that its scope would in future be restricted to these three items, stating but that it would 'hold only the essential medical information needed in an emergency – that is medication, allergen and [drug] reactions'.&lt;ref name=hsj2010.10.11 /&gt;
It also stated however that additional information can be added at the specific request of the patient.

===Planned future content===
It was originally intended that the database system would be upgraded in the future to add:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/systemsandservices/scr/documents/scrscopel.pdf | work = National Health Service | title =  The Summary Care Record Scope Document | author = Richard Clay | date = 27 October 2009 | accessdate=2010-03-17}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Accident and Emergency]] discharge summaries
* [[Inpatient]] discharge summaries
* [[Outpatient]] discharge summaries
* Out of Hours [[General practitioner|GP]] service encounters
* [[Health and Social Care Common Assessment Framework Plan]]s
* Contributions submitted by patients to their records via the HealthSpace website

However, following the Government announcement in October 2010 this is no longer envisaged.&lt;ref name=hsj2010.10.11 /&gt;

==Implementation==
Initial plans were that patients' records would be automatically be uploaded, without seeking patient consent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/nov/01/health.politics From cradle to grave, your files available to a cast of thousands] [[The Guardian]], November 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2006, Sir [[Liam Donaldson]], the [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|Chief Medical Officer]], wrote to GPs telling them that letters from patients requesting that their records should not be uploaded should be sent to [[Patricia Hewitt]], the health secretary, for 'full consideration', causing consternation among privacy campaigners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/dec/02/epublic.technology GPs angered by call to reveal names of NHS database rebels] The Guardian, December 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opting-out introduced===
As a result of pressure from privacy campaigners, the [[British Medical Association]] (BMA), the Ethics Committee of the [[Royal College of General Practitioners]], and a report by the Department of Health's 'patients tsar' Harry Cayton (the Report of the Ministerial Taskforce on the Summary Care Record&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/resources/policyandguidance/care_record_taskforce_doc.pdf Report of the Ministerial Taskforce on the Summary Care Record], Department of Health, December 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;), the Government agreed that patients would be able to [[opt out]] of the Summary Care Record.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/the-big-question-should-we-fear-plans-to-put-medical-records-on-a-national-database-429206.html Should we fear plans to put medical records on a national database?] [[The Independent]], December 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

After further pressure, it was decided that patients would be contacted before records were uploaded to provide them with the opportunity to opt out. Unless the patient does explicitly opt-out within the specified period after being notified (12 weeks as of April 2010), their details will be uploaded. Once entered ''and'' viewed, records cannot be fully deleted.

A number of pilot schemes followed, in the Primary Care Trusts areas of Bolton, Bury, South Birmingham, Dorset, South West Essex, and Bradford &amp; Airedale. In response to a Freedom of Information Request, the Department of Health revealed that, as at 24 April 2009, 258,488 patients' clinical records had been updated to form Summary Care Records. The Department was unable to provide information on how many of these related to children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/number_of_summary_care_records_c Number of Summary Care Records created] WhatDoTheyKnow, April 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems with the opting out scheme were reported by the independent evaluation, published 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/10333432.stm Health e-records 'struggling to fulfil potential']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenhalgh T, Stramer K, Bratan T, Byrne E, Russell J, Potts HWW (2010).

BMJ, 340, c3111 [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/340/jun16_4/c3111 Full text]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Full text"&gt;Greenhalgh T, Stramer K, Bratan T, Byrne E, Russell J, Hinder S, Potts H (2010). The devil’s in the detail: Final report of the independent evaluation of the Summary Care Record and HealthSpace programmes. London: University College London. [https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/scriefullreport.pdf Full text]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010 it was reported that the opt-out rate had risen from 0.6% to nearly 1%&lt;ref name=pulse2010.09.10 /&gt;

===Roll-out begins===
By the end of 2009 five [[NHS strategic health authority|strategic health authorities]] - [[NHS North West]], [[NHS North East]], [[NHS Yorkshire and the Humber]], [[NHS London]] and [[NHS East of England]] - had announced that they would begin notifying patients and uploading records during 2010. The Department of Health agreed to make funding available to them within the 2009-2010 financial year for public information campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-health-insider.com/news/5488/summary_record_roll-out_builds_momentum Summary record roll-out builds momentum] E-Health Insider, December 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; By 18 March 2010 letters had been sent to at least some patients notifying them that their details were to be entered unless they opted out within 12 weeks.

On 16 April 2010 the Department of Health suspended the implementation of Summary Care Records in the areas leading the roll-out, following calls to do so by the British Medical Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-health-insider.com/news/5833/scr_roll-out_suspended SCR roll-out suspended] E-Health Insider, April 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The BMA believed that implementation was moving forward too rapidly, that patients did not have enough information, and that it was too hard for them to opt out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-health-insider.com/news/5686/bma_says_scr_roll-out_%E2%80%98too_hasty%E2%80%99 BMA says SCR roll-out ‘too hasty’] E-Health Insider, March 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A week later it was reported that several [[Primary Care Trust]]s and the [[NHS East of England]] Strategic Health Authority were seeking a dispensation to continue with their implementation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-health-insider.com/news/5850/pcts_push_on_with_scr_despite_dh_stop PCTs push on with SCR despite DH stop] E-Health Insider, April 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015 it was announced that retail pharmacies would be given access to NHS patients Summary Care Records after a pilot of 140 pharmacies in Somerset, Northampton, North Derbyshire, Sheffield and West Yorkshire, demonstrated “significant benefits.”   Pharmacists have to ask for a patient’s permission to view their record,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tesco, Superdrug and Boots to be given access to NHS medical records|url=http://www.retail-week.com/sectors/health-and-beauty/tesco-superdrug-and-boots-to-be-given-access-to-nhs-medical-records/5077899.article|accessdate=22 August 2015|publisher=Retail Week|date=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and are required to complete the relevant [[Centre for Pharmacy Postgraduate Education]] e-learning package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How to use the summary care record in community pharmacy|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/learning/learning-article/how-to-use-the-summary-care-record-in-community-pharmacy/20201008.article|accessdate=16 January 2017|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 information on long-term health conditions, medical history and immunisations was available, and according to [[NHS Digital]], this reduced the burden on the health service during winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More detailed SCR can help ease winter pressures|url=https://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/20204180.article|accessdate=15 February 2018|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patient awareness===
A concern that has been raised is that surveys have shown that most patients know nothing of the SCR scheme even if they have received leaflets, so that when people receive a package on the SCR it goes straight in the bin as [[Advertising mail|junk mail]].&lt;ref name="Full text"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.computerweekly.com/blogs/tony_collins/2010/03/summary-care-records-rollout-s.html | author = Tony Collins | work = Computer Weekly | date = 9 March 2010 | title= Is Summary Care Records rollout speeding up as GPs urge caution?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In March 2010 the [[British Medical Association]] asked the British Government to suspend the roll-out of the database as it was an "imperfect system" being rushed into service prematurely,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2010/03/10/240560/bma-says-halt-rushed-roll-out-of-imperfect-summary-care.htm
| work = Computer Weekly | title = BMA says: halt rushed roll-out of imperfect Summary Care Records | date = 10 March 2010 | author = Tony Collins | accessdate = 2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; amid accusations that the system is insecure and that data has been uploaded without giving patients the opportunity to opt out.&lt;ref name="dailyT090310"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7408379/Patients-medical-records-go-online-without-consent.html
| work = Daily Telegraph | title = Patients' medical records go online without consent | author = Kate Devlin | date = 9 March 2010 | accessdate = 2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system has also been criticized for its inability to delete a patient record if a patient decides to withdraw from the system once their record has been created AND viewed. This has been stated to be due to the cost of completely deleting all information: "complete removal would require the hardware holding records to be completely sanitised. This is a process that destroys all data held, for example on a server or hard drive, and not just a particular record"&lt;ref name="reg0409"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/09/scr_cannot_be_deleted/
| work = The Register | author = John Oates | date = 9 April 2009 | title = Summary care records - you might die, but they never will | accessdate = 2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that in any case the record needs to be retained for legal reasons&lt;ref name="reg0409"/&gt; as "The issue of audit and the medico-legal evidential significance of the SCR will be extremely important and it would be inappropriate to provide tools that could completely remove a record, even if this were feasible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1167559/Patients-banned-deleting-records-NHS-database.html
| work = Daily Mail | author = Jason Lewis | date = 5 April 2009 | title = Patients to be banned from deleting their records from NHS database | accessdate = 2010-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SystmOne]] and other GP systems provide much more detailed information than the Summary Care Record. The implementation of SystmOne Prison across the prison estate "should be taken as a sign that a more widespread system is easily achievable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prisons linked to single health record IT|url=https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2011/apr/13/systmone-prison-healthcare-it-programme-completed|accessdate=16 October 2014|publisher=The Guardian|date=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis''' (also known as '''systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis''' ('''sJIA''') or the juvenile onset form of '''Still's disease'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Still's Disease|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/stills_disease/article.htm|website=MedicineNet|accessdate=8 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a type of [[juvenile idiopathic arthritis]] (JIA) with extra-articular manifestations like fever and rash apart from [[arthritis]]. It was originally called '''systemic-onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis''' or '''Still's disease'''.

Predominantly extra-articular manifestations like high [[fever]]s, rheumatic rash, [[hepatosplenomegaly|enlargement of the liver and spleen]], [[lymphadenopathy|enlargement of the lymph nodes]], and [[anemia]]. Others manifestations include [[pleuritis|inflammation of the pleura]], [[pericarditis|inflammation of the pericardium]], [[myocarditis|inflammation of the heart's muscular tissue]], and [[peritonitis|inflammation of the peritoneum]] are also seen.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

It is sometimes called "juvenile-onset Still's disease", to distinguish it from [[adult-onset Still's disease]]. However, there is some evidence that the two conditions are closely related.&lt;ref name="pmid12102485"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Luthi F, Zufferey P, Hofer MF, So AK |title="Adolescent-onset Still's disease": characteristics and outcome in comparison with adult-onset Still's disease |journal=Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=427–30 |year=2002 |pmid=12102485 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presentation==
Systemic JIA is characterized by arthritis, [[fever]], which typically is higher than the low-grade fever associated with polyarticular and a salmon pink [[rash]]. It accounts for 10-20% of JIA and affects males and females equally, unlike the other two subtypes of JIA, and affects adolescents. It generally involves both large and small joints. Systemic JIA can be challenging to diagnose because the fever and rash come and go. Fever can occur at the same time every day or twice a day (often in late afternoon or evening) with a spontaneous rapid return to baseline (vs. [[septic arthritis]] of continuous fever). The rash often occurs with fever. It is a discrete, salmon-pink macules of different sizes.  It migrates to different locations on skin, rarely persisting in one location more than one hour. The rash is commonly seen on trunk and proximal extremities or over pressure areas.

Arthritis is often absent in the first weeks or even 6–8 months into the illness.

Systemic JIA may have [[internal organ]] involvement such as hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, [[serositis]], [[hepatitis]], or [[tenosynovitis]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

A polymorphism in [[macrophage migration inhibitory factor]] has been associated with this condition.&lt;ref name="pmid12746913"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=De Benedetti F, Meazza C, Vivarelli M, etal |title=Functional and prognostic relevance of the -173 polymorphism of the macrophage migration inhibitory factor gene in systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis |journal=Arthritis Rheum. |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=1398–407 |date=May 2003 |pmid=12746913 |doi=10.1002/art.10882}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Cause==
The cause is unknown but it's thought to be related to environmental, genetic, and hormonal factors.

==Diagnosis==
[[Rheumatoid factor]] and [[Antinuclear antibody|ANA]] tests are generally negative in systemic JIA.

[[File:Roma-isola tiberina01.jpg|thumb|250px|A view from the south-east on the Tiber Island.]]
[[File:Tiber in flood 2.jpg|thumb|250px|A similar view on December 13th 2008 - the highest level of the Tiber for 40+ years.]]
The '''Tiber Island''' ({{lang-it|Isola Tiberina}}, [[Latin]]: ''Insula Tiberina'') is the only island in the part of the [[Tiber]] which runs through [[Rome]]. Tiber Island is located in the southern bend of the Tiber.

The island is boat-shaped, approximately {{convert|270|m|ft|abbr=off}} long and {{convert|67|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide, and has been connected with bridges to both sides of the river since antiquity. Being a seat of the ancient temple of Asclepius and later a hospital, the island is associated with medicine and healing. The [[Fatebenefratelli Hospital]] founded in the 16th century, and the [[San Bartolomeo all'Isola|Basilica of St. Bartholomew on the Island]] dating from the 10th century are located on the island.

==History==
[[File:Tiberina hh.jpg|thumb|250px|The Western end of Isola Tiberina. The [[travertine]] stone gives a distinctive [[trireme]] shape.]]

The island has been linked to the rest of Rome by two bridges since [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], and was once called ''Insula Inter-Duos-Pontes'' which means "the island between the two bridges". The [[Ponte Fabricio]], the only original bridge in Rome, connects the island from the northeast to the [[Campus Martius|Field of Mars]] in the [[rioni of Rome|rione]] [[Sant'Angelo (rione of Rome)|Sant'Angelo]] (left bank). The [[Ponte Cestio]], of which only some original parts survived, connects the island to [[Trastevere]] on the south (right bank).

There is a legend which says that after the fall of the hated tyrant [[Tarquinius Superbus]] (510 BC), the angry [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] threw his body into the Tiber. His body then settled onto the bottom where dirt and silt accumulated around it and eventually formed Tiber Island. Another version of the legend says that the people gathered up the wheat and grain of their despised ruler and threw it into the Tiber, where it eventually became the foundation of the island.

In ancient times, before Christianity spread through Rome, Tiber Island was avoided because of the negative stories associated with it. Only the worst criminals and the contagiously ill were condemned there. This however changed when a [[temple]] was built on the island.

=== Temple of Aesculapius (3rd century BC)===
[[File:Tiber Island.jpg|thumb|250px|An illustration of the Tiber Island in a 1593 print.]]
[[File:tiber.island.church.rome.arp.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Basilica]] di [[San Bartolomeo all'Isola]] on Tiber Island.]]

Tiber Island was once the location of an ancient temple to [[Asclepius|Aesculapius]], the Greek [[god]] of medicine and healing.

Accounts say{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2015}} that in 293 BC, there was a great [[pandemic|plague]] in Rome. Upon consulting the [[Sibyl]], the [[Roman Senate]] was instructed to build a temple to [[Aesculapius]], the Greek god of healing, and sent a delegation to [[Epidauros]] to obtain a statue of the deity. The delegation went on board a ship to sail out and obtain a statue.

Following their belief system, they obtained a snake from a temple and put it on board their ship. It immediately curled itself around the ship's mast and this was deemed as a good sign by them. Upon their return up the Tiber river, the snake slithered off the ship and swam onto the island. They believed that this was a sign from Aesculapius, a sign which meant that he wanted his temple to be built on that island.

This location may have been chosen for the Aesculapius Temple because it was separate from the rest of the city, which could help protect whoever was there from plague and illnesses.

The island eventually became so identified with the temple it supported that it was modeled to resemble a ship as a reminder of how it came to be. [[Travertine]] facing was added in mid or late first century by the banks to resemble a ship's prow and stern, and an [[obelisk]] was erected in the middle, symbolizing the vessel's mast. Walls were put around the island, and it came to resemble a Roman ship. Faint vestiges of Aesculapius' rod with an entwining snake are still visible on the "prow".

====Additional Roman shrines====
[[File:Roma - Fatebenefratelli.JPG|right|thumb|Entrance of the [[Fatebenefratelli Hospital]] (''Ospedale Fatebenefratelli'')]]

After the Temple of Aesculapius, shrines dedicated to other deities were also erected after the 2nd century BC, namely:&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;
* [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] Jurarius ("guarantor of oaths")
* [[Semo Sancus Dius Fidius]], also a witness of oath
* [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], yet another witness of oath
* [[Faunus]], boundary deity
* [[Vejovis]], god of healing
* [[Tiberinus (god)|Tiberinus]], river god
* [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]], war goddess

===After Ancient Rome===
In time,  the obelisk was removed and replaced with a cross-topped column. After it was destroyed in 1867, [[Pope Pius IX]] had an [[aedicula]], called "Spire", put in its place. This monument, designed by [[Ignazio Jacometti]], is decorated with statues of four saints related to the island: [[St. Bartholomew]], [[St. Paulinus of Nola]], [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]] and [[John of God|St. John]]. Parts of the obelisk are now in the museum{{which|date=October 2014}} in [[Naples]].

In 998 [[Holy Roman Empire|Emperor]] [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] had a  [[basilica]], that of [[San Bartolomeo all'Isola]], built over the Aesculapius temple's ruins on the eastern side (downstream end) of the island.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;Claridge, Amanda (1998). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xtoVDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Tiber%20Island%22&amp;f=false Rome: An Oxford Archaeological Guide]''. Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This was dedicated to his friend, the martyr [[Adalbert of Prague]]; the name of [[St. Bartholomew]] was added only later. In the early 20th century, prior to the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] regime's restoration of ancient place names, the Tiber Island was called the Isola di S. Bartolomeo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bill Thayer |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Insula_Tiberina.html#noteA |title= Annotation to ''A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'')}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Cestius' Bridge]] was called the Ponte S. Bartolomeo.

The island is still considered a place of healing because a hospital, founded in 1584, was built on the island and is still operating. It is staffed by the [[Hospitaller Order of St. John of God]] or "[[Fatebenefratelli Hospital|Fatebenefratelli]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oh-fbf.it/Objects/Pagina.asp?ID=640 Official Website of the Fatebenefratelli (Order of the Brothers of St. John of God)]&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital was not built on the same spot as the temple, but stands on the western half of the island.

According to the documentary My Italian Secret, when the Nazis occupied Rome in 1943 and started rounding up the Jews, Dr. Borromeo, head of the hospital, invented a “deadly” and highly contagious illness he dubbed “Il Morbo di K” to keep the SS away and protect those Jews hiding inside the wards, just a stone’s throw from the Ghetto. &lt;ref&gt;|url=http://myitaliansecret.com/characters&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="52683">The '''Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement''' ('''MSA''') was entered in November 1998, originally between the four largest [[United States]] [[Tobacco industry|tobacco companies]] ([[Altria|Philip Morris Inc.]], [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|R. J. Reynolds]], [[Brown &amp; Williamson]] and [[Lorillard Tobacco Company|Lorillard]] – the "original participating manufacturers", referred to as the "Majors") and the [[attorney general|attorneys general]] of 46 states.  The states settled their Medicaid lawsuits against the tobacco industry for recovery of their tobacco-related health-care costs.&lt;ref name="MSA"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|25}} In exchange, the companies agreed to curtail or cease certain [[Tobacco advertising|tobacco marketing practices]], as well as to pay, in perpetuity, various annual payments to the states to compensate them for some of the [[Health care prices|medical costs]] of caring for persons with smoking-related illnesses.  The money also funds a new anti-smoking [[advocacy group]], called the [[Truth Initiative]], that is responsible for such campaigns as [[Truth (anti-tobacco campaign)|Truth]].  The settlement also dissolved the tobacco industry groups [[Tobacco Institute]], the [[Center for Indoor Air Research]], and the Council for Tobacco Research.  In the MSA, the original participating manufacturers (OPM) agreed to pay a minimum of $206 billion over the first 25 years of the agreement.

==History of adoption==

===Private lawsuits before the settlement===
In September 1950, an article was published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' linking smoking to lung cancer and heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
| pmid = 14772469

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1954 the [[British Doctors Study]] confirmed the suggestion, based on which the government issued advice that smoking and lung cancer rates were related.&lt;ref name="RichardHillyBMJ1954"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = R. | first2 = B.| last2 = Hill| title = The mortality of doctors in relation to their smoking habits: a preliminary report: (Reprinted from Br Med J 1954:ii;1451-5)| journal = BMJ (Clinical research ed.)| volume = 328| last1 = Doll| issue = 7455| pages = 1529–1533; discussion 1533| date=Jun 2004 | issn = 0959-8138| pmid = 15217868| pmc = 437141| doi = 10.1136/bmj.328.7455.1529}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 the United States [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]]'s Report on Smoking and Health likewise began suggesting the relationship between smoking and cancer.

By the mid-1950s, individuals in the United States began to sue the companies responsible for manufacturing and marketing cigarettes for damages related to the effects of smoking. In the forty years through 1994, over 800 private claims were brought against tobacco companies in state courts across the country.&lt;ref name=miller&gt;Miller, Validity, Construction, Application, and Effect of Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) Between Tobacco Companies and Various States, and State Statutes Implementing Agreement; Use and Distribution of MSA Proceeds.  25 A.L.R.6th 435&lt;/ref&gt; The individuals asserted claims for negligent manufacture, negligent advertising, fraud, and violation of various state consumer protection statutes. The tobacco companies were successful against these lawsuits. Only two plaintiffs ever prevailed, and both of those decisions were reversed on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;25 A.L.R.6th 435&lt;/ref&gt;  As scientific evidence mounted in the 1980s, tobacco companies claimed [[contributory negligence]] as the adverse health effects were previously unknown or lacked substantial credibility.

===State litigation===
In the mid 1990s, more than 40 states commenced litigation against the tobacco industry, seeking monetary, equitable, and injunctive relief under various consumer-protection and antitrust laws.&lt;ref&gt;See Michael Janofsky, Mississippi Seeks Damages from Tobacco Companies, N.Y. Times, May 24, 1994, at A12 ("Mississippi today became the first state to demand that cigarette makers bear the health care costs of smoking."); Gordon Slovut, State, Blue Cross Sue Tobacco Industry, Star Tribune, August 18, 1994, at A1 (stating Minnesota filed suit against the tobacco industry); Andrew Wolfson, West Virginia Takes on Tobacco Over Health Costs, The Courier-Journal, Sept. 22, 1994, at A1; Amy Goldstein, Maryland to Sue Makers of Cigarettes; Effect of Smoking on Medicaid at Issue, Washington Post, Nov. 17, 1995, at B1 (reporting Maryland Governor Parris Glendening's announcement of decision to sue tobacco companies).&lt;/ref&gt; The first was declared in May 1994 by [[Mississippi Attorney General]] [[Mike Moore (U.S. politician)|Mike Moore]].

The general theory of these lawsuits was that the cigarettes produced by the tobacco industry contributed to health problems among the population, which in turn resulted in significant costs to the states' public health systems.  As Moore declared, "'[The] lawsuit is premised on a simple notion: you caused the health crisis; you pay for it.'"&lt;ref&gt;Janofsky, Mississippi Seeks Damages from Tobacco Companies, N.Y. Times, May 24, 1994, at A12 (quoting Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore).&lt;/ref&gt; The states alleged a wide range of deceptive and fraudulent practices by the tobacco companies over decades of sales.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Pennsylvania brought suit alleging a "conspiracy in concealing and misrepresenting the addictive and harmful nature of tobacco/nicotine[,] . . . industry control and manipulation of nicotine to foster addiction and thus profits[,] . . . intentionally attracting and addicting children to tobacco products," and "targeting African Americans" (complaint in ''Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Philip Morris, Inc.''). These claims encompass [[civil conspiracy]], willful and negligent breach of a special duty, [[fraudulent misrepresentation]], [[fraudulent concealment]], negligent design, strict liability, unfair trade practices, [[public nuisance]], and negligent and intentional entrustment.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other states soon followed. The state lawsuits sought recovery for [[Medicaid]] and other public health expenses incurred in the treatment of smoking-induced illnesses. Importantly, the defenses of personal responsibility that were so effective for the tobacco industry in suits by private individuals were inapplicable to the causes of action alleged by the states.

===Proposed "Global Settlement Agreement"===
Faced with the prospect of defending multiple actions nationwide, the Majors{{who|date=November 2018}} sought a congressional remedy, primarily in the form of a national legislative settlement.&lt;ref&gt;As of October 1996, sixteen states had brought suit. See Utah Sues Tobacco Companies, The Washington Post, Oct. 1, 1996, at A9 (reporting Utah joined fifteen other states, along with many counties and cities, in filing lawsuits against major tobacco companies).&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1997, the National Association of Attorneys General and the Majors jointly petitioned Congress for a global resolution.  On June 20, 1997, Mississippi Attorney General Michael Moore and a group of other attorneys general announced the details of the settlement. The settlement included a payment by the companies of $365.5 billion, agreement to possible [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulation under certain circumstances, and stronger warning labels and restrictions on advertising.

This proposed congressional remedy (1997 National Settlement Proposal (NSP), a.k.a. the "June 20, 1997 Proposal") for the cigarette tobacco problem resembled the eventual Multistate Settlement Agreement (MSA), but with important differences. For example, although the congressional proposal would have earmarked one-third of all funds to combat teenage smoking, no such restrictions appear in the MSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=1997 NSP, Title VII |url=http://www.cnn.com/us/9705/tobacco/docs/proposal.html |publisher=[[CNN.com]]accessdate=June 18, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the congressional proposal would have mandated [[Food and Drug Administration]] oversight and imposed federal advertising restrictions. It also would have granted immunity from state prosecutions; eliminated punitive damages in individual tort suits; and prohibited the use of class actions, or other joinder or aggregation devices without the defendant's consent, assuring that only individual actions could be brought.&lt;ref&gt;See id. at Title V(A), VIII(A), VIII(B).&lt;/ref&gt; The congressional proposal called for payments to the states of $368.5 billion over 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;1997 National Settlement Proposal, Title VI&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, assuming that the Majors would maintain their market share, the MSA provides baseline payments of about $200 billion over 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;See Multistate Settlement Agreement, §§ IX(a), (b), (c).&lt;/ref&gt;  This baseline payment is subject to
{{quote|the Inflation Adjustment, the Volume Adjustment, the Previously Settled States Reduction, the Non-Settling States Reduction, the NPM Adjustment, the offset for miscalculated or disputed payments described in subsection XI(i), the Federal Tobacco Legislation Offset, the Litigating Releasing Parties Offset, and the offsets for claims over described in subsections XII(a)(4)(B) and XII(a)(8).|MSA § IX(c).}}

The attorneys general did not have the authority to grant all this by themselves: the Global Settlement Agreement would require an act of Congress. Senator [[John McCain]] of Arizona carried the bill, which was much more aggressive than even the global settlement.&lt;ref name="Brandt" /&gt;{{Rp|422, 427}} However, in the spring of 1998, Congress rejected both the proposed settlement and an alternative proposal submitted by McCain.

While the proposed legislation was being discussed in Congress, some individual states began settling their litigation against the tobacco industry. On July 2, 1997, Mississippi became the first. Over the next year, Florida, Texas, and Minnesota followed, with the four states recovering a total of over $35 billion.

Four states (Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota) settled with the OPMs before the MSA. The OPMs pay those four states (the "previously settled states") 17 per cent of the MSA per-cigarette payment amount for each cigarette sold in any state. Thus, the OPMs pay the settling and previously settled states 104.55 per cent of the per-cigarette amount for each cigarette sold.{{dubious|date=March 2018}} In 2005, OPM payments totaled about 2.2 cents per cigarette or 44 cents per box.&lt;ref&gt;''Int'l Tobacco Partners, Ltd. v. Kline'', 475 F. Supp. 2d 1078, 1081–1082 (D. Kan. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption of the "Master Settlement Agreement"===
In November 1998, the Attorneys General of the remaining 46 states, as well as of the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, entered into the Master Settlement Agreement with the four largest manufacturers of cigarettes in the United States. ([[Florida]], [[Minnesota]], [[Texas]] and [[Mississippi]] had already reached individual agreements with the tobacco industry.)  The four manufacturers—[[Philip Morris USA]], [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]], [[Brown &amp; Williamson|Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.]], and [[Lorillard Tobacco Company]]—are referred to in the MSA as the Original Participating Manufacturers (OPMs).

This settlement process yielded two other national agreements:

====Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement====
In the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, which was executed at the same time as the Master Settlement Agreement, the leading manufacturer in the [[smokeless tobacco]] market (United States Tobacco Company, now known as [[U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company]]) settled with the jurisdictions who signed the MSA, plus Minnesota and Mississippi.

====Phase II settlement====
The next year, the major cigarette manufacturers settled with the tobacco-growing states to compensate tobacco growers for losses they were expected to suffer due to the higher cigarette prices resulting from the earlier settlements. Called the "Phase II" settlement, this agreement created the National Tobacco Growers' Settlement Trust Fund. Tobacco growers and quota holders in the 14 states that grow flue-cured and burley tobacco used to manufacture cigarettes are eligible to receive payments from the trust fund. The states are Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.

====Subsequent signatories====
At the time the Master Settlement Agreement became effective, the OPMs collectively controlled approximately 97% of the domestic market for cigarettes.  In addition to these "originally settling parties" (OSPs), the Master Settlement Agreement permits other tobacco companies to join the settlement; a list of these "subsequently settling parties" (SSPs) is maintained by the National Association of Attorneys General.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naag.org/backpages/naag/tobacco/msa/participating_manu/2009-06-22_PM_List.pdf/download naag.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1998, approximately 41 additional tobacco companies have joined the Master Settlement Agreement. These companies, referred to as the Subsequent Participating Manufacturers (SPMs), are bound by the Master Settlement Agreement's restrictions and must make payments to the settling states as set forth in the Master Settlement Agreement. Collectively, the OPMs and the SPMs are referred to as the Participating Manufacturers (PMs). Any tobacco company choosing not to participate in the Master Settlement Agreement is referred to as a Nonparticipating Manufacturer (NPM).

As an incentive to join the Master Settlement Agreement, the agreement provides that, if an SPM joined within ninety days following the Master Settlement Agreement's "Execution Date," that SPM is exempt ("exempt SPM") from making annual payments to the settling states unless the SPM increases its share of the national cigarette market beyond its 1998 market share, or beyond 125% of that SPM's 1997 market share. If the exempt SPM's market share in a given year increases beyond those relevant historic limits, the MSA requires that the exempt SPM make annual payments to the settling states, similar to those made by the OPMs, but based only upon the SPM's sales representing the exempt SPM's market share increase.&lt;ref name="G Corp. v 1114"&gt;KT&amp;G Corp. v. AG of Okla., 535 F.3d 1114, 1120 (10th Cir. Okla. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

SPMs joining the Master Settlement Agreement after this ninety-day exempt period must, instead, make annual payments based upon all of the SPM's national cigarette sales for a given year. In addition to its annual payment obligations, in order  [**9] to join the Master Settlement Agreement now, a non-exempt SPM must, "within a reasonable time after signing the" Master Settlement Agreement, pay the amount it would have been obligated to pay under the Master Settlement Agreement during the time between the Master Settlement Agreement's effective date and the date on which the SPM joined the agreement.&lt;ref name="G Corp. v 1114"/&gt;

The addition of the Subsequent Participating Manufacturers meant that nearly all of the cigarette producers in the domestic market had signed the Multistate Settlement Agreement. Their addition was significant. The Majors allegedly feared that any cigarette manufacturer left out of a settlement (Non-Participating Manufacturers or NPMs) would be free to expand market share or could enter the market with lower prices, drastically altering the Majors' future profits and their ability to increase prices to pay for the settlement.

==Summary of terms==
The Original Participating Manufacturers (OPMs) agreed to several broad categories of conditions:
* to restrict their advertising, sponsorship, lobbying, and litigation activities, particularly as those activities were seen as targeting youth;
* to disband three specific "Tobacco-Related Organizations," and to restrict their creation and participation in trade associations;
* generally to make available to the public documents the OPMs had disclosed during the discovery phase of their litigation with the settling states;
* to create and fund the National Public Education Foundation, dedicated to reducing [[youth smoking]] and preventing diseases associated with smoking.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;KT&amp;G Corp. v. AG of Okla., 535 F.3d 1114, 1119 (10th Cir. Okla. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
* to make annual payments to the settling states in perpetuity.

A section on enforcement gave jurisdiction to individual state courts to implement and enforce the term, and established a state enforcement fund ($50 million one-time payment).  The participating manufacturers also paid the states' Attorney Fees.

===Restrictions on youth targeting===
Generally, the participating manufacturers agreed not to "take any action, directly or indirectly, to target Youth within any Settling State in the advertising, promotion or marketing of Tobacco Products, or take any action the primary purpose of which is to initiate, maintain or increase the incidence of Youth smoking within any Settling State." (§III(a))

The restrictions specified included bans on [[Billboard|outdoor billboards]], advertising on transit vehicles, as well as restrictions on sports marketing, event sponsorships and promotional products.

===Financial provisions===

====Receipts by the states====
States were to receive over $206 billion over 25 years:
* Up-front payments – $12.742 billion.
* Annual Payments, beginning April 15, 2000 – $183.177 billion estimated through 2025. 9 billion per year from 2018 into perpetuity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/sites/default/files/resources/tclc-fs-msa-overview-2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Strategic Contribution Fund, 2008–2017 – $8.61 billion.
* National Foundation ($250 million over 10 years).
* Public Education Fund (at least $1.45 billion 2000–2003).
* State Enforcement Fund ($50 million, one-time payment).
* National Association of Attorneys General ($1.5 billion over next 10 years).

====Payments by the Participating Manufacturers (PMs)====
The amount of money that the PMs are required to annually contribute to the states varies according to several factors. All payments are based primarily on the number of cigarettes sold.

'''For the OPMs (Original Participating Manufacturers),''' the payments are determined in accordance with their relative market share as of 1997. The payment amount of a particular OPM is also dictated by the "Volume Adjustment," which compares the number of cigarettes sold in each payment year to the number of cigarettes sold in 1997. If the number of cigarettes sold by an OPM in a given year is less than the number it sold in 1997, the Volume Adjustment allows that OPM to reduce its payment to the settling states. In other words, a reduction in the amount of cigarettes sold by the OPMs results in the settling states receiving less money.

The MSA sets forth specific amounts that the OPMs have agreed to pay the settling states each year. Those annual amounts are subject to a number of adjustments. The OPMs each pay a portion of the total annual payment according to each OPM's "Relative Market Share" for the preceding year.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The MSA specifically provides that"Relative Market Share" means an [OPM's] respective share (expressed as a percentage) of the total number of individual Cigarettes shipped in or to the fifty United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico by all the [OPMs] during the calendar year immediately preceding the year in which the payment at issue is due (regardless of when such payment is made), as measured by the [OPMs'] reports of shipments of Cigarettes to Management Science Associates, Inc. (or a successor entity acceptable to both the [OPMs] and a majority of those Attorneys General who are both the Attorney General of a Settling State and a member of the NAAG [National Association of Attorneys General] executive committee at the time in question). A Cigarette shipped by more than one Participating Manufacturer shall be deemed to have been shipped solely by the first Participating Manufacturer to do so. For purposes of the  [**7] definition and determination of "Relative Market Share," 0.09 ounces of "roll your own" tobacco constitutes one individual Cigarette.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''For the SPMs (Subsequent Participating Manufacturers),''' the payments are determined by their relative market share as compared to other SPMs. For the SPMs that joined the MSA within 90 days of its execution, the annual payments are determined by the number of cigarettes an SPM sells beyond the "grandfathered" volume—calculated as the higher of either the individual SPM's market share in 1998 (the year the MSA was executed) or 125% of the SPM's market share in 1997. If an SPM's sales volume or market share declines below the grandfathered amount, then it is not required to make any payments to the settling states. SPMs that failed to join the MSA within 90 days of its execution do not receive the benefit of any grandfathered amount.

Both exempt and non-exempt SPMs' annual payment obligations under the MSA are "calculated on the basis of the percentage of the four original participating manufacturers' total domestic market share represented by the SPM[s'] domestic market share . . . . In other words, the denominator in the calculation is the total OPM market share, not the total OPM and SPM market share."&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Validity, Construction, Application, and Effect of Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) Between Tobacco Companies and Various States, and State Statutes Implementing Agreement; Use and Distribution of MSA Proceeds, 25 A.L.R. 6th 435, 461n.13 (2007), at 465–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the parties agree that the amount the SPMs pay per cigarette is roughly the same as the per-cigarette amount that the OPMs pay under the MSA. To the extent the amount differs, the OPMs pay slightly more than the SPMs on a per cigarette basis.&lt;ref name="G Corp. v 1114"/&gt;

====Escrow account====
The payments from all the PMs are deposited into an escrow account until disbursement to the settling states.

The MSA includes a model escrow (or qualifying) act and provides strong incentives for settling states to adopt it.&lt;ref&gt;See Miller, Validity, Construction, Application, and Effect of Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) Between Tobacco Companies and Various States, and State Statutes Implementing Agreement; Use and Distribution of MSA Proceeds, 25 A.L.R. 6th 435, 461n.13 (2007), at 466–67.&lt;/ref&gt; "[A] Qualifying Statute . . . is one that effectively and fully neutralizes the cost disadvantages that the Participating Manufacturers experience vis-a-vis Nonparticipating Manufacturers within the state."&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 467 (quotation omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;

The MSA encouraged settling states to adopt the model escrow act by providing that a settling state's allocated payment—that is, the portion of the annual MSA payment that a particular state receives in a given year—could be reduced by applying a non-participating manufacturers ("NPM") adjustment. That adjustment lowers a state's allocated share of the annual MSA payment if the OPMs lose market share to NPMs and if "a nationally recognized firm of economic consultants" determines that the MSA was "a significant factor contributing to the Market Share Loss for the year in question." The NPM adjustment does not apply to any state that has enacted and has in "full force and effect" a "qualifying" or model escrow statute. All settling states have enacted qualifying statutes.&lt;ref&gt;See Miller, Validity, Construction, Application, and Effect of Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) Between Tobacco Companies and Various States, and State Statutes Implementing Agreement; Use and Distribution of MSA Proceeds, 25 A.L.R. 6th 435, 461n.13 (2007), at 467.&lt;/ref&gt;

The escrow statute is premised on the legislative finding that, in light of the MSA settling the states' claims against the major cigarette manufacturers, [i]t would be contrary to the policy of the State if tobacco product manufacturers who determine not to enter into such a settlement could use a resulting cost advantage to derive large, short-term profits in the years before liability may arise without ensuring that the State will have an eventual source of recovery from them if they are proven to have acted culpably. It is thus in the interest of the State to require that such manufacturers establish a reserve fund to guarantee a source of compensation and to prevent such manufacturers from deriving large, short-term profits and then becoming judgment-proof before liability may arise.&lt;ref&gt;See Kan. Stat. § 50-6a01(f); Okla. Stat. tit. 37, § 600.21(D).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;KT&amp;G Corp. v. AG of Okla., 535 F.3d 1114, 1121 (10th Cir. Okla. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of that, the model escrow statute requires an NPM selling cigarettes in  [*1122]  a given state to do one of two things: 1) join the MSA, agreeing to "become a participating manufacturer (as that term is defined in section II(jj) of the [MSA]) and generally perform its financial obligations under the [MSA]," or 2) make similar annual payments into a state "liability reserve" escrow account, the funds of which can only be used to pay a judgment or settlement on a claim against the NPM. (After 25 years, any amount remaining in the escrow account is returned to the NPM.)&lt;ref name= &gt; {{ cite web | url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1137674.html | doi= | title=SANDERS v.

Any remaining funds in the escrow account revert back to the NPM after twenty-five years. &lt;/blockquote&gt; }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Kan. Stat. § 50-6a03; Okla. Stat. tit. 37, § 600.23(A).&lt;/ref&gt; An NPM's annual escrow payments in a particular state are calculated by multiplying a per-cigarette amount, established by the state's legislature and set forth in the statute, by the number of cigarettes the NPM sold in that state in the year for which payment is being made.&lt;ref&gt;See also Kan. Stat. § 50-6a03(b)(1); Okla. Stat. tit. 37, § 600.23(A)(2).&lt;/ref&gt; The parties agree that this per-cigarette amount is roughly equivalent to the per-cigarette amount the MSA requires from OPMs and SPMs for sales which are not exempt. To the extent it differs, the OPMs pay slightly more than the SPMs, which pay slightly more than the NPMs.&lt;ref&gt;KT&amp;G Corp. v. AG of Okla., 535 F.3d 1114, 1122 (10th Cir. Okla. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The escrow statute specifically requires that the NPM place into a qualified escrow fund by April 15 of the year following the year in question the following amounts (as such amounts are adjusted for inflation)—
:(A) 1999: $.0094241 per unit sold after the effective date of this act;
:(B) 2000: $.0104712 per unit sold;
:(C) for each of 2001 and 2002: $.0136125 per unit sold;
:(D) for each of 2003 through 2006: $.0167539 per unit sold;
:(E) for each of 2007 and each year thereafter: $.0188482 per unit sold.&lt;ref&gt;Kan. Stat. § 50-6a03(b)(1); see also Okla. Stat. tit. 37, § 600.23(A)(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Allocable share====
Each state receives a payment equal to its "Allocable Share," a percentage of the funds held in escrow that has been agreed upon by the settling states and memorialized in the MSA. This "Allocable Share" (as measured by a percentage of the total funds in escrow) does not vary according to how many cigarettes are sold in a particular state in a given year.

During the drafting of the MSA, the OPMs and the settling states contemplated that many of the smaller tobacco companies would choose not to join the MSA. This failure to join posed a potential problem for both the OPMs and the settling states. The OPMs worried that the NPMs, both because they would not be bound by the advertising and other restrictions in the MSA and because they would not be required to make payments to the settling states, would be able to charge lower prices for their cigarettes and thus increase their market share.

====NPMs====
Although the settling states' motivation was different from that of the OPMs, these states also were concerned about the effect of the tobacco companies that refused to join the MSA. The settling states worried that the NPMs would be able to regulate their sales so as to stay afloat financially while at the same time being effectively judgment-proof. As a result of these twin concerns, the OPMs and the settling states sought to have the MSA provide these other tobacco companies with incentives to join the agreement.

One such incentive, called the NPM Adjustment, provides that the payments by the PMs to the settling states may be adjusted according to the "NPM Adjustment Percentage." According to this provision, if a nationally recognized firm of economic consultants determines that the PMs have lost market share as a result of compliance with the MSA, the PMs' required payments to the settling states will be reduced to account for the loss. The NPM Adjustment therefore gives the settling states an incentive to protect the market dominance of the PMs, because  [*551]  otherwise the settling states themselves will receive less funds.  The MSA also provides a safe harbor from the NPM Adjustment if a settling state "diligently enforces" the provision of a Model Statute attached to the MSA and enacted by all of the settling states.

Most of the settling states have also voluntarily adopted "complementary" legislation to provide additional enforcement tools to compel compliance with the Model Statute.

====Allocable Share Release Repeal====
The original escrow statutes provided that NPM payments would remain in escrow for 25 years, but authorized an early release of any escrow amount which was greater than the allocable share which that state would have received if the NPM had been an SPM.&lt;ref&gt;The pre-amendment Kansas statute, for example, provided that if an NPM established that its payments were greater than the State's "allocable share of the payments that it would have been required to make in that year under the master settlement agreement . . . had it been a participating manufacturer," the NPM was entitled to an immediate release of its over-payment. See K.S.A. 50-6a03(b)(2)(B) (before 2005 amendment).&lt;/ref&gt; The originally enacted escrow statutes permitted an NPM to obtain a refund of the amount the NPM paid into the escrow fund to the extent that a tobacco product manufacturer establishes that the amount it was required to place into escrow in a particular year was greater than the State's allocable share of the total payments that such manufacturer would have been required to make in that year under the [MSA] . . . had it been a participating manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;See also Kan. Stat. § 50-6a03(b)(2)(B); Okla. Stat. tit. 37, § 600.23(B)(2).&lt;/ref&gt;  This "Allocable Share Release Provision" was intended to create substantial equivalence between the escrow obligation of NPMs under the escrow statutes and the amounts the NPMs would have paid if they had they joined the MSA.&lt;ref&gt;See K.S.A. § 50-6a03(b)(2)(B).&lt;/ref&gt;

The settling states agreed to divide the annual MSA payment among themselves according to each state's preset allocable share, rather than according to the volume of sales made in a particular state in a given year.&lt;ref&gt;See Miller, Validity, Construction, Application, and Effect of Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) Between Tobacco Companies and Various States, and State Statutes Implementing Agreement; Use and Distribution of MSA Proceeds, 25 A.L.R. 6th 435, 461n.13 (2007), at 464.&lt;/ref&gt; An NPM's payments into a state's escrow fund, on the other hand, were dependent on the number of cigarettes that the NPM sold in that state in a given year. Nevertheless, the originally enacted escrow statute based any refund of those escrowed funds payments on that state's allocable share of the national MSA payment. This refund provision, then, assumed an NPM would sell its cigarettes nationally.&lt;ref&gt;See id. at 469.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;KT&amp;G Corp. v. AG of Okla., 535 F.3d 1114, 1123 (10th Cir. Okla. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

If an NPM made the bulk of its sales in a few states, however, it could obtain a refund of those escrow payments in excess of what it would have paid each of those States had it been an SPM. For example, an NPM which made 50 per cent of its sales in Kansas (which has a relatively low allocable share) would obtain a release from its Kansas escrow fund of more than 49 per cent of its full escrow payment. In other words, the original allocable share release provision created an unintended loophole: it only operated as intended if the NPMs distributed their products nationally. In that circumstance, the NPMs' total escrow obligations to all states with similar tobacco statutes approximately totaled the payments those NPMs would have made under the MSA. If an NPM concentrated its sales in a few state with low allocable share percentages, however, the NPM could obtain a refund of much of its escrow payments. Because the Kansas percentage was so low—roughly 0.8 per cent—NPMs concentrated their sales within Kansas and a few other states to receive immediate escrow refunds from those states.

Rather than selling cigarettes nationally, several NPMs instead concentrated their sales in just a few states. Because the originally enacted escrow statute refunded escrow funds to the extent those funds exceeded each state's "allocable share" of the national MSA payment, NPMs were able to obtain refunds of most of the monies they had paid into a state's escrow fund. To illustrate, if an NPM only sold cigarettes in Kansas in 2006, the Kansas escrow statute would require that NPM to pay into the Kansas escrow fund $.0167539 for each cigarette the NPM sold in that state.&lt;ref&gt;See Kan. Stat. § 50-6a03(b)(1)(D).&lt;/ref&gt; Pursuant to the refund provision in the originally enacted Kansas escrow statute, however, the NPM could obtain a refund of all but .8336712% of those payments.

One commentator further explains that the calculations under the [originally enacted escrow] statutes were based on an assumption that a nonparticipating manufacturer sold cigarettes nationally. When this was the case, the statutes functioned as intended, permitting the NPM to obtain a refund of excess amounts placed in escrow in each state. However, when an NPM followed a regional sales strategy, as several did, the original escrow statutes allowed the NPM to obtain a refund that was much larger than intended.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Validity, Construction, Application, and Effect of Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) Between Tobacco Companies and Various States, and State Statutes Implementing Agreement; Use and Distribution of MSA Proceeds, 25 A.L.R. 6th 435, 461n.13 (2007), at 469 (footnotes omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;

To close this loophole, in late 2002, the National Association of Attorneys General ("NAAG") introduced the Allocable Share Release Repealer ("ASR Repealer"), a model statute which eliminated the ASR. In a memo dated September 12, 2003, Attorney General William H. Sorrell of Vermont, Chairman of the NAAG Tobacco Project, underscored the urgency of "all States taking steps to deal with the proliferation of NPM sales, including enactment of complementary legislation and allocable share legislation and consideration of other measures designed to serve the interests of the States in avoiding reductions in tobacco settlement payments." He stressed that "NPM sales anywhere in the country hurt all States," that NPM sales in any state reduce payments to every other State," and that "[a]ll States have an interest in reducing NPM sales in every State."&lt;ref&gt;Int'l Tobacco Partners, Ltd. v. Kline, 475 F. Supp. 2d 1078, 1083 (D. Kan. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Allocable Share Release Repeal" ("ASR Repeal") revised the originally enacted escrow statute's refund calculation to remove the reference to the enacting state's "allocable share" of the annual MSA payments. HN2The amended statute, therefore, now provides that an NPM will be entitled to a refund[t]o the extent that a tobacco product manufacturer establishes that the amount it was required to place into escrow, based on units sold in the state . . . in a particular year, was greater than the [MSA] payments, as determined pursuant to section IX(i) of that agreement including, after final determination of all adjustments, that such manufacturer would have been required to make based on such units sold had it been a participating manufacturer, the excess shall be released from escrow and revert to such tobacco product manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;Kan. Stat, § 50-6a03(b)(2)(B) (2005); see also Okla. Stat. tit. 37; § 600.23(B)(2). n5&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, an NPM still has to pay annually into a state's escrow fund an amount calculated by multiplying the number of cigarettes the NPM sells in that state during the year in question by the same per-cigarette amount for that year as set forth in the state's escrow statute. The NPM can obtain a refund to the extent those escrowed funds are greater than the amount that the NPM would have had to pay under the MSA for that same year, based upon that same number of cigarettes sold.&lt;ref&gt;KT&amp;G Corp. v. AG of Okla., 535 F.3d 1114, 1124 (10th Cir. Okla. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contraband statutes==
By the middle of 2000, domestic NPMs and importers began to obtain greater market share.&lt;ref&gt;The NPMs sharply increased their share of the domestic market from 1.6 per cent in 1999 to 8.1 percent in 2003. OPM operating incomes declined substantially in 2003, but with the repeals of the allocable share release starting in 2003, their operating incomes increased. In the spring of 2004, Phillip Morris (the largest OPM) and Liggett (the largest SPM) attributed the increase of their gross profit margins to the widespread enactment of the ASR Repealers. PXs 125, 126.&lt;/ref&gt; The NAAG noted that reductions in settlement payments which result from an overall reduction in cigarette consumption benefit the states because health care costs imposed by each cigarette exceed the settlement payments.&lt;ref&gt;The NAAG advised the settling states to enact these model Contraband Statutes promptly or receive lower MSA payments due to increased Volume Adjustments and substantial NPM Downward Adjustments. PX 21. The Volume Adjustment is determined by comparing the number of cigarettes sold nationally by OPMs in a given year with the number sold in the base year of 1997. The resulting percentage reduces the base payment to the states by the PMs. The NPM Downward Adjustment can reduce a settling state's share of the MSA payments if PMs have lost market share due to participation in the MSA and the state did not diligently enforce escrow payments by NPMs.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, when reductions in settlement payments occur because NPM sales displace PM sales, the states receive no benefits if the NPMs do not make escrow payments. Therefore, in late 2000, the NAAG drafted a model Contraband Statute to ensure that NPMs made escrow payments on cigarettes. See PX 116. The model Contraband Statute provides that excise tax stamping agents may not stamp cigarettes for sale in the state unless the manufacturer becomes a PM under the MSA or is an NPM which makes all escrow payments required by the Escrow Statute.&lt;ref&gt;Before the contraband statutes, the states did not have a mechanism to enforce the escrow statute.&lt;/ref&gt; The model Contraband Statute imposes a criminal penalty on wholesalers who sell cigarettes made by NPMs who are not duly registered in the state and making full escrow payments. By the middle of 2002, only seven settling states had enacted Contraband Statutes. As of 2007, 44 of the 46 settling states (including Kansas) have enacted these statutes. See K.S.A. § 50-6a04. The Kansas Attorney General is charged with enforcing the Escrow and Contraband Statutes.&lt;ref&gt;Int'l Tobacco Partners, Ltd. v. Kline, 475 F. Supp. 2d 1078, 1084 (D. Kan. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some anti-smoking advocates, such as William Godshall, have criticized the MSA as being too lenient on the major tobacco companies.  In a speech at the National Tobacco Control Conference, Godshall stated that "[w]ith unprecedented future legal protection granted by the [[State Attorney General|state A.G.s]] in exchange for money, it appears that the tobacco industry has emerged from the state lawsuits even more powerful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://tc.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/8/4/437 |title=Giving 10% to gain eternity |first=William T. |last=Godshall |journal=Tobacco Control |year=1999 |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=437–439 |accessdate=2015-02-28 |doi=10.1136/tc.8.4.437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in the Journal of the [[National Cancer Institute]] described the MSA as an "opportunity lost to curb cigarette use", citing public health researchers' views that not enough of the MSA money was being spent on anti-smoking measures.&lt;ref&gt;
Renee Twombly, Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Vol. 96, No. 10, 730–732,
May 19, 2004 {{doi|10.1093/jnci/96.10.730}},
[http://www.jncicancerspectrum.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/jnci;96/10/730 jncicancerspectrum.oxfordjournals.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Stephen A. Schroeder wrote in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' that "Although U.S. smoking rates are slowly declining, progress toward that end [decreasing smoking] would be faster if federal policymaking matched both the rigor of the scientific evidence against tobacco use and the resolve of antitobacco advocates."&lt;ref&gt;Steven A. Schroeder, ''Tobacco Control in the Wake of the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement'', [[New England Journal of Medicine]], January 15, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cigarette]] consumption in the United States fell to a 50-year low in 2004.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Another criticism is the alleged favoritism shown to the major tobacco companies over smaller independent tobacco growers and sellers. Proponents of this argument claim that certain restrictions on pricing make it more difficult for small growers to compete with "[[Big Tobacco]]". Twelve states have successfully fought against this argument in court during the last two years&lt;!--Vague as time passes--&gt; and the enforcement of the MSA continues throughout the United States in perpetuity.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Fellows within the [[Cato Institute]], such as [[Robert A. Levy|Robert Levy]], assert that the lawsuit that brought on the tobacco settlement was instigated by a need to make beneficiary payments to [[Medicaid]] recipients.  Following the passage of laws that eliminated the tobacco companies' ability to provide evidence in court for their defense, the tobacco companies were forced to settle.  The big four tobacco companies agreed to pay the state governments several billion dollars but the government in turn was to protect the big four tobacco companies from competition.  The Master Settlement Agreement, they argue, created an unconstitutional cartel arrangement that benefited both the government and big tobacco.&lt;ref&gt; {{ cite web | url=https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa371.pdf | doi= | title=Constitutional and Antitrust Violations of the Multistate Tobacco Settlement | last=O’Brien | first=Thomas | publisher=[[Cato Institute]] | date=2000-05-18 | accessdate=2018-07-19 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403075120/https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa371.pdf | archive-date=2015-04-03 | dead-url=no }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reason_Olson &gt; {{ cite web | url=http://reason.com/archives/2000/01/01/puff-the-magic-settlement/print | doi= | title=Puff, the Magic Settlement | last=Olson | first=Walter | publisher=''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' | date=2000-01-01 | accessdate=2018-07-20 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120075258/http://reason.com/archives/2000/01/01/puff-the-magic-settlement/print | archive-date=2011-11-20 | dead-url=no }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Levy states:&lt;blockquote&gt;For 40 years, tobacco companies had not been held liable for cigarette-related illnesses. Then, beginning in 1994, led by Florida, states across the country sued big tobacco to recover public outlays for medical expenses due to smoking. By changing the law to guarantee they would win in court, the states extorted a quarter-trillion-dollar settlement, which was passed along in higher cigarette prices. Basically, the tobacco companies had money; the states and their hired-gun attorneys wanted money; so the companies paid and the states collected. Then sick smokers got stuck with the bill.&lt;ref name=Levy_quote &gt; {{ cite web | url=http://www.cato.org/speakers/levy.html | doi= | title=The Cato Institute Speakers Bureau | last= | first= | publisher=[[Cato Institute]] | date= | accessdate= | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102014055/http://www.cato.org/speakers/levy.html | archive-date=2006-11-02 | dead-url=yes }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The argument the Master Settlement Agreement created a cartel of the major U.S. cigarette makers, allowing them to charge "[[Supracompetitive pricing|supracompetitive]]" prices for their product, was rejected by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="Sanders v. Brown"&gt;[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1137674.html ''Sanders v. Brown'' No. 05-15676, UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT, 504 F.3d 903; 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 22723; 2007-2 Trade Cas.

Brown'', 2008 U.S. LEXIS 4000 (U.S., May 12, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; The appellate court concluded that the Plaintiffs had not alleged sufficient facts to show that the MSA and two related state laws violated the federal Sherman Act.&lt;ref name="Attorney General of California"&gt;[http://ag.ca.gov/tobacco/highlights.php Highlights – Tobacco Litigation &amp; Enforcement]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Securitization==
In the ten years following the settlement, many state and local governments have opted to sell so-called [[tobacco bond]]s. They are a form of [[securitization]]. In many cases the bonds permit state and local governments to transfer the risk of declines in future master settlement agreement payments to bondholders.  In some cases, however, the bonds are backed by secondary pledges of state or local revenues, which creates what some see as a [[perverse incentive]] to support the tobacco industry, on whom they are now dependent for future payments against this debt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://redtape.msnbc.com/2008/11/ten-years-later.html redtape.msnbc.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tobacco revenue has fallen more quickly than projected when the securities were created, leading to technical defaults in some states. Some analysts predict that many of the bonds will default entirely. Many of the longer-term bonds have been downgraded to junk ratings.&lt;ref&gt;"State Bonds in Jeopardy as Tobacco Cash Fades," New York Times, May 4, 2012, p. B1, https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/04/business/state-bonds-backed-by-tobacco-payments-in-jeopardy-of-default.html&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, financial analysts began raising concerns that the rapid growth of the [[electronic cigarette]] market is accelerating the decline of $97 billion outstanding in tobacco bonds.&lt;ref name="DailyVA2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailypress.com/news/politics/dp-nws-evg-tobacco-20141201-story.html | title=Slowing cigarette sales could put Virginia tobacco bond payments at risk | date=1 December 2014 | accessdate=1 December 2014 | author=Ress, D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/tobacco-bonds-feel-heat-from-e-cigarettes-1403648086 | title=Tobacco Bonds Feel Heat From E-Cigarettes | publisher=WSJ | date=24 June 2014 | accessdate=30 October 2014 | author=Kuriloff, A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YF2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/e-cigarettes-could-stub-tobacco-110000689.html | title=E-cigarettes could stub out tobacco bonds sooner than thought | publisher=Yahoo Finance | date=24 June 2014 | accessdate=30 October 2014 | author=Respaut, Robin}}&lt;/ref&gt; States with large populations, such as New York and California, are affected to a greater degree than others.&lt;ref name="YF2014"/&gt; Lawmakers in several states proposed measures to tax e-cigarettes like traditional tobacco products to offset the decline in TMSA revenue. They anticipate that taxing or banning e-cigarettes would be beneficial to the sale of combustible cigarettes.&lt;ref name="WSJ2014"/&gt;

==Individual state settlements==
There is technically a distinct MSA signed separately with each state.  While these MSAs are identical, the states have had to enact enabling legislation which differs from state to state.  Furthermore, each state's court system is entitled to create its own jurisdictional interpretations of the MSA text.  As a result, legal understanding of the MSA differ from state to state.

===By state===

'''Triplegia''' is a medical condition characterized by the [[paralysis]] of three limbs ([http://www.medical-artist.com/assets/images/Triplegia-muscle.jpg Triplegia Muscle Anatomy]) . A person with triplegia can be referred to as triplegic. While there is no typical pattern of involvement, it is usually associated with paralysis of both legs and one arm — but can also involve both arms and one leg.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=F. |last2=Backrach |first2=S. J. |date=1995 |title=Cerebral Palsy: A Complete Guide for Caregiving |journal=Johns Hopkins University Press |page=433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Triplegia can sometimes be considered a combination of [[hemiplegia]] (paralysis of arm and leg of one side of the body) overlaying [[diplegia]] (paralysis of both legs), or as [[quadriplegia]] (paralysis of four limbs) with less involvement in one extremity.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

The condition is commonly associated with [[cerebral palsy]], although conditions such as [[stroke]] can also lead to it. Triplegia has also been found to be due to an increase in [[intracranial pressure]] associated with [[hydrocephalus]] resulting from [[traumatic brain injury]].&lt;ref name=Sheffler&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sheffler |first1=Lynne R. |last2=Ito |first2=Valerie Y. |last3=Philip |first3=Puliyodil A. |last4=Sahgal |first4=Vinod |date=March 1994 |title=Shunting in chronic post-traumatic hydrocephalus: demonstration of neurophysiologic improvement |journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation |volume=75 |issue=3 |pages=338–341 |doi=10.1016/0003-9993(94)90039-6 |pmid=8129589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar condition is [[triparesis]], in which the patient suffers from [[paresis]] in three limbs, meaning that the limbs are very weak, but not completely paralyzed.

In a case reported only due to its rarity, triplegia was reported following a [[tonsillectomy]] (surgical removal of the tonsils). An eight-year-old male patient was sent to [[Willard Parker Hospital]] on August 12, 1929 and had been diagnosed with [[poliomyelitis]]. After an unrelated, and routine, tonsillectomy there was complete flaccid paralysis and loss of feeling in both the legs, right arm, and muscles in the trunk.&lt;ref name=Brahdy&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brahdy |first=B. |date=1935 |title=TRIPLEGIA FOLLOWING TONSILLECTOMY |journal=Am J Dis Child |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=716–721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wilcox Medical Center''' is part of [[Hawaii Pacific Health]]'s network. One of [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i island]]'s three hospitals, Wilcox Medical Center provides Kaua{{okina}}i residents with an imaging center, [[emergency department]], and surgical center.

==History==
[[George Norton Wilcox]] and Dora Isenberg planned a community hospital with a staff open to all eligible physicians on Kaua{{okina}}i. It opened on November 1, 1938, with the official dedication of a T-shaped two-story building on {{convert|17|acre}} of land donated by the Lihue Plantation. It was built at a cost of $200,000. More than 1,000  Kaua{{okina}}i residents attended the ceremony, and 15 days later the new 96-bed hospital accepted its first patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hawaiipacifichealth.org/wilcox/about-us/legacy/|title=Wilcox - About Us - Legacy|website=www.hawaiipacifichealth.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodic expansion programs continued over the years. The first expansion took place from 1955 to 1958 with the addition of a kitchen, an obstetrical wing, medical library, conference room and additional space for laboratory and X-ray departments. Another milestone was reached in 1966 with the advent of the Outpatient Department built adjacent to the main hospital. Plantation dispensaries were phased out at this time and the eastside physicians began practice in the facilities, later forming the Kauai Medical Group Inc.

The third expansion was completed in August 1971 and resulted in the present $4.2 million Acute Patient Care Tower and Special Diagnostic and Treatment Facility. A laboratory and physical therapy building opened in 1977.

Since then, remodeling and renovation has been ongoing to accommodate the hospital's many new services and programs, which includes an Intensive Care Unit, Coronary Care Unit and a CT and MRI facility in the Imaging Department, which was renovated and expanded to include more exam space and updated equipment. In 2005, the department was named the Wilcox Family Imaging Center after the Wilcox family of Kaua{{okina}}i.

Wilcox Medical Center treated surfer [[Bethany Hamilton]] after she lost her arm to a {{convert|14|ft|m|adj=mid}} [[tiger shark]] off the north shore of Kaua{{okina}}i.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/713030349|title=Bethany Hamilton : follow your dreams!|last=1965-|first=Sandler, Michael,|date=2007|publisher=Bearport Pub|isbn=9781597164368|location=New York|oclc=713030349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Wilcox Health Women's Center opened to provide preventive and diagnostic care for Kaua{{okina}}i's women.

'''Wolfson Children’s Hospital of Jacksonville''', is a 216-bed children’s [[hospital]] in based in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. It is part of five-hospital [[Baptist Health]], also in Jacksonville, Florida.

==Overview==
In 2016, [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] named Wolfson Children’s Hospital among the nation’s top 50 hospitals for neurology and neurosurgery, and gastroenterology and GI surgery. Wolfson Children’s Hospital achieved [[Magnet]] status by the [[American Nurses Credentialing Center]] in 2007 and again in 2012 and 2017, an international recognition of excellence in patient care.

A not-for-profit children’s hospital that serves 157,000+ patients from birth to 21 years of age annually, Wolfson Children’s Hospital offers 30+ pediatric medical and surgical specialities through its long-time partnerships with [[Nemours Children’s Specialty Care]], Jacksonville, and the [[University of Florida College of Medicine -- Jacksonville]] and [[Mayo Clinic Hospital]] in Florida.

==History==
In 1946, Morris David Wolfson wrote a letter to his sons, Sam Wolfson, [[Louis Wolfson]], Saul Wolfson, Cecil Wolfson, and Nathan Wolfson asking them to build a children’s facility in Jacksonville, Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wolfsonchildrens.com/about-us/Pages/heritage.aspx|title=Wolfson Children's Hospital Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; A $500,000 donation from the Wolfson Family Foundation led to the establishment of Wolfson Children’s Memorial Hospital, a 50-bed pediatric wing at Baptist Memorial Hospital (now Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville) in 1955.

The hospital grew incrementally during its early years, particularly in 1971, when pediatricians with the Northeast Florida Pediatric Society signed an agreement stating that a consolidated center of excellence would be the best way to serve the region's children and families.

In 1987, Wolfson and Nemours Children’s Specialty Care, Jacksonville, began their affiliation to better serve the area's children. Wolfson also began an academic affiliation with the University of Florida College of Medicine – Jacksonville in the 1990s, training pediatric residents, fellows and other professionals in pediatric medicine.

In 1993, a new Wolfson Children’s Hospital opened, offering a range of inpatient and outpatient services, including a [[Neonatal intensive care unit#Level III .28neonatal intensive-care unit.29|level III]] [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit]]; [[Pediatric Intensive Care Unit]]; Children's Emergency Center; and specialized programs such as pediatric oncology, radiology, pathology and research.

Since 2011, the hospital has also expanded regionally, opening Wolfson Children’s Specialty Centers in [[Lake City, Florida]]; [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]; [[Brunswick, Georgia]] (in partnership with Southeast Georgia Health System); at the Baptist Clay Medical Campus in [[Fleming Island, Florida]]; and in [[Tallahassee, Florida]] (in partnership with [[Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare]]).

In 2012, Wolfson Children’s Hospital expanded with the opening of the new J. Wayne and Delores Barr Weaver Tower on the Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville campus. The hospital continues to expand its number of specialized services, and to provide child health advocacy outside of hospital walls through THE PLAYERS Center for Child Health, which offers education, childhood injury prevention, and legislative efforts to improve health care access for children.

==Foundation==
In 1985, the Baptist Health Foundation was created to assist in fundraising for Baptist Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/stories/2004/06/21/daily3.html|title=Daily |date=June 21, 2004 |publisher=Jacksonville Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation coordinates gifts and fundraising for Wolfson Children's Hospital in addition to four adult Baptist Health hospitals.

The hospital’s major fundraising event is the [http://www.wolfsonchildrenschallenge.com Wolfson Children’s Challenge], an annual event that features a 55K Ultra Marathon, 55K Ultra Relay, 30K Individual Run, 1-Mile Fun Run, and family-friendly activities.
 
Another signature event is [http://www.christmasjuly.com Christmas in July], always held on July 25 each year, to collect toys and donations to help the hospital’s Child Life Department normalize the hospital experience and provide distraction through toy and play.

'''Young Lives''' is an international research project on childhood poverty that was established in 2000 and is coordinated by a team based at the [[University of Oxford]]'s Department of International Development (Queen Elizabeth House), [[Great Britain]].

Young Lives, by its declaration, is tracing the changing lives of 12,000 children in Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh), Peru and Vietnam over a 15-year period. This is the time frame set by the UN to assess progress towards the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. Through interviews, group work and case studies with the children, their parents, teachers, community representatives and others, the project is collecting information not only about their material and social circumstances, but also their perspectives on their lives and aspirations for the futures, set against the environmental and social realities of their communities.

Young Lives is following two groups of children in each country:
* 2,000 children who were born in 2001-02
* 1,000 children who were born in 1994-95.

These groups provide insights into every phase of childhood. The younger children are being tracked from infancy to their mid-teens and the older children through into adulthood, when some will become parents themselves. When this is matched with information gathered about their parents, it is possible to reveal much about the inter generational transmission of poverty, how families on the margins move in and out of poverty, and the policies that can make a real difference to their lives.

The research concentrates on 4 countries: [[Ethiopia]], [[India]] ([[Andhra Pradesh]]), [[Peru]] and [[Vietnam]], chosen because they reflect a wide range of cultural, political, geographical and social contexts. They face some of the common issues experienced by developing countries, such as high debt burden, post-conflict reconstruction and adverse environmental conditions such as drought and flood. By covering these countries, Young Lives aims to reveal patterns, commonalities and differences in four very different contexts where childhood - especially childhood poverty - is changing.

The project is core-funded by the UK [[Department for International Development]] (DFID), with sub-studies funded by [[International Development Research Center]] (IDRC) (in [[Ethiopia]]), [[UNICEF]] (in [[India]]), [[Irish Aid]] (in Vietnam) and the [[Bernard van Leer Foundation]] (in [[India]] and [[Peru]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/page.aspx?&amp;sitesectionid=904&amp;sitesectiontitle=Young+Lives Centre for Longitudinal Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Declared objectives ==
* provide good-quality information about the lives of children in different contexts;
* identify ways poverty affects children’s lives and their future prospects;
* better understand how poverty is transferred from one generation to another;
* trace linkages between key policy changes and children’s well-being;
* promote effective and sustainable poverty reduction policies;
* build capacity for and understanding of longitudinal research in the four study countries.
