'''1345 Avenue of the Americas''', also known as the '''[[Alliance Bernstein]] Building''', is a  625&amp;nbsp;ft (191m) tall [[skyscraper]] in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/building/1345-avenue-of-the-americas/1961|title=1345 Avenue of the Americas| website=The Skyscraper Center |access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located on [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] between [[54th Street (Manhattan)|54th]] and 55th Streets, the 50 story building was built by [[Fisher Brothers]] and completed in 1969.  Originally known as '''[[Burlington Industries|Burlington House]]''', the building was designed by [[Emery Roth &amp; Sons]] and is the 68th tallest in New York City.  It is an unrelieved slab structure in the [[International style (architecture)|International Style]], sometimes referred to as "corporate" style, faced with dark glass. Its small plaza is dominated by its sprinkling fountain like a dandelion seedhead. It replaced the original [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1927)|Ziegfeld Theatre]].

A [[base station]] atop the building was used on April 3, 1973, by [[Martin Cooper (inventor)|Martin Cooper]] to make the world's first handheld [[mobile phone|cellular phone]] call in public. Cooper, a [[Motorola]] inventor, called rival [[Joel S. Engel]] of [[Bell Labs]] to tell him about the invention.  Engel was staying across the street in the [[Hilton New York]].

In the film ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (2007), 1345 Avenue of the Americas is the building [[Gwen Stacy]] fell from in the crane scene. It also served as the foyer for the fictional law firm in the film [[Michael Clayton (film)|Michael Clayton]] (2007).

==Etymology==
[[File:Hauptbuch Hochstetter vor 1828.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Early 19th-century [[ledger]].]]
Both the words accounting and accountancy were in use in [[Great Britain]] by the mid-1800s, and are derived from the words ''accompting'' and ''accountantship'' used in the 18th century.&lt;ref name = "LN 2009"&gt;Labardin, Pierre, and Marc Nikitin. 2009. “Accounting and the Words to Tell It: An Historical Perspective.” ''Accounting, Business &amp; Financial History'' 19 (2): 149–166.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Middle English]] (used roughly between the 12th and the late 15th century) the verb "to account" had the form ''accounten'', which was derived from the Old French word ''aconter'',&lt;ref name = "B 1984"&gt;Baladouni, Vahé. 1984. “Etymological Observations on Some Accounting Terms.” ''The Accounting Historians Journal'' 11 (2): 101–109.&lt;/ref&gt; which is in turn related to the [[Vulgar Latin]] word ''computare'', meaning "to reckon". The base of ''computare'' is ''putare'', which "variously meant to prune, to purify, to correct an account, hence, to count or calculate, as well as to think."&lt;ref name = "B 1984"/&gt;

The word "[[accountant]]" is derived from the French word {{lang|fr|compter}}, which is also derived from the Italian and [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|computare}}. The word was formerly written in English as "accomptant", but in process of time the word, which was always pronounced by dropping the "p", became gradually changed both in [[pronunciation]] and in [[orthography]] to its present form.&lt;ref&gt;Pixley, Francis William: Accountancy—constructive and recording accountancy (Sir Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons, Ltd, London, 1900), p4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accounting and accountancy ===
'''Accounting''' has variously been defined as the keeping or preparation of the financial records of an entity, the analysis, verification and reporting of such records and "the [[Generally accepted accounting principles|principles]] and procedures of accounting"; it also refers to the [[Job (role)|job]] of being an [[accountant]].&lt;ref name = "Cambridge Business Accounting"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/business-english/accounting |title=accounting noun - definition in the Business English Dictionary |year=2013 |website=Cambridge Dictionaries Online |publisher=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cambridge British Accounting"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/accounting?q=accounting |title=accounting noun - definition in the British English Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus |year=2013 |website=Cambridge Dictionaries Online |publisher=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "MW 2013 accounting"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/accounting |title=accounting |year=2013 |website=Merriam-Webster |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Topics ==
Accounting has several subfields or subject areas, including [[financial accounting]], [[management accounting]], [[auditing]], [[taxation]] and [[accounting information system]]s.&lt;ref name = "WC 1981"&gt;Weber, Richard P., and W. C. Stevenson. 1981. “Evaluations of Accounting Journal and Department Quality.” The Accounting Review 56 (3): 596–612.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial accounting===
{{main article|Financial accounting}}
Financial accounting focuses on the reporting of an organization's financial information to external users of the information, such as investors, potential investors and creditors. It calculates and records business transactions and prepares [[financial statement]]s for the external users in accordance with [[generally accepted accounting principles]] (GAAP).&lt;ref name = "HDF 2006"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; GAAP, in turn, arises from the wide agreement between [[accounting research|accounting theory]] and practice, and change over time to meet the needs of decision-makers.&lt;ref name = "NP 2013" /&gt;

Financial accounting produces past-oriented reports—for example the financial statements prepared in 2006 reports on performance in 2005—on an [[Annual report|annual]] or quarterly basis, generally about the organization as a whole.&lt;ref name = "HDF 2006" /&gt;

This branch of accounting is also studied as part of the board exams for qualifying as an actuary. These two types of professionals, accountants and actuaries, have created a culture of being archrivals.

===Management accounting===
{{main article|Management accounting}}
Management accounting focuses on the measurement, analysis and reporting of information that can help managers in making decisions to fulfill the goals of an organization. In management accounting, internal measures and reports are based on [[cost-benefit analysis]], and are not required to follow the generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP).&lt;ref name = "HDF 2006" /&gt; In 2014 CIMA created the [http://www.cgma.org/Resources/Reports/Pages/GlobalManagementAccountingPrinciples.aspx Global Management Accounting Principles (GMAPs)]. The result of research from across 20 countries in five continents, the principles aim to guide best practice in the discipline.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;{{cite web|last=King|first=I.|title=New set of accounting principles can help drive sustainable success|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0b595a98-59fa-11e4-8771-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=uk#axzz3Q8Lp1OP9|publisher=ft.com|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Management accounting produces future-oriented reports—for example the budget for 2006 is prepared in 2005—and the time span of reports varies widely. Such reports may include both financial and non financial information, and may, for example, focus on specific products and departments.&lt;ref name = "HDF 2006" /&gt;

===Auditing===
{{main article|Financial audit|Internal audit}}
Auditing is the verification of assertions made by others regarding a payoff,&lt;ref name = "B 1979"&gt;Baiman, Stanley. 1979. “Discussion of Auditing: Incentives and Truthful Reporting.” Journal of Accounting Research 17: 25–29.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the context of accounting it is the "[[wiktionary:unbiased|unbiased]] examination and evaluation of the financial statements of an organization".&lt;ref name = "I 2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/audit.asp |title=Audit Definition |year=2013 |website=Investopedia |publisher= Investopedia US |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audit is a professional service that is systematic and conventional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tredinnick|first1=Luke|title=Artificial intelligence and professional roles|journal=Business Information Review|date=March 2017|volume=34|issue=1|pages=37–41|doi=10.1177/0266382117692621}}&lt;/ref&gt;


An audit of financial statements aims to express or disclaim an opinion on the financial statements. The auditor expresses an opinion on the fairness with which the financial statements presents the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of an entity, in accordance with the  generally acceptable accounting principle  (GAAP) and "in all material respects". An auditor is also required to identify circumstances in which the generally acceptable accounting principles (GAAP) has not been consistently observed.&lt;ref name = "SAS 1 Responsibilities"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aicpa.org/Research/Standards/AuditAttest/DownloadableDocuments/AU-00110.pdf |title=Responsibilities and Functions of the Independent Auditor |date=November 1972 |website=AICPA |publisher=AICPA |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accounting information systems===
{{main article|Accounting information system}}
An accounting information system is a part of an organization's [[information system]] that focuses on processing accounting data.&lt;ref name=OpenLearn&gt;{{cite web|title=1.2 Accounting information systems|url=http://labspace.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=365833|work=Introduction to the context of accounting|publisher=OpenLearn|accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AI is also used in cybersecurity industry. It involves computer hardware and software systems and using statistics and modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pathak|first1=Jagdish|last2=Lind|first2=Mary R.|title=Audit Risk, Complex Technology, and Auditing Processes|journal=EDPACS|date=November 2003|volume=31|issue=5|pages=1–9|doi=10.1201/1079/43853.31.5.20031101/78844.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax accounting===
{{main article|Tax accounting}}
Tax accounting in the United States concentrates on the preparation, analysis and presentation of tax payments and tax returns. The U.S. tax  system requires the use of specialised accounting principles for tax purposes which can differ from the [[generally accepted accounting principles]] (GAAP) for financial reporting.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2010"&gt;{{ Citation | last = Droms| first= William G.| last2= Wright| first2= Jay O.| title= Finance and Accounting for nonfinancial Managers: All the Basics you need to Know| publisher= Basic Books, 2010| year= 2010| edition= 6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. tax law covers four basic forms of business ownership: [[sole proprietorship]], [[partnership]], [[corporation]], and [[limited liability company]]. [[Corporate tax in the United States|Corporate]] and [[Income tax in the United States|personal]] income are taxed at different rates, both varying according to income levels and including varying marginal rates (taxed on each additional dollar of income) and average rates (set as a percentage of overall income).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2010"/&gt;

===Forensic accounting===
{{main article|Forensic accounting}}

Forensic accounting is a specialty practice area of accounting that describes engagements that result from actual or anticipated disputes or [[litigation]]. "[[Forensic science|Forensic]]" means "suitable for use in a court of law," and it is to that standard and potential outcome that forensic accountants generally have to work.

[[Professional accounting bodies]] include the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA) and the other 179 members of the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC),&lt;ref name="ifac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifac.org/about-ifac/membership/members|title= IFAC Members |publisher=ifac.org|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland]] (ICAS), [[CPA Australia]], [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]] (ACCA) and [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] (ICAEW). Professional bodies for subfields of the accounting professions also exist, for example the [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]] (CIMA).&lt;ref name="Prince"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accountingforsustainability.org/international_network/accounting-bodies-network |title=Accounting Bodies Network |year= |website=The Prince's Accounting for Sustainability Project |publisher= |accessdate=3 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103155739/http://www.accountingforsustainability.org/international_network/accounting-bodies-network |archive-date=3 January 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these professional bodies offer education and training including qualification and administration for various accounting designations, such as certified public accountant and [[chartered accountant]].&lt;ref name = "AICPA CPA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aicpa.org/BecomeACPA/GettingStarted/Pages/default.aspx |title=Getting Started  |year=2014 |website=AICPA |publisher=AICPA |accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ICAEW ACA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icaew.com/en/qualifications-and-programmes/aca |title=The ACA Qualification  |year=2014 |website=ICAEW |publisher=ICAEW |accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accounting firms ===
{{main article|Accounting networks and associations}}
Depending on its size, a company may be legally required to have their [[financial statement]]s [[auditing|audited]] by a qualified auditor, and audits are usually carried out by [[Accounting networks and associations|accounting firms]].&lt;ref name = "Parliament Auditors 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldselect/ldeconaf/119/11904.htm |title= Auditors: Market concentration and their role, CHAPTER 1: Introduction  |year=2011 |website=UK Parliament |publisher=House of Lords |accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounting firms grew in the United States and Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and through several mergers there were large international accounting firms by the mid-twentieth century. Further large mergers in the late twentieth century led to the dominance of the auditing market by the "Big Five" accounting firms: [[Arthur Andersen]], [[Deloitte]], [[Ernst &amp; Young]], [[KPMG]] and [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]].&lt;ref name = "Parliament Auditors 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldselect/ldeconaf/119/11905.htm |title= Auditors: Market concentration and their role, CHAPTER 2: Concentration in the audit market |year=2011 |website=UK Parliament |publisher=House of Lords |accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arthur Andersen#Demise|demise of Arthur Andersen]] following the [[Enron scandal]] reduced the Big Five to the [[Big Four (audit firms)|Big Four]].&lt;ref name = "FT Big Four"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=big-four |title= Definition of big four  |year=2014 |website=Financial Times Lexicon |publisher=The Financial Times Ltd |accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Standard-setters ===
{{See also|Accounting standards|Convergence of accounting standards}}
[[Generally accepted accounting principles]] (GAAP) are accounting standards issued by national regulatory bodies. In addition, the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB) issues the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS) implemented by 147 countries.&lt;ref name = "NP 2013" /&gt; While standards for international audit and assurance, ethics, education, and public sector accounting are all set by independent standard settings boards supported by IFAC. The International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board sets international standards for auditing, assurance, and quality control; the [[International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants]] (IESBA) &lt;ref name="ifac2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifac.org/ethics|title=IESBA &amp;#124; Ethics &amp;#124; Accounting &amp;#124; IFAC|publisher=ifac.org|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; sets the internationally appropriate principles- based ''Code of Ethics for Professional Accounts'' the [[International Accounting Education Standards Board]] (IAESB) sets professional accounting education standards;&lt;ref name="ifac3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifac.org/education|title=IAESB &amp;#124; International Accounting Education Standards Board &amp;#124; IFAC|publisher=ifac.org|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Public Sector Accounting Standards]] Board (IPSASB) sets accrual-based international public sector accounting standards &lt;ref name="ifac4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifac.org/public-sector|title=IPSASB &amp;#124; International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board &amp;#124; IFAC |publisher=ifac.org|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations in individual countries may issue accounting standards unique to the countries. For example, in the [[United States]] the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB) issues the Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, which form the basis of [[US GAAP]],&lt;ref name = "NP 2013" /&gt; and in the [[United Kingdom]] the [[Financial Reporting Council]] (FRC) sets accounting standards.&lt;ref name="ICAEW Standards"&gt;{{Citation | url =http://www.icaew.com/en/library/subject-gateways/accounting-standards/knowledge-guide-to-uk-accounting-standards | title = Knowledge guide to UK Accounting Standards | publisher =ICAEW | year=2014 | accessdate =1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2012 "all major economies" have plans to [[Convergence (accounting)|converge]] towards or adopt the IFRS.&lt;ref name=globalcon /&gt;

== Education and qualifications ==

=== Accounting degrees ===
At least a [[bachelor's degree]] in accounting or a related field is required for most accountant and [[auditor]] [[Job (role)|job positions]], and some employers prefer applicants with a [[master's degree]].&lt;ref name = "BLS 2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Business-and-Financial/Accountants-and-auditors.htm#tab-4 |title=How to Become an Accountant or Auditor |year=2012 |website=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics |publisher=United States Department of Labor |accessdate=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A degree in accounting may also be required for, or may be used to fulfill the requirements for, membership to professional accounting bodies. For example, the education during an accounting degree can be used to fulfill the [[AICPA|American Institute of CPA's]] (AICPA) 150 semester hour requirement,&lt;ref name = "AICPA 150"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aicpa.org/becomeacpa/licensure/requirements/pages/default.aspx |title= 150 Hour Requirement for Obtaining CPA Certification |year=2013 |website=AICPA |publisher=AICPA |accessdate=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and associate membership with the [[Certified Public Accountants Association]] of the UK is available after gaining a degree in finance or accounting.&lt;ref name="ACPA Criteria"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acpa.org.uk/criteria-for-entry.aspx |title=Criteria for entry |year=2013 |website=CPA UK |publisher=CPA UK |accessdate=31 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819184954/http://acpa.org.uk/criteria-for-entry.aspx |archivedate=19 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accounting research ==

Accounting research is carried out both by academic researchers and practicing accountants. [[Methodology|Methodologies]] in academic accounting research include archival research, which examines "objective data collected from [[Information repository|repositories]]"; experimental research, which examines data "the researcher gathered by [[Controlled experiments|administering treatments to subjects]]"; analytical research, which is "based on the act of [[Scientific modelling|formally modeling]] [[Theory|theories]] or substantiating ideas in mathematical terms"; [[interpretivism|interpretive]] research, which emphasizes the role of language, interpretation and understanding in accounting practice, "highlighting the symbolic structures and taken-for-granted themes which pattern the world in distinct ways"; [[critical theory|critical]] research, which emphasizes the role of power and conflict in accounting practice; [[Case study|case studies]]; [[computer simulation]]; and [[field research]].&lt;ref name="CSWW 2010"&gt;Coyne, Joshua G., Scott L.

==Accounting information system==
{{no footnotes|section|date=January 2017}}
{{main article|Accounting information system}}
Many accounting practices have been simplified with the help of accounting computer-based software. An [[Enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) system is commonly used for a large organisation and it provides a comprehensive, centralized, integrated source of information that companies can use to manage all major business processes, from purchasing to manufacturing to human resources.

[[Accounting information system]]s have reduced the cost of accumulating, storing, and reporting managerial accounting information and have made it possible to produce a more detailed account of all data that is entered into any given system.

==Accounting scandals==
{{Main article|Accounting scandals}}
{{See also|Accounting ethics}}
The year 2001 witnessed a series of financial information frauds involving [[Enron]], auditing firm [[Arthur Andersen]], the telecommunications company [[WorldCom]], [[Qwest]] and [[Jarden|Sunbeam]], among other well-known corporations. These problems highlighted the need to review the effectiveness of [[Standard accounting practice|accounting standards]], auditing regulations and [[corporate governance]] principles. In some cases, management manipulated the figures shown in financial reports to indicate a better economic performance. In others, tax and regulatory incentives encouraged over-leveraging of companies and decisions to bear extraordinary and unjustified risk.&lt;ref name="mba.ufm.edu.gt"&gt;Astrid Ayala and Giancarlo Ibárgüen Snr.: "A Market Proposal for Auditing the Financial Statements of Public Companies" (Journal of Management of Value, [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]], March 2006) p. 41, [https://www.webcitation.org/5liW7XCb0?url=http://www.mba.ufm.edu.gt/journalofmanagement/content/ENG_MarketProposal.pdf UFM.edu.gt]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Enron scandal]] deeply influenced the development of new [[regulations]] to improve the reliability of financial reporting, and increased public awareness about the importance of having accounting standards that show the financial reality of companies and the objectivity and independence of auditing firms.&lt;ref name="mba.ufm.edu.gt"/&gt;

In addition to being the largest [[bankruptcy]] reorganization in American history, the [[Enron scandal]] undoubtedly is the biggest audit failure.&lt;ref&gt;Bratton, William W. "Enron and the Dark Side of Shareholder Value" ([[Tulane Law Review]], New Orleans, May 2002) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; It involved a [[Accounting scandals|financial scandal]] of [[Enron|Enron Corporation]] and their auditors [[Arthur Andersen]], which was revealed in late 2001. The scandal caused the dissolution of [[Arthur Andersen]], which at the time was one of the five largest accounting firms in the world. After a series of revelations involving irregular accounting procedures conducted throughout the 1990s, Enron filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection in December 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Enron files for bankruptcy | publisher = BBC News | date = 2001-12-03 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1688550.stm | accessdate = 15 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One consequence of these events was the passage of [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] in the [[United States]] 2002, as a result of the first admissions of fraudulent behavior made by Enron. The act significantly raises criminal penalties for [[securities fraud]], for destroying, altering or fabricating records in federal investigations or any scheme or attempt to defraud shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;Aiyesha Dey, and Thomas Z. Lys: "Trends in Earnings Management and Informativeness of Earnings Announcements in the Pre- and Post-Sarbanes Oxley Periods ([[Kellogg School of Management]], Evanston, Illinois, February, 2005) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:British Airways in TXL.jpg|thumb|A [[British Airways]] A320 at Berlin Tegel.]]An '''airline''' is a company that provides [[civil aviation|air transport services]] for traveling [[passenger]]s and [[freight]]. Airlines utilize [[aircraft]] to supply these services and may form [[partnership]]s or [[Airline alliance|alliances]] with other airlines for [[codeshare agreement]]s. Generally, airline companies are recognized with an [[Air operator's certificate|air operating certificate]] or license issued by a governmental aviation body.

Airlines vary in size, from small domestic airlines to full-service international airlines with double decker airplanes. Airline services can be categorized as being intercontinental, domestic, regional, or international, and may be operated as scheduled services or [[Air charter|charters]]. The [[World's largest airlines|largest airline]] currently is [[American Airlines Group]].

Its headquarters were in [[Frankfurt]]. The first fixed wing scheduled air service was started on January 1, 1914, from [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], to [[Tampa, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/16657-worlds-first-commercial-airline-the-greatest-moments-in-flight.html|title=World’s First Commercial Airline {{!}} The Greatest Moments in Flight|work=Space.com|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four [[List of airlines by foundation|oldest non-dirigible airlines]] that still exist are Netherlands' [[KLM]] (1919),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.klm.com/corporate/en/about-klm/history/index.html|title=History - KLM Corporate|access-date=2017-10-14|language=nl-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colombia's [[Avianca]] (1919),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviancaholdings.com/en/history|title=History - Avianca Holdings S.A. - www.aviancaholdings.com|website=www.aviancaholdings.com|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia's [[Qantas]] (1921),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.qantas.com/travel/airlines/history-founders/global/en|title=Founders of Qantas {{!}} Qantas|website=www.qantas.com|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Czech Republic's [[Czech Airlines]] (1923).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.csa.cz/cz-en/about-us/|title=About Us {{!}} Czech Airlines|website=ČSA.cz|language=en|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European airline industry===
====Beginnings====
[[File:KLM Boeing 777-200ER Closeup PH-BQO YUL.jpg|thumb|Founded on 7 October 1919, [[KLM]] is the [[List of airlines by foundation date|oldest running airline still operating under its original name]].]]
[[File:Tanken van een vliegtuig Airplane provided with fuel.jpg|thumb|The [[Handley Page Type W|Handley Page W.8b]] was used by [[Handley Page Transport]], an early British airline established in 1919.]]
The earliest fixed wing airline in Europe was [[Aircraft Transport and Travel]], formed by [[George Holt Thomas]] in 1916; via a series of takeovers and mergers, this company is an ancestor of modern-day [[British Airways]]. Using a fleet of former military [[Airco DH.4]]A biplanes that had been modified to carry two passengers in the [[fuselage]], it operated relief flights between [[Folkestone]] and [[Ghent]]. On 15 July 1919, the company flew a proving flight across the [[English Channel]], despite a lack of support from the British government. Flown by Lt. H Shaw in an [[Airco DH.9]] between [[RAF Hendon]] and [[Paris – Le Bourget Airport]], the flight took 2 hours and 30 minutes at £21 per passenger.

On 25 August 1919, the company used [[Airco DH.16|DH.16s]] to pioneer a regular service from [[Hounslow Heath Aerodrome]] to Le Bourget, the first regular international service in the world. The airline soon gained a reputation for reliability, despite problems with bad weather, and began to attract European competition. In November 1919, it won the first British civil [[airmail]] contract. Six [[Royal Air Force]] [[Airco DH.9A]] aircraft were lent to the company, to operate the airmail service between [[Hawkinge]] and [[Cologne]]. In 1920, they were returned to the Royal Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;''The Putnam Aeronautical Review'' edited by John Motum, p170 Volume one 1990 Naval Institute Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Other British competitors were quick to follow – [[Handley Page Transport]] was established in 1919 and used the company's converted [[World War One|wartime]] [[Handley Page Type O|Type O/400]] [[bomber]]s with a capacity for 12 passengers,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1961/1961%20-%200055.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; to run a [[London]]-[[Paris]] passenger service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airlinehistory.co.uk/Airline%20History/History1903.asp|title=Airline History 1903 to 1919|website=www.airlinehistory.co.uk|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first French airline was [[Aéropostale (aviation)|Société des lignes Latécoère]], later known as Aéropostale, which started its first service in late 1918 to Spain. The [[Société Générale des Transports Aériens]] was created in late 1919, by the [[Farman]] brothers and the [[Farman F.60 Goliath]] plane flew scheduled services from [[Toussus-le-Noble]] to [[Kenley]], near [[Croydon]], England. Another early French airline was the [[Compagnie des Messageries Aériennes]], established in 1919 by [[Louis-Charles Breguet]], offering a mail and freight service between [[Paris – Le Bourget Airport|Le Bourget Airport]], [[Paris]] and [[Lesquin Airport]], [[Lille]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/milestones-of-flight/world/1919.cfm |title=World Aviation in 1919 - Part 1 |publisher=Royal Air Force Museum |accessdate=28 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105130943/http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/milestones-of-flight/world/1919.cfm |archivedate=5 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00007, Berlin, Start eines Junkers-Flugzeuges.jpg|thumb| [[Junkers F.13]] ''D-190'' of [[Junkers Luftverkehr]]]]
The first German airline to use heavier than air aircraft was [[Deutsche Luft-Reederei]] established in 1917 which started operating in February 1919. In its first year, the D.L.R. operated regularly scheduled flights on routes with a combined length of nearly 1000 miles. By 1921 the D.L.R. network was more than 3000&amp;nbsp;km (1865 miles) long, and included destinations in the Netherlands, Scandinavia and the Baltic Republics. Another important German airline was [[Junkers Luftverkehr]], which began operations in 1921. It was a division of the aircraft manufacturer [[Junkers]], which became a separate company in 1924. It operated joint-venture airlines in Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Norway, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland.

[[File:Klm-poster-1919.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A 1919 advertisement for the Dutch airline [[KLM]]]]
The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] airline [[KLM]] made its first flight in 1920, and is the oldest continuously operating airline in the world. Established by aviator [[Albert Plesman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=International Directory of Company Histories|year=1999|volume=28|title=Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij, N.V. History| url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/koninklijke-luchtvaart-maatschappij-n-v-history/|accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was immediately awarded a "Royal" predicate from [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.klm.com/corporate/en/about-klm/history/index.html|work=KLM Corporate|publisher=KLM|accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first flight was from [[Croydon Airport]], [[London]] to [[Amsterdam]], using a leased [[Aircraft Transport and Travel]] [[Airco DH.16|DH-16]], and carrying two British journalists and a number of newspapers. In 1921, KLM started scheduled services.

In [[Finland]], the charter establishing Aero O/Y (now [[Finnair]]) was signed in the city of [[Helsinki]] on September 12, 1923. [[Junkers F.13]] D-335 became the first aircraft of the company, when Aero took delivery of it on March 14, 1924. The first flight was between Helsinki and [[Tallinn]], capital of [[Estonia]], and it took place on March 20, 1924, one week later.

In the [[Soviet Union]], the Chief Administration of the Civil Air Fleet was established in 1921. One of its first acts was to help found Deutsch-Russische Luftverkehrs A.G. (Deruluft), a German-Russian joint venture to provide air transport from Russia to the West. Domestic air service began around the same time, when Dobrolyot started operations on 15 July 1923 between Moscow and Nizhni Novgorod. Since 1932 all operations had been carried under the name [[Aeroflot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aeroflot.ru/us-en/about/history|title=Aeroflot History {{!}} Aeroflot|website=www.aeroflot.ru|language=en|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early European airlines tended to favor comfort – the passenger cabins were often spacious with luxurious interiors – over speed and efficiency. The relatively basic navigational capabilities of pilots at the time also meant that delays due to the weather were commonplace.

====Rationalization====
[[File:National Audit Office - Victoria - London - 020504.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|The [[Imperial Airways]] Empire Terminal, Victoria, London. Trains ran from here to [[flying boats]] in [[Southampton]], and to [[Croydon Airport]].]]
By the early 1920s, small airlines were struggling to compete, and there was a movement towards increased rationalization and consolidation. In 1924, [[Imperial Airways]] was formed from the merger of [[Instone Air Line|Instone Air Line Company]], [[British Marine Air Navigation Co Ltd|British Marine Air Navigation]], [[Daimler Airway]] and [[Handley Page Transport|Handley Page Transport Co Ltd.]], to allow British airlines to compete with stiff competition from French and German airlines that were enjoying heavy government subsidies. The airline was a pioneer in surveying and opening up air routes across the world to serve far-flung parts of the [[British Empire]] and to enhance trade and integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1923/1923%20-%200760.html |title = Imperial Air Transport Company: Appointment of Government Directors|work = Flight|date = December 20, 1923|page = 760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first new airliner ordered by Imperial Airways, was the [[Handley Page W8f]] ''City of Washington'', delivered on 3 November 1924.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation%20history/coming%20of%20age/imperial%20airways.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In the first year of operation the company carried 11,395 passengers and 212,380 letters. In April 1925, the film ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' became the first film to be screened for passengers on a scheduled airliner flight when it was shown on the London-Paris route.

Two French airlines also merged to form [[Air Union]] on 1 January 1923. This later merged with four other French airlines to become [[Air France]], the country's flagship carrier to this day, on 7 October 1933.

Germany's [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]] was created in 1926 by merger of two airlines, one of them [[Junkers Luftverkehr]]. Luft Hansa, due to the [[Hugo Junkers|Junkers]] heritage and unlike most other airlines at the time, became a major investor in airlines outside of Europe, providing capital to [[Varig]] and Avianca. German airliners built by [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]], [[Dornier GmbH|Dornier]], and [[Fokker]] were among the most advanced in the world at the time.

====Global expansion====
In 1926, [[Alan Cobham]] surveyed a flight route from the UK to [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], following this up with another proving flight to [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. Other routes to [[British India]] and the [[Far East]] were also charted and demonstrated at this time. Regular services to [[Cairo]] and [[Basra]] began in 1927 and were extended to [[Karachi]] in 1929. The London-[[Australia]] service was inaugurated in 1932 with the [[Handley Page HP 42]] airliners. Further services were opened up to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], [[Rangoon]], [[Singapore]], [[Brisbane]] and [[Hong Kong]] passengers departed London on 14 March 1936 following the establishment of a branch from Penang to Hong Kong.

[[File:Imperial routes April 1935.jpg|thumb|left|April 1935 map showing [[Imperial Airways]]' routes from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] to [[Australia]] and [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]]]] Imperial's aircraft were small, most seating fewer than twenty passengers, and catered for the rich. Only about 50,000 passengers used Imperial Airways in the 1930s. Most passengers on intercontinental routes or on services within and between British colonies were men doing colonial administration, business or research.&lt;ref&gt;Pirie, G.H. Incidental tourism: British imperial air travel in the 1930s. ''Journal of Tourism History'', 1 (2009) 49–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Imperial Airways, [[Air France]] and [[KLM]]'s early growth depended heavily on the needs to service links with far-flung colonial possessions ([[French North Africa|North Africa]] and [[French Indochina|Indochina]] for the French and the [[Dutch Indies|East Indies]] for the Dutch). France began an air mail service to [[Morocco]] in 1919 that was bought out in 1927, renamed [[Aéropostale (aviation)|Aéropostale]], and injected with capital to become a major international carrier. In 1933, Aéropostale went [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]], was nationalized and merged into [[Air France]].

Although Germany lacked colonies, it also began expanding its services globally. In 1931, the airship [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]] began offering regular scheduled passenger service between Germany and South America, usually every two weeks, which continued until 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airships.net/lz127-graf-zeppelin/history |title=LZ-127 Graf Zeppelin |publisher=Airships.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, the airship [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] entered passenger service and successfully crossed the Atlantic 36 times before crashing at Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airships.net/hindenburg |title=Hindenburg |publisher=Airships.net |date=2009-06-10 |accessdate=2010-08-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101005073820/http://www.airships.net/hindenburg| archivedate= 5 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From February 1934 until World War II began in 1939 [[Deutsche Luft Hansa|Deutsche Lufthansa]] operated an airmail service from [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]] via [[Spain]], the [[Canary Islands]] and West Africa to [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]] in [[Brazil]]. This was the first time an airline flew across an ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=pigDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1931+plane#v=onepage&amp;q=Popular%20Science%201931%20plane&amp;f=true |title=First Transatlantic Air Line Links Two Continents|date=February 1933 |journal=Popular Science|pages = 13-15 and 104|volume = 122|issue = 2|editor-last = Brown|editor-first = Raymond J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graue&amp;Duggan"&gt;James W.

By the end of the 1930s [[Aeroflot]] had become the world's largest airline, employing more than 4,000 pilots and 60,000 other service personnel and operating around 3,000 aircraft (of which 75% were considered obsolete by its own standards). During the Soviet era Aeroflot was synonymous with Russian civil aviation, as it was the only air carrier. It became the first airline in the world to operate sustained regular jet services on 15 September 1956 with the [[Tupolev Tu-104]].

====EU airline deregulation====
Deregulation of the [[European Union]] airspace in the early 1990s has had substantial effect on the structure of the industry there. The shift towards 'budget' airlines on shorter routes has been significant. Airlines such as [[EasyJet]] and [[Ryanair]] have often grown at the expense of the traditional national airlines.

There has also been a trend for these national airlines themselves to be privatized such as has occurred for [[Aer Lingus]] and [[British Airways]]. Other national airlines, including Italy's [[Alitalia]], have suffered – particularly with the rapid increase of oil prices in early 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/alitalia-future-hinges-on-rescue-package/a-1320328|title=Alitalia Future Hinges on Rescue Package {{!}} Business {{!}} DW {{!}} 07.09.2004|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. airline industry===
{{main article|Air transportation in the United States}}

====Early development====
[[File:TWA 1940.jpg|thumb|[[TWA]] [[Douglas DC-3]] in 1940. The DC-3, often regarded as one of the most influential aircraft in the history of commercial aviation, revolutionized air travel.]]

[[Tony Jannus]] conducted the United States' first scheduled commercial airline flight on 1 January 1914 for the [[St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line]].&lt;ref name=Society&gt;{{cite web | title=Tony Jannus, an enduring legacy of aviation | work=Tony Jannus Distinguished Aviation Society | publisher=tonyjannusaward.com | url=http://www.tonyjannusaward.com/history/ | date= | accessdate=2010-12-02 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717073628/http://www.tonyjannusaward.com/history/ | archivedate=2011-07-17 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 23-minute flight traveled between [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] and [[Tampa, Florida]], passing some {{convert|50|ft|m}} above Tampa Bay in Jannus' [[Benoist XIV]] wood and muslin biplane flying boat. His passenger was a former mayor of St. Petersburg, who paid $400 for the privilege of sitting on a wooden bench in the open cockpit. The Airboat line operated for about four months, carrying more than 1,200 passengers who paid $5 each.&lt;ref&gt;Carey, Susan, First airline offered no frills, many thrills, [[Wall Street Journal]], December 31, 2013, p. B4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chalk's International Airlines]] began service between Miami and Bimini in the [[Bahamas]] in February 1919. Based in [[Ft. Lauderdale]], Chalk's claimed to be the oldest continuously operating airline in the United States until its closure in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airportbusiness.com/web/online/Top-News-Headlines/CHALKS-AIRLINES-LOSES-FLIGHT-LICENSE-ITS-AIRPORT-LEASE-COULD-BE-CANCELED/1$15115 |title=Chalks Airlines Loses Flight License | publisher=airportbusiness.com|date= |accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[World War I]], the United States found itself swamped with aviators. Many decided to take their war-surplus aircraft on barnstorming campaigns, performing aerobatic maneuvers to woo crowds. In 1918, the [[United States Postal Service]] won the financial backing of [[United States Congress|Congress]] to begin experimenting with [[air mail]] service, initially using [[Curtiss Jenny]]&lt;ref&gt;Amick, George. "How The Airmail Got Off The Ground." American History 33.3 (1998): 48. Academic Search Premier. Web. 3 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; aircraft that had been procured by the [[United States Army Air Service]]. Private operators were the first to fly the mail but due to numerous accidents the US Army was tasked with mail delivery. During the Army's involvement they proved to be too unreliable and lost their air mail duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/airmail-service-it-began-with-army-air-service-pilots.htm|title=Airmail Service: It Began with Army Air Service Pilots {{!}} HistoryNet|website=www.historynet.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the mid-1920s, the [[United States Postal Service|Postal Service]] had developed its own air mail network, based on a transcontinental backbone between [[New York City]] and [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Anders (22 August 2014). "[https://disciplesofflight.com/big-arrow/ Now That's a Big Arrow]". Disciples of Flight. Retrieved 16 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; To supplement this service, they offered twelve contracts for spur routes to independent bidders. Some of the carriers that won these routes would, through time and mergers, evolve into [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Braniff Airways]], [[American Airlines]], [[United Airlines]] (originally a division of [[Boeing]]), [[Trans World Airlines]], [[Northwest Airlines]], and [[Eastern Air Lines]].

Service during the early 1920s was sporadic: most airlines at the time were focused on [[airmail#History|carrying bags of mail]]. In 1925, however, the [[Ford Motor Company]] bought out the [[William Bushnell Stout|Stout Aircraft Company]] and began construction of the all-metal [[Ford Trimotor]], which became the first successful American airliner. With a 12-passenger capacity, the Trimotor made passenger service potentially profitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = https://postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/current/airmail-in-america/the-airplanes/the-ford-trimotor.html | title = The Ford Trimotor and Douglas M-2 Mail Planes | work = Postal Museum | accessdate = July 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Air service was seen as a supplement to [[rail transport|rail]] service in the American transportation network.

At the same time, [[Juan Trippe]] began a crusade to create an air network that would link America to the world, and he achieved this goal through his airline, [[Pan American World Airways]], with a fleet of flying boats that linked [[Los Angeles]] to [[Shanghai]] and [[Boston]] to [[London]]. Pan Am and Northwest Airways (which began flights to Canada in the 1920s) were the only U.S. airlines to go international before the 1940s.

With the introduction of the [[Boeing 247]] and [[Douglas DC-3]] in the 1930s, the U.S. airline industry was generally profitable, even during the [[Great Depression]]. This trend continued until the beginning of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ASLAUrX3UE8C&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=boeing+247+profitable#v=onepage&amp;q=boeing%20247%20profitable&amp;f=false|title=A Companion to International History 1900–2001|last=Martel|first=Gordon|date=2008-04-15|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780470766293|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Development since 1945====
[[File:Boeing 377 Stratocruiser (B-29) American Overseas 1949-50.jpg|thumb|In October 1945, the [[American Export Airlines]] became the first airline to offer regular commercial flights between North America and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Commercial_Aviation/atlantic_route/Tran4.htm |title=Air Transportation: The Beginnings of Commercial Transatlantic Service |publisher=centennialofflight.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shown here is Am Ex [[Boeing 377]] ''Stratocruiser'' in 1949.]]

World War II, like World War I, brought new life to the airline industry. Many airlines in the Allied countries were flush from lease contracts to the military, and foresaw a future explosive demand for civil air transport, for both passengers and cargo. They were eager to invest in the newly emerging flagships of air travel such as the [[Boeing Stratocruiser]], [[Lockheed Constellation]], and [[Douglas DC-6]]. Most of these new aircraft were based on American bombers such as the [[B-29]], which had spearheaded research into new technologies such as [[pressurization]]. Most offered increased efficiency from both added speed and greater payload.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation%20history/airliners/2nd%20upload/timeline%2050s1.htm|title=history of airliners 1950 to 1959|website=www.century-of-flight.net|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jal.com/en/history/aircraft/60s/pick_61-70_01.html|title=History of JAL {{!}} DC-8-32|website=www.jal.com|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, the [[De Havilland Comet]], [[Boeing 707]], [[Douglas DC-8]], and [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] became the first flagships of the Jet Age in the West, while the Eastern bloc had [[Tupolev Tu-104]] and [[Tupolev Tu-124]] in the fleets of state-owned carriers such as Czechoslovak [[Czech Airlines|ČSA]], Soviet [[Aeroflot]] and East-German [[Interflug]]. The [[Vickers Viscount]] and [[Lockheed L-188 Electra]] inaugurated turboprop transport.

On 4 October 1958, [[BOAC]] started [[transatlantic flight]]s between [[London Heathrow]] and [[New York-Idlewild Airport|New York Idlewild]] with a Comet 4, and [[Pan Am]] followed on 26 October with a B707 service between New York and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-how-the-jet-travel-era-began-in-earnest-449222/ |title= How the jet travel era began in earnest – 60 years ago |date= 4 Oct 2018 |author= Max Kingsley Jones |work= Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next big boost for the airlines would come in the 1970s, when the [[Boeing 747]], [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], and [[Lockheed L-1011]] inaugurated [[widebody]] ("jumbo jet") service, which is still the standard in international travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/boeing-747-first-flight-47years-ago-2016-2|title=The Boeing 747 jumbo jet changed air travel with this momentous event 47 years ago|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tupolev Tu-144]] and its Western counterpart, [[Concorde]], made supersonic travel a reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/news/the-cold-war-race-to-build-the-concorde|title=The Cold War Race to Build the Concorde|work=HISTORY.com|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Concorde first flew in 1969 and operated through 2003. In 1972, [[Airbus]] began producing Europe's most commercially successful line of airliners to date. The added efficiencies for these aircraft were often not in speed, but in passenger capacity, payload, and range. Airbus also features modern electronic cockpits that were common across their aircraft to enable pilots to fly multiple models with minimal cross-training.

====US airline deregulation====

[[File:Pan Am Boeing 747 at Zurich Airport in May 1985.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pan Am]] [[Boeing 747]] ''Clipper Neptune's Car'' in 1985. The deregulation of the American airline industry increased the financial troubles of the airline which ultimately filed for bankruptcy in December 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Commercial_Aviation/Bankruptcy/Tran9.htm |title=Air Transportation: The Airline Bankruptcies of the 1980s |publisher=centennialofflight.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The 1978 U.S. [[Airline deregulation act|airline industry deregulation]] lowered federally controlled barriers for new airlines just as a downturn in the nation's economy occurred. New start-ups entered during the downturn, during which time they found aircraft and funding, contracted hangar and maintenance services, trained new employees, and recruited laid off staff from other airlines.

Major airlines dominated their routes through aggressive pricing and additional capacity offerings, often swamping new start-ups. In the place of high barriers to entry imposed by regulation, the major airlines implemented an equally high barrier called [[loss leader]] pricing.&lt;ref name="Andrew R. Thomas"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/current-affairs/9781430236771 |title=Mr. Soft Landing: Airline Industry Strategy, Service, and Safety|publisher=Apress |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this strategy an already established and dominant airline stomps out its competition by lowering airfares on specific routes, below the cost of operating on it, choking out any chance a start-up airline may have. The industry side effect is an overall drop in revenue and service quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asq.org/quality-report/10-year-analysis.html |website =American Society of Quality (ASQ)|title = The American Society for Quality Debuts Quarterly Quality Report with 10-Year Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since deregulation in 1978 the average domestic ticket price has dropped by 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/airlines/analysis/analysis_airline_industry.html |publisher =Massachusetts Institute of Technology|title = Airline Industry Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt; So has airline employee pay. By incurring massive losses, the airlines of the USA now rely upon a scourge of cyclical Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings to continue doing business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2011/12/blame_jimmy_carter_for_all_the_airline_bankruptcies_or_better_yet_thank_him_.html |title=Air Fail|publisher = Slate |work = Moneybox|date = 1 December 2011|last = Yglesias|first = Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[America West Airlines]] (which has since merged with US Airways) remained a significant survivor from this new entrant era, as dozens, even hundreds, have gone under.

In many ways, the biggest winner in the deregulated environment was the air passenger. Although not exclusively attributable to deregulation, indeed the U.S. witnessed an explosive growth in demand for air travel. Many millions who had never or rarely flown before became regular fliers, even joining [[frequent flyer]] loyalty programs and receiving free flights and other benefits from their flying. New services and higher frequencies meant that business fliers could fly to another city, do business, and return the same day, from almost any point in the country. Air travel's advantages put long distance intercity [[railroad]] travel and bus lines under pressure, with most of the latter having withered away, whilst the former is still protected under [[nationalization]] through the continuing existence of [[Amtrak]].

By the 1980s, almost half of the total flying in the world took place in the U.S., and today the domestic industry operates over 10,000 daily departures nationwide.

Toward the end of the century, a new style of [[low-cost carrier|low cost airline]] emerged, offering a no-frills product at a lower price. [[Southwest Airlines]], [[JetBlue]], [[AirTran Airways]], [[Skybus Airlines]] and other low-cost carriers began to represent a serious challenge to the so-called "legacy airlines", as did their low-cost counterparts in many other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/budget-airline-trends-2016/index.html|title=Budget airlines changed the world. What next?|date=2016-03-21|work=CNN Travel|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their commercial viability represented a serious competitive threat to the legacy carriers. However, of these, [[ATA Airlines|ATA]] and Skybus have since ceased operations.

Increasingly since 1978, US airlines have been reincorporated and [[off spin|spun off]] by newly created and internally led management companies, and thus becoming nothing more than operating units and subsidiaries with limited financially decisive control. Among some of these [[holding company|holding companies]] and [[parent company|parent companies]] which are relatively well known, are the [[UAL Corporation]], along with the [[AMR Corporation]], among a long [[list of airline holding companies]] sometime recognized worldwide. Less recognized are the [[private equity firm]]s which often seize managerial, financial, and [[board of directors]] control of distressed airline companies by temporarily investing large sums of [[Equity (finance)|capital]] in air carriers, to rescheme an airlines assets into a profitable organization or [[liquidate|liquidating]] an air carrier of their profitable and worthwhile routes and business operations.

Thus the last 50 years of the airline industry have varied from reasonably profitable, to devastatingly depressed. As the first major market to deregulate the industry in 1978, U.S. airlines have experienced more turbulence than almost any other country or region. In fact, no U.S. [[legacy carrier]] survived bankruptcy-free. Among the outspoken critics of deregulation, former CEO of American Airlines, [[Robert Crandall]] has publicly stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing shows airline industry deregulation was a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/45477274/AMR_Filing_Shows_Airline_Deregulation_Failed_Ex_CEO |title=Robert Cranall former CEO AA, CNBC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429202738/http://www.cnbc.com/id/45477274/AMR_Filing_Shows_Airline_Deregulation_Failed_Ex_CEO |archivedate=2013-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====The airline industry bailout====

Congress passed the [https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/2926 Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act] (P.L. 107-42) in response to a severe liquidity crisis facing the already-troubled airline industry in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11th terrorist attacks]]. Through the [[Air Transportation Stabilization Board|ATSB]] Congress sought to provide cash infusions to carriers for both the cost of the four-day federal shutdown of the airlines and the incremental losses incurred through December 31, 2001, as a result of the terrorist attacks. This resulted in the first government bailout of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ostpxweb.ost.dot.gov/aviation/Data/stabilizationact.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409061950/http://ostpxweb.ost.dot.gov/aviation/Data/stabilizationact.pdf |archivedate=2009-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2000 and 2005 US airlines lost $30 billion with wage cuts of over $15 billion and 100,000 employees laid off.&lt;ref name="Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. &amp; von Nordenflytch, A. 2009"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100965480|authors=Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. &amp; von Nordenflytch, A. |year=2009 |title=Up in the Air: How Airlines Can Improve Performance by Engaging their Employees|publisher=Cornell University Press, Ithaca |chapter=chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of the essential national economic role of a healthy aviation system, Congress authorized partial compensation of up to $5 billion in cash subject to review by the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] and up to $10 billion in loan guarantees subject to review by a newly created [[Air Transportation Stabilization Board]] (ATSB). The applications to DOT for reimbursements were subjected to rigorous multi-year reviews not only by DOT program personnel but also by the [[Government Accountability Office]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04725r.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the DOT Inspector General.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oig.dot.gov/StreamFile?file=/data/pdfdocs/aa20011024.pdf ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717225216/http://www.oig.dot.gov/StreamFile?file=%2Fdata%2Fpdfdocs%2Faa20011024.pdf |date=July 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oig.dot.gov/StreamFile?file=/data/pdfdocs/cr2003092.pdf ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717231319/http://www.oig.dot.gov/StreamFile?file=%2Fdata%2Fpdfdocs%2Fcr2003092.pdf |date=July 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the federal government provided $4.6 billion in one-time, subject-to-income-tax cash payments to 427 U.S. air carriers, with no provision for repayment, essentially a gift from the taxpayers. (Passenger carriers operating scheduled service received approximately $4 billion, subject to tax.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.gov/affairs/carrierpayments.htm |title=U |publisher=Dot.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527104415/http://www.dot.gov/affairs/carrierpayments.htm |archivedate=2010-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ATSB approved loan guarantees to six airlines totaling approximately $1.6 billion. Data from the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]] show that the government recouped the $1.6 billion and a profit of $339 million from the fees, interest and purchase of discounted airline stock associated with loan guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/atsb/ |title=Air Transportation Stabilization Board |publisher=Treas.gov |date=2001-09-22 |accessdate=2010-08-22|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080709052637/http://www.treas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/atsb/ |archivedate = July 9, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three largest [[major carrier]]s and [[Southwest Airlines]] control 70% of the U.S. passenger market.&lt;ref name=AvWeek14May2018/&gt;

Although [[Philippine Airlines]] (PAL) was officially founded on February 26, 1941, its license to operate as an airliner was derived from merged Philippine Aerial Taxi Company (PATCO) established by mining magnate Emmanuel N. Bachrach on December 3, 1930, making it Asia's oldest scheduled carrier still in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hawaii.gov/hawaiiaviation/hawaii-commercial-aviation/philippine-air-lines |title=Above the Pacific |first=William Joseph |last=Horvat |date=1966 |isbn=978-0-8168-0000-1 |publisher=Hawaii.gov |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial air service commenced three weeks later from [[Manila]] to [[Baguio]], making it Asia's first airline route. Bachrach's death in 1937 paved the way for its eventual merger with Philippine Airlines in March 1941 and made it Asia's oldest airline. It is also the oldest airline in Asia still operating under its current name.&lt;ref name="PAL"&gt;Jane, ''[http://www.janes.com Jane's airlines &amp; airliners By Jeremy Flack]'', First Edition, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-00-715174-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachrach's majority share in PATCO was bought by beer magnate Andres R. Soriano in 1939 upon the advice of General [[Douglas MacArthur]] and later merged with newly formed Philippine Airlines with PAL as the surviving entity. Soriano has controlling interest in both airlines before the merger. PAL restarted service on March 15, 1941, with a single [[Beech Model 18]] NPC-54 aircraft, which started its daily services between [[Manila]] (from [[Nielson Field]]) and [[Baguio]], later to expand with larger aircraft such as the DC-3 and Vickers Viscount.

[[Korean Air]] was one of the first airlines to be launched among the other Asian countries in 1946 along with [[Asiana Airlines]], which later joined in 1988. The license to operate as an airliner was granted by the federal government body after reviewing the necessity at the national assembly. The [[Hanjin]] occupies the largest ownership of Korean Air as well as few low-budget airlines as of now. The Korean Air is among the founders of [[Sky Team]], which was established in 2000. Asiana Airlines joined [[Star Alliance]] in 2003. Korean Air and Asiana Airlines comprise one of the largest combined airline miles and number of passenger served at the regional market of Asian airline industry

[[India]] was also one of the first countries to embrace civil aviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pran Nath Seth|author2=Pran Nath Seth, Sushma Seth Bhat|title=An Introduction To Travel And Tourism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AcGn-Fmc43sC&amp;pg=PA111|year=2003|publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt. Ltd|isbn=978-81-207-2482-2|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first Asian airline companies was [[Air India]], which was founded as [[Tata Airlines]] in 1932, a division of Tata Sons Ltd. (now [[Tata Group]]). The airline was founded by India's leading industrialist, [[JRD Tata]]. On October 15, 1932, J. R. D. Tata himself flew a single engined [[De Havilland Puss Moth]] carrying air mail (postal mail of [[Imperial Airways]]) from [[Karachi]] to [[Mumbai|Bombay]] via [[Ahmedabad]]. The aircraft continued to [[Madras]] via Bellary piloted by [[Royal Air Force]] pilot [[Nevill Vintcent]]. Tata Airlines was also one of the world's first major airlines which began its operations without any support from the Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S Bhatt|title=International Environmental Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s0g7tCYYu-gC&amp;pg=PA175|year=2007|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=978-81-313-0125-8|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the outbreak of World War II, the airline presence in Asia came to a relative halt, with many new flag carriers donating their aircraft for military aid and other uses. Following the end of the war in 1945, regular commercial service was restored in India and Tata Airlines became a public limited company on July 29, 1946, under the name Air India. After the [[independence of India]], 49% of the airline was acquired by the [[Government of India]]. In return, the airline was granted status to operate international services from India as the designated flag carrier under the name [[Air India International]].

On July 31, 1946, a chartered Philippine Airlines (PAL) [[DC-4]] ferried 40 American servicemen to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]], from Nielson Airport in [[Makati City]] with stops in [[Guam]], [[Wake Island]], [[Johnston Atoll]] and [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], making PAL the first Asian airline to cross the [[Pacific Ocean]]. A regular service between [[Manila]] and [[San Francisco]] was started in December. It was during this year that the airline was designated as the flag carrier of Philippines.

During the era of [[decolonization]], newly born Asian countries started to embrace air transport. Among the first Asian carriers during the era were [[Cathay Pacific]] of [[Hong Kong]] (founded in September 1946), [[Orient Airways]] (later [[Pakistan International Airlines]]; founded in October 1946), [[Air Ceylon]] (later [[SriLankan Airlines]]; founded in 1947), [[Malayan Airways Limited]] in 1947 (later [[Singapore Airlines|Singapore]] and [[Malaysia Airlines]]), [[El Al]] in [[Israel]] in 1948, [[Garuda Indonesia]] in 1949, [[Japan Airlines]] in 1951, [[Thai Airways International]] in 1960, and [[Korean National Airlines]] in 1947.

===Latin American and Caribbean airline industry===
[[File:Tam.a330-200.pt-mvl.arp.jpg|thumb|[[TAM Airlines]] is the largest airline in [[Latin America]] in terms of number of annual passengers flown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airtravel.about.com/od/basedincaribbeansa/tp/top10la.htm |title=Top 10 Airlines in Latin America By Arlene Fleming |publisher=Airtravel.about.com |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Among the first countries to have regular airlines in Latin America and the Caribbean were [[Bolivia]] with [[Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Bolivia/Transportation#ref312761|title=Bolivia - Transportation {{!}} history - geography|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cuba]] with [[Cubana de Aviación]], [[Colombia]] with [[Avianca]] (the first airline established in the Americas), Argentina with [[Aerolineas Argentinas]], [[Chile]] with [[LAN Chile]] (today [[LATAM Airlines]]), [[Brazil]] with [[Varig]], [[Dominican Republic]] with [[Dominicana de Aviación]], [[Mexico]] with [[Mexicana de Aviación]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] with [[BWIA West Indies Airways]] (today [[Caribbean Airlines]]), [[Venezuela]] with [[Aeropostal]], [[Puerto Rico]] with [[Aerovias nacionales de puerto rico|Puertorriquena]]; and [[Grupo TACA|TACA]] based in [[El Salvador]] and representing several airlines of [[Central America]] ([[Costa Rica]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]] and [[Nicaragua]]). All the previous airlines started regular operations well before [[World War II]]. Puerto Rican commercial airlines such as [[Prinair]], [[Oceanair]], [[Fina Air]] and [[Vieques Air Link]] came much after the second world war, as did several others from other countries like Mexico's [[Interjet]] and [[Volaris]], Venezuela's [[Aserca Airlines]] and others.

The air travel market has evolved rapidly over recent years in [[Latin America]]. Some industry estimates indicate that over 2,000 new aircraft will begin service over the next five years in this region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latin America needs more than 2,000 new passenger aircraft in next 20 years|url=http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/latin-america-needs-more-than-2000-new-passenger-aircraft-in-next-20-years/|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These airlines serve domestic flights within their countries, as well as connections within Latin America and also overseas flights to North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia.

Only two airlines - [[Avianca]] and [[LATAM Airlines]] - have international subsidiaries and cover many destinations within the Americas as well as major hubs in other continents. LATAM with [[Chile]] as the central operation along with [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]] and formerly with some operations in the [[Dominican Republic]]. The [[AviancaTaca Holding|AviancaTACA]] group has control of [[Avianca Brazil]], [[VIP Ecuador]] and a strategic alliance with [[AeroGal]].

==Regulatory considerations==

===National===
[[File:Garuda Indonesia Boeing 737-800 PER Koch-2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Garuda Indonesia]] [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-800]] parked at [[Perth International Airport]]. This Indonesian [[flag carrier]] is owned by the [[Politics of Indonesia|Indonesian Government]]]]

Many countries have [[Flag carrier|national airline]]s that the government owns and operates. Fully private airlines are subject to a great deal of government regulation for economic, political, and safety concerns. For instance, governments often intervene to halt airline labor actions to protect the free flow of people, communications, and goods between different regions without compromising safety.

The United States, Australia, and to a lesser extent Brazil, Mexico, India, the United Kingdom, and Japan have "deregulated" their airlines. In the past, these governments dictated airfares, route networks, and other operational requirements for each airline. Since deregulation, airlines have been largely free to negotiate their own operating arrangements with different airports, enter and exit routes easily, and to levy airfares and supply flights according to market demand.
[[File:Cyprus airways a330.jpg|thumb|[[Cyprus Airways]], the now defunct national airline of Cyprus]]
The entry barriers for new airlines are lower in a deregulated market, and so the U.S. has seen hundreds of airlines start up (sometimes for only a brief operating period). This has produced far greater competition than before deregulation in most markets. The added competition, together with pricing freedom, means that new entrants often take market share with highly reduced rates that, to a limited degree, full service airlines must match. This is a major constraint on profitability for established carriers, which tend to have a higher cost base.

As a result, profitability in a deregulated market is uneven for most airlines. These forces have caused some major airlines to go out of business, in addition to most of the poorly established new entrants.

In the United States, the airline industry is dominated by four large firms. Because of industry consolidation, after fuel prices dropped considerably in 2015, very little of the savings were passed on to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;"Too Much of a Good Thing." ''The Economist'' 26 March 2016: 23. print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International===
[[File:SIA Airbus A380, 9V-SKA, SIN 8.jpg|thumb|[[Singapore Airlines]] [[Airbus A380]] landing at [[Singapore Changi Airport|Changi Airport]]. Singapore Airlines is the first international airline to operate the A380, the world's largest passenger airliner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singaporeair.com/mediacentre/pacontent/news/NE_1608.jsp Singapore Airlines - News Releases] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620235612/http://www.singaporeair.com/mediacentre/pacontent/news/NE_1608.jsp |date=2008-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Groups such as the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] establish worldwide standards for safety and other vital concerns. Most international air traffic is regulated by bilateral agreements between countries, which designate specific carriers to operate on specific routes. The model of such an agreement was the [[Bermuda Agreement]] between the US and UK following World War II, which designated airports to be used for transatlantic flights and gave each government the authority to nominate carriers to operate routes.

Bilateral agreements are based on the "[[freedoms of the air]]", a group of generalized traffic rights ranging from the freedom to overfly a country to the freedom to provide domestic flights within a country (a very rarely granted right known as [[cabotage]]). Most agreements permit airlines to fly from their home country to designated airports in the other country: some also extend the freedom to provide continuing service to a third country, or to another destination in the other country while carrying passengers from overseas.

In the 1990s, "[[open skies]]" agreements became more common. These agreements take many of these regulatory powers from state governments and open up international routes to further competition. Open skies agreements have met some criticism, particularly within the European Union, whose airlines would be at a comparative disadvantage with the United States' because of [[cabotage]] restrictions.

==Economic considerations==

In 2017, 4.1 billion passengers have been carried by airlines in 41.9 million commercial scheduled flights (an average payload of {{#expr:4100/41.9round0}} passengers), for 7.75 trillion [[passenger kilometre]]s (an average trip of {{#expr:7750/4.100round0}} km) over 45,091 airline routes served globally.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=ATAGOct2018&gt;--&gt;
In 2016, air transport generated $704.4 billion of revenue in 2016, employed 10.2 million workers, supported 65.5 million jobs and $2.7 trillion of economic activity: 3.6% of the global [[GDP]].&lt;ref name=ATAGOct2018&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.aviationbenefits.org/media/166344/abbb18_full-report_web.pdf |publisher= Air Transport Action Group |title= Aviation: Benefits Beyond Borders |date= October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, the total weekly airline capacity was 181.1 billion [[Available Seat Kilometers]] (+6.9% compared to July 2015): 57.6bn in Asia-Pacific, 47.7bn in Europe, 46.2bn in North America, 12.2bn in Middle East, 12.0bn in Latin America and 5.4bn in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://html5.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/desktop/stage/default.aspx?pnum=78&amp;edid=e030c749-44c6-4ab0-af51-84e8f4424689 |title= Capacity snapshot |work= Airline Business |date= July–August 2016 |publisher= Flight Global |page= 78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
[[File:Tran12G7.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Juan Trippe]], the founder of [[Pan American World Airways]], surveying his globe]]

Historically, air travel has survived largely through state support, whether in the form of equity or subsidies. The airline industry as a whole has made a cumulative loss during its 100-year history, once the costs include subsidies for aircraft development and airport construction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/airlines/story/0,,1715861,00.html Wings of Desire], Guardian, Thursday February 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnkay.com/2005/09/27/airlines-and-the-canine-features-of-unprofitable-industries/ Airlines and the canine features of unprofitable industries], Financial Times, September 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

One argument is that [[positive externalities]], such as higher growth due to global mobility, outweigh the microeconomic losses and justify continuing government intervention. A historically high level of government intervention in the airline industry can be seen as part of a wider political consensus on strategic forms of transport, such as [[highway]]s and [[Rail transport|railways]], both of which receive public funding in most parts of the world. Although many countries continue to operate state-owned or parastatal airlines, many large airlines today are privately owned and are therefore governed by microeconomic principles to maximize shareholder profit.

In December 1991, the collapse of Pan Am, an airline often credited for shaping the international airline industry, highlighted the financial complexities faced by major airline companies.

Following the [[Airline Deregulation Act|1978 deregulation]], U.S. carriers did not manage to make an aggregate [[economic profit|profit]] for 12 years in 31, including four years where combined [[economic loss|losses]] amounted to $10 billion, but rebounded with eight consecutive years of profits since 2010, including its four with over $10 billion profits.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek14May2018/&gt;--&gt;

=== Largest airlines ===
The [[world's largest airlines]] can be defined in several ways. [[American Airlines Group]] is the largest by its fleet size, [[revenue]], [[profit (accounting)|profit]], [[passenger]]s carried and [[revenue passenger mile]]. [[Delta Air Lines]] is the largest by [[asset]]s value and [[market capitalization]]. [[Lufthansa Group]] is the largest by number of [[employee]]s, [[FedEx Express]] by freight [[tonne-kilometer]]s, [[Ryanair]] by number of international passengers carried and [[Turkish Airlines]] by number of countries served.

===Ticket revenue===

Airlines assign prices to their services in an attempt to maximize profitability. The pricing of airline tickets has become increasingly complicated over the years and is now largely determined by computerized [[yield management]] systems.

Because of the complications in scheduling flights and maintaining profitability, airlines have many loopholes that can be used by the knowledgeable traveler. Many of these airfare secrets are becoming more and more known to the general public, so airlines are forced to make constant adjustments.

Most airlines use differentiated pricing, a form of [[price discrimination]], to sell air services at varying prices simultaneously to different segments. Factors influencing the price include the days remaining until departure, the booked load factor, the forecast of total demand by price point, competitive pricing in force, and variations by day of week of departure and by time of day. Carriers often accomplish this by dividing each cabin of the aircraft (first, business and economy) into a number of [[travel class]]es for pricing purposes.

A complicating factor is that of origin-destination control ("O&amp;D control"). Someone purchasing a ticket from Melbourne to Sydney (as an example) for A$200 is competing with someone else who wants to fly Melbourne to Los Angeles through Sydney on the same flight, and who is willing to pay A$1400. Should the airline prefer the $1400 passenger, or the $200 passenger plus a possible Sydney-Los Angeles passenger willing to pay $1300? Airlines have to make hundreds of thousands of similar pricing decisions daily.
[[File:Flughafen Frankfurt am Main.JPG|thumb|[[Lufthansa]] [[Boeing 747-400]]. Lufthansa is the [[flag carrier]] airline of [[Germany]].]]

The advent of advanced computerized reservations systems in the late 1970s, most notably [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], allowed airlines to easily perform [[cost-benefit analysis|cost-benefit analyses]] on different pricing structures, leading to almost perfect price discrimination in some cases (that is, filling each seat on an aircraft at the highest price that can be charged without driving the consumer elsewhere).

The intense nature of airfare pricing has led to the term "[[fare war]]" to describe efforts by airlines to undercut other airlines on competitive routes. Through computers, new airfares can be published quickly and efficiently to the airlines' sales channels. For this purpose the airlines use the [[Airline Tariff Publishing Company]] (ATPCO), who distribute latest fares for more than 500 airlines to [[Computer Reservation System]]s across the world.

The extent of these pricing phenomena is strongest in "legacy" carriers. In contrast, low fare carriers usually offer pre-announced and simplified price structure, and sometimes quote prices for each leg of a trip separately.

Computers also allow airlines to predict, with some accuracy, how many passengers will actually fly after making a reservation to fly. This allows airlines to overbook their flights enough to fill the aircraft while accounting for "no-shows", but not enough (in most cases) to force paying passengers off the aircraft for lack of seats, stimulative pricing for low demand flights coupled with [[overbooking]] on high demand flights can help reduce this figure. This is especially crucial during tough economic times as airlines undertake massive cuts to ticket prices to retain demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cheapflights.co.uk/flights/2009/05/recession-prompts-surge-in-cheap-flights.html |title=Recession 'prompts surge in cheap flights' |publisher=News.cheapflights.co.uk |date=2009-05-13 |accessdate=2010-08-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130120521/http://news.cheapflights.co.uk/flights/2009/05/recession-prompts-surge-in-cheap-flights.html |archive-date=2009-11-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over January/February 2018, the cheapest airline surveyed by price comparator [[rome2rio]] was [[Tigerair Australia]] with $0.06/km followed by [[AirAsia X]] with $0.07/km, while the most expensive was [[Charterlines, Inc.]] with $1.26/km followed by [[Buddha Air]] with $1.18/km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.rome2rio.com/labs/2018-global-flight-price-ranking/ |title= 2018 Global Flight Price Ranking: What’s the world’s cheapest airline? |publisher= [[rome2rio]] |date= April 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[IATA]], the global airline industry [[revenue]] was $754 billion in 2017 for a $38.4 billion collective [[Profit (accounting)|profit]], and should rise by 10.7% to $834 billion in 2018 for a $33.8 billion profit forecast, down by 12% due to rising [[jet fuel]] and [[Workforce|labor]] costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/airlines-formula-protecting-profits-higher-fares |title= Airlines’ Formula For Protecting Profits: Higher Fares |date= Jun 12, 2018 |author= Jens Flottau, Adrian Schofield and Aaron Karp |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Elasticity ====

The demand for air transport will be less [[Elasticity (economics)|elastic]] for [[flight length|longer flights]] than for shorter flights, and more elastic for leisure travel than for [[business travel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.fin.gc.ca/consultresp/Airtravel/airtravStdy_-eng.asp |title= Air Travel Demand Elasticities: Concepts, Issues and Measurement |author= David W.

===Operating costs===
[[File:virgin atlantic a340-600 g-vyou arp.jpg|thumb|An [[Airbus A340]]-600 of [[Virgin Atlantic Airways]]. In October 2008, Virgin Atlantic offered to combine its operations with [[BMI (airline)|BMI]] in an effort to reduce operating costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/transport/article5037731.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Virgin proposes tieup with BMI and Lufthansa | date=October 29, 2008 | accessdate=April 23, 2010 | first=David | last=Robertson}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Full-service airlines have a high level of fixed and operating costs to establish and maintain air services: labor, fuel, airplanes, engines, spares and parts, IT services and networks, airport equipment, airport handling services, sales distribution, catering, training, [[aviation insurance]] and other costs. Thus all but a small percentage of the income from ticket sales is paid out to a wide variety of external providers or internal cost centers.

Moreover, the industry is structured so that airlines often act as tax collectors. Airline fuel is untaxed because of a series of treaties existing between countries. Ticket prices include a number of fees, taxes and surcharges beyond the control of airlines. Airlines are also responsible for enforcing government regulations. If airlines carry passengers without proper documentation on an international flight, they are responsible for returning them back to the original country.

Analysis of the 1992–1996 period shows that every player in the air transport chain is far more profitable than the airlines, who collect and pass through fees and revenues to them from ticket sales. While airlines as a whole earned 6% return on capital employed (2–3.5% less than the cost of capital), airports earned 10%, catering companies 10–13%, handling companies 11–14%, aircraft lessors 15%, aircraft manufacturers 16%, and global distribution companies more than 30%. (Source: Spinetta, 2000, quoted in Doganis, 2002)

The widespread entrance of a new breed of [[low cost airline]]s beginning at the turn of the century has accelerated the demand that full service carriers control costs. Many of these low-cost companies emulate [[Southwest Airlines]] in various respects, and like Southwest, they can eke out a consistent profit throughout all phases of the business cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dallasnews.com/business/airlines/2015/10/08/the-southwest-effect-is-alive-and-well-airline-executives-say|title=The Southwest effect is|date=2015-10-08|work=Dallas News|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, a [[shakeout]] of airlines is occurring in the U.S. and elsewhere. [[American Airlines]], [[United Airlines]], [[Continental Airlines]] (twice), [[US Airways]] (twice), [[Delta Air Lines]], and [[Northwest Airlines]] have all declared [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy.

Where an airline has established an engineering base at an airport, then there may be considerable economic advantages in using that same airport as a preferred focus (or "hub") for its scheduled flights.

Operating costs for US [[major airline]]s are primarily aircraft [[operating expense]] including [[jet fuel]], [[aircraft maintenance]], [[depreciation]] and [[aircrew]] for 44%, servicing expense for 29% (traffic 11%, passenger 11% and aircraft 7%), 14% for reservations and sales and 13% for [[overheads]] (administration 6% and advertising 2%).&lt;!--&lt;ref name=ICAO20feb2017/&gt;--&gt;
An average US major [[Boeing 757]]-200 flies {{cvt|1252|mile|km}} stages 11.3 block hours per day and costs $2,550 per block hour : $923 of ownership, $590 of maintenance, $548 of fuel and $489 of crew; or $13.34 per 186 seats per block hour.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=ICAO20feb2017/&gt;--&gt;
For a [[Boeing 737-500]], a low-cost carrier like Southwest have lower operating costs at $1,526 than a full service one like United at $2,974, and higher [[productivity]] with 399,746 [[available seat miles|ASM]] per day against 264,284, resulting in a unit cost of {{#expr:152600/399746round2}} $cts/ASM against {{#expr:297400/264284round2}} $cts/ASM.&lt;ref name=ICAO20feb2017&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.icao.int/MID/Documents/2017/Aviation%20Data%20and%20Analysis%20Seminar/PPT3%20-%20Airlines%20Operating%20costs%20and%20productivity.pdf |title= Airline Operating Costs and Productivity |date= 20 February 2017 |publisher= ICAO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assets and financing===
[[File:Maslounge.jpg|thumb|The 'Golden Lounge' of [[Malaysia Airlines]] at [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]] (KLIA). The airline has ownership of special slots at KLIA, giving it a competitive edge over other airlines operating at the airport.]]
Airline financing is quite complex, since airlines are highly leveraged operations. Not only must they purchase (or lease) new airliner bodies and engines regularly, they must make major long-term fleet decisions with the goal of meeting the demands of their markets while producing a fleet that is relatively economical to operate and maintain; comparably Southwest Airlines and their reliance on a single airplane type (the [[Boeing 737]] and derivatives), with the now defunct [[Eastern Air Lines]] which operated 17 different aircraft types, each with varying pilot, engine, maintenance, and support needs.

A second financial issue is that of [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[fuel]] purchases, which are usually second only to [[Labour (economics)|labor]] in its relative cost to the company. However, with the current high fuel prices it has become the largest cost to an airline. Legacy airlines, compared with new entrants, have been hit harder by rising fuel prices partly due to the running of older, less fuel efficient aircraft.&lt;ref name="Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. &amp; von Nordenflytch, A. 2009"/&gt; While hedging instruments can be expensive, they can easily pay for themselves many times over in periods of increasing fuel costs, such as in the 2000–2005 period.

In view of the congestion apparent at many international [[airport]]s, the ownership of slots at certain airports (the right to take-off or land an aircraft at a particular time of day or night) has become a significant tradable asset for many airlines. Clearly take-off slots at popular times of the day can be critical in attracting the more profitable business traveler to a given airline's flight and in establishing a competitive advantage against a competing airline.

If a particular city has two or more airports, market forces will tend to attract the less profitable routes, or those on which competition is weakest, to the less congested airport, where slots are likely to be more available and therefore cheaper. For example, [[Reagan National Airport]] attracts profitable routes due partly to its congestion, leaving less-profitable routes to [[Baltimore-Washington International Airport]] and [[Dulles International Airport]].

Other factors, such as surface transport facilities and onward connections, will also affect the relative appeal of different airports and some long distance flights may need to operate from the one with the longest runway. For example, [[LaGuardia Airport]] is the preferred airport for most of [[Manhattan]] due to its proximity, while long-distance routes must use [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]'s longer runways.

===Airline partnerships===
[[File:largest airline alliances.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Home countries of airlines in the largest airline alliances: Star Alliance (grey), SkyTeam (blue) and Oneworld (purple). IATA codes of founders are outlined in red.]]
[[File:JA8941-oneworld-01.jpg|thumb|A [[Japan Airlines]] Boeing 777-300 with special [[Oneworld]] livery. Oneworld is the third largest airline alliance after [[Star Alliance]] and [[SkyTeam]].]]

[[Codeshare agreement|Codesharing]] is the most common type of airline partnership; it involves one airline selling tickets for another airline's flights under its own airline code. An early example of this was Japan Airlines' (JAL) codesharing partnership with Aeroflot in the 1960s on [[Tokyo]]–[[Moscow]] flights; Aeroflot operated the flights using Aeroflot aircraft, but JAL sold tickets for the flights as if they were JAL flights. This practice allows airlines to expand their operations, at least on paper, into parts of the world where they cannot afford to establish bases or purchase aircraft. Another example was the [[Austrian Airlines|Austrian]]–[[Sabena]] partnership on the [[Vienna]]–[[Brussels]]–[[New York City|New York]]/JFK route during the late '60s, using a Sabena [[Boeing 707]] with Austrian [[Aircraft livery|livery]].

Since airline reservation requests are often made by city-pair (such as "show me flights from Chicago to Düsseldorf"), an airline that can codeshare with another airline for a variety of routes might be able to be listed as indeed offering a Chicago–[[Düsseldorf]] flight. The passenger is advised however, that airline no. 1 operates the flight from say Chicago to Amsterdam, and airline no. 2 operates the continuing flight (on a different airplane, sometimes from another terminal) to Düsseldorf. Thus the primary rationale for code sharing is to expand one's service offerings in city-pair terms to increase sales.

A more recent development is the [[airline alliance]], which became prevalent in the late 1990s. These alliances can act as virtual mergers to get around government restrictions. Alliances of airlines such as [[Star Alliance]], [[Oneworld]], and [[SkyTeam]] coordinate their passenger service programs (such as [[Airport lounge|lounges]] and [[frequent-flyer program]]s), offer special [[Interlining|interline]] tickets, and often engage in extensive [[Codeshare agreement|codesharing]] (sometimes systemwide). These are increasingly integrated business combinations—sometimes including cross-equity arrangements—in which products, service standards, schedules, and airport facilities are standardized and combined for higher efficiency. One of the first airlines to start an alliance with another airline was [[KLM]], who partnered with [[Northwest Airlines]]. Both airlines later entered the SkyTeam alliance after the [[Air France-KLM|fusion of KLM and Air France]] in 2004.

Often the companies combine [[Information technology|IT]] operations, or purchase fuel and aircraft as a bloc to achieve higher bargaining power. However, the alliances have been most successful at purchasing invisible supplies and services, such as fuel. Airlines usually prefer to purchase items visible to their passengers to differentiate themselves from local competitors. If an airline's main domestic competitor flies Boeing airliners, then the airline may prefer to use Airbus aircraft regardless of what the rest of the alliance chooses.

===Fuel hedging===
{{Main article|Fuel Hedging}}Fuel hedging is a [[contractual]] tool used by transportation companies like airlines to reduce their exposure to volatile and potentially rising fuel costs. Several low-cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines adopt this practice.&lt;ref name = economist&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2015/01/fuel-hedging-and-airlines|title=Gambles that haven't paid off|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date= | language =en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Southwest is credited with maintaining strong business profits between 1999 and the early 2000s due to its fuel hedging policy. Many other airlines are replicating Southwest's hedging policy to control their fuel costs.&lt;ref name = economist/&gt;

=== Seasonality ===
Airlines often have a strong [[seasonality]], with traffic low in [[Winter]] and peaking in [[Summer]]. In Europe the most extreme market are the [[Greek islands]] with July/August having more than ten times the winter traffic, as [[Jet2]] is the most seasonal among [[low-cost carrier]]s with July having seven times the January traffic, whereas [[legacy carrier]]s are much less with only 85/115% variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.anna.aero/2017/03/01/greek-islands-jet2-com-seasonality-losers-europe/ |title= Seasonality: Jet2.com and Greek Islands most extreme in anna.aero leisure-legacy comparison |work= Airline Network News and Analysis |date= 1 Mar 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impacts==
{{Main article|Environmental impact of aviation}}
[[File:Contrails southeast lrg.png|thumb|[[Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer|MODIS]] tracking of [[contrail]]s generated by air traffic over the southeastern United States on January 29, 2004.]]

Aircraft engines emit [[noise pollution]], gases and particulate emissions, and contribute to [[global dimming]].&lt;ref name=contrails&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contrails reduce daily temperature range |first=David J. |last=Travis |author2=Carleton, Andrew M. |author3=Lauritsen, Ryan G |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |page=601 |volume=418 |year=2002 |url=http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf |doi=10.1038/418601a |format=PDF |pmid=12167846 |issue=6898 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503192714/http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf |archivedate=2006-05-03 |df= |bibcode=2002Natur.418..601T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growth of the industry in recent years raised a number of ecological questions.

Domestic air transport grew in China at 15.5 percent annually from 2001 to 2006. The rate of air travel globally increased at 3.7 percent per year over the same time. In the EU [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from aviation increased by 87% between 1990 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Climate change: Commission proposes bringing air transport into EU Emissions Trading Scheme |publisher=EU press release |date=2006-12-20 |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/06/1862 |accessdate=2008-01-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112155545/http://www.europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP%2F06%2F1862 |archivedate=12 January 2008 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; However it must be compared with the flights increase, only in UK, between 1990 and 2006 terminal passengers increased from 100 000 thousands to 250 000 thousands.,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN03760.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; according to AEA reports every year, 750 million passengers travel by European airlines, which also share 40% of merchandise value in and out of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aea.be/about/airtransportineurope/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724203254/http://www.aea.be/about/airtransportineurope/index.html |archivedate=2013-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without even pressure from "green activists", targeting lower ticket prices, generally, airlines do what is possible to cut the fuel consumption (and gas emissions connected therewith). Further, according to some reports, it can be concluded that the last piston-powered aircraft were as fuel-efficient as the average jet in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transportenvironment.org/sites/default/files//docs/Publications/2005pubs/2005-12_nlr_aviation_fuel_efficiency.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite continuing efficiency improvements from the major aircraft manufacturers, the expanding demand for global air travel has resulted in growing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Currently, the aviation sector, including US domestic and global international travel, make approximately 1.6 percent of global anthropogenic GHG emissions per annum. North America accounts for nearly 40 percent of the world's GHG emissions from aviation fuel use.&lt;ref&gt;David McCollum, Gregory Gould, and David Greene. Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Aviation and Marine Transportation: Mitigation Potential and Policies, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

CO2 emissions from the [[jet fuel]] burned per passenger on an average {{convert|3200|km|mi|sp=us}} airline flight is about 353 kilograms (776&amp;nbsp;pounds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=carbon-footprint-calculator |url=http://www.terrapass.com/carbon-footprint-calculator/methodology-popup.html |publisher=TerraPass.com |accessdate=Feb 19, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131210919/http://www.terrapass.com/carbon-footprint-calculator/methodology-popup.html |archivedate=2009-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loss of natural habitat potential associated with the jet fuel burned per passenger on a {{convert|3200|km|mi|sp=us}} airline flight is estimated to be 250 square meters (2700 square feet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=environmental impact of airline flights|url=http://xoearth.org/ecofx-airline-flights/|publisher=ecofx.org|accessdate=Apr 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of climate change and [[peak oil]], there is a debate about possible [[taxation]] of air travel and the inclusion of aviation in an [[emissions trading]] scheme, with a view to ensuring that the total [[external costs]] of aviation are taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/trading/eu/pdf/including-aviation-icf.pdf Including Aviation into the EU ETS: Impact on EU allowance prices] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215004933/http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/trading/eu/pdf/including-aviation-icf.pdf |date=February 15, 2006 }} ICF Consulting for DEFRA February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The airline industry is responsible for about 11 percent of [[greenhouse gas]]es emitted by the U.S. transportation sector. [[Boeing]] estimates that [[biofuel]]s could reduce flight-related greenhouse-gas emissions by 60 to 80 percent. The solution would be blending algae fuels with existing jet fuel:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/03/AR2008010303907.html | work=The Washington Post | title=A Promising Oil Alternative: Algae Energy | date=January 6, 2008 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Boeing and [[Air New Zealand]] are collaborating with leading Brazilian biofuel maker [[Tecbio]], [[New Zealand]]'s [[Aquaflow Bionomic]] and other jet biofuel developers around the world.
* [[Virgin Atlantic]] and [[Virgin Green Fund]] are looking into the technology as part of a biofuel initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ángel González |url=http://old.seattletimes.com/html/boeingaerospace/2003858756_boeingenergy30.html |title=To go green in jet fuel, Boeing looks at algae|work = Seattle Times Newspaper |date=2007-08-30 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[KLM]] has made the first commercial flight with biofuel in 2009.

There are projects on [[electric aircraft]], and some of them are fully operational as of 2013.

==Call signs==

Each operator of a scheduled or charter flight uses an [[Airline codes|airline call sign]] when communicating with airports or air traffic control centres. Most of these call-signs are derived from the airline's trade name, but for reasons of history, marketing, or the need to reduce ambiguity in spoken English (so that pilots do not mistakenly make navigational decisions based on instructions issued to a different aircraft), some airlines and air forces use call-signs less obviously connected with their trading name. For example, British Airways uses a ''Speedbird'' call-sign, named after the logo of its predecessor, [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]], while [[SkyEurope]] used ''Relax''.

==Airline personnel==
[[File:Air Bishkek A320-200 EX-32002 DME Dec 2012.png|thumb|[[Air Bishkek]] [[Airbus A320]] landing at [[Domodedovo Airport]] (2012)]]
The various types of airline personnel include:
Flight operations personnel including flight safety personnel.
* [[Flight crew]], responsible for the operation of the aircraft. Flight crew members include:
** [[Aviator|Pilots]] ([[Pilot in command|Captain]] and [[First officer (civil aviation)|First Officer]]: some older aircraft also required a [[Flight Engineer]] and/or a [[Navigator]])
** [[Flight attendant]]s (led by a [[purser]] on larger aircraft)
** [[Sky marshal|In-flight security personnel]] on some airlines (most notably [[El Al]])
* [[Groundcrew]], responsible for operations at airports. Ground crew members include:
** Aerospace and avionics engineers responsible for certifying the aircraft for flight and management of aircraft maintenance
*** [[Aerospace]] engineers, responsible for airframe, powerplant and electrical systems maintenance
***[[File:Malaysia Airlines Airbus A380 (9M-MNA) departs London Heathrow Airport 2ndJuly2014 arp.jpg|thumb|[[Malaysia Airlines]] [[Airbus]] [[A380-800]] departs [[Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow Airport]], [[England, Scotland and Wales|England]].]][[Avionics]] engineers responsible for avionics and instruments maintenance

** [[Flight dispatcher]]s
** [[Baggage handler]]s
** Ramp Agents
** Remote centralised weight and balancing&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalloadcontrol.com&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Gate agent]]s
** Ticket agents
** Passenger service agents (such as [[airline lounge]] employees)
** Reservation agents, usually (but not always) at facilities outside the airport.
** Crew schedulers
** 
Airlines follow a [[corporation|corporate]] structure where each broad area of operations (such as maintenance, flight operations (including flight safety), and passenger service) is supervised by a vice president. Larger airlines often appoint vice presidents to oversee each of the airline's hubs as well. Airlines employ [[lawyers]] to deal with regulatory procedures and other administrative tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hklaw.com/practices/aviation-regulation/|title=Aviation Regulation|website=www.hklaw.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry trends==
[[File:World-airline-routemap-2009.png|thumb|Map of scheduled airline traffic in 2009]]

The pattern of ownership has been privatized in the recent years, that is, the ownership has gradually changed from governments to private and individual sectors or organizations. This occurs as regulators permit greater freedom and non-government ownership, in steps that are usually decades apart. This pattern is not seen for all airlines in all regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Government-owned and Privatized Airlines (unofficial preliminary compilation) |publisher = [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] |url = https://www.icao.int/sustainability/Documents/PrivatizedAirlines.pdf|date = 4 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growth rates are not consistent in all regions, but countries with a de-regulated airline industry have more competition and greater pricing freedom. This results in lower fares and sometimes dramatic spurts in traffic growth. The U.S., Australia, Canada, [[Japan]], [[Brazil]], [[India]] and other markets exhibit this trend. The industry has been observed to be cyclical in its financial performance. Four or five years of poor earnings precede five or six years of improvement. But profitability even in the good years is generally low, in the range of 2–3% net profit after interest and tax. In times of profit, airlines lease new generations of airplanes and upgrade services in response to higher demand. Since 1980, the industry has not earned back the cost of capital during the best of times. Conversely, in bad times losses can be dramatically worse. [[Warren Buffett]] in 1999 said "the money that had been made since the dawn of aviation by all of this country's airline companies was zero. Absolutely zero."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiancapitalist.com/buffetts-spot-on-advice/ |title=Buffett’s spot-on advice |publisher=Money Sense |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in many mature industries, consolidation is a trend. Airline groupings may consist of limited bilateral partnerships, long-term, multi-faceted alliances between carriers, equity arrangements, [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers]], or [[takeover]]s. Since governments often restrict ownership and merger between companies in different countries, most consolidation takes place within a country. In the U.S., over 200 airlines have merged, been taken over, or gone out of business since deregulation in 1978. Many international airline managers are lobbying their governments to permit greater consolidation to achieve higher economy and efficiency.

'''Alejandro Ponce''' (born May 3, 1970, [[Arequipa]]) is a Peruvian economist, seasoned global investor, and recognized Latin-American serial entrepreneur. He is one of the founders of [[Nexus Group]] (founded 1998), the largest Peruvian private equity firm with total commitments of about 1 billion.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gestion.pe/tendencias/hombres-detras-deals-mas-importantes-2012-2056800|title=Los hombres detrás de los 'deals' más importantes del 2012|date=17 January 2013|work=Gestion|accessdate=15 January 2016|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elcomercio.pe/economia/negocios/nexus-group-negocia-compra-colombiana-flexo-spring-noticia-1742804|title=Nexus Group negocia compra de la colombiana Flexo Spring|date=15 January 2016|work=El Comercio|accessdate=15 January 2016|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 17 years, Alejandro acted as Managing Partner, and was responsible for creating and sourcing new ventures and investment opportunities, as well as strategic monitoring of the portfolio companies. In 2015 Alejandro decided to leave [[Nexus Group]], expanding his investment scope, and founding ToN Ventures, an angel investment fund with 25 minority stake investments in innovative technology ventures, mainly based in Israel and the Silicon Valley.

In 2016, after attending [[Singularity University]]’s Global Solutions Program, Alejandro founded 01Labs and 01Ventures. 01Labs is a venture builder, to launch in Latin American companies that leverage the rise of exponential technologies and incorporate human-centered design. 01Ventures is an early stage fund that offers Latin American investors and corporations access to technology startups in Israel and Silicon Valley. 01Ventures co-invests alongside top venture capital firms and accelerators, eager to offer their portfolio companies access to the Latin American market.

His areas of expertise and experience lie within startups, turnaround and growth investment, and back in 2013 he was also named one of the Top 50 most influential people in Latin American private equity by Private Equity World.&lt;ref name="CADE Executives 2012"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ejecutivo.cade-ipae.pe/comite-organizador/alejandro-ponce/|title=CADE Ejecutivos 2012  » Alejandro Ponce|website=ejecutivo.cade-ipae.pe|language=Spanish|accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important companies he has founded includes Nexus Group, Cineplanet, Casa Andina, Innova Schools, Oechsle, Promart, and ToN Ventures, the newest and most important in the future being 01_Labs and 01_Ventures.

== Early life and education ==

Alejandro Ponce graduated with Honors from [[University of the Pacific (Peru)|Universidad del Pacifico]] in [[Lima, Peru]]. Universidad Del Pacífico is considered one of the most prestigious private education institutes in Peru, characterized by the professional excellence of its graduates who occupy important positions in a wide range of sectors including finance, politics, economics and consultancy. He was recognized as one of the highest achievers at Pacifico, being honored with the Robert Maes Award, given each year to students who succeed in gaining first place in academic performance in the various programs offered by the university. He then moved to the [[United States]], in order to study there, and finally gain an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="CADE Executives 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wharton Global Alumni Forum Lima, Perú|url = http://www.whartonlima08.com/attendees.html|website = www.whartonlima08.com|access-date = 2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Alejandro received a full scholarship from [[Google]] to attend [[Singularity University]]’s Global Solutions Program, deepening his expertise in exponential technologies.&lt;ref name="Singularity University"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/singularityu/reflections-from-singularity-u-finding-my-tribe-positive-self-talk-and-other-insights-from-ef8e314e5f27|title=Reflections from Singularity University|access-date = 2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Ponce began his professional career as an Analyst at Interinvest (Investment Bank in Peru) and during his MBA he worked for [[Salomon Smith Barney]] , a Wall Street investment bank that went on to become the investment banking operations of Citigroup after a merger in 1998. 
 
In 1998, at age 28, he founded Nexus Group with Rafael Dasso, Carlos Rodríguez Pastor, and Jose Antonio Rosas.

[[File:American College of Medical Practice Executives (logo).png|right]]The '''American College of Medical Practice Executives''' (ACMPE), established in 1956, supports and promotes the personal and professional growth of leaders to advance the medical practice management profession and is the certification and standard-setting body of the '''[[Medical Group Management Association]]''' (MGMA). Both are headquartered in Englewood, Colo. Nearly 6,000 members strong, ACMPE developed the standard-setting Body of Knowledge for Medical Practice Management. It grants nationally recognized [[Professional certification|certification]] and [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] designations to the most accomplished medical practice executives and leaders in the profession.

Members of the ACMPE may obtain recognition for their knowledge and experience by becoming Certified Medical Practice Executives (CMPE) or a Fellow of the American College of Medical Practice Executives (FACMPE).  Certification [http://www.mgma.com/pd/default.aspx?id=7346 (CMPE)] requires candidates who have the requisite two years of relevant experience to demonstrate their proficiency through objective and essay examinations and presentations that include content from the Body of Knowledge for Medical Practice Management.  Fellowship [http://www.mgma.com/pd/default.aspx?id=1202 (FACMPE)] requires the submission of a professional paper or series of case studies by members who have already earned the CMPE designation.  Both the CMPE and FACMPE status require the maintenance of continuing education credit hours.

==MGMA==

The '''[[Medical Group Management Association]]''' defines and advances the medical practice management profession and advocates on its behalf. Its resources help the American College of Medical Practice Executives support and promote the professional growth of leaders.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2637">In [[economics]], '''average fixed cost''' ('''AFC''') is the [[fixed cost]]s of production (FC) divided by the quantity (Q) of output produced. Fixed costs are those costs that must be incurred in fixed quantity regardless of the level of output produced.

:&lt;math&gt;AFC=\frac{FC}{Q}.&lt;/math&gt;

Average fixed cost is a per-unit-of-output  of fixed costs.  As the total number of units of the good produced increases, the average fixed cost decreases because the same amount of fixed costs is being spread over a larger number of units of output.

[[Average variable cost]] plus average fixed cost equals [[average cost|average total cost]]:

:&lt;math&gt;ATC=AVC+AFC&lt;/math&gt;

== Explanation ==

=== Example 1 ===
Assume a firm produces clothing. When the quantity of the output varies from 5 shirts to 10 shirts, fixed cost would be 30 dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-37434-0_12|title=Microeconomics|last=Dorman|first=Peter|date=2014|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=9783642374333|series=Springer Texts in Business and Economics|pages=249–274|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-37434-0_12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, average fixed cost of producing 5 shirts would be 30 dollars divided by 5 shirts, which is 6 dollars.  In other words, when 5 shirts are produced, 30 dollars of fixed cost would spread and result in 6 dollars per shirt. Similarly, average fixed cost of producing 10 shirts would be 3 dollars derived from 30 dollars divided by 10 shirts.
[[File:Average_fixed_cost.png|thumb|A table and graph of average fixed cost]]

=== Example 2 ===
In Example1, there was no information about average total cost and average variable cost. If the firm knows average total cost and average variable cost, it is possible to find the same result as Example 1. Because average total cost is average variable cost plus average fixed cost, average fixed cost is average total cost minus average variable cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&amp;c=dsp&amp;k=average+fixed+cost|title=AmosWEB is Economics: Encyclonomic WEB*pedia|website=www.amosweb.com|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; If producing 5 shirts generates average total cost of 11 dollars and average variable cost of 5 dollars, fixed cost would be 6 dollars. Similarly, the firm produces 10 shirts and average total cost and average variable cost is 10 dollars and 7 dollars respectively. In this case, average fixed cost would be 3 dollars.

'''Beverley Randolph''' (1754{{spaced ndash}}February 7, 1797) was an [[American politician]] from [[Virginia]].  From 1788 to 1791, he served as the [[List of Governors of Virginia|eighth]] [[Governor of Virginia]].

==Biography==
Randolph was one of four children born to Peter Randolph, son of [[William Randolph II]], and Lucille (Bolling) Randolph, at [[Turkey Island (James River)|Turkey Island]], a plantation in [[Henrico County, Virginia|Henrico County]] in the [[Colony of Virginia]].&lt;ref name="Page"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Page |first1=Richard Channing Moore |title=Genealogy of the Page Family in Virginia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cOBBAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= |edition=2 |year=1893 |month= |publisher=Press of the Publishers Printing Co. |location=New York |isbn= |pages=249–272 |chapter=Randolph Family |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=cOBBAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA247#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert Isham Randolph"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Randolph |first1=Robert Isham |title=The Randolphs of Virginia: A Compilation of the Descendants of William Randolph of Turkey Island and His Wife Mary Isham Of Bermuda Hundred |url=http://randolpharchives.org/books/Randolphs_of_Virginia_001-052.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate= |year=1936 |month= |publisher= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Randolph's siblings was Ann Bolling Randolph Fitzhugh, wife of [[William Fitzhugh]].&lt;ref name="Robert Isham Randolph"/&gt;

Randolph was educated at [[The College of William and Mary]] and married Martha Cocke in 1775. He served in the militia during the [[American Revolutionary War]], was a member of the [[Virginia Assembly]] and was a member of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] from 1777 to 1780. When [[George Wythe]] withdrew from the [[Philadelphia Convention of 1787]], [[George Mason]] suggested that Randolph (who happened to be in [[Philadelphia]] at the time) be appointed in his place.  The Council and governor decided that in light of the abilities of Virginia's remaining delegates, Wythe did not need to be replaced.  Randolph was elected [[Governor of Virginia]] in 1788, the first to be elected after Virginia ratified the [[United States Constitution]]. He died on his farm near Green Creek in [[Cumberland County, Virginia]].

'''Bleached Chemi-ThermoMechanical Pulp''' (BCTMP) is a pulp product used by the [[paper industry]] as a less expensive alternative for Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft (NBSK).

BCTMP was first produced by Millar Western in 1988 in its Whitecourt Mill, and was initially used in lower grade paper applications.&lt;ref name="Pulp &amp; Paper CA article - BCTMP"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodden|first1=Graeme|title=BCTMP: A PULP FOR ALL REASONS?|journal=Pulp &amp; Paper Canada|date=2000-09-01|issue=September 2000|url=http://www.pulpandpapercanada.com/news/bctmp-a-pulp-for-all-reasons/1000106738/?&amp;er=NA|accessdate=2015-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The product is attractive to producers because it needed less capital to construct the production facilities and provides higher yields than other processes which lowers the total cost of production.  In addition, BCTMP provides higher bulk, opacity and stiffness in the final product and the process is more environmentally friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cannell|first1=Eric|title=The Future of BCTMP|url=http://www.risiinfo.com/db_area/archive/p_p_mag/2000/0005/feat2.htm|website=www.risiinfo.com/|publisher=Pulp &amp; Paper|accessdate=2015-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Carmine Forte, Baron Forte''' {{IPAc-en|'|f|ɔr|t|eɪ}} (1908 – 2007) was a Scottish-Italian caterer and hotelier of Italian origin who founded the leisure and hotels conglomerate that ultimately became the [[Forte Group]].  The Forte family are a famous Italian family in a similar way to the [[Rockefeller family|Rockefeller]]s and [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1544150/Lord-Forte.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.italyonthisday.com/2016/11/charles-forte-businessman-and-hotelier.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childhood and education==
Charles Forte was born as Carmine Forte in [[Mortale]], now Monforte, [[Casalattico]], in the province of [[Frosinone]], [[Italy]] in 1908. He emigrated from Italy to [[Scotland]] at the age of four with his family.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6403767.stm |title=Hotel baron Lord Forte dies at 98 | publisher=''[[BBC News Online]]'' |date=28 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended [[Alloa Academy]] and then [[St. Joseph's College, Dumfries]] as a boarder, followed by two years in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/mar/01/guardianobituaries.travel |title=Obituary – Lord Forte |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=1 March 2007 | location=London | first=Roger | last=Cowe | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
{{See also|Newport Pagnell services}}
After Rome, Forte rejoined his family, who had moved to [[Weston-super-Mare]], where his father ran a café with two cousins. Charles's main training at the age of 21 came in [[Brighton]], where he managed the Venetian Lounge for a cousin.

At 26, he set up his first "milk bar" in 1935, the Strand Milk Bar Ltd, in [[Regent Street]], London, having thoroughly researched the location.&lt;ref name = "Guardian"/&gt; Soon he began expanding into catering and hotel businesses. At the outbreak of [[World War II]], Forte was [[interned]] in the [[Isle of Man]] due to his Italian nationality, but he was released after only three months.&lt;ref name = "Guardian"/&gt; After the war, his company became Forte Holdings Ltd and bought the Café Royal in 1954. 

In the 1950s, he also opened the first catering facility at [[Heathrow Airport]] and the first full British motorway service station for cars at [[Newport Pagnell]], Buckinghamshire, on the [[M1 motorway]] in 1959. He purchased the Hungaria Restaurant in Lower Regent St. in 1955.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Later career==
[[File:Grave of Charles Forte in West Hampstead Cemetery.JPG|thumb|Grave of Lord and Lady Forte in [[West Hampstead Cemetery]]]]
Trust Houses Group Ltd and Forte Holdings were merged in 1970 to become [[Trust House Forte]] or THF. Through mergers and expansion, Forte expanded the Forte Group into a multibillion-pound business. His empire included the [[Little Chef]] and [[Happy Eater]] roadside restaurants, [[Crest Hotels|Crest]], [[Forte Grand]], [[Travelodge]] and [[Posthouse Hotels|Posthouse]] hotels, as well as the wine merchant Grierson-Blumenthal and a non-controlling majority stake in the [[Savoy Hotel]].

The Grierson-Blumenthal stake became a legally "forced" acquisition by the group. It had been a personal holding of Charles Forte and fellow directors of the group, supplying liquor to Forte restaurants and hotels at substantial personal profit, until the prejudice to shareholders was realised in the late 1970s (including possible prosecution under the [[Companies Act]]) which obliged its acquisition as a subsidiary.

Forte was the CEO from 1971 and chairman from 1982 (when his son [[Rocco Forte|Rocco]] took over as CEO) of the Group. Happy Eater and the five [[Welcome Break]] major road service outlets were bought from Hanson Trust PLC on 1 August 1986. In the 1990s, the company increased its nominal capital and agreed to the public listed companies compliance regime to become Forte Group plc.

Forte passed full control to his son Rocco in 1993, but soon the plc was faced with a hostile takeover bid from [[Granada plc|Granada]]. Ultimately, Granada succeeded with a £3.9&amp;nbsp;billion [[tender offer]] in January 1996, which left the family with about £350&amp;nbsp;million in cash.

On 28 February 2007, Forte died in his sleep at his home in London, aged 98.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; He is buried in [[West Hampstead Cemetery]]. 

==Honours and awards==
Forte was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] by [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|The Queen Mother]] in 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=45152 |date=17 July 1970 |page=7941}}&lt;/ref&gt; and created a [[life peer]] on 2 February 1982 as '''Baron Forte''', of [[Ripley, Surrey|Ripley]] in the County of [[Surrey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=48883 |date=5 February 1982 |page=1621}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a knight of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]].

==Family==
In January 1943, Forte married Irene Mary Chierico, an English woman with Italian origin too. From the 1950s, Forte lived with an extended family including his parents and children at Greenway Gardens in [[Frognal]], [[Hampstead]], London.&lt;ref name ="Autobiog"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Charles Forte | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=Charles Forte – Autobiography | date=1986 | publisher=Sedgewick | location=London | isbn= | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worshipped at the [[Roman Catholic]] [[St Mary's Church, Hampstead|St. Mary's Church]] in nearby Holly Lane, [[Hampstead]]. 

Together, they had six children, five girls and a boy: 
* The Hon. Sir [[Rocco Forte]] (b. 1945 as Rocco John Vincent Forte), who was knighted in 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=54058 |date=9 June 1995 |page=8075}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Hon. [[Olga Polizzi|Olga Forte]] CBE (b. 1947), who was married to the late Count Alessandro Polizzi&lt;ref name=Rivkin&gt;{{cite web|last=Rivkin|first=Annabel|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/esmagazine/alex-polizzi-a-most-unlikely-sex-bomb-7309946.html|title=Alex Polizzi, a most unlikely sex bomb|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|date=20 January 2012|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; then The Hon. [[William Shawcross]] 
**their daughter is [[Alexandra Polizzi]], an [[Hotel manager|hotelier]] and the presenter of [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]'s ''[[The Hotel Inspector]]''

* The Hon. Portia Forte (b. 1964)

Irene, Lady Forte died in 2010, and she is buried with her husband. His ancestry is centred on records of his birthplace Mortale, now Monforte in [[Casalattico]], [[Lazio]].  The Forte family tree has now been fully mapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fortefamilyhistory.com/Family_Tree.html|title=Forte Family Tree|last=Forte|first=Paul|website=www.fortefamilyhistory.com|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable family members include [[Social engineering (security)|Lisa Forte]], social engineering expert and public figure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2018">The [[Chief of Naval Operations]] (CNO) ''Aviation Safety Award'', also known as the ''Safety "S"'', is awarded annually to [[U.S. Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps]] aviation units operating under Navy chains of command. 

==Selection ==
[[Image:Safety S on S-3B Viking.png|thumb|Capital letter "S" painted on the side of this [[S-3B Viking]] indicates that the squadron was the recipient of the annual CNO Aviation Safety Award. The slashes under the letter indicate multiple year awards.]]  One squadron from each type aircraft (e.g. [[E-2 Hawkeye]], [[FA-18 Hornet]], [[P-3 Orion]], etc.) from each coast (i.e. East and West) is chosen.  For example, one [[SH-60 Seahawk]] squadron from [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia and one SH-60 squadron from [[NAS North Island]], California is chosen each year.  Marine squadrons that deploy with Navy units are also eligible.  Selected squadrons receive engraved plaques and citations for permanent display, and are also entitled to paint a prominent "S" on their aircraft until the next year's selections are made.

==Criteria==
Selection of winners is based on aircraft flight mishap rates, ground mishaps, currency of safety programs, flight exposure (aircraft-days embarked aboard ship (if appropriate), aircraft-day deployed away from home base (if applicable), etc.).  Subjective criteria are also used.  These include quality contributions to the Naval Aviation Safety Program, such as timely reporting of hazards, recommendations for corrective action, safety articles for publication, suggestions for improvement in equipment (survival, aircraft, ground support, etc.) facilities, and maintenance practices, and other matters considered appropriate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22216">'''Sergio Claudio Cirigliano''' is an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] businessman who, with his brother Mario, operates major rail and bus concessions in [[Buenos Aires]] and elsewhere in Argentina through the Grupo Plaza conglomerate. One source has described the brothers as making up “one of the most powerful business groups in the country.”&lt;ref name=agencia&gt;{{cite web| title =Un imperio llamado familia Cirigliano| work =Agencia de Noticias| url =http://www.agenciacna.com/2/nota_1.php?noticia_id=33504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cirigliano and his brother were widely held responsible for the deadly [[2012 Buenos Aires rail disaster|Once railway disaster]] in February 2012, which occurred on one of the railway lines that they ran, because they had allegedly pocketed government subsidies intended to cover maintenance costs. Grupo Plaza was said to have been awarded concessions for rail and bus lines because of Cirigliano's close friendships with Presidents [[Carlos Menem]], [[Nestor Kirchner]], and [[Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner]]. Also, Cirigliano was accused of having bribed Secretaries of Transportation [[Ricardo Jaime]] and [[Juan Pablo Schiavi]], who directly oversaw the awarding of rail and bus concessions. Later in 2012, both Cirigliano and his brother Mario went on trial on charges of corruption and fraudulent administration in connection with the Once crash.

''La Nación'' described him as the “successful driver of the K line,” the “K” being a sardonic reference to his close connections to the Kirchner family.&lt;ref name=lanac&gt;{{cite web| last =Olivera| first =Francisco| title =Claudio Cirigliano, el exitoso chofer de la línea K| work =La Nacion| date =Sep 20, 2009| url =http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1176410-claudio-cirigliano-el-exitoso-chofer-de-la-linea-k}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Cirigliano is the son of Nicola Cirigliano, who was born in Vaglio Basilicata, Italy, and moved to Argentina at age 18. After working as a laborer and truck driver, Nicola borrowed money from a friend and bought a bus route. This was the beginning of a transport firm, originally called Transporte Automotor Plaza, which he founded in 1959. Claudio, born in 1964 or 1965 (in September 2009, he was 44 years old), was Nicola's last-born son. Claudio grew up in Parque Patricios and studied at a technical college.&lt;ref name=lanac/&gt;

==Career==

===Grupo Plaza===
After completing his studies, Cirigliano went to work in the family business. In 1975, for health  reasons, Nicola handed over the management of his business to Claudio and his two other sons.&lt;ref name=lanac/&gt; At that time the family owned a few passenger buses for an urban line&lt;ref name=agencia/&gt; namely the two bus lines, 61  and 62.&lt;ref name=plaza&gt;{{cite web| last =Rojas| first =Diego| title =Asesinato colectivo| work =Plaza de Mayo| date =Feb 23, 2012| url =http://www.plazademayo.com/2012/02/asesinato-colectivo-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Claudio Cirigliano's friendships with presidents Carlos Menem and Nestor Kirchner played a crucial role in the growth of the family business, winning the Ciriglianos more and more concessions and subsidies. One source attributes their success largely to their ability to form “strategic ties with shifting political powers.” The Cirigliano brothers have been described as being “forever friends of power,” whose business was created and maintained through government subsidies. Claudio's closeness to Menem is reflected in the fact that he  was part of the entourage that accompanied Menem on his first visit to the [[UK]]. In the 1990s, the two men played golf together frequently.&lt;ref name=agencia/&gt;

The business empire of Claudio Cirigliano and his brother began to grow significantly in the 1990s, when they profited from the privatization of many rail lines under Menem, who gave them control of several of the lines. During this time the brothers established or bought many companies which became subsidiaries of the family firm, which was originally named Transporte Automotor Plaza and which later changed its name to Grupo Plaza. In 1991 the Ciriglianos formed the holding company Comercio Metropolitano de Transporte (Cometrans). Today, Grupo Plaza is the main shareholder in Cometrans. The formation of the holding company Cometrans made it possible for the Cirigliano brothers to obtain the concession for the Metrovías SA subway service, which they held from 1994 to 2000.&lt;ref name=agencia/&gt;

In 1993, the brothers acquired the San Martin General Military Factory, which they made the headquarters of their firm [[Emprendimientos Ferroviarios S.A.]] (EMFER), which is involved in the repair and maintenance of railroad cars, and Tecnología Avanzada en Transporte SA (TATSA), which assembles and repairs buses. In 1993 they acquired Lines 143, 141, and 36; in 1994, they acquired 140, 142, and 133; in 1998 they acquired Línes 124 and 114. The Ciriglianos also bought stock in the Line 104 firm. In 1994 they were granted the concession to run Trenes de Buenos Aires (TBA), which controls the Mitre and Sarmiento train lines; they began running it in 1995. The TBA concession marked the beginning of their climb to prominence with no notable hindrance under the Kirchner administration. Between 1994 and 2000 Cometrans ran the Metrovías concession, and from 1998 to 2007 it was one of the firms that ran the Metro in Río de Janeiro through the Opportrans consortium.&lt;ref name=agencia/&gt;

While Menem, during his presidency, helped the Ciriglianos to acquire railway lines, Kirchner, in his time, helped them expand into the long-distance bus sector.&lt;ref name=agencia/&gt;&lt;ref name=lanac/&gt; which became the focus of their expansion efforts in 2003. The family business is also said to have greatly benefited from Claudio Cirigliano's close relationship with Domingo Cavallo, who served as Minister of the Economy under Menem and Fernando de la Rúa.&lt;ref name=lanac/&gt; At one point, the state paid the Cirigliano brothers seventy million dollars to cover ten years' worth of repairs to the trains running on the Sarmiento and Mitre lines.&lt;ref name=plaza/&gt;

In addition to his close ties to the late Nestor Kirchner and to current President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, Cirigliano has had longstanding connections with several leading Kirchnerite politicians. In 2003, he collected campaign contributions for Kirchnerite politician [[Anibal Fernandez]]; he gave [[Ricardo Jaime]], Nestor Kirchner's Transportation Secretary, a Toyota in 2003 and a horse in 2007; and he once sent a doctor to treat Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's Minister of Planning, Julio De Vido, for diabetes.&lt;ref name=lanac/&gt; Claudio owns a Citation 501 plane,&lt;ref name=agencia/&gt; which he has lent to public officials. One reflection of Cirigliano's closeness to the Kirchers is the fact that for six months, at the request of the government, he paid the salaries of employees of the defunct airline Southern Winds, to which the brothers had no connection.&lt;ref name=agencia/&gt;

Over time, Grupo Plaza came to run public transport throughout Argentina. As of 2009, the Ciriglianos owned 21 of the 135 local bus lines in Buenos Aires and several more in La Pampa and Bahia Blanca, plus a number of long-distance bus routes, in addition to the Sarmiento and Mitre railway lines. Grupo Plaza also has investments in Miami.&lt;ref name=lanac/&gt;

The three Cirigliano brothers own Grupo Plaza jointly. Sources disagree on the way in which they divide their responsibilities. According to the Argentina Independent, Mario is officially the head of the firm, while Claudio is head of Trenes Buenos Aires (TBA).&lt;ref name=argind&gt;{{cite web| title =Grupo Plaza Owner to Testify in Once Tragedy Case| work =Argentina Independent| date =Jun 12, 2013| url =http://www.argentinaindependent.com/tag/judge-claudio-bonadio/}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''La Nación'', Claudio manages the department that deals with lines of transport, while Mario is in charge of the subsidiary Consorcio Metropolitano de Transporte (Cometrans); in turn, says La Nación, Cometrans controls the firms TBA (trains), Emfer (rail equipment construction), TAT SA (bus construction) and Ferrovial Baires (buildings and railway infrastructure).&lt;ref name=lanac/&gt; Another source describes Claudio as the head of Cometrans and his brother Antonio as the head of TBA.&lt;ref name=cdn&gt;{{cite web| title =Prosecutor requests indictment of Schiavi and Jaime| work =Buenos Aires Herald| date =Jun 19, 2012| url =http://cdn-herald.planisys.net/article/103978/prosecutor-requests-indictment-of-schiavi-and-jaime-}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another source identifies Claudio as the largest shareholder in TBA and Roque Cirigliano, the brothers' cousin, as manager of TBA's rolling stock.&lt;ref name=info&gt;{{cite web| title =Detuvieron a Claudio Cirigliano por obstruir la investigación| work =Info Region| url =http://www.inforegion.com.ar/vernota.php?id=256195&amp;dis=1&amp;sec=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still another source describes Grupo Plaza as the transport division of the Cirigliano Group, with TBA, Emfer, and TATSA also being divisions of the Cirigliano Group, along with Lua La porteña (an insurance firm), Opportrans, and, until 2007, Rio de Janeiro Metro (both foreign  concessions). The Cirigliano Group is also involved in bilateral projects, such as the railroad between Argentina and [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref name=agencia/&gt;&lt;ref name=plaza/&gt;

In addition  to accumulating bus and train routes, both urban and interurban, the Ciriglianos were contracted to manufacture and repair vehicles and to maintain infrastructure. They also opened a travel agency, Pasajes Express, and a company that places advertisements on trains, buses, and streets. Grupo Plaza owns Transmedios, a PR firm, which was founded in 2007, and in 2009 they founded Ticketrans, which sells farecards for the trains and buses operated by the group. Grupo Plaza has also been a main beneficiaries of the national government's “TV for All” plan to prove free TV to 1.2 million welfare recipients. Televisión Digital Terrestre (TDT), a holding company that is a subsidiary of Grupo Plaza, won a contract to supply decoders for the plan. Under the umbrella of Cometrans, meanwhile, is the firm Consorcio New Tronic, which manufactures signal converters that are also part of the “TV for All” plan.&lt;ref name=agencia/&gt; The firm obtained a 160 million peso contract for the manufacture of 1.2 million digital converters.&lt;ref name=plaza/&gt;

A 2013 report stated that the brothers own two passenger-transport firms in [[Miami]], Travelynx and Red Coach. In 2009, they bought Travelynx, which operates private shuttles. Later they bought Red Coach, which specializes in “luxury transport.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Las empresas de los hermanos Cirigliano en Miami| work =La Nacion| date =Feb 24, 2013| url =http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1557595-las-empresas-de-los-hermanos-cirigliano-en-miami}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the brothers own a subsidiary of Cometrans called Cometrans Qatar, founded in 2009 with the purpose of entering the Arab market. On behalf of Cometrans Qatar, Claudio Cirigliano carried out negotiations with Qatargas that concluded in January 2011. The result was an arrangement whereby Argentina would import 8 million dollars' worth of gasoline per day. Cometrans Qatar also constructed a 2,177-kilometer railway line connecting parts of [[Saudi Arabia]] with the [[United Arab Emirates]]. The firm also entered into a collaborative arrangement in January 2010 with Aamal Company QSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Los Cirigliano, dueños de TBA, y su último gran negocio con el Gobierno| work =Perfil| date =Feb 23, 2012| url =http://www.perfil.com/politica/Los-Cirigliano-duenos-de-TBA-y-su-ultimo-gran-negocio-con-el-Gobierno-20120223-0013.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today Grupo Plaza calls itself “la empresa de impresas” – “the business of businesses.” It operates 40 urban lines, 20 in the City of Buenos Aires, 12 in the city of [[Bahía Blanca]] and 8 lines in the city of Santa Rosa, La Pampa. The group also owns the firms Transporte Automotor Plaza, Mayo Transporte Automotor, Transporte Mariano Moreno, Transporte 104, Ecotrans (which runs 10 rural bus lines), Dumas Cat, Plus Ultra Mercobus, and El Rápido Argentino. Transporte Automotor Plaza, Dumas Cat, Plus Ultra Mercobus, and El Rápido Argentino all run medium- and long-distance services. The following firms provide the following transport services: Transporte Automotor Plaza runs lines 114, 124, 133, 140, 142, 143; Mayo Transporte Automotor runs line 141; Transporte Mariano Moreno runs line 36; Ecotrans runs the provincial lines 253, 321, 322, 317, 503, and 635. Grupo Plaza also controls the firm Sistemas Integrados de Gestion (SIG) SA, which provides IT services and develops software and other computer technology with transport applications. The Cirigliano family has control of city trains that transport 40 percent of the daily urban train traffic in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name=agencia/&gt;

Today the company received billions of pesos in government subsidies.&lt;ref name=agencia/&gt; As of 2009, Cometrans was receiving 55 million pesos from the Argentinian government, 37 million for operating trains and 18 million for operating local transport.&lt;ref name=lanac/&gt; The Cirigliano Group received 76.9 million pesos (17.7M USD) in subsidies in January 2012.&lt;ref name=pulsa&gt;{{cite web| last =Merchant| first =Paul| title =Argentina 27/02/2012| work =Pulsa Merica| date =Feb 27, 2012| url =http://www.pulsamerica.co.uk/2012/02/27/argentina-train-crash-buenos-aires-schools/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claudio Cirigliano has maintained that the subsidies are necessary to keep fares down.&lt;ref name=lanac/&gt; In 2012, TBA was expected to receive more than two million pesos in state subsidies per day, totaling 832.5 million pesos annually.&lt;ref name=plaza/&gt; The Ciriglianos are also permitted to purchase gasoline at discounted prices.&lt;ref name=agencia/&gt;

===Other business activity===
Independently from Grupo Plaza, Claudio Cirigliano owns Yaniel SA, which is active in cattle raising. He also runs Invercla Inversora SA, an investment firm, and Ibancor, a real-estate firm. Mario Cirigliano owns Travel Shop SA, a marketing firm, and publishes Fuente: Revista Desafío Económico. Both brothers are on the payroll of the investment firm BC Austral. Their insurance firms Lua Seguros and Seguros La Porteña have been described as “judicially very irregular” and have been accused of having “swindled thousands of clients” in cases that led to numerous “unresolved lawsuits.”&lt;ref name=agencia/&gt;

For a time in the 1990s, Claudio Cirigliano also owned a security firm called Centauro.&lt;ref name=lanac/&gt;

==Once crash==
{{Main|2012 Buenos Aires rail disaster}}

On February 22, 2012, a train crashed at the Once railway station, killing 51 people. The train was on the Sarmiento line, operated by TBA.&lt;ref name=pulsa/&gt; Blame was placed on Claudio Cirigliano and his brothers, who were accused of obtaining the railroad concession through favoritism and bribery and of pocketing government subsidies intended to cover maintenance costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Hoy declara Cirigliano y el juicio por Once no se verá en directo| work =Clarin| date =Apr 14, 2014| url =http://www.clarin.com/ciudades/Hoy-declara-Cirigliano-Once-directo_0_1120687996.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the brothers were accused of bribing Ricardo Jaime, who served as Secretary of Transportation from 2003 to 2009, and Juan Pablo Schiavi, who held the same post from 2009 to 2012, with personal gifts and free travel.&lt;ref name=plaza/&gt;

A news report on February 24, 2012, stated that Jaime was facing charges in court that he had received “free vacation flights from Claudio Cirigliano, whose holding company owns Trenes de Buenos Aires (TBA), the company that runs the Sarmiento line and others.” The lawsuit maintained that Claudio Cirigliano had “paid for plane tickets to [[Brazil]] for Jaime, who at the time was in charge of granting subsidies to the private concession-holders running the rail system, so that they would keep ticket prices down.”

Héctor Polino, founder of a citizens group called Consumidores Libres (Free Consumers), which had filed many complaints against the firms running Argentina's railways, was quoted in the February 24 report as saying that when he was in the legislature, and the courts issued an interim measure to keep the transport companies from raising ticket prices, Cirigliano had tried repeatedly to get Polino to meet him at somewhere other than his congressional office; when Polino kept refusing, Cirigliano pressured him to cease pushing forward with the case, as did a representative of the transport workers union who said he was acting in Cirigliano’s name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Valente| first =Marcela| title =Privatisation Derailed Argentina’s Rail System| work =Inter Press Service| date =Feb 24, 2012 | url =http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/02/privatisation-derailed-argentinas-rail-system}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that the Argentinian government had failed to “impose the necessary controls on TBA and its owner, the Cirigliano Group, due to its close personal relations with the president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.”&lt;ref name=pulsa/&gt;

After the Once crash, the Argentinian government withdrew control of the Mitre and Sarmiento train lines from Grupo Plaza.&lt;ref name=argind/&gt;

On March 5, 2012, Federal Judge Claudio Bonadio banned Cirigliano and Transportation Secretary [[Juan Pablo Schiavi]] from leaving the country while an investigation of the Once crash proceeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Once tragedy: judge bans Schiavi, TBA chairman from leaving country| work =Buenos Aires Herald| date =Mar 5, 2012| url =http://cdn-herald.planisys.net/article/94552/once-tragedy-judge-bans-schiavi-tba-chairman-from-leaving-country}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 5, 2012, Bonadio ordered Cirigliano's arrest along with that of three other TBA executives for obstructing the investigation of the Once crash. Also arrested were Carlo Ferrari, president of TBA; Dario Tempone, managing director of TBA; and Daniel Rubio, director of administration for TBA.&lt;ref name=info/&gt; Bonadio stated that Cirigliano had caused key evidence about government payments to TBA to disappear and that it was impossible to determine how the millions of dollars received by TBA from the government had been spent. Documents that Cirigliano had allegedly caused to disappear were eventually found in a reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Tragedia de Once: detuvieron al dueño de TBA, Claudio Cirigliano| work =ambito| date =Jun 4, 2012| url =http://www.ambito.com/noticia.asp?id=639743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19, 2012, Federal Prosecutor Federico Delgado requested the prosecution of thirty persons, including Claudio and Antonio Cirigliano and former transport secretaries Juan Pablo Schiavi and Ricardo Jaime, in connection with the Once train crash.&lt;ref name=cdn/&gt; During the trial that ensued, Claudio Cirigliano told the court that TBA had a debt of approximately 1.9 billion pesos and said that money could be set aside to help the families of the crash victims.&lt;ref name=lanac2&gt;{{cite web| title =Tragedia de Once: Bonadio procesó a Jaime, Schiavi y a los hermanos Cirigliano| work =La Nacion| date =Oct 19, 2012| url =http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1518707-tragedia-de-once-bonadio-proceso-a-jaime-schiavi-y-a-los-hermanos-cirigliano}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''La Nación'' reported on October 19, 2012, that Claudio and Mario Cirigliano, as well as former Secretaries of Transport Ricardo Jaime and Juan Pablo Schiavi, were being prosecuted in connection with the Once crash. The Cirigliano brothers were charged with conspiracy. While Bonadio had also indicted seven former TBA officials, he dismissed charges against the driver of the wrecked train, Marco Antonio Córdoba, and Antonio Sícaro, former comptroller of the National Commission for Transport Regulation (CNRT). La Nación further noted that Bonadio had ordered the Cirigliano brothers held in pre-trial detention, but that the Federal Chamber had cancelled the order. La Nación also quoted Minister of Interior and Transportation Florencio Randazzo as saying that the Sarmiento and Mitre train lines were “calamitous, a real disaster” as a result of the granting of the concession to the Cirigliano family.&lt;ref name=lanac2/&gt;

On June 12, 2013, it was reported that judges of the Second Chamber of the Federal Criminal and Correctional Court of Appeals had removed the “lack of merit” clause protecting Mario Cirigliano from being questioned in the Once train crash. Both Claudio and Mario were charged with corruption and fraudulent administration in connection with the Once train crash.&lt;ref name=argind/&gt;

An October 5, 2013, report stated that Claudio Cirigliano had been “accused of paying for the Brazilian holidays of the previous transport minister, Ricardo Jaime, as a tacit thank you for the millions of dollars in subsidies TBA has received from the state.” Also, a judicial investigation had established that Cirigliano “had bought costly Polynesian furniture and thousands of dollars’ worth of jewellery with a corporate credit card.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Not driving but sleeping| work =The Economist| date =Oct 5, 2013| url =https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21587217-government-decides-it-time-shake-things-up-not-driving-sleeping}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chamber of Appeals declared inadmissible on September 24, 2014, appeals by Claudio Cirigliano and Jaime, who were on trial for the exchange of gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Ratifican la citación a juicio de Ricardo Jaime y Claudio Cirigliano en causa por dádivas| work =Clarin| date =Sep 25, 2014| url =http://www.clarin.com/politica/Ricardo_Jaime-Claudio_Cirigliano_0_1218478501.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Because of his size, Cirigliano was nicknamed “El Gordo” until 2008, when he had a gastric bypass operation and lost a good deal of weight.&lt;ref name=lanac/&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Daily Mail'' aviation prizes}}
Between 1906 and 1930, the '''''[[Daily Mail]]''''' newspaper, initially on the initiative of its proprietor, [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/PDFArchive/View/1913/1913%20-%200958.html "Direct initiative of Lord Northcliffe] Flight" PDF Archive, 6 September 1913&lt;/ref&gt; awarded numerous prizes for achievements in [[aviation]]. The newspaper would stipulate the amount of a prize for the first aviators to perform a particular task in aviation, or to the winner of an aviation race or event. The most famous prizes were the £1,000 for the first cross-channel flight awarded to [[Louis Blériot]] in 1909 and the £10,000 given in 1919 to [[Alcock and Brown]] for the first non-stop transatlantic flight between North America and [[Ireland]].

The prizes are credited with advancing the course of aviation during the early years, with the considerable sums offered becoming a much-coveted goal for the field's pioneers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Such |first1=Colin |title=The Daily Mail's Sponsorship of British Pioneer Aviation |url=https://www.warwickandwarwick.com/resources/articles-library/the-daily-mails-sponsorship-of-british-pioneer-aviation |website=Warwick &amp; Warwick |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and awards==
[[File:David E. Sanger 2011 05.jpg|thumb|175px|David E. Sanger at the Miller Center, May 11, 2011]]
David E. Sanger is chief [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] correspondent for ''The New York Times'' and one of the newspaper's senior writers. In a 30-year career at the paper, he has reported from New York, Tokyo and Washington, specializing in foreign policy, national security and the politics of globalization. Soon after joining the ''Times'' in 1982, Sanger began specializing in the confluence of economic and foreign policy. Throughout the ‘80’s and ‘90’s, he wrote extensively about how issues of national wealth and competitiveness came to redefine the relationships between the [[United States]] and its major allies. He was correspondent and then bureau chief in [[Tokyo]] for six years, travelling widely in [[Asia]]. He wrote some of the first pieces describing [[North Korea]]’s nuclear weapons program, the rise and fall of [[Japan]] as one of the world’s economic powerhouses, and [[China]]’s emerging role.

Returning to Washington in 1994, he took up the position of Chief Washington Economic Correspondent, and covered a series of global economic upheavals, from Mexico to the [[Asian economic crisis]]. He was named a senior writer in March 1999, and White House correspondent later that year. He was named Chief Washington Correspondent in October 2006. In 1986 Sanger played a major role in the team that investigated the causes of the [[space shuttle Challenger]] disaster. The team revealed the design flaws and bureaucratic troubles that contributed to the disaster, and won the 1987 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for national reporting. A decade later he was a member of another Pulitzer-winning team that wrote about the [[Clinton administration]]'s struggles to control exports to China.

Sanger was awarded, in 2004, the Weintal Prize for diplomatic reporting for his coverage of the Iraq and Korea crises. He also won the Aldo Beckman prize for coverage of the presidency. In both 2003 and 2007 he was awarded the Merriman Smith Memorial Award for coverage of national security strategy. He also shared the [[American Society of Newspaper Editors]]' top award for deadline writing in 2004, for team coverage of the Columbia disaster. In 2007, ''The New York Times'' received the DuPont Award from the [[Columbia Journalism School]] for ''Nuclear Jihad: Can Terrorists Get the Bomb?'', a documentary featuring him and colleague [[William J. Broad]], and their investigation into the [[A.Q. Khan]] nuclear proliferation network. Their revelations in the ''Times'' about the network became a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize]]. In 2011, Sanger was part of another team that was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for International Reporting for their coverage of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Japanese tsunami]] and [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|nuclear disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David E. Sanger|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/s/david_e_sanger/index.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
Sanger has written two books on [[US foreign policy]].  His first book is ''The New York Times'' best-seller ''The Inheritance: The World Obama Confronts and the Challenges to American Power'' (2009), based on his seven years as the ''Times'' [[White House]] correspondent, covering two wars, the confrontations with [[Iran]], [[North Korea]] and other states that are described in Western media as "rogue" states, and America’s efforts to deal with the rise of China.

Sanger's second book ''Confront and Conceal: Obama's Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power'' (2012) is an account of how Obama has dealt with those challenges, relying on innovative weapons (such as [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]s and [[cyberwarfare]], such as [[Operation Olympic Games]]) and reconfigured tools of American power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David E. Sanger|url=https://www.amazon.com/David-E.-Sanger/e/B001R5M5PK/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 General [[James Cartwright]], then the retired Vice Chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], pleaded guilty to making false statements in connection with the unauthorized disclosure of classified information, some of which appeared in one of the two books by David Sanger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jarrett|first1=Laura|title=Retired four-star general admits leaking top-secret info to media|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/17/politics/general-cartwright-pleads-guilty-leaking-information/index.html|work=CNN News|date=October 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-vice-chairman-joint-chiefs-staff-pleads-guilty-federal-felony-leak-investigation |title=Former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Pleads Guilty to Federal Felony in Leak Investigation |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 17 October 2016|website=justice.gov |publisher=United States Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanger's 2018 book is ''The Perfect Weapon: War, Sabotage, and Fear in the Cyber Age''.

==Lecturing and TV appearances==
Sanger is also an adjunct lecturer in public policy at the [[Kennedy School of Government]] at Harvard, where he is also the first National Security and the Press fellow at the school’s [[Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David E. Sanger|url=http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/experts/2206/david_e_sanger.html|publisher=Harvard|accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanger appears regularly on public affairs and news shows, including ''[[Washington Week]]'', the ''[[Charlie Rose Show]]'' on [[PBS]], [[Foreign Policy]]'s ''The Editor's Roundtable'' podcast, and the ''Deep State Radio'' podcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/tag/the-e-r-podcast/|title=The E.R. Podcast {{!}} Foreign Policy|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanger also appears regularly on the three main Sunday news shows, ''[[Face the Nation]]'', ''[[Meet the Press]]'' and ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]''. He also delivers the weekly ''Washington Report on WQXR'',  part of [[New York Public Radio]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15432">'''Featherbedding''' is the practice of hiring more workers than are needed to perform a given job, or to adopt work procedures which appear pointless, complex and time-consuming merely to employ additional workers.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy,'' 3rd ed., edited by E.D. Hirsch, Jr., Joseph F. Kett, and James Trefil, Houghton Mifflin Company, 2002. {{ISBN|0-618-22647-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "[[make-work]]" is sometimes used as a synonym for featherbedding.

The term "featherbedding" is usually used by management to describe behaviors and rules sought by workers.&lt;ref name="Gomberg"&gt;William Gomberg, "Featherbedding: An Assertion of Property Rights," ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,'' 333:1 (1961).&lt;/ref&gt; The term may equally apply to mid- and upper-level management, particularly in regard to top-heavy and "bloated" levels of middle- and upper-level management.&lt;ref&gt;"Featherbedding Brass," ''Time,'' May 14, 1956; C.A. Myers, "Top Management Featherbedding?", ''Sloan Management Review,'' 24:4 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; Featherbedding has also been occasionally used to describe [[rent-seeking]] behavior by corporations in response to economic regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Jarita Duasa and Paul Mosley, "Capital Controls Re-examined: The Case for 'Smart' Controls," ''The World Economy,'' 29:9 (September 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term "featherbedding" originally referred to any person who is pampered, coddled, or excessively rewarded. The term originated in the use of feathers to fill mattresses in beds, providing for more comfort.  The modern use of the term in the labor relations setting began in the [[United States]] railroad industry, which used feathered mattresses in sleeping cars. Railway [[trade union|labor unions]], confronted with changing technology which led to widespread unemployment, sought to preserve jobs by negotiating contracts which required employers to compensate workers to do little or no work or which required complex and time-consuming work rules so as to generate a full day's work for an employee who otherwise would not remain employed.&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law,'' 1st ed., Merriam-Webster, Inc., 1996. {{ISBN|0-87779-604-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1965 bulletin the United States Department of Labor referred to "featherbedding" as:
{{quote|a derogatory term applied to a practice, working rule, or agreement provision which limits output or requires employment of excess workers and thereby creates or preserves soft or unnecessary jobs; or to a charge or fee levied by a union upon a company for services which are not performed or not to be performed&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.du.edu/documents/transportation-law-journal/past-issues/v08/featherbedding.pdf Featherbedding on the Railroads: by Law and by Agreement]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since the mid-19th century, "featherbedding" has been most commonly used in the [[Industrial relations|labor relations]] field. Increasingly, the term has come to refer only to work rules or [[collective bargaining]] agreements demanded by labor unions.&lt;ref name="Simler"&gt;Norman J. Simler, "The Economics of Featherbedding", in ''Featherbedding and Technological Change'', ed. by Paul Weinstein, D.C. Heath and Co., 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

In nations where trade union activities are legally defined, legal definitions of featherbedding exist.  These definitions are few in number, and tend to be narrowly drawn. For example, the [[Taft-Hartley Act]] in the United States defines featherbedding in Section 8(b)(6) as any agreement or union demand for payment of wages for services which are not performed or not to be performed. However, in 1953, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that the Act's definition only applies to payments for workers not to work. Therefore, work rules requiring minimum crew sizes, the assignment of duties to craft workers, and other "make-work" agreements do not constitute featherbedding.&lt;ref&gt;''[[American Newspaper Publishers Association v. National Labor Relations Board]],'' [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/345/100 345 U.S. 100] (1953).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
Featherbedding is commonly seen by economists as a solution to "who should bear the burden of technological change?"&lt;ref name="Weinstein"&gt;Paul A. Weinstein, "The Featherbedding Problem," ''American Economic Review,'' 54:3 (May, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

Labor economists often argue that featherbedding is the most economically optimal position from both an employer's and employee's perspective. Featherbedding only emerges under certain circumstances. Chief among these is that the employer has an exploitable surplus (e.g., profit) to support the practice. Featherbedding also arises where market forces fail and organizations are permitted to be noncompetitive. Under this analysis, corporations (for example) are already inefficient and featherbedding does not make them more or less so. Featherbedding can, in some circumstances, take excess resources (profits) away from the employer and give them to workers in the form of more income per worker or higher numbers of employees at the same income level. Featherbedding is considered economically efficient because it occurs in the give-and-take of collective bargaining.  If employers were relatively strong vis-a-vis unions, unions would be unable to impose featherbedding on them. As the politico-socio-economic strength of each party changes over time, collective bargaining outcomes will as well, enlarging or reducing the number and impact of featherbedding rules on the employer.&lt;ref name="Simler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinstein" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd Ulman, ''The Rise of the National Trade Union,'' Harvard University Press, 1955; Clarence C. Morrison and Herbert J. Kiesling, "Featherbedding—An Easy Second Best Problem," ''Atlantic Economic Journal,'' 4:3 (September 1976).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry S. Farber, "The analysis of union behavior," ''Handbook of labor economics'' 2 (1986): 1039–89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Seth Litwin, "Not featherbedding, but feathering the nest: Human resource management and investments in information technology." ''Industrial Relations: A Journal of Economy and Society'' 52.1 (2013): 23. "However, from a labor economist’s perspective, employment relations structures and processes were simply spreading the cost associated with technological change by constraining the degree to and the speed with which capital-labor ratios could be adjusted."&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent political analyses of featherbedding have concluded that featherbedding is not necessarily economically optimal, but is better than other forms of bargaining. Under this analysis, the best form of collective bargaining would be one in which the union and employer bargain not only over wages but the level of employment. Most unions in the United States, for example, bargain solely over wages. Bargaining over work rules (featherbedding) as well as wages achieves outcomes close to those reached by bargaining solely over wages, but is better than bargaining over wages alone.&lt;ref&gt;George E. Johnson, "Work Rules, Featherbedding, and Pareto-Optimal Union Management Bargaining," ''Journal of Labor Economics,'' 8:1 (Part 2, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-economic perspectives==
Legal scholars and certain social theorists argue that featherbedding may be an expression of the concept of a job as a [[property]] right. These analysts argue that while the owner or employer has the "right" to extract profit because of his or her investment of capital, so the worker has the "right" to extract profit because of his or her investment of labor. Featherbedding, it is argued, arises and becomes a significant problem in places where the job property right is not part of the legal regime and remains unprotected (such as the United States).&lt;ref name="Gomberg" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald L. Martin, "Job Property Rights and Job Defections," ''Journal of Law and Economics,'' 15:2 (October 1972); P.J. White, "Unfair Dismissal Legislation and Property Rights: Some Reflections," ''Industrial Relations Journal,'' 16:4 (December 1985); Ellen Dannin, "Why At-Will Employment Is Bad For Employers and Just Cause Is Good For Them," ''Labor Law Journal,'' 58:5 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Seizing on economists' emphasis on power in the workplace, other social theorists conclude that featherbedding is a result of weak labor unions and unenforced and unprotected worker rights.  Under this analysis, featherbedding is a response by unions to their weakness, not strength.
{{quote|The literature is replete with "featherbedding" or "restrictive" rules that are hard to justify. Yet, before using these examples to condemn work rules as such, one has to be clear as to what the reasons are behind the restrictions. Why, for example, have unions resorted to job control devices, such as rules of demarcation and jurisdiction or seniority rules that sometimes conflict with flexibility? Frequently one finds that these rules originate in serious problems of employment insecurity or grave deficiencies in the security or recognition of trade unions.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Sengenberger, ''The Role of Labour Standards in Industrial Restructuring: Participation, Protection and Promotion,'' International Institute for Labour Studies, International Labour Organization, 1990. {{ISBN|92-9014-482-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Improved workplace employment rights, improved economic policies and less antagonistic labor-management relations, it is argued,{{Who|date=June 2010}} would reduce featherbedding.{{cite needed|date=June 2010}}

Others see certain kinds of featherbedding as a corrective for market failures.  For example, the delivery of social services is often not quantifiable except in the extreme. When the market is unable to quantify a good or service, the market will fail to accurately price it.{{cite needed|date=June 2010}} Market failure results.{{Or|date=June 2010}} In complex organizations, or in those whose inputs and outputs are difficult to quantify, it becomes increasingly difficult to determine what constitutes featherbedding.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Perrow, ''Complex Organizations: A Critical Essay,'' Scott, Foresman &amp; Co., 1979. {{ISBN|0-673-15205-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, defining "quality health care" is problematic,&lt;ref&gt;Evert Reerink, "Defining Quality of Care: Mission Impossible?", ''International Journal for Quality in Health Care,'' 2 (1990); Rick L. Nevers, "Defining Quality Is Difficult, But Necessary," ''Healthcare Financial Management,'' February 1993; Philip Caper, "Defining Quality in Medical Care," ''Health Affairs,'' Spring 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; as is defining a "quality education".&lt;ref&gt;Hans F. Crombag, "On Defining Quality of Education," ''Journal Higher Education,'' 7:4 (November 1978); Alisa Belzer, ed., ''Toward Defining and Improving Quality in Adult Basic Education: Issues and Challenges,'' 1st ed., Lawrence Erlbaum, 2007. {{ISBN|0-8058-5545-9}}; Eric A. Hanushek, John F. Kain, Daniel M. O'Brien, and Steven G. Rivkin, ''The Market for Teacher Quality,'' NBER Working Paper No. 11154, National Bureau of Economic Research, August 2005; Dan Goldhaber and Emily Anthony, ''Can Teacher Quality be Effectively Assessed?", The Urban Institute, April 2004; Jeannie Oakes, Megan Loef Franke, Karen Hunter Quartz, and John Rogers, "Research for High-Quality Urban Teaching: Defining It, Developing It, Assessing It," ''Journal of Teacher Education,'' 53:3 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; In such situations, frontline professional workers place heavy emphasis on work rules and minimums.  Many white-collar professionals (in particular those such as nurses and teachers) and highly skilled craft workers place heavy emphasis on staffing minimums, for example, as a means of ensuring a "high quality" outcome.&lt;ref&gt;"Nurses and hospitals are increasingly agreeing that various departments have a minimum number of nurses, and teachers' contracts are specifying maximum class sizes, in effect guaranteeing that school districts have a minimum number of teachers for the student population." Steven Greenhouse, "Big Audience Guaranteed For This Labor Dispute," ''New York Times,'' March 9, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; While some argue that this is an exercise in the professional judgment of such workers,&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Cleland, "The Professional Model," ''American Journal of Nursing,'' 75:2 (February 1975); David Lewin and Bruce Kaufman, eds., ''New Research on Labor Relations and the Performance of University HR/IR Programs,'' 1st ed., JAI Press, 2000. {{ISBN|0-7623-0750-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; others call this featherbedding and point to the low level of evidence that such rules improve outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Jess B. Weiss, "Perspectives: An Anesthesiologist," ''Health Affairs,'' Fall 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International perspectives==
===Brazil===
In [[Brazil]], featherbedding is considered endemic in government-owned and private-sector industries. Some analysts argue that featherbedding is a reaction to economic insecurity, and helps stabilize the national economy by spreading wealth.&lt;ref&gt;M. Delal Baer, "Profiles in Transition in Latin America and the Caribbean," ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,'' 526 (March 1993); William F. Maloney, "Informality Revisited," ''World Development,'' 32:7 (July 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In [[France]], featherbedding was encouraged by the nationalized rail transportation system after World War Two with a view to keeping down the unemployment rate. This was in addition to railway express rates being kept very low. The railroad ran at a huge deficit as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ted Morgan (writer)|De Gramont, Sanche]], ''The French, Portrait of a People'', G. P. Putman's Sons, New York, 1969, p. 440&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
In post-[[World War II|war]] [[Japan]], featherbedding is uncommon. A [[post-war consensus]] emerged among labor unions that featherbedding was not in the best interest of workers, and unions in Japan have tended to avoid the practice. A heavy government emphasis on [[full employment]] and a strong [[social safety net]] helped reinforce this consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. DiLorenzo, "Japanese Labor Relations: Are There Lessons for the U.S.?", ''Journal Journal of Labor Research,'' 11:3 (September, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
There are no national, regional, or local statutes or regulations governing labor unions in [[Sweden]]. Sweden has no national bureau or agency overseeing or regulating labor relations, and no agency monitors or regulates internal trade union matters. Nevertheless, despite relatively close relationships between employers and unions, featherbedding is almost unknown in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Reinhold Fahlbeck, ''Trade Unionism in Sweden,'' International Institute for Labour Studies, International Labour Organization, 1999. {{ISBN|92-9014-617-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, featherbedding is also referred to as "overmanning".&lt;ref&gt;George E. Johnson, "Work Rules, Featherbedding, and Pareto-Optimal Union-Management Bargaining," ''Journal of Labor Economics,'' 8:1 (Part 2; January 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the U.S., the [[Taft-Hartley Act]] defines and outlaws featherbedding.&lt;ref&gt;"Featherbedding and Taft-Hartley," ''Columbia Law Review,'' 52:8 (December 1952).&lt;/ref&gt; However, as previously noted, the U.S. Supreme Court has narrowly defined featherbedding, leaving most practices undisturbed.

RigneyDolphin's annual turnover in 2006 was €20.2&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="sbp-expansion" /&gt;

In 2007 a new RigneyDolphin call center was opened in Waterford by the then [[Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation|Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment]] [[Micheál Martin]].&lt;ref name="sbp-expansion" /&gt; It cost €5&amp;nbsp;million and can accommodate 400 people.&lt;ref name="indo-jobs"&gt;{{Cite news

In December 2010 RigneyDolphin opened a 300 seat call centre in Derry. The company received £1.2m from [[Invest Northern Ireland]] to fund the new centre. The new call centre, and its potential for employment, received praise from [[Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment]] minister [[Arlene Foster]] and [[Martina Anderson]] of [[Sinn Féin]].&lt;ref name="bbc-derry1" /&gt;

In February 2012 [[Taoiseach]] [[Enda Kenny]] announced that RigneyDolphin would provide patient management, patient outreach and telephone services to the [[Cleveland Clinic]].&lt;ref name="it-cleveland-jobs"&gt;{{Cite news

In July 2010 the [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health and Children]] [[Mary Harney]] announced that Dolphin would assume the role of Chairman of the [[Health Service Executive]] with effect from 15 August 2010.&lt;ref name="dohc-chairman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="it-hse-chairman" /&gt; Dolphin stepped down from this role in December 2011.&lt;ref name="dohc-review"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.dohc.ie/press/releases/2012/20120316.html |title=Announcement of the composition of the Review Group into the National Paediatric Hospital |publisher=Department of Health and Children |date=16 March 2012 |accessdate=20 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203160302/http://www.dohc.ie/press/releases/2012/20120316.html |archivedate=3 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012 Dolphin was chosen to lead the review group for the construction of [[new children's hospital (Dublin)|a new children's hospital]], following the refusal by [[An Bord Pleanála]] to give planning permission for the proposed Children's Hospital of Ireland at a site on Eccles Street.&lt;ref name="dohc-review" /&gt; [[Enda Kenny]] stated that the report this group put forward (the "Dolphin Report") would be the only one used to decide on the location of the proposed hospital.&lt;ref name="it-only-dolphin-report"&gt;{{Cite news

[[File:His Highness the Khan of Kalat and Sons.jpg|thumbnail|His Highness the Khan of Kalat and Sons, by Fred Bremner.]]
'''Fred Bremner''' (1863–1941&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Collection: Fred Bremner (Scottish, 1863 - 1941) |publisher=National Galleries Scotland |url=http://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/artists-a-z/B/4558/artist_name/Fred%20Bremner/page/20}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a Scottish photographer. His portraiture work in [[British India]], spanning 1882 to 1922, preserves a record of life in the period.

==Biography==
Bremner was born in 1863 in [[Aberchirder]] (also known as Foggylone) in [[Scotland]] and was one of several sons of a photographer in [[Banff, Scotland|Banff]]. He left school at the age of thirteen to join his father's studio and worked there for six years. In 1882, Bremner accepted an offer of work from his brother-in-law [[G. W. Lawrie]], who ran a successful photography business in [[Lucknow]], and he was assigned work throughout northern India (modern India and Pakistan).&lt;ref name="sharma"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhushan Sharma|first1=Brij|title=Fred Bremner's Indian years|journal=History of Photography|date=October 1989|volume=13|issue=4|pages=293–301|doi=10.1080/03087298.1989.10441003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889, Bremner established his own photographic studio in [[Karachi]], and successively studios in [[Quetta]], [[Lahore]] and [[Rawalpindi]]. He travelled great distances to rarely photographed areas, and his work therefore captures a scarce record of rural life, landscapes and people in late 19th and early 20th century India (his work spans 1882 to 1922).&lt;ref name=SNPG&gt;{{cite web|title=Lucknow to Lahore {{!}} Fred Bremner’s Vision of India|url=http://www.nationalgalleries.org/whatson/exhibitions/lucknow-to-lahore#.UG_VDI5fXHQ|work=[[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]]|publisher=[[National Galleries of Scotland]]|accessdate=6 October 2012|location=Edinburgh|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular interest to military historians are Bremner's photographic studies of British and Indian Army units on station in the North West Frontier region of India (now Pakistan) during the late 1800s. These studies are distinguished by the quality of the plates, which preserve in detail the faces, equipment, uniforms and living conditions of a battalion of the line from this period. Photographed on location with the troops and then sold to order, these books are now extremely rare with very few copies available for public viewing. In particular, the exceptionally rare fine photographic (Collotype Prints) work of the 1st Battalion Wessex Regiment (Late 44th FOOT), Quetta Baluchistan, 1911.

A set of '''heads of agreement''', '''heads of terms''' or '''letter of intent''' is a non-binding document outlining the main issues relevant to a tentative (partnership or other) agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Website Investopedia (24 Jan 2008)  http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/headsofagreement.asp&lt;/ref&gt; A heads of agreement document will only be [[enforceable]] when it is adopted into a [[parent contract]] and subsequently agreed upon, unless otherwise stated. Until that point, a heads of agreement will not be [[legally binding]] (See ''[[Fletcher Challenge Energy Ltd v Electricity Corp of New Zealand Ltd]]'' [2002] 2 NZLR 433).

However, such documents can be legally binding if the agreement document contains terms or language that expressly indicates the binding intention. Equally, a letter which contains no express indication of whether its terms were intended to be binding, can be found to be binding due to language used. (See ''[[RTS Flexible Systems Ltd v Molkerei Alois Müller GmbH &amp; Co KG]]'' [2008]) This is also dependant on the circumstances of the transaction and includes the conduct of the parties themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Letters of intent and heads of terms – binding or not binding? (October 31 2008) https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=5436baf1-6e41-4b30-a560-cb36f9f384a7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court (UK) Judgement of RTS Flexible Systems v Molkerei Alois Muller GmbH (March 10 2010) https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2009-0048-judgment.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial property transaction ==

In a [[commercial property]] transaction in the UK, a heads of agreement is often known as the '''heads of terms''' ('''HOTS'''). The main purpose of the heads of terms is to identify and highlight the requirements of both the seller and the purchaser of the property. There are a number of advantages of using the heads of terms. For instance, by carrying this out, both parties will fully understand what they are subject to, and reduce or abolish any misunderstandings from either party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.movehut.co.uk/commercial-property-guides/commercial-property-buyers-guide/buying-a-commercial-property-drafting-a-heads-of-terms-hots|title=MOVEHUT Commercial Property Guides: Drafting Heads of Terms}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heads of terms normally contains the following information:
* Details of the property seller
* Details of the property purchaser
* Address of the commercial property
* Details of the commercial property
* The purchase price both parties have agreed to
* The payment information
* Any special conditions
* Transaction completion date

[[File:Eindhovenvanabbe06.jpg|thumb|[[Van Abbemuseum]] in [[Eindhoven]]]]
'''Henri Jacob van Abbe''' ({{IPA-nl|ɦɑ̃ːˈri ˈjaːkɔp fɑn ˈɑbə}};&lt;ref&gt;In isolation, ''van'' is pronounced {{IPA-nl|vɑn|}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 8 January 1880 – 18 November 1940) was a Dutch tobacco industrialist and art collector. He is the founder of the [[Van Abbemuseum]] in [[Eindhoven]].

== Life ==
Henri Jacob van Abbe was born on 8 January 1880 in [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]].

He was a cigar manufacturer in [[Eindhoven]], and in 1900 he started a small cigar factory in Amsterdam which grew into a prosperous business. An avid art collector and lover of art, he founded the [[Van Abbemuseum]] in Eindhoven in 1936, which he gave a major donation to.&lt;ref name="Bevolo2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bevolo|first=Marco|title=The Golden Crossroads: Multidisciplinary Findings for Business Success from the Worlds of Fine Arts, Design and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gb7i4KY0vg0C&amp;pg=PA123|date=9 October 2009|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-25069-7|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lorente|first=Jesús Pedro|title=The Museums of Contemporary Art: Notion and Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQp64nNTWxAC&amp;pg=PA100|year=2011|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9781409405863|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Monterrey]] is one of the most important and wealthiest cities in [[Mexico]]. Being the third largest metropolitan area in Mexico, Monterrey serves as a commercial center of the north of the country. Its huge commercial centers and industries are consequences of its big industrialization after the end of the Second French Intervention War (1861 – 1867). Before this event happened, Monterrey served as a distribution center of imported goods to the north of the country. 

The industrial and economic development of the state came in several phases, starting at the end of the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|Second French Intervention]], followed by the development of the industry in the state, and the boom of industrialization before the [[Mexican Revolution]]. These three phases dictated the industrial path of Monterrey, each one of them having its own consequences in this process.

During the year of 1867, several important changes initiated in the city of Monterrey starting its industrialization: the falling of the commerce in the city, the development of communications, the development of agriculture, development of new industries, and other several changes. Monterrey changed from a distribution center of imported goods to an industrial state in a period of two decades.

== Beginning of Monterrey's Economy ==
Monterrey’s economy started to develop when, in 1820, the Refugio port, in [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]], was opened. Following this port, the port of [[Tampico]], in 1823, was opened for the city. Both of these ports where important for the economy of the city, thanks to its geographical situation. Monterrey was the only natural path to the center of the country between the mountain range system Sierra Madre Occidental. Due to this, Monterrey was the center of distribution for the states in the north of Mexico: Coahuila, Zacatecas, Durango, Chihuahua, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bibliotecadigital.ilce.edu.mx/sites/estados/libros/nleon/html/nuevoleon.html|title=Breve Historia de los Estados de la República Mexicana/Nuevo León|website=bibliotecadigital.ilce.edu.mx|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:American Civil War Montage 2.jpg|thumb|American Civil War (12 of April 1861 – 13 of May 1865)]]

=== American Civil War ===
Another important event for the development of the economy in Monterrey was the [[American Civil War]]. During the civil war, the ports of [[United States]] were blocked, causing the use of the ports of the north part of Mexico for the distribution of cotton to [[Europe]]. These ports where controlled by the Monterrey’s customs, allowing an important capital flow into the city. Even though this brought positive consequences in Monterrey’s economy, after the end of the [[American Civil War]], the traffic from the United Stated stopped, affecting the city’s commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Los orígenes de la industrialización en Monterrey (1867-1920)|last=Vizcaya|first=Isidro|publisher=Librería Tecnológico|year=1972|isbn=|location=|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Falling of the commerce ===
The early development of the city economy was caused by several abnormal events. For example, constant revolutions in the country, establishment of the free zone in the neighbor state Tamaulipas, and the American Civil War. These abnormal events created a constant development on Monterrey’s economy. After these events stopped, an inevitable decrease in the city’s economy started. Some researches stated that the city could not get again in the same position that was during the city economy development, because it was caused by the abnormal events mentioned before. Despite of this, there exist other two main reasons why the commerce in Monterrey started to decrease: the creation of the “Constraresguardos” and the development of railways in the country.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Los orígenes de la industrialización en Monterrey (1867-1920)|last=Viscaya|first=Isidro|publisher=Librería Tecnológico|year=1972|isbn=|location=|pages=25-34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the reasons was the creation of the mobile force “Contraresguardo”. This was a mobile force that was in charge of traveling along far paths and roads to stop clandestine imports. Smuggling was an important economic activity in many towns of Monterrey bringing capital flow into several commerce. The creation of this anti-smuggling force caused the decrease of the activity, affecting the economy of many families and commerce in [[Monterrey]]. The anti-smuggling forces raised important amounts of money from the smugglings that were stopped: during the year 1869-1870 where stopped several contrabands with a value of $213,415 pesos, in the next year this value increased by $844,542, and during the years 1874-1875 a total of 148 contraband were stopped by these forces. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another important factor for the decrease in commerce in Monterrey was the development of railways in the country. Before this development, Monterrey served as a distribution center for the north states of the country, thanks to its geographical position. The development of railways caused that the north states of the country could get products from other routes, without the intervention of Monterrey. Also, the railways created contrabands in small scale, people where allowed to go to the frontier easily and in a cheap way, smuggling products. The small-scale contraband affected all kind of commerce in Monterrey, didn’t letting them develop. 

=== Communications Development ===
An important factor in Monterrey’s industrialization was the development of communications throughout the state. The development of railways, telegraphs, telephones and trams started a new chapter in Monterrey’s transportation and communication era, leaving behind the mule drivers, drivers, and diligence drivers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Los orígenes de la industrialización en Monterrey (1867-1920)|last=Vizcaya|first=Isidro|publisher=Librería Tecnológico|year=1972|isbn=|location=|pages=14-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before this new era, the opening of routes was an important topic for the government. Monterrey had several routes that connected it with other neighbor states like [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]], Laredo, Tampico, Piedras Negras, Saltillo, etc. These routes where controlled and managed by the municipalities, who didn’t take care of them, leaving them in bad shape. Even though, the traffic between this dirt routes were high. The most common mean of transport to transport products, before the development of railways, was by convoys: groups of wagons pulled by mules. Also, the most common way of transporting people between states before the railway, was by the use of errands. 

==== Railways ====
The first railway track was inaugurated in 1881, it connected the cities of Monterrey and Matamoros. Other railways were also created to connect Monterrey to other cities in this new mean of transport: Laredo, Saltillo, Lampazos, Salinas Victoria, Cadereyta, Torreon, [[San Luis Potosí|San Luis Potosi]], Mexico, and also with the United States. These new routes of railway boost the movement of large group of people around the state and country in a cheap and effective way. These new railways also helped to present the city of Monterrey in a national and international context. People from outside the city came, especially from the United States, for vacations or business trips.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Telegraph ====
The telegraph was the one of the first communication development in the city, before the railways. The first line of telegraph was built 12 years before the first railway track in the city. The telegraph created a communication line between Monterrey and the center of Mexico. Also, the cities of Matamoros, Saltillo, San Luis Potosi, Ciudad Victoria, Nuevo Laredo, etc. These new lines of telegraph communications followed almost the same lines as the routes of railways.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Trams ====
One of the first urban transportation mean was the trams. The first tram was built in 1882 by the government of the state. Later, permissions to build more tram routes around the city were delivered to private companies. By the year of 1891, most of the trams lines were managed by four private companies who had a total of 40 kilometers of tram lines, 58 wagons and 17 loading platforms. All of these track lines connected the urban and rural zones of Monterrey.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Telephone ====
In 1882, the telephone was installed in the city of Monterrey. The purpose of the first line of telephones was for the use of the government, connecting the house of General Treviño with the headquarters in the city. The use of telephones for public purposes was established in 1883. By the next year, it already had 91 subscriptions, 256 telephone devices, and 300 kilometers of telephone line. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Agriculture ===
[[File:Caña de Azucar.jpg|thumb|Sugar Cane]]
Before the industrialization of Monterrey, agriculture and cattle raising were the most important economic activities of the city. Monterrey was an exporting city, exporting to the rest of the country corn and sugar cane. Even though corn was the most agricultural product produced in the city, sugar can was the most profitable. Piloncillo was a very profitable product and it was extracted from the sugar cane. Monterrey was one of the most important cities that exported this product to the country. Also, cattle raising was an important activity for the city, but throughout the years, it was being substituted by the agriculture. This decrease in cattle production was also caused by other factor besides the growing agricultural activity in the city. It was caused also by the cattle theft, attacks of barbarian Indians to the farms, revolutions through the state and droughts. In the year of 1890, the rural activities of the city were in development, having an increase in agricultural and cattle raising production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Los orígenes de la industrialización en Monterrey (1867-1920)|last=Vizcaya|first=Isidro|publisher=Librería Tecnológico|year=1972|isbn=|location=|pages=34-36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development of new industries in Monterrey ===
Before the fall of commerce in Monterrey, huge amount of capital flowed into the city. This gave a lot of economic resources to families and business men of the region. After the fall of commerce in the city, this families and business men started to look for new industries in which they could invest their resources. The industries that were developed by these investments where in the areas of mining, railways and customs, textiles, and livestock companies. After these investments, the industrialization of Monterrey was initiated.

The textile industry was one of the first industries developed in Monterrey. The first textile companies were called “La Fama”, which was founded in 1854 by an investment group, and “El Porvenir”, founded in 1871. After this two companies were founded, more little textile industries were created in the region, causing that the textile industry was an important activity for the city of Monterrey after several years. 

Other new industries that were founded in Monterrey during the same period were little workshops and handcrafts. The main objective of the workshops was to create tools for agricultural purposes, creating wheat mills, floats, and other agricultural tools. Other new industries developed were hat, ice, floats and cars, sugar and mezcal, beer, pasta, starch, candles production. These small industries became the beginning of the industrialization of Monterrey.

All these new industries that were developed started to change the way of thinking of the government, businesses and people in Monterrey. The idea that the industrialization of the city was the solution for the future of the state was starting to appear. The government and business started to foment the industrialization in all the aspects of the economy. An important tool to expand this ideas through the state and to present Monterrey’s product to the country and internationally was by the use of expositions. In these expositions, products were presented din four different categories: industry, labor, mechanical arts and arts. All these expositions helped the community to get to know all the products that where produce in Monterrey and the innovations on them. The products of Monterrey reached exposition in United States like the exposition of New Orleans in 1885, Paris in 1889 and San Antonio in 1889. These expositions were an important platform for the world to get to know Monterrey as an industrial center.

== Industrialization of Monterrey ==
In 1889, the first important industries for the industrialization were founded: Fabrica de Cerveza y Hielo de Monterrey and Fundicion de Fierro y Elaboracion de Maquinaria Monterrey. The first industry was in beer production and the second was in melting industry. The foundation of these two industries in Monterrey, caused a wave of concessions for the foundation of new industries in the city. Many industries were founded in the next several years, covering diverse areas of industries: furniture, metal, clothe, cigarettes, soap, among others. In a period of 3 years, 14 new industries were founded in Monterrey.

=== Causes of industrialization ===
[[File:Mexico, its ancient and modern civilisation, history and political conditions, topography and natural resources, industries and general development; (1910) (14798653633).jpg|thumb|311x311px|Monterrey, 1910]]
This boom in the industrialization of Monterrey was caused by internal and external factors of the city. The internal factors are the ones that involves the own citizens and business of Monterrey. In the other hand, the external factor are the ones that involves everything that influenced Monterrey from the outside of its borders. These factors had an important role in the development of the industry in Monterrey.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Los orígenes de la industrialización en Monterrey (1867-1920)|last=Vizcaya|first=Isidro|publisher=Librería Tecnológico|year=1972|isbn=|location=|pages=73-81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== External factors ====
One of the external factors was the high tariffs of the United State government high sales rates on metals. These high rates caused that metal industries were founded in Monterrey, avoiding these high costs. Monterrey had an advantage over other cities that also were affected by these high rates in United States, it was connected with several important mining centers of the country, reducing the cost of transporting the coal needed for the mining industry.

Another important external factor in Monterrey’s industrialization was the international investment in the city. Most of the businessman or companies that invested in new industries in the city were from outside of Mexico. The brought important amounts of capital into the city, leading them into a favorable position to its citizens and government for future development.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Internal factors ====
[[File:Monterrey entre el Obispado y el Cerro de la Silla 1904.jpg|thumb|315x315px|Monterrey, 1904]]
One important factor was the government position towards the foundation of new industries in the city. The government in Monterrey reduced taxes and borrow land to business or persons who wanted to create new industries in the city, creating a friendly environment to entrepreneurs. This environment could not be performed without the important amounts of capital that were created during the early stages of commerce in the city. The huge amount of economic resources that some citizens and business in Monterrey had available for investments were a key factor on the industrialization. Also, another important factor in this phase, was the huge amount of skilled craftsmen. These craftsmen were important to the industries, who contract them because they knew how to use machines and work in the production of products. 

One important factor was Monterrey’s geographical position towards United States. Monterrey is the nearest important city of Mexico to the frontier and industrial area of United States. This closeness also let Monterrey’s citizens to go to the United States to study or work in the neighbor country, bringing new ideas and process to the industrial sector of Monterrey.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Industrial Expansion ==
[[File:Cervecería Cuauhtemoc Monterrey 1890.jpg|thumb|268x268px|Cerveceria Cuauhtemoc, 1890]]
Monterrey’s industrialization continued another 20 years and stopped during the Mexican Revolution. During these 20 years, the industries in the city continued to develop and to grow. The most important and more developed industries during this interval of time were: 

* Metal Plants (Nuevo Leon Smelting and Manufacturing Company Limited, Compañia Minera, Fundidora y Afinadora Monterrey, La Gran Fundacion Nacional Mexicana)
* Cerveceria Cuauhtemoc
* Fundidora de Fierro y Acero
* Glass Industry (Fábrica de Vidrios y Cristales, S.A.)
* Cementos Hidalgo
* Industry for construction materials.
* Textile industry 

[[File:Fundidora de Monterrey.jpg|thumb|280x280px|Fundidora de Fierro y Acero, 1920]]
This industrialization raised again the commerce in the city, creating new commerce and investments in Monterrey, causing a increment in the capital flow to the city and its businesses. The population in Monterrey also increased thanks to its industrialization and commerce attraction, catching the attention of businessmen and families from other states. This industrialization brought more development in Monterrey urbanization, lifestyle and education, beneficiating its citizens, industries and commerce.

{{Business administration}}
'''International business''' refers to the trade of [[Goods and services|goods, services,]] technology, capital and/or knowledge across [[national borders]] and at a global level. 

It involves cross-border [[Financial transaction|transactions]] of goods and services between two or more countries. Transactions of economic resources include capital, skills, and people for the purpose of the international production of physical goods and services such as finance, banking, insurance, and construction. International business is also known as [[globalization]].

To conduct business overseas, multinational companies need to bridge separate national [[Market (economics)|markets]] into one global marketplace. There are two macro-scale factors that underline the trend of greater globalization. The first consists of eliminating [[Trade barrier|barriers]] to make cross-border trade easier (e.g. free flow of goods and services, and capital, referred to as "[[free trade]]"). The second is technological change, particularly developments in communication, [[information processing]], and [[Freight transport|transportation]] technologies.

== Overview ==
"International business" is also defined as the study of the internationalization process of multinational enterprises. A [[multinational enterprise]] (MNE) is a company that has a worldwide approach to markets, production and/or operations in several countries. Well-known MNEs include fast-food companies such as: McDonald's (MCD), YUM (YUM), Starbucks Coffee Company (SBUX), Microsoft (MSFT), etc. Other industrial MNEs leaders include vehicle manufacturers such as: Ford Motor Company, and General Motors (GMC). Some consumer electronics producers such as Samsung, LG and Sony, and energy companies such as Exxon Mobil, and British Petroleum (BP) are also multinational enterprises. 

Multinational enterprises range from any kind of business activity or market, from consumer goods to machinery manufacture; a company can become an international business. Therefore, to conduct business overseas, companies should be aware of all the factors that might affect any business activities, including, but not limited to: difference in legal systems, political systems, [[economic policy]], [[language barrier|language]], [[Accounting standard|accounting standards]], [[International labour law|labor standards]], living standards, [[environmental standard]]s, [[culture|local culture]]s, [[Organizational culture|corporate cultures]], [[Foreign exchange market|foreign-exchange markets]], [[tariff]]s, [[import]] and [[export]] regulations, [[Trade agreement|trade agreements]], [[climate]], and [[education]]. Each of these factors may require changes in how companies operate from one country to another. Each factor makes a difference and a connection.

One of the first scholars to engage in developing a theory of multinational companies was Canadian economist [[Stephen Hymer]].&lt;ref&gt;Buckley P.J. (2010) Stephen Hymer: Three Phases, One Approach?. In: Foreign Direct Investment, China and the World Economy. Palgrave Macmillan, London&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his academic life, he developed theories that sought to explain [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) and why firms become multinational.

There were three phases of [[internationalization]] according to Hymer's work. The first phase of Hymer's work was his dissertation in 1960 called the ''[https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/27375 International Operations of National Firms]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hymer|first=Stephen H.|date=1960|others=Charles P. Kindleberger., Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dept. of Economics|title=The international operations of national firms, a study of direct foreign investment|url=https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/27375|journal=|language=en-US|volume=|pages=|via=DSpace@MIT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this thesis, the author departs from [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical theory]] and opens up a new area of international production. At first, Hymer started analyzing neoclassical theory and [[financial investment]], where the main reason for [[capital movement]] is the [[Interest rate parity|difference in interest rates]]. After this analysis, Hymer analyzed the characteristics of foreign investment by large companies for [[Production (economics)|production]] and direct business purposes, calling this Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). By analyzing the two types of investments, Hymer distinguished financial investment from direct investment. The main distinguishing feature was control. [[Portfolio investment]] is a more passive approach, and the main purpose is [[Profit (economics)|financial gain]], whereas in foreign direct investment a firm has control over the [[Operations management|operations]] abroad. So, the traditional theory of investment based on differential interest rates does not explain the motivations for FDI.

According to Hymer, there are two main determinants of FDI; where an [[imperfect market]] structure is the key element. The first is the [[Competitive advantage|firm-specific advantages]] which are developed at the specific companies home country and, profitably, used in the foreign country. The second determinant is the removal of control where Hymer wrote: "When firms are interconnected, they [[Competition (economics)|compete]] in selling in the same market or one of the firms may sell to the other," and because of this "it may be profitable to substitute centralized decision-making for [[decentralized decision-making]]".

Hymer's second phase is his neoclassical article in 1968 that includes a theory of internationalization and explains the direction of growth of the international expansion of firms. In a later stage, Hymer went to a more [[Marxian economics|Marxist]] approach where he explains that MNC as agents of an international capitalist system causing conflict and contradictions, causing among other things [[Economic inequality|inequality]] and [[poverty]] in the world. Hymer is the "father of the theory of MNEs", and explains the motivations for companies doing direct business abroad.

Among modern economic theories of multinationals and foreign direct investment are [[internalization theory]] and [[John Harry Dunning|John Dunning's]] [[Eclectic paradigm|OLI paradigm]] (standing for ''ownership, location and internationalization''). Dunning was widely known for his research in economics of international direct investment and the multinational enterprise. His OLI paradigm, in particular, remains as the predominant theoretical contribution to study international business topics. Hymer and Dunning are considered [[Founder (disambiguation)|founders]] of international business as a specialist [[field of study]].

==Physical and social factors of competitive business and social environment==
The conduct of international operations depends on a company's objectives and the means with which they carry them out. The operations affect and are affected by the physical and societal factors and the [[competitive]] [[social environment|environment]].

===Operations===
All firms that want to go international have one goal in common; the desire to increase their respective [[Economic value added|economic values]] when engaging in international trade transactions. To accomplish this goal, each firm must develop its individual strategy and approach to maximize [[Value (economics)|value]], lower costs, and increase profits.  A firm's value creation is the difference between {{Math|''V''}} (the value of the product being sold) and {{Math|''C''}} (the cost of production per each product sold).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W. L.|title=International Business:  Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston|isbn=007811277X|page=382|edition=10|url=https://bookshelf.vitalsource.com/#/books/007811277X|accessdate=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Value creation]] can be categorized as: ''primary activities'' ([[research and development]], production, marketing and sales, [[customer service]]) and as ''support activities'' (information systems, logistics, human resources).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W. L.|title=International Business:  Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston|isbn=007811277X|page=383|edition=10|url=https://bookshelf.vitalsource.com/#/books/007811277X|accessdate=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these activities must be managed effectively and be consistent with the [[Corporate strategy|firm strategy]]. However, the success of firms that extend internationally depends on the goods or services sold and on the firm's core competencies (Skills within the firm that competitors cannot easily match or imitate). For a firm to be successful, the firm's strategy must be consistent with the environment in which the firm operates. Therefore, the firm needs to change its [[organizational structure]] to reflect changes in the setting in which they are operating and the strategy they are pursuing.

Once a firm decides to enter a foreign market, it must decide on a mode of entry. There are six different modes to enter a foreign market, and each mode has [[wiktionary:pros and cons|pros and cons]] that are associated with it. The firm must decide which mode is most appropriately aligned with the company's goals and objectives.  The six different modes of entry are exporting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/export.asp|title=Export|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2003-11-19|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[turnkey project]]s, [[License|licensing]], [[franchising]], establishing [[joint venture]]s with a host-country firm, or setting up a new [[wholly owned subsidiary]] in the host country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W. L.|title=International Business: Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston|isbn=007811277X|pages=453–454|edition=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first entry mode is [[exporting]]. Exporting is the sale of a product in a different national market than a centralized hub of manufacturing. In this way, a firm may realize a substantial [[Economies of scale|scale of economies]] from its global sales revenue. As an example, many [[Automotive industry in Japan|Japanese automakers]] made inroads into the [[Automotive industry in the United States|U.S. market]] through exporting.  There are two primary advantages to exporting:  avoiding high costs of establishing manufacturing in a host country (when these are higher) and gaining an [[Experience curve effects|experience curve]].  Some possible disadvantages to exporting are high transport costs and high [[Tariff|tariff barriers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W. L.|title=International Business: Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston|isbn=007811277X|page=454|edition=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second entry mode is a turnkey project. In a turnkey project, an independent contractor is hired by the company to oversee all of the preparation for entering a foreign market.  Once the preparation is complete and the end of the contract is reached, the plant is turned over to the company fully ready for operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W. L.|title=International Business: Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston|isbn=007811277X|pages=454–455|edition=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Licensing and franchising are two additional entry modes that are similar in operation. Licensing allows a [[licensor]] to grant the rights to an intangible property to the licensee for a specified period of time for a royalty fee. Franchising, on the other hand, is a specialized form of licensing in which the "franchisor" sells the [[intangible property]] to the franchisee, and also requires the franchisee operate as dictated by the franchisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W. L.|title=International Business: Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston|isbn=007811277X|pages=456–457|edition=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, a joint venture and wholly owned subsidiary are two more entry modes in international business. A ''joint venture'' is when a firm created is jointly owned by two or more companies (Most joint venture are 50-50 [[Partnership|partnerships]]). This is in contrast with a wholly owned subsidiary, when a firm owns 100 percent of the [[stock]] of a company in a foreign country because it has either set up a new operation or [[Corporate acquisition|acquires]] an established firm in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W. L.|title=International Business: Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston|isbn=007811277X|pages=457–458|edition=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Types of operations====
[[Export]]s and [[import]]s of merchandise: 
* Merchandise exports: goods exported{{Em dash}}not including services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelawdictionary.org/merchandise-exports/ What is Merchandised Exports]. The Law Dictionary. Accessed 30 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Merchandise imports: The physical good or product that is imported into the respective country. Countries import products or goods that their country lacks in. An example of this is that [[Colombia]] must import cars since there is no Colombian car company.
*[[Offshoring|Service exports]]: {{As of|2018}}, the fastest growing export sector.

The second factor is technological change, particularly the developments in communication, information processing, and transportation technologies. Usually, [[private companies]] undertake transactions for profit; governments undertake such transactions for profit and for political reasons.|authors=Daniels, John; Radebaugh, Lee H.; Sullivan, Daniel P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choice of entry mode in international business===

Strategic variables affect the choice of entry mode for [[multinational corporation]] expansion beyond their [[Domestic market|domestic markets]]. These variables are global concentration, global synergies, and global strategic motivations of MNC.
* Global concentration: many MNEs share and overlap markets with a limited number of other corporations in the same [[industry]].
* Global synergies: the reuse or sharing of resources by a corporation and may include marketing departments or other inputs that can be used in multiple markets. This includes, among other things, [[Brand awareness|brand name recognition]].
* Global strategic motivations: other factors beyond entry mode that are the basic reasons for corporate expansion into an additional market. These are strategic reasons that may include establishing a foreign outpost for expansion, developing sourcing sites among other strategic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, W. C., &amp; Hwang, P. (1992). [http://www.monman.com/global-strategy-and-multinationals-entry-mode-choice Global strategy and multinationals' entry mode choice]. Journal of International Business Studies, 23(1), 29. Accessed 30 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Means of businesses===
* Entry modes: Export/import, wholly owned subsidiary, merger or acquisition, alliances and joint ventures, licensing&lt;ref&gt;Luthans, F., Doh, J. P. (2015).  International Management: Culture, Strategy and Behavior, 9th edition. McGraw Hill. {{ISBN|0-07786244-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Modes: [[import]]ing and [[exporting]], [[tourism]] and [[transportation]], [[licensing]] and [[franchising]], [[turnkey]] operations, [[management]] [[contracts]], [[direct investment]] and [[portfolio investments]].
* Functions: [[marketing]], global [[manufacturing]] and [[supply chain management]], [[accounting]], [[finance]], [[human resources]]
* Overlaying alternatives: choice of countries, organization and [[control mechanisms]]

===Physical and social factors===
* Geographical influences: There are many different geographic factors that affect international business. These factors are: the geographical size, the [[Climate change|climatic challenges]] happening throughout the world, the [[Natural resource|natural resources]] available on a specific territory, the [[Population density|population distribution]] in a country, etc.&lt;ref name=witiger&gt;

* Social factors: Political policies: political disputes, particularly those that result in the military confrontation, can [[Economics of war|disrupt]] trade and investment.
* Legal policies: domestic and international laws play a big role in determining how a company can operate overseas.
* Behavioral factors: in a foreign environment, the related disciplines such as anthropology, psychology, and sociology are helpful for managers to get a better understanding of values, attitudes, and beliefs.
*[[Economic forces]]: economics explains country differences in costs, currency values, and market size.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Risks:===
* '''Faulty Planning'''

To achieve success in penetrating a foreign market and remaining profitable, efforts must be directed towards the planning and execution of Phase I. The use of conventional [[SWOT analysis]], [[market research]], and cultural research, will give a firm appropriate tools to reduce risk of failure abroad. Risks that arise from poor planning include: large expenses in marketing, administration and product development (with no sales); disadvantages derived from local or federal laws of a foreign country, lack of popularity because of a [[Market saturation|saturated market]], vandalism of physical property due to instability of country; etc. There are also cultural risks when entering a foreign market. Lack of research and understanding of local customs can lead to alienation of locals and brand dissociation.&lt;ref name="okolo2"&gt;Okolo, S. (n.d.). Global Business: Risks in International Business. [online] Globalpaarisite.blogspot.com.es. Available at: http://globalpaarisite.blogspot.com.es/2012/08/risks-in-international-business.html [Accessed 10 May 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; Strategic risks can be defined as the uncertainties and untapped opportunities embedded in your strategic intent and how well they are executed. As such, they are key matters for the board and impinge on the whole business, rather than just an isolated unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/advisory/consulting.html|title=Consulting|first=|last=PricewaterhouseCoopers|date=|website=PwC|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Operational risk'''
A company has to be conscious about the production costs to not waste time and money. If the expenditures and costs are controlled, it will create an efficient production and help the internationalization.&lt;ref name="okolo2"/&gt; Operational risk is the prospect of loss resulting from inadequate or failed procedures, systems or policies; employee errors, systems failure, fraud or other criminal activity, or any event that disrupts business processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchcompliance.techtarget.com/definition/operational-risk|title=What is operational risk? - Definition from WhatIs.com|author=|date=|website=techtarget.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Political risk''' 

How a government governs a country ([[governance]]) can affect the operations of a firm. The government might be [[Corruption|corrupt]], hostile, or [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]]; and may have a negative image around the globe. A firm's reputation can change if it operates in a country controlled by that type of government.&lt;ref name="okolo2"/&gt; Also, an unstable political situation can be a risk for multinational firms. [[Elections]] or any unexpected political event can change a country's situation and put a firm in an awkward position.&lt;ref name=heinsz&gt;J. Henisz, W. and A. Zelner, B. (2010). [https://hbr.org/2010/04/the-hidden-risks-in-emerging-markets|The Hidden Risks in Emerging Markets]. Harvard Business Review. Accessed 9 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Political risks are the likelihood that political forces will cause drastic changes in a country's business environment that hurt the profit and other goals of a business enterprise. Political risk tends to be greater in countries experiencing [[social unrest]]. When political risk is high, there is a high probability that a change will occur in the country's political environment that will endanger foreign firms there. Corrupt foreign governments may also [[Expropriation|take over the company without warning]], as seen in Venezuela.&lt;ref name="Charles H.L Hill"&gt;Charles H.L Hill&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Technological risk'''

Technological improvements bring many benefits, but some disadvantages as well. Some of these risks include "lack of [[Information security|security in electronic transactions]], the [[Non-recurring engineering|cost of developing new technology]] ... the fact that this new technology may fail, and, when all of these are coupled with the outdated existing technology, [the fact that] the result may create a dangerous effect in doing business in the international arena."&lt;ref name="okolo2"/&gt;
* '''Environmental risk''' 

Companies that establish a subsidiary or factory abroad need to be conscious about the externalizations they will produce, as some may have negative effects such as [[Noise pollution|noise]] or [[pollution]].  This may cause aggravation to the people living there, which in turn can lead to a conflict. People want to live in a clean and quiet environment, without pollution or unnecessary noise. If a conflict arises, this may lead to a negative change in customer's perception of the company. Actual or potential threat of adverse effects on living organisms and environment by effluents, emissions, wastes, resource depletion, etc., arising out of an organization's activities is considered to be risks of the environment. As new business leaders come to fruition in their careers, it will be increasingly important to curb business activities and externalizations that may hurt the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/environmental-risk.html|title=What is environmental risk? definition and meaning|author=|date=|website=BusinessDictionary.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Economic risk''' 
These are the economic risks explained by Professor Okolo: "This comes from the inability of a country to meet its financial obligations. The changing of foreign-investment or/and domestic fiscal or monetary policies. The effect of exchange-rate and interest rate make it difficult to conduct international business."&lt;ref name="okolo2"/&gt; Moreover, it can be a risk for a company to operate in a country and they may experience an unexpected economic crisis after establishing the subsidiary.&lt;ref name=heinsz /&gt; Economic risks is the likelihood that economic management will cause drastic changes in a country's business environment that hurt the profit and other goals of a business enterprise. In practice, the biggest problem arising from economic mismanagement has been inflation. Historically many governments have expanded their domestic money supplying misguided attempts to stimulate economic activity.&lt;ref name="Charles H.L Hill"/&gt;
* '''Financial risk'''

According to Professor Okolo: "This area is affected by the currency exchange rate, government flexibility in allowing the firms to [[Repatriation|repatriate]] profits or funds outside the country. The [[devaluation]] and inflation will also affect the firm's ability to operate at an efficient capacity and still be stable."&lt;ref name="okolo2"/&gt; Furthermore, the [[Tax|taxes]] that a company has to pay might be advantageous or not. It might be higher or lower in the host countries. Then "the risk that a government will indiscriminately change the laws, regulations, or contracts governing an investment—or will fail to [[Enforcement|enforce]] them—in a way that reduces an investor's [[Financial return|financial returns]] is what we call 'policy risk.'"&lt;ref name=heinsz /&gt;
* '''Terrorism'''

[[Terrorism]] is a voluntary act of violence towards a group(s) of people. In most cases, acts of terrorism is derived from hatred of religious, political and cultural beliefs. An example was the infamous [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], labeled as terrorism due to the [[Aftermath of the September 11 attacks|massive damages]] inflicted on [[Society of the United States|American society]] and the global economy stemming from the animosity towards [[Western culture]] by some [[Radical Islam|radical Islamic groups]]. Terrorism not only affects civilians, but it also damages corporations and other businesses. These effects may include: physical [[vandalism]] or [[destruction of property]], sales declining due to frightened consumers and governments issuing public safety restrictions. Firms engaging in international business will find it difficult to operate in a country that has an uncertain assurance of safety from these attacks.&lt;ref name="okolo2"/&gt;
* '''Bribery'''

[[Bribery]] is the act of receiving or soliciting of any items or services of value to influence the actions of a party with public or legal obligations. This is considered to an unethical form of practicing business and can have legal repercussions. Firm that want to operate legally should instruct employees to not involve themselves or the company in such activities. Companies should avoid doing business in countries where unstable forms of government exist as it could bring unfair advantages against domestic business and/or harm the social fabric of the citizens.

==Factors towards globalization==
There has been growth in [[globalization]] in recent decades due to the following factors.

{{List incomplete|date=November 2018}}

*[[Technology]] is expanding, especially in [[transportation]] and [[communications]].
*[[Governments]] are removing international business restrictions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}
*[[Institutions]] provide services to ease the conduct of international business.
*[[Consumer]]s want to know about [[Foreign trade|foreign]] [[good (economics)|goods]] and [[service (economics)|services]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}
*[[Competition]] has become more global.
*[[Political]] relationships have improved among some major [[economic]] powers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}
*[[Countries]] cooperate more on transnational issues.
*[[Cross-national cooperation and agreements]] have increased.

==Importance of international business education==
* Most companies are either [[international]] companies or [[Competition (economics)|compete]] with other international companies.
* Modes of [[Business operations|operation]] may differ from those used domestically.
* The best way of conducting business may differ by [[country]].
* An understanding helps one make better [[career]] decisions.
* An understanding helps one decide what [[Government policy|governmental policies]] to support.

Managers in international business must understand [[social science]] disciplines and how they affect different functional business fields.

To maintain and achieve successful business operations in foreign nations, persons must understand how variations in culture and traditions across nations affect business practices. This idea is known as [[cultural literacy]]. Without knowledge of a host country's culture, corporate strategizing is more difficult and error-prone when entering foreign markets compared with the home country's market and culture. This can create a "blind spot" during the decision making process and result in [[ethnocentrism]]. Education about international business introduces the student to new concepts that can be applicable in international strategy in topics such as marketing and operations.

===Importance of language and cultural studies===

A considerable advantage in international business is gained through the knowledge and use of language, thereby mitigating a [[language barrier]]. Advantages of being an international businessperson who is [[Fluency|fluent]] in the [[local language]] include the following:
*Having the ability to directly communicate with employees and customers
*Understanding the manner of speaking within business in the local area to improve overall [[productivity]]
*Gaining respect of customers and employees from speaking with them in their native tongue

In many cases, it plays a crucial role. It is truly impossible to gain an understanding of a culture's buying habits without first taking the time to understand the culture.  Examples of the benefit of understanding local culture include the following:
*Being able to provide marketing techniques that are specifically tailored to the local market
*Knowing how other businesses operate and what might or might not be social taboos 
*Understanding the time structure of an area.  Some societies are more focused on timeliness ("[[Punctuality|being on time]]") while others focus on doing business at "[[Business hours|the right time]]".
*Associating with people who do not know several languages.
*Language barriers can affect transaction costs. ''[[Linguistic distance]]'' is defined as the amount of variation one language has from another. For example, French, and Spanish are both languages derived from Latin. When evaluating dialogue in these languages, you will discover many similarities. However, languages such as English and Chinese or English and Arabic vary much more strongly and contain far fewer similarities. The [[Writing system|writing systems]] of these languages are also different. The larger the linguistic distance there, the wider language barriers to cross. These differences can reflect on transaction costs and make foreign business operations more expensive.

===Importance of studying international business===

The international business standards focus on the following:
*raising awareness of the inter-relatedness of one country's political policies and economic practices on another;
*learning to improve international business relations through appropriate communication strategies;
*understanding the global business environment—that is, the interconnections of cultural, political, legal, economic, and ethical systems;
*exploring basic concepts underlying [[international finance]], [[management]], [[marketing]], and trade relations; and
*identifying forms of business [[ownership]] and international business opportunities.
By focusing on these, students will gain a better understanding of [[Political economy]]. These are tools that would help future business people bridge the economic and political gap between countries.

There is an increasing amount of demand for business people with an education in international business. A survey conducted by Thomas Patrick from [[University of Notre Dame]] concluded that [[bachelor's degree]] and [[master's degree]] holders felt that the training received through education were very practical in the working environment. Increasingly, companies are sourcing their human resource requirement globally. For example, at [[Sony|Sony Corporation]], only fifty percent of its employees are Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS|last=|first=ASWATHAPPA|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9781259051166|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business people with an education in international business also had a significantly higher chance of being sent abroad to work under the international operations of a firm.

&lt;ref name="storgaden"&gt;[http://www.porsgrunn.folkebibl.no/bok/fck/ep/storgata-131.html#Gasmann Storgata 131], in ''Eidanger–Porsgrund'', by [[Finn Christian Knudsen|Finn C. Knudsen]] (1932). Hosted by Porsgrunn public library.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He was born in 1776 in [[Gjerpen]] as the son of attorney Niels Egidius Gasmann (1747–1811) and his wife Kirstine Schweder (1757–1785) of the wealthy Zachariassen Wesseltoft family.&lt;ref name="storgaden"/&gt;

Jens Gasmann married Bodil Zachariassen Wesseltoft (1779–1848) in 1800. The couple had two daughters and two sons. Their youngest son Niels Egidius Møller became a merchant in [[Kristiania|Christiania]], and married Simonine Møller, sister of parliament member [[Hans Eleonardus Møller]] and aunt of [[Hans Møller]].&lt;ref name="storgaden"/&gt;

From 1818 he was also [[consul (representative)|vice consul]] for Great Britain,&lt;ref name="storgaden"/&gt; the country he had helped waging war against only eight years earlier. He was later promoted to consul.

As a politician he served as a deputy representative in the [[Storting|Norwegian Parliament]] in 1824, representing the constituency of ''Skien og Porsgrund''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://samfunnsveven.no/TT/U21.cfm?Utside=&amp;Uttaksnummer=21&amp;person=10900 Jens Severin Gasmann born 1776] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202152449/http://samfunnsveven.no/TT/U21.cfm?Utside=&amp;Uttaksnummer=21&amp;person=10900 |date=2007-12-02 }} - Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1837, when local governance was introduced in Norway, Gasmann became the first deputy mayor of Porsgrund municipality.

[[Malay titles|Tan Sri Dato' Seri]] '''Lee Loy Seng''' ({{zh|t=李萊生|s=李莱生|p=Lǐ Lái Shēng}}; 22 August 1921 – 22 November 1993) was a Malaysian businessman who grew up in a small town, Ipoh.

==Biography==
His father, Lee Meng Hin, was a tin-miner who gave the then Malayan economy a boost. After Lee Meng Hin's reign, his company was passed on to one of his sons, Lee Wan Seng, and the younger Loy Seng worked just as an employee during the early years of his life.
During the [[Malayan Emergency]], many british firms and trading houses sold off their assets, including rubber plantations at very low prices. Loy Seng saw the opportunity of a lifetime to invest in these lands, subsequently turning them into rubber plantations. With luck on his side, the price of rubber was increasing immensely due to industrial rise. As he built up his fast blossoming business, Mr. Lee founded the company [[Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad]], which became and still is one of the leading plantation owning companies in [[Malaysia]].

Mr Lee was a member of [[Malaysian Chinese Association]](MCA), president of Ipoh Municipal Council in 1976, and a senator from 1971 to 1980. From 1978 to 1992, he was the president of Perak Chinese Maternity Hospital (a private non-profit hospital that gives free treatment to the poor). He was the chairman of Multi-Purpose Holdings ran into financial difficulties in the mid-1980s, he was invited by MCA to return as  a director on a board of prominent Chinese businessmen, headed by "Suger King" [[Robert Kuok|Tan Sri Sir Robert Kuok]], to restore it back to health. He was well known for his philanthropy, and established the Lee Loy Seng Foundation to provide scholarships for needy Malaysian students to pursue their tertiary education. He was also the benefactor of the Lucky Village Old Folks Home in Ipoh.&lt;ref name = "Southeast Asian Personalities of Chinese Descent"&gt;{{Cite book | author = Leo Suryadinata | title = Southeast Asian Personalities of Chinese Descent | location = Singapore | publisher = Institute of Southeast Asian Studies | date = 2012 | pages = 527–529 | ISBN = 9789814345224| accessdate = 2015-03-05 | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9789814345224 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr Lee was awarded the titles of Dato' Seri in 1974, and Tan Sri in 1987.&lt;ref name = "Southeast Asian Personalities of Chinese Descent" /&gt;

His sons Tan Sri Datuk [[Lee Oi Hian]], Datuk [[Lee Hau Hian]] and Datuk [[Lee Soon Hian]] are considered to be in the top 20 richest people in Malaysia. Lee Oi Hian and Lee Hau Hian jointly have an estimated net worth of US$1.5bil in 2015.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/lee-oi-hian-lee-hau-hian/|title = 2015 Malaysia's 50 Richest -#10 Lee Oi Hian &amp; Lee Hau Hian|accessdate=2015-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3897">A '''Licensed Professional Counselor Associate (LPCA)''' is a provisionally licensed professional counselor who has completed a master’s level counseling program, passed necessary national examinations, and is currently working toward full licensure by completing a designated amount of supervised clinical counseling hours. Other common titles for this provisional license are Licensed Associate Counselor (LAC), Licensed Associate Professional Counselor (LAPC), Limited License Professional Counselor (LLPC), and Licensed Professional Counselor – Intern (LPC-I).  Titles vary by state.&lt;ref name=ACA&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lum|first1=Christie|title=Licensure Requirements for Professional Counselors - 2010|url=http://www.counseling.org/docs/licensure/72903_excerpt_for_web.pdf?sfvrsn=2|website=American Counseling Association|publisher=American Counseling Association|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tiered Licensure==

Several states in the US have implemented a tiered licensure system for professional counselors.  These systems are either two or three tiers and provide both professional development and mentorship for new counselors, as well as added assurance for clients that they are receiving the best care possible.  In two-tier systems, an LPCA is licensed to practice under the supervision of a fully [[licensed professional counselor]] (LPC) with a sufficient amount of post-graduate counseling experience.  Once the LPCA has accrued the required number of hours (usually accomplished in about two years, depending on state regulations), they may apply to be an LPC and practice independently.&lt;ref name=NCBLPC&gt;{{cite web|title=Application Information - LPCA|url=http://www.ncblpc.org/application-info/lpca|website=North Carolina Board of Licensed Professional Counselors|publisher=NCBLPC|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a three-tier system, in addition to an LPCA and LPC, there is a separate level of licensure for supervisors (Licensed Professional Counselor Supervisor (LPCS), or equivalent title) that requires additional coursework, training, and years of experience.  In this type of system, only an LPCS may supervise an LPCA.&lt;ref name=ACA /&gt;&lt;ref name=NCBLPC /&gt;

==Educational Requirements==

For all programs accredited by [[the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs]] (CACREP), clinical mental health concentrations beginning after July 1, 2013 must require a minimum of 60 credit hours.  These 60 credit hours must include a core curriculum of 8 classes: Professional Identity, Social and Cultural Diversity, Human Growth and Development, Career Development, Helping Relationships, Group Work, Assessment, and Research and Program Evaluation.&lt;ref name=CACREP&gt;{{cite web|title=CACREP Standards|url=http://www.cacrep.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2009-Standards.pdf|website=Council of Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs|publisher=CACREP|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are additional elective requirements based on one’s specialty or concentration.  CACREP also has strict requirements regarding faculty qualifications, faculty student ratios, learning environment, evaluation and administration practices, and ethical standards, among other things.&lt;ref name=CACREP /&gt; 
In addition to academic course work, CACREP requires 100 hours of [[practicum]] experience (including 40 direct client hours) as well as 600 hours of [[internship]] experience (including at least 240 direct client hours).&lt;ref name=CACREP /&gt;

==Exams==

The most commonly required licensure exams to become a licensed professional counselor associate are the [[National Counselor Exam]] (NCE) or National Clinical Mental Health Counselor Exam (NCMHCE), though requirements vary from state to state.&lt;ref name=ACA /&gt;

'''Marvin Bower''' (August 1, 1903 – January 22, 2003) was an American business theorist and management consultant.

== Biography ==
Bower was the son of the deputy recorder at [[Cuyahoga County]], and grew up in the [[Collinwood]] neighborhood of [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and attended [[Glenville High School]].  He earned his bachelor's degree in Economics and Psychology from [[Brown University]] in 1925.  His father advised him to study law, and Bower graduated from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1928.  Bower then attended [[Harvard Business School]], graduating in 1930.  Following completion of his studies, Bower worked as an associate at [[Jones Day|Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue]] in Cleveland.

In 1933, Bower was hired by [[James O. McKinsey]] in the new [[Chicago]] firm of James O. McKinsey &amp; Company to manage a newly acquired branch in [[New York City|New York]]. Following McKinsey's death in 1937, the two offices split up and Bower resurrected the New York firm, with the assistance of New York partners, as [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] in 1939. He served as managing director from 1950 to 1967, and remained a leadership figure at McKinsey as director and partner until 1992.

According to the [[Harvard Business School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marvin Bower|url=http://www.hbs.edu/leadership/database/leaders/marvin_bower.html|publisher=Harvard Business School|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bower "is considered the father of modern [[management consulting]]." His principled insistence on impeccable professional standards in substance, ethics, and style; his dedication to the professional development of his colleagues; and his candor, all served as a role model for several generations of management consultants, both within and outside McKinsey.

Bower performed one act in the history of McKinsey &amp; Company that permanently set him and McKinsey apart from its competitors. In an era when other consultants were taking themselves public or selling out to larger companies, he sold his own shares back to the firm at book value when he turned 60, which he could easily have done at some huge multiple of earnings.

Bower's decision came as a surprise to many, including his own family. "Let me just say there was a shock on people's faces when he told us that he was selling his shares back to McKinsey at book value," said his son Dick Bower. "It felt unbelievable, to tell you the truth.  But that was Marvin for you."&lt;ref&gt;Duff McDonald. ''The Firm: The Story of McKinsey and Its Secret Influence on American Business.'' 2014. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
He published several books and articles, among them:
* ''The Will to Manage: Corporate Success Through Programmed Management'' (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1966), {{ISBN|0-07-006735-X}}
* ''The Will to Lead: Running a Business With a Network of Leaders'' (Harvard Business School Press, Boston, Mass., 1997), {{ISBN|0-87584-758-7}}
* ''Perspective on McKinsey'' - internal McKinsey publication

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5146">{{Competition law}}
In [[US antitrust law]], '''monopolization''' is an illegal and the main categories of prohibited behavior include [[exclusive dealing]], [[price discrimination]], refusing to supply an [[essential facility]], [[product tying]] and [[predatory pricing]]. Monopolization is an offense under Section 2 of the American [[Sherman Antitrust Act 1890]]. It has a specific legal meaning, which is parallel to the "abuse" of a dominant position in [[EU competition law]], under [[TFEU article 102]]. The Sherman Act 1890 §2 states that any person "who shall monopolize . . . any part of the trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations shall be deemed guilty of a [[felony]]."  Section 2 also forbids "attempts to monopolize" and "conspiracies to monopolize". Generally this means that corporations may not act in ways that have been identified as contrary to precedent cases.

==Jurisprudential meaning==
Under long-established precedent, the offense of monopolization under Section 2 has two elements.  First, that the defendant possesses [[monopoly]] power in a properly-defined [[Market (economics)|market]] and second that the defendant obtained or maintained that power through conduct deemed unlawfully exclusionary.  The mere fact that conduct disadvantages rivals does not, without more, constitute the sort of exclusionary conduct that satisfies this second element. Instead, such conduct must exclude rivals on some basis other than efficiency.

For several decades courts drew the line between efficient and inefficient exclusion by asking whether the conduct under scrutiny was "competition on the merits". Courts equated such competition on the merits with unilateral conduct such as product improvement, the realization of economies of scale, innovation, and the like.  Such conduct was lawful per se, since it constituted the normal operation of economic forces that a free economy should encourage.  At the same time, courts condemned as "unlawful exclusion" [[tying (commerce)|tying]] contracts, [[exclusive dealing]], and other agreements that disadvantaged rivals.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[United States v. United Machinery Co.]]'', 110 F. 295 (D. Mass. 1953).&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction reflected the economic theory of the time, which saw no beneficial purposes for what Professor [[Oliver Williamson]] has called non-standard contracts.

More recently, courts have retained the safe harbor&lt;ref&gt;On the evolution of safe harbors, see Thibault Schrepel, A New Structured Rule of Reason Approach for High-Tech Markets, Suffolk University Law Review, Vol. 50, No. 1, 2017 at https://ssrn.com/abstract=2908838&lt;/ref&gt; for "competition on the merits".  Moreover, the Supreme Court has clarified the standards governing claims of predatory pricing.  At the same time, they have relaxed the standards governing other conduct by monopolists.  For instance, non-standard contracts that exclude rivals are now lawful if supported by a "valid business reason", unless the plaintiff can establish that the defendant could achieve the same benefits by means of a less restrictive alternative.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc.]]'', {{ussc|504|451|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nightclub management software''' ('''NMS''') or a '''nightclub management system''' is a compiled [[management information system]] produced solely for [[night club|nightclubs]], such as the [[ministry of sound|Ministry Of Sound]], and can also be modified for [[bar (establishment)|bars]], [[arts festival|festivals]], [[Public house|pubs]], and [[concert|live events]]. These systems will commonly cover the needs of [[night club|nightclubs]] in the form of CRM, bookings, ticketing, [[point of sale|EPOS]], and administration capabilities for running the [[Music venue|venue]]. With the Nightclub industry in contraction during the period of [[great recession|recession]] during 2007-2009 many nightclubs are sourcing new avenues for marketing reach expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ibis World|title=Nightclubs in the UK: Market Research Report|url=http://www.ibisworld.co.uk/market-research/nightclubs.html|work=Market Research|date=2015-07-01|accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

Nightclub management software solutions typically cover a broad spectrum of aspects in running a venue such as:
*Tracking Bookings
*Stock Management
*Electronic point of sale terminals

The standard NMS forgoes the traditional software installation and instead relies on cloud computing storing all data on remote servers which allow for user access for an unlimited number of computers based anywhere within reach of an internet connection. Many NMS providers base the pricing structure from a [[software as a service]]/[[application service provider]] model.

Nightclubs use specific software to meet the complex requirements of their business. Typically small scale venues will manage their business with a generic accounting package and extend functionality with plugin's or other bolt-on software. The advantage for nightclubs running a specialized system are numerous, however the primary outcome is a more efficient venue. Nightclub Management software typically encompasses all the tools mentioned above however difficulty arises when nightclub staff are evaluating vendors and deciding what software to implement. Integration of these tools is key but venue principals and other key staff still need to pay attention to other factors such as cost.

'''North Sydney''' is a suburb and major district on the [[Lower North Shore (Sydney)|Lower North Shore]] of Sydney, Australia. North Sydney is located 3 kilometres north of the [[Sydney central business district]]&lt;ref&gt;Gregorys Street Directory, Gregorys Publishing Company, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and is the administrative centre for the [[Local government in Australia|local government area]] of [[North Sydney Council]].

==History==
[[Indigenous Australian|Aborigines]] on the southern side of [[Port Jackson]] (Sydney Harbour) called the north side ''warung'' which meant ''the other side'', while those on the northern side used the same name to describe the southern side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Attenbrow |first1=Dr Val |title=Place Names Chart |url=https://australianmuseum.net.au/place-names-chart |website=Australian Museum |publisher=Australian Museum |accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first name used by European settlers was ''Hunterhill'', named after a property owned by [[Thomas Muir of Huntershill]] (1765–1799), a Scottish political reformer. He purchased land in 1794 near the location of north pylon of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] is now located, and built a house which he named after his childhood home. This area north to [[Gore Hill, New South Wales|Gore Hill]] became known as [[St Leonards, New South Wales|St Leonards]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The township of St Leonards was laid out in 1836 in what is now North Sydney, bounded by what is now Miller, Walker, Lavender and Berry Streets. By 1846 there were 106 houses here and by 1859, the commercial centre had extended from [[Milsons Point, New South Wales|Milsons Point]] to Miller Street. A bus service operated by Jeremiah Wall ran between Milsons Point and ''North Sydney Shops'', and North Sydney thus developed its own identity.

[[File:Sydney Harbour Bridge under construction North Shore aerial.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of North Sydney during construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.]]
The North Sydney municipality was incorporated in 1890 and after naming disputes, ''North Sydney'' was settled upon. The post office which opened in 1854 as St Leonards was changed to North Sydney in 1890. The first public school which opened in 1874 as St Leonards was renamed North Sydney in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Sydney Suburbs'', Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus &amp; Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia {{ISBN|0-207-14495-8}}, page 191&lt;/ref&gt;

North Sydney underwent a dramatic transformation into a commercial hub in 1971–72. In this period no less than 27 skyscrapers were built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sydneyarchitecture.com/NOR/NOR.htm Sydney Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trams===
{{main|Trams in Sydney}}
The history of the North Sydney tramway system can be divided into three periods – the first from the original opening in 1886 to 1909, when the McMahons Point line opened. The second period covers the time until the Wynyard line was opened across the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932, and the third until construction of the Cahill Expressway on the eastern side of Sydney Harbour Bridge and the wider closure of the system in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;D Keenan: ''The North Sydney lines of the Sydney tramway system''. Transit Press November 1987 {{ISBN|0-909338-05-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first part of the North Sydney tramway system was a double-track cable tramway which commenced at the original Milsons Point Ferry wharf, located where the north pylon of the Harbour Bridge is now. The line originally extended via Alfred St (now Alfred Street South), Junction St (now Pacific Highway), Blue St and Miller Sts to the [[Ridge Street Tram Depot|engine house and depot in Ridge St.]] It used cable grip cars called "dummies" and un-powered trailer cars.

A feature of these lines was the underground tram terminus at [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard railway station]] (the only one in Australia), and the tracks over the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Trams ran from Blue St, North Sydney over a now-demolished steel arch bridge over the Harbour Bridge Roadway, then over the eastern side of the harbour bridge (now road lanes), through a tram platform at Milsons Point railway station, before descending underground into platforms 1 and 2 of Wynyard station.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6300">{{Wiktionary|out-of-pocket}}
An '''out-of-pocket expense''' (or '''out-of-pocket cost''') is the direct payment of money that may or may not be later [[reimbursement|reimbursed]] from a third-party source.

For example, when operating a vehicle, [[gasoline]], parking fees and [[Road pricing|tolls]] are considered out-of-pocket expenses for a trip. [[Car insurance]], [[oil]] changes, and [[interest]] are not, since the outlay of cash covers expenses accrued over a longer period of time. The services rendered and other in-kind expenses are not considered out-of-pocket expenses; the same goes for [[depreciation]] of [[capital goods]] or [[depletion (accounting)|depletion]].

Organizations often reimburse out-of-pocket expenses incurred on their behalf, especially expenses incurred by employees on their employers' behalf. In the [[United States]], out-of-pocket expenses for such things as charity, medical bills, and education may be deductions on [[US income taxes]], according to [[IRS]] regulations.

To be '''out of pocket''' is to have expended personal resources, often unexpectedly or unfairly, at the end of some enterprise.

==Health financing==
In the [[Health care system#Financing|health care financing]] sector, this represents the share of the expenses that the insured party must pay directly to the health care provider, without a third-party (insurer, or government).&lt;ref name="pmid17625126"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=McWilliams JM, Meara E, Zaslavsky AM, Ayanian JZ | title=Use of health services by previously uninsured Medicare beneficiaries. | journal=N Engl J Med | year= 2007 | volume= 357 | issue= 2 | pages= 143–53 | doi=10.1056/NEJMsa067712 | pmc= | pmid=17625126  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United States'''

Out-of-pocket costs are high especially when it comes to prescription drugs in the United States.&lt;ref name="pmid23550670"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hurd MD, Martorell P, Delavande A, Mullen KJ, Langa KM | title=Monetary costs of dementia in the United States. | journal=N Engl J Med | year= 2013 | volume= 368 | issue= 14 | pages= 1326–34 | pmid=23550670 | doi=10.1056/NEJMsa1204629 | pmc=3959992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before investing in a health care plan, it is very useful to examine the out-of-pocket prescription costs as they may be very low or very high. High out-of-pocket costs may correlate with lower prescription adherence and more importation of medications from foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zullo|first1=AR|last2=Howe|first2=CJ|last3=Galárraga|first3=O|title=Estimating the Effect of Health Insurance on Personal Prescription Drug Importation.|journal=Medical care research and review : MCRR|date=2 February 2016|pmid=26837427|doi=10.1177/1077558716629039|volume=74|pmc=4970983|pages=178–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20818845"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kogan MD, Newacheck PW, Blumberg SJ, Ghandour RM, Singh GK, Strickland BB, etal | title=Underinsurance among children in the United States. | journal=N Engl J Med | year= 2010 | volume= 363 | issue= 9 | pages= 841–51 | doi=10.1056/NEJMsa0909994 | pmc= | pmid=20818845  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zullo|first1=Andrew R.|last2=Dore|first2=David D.|last3=Galárraga|first3=Omar|title=Development and validation of an index to predict personal prescription drug importation by adults in the United States|journal=Journal of Pharmaceutical Health Services Research|date=March 2015|volume=6|issue=1|pages=33–41|doi=10.1111/jphs.12088|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jphs.12088/full|accessdate=27 July 2015|pmc=4930104}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Medicare Part D]] is a federal program aimed at lowering prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries. However, after the first year of Medicare Part D, out-of-pocket drug costs were down, but there was not a noticeable reduction in [[emergency department]] visits, hospitalization, or health utility score. Perhaps, some diseases will be more sensitive to Medicare Part D.&lt;ref name="pmid23635051"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baicker K, Taubman SL, Allen HL, Bernstein M, Gruber JH, Newhouse JP, etal | title=The Oregon experiment--effects of Medicaid on clinical outcomes. | journal=N Engl J Med | year= 2013 | volume= 368 | issue= 18 | pages= 1713–22 | pmid=23635051 | doi=10.1056/NEJMsa1212321 | pmc=3701298 | url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/82640/1/Gruber_The%20oregon%20experiment.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/26/6/1735.full The Impact Of Medicare Part D On Prescription Drug Use By The Elderly]. Content.healthaffairs.org. Retrieved on 2011-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Australia'''

A recent study published from Australia shows that the out-of-pocket cost burden falls most heavily on patients who are least able to bear it, both in terms of their health and in terms of their income. Among the respondents 14% experienced a heavy financial burden. Medication and medical service expenses were the major costs. This study concluded that despite Australia's universal health coverage (medicare) a substantial portion of senior citizens suffer from excessive out-of-pocket expenditure, and this burden increases with increasing number of chronic conditions. Among the specific conditions, those who experienced cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes or depression were likely to report higher out-of-pocket expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Islam, MM |author2=Yen, L |author3=Valderas, JM |author4=McRae, I |last-author-amp=yes |title= Out-of-pocket expenditure by Australian seniors with chronic disease: the effect of specific diseases and morbidity clusters |journal=BMC Public Health |volume=14 |pages=1008 |year=2014 |pmid= 25260348 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-14-1008 |pmc=4182884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ways to improve physician knowledge of drug costs were thought to be increased physician-patient communication or higher use of information technology. Physicians with high rates of IT use did not have significantly higher knowledge or drug costs. Health IT design should be improved to make it easier for physicians to access cost information at the point of care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://codingandbillingcareer.org/health-information-technology/]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3283">{{world|date=August 2017}}'''Social dumping''' is a practice of [[employers]] to use cheaper [[workforce|labour]] than is usually available at their site of production or sale. In the latter case, migrant workers are employed; in the former, production is moved to a low-wage country or area. The company will thus save money and potentially increase its [[profit (economics)|profit]]. Systemic criticism suggests that as a result, governments are tempted to enter a so-called ''social policy regime competition'' by reducing their labour and social standards to ease labour costs on enterprises and to retain business activity within their jurisdiction.

There is a controversy around whether social dumping takes advantage of an [[EU directive]] on internal markets, the [[Bolkestein directive]].

Entities losing from social dumping:
* Employees in exporting countries
* Child labor in exporting countries
* Industry and environment in exporting country
* Government in exporting countries
* Employees in importing countries
* Shareholders of the company in importing countries

Entities gaining from social dumping:
* Companies in importing country
* Shareholders in importing country
* Customers in importing country
* Industry in importing market
* Employment in exporting country
* Government and investment in exporting country

The document argues that a vague definition of seasonal work might fail to cover all types of seasonal employment taking place when the Directive exerts its otherwise-welcome protective measures on the labour market.

[[Image:Ideal firm size.PNG|thumb|350px|right|This [[long-run average cost]] diagram shows that as more is produced, so long as output does not exceed OQ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, economies of scale are obtained. Beyond OQ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, additional production will increase [[average cost|per-unit cost]]s, reflecting diseconomies of scale. Consequently, the societally optimal firm size is OQ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where long-run average cost is at its lowest level.]] The '''socially optimal firm size''' is the size for a [[Business|company]] in a given industry at a given time which results in the lowest production costs per unit of output.

== Discussion ==

If only [[diseconomies of scale]] existed, then the long-run average cost-minimizing firm size would be one worker, producing the minimal possible level of output.  However, [[economies of scale]] also apply, which state that large firms can have lower per-unit costs due to buying at [[Bulk sale|bulk]] discounts (components, insurance, real estate, advertising, etc.) and can also limit competition by buying out competitors, setting [[Property|proprietary]] industry standards (like Microsoft Windows), etc.  If only these "economies of scale" applied, then the ideal firm size would be infinitely large.  However, since both apply, the firm must not be too small or too large, to minimize unit costs.

==Variation in optimal firm size by industry==

The "diseconomies of scale" do not tend to vary widely by industry, but "economies of scale" do.  An auto maker has very high fixed costs, which are lower per unit of output the more output is produced. On the other hand, a florist has very low fixed costs and hence very limited sources of economies of scale. Thus there are disparate degrees of economies of scales for different types of organizations.

==Effects of agricultural, industrial, and service-based economies on optimal firm size==

An industrial society will tend to have large firms, as industry has substantial economies of scale.  A service-based economy will favor smaller firms, as services have limited economies of scale.  There will, of course, be exceptions, such as [[Microsoft]], which is a huge services company.  

==Effect of free entry on firm size==
[[File:Perfect competition in the short run.svg|thumb|right|300px| In the short run, it is possible for an individual firm to make an [[economic profit]]. This situation is shown in this diagram, as the price or average revenue, denoted by '''P''', is above the minimum average cost. The firm produces  the quantity '''Q''', at the intersection of marginal cost and marginal revenue]]

[[Image:Economics Perfect competition.svg|thumb|right|300px|After entry of enough other firms has occurred, their increase in market supply has driven down the price of the good, so that [[economic profit]]s of each firm are zero.]]

If the market for a product exhibits [[free entry]], meaning that firms can enter (and exit) the market at will with no logistical, legal, or other inhibiting factors, and if firms have U-shaped long-run average cost curves as in the graphs at the right, then in the long run all firms will end up producing at their point of minimum average cost. For suppose a particular firm with the illustrated long-run average cost curve is faced with the market price ''P'' indicated in the upper graph. The firm produces at the quantity of output where marginal cost equals marginal revenue (labeled ''Q'' in the upper graph), and its per-unit economic profit is the difference between average revenue AR and average total cost ATC at that point, the difference being ''P'' minus ''C'' in the graph's notation. With firms making economic profit and with free entry,  other firms will enter the market for this product, and their additional supply will bring down the market price of the product; this process will continue until there is no longer any economic profit to entice further entrants. The long-run outcome is shown in the second graph, with production by each firm occurring at the newly labelled ''Q'', with marginal cost equalling price at the minimum of the long-run average cost curve, and with the gap between average revenue (the height of the average revenue curve at this ''Q'') and average cost (the height of the average cost curve at this ''Q'') being zero.

Thus with firms possessing U-shaped long-run average cost curves, perfect competition, with (1) firms small enough relative to the overall market that they cannot individually influence the product's market price, and with (2) free entry, leads in the long run to a situation in which no firm is making economic profit, and in which firms are of their socially optimal size (producing at the minimum of their long-run average cost curve).

The '''South African Institute of Chartered Accountants''' ('''SAICA'''), is a professional accountancy body in South Africa.

As of August 2013, the institute has over 36 000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.saica.co.za/Members/AboutMembers/MembershipStatistics/tabid/502/language/en-ZA/Default.aspx|title=Membership Statistics - About Members - Members - SAICA|first=SAICA - South African Institute of Chartered|last=Accountants|website=www.saica.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''SAICA'' provides support, advice and services to its CAs throughout their professional lives. ''SAICA'' members are business advisors, business leaders and entrepreneurs. SAICA members can use the CA(SA) designation.

==Membership and qualification==
To become a student and a member of South African Institute of Chartered Accountants the candidate needs to enroll for a B Com Accounting degree or an equivalent CA(SA) undergraduate qualification at a SAICA accredited university.

SAICA members serve on international accounting bodies including; the trustees of the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] Foundation (IFRS Foundation), the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB), the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and the Council of the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifrs.org/The+organisation/Members+of+the+IASB/Darrel+Scott.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

International contact and co-operation is fundamental to the standing and image of SAICA. Hence, the institute plays an influential role in the Eastern, Central &amp; Southern African Federation of Accountants (ECSAFA). ECSAFA coordinates the development of the accountancy profession and promotes internationally recognised standards of professional competence and conduct in Eastern, Central and Southern Africa.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
SAICA was a charter member of the [[Pan African Federation of Accountants]], which was inaugurated on 5 May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

SAICA is also a member of the [[Global Accounting Alliance]] (GAA) – an alliance of the world’s leading professional accountancy bodies, which was formed in 2005. The GAA is intended to promote quality services, share information and collaborate on important international issues. It works with national regulators, governments and stakeholders, through member-body collaboration, articulation of consensus views, and working in collaboration, where possible with other international bodies, especially IFAC.

==History==

The first professional institute for [[accountant]]s in [[South Africa]] was the Institute of Accountants and Auditors, formed in the South African Republic in Johannesburg in 1894 with 65 members. A year later the Institute of Accountants in Natal was established. The need to regulate the profession lead to the further establishment of various provincial institutes. In a move towards standardization, the first articles of clerkship were instituted in 1905 and the first journal was published in 1909. Although it did not become a regular publication till 1954, the journal was the sole communication vehicle aimed directly at members and indicated a need for unification. Between 1905 and 1907 accounting societies were established naming Cape Colony, The Orange River Colony and Natal. By the end of 1907, the Transvaal Society of Accountants(which represented more than a half of the registered accountants in South Africa) had grown to 522 members.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.saica.co.za/About/SAICAHistory/tabid/70/language/en-ZA/Default.aspx|title=SAICA History - About - SAICA|first=SAICA - South African Institute of Chartered|last=Accountants|website=www.saica.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the earliest times attempts were made to form a national body. The first meaningful step took place on 6 May 1921 when the South African Accounting Societies' General Examining Board was formed to conduct the examination process on behalf of the societies. The second major milestone on the road to unification occurred in 1927, when the Chartered Accountants Designation (Private) Act was passed by parliament. The Act provided protection for the CA(SA) allowing only members of the then provincial societies to use it.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

But world and local politics at the time hampered efforts towards forming a national body and it was only in 1945 that the Joint Council of the Societies of Chartered Accountants (SA), which provided a forum for co-operation between the societies, was formed.
In 1950 all theoretical teaching and examining was handed over to universities, but the profession retained the right to set the qualifying examination. The first CTA examinations were held in 1951. The Public Accountants and Auditors Act was also promulgated in 1951 and it brought into place the regulation of accountants and auditors in public practice. The General Examining Board continued to set the qualifying examination until 1957 when it was taken over by the Public Accountants' and Auditors' Board (PAAB).

In 1966 The National Council of Chartered Accountants came into being with its own small secretariat – a further step in the process for unification which was finally achieved in 1980 when the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants was formed with 9012 members.
1973 saw the enactment of a new Companies Act and with it the requirement of companies to present financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice. The profession, together with chambers of commerce and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, formed the Accounting Practices Board to issue statements of Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==An era of change==

With the beginnings of globalization, the profession internationally felt the need to work more closely together. This led to the creation of IFAC in 1977 and South Africa was one of the founder members. Although the first woman CA(SA), Miss Elizabeth Kruger, qualified in 1917, it was not until 1977 that Wiseman Nkuhlu was admitted as the first black African CA(SA).

The 1980s proved to be an era of change. While SAICA established numerous committees to improve its service to members and to set standards, the profession recognised the need to open the doors to more black and female CAs(SA). A committee, under the chairmanship of Brian Hawksworth, began to promote this initiative. In 1987 the CAs' Eden Trust came into being as a joint effort between SAICA, the PAAB and the Association for the Advancement of Black Accountants (ABASA) to provide bursaries and grow the number of black CAs(SA). The Eden Trust assisted over 100 black accountants to qualify. In 2002 its name was changed to the Thuthuka Bursary Fund and it was fully incorporated into the institute's transformation and growth strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thuthuka CA Bursary Fund 2013|url=http://bursary.seniorjournalism.com/2012/03/thuthuka-ca-bursary-fund-2013/|work=Bursaries in South Africa|publisher=The Bursary Bin|accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 SAICA took over the role of setting the Part 1 of the Qualifying Examination (QE I) from the PAAB (the predecessor of the IRBA), while the PAAB took over the responsibility for setting auditing standards, and with this came more clearly defined roles for both bodies.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Future==

The profession began a long process to revise the PAA Act in the early 1990s and this process will came to fruition in 2005 when the Auditing Profession Act (Act 26 of 2005) was promulgated (the Act commenced on 1 April 2006). The process has been upset by a spate of international and local corporate failures, with the result that governments worldwide saw the need for regulation of auditors to be tightened up and became more involved in the process.
Another issue that still requires the profession and SAICA's contribution is that of Transformation. The Thuthuka project, an initiative by SAICA to promote skills development and transformation in the CA profession, was launched in the Eastern Cape in 2002 and it was expanded to Limpopo and Kwazulu-Natal in 2004. This programme is providing education support to African learners and students, and seeks to uplift communities while benefiting the CA profession. To regulate SAICA’s efforts going forward, the Institute has now implemented a system whereby leadership issues are identified by the SAICA Board and delegated to the secretariat, so that each day SAICA adds a little more to its history.
Confusion often arises regarding the differing roles and responsibilities of SAICA and the IRBA [previously the Public Accountants and Auditors Board (PAAB)]. It is important to understand the roles of the two bodies.

SAICA is a non-profit, voluntary body that provides a wide range of services to its members and associates. It is controlled by a Board, elected by members through regional committees, and by bodies representing the Institute's other key constituencies such as members in business (commerce and industry), large practices, small practices and ABASA. The IRBA is the statutory body controlling that part of the accountancy profession involved with public accountancy in the Republic of South Africa.

It is important to stress that all entrants to the accountancy profession are subject to consistent requirements. Following qualification, chartered accountants entering public practice are required to register with the IRBA, whilst keeping their SAICA membership, and are governed by its regulations. Those qualified chartered accountants practicing outside of public practice are not subject to the jurisdiction of the IRBA, but are subject to the jurisdiction of SAICA. The IRBA functions in terms of the Auditing Profession Act, 2005 (Act 26 of 2005). Its members are appointed by the Minister of Finance and not more than 40% of the members of the IRBA Board may be registered auditors.

The IRBA is partly funded by fees and levies payable by registered auditors and partly by the National Treasury. The IRBA reports annually to the Minister of Finance, who then tables the report in Parliament.

The mission of the IRBA, on the other hand, is to protect the financial interest of the South African public and international investors in South Africa, through the effective regulation of audits conducted by registered auditors and accountants, and in accordance with internationally recognised standards and processes. This is achieved by providing the means and the regulatory framework for the education and training of adequate numbers of competent and disciplined accountants and auditors, to serve the needs of South Africa. The Board strives constantly towards the maintenance and improvement of standards of registered auditors. It protects the public who rely on the services of registered auditors and supports registered auditors who carry out their duties competently, fearlessly and in good faith.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In order to ensure that all members, associates and trainees comply with the high professional standards set, SAICA provides technical support, continuing professional development (lifelong learning), disseminates and communicates the latest information on technical developments and business trends to its constituencies.

One of SAICA's major objectives is to ensure that membership of the accountancy profession better reflects the population demographics of South Africa. To this end, the Institute has a number of initiatives in place designed to increase the number of CAs(SA) from previously disadvantaged communities.

The responsibility for training prospective CAs(SA) is a shared one. SAICA is responsible for the registration of trainees and management of their training contracts, either in public practice or outside public practice. Trainees who do not wish to follow the public practice route may specialise in financial management. The Institute sets and adjudicates the Part I (QE 1) and the Part II in financial management examination (QE 2), for those trainees who have opted to take the financial management route. The IRBA exercises a monitoring role over the SAICA public practice training and QE I examination processes.

The IRBA is also responsible for setting and marking the Public Practice Examination (PPE) for those trainees choosing the public practice route. Trainees may only write QE 2 or PPE after they have passed QE 1 and upon the completion of a minimum of 18 months of a three-year training contract. After completing their training contract and passing both QE 1 and QE 2 or PPE, candidates are required to register with SAICA in order to use the Chartered Accountant [CA(SA)] designation.

The IRBA conducts practice reviews, investigations and disciplinary processes for registered auditors and accountants. Generally, an individual registered with the IRBA is also a CA(SA) registered with SAICA and therefore must comply with the Codes of Professional Conduct of both bodies. According to the Constitution and By-laws of SAICA, any alleged misconduct by a person who is a member of both bodies is dealt with by the IRBA, in the first instance. SAICA accepts the findings of the IRBA disciplinary process and imposes its own disciplinary sentences on those found guilty. Disciplinary matters relating to members not registered with the IRBA, and associates, are dealt with by the SAICA ethics and disciplinary process.

==South African Designations==

===CA (SA) – The Chartered Accountant===
:''See also [[Chartered Accountant#South Africa|Chartered Accountant: South Africa]]''

Members of SAICA are entitled to use CA(SA) designation after their names. The designation is associated with someone who has considerable expertise in the theory and practice of accountancy. The requirements for qualification as a Chartered Accountant are:

* Education:
** Obtain a [[Bachelor of Commerce]] or an equivalent undergraduate qualification ([[Bachelor of Accountancy]]) recognized for this purpose.
** Obtain an additional postgraduate [[Bachelor's degree#Southern Africa|Honours degree]] or [[postgraduate diploma]] in Accounting.
** Obtain a "Certificate in the Theory of Accounting" (CTA) in conjunction with the postgraduate qualification (only awarded if all courses are passed in one sitting).
* Completion of a three-year training contract ("internship") selecting either of two routes:
** Training Inside Public Practice ("TIPP"): [[Articled clerk|"Articles"]] with a Registered Training Organisation (RTO), a firm of Chartered Accountants in public practice (such as [[Deloitte]], [[PKF International|PKF]], [[PriceWaterhouseCoopers]], [[KPMG]], or [[Ernst &amp; Young]]);
** Training Outside Public Practice ("TOPP"): "Articles" with an Approved Training Organisation (ATO) in commerce and industry, typically at a large bank or corporate (excludes practice as an auditor).
* Pass, in sequence, the two "board examinations" set by the IRBA. The Qualifying Examination (QE) has two parts, and the second may only be written after passing Part 1 and after the candidate has undergone at least 20 months' training:
**the first in accountancy, auditing, tax and financial management;
**the second is the Assessment of Professional Competence which replaced the Part II Financial Management and Public Practice Exam.

===AGA (SA) – The Associate General Accountant===

An AGA (SA) is a highly skilled accountant who has completed both a SAICA-accredited BCom degree and SAICA accredited training programme.
AGAs operate in a broad range of varied work activities, most of which are complex and non-routine.

Core areas include:
* Financial accounting and reporting
* Managerial accounting and financial management
* Taxation
* Auditing, with specific reference to systems, internal auditing functions, internal control and corporate governance
* Information technology
* Payroll accounting.

===AAT (SA) – The Associate Accounting Technician===
The AAT qualification is offered through the [[Association of Accounting Technicians]]. The range of an AAT's work will vary widely. Generally AATs work in support positions and some of their key functions include:
* Purchase accounting
* Inventory control
* Payroll accounting
* Costing and budgeting
* Sales accounting and credit control
* Cash and banking
* Ledger accounts and the preparation of accounts
AAT trainees are required to complete a training contract of at least two years and must pass an examination before they are entitled to use the AAT (SA) designation. See {{slink|Association of Accounting Technicians|In South Africa}}.

==CPA==

A South African Chartered Accountant, or CA(SA), is the equivalent of a United States CPA ([[Certified Public Accountant]]).  However, the CPA designation also exists in South Africa. This qualification was previously designated CFA (Certified Financial Accountant). South African CPAs perform only accounting and tax work, usually for smaller entities, and may not perform auditing work.

A recent legal battle between SAICA and the CPA governing body: SAICA requested that the CPA designation be changed back to CFA (Certified Financial Accountant) because the "CPA" designation might create confusion to Americans who might believe that CPAs can act as auditors.  Using the term CPA is also a contravention of the Audit Profession Act which states that only CAs may use the term "Public Accountant" or "Registered Auditor".

The eventual outcome of this dispute was that the CPA governing body changed its name to SAIPA, the [[South African Institute of Professional Accountants]], and its members designation changed to Professional Accountant (SA) without a corresponding acronym.

The requirements to earn the designation are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.saipa.co.za/DisplayContent.asp?ContentPageID=261 |title=Archived copy |access-date=16 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212205843/http://www.saipa.co.za/DisplayContent.asp?ContentPageID=261 |archive-date=12 February 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Academic: A degree with a [[Academic major|major]] in [[financial accounting]] and with [[tax]], [[management accounting]], [[auditing]] and [[commercial law]] as subjects.
*Practical training or experience: at least 3 years under a SAIPA recognised Learnership, or 6 years of relevant verifiable experience.
*SAIPA Professional Evaluation: This is a three-hour examination offered twice yearly covering&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saipa.co.za/documents/SAIPA%20PE%20Learner%20Guide%20-TD01-V2.pdf]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; financial accounting, auditing, taxation, commercial law, management accounting and practice management.

'''Stelios Joannou''' or '''Ioannou''' (Greek: Στέλιος Ιωάννου; 30 January 1915 – 8 May 1999) was an internationally acclaimed Cypriot industrialist and philanthropist, one of the two cofounders of the formidable [[Joannou &amp; Paraskevaides]] construction firm, known by its trademark, J&amp;P.

== Biography ==
Born in [[Pano Lefkara]], near [[Larnaca]] ([[Cyprus]]), Stelios Joannou was the son of Ttofi (Christofis) and Panagiota Ioannou. At a young age, together with his parents and his sister, Eleni, he moved to [[Nicosia]], where his father owned and successfully directed a small inn that operated in parallel as a trading post for various goods. Growing up in the environment of the famous ‘Ttofi’s Inn’, also called ‘St Anthony’s Inn’, Ioannou had the opportunity to receive a hands-on business education and to witness first-hand the problems, strengths and needs faced by the rural population and the people active in production and trade in [[Cyprus]].

After completing his studies at the [[Pancyprian Gymnasium]] and the [[The English School, Nicosia|English School]], [[Nicosia]], he initially entered the world of commerce. [[File:Στέλιος και Έλλη Ιωάννου.jpg|left|thumb|250x250px|Stelios and Ellie Joannou (Ioannou)   ]] In 1938 he married Ellie Mousoulou ([[Karavas]], [[Kyrenia]], [[Cyprus]], 29 December 1919 – [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]], 26 June 2010), the daughter of Sophocles and Evridiki Mousoulou and the sister of the eminent academic Loukas Mousoulou and the businessman Leonidas Mousoulou. Stelios and Ellie Joannou (Ioannou) had three children, Leonidas ([[Dakis Joannou|Dakis]]), Sylvia and Christos, and together they embarked on a long and fruitful path as philanthropists. Their charitable endeavours intensified after the death of their younger son, Christos, in a car accident in 1971, at the age of 26. Despite his international business success, Ioannou never forgot his origins. Firmly committed to the interests of his homeland, he became a great benefactor of [[Cyprus]] through his charity and entrepreneurial activities. 
[[File:CLEGG&amp;GUTTMANN MATRIMONIAL PORTRAIT 300.jpg|thumb|313x313px|Photographic portrait of Stelios and Ellie Joannou (Ioannou) by [[:de:Clegg_&amp;_Guttmann|Clegg &amp; Guttmann]], 1987 (original at the University of Oxford; copy in the Library of the University of Cyprus)]]
Stelios Joannou passed away at the age of 84 on 8 May 1999 at the Nicosia General Hospital, where he had undergone surgery for an aortic aneurysm. The funeral was conducted by the Archbishop of [[Cyprus]], [[Chrysostomos I of Cyprus|Chrysostomos I]], at the Church of Our Lady [[Pallouriotissa]], [[Nicosia]], on 10 May 1999. Many ambassadors, government ministers, parliamentarians, leaders and representatives of political parties and unions, entrepreneurs, friends and relatives were in attendance, as well as a large crowd of people who had benefitted from Ioannou’s charity.&lt;ref&gt;Κηδεύθηκε χθες ο Στέλιος Ιωάννου’, ''Αλήθεια'' newspaper (11 May 1999); ‘Κηδεύτηκε χθες ο Στέλιος Ιωάννου’, ''Η Μάχη'' newspaper (11 May 1999). &lt;/ref&gt; The coffin was draped with the Greek flag, and the eulogy was delivered by [[Glafcos Clerides]], then President of the Republic of Cyprus and a friend of Joannou.&lt;ref&gt;Pampos Vasilas, ‘Μετάλλιο Εξαίρετων Υπηρεσιών στο Στέλιο Ιωάννου. Η Κύπρος τίμησε τον εθνικό ευεργέτη’, ''Η Σημερινή'' newspaper (11 May 1999); Demetra Molyva, ‘Tributes to Businessman and Philanthropist Stelios Ioannou’, ''The Cyprus Weekly'' (14-20 May 1999), p. 19. &lt;/ref&gt;

A true humanist who exhibited a great sensibility for literary and cultural affairs, Ellie Joannou (Ioannou) was repeatedly presented with awards for her contributions by such entities as the Red Cross and Stasinos, the Association of Greek Philologists of Cyprus (1981).&lt;ref&gt;‘Ο εορτασμός των Ελληνικών γραμμάτων και τελετή απονομής τιμητικών διπλωμάτων’, ''Αγών'' newspaper (30 January 1981). &lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Stelios Joannou, she furthered their common causes and worked towards the implementation of many of the visions that her husband did not live to realize, most significantly the construction of the exceptional Library and Learning Resource Centre at the [[University of Cyprus]]. She was also the first recipient of the Woman of the Year Award in [[Cyprus]] (2005).&lt;ref&gt;Dia Chaili, ‘Τελευταίο αντίο στην Έλλη Iωάννου’, ''Η Σημερινή'' newspaper (29 June 2010), &lt;/ref&gt;

== Business activities ==
In 1941, at age 26, Stelios Joannou formed a partnership with the architect–engineer [[George Paraskevaides]] and was responsible for the financial administration and management of the enterprise. Initially they undertook the execution of defensive military works for the protection of Cyprus from German and Italian air raids during [[World War II]]. Later, in 1961, the partners founded the J&amp;P construction company, through which they expanded their activities outside the shores of the island and firmly placed [[Cyprus]] on the international business map.

J&amp;P’s projects in the greater [[Middle East]] region were crucial for the recovery of the Cypriot economy, which had collapsed in the wake of the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish invasion]] of 1974, by providing work for thousands of unemployed Cypriots. Economic recovery was also furthered by Ioannou’s instrumental and decisive company policy initiative whereby recruitment of any employee was conditional on accepting payment of two thirds of their salary in [[Cyprus]] instead of in the foreign countries where the company was active. In this way, substantial transfers of necessary capital were funnelled back into [[Cyprus]], invigorating the ruined economy of the island.

To this day, Joannou &amp; Paraskevaides continues its successful international course in construction projects.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Andreou, [https://issuu.com/inbusinessnews/docs/inb-dec 'Ιωάννου &amp; Παρασκευαΐδης Λτδ. Διαχρονική Αξία’], ''IN Business Magazine (December 2015), pp. 66-67.''&lt;/ref&gt; Its Greek subsidiary, J&amp;P Hellas S.A., has been active since 1993, initially as Zeus A.T.E. and later renamed J&amp;P Hellas A.T.E. Following a merger with AVAX S.A., the current, well-known construction company J&amp;P–AVAX S.A. was formed.

== Philanthropic work and legacy ==
[[File:Ioannou Centre.jpg|left|thumb|307x307px|The facade of the Stelios Ioannou School for Research in Classical and Byzantine Studies at the University of Oxford]]
Stelios and Ellie Joannou (Ioannou) were involved in a wide range of humanitarian activities, strengthening or establishing charitable, medical and educational institutions and historical and cultural associations and aiding monasteries, churches and patriarchates, as well as sports and refugee associations. Significant achievements of their rich social and benevolent efforts include the following: 

The Christos Stelios Ioannou Foundation was established in 1983 for the care, training, rehabilitation and social reintegration of people with learning difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Address by the President of Cyprus Nicos Anastasiadis at the unveiling of busts of Stelios and Ellie Joannou (Ioannou) at the Christos Stelios Ioannou Foundation (6 October 2013): [http://www.presidency.gov.cy/Presidency/Presidency.nsf/All/DDC8296AB5D0BBBAC2257BFD001AAF3C http://www.presidency.gov.cy/Presidency/Presidency.nsf/All/DDC8296AB5D0BBBAC2257BFD001AAF3C;].&lt;/ref&gt; This organization was augmented by a contribution towards the creation in 1988 of the Mental Retardation Prevention Center, later renamed the Center for Preventive Paediatrics in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;A brief history of the evolution of the Mental Retardation Prevention Center, renamed the Center for Preventive Paediatrics: http://www.cpp.org.cy/centre-en.asp .&lt;/ref&gt; and through further grants towards the operation of the St Christopher Home (1998) and the Integrated Residential Units (EOM)&lt;ref&gt;Summary of the Association of Friends of the Christos Stelios Ioannou Foundation: http://www.ioannoufriends.org/gr/Contributions.html. &lt;/ref&gt; that care for adults with learning difficulties who lack home care. These intensive efforts, as well as the leading role played by Stelios and Ellie Joannou in the introduction and establishment of the Special Olympics Institution in [[Cyprus]], contributed considerably towards removing the social stigma attached to disabled people and their families.&lt;ref&gt;‘ΠτΔ: Ύψιστη απόδειξη φιλαλληλίας ο εθελοντισμός.

Stelios Joannou was named the first president and major benefactor of the Lions Care for Youth Foundation (ΛΙΑΑΠ)&lt;ref&gt;Lions Guide, ‘Πολλαπλούν Θέμα 117, Ελλάς-Κύπρος’: http://www2.cytanet.com.cy/laionikos-odigos/st/st-10-3.htm and http://www2.cytanet.com.cy/laionikos-odigos/st/st-10-6.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; and was also the first and major benefactor of the Agia Skepi Therapeutic Community (1998), which assists substance abusers undergoing detoxification.&lt;ref&gt;A brief history of the Agia Skepi Therapeutic Community: http://www.agiaskepi.com/pilambdaetarhoomicronphiomicronrho943epsilonsigmaf--information.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation of a research centre for Classical and Byzantine Studies at the [[University of Oxford]] was envisioned by Ellie Joannou (Ioannou) and was financed by herself and her children in memory of Stelios Joannou. In 2007, the University honoured him by naming the centre the Stelios Ioannou School for Research in Classical and Byzantine Studies.&lt;ref&gt;University of Oxford, http://www.classics.ox.ac.uk/Ioannou-family.html. See also ‘Μια δωρεάν επένδυση στο αύριο’, ''Η Καθημερινή'' newspaper, electronic edition (27 April 2007): http://www.kathimerini.gr/284458/article/politismos/arxeio-politismoy/mia-dwrean-ependysh-sto-ayrio.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:New Image copy.jpg|thumb|250x250px|The model Stelios Ioannou Learning Resource Centre at the University of Cyprus (Nicosia), designed by Jean Nouvel ]] 
Ellie Joannou (Ioannou) also spearheaded the construction of the outstanding Library at the [[University of Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;The Stelios Ioannou Learning Resource Centre on the official website of the University of Cyprus: http://www.ucy.ac.cy/en/aboutucy/stelios-joannou-learning-resource-centre. &lt;/ref&gt; This mixed-use building (on 5 levels and covering a total area of more than 15,000 square metres) was designed by the award-winning French architect [[Jean Nouvel]], inspired by the landscape around the campus.&lt;ref&gt;Margarita Pournara, ‘Ο λόφος της γνώσης από τον Ζαν Νουβέλ’, ''Η Καθημερινή'' newspaper (1 October 2016): http://www.kathimerini.gr/877091/article/politismos/vivlio/o-lofos-ths-gnwshs-apo-ton-zan-noyvel.&lt;/ref&gt; It houses the Library, the Information Systems Services, the Centre for Teaching Support Technologies and the University’s Language Centre.

The social and intellectual legacy of Stelios and Ellie Joannou (Ioannou) has been continued and expanded by their children Dakis and Sylvia and their families. [[Dakis Joannou]], entrepreneur and collector of contemporary art, is the founder of the DESTE Foundation for Contemporary Art and sits on the boards of various institutions and internationally acclaimed modern art museums.

== History ==
What is now Worth Street originally started at the [[Five Points (Manhattan)|Five Points]] intersection and headed west; it was known as Anthony Street. In 1797, it was named Catherine Street (separately from the other Catherine Street to the southeast, which remains today, as well as another one to the north). Starting at [[Hudson Street (Manhattan)|Hudson Street]], it ended at the western bank of the [[Collect Pond]]. Catherine Lane, which ran parallel and to the north,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/iconographyofman01stok#page/n661/mode/2up|title=A New and Accurate Plan of the City of New York in the State of New York in North America.|last=|first=|date=1797|website=Internet Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jun 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; still exists as an alleyway between Broadway and Lafayette Street.  An 1807 map shows that the pond was filled in, and that Anthony Street ran to an unlabeled short street where Centre Street is now.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/NewYork-bridges-1871|title=Plan of the City of New York, with the recent and intended Improvements|last=Bridges|first=William|date=1807|website=Geographicus|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jun 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1811, Anthony Street was extended to Orange Street (later renamed Baxter Street), completing the "fifth point" of the intersection by bisecting its northeast corner. In 1854, it was renamed Worth Street in honor of Major-general [[William J. Worth]], hero of the 1848 [[Mexican–American War|Mexican War]]. Worth is buried two miles north in [[Worth Square]], which is at the north end of [[Madison Square]] near 26th Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=New York City Chinatown &gt; Historical Photos &gt; Canal Street and the Five Points | website=New York City Chinatown | date=2008-09-13 | url=http://www.nychinatown.org/history/1800s.html | accessdate=2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868, the city opened the section from Five Points east to [[Chatham Square]].

A [[Worth Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|station]] on the [[New York City Subway]]'s [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]] at Worth Street was open between 1904 and 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Abandoned Stations : Worth St | website=Columbia University in the City of New York | url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/abandoned/worth.html | accessdate=2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
