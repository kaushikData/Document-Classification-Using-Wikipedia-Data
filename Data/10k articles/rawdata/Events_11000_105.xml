The '''Huntsville bus crash''' involved a school bus carrying 40 students from [[Lee High School (Huntsville, Alabama)|Lee High School]] to the Huntsville Center for Technology and occurred on November 20, 2006, on an elevated portion of [[Interstate 565]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. Police stated that the bus went over the side of the road after a car driven by another Lee High student tried to swerve around the bus, causing the bus driver to swerve going over the cliff. Four students were killed and 23 were injured after the bus plunged almost {{convert|40|ft|m}}. The driver was ejected from the bus before it went over the side of the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7005595285 |title=Bus Accident Update: Fourth Student Dies |accessdate=2006-12-21}}{{full|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crash was extensively covered by [[CNN]] and ''[[USA Today]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/11/20/bus.crash/index.html|title=At least&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;students&amp;nbsp;killed in&amp;nbsp;school bus crash |publisher = CNN |author=|date=|accessdate=November 2, 2016}}{{full|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-11-20-ala-bus_x.htm?csp=34|title=3 students killed in school bus crash in Alabama |work = USA Today |author=|date=|accessdate=November 2, 2016}}{{full|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crash reignited debate over the installation of seat belts in buses, and whether Alabama should follow the lead of states such as Florida in legislating compulsory lap belts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whnt.com/2012/08/31/story-of-strength-meet-maddie-jamieson/|title=Story of Strength: Meet Maddie Jamieson|author=|date=September 1, 2012|location = |publisher=WHNT-TV|accessdate=November 2, 2016}}{{full|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the crash Alabama Governor [[Bob Riley]] ordered a report be made into the issue. A study group consisting of education and transport officials interviewed 17 expert witnesses, and in early 2007 released recommendations that a pilot program be run with lap and shoulder belts being installed in a limited number of new buses from 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.al.com/huntsvilletimes/documents/seatbelts.pdf |title = Recommendations from the Governor's Study Group on School Bus Seat Belts}}{{full|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[2016 Chattanooga school bus crash|similar accident]] occurred on November 21, 2016, in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], where a school bus driver lost control of a bus, causing it to roll over on its side and crash into a tree, killing six students and injuring 23.

'''Accounting scandals''' are [[corporate abuse|business scandal]]s which arise from intentional manipulation of [[financial statement]]s with the disclosure of financial misdeeds by trusted [[executive (management)|executives]] of corporations or governments. Such misdeeds typically involve complex methods for misusing or misdirecting funds, overstating [[revenues]], understating expenses, overstating&lt;ref&gt;In Italian law the phrase "still subject to evaluation" now refers to material facts that are untrue: it was a clarification for "informations", but totally inconsistent with the "facts" reported in accounting documents: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title=Diritto societario: chiusa la discussione, approvazione a fine mese|journal=Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online|date=2001|url=https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89309129|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324160801/https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89309129|archivedate=March 24, 2016|df=mdy-all}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the value of corporate assets or underreporting the existence of [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]]. It involves an employee, account or corporation itself and is misleading to investor and [[shareholder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032715/what-accounting-fraud.asp|title=What is accounting fraud?|last=Nickolas|first=Steven|date=2015-03-27|work=Investopedia|access-date=2017-03-19|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320145307/http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032715/what-accounting-fraud.asp|archivedate=March 20, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of "[[creative accounting]]" can amount to [[fraud]], and investigations are typically launched by government [[Regulation|oversight]] agencies, such as the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) in the United States. Employees who commit accounting fraud at the request of their employers are subject to personal criminal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/accounting-fraud.html|title=What is accounting fraud? definition and meaning|website=BusinessDictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320144730/http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/accounting-fraud.html|archivedate=March 20, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Two types of fraud ==

=== Misappropriation of assets ===

Misappropriation of assets, often called defalcation or employee fraud, occurs when an employee steals company's asset, whether those assets are of monetary or physical nature. Typically, assets stolen are cash or cash equivalents and company data or [[intellectual property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/fraud_protection/asset_misappropriation|title=Asset misappropriation fraud|last=Anonymous|date=2010-01-25|work=Action Fraud|access-date=2017-03-19|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320143735/http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/fraud_protection/asset_misappropriation|archivedate=March 20, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, misappropriation of assets also includes taking inventory out of a facility or using company assets for personal purpose without authorization. Company assets include everything from office supplies, inventory to intellectual property.

=== Fraudulent financial reporting ===

Fraudulent financial reporting, also known as earnings management fraud. In this context, management intentionally manipulates accounting policies or accounting estimates to improve financial statements. Public and private corporations commit fraudulent financial reporting to secure investor interest or obtain bank approvals for financing, as justifications for bonuses or increased salaries or to meet expectations of shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/financial-statement-fraud-57182.html|title=What Is Financial Statement Fraud?|access-date=2017-03-20|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320233602/http://smallbusiness.chron.com/financial-statement-fraud-57182.html|archivedate=March 20, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Securities and Exchange Commission has brought enforcement actions against corporations for many types of fraudulent financial reporting, including improper revenue recognition, period-end stuffing, fraudulent post-closing entries, improper asset valuations, and misleading non-GAAP financial measures.

== The Fraud Triangle ==
The fraud triangle is a model for explaining the factors that cause someone to commit fraudulent behaviors in accounting. It consists of three components, which together, lead to fraudulent behavior:
* Incentives/ Pressure: Management or other employees have incentives or pressures to commit fraud.
* Opportunities: Circumstances provide opportunities for management or employees to commit fraud.
* Attitudes/ Rationalization: An attitude, character, or set of ethical values exists that allows management or employees to commit a dishonest act, or they are in an environment that imposes sufficient pressure that causes them to rationalize committing a dishonest act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Auditing and Assurance Services|last=Alvin|first=Aren|publisher=Pearson|year=2016|isbn=0134065824|location=|pages=299}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Incentives/ Pressures:''' A common incentive for companies to manipulate [[financial statement]] is a decline in the company's financial prospects. Companies may also manipulate earnings to meet analysts' forecasts or benchmarks such as prior year earnings, to meet [[debt covenant]] restrictions, to achieve a bonus target based on earnings, or to artificially inflate stock prices. As for [[misappropriation of assets]], financial pressures are a common incentive for employees. Employees with excessive financial obligations, or those with drug abuse or gambling problems may steal to meet their personal needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Auditing and Assurance Services|last=Aren|first=Alvin|publisher=Pearson|year=2016|isbn=0134065824|location=New York|pages=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Opportunities:''' Although the financial statements of all companies are potentially subject to manipulation, the risk is greater for companies in industries where significant judgments and accounting estimates are involved. Turnover in accounting personnel or other deficiencies in accounting and information processes can create an opportunity for misstatement. As for misappropriation of assets, opportunities are greater in companies with accessible cash or with inventory or other valuable assets, especially if the assets are small or easily removed. A lack of controls over payments to vendors or payroll systems, can allow employees to create fictitious vendors or employees and bill the company for services or time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Auditing and Assurance Services|last=Aren|first=Alvin|publisher=Pearson|year=2016|isbn=0134065824|location=New York|pages=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Attitudes/ Rationalization:''' The attitude of top management toward financial reporting is a critical risk factor in assessing the likelihood of fraudulent financial statements. If the CEO or other top managers display a significant disregard for the financial reporting process, such as consistently issuing overly optimistic forecasts, or they are overly concerned about the meeting analysts' earnings forecast, fraudulent [[financial reporting]] is more likely. Similarly, for misappropriation of assets, if management cheats customers through overcharging for goods or engaging in high-pressure sales tactics, employees may feel that it is acceptable for them to behave in the same fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Auditing and Assurance Services|last=Aren|first=Alvin|publisher=Pearson|year=2016|isbn=0134065824|location=New York|pages=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
{{POV section|date=January 2014}}
A weak internal control is an opportunity for a fraudster.  Fraud is not an accounting problem; it is a social phenomenon. If you strip economic crime of its multitudinous variations, there are but three ways a victim can be unlawfully separated from money: by force, stealth or trickery.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Joseph T. "New Approaches to Fraud Deterrence." Business Credit 107.2 (2005): 33-6. ProQuest. Web. 31 Jan. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of transparency in financial transactions is an ideal method to hide a fraud. Poor management information where a company's management system does not produce results that are timely, accurate, sufficiently detailed and relevant. In such case, the warning signal of fraud such as ongoing theft from bank account can be obscured. Lack of an independent audit department within the company is also a sign of weak internal control. Poor accounting practice is also part of a weak internal control. An example of poor accounting practice is failure to make monthly reconciliation of bank account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/09/14/top-10-reasons-frauds-occur-3817555/|title=Top 10 reasons why frauds occur|last=Frost|first=Ken|date=2012-09-14|website=Metro|access-date=2017-03-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506185211/http://metro.co.uk/2012/09/14/top-10-reasons-frauds-occur-3817555/|archivedate=May 6, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A top executive can reduce the price of his/her company's stock easily due to [[information asymmetry]]. The executive can accelerate accounting of expected expenses, delay accounting of expected revenue, engage in [[off balance sheet]] transactions to make the company's profitability appear temporarily poorer, or simply promote and report severely conservative (e.g. pessimistic) estimates of future earnings. Such seemingly adverse earnings news will be likely to (at least temporarily) reduce share price. (This is again due to [[information asymmetries]] since it is more common for top executives to do everything they can to [[window dress]] their company's earnings forecasts.

Top managers tend to share price to make a company an easier [[takeover]] target. When the company gets bought out (or taken private) – at a dramatically lower price – the takeover artist gains a windfall from the former top executive's actions to surreptitiously reduce share price. This can represent tens of billions of dollars (questionably) transferred from previous shareholders to the takeover artist. The former top executive is then rewarded with a [[golden handshake]] for presiding over the [[firesale]] that can sometimes be in the hundreds of millions of dollars for one or two years of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/challenging-times-crisis-hit-cosalt/story-14389742-detail/story.html|title=Challenging times for crisis-hit Cosalt|date=2012-01-11|work=Grimsby Telegraph|access-date=2017-04-09|language=en}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar issues occur when a publicly held asset or non-profit organization undergoes [[privatization]]. Top executives often reap tremendous monetary benefits when a government-owned or non-profit entity is sold to private hands. Just as in the example above, they can facilitate this process by making the entity appear to be in financial crisis – this reduces the sale price (to the profit of the purchaser), and makes non-profits and governments more likely to sell. It can also contribute to a public perception that private entities are more efficiently run, thereby reinforcing the political will to sell off public assets. Again, due to [[asymmetric information]], policy makers and the general public see a government-owned firm that was a financial 'disaster' – miraculously turned around by the private sector (and typically resold) within a few years. Under the Special Plea in Fraud statute, “the government must ‘establish by clear and convincing evidence that the contractor knew that its submitted claims were false, and that it intended to defraud the government by submitting those claims.’” Mere negligence, inconsistency, or discrepancies are not actionable under the Special Plea in Fraud statute.&lt;ref&gt;Horan, Jack. "Fraud is here, Fraud is there, but is Fraud Everywhere?" Contract Management 01 2016: 64,65,67-69. ProQuest. Web. 31 Jan. 2018 .&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all accounting scandals are caused by top executives. The proceedings can take so long to come to trial that one executive saw the charges against him dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, John. "CURTAIN RAISER." Canadian Business May 12, 2008: 61-4. ProQuest. Web. 31 Jan. 2018 .&lt;/ref&gt; Often managers and employees are pressured or willingly alter financial statements for the personal benefit of the individuals over the company. [[Opportunism|Managerial opportunism]] plays a large role in these scandals. For example, managers who would be compensated more for short-term results would report inaccurate information, since short-term benefits outweigh the long-term ones such as pension obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cunningham|first=Lawrence|title=The Appeal and Limits of Internal Controls to Fight Fraud, Terrorism, Other Ills|date=September 12, 2003|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable outcomes ==
The [[Enron scandal]] turned in the indictment and criminal conviction of one of the [[Big Four (audit firms)|Big Five auditor]] [[Arthur Andersen]] on June 15, 2002. Although the conviction was overturned  on May 31, 2005, by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], the firm ceased performing audits and is currently unwinding its business operations.  The Enron scandal was defined as being one of the biggest audit failures.  The scandal included utilizing loopholes that were found within the GAAP (General Accepted Accounting Principles).  For auditing a big sized company such as Enron, the auditors were criticized for having brief meetings a few times a year that covered large amounts of material.  By January 17, 2002, Enron decided to discontinue its business with Arthur Andersen claiming they had failed in accounting advice and related documents.  Arthur Andersen was judged guilty of [[obstruction of justice]] for getting rid of many emails and documents that were related to auditing Enron.  Since the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons, the firm was forced to give up its CPA licenses later in 2002, costing over 113,000 employees their jobs.  Although later the ruling was overturned by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], the once-proud firm's image was tarnished beyond repair, and it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.

On July 9, 2002 [[George W. Bush]] gave a speech about recent accounting scandals that had been uncovered. In spite of its stern tone, the speech did not focus on establishing new policy, but instead focused on actually enforcing current laws, which include holding CEOs and directors personally responsible for accountancy fraud.

In July 2002, [[WorldCom]] filed for bankruptcy protection, in what was considered the largest corporate [[insolvency]] ever at the time.

These scandals reignited the debate over the relative merits of [[US GAAP]], which takes a "rules-based" approach to accounting, versus [[International Accounting Standards]] and [[UK GAAP]], which takes a "principles-based" approach. The [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] announced that it intends to introduce more principles-based standards.  More radical means of [[accounting reform]] have been proposed, but so far have very little support. The debate itself, however, overlooks the difficulties of classifying any system of knowledge, including accounting, as rules-based or principles-based.  This also led to the establishment of Sarbanes-Oxley.

On a lighter note, the [[List of Ig Nobel Prize winners|2002]] [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in Economics went to the CEOs of those companies involved in the corporate accounting scandals of that year for "adapting the mathematical concept of [[imaginary number]]s for use in the business world".

In 2003, [[Nortel]] made a big contribution to this list of scandals by incorrectly reporting a one cent per share earnings directly after their massive [[layoff]] period.  They used this money to pay the top 43 managers of the company.  The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] and the [[Ontario]] securities commission eventually settled civil action with Nortel.  However, a separate civil action will be taken up against top Nortel executives including former CEO [[Frank A. Dunn]], Douglas C. Beatty, Michael J. Gollogly and MaryAnne E. Pahapill and Hamilton.  These proceedings have been postponed pending criminal proceedings in Canada, which opened in Toronto on January 12, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/business/Nortel+trial+execs+raided+cookie+trigger+profit+driven+bonuses+court+told/6005109/story.html#ixzz1jx1lhaFw|title=canada.com - Page Not Found|publisher=|via=Canada.com}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crown lawyers at this fraud trial of three former Nortel Networks executives say the men defrauded the shareholders of Nortel of more than $5 million. According to the prosecutor this was accomplished by engineering a financial loss in 2002, and a profit in 2003 thereby triggering Return to Profit  bonuses of $70 million for top executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/story/2012/01/17/nortel-fraud-trial.html | work=CBC News | title=Nortel trial hears fraud allegations | date=January 17, 2012 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121021144/http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/story/2012/01/17/nortel-fraud-trial.html | archivedate=January 21, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.businessweek.com/article.asp?documentKey=1376-LXR6J607SXKX01-6EE8N6QJ3AUEFIHKAV9DABRAOV{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.thestar.com/business/article/1116710--nortel-trial-to-hear-defence-prosecution-arguments-tuesday | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Michael | last=Lewis | title=Nortel auditors pushed back against executives' scheme, prosecutor says | date=January 17, 2012 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120013753/http://www.thestar.com/business/article/1116710--nortel-trial-to-hear-defence-prosecution-arguments-tuesday | archivedate=January 20, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.thestar.com/business/article/1118602--nortel-trial-former-financial-director-saw-disconnect-between-stated-earnings-and-his-understanding-of-nortel-s-circumstances | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Michael | last=Lewis | title=Nortel trial: Former financial director saw disconnect between stated earnings and his understanding of Nortel's circumstances | date=January 20, 2012 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123181314/http://www.thestar.com/business/article/1118602--nortel-trial-former-financial-director-saw-disconnect-between-stated-earnings-and-his-understanding-of-nortel-s-circumstances | archivedate=January 23, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/no-business-reason-to-release-nortel-reserves-court-told/article2309645/ |work=Globe and Mail |location=Toronto |title=No business reason to release Nortel reserves, court told |date=September 6, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304210618/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/no-business-reason-to-release-nortel-reserves-court-told/article2309645/ |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, after a scandal on insurance and mutual funds the year before, [[American International Group|AIG]] was investigated for accounting fraud. The company already lost over 45 billion US dollars' worth of market capitalisation because of the scandal. Investigations also discovered over a billion US dollars' worth of errors in accounting transactions. The New York Attorney General's investigation led to a $1.6 billion fine for AIG and criminal charges for some of its executives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/AIG-executive-sentenced-to-4-apf-14168709.html Yahoo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105115438/https://finance.yahoo.com/news/AIG-executive-sentenced-to-4-apf-14168709.html |date=January 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CEO [[Maurice R.

Well before [[Bernard Madoff]]'s massive Ponzi scheme came to light, observers doubted whether his listed accounting firm—an unknown two-person firm in a rural area north of [[New York City]]—was competent to service a multimillion-dollar operation, especially since it had only one active accountant, [[David G. Friehling]].&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, Jim. [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2008533585_madoff18.html Madoff's financial empire audited by tiny firm: one guy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219062906/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2008533585_madoff18.html |date=December 19, 2008 }}. [[Associated Press]] via [[Seattle Times]], December 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, Friehling's practice was so small that for years, he operated out of his house; he only moved into an office when Madoff customers wanted to know more about who was auditing his accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Madoff Chronicles|last=Ross|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Ross (journalist)|publisher=[[Disney Publishing Worldwide|Kingswell]]|year=2015|isbn=9781401310295}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately, Friehling admitted to simply rubber-stamping at least 18 years' worth of Madoff's filings with the SEC.  He also revealed that he continued to audit Madoff even though he had invested a substantial amount of money with him.  Accountants aren't allowed to audit broker-dealers with whom they're investing.  He agreed to forfeit $3.18 million in accounting fees and withdrawals from his account with Madoff.  His involvement makes the Madoff scheme the largest accounting fraud in world history.&lt;ref name="Lawcom"&gt;Hamblett, Mark.

{{cite BAILII|litigants='''Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police'''|court=UKHL |division= |year=1991 |num=5 |parallelcite=[1992] 1 AC 310 |date= }} is a leading [[English tort law]] case on liability for [[nervous shock]] (psychiatric injury).  The case centred upon the liability of the Police for the nervous shock suffered in consequence of the events of the [[Hillsborough disaster]].

==Facts==
''Alcock'' concerned [[psychiatric harm]] caused by the [[Hillsborough disaster]] of 1989. This occurred at the [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough Football Stadium]], [[Sheffield]] during the [[FA Cup]] Semi-Final in which 96 spectators were killed and 450 injured in a [[human crush]]. The disaster was broadcast live on television and radio. Despite considerable public controversy, [[South Yorkshire Police]] had admitted liability in negligence for the deaths, having allowed too many supporters into the stadium.

In the ''Alcock'' case, 10 relatives of the deceased brought [[negligence]] claims in [[Tort]] for psychiatric harm or [[nervous shock]]. Of the claimants, most had not been present in the stadium at the time of the disaster and none had been in physical risk. Most had sustained psychiatric injuries after learning of the events by television or radio.

==Judgment==
The [[plaintiff]]s in this case were mostly [[Nervous shock in English law#Secondary victims|secondary victim]]s, i.e. they were not "directly affected" as opposed to the [[Nervous shock in English law#Primary victims|primary victim]]s who were either injured or were in danger of immediate injury. The [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|Judicial Committee of the House of Lords]], consisting of [[Lord Keith of Kinkel]], [[Lord Ackner]], [[Lord Oliver of Aylmerton]], [[Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle]], and [[Robert Lowry, Baron Lowry|Lord Lowry]] has established a number of "control mechanisms" or conditions that had to be fulfilled in order for a [[duty of care]] to be found in such cases.

*The claimant who is a "secondary victim" must perceive a "shocking event" with his own unaided senses, as an eye-witness to the event, or hearing the event in person, or viewing its "immediate aftermath". This requires close physical proximity to the event, and would usually exclude events witnessed by television or informed of by a third party, as was the case with some of the plaintiffs in ''Alcock''.
*The shock must be a "sudden" and not a "gradual" assault on the claimant's nervous system. So a claimant who develops a depression from living with a relative debilitated by the accident will not be able to recover damages.
*If the nervous shock is caused by witnessing the death or injury of another person the claimant must show a "sufficiently proximate" relationship to that person, usually described as a "close tie of love and affection". Such ties are [[Rebuttable presumption|presumed]] to exist only between parents and children, as well as spouses and fiancés. In other relations, including [[siblings]], ties of love and affection must be proved.
* It must be reasonably foreseeable that a person of "normal fortitude" in the claimant’s position would suffer psychiatric damage.  The closer the tie between the claimant and the victim, the more likely it is that he would succeed in this element. However, once it is shown that some psychiatric damage was foreseeable, it does not matter that the claimant was particularly susceptible to psychiatric illness - the defendant must "take his victim as he finds him" and pay for all the consequences of nervous shock (see [[Eggshell skull|"Eggshell skull" rule]]).

==Significance==
The impact of this on the area of law once described as a '"patchwork quilt of distinctions which are quite difficult to justify"&lt;ref&gt;See [[Lord Steyn]] in ''Frost v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police'' [1999] 2 AC 455&lt;/ref&gt; is significant because the decision made by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|Law Lords]] was heavily influenced by the greater social concern of allowing a flood of claims with which the judicial system would not be able to cope (the "[[floodgates argument]]"). The decision has been criticised as being excessively harsh on the claimants, as well as not fully corresponding with medical knowledge regarding psychiatric illness brought about by nervous shock.&lt;ref&gt;See the Law Commission Report [http://www.lawcom.gov.uk/docs/lc249(1).pdf ''Liability for Psychiatric Illness''], Part III&lt;/ref&gt; Although reform has been widely advocated and a legislative proposal to mitigate some of the effects of  ''Alcock'' was drafted by the Parliamentary [[Law Commission]] in 1998, the decision in ''Alcock'' represents the state of the law in the area of liability for psychiatric harm as it currently stands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8910">The '''Algerian professional football awards''' is a collection of [[association football|football]] awards given at the end of each season since 2008. Back then, the only award was the Manager of the Year. There are now 3 awards: Footballer, Goalkeeper and Manager. The previous fourth award, the Young Footballer of the Year Award, has no longer been handed out since 2008. The voters are all the players from the [[Algerian Ligue Professionnelle 1]] as well as the Algerian footballers playing abroad at the highest level. The ceremony is organized together by the paper [[Maracana Foot]] and the [[Algerian Football Association]].

'''AlltheWeb''' was an Internet [[Search engine (computing)|search engine]] that made its debut in mid-1999 and was closed in 2011. It grew out of ''FTP Search'', Tor Egge's doctorate thesis at the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]], which he started in 1994, which in turn resulted in the formation of [[Fast Search &amp; Transfer]] (FAST), established on July 16, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ntnu.no/gemini/1999-01/36.html | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120905154655/http://www.ntnu.no/gemini/1999-01/36.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-09-05 | title=Gemini No.1 January 1999 | publisher=NTNU | accessdate=2006-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to FAST, AllTheWeb once rivaled [[Google (search engine)|Google]] in size and technology.&lt;ref name="PR2002-06-17"&gt;{{cite press release | publisher=Fast Search &amp; Transfer | date=2002-06-17 | url=http://www.fastsearch.com/press.aspx?m=63&amp;amid=1383 | title=FAST's ALLTHEWEB.COM dethrones Google as the world's largest search engine | accessdate=2006-12-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061227221338/http://fastsearch.com/press.aspx?m=63&amp;amid=1383| archivedate= 27 December 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When AlltheWeb started in 1999, FAST aimed to provide their database to other search engines, major portals, [[ISPs]] and content sites.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/19991123023343/http://www.fast.no:80/company/press/twbs02081999.html|title=Fast Search &amp; Transfer - World's Biggest Internet Search Engine Goes Online|date=1999-11-23|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; By August 2, 1999, the AlltheWeb database had grown to 200 million unique [[URL|URLs]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By June 2002, their crawler had indexed over 2 billion pages.&lt;ref name="PR2002-06-17" /&gt;

==Closure==
In February 2003, FAST's web search division was bought by [[Yahoo! Search Marketing|Overture]] for $70 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20030227001438/https://searchenginewatch.com/sereport/03/02-fast.html|title=Overture To Buy FAST Web Search Division|date=2003-02-27|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2003, Overture was acquired by [[Yahoo!]], putting AlltheWeb under the ownership of Yahoo!&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708055621/http://docs.yahoo.com/docs/pr/release1102.html|title=Yahoo!

'''Ammar Al-Baluchi''' ({{lang-ar|عمار البلوشي}}, {{transl|ar|''ʿAmmār Al-Balūshī''}}; also [[Romanization of Arabic|transliterated]] as '''Amar Al-Balochi''',&lt;ref name="bbc6jun08"&gt;{{cite news |title=Guantanamo 9/11 suspects on trial |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7437164.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=June 6, 2008 |accessdate=December 8, 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090216052225/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7437164.stm| archivedate=February 16, 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; born '''Ali Abdul Aziz Ali'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rulit.net/books/the-black-banners-read-249656-135.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;Shannon, Elaine.

Charges against him include "facilitating the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attackers]], acting as a courier for [[Osama Bin Laden|Osama bin Laden]] and plotting to crash a plane packed with explosives into the U.S. consulate in [[Karachi]]."&lt;ref name="guardian-16-4-2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/26/guantanamo-files-aafia-siddiqui-alqaida|title=Guantánamo files paint Aafia Siddiqui as top al-Qaida operative|date=26 April 2011|agency=The Guardian|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Member of the same al-Baluchi clan as [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed|Khalid Sheikh Muhammad]] (KSM) and [[Ramzi Yousef]], U.S. officials state that he was a "key Lieutenant" of his uncle KSM who assisted KSM in the execution of the  [[September 11 attacks]],&lt;ref name="comm"/&gt; and that he told investigators that he had sought help in al-Qaeda's efforts to develop biological weapons to use against its enemies.&lt;ref name="DSWW2012:246" /&gt;

He reportedly married and then divorced [[Aafia Siddiqui]], the celebrated Pakistani militant and scientist convicted of shooting at US soldiers and incarcerated in the United States.&lt;ref name="DSWW2012:246"&gt;[[#DSWW2012|Scroggins, ''Wanted Women'', 2012]]: p.246&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the [[United Nations]] called for his immediate release from [[arbitrary detention]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22730&amp;LangID=E&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ammar al-Baluchi was born in [[Kuwait city|Kuwait City]], [[Kuwait]], and is the maternal nephew of [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] (organizer of the 9/11 attacks) and cousin of [[Ramzi Yousef]], the organizer of the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]].&lt;ref name="time" /&gt; The extended family of al-Baluchi is ethnically [[Baloch people|Baluchi]] and originally from Balochistan.  The family patriarch and his brother were lay [[Deobandi]] preachers. They moved the family to Kuwait in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="DSWW2012:60"&gt;[[#DSWW2012|Scroggins, ''Wanted Women'', 2012]]: p.60&lt;/ref&gt;

Baluchi grew up in Kuwait but spent most of teenage years in Iranian Baluchistan,&lt;ref name="DSWW2012:219"&gt;[[#DSWW2012|Scroggins, ''Wanted Women'', 2012]]: p.219&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pegc.us/archive/White_House/detaineebiographies1.pdf |title=Detainee Bios|last=|first=|date=September 2006|website=PROJECT  TO  ENFORCE  THE  GENEVA  CONVENTIONS (also on FAS.org)|access-date=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is a citizen of [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="transcript" /&gt;  Trained as a computer technician, he dressed in Western clothes and "introduced himself as a businessman",&lt;ref name="DSWW2012:219"/&gt; but had been "groomed ... since boyhood" by his cousins and uncles "to join their clandestine war," according to journalist Debra Scroggins.&lt;ref name="DSWW2012:219" /&gt;   According to a U.S. government biography, his "chief mentor" was his cousin and [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]] orchestrator [[Ramzi Yousef]], "who taught him in the early 1990s in Iran about the important of war against the West."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He is fluent in English and worked at Mohammed's [[honey]]-processing company in [[Karachi]] for a while before being hired in 1998 as a computer technician for ''Modern Electronics Corporation'' in [[Dubai]].&lt;ref name="transcript" /&gt; According to some evidence given at the Combatant Status Review Tribunal, he was "very open-minded and western-oriented",&lt;ref name="transcript" /&gt; while his ex-wife told investigators he was "a very strict Muslim" who opposed his wife's leaving the home.&lt;ref name="DSWW2012:246" /&gt;

==Career in jihad==
=== Preparation for 9/11 ===
According to a U.S. government biography, Balouchi "volunteered his services" to uncle KSM in 1997.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to U.S. officials, the majority of money that came to the [[Saudi]] hijackers for the [[September 11 attacks]] was transferred through Baluchi and [[Mustafa al-Hawsawi]].&lt;ref name="comm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="odni14"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odni.gov/announcements/content/DetaineeBiographies.pdf|title=Detainee Biographies|publisher=[[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]]|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.odni.gov%2Fannouncements%2Fcontent%2FDetaineeBiographies.pdf+&amp;date=2009-08-31|archivedate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[9/11 Commission]] reported that he "helped them with plane tickets, traveler's checks, and hotel reservations", and "taught them about everyday aspects of life in the West, such as purchasing clothes and ordering food".&lt;ref name="comm" /&gt; In his defence, Baluchi claims that he often helped people in Dubai with such things to supplement his income, and he had no way of knowing whether any of them were criminals.&lt;ref name="transcript" /&gt;

On October 10, 1998, Baluchi used his passport to open a bank account with the Emirates Bank International, using the name "Ali" based on his [[Kunya (Arabic)|kunya name]] ''Ibn Abdulaziz Ali'' and listing his employer's address with [[PO box]] 16958, [[Jebel Ali|Jebel Ali, Dubai]].&lt;ref name="transcript" /&gt;

He was then introduced to [[Marwan al-Shehhi]] by his uncle, and Shehhi allegedly asked him to help transfer money from Shehhi's company in Dubai to his company in the United States, ostensibly to help avoid banking fees if he transferred the money himself.

In January 2000, an order using Shehhi's credit card had a [[Boeing 747]]-400 [[flight simulator]] program, a [[Boeing 767]] flight deck video, and some [[flight attendant]] literature and flight manuals shipped to Baluchi's work address. Baluchi then shipped them to his uncle to pass onto Shehhi.&lt;ref name="comm"&gt;[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/911/pdf/fullreport.pdf 9/11 Commission Report Findings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423032225/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/911/pdf/fullreport.pdf |date=2016-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[FBI]] Report: "Summary of Penttbom Investigation", Feb 29, 2004. pp. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, Baluchi sent a [[wire transfer]] of $5000 to Adel Rafeea, the administrator of the Islamic Center of San Diego, from the Wall Street Exchange Centre in Dubai, using his PO Box, passport and listing his phone number as 0506745651.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt; Rafeaa later claimed that [[Nawaf al-Hazmi]] had asked him to accept the money on his behalf.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2002_hr/092602mueller.html Statement for the Record: Robert S. Mueller to the Joint Intelligence Committee]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracing the calls made to Baluchi's phone number, authorities discovered that he had received 16 calls from June 28–30 from a pre-paid [[Voicestream]] cellphone purchased in Manhattan on June 4. The phone was deactivated on July 11, and authorities allege it belonged to Atta, while Baluchi insisted that he only ever spoke with Shehhi, who had hired him.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt; Around this time, Baluchi complained to Mohammed that he couldn't do all this additional work himself, and his uncle told him that [[Mustafa al-Hawsawi]] would co-ordinate with him to act as an assistant.&lt;ref name="comm"/&gt;

On June 29, a man named "Isam Mansur" wired $5000 to the [[Western Union]] at 1440 Broadway in New York, where Shehhi picked it up. This is alleged to have been Baluchi, since two later direct payments into Shehhi's Sun Trust account from the Exchange Center, a $10,000 payment to Shehhi on July 18 from "Isam Mans''u''r" and a $9500 August 5 payment from "Isam Mans''ou''r", gave Baluchi's PO Box number.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;

On August 8, Baluchi opened a bank account at [[Dubai Islamic Bank]], using his name, passport and phone number.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt; A $20,000 payment from Baluchi's bank account to Shehhi's Sun Trust account on August 29 gave a phone number one digit different than the one given by Isam Mansour on August 5.&lt;ref name="transcript" /&gt;

A $70,000 payment was made to Shehhi's account by "Hani (Fawaz Trading)" on September 17 from the same exchange centre. Hani gave a telephone number one digit removed from the one Baluchi used on the transfer from his bank account on August 29.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;

In September, [[Hani Hanjour]] went to Dubai, where Baluchi gave him $3000 to open a new bank account, and later deposited $5000 in the account which Hanjour later accessed from [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]s in the United States.&lt;ref name="comm"/&gt; When [[Ahmed al-Ghamdi]] went to Dubai, Baluchi helped him purchase a cell phone. It is believed nine of the hijackers met with him in Dubai and received various levels of aid.&lt;ref name="comm"/&gt;

The [[9/11 Commission Report]] stated that he "relied on the unremarkable nature of his transactions, which were essentially invisible amid the billions of dollars flowing daily across the globe."&lt;ref name="comm"/&gt;

On August 27, 2001, Baluchi applied for a visa to travel to the United States for a week after his employer announced the closing of their Dubai branch, and the government had sent notices informing the employees their work permits had been rescinded and they had to leave the country. He was declined since he appeared to be an economic immigrant, and instead moved back home to Pakistan a few days before the attacks.&lt;ref name="comm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;

=== Post-9-11 ===
Moving back in with his parents in [[Karachi, Pakistan]], Baluchi saw his uncle several times when he came to visit. According to a short biography written by the United States government's [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), after the Taliban was initially driven from power after the 9/11 attack, al-Balouchi assisted KSM in organizing the movement of al-Qaeda operatives and their families to safehouses in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
* According to US government information, KSM had Balouchi be the "communications intermediary" between al-Qaeda and "shoe bombers" [[Richard Reid]] and [[Saajid Badat]]. In early 2002 Balouchi helped his uncle "prepare operatives" for travel from Pakistan to the United States, "ostensibly to carry out attacks".
* Another plan was to hijack airliners and crash them into London's [[Heathrow airport]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1528332/Mastermind-of-911-had-plot-to-hit-Heathrow.html|title=Mastermind of 9/11 had 'plot to hit Heathrow'|last=Gardham|first=By Duncan|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but 
* This plan was set aside in order to focus on a plan to bomb the US Consulate and other Western targets in [[Karachi]].&lt;ref name="DSWW2012:252"&gt;[[#DSWW2012|Scroggins, ''Wanted Women'', 2012]]: p.252&lt;/ref&gt;
* He also worked with his uncle to prepare Majid Khan and others for travel to the United States to conduct terrorist operations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Balouchi reportedly sent [[Majid Khan (detainee)|Majid Khan]] to Thailand in late 2002 to deliver $50,000 to finance a plan by [[Jemaah Islamiyah|Jemaah Islamiya]] leader [[Riduan Isamuddin|Hambali]] (Riduan Isamuddin) to attack US and Israeli targets in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
He  later told investigators he helped his uncle arrange travel visas for people, but didn't know whether any of them were militants or not.&lt;ref name="transcript" /&gt; In August 2002, the [[FBI]] questioned Abdul Samad Din Mohammed, the brother-in-law of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. He reported that Baluchi was often in the company of his uncle, and would pick people up from the airport.&lt;ref name="transcript" /&gt;   His uncle KSM was arrested in [[Rawalpindi]] on March 1, 2003. Baluchi spent the next two months with [[Walid bin 'Attash]].  According to US reports, following his uncle's arrest Baluchi took charge of some of the new attacks being planned.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[File:Afia-grad-01a.jpg|180px|thumb|right|[[Aafia Siddiqui]], wife]]

==== Marriage ====
Baluchi  also married [[Aafia Siddiqui]]. She was accused of being an al-Qaeda member and in February 2010 was convicted of assaulting with a deadly weapon and attempting to kill U.S. soldiers and FBI agents who were seeking to interrogate her while she was in custody, claimed to be married to Baluchi.&lt;ref name="TIME1"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1954598,00.html Al-Qaeda Woman? Putting Aafia Siddiqui on Trial], ''[[TIME]]'', 2010-01-18&lt;/ref&gt;  The marriage was confirmed by Pakistani and US intelligence,&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/24/aafia-siddiqui-al-qaida The mystery of Dr Aafia Siddiqui], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 2009-11-24&lt;/ref&gt; a defense psychologist,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/nyregion/09marry.html Family Affair, Just Maybe, at Courthouse]&lt;/ref&gt; and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7544008.stm Mystery of Siddiqui disappearance], [[BBC]], 2008-08-06&lt;/ref&gt; (Siddiqui's family denies she was married to Baluchi.)&lt;ref name="guardian-16-4-2011" /&gt;

According to the FBI, after her arrest, Aafia Siddiqui told them that after she learned she was wanted by the US government she had gone into hiding around late March  2003 with the al-Baluchi clan. Divorced at the time, she stated she married Baluchi out of religious piety, since she "could not live in the same house with an unmarried male" (namely Baluchi) she married him.&lt;ref name=DSWW2012:246/&gt; Their marriage was held in Hub Chowki outside of Karachi in the inner courtyard of Balouchi's house, with female al-Baluchi family members present.&lt;ref&gt;''United States of America v. Aafia Siddiqui'', Document 256, August 17, 2010, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;  Siddiqui describes Balouchi as very kind to her, "a good man who is wrongly accused". (Siddiqui later repudiated all statements given to the FBI.)&lt;ref name="DSWW2012:245-6"&gt;[[#DSWW2012|Scroggins, ''Wanted Women'', 2012]]: p.245-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The marriage lasted only a couple of months. According to one of KSM's uncles—Mohammed Hussein—Baluchi became alienated with Aafia's "liberal way of life". Aafia told the FBI that Baluchi divorced her after he was arrested.&lt;ref name="DSWW2012:253"&gt;[[#DSWW2012|Scroggins, ''Wanted Women'', 2012]]: p.253&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capture and treatment in US custody==

Siddiqui was arrested April 29 in Karachi along with al-Attash.&lt;ref name=DSWW2012:251&gt;[[#DSWW2012|Scroggins, ''Wanted Women'', 2012]]: p.251&lt;/ref&gt;

After his arrest al-Baluchi was kept in CIA custody at undisclosed locations until September 6, 2006 when he was transferred to Guantanamo Bay Prison in Cuba. In December 2005, [[Human Rights Watch]] listed him as a "[[ghost detainee]]" held in the [[CIA prison system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/11/30/usdom12109.htm List of “Ghost Prisoners” Possibly in CIA Custody], ''[[Human Rights Watch]]'', December 1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; During al-Baluchi's secret detention, he was tortured by the CIA using many so-called "[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]". Officials reported: "al-Baluchi was tortured and forcibly dunked into a tub filled with ice water. CIA interrogators forcibly kept his head under water while he struggled to breathe and beat him repeatedly with a truncheon-like object hitting him and smashing his head against a wall."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Greg|last2=Goldman|first2=Adam|last3=Nakashima|first3=Ellen|title=CIA misled on interrogation program, Senate report says|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-misled-on-interrogation-program-senate-report-says/2014/03/31/eb75a82a-b8dd-11e3-96ae-f2c36d2b1245_story.html|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baluchi had a copy of a letter to [[Osama bin Laden]] from Saudi scholars in his pocket, a computer disk containing a draft of a letter to bin Laden, two images of the September 11 attacks, and a perfume bottle containing low-concentration [[cyanide]] used to bleach and perfume clothes.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt; Baluchi was also accused of discussing the possibility of exporting explosives to the United States through [[textile]] companies, but claims to have no knowledge of what conversation is being referenced.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt; The arrests led to the arrests of Jawad al-Bashar and Farzand Shah.&lt;ref&gt;[[CNN]], [http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/south/05/03/pakistan.terror/index.html Arrests amid Karachi terror plot], May 3, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 7, 2003, a detainee was interrogated and said that [[Mohamed Atta]] and [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]] spoke briefly in August 2000 about a "Losh" who had asked Atta if he could travel to the United States to help with any potential plots, having already asked Mohammed three months earlier. Authorities allege this is a reference to Baluchi.&lt;ref name="comm"/&gt;

According to US investigators, Baluchi told them that al-Qaeda had set up a biological weapons lab and he asked [[Aafia Siddiqui]] (who has a biology degree from [[MIT]]) advice on how long it would take to develop such weapons and whether the man in charge was capable of developing the weapons.&lt;ref name=DSWW2012:246/&gt;  Siddiqui replied that she "was willing to participate in a biological weapons (BW) project if al-Qaida tasked her to do so".&lt;ref name="guardian-16-4-2011" /&gt;

Another plot involving Bauchi alleged by US investigators involved [[Heathrow airport]]. &lt;blockquote&gt;According to Balochi's file, he told interrogators that he became aware of a plan to attack Heathrow airport in January 2003 and had intended to seek help from a more senior al-Qaida operative, [[Walid bin Attash]], to carry it out.

An "analyst note" in the files notes that the plot called for "crashing numerous airplanes into Heathrow, with a secondary explosion immediately outside of the airport as a diversion". It collapsed after KSM was arrested in March 2003.&lt;ref name="guardian-16-4-2011" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Guantanamo Bay===
On September 6, 2006, Baluchi was transferred from a [[black site]] location to [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]. He was given the [[Internment Serial Number]] 10018 and is currently detained at a top-secret site at the Guantanamo base that allegedly houses approximately 15 "high-value" prisoners.&lt;ref name=odni14/&gt; Its location and the conditions inside are withheld from public knowledge and there are suspected grave human rights concerns regarding its conditions.&lt;ref name=CNN20060906&gt;{{cite web

===CSRT===
{{wikisource|CSRT Summary of Evidence memo for Ammar Al Baluchi}}

[[US District Court]] Justice [[Joyce Hens Green]] ruled that the Combatant Status Review Tribunals were unconstitutional.  Nevertheless, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] scheduled Tribunals for the 14 high-value captives who were transferred from covert [[CIA]] custody, on September 6, 2006, for early winter of 2007.

The [[Summary of Evidence (CSRT)|Summary of Evidence memo]] for Baluchi's Combatant Status Review Tribunal was drafted on February 8, 2007.&lt;ref name=CsrtMustafaAhmedAlHawsawiSummaryOfEvidence&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/ISN10018.pdf#1 Summary of Evidence (.pdf)], prepared for Ammar al-Baluchi's ''[[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]'' – February 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Baluchi cooperated with his tribunal. Although he was not able to call [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], [[Saifullah Paracha]] or [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]] to testify about his lack of connection to al-Qaeda, he was permitted to have his legal representative field statements they had made. He chose to put forward the statements by Mohammed and bin al-Shibh as evidence, but not the statement by Paracha.&lt;ref name="transcript"&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/transcript_ISN10018.pdf#1 Summary of Evidence (.pdf)], prepared for Ammar al-Baluchi's ''[[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Baluchi requested statements be garnered from ''Modern Electronics Corporation'' personnel, including Samir Sharin, Mohammed Mayer, Asraf Mayer, Ammar al-Tesqui and Sayed Tesqui that would testify he had no connections to militant forces, and that his employee records would show that he left several days before the attacks because his [[work permit]] had expired when MEC closed its Dubai branch.&lt;ref name="transcript" /&gt; The tribunal judge ruled that although Baluchi's leaving Dubai a few days prior to the attacks was among the reasons for his capture, it was not relevant to seek records from his employer.&lt;ref name="transcript" /&gt; Since the tribunal did not locate the individuals, Baluchi submit two statements he had written himself as what he believed his co-workers would say, and what he believed his Israeli roommates would say.&lt;ref name="transcript" /&gt;

In his defence, Baluchi argued that he often acted as a "businessman" to supplement his income, and thus his signature, telephone number and similar details were easily obtained in Dubai. He admitted dealing with [[Marwan al-Shehhi]], but said that "when [he] approached me, he never declared himself as 'hijacker Marwan al Shehhi'. He approached me the same way he approached other individuals and companies in the U.S. — a man wanting to do business".&lt;ref name="transcript" /&gt;

===First military commission===

In February 2008, Baluchi was committed to a joint trial, charged with conspiracy, attacking civilians and civilian objects, causing serious bodily injury, murder, destruction of property, hijacking, terrorism and [[providing material support for terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]], [https://www.hrw.org/photos/2008/guantanamo/Ali-Abdul-Aziz-Ali.html Ali Abdul Aziz Ali]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of Defense]], [http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=11921 9/11 Co-Conspirators Charges Referred], May 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Baluchi, [[Walid Bin Attash]], and [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] chose to serve as their own attorney.&lt;ref name=MiamiHerald20081012&gt;

They requested laptops, and internet access, in order to prepare their defenses.  In October 2008 [[Ralph Kohlmann]] ruled that the men be provided with the computers, but not the internet access.
Al Baluchi's request said he was a Microsoft Certified software engineer.

On December 8, 2008, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told the judge that he and the other four indictees wished to plead guilty; however, the plea would be delayed until after [[competency evaluation (law)|mental competency hearings]] for Hawsawi and bin al-Shibh.  Mohammed said, "We want everyone to plead together."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Top 9/11 suspects to plead guilty |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7770856.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=December 8, 2008 |accessdate=December 8, 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081210034210/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7770856.stm| archivedate=December 10, 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===January 2009 Executive Order to Close Guantanamo===

On January 22, 2009, [[United States President]] [[Barack Obama]] issued [[Executive Order 13492]], ordering a halt to the [[Guantanamo military commission]] as part of the overall closure of [[Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp]].  On April 21, 2009, [[United States Senate]] minority leader [[Mitch McConnell]] cited "Ali Abd al-Azeez Ali" as an example of the kind of captive [[United States President]] [[Barack Obama]] might free in the United States when he closes the camp in January 2010, because he didn't know what else to do with him.&lt;ref name=MiamiHerald2009-04-21McConnelSpeech&gt;

===Second military commission===

In October 2011, in an operation called the "baseline review," the prison seized all legal materials belonging to "high-value detainees," starting with [[Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri]].  The prison also announced that it would change its previous policy and begin reviewing legal mail for its content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Finn|first1=Peter|title=Guantanamo authorities reading attorney-client mail, lawyers say|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/world/national-security/guantanamo-authorities-reading-attorney-client-mail-lawyers-say/2011/11/01/gIQAXoQkdM_story.html|agency=Washington Post |accessdate=2014-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, the [[Chief Defense Counsel (United States)]] ordered the attorneys under his supervision to stop sending privileged communications to Guantanamo prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Carol|title=Guantanamo commander: Contractors read inmate lawyer's mail |agency=mcclatchy |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2012/01/17/136162_guantanamo-commander-contractors.html?rh=1|accessdate=2014-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Chief Defense Counsel (United States)]] policy, Al-Baluchi could not receive mail from his attorneys until November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guantanamo inmates allowed mail from lawyers|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2013/11/correspondence-eased-guantanamo-inmates-201311762054511113.html|accessdate=2014-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, 2012, the Department of Defense referred [[Guantanamo military commission]] charges against al Baluchi and four other men for participation in the conspiracy leading up to the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/04/us/khalid-9-11-charges/ |title=Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, 4 others charged in 9/11 attack |date=2012-04-04 |accessdate=24 February 2017 |agency=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 5, 2012, Military Judge [[James Pohl]] arraigned al Baluchi, and appointed attorneys to represent him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/06/us/9-11-defendants-face-arraignment-in-military-court.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |agency=New York Times |title=At a Hearing, 9/11 Detainees Show Defiance |date=5 May 2012 |last1=SAVAGE |first1=CHARLIE |accessdate=24 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zero Dark Thirty==

A fictionalized account of al-Baluchi's interrogation at black sites is depicted in the 2012 film ''[[Zero Dark Thirty]]''. The character "Ammar" is portrayed by [[Reda Kateb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/entertainment/2020053499_moviezerowirexml.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130216183244/http://seattletimes.com/html/entertainment/2020053499_moviezerowirexml.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 16, 2013 |title=‘Zero Dark Thirty’ filmmakers pull off tricky balancing act |date=January 4, 2013 |accessdate=January 28, 2013 |author=Steven Rea |work=[[Seattle Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Baluchi has complained that the United States has provided more information to the filmmakers Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal about al-Baluchi's treatment in CIA custody than it has to Baluchi's own attorneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Carol|title=Who has more info: Guantanamo lawyers or Hollywood?|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/08/30/3596920/who-has-more-info-guantanamo-lawyers.html|website=Miami Herald|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIA acknowledged that the character "Ammar" is based on al-Baluchi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chen |first1=Adrian |title=Newly Declassified Memo Shows CIA Shaped Zero Dark Thirty's Narrative |url=http://gawker.com/declassified-memo-shows-how-cia-shaped-zero-dark-thirty-493174407 |website=Gawker |accessdate=24 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609180324/http://gawker.com/declassified-memo-shows-how-cia-shaped-zero-dark-thirty-493174407 |archivedate=9 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, "Dan" the interrogator and other characters repeatedly describe "Ammar" as Mr. Mohammad's nephew. "Dan" also references the arrest of "Ammar" and describes his role as the financial facilitator in the 9/11 attacks. "The first 25 minutes of the movie are largely taken up with torture: Ammar is strung up, beaten, water boarded and kept awake for 96 hours straight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winter|first1=Jessica|title=Kathryn Bigelow: The Art of Darkness|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2134499-3,00.html|website=Time|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 2000 (though was in development since 1994 under the name Ia-Con) by Sven Harvey, '''Auto Assembly''' was a [[Transformers]] convention held in [[Birmingham]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] and run by the science-fiction fan organisation [[Infinite Frontiers]]. The first event was held in October 2000 and was held annually (except in 2002 and 2007 when it took "gap years") until the final event in 2015. The event was very originally called "The Auto-Assembly", and came to be referred to colloquially as "AA."

Sven Harvey stepped down from his role with the event between the 2008 and 2009 conventions due to various issues unrelated to the event but has now returned to the team. Head of Infinite Frontiers Simon Plumbe is now the owner of the convention working with a team of volunteers.

The convention started life as a small-scale event, intended to be an occasional Transformers equivalent of the meetings held by the [[Star Trek]] fan club Alpha Quadrant (which itself grew from the Delta Quadrant '96 convention run by Infinite Frontiers, headed by Simon Plumbe with Sven being on the committee.) The first event was expected to have a relatively small number of fans attending - smaller than the Star Trek meetings - although this figure was exceeded. Sven's original idea was to grow the meetings over time and then launch the Ia-con convention as an annual event based on the meetings, which originally were to be quarterly. "The Auto-Assembly" ran on 22 October 2000 and was run by Sven with Simon in a support administrative role.&lt;ref&gt;Convention Founder&lt;/ref&gt; From the first meeting however, the event grew rapidly and by the time the event reached 2003, "The Auto-Assembly" name, as was, was so strong a brand that Ia-con would have been a confusing move. Auto Assembly 2003, only the third event, had expanded to a full-scale convention, though at that point it was referred to as a Transformers Collectors Fair. The growth of the event and the friendliness of the fans in attendance actually converted Simon into a [[Transformers]] fan in the process.

The convention attracts fans from all over the UK and Europe and as far afield as [[United States|America]] and [[Australia]] and currently holds the European attendance record with 1064 fans attending Auto Assembly 2015 from the UK and [[Europe]].

The convention has a range of activities, including dealers tables, guest talks, autograph sessions, toy and art displays, video screenings, competitions, charity auctions, workshops (added for 2009) and more. Auto Assembly 2009 featured the convention's first live band as part of its programme - former boy band turned rock band, Next of Kin. In association with sponsors every year, the convention also gives all of its attendees a "goodie bag" with complimentary gifts which have included a range of varied items, including postcards, comics, magazines, stickers, PlayStation 2 discs, posters, and even snacks.

Regular guests at the convention have included Transformers comic writer [[Simon Furman]], artists [[Andrew Wildman]], [[Lee Sullivan (comics)|Lee Sullivan]], [[Geoff Senior]], Simon Williams, and colourist Jason Cardy. Past voice actor guests have included [[Wally Wingert]] ([[Sideburn (Transformers)|Sideburn]] and [[Mirage (Transformers)|Mirage]] from ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2001 TV series)|Transformers: Robots In Disguise]]'') and [[Neil Kaplan]] ([[Optimus Prime]] and [[Ro-Tor]], ''Transformers: Robots In Disguise''), [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]] ([[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] from ''[[Beast Wars]]'', ''[[Beast Machines]]'', ''[[Transformers: Armada]]'', ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'', ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]'' and Optimus Prime in ''[[Transformers: Animated]]''), ''[[Transformers: Generation 1|G1]]'' actor [[Dan Gilvezan]] in 2008 ([[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]]) and for 2009 [[Beast Wars]] actor [[Ian James Corlett]] and G1 actor [[Gregg Berger]].

Auto Assembly: Target 2006, the 2006 convention inspired by the Marvel UK comic story of the same name, had the Auto Assembly debut appearances of artists [[Guido Guidi]] and [[Mike Collins (comics)|Mike Collins]], and the first UK appearance by its guest of honour voice actor David Kaye along with its regular comic guests.

In March 2006, the convention expanded its activities further with the launch of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060419012346/http://www.autoassembly.org.uk/podcast.htm Auto Assembly Podcast] which featured the normally expected chat and news updates, but also included interviews, competitions and - in a departure from other Transformers podcasts - music. The podcast was hosted by Simon Plumbe and Sven Harvey, who at the time ran the event.

Auto Assembly 2008 was notable by having its first display from [[Hasbro]] featuring the unveiling of handmade resin versions of ''Transformers: Animated'' Optimus Prime, Megatron and Bulkhead being given away through a prize draw from an online competition. It also saw the world debut of the trailer for the Transformers: Animated game for the [[Nintendo DS]] from [[Activision]]. The convention also attracted a great deal of media attention and was attended by a television camera crew from Central News who filmed for a news broadcast, a radio broadcaster from BBC Radio WM attended, and a live interview with Sven Harvey for BBC Radio 5 Live took place early in the day.

In November 2011, the first Auto Assembly Europe convention, the first Auto Assembly convention outside the UK, was held in [[Uppsala]], [[Sweden]], from 12 to 13 November. It was organised as a joint operation between the Auto Assembly organisers and the Nordic TransFans Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoassemblyeurope.eu/2011/index.php Auto Assembly Europe official website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130022523/http://www.autoassemblyeurope.eu/2011/index.php |date=30 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, it was announced that Auto Assembly 2015 would be the final Auto Assembly event due to conflicts with the health and personal lives of the team members at the time. Auto Assembly itself is continuing with other activities including the publication of its fanzine The Cybertronian Times.

==The Auto Assembly Forum==
The Auto Assembly Forum is run by convention committee head Simon Plumbe, with the help of the moderators. The forum is not as busy as many of the larger Transformers forums, but is still a vibrant fan community. It was founded on 19 August 2003 following Auto Assembly 2003 to act as a support forum for the conventions, but it quickly developed into a thriving community all of its own. The forum was closed in the Summer of 2011 due to dwindling usage and was relaunched in September of the same year on a new server to coincide of the relaunch and redesign of the conventions website.

'''Bahrām Chōbīn''' ([[Middle Persian]]: [[Image:BChobinPahlavi.png|75px]]; {{lang-fa|بهرام چوبین}}), also known by his epithet '''Mihrevandak''' ("servant of [[Mithra|Mihr]] (Mithra)",&lt;ref name="iranicaonline.org"&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bahram-the-name-of-six-sasanian-kings#pt7 ''BAHRĀM (2)'', A. Sh. Shahbazi, '''Encyclopaedia Iranica''']&lt;/ref&gt; was a famous ''[[spahbed]]'' (senior army commander) during late sixth-century [[history of Iran|Iran]]. He usurped the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian throne]] from [[Khosrow II]], ruling for a year as '''Bahram VI''' (590-591).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bosworth|first=Clifford Edmund|authorlink=Clifford Edmund Bosworth|title=The History of Al-Tabari: The Sasanids, the Lakhmids, and Yemen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2UHIQ9WyJ4C|year=1999|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-4356-9}}, page 311.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was later defeated by Khosrow II and was forced to flee.

==Family==
Bahram Chobin was son of [[Bahram Gushnasp]],&lt;ref name="iranicaonline.org"/&gt; of the [[House of Mihran]], one of the [[seven Parthian clans]] of the [[Sasanian Empire]]. Bahram Chobin had three siblings whom were named: Gordiya, Gorduya and [[Mardansina]].

==Rise==
{{details|First Perso-Turkic War|Sasanian civil war of 589-591}}
Bahram Chobin originally started his career as ''[[marzban]]'' of [[Rey, Iran|Rey]], but in 572 he commanded a cavalry force which captured a Byzantine fortress and was promoted to army chief (''[[spahbed]]'') of [[Adurbadagan]] and [[Media (region)|Media]].&lt;ref name="iranicaonline.org"/&gt; After being promoted he fought a long, indecisive campaign against the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] in [[Mesopotamia|northern Mesopotamia]].

In late 588, the massive{{Vague|date=February 2017}} army of the [[Göktürks]] invaded the eastern provinces of the Sasanian Empire, reaching as far as [[Badghis Province|Badghis]] and [[Herat]].&lt;ref name="iranicaonline.org"/&gt; Bahram Chobin was elected as the ''spahbed'' of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and commander-in-chief to lead 12,000&lt;ref name="iranicaonline.org"/&gt; [[Military of the Sasanian Empire|Sasanian forces]] against the Turks. After reaching [[Central Asia]] his army ambushed a large army of Turks and conquered [[Balkh]]. He then crossed the [[Amu Darya]] and trapped and defeated the Turks near [[Bukhara]],&lt;ref&gt;Pourshariati (2008), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; killing the Göktürk [[Bagha Qaghan]] with an arrow.

After his great victory against the Turks he was sent to [[Caucasus]] to repel an invasion of nomads, possibly the [[Khazars]]. Bahram was once again victorious. Bahram Chobin was then made commander of the Sasanian forces against the Byzantines once again, and successfully defeated a Byzantine force in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. However, he later suffered a minor defeat by a Byzantine army on the banks of the [[Aras (river)|Aras]]. Hormizd IV, who was jealous of Bahram Chobin, used this defeat as an excuse to dismiss Bahram Chobin from his office, and had him humiliated.{{sfn|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|p=167}}{{sfn|Shapur Shahbazi|1988|pp=514-522}}

Bahram, infuriated by Hormizd's actions, [[Sasanian civil war of 589-591|responded by rebelling]], and due to his noble status and great military knowledge, was joined by his soldiers and many others. He then appointed a new governor for Khorasan, and afterwards set for [[Ctesiphon]], the capital of the Sasanian Empire. Meanwhile, Hormizd tried to come to terms with his brothers-in-law [[Vistahm]] and [[Vinduyih]], "who equally hated Hormozd".{{sfn|Shapur Shahbazi|1988|pp=514-522}} Hormizd shortly had Vinduyih imprisoned, while Vistahm managed to flee from the court. After a short period of time, a palace coup under the two brothers occurred in Ctesiphon, which resulted in the blinding of Hormizd and the accession of the latter's son [[Khosrow II]] (who was their nephew through his mother's side). The two brothers shortly had Hormizd killed. Nevertheless, Bahram continued his march to Ctesiphon. 
[[File:The Night Attack of Bahram Chubina on the Army of Khusraw Parvis LACMA M.2009.44.3 (2 of 8).jpg|250px|thumb|right|Bahram Chobin fighting Sasanian loyalists near [[Ctesiphon]].]]
Khosrow then took a [[carrot and stick]] attitude, and wrote the following to Bahram: "Khosrow, kings of kings, ruler over the ruling, lord of the peoples, prince of peace, salvation of men, among gods the good and eternally living man, among men the most esteemed god, the highly illustrious, the victor, the one who rises with the sun and who lends the night his eyesight, the one famed through his ancestors, the king who hates, the benefactor who engaged the Sasanians and saved the Iranians their kingship—to Bahram, the general of the Iranians, our friend.... We have also taken over the royal throne in a lawful manner and have no upset Iranian customs.... We have so firmly decided not to take off the diadem that we even expected to rule over other worlds, if this were possible.... If you wish your welfare, think about what is to be done."{{sfn|Kia|2016|p=241}}

Bahram, however, ignored his warning—a few days later, he reached the [[Nahrawan Canal]] near Ctesiphon, where he fought Khosrow's men, who were heavily outnumbered, but managed to hold Bahram's men back in several clashes. However, Khosrow's men eventually began losing their morale, and were in the end defeated by Bahram Chobin's forces. Khosrow, together with his two uncles, his wives, and a [[retinue]] of 30 nobles, thereafter fled to Byzantine territory, while Ctesiphon fell to Bahram Chobin.{{sfn|James Howard-Johnston}}

==Reign==
Vinduyih was sent with a large army granted by [[Maurice (emperor)|Byzantine emperor Maurice]]. They went to [[Armenia]] to outflank Bahram, who was defeated in the lowlands and lost Ctesiphon. He retreated to Azerbaijan and then wrote a letter to [[Mushegh II Mamikonian]], an Armenian ''spahbed'' who was helping Khosrow II, the letter said: "As for you Armenians who demonstrate an unseasonable loyalty, did not the house of Sasan destroy your land and sovereignty? Why otherwise did your fathers rebel and extricate themselves from their service, fighting up until today for your country?"&lt;ref&gt;Pourshariati (2008), p. 129, 128&lt;/ref&gt; Bahram Chobin in his letter promised that the [[Armenians]] would become partners of the new Iranian empire ruled by a [[Parthia]]n dynastic family if he accepted his proposal to betray Khosrow II.&lt;ref name="Pourshariati 2008, p. 129"&gt;Pourshariati (2008), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Musel, however, rejected the offer.&lt;ref name="Pourshariati 2008, p. 129"/&gt;

Khosrow II's army then marched towards Azerbaijan and defeated Bahram Chobin at the [[Battle of Blarathon]], forcing him to flee to the eastern parts of Persia. While Bahram Chobin was fleeing to the east he defeated the army of the [[House of Karen]] of [[Hyrcania]] and later arrived in [[Fergana]]&lt;ref&gt;Gumilev L.N. Bahram Chubin, pp. 229 - 230&lt;/ref&gt; where he was received honorably by the [[khagan]] of the Göktürks. Khosrow II, however, could not feel secure as long as Bahram Chobin lived, and succeeded in having him assassinated.&lt;ref&gt;Usanova M. Ismoil Somonii waqfnomasi, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder of Bahram's troops returned to northern Iran and joined the rebellion of Vistahm which took place in 590/1–596 or 594/5–600.&lt;ref&gt;Pourshariati (2008), pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt;

== The fate of his family ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
After Bahram's death, his sister Gordiya traveled to Khorasan, where she married [[Vistahm]], who during that time was also rebelling against [[Khosrow II]].

Bahram had three sons named Shapur, [[Mihran Bahram-i Chobin]], and Noshrad. Shapur continued to oppose the Sasanians and later joined the rebellion of Vistahm. After the end of the rebellion, Shapur was executed. Mihran is mentioned in 633 as a general in the [[Sasanian army]] and fought against the [[Arabs]] during the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]].

There are many fables attributed to Bahram VI, as is the norm for many heroes in [[Persian literature]]. The chapters in Volume VIII of [[Ferdowsi]]'s 11th-century ''[[Shahnameh]]''&lt;ref&gt;online at http://persian.packhum.org/persian/&lt;/ref&gt; on the reigns of "Hormizd, Son of Khosrow I," and "Khosrow Parviz," both of which are almost as much about Bahram Chobin as about Hormizd or his son.

Following the collapse of the Sasanian Empire, the Samanid dynasty formed of descendants of Bahram Chobin, became one of the first independent [[List of Iranian dynasties and countries|Iranian dynasties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Narshakhī|first1=Abū Bakr Muḥammad ibn Jaʻfar|authorlink1=Narshakhi|last2=Frye|first2=Richard N.|authorlink2=Richard N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6736">The '''Ballinasloe Horse Fair''' is a [[horse fair]] which is held annually at [[Ballinasloe]], the second largest town in [[County Galway]], in the western part of [[Ireland]].   It is believed to be [[Europe|Europe's]] oldest and largest Horse Fair, dating back to the 18th century. This annual event attracts up to 100,000 visitors from all over the world, with many returning to the town year after year. This festival is one of the most important social and economic events in the life of the town. The town is also renowned for horse and pony riding, show jumping and other equestrian activities which take place throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ballinasloe.com/ Ballinasloe.com - Ballinasloe Town&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120719214155/http://www.ballinasloe.com/ |date=2012-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivities==
The fair lasts nine days and starts on the Saturday before the first Tuesday in October, when a parade through the town is held. It continues during the next week and includes a beauty contest (the Queen of the Fair), tug-of-war competitions, dog shows, artistic and cultural events, singing competitions and fairground attractions as well as the titular horse fair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ballinasloeoctoberfair.com/content/index.php/events/day-by-day-programme Day by Day Programme&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425121629/http://ballinasloeoctoberfair.com/content/index.php/events/day-by-day-programme |date=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter event includes sale-and-purchase, racing and show-jumping and these are concentrated on a 6-acre site on Society Street - the fair green. Events culminate during the second week-end;  the Saturday of which is known as "Country Fair Day". Traditionally, this was the day in the fair with the highest attendance from local rural residents.

==History==
The fair is known by a variety of names, including the "Ballinasloe October Fair", the "October Fair" and the "Great Horse Fair" and it is the oldest horse fair in Ireland. It is now predominantly known as a horse fair, but previously served the range of agricultural interests associated East Galway and [[County Roscommon|South Roscommon]], the hinterland of [[Ballinasloe]].   Traditionally, farmers from the eastern portions of [[Ireland]] travelled to Ballinasloe to purchase livestock from western counterparts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://ballinasloeoctoberfair.com/content/index.php/history History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballinasloe historically served as a meeting point, or hosting area, for clansmen from local tribes.   Indeed its name derives from ''Béal Átha na Sluaıghe'', the [[Irish language|Irish]] for "Ford-mouth of the Hostings".   Evidence on the date of the fair's origin is scant but the town's traditional role as a meeting place justifies local traditional belief that this is an ancient event.   
By the late 18th century, the fair was being reported in ''[[The Times]]'' as involving the sale of ''"65,758 sheep, and 6,565 bullocks"''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ballinasloe.org/articles/article.php?ID=71 Ballinasloe.org - Articles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; while in the early 19th century the paper reported it as ''"the largest of its kind in Europe"'' (1804) and ''"the greatest in the British empire"'' (1816).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The rumor has it that the Fair became even more famous after [[Napoleon]] allegedly bought a horse there and rode it during the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] (1805).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rove.me/to/ireland/ballinasloe-horse-fair-and-festival|title=Ballinasloe Horse Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A local land-owing family, the le Poer Trenches, who received the [[Earl of clancarty|Earldom of Clancarty]], shaped much of the 18th and 19th century history of the town.  They exercised control over the fair owing to their ownership of the land around the town, coming known as the ''"Baron of the Fair"''.   They sponsored the housing of the Farming Society of Ireland in Ballinasloe and in 1840 the Ballinasloe District Agricultural Society was formed. An Agricultural Hall was opened on ''Farming Society Street'' now renamed ''Society Street''.

In 1948 a committee was formed that organised a carnival to coincide with the Fair and the Show. Thanks to the efforts of this committee and those of the long-established Show Society, the Ballinasloe October Fair has prospered.

==Association with the Travelling Community==
The Ballinasloe Fair has a long traditional association with the [[Irish Traveller|Irish Travelling Community]] who regularly congregate there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/reise/nah/article13665435/Auf-dem-irischen-Pferdemarkt-luegen-alle.html Ballinasloe: Auf dem irischen Pferdemarkt lügen alle - Nachrichten Reise - Nah - WELT ONLINE&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;   Ballinasloe ranks with the [[Appleby Horse Fair]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.applebyfair.org/ Appleby Horse Fair 2011&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Appleby-in-Westmorland]] in importance for this community. Horses used to be central to the Travellers itinerant lifestyle and many of the nomads still keep and breed them. However, older Travellers point out that some traditions are dying out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/10/ballinasloe-horse-fair-ancient-irish-tradition-161006110306964.html|title=Ballinasloe Horse Fair: An ancient Irish tradition|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=22 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011 Fair==
The 2011 fair ran during the period of campaigning for the [[Irish presidential election, 2011|presidential election]] and the fair became a stop off on the campaign trail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westmeathindependent.ie/news/roundup/articles/2011/10/05/4006996-over-60000-throng-to-ballinasloe-fair-opening-day/ Over 60,000 throng to Ballinasloe Fair opening day - News - Roundup - Articles - Westmeath Independent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/21/us-ireland-presidency-idUSTRE79K3B720111021 Irish eyes are rolling at presidential poll | Reuters&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/presidential-election/taoiseach-heckled-as-bid-to-help-mitchell-backfires-2901614.html Taoiseach heckled as bid to help Mitchell backfires - Presidential Election, National News - Independent.ie&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Biens mal acquis''''' ({{lang-fr|Ill-gotten goods}}) is a phrase used in French courts for [[litigation]] seeking the repayment of [[asset]]s stolen from poor countries by [[corrupt]] officials. The phrase refers to anti-corruption legal proceedings against former [[dictator]]s and [[Strongman (politics)|strongmen]] outside of their country, the [[seizure of assets]] within the country of the legal proceedings, and the return of the assets to their country they were [[embezzled]] from. ''Biens mal acquis'' is primarily used in France for its former colonies in the [[Françafrique]], but has since been used for similar cases filed in [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Monaco]], and also against the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]] family and the estate of [[Sani Abacha]].

== ''Biens mal acquis'' ==
The phrase ''biens mal acquis'' is derived from the French [[proverb]] ''[[:fr:wikt:bien mal acquis ne profite jamais|bien mal acquis ne profite jamais]]'' meaning "a thing dishonorably obtained never truly enriches" in [[English language|English]], and is generally translated to the equivalent English phrase of "ill-gotten goods". In a March 2007 report by the [[Comité catholique contre la faim et pour le développement|Catholic Committee Against Hunger and for Development]] (CCFD), titled ''Biens mal acquis... profitent trop souvent. La fortune des dictateurs et les complaisances occidentales'' (English: Ill-Gotten Goods... Too Often Do Benefit: Western Complacency and the Wealth of Dictators), enumerates known instances of [[kleptocracy]] in [[Africa|African]] dictatorships, estimating that $100–180 billion in assets have been diverted by national leaders through [[embezzlement]] or unnecessary expenditure in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccfd.asso.fr/ewb_pages/i/info_999.php Rapport ''Biens mal acquis... profitent trop souvent!'']&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], the [[President of Zaire|President]] of [[Zaire|Zaïre]] from 1965 until his death in 1997, became notorious for using his position as [[military dictator]] to openly embezzle massive sums of state money to fund an extravagant lifestyle. Mobutu had homes in France and Switzerland, and by the time of his death held a personal fortune of $5–6 billion, leaving his country with a [[public debt]] of $13 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9709/07/mobutu.wrap/ |title=Mobutu dies in exile in Morocco: Ruled Zaire with iron grip for 3 decades |date=September 7, 1997|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://survie.org/billets-d-afrique/2007/162-octobre-2007/article/les-biens-mal-acquis-des-2889 |title=Les biens mal acquis des dictateurs africains|date=October 1, 2007|publisher=Survie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Biens mal acquis'' was originally used in France for anti-corruption legal proceedings filed in its own [[judicial system]] against [[heads of state]] of the [[Françafrique]] accused of [[misappropriation|misappropriating]] or stealing state assets for their own benefit. The phrase became associated with corrupt politicians of these poor post-colonial countries, as they and their associates often invested their illegally-acquired fortunes in France. The term was later popularized for all litigation filed against any corrupt politicians of poor countries in any foreign judicial system, normally in [[Western Europe]], where the assets stolen by the defendant are believed to be held. Seized assets from former dictators found to have misappropriated treasury funds while in power have since been returned in [[restitution]] to the governments of the countries they were stolen from. Despite being the first [[G8]] country to ratify the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]], known as the Mérida Convention, France has not undertaken any restitution measures. In other cases, judicial proceedings are still underway, or opposition groups have asked for the money to be returned in some other way to the country's people because a corrupt government is still in power. Sometimes this takes the form of a development project, with negotiated milestones for the release of funds.

The Belgian [[Centre national de coopération au développement]] (CNCD), or National Center for Cooperation in Development, has defined ''biens mal acquis'' as a "[[fixed asset|fixed]] or [[liquid asset|liquid]] asset or fund which may be misappropriated and illegally removed from the public heritage, and thereby impoverishing the state". Ill-gotten goods may result from [[tort]]ious or criminal activity, which has enabled heads of state to enrich themselves far beyond the level their official incomes can explain. Ill-gotten goods may stem from embezzlement, theft, or the illicit transfer of money from state to personal accounts, from [[corruption]] or from [[kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]]. Their owners often use opaque methods &lt;!-- looking for better translation here, obfuscation maybe? And do we mean capital or business dealings? --&gt; to hide their [[capital (economics)|capital]], assured of [[impunity]], particularly due to [[tax haven]]s, and also assured of the complacency of [[developed nations]].

==Current restitution proceedings==

===Spain===
In May 2009, the [[Spain|Spanish]] anti-corruption prosecutor requested a money-laundering investigation of the accounts and investments in Spain of the president of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro Obiang, following a complaint filed in December 2008 by the Asociacion pro derechos humanos de España (APDHE). The association was concerned by a transfer of roughly €19 million between 2000 and 2003 from the US bank [[Riggs Bank]] to an account in a Spanish bank in the [[Balearic Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.portalangop.co.ao/motix/fr_fr/noticias/africa/parquet-espagnol-pour-une-enquete-sur-les-comptes-president-Obiang,c658bf06-30c7-4f32-a388-aa01cadb69ad.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws put into effect after the liberation of France in the [[Second World War]] targeted illegitimate profits accrued during [[German occupation of France|German occupation]], in the [[black market]] or through simple theft. The ordinances of October 18, 1944 and January 6, 1945 drew inspiration from the following principle: "The most elementary fiscal justice requires that all gains made possible by the presence of the enemy be returned to the public treasury. It is unacceptable that while the nation became impoverished some enriched themselves at its expense."&lt;ref&gt;

Citing this precedent, in March 2007 [[Survie]], the [[Sherpa (association)|Sherpa Association]] and the Fédération des Congolais de la Diaspora filed charges of conspiracy and concealment of diversion of funds in the [[Tribunal d'instance|Tribunal de Grande Instance]] in Paris against five heads of African states and their families:
*Omar Bongo Ondimba (Gabon), 
*Denis Sassou Nguesso (Republic of Congo)
*[[Blaise Compaoré]] ([[Burkina Faso]])
*[[José Eduardo dos Santos|Eduardo Dos Santos]] ([[Angola]])
*Teodoro Obiang (Equatorial Guinea)

The three [[NGO]] organizations suspected these heads or former heads of state of buying up a surprising number of luxury real estate assets in France, and of holding banking assets in French banks and/or foreign banks doing business in France. An investigation opened in June 2007 was characterized as insufficiently detailed and suspended in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' obtained transcripts for the hearing into whether to pursue the investigation and in January 2008 published a list of dozens of real estate properties owned by family members of Sassou Nguesso and Omar Bongo in Paris and in the south of France, some of them worth millions of euros. Maître William Bourdon of Survie, the plaintiffs' legal representation, denounced the decision to close the case as "astounding" (''ahurissant'')&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The family of Omar Bongo Ondimba, according to the ''Le Monde'' hearing transcripts, owned 33 apartments or houses including a ''hôtel particulier'' in Paris worth more than €18 million. The ''hôtel particulier'' was purchased in June 2007 by a real estate company associated with two children of the Gabonese president, then aged 13 and 16.

A February 2011 alert from Tracfin, the money-laundering unit of the French finance ministry, mentioned a purchase by Obiang's son of €18 million worth of [[fine art]] in February 2009 alone. On October 6, 2011, Transparency International France and Sherpa Association announced a new complaint in civil court to circumvent the block by the prosecutor's office, which had been refusing an indictment needed for the examining magistrates to deal with new facts discovered in the course of their investigation. On July 12, 2012, the examining magistrates in charge of the investigation issued an international [[Interpol notice|arrest warrant]] for Teodorin Nguema Obiang following his refusal to appear. For Maud Perdriel-Vaissière, director of Sherpa, this step demonstrated "the seriousness of the allegations Sherpa has been making from the first [...] and show that nobody should believe themselves above law. From now on, immunity is no longer a synonym of impunity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2012/07/13/mandat-d-arret-contre-le-fils-du-president-de-guinee-equatoriale_1733405_3212.html|title=Mandat d'arrêt contre le fils du président de Guinée équatoriale|work=LeMonde.fr|date=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bud Billiken is a [[fictional character]] created in 1923 by Abbott, who had been considering adding a youth section to the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' newspaper. While dining at a Chinese restaurant he noticed a [[Billiken]]. Some of the early Billiken columns were written by [[Willard Motley]], who later became a prominent novelist. During the early 1930s, names of international youth were listed in the "Bud Billiken" section of the newspaper every week. Between 1930–34, approximately 10,000 names appeared and were archived in the Carter G. Woodson Regional Library of the [[Chicago Public Library]].&lt;ref name=8th&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.8thinfantry.org/billiken.html|accessdate=July 4, 2007|title=Bud Billiken Parade|publisher=8th Infantry Illinois National Guard Association|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Great Depression]], Abbott featured the Bud Billiken character in his newspaper as a symbol of pride, happiness and hope for black residents.&lt;ref name=WP2002&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jessejacksonjr.org/issues/i0812025939.html|accessdate=July 4, 2007|title=What's In A Name?

It has since grown to become a locally televised event and the second largest parade in the nation.&lt;ref name=8th/&gt;

The parade, which began on August 11, 1929,&lt;ref name=OffSiteHist&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://budbillikenparade.com/history.htm|accessdate=September 17, 2007|date=2007|publisher=Chicago Defender Charities, Inc.|title=Bud Billiken: 78th Annual Parade and Picnic (Parade history)|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070917081357/http://budbillikenparade.com/history.htm |archivedate = September 17, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; now includes politicians, beauty queens, celebrities, musical performers, and dozens of marching, tumbling and dancing groups.&lt;ref name=WP2002/&gt; It has grown from a locally sponsored event to one with major corporate presence and is seen as a signal of the impending end of summer and beginning of the new school year.&lt;ref name=WP2002/&gt; As such the parade sponsors raise money for college scholarships for local youth.&lt;ref name=WP2002/&gt; The parade route has changed over the years. The original route was along [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] beginning at 31st Street, then turned east into Washington Park. Complaints for north-south traffic flow caused rerouting the parade route to South Parkway (now named Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive), which runs directly into the park. At various times, street repairs have necessitated use of the Michigan route, but the current route is now the King Drive route.&lt;ref name=OffSiteHist/&gt; [[Freeman Gosden]] and [[Charles Correll]] of ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'' were the first guests in the first parade. Robert S. Abbott led the first parade in his [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls Royce]]. Dr. Marjorie Stewart Joyner, president of the Chicago Defender Charities, Inc., organized the parade for over 50 years. Numerous high-profile celebrities and dignitaries have attended the parade over the years, including U.S. President [[Harry S.

===Theme===
Bud Billiken Parade is themed every year by the parade committee. The tradition began in 1940 when the parade organizers themed the parade "Americanism" to demonstrate patriotism in the US within the African-American community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXI1CbKvCYEC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=bud+billiken+parade+themes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=leiFtGNTqf&amp;sig=R1purQ2rJ1dUIjbNKKJu0o9Bt2A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wGr-U4zyKpG0yATo2IK4DQ&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=bud%20billiken%20parade%20themes&amp;f=false |title= Bud Billiken Parade|date=1979|website= Google Books |publisher= History of Black Chicago |access-date=November 7, 2012|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other themes over the years:

===Grand Marshal===
A notable person or persons are invited each year to serve as [[Grand Marshal]], often featuring politicians, musicians, or entertainers. Chicago native [[Chance the Rapper]] served as the Grand Marshal for the 88th annual parade in 2017. Chicago native and singer [[Chaka Khan]] served as the Grand Marshal at the 2014 parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2014/08/09/bud-billiken-parade-like-a-big-homecoming-to-grand-marshal-chaka-khan/ |title=Bud Billiken Parade 'Like A Big Homecoming' To Grand Marshal Chaka Khan |date= August 9, 2014 |website= CBS Chicago |publisher= |access-date= November 26, 2014|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapper [[T.I.]] served as Grand Marshal for the 83rd annual parade in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebony.com/entertainment-culture/ti-takes-chicago-446#axzz4pl6KQnWh EBONY - From Grand Hustle to Grand Marshal - August 20, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==After Parade Activities==
The parade begins at 10 [[12-hour clock|A.M.]] After the parade, visitors are welcomed to stay in [[Washington Park (Chicago park)|Washington Park]] for the "after-parade-activities". The "after-parade-activities" has various festivities and [[vendor]] booths.&lt;ref name=UofCHosp&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uchospitals.edu/programs/community/sponsorships/billiken.html|accessdate=September 17, 2007|date=2007|title=Bud Billiken Parade|publisher=University of Chicago Medical Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The post–parade festivities often include a concert. The 2006 parade featured [[Yung Joc]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unratedmagazine.com/Document.cfm?Page=Articles/index.cfm&amp;Article_ID=391|accessdate=September 17, 2007|date=2007|title=77th Annual Bud Billiken Parade|publisher=UnRated}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2007 parade featured [[Pretty Ricky]].&lt;ref name=BBpfOd/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG5ZxhZgO88 |title=Tha Pope &amp; Pretty Ricky |accessdate=September 17, 2007 |publisher=YouTube, LLC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151215101553/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG5ZxhZgO88 |archivedate=December 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it seems neither "after-parade-activities" included a concert.

==Violence==
The 2003 parade featured [[B2K]].&lt;ref name=OffSiteHist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-08-08/news/0308090008_1_b2k-perform-redeye Chicago Tribune - B2K to perform at Billiken Parade - August 8, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; The concert was free with virtually unlimited space in the park for viewing.

[[File:BurglaryIsrael1.jpg|thumb|An Israeli forensic policeman inspects a burglary scene]]
'''Burglary,''' also called '''breaking and entering'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mernick.co.uk/thhol/miscellany03.html|title=Breaking and entering : A Miscellany|accessdate=2008-04-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602141656/http://www.mernick.co.uk/thhol/miscellany03.html|archive-date=2008-06-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes '''housebreaking''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.gov.uk/guides/highCourt.asp|title=How to search for High Court criminal trials|accessdate=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an unlawful entry into a building or other location for the purposes of committing an offence. Usually that offence is [[theft]], but most jurisdictions include others within the ambit of burglary. To engage in the act of burglary is to ''burgle'' in [[British English]], a term back-formed from the word ''burglar'', or to ''burglarize'' in [[List of American words not widely used in the United Kingdom#B|American English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Bryan|title=A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|edition=2nd|pages=122|isbn=978-0-19-514236-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=35dZpfMmxqsC&amp;pg=PA122#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common-law definition==
At [[common law]], burglary was defined by [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Sir Matthew Hale]] as:
{{quote|The breaking and entering the house of another in the night time, with intent to commit a felony therein, whether the felony be actually committed or not.&lt;ref name="Lawdict"&gt;{{cite web |title=Burglary |work=The Free Dictionary |publisher=Farlex |url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/burglary  |accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles E. Torcia, Wharton's Criminal Law § 326 (14th ed. 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Taylor v. United States'' 1990, 495 U.S. 575 citing W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law § 8.13, p. 464 (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
#''Breaking'' can be either actual, such as by forcing open a door, or constructive, such as by fraud or threats.&lt;ref name="Lawdict"/&gt; Breaking does not require that anything be "broken" in terms of physical damage occurring. A person who has permission to enter part of a house, but not another part, commits a breaking and entering when they use any means to enter a room where they are not permitted, so long as the room was not open to enter.
#''Entering'' can involve either physical entry by a person, or the insertion of an instrument to remove property. Insertion of a tool to gain entry may not constitute entering by itself.&lt;ref name="Lawdict"/&gt; Note that there must be a breaking and an entering for common-law burglary. Breaking without entry or entry without breaking is not sufficient for common-law burglary.
#Although rarely listed as an element, the common law required that "entry occur as a consequence of the breaking".&lt;ref name=Perkins&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkins|first=Rollin M.|author2=Ronald N. Boyce|title=Criminal Law|edition=3rd|year=1982|publisher=West Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-88277-067-3|page=200}}, citing R v Davis (1854) 6 [[Cox's Criminal Cases|Cox CC]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=Emg0AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA369#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 369]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a wrongdoer partially opens a window with a pry bar—but then notices an open door, which he uses to enter the dwelling, there is no burglary under common law.&lt;ref name=Perkins/&gt;{{refn|Common law burglary requires both a breaking ''and'' entry. Some statutory offences are phrased in terms of a breaking ''or'' entry. The use of the disjunctive is intended to expand the scope of the offence.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}|group="Note"}} The use of the pry bar would not constitute an entry even if a portion of the prybar "entered" the residence. Under the instrumentality rule the use of an instrument to effect a breaking would not constitute an entry. However, if any part of the perpetrator's body entered the residence in an attempt to gain entry, the instrumentality rule did not apply. Thus, if the perpetrator uses the prybar to pry open the window and then used his hands to lift the partially opened window, an "entry" would have taken place when he grasped the bottom of the window with his hands.&lt;ref name=Perkins/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=People v. Wright
|vol=206|pinpoint=184|court=Cal. App.|date=1962|url=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#''House'' includes a temporarily unoccupied dwelling, but not a building used only occasionally as a habitation.&lt;ref name="Lawdict"/&gt;
#''Night time'' is defined as hours between half an hour after sunset and half an hour before sunrise.&lt;ref name="Lawdict"/&gt;
#Typically this element is expressed as the intent to commit a felony “therein”. The use of the word “therein” adds nothing and certainly does not limit the scope of burglary to those wrongdoers who break and enter a dwelling intending to commit a felony on the premises.&lt;ref name=Perkins/&gt; The situs of the felony does not matter, and burglary occurs if the wrongdoer intended to commit a felony at the time he broke and entered.&lt;ref name=Perkins/&gt;

The common-law elements of burglary often vary between jurisdictions. The common-law definition has been expanded in most jurisdictions, such that the building need not be a dwelling or even a building in the conventional sense, physical breaking is not necessary, the entry does not need to occur at night, and the intent may be to commit any felony or theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duhaime|first=Lloyd|title=Burglary Definition|url=http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/B/Burglary.aspx|publisher=Duhaime.org|accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[etymology]] originates from [[Anglo-Saxon]] or [[Old English]], one of the [[Germanic languages]]. According to one textbook, "The word ''burglar'' comes from the two [[German language|German]] words {{lang|de|burg}}, meaning "house", and {{lang|de|laron}}, meaning "thief" (literally "house thief").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glick|first=Leonard|title=Criminology|edition=1st|pages=280|location=[[Boston]]|publisher=[[Pearson Education]]|year=2005|isbn=0-205-40278-X|url=http://www.ablongman.com/glick1e}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggested etymology is from the later Latin word {{lang|la|burgare}}, "to break open" or "to commit burglary", from {{lang|la|[[burgus]]}}, meaning "fortress" or "castle", with the word then passing through French and Middle English, with influence from the Latin {{lang|la|latro}}, "thief".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=burglar|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British verb "burgle" is a late [[back-formation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=burgle|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
[[File:Burglars Tools Found in the Bank.png|thumb|''Burglars Tools Found in the Bank'', printed in 1875 in the ''[[Canadian Illustrated News]]'']]
In Canada, breaking and entering is prohibited by section 348 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] and is a [[hybrid offence]]. Breaking and entering is defined as trespassing with intent to commit an [[indictable offence]]. The crime is commonly referred to in Canada as ''break and enter'', which in turn is often shortened to ''B and E''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcmp-learning.org/copp/encopp/p_break.htm "Break and enter"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622011808/http://www.rcmp-learning.org/copp/encopp/p_break.htm |date=2008-06-22 }} in ''Code of police practice: A guide for first line officers,'' Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/B/BreakandEnter.aspx "Legal Definition of Break and Enter"], web site of Canadian lawyer Lloyd Duhaime.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finland==
There is no crime of burglary as such in [[Finland]]. In the case of breaking and entering, the Finnish penal code states that &lt;blockquote&gt;A person who unlawfully&lt;br /&gt;
(1) enters domestic premises by force, stealth or deception, or hides or stays in
such premises [...] &lt;br /&gt; shall be sentenced for '''invasion of domestic premises''' to a fine or to imprisonment for at most six months.&lt;ref name="FI Code"&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039.pdf] The Criminal Code of Finland, unofficial translation. Ministry of Justice, Finland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, if theft is committed during unlawful entering, then a person is guilty of theft or aggravated theft depending on the circumstances of the felony.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Aggravated theft:
(1) If in the theft
:(5) the offender breaks into an occupied residence,
and the theft is aggravated also when assessed as a whole, the offender shall be
sentenced for aggravated theft to imprisonment for at least four months and at most
four years.&lt;ref name="FI Code" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Sweden==
In [[Sweden]], burglary does not exist as an offence in itself; instead, there are two available offences. If a person simply breaks into any premise, they are technically guilty of either unlawful intrusion ({{lang|sv|olaga intrång}}) or breach of domiciliary peace ({{lang|sv|hemfridsbrott}}), depending on the premise in question. Breach of domiciliary peace is applicable only when a person "unlawfully intrudes or remains where another has his living quarters".&lt;ref name="1962-700"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Swedish Penal Code of 1962|work=|publisher=|year=1962|url=http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c6/02/77/77/cb79a8a3.pdf|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=2008-02-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320102018/http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c6/02/77/77/cb79a8a3.pdf|archive-date=2009-03-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only punishments available for any of these offences are fines, unless the offences are considered gross. In such cases, the maximum punishment is two years' imprisonment.

However, if the person who has forced themself into a house steals anything ("takes what belongs to another with intent to acquire it"), they are guilty of (ordinary) theft ({{lang|sv|stöld}}). However, the section regarding gross theft (Chapter 6, 4s of the Penal Code, {{lang|sv|grov stöld}}) states "in assessing whether the crime is gross, special consideration shall be given to whether the unlawful appropriation took place after intrusion into a dwelling."&lt;ref name="1962-700"/&gt; For theft, the punishment is imprisonment of at most two years, while gross theft carries a punishment of between six months and six years.

==United Kingdom==

===England and Wales===
{{main|Burglary in English law}}
Burglary is defined by section 9 of the [[Theft Act 1968]], which describes two variants:&lt;ref name="UKTheftAct19681"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/contents Theft Act 1968]&lt;/ref&gt;
#A person is guilty of burglary if they enter any building or part of a building as a trespasser with intent to steal, inflict [[grievous bodily harm]] or do unlawful damage to the building or anything in it.{{refn|Although as originally passed, the Theft Act 1968 also prohibited "raping any woman therein",&lt;ref name="UKTheftAct1968Enacted1"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/contents/enacted Theft Act 1968] (as enacted)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] repealed this prohibition and substituted the offence known as trespass with intent to commit a sexual offence.&lt;ref name="UKSexualOffencesAct20031"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42 Sexual Offences Act 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}}
#A person is guilty of burglary if, having entered a building or part of a building as a trespasser, he steals or attempts to steal anything in the building, or inflicts or attempts to inflict [[grievous bodily harm]] on any person in the building.

===Northern Ireland===
The offence is defined in similar terms to England and Wales by the Theft Act (Northern Ireland) 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Primary&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=2&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=2922491&amp;activetextdocid=2881784&amp;versionNumber=1|title=Theft Act (Northern Ireland) 1969 (Chapter 16) - Statute Law Database|publisher=www.statutelaw.gov.uk|accessdate=2010-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
Under [[Scots law]], the crime of burglary does not exist. Instead '''theft by housebreaking''' covers theft where the security of the building is overcome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nas.gov.uk/guides/legalTerms.asp "Index of legal terms and offences libelled".] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530035318/http://www.nas.gov.uk/guides/legalTerms.asp |date=May 30, 2012 }} National Archives of Scotland. Retrieved 7 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It does not include any other aspect of burglary found in England and Wales. It is a crime usually prosecuted under [[indictment|solemn procedure]] in a superior court. Another common law crime still used is [[Hamesuken]], which covers forced entry into a building where a serious assault on the occupant takes place. [[Common law]] crimes in Scotland are gradually being replaced by [[statutes]].

==United States==
In the United States, burglary is prosecuted as a [[felony]] or [[misdemeanor]] and involves [[trespassing]] and theft, entering a building or automobile, or loitering unlawfully with [[intent (law)|intent]] to commit '''''any''''' crime, not necessarily a theft--for example, [[vandalism]]. Even if nothing is stolen in a burglary, the act is a [[statutory offense]]. Buildings can include hangars, sheds, barns, and coops; burglary of boats, aircraft, trucks, and railway cars is possible. Burglary may be an element in crimes involving [[rape]], [[arson]], [[kidnapping]], [[identity theft]], or violation of [[civil rights]]; indeed, the "plumbers" of the [[Watergate scandal]] were technically burglars. As with all legal definitions in the U.S., the foregoing description may not be applicable in every jurisdiction, since there are 50 separate state criminal codes, plus federal and territorial codes in force.

===Home invasion===
Commission of a burglary with the intention or result of confronting persons on the premises may constitute an aggravated offense known as '''"home invasion."'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(azxcxmqdc5mrwlvitr5bkx2g))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&amp;objectname=mcl-750-110a|title=Michigan Legislature - Section 750.110a|website=www.legislature.mi.gov|access-date=2016-09-18}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nighttime burglaries===
In some states, a burglary committed during the hours of daylight is technically not burglary, but housebreaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/h/housebreaking/|title=Housebreaking Law &amp; Legal Definition|website=definitions.uslegal.com|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many jurisdictions in the U.S., burglary is punished more severely than housebreaking. In [[California]], for example, burglary was punished as burglary in the first degree, while housebreaking was punished as burglary in the second degree. California now distinguishes between entry into a residence and into a commercial building, with the burglary of a residence bearing heavier punishment.

In states that continue to punish burglary more severely than housebreaking [[twilight]], night is traditionally defined as hours between 30 minutes after sunset and 30 minutes before sunrise.

===Inchoate crime===
Some academics consider burglary an [[Inchoate offense|inchoate crime]].&lt;ref name=Schmalleger&gt;[[Frank Schmalleger]], ''Criminal Law Today: An Introduction with Capstone Cases,'' p. 110, (Upper Saddle River: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2006) {{ISBN|0-13-170287-4}}, citing [[Joshua Dressler]], ''Understanding Criminal Law,'' 2nd ed., (Boston:Matthew Bender, 1995), p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt; Others say that because the intrusion itself is harmful, this justifies punishment even when no further crime is committed.

{{quote|Burglary, as a preliminary step to another crime, can be seen as an inchoate, or incomplete, offense. As it disrupts the security of persons in their homes and in regard to their personal property, however, it is complete as soon as the intrusion is made. This dual nature is at the heart of a debate about whether the crime of burglary ought to be abolished and its elements covered by attempt or aggravating circumstances to other crimes—or retained, and the grading schemes reformed to reflect the seriousness of individual offenses.&lt;ref name=McCord&gt;[[James W.H. McCord]] and [[Sandra L. McCord]], ''Criminal Law and Procedure: A Systems Approach,'' 3rd ed. ([[Clifton Park, New York]]: Thomson Delmar Learning - West Legal Studies, 2006), p. 127. {{ISBN|978-1-4018-6564-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Possession of burglars's tools, in jurisdictions that make this an offense, has also been viewed as an inchoate crime:&lt;ref&gt;See Schmalleger, ''Supra'', p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|In effect piling an inchoate crime onto an inchoate crime, the possession of burglary tools with the intent to use them in a burglary is a serious offense, a felony in some jurisdictions. Gloves that a defendant was trying to shake off as he ran from the site of a burglary were identified as burglar's tools in ''Green v. State'' (Fla. App. 1991).&lt;ref name=McCord /&gt;}}

===Florida===
Under [[Florida law|Florida State Statutes]], "burglary" occurs when a person "enter[s] a dwelling, a structure, or a conveyance with the intent to commit an offense therein, unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the defendant is licensed or invited to enter."&lt;ref&gt;Fla. Stat. § 810.02(1)(b)1&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the circumstances of the crime, burglary can be classified as third, second, or first-degree felonies, with maximum sentences of five years, fifteen years, and life, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Fla. Stat. § 810.02(2)-(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Georgia===
A person commits the offense of burglary when, without authority and with the intent to commit a felony or theft therein, he enters or remains within the dwelling house of another or any building, vehicle, railroad car, watercraft, or other such structure designed for use as the dwelling of another or enters or remains within any other building, railroad car, aircraft, or any room or any part thereof. A person convicted of the offense of burglary, for the first such offense, shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than one nor more than 20 years. For the purposes of this Code section, the term "railroad car" shall also include trailers on flatcars, containers on flatcars, trailers on railroad property, or containers on railroad property. O.C.G.A. § 16-7-1

===Kentucky===
Burglary and the intended crime, if carried out, are treated as separate offenses. Burglary is a felony, even when the intended crime is a misdemeanor, and the intent to commit the crime can occur when one "enters or remains unlawfully" in the building, expanding the common-law definition. It has three degrees. Third-degree burglary is the broadest, and applies to any building or other premises. Second-degree burglary retains the common-law element of a dwelling, and first-degree burglary requires that the accused be in a dwelling and armed with a weapon or have intent to cause injury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrc.state.ky.us/KRS/511-00/CHAPTER.HTM KRS 511.010-511.040]&lt;/ref&gt; A related offense, criminal trespass, covers unlawful entry to buildings or premises without the intent to commit a crime, and is a misdemeanor or, in the third degree, a violation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrc.state.ky.us/KRS/511-00/CHAPTER.HTM KRS 511.060-511.080]&lt;/ref&gt; Possession of burglar's tools, with the intent to use them to commit burglary or theft, is a misdemeanor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrc.state.ky.us/KRS/511-00/CHAPTER.HTM KRS 511.050]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Massachusetts===
The Commonwealth of [[Massachusetts]] uses the term "burglary" to refer to a night-time breaking and entering of a dwelling with the intent to commit a felony. Burglary is a felony punishable by not more than twenty years; should the burglar enter with a dangerous weapon, they may be imprisoned for life.&lt;ref&gt;Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266 §§ 14-5&lt;/ref&gt; Unlawful entries of a structure other than a dwelling are labeled "breaking and entering" and punishments vary according to structure.&lt;ref&gt;Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266 §§ 16-9, 20A&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maryland===
In Maryland, under title 6, subtitle 2 of the criminal law code, the crime of burglary is divided into four degrees. The first three degrees are felonies, while fourth-degree burglary is a misdemeanor.&lt;ref&gt;Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law § 6-202 (LexisNexis, Lexis Advance through 2018 Regular Session)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law § 6-203 (LexisNexis, Lexis Advance through 2018 Regular Session)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law § 6-204 (LexisNexis, Lexis Advance through 2018 Regular Session)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law § 6-205 (LexisNexis, Lexis Advance through 2018 Regular Session)&lt;/ref&gt; Breaking and entering into a dwelling with intent to commit theft or a crime of violence is first-degree burglary. Breaking and entering into a "storehouse" (a structure other than a dwelling, also including watercraft, aircraft, railroad cars, and vessels) with intent to commit theft, arson, or a crime of violence is second-degree burglary. Third-degree burglary is defined as breaking and entering into a dwelling with intent to commit a crime.

Simple breaking and entering into a dwelling or storehouse without [[specific intent]] to commit an additional crime is fourth-degree burglary. This degree also includes two other offenses that do not have breaking and entering as an element: Being in or on the yard, garden, or other property of a storehouse or dwelling with the intent to commit theft, or possession of burglar's tools with the intent to use them in a burglary offense.

===New Hampshire===
In the criminal code of [[New Hampshire]], "A person is guilty of burglary if he enters a building or occupied structure, or separately secured or occupied section thereof, with purpose to commit a crime therein, unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the actor is licensed or privileged to enter."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/LXII/635/635-1.htm  Section 635:1, NH Revised Statutes]&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York===
Under the [[New York Penal Law]], burglary is always a felony, even in third degree.&lt;ref&gt;Burglary in the third degree, N.Y. Penal Law section 140.20, found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS NY Laws]. Accessed May 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is more serious if the perpetrator uses what appears to be a dangerous weapon or enters a dwelling.&lt;ref&gt;Burglary in the second degree, N.Y.

===Pennsylvania===
In Pennsylvania, it is a defense to prosecution if the building or structure in question is rendered abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Pennsylvania Criminal Code:Burglary - 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 3502 [http://law.onecle.com/pennsylvania/crimes-and-offenses/00.035.002.000.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506151922/http://law.onecle.com/pennsylvania/crimes-and-offenses/00.035.002.000.html |date=2011-05-06 }}. Accessed April 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virginia===
In Virginia, there are degrees of burglary, described as "Common Law Burglary" and "Statutory Burglary".

Common Law Burglary is defined as: if any person breaks and enters the dwelling of another, in the nighttime, with intent to commit a felony or any larceny (theft &lt; $200) therein, shall be guilty of burglary, punishable as a class 3 felony; provided, however, that if such person was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of such entry, he shall be guilty of a class 2 felony.

Statutory Burglary is defined as: If any person in the nighttime enters without breaking, or in the daytime breaks and enters or enters and conceals himself in a dwelling house or an adjoining, occupied outhouse, or, in the nighttime enters without breaking or at any time breaks and enters or enters and conceals himself in any office, shop, manufactured home, storehouse, warehouse, banking house, church or other house, or any ship, vessel or river craft, or any railroad car, or any automobile, truck, or trailer, if such automobile, truck or trailer is used as a dwelling or place of human habitation, with intent to commit murder, rape, robbery or arson in violation of Virginia State code section 18.2-77, 18.2-79, or 18.2-80, shall be deemed guilty of statutory burglary, which offense shall be a class 3 felony. However, if such person was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of such entry, he shall be guilty of a class 2 felony.

Additionally, if any person commits any of the acts mentioned in the VA state code section 18.2-90 with intent to commit larceny, or any felony other than murder, rape, robbery or arson in violation of VA state code section 18.2-77, 18.2-79, or 18.2-80, or if any person commits any acts mentioned in 18.2-89 or 18.2-90 with intent to commit assault and battery, shall be guilty of statutory burglary, punishable by confinement in a state correctional facility for not less than one or more than twenty years, or, in the discretion of the jury or the court trying the case without a jury, be confined in jail for a period not exceeding twelve months or fined not more than $2,500, either or both. However, if the person was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of such entry, he shall be guilty of a Class 2 felony.

Finally, if any person break and enter a dwelling house while said dwelling is occupied, either in the day  or nighttime, with intent to commit any misdemeanor except assault and battery or trespass (which falls under the previous paragraph), shall be guilty of a class 6 felony. However, if the person was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of such entry, he shall be guilty of a class 2 felony.

===Wisconsin===
In Wisconsin, burglary is committed by one who forcibly enters a building without consent and with intent to steal or to commit another felony. Burglary may also be committed by entry to a locked truck, car or trailer or a ship.&lt;ref&gt;Sec. 943.10(1m) Wisconsin Statutes (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The crime of burglary is treated as being more serious if the burglar is armed with a dangerous weapon when the burglary is committed or arms himself/herself during the commission of the burglary.&lt;ref&gt;Sec. 943.10(2) Wisconsin Statutes (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protection against burglars==
Protection of a household against burglars can include defences from [[anti-burglar paint]] through [[safety and security window film]] to [[burglar-proof door]]s and windows and [[burglar alarm]]s. A little over half of burglars would bypass a house if they thought it had alarm protection. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://airef.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/BurglarSurveyStudyFinalReport.pdf|title=Understanding Decisions to Burglarize from the Offender's Perspective|last=Blevins|first=Kristie|last2=Kuhns|first2=Joseph|last3=Lee|first3=Seungmug|publisher=UNC Charlotte|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dog]]s of any size can warn residents through loud barking, with larger dogs posing a threat of [[dog attack|severe injury]] to an intruder. The victim may also rightfully use [[self-defence]] in many jurisdictions.

In case of a burglar entering the house, secret stores can help protect against theft. Ordinary places such as boxes, tables, and cabinets are prime targets of the burglar. It's recommended to leave fake money and jewelry in these places, which can help to preserve real valuables.

After a crime has been committed, tactics such as cocooning have been shown to dramatically reduce the incidence of repeat offences. Cocooning involves notifying neighbours in the street that a break and enter has occurred, thereby encouraging a form of natural surveillance. Studies show this may decrease the rate of property crime by up to 50% in the local area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://attikis.com/HomeSecurity/cocooning.html "Cocooning for Home Security"] Explanation and sample of Cocooning in practice.Broken link!&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==

=== Burglaries by country ===

The [[UNODC]] notes "that when using the figures, any cross-national comparisons should be conducted with caution because of the differences that exist between the legal definitions of offences in countries, or the different methods of offence counting and recording". Also not every crime is reported and the rate of reported crimes may vary by countries.

'''Crush syndrome''' (also '''''traumatic [[rhabdomyolysis]]''''' or '''''Bywaters' syndrome''''') is a medical condition characterized by major [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] and [[renal failure]] after a [[wikt:crush|crushing]] injury to [[skeletal muscle]]. [[Crush injury|Crush ''injury'']] is compression of extremities or other parts of the body that causes muscle swelling and/or neurological disturbances in the affected areas of the body, while crush ''syndrome'' is localized crush injury with systemic manifestations.&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://www.acep.org/uploadedFiles/ACEP/Practice_Resources/disater_and_EMS/disaster_preparedness/BlastInjury_Crush_Eng.pdf | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control]] | title = Blast Injuries: Crush Injury &amp; Crush Syndrome}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases occur commonly in catastrophes such as [[earthquake]]s, to victims that have been trapped under fallen or moving masonry.

Victims of crushing damage present some of the greatest challenges in [[field medicine]], and may be among the few situations where a physician is needed in the field. The most drastic response to crushing under massive objects may be field [[amputation]]. Even if it is possible to extricate the patient without amputation, appropriate physiological preparation is mandatory: where [[permissive hypotension]] is the standard for [[prehospital care]], [[fluid loading]] is the requirement in crush syndrome.

==Pathophysiology==
[[Seigo Minami]], a Japanese physician, first reported the crush syndrome in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Minami |first=Seigo |year=1923 |title=Über Nierenveränderungen nach Verschüttung |journal=Virchows Arch. Patho. Anat. |volume=245 |issue=1 |pages= 247|doi=10.1007/BF01992107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Medical discoveries - Who and when- Schmidt JF. Springfield: CC Thomas, 1959. p.115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morton's medical bibliography -An annotated check-list of texts illustrating History of medicine (Garrison-Morton). Aldershot: Solar Press; 1911. p.654.&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied the pathology of three soldiers who died in World War I from insufficiency of the kidney. The renal changes were due to [[methemoglobin]] infarction, resulting from the destruction of muscles, which is also seen in persons who are buried alive. The progressive acute renal failure is because of acute tubular necrosis.

The syndrome was later described by British [[physician]] [[Eric Bywaters]] in patients during the 1941 London [[The Blitz|Blitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WhoNamedIt|synd|3870}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bywaters |first=E. G. |last2=Beall |first2=D. |title=Crush injuries with impairment of renal function |journal=[[British Medical Journal|Br Med J]] |year=1941 |volume=1 |issue=4185 |pages=427–432 |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.4185.427 |pmid=20783577 |pmc=2161734}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a [[reperfusion injury]] that appears after the release of the crushing pressure. The mechanism is believed to be the release into the bloodstream of muscle breakdown products—notably [[myoglobin]], [[potassium]] and [[phosphorus]]—that are the products of [[rhabdomyolysis]] (the breakdown of skeletal muscle damaged by [[ischemia|ischemic]] conditions).

The specific action on the [[kidney]]s is not understood completely, but may be due partly to [[nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxic]] [[metabolite]]s of myoglobin.

The most devastating systemic effects can occur when the crushing pressure is suddenly released, without proper preparation of the patient, causing '''reperfusion syndrome'''. In addition to tissue directly suffering the crush mechanism, down stream tissue is subject to [[ischemia-reperfusion injury of the appendicular musculoskeletal system]]. Without proper preparation, the patient, with pain control, may be cheerful before extrication, but die shortly thereafter. This sudden decompensation is called the "smiling death."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Nancy Caroline's Emergency Care in the Streets: Trauma Medical | author = Nancy Caroline | volume = 2 | edition = 6th |year= 2007 | isbn =  9780763742393 | pages = 19–13 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=f3ePQZDXpwwC&amp;pg=PT115&amp;lpg=PT115&amp;dq=%22Crush+injury%22+smiling+death#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Crush%20injury%22%20smiling%20death&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These systemic effects are caused by a traumatic [[rhabdomyolysis]]. As muscle cells die, they absorb sodium, water and calcium; the rhabdomyolysis releases [[potassium]], [[myoglobin]], [[phosphate]], [[thromboplastin]], [[creatine]] and [[creatine kinase]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Treatment==
Due to the risk of crush syndrome, current recommendation to lay first-aiders (in the UK) is to not release victims of crush injury who have been trapped for more than 15 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;St John Ambulance UK First Aid Manual, 10th Edition, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;  Treatment consists of not releasing the [[tourniquet]] and fluid overloading the patient with added Dextran 4000 iu and slow release of pressure. If pressure is released during first aid then fluid is restricted and an input-output chart for the patient is maintained, and proteins are decreased in the diet.

The Australian Resuscitation Council recommended in March 2001 that first-aiders in Australia, where safe to do so, release the crushing pressure as soon as possible, avoid using a tourniquet and continually monitor the vital signs of the patient.&lt;ref name="ARC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.resus.org.au/policy/guidelines/section_9/emergency_management_of_crushed.htm |title=Emergency Management of a Crushed Victim |date=March 2001 |work= |publisher=Australian Resuscitation Council |accessdate=20 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026122416/http://www.resus.org.au/policy/guidelines/section_9/emergency_management_of_crushed.htm |archivedate=26 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St John Ambulance Australia]] First Responders are trained in the same manner.
&lt;!-- these two recommendations seem contradictory to each other ~~~~ --&gt;

===Field management===
As mentioned, permissive hypotension is unwise. Especially if the crushing weight is on the patient more than 4 hours, but often if it persists more than one hour, careful fluid overload is wise, as well as the administration of intravenous [[sodium bicarbonate]]. The San Francisco emergency services protocol calls for a basic adult dose of a 2 L bolus of [[normal saline]] followed by 500&amp;nbsp;ml/h, limited for "pediatric patients and patients with history of cardiac or renal dysfunction." &lt;ref name=SF&gt;{{Cite journal | publisher = San Francisco Emergency Medical Services Agency | date = 1 July 2002 | id = Protocol: #P-101 | title = Crush Syndrome | url = http://firespecialops.com/files/2010/02/San-Fran-EMS-Crush-Protocol.pdf | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

If the patient cannot be fluid loaded, this may be an indication for a [[tourniquet]] to be applied.

===Initial hospital management===
The clinician must protect the patient against [[hypotension]], [[renal failure]], [[acidosis]], [[hyperkalemia]] and [[hypocalcemia]]. Admission to an [[intensive care unit]], preferably one experienced in [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma medicine]], may be appropriate; even well-seeming patients need observation. Treat open wounds as surgically appropriate, with debridement, antibiotics and tetanus toxoid; apply ice to injured areas.

Intravenous hydration of up to 1.5 L/hour should continue to prevent hypotension.  A urinary output of at least 300 ml/hour should be maintained with IV fluids and [[mannitol]], and [[hemodialysis]] considered if this amount of diuresis is not achieved. Use intravenous [[sodium bicarbonate]] to keep the urine pH at 6.5 or greater, to prevent myoglobin and uric acid deposition in kidneys.

To prevent hyperkalemia/hypocalcemia, consider the following adult doses:&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;
*[[calcium gluconate]] 10% 10ml or [[calcium chloride]] 10% 5 ml IV over 2 minutes
*[[sodium bicarbonate]] 1 meq/kg IV slow push
*regular [[insulin]] 5–10 U 
*50% [[glucose]] 1–2 ampules IV bolus
*[[kayexalate]] 25–50 g  with sorbitol 20% 100 ml by mouth or rectum. 
Even so, cardiac arrhythmias may develop; electrocardiographic monitoring is advised, and specific treatment begun promptly.

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], the '''Fordicidia''' was a [[Roman festivals|festival]] of fertility, held on the Ides of April (April 13), that pertained to [[Roman agriculture|farming]] and [[animal husbandry]]. It involved the [[animal sacrifice|sacrifice]] of a pregnant cow to [[Terra (mythology)|Tellus]], the [[List of Roman deities|ancient Roman goddess]] of the [[Earth Mother|Earth]], in proximity to the festival of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] ([[Cerealia]]) on April 19.&lt;ref name=BEARD45&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A History'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2rtaTFYuM3QC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=Fordicidia&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=37#v=onepage&amp;q=Fordicidia&amp;f=false p. 45.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[Fasti|Roman religious calendar]], the month of April ''([[Aprilis]])'' was in general preoccupied with deities who were female or ambiguous in gender, opening with the [[Veneralia|Feast of Venus]] on the [[Kalends]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Several other festivals pertaining to farm life were held in April: the [[Parilia]], a feast of shepherds, on April 21; the [[Robigalia]] on April 25, to protect crops from blight;&lt;ref name=BEARD45 /&gt; and the [[Vinalia]], one of the two wine festivals on the calendar,&lt;ref&gt;The other was held August 19.&lt;/ref&gt; at the end of the month. Of these, the Fordicidia and Robigalia are likely to have been of greatest antiquity. [[William Warde Fowler]], whose early 20th-century work on Roman festivals remains a standard reference, asserted that the Fordicidia was "beyond doubt one of the oldest sacrificial rites in Roman religion."&lt;ref name="Fowler, p. 71"&gt;Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacrifice and ritual==
The [[Roman Republic#Late Republic|late Republican]] scholar [[Varro]] explains the name of the festival as follows:

{{quote|The Fordicidia was named from ''fordae'' cows; a ''forda'' cow is one that is carrying an unborn calf; because on this day several pregnant cows are officially and publicly sacrificed in the ''[[curia]]e'', the festival was called the Fordicidia from ''fordae caedendae'', 'the pregnant cows which were to be slaughtered.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Varro]], ''De lingua latina'' 6.15, English translation as quoted by Christopher John Smith, ''The Roman Clan: The'' [[gens]] ''from Ancient Ideology to Modern Anthropology'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 207, note 79 [https://books.google.com/books?id=m2-G6PQxWo0C&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=Fordicidia&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=29#v=onepage&amp;q=Fordicidia&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Faunus Vienna Ma528.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Faunus]]
The forms ''horda'' and ''Hordicalia'' are also found.&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''De re rustica'' 2.5.6.; Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many other aspects of [[Roman law]] and religion,&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Religious Experience of the Roman People'' (London, 1922), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; the institution of the Fordicidia was attributed to [[Numa Pompilius]], the [[Sabines|Sabine]] second [[king of Rome]]. The rustic god [[Faunus]] instructed Numa [[incubation (ritual)|in a dream]] that a sacrifice to Tellus would mitigate the harsh agricultural conditions Rome was grappling with, but the oracular message required interpretation: "By the death of cattle, King, Tellus must be placated: two cows, that is. Let a single heifer yield two lives ''(animae)'' for the rites."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (Ovid)|Fasti]]'' 4.641–666: ''morte boum tibi, rex, Tellus placanda duarum: / det sacris animas una iuvenca duas''.&lt;/ref&gt; Numa solved the riddle by instituting the sacrifice of a pregnant cow.&lt;ref&gt;Vyacheslav V. Ivanov, "Fundamentals of Diachronic Linguistics", ''Semiotics around the World: Synthesis in Diversity'' (Mouton de Gruyter, 1994), vol. 1, pp. 64–66, with discussion of [[Vedic]] and [[Hittite religion|Hittite]] parallels.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other rituals in which public cult was mirrored by private, or ''vice versa'', one sacrifice was conducted on behalf of the [[Roman State|state]], in this case at the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitol]], and one in each of the thirty ''curiae'', the most ancient divisions of the city made by [[Romulus]] from the original three tribes. This was the first of two festivals involving the ''curiae'', the other being the [[Fornacalia]] on February 17, which differed in that there was no ritual of state corresponding to the local ceremonies&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', pp. 71 and 303; Smith, ''The Roman Clan'', pp. 206–207.&lt;/ref&gt; and its [[Moveable feast|moveable]] date was fixed annually by the ''[[curio maximus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.H. Scullard]], ''History of the Roman World 753 to 146 BC'' (Routledge, 1980), p. 68 [https://books.google.com/books?id=a9XqPMV-Wj0C&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=%22curio+maximus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22curio%20maximus%22&amp;f=false online]; Kurt A. Raaflaub, ''Social Struggles in Archaic Rome: New Perspectives on the [[Conflict of the Orders]]'' (Blackwell, 1986, 2005), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chief Vestal.jpg|thumb|150px|''Virgo Vestalis Maxima'', the high priestess of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]]]]
In the state sacrifice for the Fordicidia, the unborn calf was wrenched from its mother's womb by the attendants of the ''Virgo Vestalis Maxima'', or [[Vestal Virgin|Vestal]] Maxima, and [[holocaust (sacrifice)|burnt]]. Its ashes were preserved by the Vestals and used as one of the ingredients in the ritual substance ''suffimen'', along with the dried blood of the [[October Horse]] from the previous year, and the stalks from which beans had been harvested.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'' 4.731–734; Daniel P. Harmon, "Religion in the Latin Elegists", ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' 2.16.3 (1986), p. 1958 [https://books.google.com/books?id=eOe3Fv1UUKoC&amp;pg=PA1957&amp;dq=Fordicidia&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=33#v=onepage&amp;q=Fordicidia&amp;f=false online]; Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''suffimen'' was sprinkled on the bonfires of the [[Parilia]], the festival devoted to purifying shepherds and their sheep, and later celebrated also as the "birthday" of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', ''Religions of Rome'' pp. 53 and 383.&lt;/ref&gt; The sacrifice at the Fordicidia and preparation of the ''suffimen'' constituted the first public ceremony of the year in which the Vestals played an active role.&lt;ref name="Fowler, p. 71"/&gt;

==Meaning==
The purpose of the sacrifice, as suggested by the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan]] poet [[Ovid]] in his [[Fasti (Ovid)|elegiac calendar]] and by the 6th-century [[antiquarian]] [[John Lydus]] in his book ''On the Months'',&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'' 4.633f.; [[John Lydus]], ''De Mensibus'' 4.49, drawing on Varro, as noted by Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; was to assure the fertility of the planted grain already growing in the womb of Mother Earth in the guise of Tellus, to whom the sacrifice was offered. As with certain other rituals over which the Vestals presided, the unborn calf is a [[liminality|liminal]] or [[structuralism|mediating]] being: not yet born, but living; not a full-fledged victim, but sacrificed. The role of the Vestals emphasizes their importance in linking through the ritual reuse of elements the Earth's fertility, the health and safety of the flocks, and the security of the city, including and especially its military security against invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', ''Religions of Rome'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fordicidia, along with about half the festivals of Republican Rome, does not appear on the [[Chronography of 354|calendar of 354]], when the [[Roman Empire|empire]] was becoming [[Christianized]].&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', ''Religions of Rome'', p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison==
In the spirit of the [[Cambridge Ritualists]] and [[Comparative mythology|comparative mythologists]], Fowler pointed to a [[Chinese folk religion#Overview|Chinese spring festival]] witnessed in 1804 by the [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to China|British ambassador to China]], [[Sir John Barrow, 1st Baronet|John Barrow]]. At the temple of Earth, a large porcelain cow was carried in procession then shattered to reveal several small cow-images inside. These were distributed among the people as tokens of a good growing season. Fowler speculated that the Chinese rite was in origin an animal sacrifice similar to that of the Fordicidia.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Fulton [[Opera]] House''', also known as the '''Fulton Theatre''' or simply '''The Fulton''', is a League of Regional Theatres class B regional theater located in historic downtown [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]]. It is reportedly the oldest working theatre in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0K1dAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fl0NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1243%2C1139567 | title=Exploring the quaint towns and villages of Lancaster County | work=Observer-Reporter | date=Jun 5, 1988 | accessdate=28 October 2015 | pages=F8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1964.

==Building==
Fulton Hall is named after [[Robert Fulton]] (1765-1815), Lancaster County's steam engine pioneer, and it is his likeness that is portrayed in the statue on the front facade. This statue is a replica of the original wooden statue, which has since been restored and now resides on display inside the interior lobby. The building itself was built on the foundation of Lancaster's pre-Revolutionary jail. In 1763, a vigilante gang known as the [[Paxton Boys]] massacred the [[Susquehannock|Conestoga Indian]]s being held there for their protection. This was a monumental event throughout the colonies and became the subject matter for the first plays ever written on American soil - "A Dialogue Between Andrew Trueman and Thomas Zealot About the Killing the Indians at Cannestogoe and Lancaster" and "The Paxton Boys, a Farce".{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The exterior wall of the jail courtyard is now the back wall of the theatre.
Christopher Hager, a Lancaster merchant and civic leader, commissioned the renowned Philadelphia architect [[Samuel Sloan (architect)|Samuel Sloan]]  (who later designed the Lancaster County Courthouse) to create a building that would serve as a community center for meetings, lectures, concerts, and theatrical performances. The building was erected in 1852.

The Fulton Theatre was later modified by noted theatrical architect [[Edwin Forrest Durang]], is one of only three theatres recognized as [[National Historic Landmark]]s (the others are the [[Walnut Street Theatre]] in [[Philadelphia]] and the [[Goldenrod (showboat)|Goldenrod Showboat]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]). 
The 1959 production of ''[[Our Town]]'', starring [[Jeanne Clemson]], marked that first time that a live theater production had been performed at the Fulton Opera House in thirty years.&lt;ref name=lancnews&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Holahan|title=Jeanne Clemson dies at 87|url=http://articles.lancasteronline.com/local/4/242238|work=[[Intelligencer Journal]]|publisher=|date=2009-09-15|accessdate=2009-10-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924030130/http://articles.lancasteronline.com/local/4/242238|archivedate=2009-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A founding member of the [http://www.lhat.org/ League of Historic American Theatres] (LHAT), the Fulton is operated by the Fulton Theatre Company, a non-profit organization.

As the Fulton is run on a non-profit basis, it depends on a variety of grants, corporate sponsorship, and private donations to accomplish its mission. The Fulton is an [[Actors' Equity Association|Equity]] House, operating under agreement with the Actor's Equity Association and the Union for Professional Actors and Stage Managers (which essentially means that its actors and production team are paid per collective bargaining agreements, as opposed to non-equity actors who are not paid per collective bargaining agreements or volunteers) and employs members of the [[Stage Directors and Choreographers Society]] and the United Scenic Artists.  The Fulton is also a member of [[ASSITEJ]], the International Association of Theatre for Children and Young People.

The Fulton Theatre is home to six mainstage productions per year including previous productions of Disney's ''Newsies'', ''In The Heights'', Agatha Christie's ''The Mousetrap, some of which are world premier originals (critically acclaimed ''Lightning Rod'', 2005); four family series productions, including the Fulton's own 'Twas the Night Before Christmas,'' ''Aladdin'', J''ack and the Beanstalk, the Musical'', and other theatre for young audiences productions; and four studio series productions, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning drama ''Disgraced'', along with other riveting productions like ''Venus in Fur'', ''Veronica's Room'' and ''Other Desert Cities''. Although most casting takes place in New York City, regional auditions are also held.  While many of The Fulton's regulars are [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]] natives who are delighted at the chance to return home to perform, nearly all quickly fall in love with the "Grand Old Lady" and her charm.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

In addition to providing a place of employment for professional actors, the Fulton Theatre Company is a complete production facility which employs full-time carpenters, electricians, scenic artists, painters, composers, lighting and sound technicians.  Most set pieces and costumes are created in-house or at an adjacent workshop, and makeup, hair, and [[Wig (hair)|wigs]] are created by a full-time designer.  The Fulton also maintains a costume shop which provides access to professional quality costumes and props to schools, community theatre companies, and other organizations throughout the region.  Its marketing department maintains a website that allows users to browse theatre history, check audition times, and purchase tickets. All posters and print materials, including production programs, are cataloged and archived by the Lancaster Historical Society.

Many famous actors have appeared at the Fulton.  In December 1930 [[Basil Rathbone]] appeared as Christian St. Obin in ''A Kiss of Importance''.  Peter Weir's film, "[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090329/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 Witness]," starring Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis, much of which represents the lifestyle of the Amish, [http://lancasteronline.com/features/throwback-thursday-witness-premiered-at-fulton-years-ago/article_50e9324c-b2d6-11e4-ae0c-17a87103bccf.html premiered here in February, 1985.]

'''''Gypsy''''' is a 1959 [[musical theatre|musical]] with music by [[Jule Styne]], lyrics by [[Stephen Sondheim]], and a book by [[Arthur Laurents]].  ''Gypsy'' is loosely based on the [[Gypsy: A Memoir|1957 memoirs]] of [[Gypsy Rose Lee]], the famous [[striptease]] artist, and focuses on her mother, [[Rose Thompson Hovick|Rose]], whose name has become synonymous with "the ultimate [[stage mother|show business mother]]." It follows the dreams and efforts of Rose to raise two daughters to perform onstage and casts an affectionate eye on the hardships of [[show business]] life. The character of Louise is based on Lee, and the character of June is based on Lee's sister, the actress [[June Havoc]].  &lt;!-- Note: The script identifies her only as Rose. She is called Madame Rose (professionally) or Mama (by her daughters) but nowhere in the show is she called "Mama Rose". --&gt;

The musical contains many songs that became popular standards, including "[[Everything's Coming up Roses]]", "[[Together (Wherever We Go)]]", "Small World", "[[You Gotta Get a Gimmick (song)|You Gotta Get a Gimmick]]", "[[Let Me Entertain You (Gypsy)|Let Me Entertain You]]", "All I Need Is the Girl", and "[[Rose's Turn]]". It is frequently considered one of the crowning achievements of the mid-20th century's conventional musical theatre art form, often called the "[[book musical]]".

''Gypsy'' has been referred to as the greatest American musical by numerous critics and writers, among them [[Ben Brantley]] ("what may be the greatest of all American musicals...")&lt;ref name="times"&gt;Brantley, Ben. [http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9c00e0db163cf931a35756c0a9659c8b63 "New Momma Takes Charge"]. ''The New York Times''.

==Background==
A musical based on the memoirs of Gypsy Rose Lee was a project of producer [[David Merrick]] and actress [[Ethel Merman]]. Merrick had read a chapter of Lee's memoirs in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' and approached Lee to obtain the rights. [[Jerome Robbins]] was interested, and wanted [[Leland Hayward]] as co-producer; Merman also wanted Hayward to produce her next show.&lt;ref&gt;Millstein, Gilbert (May 17, 1959) "Culled From a Stripper's Past", ''The New York Times'', p. X1&lt;/ref&gt; Merrick and Hayward approached [[Arthur Laurents]] to write the book. As he relates, Laurents initially was not interested until he saw that the story was one of parents living their children's lives. Composers [[Irving Berlin]] and [[Cole Porter]] declined the project. Finally, Robbins asked [[Stephen Sondheim]], who agreed to do it. Sondheim had worked with Robbins and Laurents on the musical ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]''. However, Merman did not want an unknown composer, and wanted [[Jule Styne]] to write the music. Although Sondheim initially refused to write only the lyrics, he was persuaded by [[Oscar Hammerstein II|Oscar Hammerstein]] to accept the job.&lt;ref name=zadan&gt;Zadan, Craig  (1986) ''Sondheim &amp; Co.'', Second Edition, pp.37-39, pp.50-51, {{ISBN|0-06-015649-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
Rose and her two daughters, Baby June and Louise, play the [[vaudeville]] circuit around the United States in the early 1920s. Rose, the archetype of a [[stage mother]], is aggressive and domineering, pushing her children to perform. While June is an extroverted, talented child star, the older girl, Louise, is shy. The kiddie act has one song, "[[Let Me Entertain You (Gypsy)|May We Entertain You]]", that they sing over and over again, with June always as the centerpiece and Louise often as one of the "boys" ("Baby June and Her Newsboys"). Rose has big dreams for the girls but encounters setbacks, such as attempting to borrow money from her father ("Some People"). When Rose meets a former agent, Herbie, she persuades him to become their manager using her seductive and feminine wiles ("Small World"). The girls grow up, and June, now billed as Dainty June, and her act have a chance to perform for Mr. Goldstone of the Orpheum Circuit ("Mr. Goldstone, I Love You"). Meanwhile, Louise celebrates her birthday alone and asks her birthday present, a lamb, just how old she is this year ("Little Lamb"). After Rose rejects Herbie's marriage proposal, he considers leaving, but she asserts that he could never get away from her ("You'll Never Get Away From Me").

Now billed as "Dainty June and Her Farmboys", the act finally performs on the Orpheum Circuit ("Dainty June and Her Farmboys"). June is soon offered a place at a Performing Arts school after an audition. However, Rose turns this down, refusing to break up the act. Louise and June fantasize what life would be like if Rose were married and finished with show business ("If Momma Was Married"). A few months later, still on the road from show to show, Tulsa, one of the boys from the act, confides in Louise that he has been working on his own act ("All I Need Is the Girl"), and Louise fantasizes that she and he could do the act together. Shortly after, June is missing, and in a note, she explains that she has grown sick of her mother and the endless tour and has eloped with Tulsa, and they will do a new act. Rose is hurt, but then optimistically vows that she will make ''Louise'' a star, proclaiming that "[[Everything's Coming up Roses]]".

===Act II===
Louise is now a young woman, and Rose has built a pale imitation of the Dainty June act for her. Using all girls, Rose and Herbie try valiantly to sell "Madame Rose's Toreadorables" to a fading [[vaudeville]] industry. However, they are still together ("[[Together (Wherever We Go)|Together, Wherever We Go]]"). With no vaudeville venues left, Louise and her second-rate act wind up accidentally booked at a [[American burlesque|burlesque]] house in [[Wichita, Kansas]], as a means to deter police raids. Rose is anguished, as she sees what a booking in burlesque means to her dreams of success, but Louise persuades her that two weeks' pay for the new act is better than unemployment. As they are introduced to Louise, three of the strippers on the bill advise her on what it takes to be a successful stripper, a "gimmick," something that "makes your strip special" ("[[You Gotta Get a Gimmick (song)|You Gotta Get a Gimmick]]"). Backstage, Rose proposes marriage to Herbie. He asks her to break up the act and let Louise have a normal life, and she reluctantly accepts, agreeing to marry the day after their show closes. On the last day of the booking, the star stripper in the burlesque show is arrested for [[solicitation]]. Desperate, Rose cannot resist the urge to give Louise another nudge toward stardom, and she volunteers Louise to do the [[strip tease]] as a last-minute replacement. Disgusted at Rose's blind ambition for her daughter, Herbie walks out on Rose forever ("Small World (Reprise)"). Although reluctant, Louise wants to please her mother and she goes on, assured by Rose that she needn't actually strip, but simply walk elegantly and tease by dropping a single shoulder strap. Shy and hesitant, she sings a titillating version of the old kiddie act song, "May We Entertain You?". She removes only her glove, but she speaks directly to her 'audience', which becomes her "gimmick" ("[[Let Me Entertain You (Gypsy)|Let Me Entertain You]] (Gypsy Strip Tease)").

In the months that follow Louise becomes secure, always following her mother's advice to "Make 'em beg for more, and then don't give it to them!" The song becomes brasher and brassier, and more and more articles of clothing come off. Ultimately, Louise becomes a major burlesque star and does not need her mother any longer. After a bitter argument between Rose and Louise, who has become the sophisticated "Gypsy Rose Lee," Rose realizes Herbie and June are both gone, and now Louise is lost to her as well. Rose, feeling sad, useless and bitter, asks "Why did I do it? What did it get me?" ("[[Rose's Turn]]"). All of Rose's unrequited dreams of her own stardom and her personal demons surface. She fantasizes about her own lit-up runway and cheering audience, but finally admits "I did it for me."  After her admission to Louise, mother and daughter tentatively step toward reconciliation in the end.

*In the 1974 and 2008 Broadway revivals, although the final dialogue scene remains, there is not a happy ending, but rather a bleak, sad one as all hopes of reconciliation for Rose and Louise fall flat when Louise walks away, laughing sarcastically at Rose's new "dream." The audience is then left with a Rose whose dream of her own lit up marquee slowly fades away to her craziness within taking over.
*In the 2003 revival starring Bernadette Peters, the final dialogue scene remains, but leaves the ending open to more interpretation from the audience. Louise walks through the stage door, with Rose following behind. Rose then turns to face the audience, a look of sadness and longing on her face as she takes one last look at the empty stage. She pauses and slowly closes the door.
*In the 2015 West End revival starring Imelda Staunton, Louise begins to walk out, and Rose catches up after waking up to reality. Louise puts her arm around Rose as they exit together, giving off the appearance that Louise is taking care of Rose instead.

===Notes on songs===
{{notelist-lr|group=note}}
During the pre-Broadway tryout tour, several songs were cut, including a song for Herbie called "Nice She Ain't" (cut because it was given to [[Jack Klugman]] one week prior to opening and he could not memorize the keys and staging in time),&lt;ref name=zadan /&gt; and a song for Baby June and Baby Louise titled "Mama's Talkin' Soft". The latter song was cut partly because the staging required the little girls to stand on a platform elevated above the stage, which terrified the young actress playing Baby Louise and partly because the show was running too long.&lt;ref name=zadan /&gt; "Mama's Talkin' Soft" was later recorded by [[Petula Clark]] and released as a single in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petulaclark.net/discography/discog5659.html "Petula Clark discography"]. PetulaClark.net&lt;/ref&gt; Other cut songs include "Mother's Day", a song for Baby June's act, "Smile, Girls", which involves Rose trying to teach the untalented girls to smile in order to make the act look good, "Who Needs Him?", which Rose sings to herself after Herbie leaves her, and "Three Wishes for Christmas", a burlesque number similar to one that would be performed at [[Minsky's Burlesque]].&lt;ref&gt;Sondheim, Stephen, ''Finishing the Hat'', New York: Alfred Knopf, 2010 p. 58-77 {{ISBN|978-0-679-43907-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dramatic analysis==
In analyzing the character of Rose, Clive Barnes described her as "bossy, demanding, horrific".&lt;ref name="barnes" /&gt;  Rich described Rose as "a monster".&lt;ref name="rich" /&gt; Critic [[Walter Kerr]] commented that though Rose is a monster, she must be liked and understood.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, Walter. "Two Musicals We Need Have Checked In". ''The New York Times''. December 17, 1989. p. H7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patti LuPone]] describes Rose: "She has tunnel vision, she's driven, and she loves her kids.... And she is a survivor.  I do not see her as a monster at all—she may do monstrous things, but that does not make a monster."&lt;ref&gt;Lunden, Jeff. [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89512165 "Stage Mother from Hell: Needy, Greedy Mama Rose"]. [[NPR.org]]. April 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Sondheim has said of the character: "The fact that she's monstrous to her daughters and the world is secondary... She's a very American character, a gallant figure and a life force."&lt;ref name=Rich1&gt;Rich, Frank. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E3DD113DF937A35756C0A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 "Theatre – 'Gypsy': Then, Now and Always"]. ''The New York Times''. May 4, 2003. p.AR1 (Retrieved May 6, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Sondheim also noted, "Yet the end of ''Gypsy'' is not entirely bleak. Louise comes out a star and forgives her mother.  There is hope for her.  Rose does confront who she is in 'Rose's Turn.' There is a catharsis. It's not Rodgers and Hammerstein, but you feel maybe the mother and daughter will come to an understanding and maybe triumph over Rose's craziness and Louise's bitterness."&lt;ref name=Rich1 /&gt;

Brantley noted that Rose is a "mythic character". She is "[t]raditionally presented as an armored tank on autopilot, which finally crashes only minutes before the final curtain".&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;

[[Bernadette Peters]]' take on the character was different: "Rose was a woman who was traumatized by her own mother leaving her at an early age. I think that longing for acceptance is what fuels all her ambition. In the end, when she confronts herself in 'Rose's Turn', she realizes she has failed her daughter just as her own mother failed her...and that destroys Rose. There is a vulnerability to Rose that makes her human, not just some loud and cartoonish parody of a stage mother."{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Productions==
===Original production===
The original Broadway production opened on May 21, 1959 at [[The Broadway Theatre]], transferred to the [[Imperial Theatre]], and closed on March 25, 1961 after 702 performances and two previews. The show was produced by [[David Merrick]] and directed and choreographed by [[Jerome Robbins]]. [[Ethel Merman]] starred as Rose, with [[Jack Klugman]] as Herbie and [[Sandra Church]] as Louise. Scenic and Lighting design were by [[Jo Mielziner]] and costumes were by [[Raoul Pène Du Bois]]. The orchestrations, including an overture,&lt;ref&gt;Kantor, Michael and Laurence Maslon, ''Broadway: The American Musical'', Bulfinch Press, New York, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; were supplied by [[Sid Ramin]] and [[Robert Ginzler]].

Critic Frank Rich has referred to Robbins' work as one of the most influential stagings of a musical in American theatrical history.&lt;ref name="rich" /&gt;  The original production received eight [[Tony Award]] nominations, including Best Musical, Best Actress in a Musical, Best Featured Actor in a Musical, Best Featured Actress in a Musical, Best Scenic Design, Best Costume Design and Best Direction of a Musical, but failed to win any.

When the show closed in March 1961, two national touring companies toured the US. The first company starred Merman and opened in March 1961 at the [[Rochester, New York]] Auditorium, and closed in December 1961 at the American, [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]. The second national company starred Mitzi Green as Rose, followed by Mary McCarty.  A young [[Bernadette Peters]] appeared in the ensemble and understudied Dainty June, a role she would play the following year in summer stock, opposite [[Betty Hutton]]'s Rose. It opened in September 1961 at the Shubert Theatre, [[Detroit]] and closed in January 1962 at the Hanna, [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].

===1973 London production===
In 1973, it was announced that [[Elaine Stritch]] would be starring in the first [[West End theatre|West End]] production of the show. However, when ticket sales proved to be unsuccessful, producers hired the more familiar [[Angela Lansbury]] (according to [[Craig Zadan]], "The ...producers were not able to raise the required capital on Stritch's name, and the promise of a new production...became ominously distant").&lt;ref&gt;Zadan, Craig. ''Sondheim &amp; Co.'' (1974, 1986 2nd Ed.), Harper &amp; Row, {{ISBN|0-06-015649-X}}, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; The West End production opened at the [[Piccadilly Theatre]] on May 29, 1973. It was produced by Barry M. Brown and Fritz Holt, in association with [[Edgar Lansbury (producer)|Edgar Lansbury]] (Angela's brother) and directed by the show's author, [[Arthur Laurents]], with choreography reproduced by Robert Tucker. The supporting cast featured Zan Charisse, [[Barrie Ingham]], Debbie Bowen and [[Bonnie Langford]]. Lansbury left the London production in December 1973 to tour the show in the USA and was succeeded by [[Dolores Gray]]. The production closed on March 2, 1974, after 300 performances.

===1974 Broadway revival===
Prior to opening on Broadway, the Lansbury West End production had a 24-week tour of North America, starting in Toronto, and then travelling to many cities, including Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Washington, DC and Boston.&lt;ref&gt;Berkvist, Robert. "The Stages Are Being Set--on Broadway and Around the Land". ''The New York Times'', p. 115, September 8, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; The production opened on Broadway at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] on September 23, 1974 for a planned limited engagement, and closed on January 4, 1975 after 120 performances and four previews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sondheimguide.com/gypsy.html "'Gypsy', 1974 Broadway Revival"]. sondheimguide.com, accessed July 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The cast remained mainly the same on Broadway, except that Rex Robbins played Herbie, [[Maureen Moore]] (later Bernadette Peters' understudy as Rose in the 2003 revival) played the adult June, and [[Mary Louise Wilson]] was Tessie Tura. Angela Lansbury won the 1975 [[Tony Award]].

===1989 Broadway revival===
A second revival had pre-Broadway engagements starting at the Jackie Gleason Theater of the Performing Arts, [[Miami Beach, Florida]], in May 1989,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Peter.

"An Uncommon 'Gypsy'; Tyne steps into Mama Rose's shoes; Memories of Merman dog Daly", ''USA TODAY''. p.1D. August 25, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

The production opened on Broadway on November 16, 1989, at the [[St. James Theatre]], and then moved to the [[Marquis Theatre]] on April 18, 1991 and closed on July 28, 1991 after 476 performances and 23 previews. Laurents returned as director, with [[Tyne Daly]] as Rose, [[Jonathan Hadary]] as Herbie and Crista Moore as Louise. [[Linda Lavin]] (on July 30, 1990) and [[Jamie Ross]] replaced Daly and Hadary respectively, with Daly returning to the production at the Marquis Theatre from April 18, 1991&lt;ref&gt;"Entertainment News", ''The Associated Press'', April 21, 1991, Dateline: New York&lt;/ref&gt; until closing.

This production won the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival]] and Daly won the [[Tony Award]] for Best Actress in a Musical for her performance.

Jule Styne, in a 1989 interview in connection with the California tryout, said: "About six months ago, Bette Midler wanted to buy it (''Gypsy'') for a movie.  We wouldn't sell it.  Because they'd only destroy it."&lt;ref name=styne /&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'' reported that "Both Liza Minnelli and Bernadette Peters say they would love to play it, but they weren't even approached for this production."&lt;ref name=usatoday /&gt;

===2003 Broadway revival===
A new Broadway revival began previews on March 31, 2003 and opened on May 1, 2003 at the [[Shubert Theatre (Broadway)|Shubert Theatre]]. The director was [[Sam Mendes]], with choreography by [[Jerry Mitchell]] and costumes and sets by Anthony Ward. [[Bernadette Peters]] played the role of Rose. ''The New York Times'' described Peters as "a surefire box office draw who nonetheless may surprise some ''Gypsy'' aficionados...How will the ladylike Ms. Peters fit into the role of Rose, a part indelibly marked by its brassy, belting originator, Ethel Merman?...'One of the main reasons I wanted to do the piece was to cast someone as Rose that was closer to Rose as she really existed,' Mr. Mendes said. 'She was a tiny woman. And she was a charmer. And so is Bernadette.'"&lt;ref&gt;McKinley, Jesse.

February 8, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Laurents had talked to Mendes ("Roughly five years ago" according to ''The New York Times'' in 2003) about directing the revival, and Mendes said "he was surprised by the idea of casting Ms. Peters as Rose".&lt;ref&gt;McKinley, Jesse.

Section E, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Laurents notes of his suggestions on this production are in his 2009 book ''Mainly on Directing 'Gypsy', 'West Side Story' and Other Musicals''. In a 2004 interview Laurents said that Peters' portrayal of Rose was "brilliant, original, totally unlike any of the others" while criticizing Mendes for the "physical production" which Laurents said "was misconceived and hurt the show more than people realized."&lt;ref&gt;Bryer, Jackson R.; Davison, Richard Allan. ''The art of the American musical: conversations with the creators'' (2005) Rutgers – the State University (NYC), {{ISBN|978-0-8135-3612-5}}, p.138&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gypsy'' had begun previews with a virtually bare stage, but by opening night this had been changed to a minimalist set.&lt;ref&gt;Kissel, Howard.

May 2, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The cast featured [[John Dossett]] as Herbie, [[Tammy Blanchard]] as Louise, [[Kate Reinders]] as June and [[David Burtka]] as Tulsa. The production was nominated for four [[Tony Awards]], including Best Revival of a Musical and Best Actress in a Musical.

In his review, [[Ben Brantley]] in ''The New York Times'' wrote that "the surprise coup of many a Broadway season...Working against type and expectation under the direction of Sam Mendes, Ms. Peters has created the most complex and compelling portrait of her long career...There have been many illustrious successors to Merman as Rose...Only Ms. Peters, however, can be said to have broken the Merman mold completely."&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben.

''Gypsy'' twice set new box office records for the Shubert Theatre. Its gross of $853,476 for the week of June 9–14, 2003 was the highest ever gross for a non-holiday week and the subsequent June 15–21, 2003 box office gross of $874,397 represented the highest gross for a show in Shubert history.&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew.

But by early January [2004], with tourists gone and local theatergoers staying inside during a brutal stretch of weather, the production's sales grew increasingly weak. More important, the show's advance sale, the main indicator of a production's staying power, began to shrink rapidly. It stood at less than $2 million yesterday."&lt;ref&gt;McKinley, Jesse.

===2008 Broadway revival===
[[Patti LuPone]] first portrayed Rose in ''Gypsy'' at the Chicago [[Ravinia Festival]] in August 2006, directed by [[Lonny Price]] and accompanied by the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew. [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/101346-Pattis-Turn-LuPone-Is-Mama-Rose-in-Ravinias-Gypsy-Beginning-Aug-11 Patti's Turn: LuPone Is Mama Rose in Ravinia's Gypsy Beginning Aug. 11"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019192817/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/101346-Pattis-Turn-LuPone-Is-Mama-Rose-in-Ravinias-Gypsy-Beginning-Aug-11 |date=2012-10-19 }}.

Mama Rose Hears a Symphony."] ''New York Times'', August 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Excitement was generated around LuPone playing the role of Rose and producers were eager to see Price's production, with the hope of moving it to New York. Jack Viertel, the artistic director of [[New York City Center]] [[Encores!]] saw the production and was so impressed that he contacted Arthur Laurents, requesting that he direct a new fully staged production of the show for a new summer "Encores!" program.&lt;ref&gt;Laurents, Arthur. [https://books.google.com/books?id=vGxVfoaZNIkC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=Gypsy+%22Arthur+Laurents%22+Viertel&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 'Gypsy'] ''Mainly on Directing'', Random House Digital, Inc., 2009, {{ISBN|0-307-27088-2}}, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  From July 9 to 29, 2007, the show was presented at [[New York City Center]] with LuPone once again. Directed by [[Arthur Laurents]], the production also featured [[Laura Benanti]] as Louise, [[Boyd Gaines]] as Herbie and [[Leigh Ann Larkin]] as June. [[Nancy Opel]], Marilyn Caskey, and [[Alison Fraser]] played the strippers Mazeppa, Electra, and Tessie Tura ([[Lenora Nemetz]] assumed the role of Mazeppa / Miss Cratchitt for the Broadway transfer.)

LuPone recounted in her memoirs that, when Laurents began directing this production, he based his direction initially on the 1989 revival, "because, I think that in Arthur's mind, the Tyne Daly ''Gypsy'' had been the last successful production." However, the cast "questioned Arthur relentlessly about...the scenes", and he "tossed the old prompt book out and freed" the actors to explore.&lt;ref&gt;LuPone, Patti. [https://books.google.com/books?id=oGseFpi7QG0C&amp;pg=PA307&amp;dq=Gypsy+%22Patti+LuPone%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20rehearsal%20table&amp;f=false "'Gypsy'"] ''Patti LuPone: A Memoir'', Random House, Inc., 2010, {{ISBN|0-307-46073-8}}, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Encores!'' production was a success, and despite [[Ben Brantley]]'s somewhat negative review of LuPone's performance in ''[[The New York Times]]'', the show transferred to Broadway, where it opened at the [[St. James Theatre]] on March 27, 2008. Brantley gave the production a rave review, praising LuPone, Laurents and the rest of the cast, and describing the characterizations in the production:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"You see, everyone's starved for attention in ''Gypsy''.  That craving, after all, is the motor that keeps showbiz puttering along.  And Mr. Laurents makes sure that we sense that hunger in everyone....  I was so caught up in the emotional wrestling matches between the characters (and within themselves), that I didn't really think about the songs as songs....  There is no separation at all between song and character, which is what happens in those uncommon moments when musicals reach upward to achieve their ideal reasons to be."&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben.

This production won numerous awards including the [[Tony Award]]s and [[Drama Desk Award]]s for LuPone, Gaines and Benanti. The show was originally scheduled to close in March 2009 on LuPone's final performance, but closed on January 11, 2009 due to decreases in ticket sales.&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew.

LuPone had voiced interest in heading the 2003 Broadway revival but author [[Arthur Laurents]] had reportedly banned her from any future work with his involvement, as she had previously walked out on a production of ''[[Jolson Sings Again]]'', written by Laurents, in 1995. LuPone and Laurents subsequently reconciled.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Jesse. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/08/theater/08gree.html "Let Her Entertain You. Please!"]. ''The New York Times''.

'''2017 The Cape Playhouse'''

In July and August of 2017, The Cape Playhouse presented a celebrated revival of ''Gypsy'' that featured [[Julia Murney]] as Rose. The production, directed by Michael Rader, choreographed by Jason Sparks and with  music direction by Garrett Taylor, broke box office records and featured [[Caroline Bowman]] as Louise, James Lloyd Reynolds as Herbie, Tess Soltau as June, Garett Hawe as Tulsa, [[Jennifer Cody]] as Tessie and Ms. Cratchit and Wally Dunn as Pop/Goldstone/Webber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/julia-murney-and-caroline-bowman-star-in-cape-playhouse-gypsy-beginning-august-8|title=Julia Murney and Caroline Bowman Star in Cape Playhouse Gypsy, Beginning August 8 {{!}} Playbill|website=Playbill|language=en|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!--PLEASE NOTE: A "notable" production can be: a revival on Broadway or the West End, a production at a top ranked (i.e. LORT A) regional theatre or at a major arts festival, the first production in a country, or a production featuring a well-known actor (i.e. from Broadway or films or recordings) as star.--&gt;

==Film and TV versions==
{{Main|Gypsy (1962 film)|Gypsy (1993 film)}}
[[Rosalind Russell]], [[Karl Malden]], and [[Natalie Wood]] starred in the 1962 [[Warner Bros.]] [[Gypsy (1962 film)|film adaptation]] of the musical. Russell won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] for her portrayal of Rose.

''Gypsy'' was also adapted as [[Gypsy (1993 film)|1993 television movie]] with [[Bette Midler]] playing Rose. [[Cynthia Gibb]] portrayed Louise and Jennifer Beck portrayed Dainty June. Bette Midler won the [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Performance by an Actress in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV; Michael Rafter won the [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music Direction. This production was a rare example of a film or TV project in which some of the songs are sung live, and not [[lip sync]]ed to a prerecorded track.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, Ann. "Cast shines in latest version of musical hit 'Gypsy'". ''The Houston Chronicle''. December 12, 1993. Section: Television, p. 3. "It's surely the first time in a long time that the actors singing the songs are actually singing them, instead of just moving their lips to a pre-recording."&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 London revival of ''Gypsy'' starring Imelda Staunton was recorded live at the Savoy Theatre during its run and broadcast on BBC Four on 27 December 2015. This recording was released on DVD in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=Gypsy: The Musical [DVD] | url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/DVD-Blu-ray/Gypsy-Musical-DVD-Jonathan-Kent/B01KVB0MN2 | publisher=Amazon.co.uk | accessdate=December 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planned Streisand film===
In January 2011, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that [[Barbra Streisand]] was in negotiations to produce, direct and star in a new film version of ''Gypsy.'' In an interview with the ''New York Post'', Arthur Laurents said, "We've talked about it a lot, and she knows what she's doing. She has my approval." He said that he would not write the screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;Riedel, Michael. [http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/theater/babs_comes_up_rose_Bry1HpmU0r5EYkQqU9IQVL "Babs Comes up Rose"]. ''New York Post''. January 5, 2011 (updated from January 4, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew. [https://archive.is/20120906220632/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/146357-Will-Barbra-Streisand-Star-and-Direct-New-Film-Version-of-Gypsy "Will Barbra Streisand Star and Direct New Film Version of Gypsy?"] Playbill.com. January 5, 2011 (updated).&lt;/ref&gt; In a clarifying statement and report, ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Streisand would star, but would not produce or direct. Streisand's spokesperson confirmed that "there have been conversations".&lt;ref&gt;Healy, Patrick (January 5, 2011) [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/05/streisand-in-talks-to-play-mama-rose-in-film-remake-of-gypsy/ "Streisand in Talks to Play Mama Rose in Film Remake of 'Gypsy{{'"}}], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Frank Rizzo of ''courant.com'' reported on March 12, 2011 that the film with Streisand "is not going to happen, according to playwright-director Arthur Laurents, one of the rights holders to the work."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.courant.com/curtain/2011/03/streisands-gypsy-film-project.html "Streisand/'Gypsy' Film Project a No-Go, Says Arthur Laurents"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110316150746/http://blogs.courant.com/curtain/2011/03/streisands-gypsy-film-project.html |date=2011-03-16 }}. ''Hartford Courant'' (courant.com). March 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; But that was contradicted by an August 2011 report by ''USA TODAY'' that the plans for a film adaptation of ''Gypsy'' were still intact. "Before writer and director Arthur Laurents died at age 93 last May, there had been much talk about a movie version of ''Gypsy'' starring Streisand as Rose. 'We just have to find our team and a writer,' said Streisand. 'It's too bad, because I was looking forward to working with Arthur,' who directed Streisand in her Broadway debut. 'I had seen him a few months before that, and he seemed so strong and healthy.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://broadwayworld.com/article/Barbra-Streisand-Says-GYPSY-Film-Still-On-20110818#ixzz1eOZoezZk "Barbra Streisand Says GYPSY Film Still On"] broadwayworld.com, August 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, reports stated that [[Universal Pictures]] was pressing on with the new film. Streisand was still attached to produce and play Rose, with [[Joel Silver]] co-producing and [[Julian Fellowes]] scripting.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, M.  (March 13, 2012) [http://www.deadline.com/2012/03/universal-barbra-streisand-and-joel-silver-tap-julian-fellowes-to-script-gypsy/ "TOLDJA! Universal, Barbra Streisand And Joel Silver Tap Julian Fellowes To Script 'Gypsy{{'"}}], ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Playbill'' reported in October 2015 that "Universal, which had been working with Streisand on the project, formally put ''Gypsy'' in turnaround, meaning it has decided not to develop the film any further. Streisand reportedly has been working with producer Joel Silver on the project, and they are now free to shop their ''Gypsy'' around to other studios."&lt;ref&gt;Viagas, Robert; Gans, Andrew. [http://www.playbill.com/article/universal-passes-on-barbra-streisand-gypsy-film-com-369115# "Universal Passes on Barbra Streisand 'Gypsy' Film"] Playbill, October 27, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, it was reported that Streisand was in advanced negotiations to star in and produce the film, which will be directed by [[Barry Levinson]] and distributed by [[STX Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/barbra-streisand-gypsy-barry-levinson-1201750655/|title=Barbra Streisand, Barry Levinson Reviving ‘Gypsy’ for STX Entertainment (EXCLUSIVE) |work=Variety|date=April 11, 2016 |accessdate=April 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, it was reported that [[Richard LaGravenese]] had finished writing the script for the film and that production for the film is aiming to begin in early 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/barbra-streisand-gypsy-film-script-complete-and-aiming-for-2017-start|title=Barbra Streisand Gypsy Film Script Complete and Aiming for 2017 Start |work=Playbill|date=July 14, 2016 |accessdate=July 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on August 3, 2016, it was reported that STX Entertainment "was withdrawing as distributor and co-financier of the film."&lt;ref&gt;Viagas, Robert; Gioia, Michael.

==Recordings==
There are recordings of each of the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]  and London productions, as well as the film and television productions. The original 1959 and revival 2003 cast albums each won the [[Grammy Award]], Best Original Cast Show Album.

The original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] cast album was Ethel Merman's first recording in the then-new [[stereophonic sound]] technology. Motion pictures recorded in stereo had been steadily made since 1953, and stereo was first used on [[magnetic tape]] in 1954, but it was not until 1958, a year before ''Gypsy'' opened, that it became possible to use this technology on records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xXEEBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=gypsy+record+merman+magnetic+tape&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=s-Tfqse0Gh&amp;sig=MGPEe1rPMUiskgmRBo8C_J3IgBg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=B8NfVcneBfaCsQT-vYGoAw&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=gypsy%20recor%20merman%20magnetic%20tape&amp;f=false|title=The Sam Mendes Handbook – Everything you need to know about Sam Mendes|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1974 Broadway recording was not an actual recording of the Broadway revival, but a remix of the London Cast recording of 1973 with a new recording of "Some People".

The 1989 Broadway cast recording was released in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/gypsy-1989-broadway-revival-cast-mw0000207405/credits|title=Gypsy [1989 Broadway Revival Cast] – Tyne Daly, Original 1990 Cast {{!}} Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 Broadway cast recording was released August 28, 2008.

The 2015 West End cast recording was recorded at [[Angel Recording Studios]] in London on 9 March 2015 and was released on 27 April 2015.

==Other performances==
The 2001 [[Royal Variety Performance]] featured [[Cilla Black]], [[Paul O'Grady]] (in his Lily Savage persona), and [[Barbara Windsor]] singing "You Gotta Get a Gimmick".

'''Henley Royal Regatta''' (or '''Henley Regatta''', its original name pre-dating Royal patronage) is a [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] event held annually on the [[River Thames]] by the town of [[Henley-on-Thames]], [[England]]. It was established on 26 March 1839. It differs from the three other regattas rowed over approximately the same course, [[Henley Women's Regatta]], Henley Masters Regatta and Henley Town and Visitors' Regatta, each of which is an entirely separate event.

The regatta lasts for five days (Wednesday to Sunday) ending on the first weekend in July. Races are head-to-head knock out competitions, raced over a course of 1 mile, 550 yards (2,112 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrr.co.uk/history-organisation/the-course/|title=Henley Royal Regatta – History and organisation – The Course|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regatta regularly attracts international crews to race. The most prestigious event at the regatta is the [[Grand Challenge Cup]] for Men's Eights, which has been awarded since the regatta was first staged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrr.co.uk/history-organisation/trophies/|title=Henley Royal Regatta – History and organisation – Trophies|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the regatta pre-dates any national or international rowing organisation, it has its own rules and organisation, although it is recognised by both [[British Rowing]] (the governing body of rowing in England and Wales) and [[International Federation of Rowing Associations|FISA]] (the International Federation of Rowing Associations).&lt;ref name="hrr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrr.co.uk/history-organisation/|title=Henley Royal Regatta – History and organisation|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regatta is organised by a self-electing body of Stewards, who are largely former rowers themselves.&lt;ref name="hrr" /&gt; [[Pierre de Coubertin]] modelled elements of the organisation of the [[International Olympic Committee]] on the Henley Stewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.routledge.com/textbooks/0415346045/study_materials/materials/chapter_4_act_1.doc|title=COUBERTIN, BRITAIN AND THE BRITISH A CHRONOLOGY|accessdate=23 June 2008 |format=MS Word |work=Dr Don Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regatta is regarded as part of the English [[Season (society)|social season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.debretts.com/social-season/the-traditional-season.aspx|title=Debretts – the traditional season|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with other events in the season, certain enclosures at the regatta have strict dress codes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whatbesttowear.com/events/henley-royal-regatta/what-to-wear-to-the-henley-royal-regatta/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113072329/http://www.whatbesttowear.com/events/henley-royal-regatta/what-to-wear-to-the-henley-royal-regatta/ |date=13 January 2011 }} | What to wear to Henley Royal Regatta&lt;/ref&gt; The Stewards’ Enclosure has a strict dress code of lounge suits for men;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pamper your hamper: essential accessories for a summer picnic |url=https://www.ft.com/content/e3a1cfc4-50f2-11e7-a1f2-db19572361bb|publisher=Financial Times |date=23 June 2017 |accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; women are to wear dresses or skirts with hemlines below the knee and hats are encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=5 Things to Know About the Henley Royal Regatta in England |url=https://www.vogue.com/article/henley-royal-regatta-england |publisher=Vogue.com |date=1 July 2017 |accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Format of competition ==

===Qualifying===
[[File:Henley Royal Regatta HQ, Henley Bridge.JPG|right|thumb|Henley Royal Regatta Headquarters by Henley Bridge]]
Entries for the regatta close at 6:00&amp;nbsp;pm sixteen days before the Regatta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hrr.co.uk/pdisp.php?pid=336 |title=Amendments to the Qualification &amp; General Rules |accessdate=11 December 2009 |format=pdf |work=Henley Royal Regatta }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to encourage a high quality of racing, create a manageable race timetable and to ensure that most crews race only once a day, each event has a limited number of places. Qualifying races are held on the Friday before the regatta. The regatta's Committee of Management decides at its absolute discretion which crews are obliged to qualify; the Committee will examine the form and calibre of the entrants and may choose to pre-qualify some of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrr.co.uk/fs/downloads/HRR_Constitution.pdf|title=HRR Rules and Constitution, rule 20|accessdate=8 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614084452/http://www.hrr.co.uk/fs/downloads/HRR_Constitution.pdf|archivedate=14 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrr.co.uk/regatta/crews/avoiding-qualifying-races/ |title=Avoiding the qualifying races |accessdate=4 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528035908/http://www.hrr.co.uk/regatta/crews/avoiding-qualifying-races/ |archivedate=28 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The qualifying races take the form of a timed processional race up the regatta course, with the fastest crews qualifying. Times are released for non-qualifying crews only. This does not stop an enthusiastic band of unofficial timers with synchronised watches working out how fast their first round opposition might be.

If it is apparent that there are a number of outstanding crews in an event, they may be 'selected' by the Stewards, to prevent them from meeting too early in the competition. The regatta insists that selection is not the same as [[Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seeding]], the main difference being that there is no 'rank order' as is usually the case in, for example, a tennis tournament.&lt;ref name="Burnell"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The draw ===

The draw is a public event that takes place in the [[Henley town hall]], normally at 3&amp;nbsp;pm on the Saturday before the regatta. For each event the names of all [[Seed (sports)|selected]] crews are placed on pieces of paper which are then drawn at random from the Grand Challenge Cup. These crews are then placed on pre-determined positions on the draw chart, as far apart as possible. The remaining qualifying crews are then drawn from the cup, filling in from the top of the draw chart downwards, until all places have been filled.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

=== Racing ===
[[File:Qubathenley.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Two crews racing in the [[Temple Challenge Cup]] at Henley in 2003]]
Each event in the regatta takes the form of a knockout competition, with each race consisting of two crews racing side by side up the Henley course. The course is marked out by two lines of booms (wooden bars which float on the water, secured between vertical poles), which are placed along the river to form a straight course 2,112&amp;nbsp;metres long. The course is wide enough to allow two crews to race down with a few metres between them. As such it is not uncommon for inexperienced steersmen or [[coxswains]] to crash into the booms, possibly costing their crew the race.

The race begins at the downstream end of Temple Island, where the crews attach to a pair of pontoons. The race umpire will then call out the names of the two crews and start them when they are both straight and ready. Each crew is assigned to row on either the 'Bucks' ([[Buckinghamshire]]) or 'Berks' ([[Berkshire]]) side of the race course. The coxswains or steersmen are expected to keep their crew on the allocated side of the course at all times during the race, else they risk disqualification. The only exception is when a crew leads by a sizeable margin and is not deemed by the umpire to be impeding the trailing crew.

There are several progress markers along the course. Intermediate times are recorded at two of them – "the Barrier" and "Fawley", in addition to the time to the finish. The regatta has official commentary, which is announced at these points along the course. The commentary is renowned for being unemotional and factual, with the commentator only allowed to announce the [[rate of striking]], which crew is leading, the distance between the crews, and the progress marker which the crews are passing.

=== The course ===

Henley Royal Regatta has always been raced over a distance of ‘about one mile and 550 yards’ from Temple Island upstream towards Henley Bridge. However, four distinct courses have been used over the regatta’s history, with smaller changes also being made incrementally. Changes to the course have all been aimed at improving the prospects for fair and safe racing.

==== The Old Course (1839–1885) ====
[[File:Henley Regatta by Tissot 1877.jpg|thumb|right|320px|An 1877 painting by James Tissot showing the Old Course]]
This ran from a point just upstream of Temple Island. At the first regatta in 1839, the finish line was Henley Bridge itself, but it was presumably quickly realised that this had inherent problems. From 1840 onward the finish was moved downstream slightly; eventually a point opposite the lawn of the Red Lion Hotel became the standard finish line. A grandstand was erected for the Stewards and their guests outside the Red Lion. Other spectators could watch from the adjacent roadway (in front of the Little White Hart Hotel) while those with carriages surveyed the scene from a vantage point on Henley Bridge. There were three racing stations (Berkshire, Centre and Buckinghamshire). When only two crews raced, the Centre Station was not used.

The Old Course had a large lefthand bend in the last quarter-mile. This benefited the crew on the Berkshire side of the course not only because they raced a shorter distance but also because they avoided the worst of the river’s current. Between 1866 and 1885, 57.7% all races were won by the crew on the Berkshire station, with the Buckinghamshire and Centre crews sharing 42.3%. The course was not boomed or piled, although between 1871 and 1873, poles were roped across the bay on the Berkshire side upstream of Poplar Point, in an attempt to minimise the advantage given to the crew on the Berkshire station.

==== The New Course (1886–1922) ====
[[File:Henley regatta course map 1893.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Map of the New Course from the 1893 programme]]
[[File:Green Lake Crew Junior Men's 8 @ 2007 Henley Royal Regatta.jpg|thumb|Green Lake Crew, USA racing, with the pilings and floating booms seen in the background]]
In 1884, a sub-committee of the regatta’s Committee of Management discussed options for reducing the unfairness of the course. Their recommendation was to move the finish line downstream to Poplar Point (thus avoiding the bend) and the start to the bottom of Temple Island. This was not popular with spectators as it made previous viewing points obsolete. The sub-committee also recommending reducing the racing lanes from three to two and extending racing from two days to three. The Committee gained support from the Captains of competing Clubs and the changes were introduced for the 1886 Regatta.

The New Course started just downstream of Temple Island, on the Buckinghamshire side and finished opposite the upstream end of Phyllis Court, very close to the current finish line. There were two slight bends (at Remenham and just after Fawley) and a staggered start to compensate for them. The course was also piled for the first time, although not boomed. Unfortunately, it became apparent that in trying to eliminate the unfairness of the Old Course, a new problem had been introduced. Downstream of Fawley, bushes grew alongside the Buckinghamshire bank and provided shelter from the prevailing wind. The course now ran close to this bank and crew on the Buckinghamshire station gained the advantage of shelter whenever a ‘Bushes Wind’ was blowing. From 1886 to 1905, Bucks took 59% of wins against 41% on Berks.

To attempt to reduce the effect of the Bushes Wind, the course was narrowed and pushed further to the centre of the river. The width was 135 feet in 1887, in 120 feet in 1888 and then progressively until by 1914 it was down to 100 feet at the start tapering to 80 feet at the finish. In 1899, floating booms secured between the pilings which mark the course were also introduced along part of its length in an attempt to keep spectators from obstructing races.

==== The Experimental Course (1923) and the Straight Course (1924 onwards) ====

In around 1920, the Stewards carried out a survey canvassing the idea of a moving the start of the course to the Berkshire side of Temple Island. At the time this channel was a winding, shallow backwater and it would clearly not be possible to lay a course of the full Henley distance without significant alteration to the bank, the island and the riverbed.

For the 1923 regatta, the Stewards therefore decided to try a shorter experimental straight course which started at the top of the island. This produced 53.2% wins on Bucks and 46.8% on Berks, deemed enough of an improvement on the New Course to justify a permanent change. The consent of the landowners of the Berkshire bank and Temple island (Lord Hambleden and W.D. Mackenzie respectively) was obtained to widen and deepen the Berkshire channel; {{convert|10000|cuyd|m3}} of material were excavated. The Straight Course was now ready for use.

The Straight Course runs from the upstream end of Temple Island to a point opposite the upstream end of the Phyllis Court. It is {{convert|80|ft|m}} wide. The Straight Course has generally addressed the problems of unfairness: for example, between 1975 and 1984, 50.52% of races were won on Bucks and 49.31% on Berks (with the remainder dead heats). However, when a strong stream is flowing, the Berks station enjoys considerable shelter from the stream, particularly in the last ¼ mile. Conversely, when there is a strong south-westerly wind it is better to be on the Bucks station because it is more sheltered from the wind. The course is now piled and boomed along its entire length, except for crossing points. The booms can present a hazard for the inexperienced coxswain or steersman.

==== Precise length of the course ====

When the start and finish positions of the Old Course had become established, the distance between them was found to be 1 mile 570 yds (2131 metres). However, boats were aligned by their sterns at the start and judged by their bows at the finish. This meant that the course was slightly longer for shorter boats (such as single sculls) than for longer boats (such as eights). The length of an eight was assumed to be twenty yards and as such the course came to be described as ‘about 1 mile and 550 yards (2112 metres)’, which was the distance covered by an eight.{{citation needed|date = May 2018}}

In 1967 the start of the Straight Course was relocated exactly 1 mile 550 yd from the finish. In the same year, moving pontoons were introduced at the start which allowed all boats, from singles to eights, to be aligned with their bows precisely on the start line. Since then all crews have raced a course of exactly one mile and 550 yards (2112 metres).&lt;ref name="Burnell" /&gt;

=== Safety ===

During the whole regatta, during racing hours there are numerous safety boats provided by the [http://www.thelifeguards.org.uk Colwick Park Lifeguards] to keep competitors safe. The regatta organisers arrange for a first aid provider to be present, who have an on site hospital-style area.

== History ==
[[File:Henley Regatta, Henley-on-Thames, England, 1890s.jpg|thumb|Regatta participants in the 1890s]]
At a public meeting in Henley town hall on 26 March 1839, Captain Edmund Gardiner proposed "that from the lively interest which had been manifested at the various boat races which have taken place on the Henley reach during the last few years, and the great influx of visitors on such occasions, this meeting is of the opinion that the establishing of an annual regatta, under judicious and respectable management, would not only be productive of the most beneficial results to the town of Henley, but from its peculiar attractions would also be a source of amusement and gratification to the neighbourhood, and the public in general."&lt;ref name="dodd"&gt;{{cite book | author= Dodd, Christopher | title = Henley Royal Regatta | publisher = Stanley Paul | year = 1987 | isbn = 0-09-172801-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regatta was first staged in 1839 and proved so successful that it was expanded the next year from one day to two. As the regatta's popularity has grown it has further expanded: to three days in 1886, four days in 1906 and five days in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrr.co.uk/history/history.asp#history |title=History |accessdate=27 December 2006 |work=Henley Royal Regatta |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061203010752/http://www.hrr.co.uk/history/history.asp#history &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 3 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regatta has been known as ''Henley Royal Regatta'' since 1851, when [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] became the first royal patron. Since his death, every reigning monarch has agreed to be the patron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrr.co.uk/history/history.asp#royal |title=Royal Patronage |accessdate=27 December 2006 |work=Henley Royal Regatta |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061203010752/http://www.hrr.co.uk/history/history.asp#royal &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 3 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amateurism===

At the regatta’s inception it was intended for [[amateurism|amateur]] oarsmen rather than those who rowed professionally. In 1879 Henley produced its first formal definition of an amateur:

{{quotebox|No person shall be considered an amateur oarsman or sculler, or coxswain:

#Who has ever competed in any open competition for a stake, money, or entrance fee. (Not to apply to foreign crews.)
#Who has ever competed with or against a professional for any prize.
#Who has ever taught, pursued or assisted in the practice of athletic exercises of any kind as a means of gaining a livelihood.
#Who has been employed in or about boats for money or wages.
#Who is or has been by trade or employment for wages a mechanic, artisan or labourer.|Henley Royal Regatta, 1879}}

In 1884, amateur status for overseas oarsmen was put on the same basis as for home oarsmen, thus ending the concession on racing for money prizes. By 1886 a phrase had also been added debarring any person "engaged in any menial activity".

These rules would become the cause of growing controversy as international entries to Henley increased; most foreign countries having a different definition of amateur. The adoption of Henley's definition of amateur by the Amateur Rowing Association of Great Britain would also cause a 66-year schism in British rowing, when in 1890 a rival [[National Amateur Rowing Association]] was set up, with a much more inclusive definition of amateurism.

One well-known incident was the exclusion of future [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] champion [[John B. Kelly Sr.]], who had served an apprenticeship as a bricklayer, from the 1920 regatta. According to the minutes of the regatta's Committee of Management, Kelly was excluded both because he was not eligible under the manual labour rules and because he was a member of [[Vesper Boat Club]], which was banned in 1906 because members of its 1905 Henley crew had raised money to pay for their trip through public donations – making them professionals in the eyes of the Henley Stewards.&lt;ref&gt;NYTimes 25 June 1906&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelly's exclusion was widely reported in newspapers in both the UK and USA, with many seeing it as an attempt to prevent an American from winning the Diamonds. Kelly's son [[John B. Kelly Jr.]] would dramatically win the 1947 Diamond Sculls, and his daughter would become the famous Academy Award-winning actress turned Princess of Monaco [[Grace Kelly]], keeping the incident in the public eye for years afterwards.

In 1936, there was a further controversy when the Australian national eight, preparing for the Berlin Olympics, was excluded from the Grand Challenge Cup because the crew was composed of policemen, deemed to be 'manual workers'. The resulting embarrassment persuaded the Amateur Rowing Association and the Stewards of Henley Royal Regatta of the need for change. On 9 June 1937, the offending references to manual labourers, mechanics, artisans and menial duties were deleted from the ARA rules; Henley's rules were changed the following day, coming into effect from the 1938 regatta.&lt;ref name="Burnell" /&gt;

In September 1997, FISA removed all references to amateurism in its rules and in December 1998 Henley followed suit. The regatta is therefore now entirely open.

=== International participation ===

[[File:Columbia University Four, Winners of the Visitors' Challenge Cup, Henley Royal Regatta 1878.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]], winners of the [[Visitors' Challenge Cup]] in 1878]]
The first ‘overseas’ entry to the regatta was in 1870 when [[Trinity College, Dublin]] entered the Grand, Ladies’, Visitors’ and Wyfold. As Dublin was at that time within the [[United Kingdom]], this was not a foreign entry. TCD won the Visitors’ and reached the final of the Ladies’.

The first international competitors came in 1878 when G.W. Lee of [[New Jersey]] and G. Lee of [[Boston]] entered the Diamonds, Shoe-wae-cae-mette BC of [[Monroe, Michigan|Monroe]], [[Michigan]], a crew of French Canadian watermen, entered the Stewards’ and [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]] entered the Stewards’ and Visitors’.

Lee of Boston made little progress but Lee of New Jersey lost his heat in a very close race against [[Tom Edwards-Moss]], the eventual winner. Shoe-wae-cae-mette, rowing with then-unusual swivel rowlocks, reached the final of the Stewards’ but lost to [[London Rowing Club]].

Columbia won the [[Visitors' Challenge Cup]], becoming the first foreign winners of a Henley trophy.&lt;ref name="Burnell" /&gt;

Unfortunately, there were accusations that both G.W. Lee and the Shoe-wae-cae-mette crew were not amateurs. This led in 1879 to a new, tighter, definition of amateurism (see above) and a requirement that any entries from outside the United Kingdom must be made on or before 1 March and must be ‘accompanied by a declaration made before Notary Public with regard to the profession of each member of the crew’, and this must be certified by the British [[Consul]], the mayor, or the chief authority of the locality.

Under these new rules, Shoe-wae-cae-mette were refused entry in 1879 as were [[Hillsdale, Michigan|Hillsdale]] Boat Club of Michigan in 1882.

The Germania Ruder Club of [[Frankfurt]] became the first entry from continental Europe in 1880, losing in a heat of the Grand to London Rowing Club.

Foreign entries grew over the next twenty years, to the consternation of some who felt that the regatta should be restricted to domestic entries only. There were also a number of disputes over amateurism and the two issues were often bound up together, as in this letter to [[The Times]] from [[Edmond Warre]], headmaster of [[Eton College]] in 1901:

{{quotebox|I most earnestly desire that our amateur oarsmanship may be preserved from the deadly inroad of professionalism, which is already making a business of so much that ought only to be pleasure, and threatens to crush the life out of the sports of “merrie England”. Let us restrict our Henley pots to the United Kingdom and set up a proper international regatta elsewhere, if that is thought desirable.|Edmond Warre|''The Times''}}

[[William Grenfell, 1st Baron Desborough|W.H. Grenfell]] [[Member of parliament|MP]] proposed a motion for a special meeting of the Stewards that:

{{quotebox|This meeting…while fully prepared to promote the establishment of an international regatta upon a proper course and under suitable conditions, is of the opinion that Henley Regatta does not provide either a proper course or suitable conditions for international competitions.|William Grenfell}}

He proposed amendments to the rules restricting entries to the United Kingdom, and for the Goblets and Diamonds to British subjects domiciled in the UK. Warre seconded his proposals. The [[Amateur Rowing Association]] canvassed its member clubs on the proposal and the results were decisive: all clubs opposed the proposals save for [[Oxford University Boat Club]] which supported them with the caveat ‘Committee decide against foreign entries provided they can row other than Henley’.

At a special general meeting of the Stewards late in 1901, a motion moved by Colonel Makins ‘that in the opinion of this meeting it is inexpedient that any alteration in the rules of the regatta be made at present’ was carried by 19 votes to 5.&lt;ref name="dodd" /&gt;

In 1906, [[Royal Club Nautique de Gand]] of [[Belgium]] became the first foreign crew to win the Grand Challenge Cup. A different Ghent Club, Sport Nautique de Gand took the Grand in 1907.

In advance of 1908, with the Olympic Regatta to be held on the Henley course in mid-July, the Stewards announced a temporary rule change excluding overseas entries from the 1908 regatta (which would take place two weeks before the Olympics). This led to criticism of the Stewards in the British and American press, particularly since it would not permit the Belgians to defend the Grand. The Stewards pointed out in a letter to The Times that the decision had been taken before the 1907 regatta and after consultation with the Belgians. A letter from Oscar Gregoire, President of the Belgian Rowing Federation was quoted:

{{quotebox|In a year like 1908, which will see the Olympic Regatta take place at Henley…it is not reasonable to hold an international regatta 15 days previously…the Belgian holders of the Grand Challenge Cup would not have any object in going to defend it in 1908…|Richard Burnell|''Henley Royal Regatta: A celebration of 150 years''}}

Overseas entries and wins at the regatta have continued to multiply. Since the 1960s, the open events in particular have almost exclusively become the province of national squad crews. Up to 2007, the [[Grand Challenge Cup]] had been won by overseas crews 46 times: 12 times by crews from Germany, 11 from the USA, 9 from the USSR, 4 from Canada, 3 each from Belgium and Australia, 2 from the Netherlands, and 1 each from Switzerland, France, Bulgaria and Croatia.

Crews from the USA have also become frequent winners of the [[Ladies' Challenge Plate]], [[Temple Challenge Cup]] and [[Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup]].  In 1927, the [[Kent School Boat Club]] of [[Kent School]] in Connecticut was the first American secondary school to race at the Henley Royal Regatta.

===Women===

For most of its history, Henley Royal Regatta has only been open to male competitors but this has changed more recently. Women coxswains of male crews were permitted from 1975 and as such the first female competitor in the regatta was Christine Paul, cox of [[Furnivall Sculling Club]] in the [[Thames Challenge Cup]] in that year.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;ref name="dodd" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.co.uk/group/rec.sport.rowing/browse_frm/thread/d55cdca3994831d0/4ef4a3e90c31a546?lnk=gst&amp;q=biddulph+henley+cox&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en#4ef4a3e90c31a546|title=Rec.Sport.Rowing |accessdate=7 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was much discussion about the introduction of events for women. The Stewards felt that they faced a dilemma: on the one hand it was argued that women's rowing would never flourish while there were no women's events at Britain's premier regatta; on the other it was clear that open women’s events would be dominated by foreign competitors, while events closed to foreign competitors would not serve the desired purpose.&lt;ref name="Burnell" /&gt; Another difficulty was the length of the course. The standard distance for international women's races was at that time 1000&amp;nbsp;m. It was clear that races over the full Henley course (2112&amp;nbsp;m) would not be appealing to women's crews preparing for international championships.

Peter Coni, who was elected as Chairman of the regatta’s Committee of Management in 1978, was supportive of the idea of introducing women's events. However, he had had little time to take any action when there was an attempt to force the issue. [[Kingston Rowing Club]] sent in an entry for the [[Double Sculls Challenge Cup]] in the names of A.Hohl and P.Bird. The crew was in fact Great Britain internationals Astrid Ayling and Pauline Hart, who had made the entry under their maiden names. The regatta realised the subterfuge and Coni made a statement to the press in which he said that it was 'sad that a long-established club should think it reasonable behaviour to make a deliberately false declaration'. He added that the stewards had no fear of the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975|Sex Discrimination Act]].&lt;ref name="dodd" /&gt;

====Exhibition races====
In 1979, the Committee announced that there would be exhibition events for women in 1981, with entries by invitation only:

{{quotebox|The Stewards announced in December 1979 that they were considering the possibility of adding certain Events for Women to the Regatta programme. As a preliminary step two invitation events are being held this year, with racing from the Barrier start used for the Special Race for Schools. These events will enable the Stewards to assess the feasibility of including races over the shorter Course during the normal Regatta programme, and the desirability of the considerable extension to the hours of racing which any full Events for Women would necessarily involve.| |''1981 Henley Royal Regatta programme''}}

The entries were limited to four in each event (Coxed Fours and Double Sculls); two from abroad and two from the UK. The standard was good, but it was reckoned that the course from the Barrier start (over 600&amp;nbsp;m longer than the international standard 1000&amp;nbsp;m) contributed to there being no close verdicts.&lt;ref name="Burnell" /&gt;

In 1982, a Single Sculls Event was added and the start was moved to Fawley so that the course was closer to 1000&amp;nbsp;m. As the intermediate start installations were required for the shorter distance, the races had to take place during intervals in the normal racing programme (the lunch or tea breaks) which meant that only the dedicated stayed to watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hwr.org.uk/history.asp |title=History |accessdate=7 January 2007 |work=Henley Women's Regatta |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206180342/http://www.hwr.org.uk/history.asp |archivedate=6 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a pity, since the final of the Women's Invitation Single was a highlight of the regatta, with [[Beryl Mitchell]] of Thames Tradesmen’s Rowing Club (World Silver medallist in 1981) beating Stephanie Foster of Waiariki Rowing Club, New Zealand (World Bronze medallist in 1982) by one length. Astrid Ayling was also able to race legitimately, winning the Invitation Double Sculls event with Rosie Clugston. The time taken to install the start equipment at Fawley combined with the relative lack of crowd interest meant that the Stewards took the decision not to repeat the experiment in 1983.&lt;ref name="dodd" /&gt;

====Introduction of current events====
[[File:'Royal Regatta' programme 1986 - geograph.org.uk - 257731.jpg|thumb|A programme of events from the 1986 regatta]]

The change of the international distance to 2000&amp;nbsp;m and the addition of a fifth day to the regatta in 1986 allowed the Committee of Management to revisit the decision. In 1993 the regatta introduced an open Women’s Single Sculls event and from 1993–6 this counted as a round of the FISA World Cup. The first winner was [[Maria Brandin]] of Sweden and she subsequently won a further four times. Fittingly, the prizegiver in 1993 was Peter Coni. In 1996, the Stewards purchased a silver cup as a challenge trophy and named it the [[Princess Royal Challenge Cup]]; it was presented for the first time in 1997.

An invitation event for women's eights was added in 1998. In 2000, this was replaced by an open women's eights event under the same rules as the Grand Challenge Cup. In 2002, the [[Remenham Challenge Cup]] was donated by [[Remenham Club]] as the trophy for this event. At the 2001 Regatta, an open event for Women's Quadruple Sculls was introduced. In 2003, this event became known as the [[Princess Grace Challenge Cup]] in memory of Princess Grace of Monaco. Her father, John B. Kelly Sr., had been controversially excluded from the [[Diamond Challenge Sculls|Diamond Sculls]] in 1920 because of the regattas rules on amateurism; her brother, John B. Kelly Jr. had won the Diamonds Sculls in 1947 and in 1949. Princess Grace was the Regatta prizegiver in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrr.co.uk/pdisp.php?pid=60|title=Trophies|accessdate=13 April 2010|work=Henley Royal Regatta|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501174300/http://www.hrr.co.uk/pdisp.php?pid=60|archivedate=1 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Stewards' meeting in December 2016, it was agreed to equalise the number of events for Men and Women in the Open category, leading to the creation of three new events: the Women's Fours, the Women's Pairs and the Women's Double Sculls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.hrr.co.uk/stewards%E2%80%99-december-meeting-2016|title=Stewards' Meeting December 2016|work=Henley Royal Regatta|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were raced for the first time at the 2017 Regatta.

===Other regattas===

====1908 Olympic Regatta====
{{main|Rowing at the 1908 Summer Olympics}}
Henley hosted the rowing events of the London Olympic Games in mid-July 1908, two weeks after the Royal Regatta. The course was extended {{convert|270|yd}} downstream and {{convert|60|yd}} upstream, making it {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} and {{convert|880|yd}}. Events for single sculls, coxless pairs, coxless fours and eights were offered but only the eights produced an international final.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222443/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1908/1908.pdf 1908 Summer Olympics official report.] p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1919 Peace Regatta====
A meeting arranged by [[Leander Club]] in January 1919 concluded that it was too soon to revive the regatta but asked the Stewards to arrange a “Peace Regatta” and a four-day regatta was duly staged. Competition was not for the usual Henley trophies but for different cups and some events were restricted to ‘armed services’ crews.

====1945 Royal Henley Regatta====
A two-day ‘Royal Henley Regatta’ (as opposed to Henley Royal Regatta) was staged between [[VE Day]] and [[VJ Day]].  Crews rowed three-abreast over a shortened course beginning at the Remenham Barrier. As in 1919, different trophies to the usual regatta prizes were on offer.

====1948 Olympic Regatta====
{{main|Canoeing at the 1948 Summer Olympics}}
{{main|Rowing at the 1948 Summer Olympics}}
The canoeing and rowing events for the 1948 London Olympic Games were contested in early August, a month after the Royal Regatta. The course was widened to accommodate three lanes and shortened to start at the top of Temple Island: the distance was approximately 1980 metres – 20 metres short of the standard international distance. Twenty seven nations competed and events for single sculls, double sculls, coxless pairs, coxed pairs, coxless fours, coxed fours and eights were offered.&lt;ref name="Burnell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1948/OR1948.pdf 1948 Summer Olympics official report.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716035822/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1948/OR1948.pdf |date=16 July 2011 }} pp. 43, 47–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Olympic races in 2012 were held at [[Dorney Lake]].

The racing can be viewed from a number of locations along both banks of the [[Thames]]. Areas open to the general public are generally on the Berkshire ([[towpath]]) side of the river. Viewing opportunities on the other side of the river (Buckinghamshire) side are limited to the [[Phyllis Court]] club, private residences and areas for [[corporation|corporate]] entertainment. A channel of the river remains open throughout the regatta, hence racing can also be viewed from boats although mooring is tightly restricted.

===Stewards' Enclosure===
The enclosure situated on the Berkshire side, adjacent to the last part of the course and the finish line. It comprises two covered grandstands, a restaurant marquee, several bars, a bandstand and so on – all set in immaculately prepared lawns. It is only open to the Stewards of the Regatta, members of the Stewards' Enclosure and their guests. Overseas competitors are also given the opportunity to purchase tickets.

The Stewards' Enclosure as understood today, an enclosure open to members (elected by the Committee of Management of the Regatta) and their guests, came into being in 1919 with a membership of 300.  This grew to 704 in 1939 and 1,500 in 1956.  In 1980 the Stewards set a ceiling of 5,000.  The waiting list for membership of the Stewards Enclosure is now several years long, although preference is given to people who have previously competed at the regatta. The waiting list has grown rapidly since the 1970s, when membership could be applied for and granted on the same day.

The social position of the event means that some in the Stewards' Enclosure (and elsewhere along the course) may have no interest in the actual rowing.

The Stewards' Enclosure is also known for a strict enforcement of its dress code. Men are required to wear a "lounge suit, blazer and flannels, or evening dress, and a tie". Women are required to wear a dress or skirt that covers their knees, and are "encouraged to wear a hat" (although women wearing hats is often frowned upon in higher rowing circles). Anyone not suitably dressed can be refused entry, no matter their prestige in rowing or elsewhere. Mobile phone use is also prohibited.

The regatta prizegiving takes place in the Stewards' Enclosure after the conclusion of racing on Sunday.

===Regatta Enclosure===
The Regatta Enclosure is situated immediately downstream of the Stewards Enclosure and further away from the finish. This enclosure is open to all on payment of the admission fee. Competitors gain free access to this area. There is no dresscode.

===Remenham Club===
[[File:RemenhamClub01.JPG|right|thumb|Remenham Club]]
[[Remenham Club]] is situated a little over halfway along the course on the Berkshire side of the river. It is a social club run by and for members of seven rowing clubs on the Thames (the "Founding Clubs"): [[Kingston Rowing Club]], [[London Rowing Club]], [[Molesey Boat Club]], [[Staines Boat Club]], [[Thames Rowing Club]], [[Twickenham Rowing Club]] and [[Vesta Rowing Club]]. Remenham Club is open only to its members and guests. It has a similar dresscode to the Stewards Enclosure, though the rules on women's outfits are less restrictive.

===Upper Thames Rowing Club===
The clubhouse and frontage of the [[Upper Thames Rowing Club]] is on the Berkshire side of the river, immediately downstream of Remenham Club. It has historically had an informal atmosphere and no dresscode. It is only open to its members and their guests. In 2011, UTRC initiated the Upper Thames Enclosure to include a fairly relaxed dress code. UTRC lease the land downstream of their clubhouse to retailers, food vendors and bars.

===Remenham Farm===
Remenham Farm spans the riverside on the Berkshire side of the Thames from opposite the Fawley box to a point just upstream of the Barrier (approximately the 1100 m – 700m points on the regatta course). It is owned by The Copas Partnership.

During the Regatta it runs hospitality enclosures at The Temple Island Enclosure and The Courtyard Enclosure, and bars including the ''Barn Bar''. Remenham Farm is open to the public and entrance fees apply for certain enclosures, boat moorings are also available.

===Leander Club===
[[File:LeanderClub01.JPG|right|thumb|Leander Club]]
The clubhouse and grounds of [[Leander Club]] is situated on the Berkshire side of the river beyond the finish line of the regatta course, between the boat tents and Henley Bridge. Leander Club has a large marquee constructed for the regatta week and holds a large function on the Saturday night of the Regatta. It is open only to its members and their guests and has a formal dresscode.

===Phyllis Court===
The [[Phyllis Court]] Club is situated on the Buckinghamshire side of the river, opposite the finish line. It is open only to its members and their guests. Although it has an excellent view of the finish line, it is not generally frequented by rowers, being principally a lawn sports club.

'''''How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare''''' ({{lang-de|'''wie man dem toten Hasen die Bilder erklärt''' |italic=yes}}) was a [[performance art|performance piece]] enacted by the [[Germans|German]] artist [[Joseph Beuys]] on 26 November 1965 at the Galerie Schmela in [[Düsseldorf]]. While it was only Beuys’s first solo exhibition in a private gallery, it is sometimes referred to as his best known action.&lt;ref&gt;Sandler, Irving. ''Art Of The Postmodern Era: From The Late 1960s To The Early 1990s'' 2nd edition. Westview Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-8133-3433-0}} P.89 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9xOGYJd1kcgC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=how+to+explain+pictures+to+a+dead+hare&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
At the beginning of the performance Beuys locked the gallery doors from the inside, leaving the gallery-goers outside. They could observe the scene within only through the windows. With his head entirely coated in honey and [[gold leaf]], he began to explain pictures to a dead [[hare]]. Whispering to the dead animal on his arm in an apparent dialog, he processed through the exhibit from artwork to artwork. Occasionally he would stop and return to the center of the gallery, where he stepped over a dead fir tree that lay on the floor.&lt;ref&gt;Heiner Stachelhaus, ''Joseph Beuys'', Abbeville Press, New York, 1987, (Translated by David Britt), p. 135.  Cited [http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~stam/suomi/stam/beuys.html here], retrieved 10 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; After three hours the public was let into the room. Beuys sat upon a stool in the entrance area with the hare on his arm and his back to the onlookers.

==Interpretation and context==
The performance was the high point of Beuys' development of a [[Social sculpture|broadened definition of art]], which had already begun in his drawings of the 1950s. He celebrated the ritual of "[[Art criticism|explaining art]]" with an action that was, for his viewers, effectively silent. 

The relationship between thought, speech, and form in this performance was also characteristic of Beuys. In his last speech ''Speaking about Germany'' ([[German language|German]]: ''Sprechen über Deutschland'', 1985) he emphasized that he was essentially a man of words. In another instance he is quoted as saying: "When I speak, I try to guide that power's impulse so that it flows into a more fully descriptive language, which is the spiritual perception of growth."&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;{{lang-de|„Wenn ich spreche (…), versuche ich die Impulse dieser Kraft einzuführen, die aus einem volleren Sprachbegriff fließen, welcher der geistige Begriff der Entwicklung ist.“}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Müller, ''Wie man dem toten Hasen die Bilder erklärt. Schamanismus und Erkenntnis im Werk von Joseph Beuys.'' (Dissertation) VDG Weimar 1994, {{ISBN|3-9803234-8-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Entwicklung: history? development? growth? --&gt; The integration of speech and conversation into his visual works plays a meaningful role in ''How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare''.

The hare is an animal with broad, centuries-old symbolic meaning in many religions. In [[Greek mythology]] it was associated with the love goddess [[Aphrodite]], to the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and [[Germanic tribes]] it was a symbol of fertility, and in [[Christianity]] it came to be connected with [[Resurrection of Christ|the Resurrection]]. This interpretation is also supported by the "mask" that Beuys wore during his performance: [[Gold#Symbolism|gold]] as a symbol for the power of the sun, wisdom, and purity, and [[Honey#Honey_in_history.2C_culture.2C_and_folklore|honey]] as a Germanic symbol for rebirth. 

Beuys explained:
{{cquote|For me the Hare is a symbol of incarnation, which the hare really enacts- something a human can only do in imagination. It burrows, building itself a home in the earth. Thus it incarnates itself in the earth: that alone is important. So it seems to me. Honey on my head of course has to do with thought. While humans do not have the ability to produce honey, they do have the ability to think, to produce ideas. Therefore the stale and morbid nature of thought is once again made living. Honey is an undoubtedly living substance- human thoughts can also become alive. On the other hand  intellectualizing can be deadly to thought: one can talk one's mind to death in politics or in academia.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;{{lang-de|„Für mich ist der Hase das Symbol für die Inkarnation, Denn der Hase macht das ganz real, was der Mensch nur in Gedanken kann. Er gräbt sich ein, er gräbt sich einen Bau. Er inkarniert sich in die Erde, und das allein ist wichtig. So kommt er bei mir vor. Mit Honig auf dem Kopf tue ich natürlich etwas, was mit denken zu tun hat. Die menschliche Fähigkeit ist, nicht Honig abzugeben, sondern zu denken, Ideen abzugeben. Dadurch wird der Todescharakter des Gedankens wieder lebendig gemacht. Denn Honig ist zweifelslos eine lebendige Substanz. Der menschliche Gedanke kann auch lebendig sein. Er kann aber auch interellektualisierend tödlich sein, auch tot bleiben, sich todbringend äußern etwa im politischen Bereich oder der Pädagogik.“}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lieberknecht, 1971, cited by Adriani / Konnertz / Thomas , 1984, P.155&lt;/ref&gt;}}

 Ebenso kann die Beziehung Mensch – Hase betrachtet werden: „So vermute ich, dass eher der tote Hase die Bedeutung der Kunst begreift, als der sogenannte gesunde Menschenverstand. Der menschliche Betrachter zeigt sich ohne jedes Verständnis, da er schon immer alles verstanden hat, noch bevor er überhaupt richtig hingeschaut hat, d.h. im Wettlauf mit dem Hasen gefällt er sich in der Rolle des Igels.“ (Marcel Chromik).

Mit dem Dadaismus hatten die Aktionen der Fluxusbewegung die Vergänglichkeit und Zufälligkeit gemein, neu war die Einbeziehung von alltäglichen Handlungen, der Person des Künstlers oder des Künstlerkollektivs in das Kunstwerk als solches. --&gt;

The performance is considered a key work, and was re-created by [[Marina Abramović]] in 2005 at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York as part of her series ''[[Seven Easy Pieces]]''. 

Such materials and actions had specific symbolic value for Beuys. For example, honey was the product of bees who, for Beuys (following Rudolf Steiner), represented an ideal society of warmth and brotherhood. Gold had its importance within alchemy, and iron, the metal of Mars, stood for the masculine principles of strength and connection to the earth. A photograph from the performance, in which Beuys is sitting with the hare, has been described "by some critics as a new Mona Lisa of the 20th century," though Beuys did not agree with that. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Marina Abramovic |author=Robert Ayers |publisher=ARTINFO |date=November 9, 2005 |url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/1537/marina-abramovic/ |accessdate=2008-04-22 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204082357/http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/1537/marina-abramovic/ |archivedate=December 4, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cuerpo Incorrupto de La Siervita de Dios.jpg|thumb|400px|The body of [[Mary of Jesus de León y Delgado]], Monastery of St. Catherine of Siena found to be incorrupt by the Catholic Church ([[Tenerife]], [[Spain]]).]]
'''Incorruptibility''' is a [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] belief that divine intervention allows some human bodies (specifically [[saint]]s and [[Beatification|beati]]) to avoid the normal process of [[decomposition]] after death as a sign of their holiness. Bodies that undergo little or no decomposition, or delayed decomposition, are sometimes referred to as ''incorrupt'' or ''incorruptible''.

Incorruptibility is thought to occur even in the presence of factors which normally hasten decomposition, as in the cases of saints [[Catherine of Genoa]], [[Julie Billiart]] and [[Francis Xavier]].&lt;ref name="Quigley"&gt;{{cite book | last = Quigley| first = Christine| title =The Corpse: A History| publisher = McFarland| year = 2005| page = 254| isbn =978-0786424498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman Catholicism==
In [[Roman Catholicism]], if a body is judged as incorruptible after death, this is generally seen as a sign that the individual is a [[saint]]. [[Canon law]] allows inspection of the body so that relics can be taken and sent to Rome. The relics must be sealed with wax and the body must be replaced after inspection. These ritual inspections are performed very rarely and can only be performed by a bishop respecting canon law. A pontifical commission can authorize inspection of the relics and demand a written report.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pravoslavie.ru/english/print49948.htm The Re-Vesting of the Relics of St. John of Shanghai &amp; San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt; After solemn inspection of the relics, it can be decided that the body is presented in an open reliquary and displayed for veneration. Catholic law allows saints to be buried under the altar, so Mass can be celebrated above the corpse.

The relics of Saint [[Bernadette Soubirous|Bernadette]] were inspected multiple times, and reports by the church tribunal confirmed that the body was preserved. The opening of the reliquary was attended by multiple canons, the mayor and the bishop in 1919, and repeated in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicpilgrims.com/lourdes/bb_bernadette_body.htm|title=The Body of Saint Bernadette|author=|date=|website=www.catholicpilgrims.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not every saint, however, is expected to have an incorruptible corpse. Although incorruptibility is recognized as supernatural, it is no longer counted as a miracle in the recognition of a saint.&lt;ref name="discover"&gt;Archived at [https://archive.is/20010610014402/http://www.discover.com/june_01/featsaints.html The Incorruptibles], ''The bodies of many medieval Catholic saints and martyrs have resisted decay for centuries— just the sort of mystery that begs for scientific inquiry'', By [[Heather Pringle]], ''Discover'' Vol. 22 No. 6 (June 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Embalmed]] bodies were not recognized as incorruptibles. For example, although the body of [[Pope John XXIII]] remained in a remarkably intact state after its exhumation, Church officials remarked that the body had been embalmed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sandri |first=Luigi |title=Blessed John XXIII's Remains Are Now On View At St Peter's |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/juneweb-only/6-11-13.0.html?paging=off |website=Christianity Today |accessdate=11 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NIPsDkFx?url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/juneweb-only/6-11-13.0.html?paging=off |archivedate=11 February 2014 |date=1 June 2001 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and additionally there was a lack of oxygen in his sealed triple coffin.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Incorruptibility is seen as distinct from the good preservation of a body, or from [[Mummy|mummification]]. Incorruptible bodies are often said to have the [[odour of sanctity]], exuding a sweet or [[Flower|floral]], pleasant aroma.

== Eastern Orthodox Church ==
[[File:Anthony, John, and Eustathios in Orthodox Church of the Holy Spirit in Vilnius-2.jpg|upright|thumb|Relics of [[Anthony, John, and Eustathios]] at the [[Orthodox Church of the Holy Spirit in Vilnius]], Lithuania.]]
To the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], a distinction is made between natural mummification and what is believed to be supernatural incorruptibility. While incorruptibility is not generally deemed to be a prerequisite for sainthood, there are a great number of eastern Orthodox saints whose bodies have been found to be incorrupt and are in much veneration among the faithful. These include:
* [[Anthony, John, and Eustathios]]
* [[Saint Alexander of Svir]] – the incorrupt relics of the saint were removed from the Svir Monastery by the Bolsheviks on December 20, 1918, after several unsuccessful attempts to confiscate them. Finally, the holy relics were sent to Petrograd's Military Medical Academy. There they remained for nearly eighty years. A second uncovering of St Alexander's relics took place in December 1997, before their return to the Svir Monastery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theorthodoxword.com/back%20articles/OW%20PDFs/236/A%20Brief%20Life%20of%20St%20Alexander%20of%20Svir.pdf The Marvelous Wonderworker of All Russia, Holy Venerable Alexander of Svir.

* [[Saint Job of Pochayiv]]
* [[Saint John the Russian]]
* [[Ioasaph of Belgorod|Saint Ioasaph of Belgorod]] – In 1918 the Bolsheviks removed Saint Ioasaph's relics from his shrine in the cathedral of the Holy Trinity at Belgorod, and for some seventy years, their whereabouts remained unknown. In 1927, the cathedral itself was demolished. In the late 1980s, the relics were discovered in [[Leningrad]]'s Museum of Religion and Atheism, and on 16 September 1991, they were solemnly returned to the new Cathedral of the Transfiguration of Our Lord in Belgorod, in the presence of [[Alexy II of Moscow|Patriarch Alexy II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/nm/duga/sec041.htm ST.

During marble excavations on the [[Appian Way]] in Spring 1485, workers found three marble coffins. In one, twelve feet underground, was the corpse of a young woman, said to have looked as if it had been buried that day, despite being about 1500 years old. The corpse attracted 20,000 plus crowds of spectators in the first few days, many of whom believed it to be of [[Tullia (daughter of Cicero)|Tullia, daughter of Cicero]], whose epitaph was on one of the tombs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xqroj_IS9rwC&amp;pg=PT199&amp;lpg=PT199&amp;ots=SbdGUVuziC&amp;focus=viewport Translated letters about tombs on Appian Way, from ''Pagan and Christian Rome'' by Rodolfo Lanciani, 1896]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Infierno en el Ring'' (2010)''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Inferno in the ring") was a [[professional wrestling]] [[Card (sports)#Supercard|supercard]] produced by [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL), which took place on June 18, 2010 in [[Arena Mexico]], [[Mexico City, Mexico]]. Previous year's ''Infierno en el Ring'' events have been held on Fridays, replacing CMLL's regularly scheduled [[CMLL Super Viernes|Super Viernes]] show, but in 2010 the event was held on Sunday night instead. The 2010 Infierno en el Ring is the third show under that name and the 13th time CMLL have promoted an ''Infierno en el Ring'' cage match.

The main event of the show will be the eponymous ''Infierno en el Ring'' match that CMLL traditionally has traditionally held approximately once a year and which has headlined its own specific show since 2008. The ''Infierno en el Ring'' match is a multi-man [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|Steel Cage]] match contested under ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'', or bet match, rules which means that the loser of the match would be forced to unmask per. Lucha Libre traditions. At the 2010 event 12 wrestlers will put their mask on the line in the match: [[Ángel de Oro]], [[Ángel de Plata]], [[Ángel Azteca Jr.]], [[Diamante (male wrestler)|Diamante]], [[Fabián el Gitano]], [[Sensei (wrestler)|Sensei]],  [[Hooligan (wrestler)|Hooligan]], [[Monster (wrestler)|Monster]], [[Puma King]], [[Tiger Kid]], [[Doctor X (wrestler)|Doctor X]] and [[Histeria (wrestler)|Histeria]]. The match saw Ángel de Oro pin Fabián el Gitano to unmask him. The show also featured three [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Trios rules (Relevos Australianos)|Six-man "Lucha Libre rules" tag team match]] and a [[tag team]] match to open the show.

==Production==
===Background===
The Mexican [[wrestling promotion|wrestling company]] ''[[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]]'' (Spanish for "World Wrestling Council"; CMLL) has held a number of major shows over the years using the moniker ''Infierno en el Ring'' ("Inferno in the Ring"), all of which were main evented by a multi-man [[steel cage match]], the eponymous ''Infierno en el Ring'' match. CMLL has use the ''Infierno en el Ring'' match on other shows, but will intermittently hold a show billed specifically as ''Infierno en el Ring'', with the first such show held in 2008. It is not an annually recurring show, but instead held intermittently sometimes several years apart and not always in the same month of the year either. All ''Infierno en el Ring'' shows have been held in [[Arena México]] in [[Mexico City, Mexico]] which is CMLL's main venue, its "home".&lt;ref name=Mondo&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha A Go-Go: the bizarre &amp; honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=El nacimient de un sueño (the birth of a dream)|pages=41–50|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, which means the ''Infierno en el Ring'' '' shows replace their regularly scheduled ''[[CMLL Super Viernes|Super Viernes]]'' show.&lt;ref name=Mondo/&gt; The 2010 ''Infierno en el Ring'' show was the third show to use the name.

===Storylines===
The event featured five [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

The foundation of the 12-man steel cage match storyline began around April, 2010 with a developing rivalry between the ''[[Face (professional wrestling)|tecnico]]'' (good guy) [[Fabián el Gitano]] and the ''[[Heel (professional wrestling)|rudo]]'' (bad guy) [[Doctor X (wrestler)|Doctor X]] on CMLL's secondary shows in [[Guadalajara]], [[Jalisco]]. After a month of mask challenges between the two the feud was finally featured in CMLL's main venue, [[Arena Mexico]] in late May, indicating that a potential ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'', mask vs. mask match, could be happening soon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://superluchas.net/2010/05/12/fabian-el-gitano-vs-dr-x-%C2%BFpor-las-mascaras/  | title= Fabián el Gitano vs Dr. X ¿Por las Mascaras? | author= Ruiz Glez, Alex | date= May 12, 2010 | accessdate= July 10, 2010 | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout May and June several other mid-card wrestlers became involved in storylines that saw ''Apuesta'' challenges made. The team of [[Ángel de Oro]], [[Ángel de Plata]] and [[Sensei (wrestler)|Sensei]] challenged the team of [[Puma King]], [[Tiger Kid]] and [[Arkangel de la Muerte]] to an ''Apuesta'' match after Arkangel cheated to win a trios match.&lt;ref name=LuchasJuly2&gt;{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2010/06/26/resultados-arena-mexico-25-jun-10-%c2%a1regreso-la-peste-negra/ | title= Resultados Arena México (25 jun 2010): ¡Regresó La Peste Negra! | date= June 26, 2010 | accessdate= July 8, 2010 | author= Rivera, Manuel | publisher=''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the ''Infierno en el Ring'' match was finally announced Arkangel de la Muerte was not among the participants, instead his ''[[Los Guerreros Tuareg]]'' teammate [[Hooligan (wrestler)|Hooligan]] was in addition to [[Ángel Azteca Jr.]], [[Diamante (male wrestler)|Diamante]] and ''[[Los Invasores]]'' members [[Monster (wrestler)|Monster]] and [[Histeria (wrestler)|Histeria]]. Histeria's inclusion in the match was a bit of a surprise as he was also scheduled to participate in a 10 man ''Lucha de Apuesta'' match on June 12, only 6 days before ''Infierno en el Ring'', with the booking either revealing that Histeria was keeping his mask, or announced as a misdirection to make Histeria's mask loss on June 12 more of a surprise.

The announced undercard featured three [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Trios rules (Relevos Australianos)|Six-man "Lucha Libre rules" tag team match]], the most common match form in CMLL. These matches feature a combination of ongoing storylines, emerging storylines or seemingly random teams. In the semi-main event [[Místico]] teams up with [[Shocker (wrestler)|Shocker]] and [[Brazo de Plata]] to take on [[Jushin Thunder Liger]], [[Atlantis (wrestler)|Atlantis]] and [[Héctor Garza]]. The two main focal points in the match is Místico's rivalry with [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]]'s Jushin Thunder Liger who's on tour with CMLL, potentially building to a title match between the two over the [[CMLL World Welterweight Championship]] which Liger holds. The other storyline featured in the semi-main event is the feud between Brazo de Plata and Héctor Garza. Plata and Garza used to team together, with Garza even helping Brazo de Plata losing some of his considerable weight. In May, 2010 Héctor Garza turned ''rudo'' on his friends, attacking them during a match and ever since he has been at odds with Brazo de Plata.

In the third match of the night [[Mexican National Welterweight Championship|Mexican National Welterweight Champion]] [[Valiente (wrestler)|Valiente]] teamed up with the reigning [[CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship|CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Champions]] [[Stuka Jr.]] and [[Fuego (wrestler)|Fuego]]. They will take on the team of [[Misterioso II]], who was looking for a title match with Valiente and [[Virus (wrestler)|Virus]] and [[Euforia (wrestler)|Euforia]] who represented the group ''[[Los Cancerberos del Infierno]]'', which has been trying to take the Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship away from the current champions.

==Event==
The show opened with the man who was unmasked the last time CMLL held an ''Infierno en el Ring'' match, [[Tigre Blanco]] teaming up with the rookie [[Metatron]] to take on the team of [[Inquisidor]] and [[El Cholo]], who had been paired up for the show. The ''tecnico'' team of Tigre and Metatron won the first fall when Metatron pinned Inquisidor and Tigre Blanco pinned Cholo. In the second fall the ''rudo'' team tied up the score 1-1 when Cholo pinned Metatron and Inquisidor pinned Tigre Blanco. The third fall was the longest of the match and saw Tigre Blanco win the match for his team.&lt;ref name=Infierno2010Quick&gt;{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2010/07/19/cmll-infierno-en-el-ring-18-julio-2010-%c2%a1fabian-el-gitano-pierde-la-mascara/ | title= CMLL: Infierno en el Ring (18 julio 2010): ¡Fabián el Gitano pierde la máscara | first= Manuel | last= Rivera | date= July 19, 2010 | accessdate= July 19, 2010 | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language= Spanish | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100722000505/http://superluchas.net/2010/07/19/cmll-infierno-en-el-ring-18-julio-2010-%C2%A1fabian-el-gitano-pierde-la-mascara/ | archivedate= July 22, 2010 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LuchaWorldInfierno&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.luchaworld.com/?p=4749 | title= Lucha Report For 7/18/10 | author= Kris Zellner | date= July 18, 2010 | accessdate= July 19, 2010 | publisher= Lucha World}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Infierno2010&gt;{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2010/07/19/cmll-infierno-en-el-ring-18-julio-2010-%c2%a1fabian-el-gitano-pierde-la-mascara/ | title= CMLL: Infierno en el Ring (18 julio 2010): ¡Fabián el Gitano pierde la máscara! | author= Rivera, Manuel | date= July 19, 2010 | accessdate= July 19, 2010 | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language= Spanish | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100722000505/http://superluchas.net/2010/07/19/cmll-infierno-en-el-ring-18-julio-2010-%C2%A1fabian-el-gitano-pierde-la-mascara/ | archivedate= July 22, 2010 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second match of the night saw two substitutes take place compared to the original card. [[Luna Mágica]] was originally scheduled to team with [[Lady Apache]] and [[Marcela (wrestler)|Marcela]], but was replaced with [[Dalys la Caribeña]], the wife of [[Negro Casas]] who made her wrestling debut in 2010. On the ''Rudo'' side [[Mima Shimoda]] was supposed to team up with ''Las Zorras'' ("The Foxes"; [[Princesa Blanca]] and [[Princesa Sujei]]), but instead they teamed up with [[La Seductora]] without any explanations of why the replacements were made. ''Las Zorras'' took the first fall after Princesa Sujei pinned Lady Apache following a ''Torbellino'' splash and Princesa Blanca pinned Dalys. In the second fall the ''tecnicas'' regained momentum when Marcela executed what was described as a "brutal [[Professional wrestling throws#Michinoku Driver II|Michinoku Driver]]" on La Seductora and pinned her. In the final fall Dalys la Caribeña uses the Casas trademark ''La Casita'' [[Pinfall (professional wrestling)#La magistral|cradle]] to gain the three count and the victory for her team. Following the match Lady Apache and Marcela hugged, showing no signs of animosity despite being booked for a singles match against each other on the following [[CMLL Super Viernes (July 2010)#July 23, 2010|Super Viernes]].&lt;ref name=Infierno2010Quick/&gt;&lt;ref name=LuchaWorldInfierno/&gt;&lt;ref name=Infierno2010/&gt;

Misterioso II and ''Los Cancerberos'' both improved their chances of gaining a championship match down the line as they defeated Mexican National Welterweight Champion Valiente and CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Champions Stuka Jr. and Fuego two falls to one. Misterioso pinned Fuego and Virus pinned Stuka Jr. In the second fall the champions Valiente took out Virus with a ''[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Topé|Topé suicida]]'' while Stuka Jr. pinned Misteriosos after a ''[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Plancha|Plancha]]'' style splash. Despite a moment of miscommunication where Misterioso kicked Euforia the team still managed to win the match when Misterioso pinned Fuego. Following the match the ''rudos'' shook hands, clearing up any misunderstandings between them.&lt;ref name=Infierno2010Quick/&gt;&lt;ref name=LuchaWorldInfierno/&gt;&lt;ref name=Infierno2010/&gt;

The fourth match saw two replacements made just like the second match of the night had. On the ''tecnico'' side [[Maximo (wrestler)|Máximo]] replaced his father Brazo de Plata, teaming with Místico and Shocker while Héctor Garza was replaced by [[Último Guerrero]] teaming up with fellow ''[[Los Guerreros del Atlantidad]]'' member Atlantis and Jushin Thunder Liger. Liger almost won the first fall for his team when he applied a submission move on Máximo, but before Máximo could submit Místico and Shocker surprised ''Los Guerreros'' by rolling them up for the pinfall victory. Liger's team gained a measure of revenge when Liger pinned Shocker after a [[Powerbomb#Sitout powerbomb|Ligerbomb]]. The third and deciding fall came when Místico used his trademark ''La Mística'' submission hold, giving the ''tecnicos'' the 2-1 victory.&lt;ref name=Infierno2010Quick/&gt;&lt;ref name=LuchaWorldInfierno/&gt;&lt;ref name=Infierno2010/&gt;

The CMLL crew took less than 15 minutes to set up the steel cage for the main event, which was fast for the type of cage that CMLL uses. After the cage was assembled the participants for the ''Infierno en el Ring'' match came to the ring, ''tecnicos'' first (Ángel de Oro, Ángel de Plata, Ángel Azteca Jr., Diamante, Fabián el Gitano and Sensei) followed by the ''rudos'' (Doctor X, Hooligan, Puma King, Tiger Kid, Monster and Histeria). Before the match it was announced that there would be a three-minute time limit where wrestlers were not allowed to escape the cage. Once the bell rings all 12 wrestlers began fighting, some pairing up against the wrestlers they had been feuding with for a while, Dr. X and Fabián el Gitano, ''Los Ángeles'' and Puma King and Tiger Kid. The theme of the match was "every man for himself", demonstrated by Hooligan as he was the first man to escape after the time limit expired, distracting his teammate Doctor X in order to escape the cage. Ángel de Oro and Ángel de Plata both climbed the cage at the same time, only to have Ángel de Plata pull his brother off the cage so he could escape himself. While the other wrestlers were preoccupied Monster saw an opening and climbed out of the cage, the third man to escape the match. Moments later Sensei becomes the fourth man to escape the cage, keeping his mask safe. The brother team of Puma King and Tiger Kid are the next to try to escape the cage, but like with the Ángel brothers Tiger Kid prevented his brother from escaping so that he could get out of the cage himself. Out next was Ángel Azteca Jr. who climbed over the cage to ensure he would not have to fight for his mask that night. Puma King and Ángel de Oro seemed to work together to escape the cage, only for Puma King to double cross Ángel de Oro so that Puma King could escape the cage. With Diamante's escape there are only four wrestlers left in the ring. Histeria quickly abandons fellow ''rudo'' Doctor X to escape the cage, saving his match for the second time in a week. In the cage Ángel de Oro accidentally hit Fabián el Gitano when he was trying to hit Doctor X. This gave the Doctor an opening to escape the cage, choosing to leave the cage instead of trying to punish his rival Fabián el Gitano further.&lt;ref name=Infierno2010Quick/&gt;&lt;ref name=LuchaWorldInfierno/&gt;&lt;ref name=Infierno2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=FuegoInfierno&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fuegoenelring.com/articles_noticias_full.php?articles_id=1034 | title= Fabian 2El Gitano" se quema en el Infierno | date= July 19, 2010 | accessdate= July 19, 2010 | publisher= ''Fuego en el Ring'' | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Ángel de Oro and Fabián el Gitano were the last two men left in the cage they were forced to wrestle against each other under ''Lucha de Apuesta'' rules inside the cage. After a short match between the two Ángel de Oro pinned Fabián, earning his first mask victory of his career. Following the match Fabián el Gitano unmasked, then announced that he real name was Emilio Fabian Fernandez de Leon born in Mexico City, 38 years old and had 16 years of wrestling experience. Following Ángel de Oro's victory his brother Ángel de Plata came to the ring to congratulate his brother without any signs of resentment for the actions taken during the match.&lt;ref name=Infierno2010Quick/&gt;&lt;ref name=LuchaWorldInfierno/&gt;&lt;ref name=Infierno2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=FuegoInfierno/&gt;

The '''International Kodály Seminar''' was named after the famous Hungarian musician, ''[[Zoltán Kodály]]'', who was a composer, pedagogue, ethnomusicologist. He is well-known around the world as the creator of a music method: ''[[Kodály method]]''. Foreign musicians from all over the world come to see his birthplace, ''Kecskemét'' to get some inspiration, learn his method for a better pedagogy and listen to Hungarian choirs and concerts. These are the main points for musicians to visit ''[[Kecskemét]], Bács-Kiskun county''.

==History==
1970 was the year when the name and the event was born. ''Zoltán Kodály''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bacstudastar.hu/kz-csaladja|title=KZ családja - Bácstudástár|accessdate=2017-03-31|work=www.bacstudastar.hu|language=hu-HU}}&lt;/ref&gt;''’s widow'' and the primary and secondary Kodály school’s director, [http://www.parlando.hu/Nemesszegi.htm ''Márta'' ''Nemesszeghyné Szentkirályi''] had an idea about an international summer course. For their initiation the city advertised this course for learning the Hungarian music teaching in schools and the method’s basics. A lot of people interested in this course, so after two years the International Kodály Seminar was held again, second time. The first was in 1970 and the second, two years later, in 1972.

Since 1975, ''the [http://www.kodaly-inst.hu/en Kodály Institute of the Liszt Ferenc Academy]'' was active, they started organising the third Kodály Seminar. /The Seminar is organized every second year. An International Music Festival is also held at the same time./ While the first two courses’ main goal was for foreign professional musicians and was about the school teaching in music schools, since 1975 there was a big change, because they wanted to make the courses interesting for the Hungarian pedagogues too.

Their programmes, variations of opportunities was also motivating for the Hungarian audience. The aim of the Kodály Seminars was that: refreshing the possibilities, abilities to help the music teachers, conductors in their daily work. Kodály Seminar became year by year a voluntary self-education course; how to be a “good musician” and the human and professional music symbol.

Nowadays the aim of these courses is the comprehensive demonstration of the Hungarian music education in practical and pedagogical works, Kodály’s and [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]]’s lifework. The programme consists of daily conducting lessons, solfege lessons, methodology classes, choral singing and concerts.

In 1987 with the Seminar the International Kodály Symposium was held; a new summer programme started. Workshops were in different topics: folk music, music analysis.

The 20th International Kodály Seminar was held in 1999 which was the [http://www.bacstudastar.hu/image/image_gallery?uuid=f0a0ba33-a626-4625-8885-03ab84d75231&amp;groupId=10804&amp;t=1330598852454 Jubilee] of the tradition since 1970.

There have been approximately 2200 participants from 42 different countries during the Seminars.

In this year (17-28 July 2017) will be the 29th International Kodaly Seminar with a lot of programmes and concerts.

[http://www.slate.com/id/2155249/ Days of Wine...and More Wine]&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the celebration included only [[winemaker]]s, cellar workers, and the surrounding community. It has since evolved to become an international [[wine]] event, and an integral part of ''Les Trois Glorieuses'', which also includes a charity auction held at the [[Hospices de Beaune]] and a formal dinner at the [[Clos de Vougeot]]. Approximately 700 people attend the lunch, held in the Château de Meursault.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'': Diner's Journal (November 28, 2006). [http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/11/28/la-paulee La Paulée]&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was formally organized in the mid-1920s by the Count Lafon.&lt;ref name=sl/&gt; Traditionally, the winemakers would compete to bring the best bottle of wine to impress their favorite clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Burgundy: A comprehensive guide to the producers, appellations and wines|last=Parker |first=Robert |year=1990 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=0-671-63378-3 |page=235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era, [[Domaine des Comtes Lafon|Dominique Lafon]], grandson of Count Lafon, participates in and helps organize the event.

==Other Paulées==
Since 2000, [[Daniel Johnnes]] has been hosting La Paulée de New York and La Paulée de San Francisco, which have been officially recognized by the organizers of the original La Paulée de Meursault.{{fact|date=August 2018}} A celebration of the greatest [[wines of Burgundy]], Johnnes' version of La Paulée features seminars, [[wine tasting|tastings]], and [[food and wine pairing|wine-paired]] dinners, culminating in the Saturday Grand Tasting and Gala Dinner. [[Financial Times]] has asserted that La Paulée "can reasonably be described as the greatest Bacchanalia on the face of the earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steinberger|first=Michael|title=Bacchanalian antics in the Big Apple|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/5768553c-d420-11db-83d5-000b5df10621.html#axzz22nQqb8Ee|work=Financial Times|publisher=Pearson PLC|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name "La Paul&amp;eacute;e" comes from the French word for sauté pan, ''poile''. In its earliest incarnations, the post-harvest meal was so simple that it was cooked in a single ''poile''.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Larry, ''The Atlantic'' (January 21, 2011).

{{Buddhism}}
'''Life release''' is a traditional [[Buddhist]] practise of saving the lives of beings that were destined for slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shabkar.org/donation/ Tsethar - The Practice of Saving Lives]&lt;/ref&gt; This practise is performed by all schools of Buddhism: [[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]].&lt;ref name=khordong&gt;[http://www.khordong.de/news/blogs/index.php?blog=3&amp;title=tsethar_for_taklung_tsetrul_rinpoche&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1 Tsethar for Taklung Tsetrul Rinpoche] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130412075312/http://www.khordong.de/news/blogs/index.php?blog=3&amp;title=tsethar_for_taklung_tsetrul_rinpoche&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1 |date=2013-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known as "Tsethar" in [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=kagyu&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kagyu.org/ktd/liferelease.php |title=Life Release |publisher=Karma Triyana Dharmachakra |author= |date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000250/http://www.kagyu.org/ktd/liferelease.php |archivedate=2013-12-03 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While this practise of life release may naturally need to be spontaneous to successfully save an endangered life, life release can also be planned. Planning often involves purchasing an animal directly from a slaughterhouse or a fishermen; this can often take place on auspicious days in the [[Buddhist calendar]] in order for the merit of the act to be multiplied thousands of times.&lt;ref name=khordong /&gt; Animals are blessed before being safely returned to their natural environment as [[Prayer in Buddhism|prayers]] are made and often dedicated to someone who is ill or has died, with the belief that person will benefit too from this dedication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/A%20-%20Tibetan%20Buddhism/Authors/Yutang%20Lin/Releasing%20Lives%20to%20Freedom/The%20Buddhist%20Practice%20of%20Releasing%20Lives%20to%20Freedom.htm The Buddhist Practice of Releasing Lives to Freedom]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tibet]] an animal is often marked by a ribbon to indicate that the life of the animal has been liberated, with the general understanding that it will be allowed to die of natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shambhalatimes.org/2011/06/30/a-yaks-tale-of-liberation/ Shambhala Times Community News Magazine » A Yak’s Tale of Liberation]&lt;/ref&gt; The practise in Tibetan Buddhism has been championed in recent times by [[Chatral Rinpoche]], [[Dilgo Khyentse Yangsi Rinpoche]] and [[Ogyen Trinley Dorje]]. Although this is seen to be the traditional way of carrying out this practise, Ogyen Trinley Dorje has commented that the meaning is broad and that people can use their intelligence to expand the practise in other ways; indicating that planting one tree may be more beneficial that carrying out Tsethar for many beings.&lt;ref name=kagyu /&gt;

It is increasingly recognized that animal release has the potential for negative environmental impacts, including as a pathway for the introduction of [[invasive species]] into non-native environments. This may lead to [[biodiversity loss]] over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=Contemporary Buddhism |title=Buddhist Animal Release Practices: Historic, Environmental, Public Health And Economic Concerns |first=Henry |last=Shiu |first2=Leah |last2=Stokes |year=2008 |volume=9 |issue=2 |

Further, some animals are captured for the explicit purpose of being released, or are released into environments where they are unable to survive.&lt;ref name=hsi /&gt;

American singer [[Beyoncé]] has embarked on seven [[Concert#Concert tour|concert tours]] during her solo career, five of which have been worldwide and one of which have been collaborative as well as one of which being just in Europe.{{refn|group=nb|The tours and performances by Beyoncé within the group [[Destiny's Child]] are not included.}} Her solo tour debut (whilst on hiatus with [[Destiny's Child]]) began in 2003, with the [[Dangerously in Love Tour]]. Based predominantly in the United Kingdom, the tour received an unfavorable review from Dave Simpson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' based on Beyoncé's costumes and a confusion of her core audience at the time.&lt;ref name="DIL review"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/nov/04/popandrock3|title=Beyoncé, Manchester Arena|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Dave|last=Simpson|date=November 4, 2003|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, she embarked on her first major solo world tour&amp;nbsp;– [[The Beyoncé Experience]], following Destiny's Child's disbandment in 2005.

The {{nihongo|'''Lost Decade''' or the '''Lost 10 Years'''|失われた十年|Ushinawareta Jūnen}} is a period of [[economic stagnation]] in [[Japan]] following the Japanese [[Japanese asset price bubble|asset price bubble]]'s collapse in late 1991 and early 1992.

==Causes==
[[File:Japan federal funds rate.png|thumb|300px|[[Bank of Japan|BOJ]] monetary policy causing recessions in Japan]]
Japan's [[Japanese economic miracle|strong economic growth]] in the second half of the 20th century ended abruptly at the start of the 1990s. The Plaza Accord doubling of the exchange rate value of the dollar versus the yen between 1985 to 1987 fueled a speculative [[Japanese asset price bubble|asset price bubble]] of a massive scale. The bubble was caused by the excessive loan growth quotas dictated on the banks by Japan's central bank, the [[Bank of Japan]], through a policy mechanism known as the "window guidance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = New Paradigm in Macroeconomics|url = http://www.palgraveconnect.com/doifinder/10.1057/9780230506077|doi = 10.1057/9780230506077|first = Richard|last = Werner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/1467-8381.00145 | volume=16 | issue=2 | title=Monetary Policy Implementation in Japan: What They Say versus What They Do | journal=Asian Economic Journal | pages=111–151 | last1 = Werner | first1 = Richard A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As economist [[Paul Krugman]] explained, "Japan's banks lent more, with less regard for quality of the borrower, than anyone else's. In doing so they helped inflate the bubble economy to grotesque proportions."&lt;ref name="Krugman 2009" /&gt;

Trying to deflate speculation and keep inflation in check, the [[Bank of Japan]] sharply raised inter-bank lending rates in late 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/25/business/japan-raises-interest-rates.html|title = Japan Raised Interest Rates|last = |first = |date = December 25, 1989|work = Reuters via The New York Times|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This sharp policy caused the bursting of the bubble and the Japanese stock market crashed. Equity and asset prices fell, leaving overly leveraged Japanese banks and insurance companies with books full of bad debt. The financial institutions were bailed out through capital infusions from the [[Government of Japan|government]], loans and cheap credit from the central bank, and the ability to postpone the recognition of losses, ultimately turning them into [[zombie bank]]s. [[Yalman Onaran]] of [[Bloomberg News]] writing in ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' stated that the zombie banks were one of the reasons for the following long stagnation.&lt;ref name="salon1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/11/25/kill_the_zombie_banks/|title= Kill the zombie banks! |last=Onaran|first=Yalman|date=2011-11-25|publisher=Salon Media Groupn|accessdate=2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally Michael Schuman of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine noted that these banks kept injecting new funds into unprofitable "[[Zombie company|zombie firms]]" to keep them afloat, arguing that they were [[too big to fail]]. However, most of these companies were too debt-ridden to do much more than survive on bail-out funds. Schuman believed that Japan's economy did not begin to recover until this practice had ended.&lt;ref name="schumantimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1867847,00.html|title= Why Detroit Is Not Too Big to Fail|last=Schuman|first=Michael|date=2008-12-19|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, many of these failing firms became unsustainable, and a wave of consolidation took place, resulting in four national banks in Japan&lt;!---compared to what?---&gt;. Many Japanese firms were burdened with heavy debts, and it became very difficult to obtain credit. Many borrowers turned to [[sarakin]] (loan sharks) for loans.  As of 2012, the official interest rate was 0.1%;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grips.ac.jp/teacher/oono/hp/lecture_J/lec13.htm|title=Economic Development of Japan|last=Ohno|first=Kenichi|publisher=[[National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies]]|accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the interest rate has remained below 1% since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.stat-search.boj.or.jp/ssi/cgi-bin/famecgi2?cgi=$graphwnd_en|title = Bank of Japan Interest Rates|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects&lt;!---cite?---&gt;&lt;!---compared to what?---&gt;==
Despite mild economic recovery in the 2000s, [[conspicuous consumption]] of the 1980s has not returned to the same pre-crash levels. Difficult times in the 1990s made people frown on ostentatious displays of wealth, while Japanese firms such as [[Toyota]] and [[Sony]] which had dominated their respective industries in the 1980s had to fend off strong competition from rival firms based in other East Asian countries, particularly [[South Korea]]. Many Japanese companies replaced a large part of their workforce with temporary workers, who had little job security and fewer benefits.  As of 2009, these non-traditional employees made up more than a third of the labor force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/22/business/worldbusiness/22japan.html?fta=y | work=The New York Times | title=When Consumers Cut Back: An Object Lesson From Japan | first=Hiroko | last=Tabuchi | date=2009-02-22 | accessdate=2010-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the wider Japanese workforce, wages have stagnated. From their peak in 1997, real wages have since fallen around 13%&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;—an unprecedented number among developed nations.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The wider economy of Japan is still recovering from the impact of the 1991 crash and subsequent lost decades. It took 12 years for Japan's GDP to recover to the same levels as 1995. And as a greater sign of economic malaise, Japan also fell behind in output per capita. In 1991, real output per capita in Japan was 14% higher than that of Australia, but in 2011 real output had dropped to 14% below Australia's levels.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2012/08/lost-decades|title = The Japanese Tragedy|last = |first = |date = |work = The Economist Blog|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the span of 20 years, Japan's economy was overtaken not only in gross output, but labor efficiency, whereas previously it was a global leader in both.

In response to chronic deflation and low growth, Japan has attempted economic stimulus and thereby run a fiscal deficit since 1991.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21577080-shinzo-abes-government-looks-likely-disappoint-fiscal-consolidation-dont|title = Don't Mention the Debt|last = |first = |date = May 4, 2013|work = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These economic stimuli have had at best nebulous effects on the Japanese economy and have contributed to the huge debt burden on the Japanese government. Expressed as a percentage of GDP, at 240% Japan has the highest level of debt of any nation on earth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While Japan's is a special case where the majority of public debt is held in the domestic market and by the Bank of Japan, the sheer size of the debt demands large service payments and is a worrying sign of the country's financial health.

==Interpretation==
Economist [[Paul Krugman]] has argued that Japan's lost decade is an example of a [[liquidity trap]] (a situation in which monetary policy is unable to lower nominal interest rates because these are close to zero). He explained how truly massive the asset bubble was in Japan by 1990, with a tripling of land and stock market prices during the prosperous 1980s. Japan's high personal savings rates, driven in part by the demographics of an aging population, enabled Japanese firms to rely heavily on traditional bank loans from supporting banking networks, as opposed to issuing stock or bonds via the capital markets to acquire funds. The cozy relationship of corporations to banks and the implicit guarantee of a taxpayer bailout of bank deposits created a significant [[moral hazard]] problem, leading to an atmosphere of [[crony capitalism]] and reduced lending standards. In so doing they helped inflate the bubble economy to grotesque proportions." The Bank of Japan began increasing interest rates in 1990 due in part to concerns over the bubble and in 1991 land and stock prices began a steep decline, within a few years reaching 60% below their peak.&lt;ref name="Krugman 2009"&gt;{{cite book| last = Krugman| first = Paul| year = 2009| title = The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008 | publisher = W.W. Norton Company Limited| isbn = 978-0-393-07101-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Richard Koo]] wrote that Japan's "Great Recession" that began in 1990 was a "[[balance sheet recession]]". It was triggered by a collapse in land and stock prices, which caused Japanese firms to become [[insolvent]], meaning their assets were worth less than their liabilities. Despite zero [[interest rate]]s and expansion of the money supply to encourage borrowing, Japanese corporations in aggregate opted to pay down their debts from their own business earnings rather than borrow to invest as firms typically do. Corporate investment, a key demand component of [[GDP]], fell enormously (22% of GDP) between 1990 and its peak decline in 2003. Japanese firms overall became net savers after 1998, as opposed to borrowers. Koo argues that it was massive fiscal stimulus (borrowing and spending by the government) that offset this decline and enabled Japan to maintain its level of GDP. In his view, this avoided a U.S. type [[Great Depression]], in which U.S. GDP fell by 46%. He argued that monetary policy was ineffective because there was limited demand for funds while firms paid down their liabilities.  In a balance sheet recession, GDP declines by the amount of debt repayment and un-borrowed individual savings, leaving government stimulus spending as the primary remedy.&lt;ref name="Koo 2009"&gt;{{cite book| last = Koo| first = Richard| year = 2009| title = The Holy Grail of Macroeconomics-Lessons from Japan's Great Recession | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons (Asia) Pte.

Economist Scott Sumner has argued that Japan's monetary policy was too tight during the Lost Decade and thus prolonged the pain felt by the Japanese economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sumner|first=Scott|title=Why Japan's QE didn't "work"|url=http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=9404|work=The Money Illusion|accessdate=November 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sumner|first=Scott|title=More evidence that the BOJ is not trying to create inflation|url=http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=8091|work=The Money Illusion|accessdate=November 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sumner|first=Scott|title=Rooseveltian Resolve|url=http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=3587|work=The Money Illusion|accessdate=November 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sumner|first=Scott|title=The other money illusion|url=http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=6937|work=The Money Illusion|accessdate=November 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists [[Fumio Hayashi]] and [[Edward Prescott]] argue that the anemic performance of the Japanese economy since the early 1990s is mainly due to the low growth rate of aggregate productivity. Their hypothesis stands in direct contrast to popular explanations that are based in terms of an extended credit crunch that emerged in the aftermath of a bursting asset “bubble.” They are led to explore the implications of their hypothesis on the basis of evidence that suggests that despite the ongoing difficulties in the Japanese banking sector, desired capital expenditure was for the most part fully financed. They suggest that Japan’s sluggish investment activity is likely to be better understood in terms of low levels of desired capital expenditure and not in terms of credit constraints that prohibit firms from financing projects with positive net present value (NPV). Monetary or fiscal policies might increase consumption in the short run, but unless productivity growth increases, there is a legitimate fear that such a policy may simply transform Japan from a low-growth/low-inflation economy to a low-growth/high-inflation economy.

In her analysis of Japan's gradual path to economic success and then quick reversal, Jennifer Amyx noted that Japanese experts were not unaware of the possible causes of Japan's economic decline. Rather, to return Japan's economy back to the path to economic prosperity, policymakers would have had to adopt policies that would first cause short-term harm to the Japanese people and government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Amyx|first=Jennifer|title=Japan's Financial Crisis: Institutional Rigidity and Reluctant Change|date=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this analysis,  says Ian Lustick, Japan was stuck on a "local maximum," which it arrived at through gradual increases in its fitness level, set by the economic landscape of the 1970s and 80s. Without an accompanying change in institutional flexibility, Japan was unable to adapt to changing conditions and even though experts may have known which changes needed to be made, they would have been virtually powerless to enact those changes without instituting unpopular policies which would have been harmful in the short-term. Lustick's analysis is rooted in the application of [[Evolution|evolutionary theory]] and [[natural selection]] to understanding institutional rigidity in the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lustick|first=Ian|title=Institutional Rigidity|journal=Cliodynamics|date=2011|volume=2|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
After the [[Great Recession]] of 2007–2009, many Western governments and commentators have referenced the Lost Decade as a distinct economic possibility for stagnating developed nations. On February 9, 2009, in warning of the dire consequences facing the [[United States]] [[Economy of the United States|economy]] after its [[United States housing bubble|housing bubble]], U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] cited the "lost decade" as a prospect the American economy faced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123419281562063867?mod=djemalertNEWS | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Obama Warns of 'Lost Decade' | first1=Laura | last1=Meckler | first2=Jonathan | last2=Weisman | date=2009-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And in 2010, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President [[James B. Bullard|James Bullard]] warned that the United States was in danger of becoming "enmeshed in a Japanese-style deflationary outcome within the next several years."&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/10/09/Bullard.pdf The Seven Faces of 'The Peril'"]&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 25 years after the initial market crash, Japan is still feeling the effects of Lost Decade. However, several Japanese policymakers have attempted reforms to address the malaise in the Japanese economy. After [[Shinzō Abe|Shinzo Abe]] was elected as Japanese prime minister in December 2012, Abe introduced a reform program known as [[Abenomics]] which sought to address many of the issues raised by Japan's Lost Decade. His "three arrows" of reform intend to address Japan's chronically low inflation, decreasing worker productivity relative to other developed nations, and demographic issues raised by an aging population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21605905-shinzo-abe-has-best-chance-decades-changing-japan-better-he-seems-poised|title = The third arrow|last = |first = |date = June 28, 2014|work = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Investor response to the announced reform was strong, and the [[Nikkei 225]] rallied to 20,000 in May 2015 from a low of around 9,000 in 2008. The Bank of Japan has set a 2% target for consumer-price inflation, although success has been hampered by a sales tax increase enacted to balance the government budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10929752/Inflation-in-Japan-rises-to-30-year-high.html|title = Inflation in Japan rises to 30-year high|last = |first = |date = June 27, 2014|work = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It will land near the lunar south pole at the [[Boguslawsky (crater)|Boguslavsky]] crater.&lt;ref name="gunters"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was renamed from Luna-Glob lander to Luna 25 to emphasize the continuity of the Soviet [[Luna programme]] from the 1970s, though it is still part of what was at one point conceptualized as the [[Luna-Glob]] lunar exploration program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://de.sputniknews.com/wissen/20130408265891071-Russische-Mission-Luna-Glob-wird-in-Luna-25-umbenannt/|title=Russische Mission Luna-Glob wird in „Luna-25“ umbenannt|last=Sputnik|website=de.sputniknews.com|language=de|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The launch is scheduled for May 2021.&lt;ref name=russia&gt;{{cite web |title=Russian Launch Manifest |url=http://www.sworld.com.au/steven/space/russia-man.txt |first=Steven |last=Pietrobon |date=11 July 2018 |access-date=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== History ==
Nascent plans for what is now Luna 25 began in the late 1990s, with the evaluation of two spacecraft designs having taken place by 1998. Attempts to revive and complete the project continued throughout the 2000s and were punctuated by an aborted attempt at international cooperation via a merger with [[JAXA]]'s now-cancelled [[Lunar-A]] orbiter, and pressure from another attempted cooperative lunar mission with [[ISRO]] (which [[Chandrayaan-2|continued without Russia's involvement]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/luna_glob.html|title=Luna-Glob|date=2017-12-11|work=Russian Space Web|accessdate=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delays in the 2010s came first from the significant rework and delay brought on by the failure of [[Phobos-Grunt]] in 2011. This is the point at which the modern Luna 25 design was developed. Later, work on the lander was slowed by resource pressures being placed upon spacecraft developer [[NPO Lavochkin]], such as the weather satellite [[Elektro-L No.2]] and the [[Spektr-RG]] observatory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/luna_glob_2013.html|title=Luna-Glob (Luna-25) project in 2013|date=2013-04-06|work=Russian Space Web|accessdate=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well the landing platform Russia is contributing to [[ExoMars 2020]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/luna-glob-status-2015.html|title=Development of the Luna-Glob project in 2014 and 2015|work=Russian Space Web|accessdate=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2017, the propulsion system for the spacecraft was in assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/luna-glob-2017.html|title=Luna-Glob's stop and go|work=Russian Space Web|date=2017-12-15|accessdate=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
Initial mission plans called for a lander and orbiter, with the latter also deploying impact penetrators. In its current form, Luna 25 is a lander only, with a primary mission of proving out the landing technology. The mission will carry {{convert|30|kg|abbr=on}} of scientific instruments, including a robotic arm for soil samples and possible drilling hardware.&lt;ref name="gunters"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/luna-glob-lander.html|title=Luna-Glob lander (Luna 25)|work=Russian Space Web|date=2015-10-08|accessdate=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=''&gt;[https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4936026/russia-unveils-30m-plans-to-start-mining-on-the-moon/ VLAD'S OVER THE MOON: Russia unveils £30m plans to start mining on the Moon]. Patrick Knox, ''The Sun''. 17 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch is currently planned for May 2021 on a [[Soyuz-2.1b]] rocket with [[Fregat-M]] upper stage, from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome|Baikonur]] or [[Vostochny Cosmodrome|Vostochny]].&lt;ref name=russia /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2910">A '''metabibliography''' (or '''biblio-bibliography''') is a [[bibliography]] of bibliographies.

Bibliographies serve the finding of relevant documents. Metabibliographies serve the finding of the relevant bibliographies in which the relevant documents may be found. One might quote Patrick Wilson:

"For if knowledge is power, power over knowledge is power to increase one's power; and if the stock of writings is thought of mainly as it represents a stock of knowledge, it is natural to propose treating it as a "resource" to be subjected to rational control, managemenet and utilization." (Wilson, 1968, p. 145).

Metabibliographies are valuable for building reference collections, but usually of less interest to the average user, who rely on bibliographies selected by others.

==Illegitimacy== 
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
The Miss Teen World Pageant was independently produced by Gaspar Cruz and the Miss Teen World Organization now called Miss Teen Continents.

Miss World Limited, the owner of a number of trade mark registrations for the mark MISS WORLD, won a judicial battle against a Teen pageant based in the USA. Among Miss World’s registrations is a United States trade mark for MISS WORLD (no. 877221), which was first registered on 5 April 1968. Therefore, there could never be a “Miss Teen World”, if not organized by the Miss World Organization.

Miss World Limited has extensively used and developed its brand over the past 60 years, which has become a famous and well-respected trademark. Over the years, many new pageants and so-called organizations have tried to take advantage of it (just like it happens with Miss Universe as well), so Miss World Limited has always strongly protected its brand and defended its long-standing exclusive rights to the MISS WORLD name and trade mark.
After a two-year Federal Court lawsuit and trial in the United States, Miss World won it and the pageant formerly known as “Miss Teen World” produced by Gaspar Cruz has no right to use such name any longer.

The Court found in favor of the Miss World organisation on all its claims of federal trade mark infringement, dilution and unfair competition. Crucially, United States District Judge Vanessa D. Gilmore also found that as a result of Miss World’s continuous usage and promotion, “the MISS WORLD mark has become well-known and famous in the United States and internationally”.

The Court also went on to find that Mr Cruz’s use of the word “world” as part of his competitions as a trade marked name or as a title for his pageant winners caused actual confusion amongst the public and led to actual contempt of the Court’s earlier injunction.

The United States litigation highlighted Mr Cruz’s unauthorised international licensing of “Miss Teen World” where third parties are using the “Miss Teen World” name to run branded competitions in their own countries. The Court order enjoined Mr Cruz and all those acting in concert with or behalf of him from a number of activities including using the “Miss Teen World” name or any name which is similar to the MISS WORLD mark or likely to dilute its distinctive quality.
Miss World Limited takes the protection of its intellectual property and famous brand very seriously and will take any required action against an infringer of its MISS WORLD mark.
Such judicial decision should set an example and stop others from stealing intellectual property from Miss Universe, Miss World, or any other pageant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3896">[[Image:NBCUNICEFpromo.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The event was broadcast on NBC in the United States]]

'''The Music for UNICEF Concert: A Gift of Song''' was a [[benefit concert]] of [[popular music]] held in the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in [[New York City]] on January 9, 1979. It was intended to raise money for [[UNICEF]] world hunger programs and to mark the beginning of the [[International Year of the Child]]. The concert was [[videotape]]d and broadcast the following day on [[NBC]] in the U.S. and around the world. The moderator was [[David Frost]], with [[Gilda Radner]] and [[Henry Winkler]] also introducing some of the performers. [[Henry Fonda]] made a short appearance. Each performer signed a large parchment declaring support for UNICEF's goals.

The concert was the idea of impresario [[Robert Stigwood]], the [[Bee Gees]], and David Frost, who originally conceived it as an annual event. Not all of the performances were truly live, with [[ABBA]] [[lip-synching]] their new song "[[Chiquitita]]" and the [[Bee Gees]] lip-synching their song "[[Too Much Heaven]]". [http://felpin80.tripod.com/ata/1976-1979.html] It raised less than one million dollars at the time for UNICEF,  although this figure did not include longer-term royalties from the songs and repeat performances.[http://nbc15.madison.com/entertainment/headlines/2168262.html]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

==Performers==
The Music for UNICEF Concert featured some of the biggest names in [[pop music]] at the time, and the performers donated their performance [[royalties]] and those from one song each to UNICEF. (The Bee Gees' song "[[Too Much Heaven]]", for example, had earned more than seven million dollars for UNICEF as of 2003). However, some artists released the royalties for only a limited time. Most of the songs performed were disco and not specifically about the issue of child poverty.

[[Elton John]] was scheduled to perform but did not appear.

A recording of the concert was released on an [[Gramophone record|LP]] on [[Polydor]] Records several weeks later, with the performances in a different running order.

*[[ABBA]] — "[[Chiquitita]]"
*[[Bee Gees]] — "[[Too Much Heaven]]"
*[[Andy Gibb]]— "[[Shadow Dancing (album)|I Go For You]]"
*[[Andy Gibb]] and [[Olivia Newton-John]] — "[[Rest Your Love on Me]]"
*[[Olivia Newton-John]] — "The Key"
*[[John Denver]] — "[[Rhymes &amp; Reasons (John Denver album)|Rhymes &amp; Reasons]]"
*[[Earth, Wind &amp; Fire]] — "[[September (Earth, Wind &amp; Fire song)|September]]"
*[[Rita Coolidge]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]] — "Fallen Angels" 
*[[Rod Stewart]] — "[[Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?]]"
*[[Donna Summer]] — "Mimi's Song"

There were also opening and closing songs, performed by all participants:
*Opening medley, ending with part of ABBA's "[[He Is Your Brother]]"
*Closing song: [[Jackie DeShannon]]'s "[[Put a Little Love in Your Heart]]"

The '''National College for DUI Defense''' (NCDD) is a professional, [[non-profit]] corporation dedicated to the improvement of the criminal defense bar, and to the dissemination of information to the public about [[drunk driving]] law and related issues.  With almost 1000 attorney members nationwide, the organization consists of a [[Dean (education)|dean]], a governing [[board of regents]], a founding membership, a sustaining membership and a general membership, and is headquartered in Montgomery, Alabama.  Additionally, there is a State Delegate selected for each state.

==History and purpose==
The [[College]] was founded in 1994 in Chicago by 12 DUI defense attorneys, who formed the original Board of Regents.  Subsequently each served as dean of the college for one year prior to automatically retiring from the board as a [[fellow]] of the National College. As the original board retired, new Regents were brought in to serve.  

The college's [[mission statement]] states that "In sum, the mission of the College is to vindicate the promise of the United States Constitution, that a citizen accused has the right to the ''effective'' assistance of his or her counsel". As part of this mission, the College presents [[seminars]] to the profession on a regular basis.  These include a 3-day summer session conducted annually at the [[Harvard Law School]] since 1995; a 3-day fall seminar in Las Vegas, Nevada, in conjunction with the [[National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers]]; a spring Mastering Scientific Evidence seminar in New Orleans, and a 2-day winter seminar at changing locations. 

==Accreditation==
In 1999, the college instituted board certification to recognize lawyers within the college who exemplify the program's standards, and who meet the criteria established by the board: extensive experience trying DUI cases and litigating pre-trial issues, a broad knowledge of the science involved in testing for intoxicants, and a command of the legal process on which DUI cases are framed.  In 2003, the [[American Bar Association]] recognized DUI Defense Law as a specialty area in the practice of law, and awarded its "Certificate of [[Professional certification|Accreditation]]" to the board [[certification]] program. In 2008 the American Bar Association re-accredited the National College's specialty certification program in DUI Defense Law.  The NCDD is currently the only organization in the country accredited to certify lawyers as DUI Defense Law specialists.

The '''{{lang|de|Rock am Ring}}''' ([[German language|German]] for "Rock at the Ring") and '''{{lang|de|Rock im Park}}''' ("Rock in the Park") festivals are two simultaneous [[rock music]] festivals held annually. While ''Rock am Ring'' takes place at the [[Nürburgring]] race track, ''Rock im Park'' takes place at the [[Zeppelinfeld]] in [[Nuremberg]].

Both festivals are usually regarded as one event with a mostly identical lineup for both festivals. All artists perform one day at [[Nürburgring]] and another day in Nuremberg during the three-day event. There have been minor exceptions in the past years where an artist would be announced for one of the festivals only. Combined, Rock im Park and Rock am Ring are the largest music festivals held in Germany and one of the largest in the world with a combined attendance of over 150,000 people in 2007, selling out both events in advance for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Joel (17 November 2014).

==History==
[[File:13-06-07 RaR Cro 01.jpg|thumb|Center Stage 2013, the German rapper [[Cro (rapper)|Cro]] performing]]
[[File:Festivalgelände - Rock am RIng 2017-AL1779.jpg|thumb|Festival site Rock am Ring 2017]]
[[File:Festivalgelände - Rock am Ring 2017-AL3764.jpg|thumb|Festival site Rock am Ring 2017]]
[[File:Festivalgelände - Rock am Ring 2017-AL3849.jpg|thumb|Festival site Rock am Ring 2017]]
Rock am Ring was originally planned as a one-time festival on the [[Nürburgring]] celebrating the inauguration of a newer, shorter version of the race track in 1985, but due to its commercial success (with 75,000 audience members), it was decided to make the concert an annual event. However, after a dip in attendance for the 1988 event, the festival was put on hiatus for two years. In 1991, the festival returned with a new concept: as well as featuring well-known artists, event organizers present lesser known up-and-coming bands to the public. In 1993, Rock im Park took place for the first time in [[Vienna]]. For the 1994 event, Rock im Park moved to the disused [[Munich-Riem airport]], and the following year to Munich's [[Olympic Stadium (Munich)|Olympiastadion]], where it found a home for the 1995 and 1996 event. 1997 Rock im Park moved to Nuremberg's [[Frankenstadion]] where it was held until the venue was unavailable in 2004 because the stadium was being renovated for the [[2006 Football World Cup]]. Since 2004 the venue moved again to the current Zeppellinfeld, where Rock im Park was since held with the exception of the 2006 festival, which was moved to the Luitpoldhain.

The 2007 festival was used in a science experiment to test the effects of large bodies of people simultaneously jumping. The experiment data was used to calculate the result if the entire Chinese population were to jump in unison. The experiment concluded no significant results would come from the theoretical event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Rock Festival as Human Experiment (dead link as of 2011-11-25) | work=blog.sciam.com | url=http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=rock_festival_as_human_experiment_hip_ho&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1&amp;ref=rss | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713222937/http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=rock_festival_as_human_experiment_hip_ho&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1&amp;ref=rss | archivedate=2007-07-13 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2016 festival==
The festival was cancelled during the second day due to severe thunderstorms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article155967447/Festival-Rock-am-Ring-wird-endgueltig-abgebrochen.html | title= Festival "Rock am Ring" wird endgültig abgebrochen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2017 festival==
In 2017 the festival returned to the [[Nürburgring]].
Headliners: [[Rammstein]], [[Die Toten Hosen]] and [[System of a Down]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rock-am-ring.com/history/2017|title=History - Rock am Ring 2017|website=Rock am Ring}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 2 June 2017, the first day of the festival, the sold out event with about 85,000 visitors was interrupted at 9:00 pm during a performance by the [[Düsseldorf]] band [[Broilers (band)|Broilers]] and the festival grounds cleared. The reason given was a terrorist situation. Other scheduled performances for Friday evening, including those of the headliner [[Rammstein]] and the rapper [[Marteria]], were cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/festival-in-der-eifel-musikfestival-rock-am-ring-vorlaeufig-unterbrochen-1.3533703 ''Musikfestival „Rock am Ring“ vorläufig unterbrochen.''], ''Sueddeutsche.de''. 2 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Three men were arrested and checked in [[Hesse]] that same evening. Two of the men assigned to the [[Salafist]] scene in Hesse had access rights in the form of bracelets, which gave them direct access to many festival areas. One of the men was also suspected of having links to the terrorist scene. However, on the morning of 3 June, after a search of the grounds and a raid of the suspect's homes, the police announced that the suspicion of a threatening attack had not been substantiated, so that the festival could continue on Saturday noon. The access rights to the festival site had been received by the two main suspects due to a short-term staffing request from an external security service provider.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/gesellschaft/kriminalitaet/verkehrskontrolle-fuehrte-zu-rock-am-ring-abbruch-15048628.html ''Verkehrskontrolle führte zu „Rock am Ring“-Abbruch.''], ''faz.net'', 6 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Hintergründe zum Terroralarm bei Rock am Ring|periodical=Spiegel Online|publisher=|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/rock-am-ring-warum-es-einen-terror-alarm-gab-die-rekonstruktion-a-1150997.html|deadurl=|accessdate=2017-06-07|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Jörg Diehl|date=2017-06-07|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10831">'''Sahar Gul''' (born c.1998) is an [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] teenager who was subjected to torture and abuse by her husband's family in the town of [[Puli Khumri]] when she was illegally married as a [[Child marriage|child bride]]. Her case became notable in Afghanistan and internationally when she was rescued in late 2011.&lt;ref name=GuardJan12&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/02/afghan-girl-escaped-torturers-sent-back|title=Afghan child bride had escaped torturers but was sent back|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2 January 2012|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' said that the case of Gul "horrified Afghanistan and prompted a bout of national soul-searching".&lt;ref name=GuardJul13/&gt; Three of her in-laws were found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to 10 years in prison, but later freed after an appeals court voided their convictions.&lt;ref name=NYJul13/&gt; American Attorney Kimberley Motley represented Gul in Supreme Court upon hearing of the in-laws release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-23311414|title=Sahar Gul: The fears of a tortured Afghan child bride|date=2013-07-15|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-03-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gul became the first victim of a crime that was represented by an Attorney for a criminal proceeding.  In a landmark decision the Supreme Court, and after the case was decided twice by the Appellate Court, Gul's in-laws, brother and husband who were never originally tried were convicted and sentenced to five years in prison.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Motley|first=Kimberley|title=How I defend the rule of law|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/kimberley_motley_how_i_defend_the_rule_of_law|language=en|accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The court also agreed that Gul could sue all parties for civil compensation.   Gul is recovering in a [[women's shelter]] and says that she had ambitions to become a politician and stop other women suffering as she did.&lt;ref name=NYJan12/&gt;

==Early life==
Gul grew up in [[Badakhshan]], a mountainous province in Northern Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=NYJan12&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/world/asia/wed-and-tortured-at-13-afghan-girl-finds-rare-justice.html|title=Wed and Tortured at 13, Afghan Girl Finds Rare Justice|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=11 August 2012|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of her father she was moved around relatives and eventually lived with her stepbrother when she was aged about 9.&lt;ref name=NYJan12/&gt; Gul would tend cows and sheep and work in an orchard of walnut and apricot trees, and also made dung bricks for fuel. Her presence in her stepbrother's house was apparently resented by his wife, who pressured him to give Gul up for marriage even though she had not reached the legal marriage age of 16. Her stepbrother's wife had been contacted by a 30-year-old man, Ghulam Sakhi, who illegally paid at least $5,000 for her.&lt;ref name=NYJan12/&gt; Gul was [[illiterate]] at the time of her marriage.&lt;ref name=GuardJul13/&gt;

==Marriage and abuse==
Sakhi took Gul to his parents' home in the northern province of Baghlan. Officials from the Afghan Ministry of Women’s Affairs claimed that Sakhi's family intended to force Gul into prostitution.&lt;ref name=GuardJul13/&gt; Sakhi’s first wife had left him after he and his mother had beaten her for not bearing him children.&lt;ref name=NYJan12/&gt; Gul resisted consummating her marriage for weeks.&lt;ref name=NYJan12/&gt;

Gul ran away to a neighbour's house, they alerted the police and Sakhi's family. Sakhi was forced by his neighbours and the police to sign a letter promising not to mistreat Gul in the future, and she was taken back by Sakhi.&lt;ref name=NYJan12/&gt; A neighbour later heard screams coming from the house, and the following morning Gul was described as having "...lost a lot of weight, her hands were covered with bruises and wounds, one of her hands was broken, but her mother-in-law was forcing her to do the laundry”. Sakhi's family later put her in the cellar.&lt;ref name=NYJan12/&gt; In the cellar, her hands and feet were tied with rope, she slept on the floor without a mattress, and was fed bread and water. She was beaten regularly, with most of the beatings coming from the elderly father of her husband.&lt;ref name=NYJan12/&gt; Her nails and clumps of her hair had been pulled out, and chunks of her flesh had been cut out with pliers.&lt;ref name=BBCDec11&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16356247|title=Afghan girl's 'horrifying abuse' exposed by video|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=29 December 2011|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was lying in hay and animal dung at the time of her discovery.&lt;ref name=GuardJul13/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYJan12/&gt;

His father was accused of hitting Gul with "sticks, biting her chest, inserting hot irons in her ears and vagina, and pulling out two fingernails".&lt;ref name=NYJan12/&gt; Gul’s uncle and stepbrother attempted unsuccessfully to visit her, and her stepbrother, Mohammed was warned by Sakhi's family over the legality of the marriage.&lt;ref name=NYJan12/&gt;

==Discovery==
In December 2011, six months after the marriage, Gul was discovered by her uncle and stepbrother and two police officers after they called at the house and heard a voice from the cellar. Police arrested three members of Sakhi's family; Gul's mother-in-law, Siyamoi, her daughter Mahkhurd and Amanullah, the father-in-law. Amanullah was found hiding in a [[burqa]] and a blanket.&lt;ref name=NYJan12/&gt;

Police were told by the family that Sakhi was in [[Helmand]], in the [[Afghan National Army]]. This was untrue, and the confusion caused by the false claim allowed him time to escape with his brother, Darmak.&lt;ref name=NYJan12/&gt; They remain at large.&lt;ref name=NYJan12/&gt; A special police unit was established to look for Sakhi.&lt;ref name=BBCJan12&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16388825|title=Afghan unit to hunt abused bride Sahar Gul's husband|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=3 January 2012|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[President of Afghanistan]], [[Hamid Karzai]], called for swift justice for Gul. In May 2012, the judge of a district court in Kabul declared Gul's three in-laws guilty, with the judgement broadcast on national television.&lt;ref name=GuardJul13/&gt; In court the in-laws justified their behaviour as a result of their paying good money for a girl who was not pretty, who misbehaved and who would neither work as they demanded nor bear them children.&lt;ref name=GuardJul13/&gt;

The in-laws' lawyers were provided by the legal group Da Qanoon Ghushtonky (Demanders of Law), a group financed by international aid. The lawyers argue that due process in Gul's case was negatively affected by the political outcry over her treatment.&lt;ref name=NYJan12/&gt; The lawyers for the in-laws said they denied beating or drugging Gul and confining her in the cellar, and claimed that Gul's wounds were self-inflicted. They also said they had no plans to send her into prostitution, a claim not addressed in the court.&lt;ref name=GuardJul13/&gt;

==Conviction and appeal==
Three people, Gul's mother-in-law, father-in-law, and sister-in-law were subsequently convicted for her attempted murder, and sentenced to 10 years in prison in July 2012.&lt;ref name=GuardJul13&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/afghan-judges-free-sahar-guls-torturers|title=Afghan judges free three jailed for torture of child bride Sahar Gul|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=11 July 2013|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their convictions were later upheld on appeal.&lt;ref name=NYJul13&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/world/asia/afghan-court-reverses-conviction-in-torture-of-young-woman.html|title=Afghan Court Reverses Convictions in Torture of Girl|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=4 July 2013|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013 Gul's in-laws were released early and their convictions quashed due to a lack of evidence. Gul and her lawyer were not informed of the release of her in-laws and only found out of their release when they enquired after the date for their appeal.&lt;ref name=GuardJul13/&gt; Gul's lawyer, Motley said the release was "...based on the idea that there was no evidence, but the people who would have given evidence didn't know that the hearing was taking place".&lt;ref name=GuardJul13/&gt; The [[Afghan Supreme Court]] sent Gul's case back to an appeals court, the supreme court said that the violence suffered by Gul appeared to warrant convictions for assault, not attempted murder.&lt;ref name=NYJul13/&gt; Their decision was shared by the appeals court who voided the convictions and ordered that the three in-laws be freed.&lt;ref name=NYJul13/&gt;  In a landmark decision the Supreme Court heard the case after the Appellate Court heard the case twice and ruled that Gul's in-laws, brother and husband who were never originally tried were convicted and sentenced to five years in prison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The court also agreed that Gul could sue all parties for civil compensation.

The government prosecutor was not present, and the only person in court was the defence lawyer for the accused, even though both are required to be informed under Afghan law.&lt;ref name=GuardJul13/&gt; The defendants were released from prison two days later, a process that usually takes up to a month. The process would have involved government prosecutors twice declining to appeal the release of Gul's in-laws, with the involvement of at least three judges and a prosecutor.&lt;ref name=GuardJul13/&gt;

An [[internet cafe]] for women was opened in the Afghan capital [[Kabul]] on [[international Women's Day]] in 2012, and named for Gul.&lt;ref name=BBCMar12&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/language/wordsinthenews/2012/03/120312_witn_women_cafe.shtml|title=Kabul's first women-only internet cafe|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=12 March 2012|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gul lives in a shelter near [[Kabul]] run by [[Women for Afghan Women]].&lt;ref name=NYJul13/&gt; The organisation was founded in 2001 and has seven shelters across Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=NYJan12/&gt;

[[Image:Sandugo Reenactment.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Sandugo Reenactment]]
The '''Sandugo Festival''' is an annual historical celebration that takes place every year in [[Tagbilaran City]] on the island of [[Bohol]] in the [[Philippines]]. This festival commemorates the Treaty of Friendship between [[Datu Sikatuna]], a chieftain in Bohol, and [[Spain|Spanish]] conquistador [[Miguel López de Legazpi]]. This 16th-century peace treaty occurred on March 16, 1565 through a [[blood compact]] or "[[sandugo]]".&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.bohol.gov.ph/history.html History of Bohol] www.bohol.gov.ph  Retrieved 16 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fest"&gt;[http://www.philippinecountry.com/philippine_festivals/sandugo_festival.html Sandugo Festival Bohol] www.philippinecountry.com Retrieved 16 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sandugo Festival is held every July. The Tagbilaran City Charter Day on July 1 kicks-off the month-long festival with a holy mass, diana, motorcade and program sponsored by the City Government of Tagbilaran. Among the major activities during the month is the [[Miss Bohol Sandugo Beauty Pageant]], and the Sandugo Street Dancing Competition which is usually held on the 3rd or 4th Sunday of July, and organized by the Bohol Sandugo Foundation, Inc. (BSFI).

==The Sandugo Street Dancing==

[[Image:Sandugo Streetdancing.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Sandugo Street Dancing]]
In 2010, the Street Dancing Competition will be held on July 25. The competition is usually participated in by schools, the city and municipal governments, boholano organizations abroad, and even contingents from other provinces. The competition starts at noon at the City Pier, passes through the city's major streets, and culminates at the Pres. Carlos P. Garcia Sports Complex where a Sandugo Re-enactment is held. The final judging of the competition will be held at the Complex where the participants will again perform for the audience. The winners receive thousands of pesos in prizes.

Aside from the activities organized by the city and provincial governments and by the BSFI, are other activities sponsored by various private sectors like nightly shows and trade/food fair at the City Pier, product showcase, concerts, medical and surgical missions, and others.

==The Bohol Sandugo Foundation, Inc.==

Due to the inadequate support coming from both government and private sectors coupled with the dwindling public interest in the yearly celebration of the Sandugo Festival, the Bohol Sandugo Foundation, Inc. (BSFI) was organized in 1991. Since then, the BSFI has ably spearheaded the celebration of the Sandugo and has made significant efforts in reviving a nationwide interest in the event which has now become a magnetic byword in the tourism industry.&lt;ref name="bsfi"&gt;[http://sandugo.tagbilaran.gov.ph/2009/bsfi.php Bohol Sandugo Foundation, Inc.] sandugo.tagbilaran.gov.ph Retrieved 12 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tigum Bol-anon Sa Tibuok Kalibutan==

Every two years, the "Tigum Bol-anon Sa Tibuok Kalibutan" (English: A Gathering of Boholanos Around the World) or TBTK is held in unison with the Sandugo Festival. This gathering is organized by the [http://www.conbusac.net Confederation of Boholanos in the US and Canada] or CONBUSAC, which aims to gather Boholanos from all over for a celebration of unity. Among the activities conducted by the TBTK is the Search for Mrs. Bohol International and Miss Bohol International, CONBUSAC Convention, Awarding of Outstanding Boholanos, medical and surgical missions (in cooperation with the BSFI), and others.

'''Sarah Tilghman Hughes''' (August 2, 1896 – April 23, 1985) was an American [[lawyer]] and [[United States federal judge|federal judge]] who served on the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas]]. She is best known as the judge who swore in [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] as [[President of the United States]] on [[Air Force One]] after the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy assassination]] on November 22, 1963. {{As of|2018}}, she is the only woman in United States history to have sworn in a President, a task usually administered by the [[Chief Justice of the United States]]. The photo depicting Hughes [[First inauguration of Lyndon B. Johnson|administering the oath of office to Johnson]] is widely viewed as the most famous photo ever taken aboard Air Force One.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The flying White House: the story of Air Force One|first=Jerald F.|last=terHorst|first2=Col.

==Education and career==

Born '''Sarah Augusta Tilghman''' in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], she was the daughter of James Cooke and Elizabeth (Haughton) Tilghman. She went to high school at [[Western High School (Baltimore)|Western Female High School]] (now [[Western High School (Baltimore)|Western High School]]) in Baltimore, where she was elected president of the freshman class. Standing only five feet one-half inch at maturity, she was described by a classmate as "small but terrible".&lt;ref name=collection&gt;[http://findingaids.library.unt.edu/index.php?p=collections/controlcard&amp;id=51 Judge Sarah T. Hughes Collection — University of North Texas Libraries]&lt;/ref&gt; Her determined personality extended to the athletic field where she participated in intramural track and field, gymnastics, and basketball. Another instance of Hughes's strong personal discipline was seen in her habit of going to bed by 8 pm and getting up at 4 am, a habit she continued through much of her life. After graduating from Western High School, she attended [[Goucher College]], an all women's college in central Baltimore very close to her home. She participated in athletics at Goucher College, and 'learned to lose without bitterness, to get up and try again, to never feel resentment,' a trait that would serve her well through many years of political victories and defeats. She graduated with an [[Bachelor of Arts|Artium Baccalaureus]] degree in 1917.

After graduation from college, Hughes taught science at [[Salem Academy]] in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], [[North Carolina]] for several years. She then returned to school to the study of law. In 1919 she moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] and attended [[The George Washington University Law School]]. She attended classes at night and during the day worked as a [[police officer]]. As a police officer, Hughes did not carry a gun or wear a police uniform because she worked to prevent crimes among women and girls, patrolling areas where female runaways and prostitutes were normally found. Her job was an expression of the progressive idea of rehabilitation instead of punishment. Hughes later credited this job with instilling in her a sense of commitment and responsibility to women and children. At that time she lived in a tent home near the [[Potomac River]] and commuted to the campus by canoe each evening.&lt;ref name=collection /&gt; She graduated with a [[Bachelor of Laws]] in 1922.

She moved to [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] in 1922 with her husband, George Ernest Hughes, whom she had met in law school. Her husband quickly found employment after law school, but Sarah faced significant obstacles as a woman during a time in which law firms generally did not regard women as qualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&amp;context=facpub|title=Women in the Legal Profession from the 1920s to the 1970s|last=Bowman|first=Cynthia Grant|date=2009|website=|publisher=Cornell Law Faculty Publications|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the small firm of Priest, Herndon, and Ledbetter gave her a rent-free space and even referred some cases to her in exchange for her services as a receptionist. As her practice grew and became more successful, she became increasingly active in local women's organizations. She joined the [[Zonta Club]], the Business and Professional Women's Club, the Dallas Women's Political League, the [[League of Women Voters]], [[YWCA USA|YWCA]], Dallas College Club, and the [[American Association of University Women]]. Hughes served as Chair of the AAUW Committee on the Economic and Legal Status of Women, advocating equal pay jury service for women, and improved status and recognition for women in the Armed Services. She practiced law for eight years in Dallas before becoming involved in [[politics]], first being elected in 1930 to three terms in the [[Texas House of Representatives]] as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/mobile/memberDisplay.cfm?memberID=1893 Texas Legislators Past and Present-Sarah Hughes]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, Hughes accepted an appointment as a state judge from Governor [[James Allred]] for the Fourteenth District Court in Dallas, becoming the state's first female district judge. In 1936 she was elected to the same post. She was re-elected six more times and remained in that post until 1960.

==Federal judicial service==

Hughes received a [[recess appointment]] from President [[John F. Kennedy]] on October 5, 1961, to the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas]], to a new seat authorized by 75 Stat. 80. She was nominated to the same position by President Kennedy on January 15, 1962. She was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on March 16, 1962, and received her commission on March 17, 1962. She was the only female judge appointed by President Kennedy, the first female federal judge in Texas and the third female to serve in the federal judiciary. She assumed [[senior status]] on August 4, 1975. Her service terminated on April 23, 1985, due to her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aals.org/profdev/women/clark.pdf|title=Carter's Groundbreaking Appointment of Women to the Federal Bench: His Other "Human Rights" Record|publisher=AALS|pages=1–2|last=Clark|first=Mary|year=2002|accessdate=January 17, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013041145/http://www.aals.org/profdev/women/clark.pdf|archivedate=October 13, 2007|df=}} "Today, women comprise 26.3% of the judgeships on state courts of last resort, 19.2% of federal district court judgeships, 20.1% of federal appellate judgeships, and 33.3% of the U.S. Supreme Court." [[Women in the United States judiciary]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circumstances of the appointment===

The appointment almost did not happen, according to historian [[Robert Caro]], because the Kennedy administration thought Hughes was "too old" and they were seeking younger [[jurist]]s for the [[Life tenure|lifetime tenure]] afforded under [[Article III#Tenure|Article III for federal judgeships]]. Hughes had been a "longtime [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] ally," and as [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], Johnson had asked [[Robert F. Kennedy]], the [[Attorney General of the United States]] and brother of President John F. Kennedy, "to nominate Mrs. Hughes" for the Federal bench, but the [[United States Justice Department]] turned him down. Johnson then offered the job to another attorney. However, Hughes was also an ally of the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]], [[Sam Rayburn]], who held up a bill important to RFK until Hughes' appointment was announced.&lt;ref name=Caro187&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Caro|title=The Years of Lyndon Johnson: The Passage of Power|pages=187–188|chapter="Genuine Warmth"|place=New York City |publisher=Albert A. Knopf|year=2012|isbn=978-0-679-40507-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson was outraged at the chain of events because it appeared to be an intentional attempt to insult him, and made him look like the "biggest liar and fool in the history of the State of Texas".  President Kennedy's White House appointments secretary called it a "terrible mistake", citing negligence on the part of Kennedy's staff. The story of how Hughes received her appointment made the rounds of Washington, D.C. insiders, including the political gossip columnists [[Evans and Novak]], which hurt Johnson's reputation for political effectiveness.&lt;ref name=Caro187 /&gt;  Historian Steven Gillon agrees with Caro's story, although it was not cross-cited.&lt;ref name=Gillon&gt;{{cite book |title=The Kennedy Assassination - 24 Hours Later| first=Steven |last=Gillon |publisher=Basic Books|place=New York City |year=2009 |chapter="I Do Solemly Swear}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women on juries==

Hughes was concerned over the ineligibility of women in Texas to serve on juries even though they had the right to vote. She and [[Helen Edmunds Moore]] coauthored a proposed amendment that would allow women on juries in Texas, but the bill failed and went nowhere. Despite defeat, Hughes became closely identified with this cause and few people were recognized as working harder for this right. Due in to part to Hughes's work, Texas women secured the right to serve on juries in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenintexashistory.org/bios/|work=womenintexashistory.com|title=Biographies: Women in Texas History|year=2007|accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Foundation for Women's Resources|place=Dallas, Texas|title=From Gutsy Mavericks to Quiet Heroes: True Tales of Texas Women|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administering the oath of office==
{{main|First inauguration of Lyndon B. Johnson}}
[[File:LBJ Swearing-in.jpg|thumb|250px|Judge Hughes swears-in Lyndon B. Johnson as President of the United States as Mrs. Kennedy and Lady Bird Johnson look on. Photo by [[Cecil W. Stoughton]].]]
Two years into her tenure as a federal district judge, on November 22, 1963, Hughes was called upon to administer the oath of office to Lyndon B. Johnson after the [[assassination of President Kennedy]]. According to an interview with [[Barefoot Sanders]], who was United States Attorney for the Northern District of Texas at the time:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abota.org/_images/mediacenter/vd_2002_fall_Barefoot%20Sanders(1).pdf vd_2002_fall_Barefoot%20Sanders(1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|LBJ called [[Irving Goldberg]] from the plane and asked, 'Who can swear me in?' Goldberg called me, and I said, 'Well, we know a federal judge can.' Then I got a call from the President's plane, with the command 'Find Sarah Hughes.' Coincidentally, Judge Hughes, Jan [Sanders' wife] and I [Sanders] were supposed to go to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] that night for a dinner for President Kennedy. I reached her at home and said, 'They need you to swear in the Vice President at [[Dallas Love Field|Love Field]]. Please get out there.' 

She said, 'Is there an oath?'

I said, 'Yes, but we haven't found it yet.'

She said, 'Don't worry about it; I'll make one up.' 

She was very resourceful, you know. By the time she got to the airplane, someone had already called it into the plane. We quickly realized that it is in the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] [Art. II, Sec. 1, cl. 8].}}

Hughes believed that President Johnson chose her to administer the oath of office due to their friendship,{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} and because Johnson was not pleased with other federal judges in Dallas.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Because of this, Hughes was the most suitable choice. Sanders and Hughes no doubt believed those rationales, but Johnson had other reasons to choose her, according to Caro: "He knew who he wanted - and she was in Dallas." Citing another historian, Max Holland,&lt;ref name=Holland&gt;{{cite book|first=Max|last=Holland|title=The Kennedy Assassination Tapes|page=24|year=2004|publisher=Knopf|place=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caro noted that the circumstances surrounding Hughes's appointment meant that she "'personified Johnson's utter powerlessness'" when he was vice president. The new President ordered his staff, "'Get Sarah Hughes ... Find her.'" Hughes was found and driven to Love Field, while [[Air Force One]]—and thus the inauguration of the new President—was held up just for her. Caro asserts that Johnson, in his insecurities, chose Hughes to show to the world that he was now powerful.&lt;ref name=Caro328&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Caro|title=The Years of Lyndon Johnson: The Passage of Power|pages=328–329|publisher=Albert A. Knopf|chapter="Taking Charge"|place=New York City |year=2012|isbn=978-0-679-40507-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other historians (Holland and Gillen) agree with Caro's assessment that Johnson was still upset that he'd not been consulted on Hughes's appointment in the first place, so it was a way to placate his weak ego.&lt;ref name=Gillon /&gt;&lt;ref name=Holland /&gt; On the other hand, Johnson needed to make sure that "the swearing in take place at the earliest possible moment ... to demonstrate, quickly, continuity and stability to the nation and the world...."  Johnson used the "few minutes to spare" while waiting for Hughes to arrive to plead to Kennedy's staffers to stay awhile for the transition. Finally, she arrived, along with the media and [[Jackie Kennedy]]; only then the swearing in could take place. Hughes noted that Jackie's "eyes 'were cast down'" when Johnson nodded to the judge to start the oath of office.&lt;ref name=Caro333&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Caro|title=The Years of Lyndon Johnson: The Passage of Power|pages=333–336|publisher=Albert A. Knopf|year=2012|isbn=978-0-679-40507-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other significant contributions==

Throughout her lifetime, Sarah Hughes was known for her speedy and impartial administration. In 1950, she assisted in establishing Dallas's first juvenile detention center.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Hughes was involved in multiple court decisions, including ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', ''Shultz v. Brookhaven General Hospital'', and ''Taylor v. Sterrett''. Hughes was a member of the three-judge panel that first heard the case of ''Roe v. Wade''; the panel's decision was subsequently affirmed by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. In ''Taylor v. Sterrett'', she argued to upgrade prisoner treatment in the [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] jail. Hughes noted that "the Dallas County Jail was very much in need of change. It was in deplorable condition, and [she] think[s], that under [her] jurisdiction, it became one of the best jails in the whole United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/1977/july/inside-the-dallas-county-jail/|title=INSIDE THE DALLAS COUNTY JAIL|website=D Magazine|language=en|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years and death==

Hughes retired from the active federal bench in 1975, though she continued to work as a judge with [[senior status]] until 1982. A close friend of Lyndon Johnson and his family, Hughes participated in his inauguration in 1965, took part in the book signing of [[Lady Bird Johnson]]'s White House memoirs, and participated in the dedication of the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum]]. The dress Hughes wore during the swearing in on Air Force One was donated to a wax museum in Grand Prairie, Texas, but it was destroyed in a fire in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Irreplaceable items lost in museum fire |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/13994937/ |newspaper=The Seguin Gazette-Enterprise |location=Seguin, Texas |agency=AP |page=3 |date=September 11, 1988 |access-date=October 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, Hughes suffered a debilitating stroke which confined her to a nursing home in Dallas. She died three years later on April 25, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-04-25/news/mn-12178_1_fateful-flight|title=Fateful Flight From Dallas :  Sarah T.

'''''Tesla – Lightning in His Hand''''' is a large-scale opera about Serbian American engineer and inventor [[Nikola Tesla]] (1856 - 1943), composed by [[Constantine Koukias]] a Tasmanian composer and opera director of Greek ancestry based in Amsterdam, where he is known by his Greek name of Konstantin Koukias, with libretto by Marianne Fisher.

==Plot==

The opera depicts Tesla's life as a series of reversals of fortunes. The two-hour work, sung in English, is in two parts and features a bass, a tenor, a bass-baritone, two sopranos, seven musicians (including a [[theremin]] player) and a large male choir. Also audible are clattering typewriters, pigeons (in later life Tesla was deeply affected by the death of a specific white pigeon), Morse code and fragments of [[Antonín Dvořák]]'s [[New World Symphony]]. It also included two [[Tesla coil]] as props at its premiere.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Susanne 2003, "Lightning conductor: IHOS' Tesla", [http://www.realtimearts.net/article/53/7005 RealTime Magazine], February–March 2003&lt;/ref&gt; A warning was issued in the program to audience members who might be wearing "pace-makers, hearing aides, or any form of electric, magnetic, mechanical or metallic implant or prosthetic device".

==Production==

The full opera was produced in 2003 by [[IHOS Music Theatre and Opera]]. It was originally commissioned by the [[West Australian Opera]] and developed over three years through two staged "works in development". Creator and original Artistic Director of Tasmania's [[10 Days on the Island]] Festival, [[Robyn Archer]], commissioned the full opera to open the festival in 2003. The work, sponsored by the John Holland Group, was staged in a massive shed on Hobart's docks, where the Tesla coils put on a "spectacular display of electron sparks".&lt;ref&gt;Tesla Memorial Society of New York circa 2003, [http://www.teslasociety.com/ntopera.htm "Nikola Tesla Opera"]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Reception==
Reviewing the production for the Melbourne ''Age'', David Lander described it as "gorgeous image-based performance art with a fascinating, brittle score in which dilemmas are ignored in favour of sensuality".&lt;ref&gt;Lader, David 2003, "Evocation of Eccentricity", ''The Age'', 2 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tesla'' was featured on [[ABC Classic FM]]'s ''New Music Australia'' program&lt;ref&gt;New Music Australia 2003, [http://www.abc.net.au/classic/nma/stories/s919467.htm "Tesla - Lightning in His Hand"], ABC Classic FM, 13 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and has been cited as far afield as Croatia, where it was noted in a tourist board tribute to the scientist&lt;ref&gt;The Croatia National Tourist Board n.d., [http://www.htz.hr/English/Tesla/Pocasti.aspx "The Mediterranean As It Once Was: Honours".]&lt;/ref&gt; and Croatian Post's web page detailing a stamp to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the inventor's birth.&lt;ref&gt;Croatian Post Inc. 2006, [http://www.posta.hr/main.aspx?id=193&amp;idmarke=1212 150th Anniversary of the Birth of Nikola Tesla] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025223155/http://www.posta.hr/main.aspx?id=193&amp;idmarke=1212 |date=2010-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They include Clarke Peters, Maria Broom, Corey Parker Robinson, Reg E. Cathey, [[Clayton LeBouef]], [[Donnell Rawlings]], [[Tootsie Duvall]], [[Robert F. Chew]], [[Lance Reddick]] and [[Delaney Williams]]. Alexander and Peters later starred in Simon's ''[[Treme (TV series)|Treme]]''. Many of the actors had also appeared on ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', which was adapted from Simon's book.

== Reception ==
A review by Hugh K. David of ''DVD Times'' praised ''The Corner'' as "raw, gritty, uncompromising, realistic, smartly directed, supremely well-acted, compulsively watchable, but harrowing and with little light at the end of the tunnel", comparing it to the television equivalent of such films as ''[[Last Exit to Brooklyn (film)|Last Exit to Brooklyn]]'' or ''[[Requiem for a Dream]]'' (also adapted from novels), with elements in common with both ''[[La Haine]]'' and ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://homecinema.thedigitalfix.co.uk/content.php?contentid=57882 |title= Review of The Corner |agency= Home Cinema |publisher= The Digital Fix |author= David, Hugh K. |date= July 23, 2005 |accessdate= September 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutton]]); Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries or a Movie ([[David Simon]] and [[David Mills (TV writer)|David Mills)]] and Outstanding Miniseries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/corner|title=The Corner|publisher=Emmys.com|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also won a [[Peabody Award]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/the-corner |title=The Corner |publisher=The Peabody Awards |date=May 2001 |accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Gary Coleman Show''''' is a 30-minute [[Saturday-morning cartoon|Saturday morning animated series]] produced by [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]] that originally aired on [[NBC]] during the 1982–1983 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hayward|first=Anthony|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/gary-coleman-child-star-of-the-television-sitcom-diffrent-strokes-who-faced-legal-and-personal-problems-in-later-life-1987910.html|title=Gary Coleman: Child star of the television sitcom 'Diff'rent Strokes' who faced legal and personal problems in later life - Obituaries - News|publisher=The Independent|date=2010-06-01 |accessdate=2012-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured the voices of [[Gary Coleman]], Lauren Anders, [[Jennifer Darling]], [[Julie McWhirter|Julie McWhirter Dees]], Geoffrey Gordon, LaShana Dendy, [[Jerry Houser]], Calvin Mason, [[Sidney Miller (actor)|Sidney Miller]] and [[Steve Schatzberg]].

==Synopsis==
The series featured [[Gary Coleman]] as the voice of Andy LeBeau, an apprentice [[angel]], who was dispatched back to Earth to earn his wings by helping others. The character of Andy LeBeau was a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] character from Coleman's made-for-TV movie ''[[The Kid with the Broken Halo]]'' (1982). In each episode, Andy was dispatched to help a child in need and resolve his problem. The antagonist in each episode was Hornswoggle, who tried to make Andy's mission more difficult, usually by getting him to make the wrong choice or by otherwise complicating the mission. It was up to Andy to correct whatever mistakes he made and foil Hornswoggle's plans.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''The Pattern of Painful Adventures'' (radio play)}}
'''''The Pattern of Painful Adventures''''' is a 90-minute 2008 radio play by [[Stephen Wakelam]] on the circumstances surrounding the writing of the play ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] and the sickness of his brother Edmund's child, introduced by a flashback by his daughter Susannah, playwright John Marston and William's secretary Robinson. It links the play to the marriage of Susannah and the birth of her daughter and to the similar themes of daughters, forests, storms, shipwrecks and lost infants from ''[[As You Like It]]'', ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'', and ''[[The Tempest]]''. It is named after ''[[The Pattern of Painful Adventures]]'', a main source for ''Pericles''. It was first broadcast on [[BBC Radio 3]] at 8pm on 23 November 2008, directed and produced by [[Jeremy Mortimer]], and was followed in the same slot on 30 November by a repeat of a 2005 radio production of ''Pericles'', with [[Tom Mannion]] as Pericles and [[Benjamin Zephaniah]] as Gower.

'''''Tilden Rent-A-Car Co. v. Clendenning''''' (1978), 83 DLR (3d) 400 is a leading [[Canadian contract law]] decision from the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] on [[standard form contract]]s. The Court held that a party can only be bound to a signed standard form contract when it is reasonable to believe that they consented to the terms.&lt;ref name="onca-1446"&gt;{{cite CanLII|year=1978|court=onca|num=1446|format=canlii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Clendenning rented a car from [[Tilden Rent-a-Car|Tilden Rent-A-Car]], a Canadian car rental company. He signed the rental agreement which contained an [[exclusion clause]] denying coverage for accidents that occur if the driver had consumed any alcohol. Later, Clendenning hit a pole after having consumed alcohol. He pleaded guilty to impaired driving and tried to collect from the insurance policy to pay for the damages of his accident.

==Opinion of the Court==
Justice [[Charles Dubin]], for the court, held that Clendenning could collect from the insurance. Dubin observed that:&lt;blockquote&gt;
In modern commercial practice, many standard form printed documents are signed without being read or understood. In many cases the parties seeking to rely upon the terms of the contract know or ought to know that the signature of a party to the contract does not represent the true intention of the signer, and that the party signing is unaware of the stringent and onerous provisions which the standard form contains. Under such circumstances, I am of the opinion that the party seeking to rely on such terms should not be able to do so in the absence of first having taken reasonable measures to draw such terms to the attention of the other party, and, in the absence of such reasonable measures, it is not necessary for the party denying knowledge of such terms to prove either fraud, misrepresentation or [[non est factum]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 408-09&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Normally, a customer would have time to consider the whole agreement. But in this particular situation, renters are typically in a rush and do not normally have a chance to read the terms of the agreement. The judge observed that the rental system is designed to be speedy and, therefore, lengthy and onerous terms cannot assumed to be assented to.

The '''wedding of [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark]], and [[Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark|Mary Donaldson]]''' took place on 14 May 2004 in the [[Copenhagen Cathedral]].

== Courtship and engagement ==
[[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark]], and [[Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark|Mary Donaldson]] met on 16 September 2000, during the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in [[Sydney]].;&lt;ref name="theage"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Age]] |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/11/04/1036308258205.html |title=Sydney lass plays lady in waiting |date=5 November 2002 |accessdate=11 July 2012 |first=Jacquelin |last=Magnay}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frederik identified himself as the [[Crown Prince of Denmark]] at the height of their courtship.&lt;ref name="hello1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/profiles/crown-princess-mary-of-denmark/ |title=Latest news and profile of Crown Princess Mary of Denmark |work=[[Hello (magazine)|Hello]] |accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship was kept low-profile, although some Danish media reported the two were dating. On 24 September 2003, it was announced that Frederik's mother, [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]], intended to give her consent to the marriage at the [[Danish Council of State|State Council]] meeting scheduled for 8 October 2003.

Frederik and Mary became officially engaged on 8 October 2003. Frederik presented Mary with an engagement ring featuring an [[emerald cut]] [[diamond (gemstone)|diamond]] and two emerald cut [[ruby]] [[baguette cut|baguettes]].&lt;ref name="hello2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://royalweddings.hellomagazine.com/prince-william-and-kate-middleton/galeria/20100922403/kate-middleton/prince-william/rings/1/5/#ancla |title=Crown jewels: The fabulous rings which sealed the love of Europe's royal couples |work=[[Hello (magazine)|Hello]] |accessdate=12 July 2012 |date=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the wedding, Mary, who had previously been a dual citizen of [[Australia]] and the [[United Kingdom]], was granted Danish citizenship. She also converted from [[Presbyterianism]] to the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Church of Denmark]]. The media portrayed Frederik's and Mary's relationship as a modern "fairytale" romance between a prince and a commoner.&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/05/14/1084289893038.html |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |title=So, this princess walks into a bar... |date=15 May 2004 |accessdate=12 July 2012 |first=Anthony |last=Dennis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wedding ceremony ==
The wedding ceremony of Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark, and Mary Donaldson was held on 14 May 2004 in the [[Copenhagen Cathedral]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]],&lt;ref name="drh"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://kongehuset.dk/english/The-Royal-House/Crown-Prince-Couple |title=The Crown Prince Couple |accessdate=11 July 2012 |work=[[Danish Royal Family]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the wedding festivities at the [[Fredensborg Palace]].&lt;ref name="drh2"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Danish Royal Family]] |accessdate=11 July 2012 |title=HRH Crown Princess Mary |url=http://kongehuset.dk/english/The-Royal-House/Crown-Prince-Couple/HRH-Crown-Princess-Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary's sisters Jane Stephens and Patricia Bailey, and her friend Amber Petty served as [[bridesmaids]], while Frederik's brother [[Prince Joachim of Denmark]] was the best man. Mary's nieces Erin and Kate Stephens and Madisson Woods were flower girls, and Frederik's nephew [[Prince Nikolai of Denmark]] and first cousin once removed [[Princess Alexandra of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg|Count Richard von Pfeil und Klein-Ellguth]] were pageboys.

Mary wore a wedding dress created by Danish fashion designer Uffe Frank with a veil first used by [[Princess Margaret of Connaught|Crown Princess Margareta of Sweden]], and then by her daughter [[Ingrid of Sweden|Ingrid, Queen of Denmark]]. The veil, made from [[Irish lace]], was later worn by Ingrid's daughters [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe]], [[Princess Benedikte of Denmark|Benedikte]] and [[Queen Anne-Marie of Greece|Anne-Marie]]. Mary's wedding tiara was a gift from Queen Margrethe and [[Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark|Prince Henrik]].&lt;ref name="hello3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2004/07/30/marydonaldsongown/ |date=30 July 2004 |accessdate=12 July 2012 |title=Tradition and modernity in Mary's bridal ensemble |work=[[Hello (magazine)|Hello]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Titles upon marriage ==
Upon her marriage, Mary embraced the title of her husband and became the [[Her Royal Highness]] [[Crown Prince of Denmark|Crown Princess of Denmark]]. Should Frederik eventually ascend to the Danish throne, as expected, Mary would automatically become the [[Queen consort]] of Denmark. She was also honoured with the [[Order of the Elephant]], and her father [[John Dalgleish Donaldson|John Donaldson]] with the grand cross of the [[Order of the Dannebrog]]. In accordance with the statutes of the [[Danish Royal Family|Danish Royal Orders]], both of them were granted a personal [[coat of arms]].&lt;ref name="heraldryaustralia"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldryaustralia.org/news_and_events.htm#denmark |title=New arms for Crown Prince Mary of Denmark |work=Australian Heraldry Society |accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 April 2008, Frederik and Mary were also created the Count and the Countess of Monpezat, which is a title that Frederik inherited from his father [[Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark]].&lt;ref name="b"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.b.dk/danmark/monpezat-til-frederik-og-joachim |title=Monpezat til Frederik og Joachim |language=Danish |date=30 April 2008 |accessdate=12 July 2012 |work=[[Berlingske Tidende]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WISE Books===
WISE Books are aimed at supporting innovative thinking in education. As of October 2014, WISE has published three books addressing educational topics. WISE Book authors and photographers travel to several countries in an attempt to identify the challenges and illustrate the impact of initiatives and practices that are making tangible differences. The third book to be released by WISE, ''Learning (Re)Imagined - How the connected society is transforming learning'' focuses on the link between technology and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepeninsulaqatar.com/news/qatar/302719/wise-releases-third-book-on-education|title=WISE releases third book on education|publisher=The Peninsula|date=6 October 2014|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
