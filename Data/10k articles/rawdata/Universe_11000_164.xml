      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20819">'''Aether theories''' (also known as '''ether theories''') in [[physics]] propose the existence of a medium, the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]] (also spelled ''ether'', from the Greek word ({{lang|grc|αἰθήρ}}), meaning "upper air" or "pure, fresh air"&lt;ref name=aetherDict&gt;"''[http://www.bartleby.com/61/85/A0118500.html Aether] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051203022126/http://www.bartleby.com/61/85/A0118500.html |date=December 3, 2005 }}''", American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language.&lt;/ref&gt;), a space-filling substance or field, thought to be necessary as a [[transmission medium]] for the propagation of electromagnetic or gravitational forces. The assorted ''aether theories'' embody the various conceptions of this "''[[Medium (optics)|medium]]''" and "''[[Substance theory|substance]]''". This [[early modern]] aether has little in common with the [[Aether (classical element)|aether of classical elements]] from which the name was borrowed. Since the development of [[special relativity]], theories using a substantial aether fell out of use in [[modern physics]], and were replaced by more abstract models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== Historical models ==

===Luminiferous aether===
{{main|Luminiferous aether|History of special relativity}}

[[Isaac Newton]] suggests the existence of an aether in the Third Book of ''[[Opticks]]'' (1718): "Doth not this aethereal medium in passing out of water, glass, crystal, and other compact and dense bodies in empty spaces, grow denser and denser by degrees, and by that means refract the rays of light not in a point, but by bending them gradually in curve lines? ...Is not this medium much rarer within the dense bodies of the Sun, stars, planets and comets, than in the empty celestial space between them? And in passing from them to great distances, doth it not grow denser and denser perpetually, and thereby cause the gravity of those great bodies towards one another, and of their parts towards the bodies; every body endeavouring to go from the denser parts of the medium towards the rarer?"&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton The Third Book of Opticks (1718) http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/NATP00051&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, luminiferous aether (or ether), meaning light-bearing aether, was a theorized medium for the propagation of light (electromagnetic radiation). However, a series of increasingly complex experiments had been carried out in the late 1800s like the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] in an attempt to detect the motion of Earth through the aether, and had failed to do so. A range of proposed [[Aether drag hypothesis|aether-dragging theories]] could explain the null result but these were more complex, and tended to use arbitrary-looking coefficients and physical assumptions. [[Joseph Larmor]] discussed the aether in terms of a moving magnetic field caused by the acceleration of electrons.

[[James Clerk Maxwell]] said of the aether, "In several parts of this treatise an attempt has been made to explain electromagnetic phenomena by means of mechanical action transmitted from one body to another by means of a medium occupying the space between them. The undulatory theory of light also assumes the existence of a medium. We have now to show that the properties of the electromagnetic medium are identical with those of the luminiferous medium."&lt;ref&gt;James Clerk Maxwell: "[[s: A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism/Part IV/Chapter XX|A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism/Part IV/Chapter XX]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[George Francis FitzGerald]] offered within the framework of [[Lorentz ether theory]] a more elegant solution to how the motion of an absolute aether could be undetectable (length contraction), but if their equations were correct, [[Albert Einstein]]'s 1905 [[special theory of relativity]] could generate the same mathematics without referring to an aether at all. This led most physicists to conclude that this early modern notion of a luminiferous aether was not a useful concept. Einstein however stated that this consideration was too radical and too anticipatory and that his theory of relativity still needed the presence of a medium with certain properties.
&lt;!--Note that  A. Einstein claimed afterwards that “the special theory of relativity does not compel us to deny ether.”  and  “According to the general theory of relativity space without ether is unthinkable.”&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, A. "Ether and the Theory of Relativity".  http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Einstein_ether.html )&lt;/ref&gt; The first step of the new approach&lt;ref&gt;Foigel, AG. (2005). "An interpretation of relativistic mechanics". ''Annalen de la Fondation Louis de Broglie '''''30''': 289-307&lt;/ref&gt; relies on the results concerning the independence of the unidirectional light speed on the velocity of the light source. These results were obtained by W. de Sitter while observing binary stars.&lt;ref&gt;De Sitter, W. (1913). "A proof of the constancy of the velocity of light". ''Proceedings of the Royal  Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences''''' 15'''II, 1297-1298.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

=== Mechanical gravitational aether ===
{{main|Mechanical explanations of gravitation}}
From the 16th until the late 19th century, gravitational phenomena had also been modelled utilizing an aether. The most well-known formulation is [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation]], although other models were proposed by [[Isaac Newton]], [[Bernhard Riemann]], and [[Lord Kelvin]]. None of those concepts are considered to be viable by the scientific community today.

== Non-standard interpretations in modern physics ==

=== General relativity ===
{{main|Einstein's views on the aether}}

Einstein sometimes used the word ''aether'' for the gravitational field within [[general relativity]], but this terminology never gained widespread support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Kostro, L.|chapter=An outline of the history of Einstein's relativistic ether concept|title=Studies in the history of general relativity |editor=Jean Eisenstaedt |editor2=Anne J. Kox|volume=3|pages=260–280|isbn=978-0-8176-3479-7|publisher=Birkhäuser|location=Boston-Basel-Berlin|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|We may say that according to the general theory of relativity space is endowed with physical qualities; in this sense, therefore, there exists an aether. According to the general theory of relativity space without aether is unthinkable; for in such space there not only would be no propagation of light, but also no possibility of existence for standards of space and time (measuring-rods and clocks), nor therefore any space-time intervals in the physical sense. But this aether may not be thought of as endowed with the quality characteristic of ponderable media, as consisting of parts which may be tracked through time. The idea of motion may not be applied to it.&lt;ref name=einstb&gt;Einstein, Albert: "[[s:Ether and the Theory of Relativity|Ether and the Theory of Relativity]]" (1920), republished in ''Sidelights on Relativity'' (Methuen, London, 1922)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Quantum vacuum ===
[[Quantum mechanics]] can be used to describe [[spacetime]] as being non-empty at extremely small scales, fluctuating and generating [[pair production|particle pairs]] that appear and disappear incredibly quickly. It has been suggested by some such as [[Paul Dirac]]&lt;ref name="Dirac, Paul 1951 p. 906"&gt;Dirac, Paul: "Is there an Aether?", Nature 168 (1951), p. 906.&lt;/ref&gt; that this [[quantum vacuum]] may be the equivalent in modern physics of a particulate aether. However, Dirac's aether hypothesis was motivated by his dissatisfaction with [[quantum electrodynamics]], and it never gained support from the mainstream scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[Robert B. Laughlin]], Nobel Laureate in Physics, endowed chair in physics, Stanford University, had this to say about ether in contemporary theoretical physics:

{{quote|It is ironic that Einstein's most creative work, the general theory of relativity, should boil down to conceptualizing space as a medium when his original premise [in special relativity] was that no such medium existed [..] The word 'ether' has extremely negative connotations in theoretical physics because of its past association with opposition to relativity. This is unfortunate because, stripped of these connotations, it rather nicely captures the way most physicists actually think about the vacuum.  . . . Relativity actually says nothing about the existence or nonexistence of matter pervading the universe, only that any such matter must have relativistic symmetry. [..] It turns out that such matter exists. About the time relativity was becoming accepted, studies of radioactivity began showing that the empty vacuum of space had spectroscopic structure similar to that of ordinary quantum solids and fluids. Subsequent studies with large particle accelerators have now led us to understand that space is more like a piece of window glass than ideal Newtonian emptiness. It is filled with 'stuff' that is normally transparent but can be made visible by hitting it sufficiently hard to knock out a part. The modern concept of the vacuum of space, confirmed every day by experiment, is a relativistic ether. But we do not call it this because it is taboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laughlin|first=Robert B.|title=A Different Universe: Reinventing Physics from the Bottom Down|date=2005|publisher=Basic Books|location=NY, NY|isbn=978-0-465-03828-2|pages=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Pilot waves ===
{{Main|Pilot wave|De Broglie–Bohm theory}}

[[Louis de Broglie]] stated, "Any particle, ever isolated, has to be imagined as in continuous "energetic contact" with a hidden medium."&lt;ref name=deBroglieHiddenMedium&gt;[http://aflb.ensmp.fr/AFLB-classiques/aflb124p001.pdf Annales de la Fondation Louis de Broglie, Volume 12, no.4, 1987]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode = 1983FoPh...13..253P |doi=10.1007/BF01889484 |quote=It is shown that one can deduce the de Broglie waves as real collective Markov processes on the top of Dirac's aether|title=Dirac's aether in relativistic quantum mechanics |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=253 |last1=Petroni |first1=Nicola Cufaro |last2=Vigier |first2=Jean Pierre |year=1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conjectures and proposals ==

According to the philosophical point of view of Einstein, Dirac, Bell, Polyakov, ’t Hooft, Laughlin, de Broglie, Maxwell, Newton and other theorists, there might be a medium with physical properties filling 'empty' space, an aether, enabling the observed physical processes.

[[Albert Einstein]] in 1894 or 1895: "The velocity of a wave is proportional to the square root of the elastic forces which cause [its] propagation, and inversely proportional to the mass of the aether moved by these forces."&lt;ref&gt;Albert Einstein's 'First' Paper (1894 or 1895), http://www.straco.ch/papers/Einstein%20First%20Paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert Einstein in 1920: "We may say that according to the general theory of relativity space is endowed with physical qualities; in this sense, therefore, there exists an Aether. According to the general theory of relativity space without Aether is unthinkable; for in such space there not only would be no propagation of light, but also no possibility of existence for standards of space and time (measuring-rods and clocks), nor therefore any space-time intervals in the physical sense. But this Aether may not be thought of as endowed with the quality characteristic of  ponderable media, as consisting of parts which may be tracked through time. The idea of motion may not be applied to it."&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert: "[[s: Ether and the Theory of Relativity|Ether and the Theory of Relativity]]" (1920), republished in ''Sidelights on Relativity'' (Methuen, London, 1922)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Dirac]] wrote in 1951:&lt;ref name="Dirac, Paul 1951 p. 906"/&gt; "Physical knowledge has advanced much since 1905, notably by the arrival of quantum mechanics, and the situation [about the scientific plausibility of Aether] has again changed. If one examines the question in the light of present-day knowledge, one finds that the Aether is no longer ruled out by relativity, and good reasons can now be advanced for postulating an Aether ... We have now the velocity at all points of space-time, playing a fundamental part in electrodynamics. It is natural to regard it as the velocity of some real physical thing. Thus with the new theory of electrodynamics [vacuum filled with virtual particles] we are rather forced to have an Aether".

[[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] in 1986, interviewed by [[Paul Davies]] in "The Ghost in the Atom" has suggested that an Aether theory might help resolve the [[EPR paradox]] by allowing a [[frame of reference|reference frame]] in which signals go faster than light. He suggests [[Lorentz contraction]] is perfectly coherent, not inconsistent with relativity, and could produce an aether theory perfectly consistent with the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]]. Bell suggests the aether was wrongly rejected on purely philosophical grounds: "what is unobservable does not exist" [p.&amp;nbsp;49]. Einstein found the non-aether theory simpler and more elegant, but Bell suggests that doesn't rule it out. Besides the arguments based on his interpretation of quantum mechanics, Bell also suggests resurrecting the aether because it is a useful pedagogical device. That is, many problems are solved more easily by imagining the existence of an aether.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Einstein remarked "God does not play dice with the Universe". And those agreeing with him are looking for a classical, deterministic aether theory that would imply quantum-mechanical predictions as a statistical approximation, a [[hidden variable theory]]. In particular, [[Gerard 't Hooft]]&lt;ref&gt;R. Brunetti and A. Zeilinger (Eds.), ''Quantum (Un)speakables'', Springer, Berlin (2002), Ch. 22&lt;/ref&gt; conjectured that: "We should not forget that quantum mechanics does not really describe what kind of dynamical phenomena are actually going on, but rather gives us probabilistic results. To me, it seems extremely plausible that any reasonable theory for the dynamics at the Planck scale would lead to processes that are so complicated to describe, that one should expect apparently stochastic fluctuations in any approximation theory describing the effects of all of this at much larger scales. It seems quite reasonable first to try a classical, deterministic theory for the Planck domain. One might speculate then that what we call quantum mechanics today, may be nothing else than an ingenious technique to handle this dynamics statistically." In their paper Blasone, Jizba and Kleinert "have attempted to substantiate the recent proposal of G. ’t Hooft in which quantum theory is viewed as not a complete field theory, but is in fact an emergent phenomenon arising from a deeper level of dynamics. The underlying dynamics are taken to be classical mechanics with singular Lagrangians supplied with an appropriate information loss condition. With plausible assumptions about the actual nature of the constraint dynamics, quantum theory is shown to emerge when the classical Dirac-Bergmann algorithm for constrained dynamics is applied to the classical path integral [...]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = quant-ph/0409021|bibcode = 2005PhRvA..71e2507B|title = Path-integral approach to 't Hooft's derivation of quantum physics from classical physics|journal = Physical Review A|volume = 71|issue = 5|pages = 052507|last1 = Blasone|first1 = Massimo|last2 = Jizba|first2 = Petr|last3 = Kleinert|first3 = Hagen|year = 2005|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.71.052507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis de Broglie]], "If a hidden sub-quantum medium is assumed, knowledge of its nature would seem desirable. It certainly is of quite complex character. It could not serve as a universal reference medium, as this would be contrary to relativity theory."&lt;ref name=deBroglieHiddenMedium /&gt;

In 1982, [[Ioan-Iovitz Popescu]], a [[Romania]]n physicist, wrote that the aether is "a form of existence of the matter, but it differs qualitatively from the common (atomic and molecular) substance or radiation (photons)". The ''fluid aether'' is "governed by the principle of inertia and its presence produces a modification of the space-time geometry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duursma|first1=Egbert (Ed.)|title=Etherons as predicted by Ioan-Iovitz Popescu in 1982|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=978-1511906371|date=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Built upon [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|Le Sage's]] ''ultra-mundane corpuscles'', Popescu's theory posits a finite Universe "filled with some particles of exceedingly small mass, traveling chaotically at speed of light" and material bodies "made up of such particles called ''etherons''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Climont|first1=Jean|title=The Worldwide List of Alternative Theories and Critics.

Sid Deutsch, a professor of electrical engineering and bioengineerig, conjectures that a "spherical, spinning" ''aether particle'' must exist in order "to carry electromagnetic waves" and derives its diameter and mass using the [[density]] of [[dark matter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deutsch|first1=Sid|title=Einstein's Greatest Mistake: Abandonment of the Aether|date=2006|chapter=Chapter 9: An Aether Particle (AP)|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-37481-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Degenerate matter|degenerate]] [[Fermi liquid theory|Fermi fluid]] model, "composed primarily of ''electrons and positrons''" that has the consequence of a speed of light decreasing "with time on the scale of the age of the universe" was proposed by Allen Rothwarf.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/89ff/2b625440f3a4177060ebd76dcd1e3971bd94.pdf Rothwarf, A., “An Aether Model of the Universe”, 	Physics Essays, vol. 11, issue 3, p. 444 (1998)], Semantic Scholar.&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Physical cosmology|cosmological extension]] the [[Theory#Philosophical views|model]] was "extended to predict a ''decelerating expansion of the universe''".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.arxiv.org/ftp/astro-ph/papers/0703/0703280.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aluminium dross2.png|Aluminium dross|right|thumb]]

'''Aluminium dross''', a byproduct of the [[aluminium smelting]] process, can be mechanically recycled to separate the residual [[aluminium]] metal from the [[aluminium oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imp.mtu.edu/jmmce/issue5-1/P47-62.pdf |title=Institute of Materials Processing (IMP) &amp;#124; Materials Science &amp; Engineering |publisher=Imp.mtu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.azom.com/news.aspx?newsID=30991 |title=Taha Opens Dross Recycling Facility in New Zealand |publisher=Azom.com |date=2011-10-26 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thermo-mechanical metal extraction==
The mechanical process of [[recycling]] does not use any toxic chemicals previously used in the process of extracting the valuable aluminium in the dross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waste-management-world.com/index/display/article-display.articles.waste-management-world.recycling.2011.10b.Aluminium_Dross_Recycled_into_Fertilizer_in_New_Zealand.QP129867.dcmp=rss.page=1.html |title=New Aluminium Dross Recycling Facility in New Zealand |publisher=Waste Management World |date=2011-10-27 |accessdate=2014-06-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530115618/http://www.waste-management-world.com/index/display/article-display.articles.waste-management-world.recycling.2011.10b.Aluminium_Dross_Recycled_into_Fertilizer_in_New_Zealand.QP129867.dcmp=rss.page=1.html |archive-date=2012-05-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hot dross processing]] system whereby the majority of metal is recovered without chemically reducing the aluminium oxides. The [[dross]] is first crushed then separated into aluminium metal rich particles and aluminium oxide rich particles based on density. The metal rich particles are then melted in a furnace to remove the remaining oxide particles.

==Mechanical extraction vs chemical==
Recycling aluminium dross mechanically is an environmentally sensitive method, and is not toxic. This is completely different from how aluminium metal used to be extracted from dross using an array of hazardous chemicals which resulted in a concentrated highly toxic '[[salt cake]]' residue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dross Processing |publisher=Archive.is |date=2006-09-26 |accessdate=2014-06-09 |url=http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/pdf/10.1201/9781420006247.ch13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products that can be made with the residual==
A variety of products can be made from the residual aluminium dross after it is recycled into aluminium oxide. See more information on aluminium oxide.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[[Aluminium oxide]]&lt;/ref&gt; Aluminium oxide has a variety of industrial uses which includes being used in [[paint]], [[dye]], [[concrete]], [[explosives]], and [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aluminumsulfate.net/Aluminum-Oxide.html |title=Aluminum Oxide |publisher=Aluminumsulfate.net |date= |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;cf [[Thermite]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dross recycling is different==
Aluminium dross recycling is a completely different process to strictly [[aluminium recycling]]. Aluminium recycling is where pure aluminium metal products (previously used in another form) are re-melted into aluminium [[ingot]]s and then re-used to new aluminium products.&lt;ref&gt;cf [[Aluminium recycling]]&lt;/ref&gt; While aluminium dross recycling is where the dross, a byproduct of the smelting process in the creation of aluminium from [[bauxite]], can be mechanically recycled thus separating the residual aluminium metal from the aluminium oxide.&lt;ref&gt;http://nzic.org.nz/ChemProcesses/metals/8D.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Anaerobic Digestion and Bioresources Association''' (ADBA), formerly the Anaerobic Digestion and Biogas Association, is a [[United Kingdom]]-based trade association for the [[anaerobic digestion]] and associated industries.

ADBA was founded in September 2009 by its then chairman [[Rupert Mitford, 6th Baron Redesdale|Lord Redesdale]] and 10 founder member companies to represent businesses involved in the anaerobic digestion and biogas industries. Its objective is to help remove the barriers to anaerobic digestion that are faced and to support its members to grow their businesses. Its principal aim is to enable and facilitate the development of a mature anaerobic digestion industry in the UK within 10 years.

Recognising there was no industry group that exclusively represented the emerging anaerobic digestion industry in the UK (previously the [[Renewable Energy Association]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.r-e-a.net/biofuels/biogas|title=Biogas Energy|work=Renewable Energy Association|accessdate=21 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929174623/http://www.r-e-a.net/biofuels/biogas|archivedate=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Composting Association|Association for Organics Recycling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.organics-recycling.org.uk/|title= Association for Organics Recycling Website|accessdate=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; had break out groups related to anaerobic digestion) ADBA was formed by a number of UK-based companies which specialise in anaerobic digestion technologies including [[Clarke Energy]], Entec,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entecuk.com/news05_126_f.html|title=Entec Welcomes ADBA Launch|accessdate=21 March 2011}}{{dead link|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirk Environmental&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirk-environmental.com/news_article/adba_launch |title=ADBA Official UK Launch |accessdate=21 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907002536/http://www.kirk-environmental.com/news_article/adba_launch |archivedate=7 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Monsal.

During its relatively short time in existence, ADBA has made a number of significant contributions to the development of legislation including promoting higher levels of [[Feed-in Tariff|feed-in tariffs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.anaerobic-digestion.com/anaerobic-digestion/feed-in-tariff-rates-for-small-biogas|title=FiT rates fail to support anaerobic digestion, claims ADBA|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for digestion plants and a biomethane carbon credit trading platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/sectors/energy-and-environment/news/adba-proposes-creation-of-carbon-credit-trading-platform/1007675.article|title=ADBA proposes creation of carbon-credit trading platform|work=The Engineer|accessdate=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It now represents over 370 member companies.

On 1 October 2014, the ADBA announced that it was changing its name with immediate effect to the Anaerobic Digestion &amp; Bioresources Association, "in response to a rapidly changing political and economic landscape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adbioresources.org/news/from-biogas-to-bioresources-why-adba-has-widened-its-remit-1 |title=From Biogas to Bioresources, why ADBA has widened its remit |work=adbioresources.org |accessdate=2014-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biodegradable waste''' includes any [[organic matter]] in  [[type of waste|waste]] which can be broken down into carbon dioxide, water, methane or simple organic molecules by micro-organisms and other living things by [[compost]]ing, [[aerobic digestion]], [[anaerobic digestion]] or similar processes. In waste management, it also includes some inorganic materials which can be decomposed by bacteria. Such materials include [[gypsum]] and its products such as [[plasterboard]] and other simple organic [[sulfate]]s which can decompose to yield [[hydrogen sulphide]] in anaerobic land-fill conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why can't I put my leftover gyproc/drywall in the garbage? |publisher=Recycling Council of British Columbia|url=https://www.rcbc.ca/resources/faqs/hazard9}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Fact Sheet: Methane and Hydrogen Sulfide Gases at C&amp;DD Landfills|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency. State of Ohio, U.S.|url= http://epa.ohio.gov/portals/34/document/guidance/gd_669.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In domestic waste collection, the scope of biodegradable waste may be narrowed to include only those degradable wastes capable of being handled in the local waste handling facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccc.govt.nz/services/rubbish-and-recycling/sorting/organics-green-bin/|publisher=Christchurch City Council|title=Organics -Green Bin|access-date=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
Biodegradable waste can be found in [[municipal solid waste]] (sometimes called biodegradable municipal waste, or BMW) as [[green waste]], [[food waste]], [[paper]] waste, and [[biodegradable plastics]]. Other [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]] wastes include [[human waste]], [[manure]], [[sewage]], [[sewage sludge]] and [[slaughterhouse waste]]. In the absence of [[oxygen]], much of this waste will decay to [[methane]] by [[anaerobic digestion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cslondon.org/downloads/2010_Waste_Review.pdf CSL London Olympics Waste Review]. cslondon.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In many parts of the developed world, biodegradable waste is separated from the rest of the waste stream, either by separate kerb-side collection or by waste sorting after collection. At the point of collection such waste is often referred to as ''green waste''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccc.govt.nz/services/rubbish-and-recycling/sorting/organics-green-bin/|title=Organics - Green Bin|publisher= Christchurch City Council|access-date=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removing such waste from the rest of the waste stream substantially reduces waste volumes for disposal and also allows biodegradable waste to be [[compost]]ed.

==Uses of biodegradable waste==
Biodegradable waste can be used for composting or a resource for heat, electricity and fuel by means of [[incineration]] or [[anaerobic digestion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-opportunities-for-converting-indigenous-uk-wastes-to-fuels-and-energy-report-nnfcc-09-012 NNFCC report on Evaluation of Opportunities for Converting Indigenous UK Wastes to Fuels and Energy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720181907/http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-opportunities-for-converting-indigenous-uk-wastes-to-fuels-and-energy-report-nnfcc-09-012 |date=2011-07-20 }}. nnfcc.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Swiss ''Kompogas'' and the Danish ''AIKAN'' process are examples of anaerobic digestion of biodegradable waste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kompogas-utzenstorf.ch/pdf/kreislauf.pdf Recycling chain]. kompogas-utzenstorf.ch&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aikantechnology.com/ AIKAN website]. aikantechnology.com&lt;/ref&gt; While incineration can recover the most energy, anaerobic digestion plants retain nutrients and make compost for soil amendment and still recover some of the contained energy in the form of [[biogas]]. Kompogas produced 27 million [[Kwh]] of electricity and biogas in 2009. The oldest of the company's lorries has achieved 1,000,000 kilometers driven with biogas from household waste in the last 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zuonline.ch/storys/storys.cfm?vID=1585|title=Gesundheit, Kraft und Energie für 2002|date=3 January 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020902075207/http://www.zuonline.ch/storys/storys.cfm?vID=1585|work=zuonline.ch|archivedate=2 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas relying on organic waste==

Featured in an edition of ''[[The Economist]]'' that predicted events in 2014, it was revealed that [[Massachusetts]] creates roughly 1.4 million tons of organic waste every year&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/news/2013/11/18/waste-not-want-not&lt;/ref&gt;. Massachusetts, along with [[Connecticut]] and [[Vermont]], are also going to enact laws to divert food waste from landfills.

In small and densely populated states, landfill capacity is limited so disposal costs are higher ($60–90 per ton in MA compared to national average of $49&lt;ref&gt;https://nrra.net/sweep/cost-to-landfill-waste-continues-to-rise-through-2016/&lt;/ref&gt;). Decomposing food waste generates methane, a notorious [[greenhouse gas]]. However, this biogas can be captured and turned into energy through anaerobic digestion, and then sold into the electricity grid.

Anaerobic digestion grew in Europe, but is starting to develop in America. Massachusetts is increasing its production of anaerobic digesters.


==Climate change impacts==

The main environmental threat from biodegradable waste is the production of [[methane]] and other [[greenhouse gas]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/compost/index.htm Biodegradable waste]. European Commission

The fuel cells have an operational life expectancy of around 10 years; based on predictions on fuel costs, the "break even" point for those who purchase the device is around 8 years.  Several other companies competing in the same energy market have demonstrated that their devices function with greater operational efficiency than the Bloom Server, and ''Forbes'' magazine has suggested that most of the Bloom Server's reputation is based on hype rather than actual efficient operation or savings in energy costs.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}  The cell's technology continues to rely on non-renewable sources of energy to produce electricity, and because it is not a [[hydrogen fuel cell]], it still produces [[carbon dioxide]] (an important  [[greenhouse gas]]) during operation.

Bloom stated in 2011 that two hundred servers had been deployed in California for corporations including eBay, Google, Yahoo, and Wal-Mart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Industry leading companies choose Bloom Electrons for immediate cost savings and carbon reduction benefits |publisher=Bloom Energy |date=20 January 2011 |url=http://www.bd.com/press/pdfs/Bloom_Electrons_Customer_Press_Release.pdf |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
The Bloom Energy Server uses thin white ceramic plates of size 100&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;100&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="Schmit"&gt;{{cite news |first=Julie |last=Schmit |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2010-02-24-fuel-cell_N.htm |title=Clean, cheap power from fuel cells in a box? |publisher=USA Today |date=24 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Each plate is coated with a [[Nickel(II) oxide|green nickel oxide]]-based ink  on one side, forming the anode, and another black (probably [[Lanthanum strontium manganite]]) ink on the cathode side.&lt;ref name="60min" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Singhalbook"&gt;{{cite book| page=[http://www.google.co.in/books?id=LjSBsqGdxvsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA10#v=&amp;q=lanthanum%20manganites%20%22higher%20dopant%22%20&amp;f=false 10]| author=Subhash C. Singhal, Kevin Kendall| title=High temperature solid oxide fuel cells: fundamentals, design, and applications| publisher=Elsevier| isbn=1-85617-387-9| year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Wired'' reported that the secret ingredient may be [[yttria-stabilized zirconia]] based upon {{ cite patent |country=US |number=|7572530 |status=patent}} that was granted to Bloom in 2009; this material is also one of the most common [[electrolyte]] materials in the field.&lt;ref name="zirconia"&gt;{{cite news| last=Kanellos| first=Michael| url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/02/is-bloom-energy%E2%80%99s-secret-ingredient-zirconia/| title=Bloom Box fuel cell launch| publisher=Wired| date=22 February 2010| accessdate=24 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{ cite patent |country=US |number=20080261099 |status=patent application}}, assigned to Bloom Energy Corporation, says that the "electrolyte includes yttria stabilized zirconia and a [[scandium|scandia]]-stabilized [[zirconia]], such as a scandia ceria stabilized zirconia".  
ScSZ has a higher conductivity than [[YSZ]] at lower temperatures, which provides greater efficiency and higher reliability when used as an electrolyte. Scandia is [[scandium oxide]] ({{chem|Sc|2|O|3}}) which is a [[transition metal]] [[oxide]] that costs between US$1,400 and US$2,000 per kilogram in 99.9% pure form.

"At this point, Bloom has excellent potential, but they have yet to demonstrate that they've met the bars of reliability."&lt;ref name="mercnews" /&gt;  [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] expert Michael Tucker claimed, "Because they operate at high temperatures, they can accept other fuels like natural gas and methane, and that's an enormous advantage... The disadvantage is that they can shatter as they are heating or cooling."&lt;ref name="mercnews" /&gt;

Venture capitalist John Doerr asserted that the Bloom Energy Server is cheaper and cleaner than the grid.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=E-mail This |url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/bloom-energy-claims-a-new-fuel-cell-technology/ |title=Bloom Energy Claims a New Fuel Cell Technology |work=DealBook Blog |publisher=New York Times |date=24 February 2010 |accessdate=24 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An expert at [[Gerson Lehrman Group]] wrote that, given today's electricity transmission losses of about 7% and utility-size gas-fired power stations efficiency of 33–48%, the Bloom Energy Server is up to twice as efficient as a gas-fired power station.&lt;ref name="GL Group" /&gt;  ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' stated that "Bloom has still not released numbers about how much the Bloom Box costs to operate per kilowatt hour" and estimates that natural gas rather than bio-gas will be its primary fuel source.&lt;ref name="Fortune followup"&gt;{{cite web

=== Efficiency ===
Bloom claims a conversion efficiency of around 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin LaMonica |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10461359-54.html |title=Parsing fact from fiction with the Bloom Energy box &amp;#124; Green Tech – CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A modern [[combined cycle]] gas turbine power plant (CCGT) can reach 60% overall efficiency, while [[cogeneration]] can achieve greater than 95% efficiency. Sridhar stated that Bloom's products convert chemical energy to electrical energy in one step, are more fuel efficient than current gas-fired power stations and reduce transmission/distribution losses by producing power where it is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=— 07 October 2009 |url=http://www.freshdialogues.com/2009/10/07/kr-sridhar-transcript-of-fresh-dialogues-interview-part-one/ |title=KR Sridhar: Transcript of Fresh Dialogues Interview Part One |publisher=Fresh Dialogues |date=2009-10-07 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Bloom Energy Server ES5700 is said to provide 200&amp;nbsp;kW of power, similar to the baseload needs of 160 average homes or one office building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bloomenergy.com/fuel-cell/energy-server/ |title=Energy Server – What is it? |publisher=Bloom Energy |accessdate=2014-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The average monthly electricity consumption for a U.S. residential utility customer in 2012 was 903&amp;nbsp;kWh per month (or 1.24&amp;nbsp;kW mean load).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=97&amp;t=3 |title=How much electricity does an American home use? – FAQ – U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) |publisher=Eia.gov |date=2014-01-10 |accessdate=2014-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sridhar said the boxes have a 10-year life span,&lt;ref name="Timesenergy" /&gt; although that could include replacing the cells during that period.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The CEO of eBay says Bloom Energy Servers have saved the company $100,000 in electricity bills since they were installed in mid-2009,&lt;ref name="60min"&gt;{{cite news

| accessdate=2010-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortune Magazine contributor Paul Keegan calls that figure "meaningless without the details to see how he got there".&lt;ref name="Fortune followup" /&gt;

The largest disadvantage is the high operating temperature which results in longer start-up times and mechanical and chemical compatibility issues.

=== Long-term business case ===
Assuming a 50% future cost reduction, one could argue that the best case scenario for the 200&amp;nbsp;kW unit would be a capital (installed) cost comparable to today's 100&amp;nbsp;kW units, i.e., around $800,000. Using average electricity ($0.10/kWh) and natural gas ($3/MMBtu) prices and assuming a 6% per year maintenance/operating cost apart from fuel, the break-even period for the device comes to over 8 years, based on published performance numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomenergy.com/fuel-cell/es-5700-data-sheet |title=Clean, Renewable Energy &amp;#124; Bloom Energy Solid Oxide Fuel Cells |publisher=Bloomenergy.com |date=2011-10-13 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long term cost consideration varies because backup generators are no longer necessary since the power grid acts as the emergency backup.  No longer having to maintain and replace generators would reduce the break even period.

A '''chemosterilant''' is a [[chemical compound]] that causes reproductive [[infertility|sterility]] in an organism.  They may be used to control [[Pest (animal)|pest]] populations by sterilizing [[male]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The toxicology of chemosterilants|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=31|pages=721–36|pmid=14278008|pmc=2555129|year=1964|author1=HAYES WJ Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt; More technically, a chemosterilant is any chemical compound used to control economically destructive or disease-causing pests (usually insects) by causing temporary or permanent sterility of one or both of the sexes or preventing maturation of the young to a sexually functional adult stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chemosterilants for Control of Insects and Insect Vectors of Disease|journal=Chimia International Journal for Chemistry|volume=70|issue=10|pages=715–720|doi=10.2533/chimia.2016.715|pmid=27779930|pmc=5108522|year=2016|last1=Baxter|first1=Richard H. G}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The mating of sterilized insects with fertile insects produces no offspring, and if the number of sterile insects is kept constant, the percentage of sterile insects will increase, and fewer young will be produced in each successive generation. Chemosterilants should be applied in the larval or pupal stage of the insect to give rise to sterile adults or in the newly emerged adults before they become sexually mature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/109047/chemosterilant chemosterilant]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two types of chemosterilants are commonly used:
*[[Antimetabolites]] resemble a substance that the cell or tissue needs that the organism's body mistakes them for a true [[metabolite]] and tries to incorporate them in its normal building processes. The fit of the chemical is not exactly right and the metabolic process comes to a halt.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13206">A '''compact linear Fresnel reflector''' ('''CLFR''') – also referred to as a '''concentrating linear Fresnel reflector''' – is a specific type of '''linear Fresnel reflector''' ('''LFR''') technology. Linear Fresnel reflectors use long, thin segments of mirrors to focus sunlight onto a fixed absorber located at a common focal point of the reflectors. These mirrors are capable of concentrating the sun's energy to approximately 30&amp;nbsp;times its normal [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]].&lt;ref name="Dey"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dey|first=C.J.|title=Heat transfer aspect of an elevated linear absorber|journal=Solar Energy|volume=76 |year=2004|pages=243–249|doi=10.1016/j.solener.2003.08.030|bibcode=2004SoEn...76..243D}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concentrated energy is transferred through the absorber into some thermal fluid (this is typically oil capable of maintaining liquid state at very high temperatures). The fluid then goes through a [[heat exchanger]] to power a [[Boiler (steam generator)|steam generator]]. As opposed to traditional LFR's, the CLFR utilizes multiple absorbers within the vicinity of the mirrors.

==History==

The first linear Fresnel reflector [[solar power]] system was developed in Italy in 1961 by Giovanni Francia of the [[University of Genoa]].&lt;ref name="Mills"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mills|first=D.R.|title=Advances in solar thermal electricity technology|journal=Solar Energy|volume=76 |year=2004|pages=19–31|doi=10.1016/S0038-092X(03)00102-6|bibcode=2004SoEn...76...19M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francia demonstrated that such a system could create elevated temperatures capable of making a fluid do work. The technology was further investigated by companies such as the [[FMC Corporation]] during the [[1973 oil crisis]], but remained relatively untouched until the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Dey"/&gt; In 1993, the first CLFR was developed at the [[University of Sydney]] in 1993 and patented in 1995. In 1999, the CLFR design was enhanced by the introduction of the advanced absorber.&lt;ref name="Mills"/&gt; In 2003 the concept was extended to [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] geometry.&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Schramek and David R. Mills, ''Multi-tower solar array'', Solar Energy 75, pp. 249-260, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Research published in 2010 showed that higher concentrations and / or higher [[Acceptance angle (solar concentrator)|acceptance angles]] could be obtained by using [[nonimaging optics]]&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"&gt;{{cite book | first = Julio | last = Chaves | title = Introduction to Nonimaging Optics, Second Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e11ECgAAQBAJ | publisher = [[CRC Press]] |  year = 2015 | isbn = 978-1482206739}}&lt;/ref&gt; to explore different degrees of freedom in the system such as varying the size and curvature of the [[heliostat]]s, placing them at a varying height (on a wave-shape curve) and combining the resulting primary with nonimaging secondaries.&lt;ref&gt;Julio Chaves and Manuel Collares-Pereira, ''Etendue-matched two-stage concentrators with multiple receivers'', Solar Energy 84, pp. 196-207, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

===Reflectors===

The reflectors are located at the base of the system and converge the sun's rays into the absorber. A key component that makes all LFR's more advantageous than traditional parabolic trough mirror systems is the use of "Fresnel reflectors". These reflectors make use of the [[Fresnel lens]] effect, which allows for a concentrating mirror with a large [[aperture]] and short [[focal length]] while simultaneously reducing the volume of material required for the reflector. This greatly reduces the system's cost since sagged-glass [[parabolic reflector]]s are typically very expensive.&lt;ref name="Mills"/&gt; However, in recent years thin-film [[nanotechnology]] has significantly reduced the cost of parabolic mirrors.&lt;ref name="energy"&gt;{{Cite web|author=[[United States Department of Energy]]|year=2009|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/solar/pdfs/46661.pdf|title=Solar Energy Technologies Program: Concentrating Solar Power|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major challenge that must be addressed in any solar concentrating technology is the changing angle of the incident rays (the rays of sunlight striking the mirrors) as the sun progresses throughout the day.  The reflectors of a CLFR are typically aligned in a north-south orientation and turn about a single axis using a computer controlled [[solar tracker]] system.&lt;ref name="Mills0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mills|first=D.R.|last2=Morrison|title=Compact linear Fresnel reflector solar thermal power plants|journal=Solar Energy|volume=68 |year=2000|pages=263–283|doi=10.1016/S0038-092X(99)00068-7|first2=Graham L.|issue=3|bibcode=2000SoEn...68..263M}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the system to maintain the proper [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] between the sun's rays and the mirrors, thereby optimizing energy transfer.

===Absorbers===

The absorber is located at the [[Focus (optics)|focal line]] of the mirrors. It runs parallel to and above the reflector segments to transport radiation into some working thermal fluid. The basic design of the absorber for the CLFR system is an inverted air cavity with a glass cover enclosing insulated steam tubes, shown in Fig.2.  This design has been demonstrated to be simple and cost effective with good optical and thermal performance.&lt;ref name="Dey"/&gt;

[[File:Compact Linear Fresnel Reflector Absorber.jpg|thumb|alt=Compact linear Fresnel reflector absorber transfers solar energy into working thermal fluid |Fig.2: Incident solar rays are concentrated on insulated steam tubes to heat working thermal fluid]]

[[File:CLFR Alternating Inclination.JPG|thumb|alt=CLFR solar systems use alternating inclination of mirrors to improve efficiency and reduce system cost|Fig.3: CLFR solar systems alternate the inclination of their mirrors to focus solar energy on multiple absorbers, improving system efficiency and reducing overall cost.]]

For optimum performance of the CLFR, several design factors of the absorber must be optimized.
* First, heat transfer between the absorber and the thermal fluid must be maximized.&lt;ref name="Dey"/&gt; This relies on the surface of the steam tubes being selective. A [[selective surface]] optimizes the ratio of energy absorbed to energy emitted. Acceptable surfaces generally absorb 96% of incident radiation while emitting only 7% through infra-red radiation.&lt;ref name="IES"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eisgroupltd.com/solmax_binder11.pdf|title=SolMax, Solar Selective Surface Foil|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electro-chemically deposited black chrome is generally used for its ample performance and ability to withstand high temperatures.&lt;ref name="Dey"/&gt;
* Second, the absorber must be designed so that the temperature distribution across the selective surface is uniform. Non-uniform temperature distribution leads to accelerated degradation of the surface. Typically, a uniform temperature of {{convert|300|°C|K °F}} is desired.&lt;ref name="Dey"/&gt; Uniform distributions are obtained by changing absorber parameters such as the thickness of insulation above the plate, the size of the aperture of the absorber and the shape and depth of the air cavity.

As opposed to the traditional LFR, the CLFR makes use of multiple absorbers within the vicinity of its mirrors. These additional absorbers allow the mirrors to alternate their inclination, as illustrated in Fig. 3. This arrangement is advantageous for several reasons.
* First, alternating inclinations minimize the effect of reflectors blocking adjacent reflectors' access to sunlight, thereby improving the system's efficiency.
* Second, multiple absorbers minimize the amount of ground space required for installation.  This in turn reduces cost to procure and prepare the land.&lt;ref name="Dey"/&gt;
* Finally, having the panels in close proximity reduces the length of absorber lines, which reduces both thermal losses through the absorber lines and overall cost for the system.

==Applications==
[[Areva Solar]] (Ausra) built a linear Fresnel reflector plant in New South Wales, Australia. Initially a 1 MW test in 2005, it was expanded to 5MW in 2006. This reflector plant supplemented the 2,000&amp;nbsp;MW coal-fired Liddell Power Station.&lt;ref name="Jahanshahi"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Jahanshahi|first=M.|date=August 2008|title=Liddell thermal power station – greening coal-fired power|periodical=Ecogeneration|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

AREVA Solar built the 5&amp;nbsp;MW [[Kimberlina Solar Thermal Energy Plant]] in Bakersfield, California in 2009.&lt;ref name="Ausra"/&gt; This is the first commercial linear Fresnel reflector plant in the United States. The solar collectors were produced at the Ausra factory in Las Vegas. In April 2008, AREVA opened a large factory in Las Vegas, Nevada to produce linear Fresnel reflectors.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Schlesinger|first=V.|date=July 2008|title=Solar Thermal Power Just Got Hotter|periodical=Plenty Magazine|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The factory was planned to be capable of producing enough solar collectors to provide 200&amp;nbsp;MW of power per month.&lt;ref name="Ausra"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ausra.com/technology/experience.html|title=Ausra Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, the German company [[Novatec Solar|Novatec]] Biosol constructed a Fresnel solar power plant known as PE&amp;nbsp;1. The solar thermal power plant uses a standard linear Fresnel optical design (not CLFR) and has an electrical capacity of 1.4&amp;nbsp;MW. PE&amp;nbsp;1 comprises a solar boiler with mirror surface of approximately {{convert|18000|m2|ha acre|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Novatec"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novatec-biosol.com/index.php?article_id=43&amp;clang=1|title=World First in Solar Power Plant Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steam is generated by concentrating sunlight directly onto a linear receiver, which is {{convert|7.40|m|ft|2}} above the ground.&lt;ref name="Novatec"/&gt; An absorber tube is positioned in the focal line of the mirror field where water is heated into {{convert|270|°C|K °F}} saturated steam. This steam in turn powers a generator.&lt;ref name="Novatec"/&gt; The commercial success of the PE&amp;nbsp;1 led [[Novatec Solar]] to design a 30&amp;nbsp;MW solar power plant known as PE&amp;nbsp;2. PE&amp;nbsp;2 has been in commercial operation since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puertoerrado2.com/home/|title=Home|date=27 October 2011|website=www.puertoerrado2.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2013 on [[Novatec Solar]] developed a molten salt system in cooperation with [[BASF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.basf.com/de/company/news-and-media/news-releases/2014/09/p-14-330.html|title=Novatec Solar und BASF nehmen solarthermische Demonstrations-anlage mit neuartiger Flüssigsalz-Technologie in Betrieb|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses molten salts as heat transfer fluid in the collector which is directly transferred to a thermal energy storage. A salt temperature of up to {{convert|550|°C|K °F}} facilitate to run a conventional steam turbine for [[Electricity generation]], [[Enhanced oil recovery]] or [[Desalination]]. A molten salt demonstration plant was realized on PE&amp;nbsp;1 to proof the technology.  Since 2015 FRENELL GmbH, a management buy-out of [[Novatec Solar]] took over the commercial development of the direct molten salt technology.

Solar Fire, an [[appropriate technology]] [[NGO]] in India, has developed an [[open source]] design for a small, manually operated, 12&amp;nbsp;kW peak Fresnel concentrator that generates temperatures up to {{convert|750|°C|K °F}} and can be used for various thermal applications including steam powered electricity generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-02-05/rajkot/28360071_1_solar-energy-steam-engine-energy-source |title='Solar fire' to quench energy thirst at grassroots |newspaper=Times of India|first=Vijaysinh |last=Parmar |date=Feb 5, 2011 |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solarfire.org/Solar-Fire-P32 |title=Solar Fire P32 - Solar Fire Project |work=solarfire.org |year=2011 |accessdate=May 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430021102/http://solarfire.org/Solar-Fire-P32 |archivedate=April 30, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital magnetofluidics''' is a method for moving, combining, splitting, and controlling  [[Drop (liquid)|drop]]s of [[water]] or biological fluids using [[magnetic field]]s.  This is accomplished by adding [[superparamagnetic]] particles to a drop placed on a [[superhydrophobic]] surface.  Normally this type of surface would exhibit a [[lotus effect]] and the drop of water would roll or slide off.  But by using magnetic fields, the drop is stabilized and its movements and structure can be controlled.

Drop movement is possible due to the influence of an applied magnetic field. The paramagnetic particles inside the water drops become magnetized. The consequent [[magnetic dipole]] interactions among the particles cause them to form chain-like clusters, which follow the magnetic field lines and aggregate further to form long filaments.  When the magnet is displaced, the clusters move and drive the motion of the drop.

Multiple drops can be moved simultaneously using different local magnetic fields.  By moving the fields together, drops can be combined.  This is useful as a method of adding a biological or chemical detection agent to the drop.

Drops may also be split through the action of separate magnetic fields.  First, two separate fields are brought together.  Then as the fields are moved apart, separate particle clusters are formed and push against the surface tension of the drop eventually ripping the drop into two separate drops.

The first demonstration of this method was done under the direction of Dr. Antonio Garcia (Arizona State University) and Dr Sonia Melle (Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain), by doctoral student  Ana Egatz-Gomez (Arizona State University),  who worked at the laboratory generously provided by Dr Miguel Angel Rubio (Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia, Madrid, Spain).  Research to better understand the physics of digital magnetofluidics and to develop biomedical applications is currently being performed in collaboration with researchers at [[Arizona State University]] and [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]].

It is believed that this method can lead to the development of so-called "Open Drop Assays" where individual drops of blood and other biological fluids can be rapidly analyzed to diagnose and treat diseases.

'''Ductwork airtightness''' can be defined as the resistance to inward or outward air leakage through the ductwork envelope (or ductwork shell). This air leakage is driven by differential pressures across the ductwork envelope due to the combined effects of stack and fan operation (in case of a mechanical ventilation system).

For a given HVAC system, the term ductwork refers to the set of [[Duct (flow)|ducts]] and fittings (tees, reducers, bends, etc.) that are used to supply the air to or extract the air from the conditioned spaces. It does not include components such as air handlers, heat recovery units, air terminal devices, coils. Attenuators, dampers, access panels, etc. are a part of the ductwork but have more functions than conveying the air and are therefore also referred to as technical ductwork products.

Ductwork airtightness is the fundamental ductwork property that impacts the uncontrolled leakage of air through duct leaks.

Typical reasons for poor ductwork airtightness include:&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). "An Introduction to Residential Duct Systems". LBNL, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. R. Carrié, J.  Andersson, P.  Wouters. "[http://www.aivc.org/resource/improving-ductwork-time-tighter-air-distribution-systems Improving ductwork—A time for tighter air distribution systems]". [[Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre]]. Coventry, UK., 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Mat&gt;F. R. Carrié and P. Pasanen. "Chapter 3. Ductwork, hygiene and energy. In M. Santamouris and P. Wouters (eds). Building ventilation — The state of the art". pp. 107-136. Earthscan, UK 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* inadequate or missing sealing media;
* worn tapes;
* poor workmanship around duct take-offs and fittings;
* ill-fitted components;
* physical damage.

An airtight ductwork has several positive impacts:&lt;ref name= Mat/&gt;&lt;ref name= Johny&gt;J. Andersson. "Swedish experience with airtight ductwork". The REHVA European HVAC Journal: Special issue on airtightness. January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[TightVent Europe]]. “Building and ductwork airtightness: Selected papers from the REHVA special journal issue on airtightness”. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Chris&gt;C. Delmotte. "[http://www.aivc.org/resource/vip-01-airtightness-ventilation-ducts?volume=33977 Airtightness of ventilation ducts]". [[Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre]] (AIVC) Ventilation Information Paper 01, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
* secured air transport through the duct system;
* lower energy bills due to less heat loss and fan energy wastage to compensate the effect of the leaks;
* lower leakage airflow rates to/from unconditioned spaces (which can affect energy use, power demand, indoor air quality and comfort);
* easier airflow [[Testing, adjusting, balancing|balancing]];
* lower duct leakage noise.

Sweden is often considered as a reference for airtight ducts: the requirements introduced in AMA (General material and workmanship specifications)&lt;ref&gt;	AMA VVS &amp; Kyl 12. Allmän material- och arbetsbeskrivning för VVS- och Kyltekniska arbeten (General Material and Workmanship Specifications of HVAC installations). AB Svensk Byggtjänst, Stockholm 2012. (in Swedish).&lt;/ref&gt; starting in 1950 have led to excellent ductwork airtightness on a regular basis in Sweden.&lt;ref name= Johny/&gt;&lt;ref name=ASIEPI_P187&gt;Peter G. Schild, Jorma Ralio.

In the US, there has been a significant amount of work showing energy saving potentials on the order of 20-30% in homes;&lt;ref&gt;Energy Star. "[http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=home_improvement.hm_improvement_ducts Duct Sealing]". Retrieved 5 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and 10-40% in commercial buildings with airtight ducts &lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory - Building Technology and Urban Systems Division (BTUS). "[https://homes.lbl.gov/research/hvac-system-technologies HVAC System Technologies]". Retrieved  5 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ASIEPI project technical report &lt;ref name= Guyot &gt;G. Guyot, F. R. Carrié and P. Schild, “Project ASIEPI – Stimulation of good building and ductwork airtightness through EPBD,” 2010&lt;/ref&gt; on building and ductwork airtightness estimated the heating energy impact of duct leakage in a ventilation system on the order of 0-5 kWh per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of floor area per year plus additional fan energy use for a moderately cold European region (2500 degree-days).

Duct leakage affects more severely the energy efficiency of systems that include air heating or cooling.

There are two major systems to classify ductwork airtightness, one based on European standards, the other based on [[ASHRAE 90.1|ASHRAE standard 90.1-2010]]. Both are based on the leakage airflow rate at a given duct pressure divided by the product of the duct surface area and the same duct pressure raised to the power 0.65. 
* In Europe, ductwork airtightness classes A to D are defined in European Standard EN 12237 &lt;ref&gt;EN 12237:2003: "Ventilation for buildings - Ductwork - Strength and leakage of circular sheet metal ducts", 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; for circular ducts and EN 1507 &lt;ref&gt;EN 1507:2006: "Ventilation for buildings - Sheet metal air ducts with rectangular section - Requirements for strength and leakage", 2006&lt;/ref&gt; for rectangular ducts. Class A is the leakiest class. A parallel standard to EN 12237, EN 1507 and EN 1751 based on the same leakage classification is EN 15727 which applies to technical ductwork products and specifies the leakage requirements for technical ductwork products. The leakage test method for system commissioning is described in EN 12599. Airtightness classes for air handling units (L1 to L3) are defined in EN 1886. System standards, in particular EN 13779, give further recommendations for airtightness class selection for different purposes.&lt;ref name= Guyot/&gt; 
* In the US, leakage classes 48, 24, 12, 6, 3 as defined by ASHRAE are commonly used; ASHRAE also gives recommended acceptance criteria based air leakage as a percentage of fan design airflow at maximum operating conditions.&lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE, "ASHRAE Handbook-Fundamentals- Chapter 21: Duct design." Atlanta, American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Power law model of airflow through leaks ==
The relationship between pressure and leakage air flow rate is defined by the [[power law]] model between the airflow rate and the pressure difference across the ductwork envelope as follows:

q&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;=C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;∆p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;

where:
* q&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the volumetric leakage airflow rate expressed in L.s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
* C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the air leakage coefficient expressed in L.s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.Pa&lt;sup&gt;−n&lt;/sup&gt;
* ∆p is the pressure difference across the ductwork envelope expressed in Pa
* n is the airflow exponent (0.5 ≤ n ≤ 1)

This law enables to assess the airflow rate at any pressure difference regardless the initial measurement.
Threshold limits in ductwork airtightness classifications usually assume an airflow exponent of 0,65.

== Pressurization test ==
Ductwork airtightness levels can be measured by temporarily connecting a device (sometimes called a [[Duct leakage testing|duct leakage tester]] to pressurize the ductwork including duct-mounted components. Air flow through the pressurizing device creates an internal, uniform, static pressure within the ductwork. The aim of this type of measurement is to relate the pressure differential across the ductwork to the air flow rate required to produce it. Generally, the higher the air flow rate required to produce a given pressure difference, the less airtight the ductwork. This pressurization technique is described in standard test methods such as EN 12237 and EN 1507, ASHRAE standard 90.1-2010. It is similar in principle to that used to characterize building airtightness.

==Duct sealing or duct tightening==

At construction stage, the airtightness of individual components depends on the design (rectangular or round ducts, pressed or segmented bends, etc.) and assembly (seam type and welding quality). 
Components with factory-fitted sealing devices (e.g., gaskets, clips) meant to ease and accelerate the installation process are widely used in Scandinavian countries.&lt;ref name= Chris/&gt; 
A variety of techniques are widely used to tighten duct systems on site, including gaskets, tapes, sealing compound (mastic), internal duct lining, aerosol duct sealing. So-called "duct tapes" are often not suited for sealing ducts,&lt;ref&gt;M. Holladay. "[http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/musings/sealing-ducts-what-s-better-tape-or-mastic Sealing Ducts: What’s Better, Tape or Mastic?]". Green Building Advisor, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Sherman and I. Walker. "[http://www.homeenergy.org/show/article/id/1400 Can Duct Tape Take the Heat]?". Home Energy Magazine Online, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; which explains why, in the US, the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) requires any tape used on duct board or flexible ducts to be labeled in accordance with UL 181A or 181B.

An '''electric go-kart''' is a [[go-kart]] powered by one or two [[electric motor]]s and [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]].
Many manufacturers offer electric go-karts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kartelec.com/f/en_oem.htm Kartelec], the list of manufacturers of electric gokart&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages / disadvantages ==

=== Advantages ===
Acceleration is usually better than thermic model and the speed is sufficient for use on most [[kart circuit]]s. Torque in electric motors are greater than that of the gas engine. They are ideal for quick take offs and off road climbing.

Electric go-karts are low maintenance, requiring only that the [[Lead-acid battery|lead-acid batteries]] of the cars be plugged into an array of chargers after each run. Since they are pollution-free and emit no smoke, the racetracks can be indoors in controlled environments. Most fully charged electric karts can run a maximum of 20 minutes before performance is affected. An expensive alternative is the use of [[Lithium iron phosphate]] LiPO4 lithium batteries. They last much longer and carry more power per pound than lead acid batteries.

Electric power Go-Karts do not have hot engines or a tank full of gas which can prove to be safer in an accident.

=== Disadvantages ===
Batteries are still very expensive and the autonomy is not that good. However, charging can be achieved in about 30 minutes and it is possible to swap batteries.

[[File:RESRace2startinggrid.jpg|thumb|Red Line Oil Karting Championship at [[Sonoma Raceway]], 2013.]]

== Racing ==
The ERDF Masters Kart racing event took place at the [[Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy|Paris-Bercy Arena]] in Paris, France in December 2011. Drivers from different [[auto racing]] series such as [[Formula 1]], [[GP2 Series]], [[World Rally Championship|WRC]], [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|DTM]], [[IndyCar]] or [[kart racing]] got to compete with electric karts powered by a 40&amp;nbsp;hp brushless type electric motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.kartelec.com/f/actu/111206_Sodi.htm Sodikart dévoile le SODI STX utilisé à Bercy] – Kartelec, 6 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a few other events for electric karts such as e-Kart, a university challenge, also in France.

In the US, the Red Line Oil Karting Championship of Northern California started hosting in 2013 a field of Ekarts (Category V, Group 2, Class 1) competing for the Rattlesnake Electric Sport Championship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rattlesnakeelectricsports.com/home.html Rattlesnake Electric Sport]&lt;/ref&gt; Most weekends, lap times were within less than a second of the fastest laps, with reliabity much better than their gas cousins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Go-kart|url=http://whichgokartsforsale.com/|publisher=whichgokartsforsale.com|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the G-Zero Championship Racing Series is set to start racing on temporary city street circuits in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gzeroracing.ca G-Zero Championship]&lt;/ref&gt; The G-Zero series uses all-electric zero-emissions karts built by EVC Racing of Indianapolis IN featuring a blend of parts used in motorcycle racing and new innovative battery technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evcracing.com/ EVC Racing]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
Since 2006, an annual electric karting challenge is organized by associations and e-Kart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-kart.fr/index.php?option=com_weblinks&amp;catid=13&amp;Itemid=31 Les challenges e-Kart]&lt;/ref&gt; This Challenge brings together manufacturers, schools, academic institutions (electrical engineering). This competition is played with machines expanding from 10 to 67 kilowatts, it takes place over three days and includes many tests (endurance 4 hours, best lap times, acceleration from stop over a distance of 50 meters, 10-minute races ...).

In 2013 the challenge has become international. It gathered 26 teams with 34 karts and 200 participants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-kart.fr/2013/resultats.htm Les résultats de la Rencontre Pédagogique Internationale de Kart Electrique de Vierzon e-Kart 2013] - Site officiel e-Kart&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Latvia, World's First ===

In 2015, Latvian company [http://blueshockrace.com Blue Shock Race] launched new technology type electric karts. [http://blueshockrace.com/#go-karts BSR2017] Blue Shock Race kart is first kart in world, which have changeable battery with small, extremely effective lithium battery pack, with one charge can drive 10-15 min. BSR2017 kart is most competitive kart in rental kart sector right now. &lt;ref&gt;http://blueshockrace.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World’s First National Electric Kart Championship''' &lt;ref&gt;http://blueshockrace.com&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2018 Latvia has become the first country in the World to officially hold the National Karting Championship for electric karts in classes TeK and TeK Open. The '''Championship kicked-off on May 1''' on the historical Kandava go-kart track and during the season 6 rounds have been completed on different tracks in total. The Latvian Electric Kart Championship finals ended on the Jelgava track “Rulītis”, where the winners of the Championship in the overall ranking were determined. [[File:Electric kart championship.jpg|thumb]]

The first champion to take the gold medal was '''Ričards Irbe''', who won 5 times in a row.  The second place in the overall ranking belongs to '''Raivis Veiksans''', who took the silver, while the third place and the bronze medal belongs to '''Raistis Plukss'''. 16 different racers from Latvia and Lithuania participated in the competition altogether. 
In the Championship all the racers started off on electric kart powertrains made by [http://blueshockrace.com Blue Shock Race], with a power output of 15 kW in Tek class and up to 25 kW power output in TeK Open class. During the Championship the best lap time was shown by '''Raivis Veiksans: 49.836 seconds'''.  [[File:Blue Shock Race World's first.jpg|thumb]]

The Championship was launched in partnership with the '''LMT Autosport Academy''', which has been engaging in involving young people in motorsports for several years now. Thanks to the experience of the Academy and involvement of “-teen” technical schools in the '''Latvian Electric Kart Championship''', it has become possible to gather 10 teams, which have worked hard on improving their equipment and have started off in the Championship. 
'''Blue Shock Race''' is a company that has been working with electric karts for 4 years already, developing this technology both in Latvia and throughout the World. Thanks to the '''Blue Shock Race''' experience, budget-friendly, technologically simple, and racing-friendly solutions have been created, allowing the racers to start off in the electric kart classes. 

Since another World’s Electric Kart Championship was launched in '''Germany on May 13''', now both of these countries, Latvia and Germany, can be considered as pioneers when it comes to holding National Electric Kart Championships, and in fact, both countries deserve to bear the title of the First Championship.
Currently '''Blue Shock Race''' is working on the development of new racing karts with a maximum output up to 55 kW with an ultimate racing capacity that can accelerate to 100km/h in about 2,2 seconds, making this class an upper professional class. 

In 2018 '''FIA''' and '''IOC''' have introduced Electric Karting as the first motorsport in the Youth Olympics and taking it to the '''2024 Olympics in Paris''', that’s when the Blue Shock Race has set aim to go for the first Olympic Gold medals in the Electric Karting division. 
[[File:Joan Todt FIA President.jpg|thumb]]

After Latvian national electric kart championship stage 4 in Kandava Latvian company Blue Shock Race launched new electric sports kart for professionals. This kart are capable to compete with DD2 division karts. In Latvia have TeK Open class where is allowed to race with 25kW karts and in 2019 will be more electric kart divisions.

A '''forest product''' is any material derived from [[forestry]] for direct consumption or commercial use, such as [[lumber]], [[paper]], or [[Fodder|forage]] for [[livestock]].  [[Wood]], by far the dominant [[product (business)|product]] of [[forest]]s, is used for many purposes, such as [[wood fuel]] (e.g. in form of [[firewood]] or [[charcoal]]) or the finished structural materials used for the [[construction]] of [[building]]s, or as a raw material, in the form of [[wood pulp]], that is used in the production of [[paper]].  All other non-wood products derived from forest resources, comprising a broad variety of other forest products, are collectively described as [[non-timber forest product]]s.

==Resource pressures==
{{See also|Sustainable forest management}}Many forest management policies have been implemented that impact forest product [[economics]], including forest access restrictions, harvesting fees, and harvest limits.  [[Deforestation]], [[global warming]] and other [[Environmentalism|environmental]] concerns have increasingly affected the availability and sustainability of forest products, as well as the economies of regions dependent upon forestry around the world.  In recent years, the idea of [[sustainable forestry]], which aims to preserve [[crop yield]]s without causing irreversible damage to [[ecosystem]] health, has changed the relationship between [[environmentalist]]s and the [[wood industry|forest products industry]].  [[Project stakeholder|Stakeholders]] in the forest products industry include government departments, commercial enterprises, [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), policy-makers and analysts, private  and international organizations.

==Forest products details==

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] publishes an annual yearbook of forest products. The FAO Yearbook of Forest Products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAO Yearbook of Forest Products 2012|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3732m/i3732m.pdf|website=fao.org/forestry/statistics/80570/en/|publisher=FAO|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a compilation of statistical data on basic forest products for all countries and territories of the world. It contains series of annual data on the volume of production and the volume and value of trade in forest products. It includes tables showing direction of trade and average unit values of trade for certain products. Statistical information in the yearbook is based primarily on data provided to the FAO Forestry Department by the countries through questionnaires or official publications. In the absence of official data, FAO makes an estimate based on the best information available.

FAO also publishes an annual survey of pulp and paper production capacities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pulp and paper capacity survey 2013-2018|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3961t.pdf|website=fao.org/forestry/statistics/81757/en/|publisher=FAO|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The survey presents statistics on pulp and paper capacity and production by country and by grade. The statistics are based on information submitted by correspondents worldwide, most of them pulp and paper associations, and represents 85% of the world production of paper and paperboard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1715">ӀA '''Gammator''' was a [[gamma irradiator]] made by the [[Radiation Machinery Corporation]] during the U.S. [[Atoms for Peace]] project of the 1950s and 1960s. The gammator was distributed by the "[[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] to schools, hospitals, and private firms to promote nuclear understanding."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/070312fa_fact_coll?page=2 A Reporter at Large: The Unthinkable: Reporting &amp; Essays: The New Yorker&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Around 120-140 Gammators were distributed throughout the U.S. and the whereabouts of several of them are unknown, although the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] has removed and destroyed many of the units.
==Specifications==
A Gammator weighed about 1,850 pounds and contained about 400 [[curies]] of [[caesium-137]] in a pellet roughly the size of a pen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA041105.1A.nuclear.1c677b031.html MySA.com: Metro | State&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Concerns==
Because of the massive shielding of a Gammator, the machine is very safe when used as intended (e.g. school science experiments); according to the Los Alamos National Laboratory, it is similar to machines used to irradiate blood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://osrp.lanl.gov/documents/OSR_Texas_Schools.pdf  Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL): Los Alamos helps Texas schools remove radioactive gammators]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this amount of nuclear material could pose a significant problem if used as the radioactive component in a [[dirty bomb]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4118">The '''Grimsel Tunnel''' ({{lang-de|Grimseltunnel}}) is a proposed {{convert|8.3|km|mi|adj=on}} tunnel for power transmission and [[rail transport in Switzerland]].  {{As of|2016}} it was planned to run under the [[Grimsel Pass]] and link the [[Zentralbahn]] at the north end with the [[Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn]] at the south, with planned opening in approximately 2025.&lt;ref name="rg-20160205"/&gt;  The [[Canton of Bern]], [[Canton of Valais]], and [[Swissgrid]] unveiled their joint plans on 4 February 2016.&lt;ref name="rg-20160205"/&gt;

The tunnel is proposed to carry a single-track [[metre gauge railway]] and [[railway electrification system]].&lt;ref name="rg-20160205"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/infrastructure/single-view/view/cantons-back-grimsel-tunnel-between-metre-gauge-networks.html|title=Cantons back Grimsel Tunnel to link metre gauge networks|work=Railway Gazette|date=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The total length of the new '''Grimsel Line''' ({{lang-de|Grimselbahn}}) route containing the tunnel would be {{convert|22|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name="green-20160204"/&gt;  It would link two groups of existing railway lines constructed to one-metre [[track gauge in Switzerland]], forming a contiguous route of {{convert|844|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name="green-20160204"/&gt;
The power transmission cables would run at 380kV and replace [[Swissgrid]]'s existing [[overhead power line]],&lt;ref name="rg-20160205"/&gt; and allow the removal of the 121 [[electricity pylon]]s that had been in place for sixty years.&lt;ref name="srf-20160204"/&gt;

The intended railway route would continue from the [[Brünig railway line]] at [[Meiringen railway station]], via the [[Meiringen–Innertkirchen railway]], to a stop at [[Innertkirchen]], then via new stations at [[Guttannen]] and [[Handegg]] (''{{lang|de|Handeck}}'') to [[Oberwald railway station]] for continuation via the [[Furka Base Tunnel]].  Travel time between Meiringen and Oberwald would be approximately 38 minutes—a reduction of three hours.&lt;ref name="hunkeler-20160204"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.derbund.ch/bern/region/bern-und-wallis-moechten-schmalspurbahn-durch-die-grimsel/story/30779391|title=In 38 Minuten von Meiringen nach Oberwald|work=Der Bund|first=Michael|last=Hunkeler|date=4 February 2016|accessdate=7 February 2016|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A company called {{lang|de|Grimselbahn AG}} was founded by the promoters, with Peter Teuscher as its chair person.&lt;ref name="schneeberger-20160204"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/bahn-und-starkstrom-durch-die-grimsel-1.18689503|title=in Tunnel für Strom und Schiene|work=Neue Zürcher Zeitung|first=Paul|last=Schneeberger|date=4 February 2016|accessdate=7 February 2016|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the estimated cost was 580-million Swiss Francs.&lt;ref name="green-20160204"/&gt; The split cost of 290-million Swiss Francs each for railway and power transmission usage would less than the individual estimated costs of 490-million Swiss Francs for a power-only tunnel or 430-million Swiss Francs for a rail-only tunnel.&lt;ref name="srf-20160204"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.srf.ch/news/regional/bern-freiburg-wallis/neuer-grimsel-tunnel-zwischen-berner-oberland-und-wallis|title=Neuer Grimsel-Tunnel zwischen Berner Oberland und Wallis|work=SRF|date=4 February 2016|accessdate=7 February 2016|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heat cost allocators''' are devices attached to individual [[radiator]]s in buildings that measure the total heat output of the individual radiator. Heat cost allocators can be either electronic, where one or two electronic thermosensors&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qundis.com/products/heat-cost-allocators&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[microcontroller]] are used to calculate the heat consumption of radiator by the temperature difference between the radiator and the air in room,&lt;ref name= techem&gt;{{cite web|title=Techem: Techem|url=http://www.techem.com/English/products-and-services/measuring-and-billing/meter-reading-and-devices/Heat_Cost/Radio_Heat/

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6958">[[United Nations]] Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-Moon]] established a '''High-Level Advisory Group on Climate Change Financing''' ('''AGF''') on 12 February 2010 for the duration of ten months.  The group's aim was to "study potential sources of revenue that will enable achievement of the level of climate change financing that was promised during the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December 2009."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High Level Advisory Group on Climate Change Financing|url=https://www.un.org/wcm/content/site/climatechange/pages/financeadvisorygroup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The group was co-chaired by [[Jens Stoltenberg]], Prime Minister of Norway, [[Meles Zenawi]], Prime Minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. Guyana President [[Bharrat Jagdeo]] was the third head of state on the board, but was not a co-chair. Members included experts from developed countries, developing countries, and from international development organizations and the academic world. British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] co-chaired with Zenawi from the group's formation in February 2010 to 6 June 2010, when he was replaced by Stoltenberg.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34937&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's mandate was to develop practical proposals on how to significantly scale-up long-term financing for mitigation and adaptation strategies in developing countries from various public as well as private sources.

==Report==
The High-Level Advisory Group released its [https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/climatechange/shared/Documents/AGF_reports/AGF%20Report.pdf final report] on 5 November 2010, just ahead of the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Cancun, Mexico. The report concluded that it is "challenging but feasible" to reach the goal of mobilizing US$100 billion annually for climate actions in developing countries by 2020.
 
The AGF Report examined various approaches, including existing and new public funding and increased private flows. Its definition of “public” finance includes “direct budget contributions” as one strand, with five others envisaging finance from carbon market auction revenues; revenue from international transport (shipping and airline taxes); carbon taxation; multilateral funds (most notably, IMF Special Drawing Rights); and an international [[financial transaction tax]]. Two work streams considering private finance will cover “using public finance to leverage private investment/finance” (including debt swaps and insurance schemes) and carbon markets (which includes CDM reform and sectoral proposals). In addition to the main report, they published eight different work streams paper, providing technical information and analysis for each finance source.

Although the AGF Report did not build a blueprint for implementing these sources, it does assess all sources based on eight criteria, which includes revenue, efficiency (carbon efficiency - the impact of a method on setting a price for carbon externality and overall efficiency - taking into account impacts on developed country growth and risks, equity (distribution of revenue), incidence (who really pays for the climate change mitigation and adaptation actions - should avoid payment by developing countries or inclusion of developing countries’ contribution in counting towards 100billion, practicality (feasibility before 2020), reliability, additionality to Official Development Assistance and acceptability (domestic political acceptability in both developed and developing countries).

==Criticism==
Critics claimed that the group could contribute to the downgrading of [[UNFCCC]] negotiations, as well as complaining of a lack of transparency and a significant gender bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The UN Boys Club tasked with redefining climate finance|url=http://www.carbontradewatch.org/articles/the-un-boys-club-tasked-with-redefining-climate-finance.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some civil society organizations do not agree that US 100 billion per year is sufficient for climate change financing, but overall, NGOs are content with the pressure on developed countries brought by the AGF report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Society's Reactions to the AGF Report|url=http://www.usclimatenetwork.org/resource-database/agf-report-press-document}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
The United States government rejected all new innovative sources at international scale proposed in the AGF report, namely, Financial Transaction Tax (FTTs), Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), and Bunker Fuels in the Maritime and Aviation Sector. Although the cap-and-trade bill was rejected at the Congress in 2010, the U.S. government still considers a carbon market as the more viable way to finance climate change activities.

The European Union in general favors innovative sources. With the fate of the Kyoto Protocol undetermined beyond 2012, the EU has limited offset projects in Least Developed Countries. Under the G20 leadership of the French presidency, the EU considered a Financial Transaction Tax at the European Union level, and channel the revenue for climate, health, education and other international development purposes. A detailed report was published stating [http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/articles/financial_operations/2011-04-scaling-up-international-climate-finance_en.htm European Commission's response to the AGF report]. Although "takes note" is relatively weak wording, the report was referenced in all submissions to the UNFCCC regarding climate finance, especially innovative sources.

Outside the UNFCCC system, the AGF report is extensively referenced in climate financing discussions at the G20, European Union, International Maritime Organization, and other international forums. As many other potential financing sources, accessing any new sources will require political will.  Efforts have been made under the G20 to remove fossil fuel subsidies, but they were not successful once again at the recent G20 meeting in Seoul.

Similar to the AGF report, there are many high-profile reports;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=IMF Staff Position Paper|title=Financing the Response to Climate Change|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/spn/2010/spn1006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Center for Global Development|title=Find Me the Money: Financing Climate and Other Global Public Goods - Working Paper 248|url=http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/1424979}}&lt;/ref&gt;  addressing climate finance sources with a focus on innovative sources. The international community is making critical decisions on how to mobilize up to US$100 billion per year by 2020 based on recommendations in these reports.

'''''Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots''''' contains 42 [[Lithography|lithographs]] with original hand painted colour by [[Edward Lear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/DLDecArts/DLDecArts-idx?id=DLDecArts.LearParrots |title=Illustrations of the family of Psittacidae, or Parrots |publisher=Digital Library for the Decorative Arts and Material Culture|accessdate=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lear started painting [[parrot]]s in 1830 when he was 18 years old, and by 1832 he had published 42 paintings of parrots as lithographic plates bound together as a book. A total of 175 books were made of which about 100 survive today. He painted live parrots at the [[London Zoo]] and some in private collections. The quality of his paintings of parrots established his reputation as one of the best natural history artists of his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ansp.org/museum/digital_collections/lear/parrots.php |publisher=[[Academy of Natural Sciences]] |title=Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots, London: 1832. |accessdate=2010-03-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322225610/http://www.ansp.org/museum/digital_collections/lear/parrots.php# |archive-date=2010-03-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Lear gained access to parrots in private collections through contacts he made while sketching at London Zoo.&lt;ref name="Reed2012"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Reed |first1=Christopher |title=Owl, pussycat … and superb artistry |url=https://harvardmagazine.com/2012/07/owl-pussycat-and-superb-artistry |website=Harvard Magazine |accessdate=1 August 2018 |language=en |date=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He met [[Benjamin Leadbeater]], a taxidermist and trader in specimens, who is credited in the captions as possessing several of the birds depicted. Another primary source of specimens was the menagerie of [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby|Edward Smith Stanley]], 13th Earl of Derby and then president of the [[Linnean Society]] (1828—1833).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hamilton |first1=John Andrew |authorlink1=John Andrew Hamilton |title=Dictionary of National Biography |date=1885–1900 |page=66 |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Stanley,_Edward_Smith_(DNB00) |chapter=Stanley Edward Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lear met Stanley in 1831 and spent time studying the parrots amongst his large collection of animals. Noted as the pinnacle of his natural history productions, during the period before his eyesight began to fail, the illustrations are regarded as exquisitely accurate and appealing. The work was a forerunner to the major volumes of bird paintings by Gould and Audubon, who had both worked with Lear. Sketches and studies for this work are included in the major Lear art collection held at the Harvard University [[Houghton Library]].&lt;ref name="Ireland"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ireland |first1=Corydon |title=Edward Lear’s natural history |url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/06/edward-lears-natural-history/ |website=Harvard Gazette |accessdate=1 August 2018 |date=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lithographic plates for Lear's publication were produced by [[Charles Joseph Hullmandel]], a printer noted for his reproduction of fine art. The full title is ''Illustrations of the family of Psittacidæ, or parrots: the greater part of them species hitherto unfigured, containing forty-two lithographic plates, drawn from life, and on stone''.

This change correlates with their temperature as they cool in the air.

'''Incandescence''' is the emission of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (including visible [[light]]) from a hot body as a result of its temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Treatise on Heat | author = [[Dionysius Lardner]] | publisher = Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green &amp; Longman | year = 1833 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jjYIAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA341 | quote = The state in which a heated body, naturally incapable of emitting light, becomes luminous, is called a state of ''incandescence''. | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171221063639/https://books.google.com/books?id=jjYIAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA341 | archivedate = 2017-12-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term derives from the Latin verb ''incandescere,'' to glow white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = An Introduction to Practical Chemistry, Including Analysis | author = John E. Bowman | edition = Second American | publisher = Philadelphia: Blanchard and Lea | year = 1856 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ffTcf4FGOx4C&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=incandesce+date:0-1860 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171221063640/https://books.google.com/books?id=ffTcf4FGOx4C&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=incandesce+date:0-1860 | archivedate = 2017-12-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Incandescence is a special case of [[thermal radiation]]. Incandescence usually refers specifically to [[visible light]], while thermal radiation refers also to [[infrared]] or any other [[electromagnetic radiation]].

For information on the intensity and spectrum (color) of incandescence, see [[thermal radiation]].

==Observation and use==
{{main|Thermal radiation}}
In practice, virtually all solid or liquid substances start to glow around {{convert|798|K|C}} (977 ˚F), with a mildly dull red color, whether or not a chemical reaction takes place that produces light as a result of an exothermic process. This limit is called the [[Draper point]]. The incandescence does not vanish below that temperature, but it is too weak in the visible spectrum to be perceivable.

At higher temperatures, the substance becomes brighter and its color changes from red towards white and finally blue.

Incandescence is exploited in [[incandescent light bulb]]s, in which a filament is heated to a temperature at which a fraction of the radiation falls in the visible spectrum. The majority of the radiation however, is emitted in the infrared part of the spectrum, rendering incandescent lights relatively inefficient as a light source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Illumination and Photometry | author = William Elgin Wickenden | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1910 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gVZDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=incandescent+low-efficiency+blackbody | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171221063640/https://books.google.com/books?id=gVZDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=incandescent+low-efficiency+blackbody | archivedate = 2017-12-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the filament could be made hotter, efficiency would increase; however, there are currently no materials able to withstand such temperatures which would be appropriate for use in lamps.

More efficient light sources, such as [[fluorescent lamp]]s and [[LED]]s, do not function by incandescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tdrp2F3BExAC&amp;pg=PT115&amp;dq=fluorescent+light+and+LEDs,+do+not+function+by+incandescence.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQ-rWGv5rYAhVL3GMKHbtuAacQ6AEIRzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=fluorescent%20light%20and%20LEDs,%20do%20not%20function%20by%20incandescence.&amp;f=false|title=Prefabulous + Almost Off the Grid: Your Path to Building an Energy-Independent Home|last=Koones|first=Sheri|date=2012-10-01|publisher=Abrams|isbn=9781613123966|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sunlight]] is the incandescence of the "white hot" surface of the [[sun]].

==Figurative use==
The word ''incandescent'' is also used figuratively to describe a person who is so angry that they are imagined to glow or burn red hot or white hot.&lt;ref&gt;Example 1:'...the stadium positively crackled with the incandescent anger of anguished supporters.' Mark Wilson, 'Rangers 1 Unirea 4', [[Daily Mail]], 21 October 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1221762/Rangers-1-Unirea-Urziceni-4-Groundhog-day-Gers-humbled-Dan-Petrescus-men.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120802091114/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1221762/Rangers-1-Unirea-Urziceni-4-Groundhog-day-Gers-humbled-Dan-Petrescus-men.html |archivedate=2012-08-02 |df= }}. Example 2: '...there's something very funny about incandescent anger.' Mark Fisher, 'Jerry has a cross to bear', ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 5 March 2006 [http://news.scotsman.com/jerryspringer/Jerry-has-a-cross-to.2756197.jp].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ishrat Hussain Usmani''', [[Nishan-i-Imtiaz|NI]] ([[Urdu Language|Urdu]]: ڈاکٹر عشرت حيسن عتثمانى&amp;lrm; 15 April 1917 – 17 June 1992), best known as '''I. H. Usmani''', was a Pakistani [[bureaucrat]] and an [[Atomic physics|atomic physicist]] who was the second chairman of [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] (PAEC) from 1960 to 1972; as well as the associate director of the [[Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission|Space Research Commission]].&lt;ref name="History"&gt;

During his career, he was also the Chairman of the [[Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency|Board of governors]] of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) from 1962 to 1963, and played a vital role there in country's peaceful development of [[nuclear technology]] to acquire the facilities.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; To his peer, he is remembered as one of chief architect of country's [[Nuclear power in Pakistan|nuclear power]] expansion and also given co-credited to established country's first [[Karachi Nuclear Power Plant|nuclear power plant in Karachi]] in co-operation with Canada, with Abdus Salam.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt;

As a bureaucrat, he lobbied for science and development to become part of [[Politics of Pakistan|national politics]] and his efforts were also involved sending hundreds of young Pakistan's students abroad to pursue higher education in the field of nuclear technology.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt; Due to his long tenure as chairman of the atomic energy commission, Usmani is colloquially known as father of the "atomic energy commission", a title given to his peers.&lt;ref name="PINSTECH"/&gt;

==Life and education==
Usmani was born into a respected, cultural, upper middle class, and an educated family of [[Delhi]] and [[Aligarh]]. After his school education in Aligarh he joined his maternal uncle Dr Khwaja Abdul Hamied, the founder of CIPLA and a pioneer of pharmaceutical industry in India, and joined the St Xavier's College Bombay from where he obtained in 19, his BS (with [[B.Sc. (Hons)|honours]]) in [[Physics]] and later obtained MSc in Physics from [[University of Bombay|Bombay University]]. In 1937, the Ishrat Usmani proceeded to the Imperial College, University of London, for research in [[atomic physics]] with the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Laureate]] [[Patrick Maynard Stuart Blackett|Professor P.M.S. Blackett]], and he produced a thesis entitled "''A study of the growth of compound crystals by electron diffraction''" in 1939.&lt;ref name="PINSTECH"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his doctorate in [[Atomic Physics]] from the [[Imperial College of Science and Technology]], London, after writing a brief thesis on [[Electron diffraction]], prior to start of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=" PINSTECH"/&gt; He thereafter successfully appeared in the Indian Civil Service Examination (ICS)and became the first ever entrant to that service with a PhD. On Partition of the undivided India into post independent India and Pakistan he opted to serve in Pakistan and served the Government of Punjab.

In 1950, while at London, he was personally invited and delegated by [[:Category:American nuclear physicists|American nuclear physicists]] dr. [[Alvin Martin Weinberg|Alvin M. Weinberg]], dr. [[Robert Charpi]], [[Karl Z. Morgan]]— the scientists who had worked in [[Manhattan Project]]— to the United States where he carried out his research in [[nuclear power]] and [[Nuclear reactor technology|reactor technology]] at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] whereas he served as a director of [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]].&lt;ref name="PINSTECH"/&gt;

==Government work==
Usmani returned to Pakistan in 1954, joining the [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Pakistan)|Directorate of Science]] the same year. He played a vital role and served in several senior administrative positions in [[Pakistan Government]]. In 1958, Usmani volunteered to join the newly established nuclear government agency, the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]], and personally tasked himself to build the [[Nuclear power in Pakistan|nuclear power]] program. Dr.Nazir Ahmed (physicist) was the chairman of the Commission at that time. Usmani played an important role in formulating the nuclear policy for Government of Pakistan. His recommendation and the newly proposed nuclear policy were gladly accepted by the then prime minister of Pakistan Husain Shaheed Suhrawardy and his p0sition in the government was upgraded to Minister of State.&lt;ref name="PINSTECH"/&gt; In 1959 Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who then Energy Minister in Ayub Khan's Cabinet, appointed him as a member of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"&gt;{{cite news|last=Yusuf|first=Suhail|title=Dr I. H. Usmani|url=http://www.dawn.com/2011/06/16/dr-i-h-usmani.html|accessdate=23 January 2012|newspaper=The Dawn News International |date=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission===

In 1960, Nazir Ahmad lost the slot as the Chairman of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission to Usmani, who became its second chairman, on a request of [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]].&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt; One of the earliest tasks he initiated was to begin building the man-power for the [[Nuclear power in Pakistan|nuclear power]] industry.&lt;ref name="PINSTECH"/&gt; He introduced the scholarship program at the commission and sent hundreds of scientists abroad.&lt;ref name="PINSTECH"/&gt; Usmani requested his lifelong friends Dr. [[Alvin Martin Weinberg]] and Dr. Robert Charpi to allow Pakistan's foreign exchange students to carry out their research at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL) and [[Argonne National Laboratory]] (ANL), asking them to arrange an on-the-job training programme in nuclear science and [[nuclear engineering|engineering]] for a team of PAEC personnel.&lt;ref name="PINSTECH"/&gt; In 1965, after Salam undertook to establish a world-class physics institute in Pakistan, Usmani lobbied for it in the United States. The institute is now called the [[Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology]] (PINSTECH).&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt; Building a world-class research establishment also gave Salam the opportunity to exercise his abundant artistic talent. He took particular interest in creating a laboratory that was a masterpiece of architecture, first by choosing the world-famous [[Edward Durrell Stone]] as architect, and then by paying full attention to every detail in the construction and the furnishing of the facility.&lt;ref name="PINSTECH"/&gt;

Professor Abdus Salam was Usmani's most trusted friend and adviser in science policy in the 1960s. He met with Salam when the latter was the professor of [[Theoretical Physics]] at the [[Imperial College of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref name=" PINSTECH"/&gt; He provided the crucial support to Salam in establishing the [[International Center for Theoretical Physics]] (ICTP), and played a supportive role to make Abdus Salam the Director of the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]].&lt;ref name="PINSTECH"/&gt; Salam and Usmani worked as a powerful team to obtain national and international support for the development of science and technology as fundamental to economic growth.&lt;ref name="PINSTECH"/&gt; It was Salam's advice to Usmani to establish the Pakistan Atomic Energy Center at Lahore where he made D. [[Ishfaq Ahmad]] as its first scientific director.&lt;ref name="PINSTECH"/&gt; Abdus Salam also helped Usmani to establish the various atomic research centres such as [[Nuclear Institute for Agriculture and Biology]] (NIAB) in [[Faisalabad]], and the [[Nuclear Institute for Food and Agriculture]] (NIFA) in [[Islamabad]].&lt;ref name="PINSTECH"/&gt;

Dr. I.H. Usmani conceived the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology as an architecturally inspiring edifice that would motivate scientists, and as many other Pakistani scientists, Usmani had worked closely with Abdus Salam on building [[nuclear power plant]]s. Usmani became the second chairman of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, where he, along with Dr. Abdus Salam, became an instrument in setting up nuclear research labs in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt;

===1971 war and atomic bomb project===
{{Main|Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons}}
By the 1971, the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] (PAEC) had turned into the world's leading nuclear organisation, and led PAEC in many international organisations.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt; His efforts to build the nuclear industry had turned Pakistan into the first [[Muslim world|Muslim]] country in the nuclear power capability.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt; Over the years, Usmani carefully and painstakingly developed the country's atomic energy program, and supervised the construction of the facilities that were producing prolific publications in nuclear technology.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt; In spite of being close to Bhutto, Usmani developed serious differences with and resentment towards Bhutto, after Bhutto continued interfering in his work.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt; Therefore, Usmani began to transfer scientists in different laboratories and directorates, to keep the scientists away to work on the [[atomic bombs]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Prior to start of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|East Pakistan crises]], followed by the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 ''Winter war'']], Usmani had disclosed all the facilities, technical institutes, and called back its personnel to [[West Pakistan|West-Pakistan]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} During this time, Usmani intensified Pakistan's non-nuclear weapon policy, and was instrumental in promoting the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT).{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

After witnessing the war, Usman's relations with Bhutto further deteriorated and Usmani began criticising Bhutto and his policies.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt; He was an outspoken and even a harsh critic of Bhutto's government policies which duly brought about an increase in the number of his enemies, even in his government agency.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt; In January 1972, Abdus Salam arranged and participated in a secret meeting which later emerged as  "Multan Meeting" where Salam invited Usmani to meet with [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime minister]] Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}
Large and loud complaints against Usmani were lodged; his peers and junior scientists, as well as his seniors, were turned against him. His actions of replacing and transferring scientists in different directorates that disrupted the research were criticised.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Bhutto lost no time to announce, [[nuclear engineer]] [[Munir Ahmad Khan]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} to be PAEC's new chairman. At this meeting, Usmani was the only scientist to have protested against the projecy [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|atomic bomb project]] to build the [[Pakistan and its Nuclear Deterrent Program|nuclear deterrence]] against India, while Abdus Salam remained silent in support of Bhutto when Usmani turned to Salam for the support. Usmani asked Prime minister Bhutto not to divert the peaceful programme to aggressive nuclear weapons, but Bhutto rebuffed, while Salam provided his support to appoint Munir Khan as the scientific director of the atomic bomb project.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

After the meeting, Usmani reached out to Bhutto and privately tried to have a conversation with Bhutto to reverse the decision of developing the [[atomic weapon]]s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} However, [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Prime Minister Bhutto]] patiently listened to him and declined his advice.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} The Following year, he was safely silenced. According to the Pakistan Defence Megazine, Usmani had opposed the decision of developing nuclear weapons "because at the time Pakistan did not have the necessary infrastructure needed for such a technologically giant and ambitious project".{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}  Still, as Bhutto needed the civilian infrastructure to be built, he established the [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Pakistan)|, he appointed Usmani Minister of Science]] in 1972.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In November 1972, when the [[Karachi Nuclear Power Plant|Kanupp-I]] was inaugurated, Usmani was deliberately not invited by Prime minister Bhutto, instead was accompanied by Abdus Salam and Munir Ahmad Khan at the ''Kanupp-I'' ceremony.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt; This was the foundation of Usmani's disagreement with Bhutto and later he claimed that in many of the scientific projects he was not taken into confidence by Bhutto. Usmani soon resigned.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt; Bhutto immediately replaced Usmani with Dr. [[Mubashir Hassan]], Bhutto's close friend and confidant who would later play a vital political role in scientific research on atomic bomb project.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt;

===Space Research Commission===
{{Main|Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission}}

Usmani contributed in the rise of [[Science in Pakistan|Pakistan's science]] and wholeheartedly provided his bureaucratic support to Abdus Salam to establish the [[Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission|Space Research Commission]] (SUPARCO)— the supreme national astrophysics and space authority— as a space-wing in the PAEC.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; Usmani was put jointly in charge (associate director) of Space Research Commission with Abdus Salam being the first and founding director.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; In 1962, Usmani and Salam travelled to United States where they had a brief meeting with [[NASA]]'s officials and due to their hard efforts, the United States and the [[NASA]]'s engineers and scientists visited Pakistan where NASA decided to set up the country's first [[spaceport]], [[Sonmiani|Sonmiani Terminal Launch]].&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

However, during the successive period, Abdus Salam decided to separate the authority from the PAEC; therefore, after reaching out to President Ayyub Khan, Salam succeeded in separating the authority, being its execute director in 1962.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; Abdus Salam brought in [[Brigadier-General]] and [[aerospace engineer]] Dr. [[Wladyslaw Turowicz]] of [[Pakistan Air Force|PAF]] in the space program, appointing him the director of the [[Sonmiani|Sonmiani Terminal Launch]].&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; Soon the [[Chronology of Pakistan's rocket tests|rocket testing programme]] was initiated by General Turowicz and Abdus Salam witnessed the country's first rocket launch, the ''[[Rehbar-I]]'' in 1964.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

==United Nations==

Due to Bhutto's intensification of his nuclear policy, that was completely disagreed and often protested by Usmani on numerous occasions at the cabinet-level meeting, led him to resign from his government post of which he was appointed by Bhutto.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt; As science minister, Usmani helped established the [[Pakistan Science Foundation]]— the government agency for the promotion of Science and Technology.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt; As science minister, Usmani presented the idea of Scientific Services, parallel to the Civil Service of Pakistan, with many scientist would soon follow him, for instance [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] who later took his place.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt;

However, Usmani departed from the country and took an international assignment of the United Nations.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt; Usmani was appointed the adviser to the [[UN Environment Programme]] (UNEP), headquartered and located in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], leading the surveys and reports on [[Solar radiation management]] and renewable energy in the developing states.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt; Usmani later went on to established the Solar radiation management centres in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Senegal]], and in 1978, Usmani left the UNEP to join the [[IAEA]].&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt;

===International Atomic Energy Agency===

Usmani became the Chairman of the [[Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency|Board of Governors]] of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], and headed many conferences entitled "[[Atoms for Peace]]".&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt; In 1978, [[Shah of Iran]] [[Mohammad Rezā Shāh Pahlavi|Mohammad Rezā Pahlavi]] invited Usmani to [[Iran]] to conduct a scientific survey to establish the three commercial [[nuclear power plant]]s in the country, but the scheme was never performed due to the [[Iranian Revolution]], and in 1980, Usmani joined the [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] (UNSCEAR) where he urged for peaceful use of nuclear technology.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt;

While there, he produced a brief investigative report on the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]] and made his efforts to enhance the [[NNPT|NPT]]. Unlike Salam, who remained associated with country's atomic bomb programme, Usmani was ejected from the atomic bomb programme. In 1981, Usmani published the influential technical article at the "''Nucleonics Week''— an influential European nuclear publication— claiming that the atomic bomb project has been failed and is unlikely ever to be capable of producing even the crudest of nuclear devices; therefore the programme is near collapse.&lt;ref name="History Commons"&gt;{{cite web|last=Commons|first=History|title=History Commons: Profile: Ishrat Usmani|url=http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=ishrat_usmani_1|work=History Commons|publisher=History Commons|date=8 January 1981|accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, Usmani was notified and knew well that in fact, the atomic bomb project was a complete success and the atomic bomb program has gone mature and passed the critical phase of producing the fissile cores had been achieved since 1978.&lt;ref name="History Commons"/&gt; His publication played an influential role in convincing the United States' policy to ease off the nuclear embargo on Pakistan.&lt;ref name="History Commons"/&gt;

Usmani served as an energy adviser to the United Nations in New York, and adviser to the UNSCEAR until 1985.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt; Soon his resignation from the United Nations, Usmani joined the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International]], (BCCI) as an adviser and remaining their until 1991.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt; He finally took the retirement and returned to Pakistan after long 17 years. While in Pakistan, Usmani became a consultant of the [[New and Emerging Sciences and Technology]] (NEST), a scientific think tank based in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News International"/&gt;

==Death and legacy==

Usmani remained a vital scientific figure in Pakistan's [[Civil Service of Pakistan|Civil Service]], and is widely given the credit of presenting the idea of scientific civil service, with many engineers and scientists would soon follow his footsteps. However, he is most remembered for established the country's [[Nuclear power in Pakistan|nuclear industry]], and was involved in the civil-peaceful projects as part of Pakistan's During the 1960s, Usmani's effort was involved in [[:Category:Nuclear technology in Pakistan|nuclear technology project]].

It was Usmani's effort to send 500 scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and [[physicist]] into the best institutions of United States and Europe. In 1972, KANUPP was inaugurated by the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]]; KANUPP was successfully commissioned marking Pakistan's entry in the nuclear age as the second developing – and the only Muslim – country to draw energy from the heart of the [[atom]].

Dr. Usmani peacefully died in [[Karachi]] on 17 June 1992, and the occasion brought tears to the eyes of many scientists and reformers who regarded him with affection. In May 1998, the [[Government of Pakistan]] belatedly recognised Usmani's vital services by awarding the [[Civil decorations of Pakistan|Pakistan's highest civilian award]], [[Nishan-i-Imtiaz]] posthumously by the prime minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] when Pakistan conducted its [[Chagai-I|first successful nuclear tests]].

'''J. Horace McFarland''' (1859–1948) from [[McAlisterville, Pennsylvania]] was a leading proponent of the "[[City Beautiful Movement]]" in the United States.

==Life==
McFarland was the son of [[Union Army|Union]] [[American Civil War|Civil War]] colonel [[George F. McFarland]]. He lived and worked most of his adult life in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], residing at an estate he named Breeze Hill in the Bellevue Park area of the city. At the estate, McFarland established gardens that featured numerous trees, vegetables, and, most prominently, roses. Photos of his famous gardens reside in the Smithsonian institution. McFarland served as president of the [[American Civic Association]] (ACA) from 1904 to 1924 and the American Rose Society.

== Meteorological synopsis ==
{{Expand section|date=April 2016}}
[[Image:2011 Groundhog Day Blizzard NOAA.jpg|thumb|'''[[NOAA]]''' color-enhanced photograph of storm system on February 1, 2011.]]
A system with a maximum pressure of {{Convert|1052|mbar|inHg}} followed behind it, moving across [[Montana]]. A low pressure system from the Pacific Ocean later came ashore over [[Northern California]] and crossed the [[Rocky Mountains]], merging with the Alberta Clipper low and a developing [[Texas low]] drawing moisture from the northwestern [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The storm later intensified, and moved northeast, developing a long warm front stretching toward the New England states, and moving northeast along this [[jet stream]] track.

[[Lake-effect snow|Lake effect]] snow events started over [[Lake Ontario]] and [[Lake Michigan]] from northeasterly winds. Following the predominant jet pattern, the storm developed a very rapid forward trajectory and began to migrate toward the lower Great Lakes. The heaviest snow fell in a wide swath from central Oklahoma to Illinois, [[Indiana]] and the [[Ohio Valley]]. An official blizzard warning was issued in [[Southern Ontario]] for the first time since 1993, although the Canadian definition changed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pope |first=Alexandra |title=What is a blizzard? |url=http://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/storm_watch_stories3&amp;stormfile=what_is_a_blizzardij_010211 |accessdate=2 February 2011 |newspaper=The Weather Network News |date=February 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402135508/http://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/storm_watch_stories3%26stormfile%3Dwhat_is_a_blizzardij_010211 |archivedate= 2 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Areas from the [[Lake Huron]] shoreline east to [[London, Ontario|London]] and [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] were under a [[Blizzard Warning]].

On Wednesday, authorities in Juárez announced that convoys would be traveling out to remote regions and slum areas to ensure that citizens are warm and have the supplies they need to get through the next few days. On Thursday, Mexican officials suspended energy exports to Texas, citing cold weather damage at five power stations across Mexico that resulted in a total loss of 1,000&amp;nbsp;megawatts of electricity in Northern Mexico. Power stations in Mexico were able to meet the resulting energy demands in Northern Mexico, but could not spare additional electricity to aid Texas.&lt;ref name="elpasotimes1"&gt;[http://www.elpasotimes.com/newupdated/ci_17275212 Update: Mexico suspends energy exports to Texas]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

[[Connecticut]] experienced up to 10&amp;nbsp;inches of snow and 3/4&amp;nbsp;inch ice accumulations, resulting in widespread tree damage and power outages.  The additional snow and ice accumulation on top of several feet of snow prior to the storm led to roof collapses in [[Bethany, Connecticut|Bethany]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], and [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]].  The [[West Rock Tunnel]] on the [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]]  was closed for several hours due to accidents caused by slippery conditions, while service was disrupted on the [[Metro-North]] Railroad and at [[Bradley International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtnh.com/dpp/weather/winter_weather/ice-storm-connecticut-feb2 5-car crash closes West Rock Tunnel, WTNH-TV Feb 2, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtnh.com/dpp/weather/winter_weather/ice-storm-connecticut-feb2 Very cold air, strong winds in forecast, WTNH-TV, Feb 2, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy snow caused at least 136 roof collapses of barns, greenhouses and other farm structures.&lt;ref name="Press"/&gt;

====Ohio====
Ohio was on the warm sector of the low-pressure system. On the night of January 31-February 1, the [[Cleveland]] and [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] area received a Winter Storm Warning from the NWS Cleveland Field Office for snow and freezing rain. On Monday night 3-6&amp;nbsp;inches of snow fell during the pre-frontal warm front. During the overnight hours of February 1–2, as the center of low pressure moved from Missouri to lower Indiana, it carried a warm front, with warm air advection and a shallow cold air pool at the bottom. This led to freezing rain in parts of [[Northeast Ohio]]. In [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] ice accretion ranged from 0.5 to 0.75&amp;nbsp;inch, which led to power lines and trees crashing, leaving almost 40,000 people without power. In the Greater Cleveland area, there was 0.1&amp;nbsp;inch of ice accretion and scattered outages in the Cleveland suburbs of [[North Royalton, Ohio|North Royalton]], where 2,000 people lost power, and also in parts of [[Garfield Heights, Ohio|Garfield Heights]] and [[Maple Heights, Ohio|Maple Heights]]. Scattered outages were reported in other parts of the area.

The temperatures overnight went from {{convert|25|F|C}} at 7:00PM to {{convert|42|F|C}} at 5:00 AM turning the freezing rain to liquid rain, and the NWS canceled the Winter Storm Warning earlier at 5:00. On Wednesday morning as the low moved to New England, cold air advected behind the low and temperatures had plummeted to the middle-20s Fahrenheit by 4:00 PM with Cleveland receiving 1-2&amp;nbsp;inches of snow and breezy conditions.

Precipitation tapered off to mainly freezing drizzle during the afternoon and early evening of the 1st. Heavier precipitation moved in again during the evening of the 1st and fell as freezing rain in the Philadelphia suburbs, a mixture of sleet and freezing rain in Berks County and the Lehigh Valley and mainly a snow and sleet mixture in the Poconos. Overnight colder air moved in aloft in over the Poconos and precipitation changed back to all snow for a few hours. Toward sunrise on the 2nd, this process started to reverse at both the surface and aloft. Warmer air was moving north again and the freezing rain changed to plain rain across the Philadelphia suburbs and Berks County around 8 a.m. EST and the Lehigh Valley around 9 a.m. EST. In the Poconos, precipitation changed to freezing rain around 7 a.m. EST and ended as freezing rain around 11 a.m. EST on the 2nd. Representative snow and sleet accumulations included 5.4 inches in Tobyhanna (Monroe County), 5.0 inches in Pocono Summit (Monroe County), 3.5 inches in Delaware Water Gap (Monroe County), 2.1 inches at the Lehigh Valley International Airport, 1.5 inches in Albrightsville (Carbon County) and 1.0 inch in Easton and Martins Creek (Northampton County). Representative ice accretions included 0.50 inches in Glenmoore (Chester County), Sping Mount (Montgomery County) and Emmaus (Lehigh County), 0.40 inches in East Nantmeal (Chester County) and Lansdale (Montgomery County), 0.38 inches in Kutztown (Berks County) and Allentown (Lehigh County), 0.33 inches in Feasterville (Bucks County) and 0.25 inches in Bangor (Northampton County).

=====Power outages=====
Many trees still had snow on them from the winter storm of the previous week to exacerbate the damage. Nearly 300,000 power outages occurred. PECO Energy reported about 185,000 of its southeastern Pennsylvania customers lost power. Power was not completely restored to the last few until the afternoon of the 6th. Pennsylvania Power and Light reported about 79,000 of their customers lost power in Eastern and Central Pennsylvania; while Metropolitan Edison reported around 14,000 of its customers lost power in Berks County. Numerous schools cancelled classes on both the 1st and 2nd. Recycling and garbage pick-ups were delayed. This winter storm added additional strains to snow removal budgets and tight salt supplies. Reading, Hamburg, Boyertown, Birdsboro, Barto, Bechtelsville and Douglassville all suffered power outages. In Bucks County, downed wires in Milford caused a basement fire in one home on Sleepy Hollow Road. In Montgomery County, the worst reported tree and ice damage occurred in Lansdale and Hatfield. A utility pole fire in Pottstown knocked out power to the borough's water treatment plant. There were over 100 reports of downed wires throughout Northampton County.

=====Travel=====
In Northampton and Lehigh County, numerous crashes occurred on U.S. Route 22, Pennsylvania State Route 33 and Interstate 78. On Interstate 78, a driver swerved to avoid hitting a plow truck and was injured. In Bethlehem, a driver was injured after his vehicle rolled over on Schoenersville Road. Also in Bethlehem, a 100-foot section of a porch roof collapsed on the evening of the 2nd on Glendale Avenue from the weight of ice and snow. Three vehicles were damaged. In Berks County, Pennsylvania State Routes 345 (near Birdsboro) and 625 (south of Reading) were closed. In Chester County, there were several slip and fall injuries reported, mainly on the 1st. Just east of Exton, Northbound U.S. Route 202 was closed between Pennsylvania State Routes 30 and 401 because of an accident with injuries on the 2nd. Two roadways were closed because of downed trees and wires in North Coventry Township. One roadway was also closed in West Vincent Township.

==== Texas ====
In Texas the storm caused widespread disruption of road and air traffic, including flights into and out of [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport]] and [[Dallas Love Field|Love Field]]. [[Rolling blackout]]s were instituted across the state as high demand for electricity left the power grid overloaded and unable to handle the demand. Governor [[Rick Perry]] asked for citizens to conserve as much electricity as they can to help ease the overloaded power grids. [[Electric Reliability Council of Texas|ERCOT]], the governing body responsible for most of the electricity distribution in Texas, reported that more than 75% of the state was affected by rolling blackouts on February 2nd; at one point demand for energy was so great that utility companies began to purchase electricity off the national grids to meet the demand. Parts of Texas were expected to experience additional rolling blackouts Wednesday and Thursday as workers labor to get the electric systems back up and running. Post-analysis indicated that the cold temperatures had caused over 150 generators to encounter difficulties; loss of supply, instrumentation failures, and gas well-head freezing were some of the source causes.&lt;ref name=nerc&gt;http://www.nerc.com/files/2011ltra_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the [[Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex]], multiple large school districts were closed for a record-setting 5 days in a row, letting students out a whole week because of road hazards due to ice and snow. An ice storm affected areas as far south as [[Houston]] behind the main storm front, while three men were killed near Houston in traffic accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tolson|first=Mike|title=Houston on ice|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/7413862.html|accessdate=5 February 2011|newspaper=Chron|date=February 5, 2011|author2=Cindy George}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storm adversely affected activities in the week leading up to [[Super Bowl XLV]], which was played at [[Cowboys Stadium]] in [[Arlington, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jhP8LmrqB8FEI5uKMAux210FbPsA?docId=9ab553b9b4894168a49c93999377bce9 Texas needs late rally to save Super Bowl week] Associated Press via Google News February 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The storm caused a failure at a [[water treatment plant]] near [[Donna, Texas]], prompting officials to issue a [[boil water advisory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Action 4 News Staff|title=Winter blast prompts boil water notice in Donna|url=http://www.valleycentral.com/news/story.aspx?id=576963|accessdate=6 February 2011|newspaper=Valley Central|date=February 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[El Paso, Texas]], the storm left major roadways slippery with ice and snow, and the abrupt demands placed on El Paso's utility services resulted in sporadic reports of loss of water and [[natural gas]] capability. Freezing temperatures resulted in the total failure of both of the city's natural gas power plants, resulting in rolling blackouts across the city.&lt;ref&gt;Schaladen, Marty. [http://www.elpasotimes.com/newupdated/ci_17275289 Utility copes with lower output, higher demand] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130122145214/http://www.elpasotimes.com/newupdated/ci_17275289 |date=2013-01-22 }}. ''[[El Paso Times]]''. Retrieved 2011-02-03.&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of power had a ripple effect across the region, as the power failure left water and gas utilities without the power needed to operate pumps to move the water and natural gas to customers. This resulted in the complete cancellation of activities at all area independent school districts and institutions of higher education on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and the following Monday. In total, nearly 200,000 El Paso Electric customers went without power at some point as a result of the storm, while 1,200 Texas Gas Service customers went without gas. Over 157 water main breaks due to cold temperatures were reported to the El Paso Water Utilities, which when combined with the frozen water pumping equipment and abnormally high demand for water left El Paso water reservoirs dangerously low. Stage 2 mandatory water restrictions, which permit the use of water for drinking only, were implemented Monday night as the water utility worked to raise the water levels in the reservoirs, and on Wednesday the water restrictions were lifted. That same Wednesday it was announced that federal and state officials would conduct an investigation into El Paso Electric as a result of the spectacular failure of the utility during the blizzard.

==Non-winter weather events==

=== High winds ===
Strong [[gale]]-force winds were expected in many areas, especially places northwest of the [[Appalachian Mountain]]s.  A [[storm warning]] for the entirety of Lake Michigan went up on 1 February, replacing an existing [[gale warning]].  Sustained winds of 39 to 55&amp;nbsp;mph and gusts to 70&amp;nbsp;mph or higher were reported over portions of Illinois, Wisconsin, and Lake Michigan for several hours at the height of the storm according to the National Weather Service.

=== Flash freeze ===
Parts of Texas and [[Louisiana]] east to the [[Mississippi Valley]] and [[Florida Panhandle]] experienced or were to experience rapid drops in temperature and [[flash freeze]] events after the [[squall line]] moved through.

=== Storm surge ===
Localized flooding occurred in northeastern Illinois, near the coast of Lake Michigan where strong winds brought [[storm surge]] and [[Lakeshore Flood Warning|lakeshore flooding]].&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/02/01/the-snowpocalypse-tsunami-blizzard-could-send-18-foot-waves-into-downtown-chicago-tonight/ | title=The Snowpocalypse Tsunami?

===Preparations===
Local governments ahead of the storm prepared residents on procedures to follow during the storm. This included parking and driving restrictions and preparation of road clearing equipment. Street clearing crews applied chemicals to the roadways to pre-melt ice and snow and checked equipment prior to the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Grove, Dustin|title=Michiana preps for major winter storm|url=http://www.wsbt.com/news/wsbt-communities-prepare-for-major-winter-storm-20110131,0,7760874.story|accessdate=2 February 2011|publisher=South Bend Tribune|date=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kudurru for Šitti-Marduk''' is a white limestone boundary stone ([[Kudurru]]) of [[Nebuchadrezzar I]], a king of the 2nd Dynasty of [[Isin]], ca. the late 12th century BC. He is known to have made at least four kudurru boundary stones.

Some kudurrus are known for their representations of the king, etc, who conscripted the stones production. Most kudurrus are attested by honored gods of [[Mesopotamia]] and are often displayed graphically in segmented [[Register (sculpture)|register]]s on the stone.

The obverse of the ''Kudurru for Šitti-Marduk'' is composed of six [[Register (sculpture)|registers]], with gods, beings (a [[Scorpion man]] for example), etc. The recto contains [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] text, relating the military services of Šitti-Marduk.

'''Lake Natron''' is a [[salt lake|salt]] and [[soda lake]] in [[Arusha Region]] in northern [[Tanzania]]. It is in the [[Gregory Rift]], which is the eastern branch of the [[East African Rift]].&lt;ref name="WWF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at0901|title=Eastern Africa: Northern Tanzania, on the border with Kenya|work=World Wildlife Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[lake]] is within the [[Lake Natron Basin]], a [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar Site]] wetland of international significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rsis.ramsar.org/ris/1080|title=Lake Natron Basin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:LakeNatron satellite labelled.jpg|thumb|right|The southern half of Lake Natron (top). [[Fault scarp]]s and the [[Gelai Volcano]] can also be seen. Numerous near-white salt-crust "rafts" pepper the shallowest parts of the lake (inset).]]

The [[lake]] is fed principally by the [[Southern Ewaso Ng'iro|Southern Ewaso Ng'iro River]], which rises in central [[Kenya]], and by mineral-rich hot springs.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt; It is quite shallow, less than {{convert|3|m|ft|spell=in}} deep, and varies in width depending on its [[water]] level. The [[lake]] is a maximum of {{convert|57|km}} long and {{convert|22|km}} wide.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt; The surrounding area receives irregular seasonal rainfall, mainly between [[December]] and [[May]] totalling {{convert|800|mm|in}} per year.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt; Temperatures at the [[lake]] are frequently above {{convert|40|°C|°F}}.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

High levels of evaporation have left behind [[natron]] ([[sodium carbonate]] decahydrate) and [[trona]] (sodium sesquicarbonate dihydrate). The alkalinity of the lake can reach a [[pH]] of greater than 12. The surrounding bedrock is composed of alkaline, sodium-dominated [[trachyte]] lavas that were laid down during the [[Pleistocene]] period. The lavas have significant amounts of [[carbonate]] but very low [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] levels. This has allowed the [[lake]] to concentrate into a caustic alkaline brine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fhC_nz8eHh0C&amp;pg=PA129 "Alkaline Environments", authored by W. D. Grant and B. E. Jones, in ''Encyclopedia of Microbiology'', editor-in-chief Joshua S. Lederberg, Academic Press, 2010, page 129, accessed 24 November 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
The color of the [[lake]] is characteristic of those where very high [[evaporation]] rates occur. As water evaporates during the dry season, salinity levels increase to the point that salt-loving [[microorganism]]s begin to thrive. Such [[halophile]] organisms include some [[cyanobacteria]] that make their own food with [[photosynthesis]] as plants do. The red accessory photosynthesizing pigment in the cyanobacteria produces the deep reds of the open water of the lake and the orange colors of the shallow parts of the lake. The [[alkali]] salt crust on the surface of the lake is also often colored red or pink by the salt-loving [[microorganism]]s that live there.
[[Salt marsh]]es and freshwater wetlands around the edges of the lake do support a variety of plants.

==Fauna==
[[File:Lake Natron satellite.JPG|thumb|Lake Natron as seen on NASA's [[World Wind]] program]]
Most animals find the lake's high temperature (up to 60&amp;nbsp;°C) and its high and variable salt content inhospitable. Nonetheless, Lake Natron is home to some [[Endemism|endemic]] [[algae]], [[invertebrates]], and [[birds]]. In the slightly less salty water around its margins, some [[fish]] can also survive.

The lake is the only regular breeding area in [[East Africa]] for the 2.5 million [[lesser flamingo]]es, whose status of "near threatened" results from their dependence on this one location. When [[salinity]] increases, so do [[cyanobacteria]], and the lake can also support more nests. These flamingoes, the single large flock in [[East Africa]], gather along nearby saline lakes to feed on ''[[Spirulina (genus)|Spirulina]]'' (a blue-green algae with red pigments). Lake Natron is a safe breeding location because its [[Corrosive substance|caustic]] environment is a barrier against [[Predation|predators]] trying to reach their nests on seasonally forming [[evaporite]] islands. [[Greater flamingo]]es also breed on the [[mud flats]].

The lake has inspired the nature documentary [[The Crimson Wing: Mystery of the Flamingos]] by [[Disneynature]], for its close relationship with the [[Lesser flamingo|lesser flamingoes]] as their only regular breeding area.

Two endemic fish species, the [[Alcolapia|alkaline tilapias]] ''[[Alcolapia latilabris]]'' and ''[[Alcolapia ndalalani|A. ndalalani]]'', also thrive in the waters at the edges of the hot spring inlets. ''[[Alcolapia alcalica|A. alcalica]]'' is also present in the lake, but is not endemic.

==Threats and preservation==
The area around the [[salt lake]] is not inhabited but there is some herding and some seasonal cultivation. Threats to the salinity balance from increased siltation influxes will come from more projected [[logging]] in Natron watersheds and a planned [[hydroelectric]] [[power plant]] on the Ewaso Ng'iro across the border in [[Kenya]]. Although development plans include construction of a dike at the north end of the lake to contain the freshwater, the threat of dilution to this breeding ground may still be serious. There is no formal protection.

A new threat to Lake Natron is the proposed development of a [[soda ash]] plant on its shores. The plant would pump water from the lake and extract the sodium carbonate to convert to washing powder for export. Accompanying the plant would be housing for over 1000 workers, and a coal-fired power station to provide energy for the plant complex. In addition, there is a possibility the developers may introduce a hybrid [[brine shrimp]] to increase the efficiency of extraction.
[[File:Lengai from Natron.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ol Doinyo Lengai]] seen from Lake Natron]]

According to Chris Magin, the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds|RSPB's]] international officer for Africa, "The chance of the lesser flamingoes continuing to breed in the face of such mayhem are next to zero. This development will leave lesser flamingoes in East Africa facing extinction". Seventy-five percent of the world's lesser flamingoes are born on Lake Natron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Billock|first1=Jennifer|title=The Deadly Lake Where 75 Percent of the World's Lesser Flamingoes Are Born|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/flamingos-find-life-among-death-180959265/|accessdate=17 June 2016|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|date=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently a group of more than fifty East African conservation and environmental institutions are running a worldwide campaign to stop the planned construction of the soda ash factory by Tata Chemicals Ltd of Mumbai, India and National Development Corporation of Tanzania. The group working under the umbrella name Lake Natron Consultative Group is being co-ordinated by Ken Mwathe, Conservation Programme Manager at [[BirdLife International]]'s Africa Secretariat.

As per communication on June 2008, Tata Chemicals shall not proceed with the Natron Project and further re-examination of this project will be subject to the Ramsar Wetlands plan, which is currently under preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tatachemicals.com/downloads/Position%20Statement%20on%20the%20Lake%20Natron%20Project-13-06-08.pdf |title=Position Statement on the Lake Natron Project |format=PDF |date=2008-06-13 |accessdate=2013-10-07 |publisher=Tata Chemicals |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005011839/http://www.tatachemicals.com/downloads/Position%20Statement%20on%20the%20Lake%20Natron%20Project-13-06-08.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its unique biodiversity, Tanzania named the Lake Natron Basin to the [[Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance]] on 4 July 2001. The lake is also the [[World Wildlife Fund]] East African halophytics [[ecoregion]].

==Visiting the area==
There are a number of campgrounds near the [[lake]], which is also the base for climbing [[Ol Doinyo Lengai]].

'''Lithium chloride''' is a [[chemical compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] [[Lithium|Li]][[Chlorine|Cl]]. The [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] is a typical [[ionic compound]], although the small size of the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion gives rise to properties not seen for other alkali metal chlorides, such as extraordinary solubility in polar [[solvent]]s (83.05&amp;nbsp;g/100&amp;nbsp;mL of water at 20&amp;nbsp;°C) and its [[hygroscopic]] properties.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Ulrich Wietelmann, Richard J. Bauer "Lithium and Lithium Compounds" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'' 2005, Wiley-VCH: Weinheim.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical properties==
The salt forms crystalline [[water of crystallization|hydrates]], unlike the other alkali metal chlorides.&lt;ref&gt;Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. ''Inorganic Chemistry'' Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mono-, tri-, and pentahydrates are known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hönnerscheid Andreas |author2=Nuss Jürgen |author3=Mühle Claus |author4=Jansen Martin | year = 2003 | title = Die Kristallstrukturen der Monohydrate von Lithiumchlorid und Lithiumbromid | url = | journal = Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie | volume = 629 | issue = | pages = 312–316 | doi = 10.1002/zaac.200390049 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The anhydrous salt can be regenerated by heating the hydrates.  Molten LiCl hydrolyzes to give LiOH and HCl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kamali A.R. |author2=Fray D.J. |author3=Swandt C. | year = 2011 | title =  Thermokinetic characteristics of lithium chloride| url = | journal = J Therm Anal Calorim | volume = 104 | issue = | pages = 619–626 | doi = 10.1007/s10973-010-1045-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
LiCl also absorbs up to four equivalents of [[ammonia]]/mol. As with any other ionic chloride, solutions of lithium chloride can serve as a source of [[chloride]] ion, e.g., forming a precipitate upon treatment with [[silver nitrate]]:
: LiCl + AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  →  AgCl + LiNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

==Preparation==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
[[Lithium]] chloride is produced by treatment of [[lithium carbonate]] with [[hydrochloric acid]].  It can in principle also be generated by the highly [[exothermic reaction]] of lithium metal with either [[chlorine]] or anhydrous [[hydrogen chloride]] gas.  Anhydrous LiCl is prepared from the hydrate by heating with a stream of [[hydrogen chloride]].

==Uses==
Lithium chloride is mainly used for the production of [[lithium]] metal by [[electrolysis]] of a LiCl/[[potassium chloride|KCl]] melt at {{convert|450|C|F}}.  LiCl is also used as a brazing [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]] for [[aluminium]] in [[automobile]] parts. It is used as a [[desiccant]] for drying air streams.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;  In more specialized applications, lithium chloride finds some use in [[organic synthesis]], e.g., as an additive in the [[Stille reaction]]. Also, in biochemical applications, it can be used to precipitate [[RNA]] from cellular extracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| doi= 10.1089/dna.1983.2.329

Lithium chloride is also used as a [[Pyrotechnic colorant|flame colorant]] to produce dark red flames.

Lithium chloride is used as a relative humidity standard in the calibration of [[hygrometer]]s.  At {{convert|25|C|F}} a saturated solution (45.8%) of the salt will yield an equilibrium relative humidity of 11.30%. Additionally, lithium chloride can itself be used as a hygrometer. This deliquescent salt forms a self-solution when exposed to air.  The equilibrium LiCl concentration in the resulting solution is directly related to the relative humidity of the air. The percent relative humidity at {{convert|25|C|F}} can be estimated, with minimal error in the range {{convert|10-30|C}}, from the following first order equation: RH=107.93-2.11C, where C is solution LiCl concentration, percent by mass.

Molten LiCl is used for the preparation of [[carbon nanotube]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.carbon.2014.05.089 | volume=77 | title=Towards large scale preparation of carbon nanostructures in molten LiCl | journal=Carbon | pages=835–845}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[graphene]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Nanoscale| year= 2015|volume = 7|pages= 11310–11320 | doi = 10.1039/c5nr01132a| title=Large-scale preparation of graphene by high temperature insertion of hydrogen into graphite|url= https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/248812/1/Kamali%20%26%20Fray%202015%20Nanoscale.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[lithium niobate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.07.085 | volume=40 | title=Preparation of lithium niobate particles via reactive molten salt synthesis method | journal=Ceramics International | pages=1835–1841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithium chloride has been shown to have strong [[acaricide|acaricidal]] properties, being effective against ''[[Varroa destructor]]'' in populations of [[honey bee]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ziegelmann|first=Bettina|last2=Abele|first2=Elisabeth|date=January 12, 2018|title=Lithium chloride effectively kills the honey bee parasite ''Varroa destructor'' by a systemic mode of action|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-19137-5.pdf|journal=[[Scientific Reports]]|publisher=Springer Nature|volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precautions==
Lithium salts affect the [[central nervous system]] in a variety of ways. While the [[lithium citrate|citrate]], [[lithium carbonate|carbonate]], and [[lithium orotate|orotate]] salts are currently used to treat [[bipolar disorder]], other [[lithium salts]] including the chloride were used in the past. For a short time in the 1940s lithium chloride was manufactured as a [[salt substitute]], but this was prohibited after the toxic effects of the compound were recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The '''Manx Electricity Authority''' ({{lang-gv|Lught-reill Lectraghys Manninagh}}) was a Statutory Board of the Isle of Man Government which generated and supplied electricity for the [[Isle of Man]]. In 2014 it became part of the Manx Utilities Authority when it was merged with the Isle of Man Water and Sewerage Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Manx Utilities Authority |url=https://www.gov.im/about-the-government/statutory-boards/manx-utilities-authority/ |website=Isle of Man Government |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generation==
Electricity generation is provided on the island from the following sources
* A 1 MW [[hydroelectric]] power plant at Sulby and Block Eary reservoir.&lt;ref name=mea&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/mea/measervicedeliveryplan201112we.pdf |title=Manx Electricity Authority Delivery plan 2012|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An 87 MW [[combined cycle gas turbine]] power station in Douglas.&lt;ref name=mea /&gt;
* A number of diesel generators at Douglas, Peel, and Ramsey, totalling 90.4 MW.&lt;ref name=mea /&gt;

In addition there is also the [[Isle of Man to England Interconnector]], an AC [[submarine power cable]] connecting the transmission system of the Isle of Man to that of Great Britain.&lt;ref name=mea /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2500">The '''maritime coast range ponderosa pine forests''' are rare temperate forest assemblages associated with a limited range portion of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]] of northern [[California]].  There are only three known small forests of this type, all situated in [[Santa Cruz County, California]]. The dominant tree species is the [[ponderosa pine]].  

==Description==
This sparse forest type thrives on very sandy Zayante [[soil]]s that are isolated pockets of decomposing [[sandstone]] from the [[Miocene]] terraces of the coastal range.  These forests are deemed to be [[relict]]s of once larger expanses found when this region was geologically even younger, and hence had more evidence of the [[sandstone]] [[erosion]] of the ancient [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]]ed [[ocean]] floor.  

One of these three forests is located atop a ridge that straddles the [[Carbonera Creek]] and [[Zayante Creek]] [[Drainage basin|watershed]]s&lt;ref&gt;USGS Quadrangle Map, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Santa Cruz County, California]] within the western slopes of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]].  

The forest in the Carbonera Creek watershed is also home to two [[endemism|endemic]] [[insect]]s whose narrow range is closely associated with the maritime coast range ponderosa pine forests.&lt;ref name=fws&gt;USFWS.

The '''GL-10 Greased Lightning''' is a hybrid [[diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] [[tiltwing]] aircraft.

==Development==
The wing has eight electric motor driven propellers while the horizontal stabilizer has two. In the future full-scale version, power will be generated by two 6&amp;nbsp;kW (8&amp;nbsp;hp) diesel engines which will charge lithium ion batteries. The propellers on the leading edge of the wing provide high speed flow, and thus lift, on the wing even in low forward velocity flight allowing pitch, roll, and yaw control authority during the critical transition phase from hover to forward flight.

The [[VTOL]] capability of this new class of [[UAV]] eliminates the requirement for additional ground support equipment like launch catapults and landing catch mechanisms. In addition, the propellers are designed for a relatively low tip speed resulting in a marked reduction in noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA's Greased Lightning Tests Vertical Takeoff But is it systematic, hydromatic, ultramatic|url=http://www.popsci.com/article/technology/nasas-greased-lightning-tests-vertical-takeoff|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/NASA-Flies-Hybrid-Electric-VTOL222636-1.html|accessdate=25 August 2014|title=NASA Flies Hybrid Electric VTOL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/aero/testing-electric-propulsion.html|accessdate=25 August 2014|title=Testing Electric Propulsion}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft is designed to complete several vertical take-off and landings during its mission with a loiter endurance of 24 hours in the forward flight mode.&lt;ref&gt;Fredericks, W.

The '''Northwest Regional Development Agency''' ('''NWDA''') was the [[regional development agency]] for the [[North West England]] region and was a [[non-departmental public body]].&lt;ref&gt;NWDA - [http://www.nwda.co.uk/who-we-are.aspx Who We Are]&lt;/ref&gt; It was abolished on 31 March 2012.

The Agency was responsible for the economic development and regeneration of the Northwest of England. As a business-led organisation, the NWDA provided a link between the needs of businesses and Government policies. As such, a major responsibility for the Agency was to help create an environment in which businesses in the region could flourish through offering business support, encouraging new start-ups, matching skills provision to employer needs and bringing business investment into the region. 

The Agency funded or managed a series of financial support products for businesses in the region. 

Geographically, the Agency covered [[Greater Manchester]] including [[Manchester]] and [[City of Salford|Salford]], [[Merseyside]] including [[Liverpool]], [[Cheshire]] and [[Warrington]], [[Cumbria]], including the [[Lake District]] and [[Lancashire]] including [[City of Preston, Lancashire|Preston]].  It operated from its main offices in Warrington, with additional offices in Liverpool, Manchester, Preston and Penrith. 

The Agency was one of the principal players in the creation of [[MediaCityUK]] in [[Salford Quays]], home for a number relocated [[BBC]] Departments, as well as a major creative and digital village in its own right. It was also playing a strong role in the development of [[The Waterfront Barrow-in-Furness]].

The NWDA was funded by central Government and responsible to the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]].

The '''Placzek transient''' is a phenomenon studied in [[nuclear engineering]]. The Placzek transient occurs when a population of monoenergetic [[neutron]]s of energy E elastically scatter within a homogeneous medium. In each collision the neutrons impart a fraction of their energy to the nuclei in the medium, losing up to a maximum of

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E_{max} = (1 - \alpha) E&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = (\frac{A-1}{A+1})^2&lt;/math&gt;

where A is the atomic number of the medium. In [[nuclear engineering]], neutrons that have not yet undergone a collision are called the 1st generation, those that have undergone a single collision are the 2nd generation, those that have undergone two collisions are the 3rd generation, and so on. The neutrons from each generation collectively form the total neutron population within the medium.

The Placzek transient is a discontinuity of the neutron flux, and derivatives of the flux, at integer multiples of &lt;math&gt;\alpha E&lt;/math&gt;. The transient results from the fact that after the 1st generation, every neutron can have at minimum an energy of &lt;math&gt;E_{min} = \alpha E&lt;/math&gt; due to elastic scattering. Those neutrons that have energy less than &lt;math&gt;E_{min}&lt;/math&gt; can only consist of neutrons in the 2nd, 3rd, or latter generations. This trend repeats itself at each multiple of &lt;math&gt;\alpha E&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the discontinuity in the flux arises from the fact that at each multiple of &lt;math&gt;\alpha E&lt;/math&gt; the neutron flux is accumulated from one fewer neutron generation to the left of the discontinuity than to the right.

The Placzek transient can be derived analytically by solving for the neutron flux using a piecewise function solution to a differential equation involving a [[Heaviside step function]] in energy intervals of width &lt;math&gt;(1-\alpha) E&lt;/math&gt;. The transient can also be observed in some special case Monte Carlo neutron transport simulation codes.

'''Polyimide''' (sometimes abbreviated '''PI''') is a [[polymer]] of [[imide]] [[monomer]]s.  Polyimides have been in [[mass production]] since 1955. With their high heat-resistance, polyimides enjoy diverse applications in roles demanding rugged organic materials, e.g. high temperature [[fuel cell]]s, displays, and various military roles.  A classic polyimide is [[Kapton]], which is produced by condensation of [[pyromellitic dianhydride]] and [[4,4'-Oxydianiline|4,4'-oxydianiline]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Wright, Walter W. and Hallden-Abberton, Michael (2002) "Polyimides" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a21_253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
According to the composition of their main chain, polyimides can be:
* [[Aliphatic]] (linear polyimides),
* Semi-aromatic,
* [[Aromaticity|Aromatic]]: these are the most used polyimides because of their [[thermostability]].  

According to the type of interactions between the main chains, polyimides can be:
* [[Thermoplastic]]: very often called ''pseudothermoplastic''.
* [[Thermoset]]ting: commercially available as uncured resins, polyimide solutions, stock shapes, thin sheets, laminates and machined parts.

==Synthesis==
Several methods are possible to prepare polyimides, among them:
* The reaction between a di[[Acid anhydride|anhydride]] and a [[diamine]] (the most used method).
* The reaction between a dianhydride and a di[[isocyanate]].
Dianhydrides used as precursors to these materials include [[pyromellitic dianhydride]], [[benzoquinonetetracarboxylic dianhydride]] and [[naphthalene tetracarboxylic dianhydride]].  Common diamine building blocks include [[4,4'-Diaminodiphenyl ether|4,4'-diaminodiphenyl ether]] ("DAPE"), [[M-Phenylenediamine|meta-phenylenediamine]] ("MDA"), and 3,3-diaminodiphenylmethane.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;  Hundreds of diamines and dianhydrides have been examined to tune the physical and especially the processing properties of these materials.  These materials tend to be insoluble and have high softening temperatures, arising from charge-transfer interactions between the planar subunits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2012.02.005|title=Advanced polyimide materials: Syntheses, physical properties and applications|journal=Progress in Polymer Science|volume=37|issue=7|pages=907–974|year=2012|last1=Liaw|first1=Der-Jang|last2=Wang|first2=Kung-Li|last3=Huang|first3=Ying-Chi|last4=Lee|first4=Kueir-Rarn|last5=Lai|first5=Juin-Yih|last6=Ha|first6=Chang-Sik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Thermosetting polyimides are known for thermal stability, good chemical resistance, excellent mechanical properties, and characteristic orange/yellow color. Polyimides compounded with [[Carbon_(fiber)|graphite]] or [[glass fiber]] reinforcements have [[flexural strength]]s of up to {{convert|50000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} and [[flexural modulus|flexural moduli]] of {{convert|3000000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}}. [[Thermoset polymer matrix]] polyimides exhibit very low [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] and high [[tensile strength]]. These properties are maintained during continuous use to temperatures of up to {{convert|232|C|F}} and for short excursions, as high as {{convert|400|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://proofresearchacd.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PROOF-ACD_data_sheet_900HT_update_10-16-15v2.pdf P2SI 900HT Tech Sheet]. proofresearchacd.com&lt;/ref&gt; Molded polyimide parts and laminates have very good heat resistance. Normal [[operating temperature]]s for such parts and laminates range from cryogenic to those exceeding {{convert|260|C|F}}. Polyimides are also inherently resistant to flame combustion and do not usually need to be mixed with [[flame retardant]]s. Most carry a [[certification listing|UL rating]] of VTM-0. Polyimide laminates have a flexural strength half life at {{convert|249|C|F}} of 400 hours.

Typical polyimide parts are not affected by commonly used solvents and oils — including hydrocarbons, esters, ethers, alcohols and [[freon]]s. They also resist weak acids but are not recommended for use in environments that contain alkalis or inorganic acids.  Some polyimides, such as CP1 and CORIN XLS, are solvent-soluble and exhibit high optical clarity.  The solubility properties lend them towards spray and low temperature cure applications.

==Applications==

=== Insulation and passivation films===
Polyimide materials are lightweight, flexible, resistant to heat and chemicals. Therefore, they are used in the electronics industry for flexible cables and as an insulating film on [[magnet wire]]. For example, in a laptop computer, the cable that connects the main logic board to the display (which must flex every time the laptop is opened or closed) is often a polyimide base with copper conductors. Examples of polyimide films include Apical, [[Kapton]], [[UPILEX]], VTEC PI, Norton TH and [[Kaptrex]].
[[Image:Poly-oxydiphenylene-pyromellitimide.svg|thumb|Structure of poly-oxydiphenylene-pyromellitimide, "Kapton".]]

Polyimide is used to coat [[optical fiber#Coatings|optical fibers]] for medical or high temperature applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1117/12.2210957|chapter=Mechanical properties of polyimide coated optical fibers at elevated temperatures|title=Optical Fibers and Sensors for Medical Diagnostics and Treatment Applications XVI|volume=9702|pages=97020Y|series=Optical Fibers and Sensors for Medical Diagnostics and Treatment Applications XVI|year=2016|last1=Huang|first1=Lei|last2=Dyer|first2=Robert S.|last3=Lago|first3=Ralph J.|last4=Stolov|first4=Andrei A.|last5=Li|first5=Jie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional use of polyimide resin is as an insulating and [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1023/A:1012802117916|year=2001|last1=Jiang|first1=Jiann-Shan|journal=Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics|volume=12|issue=11|pages=655–659|title=The effect of polyimide passivation on the electromigration of Cu multilayer interconnections|last2=Chiou|first2=Bi-Shiou}}&lt;/ref&gt; layer in the manufacture of digital semiconductor and [[MEMs|MEMS chip]]s. The polyimide layers have good mechanical elongation and tensile strength, which also helps the adhesion between the polyimide layers or between polyimide layer and deposited metal layer. The minimum interaction between the gold film and the polyimide film, coupled with high temperature stability of the polyimide film, results in a system that provides reliable insulation when subjected to various types of environmental stresses.&lt;ref&gt;Krakauer, David (December 2006) [http://www.analog.com/library/analogdialogue/archives/40-12/iso_power.html Digital Isolation Offers Compact, Low-Cost Solutions to Challenging Design Problems]. analog.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Baoxing. [http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/overviews/isoPower.pdf iCoupler Products with isoPower Technology: Signal and Power Transfer Across Isolation Barrier Using Microtransformers]. analog.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Multi-layer insulation used on [[spacecraft]] is usually made of polyimide coated with thin layers of [[aluminum]]. The gold-like material often seen on the outside of spacecraft is actually single aluminized polyimide, with the single layer of aluminum facing in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thermal Control Overview|url=http://www.sheldahl.com/Documents/Aerospace/Thermal%20Control%20Overview.pdf|website=Sheldahl Multi Layer Insulation|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The yellowish-brown polyimide gives the surface its gold-like color.

=== Mechanical parts ===
Polyimide powder can be used to produce parts and shapes by sintering technologies ([[hot compression molding]], [[direct forming]], and [[isostatic pressing]]). Because of their high mechanical stability even at elevated temperatures they are used as bushings, bearings, sockets or constructive parts in demanding applications. To improve [[tribological]] properties, compounds with solid lubricants like [[graphite]], [[PTFE]], or [[molybdenum sulfide]] are common. Polyimide parts and shapes include P84 NT, VTEC PI, Meldin, [[Vespel]], and [[Meldin|Plavis]].

=== Filters ===
In coal-fired power plants, waste incinerators, or cement plants, polyimide fibres are used to filter hot gases. In this application, a polyimide needle felt separates dust and particulate matter from the [[exhaust gas]].

Polyimide is also the most common material used for the reverse osmotic film in purification of water, or the concentration of dilute materials from water, such as maple syrup production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisegeek.net/what-is-a-reverse-osmosis-water-softener.htm What is a reverse osmosis water softener?] wisegeek.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shuey, Harry F. and Wan, Wankei (1983-12-22) {{US Patent|4532041}} Asymmetric polyimide reverse osmosis membrane, method for preparation of same and use thereof for organic liquid separations.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other ===
Polyimide is used for medical tubing, e.g. vascular [[catheters]], for its burst pressure resistance combined with flexibility and chemical resistance.

The semiconductor industry uses polyimide as a high-temperature [[adhesive]]; it is also used as a mechanical stress buffer. 

Some polyimide can be used like a [[photoresist]]; both "positive" and "negative" types of photoresist-like polyimide exist in the market.

The [[IKAROS]] [[solar sailing]] spacecraft uses polyimide resin sails to operate without rocket engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Courtland |first = Rachel |publisher = The New Scientist | title = Maiden voyage for first true space sail |date = 10 May 2010 |url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20627603.800-maiden-voyage-for-first-true-space-sail.html | accessdate = 11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soil gases''' are the gases found in the air space between [[soil]] components. The primary soil gases include [[nitrogen]], [[carbon dioxide]] and [[oxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierzynski, Gary M., and J. T. Sims. ''Soils and Environmental Quality''. Boca Raton: Lewis, 1994. 72. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The oxygen is critical because it allows for [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] of both plant [[root]]s and soil organisms. Other natural soil gases are [[atmospheric methane]] and [[radon]]. Some environmental contaminants below ground produce gas which diffuses through the soil such as from landfill wastes, mining activities, and contamination by petroleum [[hydrocarbon]]s which produce [[volatile organic compound]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Nathanail, Judith, and Paul Bardos. ''Contaminated Land Management: Ready Reference''. Nottingham: Land Quality :, 2002. 44. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Soil gases can diffuse into buildings, the chief concerns among these pollutants are radon which is radioactive and causes cancer and methane which can be flammable at only 4.4% concentration.

Gases fill [[soil pore]]s in the [[soil structure]] as water drains or is removed from a soil pore by evaporation or root absorption. The network of pores within the soil aerates, or ventilates, the soil. This aeration network becomes blocked when water enters soil pores. Not only are both soil air and soil water very dynamic parts of soil, but both are often inversely related.

Composition of [[air]] in soil and [[atmosphere]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last2 = Appleyard| first2 = A. .| last1 = Russell| first1 = E. J. | title = The Atmosphere of the Soil: Its Composition and the Causes of Variation | journal = The Journal of Agricultural Science | pages = 1 | year = 1915 | doi = 10.1017/S0021859600002410 | volume = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Nitrogen:        Soil Air: 79.2% Atmosphere: 79.0%
*Oxygen:          Soil Air: 20.6% Atmosphere: 20.9%
*Carbon Dioxide:  Soil Air: 0.25% Atmosphere: 0.04%

Gas molecules in soil are in continuous thermal motion according to the [[kinetic theory of gases]], there is also collision between molecules - a [[random walk]].

In soil, a concentration gradient causes net movement of molecules from high concentration to low concentration, this gives the movement of gas by [[diffusion]]. Numerically, it is explained by [[Fick's law of diffusion]].

'''Source London''' is a network of [[electric vehicle]] [[Charging station|charging points]] in London. It is owned by [[Bolloré|IER]].

Charging points are located in residential streets, public car parks, at supermarkets, shopping centres and similar places. Use of a Source London branded charging point requires registration with the network's website and the payment of an annual fee of £48 per vehicle.  Users are required to pay the annual subscription (also payable in monthly instalments of £4/month) along with 3.6p/min for each charging session on their modern chargers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sourcelondon.net/membership|accessdate=9 April 2013 |title=Source London web site, Membership details}}&lt;/ref&gt; Registered members are issued with a card that is swiped on the charging point's card reader to permit charging an unlimited number of times.&lt;ref name="TfL"/&gt;

==Backing and funding==

First announced in November 2010 and launched on 27 May 2011 by [[London Mayor]] [[Boris Johnson]], it is the first citywide network in London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/17307.aspx |title=Mayor's electric vehicle charging network, Source London, to go live in spring 2011 |publisher=[[Transport for London]] |date=6 November 2010 |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sourcelondon.net/mayor-switches-new-electric-vehicle-scheme-source-london |title=Mayor switches on new electric vehicle scheme - Source London |publisher=Source London |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and initially provides 150 charging points across the capital with plans to expand coverage to 1,300 charging points by 2013.&lt;ref name="TfL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/20094.aspx |title=Mayor switches on new electric vehicle scheme &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;Source London&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;  |publisher=[[Transport for London]] |date=27 May 2011 |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Source London was originally a [[Transport for London]]-led consortium of public and private sector organizations. The IT infrastructure was developed by [[Siemens]] and the network is partly funded by [[Scottish and Southern Energy]] and [[National Car Parks]]. Other organisations involved include [[Heathrow Airport]], [[Gatwick Airport]], [[Asda]], [[Capital Shopping Centres]], [[Sainsbury's]], [[IKEA]], [[Whittington Hospital]], [[Enterprise Rent-a-Car]] and [[London Underground]].&lt;ref name="TfL"/&gt; The [[Department for Transport]] provided £9.3 million 50% match funding for the development of the network's infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sourcelondon.net/greater-london-authority-group |title=Greater London Authority Group |publisher=Source London |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subscription fee for the scheme was originally an annual flat-rate £10 per vehicle, with no per-charge fees.

IER have taken over the management of the Source London charging network from [[Transport for London]], since 1 September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sourcelondon.net/ |title=Source London website|accessdate=17 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the actual charge points are still owned by the boroughs and business owners, and it is still their responsibility to fix faults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SourceLondon_UK/status/525625507527000064 |title= Twitter status update after IER takeover|accessdate=17 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion of the network will be achieved, in part, by integrating existing charging points previously operated independently by [[London Borough]] councils. At launch, 11 boroughs had installed or were planning to install Source London charging points, or were intending to upgrade their own charging points for integration into the network. Ten other boroughs had committed to the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sourcelondon.net/london-local-authorities |title=London Local Authorities |publisher=Source London |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sourcelondon.net/source-london |title=The charge point network for London |publisher=Source London |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Source London is working with the Department for Transport's Office for Low Emission Vehicles and cities in the UK with the aim of developing a national charging point network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sourcelondon.net/plan-london |title=A plan for London |publisher=Source London |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maintenance==

In 2014 it was reported that Source London's network, formed by taking on operational responsibility for various borough's chargepoints, had problems with chargepoints being out of action.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/green-motoring/11184799/Londons-electric-car-infrastructure-falling-into-ruin.html "London's electric car infrastructure falling into ruin", ''The Telegraph'', 24 October 2014]. Accessed 15 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Source London says it has been working with individual boroughs to take full ownership and responsibility of the existing charging infrastructure, and has so far agreed with London Boroughs of Barnet, Brent, Bromley, Camden, Greenwich, Hackney, Hammersmith and Fulham, Hounslow, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Merton, Richmond, Southwark, Sutton, Wandsworth, Westminster, and with TfL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zap-map.com/bluepointlondon-to-manage-charging-points-in-kensington-and-chelsea-hackney-and-greenwich/ |title=BluePointLondon to manage charging points in Kensington and Chelsea, Hackney and Greenwich|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenfleet.net/news/19012017/wandsworth-council-presses-ahead-ev-charging-infrstructure |title=Wandsworth Council presses ahead with EV charging infrastructure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]], a '''spherical pendulum''' is a higher dimensional analogue of the [[pendulum]]. It consists of a [[mass]] ''m'' moving without [[friction]] on the surface of a [[sphere]]. The only [[force]]s acting on the mass are the [[reaction (physics)|reaction]] from the sphere and [[gravity]].

Owing to the spherical geometry of the problem, [[spherical coordinates]] are used to describe the position of the mass in terms of (''r'', ''θ'', ''φ''), where ''r'' is fixed. In what follows ''l'' is the constant length of the pendulum, so ''r'' = ''l''.

\right)

&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Euler–Lagrange equations]] give :

\right)
-mr^2\sin\theta\cos\theta\dot{\phi}^2+

\frac{d}{dt}

\right)
=0
&lt;/math&gt;
showing that [[angular momentum]] is conserved.

==Hamiltonian mechanics==

{{main|Hamiltonian mechanics}}

The Hamiltonian is

:&lt;math&gt;H=P_\theta\dot \theta + P_\phi\dot \phi-L&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;P_\theta=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot \theta}=mr^2\dot \theta&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;P_\phi=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot \phi} = mr^2\dot \phi \sin^2 \theta&lt;/math&gt;

Established by the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]], '''Standard Market Design''' is a set of established guidelines governing the sale of [[Electric_power|electrical power]]  and the operations of [[Electric_power_transmission|electrical transmission lines]] in the [[United States of America]].

The objective of standard market design for wholesale electric markets is to establish a common market framework that promotes economic efficiency and lower delivered energy costs, maintains power system reliability, mitigates significant market power and increases the choices offered to wholesale market participants. All customers should benefit from an efficient competitive wholesale energy market, whether or not they are in states that have elected to adopt retail access.

An example of this is the [[manger]] near the [[Uffington White Horse]]. It may also be described as a small, irregular step-like formation on steep hillslopes, especially on those used for pasture which are formed by [[soil creep]] or erosion of surface soils  exacerbated by the trampling of [[livestock]] such as sheep or cattle. Synonyms (not preferred){{by whom|date=March 2016}} are: catstep, cattle terracing, sheep or cattle track. 

Early investigators believed that animals grazing the hillsides caused them, but further examination revealed places where terracettes abruptly ended at steep rock faces or at soils of different composition.  Other sites show livestock trails cutting across terracettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/rangelands/article/viewFile/11662/10935|title=What Caused Those Terracettes?|last=Buckhouse|first=John C|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The conclusion is that although animals may accentuate them, they are not the cause.

A '''torsion spring''' is a [[spring (device)|spring]] that works by [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] or twisting; that is, a flexible [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] object that stores [[mechanical energy]] when it is twisted.  When it is twisted, it exerts a force (actually [[torque]]) in the opposite direction, proportional to the amount (angle) it is twisted.  There are various types.  For example, clocks use a spiral wound torsion spring sometimes called a "clock spring" or colloquially called a [[mainspring]]. Those types of torsion springs are also used for attic stairs, clutches, and other devices that need near constant torque for large angles or even multiple revolutions.

A '''torsion bar''' is a straight bar of metal or rubber that is subjected to twisting ([[shear stress]]) about its axis by torque applied at its ends.  A more delicate form used in sensitive instruments, called a '''torsion fiber''' consists of a [[fiber]] of silk, glass, or [[Fused quartz|quartz]] under tension, that is twisted about its axis.  The other type, a '''helical torsion spring''', is a metal rod or wire in the shape of a [[helix]] (coil) that is subjected to twisting about the axis of the coil by sideways forces ([[bending moment]]s) applied to its ends, twisting the coil tighter.  This terminology can be confusing because in a helical torsion spring the forces acting on the wire are actually bending stresses, not [[Deformation (mechanics)|torsional]] (shear) stresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Torsion coefficient==
As long as they are not twisted beyond their [[elastic limit]], torsion springs obey an angular form of [[Hooke's law]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \tau = -\kappa\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tau\,&lt;/math&gt; is the torque exerted by the spring in [[newton (unit)|newton]]-meters, and &lt;math&gt;\theta\,&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of twist from its equilibrium  position in [[radian]]s.  &lt;math&gt;\kappa\,&lt;/math&gt; is a constant with units of newton-meters / radian, variously called the spring's '''torsion coefficient''', '''torsion elastic modulus''', '''rate''', or just '''spring constant''', equal to the change in torque required to twist the spring through an angle of 1 radian.  It is analogous to the spring constant of a linear spring.  The negative sign indicates that the direction of the torque is opposite to the direction of twist.

The energy ''U'', in [[joule]]s, stored in a torsion spring is:

:&lt;math&gt; U = \frac{1}{2}\kappa\theta^2&lt;/math&gt;

==Uses==
Some familiar examples of uses are the strong, helical torsion springs that operate [[clothespin]]s and traditional spring-loaded-bar type [[mousetrap]]s.   Other uses are in the large, coiled torsion springs used to counterbalance the weight of [[garage door]]s, and a similar system is used to assist in opening the [[decklid|trunk (boot) cover]] on some [[sedan (car)|sedan]]s.  Small, coiled torsion springs are often used to operate pop-up doors found on small consumer goods like [[digital camera]]s and [[compact disc]] players.  Other more specific uses:

*A ''[[torsion bar suspension]]'' is a thick, steel torsion-bar spring attached to the body of a vehicle at one end and to a lever arm which attaches to the axle of the wheel at the other.   It absorbs road shocks as the wheel goes over bumps and rough road surfaces, cushioning the ride for the passengers.  Torsion-bar suspensions are used in many modern cars and trucks, as well as military vehicles.
*The ''[[sway bar]]'' used in many [[Suspension (vehicle)|vehicle suspension]] systems also uses the torsion spring principle.
*The ''torsion pendulum'' used in [[torsion pendulum clock]]s is a wheel-shaped weight suspended from its center by a wire torsion spring.  The weight rotates about the axis of the spring, twisting it, instead of swinging like an ordinary [[pendulum]]. The force of the spring reverses the direction of rotation, so the wheel oscillates back and forth, driven at the top by the clock's gears.
*Torsion springs consisting of twisted ropes or [[sinew]], were used to store [[potential energy]] to power several types of ancient weapons; including the Greek [[ballista]] and the Roman [[Scorpio (weapon)|scorpio]] and catapults like the [[Onager (weapon)|onager]].
*The ''[[balance spring]]'' or hairspring in mechanical [[watch]]es is a fine, spiral-shaped torsion spring that pushes the [[balance wheel]] back toward its center position as it rotates back and forth.  The balance wheel and spring function similarly to the torsion pendulum above in keeping time for the watch.
*The ''[[D'Arsonval movement]]'' used in mechanical pointer-type meters to measure electric current is a type of torsion balance (see below).  A coil of wire attached to the pointer twists in a magnetic field against the resistance of a torsion spring.  Hooke's law ensures that the angle of the pointer is proportional to the current.
*A ''DMD'' or [[digital micromirror device]] chip is at the heart of many [[video projectors]].  It uses hundreds of thousands of tiny mirrors on tiny torsion springs fabricated on a silicon surface to reflect light onto the screen, forming the image.

==Torsion balance==
[[File:Bcoulomb.png|thumb|right|Drawing of Coulomb's torsion balance. From Plate 13 of his 1785 memoir.]]
[[File:ConstantOfGravitation 003.jpg|thumb|Torsion balance used by [[Paul R. Heyl]] in his measurements of the gravitational constant G at the U.S. [[NIST|National Bureau of Standards]] (now NIST) between 1930 and 1942.]]

The '''torsion balance''', also called '''torsion pendulum''', is a scientific apparatus for measuring very weak forces, usually credited to [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]], who invented it in 1777, but independently invented by [[John Michell]] sometime before 1783.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=McCormmach|first1=R.|last2=Jungnickel|first2=C.|title=Cavendish|year=1996|publisher=American Philosophical Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUoLAAAAIAAJ|isbn=0-87169-220-1|pages=335–344}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its most well-known uses were by Coulomb to measure the [[electrostatic force]] between charges to establish [[Coulomb's Law]], and by [[Henry Cavendish]] in 1798 in the [[Cavendish experiment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cavendish|first=H.|year=1798|chapter=Experiments to determine the Density of the Earth|editor-last=MacKenzie|editor-first=A.S.|publication-date=1900|title=Scientific Memoirs, Vol.9: The Laws of Gravitation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O58mAAAAMAAJ|publisher=American Book Co.|pages=59–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; to measure the gravitational force between two masses to calculate the density of the Earth, leading later to a value for the [[gravitational constant]].

The torsion balance consists of a bar suspended from its middle by a thin fiber.  The fiber acts as a very weak torsion spring.  If an unknown force is applied at right angles to the ends of the bar, the bar will rotate, twisting the fiber, until it reaches an equilibrium where the twisting force or torque of the fiber balances the applied force.  Then the magnitude of the force is proportional to the angle of the bar.  The sensitivity of the instrument comes from the weak spring constant of the fiber, so a very weak force causes a large rotation of the bar.

In Coulomb's experiment, the torsion balance was an insulating rod with a metal-coated ball attached to one end, suspended by a silk thread.  The ball was charged with a known charge of static electricity, and a second charged ball of the same polarity was brought near it.  The two charged balls repelled one another, twisting the fiber through a certain angle, which could be read from a scale on the instrument.  By knowing how much force it took to twist the fiber through a given angle, Coulomb was able to calculate the force between the balls.  Determining the force for different charges and different separations between the balls, he showed that it followed an inverse-square proportionality law, now known as [[Coulomb's law]].

To measure the unknown force, the [[Torsion spring#Torsion coefficient|spring constant]] of the torsion fiber must first be known.  This is difficult to measure directly because of the smallness of the force.  Cavendish accomplished this by a method widely used since: measuring the [[Resonance|resonant vibration period]] of the balance.  If the free balance is twisted and released, it will oscillate slowly clockwise and counterclockwise as a [[harmonic oscillator]], at a frequency that depends on the moment of inertia of the beam and the elasticity of the fiber.  Since the inertia of the beam can be found from its mass, the spring constant can be calculated.

Coulomb first developed the theory of torsion fibers and the torsion balance in his 1785 memoir, ''Recherches theoriques et experimentales sur la force de torsion et sur l'elasticite des fils de metal &amp;c''.  This led to its use in other scientific instruments, such as [[galvanometer]]s, and the [[Nichols radiometer]] which measured the [[radiation pressure]] of light.  In the early 1900s gravitational torsion balances were used in petroleum prospecting.  Today torsion balances are still used in physics experiments.  In 1987, gravity researcher A.H. Cook wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The most important advance in experiments on gravitation and other delicate measurements was the introduction of the torsion balance by Michell and its use by Cavendish.  It has been the basis of all the most significant experiments on gravitation ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cook|first=A.H.|chapter=Experiments in Gravitation|editor-last=Hawking|editor-first=S.W. and Israel, W.|title=Three Hundred Years of Gravitation|publication-date=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-34312-7|page=52|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Torsion balances, torsion pendulums and balance wheels are examples of torsional harmonic oscillators that can oscillate with a rotational motion about the axis of the torsion spring, clockwise and counterclockwise, in [[Simple harmonic motion|harmonic motion]].  Their behavior is analogous to translational spring-mass oscillators (see [[Harmonic oscillator#Equivalent systems]]).  The general equation of motion is:

:&lt;math&gt;I\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + C\frac{d\theta}{dt} + \kappa\theta = \tau(t)&lt;/math&gt;

If the damping is small, &lt;math&gt;C \ll \sqrt{\frac{\kappa}{I}}\,&lt;/math&gt;, as is the case with torsion pendulums and balance wheels, the frequency of vibration is very near the [[Mechanical resonance|natural resonant frequency]] of the system:

:&lt;math&gt;f_n = \frac{\omega_n}{2\pi} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{\kappa}{I}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the period is represented by:

:&lt;math&gt;T_n = \frac{1}{f_n} = \frac{2\pi}{\omega_n} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{I}{\kappa}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The general solution in the case of no drive force (&lt;math&gt;\tau = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;), called the transient solution, is:

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = Ae^{-\alpha t} \cos{(\omega t + \phi)}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where:

::&lt;math&gt;\alpha = C/2I\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\omega_n^2 - \alpha^2} =  \sqrt{\kappa/I - (C/2I)^2}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The balance wheel of a mechanical watch is a harmonic oscillator whose resonant frequency &lt;math&gt;f_n\,&lt;/math&gt; sets the rate of the watch. The resonant frequency is regulated, first coarsely by adjusting &lt;math&gt;I\,&lt;/math&gt; with weight screws set radially into the rim of the wheel, and then more finely by adjusting &lt;math&gt;\kappa\,&lt;/math&gt; with a regulating lever that changes the length of the balance spring.

In a torsion balance the drive torque is constant and equal to the unknown force to be measured &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt;, times the moment arm of the balance beam &lt;math&gt;L\,&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\tau(t) = FL\,&lt;/math&gt;.  When the oscillatory motion of the balance dies out, the deflection will be proportional to the force:

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = FL/\kappa\,&lt;/math&gt;

To determine &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; it is necessary to find the torsion spring constant &lt;math&gt;\kappa\,&lt;/math&gt;.  If the damping is low, this can be obtained by measuring the natural resonant frequency of the balance, since the moment of inertia of the balance can usually be calculated from its geometry, so:

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa = (2\pi f_n)^2 I\,&lt;/math&gt;

In measuring instruments, such as the D'Arsonval ammeter movement, it is often desired that the oscillatory motion die out quickly so the steady state result can be read off.  This is accomplished by adding damping to the system, often by attaching a vane that rotates in a fluid such as air or water (this is why magnetic compasses are filled with fluid).  The value of damping that causes the oscillatory motion to settle quickest is called the [[Damping|critical damping]] &lt;math&gt;C_c\,&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;C_c = 2 \sqrt{\kappa I}\,&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Ben At His Desk turtle wax.jpg|thumb|180px|Benjamin Hirsch]]
'''Turtle Wax''' is a manufacturer of automotive appearance products. The company was founded by Benjamin Hirsch in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] in 1941&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Turtle-Wax-Inc-Company-History.html|title=Turtle Wax, Inc. - Company History|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently headquartered in [[Addison, Illinois]], having relocated from [[Willowbrook, DuPage County, Illinois|Willowbrook, Illinois]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160510/business/160519920/ "Turtle Wax to relocate headquarters to Addison"], ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]'', May 10, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirsch's main product, a liquid car wax, was initially called Plastone, until Hirsch changed the product name to create the association with a turtle's hard shell. Hirsch died in 1966 and successive generations of his family have remained involved with the company.&lt;ref name="Randle"&gt;Wilma Randle, [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-04-11/business/9304110235_1_car-wax-hirsch-family-gas-stations "Strong Family Histories Help Turtle Wax Shine"], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', April 11, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ted Pincus, [https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1618495.html "Turtle Wax going like 60 to make prospects shine"], ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', May 2, 2006 {{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its advertising jingle ("Turtle Wax gives that hard shell finish"), created early in its history by the [[Doner Company]], became very well known.&lt;ref name="McDonoughEgolf2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John McDonough|author2=Karen Egolf|title=The Advertising Age Encyclopedia of Advertising|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QpLtCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT979|date=18 June 2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-135-94913-6|page=979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Section cartouche combustible UNGG Bugey.png|thumb|right|Cross section of UNGG fuel, showing internal cooling path]]
The '''UNGG''' (''Uranium Naturel Graphite Gaz'') is an obsolete [[nuclear power reactor]] design developed by France. It was [[graphite]] [[neutron moderator|moderated]], cooled by [[carbon dioxide]], and fueled with [[natural uranium]] metal. The first generation of French nuclear power stations were UNGGs, as was [[Vandellos]] unit 1 in Spain. Of ten units built, all were shut down by end 1994, most for economic reasons due to staffing costs.

The UNGG and the [[Magnox]] are the two main types of [[gas cooled reactor]] (GCR). A UNGG reactor is often referred to simply as a ''GCR'' in English documents, or sometimes loosely as a ''Magnox''. It was developed independently of and in parallel to the British Magnox design, and to meet similar requirements. The first UNGG reactors at [[Marcoule]] used horizontal fuel channels and a concrete containment structure. [[Chinon Nuclear Power Plant|Chinon]] A1 used vertical fuel channels, as did the British Magnox reactors, and a steel pressure-vessel.&lt;ref name=UKAEA-10years/&gt;

The fuel cladding material was [[magnesium]]-[[zirconium]] alloy in the UNGG, as opposed to [[Magnox (alloy)|magnesium-aluminium]] in Magnox. As both claddings react with water, they can be stored in a [[spent fuel pool]] for short times only, making short-term [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] of the fuel essential, and requiring heavily shielded facilities for this.

The programme was a succession of units, with changes to the design increasing power output. In the experimental phase they were built by the [[Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique]] (CEA), and later by [[Électricité de France]] (EDF).&lt;ref name=UKAEA-10years&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/publications/magazines/bulletin/bull6-3/06304701725.pdf |title=Ten Years of Nuclear Power |publisher=UKAEA |year=1966 |accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest UNGG reactor build was Bugey 1 with a net electrical output of 540 MW.

==Units==
* G1, G2 and G3 at [[Marcoule]]. G1 was the first UNGG to go critical, in 1956.
* [[Chinon Nuclear Power Plant]] A1, A2, and A3 in [[Indre-et-Loire]].
* [[Saint-Laurent Nuclear Power Plant]] A1 and A2 in [[Loir-et-Cher]], operated from 1969 and 1971 to April 1990 and June 1992.
* Reactor 1 at [[Bugey Nuclear Power Plant]] in [[Ain]], the last UNGG built in France, first criticality 1972, closed May 1994.
* [[Vandellòs Nuclear Power Plant]] Unit 1 in Spain, the only UNGG built outside France, closed July 1990.

The earlier units, at Chinon and Marcoule, had heat exchangers outside the main pressure vessel; Later units (Saint-Laurent, Bugey and Vandellos) moved these heat exchangers to inside the pressure vessel.

'''The Westminster Stone theory''' refers to the belief held by some historians and scholars that the stone which traditionally rests under the [[King Edward's Chair|Coronation Chair]] is not the true [[Stone of Scone|Stone of Destiny]] but a 13th-century substitute.  Since the chair has been located in [[Westminster Abbey]] since that time, adherents to this theory have created the title 'Westminster Stone' to avoid confusion with the 'real' stone (sometimes referred to as the [[Stone of Scone]]).

One of the most vocal proponents of this theory was writer and historian [[Nigel Tranter]], who consistently presented the theory throughout his [[non-fiction]] books and [[historical novels]].  Other historians have held this view, including [[James S. Richardson]], who was an [[Inspector of Ancient Monuments]] in the mid-twentieth century.  Richardson produced a monograph on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ray Bradfield|Bradfield, Ray]], ''Nigel Tranter: Scotland's Storyteller'', p 121&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Stone of Destiny==
{{Main|Stone of Scone}}

The Stone of Destiny was the traditional Coronation Stone of the Kings of Scotland and, before that, the Kings of Dalriada.  Legends associate it with [[Columba|Saint Columba]], who might have brought it from Ireland as a portable altar.&lt;ref&gt;Tranter, Nigel, ''The Story of Scotland'', p 11&lt;/ref&gt;  In AD 574, the Stone was used as a coronation chair when Columba anointed and crowned [[Aedan]] King of Dalriada.

The Stone of Destiny was kept by the monks of [[Iona]], the traditional headquarters of the Scottish Celtic church, until Viking raiding caused them to move to the mainland, first to [[Dunkeld]], [[Atholl]], and then to [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]].  Here it continued to be used in coronations, as a symbol of Scottish Kingship.

==Edward I and the Stone==
In his attempts to [[First War of Scottish Independence|conquer Scotland]], [[Edward I of England]] invaded in 1296 at the head of an army.  Sacking [[Berwick-Upon-Tweed|Berwick]], beating the Scots at [[Battle of Dunbar (1296)|Dunbar]], and laying siege to [[Edinburgh Castle]], Edward then proceeded to [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]], intending to take the Stone of Destiny, which was kept at [[Scone Abbey]]. He had already taken the [[Scottish regalia]] from Edinburgh, which included [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Saint Margaret's]] [[Black Rood]] relic, but to confiscate an object so  precious to the Scots, and so symbolic of their independence, would be a final humiliation.  He carried it back to [[Westminster Abbey]].  By placing it within the throne of [[England]], he had a potent symbol of his claim for overlordship.  It is this stone which sat in Westminster until 1996, when it was returned to Scotland.

==The Substitution==
According to the Westminster Stone theory, the stone Edward removed was not the real Stone of Destiny, but a substitute.  The English army was at the Scottish border in mid-March, 1296, and did not reach Scone until June.  With three months to anticipate Edward's arrival, there was ample time and incentive for a switch to be made, in order to protect the original relic.  Such a substitution could have been instigated by the [[Abbot of Scone]], who stood as custodian. The 'Stone of Destiny' could therefore have been transported to a place of safety, and Edward fobbed off with a different piece of sandstone.

===Hiding the 'True Stone'===
There are many theories regarding the possible resting place of the 'True Stone' since, inspired by logical deduction and, in some cases, fantastical, wishful thinking.

[[Nigel Tranter]] believed the True Stone was originally hidden by the Abbot of Scone, and eventually entrusted to the care of [[Aonghus Óg Mac Domhnaill]], by [[Robert the Bruce]].  Aonghus Óg hid it in his native [[Hebrides]], where the stone probably remains.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tranter, Nigel]], ''[[Nigel Tranter#Non-fiction books|The Story of Scotland]]'', [[Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul]], 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

One legend records that after the True Stone was given into the keeping of Aonghus Óg, its keepership passed into the branch of the clan who settled in [[Sleat]].  A descendant of this line, C. Iain Alasdair MacDonald, wrote to Tranter, claiming he was now the custodian of the Stone, which was hidden on [[Isle of Skye|Skye]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradfield, Ray, ''Nigel Tranter: Scotland's Storyteller'', p 130&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that the stone was hidden by monks in the [[River Tay]].  One rumour claims that the stone is held by the [[Knights Templar]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} However, this rumour might apply to the [[#A second theory: the 1950 substitution|'1950 substitution']].

==Evidence==

===Arguments for a substitution===
*The Westminster Stone is a lump of roughly-dressed sandstone, of proportions appropriate for use in building. As such, it is not remarkable or unique, or impressive. The only unusual thing about it is the presence of an iron hoop inserted in each top end, suitable for carrying on a pole.
*Edward I would not have been fobbed off by anything newly-hewn, but a piece long-since rejected by builders would look suitably ancient, especially if abandoned outside and consequently weathered.  That the Westminster Stone has a fault (weak point) is demonstrated by the fact it broke in half when removed from Westminster Abbey in 1950.
*The Westminster Stone is certainly not the stone of Iona mentioned in early documents and traditions. Geologists confirm that the Stone is 'lower [[Old Red Sandstone]]' and was quarried in the vicinity of Scone.&lt;ref name=Prebble&gt;[[John Prebble|Prebble, John]], ''The Lion in the North''&lt;/ref&gt;
*Early seals and documentary descriptions suggest a stone that is larger than the Westminster Stone, darker in colour (possibly basalt or marble), with elaborate carvings.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} And it might have been retrieved because a letter to the editor of the ''Morning Chronicle'', dated 2 January 1819, states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''On the 19th of November, as the servants belonging to the West Mains of Dunsinane-house, were employed in carrying away stones from the excavation made among the ruins that point out the site of Macbeth's castle here, part of the ground they stood on suddenly gave way, and sank down about six feet, discovering a regularly built vault, about six feet long and four wide. None of the men being injured, curiosity induced them to clear out the subterranean recess, when they discovered among the ruins a large stone, weighing about 500l [{{convert|500|lb|disp=output only}}]. which is pronounced to be of the meteoric or semi-metallic kind. This stone must have lain here during the long series of ages since Macbeth's reign. Besides it were also found two round tablets, of a composition resembling bronze. On one of these two lines are engraved, which a gentleman has thus deciphered.— 'The sconce (or shadow) of kingdom come, until Sylphs in air carry me again to Bethel.'  These plates exhibit the figures of targets for the arms. [...] The curious here, aware of such traditions, and who have viewed these venerable remains of antiquity, agree that Macbeth may, or rather must, have deposited the stone in question at the bottom of his Castle, on the hill of Dunsinane (from the trouble of the times), where it has been found by the workmen. This curious stone has been shipped for London for the inspection of the scientific amateur, in order to discover its real quality.''&lt;ref name="The"&gt;{{cite web|title=The stone of Destiny|url=http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/stone_scone.html|website=English Monarchs|publisher=www.englishmonarcs.co.uk|accessdate=30 August 2014|year=2004–2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*There is no record to show the Scots ever requested the return of the Westminster Stone in the century after its departure, which they would have done if it were an important relic. The absence of a request is quite marked in the [[Treaty of Northampton]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;!---The article on [[Stone of Scone]] makes the contrary claim, equally without source, that the Treaty actually contained and English promise to return the stone, which however was never fulfilled.---&gt;  The Scots had been harrying England for some years, and in 1328 the English sued for peace.  The Treaty is drawn in Scotland's favour, for they were in the position to make demands. The Treaty stipulates the return of the [[Scottish regalia]] and St Margaret's [[Holyrood (cross)|Black Rood]], but there is no mention of the Stone of Scone.&lt;ref name=Prebble/&gt; Tranter states that the English offered to return the stone, but the Scots were not interested.&lt;ref&gt;Tranter, Nigel, ''The Story of Scotland'', p 77&lt;/ref&gt;
*Reports of the coronation of [[Robert the Bruce]] in 1306 record that it was done according to the full tradition, which may have required the true Stone.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Arguments against a substitution===
The Westminster Stone theory is not accepted by many historians, or those responsible for the care of the Stone.  There are many strong arguments against the theory.

*If Edward I did not remove the true stone, yet claimed to have done so, the Scots' easiest refutation of his claims would be to produce the True Stone.  However, there is no record of them doing so.
*Hiding the stone might have been a sensible precaution while the English remained a threat, but it was never produced once the threat was removed.
*Despite its importance as a symbol of Kingship, the stone was not used for subsequent coronations, which it surely would have if still in Scottish possession.
*Legends and theories abound, but no proof has been found to indicate there is another stone.
*If there was warning enough of Edward's intention to remove the Stone, why were the other regalia, documents and Black Rood not hidden also?
*A number of English knights attended the coronation of King [[John of Scotland]] only a few years earlier, and would have seen the true stone, but none of them told Edward that his stone was a fake.
*On studying the Stone in 1996, after its return to Scotland, nine periods of workmanship were identified on the Stone's faces, as well as recognisable erosion between the features, which proves it is an ancient artefact.&lt;ref name=Welander&gt;''The Stone of Destiny: Artefact and Icon'' (Society of Antiquaries of Scotland Monograph) Richard Welander, David J. Breeze, Thomas Owen Clancy&lt;/ref&gt;
*Edward had followers from the Scottish nobility who would also have been able to verify the stone's authenticity.
&lt;!--*As a clause of the [[Treaty of Northampton]], it was agreed that the stone would be returned to Scotland. When Edward's men moved to take the stone from the Abbey, riotous crowds in London prevented its removal.&lt;ref&gt;'Bannockburn: 1314', Chris Brown&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

==A second theory: the 1950 substitution==

On Christmas Day 1950, the Westminster Stone was taken from the abbey by four Scottish students.  It remained hidden until April 1951, when a stone was left in [[Arbroath Abbey]]. Some speculate that this stone is not the one taken from the Abbey, but merely a copy.

The stone left in Arbroath was damaged, for the Westminster Stone had broken in half when removed from the Coronation Chair, but had been repaired by [[Glasgow]] stonemason Robert Gray.  However, Gray had made replicas of the Stone in the 1930s, and further fuelled speculation by declaring later that he did not know which stone had been sent back to London as "there were so many copies lying around".&lt;ref name="Bradfield, Ray p 122"&gt;Bradfield, Ray, ''Nigel Tranter: Scotland's Storyteller'', p 122&lt;/ref&gt;

This scenario receives support from a plaque placed in St Columba's Parish Church in [[Dundee]], which claims to mark the site of the 'Stone of Scone', given to them in 1972 by 'Baillie Robert Gray'.

The apparent disrespect shown towards the Stone by Gray and the students is explained by [[Nigel Tranter]], who had some claim to knowledge, as the students asked him to act as an intermediary after the removal of the stone.  Tranter later stated that Gray inserted a note inside the Westminster Stone, when repairing it, to the effect that it was 'a block of Old Red Sandstone of no value to anyone',&lt;ref name="Bradfield, Ray p 122"/&gt; although other reports state that Gray never revealed what the note said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/gavin-vernon-engineer-who-helped-return-the-stone-of-destiny-to-scotland-1.89326 |title=Gavin Vernon Engineer who helped return the Stone of Destiny to Scotland |newspaper=[[The Herald (Glasgow)]] |date=1 April 2004 |accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the 1940s, the British Geological Survey, had carried out a survey of the Stone when the Coronation Chair was undergoing conservation work. The fault line had been noticed as well as the many marks and features of the Stone's surface. This allowed verification of the authenticity of the returned item.&lt;ref name=Welander/&gt;

A scanray examination conducted by the Home Office Police Scientific Development Branch in 1973 confirmed the presence of 'three metal rods and sockets, one being at right angles to the other two'. This also indicated that the repaired Westminster Stone, not a replica, had been returned.&lt;ref&gt;Erlend Clouston, 'Stone of Destiny proved genuine: Files reveal how in 1973 Scottish relic was X-rayed', ''The Guardian'' (17 July 1996), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 'Edward I conspiracy'==
The apparent absence of thirteenth and fourteenth century Scottish mentions of the Stone of Scone, and their lack of reaction to Edward's theft, compared with the wealth of legends developed in later centuries, have given rise to the theory that the Stone of Scone was never a relic of great significance to the Scots, but 'talked up' by Edward as useful propaganda.  By creating a relic which, in the popular eye of the English, endorsed his claim as 'Lord Paramount', he was making a shrewd political statement.  By continuing to flaunt the stone in front of later generations of Scots, the hoax became a self-fulfilling taunt.{{Citation needed|reason=What theory?|date=March 2017}}

'''Ximenynic acid''' is trans-11-octadecen-9-ynoic acid,&lt;ref name=Yandi1996/&gt; a long-chain [[acetylenic]] [[fatty acid]].&lt;ref name=Yandi1996/&gt;

It was discovered in the fruit kernels of 3 South American [[ximenia]] species (and so named).&lt;ref name=Lightelm1952&gt;[http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/1952/jr/jr9520001088#!divAbstract The chemistry of ximenynic acid.  J. Chem. Soc., 1952, 1088-1093 DOI: 10.1039/JR9520001088 ]&lt;/ref&gt; and found to have the formula C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Lightelm1952/&gt;

It can be extracted from the fruit kernels of the [[Santalum obtusifolium]] (Sandalwood)&lt;ref name=MPiA&gt;Medicinal Plants in Australia, Volume 1. Cheryll Williams page 274. {{ISBN|978-1-877058-79-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Australian sandalwood [[Santalum spicatum]]&lt;ref name=Yandi1996&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02517979#page-1 Separation and identification of ximenynic acid isomers in the seed oil of Santalum spicatum R.Br. as their 4,4-dimethyloxazoline derivatives. Yandi et al. 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also found in seed oil of other plants in the [[Santalaceae]] family, including the native cherry [[Exocarpos cupressiformis]] and sweet quandong [[Santalum acuminatum]].&lt;ref name=Okada2013&gt;[http://www.pubfacts.com/detail/24062307/Diversity-of-12-fatty-acid-desaturases-in-santalaceae-and-their-role-in-production-of-seed-oil-acety Diversity of Δ12 fatty acid desaturases in santalaceae and their role in production of seed oil acetylenic fatty acids.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2621">The '''Yale Program on Climate Change Communication''' ('''YPCCC''') is a research center within the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies at [[Yale University]] that conducts scientific research on public [[climate change]] knowledge, attitudes, policy preferences, and behavior at the global, national, and local scales.  It grew out of a conference held in Aspen, Colorado in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/about/the-program/|title=About the Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Yale Program on Climate Change Communication|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General==
As of 2017 the program was led by [[Anthony Leiserowitz]], and it put out a daily 90 second audio program carried by around 350 radio stations, articles in the media, and a series of videos published monthly, and provided training to help television [[Weather_forecasting#Broadcasts|weather presenters]] and reporters discuss climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Abraham |first1=John |title=Great climate science communication from Yale Climate Connections |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/aug/14/great-cliate-science-communication-from-yale-climate-connections |work=the Guardian |date=14 August 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the program was given a "Friend of the Planet" award by the [[National Center for Science Education]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Press release: Friend of Darwin and Friend of the Planet awards for 2017 |url=https://ncse.com/news/2017/02/friend-darwin-friend-planet-awards-2017-0018458 |work=NCSE |date=13 February 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2018, Leiserowitz and YPCCC researchers received the Warren J. Mitofsky Innovators Award, given by the American Association for Public Opinion Research. The award recognized "a new statistical method to downscale national public opinion estimates using multiple regression and post stratification (MPR) survey data collection methodology."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aapor.org/Conference-Events/Awards/Award-Winners.aspx|title=Award Winners|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zambia Forestry College (ZFC) was established in 1949 to provide technical training in forestry. In the same year it produced the first forest guards.

In the following year, Forest Rangers were trained. The College has since been growing to cope with the changing demand for natural resource trained staff. By 1963, over 300 Forest Rangers (Certificate holders) and Forest Guards had been trained.

Training for Foresters (Diploma holders) commenced in 1963 with nine (9) students.  By the end of 1977, 131 Foresters and one (1) female Forester completed her training successfully signifying that this field was gender friendly. The college has now been upgraded with equipment, facilities and staff.
