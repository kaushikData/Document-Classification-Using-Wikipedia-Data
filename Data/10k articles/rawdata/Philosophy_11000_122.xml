An '''abstention doctrine''' is any of several doctrines that a United States court may (or in some cases must) apply to refuse to hear a case if hearing the case would potentially intrude upon the powers of another court. Such doctrines are usually invoked where [[lawsuit]]s involving the same issues are brought in two different court systems at the same time (such as federal and state courts).

The United States has a federal court system with limitations on the cases that it can hear, while each state has its own individual court system. In some instances, the jurisdiction of these courts overlap, so a lawsuit between two parties may be brought in either or both courts. The latter circumstance can lead to confusion, waste resources, as well as cause the appearance that one court is disrespecting the other. Both federal and state courts have developed rules determining when one court will defer to another's jurisdiction over a particular case.

==Federal abstention doctrines==
The various abstention doctrines applied by federal courts are named for the [[United States Supreme Court]] cases in which they were enunciated.

===''Pullman'' abstention===
''Pullman'' abstention was the first "doctrine of abstention" to be announced by the Court, and is named for ''[[Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co.]]'', 312 U.S. 496 (1941). Concisely, the doctrine holds that "the federal courts should not adjudicate the constitutionality of state enactments fairly open to interpretation until the state courts have been afforded a reasonable opportunity to pass on them."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1986/1986_85_1513/argument/&lt;/ref&gt; This doctrine permits a federal court to stay a plaintiff's claim that a state law violates the [[United States Constitution]] until the state's judiciary has had an opportunity to apply the law to the plaintiff's particular case. The hope is to avoid a federal constitutional ruling by allowing the state courts to construe the law in a way that eliminates the constitutional problem or to rule it void under the state's own constitution.

For ''Pullman'' abstention to be invoked, three conditions must be apparent:
#  The case presents both state grounds and federal constitutional grounds for relief;
#  The proper resolution of the state ground for the decision is unclear; and
#  The disposition of the state ground could obviate adjudication of the federal constitutional ground.

Under ''Pullman'' abstention, the federal court retains [[jurisdiction]] to hear the constitutional issues in the case if the state court's resolution is still constitutionally suspect. In ''[[Government and Civil Employees Organizing Committee, CIO v. Windsor]]'', 353 U.S. 364 (1957), the Supreme Court held that litigants must ''inform'' the state court that they are contending that the state law violates a federal constitutional provision, so that the state court may take that into consideration when interpreting the state statute. However, in ''[[England v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners]]'', 375 U.S. 411 (1964), the Supreme Court noted that the litigants must not ask the state court to ''resolve'' the constitutional issue itself, or the federal court would be bound by ''[[res judicata]]'' to follow the decision of the state court. In such a case, the litigant seeking a judgment that the law is unconstitutional must usually appeal to the higher courts of the state, rather than seeking review in a federal court.

===''Younger'' abstention===
''Younger'' abstention, named for ''[[Younger v. Harris]]'', 401 U.S. 37 (1971), is less permissive to the federal courts, barring them from hearing [[civil rights]] [[tort]] claims brought by a person who is currently being prosecuted for a matter arising from that claim in state court. For example, if an individual who was charged with drug possession under a state law believes that the search was illegal, and in violation of their [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] rights, that person may have a [[cause of action]] to sue the state for illegally searching him. However, a federal court will not hear the case until the person is convicted of the crime. The doctrine has been extended to state civil proceedings in aid of and closely related to state criminal statutes,&lt;ref&gt;''Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd.'', 420 U.S. 592, 43 L.Ed.2d 482, 95 S.Ct. 1200 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; administrative proceedings initiated by a state agency,&lt;ref&gt;''Ohio Civil Rights Comm'n v. Dayton Christian Sch., Inc.'', 477 U.S. 619, 627 n.2, 91 L. Ed. 2d 512, 106 S. Ct. 2718 (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; or situations where the State has jailed a person for [[contempt of court]].&lt;ref&gt;Judice v. Vail, 430 U.S. 327 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine applies even where the state does not bring an action until after the person has filed a lawsuit in federal court, provided that the federal court has not yet undergone proceedings of substance on the merits of the federal suit.&lt;ref&gt;''Hicks v. Miranda'', 422 U.S. 332, 45 L.Ed.2d 223, 95 S.Ct. 2281 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three exceptions to ''Younger'' abstention:
# Where the prosecution is in bad faith (i.e. the state knows the person to be innocent); or
# Where the prosecution is part of some pattern of harassment against an individual; or
# Where the law being enforced is utterly and irredeemably unconstitutional (e.g., if the state were to pass a law making it a crime to say anything negative about its governor under any circumstances).

===''Burford'' abstention and ''Thibodaux'' abstention===
''Burford'' abstention, derived from ''[[Burford v. Sun Oil Co.]]'', 319 U.S. 315 (1943), allows a federal court sitting in [[diversity jurisdiction]] to abstain where the state courts likely have greater expertise in a particularly complex area of state law (the case itself dealt with the regulation of oil drilling operations in Texas). ''Burford'' allows a federal court to dismiss a case only if:

# The case presents "difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends the result in the case then at bar," or 
# The adjudication of the case in a federal forum "would be disruptive of state efforts to establish a coherent policy with respect to a matter of substantial public concern."&lt;ref&gt;''Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co'', 517 U.S. 706, 727 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Burford'' abstention is closely related to ''Thibodaux'' abstention, derived from ''[[Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux]]'', 360 U.S. 25 (1959), which occurs when a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction chooses to allow a state to decide issues of state law that are of great public importance to that state, to the extent that a federal determination would infringe on state sovereignty. 

Unlike the abstention doctrines raised in federal question cases, there is a strong presumption that federal courts should ''not'' apply ''Burford'' or ''Thibodaux'' Abstention.

===''Colorado River'' abstention===
Finally, ''Colorado River'' abstention, from ''[[Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States]]'', 424 U.S. 800 (1976) comes into play where [[parallel litigation]] is being carried out, particularly where federal and state court proceedings are simultaneously being carried out to determine the rights of parties with respect to the same questions of law. Under such circumstances, it makes little sense for two courts to expend the time and effort to achieve a resolution of the question.

Unlike other abstention doctrines, application of the ''Colorado River'' doctrine is prudential and discretionary, and is based less on [[comity]] or respect between different court systems than on the desire to avoid wasteful duplication of litigation. The classification of the doctrine as a form of abstention has been disputed, with some courts simply calling it a "doctrine of exceptional circumstances". Each of the various federal circuits has come up with its own list of factors to weigh in determining whether a federal court should abstain from hearing a case under this doctrine. Typically, such factors include:
* the order in which the courts assumed jurisdiction over property
* the order in which the courts assumed jurisdiction over the parties
* the relative inconvenience of the fora
* the relative progress of the two actions (added by ''[[Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp.]]'' in 1983)
* the desire to avoid piecemeal litigation
* whether federal law provides the rule of decision
* whether the state court will adequately protect the rights of all parties
* whether the federal filing was vexatious (intended to harass the other party) or reactive (in response to adverse rulings in the state court).

===Note on the ''Rooker-Feldman'' doctrine===
The [[Rooker-Feldman doctrine|''Rooker-Feldman'' doctrine]] has some characteristics of an abstention doctrine, because it prohibits federal court review of state court actions. However, it does not require federal courts to abstain from hearing cases pending action in the state court, but instead deems that federal courts lack [[jurisdiction]] to hear cases already fully decided in state courts. The doctrine is not a judicially created exception to federal jurisdiction. Rather, the Rooker and Feldman cases simply recognized the fact that Congress has not granted the federal district or appeals courts statutory jurisdiction to consider appeals of state court decisions, only the [[US Supreme Court]] via a [[writ of certiorari|writ of ''certiorari'']]). It is an open question whether Congress could grant such jurisdiction.

==State court abstention doctrines==
No national rule requires state courts to abstain from hearing cases brought in federal courts or in courts of other states, though the [[All Writs Act]] permits federal courts to enjoin state courts from hearing matters if necessary to preserve the jurisdiction of the federal court. But every state has some doctrine that lets its courts stay actions to avoid duplicative litigation.

Some states have doctrines that let state courts abstain from hearing cases already pending in other kinds of tribunals. For example, in ''Gavle v. Little Six, Inc.,'' 555 N.W.2d 284 (Minn. 1996), the [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] upheld abstention where the state court might "undermine the authority of the tribal courts over Reservation affairs" or "infringe on the right of Indians to govern themselves".

'''Albert Busuttil''' (1891–1956) was a Maltese minor [[philosopher]]. In philosophy he was mostly interested in [[politics]] and [[labour rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2011|pp=104–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Busuttil was born at [[Sliema]], [[Malta]] in 1891. He studied at the Lyceum and at the [[University of Malta]], and later joined the [[Jesuits]]. He continued his philosophical studies in [[Jersey]], [[France]], and his theology in [[Posillipo]], [[Naples]], in [[Italy]], both centres of [[Jesuit]] teaching. He was ordained a priest in 1922. Afterwards, he taught [[ethics]] in [[Ireland]], and [[history of philosophy]] in [[Catania]], [[Sicily]]. In [[Malta]] he taught [[philosophy]], [[apologetics]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[sociology]]. Between 1928 and 1945 Busuttil was Prefect of Studies at [[St Aloysius' College (Malta)|St. Aloysius College]], [[Malta]].

During [[World War II]] (1939–45) Busuttil would go around cities and villages gathering people in public squares and introducing them to the [[Social teachings of the papacy|social teaching]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. After the war he was than especially close to workers who were part of the newly founded [[General Workers' Union (Malta)|General Workers Union]], particularly at the shipyards. To people like Busuttil, the main worry in those days was the infiltration of the [[communist ideology]] within the workers’ movement. In 1947 he was appointed Spiritual Director of the union, an office he held up till 1951. He died in 1956.

==Works==
Busuttil brought together his philosophical erudition and prowess, and his interest in mass education, particularly of workers. To this effect, he published a large number of pamphlets – more than sixty – which could serve as pocket-guides to the themes he chose to deal with. Though adopting a popular style and common language, he backed any of his arguments with a philosophical line of reasoning. Amongst his most worthy of consideration to philosophy, and also the most representatives of Busuttil’s thoughts and style, are the following:

* 1945 - ''Dokumentazzjoni Nisranija-Kommunista'' (Christian-Communist Documentation).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1946 - ''That il-Hakma tal-Mingel u tal-Martell'' (Under the Yoke of the Sickle and Hammer).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9509">'''Alev Alatlı''' (born 1944 in [[Menemen]]) is a [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[economist]], [[philosopher]], [[columnist]] and bestselling [[novelist]].

==Early years==
She was born 1944 in the town of [[Menemen]] in western Turkey to an officer's family. She spent her childhood in [[Japan]], where her father was appointed as the [[Military attaché]] in the [[List of diplomatic missions of Turkey|Embassy of Turkey]] and also as the [[Liaison officer]] of the [[Turkish Brigade|Turkish Brigade in Korea]] to the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alevalatli.com/menu.asp?sayfa=makale&amp;kat=1&amp;v=B%DDYOGRAF%DD |publisher=Alev Alatlı |title=Biography |accessdate=2010-01-03 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alev Alatlı attended the [[American School in Japan]] in [[Nakameguro, Meguro, Tokyo]]. After finishing high school there, her family returned to Turkey, and Alev studied economics at the [[Middle East Technical University]] in [[Ankara]], from where she graduated in 1963 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree.&lt;ref name="aa"/&gt;

Following graduation, she married her classmate Alper Orhon, a [[Turkish Cypriot]]. She was granted a [[Fulbright Scholarship]] and her husband a scholarship from the [[Ford Foundation]] to conduct postgraduate study in the USA. Educated at [[Vanderbilt University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], she earned a [[Master of Arts]] in Development Economics and Econometrics.&lt;ref name="aa"/&gt;

By this time, she had started to think about the importance of formulas and figures in explaining the world, and decided to pursue studies in [[philosophy]]. Although she enrolled at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[New Hampshire]] for doctoral studies on [[philosophy of religion]] and [[philosophy of history]] she doesn't have a Ph.D. degree.&lt;ref name="aa"/&gt; 

In 1974, Alatlı returned to Turkey. She jobbed a while as a lecturer at [[Istanbul University]] and later at the State Planning Organization (DPT) in Ankara in her capacity as an economist.&lt;ref name="aa"/&gt;

In the next five years after her return from the USA, Alev Alatlı spent her time mainly in studying [[Islam]]. She was also involved in a [[psycholinguistic]] project of  the [[University of California, Berkeley]] on language learning patterns of Turkish children. She published a magazine titled "''Bizim İngilizce''" {{lang-en|Our English Language}}) in co-operation with the newspaper ''[[Cumhuriyet]]'' for Turks based on native tongue and culture.

==Career==
In 1982, she quit her other activities to stay at home and to devote herself to writing. Her first book titled "''Aydın Despotizmi...''" (''Despotism of the Intellectuals...'') was a philosophical study.

Alatlı's next work and first novel "''Yaseminler Tüter mi Hala?''" (''Jasmines Smoke No More!'') appeared in 1985. It was inspired by the true story of a [[Greek Cypriot]] woman. Born and christened at the [[Apostolos Andreas Monastery]] on the [[Karpas Peninsula]] of [[Cyprus]], she dies in a tragic manner at 32 in [[Piraeus]], [[Greece]], after two marriages -one with a Muslim Turkish Cypriot, the other with an Orthodox Greek– and five children.

Alev Alatlı's next works were two translations into Turkish of books by [[Edward Said]] titled "''Covering Islam''" (''Haberlerin Ağında Islam'') and "''The Question of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]''" (''Filistin’in Sorunu''), for which she was awarded with an honorary medal by [[Yaser Arafat]].

Her novelella "''İşkenceci''" (''The Torturer''), published in 1987, served as a prelude to her next four novels ''Viva la Muerte! - Yaşasın Ölüm!'') in 1992, ''’Nuke’ Türkiye!'' (''Nuke Turkey'') in 1993, ''Valla, Kurda Yedirdin Beni!'' (''You Sure Made Me Prey to the Wolves'') in 1993 and ''O.K. Musti! Türkiye Tamamdır.'' (''OK Mustafa, Turkey's Done!'') in 1994.

The highly realistic novel "''Kadere Karşı Koy A.Ş.''" (''Format your Fate Formidably, Inc.''), another best seller by Alatlı, followed in 1995.

Alev Alatlı’s first poetry book "''Eylül '98''" (''September 1998'') came out in 1999.

She wrote two futuristic books, "''Kabus''" (''The Nightmare'') in 1999 and "''Rüya''" (''The Dream'') in 2000 comprised by "[[Schrödinger's Cat]]".

Alatlı's next novels  "''Grace over Enlightenment''", "''World Sentry''" and "''Eyy Uhnem! Eyy Uhnem!''" are the first three books of a four-volume work on [[Russia]] called "''Gogol’un İzinde''" (''On the Footsteps of [[Nikolai Gogol|Gogol]]''). She was awarded in 2006 with the prize "[[Mikhail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov]] 100 Year in Literature" for her third novel in the series.&lt;ref name="aa"/&gt;

Since 2002, she wrote bi-weekly a column in the conservative newspaper with a moderate Islamic worldview ''[[Zaman (newspaper)|Zaman]]''. In February 2008, an article of her on the women's Islamic headgear [[turban]] was not allowed to be published by the newspaper's editor-of-chief with the argument "our readers are not ready for that".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haberturk.com/haber.asp?id=56580&amp;cat=140&amp;dt=2008/02/19 |newspaper=Haber Türk |title=Alev Alatlı'nın yazısı Zaman'a girmedi |date=2008-02-19 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2010-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A book published in 2003 under the title "''Şimdi Değilse, Ne zaman?''"

'''Alexander Francis Horn''' (14 August 1929 – 30 September 2007), known more often as '''Alex Horn''', was a playwright and actor and the leader of a series of controversial groups which claimed a linkage to the teachings of G. I. [[Gurdjieff]].  {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

== Overview ==
His groups have been classed by some as cults, although others believe he was attempting to promote the [[Fourth Way]], which can involve a degree of intense confrontation on a personal level. Alex was married to Anne Burrage (later [[Anne Haas]]) in the 1960s during which time he was running [[Red Mountain Ranch]], a part-time commune located on [[Sonoma Mountain]] in northern California. The order of events is unclear, but Anne left this group in 1969 around the time that Alex became involved with and eventually married [[Sharon Gans]]. Anne took many of the members from the ranch and started [[The Group (commune)|The Group]], amid claims that Red Mountain Ranch had become violent and dangerous, and that Alex was becoming a cult figure. Alex and Sharon ran the [[Theatre of All Possibilities]] until 1978 when it received unfavorable press from the San Francisco Chronicle&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.survivorshandbook.com/wp-content/articles/ChronicleArticle.pdf San Francisco Chronicle Article December 23, 1978]&lt;/ref&gt; and San Francisco Progress&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.survivorshandbook.com/wp-content/articles/ProgressArticle1.pdf San Francisco Progress Article December 22, 1978]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.survivorshandbook.com/wp-content/articles/ProgressArticle2.pdf San Francisco Progress Article January 10, 1979]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.survivorshandbook.com/wp-content/articles/ProgressArticle3.pdf San Francisco Progress Article January 12, 1979]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.survivorshandbook.com/wp-content/articles/ProgressArticle4.pdf San Francisco Progress Article January 14, 1979]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.survivorshandbook.com/wp-content/articles/ProgressArticle5.pdf San Francisco Progress Article February 25, 1979]&lt;/ref&gt; in the wake of the [[Jim Jones]] tragedy in November 1978. Alex and Sharon both left San Francisco in 1978 and reportedly continued to run various groups in New York and Boston.
Alex Horn had five children with Anne Burrage, Maurice, Elaine, Matthew, Mary Ellen and Benjamin.  He died on September 30, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Social Security Death Index, http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} He was married to Sharon Gans&lt;ref&gt;[[Sharon Gans]]&lt;/ref&gt; who also operated the NYC group with him.

An article about Alexander Francis Horn, then five years old, appeared in the Chicago Tribune on February 9, 1935.  The child Horn was alleged to have spread the alarm for a fire that broke out in his home. 1940 census records show Alexander Horn, aged 10, as an inmate of the Marks Nathan Jewish Orphan Home in Chicago, where he is reported as having lived for the previous five years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/download/TheEsotericHistoryArchive_665/1940UnitedStatesFederalCensusForAlexanderHorn.jpg 1940 Census Record for Alexander Horn]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ann Cottrell Free''' (June 4, 1916 – October 30, 2004) was an [[United States|American]] [[journalist]] who wrote extensively on animal protection issues.

==Biography==
Free was born in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Virginia]] on June 4, 1916. A graduate of [[Collegiate School (Richmond, Virginia)|Collegiate School]] and [[Barnard College]], she became the first woman Washington correspondent for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'' and the ''[[Chicago Sun]]'', where she covered First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and wartime-Washington.&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Post'', October 31, 2004, [http://www.anncottrellfree.org/washington-post-obituary.html obituary by Patricia Sullivan].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/obituaries/articles/2004/10/31/ann_cottrell_free_longtime_journalist/ Associated Press obituary], October 31, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Sun-Times'', November 1, 2004 [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20041101/ai_n12566793 obituary by Dan Rozak].&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war she served in [[China]] as a special correspondent for the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] and in [[Europe]] for the [[Marshall Plan]].  She later wrote for the [[North American Newspaper Alliance]] and was a contributing columnist to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the ''[[Washington Star]]'', other newspapers and syndicates.
An [[Albert Schweitzer]] Medalist, she was also the recipient of a variety of humanitarian and writing awards for her novel, ''Forever the Wild Mare'', as well as her other animal writing.

She initiated the establishment of the [[Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge]] and presented testimony on numerous animal protection issues to Congressional committees.

She authored three books, ''Forever the Wild Mare'' (Dodd Mead 1963), ''No Room, Save in the Heart'' (Flying Fox Press 1987) and ''Animals, Nature and Albert Schweitzer'' (Flying Fox Press, 2000). She received the [[Rachel Carson]] Legacy Award in 1988 and in 1996 was inducted into the [[Virginia Communications Hall of Fame]].

She was married to journalist [[James S. Free]], and, for a time, they co-authored ''Whirligig'', a syndicated column about Washington politics.

Her oral histories are in the collections of [[Columbia University]] and the [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]]. She died on October 30, 2004 at the age of 88 in Washington D.C.  A year later, the [[National Press Club Ann Cottrell Free Animal Reporting Award]] was established to inspire and encourage other journalists to follow in her footsteps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.org/about/awards Ann Cottrell Free Animal Reporting Award], Journalism Awards, National Press Club&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 she was one of twenty three women featured in the book ''They Made Their Mark: An Illustrated History of the [[Society of Woman Geographers]]'' (Globe Pequot Press).

'''Anti-art''' is a loosely used term applied to an array of concepts and attitudes that reject prior definitions of art and question art in general. Somewhat paradoxically, anti-art tends to conduct this questioning and rejection from the vantage point of art.&lt;ref&gt;David Graver. ''The aesthetics of disturbance: anti-art in avant-garde drama''. University of Michigan Press, 1995, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is associated with the [[Dada]] movement and is generally accepted as attributable to [[Marcel Duchamp]] pre-[[World War I]] around 1914, when he began to use [[found object]]s as art. It was used to describe revolutionary forms of art. The term was used later by the Conceptual artists of the 1960s to describe the work of those who claimed to have retired altogether from the practice of art, from the production of works which could be sold.&lt;ref name=tate/&gt;&lt;ref name="20th-Century art book"&gt;{{cite book |last=...|first=contributors Rachel Barnes|title=The 20th-Century art book.|year=2001|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=London|isbn=0714835420|page=505|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An expression of anti-art may or may not take traditional form or meet the criteria for being defined as a work of art according to conventional standards.&lt;ref name="Anti-Art_and_the_Concept_of_Art" &gt;Paul N. Humble. "Anti-Art and the Concept of Art". In: "A companion to art theory". Editors: Paul Smith and Carolyn Wilde, Wiley-Blackwell, 2002, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"&gt;Martin Puchner. "Poetry of the revolution: Marx, manifestos, and the avant-gardes". Princeton University Press, 2006, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, works of anti-art may express an outright rejection of having conventionally defined criteria as a means of defining what art is, and what it is not. Anti-artworks may reject conventional artistic standards altogether,&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Atwood. "The Triumph of Anti-Art: Conceptual and Performance Art in the Formation of Post-Modernism". Afterimage, Sep 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; or focus criticism only on certain aspects of art, such as the art market and [[high culture#High art|high art]]. Some anti-artworks may reject individualism in art,&lt;ref name="Theory of the Avant-Garde1"&gt;Peter Bürger "Theory of the Avant-Garde". Trans. Michael Shaw. Minneapolis: Minnesota. 1984, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Strategies of Fame1"&gt;An Paenhuysen. [http://www.imageandnarrative.be/tulseluper/paenhuysen.htm "Strategies of Fame: The anonymous career of a Belgian surrealist".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926050531/http://www.imageandnarrative.be/tulseluper/paenhuysen.htm |date=2008-09-26 }} In: "Opening Peter Greenaway's Tulse Luper Suitcases". Guest edited by: Gray Kochhar-Lindgren, Image and Narrative, Vol.VI, issue 2 (12.) August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas some may reject "universality" as an accepted factor in art. Additionally, some forms of anti-art reject art entirely, or reject the idea that art is a separate realm or specialization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sadie Plant]]. "The most radical gesture: the Situationist International in a postmodern age". Taylor &amp; Francis, 1992, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-artworks may also reject art based upon a consideration of art as being oppressive of a segment of the population.&lt;ref name="Art_Is_Like_Cancer"&gt;Interview of Roger Taylor by Stewart Home. [http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/pol/taylor.htm "Art Is Like Cancer".] Mute Magazine. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-art artworks may articulate a disagreement with the generally supposed notion of there being a separation between art and life. Indeed, anti-art artworks may voice a question as to whether "art" really exists or not.&lt;ref&gt;Paul N. Humble. "Anti-Art and the Concept of Art". In: "A companion to art theory". Editors: Paul Smith and Carolyn Wilde, Wiley-Blackwell, 2002. Page 244&lt;/ref&gt; "Anti-art" has been referred to as a "paradoxical neologism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aristos.org/whatart/lights.htm|title=The Lights Go On and Off - WHAT ART IS Online, February 2002|website=www.aristos.org|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that its obvious opposition to art has been observed concurring with staples of twentieth-century art or "modern art", in particular [[art movement]]s that have self-consciously sought to transgress traditions or institutions.&lt;ref&gt;"Ernst Van Alphen, a Clark scholar from the Netherlands, suggested that Modernism itself can be characterized as anti-art in that since the earliest gestures of Dada and Futurism, art is seen as transformative and productive, breaking with institutions rather than destructive of images." Source: http://www.berkshirefinearts.com/?page=article&amp;article_id=128&amp;catID=3&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-art itself is not a distinct art movement, however. This would tend to be indicated by the time it spans—longer than that usually spanned by art movements. Some art movements though, are labeled "anti-art". The [[Dada]] movement is generally considered the first anti-art movement; the term anti-art itself is said to have been coined by Dadaist [[Marcel Duchamp]] around 1914, and his [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]]s have been cited as early examples of anti-art objects.&lt;ref&gt;This is one dictionary definition of anti-art: ''"A loosely used term that has been applied to works or attitudes that debunk traditional concepts of art. The term is said to have been coined by Marcel Duchamp in about 1914, and his ready-mades can be cited as early examples of the genre. Dada was the first anti-art movement, and subsequently the denunciation of art became commonplace—almost de rigueur—among the avant-garde."'' Note the emphasis on the fact that most art adopts the same principles attributed to the concept of "anti-art". Source: http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O5-antiart.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodor W. Adorno]] in ''Aesthetic Theory'' (1970) stated that "...even the abolition of art is respectful of art because it takes the truth claim of art seriously".&lt;ref&gt;T.W. Adorno. "Aesthetic Theory". 1970, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-art has become generally accepted by the artworld to be art, although some people still reject Duchamp's readymades as art, for instance the [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] group of artists,&lt;ref name=tate&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/anti-art "Glossary: Anti-art"], [[Tate]].

Anti-art can take the form of art or not.&lt;ref name="Anti-Art_and_the_Concept_of_Art"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt; It is posited that anti-art need not even take the form of art, in order to embody its function as anti-art. This point is disputed. Some of the forms of anti-art which are art strive to reveal the conventional limits of art by expanding its properties.&lt;ref name="What's Neo about the Neo-Avant-Garde1" &gt;Hal Foster. "What's Neo about the Neo-Avant-Garde?". October, Vol. 70, "The Duchamp Effect", Autumn, 1994. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some instances of anti-art are suggestive of a reduction to what might seem to be fundamental elements or building blocks of art. Examples of this sort of phenomenon might include [[monochrome painting]]s, empty frames, [[list of silent musical compositions|silence as music]], [[aleatoricism|chance art]]. Anti-art is also often seen to make use of highly innovative materials and techniques, and well beyond—to include hitherto unheard of elements in visual art. These types of anti-art can be [[readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]], [[found object]] art, [[détournement]], [[combine painting]]s, [[appropriation (art)]], [[happening]]s, [[performance art]], and [[body art]].&lt;ref name="What's Neo about the Neo-Avant-Garde1"/&gt;

Anti-art can involve the renouncement of making art entirely.&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt; This can be accomplished through an art strike and this can also be accomplished through [[revolution]]ary [[activism]].&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt; An aim of anti-art can be to undermine or understate individual creativity. This may be accomplished through the utilization of [[found art|readymades]].&lt;ref name="Theory of the Avant-Garde1"/&gt; Individual creativity can be further downplayed by the use of [[industrial process]]es in the making of art. ''Anti-artists'' may seek to undermine individual creativity by producing their artworks anonymously.&lt;ref name="Pop art1" &gt;Tilman Osterwold. "Pop art". Taschen, 2003, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; They may refuse to show their artworks. They may refuse public recognition.&lt;ref name="Strategies of Fame1"/&gt; Anti-artists may choose to work collectively, in order to place less emphasis on individual identity and individual creativity. This can be seen in the instance of [[happening]]s. This is sometimes the case with "supertemporal" artworks, which are by design impermanent. Anti-artists will sometimes destroy their works of art.&lt;ref name="Strategies of Fame1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Towards an Acognitive Culture1" &gt;[[Henry Flynt]] interviewed by [[Stewart Home]]. [http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/interviews/flynt.htm "Towards an Acognitive Culture".] New York 8 March 1989. Smile 11, London Summer 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Some artworks made by anti-artists are purposely created to be destroyed. This can be seen in [[auto-destructive art]].

[[André Malraux]] has developed a concept of anti-art quite different from that outlined above. For Malraux, anti-art began with the 'Salon' or 'Academic' art of the nineteenth century which rejected the basic ambition of art in favour of a semi-photographic illusionism (often prettified). Of Academic painting, Malraux writes, 'All true painters, all those for whom painting is a value, were nauseated by these pictures – "Portrait of a Great Surgeon Operating" and the like – because they saw in them not a form of painting, but the negation of painting'. For Malraux, anti-art is still very much with us, though in a different form. Its descendants are commercial cinema and television, and popular music and fiction. The 'Salon', Malraux writes, 'has been expelled from painting, but elsewhere it reigns supreme'.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure. André Malraux's Theory of Art''. Amsterdam, Rodopi, 2009. pp.275-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Anti-art is also a tendency in the theoretical understanding of art and [[fine art]].

The philosopher Roger Taylor puts forward that art is a bourgeois ideology that has its origins with capitalism in "Art, an Enemy of the People". Holding a strong anti-essentialist position he states also that art has not always existed and is not universal but peculiar to Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/pol/taylor.htm|title=philosopher Roger Taylor on why art is an enemy of the people|website=www.stewarthomesociety.org|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a claim that is factually inaccurate as proven by many substantial archaeological findings on the Asian and African continents.

''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]'' by Larry Shiner is an art history book which fundamentally questions our understanding of art.
"The modern system of art is not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old." (Shiner 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;3)
Shiner presents (fine) art as a social construction that has not always existed throughout human history and could also disappear in its turn.

===Pre World War I===
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] rejected the separation between performer and spectator, life and theatre.&lt;ref&gt;North West Arts Association (Great Britain), Alexander Schouvaloff. "Place for the arts". Seel House Press, 1970, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] posited that art was a consequence of the [[social class|class system]] and therefore concluded that, in a [[communism|communist]] society, there would only be people who engage in the making of art and no "artists".&lt;ref&gt;Larry Shiner. ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]''. University of Chicago Press, 2003, pp. 234, 236, 245,&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sapeck-La Joconde fumant la pipe.jpg|thumb|Illustration of ''Le rire'' (1887). First shown 1883 at an "Incohérents" exhibition by Arthur Sapeck (Eugène Bataille).|200px]]
Arguably the first movement that deliberately set itself in opposition to established art were the [[Incoherents]] in late 19th. century Paris. Founded by [[Jules Lévy]] in 1882, the Incoherents organized charitable art exhibitions intended to be satirical and humoristic, they presented "...drawings by people who can't draw..."&lt;ref&gt;"''...dessins exécutés par des gens qui ne savent pas dessiner...''"&lt;/ref&gt; and held masked balls with artistic themes, all in the greater tradition of [[Montmartre]] cabaret culture. While short lived – the last Incoherent show took place in 1896 – the movement was popular for its entertainment value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artsincoherents.info/|title=Les arts Incohérents|language=French|accessdate=2009-05-06 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090501185839/http://www.artsincoherents.info/ |archivedate= 1 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their commitment to satire, irreverence and ridicule they produced a number of works that show remarkable formal similarities to creations of the avant-garde of the 20th century: ready-mades,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radicalart.info/things/readymade/index.html|title=Les Expositions des Arts Incohérents |work=Readymades (at Radical Art, Amsterdam)|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; monochromes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radicalart.info/nothing/monochrome/Incoherents/index.html|title=Early monochrome painting: Les Incohérents. |work=Monochromes (at Radical Art, Amsterdam)|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; empty frames&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radicalart.info/nothing/space/frames/index.html|title=Mey-Sonier: Tableau d'à Venir, 1883|work=Empty frames (at Radical Art, Amsterdam)|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and silence as music.&lt;ref&gt;Alphonse Allais: Marche Funèbre Composée pour les Funérailles d'un Grand Homme Sourd, 1884.

===Dada and constructivism===

Beginning in Switzerland, during [[World War I]], much of [[Dada]], and some aspects of the art movements it inspired, such as [[Neo-Dada]], [[Nouveau réalisme]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Tinguely]]: Art is revolution. National-Zeitung, Basle, 13 October 1967. "All machines are art. Even old, abandoned, rusty machines for sifting stones. (...) A beautiful oil refinery or your Johanniterbrücke, which are supposed to be solely functional, are important additions to modern art. So, art is also: the achievements of engineers and technicians, even if they express themselves unconsciously or purely functionally. Art is everything. (Do you think art ought to be made only by 'artists'?) And: art is everywhere – at my grandmother's – in the most incredible kitsch or under a rotten plank."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fluxus]], is considered anti-art.&lt;ref&gt;"Art is dead. Long live Dada."—[[Walter Serner]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Dada is like your hopes: nothing, like your paradise: nothing, like your idols: nothing; like your heroes: nothing, like your artists: nothing, like your religions: nothing' -[[Francis Picabia]]&lt;/ref&gt; Dadaists rejected cultural and intellectual conformity in art and more broadly in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Richter |first=Hans |year=1965 |title=Dada: Art and Anti-art |location= New York and Toronto |publisher= Oxford University Press |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For everything that art stood for, Dada was to represent the opposite.

Where art was concerned with traditional [[aesthetics]], Dada ignored aesthetics completely. If art was to appeal to sensibilities, Dada was intended to offend. Through their rejection of traditional culture and aesthetics the Dadaists hoped to destroy traditional culture and aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;"We had lost confidence in our culture. Everything had to be demolished. We would begin again after the "[[tabula rasa]]". At the Cabaret Voltaire we began by shocking common sense, public opinion, education, institutions, museums, good taste, in short, the whole prevailing order." — [[Marcel Janco]]&lt;/ref&gt; Because they were more politicized, the Berlin dadas were the most radically anti-art within Dada.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Shiner. "[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]". University of Chicago Press, 2003, p. 254. "the Berlin [[dada]]s were more radical (compared to the other dadas), believing that the only way to reintegrate art and life was to place both at the service of the socialist revolution."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, in the Berlin group, [[The Central Council of Dada for the World Revolution|the Dadaist revolutionary central council]] outlined the Dadaist ideals of radical [[communism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Central Council of Dada for the World Revolution|The Dadaist revolutionary central council]]. [http://www.mariabuszek.com/kcai/DadaSurrealism/DadaSurrReadings/DadaGrmny.pdf "What is Dadaism and what does it want in Germany?".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913093050/http://www.mariabuszek.com/kcai/DadaSurrealism/DadaSurrReadings/DadaGrmny.pdf |date=2008-09-13 }} Tract, 1919. "Dadaism demands: 1) The international revolutionary union of all creative and intellectual men and women on the basis of radical Communism; (...) The immediate expropriation of property (socialization) and the communal feeding of all (...) Introduction of the simultaneist poem as a Communist state prayer."&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1913 [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]] challenged individual creativity and redefined art as a nominal rather than an intrinsic object.&lt;ref&gt;Duchamp quoted by Arturo Schwarz."The Complete Works of Marcel Duchamp'. London, Thames and Hudson, 1969, p.33."For me there is something else in addition to yes, no or indifferent – that is, for instance – the absence of investigations of that type. ... I am against the word 'anti' because it's a bit like atheist, as compared to believer. And the atheist is just as much of a religious man as the believer is, and an anti-artist is just as much of an artist as the other artist. Anartist would be much better, if I could change it, instead of anti-artist. Anartist, meaning no artist at all. That would be my conception. I don't mind being an anartist ... What I have in mind is that art may be bad, good or indifferent, but, whatever adjective is used, we must call it art, and bad art is still art in the same way as a bad emotion is still an emotion."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duchamp quoted by [[Dalia Judovitz]]. "Unpacking Duchamp: Art in Transit". Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1995. "No, no the word 'anti' annoys me a little, because whether you are anti or for, it's two sides of the same thing. And I would like to be completely – I don't know what you say – nonexistent, instead of being for or against... The idea of the artist as a sort of superman is comparatively recent. This I was going against. In fact, since I've stopped my artistic activity, I feel that I'm against this attitude of reverence the world has. Art, etymologically speaking, means to 'make.' Everybody is making, not only artists, and maybe in coming centuries there will be a making without the noticing"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tristan Tzara]] indicated: "I am against systems; the most acceptable system is on principle to have none."&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"&gt;{{fr icon}} Jacques-Yves Conrad, [http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/Association/Conrad.htm ''Promenade surréaliste sur la colline de Montmartre''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915053946/http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/Association/Conrad.htm |date=2008-09-15 }}, at the [[University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle]] [http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/ Center for the Study of Surrealism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327041319/http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/ |date=2008-03-27 }}; retrieved April 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Tristan Tzara|Tzara]], who once stated that "[[logic]] is always false",&lt;ref name="ipuranus"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ion Pop, [http://www.revistatribuna.ro/arhiva/tribuna96.pdf "Un urmuzian: Ionathan X.

Originating in [[Russia]] in 1919, [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]] rejected art in its entirety and as a specific activity creating a universal aesthetic&lt;ref&gt;Varvara Stepanova: Lecture on Constructivism, 22 December 1921. In: Peter Noever: Aleksandr M. Rodchenko - Varvara F. Stepanova. The Future Is Our Only Goal. Munich: Prestel, 1991, pp. 174-178. "From here, Constructivism proceeds to the negation of all art in its entirety, and calls into question the necessity of a specific activity of art as creator of a universal aesthetic."&lt;/ref&gt; in favour of practices directed towards social purposes, "useful" to everyday life, such as graphic design, advertising and photography. In 1921, exhibiting at the [[5x5=25|5x5=25 exhibition]], [[Alexander Rodchenko]] created monochromes and proclaimed the end of painting.&lt;ref&gt;"I reduced painting to its logical conclusion and exhibited three canvases: red, blue, and yellow. I affirmed: this is the end of painting." — [[Alexander Rodchenko]].&lt;/ref&gt; For artists of the Russian Revolution, Rodchenko's radical action was full of utopian possibility. It marked the end of art along with the end of bourgeois norms and practices. It cleared the way for the beginning of a new Russian life, a new mode of production, a new culture.&lt;ref&gt;Rodchenko, A. and V. Stepanova (1975) [1920] 'The Programme of the Productivist Group', in Benton and Benton (eds), pp. 91-2. "1. Down with art, long live technical science. 2. Religion is a lie. Art is a lie. 3. Destroy the last remaining attachment of human thought to art. ... 6. The collective art of today is constructive life."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surrealism===
Beginning in the early 1920s, many [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost, with the works being an artifact. [[Surrealism]] as a political force developed unevenly around the world, in some places more emphasis being put on artistic practices, while in others political practises outweighed. In other places still, Surrealist praxis looked to overshadow both the arts and politics. Politically, [[Surrealism]] was ultra-leftist, [[communist]], or [[anarchist]]. The split from Dada has been characterised as a split between anarchists and communists, with the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]] as communist. In 1925, the [[Bureau of Surrealist Research]] declared their affinity for revolutionary politics.&lt;ref&gt;"Declaration of January 27, 1925". [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1925Surrealism.html Modern History Sourcebook: A Surrealist Manifesto, 1925]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s many Surrealists had strongly identified themselves with communism.&lt;ref&gt;"Manifesto for a Free Revolutionary Art"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.generation-online.org/c/fcSurrealism1.html]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Helena. ''Dada Turns Red''. 1990. University of Edinburgh Press. A history of the uneasy relations between Surrealists and Communists from the 1920s through the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; Breton and his comrades supported [[Leon Trotsky]] and his [[International Left Opposition]] for a while, though there was an openness to anarchism that manifested more fully after World War II.

Leader [[André Breton]] was explicit in his assertion that [[Surrealism]] was above all a revolutionary movement. [[André Breton|Breton]] believed the tenets of [[Surrealism]] could be applied in any circumstance of life, and is not merely restricted to the artistic realm.&lt;ref&gt;[[André Breton]]. "The [[Surrealist Manifesto|first manifesto]]". 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; [[André Breton|Breton]]'s followers, along with the [[Communist Party]], were working for the "liberation of man." However, Breton's group refused to prioritize the [[proletarian]] struggle over radical creation such that their struggles with the Party made the late 1920s a turbulent time for both. Many individuals closely associated with [[André Breton|Breton]], notably [[Louis Aragon]], left his group to work more closely with the Communists. In 1929, [[André Breton|Breton]] asked Surrealists to assess their "degree of moral competence", and theoretical refinements included in the second ''[[Surrealist Manifesto|manifeste du surréalisme]]'' excluded anyone reluctant to commit to collective action&lt;ref name="pompidou"&gt;[http://www.cnac-gp.fr/education/ressources/ENS-Surrealistart-EN/ENS-Surrealistart-EN.htm Surrealist Art] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918070327/http://www.cnac-gp.fr/education/ressources/ENS-Surrealistart-EN/ENS-Surrealistart-EN.htm |date=September 18, 2012 }} from [[Centre Pompidou]]. Accessed March 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of World War II the surrealist group led by André Breton decided to explicitly embrace anarchism. In 1952 Breton wrote "It was in the black mirror of anarchism that surrealism first recognised itself."&lt;ref name="anarchosurrealism"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libcom.org/history/1919-1950-the-politics-of-surrealism |title=1919–1950: The politics of Surrealism by Nick Heath |publisher=Libcom.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Letterism and the Situationist International===
{{Situationists |expanded=Concepts}}

Founded in the mid-1940s in France by [[Isidore Isou]], the [[Lettrism|Letterists]] utilised material appropriated from other films, a technique which would subsequently be developed (under the title of '[[détournement]]') in [[Situationist International|Situationist]] films. They would also often supplement the film with live performance, or, through the 'film-debate', directly involve the audience itself in the total experience. The most radical of the [[Lettrism|Letterist]] films, Wolman's ''The Anticoncept'' and [[Guy Debord|Debord]]'s ''Howls for Sade'' abandoned images altogether.

In 1956, recalling the [[infinitesimals]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually, the founder of [[Lettrism]], [[Isidore Isou]], developed the notion of a work of art which, by its very nature, could never be created in reality, but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually. Related to this, and arising out of it, is excoördism, the current incarnation of the Isouian movement, defined as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.

In 1960, [[Isidore Isou]] created supertemporal art: a device for inviting and enabling an audience to participate in the creation of a work of art. In its simplest form, this might involve nothing more than the inclusion of several blank pages in a book, for the reader to add his or her own contributions.

In Japan in the late 1950s, [[Group Kyushu]] was an edgy, experimental and rambunctious art group. They ripped and burned canvasses, stapled corrugated cardboard, nails, nuts, springs, metal drill shavings, and burlap to their works, assembled all kinds of unwieldy junk assemblages, and were best known for covering much of their work in tar. They also occasionally covered their work in urine and excrement. They tried to bring art closer to everyday life, by incorporating objects from daily life into their work, and also by exhibiting and performing their work outside on the street for everyone to see.

Other similar anti-art groups included [http://www.artfact.com/features/viewStyle.cfm?genreRef=K714FO8OVR Neo-Dada] (Neo-Dadaizumu Oganaizazu), [http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/g/gutai Gutai] ([[Gutai]] Bijutsu Kyokai), and Hi-Red-Center. Influenced in various ways by [[L'Art Informel]], these groups and their members worked to foreground material in their work: rather than seeing the art work as representing some remote referent, the material itself and the artists' interaction with it became the main point. The freeing up of gesture was another legacy of L'Art Informel, and the members of Group Kyushu took to it with great verve, throwing, dripping, and breaking material, sometimes destroying the work in the process.

Beginning in the 1950s in France, the [[Letterist International]] and after the [[Situationist International]] developed a [[dialectic]]al viewpoint, seeing their task as ''superseding'' art, abolishing the notion of art as a separate, specialized activity and transforming it so it became part of the fabric of everyday life. From the Situationist's viewpoint, art is [[revolution]]ary or it is nothing. In this way, the Situationists saw their efforts as completing the work of both Dada and [[surrealism]] while abolishing both.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Debord. [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/debord/8.htm " The Society of the Spectacle"]. Thesis 187 and 191. 1967. Translation by [[Ken Knabb]] in 2002."The ''positive'' significance of the modern decomposition and destruction of all art is that the language of communication has been lost. The ''negative'' implication of this development is that a common language can no longer take the form of the unilateral conclusions that characterized the art of historical societies — ''belated'' portrayals of ''someone else's'' dialogueless life which accepted this lack as inevitable — but must now be found in a praxis that unifies direct activity with its own appropriate language.
The point is to actually participate in the community of dialogue and the game with time that up till now have merely been ''represented'' by poetic and artistic works." "Dadaism and surrealism were the two currents that marked the end of modern art. Though they were only partially conscious of it, they were contemporaries of the last great offensive of the revolutionary proletarian movement, and the defeat of that movement, which left them trapped within the very artistic sphere whose decrepitude they had denounced, was the fundamental reason for their immobilization. Dadaism and surrealism were historically linked yet also opposed to each other. This opposition involved the most important and radical contributions of the two movements, but it also revealed the internal inadequacy of their one-sided critiques. Dadaism sought to ''abolish art without realizing it''; surrealism sought to ''realize art without abolishing it''. The critical position since developed by the ''situationists'' has shown that the abolition and realization of art are inseparable aspects of a single ''transcendence of art''."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Internationale Situationist (no. 1, Paris, June 1958) "Art need no longer be an account of past sensations. It can become the direct organization of more highly evolved sensations. It is a question of producing ourselves, not things that enslave us."&lt;/ref&gt;
The situationists renounced the making of art entirely.&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt;

The members of the [[Situationist International]] liked to think they were probably the most radical,&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Kaufman. "The Columbia history of twentieth-century French thought". Editor: Lawrence D. Kritzman, Columbia University Press, 2007, p. 104. "In the view of some (including the principal protagonists of the movement themselves), Situationism was the century's finest and most radical form of subversion. It is claimed to have been at the heart of the events of May 1968, whose spirit it embodied, with its radical critique of all forms of alienation imposed by capitalist society (renamed the "society of spectacle" by the Situationists)".&lt;/ref&gt; politicized,&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt; well organized, and theoretically productive anti-art movement, reaching their apex with the student protests and [[general strike]] of [[May 1968 in France]], a view endorsed by others including the academic [[Martin Puchner]].&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt;

In 1959 [[Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio]] proposed [[Industrial Painting]] as an "industrial-inflationist art"&lt;ref&gt;[[Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio]]. [http://www.notbored.org/gallizio.html Manifesto of Industrial Painting: For a unitary applied art]. ''[[Notizie Arti Figurative]]'' No. 9 (1959). In French: ''[[Situationist International|Internationale Situationniste]]'' no.3 (1959). In English: [[Molly Klein]] translated the [[original]] Italian version into English (1997). "The machine may very well be the appropriate instrument for the creation of an industrial-inflationist art, based on the Anti-Patent; the new industrial culture will be strictly "Made Amongst People" or not at all! The time of the Scribes is over."(...) "When thousands of painters who today labor at the non-sense of detail will have the possibilities which machines offer, there will be no more giant stamps, called paintings to satisfy the investment of value, but thousands of kilometers of fabric offered in the streets, in markets, for barter, allowing millions of people to enjoy them and exciting the experience of arrangement."&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to Dada, in the 1960s, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an anti-art sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. Fluxus artists used their minimal performances to blur the distinction between life and art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolf Vostell]], 1972 (Postcard). "[[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp]] has qualified the object into art. I have qualified life into art."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ben Vautier]]. [http://radicalart.info/concept/ArtAgainstArt/Ben/index.html "Pas d'Art" (No art).] 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 [[Henry Flynt]] began to campaign for an anti-art position.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Oren (1993) Anti-Art as the End of Cultural History, [[Performing Arts Journal]], volume 15, issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Flynt wanted [[avant-garde]] [[art]] to become superseded by the terms of ''veramusement'' and ''brend'' – [[neologism]]s meaning approximately pure [[recreation]].

In 1963 [[George Maciunas]] advocated revolution, "living art, anti-art" and "non art reality to be grasped by all peoples".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Maciunas]]. [http://www.artnotart.com/fluxus/gmaciunas-manifesto.html Fluxus Manifesto], 1963. "Purge the world of bourgeois sickness, "intellectual", professional and commercialized culture, purge the world of dead art, imitation, artificial art, abstract art, illusionistic art, mathematical art, – purge the world of "Europanism"! [...] PROMOTE A REVOLUTIONARY FLOOD AND TIDE IN ART, [...] promote NON ART REALITY to be grasped by all peoples, not only critics, dilettantes and professionals ... FUSE the cadres of cultural, social &amp; political revolutionaries into united front &amp; action."&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Maciunas|Maciunas]] strived to uphold his stated aims of demonstrating the artist's 'non-professional status...his dispensability and inclusiveness' and that 'anything can be art and anyone can do it.'&lt;ref&gt;A 1965 Inventory list by Maciunas, quoted in Mr Fluxus, p88&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, the Dada-influenced [[art group]] [[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]] declared that revolutionary art should be "an integral part of life, as in primitive society, and not an appendage to wealth".&lt;ref name="Ben Morea: art and anarchism"&gt;Hinderer, Eve. [http://www.16beavergroup.org/monday/archives/001031print.html Ben Morea: art and anarchism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425191200/http://www.16beavergroup.org/monday/archives/001031print.html |date=April 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Black Mask disrupted cultural events in New York by giving made up flyers of art events to the homeless with the lure of free drinks.&lt;ref name="The Assault on Culture 1"&gt;[[Stewart Home]]. [http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/sp/assault.htm "The Assault on Culture: Utopian currents from Lettrisme to Class War"]. Introduction to the Lithuanian edition. (Ist edition Aporia Press and Unpopular Books, London 1988.) {{ISBN|0-948518-88-X}}. "In the sixties Black Mask disrupted reified cultural events in New York by making up flyers giving the dates, times and location of art events and giving these out to the homeless with the lure of the free drink that was on offer to the bourgeoisie rather than the lumpen proletariat; I reused the ruse just as effectively in London in the 1990s to disrupt literary events."&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers|Motherfuckers]] were to grow out of a combination of Black Mask and another group called Angry Arts.

The BBC aired an interview with Duchamp conducted by Joan Bakewell in 1966 which expressed some of Duchamps more explicit Anti-Art ideas.
Duchamp compared art with religion, whereby he stated that he wished to do away with art the same way many have done away with religion. Duchamp goes on to explain to the interviewer that "the word art etymologically means to do", that art means activity of any kind, and that it is our society that creates "purely artificial" distinctions of being an artist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hn5f4u3PUVoC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq=bbc+1966+interview+duchamp+joan+bakewell&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=H3EwaV7Wt5&amp;sig=btLMQ2GJA3YOwZIPQNU-Oe0KFRg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9bjcUJiqJaKN0wXCk4DAAw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Marcel Duchamp: Artist of the Century] edited by Rudolf E.

During the 1970s, [[King Mob]] was responsible for various attacks on art galleries. According to the philosopher Roger Taylor the concept of art is not universal but is an invention of bourgeois ideology helping to promote this social order. He compares it to a cancer that colonises other forms of life so that it becomes difficult to distinguish one from the other.&lt;ref name=Art_Is_Like_Cancer/&gt;

[[Stewart Home]] called for an Art Strike between 1990 and 1993. Unlike earlier art-strike proposals such as that of [[Gustav Metzger]] in the 1970s, it was not intended as an opportunity for artists to seize control of the means of distributing their own work, but rather as an exercise in propaganda and psychic warfare aimed at smashing the entire art world rather than just the gallery system. As [[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]] had done in the 1960s, [[Stewart Home]] disrupted cultural events in London in the 1990s by giving made up flyers of literary events to the homeless with the lure of free drinks.&lt;ref name="The Assault on Culture 1"/&gt;

The [[K Foundation]] was an art foundation that published a series of [[Situationist International|Situationist]]-inspired press adverts and extravagant subversions in the art world. Most notoriously, when their plans to use [[banknotes]] as part of a work of art fell through, they burnt a million [[pound sterling|pounds]] in cash.

[[Punk visual art|Punk]] has developed anti-art positions. Some "industrial music" bands describe their work as a form of "cultural terrorism" or as a form of "anti-art". The term is also used to describe other intentionally provocative art forms, such as [[nonsense verse]].

==As art==

Paradoxically, most forms of anti-art have gradually been completely accepted by the art establishment as normal and conventional forms of art.&lt;ref&gt;Paul N. Humble. "Anti-Art and the Concept of Art". In: "A companion to art theory". Editors: Paul Smith and Carolyn Wilde, Wiley-Blackwell, 2002, p. 246. "the readymade has been appropriated as a theoretical paradigm in much contemporary art-school theory."&lt;/ref&gt; Even the movements which rejected art with the most virulence are now collected by the most prestigious cultural institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Gallix. [http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=20090416120529166 "The resurrection of Guy Debord".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704124307/http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=20090416120529166 |date=2009-07-04 }} ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 March 2009. "Guy-Ernest Debord would be spinning in his grave – had he not been cremated following his suicide in 1994. The arch-rebel who prided himself on fully deserving society's "universal hatred" has now officially been recognised as a "national treasure" in his homeland. The French government has duly stepped in to prevent Yale University from acquiring his personal archives (...) It's difficult to convey how bizarre it is to hear Christine Albanel – Sarkozy's minister of culture – describing the revolutionary Debord as 'one of the last great French intellectuals' of the second half of the 20th century."&lt;/ref&gt;

Duchamp's readymades are still regarded as anti-art by the [[Stuckism|Stuckists]],&lt;ref name=tate/&gt; who also say that anti-art has become conformist, and describe themselves as [[anti-anti-art]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuck on the Turner Prize"/&gt;

So it seems appropriate to begin by talking about the greatest English philosopher, John Locke." Flew, Antony. "[https://www.mises.org/article.aspx?Id=810&amp;FS=Locke+Versus+Rawls+on+Equality Locke versus Rawls on Equality]" ''Mises''. 24 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[philosopher]]. Belonging to the [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[Evidentialism|evidentialist]] schools of thought, Flew was most notable for his work related to the [[philosophy of religion]]. During the course of his career he taught at the universities of [[Oxford University|Oxford]], [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]], [[University of Keele|Keele]] and [[University of Reading|Reading]], and at [[York University]] in Toronto.

For much of his career Flew was known as a strong advocate of [[atheism]], arguing that one should [[presuppose]] atheism until [[empirical evidence]] of a God surfaces.&lt;ref name=Skeptical&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skeptical-science.com/people/antony-flew-change-mind/ |title=Antony Flew – did he really change his mind? |publisher=[[Skeptical Science]] |date=25 May 2014 |accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticised the idea of [[afterlife|life after death]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/antony_flew/survival.html | title = Could We Survive Our Own Deaths? | first = Anthony | last = Flew | publisher = Internet Infidels | year = 1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Skeptical /&gt; the [[free will]] defence to the [[problem of evil]],&lt;ref name=Skeptical /&gt; and the meaningfulness of the concept of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/antony_flew/theologyandfalsification.html | title = Theology &amp; Falsification: A Golden Jubilee Celebration | first = Anthony | last = Flew | publisher = Internet Infidels | year = 2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Skeptical /&gt; In 2003 he was one of the signatories of the [[Humanism and Its Aspirations|Humanist Manifesto III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers |title=Notable Signers |publisher=American Humanist Association |work=Humanism and Its Aspirations |accessdate=28 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005105825/http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers |archivedate=5 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2004 he changed his position, to acknowledge the existence of an [[Divine Watchmaker|Intelligent Creator]] of the [[universe]],&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |last=Grimes |first=William |date=2010-04-16 |title=Antony Flew, Philosopher and Ex-Atheist, Dies at 87 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/17/arts/17flew.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2018-02-21 |quote=In “There Is a God” he explained that he now believed in a supreme intelligence, removed from human affairs but responsible for the intricate workings of the universe. In other words, the [[Divine Watchmaker]] imagined by [[Deism|deists]] like [[Isaac Newton]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;br&gt; In a letter to The Sunday Telegraph of London in 2004, he described “the God in whose existence I have belatedly come to believe” as “most emphatically not the eternally rewarding and eternally torturing God of either Christianity or Islam but the [[Aristotelian theology|God of Aristotle]] that he would have defined — had Aristotle actually produced a definition of his (and my) God — as the first initiating and sustaining cause of the universe.”}}&lt;/ref&gt; shocking his fellow colleagues and atheists.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; In order to further clarify his personal concept of God, Flew openly made an allegiance to [[deism]],&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |last=Crawley |first=William |date=2010-04-16 |title=Antony Flew: the atheist who changed his mind |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ni/2010/04/antony_flew_the_atheist_who_ch.html |work=[[BBC]] |access-date=2018-02-20 |quote=In some interviews, and in subsequent publications, Flew made it clear that he had not become a Christian; he had moved from atheism to a form of deism. This is important: it is a mistake to claim that Flew embraced classical theism in any substantial form; rather, he came to believe merely that an intelligent orderer of the universe existed. He did not believe that this "being" had any further agency in the universe, and he maintained his opposition to the vast majority of doctrinal positions adopted by the global faiths, such as belief in the after-life, or a divine being who actively cares for or loves the universe, or the resurrection of Christ, and argued for the idea of an "[[Aristotelian theology|Aristotelian God]]". He explained that he, like [[Socrates]], had simply followed the evidence, and the new evidence from [[science]] and [[natural theology]] made it possible to rationally advance belief in an intelligent being who ordered the universe. In 2006, he even added his name to a petition calling for the inclusion of [[Intelligent design|intelligent design theory]] on the UK science curriculum.}}&lt;/ref&gt; more specifically a belief in the [[Aristotelian theology|Aristotelian God]],&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; and dismissed on many occasions a hypothetical conversion to Christianity or any other religion.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; He stated that in keeping his lifelong commitment to go where the evidence leads, he now believed in the existence of a God.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;{{Sfn | Habermas | 2004}}

In 2007 a book outlining his reasons for changing his position, ''There is a God: How the World's Most Notorious Atheist Changed His Mind'' was written by Flew in collaboration with Roy Abraham Varghese. The book (and Flew's conversion to Deism) has been the subject of controversy, following an article in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' alleging that Flew's intellect had declined due to [[Dementia|senility]], and that the book was primarily the work of Varghese;&lt;ref name=Skeptical /&gt;&lt;ref name=Oppenheimer&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/magazine/04Flew-t.html | title = The Turning of an Atheist | first = Mark | last = Oppenheimer | newspaper = The New York Times Magazine | date = 11 April 2007 | accessdate = 23 February 2018 |quote=As he himself conceded, he had not written his book.&lt;br&gt; “This is really Roy’s doing,” he said, before I had even figured out a polite way to ask. “He showed it to me, and I said O.K. I’m too old for this kind of work!”&lt;br&gt; When I asked Varghese, he freely admitted that the book was his idea and that he had done all the original writing for it. But he made the book sound like more of a joint effort — slightly more, anyway. “There was stuff he had written before, and some of that was adapted to this,” Varghese said. “There is stuff he’d written to me in correspondence, and I organized a lot of it. And I had interviews with him. So those three elements went into it. Oh, and I exposed him to certain authors and got his views on them. We pulled it together. And then to make it more reader-friendly, [[HarperCollins]] had a more popular author go through it.”&lt;br&gt; So even the ghostwriter had a ghostwriter: Bob Hostetler, an [[evangelical]] [[pastor]] and author from [[Ohio]], rewrote many passages, especially in the section that narrates Flew’s childhood. With three authors, how much Flew was left in the book?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flew himself specifically denied this, stating that the book represented his views, and he acknowledged that due to his age Varghese had done most of the actual work of writing the book.{{Sfn | Flew | 2007}}

He was also known for the development of the [[no true Scotsman]] fallacy, and his debate on [[retrocausality]] with [[Michael Dummett]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Life and career ==
Flew, the son of [[Methodism|Methodist]] minister/theologian [[Robert Newton Flew]] (1886–1962) and his wife Winifred ''née'' Garrard (1887–1982), was born in [[London]]. He was educated at [[St Faith's School]], [[Cambridge]] followed by [[Kingswood School]], Bath. He is said to have concluded by the age of 15 that there was no God.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fwponline.cc/v27n1/reviewone_editor.html&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Second World War he studied Japanese at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], [[University of London]], and was a [[Royal Air Force]] intelligence officer. After a period with the Inter-Services Topographical Department in Oxford, he was posted to [[Bletchley Park]] in June 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael (2000), ''The Emperor's Codes'', Bantam, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Flew achieved a first class degree in ''[[Literae Humaniores]]'' at [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]] (1947). He also won the John Locke Scholarship in Mental Philosophy in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;http://infidels.org/library/modern/antony_flew/flew-bio.html&lt;/ref&gt; Flew was a graduate student of [[Gilbert Ryle]], prominent in [[ordinary language philosophy]]. Both Flew and Ryle were among many Oxford philosophers fiercely criticised in [[Ernest Gellner]]'s book ''Words and Things'' (1959).  A 1954 debate with [[Michael Dummett]] over [[backward causation]] was an early highlight in Flew's career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-backwards/ | title= Backward Causation | work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |date=29 August 2005 | first =Jan | last = Faye}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a year, 1949–50, Flew was a lecturer in philosophy at [[Christ Church, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Who's Who 1974"&gt;''Who's Who'', 1974, London : A. &amp; C. Black, 1974, p. 1118&lt;/ref&gt; From 1950 to 1954 he was a lecturer at the [[University of Aberdeen]], and from 1954 to 1971 he was a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Keele]].&lt;ref name="Who's Who 1974"/&gt; He held a professorship at the University of Calgary, 1972–73.&lt;ref name="Who's Who 1974"/&gt; Between 1973 and 1983 he was professor of philosophy at the [[University of Reading]]. At this time, he developed one of his most famous arguments, the [[No true Scotsman]] fallacy in his 1975 book, ''Thinking About Thinking''. Upon his retirement, Flew took up a half-time post for a few years at [[York University]], Toronto.

Politically Flew was a [[libertarian]]-leaning conservative and wrote articles for ''[[The Journal of Libertarian Studies]]''. His name appears on letterheads into 1992 as a Vice-President of the [[Conservative Monday Club]], and he held the same position in the [[Western Goals Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;''Labour Research'', November 1988, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the signatories to a letter in ''The Times'' along with Lord Sudeley, Sir [[Alfred Sherman]], and Dr. [[Harvey Ward]], on behalf of the Institute, "applauding [[Alfredo Cristiani]]'s statesmanship" and calling for his government's success in defeating the Cuban and Nicaraguan-backed communist [[FMLN]] terrorists in [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 29 September 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flew married on 28 June 1952. He had two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| archivedate = 10 December 2003 | url = http://www.sit.wisc.edu/~debate/flewbio.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031210084647/http://www.sit.wisc.edu/~debate/flewbio.html | publisher =Wisconsin University | title = Flew's biography | date= 10 December 2003 |accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flew died on 8 April 2010, while nursed in an Extended Care Facility in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], England, suffering from [[dementia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/10-04-21/#feature | title = Antony Flew, 1923–2010 – Following the Argument Wherever it Leads | publisher = Skeptic | newspaper = eSkeptic | date = 21 April 2010 | first = Kenneth | last = Grubbs}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-Flew-obit"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/17/arts/17flew.html | title =Antony Flew, Philosopher and Ex-Atheist, Dies at 87 |work= The New York Times | date=16 April 2010 | accessdate =23 July 2011 | last =Grimes | first = William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While an undergraduate, Flew attended the weekly meetings of [[C. S. Lewis]]'s [[Socratic Club]] fairly regularly.  Although he found Lewis to be "an eminently reasonable man" and "by far the most powerful of Christian apologists for the sixty or more years following his founding of that club", he was not persuaded by Lewis's [[argument from morality]] as found in ''[[Mere Christianity]]''. Flew also criticised several of the other philosophical proofs for God's existence. He concluded that the [[ontological argument]] in particular failed because it is based on the premise that the concept of Being can be derived from the concept of Goodness. Only the scientific forms of the [[teleological argument]] ultimately impressed Flew as decisive.{{Sfn | Habermas | 2004 | p = [http://www.biola.edu/antonyflew/page2.cfm 2]}}

During the time of his involvement in the [[Socratic Club]], Flew also wrote the article "Theology and Falsification", which argued that claims about God were merely vacuous where they could not be tested for truth or falsehood. Though initially published in an undergraduate journal, the article came to be widely reprinted and discussed.

Flew was also critical of the idea of [[afterlife|life after death]] and the [[free will]] defence to the [[problem of evil]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In 1998, he debated Christian philosopher [[William Lane Craig]] over the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Flew | first1 = Antony | format = Google You tube video | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GIvzeBtiwg | title = Does God Exist? | type = debate | first2 = William Lane | last2 = Craig | publisher = University of Wisconsin | date = 28 January 1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Atheism and deism ==

=== ''The Presumption of Atheism'' ===

One of Antony Flew's most influential professional works was his 1976 ''The Presumption of Atheism''{{Sfn | Flew | 1984}} in which Flew forwarded the proposition that the question of God's existence should begin with the presumption of atheism:&lt;blockquote&gt;"What I want to examine is the contention that the debate about the existence of God should properly begin from the presumption of atheism, that the onus of proof must lie upon the theist. The word 'atheism', however, has in this contention to be construed unusually. Whereas nowadays the usual meaning of 'atheist' in English is 'someone who asserts that there is no such being as God, I want the word to be understood not [[Negative and positive atheism|positively but negatively]]... in this interpretation an atheist becomes: not someone who positively asserts the non-existence of God; but someone who is simply not a theist.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The introduction of this new interpretation of the word 'atheism' may appear to be a piece of perverse Humpty-Dumptyism, going arbitrarily against established common usage. 'Whyever', it could be asked, don't you make it not the presumption of atheism but the presumption of agnosticism?&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Flew-The-Presumption-of-Atheism.pdf|title=The Presumption of Atheism|last=Flew|first=Anthony|publisher=|year=1976|isbn=|location=Common Sense Atheism|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Flew's proposal to change his profession's use of the term atheism saw limited acceptance in the 20th century, but in the early 21st century Flew's negative sense of 'atheism' came to be forwarded more commonly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.is-there-a-god.info/blog/belief/atheists-agnostics-and-theists/|title=Atheists, agnostics and theists|last=|first=|date=|website=Is there a God?|publisher=|access-date=28 September 2016|quote=But it is common these days to find atheists who define the term to mean “without theism”...

===Revised views===

====Conversion to deism====
On several occasions, starting in 2001, rumors circulated claiming that Flew had converted from atheism to deism.  Flew denied these rumours on the [[Secular Web]] website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Sec Web | url = http://www.secweb.org/asset.asp?AssetID=138 | title = Sorry to Disappoint, but I'm Still an Atheist! | first = Antony | last = Flew | newspaper = [[Internet Infidels]] | date = 31 August 2001 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050830092752/http://www.secweb.org/asset.asp?AssetID=138 | archivedate = 30 August 2005 | df = dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2004 Flew and [[Gary Habermas]], his friend and philosophical adversary, took part in and conducted a dialogue on the resurrection at [[California Polytechnic State University|California Polytechnic State University – San Luis Obispo]]. During a couple of telephone discussions shortly after that dialogue, Flew explained to Habermas that he was considering becoming a theist. While Flew did not change his position at that time, he concluded that certain philosophical and scientific considerations were causing him to do some serious rethinking. He characterized his position as that of atheism standing in tension with several huge question marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biola.edu/antonyflew/ |title= Atheist Becomes Theist |publisher= [[Biola University]] | accessdate = 10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2004 interview (published 9 December), Flew, then 81 years old, said that he had become a deist.{{Sfn | Habermas | 2004 | p = 6}} In the article Flew states that he has renounced his long-standing espousal of [[atheism]] by endorsing a [[deism]] of the sort that [[Thomas Jefferson]] advocated ("While reason, mainly in the form of arguments to design, assures us that there is a God, there is no room either for any supernatural revelation of that God or for any transactions between that God and individual human beings").  Flew stated that "the most impressive arguments for God’s existence are those that are supported by recent scientific discoveries" and that "the argument to [[Intelligent Design]] is enormously stronger than it was when I first met it". The argument of ID is that evidenced objects and physical concepts are either too simple or too complex to be simply natural, whichever of the two extremes one chooses to be the hallmark of design by an outside intelligence. He also answered in the affirmative to Habermas's question, "So of the major theistic arguments, such as the cosmological, teleological, moral, and ontological, the only really impressive ones that you take to be decisive are the scientific forms of teleology?". He supported the idea of an [[Aristotelian view of God|Aristotelian God]] with "the characteristics of power and also intelligence", stating that the evidence for it was stronger than ever before. He rejected the idea of an afterlife, of God as the source of good (he explicitly states that God has created "a lot of" evil), and of the [[resurrection of Jesus]] as a historical fact, although he has allowed a short chapter arguing in favor of Joshua's/Jesus' resurrection to be added into his latest book.{{Sfn | Habermas | 2004 | p = 6}}

Flew was particularly hostile to [[Islam]], and said it is "best described in a [[Marxist philosophy|Marxian]] way as the uniting and justifying ideology of [[Arab imperialism]]."{{Sfn | Habermas | 2004 | p = 6}}  In a December 2004 interview he said: "I'm thinking of a God very different from the [[God in Christianity|God of the Christian]] and far and away from the [[God in Islam|God of Islam]], because both are depicted as omnipotent Oriental despots, cosmic [[Saddam Hussein]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.mail-archive.com/media-dakwah@yahoogroups.com/msg01064.html | title = Atheist Philosopher, 81, Now Believes in God | first = Richard N. | last = Ostling | author-link = Richard N. Ostling | publisher = Mail archive | newspaper = [[Associated Press]] | date = 10 December 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy over his position====
In October 2004 (before the December publication of the Flew–Habermas interview), in a letter written to the historian and atheist [[Richard Carrier]] of the Secular Web Flew stated that he was a deist, and wrote "I think we need here a fundamental distinction between the God of [[Aristotle]] or [[Spinoza]] and the Gods of the Christian and the Islamic Revelations."&lt;ref name=carrier&gt;{{cite web|author1=Richard Carrier|authorlink1=Richard Carrier|title=Antony Flew Considers God...Sort Of|url=http://infidels.org/kiosk/article/antony-flew-considers-godsort-of-369.html|website=The Secular Web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521120257/http://infidels.org/kiosk/article/antony-flew-considers-godsort-of-369.html|archivedate=21 May 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flew also said: "My one and only piece of relevant evidence [for an Aristotelian God] is the apparent impossibility of providing a naturalistic theory of the origin from DNA of the first reproducing species... [In fact] the only reason which I have for beginning to think of believing in a First Cause god is the impossibility of providing a naturalistic account of the origin of the first reproducing organisms."&lt;ref name=carrier /&gt;

In the months following the Habermas interview, Flew contradicted some statements made in the interview and retracted others. When asked in December 2004 by Duncan Crary of Humanist Network News if he still stood by the argument presented in ''The Presumption of Atheism'', Flew replied he did but he also restated his position as deist: "I'm quite happy to believe in an inoffensive inactive god."  When asked by Crary whether or not he has kept up with the most recent science and theology, he responded with "Certainly not," stating that there is simply too much to keep up with.  Flew also denied that there was any truth to the rumours of 2001 and 2003 that he had converted to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Duncan Crary|authorlink1=Duncan Crary|title=No longer atheist, Flew stands by "Presumption of Atheism"|url=http://humaniststudies.org/enews/index.html?id=172&amp;article=0|website=Humanist Studies}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to Carrier of 29 December 2004 Flew retracted his statement that a deity or a "super-intelligence" was the only good explanation for the origin of life and the complexity of nature:

{{Quote | I now realise that I have made a fool of myself by believing that there were no presentable theories of the development of inanimate matter up to the first living creature capable of reproduction.}}

He blamed his error on being "misled" by the (supposed) fact that [[Richard Dawkins]] had "never been reported as referring to any promising work on the production of a theory of the development of living matter.&lt;ref name=carrier /&gt;

His 2007 book ''There is a God'' (see below) revisited the question, however, and questioned contemporary models: "the latest work I have seen shows that the present physical universe gives too little time for these theories of abiogenesis to get the job done."&lt;ref name = "ThereIsAGod"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Antony Flew|author2=Roy Abraham Varghese|ASIN=B0076O7KX8 | title = There is a God: How the World's Most Notorious Atheist Changed His Mind | place = New York | publisher = Harper One | year = 2007 | page = 124}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He added: "The philosophical question that has not been answered in origin-of-life studies is this: How can a universe of mindless matter produce beings with intrinsic ends, self-replication capabilities, and 'coded chemistry'? Here we are not dealing with biology, but an entirely different category of problem".&lt;ref name="ThereIsAGod" /&gt; Geneticists, Evolutionary Biologists, and Astrophysicists wholly deny the idea that any current holes in modern theories and models of abiogenesis directly point to any primordial replicative DNAs needing to be designed by specific or vague postulated "powerful intelligences". 
 
The work of the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] nuclear physicist [[Gerald Schroeder]] had been influential in Flew's new belief, but Flew told Carrier that he had not read any of the critiques of Schroeder that Carrier referred him to.

However, in spring 2005 when atheist Raymond Bradley, emeritus professor of philosophy at [[Simon Fraser University]] and a member of the editorial board of ''The Open Society'' journal, wrote an open letter to Flew accusing him of not "check[ing] the veracity of [Schroeder's] claims before swallowing them whole," Flew responded strongly to that charge in a letter published in the same journal in summer 2006, describing the content of Bradley's letter "extraordinarily offensive" and the accusation made by him as an "egregiously offensive charge"; he also implied that Bradley was a "secularist bigot," and suggested that he should follow Socrates's advice (as scripted in Plato's ''Republic'') of "follow[ing] the argument wherever it leads."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Antony | last = Flew | url = http://www.nzarh.org.nz/journal/2006v79n4sum.pdf | title = A response to Raymond Bradley | journal = The Open Society | volume = 79 | number = 4 |date=Spring 2006 | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other prominent atheists, such as [[Richard Dawkins]], suggested Flew's deism was a form of [[God of the gaps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.mukto-mona.com/Articles/mehul/atheist_humanist.htm |title=Humanists, Atheists Look to Higher Global Profile | first = Robert | last = Evans |publisher= Mukto-mona |accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning other critics (both the Christians when he was an Atheist, and the Atheists when he decided to become an Aristotelian Diest) Flew said in December 2004:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Stuard | last = Wavell | type = article | title = In the beginning there was something | newspaper = The Sunday Times | date = 19 December 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote | I have been denounced by my fellow unbelievers for stupidity, betrayal, senility and everything you can think of and none of them have read a word that I have ever written.}}

====Restatement of position====
A letter on evolution and theology which Flew published in the August/September 2004 issue of ''[[Philosophy Now]]'' magazine closed with, "Anyone who should happen to want to know what I myself now believe will have to wait until the publication, promised for early 2005, by Prometheus of Amherst, NY of the final edition of my ''God and Philosophy'' with a new introduction of it as ‘an historical relic’."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.philosophynow.org/issue47/47flew.htm | type = letter | first = Antony | last = Flew | title = Darwinism and Theology | journal = Philosophy Now | issue = 47}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The preface of ''God and Philosophy'' states that the publisher and Flew went through a total of four versions (each extensively peer-reviewed) before coming up with one that satisfied them both. The introduction raises ten matters that came about since the original 1966 edition. Flew states that any book to follow ''God and Philosophy'' will have to take into account these ideas when considering the philosophical case for the existence of God:{{Sfn | Flew | 1966}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}

# A novel definition of "God" by [[Richard Swinburne]]
# The case for the existence of the Christian God by Swinburne in the book ''Is There a God?''
# The Church of England's change in doctrine on the eternal punishment of Hell
# The question of whether there was only one [[big bang]] and if time began with it
# The question of [[Multiverse|multiple universes]]
# The [[Fine-tuned universe|fine-tuning]] argument
# The question of whether there is a naturalistic account for the development of living matter from non-living matter
# The question of whether there is a naturalistic account for non-reproducing living matter developing into a living creature capable of reproduction
# The concept of an ''Intelligent Orderer'' as explained in the book ''The Wonder of the World: A Journey from Modern Science to the Mind of God'' by Roy Abraham Varghese
# An extension of an Aristotelian/Deist concept of God that can be reached through natural theology, which was developed by [[David Conway (academic)|David Conway]].

In an interview with [[Joan Bakewell]] for [[BBC Radio 4]] in March 2005, Flew rejected the [[Fine-tuned universe|fine-tuning]] argument as a conclusive proof: "I don't think it proves anything but that it is entirely reasonable for people who already have a belief in a creating God to regard this as confirming evidence. And it's a point of argument which I think is very important – to see that what is reasonable for people to do in the face of new evidence depends on what they previously had good reason to believe." He also said it appeared that there had been progress made regarding the naturalistic origins of [[DNA]]. However, he restated his deism, with the usual provisos that his God is not the God of any of the revealed religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]] | contribution-url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/programmes/belief/scripts/antony_flew.html | title = Belief | contribution = Professor Antony Flew | publisher = BBC | type = interview | date = 22 March 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same interview, Flew was asked whether he was retracting belief in an Aristotelian God, but answered no.

One month later, Flew told ''[[Christianity Today]]'' that although he was not on the road to becoming a Christian convert, he reaffirmed his deism: "Since the beginning of my philosophical life I have followed the policy of Plato's [[Socrates]]: We must follow the argument wherever it leads."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = James A | last = Beverley | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/april/29.80.html | title = Thinking Straighter | newspaper = Christianity Today | date = 29 April 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2006, Flew joined 11 other academics in urging the British government to teach [[intelligent design]] in the state schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1265412.ece | title = Creationism gains foothold in schools | publisher = Times Online | newspaper = [[The Times]] |  place = UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, in an interview with [[Benjamin Wiker]], Flew said again that his deism was the result of his "growing empathy with the insight of [[Einstein]] and other noted scientists that there had to be an Intelligence behind the integrated complexity of the physical Universe" and "my own insight that the integrated complexity of life itself – which is far more complex than the physical Universe – can only be explained in terms of an Intelligent Source." He also restated that he was not a Christian theist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Dr. Benjamin | last = Wiker | url = http://www.tothesource.org/10_30_2007/10_30_2007.htm | title = Exclusive Flew Interview | publisher = To the source | date = 30 October 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book with Varghese and authorship controversy===
In 2007, Flew published a book titled ''There is a God'', which was listed as having Roy Abraham Varghese as its co-author. Shortly after the book was released, the New York Times published an article by [[historian of religion]] Mark Oppenheimer, who stated that Varghese had been almost entirely responsible for writing the book, and that Flew was in a serious state of [[Dementia|mental decline]],&lt;ref name=Oppenheimer/&gt; having great difficulty remembering key figures, ideas, and events relating to the debate covered in the book.&lt;ref name=Oppenheimer/&gt; His book praises several philosophers (like [[Brian Leftow]], [[John A. Leslie|John Leslie]] and [[Paul Davies]]), but Flew failed to remember their work during Oppenheimer's interview.

A further article by [[Anthony Gottlieb]] noted a strong difference in style between the passages giving Flew's biography, and those laying out the case for a god, with the latter including [[American English|Americanisms]] such as "beverages", "vacation" and "candy". He came to the same conclusion as Oppenheimer, and stated that "Far from strengthening the case for the existence of God, [the book] rather weakens the case for the existence of Antony Flew".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/books/review/Gottlieb-t.html?_r=1&amp;ref=review&amp;oref=slogin | title = I’m a Believer | first = Anthony | last = Gottlieb | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 23 December 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Varghese replied with a letter disputing this view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/books/review/Letters-t.html?ref=todayspaper | title = Letter to the Editor | first = Roy | last = Varghese | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 13 January 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flew later released a statement through his publisher stating:
{{Quote |sign=|source=|I have rebutted these criticisms in the following statement: My name is on the book and it represents exactly my opinions. I would not have a book issued in my name that I do not 100 percent agree with. I needed someone to do the actual writing because I’m 84 and that was Roy Varghese’s role. The idea that someone manipulated me because I'm old is exactly wrong. I may be old but it is hard to manipulate me. This is my book and it represents my thinking."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = Publishers’ weekly | url = http://www.publishersweekly.com/index.asp?layout=articlePrint&amp;articleID=CA6501078 | title = Times Magazine Piece on Former Atheist Kicks Up Controversy}}{{dead link|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} An audio commentary by [[William Lane Craig]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rfmedia.org/blog/index.php?id=4 |title=Dr. Craig's Current Events Audio Blog |publisher=RF Media |date=11 November 2007 |accessdate=10 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211132928/http://www.rfmedia.org/blog/index.php?id=4 |archivedate=11 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; concurs with this position, but [[Richard Carrier]] disputed this view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first =Richard | last = Carrier |url = http://richardcarrier.blogspot.com/2007/12/craig-annoyed.html |title= Craig the Annoyed | type = [[World wide web]] log | publisher= Google | format = Blogger |date= 27 December 2007 |accessdate= 10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, Flew stated his position once again, in a letter to a fellow of the [[Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship]].{{Sfn | Flew | 2007}}

Christian writer Regis Nicoll claims that "Moreover, in a signed, handwritten letter (a copy of which I now have) sent to Roy Varghese, the legendary philosopher reaffirmed his conversion while criticising Oppenheimer for drawing attention away from the book’s central argument: the collapse of rationalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.crosswalk.com/blogs/rnicoll/11562658/ |title=From UnChristian to Christian |publisher=Crosswalk | accessdate = 10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that "Even Mark Oppenheimer described the ex-atheist 'flaunt[ing] his allegiance to deism' in May 2006 to a Christian audience at Biola University."

Perhaps most definitively, Christian apologist Anthony Horvath corresponded with Antony Flew before it was publicly known there would even be a book. In 2010, he published his letters. The letters contain Flew's description of the outline of the book, his [[Einstein's god|Deism in the pattern of Einstein]]'s, and his high praise of [[N.T. Wright]]'s arguments for Christianity. All of these elements are present in the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://antonyflew.us/flew-horvath-correspondence/11.htm |title=The Flew-Horvath Correspondence |publisher=antonyflew.us | accessdate = 7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2014 the blog [[Skeptical Science]], following Oppenheimer's investigation on the authorship and content of the book,&lt;ref name=Skeptical /&gt; concluded that Varghese and a few other "ghostwriters" ([[evangelical]] [[pastor]]s)&lt;ref name=Oppenheimer/&gt; [[Psychological manipulation|psychologically manipulated]] Flew quite easily due to his vulnerability, old age and their persistent [[love-bombing]],&lt;ref name=Skeptical/&gt; exploiting him, and presenting typical rough [[Creationism|creationist arguments]] in favor of the Intelligent design theory and appraisal of Christianity that Flew would have never agreed upon:{{Quote |sign=|source=|If you read the book itself, you will find some rather crass creationist arguments that any half decent philosopher would have seen through, so yes indeed, clearly it reeks of bovine waste and is not his work at all.

What should set alarm bells clanging in your head is that he does not give any rebuttals for the arguments he had for being an atheist, but instead simply leans upon a design argument, one that misrepresents much of what we actually know.
Appendix A is supposedly a discussion of whether “God” has communicated anything to humankind, but is instead just an attack on [[Richard Dawkins]], and also demolishes a few [[Straw man|straw men]].

Appendix B is billed as a “dialogue” between Flew and biblical scholar about the Resurrection, in which Flew supposedly asks just three one line questions and the rest (about 20 pages) is religious drivel. For example, Q: Do we have a proof that [[Historicity of Jesus|Jesus]] was real? A: Evidence is so vast that it is not worth mentioning … and so no actual evidence is cited at all, you are supposed to just “believe”.

Oh, and we also supposedly have an endorsement of Christianity by Flew, but there is nothing at all in the book to justify such a stance – clearly this book is simply PR, or to be a bit more blunt, it’s a [[Confidence trick|con job]].

[...] It may in fact be true that Flew did become a deist, but he never ever made the leap to theist, and even that deist step is perhaps explained by him being essentially love-bombed by some Christians in his old age and steered in that direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = [[Skeptical Science]] | url = http://www.skeptical-science.com/people/antony-flew-change-mind/ | title = Antony Flew – did he really change his mind? | date = 25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Awards==
Flew was awarded the Schlarbaum Prize by the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] for his "outstanding lifetime achievement in the cause of liberty."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = https://mises.org/Schlarbaum/flew.asp | contribution = Antony G.N. Flew | year = 2001 | title = Schlarbaum Laureate | publisher = Mises}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon acceptance of the award in Auburn, Alabama, in September 2001, Flew delivered an address entitled "Locke versus Rawls on Equality." Of his choice of topics, he stated "I am the first Englishman and the first professional philosopher to receive the Schlarbaum Prize. So it seems appropriate to begin by talking about the greatest English philosopher, John Locke."&lt;ref&gt;Flew, Antony.

On 11 May 2006, Antony Flew accepted the second "[[Phillip E. Johnson]] Award for Liberty and Truth" from [[Biola University]].  The award, named for its first recipient, was given to Flew "for his lifelong commitment to free and open inquiry and to standing fast against intolerant assaults on freedom of thought and expression".  When informed of his award, Flew remarked, "In light of my work and publications in this area and the criticism I’ve received for changing my position, I appreciate receiving this award".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=27 March 2006 |url=http://www.biola.edu/news/articles/060327_flew.cfm |title=Former Atheist to Receive Award at Biola |work=Biola News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522225854/http://www.biola.edu/news/articles/060327_flew.cfm |archivedate=22 May 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9058">The '''argument from a proper basis''' is an [[ontological argument]] for the [[existence of God]] related to [[fideism]]. [[Alvin Plantinga]] argued that belief in God is a properly [[basic belief]], and so no basis for belief in God is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.origins.org/articles/plantinga_intellectualsophistication.html Origins.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051225232043/http://origins.org/articles/plantinga_intellectualsophistication.html |date=2005-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alvin Plantinga==

The best-known defender of this argument is Alvin Plantinga. According to the argument from a proper basis, belief in God can be rational and justified even without arguments or evidence for the existence of God. More specifically, Plantinga argues that belief in God is [[properly basic]], and, owing to a religious [[Internalism and externalism|externalist]] epistemology, he claims belief in God could be justified independently of evidence. His externalist epistemology, called "Proper functionalism", is a form of [[epistemological]] [[reliabilism]].&lt;ref&gt;
Compare [https://sites.google.com/site/filosofiariformata/descrizioni-di-scuole-di-pensiero-e-autori/epistemologia-riformata "''L'epistemologia riformata'' (Plantinga)"], article on ''Philosophia Reformata''. {{it icon}} Accessed 3 May 2016
&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantinga discusses his view of Reformed epistemology and proper functionalism in a three-volume series. In the first book of the trilogy, ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', Plantinga introduces, analyzes, and criticizes 20th-century developments in analytic epistemology, particularly the works of [[Roderick Chisholm]], [[Laurence BonJour]], [[William Alston]], and [[Alvin Goldman]].&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Plantinga, ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga argues that the theories of what he calls "warrant"—what many others have called [[Theory of justification|justification]] (Plantinga draws out a difference: justification is a matter of fulfilling one's epistemic duties, whereas warrant is what transforms true belief into knowledge)—put forth by these epistemologists have failed to capture in full what is required for knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', 1993. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second book of his three book philosophical series, ''Warrant and Proper Function'', he introduces the notion of warrant as an alternative to justification and discusses topics like self-knowledge, memories, perception, and probability.&lt;ref&gt;
Alvin Plantinga, ''Warrant and Proper Function'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.
&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga's "proper function" account argues that as a necessary condition of having warrant, one's "belief-forming and belief-maintaining apparatus of powers" are functioning properly—"working the way it ought to work".&lt;ref&gt;WPF, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga explains his argument for proper function with reference to a "design plan", as well as an environment in which one's cognitive equipment is optimal for use. Plantinga asserts that the design plan does not require a designer: "it is perhaps possible that [[Evolution (term) | evolution]] (undirected by God or anyone else) has somehow furnished us with our design plans",&lt;ref&gt;WPF, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; but the paradigm case of a design plan is like a technological product designed by a human being (like a radio or a wheel). Ultimately, Plantinga argues that epistemological [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]- i.e. [[epistemology]] that holds that warrant is dependent on natural faculties – is best supported by supernaturalist metaphysics – in this case the belief in a [[creator God]] or in some designer who has laid out a design plan that includes cognitive faculties conducive to attaining knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;WPF, 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Plantinga, a belief, B, is warranted if:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(1) the cognitive faculties involved in the production of B are functioning properly…; (2) your cognitive environment is sufficiently similar to the one for which your cognitive faculties are designed; (3) … the design plan governing the production of the belief in question involves, as purpose or function, the production of true beliefs…; and (4) the design plan is a good one: that is, there is a high statistical or objective probability that a belief produced in accordance with the relevant segment of the design plan in that sort of environment is true.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, ''Warrant and Proper Function'', 1993. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Plantinga seeks to defend this view of proper function against alternative views of proper function proposed by other philosophers which he groups together as "naturalistic", including the "functional generalization" view of [[John L. Pollock|John Pollock]], the evolutionary/etiological account provided by [[Ruth Millikan]], and a dispositional view held by [[John Bigelow]] and [[Robert Pargetter]].&lt;ref&gt;WPF, p. 199-211.&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga also discusses his [[#Evolutionary argument against naturalism|evolutionary argument against naturalism]] in the later chapters of ''Warrant and Proper Function''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fales | first1 = E. | title = Plantinga's Case against Naturalistic Epistemology | journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 63 | issue = 3 | pages = 432–451 | doi = 10.1086/289920 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 Plantinga's third volume, ''Warranted Christian Belief'', was published. In this volume, Plantinga's warrant theory is the basis for his theological end: providing a philosophical basis for Christian belief, an argument for why Christian theistic belief can enjoy warrant. In the book, he develops two models for such beliefs, the "A/C" ([[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]/[[John Calvin|Calvin]]) model, and the "Extended A/C" model. The former attempts to show that a belief in God can be justified, warranted and rational, while the Extended model tries to show that core Christian theological beliefs, including the [[Trinity]], the [[Incarnation]], the resurrection of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]], the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]], salvation, etc.{{huh?|date=January 2017}} can be warranted. Under this model, Christians are warranted in their beliefs because of the work of the [[Holy Spirit]] in bringing those beliefs about in the believer.

==Objections==

===The Great Pumpkin Objection===

The best known objection to the argument from a proper basis is known as '[[The Great Pumpkin]] Objection'. Alvin Plantinga brought it up in his 1983 book ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', and described it as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is tempting to raise the following sort of question. If belief in God can be properly basic, why cannot just any belief be properly basic? Could we not say the same for any bizarre aberration we can think of? What about voodoo or astrology? What about the belief that [[the Great Pumpkin]] returns every Halloween? Could I properly take that as basic? Suppose I believe that if I flap my arms with sufficient vigor, I can take off and fly about the room; could I defend myself against the charge of irrationality by claiming this belief is basic? If we say that belief in God is properly basic, will we not be committed to holding that just anything, or nearly anything, can properly be taken as basic, thus throwing wide the gates to irrationalism and superstition? (p. 74)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Rebuttal====

Plantinga's answer to this line of thinking is that the objection simply assumes that the criteria for "proper basicality" propounded by [[Foundationalism#Classical foundationalism|classical foundationalism]] (self-evidence, incorrigibility, and sense-perception) are the only possible criteria for properly basic beliefs. It is as if the Great Pumpkin objector feels that if properly basic beliefs cannot be arrived at by way of one of these criteria, then it follows that just 'any' belief could then be properly basic, precisely because there are no other criteria. But Plantinga says it simply doesn't follow from the rejection of classical foundationalist criteria that all possibility for criteria has been exhausted and this is exactly what the Great Pumpkin objection assumes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Plantinga takes his counter-argument further, asking how the great pumpkin objector "knows" that such criteria are the only criteria. The objector certainly seems to hold it as 'basic' that the classical foundationalist criteria are all that is available. Yet, such a claim is neither self-evident, incorrigible, nor evident to the senses. This rebuts the Great Pumpkin objection by demonstrating the classical foundationalist position to be internally incoherent, propounding an epistemic position which it itself does not follow.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Associative economics''' is a term used variously by different people around the world. For some of these the work of Austrian [[philosopher]] and social thinker [[Rudolf Steiner]]&lt;ref name=WE&gt;Steiner, Rudolf [http://www.economics.goetheanum.org/954.html ''Economics – The World As One Economy'']&lt;/ref&gt; is a reference. Steiner gave a course of lectures in 1922 in which he set out his view that with the advent of [[global economy]], the science of economics would need to take a further step, which included an elaboration of the economic process, a more precise monetary analysis, and a clearer understanding of how, through the division of labour, the associative basis of economic life becomes apparent. Associative economics emphasizes the development of conscious coordination of producers, distributors, and consumers. It understands the global economy as a single unified domain, through which human beings meet one another's needs. It is called "associative economics" because its goal is an economic sector which is managed by associations of business corporations (industry associations) and consumer associations instead of by the [[invisible hand]] of the blind market (capitalist economics) and instead of by the government (socialist economics).

==Themes==

Some of the themes central to/addressed by associative economics include the following: how the three functions of money become three qualities; why the ‘factors of production’ are better described as ‘factors of price formation’; true pricing (in lieu of the efficient market hypothesis); the concepts of gift money (not synonymous with donations) and ‘loan money’ (not synonymous with loans); moving from real to personal credit; property rights in terms of the 'fundamental sociological law';{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} understanding that land is not in the market ever – what is in the market is the right to own or use land; understanding in detail and technically how one overcomes the gold standard, or what happens to balance of payments, or whether there can be banking in an associative economy.

The idea of associative economics is often also the inspiration behind such things as [[community supported agriculture]], [[ethical banking]], [[social finance]], [[community land trust]]s, and [[local currencies]].&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Gary. ''Associative Economics: spiritual activity for the common good'' (Ghent, NY: AWSNA. 2010) 20, 145&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local and global==

Associative economics recognizes the central role of the individual entrepreneur and the inherent regulatory effect of face-to-face transactions between producers and consumers. At the same time, it sees that the economic organism has become truly global – has moved beyond national boundaries – so that when the economy is seen from a national perspective this is only partial and potentially harmful. Though within the context of a legislative and regulatory framework, the economy is best conducted not by the State but by those who are responsible for economic activities, potentially everyone!, working in association with one another rather than unto themselves. It has also been described as an "altruistic stakeholder-managed economy").&lt;ref&gt;Karp, Robert. ''Toward an Associative Economy in the Sustainable Food and Farming Movement'' (New Spirit Ventures. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; 
This picture of an autonomously conducted economy belongs to Steiner's overall conception of the threefold nature of social life.

==The threefold nature of social life==

In the early 20th century, Rudolf Steiner spoke in detail about the threefold nature of social life; not as an invention or theory, but as observable fact (also known as the "threefold social organism" or "[[Social threefolding#Civil society|social threefolding]]"). Central to this perception is the need for autonomy (separate yet conscious interaction) on the part of the three realms of social life: the economy, the rights life (including politics and law), and spiritual-cultural life, meaning the many worldviews that human beings cherish. Though historically premature, they see in the cry of the French Revolution ("Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité") three fundamental ideals of the modern human being, each of which can only find its proper place in one of these three spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, Rudolf. ''Towards Social Renewal'' (Great Barrington: SteinerBooks. 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom and pluralism in the spiritual-cultural realm, including in education; uncoerced cooperation in the economic realm – where through the division of labor individuals come together to meet one another’s needs; and democracy and equality in the political rights realm – where everyone comes together to sense and make agreements that are right for all.

== Land, labor, and capital==

Many things which today are considered commodities within the ‘free-market’ paradigm are differently understood within an associative paradigm. For example: land, labor, and capital. The so-called ‘factors of production’ are seen as 'factors of price formation', essentially matters of right which simply border the economic realm on all sides. However, in the associative paradigm, these 'factors of price formation' do not fall into the hands of the state.

Land is part of the commons. It is our common heritage, a resource that, in a wider sense, belongs to all (including future generations, but, again, ''not'' to the State), and which needs to be entrusted by voluntary groups and individuals to those whom such groups and individuals consider most capable of using it to meet current social needs. 
&lt;ref&gt;in this, Steiner corroborates many notable thinkers including [[Chief Seattle]]Chief Seattle  [http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC03/Seattle.htm  Letter to President Pierce] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414051133/http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC03/Seattle.htm# |date=2011-04-14 }}, 1855 and [[Thomas Jefferson]]). Jefferson, Thomas [http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/P/tj3/writings/brf/jefl81.htm "The Earth Belongs to the Living"] – a letter to James Madison, Paris, 9/6/1789&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner views labor as a form of "wagery," the remnant of serfdom and slavery (where once we sold our whole body, now we sell our ’labor power’). But it is also an economic untruth, an impossibility which we allow to persist: "[People] actually speak as though a kind of sale and purchase took place between the wage-earner who sells his labour and the man who buys it from him. But this sale and purchase is fictitious. It does not in reality take place... [In reality] it is values which are exchanged. The worker produces something directly; he delivers a product, and it is this product which the enterpriser [Unternehmer] really buys from him. In actual fact, down to the last farthing, the enterpriser pays for the products which the workers deliver to him. It is time we began to see these things in their right light."&lt;ref name=WE/&gt;
 
Capital creates value by the application of intelligence to labor. It is the human spirit manifest in the economic process. An interesting analysis of this viewpoint is provided by Folkert Wilken in his book ''The Liberation of Capital''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilken, Folkert. ''The Liberation of Capital'' (London, England; George Allen &amp; Unwin. 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; Often taking the form of money, it further frees and empowers the entrepreneur to apply their intelligence. The artist [[Joseph Beuys]] famously expressed this as "Art=Capital" (Kunst=Kapital), or alternatively, for his art piece in the 'Luna Luna' art fair in 1987, "Money is not CAPITAL at all. CAPACITY is CAPITAL."&lt;ref&gt;Beuys, Joseph. ''What is Money?'' (Forest Row, England; Clearview. 2010) 26&lt;/ref&gt; Capital is therefore intimately linked to the individual, although it also owes much to our common heritage, especially the way we are educated.

In an associative economy, therefore, land, labor, and capital are understood as rights phenomena. Some interpret this to mean they are held in trust on behalf of the community (but not held by the state) and consequently managed by those with both the desire and capacity, but how precisely this idea is given practical expression is one of the key, and liveliest, areas of research in associative economics.

Land trusts, which remove land from the private market, but also keep it out of the hands of the state, have been developed for the protection of the environment and in order to make home ownership more accessible to low income people.

As for labor, many different kinds of efforts have been made to treat laborers not as a mere company expense or a mere factor of production, but as partners and associates in the business.  That entails profit sharing, and a number of profound changes in the way workers are involved in companies.

As for capital, the associative idea broadly speaking is that the buildup of capital is a social phenomenon due to many more stakeholders than are acknowledged under traditional capitalism.  As a social phenomenon, accumulations of capital by a company should be administered in a way that reflects social consideration among many stakeholders:  Not just investors, but workers, the local and to some extent global community and environment, and independent educational institutions, are the sources of profits and profitable ideas and capital, and should have some share in the company and in its profits.  An associative company would be set up so that it cannot be sold off by investors, since the company is not merely the creation of investors.  But many different arrangements are possible.

One example is the Mondragon Industrial Cooperatives (started by Catholic priest José Mª Arizmendiarrieta, who was not associated with Rudolf Steiner, but whose economic views overlapped in important ways with Steiner's economic views). By the end of 2011, the Mondragon Industrial Cooperatives&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/24/alternative-capitalism-mondragon Mondragon Industrial Cooperatives]&lt;/ref&gt; employed 83,869 people working in 256 companies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openideo.com/open/connected/inspiration/learning-from-of-mondragon-corporation-redesigning-work-and-living/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; in four areas of activity: finance, industry, retail and knowledge.

In an associative enterprise, distant investors, if allowed to invest at all, might not be given any voting rights, or the ability to take control of the company and sell it unilaterally without regard to other stakeholders.  An emphasis might be placed on getting investment capital from a company's workers, who could be asked to invest part of their earnings or profits in a company investment fund to help expand the company and develop new offshoots.  When a worker leaves the company, he withdraws his invested capital, plus its earnings and interest, and some sort of pension given enough years of service.  The company is set up so that no one can amass company shares, and thus the company itself cannot be sold and remains a resource for the community, which after all has been a part of the company's success.  The company, while for-profit, might be held in trust by a non-profit board, which ensures the company remains as a resource for the community.  The broad guiding lines of associative economic enterprise are that economic life should not be owned or managed by the state (which however of course legislates and makes sure that laws and regulations are followed by companies, including basic rights for workers), nor should economic life be owned or managed merely by those who have lots of capital to invest; ownership should be spread among all the stakeholders, with an emphasis on those who work in a company, the local community, and independent schools.  Management of the company should be determined not by the state, but by talent, know-how, and success: i.e., whoever can manage the company profitably and for the benefit of all stakeholders, might be selected in various ways by various stakeholders, depending on circumstances.

== Terminology ==
{{Hinduism small}}

The meaning of the term ''Bhakti'' is analogous to but different from [[Kama]]. Kama connotes emotional connection, sometimes with sensual devotion and erotic love. Bhakti, in contrast, is spiritual, a love and devotion to religious concepts or principles, that engages both emotion and intellection.&lt;ref name=karen20&gt;Karen Pechelis (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 19-21&lt;/ref&gt; Karen Pechelis states that the word Bhakti should not be understood as uncritical emotion, but as committed engagement.&lt;ref name=karen20 /&gt; She adds that, in the concept of ''bhakti'' in Hinduism, the engagement involves a simultaneous tension between emotion  and intellection, "emotion to reaffirm the social context and temporal freedom, intellection to ground the experience in a thoughtful, conscious approach".&lt;ref name=karen20 /&gt; One who practices ''bhakti'' is called a ''bhakta''.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechelis (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The term bhakti, in [[Vedas|Vedic]] Sanskrit literature, has a general meaning of "mutual attachment, devotion, fondness for, devotion to" such as in human relationships, most often between beloved-lover, friend-friend, king-subject, parent-child.&lt;ref name="Cutler"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cutler|first=Norman|title=Songs of Experience|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1987|pages=1|isbn=978-0-253-35334-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=veSItWingx8C&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may refer to devotion towards a spiritual teacher ([[Guru]]) as ''guru-bhakti'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sivananda|first=Swami|title=Guru Bhakti Yoga|publisher=Divine Life Society|year=2004|isbn=81-7052-168-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vivekananda|first=Swami|title=The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|year=1970| url =http://www.dlshq.org/download/gurubhaktiyoga.htm | pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to a personal god,&lt;ref name="Cutler" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Neusner, Jacob|title=World religions in America: an introduction|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|year=2003|pages=128|isbn=0-664-22475-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; or for spirituality without form ([[nirguna]]).&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, page 21&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Sri Lankan Buddhist scholar Sanath Nanayakkara, there is no single term in English that adequately translates or represents the concept of ''bhakti'' in Indian religions.{{sfn| Nanayakkara|1966|pp=678–80}} Terms such as "devotion, faith, devotional faith" represent certain aspects of ''bhakti'', but it means much more. The concept includes a sense of deep affection, attachment, but not wish because "wish is selfish, affection is unselfish". Some scholars, states Nanayakkara, associate it with ''saddha'' (Sanskrit: ''Sraddha'') which means "faith, trust or confidence". However, ''bhakti'' can connote an end in itself, or a path to spiritual wisdom.{{sfn| Nanayakkara|1966|pp=678–80}}

The term ''Bhakti'' refers to one of several alternate spiritual paths to [[moksha]] (spiritual freedom, liberation, salvation) in Hinduism,&lt;ref name=johnmartin /&gt; and it is referred to as ''bhakti marga'' or ''bhakti yoga''.&lt;ref name="Klostermaier"&gt;{{cite book|last=Klostermaier|first=Klaus|authorlink=Klaus Klostermaier|title=A survey of Hinduism|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1989|pages=210–212|isbn=978-0-88706-807-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechelis (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 14-15, 37-38&lt;/ref&gt; The other paths are ''Jnana marga'' (path of knowledge), ''Karma marga'' (path of works), ''Rāja marga'' (path of contemplation and meditation).&lt;ref name=johnmartin&gt;John Martin Sahajananda (2014), Fully Human Fully Divine, Partridge India, {{ISBN|978-1482819557}}, page 60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;KN Tiwari (2009), Comparative Religion, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120802933}}, page 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''bhakti'' has been usually translated as "devotion" in [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 15-24&lt;/ref&gt; The colonial era authors variously described ''Bhakti'' as a form of mysticism or "primitive" religious devotion of lay people with monotheistic parallels.&lt;ref name=paulcarus&gt;Paul Carus, {{Google books|96sLAAAAIAAJ|The Monist|PA514}}, pages 514-515&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DG Mandelbaum (1966), Transcendental and Pragmatic Aspects of Religion, American Anthropologist, 68(5), pages 1174–1191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DC Scott (1980), Hindu and Christian Bhakti: A Common Human Response to the Sacred, Indian Journal of Theology, 29(1), pages 12-32&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern scholars state "devotion" is a misleading and incomplete translation of ''bhakti''.&lt;ref name=karen2324 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gale"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gale Encyclopedia of Religion|pages=856–857|editor=Lindsay Jones|publisher=Thompson Gale|year=2005|volume=Volume 2|isbn=0-02-865735-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many contemporary scholars have questioned this terminology, and most now trace the term ''bhakti'' as one of the several spiritual perspectives that emerged from reflections on the Vedic context and Hindu way of life. Bhakti in Indian religions is not a ritualistic devotion to a god or to religion, but participation in a path that includes behavior, ethics, mores and spirituality.&lt;ref name=karen2324 /&gt; It involves, among other things, refining one's state of mind, knowing god, participating in god, and internalizing god.&lt;ref name=karen2324 /&gt; Increasingly, instead of "devotion", the term "participation" is appearing in scholarly literature as a gloss for the term ''bhakti''.&lt;ref name=karen2324&gt;Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt;

=== The Upanishads ===
The last of three epilogue verses of the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]], dated to be from 1st millennium BCE, uses the word ''Bhakti'' as follows,

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
यस्य देवे परा '''भक्तिः''' यथा देवे तथा गुरौ &lt;nowiki&gt;।
तस्यैते कथिता ह्यर्थाः प्रकाशन्ते महात्मनः ॥ २३ ॥&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/श्वेताश्वतरोपनिषद् Shvetashvatara Upanishad 6.23] Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt;

He who has highest ''Bhakti'' of ''Deva'' (God),
just like his ''Deva'', so for his ''Guru'' (teacher),
To him who is high-minded,
these teachings will be illuminating.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Shvetashvatara Upanishad 6.23&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, page 326&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads02ml#page/266/mode/2up Shvetashvatara Upanishad], The Upanishads, Part II, Oxford University Press, page 267&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This verse is one of the earliest use of the word ''Bhakti'' in ancient Indian literature, and has been translated as "the love of God".&lt;ref name=paulcarus /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WN Brown (1970), Man in the Universe: Some Continuities in Indian Thought, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520017498}}, pages 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars&lt;ref name=pauldeussenintro&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 301-304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maxmullerinto&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads02ml#page/n33/mode/2up The Shvetashvatara Upanishad], Oxford University Press, pages xxxii – xlii&lt;/ref&gt; have debated whether this phrase is authentic or later insertion into the Upanishad, and whether the terms "Bhakti" and "Deva" meant the same in this ancient text as they do in the modern era. [[Max Muller]] states that the word ''Bhakti'' appears only once in this Upanishad, that too in one last verse of the epilogue, could have been a later addition and may not be theistic as the word was later used in much later ''Sandilya Sutras''.&lt;ref name=maxmullerbhakti&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads02ml#page/n33/mode/2up The Shvetashvatara Upanishad], Oxford University Press, pages xxxiv and xxxvii&lt;/ref&gt; Grierson as well as Carus note that the first epilogue verse 6.21 of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad is also notable for its use of the word ''Deva Prasada'' (देवप्रसाद, grace or gift of God), but add that ''Deva'' in the epilogue of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad refers to "pantheistic [[Brahman]]" and the closing credit to sage Shvetashvatara in verse 6.21 can mean "gift or grace of his Soul".&lt;ref name=paulcarus /&gt;

Scholarly consensus sees ''bhakti'' as a post-Vedic movement that developed primarily during the Epics and Puranas era of Indian history.&lt;ref&gt;"Scholarly consensus today tends to view bhakti as a post-Vedic development that took place primarily in the watershed years of the epics and Puranas."

=== Bhakti movement ===
{{Main|Bhakti movement}}
The ''[[Bhakti Movement]]'' was a rapid growth of bhakti, first starting in the later part of 1st millennium CE, from [[Tamil Nadu]] in Southern India with the Saiva [[Nayanars]]&lt;ref name="Embree"&gt;{{cite book|last=Embree|first=Ainslie Thomas | authorlink=Ainslie Embree|author2=Stephen N.

Their ideas and practices inspired bhakti poetry and devotion throughout India over the 12th-18th century CE.&lt;ref name="Flood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Embree" /&gt; The Alvars ("those immersed in God") were Vaishnava poet-saints who wandered from temple to temple singing the praises of Vishnu. They established temple sites ([[Srirangam]] is one) and converted many people to [[Vaishnavism]].&lt;ref name="Embree" /&gt;

[[File:Meerabai (crop).jpg|thumb|left|[[Meera]] (1498-1546) was one of the most significant poet-saints in the [[Vaishnava]] bhakti movement.&lt;ref name=smpandey&gt;SM Pandey (1965), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1061803 Mīrābāī and Her Contributions to the Bhakti Movement], History of Religions, Vol. 5, No. 1, pages 54-73&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Like the Alvars the [[Shaivism|Saiva]] Nayanar poets were influential. The ''[[Tirumurai]]'', a compilation of hymns by sixty-three Nayanar poets, is still of great importance in South India. Hymns by three of the most prominent poets, [[Appar]] (7th century CE), [[Campantar]] (7th century) and [[Sundarar]] (9th century), were compiled into the ''[[Tevaram]]'', the first volumes of the ''Tirumurai''. The poets' itinerant lifestyle helped create temple and pilgrimage sites and spread devotion to Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Olson|first=Carl|title=The many colors of Hinduism: a thematic-historical introduction|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|year=2007|pages=231|isbn=978-0-8135-4068-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RVWKClYq4TUC&amp;pg=PA231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Tamil-Siva bhakti poets are quoted the [[Black Yajurveda]].&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 17-18&lt;/ref&gt; The Alwars and Nayanars were instrumental in propagating the Bhakti tradition. The [[Bhagavata Purana]]'s references to the South Indian Alvar saints, along with its emphasis on ''bhakti'', have led many scholars to give it South Indian origins, though some scholars question whether this evidence excludes the possibility that ''bhakti'' movement had parallel developments in other parts of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Sheridan| first=Daniel| title= The Advaitic Theism of the Bhagavata Purana |publisher=South Asia Books |location=Columbia, Mo |year=1986 |isbn=81-208-0179-2 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=qrtYYTjYFY8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=van Buitenen | first=J.

Scholars state that the ''bhakti'' movement focused on the gods Vishnu, Shiva, Shakti and other deities, that developed and spread in India, was in response to the arrival of [[Islam]] in India about 8th century CE,&lt;ref&gt;Note: The earliest arrival dates are contested by scholars. They range from 7th to 9th century, with Muslim traders settling in coastal regions of Indian peninsula, to Muslims seeking asylum in Tamil Nadu, to raids in northwest India by [[Muhammad bin Qasim]]. See: Annemarie Schimmel (1997), Islam in the Indian subcontinent, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004061170}}, pages 3-7; Andre Wink (2004), Al-Hind: the Making of the Indo-Islamic World, Brill Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|90-04-09249-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent [[Religious violence in India|religious violence]].&lt;ref name=encyclopediabrit /&gt;&lt;ref name=karen /&gt;&lt;ref name=johnhawley /&gt; This view is contested by other scholars.&lt;ref name=johnhawley&gt;John Stratton Hawley (2015), A Storm of Songs: India and the Idea of the Bhakti Movement, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674187467}}, pages 39-61&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement has traditionally been considered as an influential social reformation in Hinduism, and provided an individual-focused alternative path to spirituality regardless of one's birth caste or gender.&lt;ref name=schomer /&gt; [[Postmodernism|Postmodern]] scholars question this traditional view and whether the [[Bhakti movement]] were ever a social reform or rebellion of any kind.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 10-16&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest Bhakti movement was a revival, reworking and recontextualization of ancient Vedic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ramana Maharishi, states David Frawley, bhakti is a "surrender to the divine with one's heart". It can be practiced as an adjunct to self-inquiry, and in one of four ways:{{sfn|Frawley|2000|p=133}}
# Atma-Bhakti: devotion to the one's ''atma'' (Supreme Self)
# Ishvara-Bhakti: devotion to a formless being (God, Cosmic Lord)
# Ishta Devata-Bhakti: devotion to a personal god or goddess
# Guru-Bhakti: devotion to [[Guru]]

=== Bhagavata Purana and Navaratnamalika ===
The ''Navaratnamalika'' (garland of nine gems), nine forms of ''bhakti'' are listed: (1) ''śravaṇa'' (listening to ancient texts), (2) ''kīrtana'' (praying), (3) ''smaraṇa'' (remembering teachings in ancient texts), (4) ''pāda-sevana'' (service to the feet), (5) ''archana'' (worshiping), (6) ''namaskar'' or ''vandana'' (bowing to the divine), (7) ''dāsya'' (service to the divine), (8) ''sākhyatva'' (friendship with the divine), and (9) ''ātma-nivedana'' (self-surrender to the divine).&lt;ref&gt;Vijaya Moorthy (2001), Romance of the Raga, Abhinav, {{ISBN|978-8170173823}}, pages 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Koskoff (2013), The Concise Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415994040}}, pages 992-993&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bhagavata Purana]] teaches nine similar facets of bhakti.&lt;ref name="Halberman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haberman|first=David L.|title=Acting as a Way of Salvation|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|year=2001|pages=133–134|isbn=978-81-208-1794-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ua-E20uyH9IC&amp;pg=RA1-PA133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bhagavata Purana'', 7.5.23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bhavas ===
Traditional Hinduism speaks of five different ''[[bhava#In bhakti traditions|bhāvas]]'' or "[[affective]] essences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spivak|first=Gayatri Chakravorty | authorlink=Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak|title=Other Asias|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|date=December 28, 2007|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, ''bhāvas'' are different attitudes that a devotee takes according to his individual temperament to express his devotion towards God in some form.&lt;ref name="Akhilananda_180" /&gt; The different ''bhāvas'' are:
# ''śānta'', placid love for  God;
# ''dāsya'', the attitude of a servant;
# ''sakhya'', the attitude of a friend;
# ''vātsalya'', the attitude of a mother towards her child;
# ''madhura'', the attitude of a woman towards her lover.&lt;ref name="Akhilananda_180"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Allport  | first =  Gordon W.  |author2=Swami [[Akhilananda]]  | title = Hindu Psychology  | chapter =  Its meaning for the West  | publisher = Routledge  | year = 1999  | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=aANjt2mn27MC&amp;pg=PA180 180]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several saints are known to have practiced these ''bhavas''. The nineteenth century mystic, [[Ramakrishna]] is said to have practiced these five ''bhavas''.&lt;ref name="isherwood-111"&gt;{{cite book|last=Isherwood|first=Christopher|title=Ramakrishna and his disciples|publisher=Vedanta Press|year=1980|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6qVMrumO-g0C&amp;pg=PA111 111–112]|isbn=978-0-87481-037-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attitude of [[Hanuman]] towards lord [[Rama]] is considered to be of ''dasya bhava''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sarma|first=Subrahmanya |title=Essence of Hinduism|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|year=1971|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attitude of [[Arjuna]] and the shepherd boys of [[Vrindavan]] towards [[Krishna]]  is regarded as ''sakhya bhava''.&lt;ref name="isherwood-111" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharma|first=Hari Dutt |title=Glory of Spiritual India|publisher=Pustak Mahal|year=1999|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KQFOCy7DpQ0C&amp;pg=PA95 95–96]|isbn=978-81-223-0439-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attitude of [[Radha]] towards Krishna is regarded as ''madhura bhava''.&lt;ref name="isherwood-111" /&gt; The attitude of [[Yashoda]], who looked after [[Krishna]] during his childhood is regarded as ''vatsalya bhava''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Devanand|first=G.K.|title=Teaching of Yoga|publisher=APH Publishing|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=L3mBLHWxgPsC&amp;pg=PA74 74]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caitanya-caritamrta mentions that Mahaprabhu came to distribute the four spiritual sentiments of Vraja loka: dasya, sakhya, vatsalya, and [[sringara]]. [[Sringara]] is the relationship of the intimate love.

=== Buddhism ===
{{Main|Buddhist devotion|Faith in Buddhism}}
&lt;!--"Buddhist devotion#Definition" links here --&gt;
Bhakti (called ''bhatti'' in [[Pali]] language) has been a common aspect of Buddhism, where offerings and group prayers are made to images such the images of the [[Buddha]] and the ''[[Bodhisattvas]]'',&lt;ref name="swearer9"&gt;Donald Swearer (2003), Buddhism in the Modern World: Adaptations of an Ancient Tradition (Editors: Heine and Prebish), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195146981}}, pages 9-25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechelis (2011), The Bloomsbury Companion to Hindu Studies (Editor: Jessica Frazier), Bloomsbury, {{ISBN|978-1472511515}}, pages 109-112&lt;/ref&gt; or to deities such as [[wrathful deities]].&lt;ref name="child138"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louise Child|title=Tantric Buddhism and Altered States of Consciousness: Durkheim, Emotional Energy and Visions of the Consort |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yYDeCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT138 |year=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-04677-6|pages=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karel Werner]] notes that Bhakti has been a significant practice in [[Theravada]] Buddhism, and states, "there can be no doubt that deep devotion or ''bhakti / bhatti'' does exist in Buddhism and that it had its beginnings in the earliest days".&lt;ref name="werner45"&gt;Karel Werner (1995), Love Divine: Studies in Bhakti and Devotional Mysticism, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700702350}}, pages 45-46&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sri Lankan scholar Indumathie Karunaratna, the meaning of ''bhatti'' changed throughout Buddhist history, however.&lt;ref name="ik435" /&gt; In [[early Buddhism]], such as in the text [[Theragatha|Theragāthā]],{{sfn|Nanayakkara|1966|p=678}} ''bhatti'' had the meaning of 'faithful adherence to the [Buddhist] religion', and was accompanied with knowledge. In later text tradition, however, the term developed the meaning of an advanced form of emotional devotion. Examples of the latter include the veneration of Buddha [[Amitabha]] and those in the ''[[Lotus Sutra|Saddharmapundrarika Sutra]]''.&lt;ref name="ik435"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor1-last=Malalasekera|editor1-first=Gunapala Piyasena|editor1-link= G. P. Malalasekera|first= Indumathie|last= Karunaratna|encyclopedia= Encyclopaedia of Buddhism|title= Devotion|date=2000|volume=IV|publisher=Government of Ceylon|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/283214333/Enceylopaedia-of-Buddhism-Vol-IV|pages=435–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/early%20buddhist%20theory%20of%20knowledge_jayatilleke.pdf|last1=Jayatilleke|first1=K.N.|authorlink1=K.N. Jayatilleke|title=Early Buddhist theory of knowledge|date=1963|publisher=[[George Allen &amp; Unwin]]|isbn=1-134-54287-9|p=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; This changed the meaning of Buddhist devotion to a more person-centered sense, similar to a theist sense used in Hindu scriptures. This sense of devotion was no longer connected with a belief in a religious system, and had little place for doubt, contradicting the early Buddhist concept of ''saddhā''. ''Saddhā'' did not exclude reasonable doubt on the spiritual path, and was a step in reaching the final aim of developing wisdom, not an end in itself.{{sfn| Nanayakkara|1966|p=679}}

In early Buddhism, states Sanath Nanayakkara, the concept of taking refuge to the Buddha had the meaning of taking the Buddha as an ideal to live by, rather than the later sense of self-surrender.&lt;!--p=680--&gt; But already in the [[atthakatha|Commentary]] to the [[Abhidhamma]] text ''[[Puggalapaññatti]]'', it is mentioned that the Buddhist devotee should develop his ''saddhā'' until it becomes ''bhaddi'', a sense not mentioned in earlier texts and probably influenced by the Hindu idea of ''bhakti''.&lt;!--p=679--&gt; There are instances where commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] mentions taking refuge in the Buddha in the sense of mere adoration, indicating a historical shift in meaning.&lt;!--Nanayakkara 680--&gt; Similar developments took place with regard to the term [[Puja (Buddhism)|''puja'' (honor)]] and the role of the Buddha image. In [[Mahāyāna Buddhism]], the doctrine of the [[trikāya]] (three bodies) and the devotion towards ''Bodhisattvas'' all indicating a shift of emphasis toward devotion as a central concept in later Buddhism.&lt;!--p=681--&gt;{{sfn| Nanayakkara|1966|pp=679–81}}

In later faith-oriented literature, such as the [[Avadana|Avadānas]], faith is given an important role in Buddhist doctrine. Nevertheless, faith (''śraddhā'') is discussed in different contexts than devotion (''bhakti''). ''Bhakti'' is often used disparagingly to describe acts of worship to deities, often seen as ineffective and improper for a Buddhist. Also, ''bhakti'' is clearly connected with a person as an object, whereas ''śraddhā'' is less connected with a person, and is more connected with truthfulness and truth. Śraddhā focuses on ideas such as the working of [[karma (Buddhism)|karma]] and [[merit transfer]].&lt;ref name="Rotman 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rotman|first1=Andy|title=Thus Have I Seen: Visualizing Faith in Early Indian Buddhism|date=2008|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-045117-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=a-0JCAAAQBAJ|chapter=Getting and Giving}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, affective devotion is an important part of Buddhist practice, not only in Mahāyāna Buddhism. According to Winston King, a scholar on Theravāda Buddhism in Myanmar, "warm, personalized, emotional" ''bhakti'' has been a part of the [[Burmese Buddhism|Burmese Buddhis]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t tradition apart from the monastic and lay intellectuals.&lt;ref name="King1964p173" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kLs3AAAAIAAJ|last1=Gokhale|first1=Balkrishna Govind|title=Bhakti in Early Buddhism|editor-last=Lele|editor-first=J|year=1981|encyclopedia=Tradition and modernity in Bhakti movements|volume=31|publisher=[[Brill (publisher)|Brill Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha is treasured by the everyday devout Buddhist, just like Catholics treasure Jesus. The orthodox teachers tend to restrain the devotion to the Buddha, but to the devout Buddhist populace, "a very deeply devotional quality" was and remains a part of the actual practice. This is observable, states King, in "multitudes of pagoda worshippers of the Buddha images" and the offerings they make before the image and nowhere else.&lt;ref name="King1964p173"&gt;{{cite book|author=Winston Lee King|title=A thousand lives away: Buddhism in contemporary Burma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5_dCAAAAIAAJ|year=1964|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=173–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the worship of the ''Bodhisattvas'' and various deities in Tibetan and other traditions of Buddhism, including the so-called wrathful deities.&lt;ref name="child138" /&gt;

=== Jainism ===
Bhakti has been a prevalent ancient practice in various Jaina sects, wherein learned [[Tirthankara]] (''Jina'') and human ''gurus'' have been venerated with offerings, songs and [[Aarti|Āratī]] prayers.&lt;ref name=johncort&gt;John Cort, Jains in the World : Religious Values and Ideology in India, Oxford University Press, ISBN, pages 64-68, 86-90, 100-112&lt;/ref&gt;

Jainism participated in the Bhakti school of medieval India, and has a rich tradition of bhakti literature (''stavan'') though these have been less studied than those of the Hindu tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Whitney Kelting|title=Singing to the Jinas: Jain Laywomen, Mandal Singing, and the Negotiations of Jain Devotion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=elcn1IEJ3CEC |year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803211-3|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Avasyaka sutra'' of Jains includes, among ethical duties for the devotee, the recitation of "hymns of praise to the Tirthankaras" as the second Obligatory Action. It explains this ''bhakti'' as one of the means to destroy negative karma. According to [[Paul Dundas]], such textual references to devotional activity suggests that ''bhakti'' was a necessary part of Jainism from an early period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas|title=The Jains|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ |year= 2003|publisher =Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-26605-5|pages= 170–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jeffery Long, along with its strong focus on ethics and ascetic practices, the religiosity in Jainism has had a strong tradition of ''bhakti'' or devotion just like their Hindu neighbors. The Jain community built ornate temples and prided in public devotion for its fordmakers, saints and teachers. ''Abhisekha'', festival prayers, community recitals and ''Murti puja'' (rituals before an image) are examples of integrated bhakti in Jain practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffery D Long|title=Jainism: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3gAAwAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85771-392-6|pages=111–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sherry Fohr|title=Jainism: A Guide for the Perplexed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HMXuBQAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4742-2755-1|pages=91–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lisa Owen|title=Carving Devotion in the Jain Caves at Ellora|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vHK2WE8xAzYC |year=2012|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-20629-9|pages=xii, 2, 12–13, 117–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33183">'''Communities for a Better Environment''' ('''CBE'''), previously known as Citizens for a Better Environment, is a policy focused [[non-profit organization]] started in 1971 by Marc Anderson and David Comey in [[Chicago, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;[Walker, Richard. The country in the city: the greening of the San Francisco Bay Area. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2007. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s and early 1980s CBE expanded to California, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Today, CBE is active primarily in California having established itself in San Francisco in 1978 and expanded to Los Angeles in 1982. CBE, now based in Oakland, CA and Huntington Park, CA, has succeeded in affecting communities throughout California, including: Richmond, East Oakland, Vernon, Huntington Park, Boyle Heights, Pacoima, Wilmington, and SE Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[30th anniversary program booklet "CBE: 30 Years of Resistance, vision and Hope" 10/30/08, at the City Club, SF]&lt;/ref&gt; CBE was the first environmental organization to practice door-to-door canvassing by directly involving community members.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; In 1980 CBE won the United States Supreme Court decision Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment 444 U.S. 620 protecting the 1st and 14th Amendment Rights of door-to-door activists with CBE and countless other public interest organizations. CBE's early combination of [[grassroots]] organizing with research and legal work provided the innovative edge needed to challenge large scale industries, refineries, and policies.

==About==
CBE aims to strengthen low-income communities of color to achieve environmental health and justice by reduction and prevention of pollution, while creating a network of sustainable communities. CBE focuses on urban areas which maintain a disproportionate concentration of low-income minorities with some of the poorest environmental health conditions due to heavy pollution from refineries, ports, power plants, freeways, etc.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.cbecal.org/about/mission-vision/ Mission &amp; Vision | Communities for a Better Environment&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; These communities are more susceptible to cancer and diseases including asthma, heart disease, premature deaths, birth defects, etc.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; CBE values environmental and social sustainability as an intrinsic right for all humans to access clean air and drinking water regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, age, culture, ability, nationality, or income.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.cbecal.org/issues/environmental-justice/ Environmental Justice | Communities for a Better Environment&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; CBE is committed to empowering the community by giving organizational skills, leadership training, legal, scientific, and technical assistance to communities that may effectively fight injustice and create durable change.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

=== Early work===
CBE began to set the precedent for water, air, and toxic pollution advocating for community concerns and environmental regulation. In 1977, CBE organized with community members against the [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant]] in San Francisco, California.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Richard. The country in the city: the greening of the San Francisco Bay Area. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1983, landmark report and investigation of Bay Area toxic secretion, "Toxics in the Bay", held Chevron and others accountable of toxic discharge in the 1985 Basin Plan Discharge Program.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; The Basin Plan expanded to become the San Francisco Bay Region Basin Plan in 2004. The plan complied with California State and Federal anti-degradation policies awaiting approval by San Francisco State Water Board and the US [[Environmental Protection Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/waters/tmdldocs/39084_SONOMA%20SEDIMENT%20TMDL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; CBE pressured Bay Area Quality Management District to reevaluate permit granted to Kaiser Cement and Gypsum Corporation resulting in sulfur dioxide reduction by 50%. As well as, limited use of perchloroethylene, a.k.a. [[Tetrachloroethylene]], in Vallejo, California dry cleaners.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

==Research approach==
Several studies support the idea that low-income communities of color bear the burden of unequal access to a healthy environment, which prioritizes CBE's effort to work with communities to fight such injustices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohai|first=Paul|author2=Pellow, David |author3=Roberts, J. Timmons |title=Environmental Justice|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|date=November 2009|volume=34|issue=1|pages=405–430|doi=10.1146/annurev-environ-082508-094348}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CBE focuses on educating low-income communities of color and advocating engagement by community meetings, political education, and school groups where people are empowered to fight local pollution by working together towards achieving healthier communities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.cbecal.org/issues/how-we-create-change/ How we create change | Communities for a Better Environment&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; CBE also values scientific research to fully comprehend the direct and indirect consequences of toxicity and chemical secretion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Using secondary data and partnering with health providers and academic institutions, CBE practices human subjects research and online training for human subject protection via the National Institute of Health website.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Phil, Rachel Morello-Frosch, J G Brody, Rebecca Altman, Ruthann A Rudel, Laura Senier, Carla Pérez, and Ruth Simpson. "Institutional review board challenges related to community-based participatory research on human exposure to environmental toxins: A case study." Environmental Health 9.1 (2010): 4. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; They are effectively committed to finding ‘who’ and ‘where’ the most affected communities are today, as well as ways of prevention for the community's tomorrow. CBE uses [[Community-based participatory research]], by actively working together to gather their own research, which increases knowledge and awareness of local issues by creating a community where members are encouraged to participate in fighting against pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbecal.org/resources/why-we-research/ Why We Research | Communities for a Better Environment&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Outreach and awareness are promoted by leading toxic tours of oil refineries, ports, and facilities where community members share their personal stories sparking advocacy and a better understanding about pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/28/toxic-tours-of-los-angele_n_661289.html#s118600title=Communities_for_a Toxic Tours Of Los Angeles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The pay-it-forward affect, has the ability to reach thousands of communities by encouraging active participation against injustices.

===Case studies===
1. Community-Based Participatory Research as a Tool for Policy Change: A Case Study of the Southern California Environmental Justice Collaborative.&lt;ref name=cs1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petersen|first=Dana|author2=Minkler, Meredith |author3=Vasquez, Victoria Breckwich |author4= Baden, Andrea Corage |title=Community-Based Participatory Research as a Tool for Policy Change: A Case Study of the Southern California Environmental Justice Collaborative|journal=Review of Policy Research|date=March 2006|volume=23|issue=2|pages=339–354|doi=10.1111/j.1541-1338.2006.00204.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CBE collaborated with [[Liberty Hill Foundation]] and an academic research team from [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], [[Brown University]], and [[Occidental College]] to have Rule 1402 reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board Meeting|url=http://www.aqmd.gov/hb/2000/000335a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rule 1402, included in the [[South Coast Air Quality Management District]] was the state’s goal in 1994 to reduce public health risk from cancerous and noncancerous emissions by large industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule 1402|url=http://www.aqmd.gov/rules/reg/reg14/r1402.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum individual cancer risk was initially set at 100 cancer risks per million, yet due to CBE’s collaboration, it was reduced to 25 cancer risks per million 6 years later, representing a reduction in acceptable risk levels to 75%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Environmental Health Research|url=http://cjtc.ucsc.edu/docs/ej_finalpub201.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collaboration led to more efforts in the reduction of allowable risk level faced by various communities and encouraged the [[California Environmental Protection Agency]] to broaden their view on issues such as these, to put more emphasis on risk exposure when making new policies.&lt;ref name= cs1/&gt;

2. Linking Exposure Assessment Science With Policy Objectives for Environmental Justice and Breast Cancer Advocacy: The Northern California Household Exposure Study.&lt;ref name=cs2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brody|first=Julia Green|author2=Morello-Frosch, Rachel |author3=Zota, Ami |author4=Brown, Phil |author5=Pérez, Carla |author6= Rudel, Ruthann A. |title=Linking Exposure Assessment Science With Policy Objectives for Environmental Justice and Breast Cancer Advocacy: The Northern California Household Exposure Study|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=November 2009|volume=99|issue=S3|pages=S600–S609|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2008.149088|pmc=2774181}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
CBE’s research contributed to an investigation of a high amount of pollutants increasing a woman's chance of getting cancer. In the United States, African American women have the highest rate of cancer and mortality than any other race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breast Cancer Statistics|url=http://www.circleofpromise.org/africanamericanstatistics.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies reflect their chances are higher even when African American women have the same accessibility to mammograms and other treatments as white women.&lt;ref name= cs2/&gt; In a study done by Brody et al. indoor and outdoor air pollution, compared Richmond communities near oil refineries and shipping facilities with communities in Bolinas, a rural town just north of San Francisco found that Richmond had a higher concentration of pollutants in their indoor air. The study brought awareness to how indoor air can indicate and reflect outdoor air quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Methods Detect "Hotspots" of Cumulative Exposures in California Communities|url=http://coeh.berkeley.edu/bridges/Winter2013/Hotspots.html|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CBE worked to set up various sampling equipment in the interviewers’ homes, making the research more personal by having the interviewee feel comfortable with sharing their stories.&lt;ref name= cs1/&gt; The research method also allowed the community to be more knowledgeable of where the chemicals around them came from. By becoming aware, they are able to get involved in environmental justice and begin voicing their opinion. CBE connected scientific research with the personal aspect of interviewing which reassures people that they are not only a ‘test subject’, but those that have an honest voice in the fight for justice.

==Organizing California campaigns==

===Northern California===
CBE uses their Community Based Participatory Research method in cities throughout California, focusing on northern and southern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Northern California|url=http://www.cbecal.org/organizing/northern-california/}}&lt;/ref&gt; They focus on [[Richmond, California]] and [[East Oakland]] to make sure both cities have the resourced needed to reduce pollution. Richmond is known for the [[Chevron Richmond Refinery]], emitting various carcinogens to the communities that surround it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal investigation at Chevron refinery|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Criminal-investigation-at-Chevron-refinery-3886927.php|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oakland is home to the [[Port of Oakland]] which emits particulate matter and various fumes from the diesel trucks that transport material to and from the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Port of Oakland goes electric to reduce diesel pollution|url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/news/ci_24486230/port-oakland-goes-electric-reduce-diesel-pollution|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oakland====
*Neptune Society is a crematorium that planned to operate in East Oakland, exposing homes, churches, and schools to toxic emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neptune Society of Northern California|url=http://www.neptune-society.com|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=East Oakland residents protest Neptune Society|url=http://oaklandlocal.com/2013/12/8417/|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The crematorium was trying to work without a permit that would force them to regulate the amount of the pollutants emitted. In order to prevent such facilities from operating without a permit, CBE created an Emergency Ordinance plan that would prevent any crematorium from opening without first receiving a [[Special-use permit|Major Conditional Use Permit]] (CUP) from the city and ensure that they were being regulated under [[California Environmental Quality Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Group files suit over mega-crematorium proposal|url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/local/group-files-suit-over-mega-crematorium-proposal/ncJ8L/|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lawsuit Filed to Keep "Mega-Crematorium" Away from Oakland Community|url=http://www.allgov.com/usa/ca/news/controversies/lawsuit-filed-to-keep-mega-crematorium-away-from-oakland-community-131213?news=851900|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did this stop Neptune Society from opening, but it also paved the way for future crematoriums from operating without harsh enforcement.&lt;ref name=cityofoakland&gt;{{cite web|title=Oakland City Planning Commission|url=http://www2.oaklandnet.com/oakca1/groups/ceda/documents/agenda/oak042501.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*CBE also has partnerships with community organizations like the Allen Temple Baptist Church to make sure that Oakland residents are aware of new projects that are being planned but also that they are able to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GREENING THE GHETTO AND TRANSFORMING EAST OAKLAND|url=https://www.allen-temple.org/community-care/prophetic-justice/greening-the-ghetto/239-greening-the-ghetto-and-transforming-east-oakland|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Diesel trucks play a main role in transporting material from the port of Oakland, exposing the communities adjacent to the route ways to pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The High Cost of Health, Environment, and Worker Impacts of the Oakland Port Trucking System|url=http://www2.pacinst.org/reports/taking_a_toll/index.htm|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBE decided to investigate this and conducted a study to show the effects it has on the community.&lt;ref name=trucks&gt;{{cite web|title=Diesel Truck Study|url=http://www.cbecal.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Diesel-Truck-Study-Summary.pdf|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the report, East Oakland is the most affected by the fumes released by the trucks. CBE also fought for alternatives routes for trucks to take so that they can transport material avoiding going near vulnerable communities and minimizing their exposure.&lt;ref name=trucks/&gt;
*Oakland is often considered a [[food desert]] and CBE is working on increasing communities’ access to healthier food options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bringing Life to a Food Desert|url=http://www.thephilanthropicenterprise.org/by-the-people-for-the-people/|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have created an alliance with Sowing Seeds program with several east Oakland groups that work on developing healthy gardens throughout Oakland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=East Oakland Food Fact Sheet|url=http://www.cbecal.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Food-Justice-factsheet-FINAL-090811.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*There are synergistic effects that can be more toxic that one effect alone, and CBE released a report supporting this. With pollution and lack to healthy food access, one of CBE’s initiatives is to create Green Zones across the state, where CBE works to:&lt;ref name=gz&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Zones|url=http://www.cbecal.org/issues/green-zones/|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 &lt;blockquote&gt;

#Stepped up regulation and enforcement to hold polluting industries accountable;
#A community voice in making land-use decisions;
#Land use policies that prevent new pollution projects from locating in these communities;
#Focused private and public investment in local economic development;
#Support for businesses in the Green Zone that want to “green up” operations;
#Greening these communities by creating more parks, community gardens and urban farms, and developing green businesses and jobs.&lt;ref name= gz/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Chevron Richmond refinery====
CBE and two organizations conducted the research in the Richmond health survey and it showed that the chemical exposures in Richmond were extremely high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=A.|author2=Lopez, A. |author3=Malloy, N. |author4= Morello-Frosch, R. |title=Our Environment, Our Health: A Community-Based Participatory Environmental Health Survey in Richmond, California|journal=Health Education &amp; Behavior|date=8 July 2011 |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=198–209 |doi= 10.1177/1090198111412591 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   When contrasted with Bolinas, as seen in the case study, Richmond’s air pollution was far worse and this can be due to the Chevron Refinery. Chevron is the largest employer in town but as CBE research has shown, compared with the statewide average for all business activity oil refining creates ten times fewer jobs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5b&gt;{{cite web |title= A less-pollution, more-jobs land use policy to make Richmond a Green Zone |url= http://www.cbecal.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Richmond-Green-Zone-021012.pdf |accessdate= 22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 2009, CBE and other local organizations filed a petition to have the Chevron Refinery’s plan to expand looked at once more. Expanding its facility would have allowed them to process dirty crude oil, increasing greenhouse gases and toxic emissions to local communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chevron Refinery Expansion at Richmond, CA Halted|url=http://earthjustice.org/news/press/2009/chevron-refinery-expansion-at-richmond-ca-halted}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The expansion was stopped because CBE argued that the [[Environmental Impact Statement]] violated the [[California Environmental Quality Act]] since it didn’t take into consideration how this would increase the pollution in the city.&lt;ref name=courtcase&gt;{{cite web|title=Court Case|url=http://resources.ca.gov/ceqa/cases/2010/Communites_for_a_Better_Environment_v_City_of_Richmond.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Richmond came up with the General Plan 2030, and its goal is to become more sustainable and also develop healthy neighborhoods by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Richmond General Plan 2030|url=http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/index.aspx?nid=2608|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this plan, Richmond’s Planning Commission supported CBE’s campaign, Less Pollution, More Jobs in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More Jobs, Less Pollution: Growing the Recycling Economy in the U.S.|url=http://docs.nrdc.org/globalwarming/files/glo_11111401a.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign enforces regulation in facilities that emit toxic chemicals, and it would require them to use energy efficient equipment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Southern California===
CBE works with various southern California communities especially the most polluted in the country. The [[Los Angeles]] area, [[Riverside, California|Riverside]] communities, [[San Bernardino]], and [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] were ranked the smoggiest area in the nation in 2012 when it comes to air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State of the Air|url=http://www.stateoftheair.org/2013/msas/los-angeles-long-beach-riverside-ca.html#ozone|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBE works with other cities in southern California like Wilmington, Huntington Park, and the various cities that surround the Interstate 710, to minimize the exposure from residents living near it. The Southern California offices are also well versed in community active with subgroups of youths joining CBE ranks to fight environmental injustice in their heavily impacted, people of color communities. Beginning in 1997, the sub-program  Youth for Environmental Justice has extended in numbers over the past few year, displaying influence in California's capitol, Sacramento; to providing support to at the grassroot march in Paris 2016.  

====Huntington Park====
*[[Huntington Park, California|Huntington Park]] is near the Los Angeles area and air pollution is not the only environmental problem because it has a lot of “brownfields”, which are abandoned or unused land used for activities that may have left the land contaminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brownfields 2009 Cleanup Grant Fact Sheet  Huntington Park Community Development Commission,|url=http://cfpub.epa.gov/bf_factsheets/gfs/index.cfm?xpg_id=6647|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of now the EPA is funding this project and the city of Huntington Park, CBE, and local residents have begun the transformation from brownfield areas into sustainable areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPA taps local environmental group to develop Brownfields in Huntington Park|url=http://wavenewspapers.com/news/local/the_press/article_eb9f341a-e7d3-11e1-ba89-001a4bcf6878.html|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wilmington Area====
*CBE and other community groups are working with the [[Wilmington, Los Angeles, California|Wilmington]]/[[Carson, California|Carson]] area that is exposed to high amounts of local pollution.&lt;ref name=wreport&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilmington Refineries Report|url=http://www.cbecal.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/wilmington_refineries_report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exposure puts those communities at risk for various diseases, mainly cardiovascular and respiratory ones.&lt;ref name=airpol&gt;{{cite web|title=Air Quality &amp; Your Health|url=http://www.airhealthbc.ca/airquality.htm|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These communities have proposed a policy, which is Clean up, Green Up, and hopes to reduce and prevent pollution throughout mainly affected communities.&lt;ref name=cugu&gt;{{cite web|title=Clean Up Green Up, por una ciudad limpia y verde|url=http://cleanupgreenup.wordpress.com|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy hopes to create Green Zones in these communities where the shift to green, sustainable communities will be encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Los Angeles' 'green zone' plan is aimed at low-income, high-pollution areas|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/21/local/la-me-hazards-pacoima-20110121|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Clean Up Green Up policy was approved in Los Angeles City Council in 2011, and since then CBE has been working alongside the community in order to make this policy provide stronger regulation to polluting facilities.&lt;ref name= cugu/&gt;

====I-710====
*The Interstate 710 freeway is 23 miles long and it runs from the Long Beach port to the City of Alhambra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Long Beach Freeway (Interstate 710) Pavement Rehabilitation Project|url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist07/travel/projects/details.php?id=38.|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been planning to expand the I-710 in order to make it easier to transport to and from the port, but many oppose it because it will increase pollution leading to more exposure to the communities around it.&lt;ref name=lablog&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Government Committees Reject Current Plans to Widen 710 Between Long Beach and East LA|url=http://la.streetsblog.org/2013/02/05/three-government-committees-reject-current-plans-to-widen-710-between-long-beach-and-east-la/|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The No 710 Action Committee|url=http://www.no710.com|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBE worked with other organizations to create the Community Alternative 7 plan, which calls for improvements to be made along the I-710 to minimize pollution.&lt;ref name= lablog/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Activists Push for Alternative Plan in I-710 Corridor Project|url=http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/710-corridor/community-activists-push-for-alternative-plan-in-710-corridor-project.html|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collaborations and coalitions==
As an active statewide California environmental justice organization, CBE has built a number of strategic alliances over its 34 years of work to work with partners that share a common vision of building power in marginalized communities.&lt;ref name=movementbuilding&gt;{{cite web|title=Movement Building|url=http://www.cbecal.org/about/movement-building/|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are one of many organizations that make up the California Environmental Justice Alliance (CEJA), which organize in communities affected by pollution, working towards getting better protection for their community and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CEJA comment|url=http://www.oehha.ca.gov/ej/pdf/103012/CEJAComment.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 35 community-based organizations, including CBE, make up the Climate Justice Alliance (CJA) where they work towards the usage of sustainable energy in local communities.&lt;ref name="movementbuilding"/&gt; Grassroots Global Justice Alliance (GGJ), is made of various community groups including CBE, working with communities of color faced with the most environmental pollution and toxics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Members|url=http://ggjalliance.org/node/924}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to the expansion of the I-710, CBE and the Coalition for Environmental Health and Justice (CEHAJ) have worked together to create the Community Alternative 7 to improve the environmental conditions along I-710 corridor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I-710 Corridor Project|url=http://eycej.org/campaigns/i-710/}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBE focuses on the people employed by toxic facilities and works with Don’t Waste LA, in order to create a proposal for community protection to further exposure. This proposal would require them to reduce toxic waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LA’s History Lesson on Environmental Justice and Waste|url=http://www.dontwastela.com/2012/11/15/las-history-lesson-on-environmental-justice-and-waste/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Green LA Coalition, Communities for a Better Environment, and other environmental justice groups, are focusing on LA in order to minimize the communities’ exposure to pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dare to change report|url=http://funderservices.movementstrategy.org/a/wp-content/uploads/Dare_To_Change.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the chevron case CBE  also worked alongside Asian Pacific Environmental Network to have Chevron's permit reviewed.&lt;ref name="courtcase"/&gt;  Local Clean Energy Alliance is made up of 70 organizations that call for renewable energy, pollutant reduction, and green jobs in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advancing Clean Energy and Climate Solutions|url=http://www.baylocalize.org/local-clean-energy/advancing-clean-energy-and-climate-solutions}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a member of the Bay Area Environmental Health Collaborative (BAEHC)  working towards the reduction of pollution in vulnerable low income communities of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Members|url=http://www.baehc.org/organizations}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBE and Ditching Dirty Diesel work to bring awareness and advocacy on the issue of health problems and diesel pollution correlation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission|url=http://www.ditchingdirtydiesel.org/about/mission}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CBE also has a partnership with Richmond Equitable Development Initiative’s to brainstorm activities which may increase the communities’ advocacy for a specific problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Richmond Equitable Development Initiative|url=http://urbanhabitat.org/book/export/html/64}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CBE has been a member of the Oakland Climate Action Coalition (OCAC), their efforts have allowed the inclusion of climate justice and health policies into the Oakland’s Climate Action Plan.&lt;ref name="movementbuilding"/&gt;

==CBE in the media==
In recent media, Communities for a Better Environment is mentioned as being an expert in environmental issues advocating policy, organizational strategies, and seen on the forefronts of current issues and cases. CBE lawyer Shana Lazero, seen as an expert in power plants in low-income communities;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/elist/eListRead/what_does_a_future_without_nuclear_power_look_like_for_southern_california/ What Does a Future Without Nuclear Power Look Like for Southern California? | Latest News | Earth Island Journal | Earth Island Institute&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; CBE Attorney Maya Golden-Krasner, gives expertise on how agencies can help address needs of communities in toxic environments;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2014/feb/15/local/la-me-paramount-forge-20140216/2 Paramount residents not alone in pollution fight - Page 2 - Los Angeles Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Andres Soto, CBE organizer, expresses his discontent with the permit process of BAAQMD in local Bay Area newspaper and is featured in YouTube's News Channel, ''The Nation's'' moving eight-minute documentary about living in Richmond as living and breathing in the shadow of Chevron. The documentary also highlights injustices found in California [[Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006]] (AB32) cap-and-trade policy also known as [[emission trading]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmentalists Sue to Block Explosive Fracked Oil Shipments in Richmond|url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/SevenDays/archives/2014/03/31/environmentalists-sue-to-block-explosive-fracked-oil-shipments-in-richmond}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Living and Breathing in the Shadow of Chevron|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1d9oe18VXY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, CBE is mentioned in UK news outlet, The Guardian, as a key leader with Asian Pacific Environmental Network in fighting refinery and industry expansion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/millennials-finance-universities-divest-fossil-fuels Millennials use finance to challenge universities' fossil fuel addiction | Guardian Sustainable Business | Guardian Professional&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Local news station KTVU illustrates the tension as [[Richmond Chevron Refinery]] plans to expand as one of the largest refineries in California. Chevron's representative, says the one billion dollar expansion project will not increase crude oil, emissions, pollutants, health risk, or [[greenhouse gases]]. CBE's Greg Karras advocates on behalf of the community's skepticism for an informed review before moving forward in expansion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ktvu.com/videos/news/richmond-chevron-looks-to-modernize-troubled/vCTsqj/ RICHMOND: Chevron looks to modernize troubled refinery | www.ktvu.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084752/http://www.ktvu.com/videos/news/richmond-chevron-looks-to-modernize-troubled/vCTsqj/ |date=2014-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CBE's opinion and expertise is often highlighted as dual representation experts in environmental fields and community members. CBE encourages community members to share their stories in the media and the general public so that their experiences can affect people within and from other communities.

==Future==
CBE expresses urgency to implement and influence environmental justice in California. They are also committed to global participation in addressing present and future environmental concerns.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; CBE Communications Coordinator, Steven Low, says the future of CBE will involve [[Urban Agriculture]], Food Justice, and “Adaptation” as a response to [[Global Warming]] and [[Climate Change]]. CBE is sponsoring the Charge Ahead Campaign which will "help put one million electric cars, trucks and busses on California's roads, reducing air pollution, improving health and saving money".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chargeahead.org/ Charge Ahead California!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbecal.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/CA-Bill-aims-to-accelerate-number-of-electric-vehicles.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Charge Ahead is sponsored by several organizations and designated $200 million from the states cap and trade auctions, whereby CBE advocates for low income communities of color's access to zero emission transportation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenlining.org/issues/2014/statements-electric-vehicles-provisions-governors-2014-2015-budget-proposal-charge-ahead-california-groups/ Statements on Electric Vehicles Provisions - The Greenlining Institute&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Defensivism''' is a philosophical standpoint related in spirit to the [[Non-aggression principle]]. It is also a midway point between other combat-based philosophies, that of [[Just War]] and [[Pacifism]]. 

The standpoint of Defensivism is that only Defensive actions are moral. You may move to someone's aid as long as they are in immediate danger, or protect yourself from immediate harm. 

To a country, it holds that a military force may never leave its home country's own borders except to move to the aid of someone else (and in such a situation, that they may only protect sites from harm that they are specifically invited to, with no aggressive action taken whatsoever). 

Any form of preemptive strike, any type of capture, revenge, or any situation where one would fire the first actual shot or throw the first actual blow is against the Defensivist standpoint. Also, any form of combative action must cease the moment the opposition stops fighting, withdraws, gives up, or ceases aggressive action. 

Generally, Defensivism only allows the taking of life when the life that would be taken is actively threatening another life.

In standard [[mathematics]], propositions can typically be considered unambiguously true or false. For instance, the proposition ''zero belongs to the set { 1 }'' is regarded as simply false; while the proposition ''one belongs to the set { 1 }'' is regarded as simply true. However, some mathematicians, computer scientists, and philosophers have been attracted to the idea that a proposition might be ''more or less'' true, rather than wholly true or wholly false. Consider ''My coffee is hot''.

In [[mathematics]], this idea can be developed in terms of [[fuzzy logic]]. In [[computer science]], it has found application in [[artificial intelligence]]. In [[philosophy]], the idea has proved particularly appealing in the case of [[vagueness]]. Degrees of truth is an important concept in law.

'''Divine madness''', also known as '''theia mania''' and '''crazy wisdom''', refers to unconventional, outrageous, unexpected, or unpredictable behavior linked to religious or spiritual pursuits. Examples of ''divine madness'' can be found in [[Hellenistic religion|Hellenism]], [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sufism]], and [[Shamanism]].

It is usually explained as a manifestation of enlightened behavior by persons who have transcended societal norms, or as a means of [[spirituality|spiritual]] practice or teaching among mendicants and teachers. These behaviors may seem to be symptoms of mental illness to mainstream society, but are a form of [[religious ecstasy]], or deliberate  "strategic, purposeful activity,"{{sfn|DiValerio|2011|p=ii}} "by highly self-aware individuals making strategic use of the theme of madness in the construction of their public personas".{{sfn|DiValerio|2011|p=iii}}

==Cross-cultural parallels==
[[Image:Kanzanjittokuzur.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Yan Hui]] depicts the crazy-wise ''[[Hanshan (poet)|Han Shan]]'' 寒山. Color on silk. [[Tokyo National Museum]]]]
According to June McDaniel and other scholars, divine madness is found in the history and practices of many cultures and may reflect religious ecstasy or expression of divine love.&lt;ref name=aymard21&gt;{{cite book|author=Orianne Aymard|title=When a Goddess Dies: Worshipping Ma Anandamayi After Her Death|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eohSAwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-936862-4|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] in his ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' and his ideas on [[theia mania]], the [[Hasidic]] Jews, Eastern Orthodoxy, [[Western Christianity]], Sufism along with Indian religions all bear witness to the phenomenon of divine madness.{{sfn|McDaniel|1989|p=3-6}} It is not the ordinary form of madness, but a behavior that is consistent with the premises of a spiritual path or a form of complete absorption in God.&lt;ref name=aymard21/&gt;{{sfn|McLeod|2009|p=158-165}}

DiValerio notes that comparable "mad saint" traditions exist in Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic and Christian cultures, but warns against "flights of fancy" that too easily draw comparisons between these various phenomena.{{sfn|DiValerio|2015|p=3-4}}

[[Georg Feuerstein|Feuerstein]] lists [[Zen]]-poet [[Hanshan (poet)|Han-shan]] (fl. 9th century) as one of the divinely mad, explaining that when people would ask him about Zen, he would only laugh hysterically. The [[Zen]] master [[Ikkyu]] (15th century) used to run in his town with a human skeleton to spread the message of the impermanence of life and the grim certainty of death.{{sfn|Feuerstein|1991|p=69}} According to Feuerstein, similar forms of abnormal social behavior and holy madness is found in the history of the Christian saint [[St Isadora|Isadora]] and the [[Sufi]] Islam storyteller [[Mulla Nasruddin]].{{sfn|Feuerstein|1991|p=69}} Divine madness has parallels in others religions, such as Judaism and Hinduism.{{sfn|Horgan|2004|p=53}}&lt;ref name=kinsley270/&gt;

==Ancient Greece and Rome: theia mania==
''Theia mania'' ({{lang-grc|θεία μανία}}) is a term used by [[Plato]] and his protagonist [[Socrates]] to describe a condition of "divine madness" (unusual behavior attributed to the intervention of a god) in the [[Platonic dialogue]] ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Phaedrus'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhaedrus%3Asection%3D256b 256b], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Phaedrus+244&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174 244-255].&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, dating from around 370 BC, Socrates' character describes this state of [[divine inspiration]] as follows:
{{quote|In such families that accumulated vast wealth were found dire plagues and afflictions of the soul, for which mania devised a remedy, inasmuch as the same was a gift from God, if only to be rightly frenzied and possessed, using proper atonement rituals." &lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Phaedrus'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhaedrus%3Asection%3D244d 244d], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhaedrus%3Asection%3D244d 244d-244e].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Plato further described Divine Madness as a gift of god, with Socrates stating in ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', "in fact the best things we have comes from madness",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brendan Cook|title=Pursuing Eudaimonia: Re-appropriating the Greek Philosophical Foundations of the Christian Apophatic Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EMUwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA106 |year=2013|publisher= Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-4675-2|pages=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expounds upon the concept in Plato's [[Ion (dialogue)|''Ion'']].{{refn|group=note|See the article on the [[Ion (dialogue)|''Ion'']] for references.}} In eastern cultures, it has been deployed as a catalyst and means for the deeper understanding of spiritual concepts.{{sfn|Trungpa|2001|p=9-10}}

The poet [[Virgil]], in his ''[[Aeneid]]'', describes the Delphian priestess (''[[Pythia]]'') as prophesying in a frenzied state:
{{quote|...neither her face nor hue went untransformed; Her breast heaved; her wild heart grew large with passion.  Taller to their eyes, sounding no longer mortal, she prophesied what was inspired from The God breathing near, uttering words not to be ignored.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}}}

In the classical world, the phenomenon of "love at first sight" was understood within the context of a more general conception of passionate love, a kind of madness or, as the Greeks put it, ''theia mania'' ("madness from the gods").&lt;ref&gt;Tallis, Frank (February 2005). "Crazy for You". The Psychologist 18 (2).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abrahamic religions==
===Christianity===
The 6th-century [[Simeon the Holy Fool|Saint Simeon]], states Feuerstein, simulated insanity with skill. Simeon found a dead dog, tied a cord to the corpse's leg and dragged it through the town, outraging the people, but to Simeon the dead dog represented a form of baggage people carry in their spiritual life. He would enter the local church and throw nuts on the congregation during the liturgy, which he later explained to his friend was him denouncing the hypocrisy in worldly acts and prayers.{{sfn|Feuerstein|1991|p=69}}

The interpretation of madness in Christianity, states Screech, adopted the Platonic belief that madness comes in two forms: bad and good, depending on the assumptions about "the normal" by the majority.&lt;ref name="bynum27"&gt;{{cite book|author=M.A. Screech|editor=William F. Bynum et al.|title=The Anatomy of Madness: Essays in the History of Psychiatry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fikDW5RBSJQC|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-32383-3|pages=27–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Christians cherished madness, and being called "mad" by non-Christians.&lt;ref name="PorterPitts2012"/&gt; To them it was "glossolalia" or the "tongue of angels".&lt;ref name="PorterPitts2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dennis Macdonald|editor=Stanley E. Porter and Andrew W. Pitts|title=Christian Origins and Greco-Roman Culture: Social and Literary Contexts for the New Testament|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ts6ONz6oF0YC&amp;pg=PA467| year=2012|publisher= BRILL Academic|isbn= 90-04-23416-0|pages=467–468, 473–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christ's behavior and teachings were blasphemous madness in his times, and according to Simon Podmore, "Christ's madness served to sanctify blasphemous madness".&lt;ref name="Cook2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Podmore|editor=Christopher Cook|title=Spirituality, Theology and Mental Health: Multidisciplinary Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EHC2LrFYCM0C&amp;pg=PA194 |year=2013| publisher=London: SCM Press|isbn=978-0-334-04626-4|pages=193–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious ecstasy-type madness was interpreted as good by early Christians, with the help of the Platonic framework. Yet, as Greek philosophy went out of favor in Christian theology, so did these ideas. In the age of Renaissance, charismatic madness regained interest and popular imagination, as did the Socratic proposal of four types of "good madness":&lt;ref name="bynum27"/&gt;
#Prophesy, the manic art
#mystical revelations and initiations
#poetic arts
#madness of lovers
In theological context, these were interpreted in part as divine rapture, an escape from the restraint of society, a frenzy for freedom of the soul.&lt;ref name="bynum27"/&gt;

In the 20th-century, [[Pentecostalism]] – the charismatic movements within Protestant Christianity particularly in the United States, Latin America and Africa – has encouraged the practice of divine madness among its followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary Westfahl|title=A Day in a Working Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kaL0BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA465 |year=2015|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-61069-403-2|page=465}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Gordon Melton, [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pentecostalism Pentecostalism], Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; The wisdom and healing power in the possessed, in these movements, is believed to be from the Holy Spirit, a phenomenon called [[charism]] ("spiritual gifts"). According to Tanya Luhrmann, the associated "hearing of spiritual voices" may seem to be "mental illness" to many people, but to the followers who shout and dance together as a crowd it isn't.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tanya M. Luhrmann|title=When God Talks Back: Understanding the American Evangelical Relationship with God|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Sv8IY5ipJe8C|year= 2012|publisher= Random House|isbn=978-0-307-27727-5| pages=227–232, 237–245|chapter= Chapter 8: But are they crazy?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The followers believe that there is a long tradition in Christian spirituality, where saints such as [[Augustine]] are stated to have had similar experiences of deliberate hallucinations and madness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tanya M. Luhrmann|title=When God Talks Back: Understanding the American Evangelical Relationship with God|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Sv8IY5ipJe8C|year= 2012|publisher= Random House|isbn=978-0-307-27727-5| pages=244–246, 316, 373–383|chapter= Chapter 8: But are they crazy?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam: Sufism===
Other adepts that have attained "mad" mental states, according to Feuerstein, include the [[Mast (Sufism)|masts]] and the intoxicated Sufis associated with ''[[shath]]''.{{sfn|Feuerstein|2006|p=15f; 28-32}} In parts of Gilgit (Pakistan), the behavior of eccentric faqirs dedicated to mystical devotionalism is considered as "crazy holiness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Frembgen | first=JĂźrgen Wasim | title=Divine Madness and Cultural Otherness: Diwānas and Faqīrs in Northern Pakistan | journal=South Asia Research | publisher=SAGE Publications | volume=26 | issue=3 | year=2006 | pages=235–248 | doi=10.1177/0262728006071517 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Somalia, according to Sheik Abdi, Moḥammed ʻAbdulle Hassan eccentric behavior and methods led some colonial era writers to call him "mad mullah", "crazy priest of Allah" and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=ʻAbdi ʻAbdulqadir Sheik-ʻAbdi|title=Divine madness: Moḥammed ʻAbdulle Ḥassan (1856-1920)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EOhyAAAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Zed Books|pages=53–55, 84–85, 212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jalloh | first=Alusine | title=Divine Madness: Mohammed Abdulle Hassan (1856–1920) | journal=African Affairs | publisher=Oxford University Press | volume=94 | issue=375 | year=1995 | pages=301–302 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a098824 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sadeq Rahimi, the Sufi description of divine madness in mystical union mirrors those associated with mental illness.&lt;ref name=rahimi191/&gt; He writes,

{{quote|The similarities between the Sufi formulation of divine madness and the folk experience of psychosis are too clear and too frequent among the Turkish patients to be treated as coincidences.&lt;ref name=rahimi191&gt;{{cite book|author=Sadeq Rahimi|title=Meaning, Madness and Political Subjectivity: A Study of Schizophrenia and Culture in Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=im_ABgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-55551-3|pages=191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In West African version of Sufism, according to [[Lynda chouiten]], examples of insane saints are a part of ''Maraboutisme'' where the mad and idiotic behavior of a [[marabout]] was compared to a mental illness and considered a form of divine folly, of holiness. However, adds Chouiten, Sufism has been accommodating of such "divine madness" behavior unlike orthodox Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynda Chouiten|title=Isabelle Eberhardt and North Africa: Nomadism as a Carnivalesque Mirage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oGiPBQAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-8593-3|pages=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian religions==

===Hinduism===
The theme of divine madness appears in all major traditions of Hinduism (Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism), both in its mythologies as well as its saints, accomplished mendicants and teachers.&lt;ref name=kinsley270&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kinsley | first=David | journal=History of Religions | title= Through the Looking Glass: Divine Madness in the Hindu Religious Tradition | publisher=University of Chicago Press | volume=13 | issue=4 | year=1974 | pages=270–305 | doi=10.1086/462707 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are portrayed as if they are acting mad or crazy, challenging social assumptions and norms as a part of their spiritual pursuits or resulting thereof.&lt;ref name=kinsley270/&gt;

====''Avadhuta''====
According to Feuerstein, the designation ''[[Avadhuta|avadhūta]]'' (Sanskrit: अवधूत) came to be associated with the mad or eccentric holiness or "crazy wisdom" of some [[paramahamsa]], liberated religious teachers, who reverted the social norms, as symbolized by their being "skyclad" or "naked" (Sanskrit: [[digambara]]).{{sfn|Feuerstein|1991|p=105}}{{refn|group=note|Feuerstein: "The appellation "avadhuta," more than any other, came to be associated with the apparently crazy modes of behaviour of some paramahamsas, who dramatize the reversal of social norms, a behaviour characteristic of their spontaneous lifestyle. Their frequent nakedness is perhaps the most symbolic expression of this reversal."{{sfn|Feuerstein|1991|p=105}}}} ''Avadhuta'' are described in the [[Sannyasa Upanishads]] of Hinduism, early mediaeval Sanskrit texts that discuss the monastic (''[[sannyasa]]'', literally "house-leaver") life of Hindu ''sadhus'' (monks) and ''sadhvis'' (nuns). The ''Avadhuta'' is one category of mendicants, and is described as [[antinomian]]. The term means "shaken off, one who has removed worldly feeling/attachments, someone who has cast off all mortal concerns". He is described as someone who is actually wise and normal, but appears to others who don't understand him as "mad, crazy". His behavior may include being strangely dressed (or naked), sleeping in cremation grounds, acting like an animal, a "lunatic" storing his food in a skull, among others.{{sfn|Feuerstein|1991|pp=104-105}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Olivelle|authorlink=Patrick Olivelle|title=The Samnyasa Upanisads: Hindu Scriptures on Asceticism and Renunciation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fB8uneM7q1cC|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-536137-7|pages=107–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kinsley270/&gt; According to Feuerstein, "the ''avadhuta'' is one who, in his [or her] God-intoxication, has "cast off" all concerns and conventional standards."{{sfn|Feuerstein|1991|p=105}} Feuerstein further states that in traditional Tibet and India, "the "holy fool" or "saintly madman" [and madwoman] has long been recognized as a legitimate figure in the compass of spiritual aspiration and realization."{{sfn|Feuerstein|1991|p=105}}

====Bhakti====
The ''[[bhakti]]'' tradition emerged in Hinduism in the medieval era. It is related to [[religious ecstasy]], and its accompanying states of [[trance]] and intense emotions.{{sfn|McDaniel|1989|p=1-2}} According to McDaniel, devotional ecstasy is "a radical alteration of perception, emotion or personality which brings the person closer to what he regards as sacred."{{sfn|McDaniel|1989|p=2}} It may be compared to ''[[drsti]]'', direct perception or spontaneous thought, as opposed to learned ideas.{{sfn|McDaniel|1989|p=2}} The ''bhakta'' establishes a reciprocal relationship with the divine.{{sfn|McDaniel|1989|p=3}} Though the participation in the divine is generally favoured in [[Vaishnava]] bhakti discourse throughout the [[sampradayas]] rather than imitation of the divine 'play' (Sanskrit: [[lila (divine play)|''lila'']]), there is the important anomaly of the [[Vaishnava-Sahajiya]] sect.{{sfn|Dimock|1966}}

McDaniel notes that the actual behavior and experiences of ecstatics may violate the expected behavior as based on texts. While texts describe "stages of religious development and gradual growth of insight and emotion," real-life experiences may be "a chaos of states that must be forced into a religious mold," in which they often don't fit.{{sfn|McDaniel|1989|p=4}} This discrepancy may lead to a mistaken identification of those experiences as "mad" or "possessed," and the application of exorcism and Ayurvedic treatments to fit those ecstatics into the mold.{{sfn|McDaniel|1989|p=4}}

McDaniel refers to [[William James]], who made a distinction between gradual and abrupt change,{{sfn|McDaniel|1989|p=4}} while Karl Potter makes a distinction between ''progress'' and ''[[Subitism|leap]]'' philosophies.{{sfn|McDaniel|1989|p=5}} Progress philosophy is ''jativada'', gardual development; leap philosophy is ''[[ajativada]]'', "sudden knowledge or intuition."{{sfn|McDaniel|1989|p=5}} Both approaches can also be found in Bengal ''bhakti''. In ritual ecstasy, ''yogic'' and ''tantric'' practices have been incorporated, together with the idea of a gradual development through spiritual practices. For spontaneous ecstatics, the reverse is true: union with the divine leads to bodily control and detachment.{{sfn|McDaniel|1989|p=5}} The same distinction is central in the classical Zen-rhetorics on sudden insight, which developed in 7th-century China.{{sfn|McDaniel|1989|p=17}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Kenshō#Sudden insight]], and:&lt;br&gt;* {{Citation | editor-last =Gregory | editor-first =Peter N. | year =1991 | title =Sudden and Gradual.

Encounter, Transformation, and Genealogy in Chinese Chan Buddhism | place = | publisher =The University Press Group Ltd | isbn =978-0-520-23798-8}}&lt;br&gt;Bernard Faure, ''The Rhetorics of Immediacy''}}

The path of gradual progression is called ''sastriya dharma'', "the path of scriptural injunctions."{{sfn|McDaniel|1989|p=6}} It is associated with order and control, and "loyalty to lineage and tradition, acceptance of hierarchy and authority, and ritual worship and ptractice."{{sfn|McDaniel|1989|p=6}} In contrast, the path of sudden breakthrough is ''asastriya'', "not according to the sscriptures."{{sfn|McDaniel|1989|p=6}} It is associated with "chaos and passion, and the divine is reached by unpredictable visions and revelations."{{sfn|McDaniel|1989|p=6}} The divine can be found is such impure surroundings and items as burning grounds, blood and sexuality.{{sfn|McDaniel|1989|p=6}} Divine experience is not determined by loyalty to lineage and gurus, and various gurus may be followed.{{sfn|McDaniel|1989|p=6}} According to McDaniel, "divine madness" is a major aspect of this breakthrough approach.{{sfn|McDaniel|1989|p=6}}

===Tibetan Buddhism: ''nyönpa'', ''drubnyon'', and "Crazy Wisdom"===

====Holy Madmen====

In Tibetan Buddhism, ''[[nyönpa]]'' ({{bo|w=smyon pa}}), tantric "crazy yogis," are part of the [[Nyingma]]-tradition{{sfn|Curren|2008|p=43}}{{sfn|White|2001|p=16}}{{sfn|Pettit|2013}} and the [[Kagyu]]-tradition.{{sfn|DiValerio|2015|p=4}} Their behavior may seem to be scandalous, according to conventional standards,{{sfn|Pettit|2013}} but the archetypal ''[[siddha]]'' is a defining characteristic of the nyingma-tradition, which differs significantly from the more scholarly orientated Gelugpa-tradition.{{sfn|Pettit|2013}} Its founder, [[Padmasambhava]] (India, 8th century), is an archetypal ''siddha'', who is still commemorated by yearly dances.{{sfn|Pettit|2013}} [[Milarepa]] (c.1052–c.1135 CE), the founder of the Kagyu-school, is also closely connected to the notion of "divine madness" in Tibetan Buddhism.{{sfn|DiValerio|2015|p=4}} His biography was composed by [[Tsangnyön Heruka]] (1452-1507), "the Madman of Tsang," a famous ''nyönpa''.{{sfn|DiValerio|2015|p=5}} Other famous madmen are [[Drukpa Kunley]] (1455–1529) and the [[Ünyön Künga Zangpo|Madman of Ü]]. Together they are also known as "the Three Madmen" (''smyon pa gsum'').{{sfn|DiValerio|2015|p=6}} Indian siddhas, and their Tibetan counterparts, also played an essential role in the Tibetan Renaissance (c.950-1250 CE), when Buddhism was re-established in Tibet.{{sfn|Larson|2007}}

According to DiValerio, the Tibetan term ''nyönpa'' refers to ''siddhas'', ''yogins'' and ''lamas'' whose "mad" behavior is "symptomatic of high achievement in religious practice."{{sfn|DiValerio|2015|p=2}} This behavior is most widely understood in Tibet as "a symptom of the individuals being enlightened and having transcended ordinary worldly delusions."{{sfn|DiValerio|2015|p=7}} Their unconventional behavior is seen by Tibetans as a sign of their transcendence of ''namtok'' (Sanskrit: ''[[vipalka]]''), "conceptual formations or false ideations."{{sfn|DiValerio|2015|p=7}} While their behavior may be seen as repulsive from a dualistic point of view, the enlightened view transcends the dualistic view of repulsive and nonrepulsive.{{sfn|DiValerio|2015|p=7}}

It is regarded as manifesting naturally, not intentionally, though it is sometimes also interpreted as intentional behavior "to help unenlightened beings realize the emptiness of phenomena, or as part of the yogin's own training toward that realization."{{sfn|DiValerio|2015|p=7}} It may also be seen as a way of training, to transcend the boundaries of convention and thereby the boundaries of one's ordinary self-perception, giving way to "a more immediate way of experiencing the world - a way that is based on the truth of [[Sunyata|emptiness]], rather than our imperfect habits of mind."{{sfn|DiValerio|2015|p=8}} While the well-known ''nyönpa'' are considered to be fully enlightened, the status of lesser-known ''yogins'' remains unknown, and the nature of their unconventional behavior may not be exactly determinable, also not by ''lamas''.''{{sfn|DiValerio|2015|p=9}}

According to DiValerio, the term ''drupton nyönpa'' is regarded by Tibetans as an [[oxymoron]], a "contradictio in terminis": 
{{quote|An insane person cannot be a ''siddha'', and a ''siddha'', by definition, cannot be insane - at least, not in the medical understanding of madness.{{sfn|DiValerio|2015|p=6}}}}

Yet, DiValerio also argues that their unconventional behavior is "strategic, purposeful activity, rather than being the byproduct of a state of enlightenment,"{{sfn|DiValerio|2011|p=ii}} and concludes that "the "holy madman" tradition is constituted by highly self-aware individuals making strategic use of the theme of madness in the construction of their public personas,"{{sfn|DiValerio|2011|p=iii}} arguing that
{{quote|...the distinctive eccentric behavior of the Madmen of Ü and Tsang is best understood as a form of "tantric fundamentalism" in that it was based on following a literal reading of the Highest Yoga tantras, enacted as a strategic response to changes taking place in late 15th-century Tibetan religious culture. The "madness" of Drukpa Künlé resulted from his taking a critical stance towards Tibetan religious culture in general.{{sfn|DiValerio|2011|p=ii-iii}}}}

====Crazy Wisdom====
In some Buddhist literature, the phrase "crazy wisdom" is associated with the teaching methods of [[Chögyam Trungpa]],{{sfn|DiValerio|2015|p=242}} himself a Nyingma and [[Kagyu]] master, who popularized the notion with his adepts Keith Dowman and Georg Feuerstein.{{sfn|DiValerio|2015|p=241}}{{refn|group=note|name=DV-GF}} The term "crazy wisdom" translates the Tibetan term ''drubnyon'', a philosophy which "traditionally combines exceptional insight and impressive magical power with a flamboyant disregard for conventional behavior."{{sfn|Bell|2002|p=233}} In his book ''Crazy Wisdom'', which consists of transcripts of seminars on the eight aspects of [[Padmasambhava]] given in 1972,{{sfn|Trungpa|2001}} the Tibetan [[tülku]] Chögyam Trungpa describes the phenomenon as a process of enquiry and letting go of any hope for an answer:
{{quote|We go on deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper, until we reach the point where there is no answer. [...] At that point we tend to give up hope of an answer, or of anything whatsoever, for that matter. [...] This hopelessness is the essence of crazy wisdom. It is hopeless, utterly hopeless.{{sfn|Trungpa|2001|p=9-10}}{{refn|group=note|Trungpa: "Instead we explore further and further and further without looking for an answer. [...] We don't make a big point or an answer out of any one thing. For example, we might think that because we have discovered one particular thing that is wrong with us, that must be ''it'', that must be the problem, that must be the answer. No. We don't fixate on that, we go further. "Why is that the case?" We look further and further. We ask: "Why is this so?" Why is there spirituality? Why is there awakening? Why is there this moment of relief? Why is there such a thing as discovering the pleasure of spirituality? Why, why, why?" We go on deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper, until we reach the point where there is no answer. [...] At that point we tend to give up hope of an answer, or of anything whatsoever, for that matter. [...] This hopelessness is the essence of crazy wisdom. It is hopeless, utterly hopeless."{{sfn|Trungpa|2001|p=9-10}}}}}}

Since Chögyam Trungpa described crazy wisdom in various ways, DiValerio has suggested that Trungpa did not have a fixed idea of crazy wisdom.{{sfn|Divalerio|2015|p=239}}

According to DiValerio, Keith Dowman's ''The Divine Madman: The Sublime Life and Songs of Drukpa Kunley'' is "the single most influential document in shaping how Euro-Americans have come to think about Tibetan holy madman phenomenon."{{sfn|DiValerio|2011|p=27}} Dowman's understanding of the holymadmen is akin to the Tibetan interpretations, seeing the Tibetan holy madmen as "crazy" by conventional standards, yet noting that compared to the Buddhist spiritual ideal "it is the vast majority of us who are insane."{{sfn|DiValerio|2011|p=28-29}} Dowman also suggests other explanations for Drukpa Künlé’s unconventional behavior, including criticising institutionalized religion, and acting as a catalysator for direct insight.{{sfn|DiValerio|2011|p=29}} According to DiValerio, Dowman's view of Künlé as criticising Tibetan religious institutions is not shared by contemporary Tibetan religious specialist, but part of Dowman's own criticism of religious institutions.{{sfn|DiValerio|2011|p=31-32}} DiValerio further notes that "Dowman’s presentation of Drukpa Künlé as roundly anti-institutional [had] great influence [...] in shaping (and distorting) the Euro-American world’s thinking on the subject."{{sfn|DiValerio|2011|p=32}}{{refn|group=note|Compare [[Spiritual but not religious]].}}

According to Feuerstein, who was influenced by Chogyam Trungpa,{{sfn|DiValerio|2015|p=241}} ''divine madness'' is unconventional, outrageous, unexpected, or unpredictable behavior that is considered to be a manifestation of [[Spirituality|spiritual]] accomplishment.{{sfn|Royster|1992}} This includes archetypes like the [[holy fool]] and the [[trickster]].{{sfn|Royster|1992}}{{refn|group=note|name=DV-GF|DiValerio questions the reliability of Feuerstein's account: "Feuerstein is by his own admission an advocate of spirituality rather than a scholar of religion. But what he lacks in scholarly rigor, he makes up for in popular appeal and book sales. Unrestrained by indebtedness to traditional Tibetan ways of thinking or to scholarly standards, writers like Feuerstein and Dowman are free to tailor their accounts for western readers.{{sfn|DiValerio|2015|p=241}}}}

====Immediatism====
{{See also|Subitism|Mystical experience}}

[[Arthur Versluis]] notes that several or most of the teachers who are treated by Feuerstein as exemplary for "divine madness," or "crazy wisdom," are exemplary for "immediatism."{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=237}} These include [[Adi Da]], the teacher of Feuerstein, and [[Rajneesh]].{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=237}} "Immediatism" refers to "a religious assertion of spontaneous, direct, unmediated spiritual insight into reality (typically with little or no prior training), which some term [[Enlightenment (spirituality)|"enlightenment"]]."{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=2}} According to Versluis, immediatism is typical for Americans, who want "the fruit of religion, but not its obligations."&lt;ref name="AV-7Q"&gt;[https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/sacredmatters/2015/01/12/seven-questions-for-arthur-versluis/ ''American Gurus: Seven Questions for Arthur Versluis''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417164207/https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/sacredmatters/2015/01/12/seven-questions-for-arthur-versluis/ |date=April 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although immediatism has its roots in European culture and history{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=2}} as far back as [[Platonism]],{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=3}} and also includes [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]],{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=4}} Versluis points to [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] as its key ancestor,{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=2}} who "emphasized the possibility of immediate, direct spiritual knowledge and power."{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=3}}

Versluis notes that traditional Tibetan Buddhism is not immediatist, since Mahamudra and Dzogchen "are part of a fairly stricted controlled ritual and meditative practice and tradition."{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=238}} yet, he also refers to R.C. Zaehner, "who came to regard Asian-religion-derived [[nondualism]] as more or less inexorably to antonimianism, immorality, and social dissolution."{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=239}} Versluis further notes that in traditional Mahamudra and Dzogchen, access to teachings is restricted and needs preparation.{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=239-240}} Versluis further notes that immediatist teachers may be atttractive due to their sense of certainty, which contrasts with the post-modernist questioning of truth-claims.{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=240-244}} He further notes the lack of compassion which is often noted in regard to those immediatist teachers.{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=244}}

==Shamanism==
{{expand section|date=May 2017}}
According to [[Mircea Eliade]], divine madness is a part of [[Shamanism]], a state that a pathologist or psychologist is likely to diagnose as a mental disease or aberrant psychological condition. However, state Eliade and Harry Eiss, this would be a misdiagnosis because the Shaman is "in control of the mystic state, rather than the psychotic state being in control of him".&lt;ref name=eiss372/&gt; A Shaman predictably enters into the trance state, with rituals such as music and dance, then comes out of it when he wants to. A mental illness lacks these characteristics. Further, at least to the participants, the Shaman's actions and trance has meaning and power, either as a healer or in another spiritual sense.&lt;ref name=eiss372&gt;{{cite book|author=Harry Eiss|title=Divine Madness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IxwrBwAAQBAJ |year=2011|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-3329-5|pages=372–374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mircea Eliade|title=Myths, dreams and mysteries: the encounter between contemporary faiths and archaic realities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L5qpgsMIEW4C |year=1975|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|pages=79–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Donkey sentences''' are sentences that contain a [[pronoun]] whose reference is clear to the reader (it is [[Bound variable pronoun|bound]] [[semantics|semantically]]) but whose [[syntax|syntactical]] role in the sentence poses challenges to [[Linguist|grammarian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Emar Maier describes donkey pronouns as "bound but not [[c-command]]ed" in a [[Linguist List]] [http://www.linguistlist.org/issues/17/17-3393.html review] of Paul D. Elbourne's ''Situations and Individuals'' ([[MIT Press]], 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barker and Shan define a donkey pronoun as "a pronoun that lies outside the restrictor of a [[Quantification (linguistics)|quantifier]] or the [[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] of a [[Conditional clause|conditional]], yet [[covariance|covaries]] with some [[Quantification (linguistics)|quantification]]al element inside it, usually an [[indefinite article|indefinite]]." Chris Barker and Chung-chieh Shan, [http://www.semanticsarchive.net/Archive/2Y2ODI4Z/barker-shan-donkeys.pdf 'Donkey Anaphora is Simply Binding'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515210049/http://www.semanticsarchive.net/Archive/2Y2ODI4Z/barker-shan-donkeys.pdf |date=May 15, 2008 }}, colloquium presentation, Frankfurt, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The pronoun in question is sometimes termed a '''donkey pronoun''' or '''donkey [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]]'''.

The following sentences are examples of donkey sentences.
*Omne homo habens asinum videt illum. ("Every man who owns a donkey sees it") — [[Walter Burley]] (1328), ''De puritate artis logicae tractatus longior''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EYCSacIK_-EC|title=De puritate artis logicae tractatus longior|author=Gualterus Burlaeus|publisher=Meiner Verlag|date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3_1snsgmqU8C&amp;pg=PA269&amp;lpg=PA269|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Semantics|author=Keith Allan|publisher=Elsevier|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Every farmer who owns a donkey beats it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reference and Generality|author=[[Peter Geach]]|date=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Every police officer who arrested a murderer insulted him.

Such sentences defy straightforward attempts to generate their [[formal language]] equivalents. The difficulty is with understanding how English speakers [[parsing|parse]] such sentences.&lt;ref&gt;David Lewis describes this as his motivation for considering the issue in the introduction to ''Papers in Philosophical Logic'', a collection of reprints of his articles. "There was no satisfactory way to assign relative scopes to quantifier phrases." ([[Cambridge University Press|CUP]], 1998: 2.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Walter Burley]], a medieval scholastic philosopher, introduced donkey sentences in the context of the theory of ''[[supposition theory|suppositio]]'', the medieval equivalent of reference theory.

Peter Geach reintroduced donkey sentences as a [[counterexample]] to [[Richard Montague]]'s proposal for a generalized formal representation of [[Quantification (linguistics)|quantification]] in [[natural language]] (see Geach 1962). His example was reused by [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] (1975), [[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans]] (1977) and many others, and is still quoted in recent publications.

==Features==
Features of the sentence, "Every farmer who owns a donkey beats it," require careful consideration for adequate description (though reading "each" in place of "every" does simplify the formal analysis). The donkey pronoun in this case is the word ''it''. The [[indefinite article]] 'a' is normally understood as an [[existential quantifier]], but the most natural reading of the donkey sentence requires it to be understood as a nested [[universal quantifier]].

There is nothing wrong with donkey sentences: they are grammatically correct, they are well-formed, their syntax is regular. They are also logically meaningful, they have well-defined [[truth conditions]], and their semantics are unambiguous. However, it is difficult to explain how donkey sentences produce their semantic results, and how those results generalize consistently with all other language use. If such an analysis were successful, it might allow a computer program to accurately translate natural language forms into [[logical form]].&lt;ref&gt;Alistair Knott, [http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/staffpriv/alik/papers/cirevision.pdf 'An Algorithmic Framework for Specifying the Semantics of Discourse Relations',] ''Computational Intelligence'' '''16''' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; The question is, how are natural language users, apparently effortlessly, agreeing on the meaning of sentences like these?

There may be several equivalent ways of describing this process. In fact, [[Hans Kamp]] (1981) and [[Irene Heim]] (1982) independently proposed very similar accounts in different terminology, which they called [[discourse representation theory]] (DRT) and [[file change semantics]] (FCS) respectively.

In 2007, Adrian Brasoveanu published studies of donkey pronoun analogs in [[Hindi]], and analysis of complex and [[modal logic|modal]] versions of donkey pronouns in English.

==Discourse representation theory==
{{expert|logic|section|reason=The exposition is confused and confusing; parts of it are wrong}}
Donkey sentences became a major force in advancing [[semantics|semantic]] research in the 1980s, with the introduction of [[discourse representation theory]] (DRT). During that time, an effort was made to settle the inconsistencies which arose from the attempts to translate donkey sentences into [[first-order logic]]. 

Donkey sentences present the following problem, when represented in first-order logic: The systematic translation of every existential expression in the sentence into existential quantifiers produces an incorrect representation of the sentence, since it leaves a free occurrence of the variable y in BEAT(''x''.''y''):

: &lt;math&gt;  \forall x\, (\text{FARMER} (x) \land \exists y \,( \text{DONKEY}(y) \land \text{OWNS}(x,y)) \rightarrow \text{BEAT}(x,y)) &lt;/math&gt;

Trying to extend the scope of existential quantifier also does not solve the problem:

: &lt;math&gt;  \forall x \,\exists y\, (\text{FARMER} (x) \land \text{DONKEY}(y) \land \text{OWNS}(x,y) \rightarrow \text{BEAT}(x,y)) &lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the logical translation fails to give correct truth conditions to donkey sentences:  Imagine a farmer not beating his donkey. The formula will be true in that situation, because for each farmer we need to find at least one object that either is not a donkey, or not owned by this farmer, or is beaten by the farmer. Hence, if this object denotes a pig he also owns, anything unrelated, or even the farmer himself, the sentence will be true in that situation.

A correct translation into first-order logic for the donkey sentence seems to be:

: &lt;math&gt;  \forall x\, \forall y\, ((\text{FARMER} (x) \land \text{DONKEY}(y) \land \text{OWNS}(x,y)) \rightarrow \text{BEAT}(x,y)) &lt;/math&gt;

Unfortunately, this translation leads to a serious problem of inconsistency. One possible interpretation, for example, might be that every farmer that owns any donkeys beats every donkey. Clearly this is rarely the intentional meaning. Indefinites must sometimes be interpreted as existential quantifiers, and other times as universal quantifiers, without any apparent regularity. 

The solution that [[Discourse representation theory|DRT]] provides for the donkey sentence problem can be roughly outlined as follows: The common semantic function of non-anaphoric [[noun phrase]]s is the introduction of a new [[discourse referent]], which is in turn available for the binding of anaphoric expressions. No quantifiers are introduced into the representation, thus overcoming the scope problem that the logical translations had.

'''Louisa Edith Church Maryon''' (9 February 1872 in [[London]] &amp;ndash; 2 May 1924 in [[Dornach]], [[Switzerland]]), better known as '''Edith Maryon''', was an English [[sculptor]]. Along with [[Ita Wegman]], she belonged to the innermost circle of founders of [[anthroposophy]] and those around [[Rudolf Steiner]].&lt;ref name=EM&gt;Paull, John (2018) [https://www.academia.edu/37021855/A_Portrait_of_Edith_Maryon_Artist_and_Anthroposophist "A Portrait of Edith Maryon: Artist and Anthroposophist"], Journal of Fine Arts, 1(2):8-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Edith Maryon was the second of six children. Her parents were John Maryon Simeon and his wife Louisa Church who lived in London where she grew up. She attended a girls school and later went to a boarding school in the Swiss city of [[Geneva]]. During the 1890s she studied sculpture in [[London]] at the Central School of Design, and from 1896 at the [[Royal College of Arts]]. She exhibited at the Royal Academy. Her works of that period showed her leaning toward the subject of Christianity, such as a model of Michael, the relief ''The Seeker of Divine Wisdom'' and ''The Cross of Golgotha''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Representative of Humanity Between Lucifer and Ahriman'', von Halle and Wilkes (2010) {{ISBN|9781855842397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maryon met Rudolf Steiner in 1912/13 and after the summer of 1914 she moved to [[Dornach]]. She worked with Steiner on the construction of the [[Goetheanum#First Goetheanum|first Goetheanum]], and with him on the modelling and carving of the wooden sculpture ''The Representative of Humanity''. Steiner designed the nine-metre high sculpture to be placed in the first Goetheanum. Now on permanent display at the second Goetheanum, it shows a central, free-standing Christ holding a balance between the beings of [[Lucifer]] and [[Ahriman]], representing opposing tendencies of expansion and contraction.&lt;ref&gt;''The Representative of Humanity Between Lucifer and Ahriman, The Wooden Model at the Goetheanum'', Judith von Halle, John Wilkes (2010) {{ISBN|9781855842397}} from the German ''Die Holzplastik des Goetheanum'' (2008)[http://www.rudolfsteinerpress.com/pages/viewbook.php?isbn_in=9781855842397]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner ''Christ in Relation to Lucifer and Ahriman'', lecture May, 1915 [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/19150518p01.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture was intended to present, in contrast to Michelangelo's [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|Last Judgment]], Christ as mute and impersonal such that the beings that approach him must judge themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''The Etheric Body as a Reflexion of the Universe'' lecture, June 1915 [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/19150613p01.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

At a foundation meeting held during Christmas 1923 Steiner nominated Maryon as leader of the Section for the Plastic Arts at the Goetheanum&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''Constitution of the School of Spiritual Science: Its arrangement in Sections'' 1964, republished 2013, p.22. {{ISBN|9781855843820}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EM&gt;Paull, John (2018) [https://www.academia.edu/37021855/A_Portrait_of_Edith_Maryon_Artist_and_Anthroposophist "A Portrait of Edith Maryon: Artist and Anthroposophist"], Journal of Fine Arts, 1(2):8-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  (or Sculptural Arts)&lt;ref&gt;Record of Foundation meeting 1923, session of 28 December, 10 a.m. {{ISBN|0880101938}} [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA260/English/AP1990/19231228a01.html]&lt;/ref&gt; (German ''Sektion für Bildende Künste'').&lt;ref&gt;Currently known as "fine arts" or "visual arts": Bildende,[https://www.goetheanum.org/Sektion-fuer-Bildende-Kuenste.393.0.html?&amp;L=0.]

{{Buddhism}}

The English term '''''enlightenment''''' is the western translation of the abstract noun '''''bodhi''''', ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|d|i}}; [[Sanskrit]]: [[wikt:बोधि#Sanskrit|बोधि]]; [[Pali]]: ''bodhi''), the knowledge or wisdom, or awakened intellect, of a Buddha.&lt;ref name="MN_bodhi"/&gt; The verbal root ''budh-'' means "to awaken," and its literal meaning is closer to "awakening." Although its most common usage is in the context of [[Buddhism]], the term ''[[buddhi]]'' is also used in other Indian philosophies and traditions. The term "enlightenment" was popularised in the Western world through the 19th century translations of [[Max Müller]]. It has the western connotation of a sudden insight into a transcendental truth or reality.

The term is also being used to translate several other Buddhist terms and concepts, which are used to denote insight (''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]]'', ''[[kensho]]'' and ''[[satori]]'');{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|2008|p=5051, lemma "bodhi"}} knowledge (''[[vidhya]]''); the "blowing out" (''[[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]]'') of disturbing emotions and desires and the subsequent freedom or release (''[[vimutti]]''); and the attainment of [[Buddhahood]], as exemplified by [[Gautama Buddha]].

What exactly constituted the Buddha's awakening is unknown. It may probably have involved the knowledge that liberation was attained by the combination of mindfulness and ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]'', applied to the understanding of the arising and ceasing of craving. The relation between ''dhyana'' and insight is a core problem in the study of Buddhism, and is one of the fundamentals of Buddhist practice.

In the western world the concept of [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|(spiritual) enlightenment]] has taken on a romantic meaning. It has become synonymous with [[self-realization]] and the [[true self and false self]], being regarded as a substantial essence being covered over by social conditioning.{{sfn|Carrette|King|2005}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

==Etymology==
''Bodhi'', [[Sanskrit]] बोधि,&lt;ref name="SDSS_bodhi"&gt;Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, [http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&amp;script=hk&amp;tran_input=bodhi&amp;direct=au ''bodhi'']&lt;/ref&gt; "awakening,"{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=50}} "perfect knowledge,"&lt;ref name="SDSS_bodhi"/&gt; "perfect knowledge or wisdom (by which a man becomes a बुद्ध [Buddha&lt;ref name="SDSS_budh"/&gt;] or जिन [''jina'', ''arahant''; "victorious," "victor"&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary, [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/indexcaller.php ''jina'']&lt;/ref&gt;], the illuminated or enlightened intellect (of a Buddha or जिन)."&lt;ref name="MN_bodhi"&gt;Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary, [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/indexcaller.php ''bodhi'']&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an [[abstract noun]], formed from the verbal root ''*budh-'',{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=50}} Sanskrit बुध,&lt;ref name="SDSS_budh"&gt;Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, [http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&amp;script=hk&amp;tran_input=budh&amp;direct=au ''budh'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MW_budh"/&gt; "to awaken, to know,"{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=50}} "to wake , wake up , be awake,"&lt;ref name="MW_budh"&gt;Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary, [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/indexcaller.php ''budh'']&lt;/ref&gt; "to recover consciousness (after a swoon),"&lt;ref name="MW_budh"/&gt; "to observe , heed , attend to."&lt;ref name="MW_budh"/&gt;

It corresponds to the verbs ''bujjhati'' (Pāli) and ''bodhati'', बोदति, "become or be aware of, perceive, learn, know, understand, awake"&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, [http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&amp;script=hk&amp;tran_input=bodhati&amp;direct=au ''bodhati'']&lt;/ref&gt;or ''budhyate'' (Sanskrit).

The feminine Sanskrit noun of ''*budh-'' is बुद्धि, ''[[buddhi]]'', "prescience, intuition, perception, point of view."&lt;ref name="SDSS_budh"/&gt;

==Translation==
Robert S. Cohen notes that the majority of English books on Buddhism use the term "enlightenment" to translate the term ''bodhi''.{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=1}} The root ''budh'', from which both ''bodhi'' and ''Buddha'' are derived, means "to wake up" or "to recover consciousness".{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=1}} Cohen notes that ''bodhi'' is not the result of an ''[[Illuminationism|illumination]]'', but of a path of realization, or coming to understanding.{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=1}} The term "enlightenment" is event-oriented, whereas the term "awakening" is process-oriented.{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=1}} The western use of the term "enlighten" has Christian roots, as in Calvin's "It is God alone who enlightens our minds to perceive his truths".{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=2}}

Early 19th century ''bodhi'' was translated as "intelligence".{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=2}} The term "enlighten" was first being used in 1835, in an English translation of a French article,{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=2-3}} while the first recorded use of the term 'enlightenment' is credited (by the Oxford English Dictionary) to the ''Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal'' (February, 1836). In 1857 ''The Times'' used the term "the Enlightened" for the Buddha in a short article, which was reprinted the following year by [[Max Müller]].{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=3}} Thereafter, the use of the term subsided, but reappeared with the publication of Max Müller's ''Chips from a german Workshop'', which included a reprint from the ''Times''-article. The book was translated in 1969 into German, using the term "der Erleuchtete".{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=9}} Max Müller was an [[Perennial philosophy|essentialist]], who believed in a [[natural religion]], and saw religion as an inherent capacity of human beings.{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=4}} "Enlightenment" was a means to capture natural religious truths, as distinguished from mere mythology.{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=6-7}}{{refn|group=note|See also [http://www.here-now4u.de/eng/theosophy_or_pantheism__friedr.htm Lourens Peter van den Bosch, ''Theosophy or Pantheism? Friedrich Max Müller's Gifford Lectures on Natural Religion'']: "The three principal themes of his Gifford lectures on natural religion were the discovery of God, the discovery of the soul, and the discovery of the oneness of God and soul in the great religions of the world."}}

By the mid-1870s it had become commonplace to call the Buddha "enlightened", and by the end of the 1880s the terms "enlightened" and "enlightenment" dominated the English literature.{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=3}}

''[[Bodhi]]'' (Sanskrit, Pāli), from the verbal root ''budd'', "to awaken", "to understand",{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=40}} means literally "to have woken up and understood".{{sfn|Schreiber-Fischer|2008|p=50}} According to [[Johannes Bronkhorst]],{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} Tillman Vetter,{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} and K.R.

According to Norman, ''bodhi'' may basically have meant the knowledge that ''nibbana'' was attained,{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=30}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxix, xxxi}} due to the practice of ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=29}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} Originally only "prajna" may have been mentioned,{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} and Tillman Vetter even concludes that originally dhyana itself was deemed liberating, with the stilling of pleasure of pain in the fourth jhana, not the gaining of some perfect wisdom or insight.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} Gombrich also argues that the emphasis on insight is a later development.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}}

In [[Theravada]] Buddhism, ''bodhi'' refers to the realisation of the [[four stages of enlightenment]] and becoming an  [[Arahant]].{{sfn|Schreiber-Fischer|2008|p=50}} In Theravada Buddhism, ''bodhi'' is equal to supreme insight, and the realisation of the four noble truths, which leads to deliverance.{{sfn|Schreiber-Fischer|2008|p=50}} According to Nyanatiloka,
{{quote|(Through Bodhi) one awakens from the slumber or stupor (inflicted upon the mind) by the defilements (''[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kilesa]]'', q.v.) and comprehends the [[Four Noble Truths]] (''[[sacca]]'', q.v.)''.{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=40}}}}

This equation of ''bodhi'' with the four noble truths is a later development, in response to developments within Indian religious thought, where "liberating insight" was deemed essential for [[Moksha|liberation]].{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} The four noble truths as the liberating insight of the Buddha eventually were superseded by [[Pratītyasamutpāda]], the twelvefold chain of causation, and still later by anatta, the emptiness of the self.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}

In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, ''bodhi'' is equal to ''prajna'', insight into the [[Buddha-nature]], [[sunyata]] and [[tathatā]].{{sfn|Schreiber-Fischer|2008|p=51}} This is equal to the realisation of the non-duality of [[Two truths doctrine|absolute and relative]].{{sfn|Schreiber-Fischer|2008|p=51}}

====Prajna====
In Theravada Buddhism ''pannā'' (Pali) means "understanding", "wisdom", "insight".{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=150}} "Insight" is equivalent to ''[[vipassana]]''', insight into the three marks of existence, namely ''[[anicca]]'', ''[[dukkha]]'' and ''[[anatta]]''.{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=150}} Insight leads to the four stages of enlightenment and Nirvana.{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=150}}

In Mahayana Buddhism [[Wisdom in Buddhism|Prajna]] (Sanskrit) means "insight" or "wisdom", and entails insight into ''sunyata''. The attainment of this insight is often seen as the attainment of  "enlightenment".{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|2008|p=281}}{{Request quotation|date=January 2015}}

====Kensho and satori====
''[[Kensho]]'' and ''[[Satori]]'' are Japanese terms used in [[Zen]] traditions. ''Kensho'' means "seeing into one's true nature." ''Ken'' means "seeing", ''sho'' means "nature", "essence",{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}} c.q Buddha-nature. ''Satori'' (Japanese) is often used interchangeably with kensho, but refers to the ''experience'' of kensho.{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}} The [[Rinzai school|Rinzai]] tradition sees ''kensho'' as essential to the attainment of [[Buddhahood]], but considers [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|further practice]] essential to attain Buddhahood.

East-Asian (Chinese) Buddhism emphasizes insight into Buddha-nature. This term is derived from Indian tathagata-garbha thought, "the womb of the thus-gone" (the Buddha), the inherent potential of every sentient being to become a Buddha. This idea was integrated with the Yogacara-idea of the ''ālaya vijñāna'', and further developed in Chinese Buddhism, which integrated Indian Buddhism with native Chinese thought. Buddha-nature came to mean both the potential of awakening ''and'' the whole of reality, a dynamic interpenetration of absolute and relative. In this awakening it is realized that observer and observed are not distinct entities, but mutually co-dependent.{{sfn|Lusthaus|1998}}{{sfn|Lai|2003}}

===Knowledge===
The term ''vidhya'' is being used in contrast to ''[[avidhya]]'', ignorance or the lack of knowledge, which binds us to [[samsara]]. The ''Mahasaccaka Sutta''{{refn|group=note|Majjhima Nikaya chapter 36}} describes the three knowledges which the Buddha attained:{{sfn|Bikkhu Nanamoli|1995|p=340-342}}{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=47–48}}{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=27}}
# Insight into his past lives
# Insight into the workings of [[Karma]] and [[Reincarnation]]
# Insight into the [[Four Noble Truths]]

According to Bronkhorst, the first two knowledges are later additions, while insight into the four truths represents a later development, in response to concurring religious traditions, in which "liberating insight" came to be stressed over the practice of ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}

===Freedom===
Vimutti, also called moksha, means "freedom",{{sfn|Bowker|1997}} "release",{{sfn|Bowker|1997}}{{refn|group=note|See [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O101-Vimutti.html Encyclopedia.com, ''Vimutti'']}} "deliverance".{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=239}} Sometimes a distinction is being made between ''ceto-vimutti'', "liberation of the mind", and ''panna-vimutti'', "liberation by understanding".{{sfn|Gombrich|2005|p=147}} The Buddhist tradition recognises two kinds of ''ceto-vimutti'', one temporarily and one permanent, the last being equivalent to ''panna-vimutti''.{{sfn|Gombrich|2005|p=147}}{{refn|group=note|According to Gombrich, this distinction is artificial, and due to later, too literal, interpretations of the suttas.{{sfn|Gombrich|2005|p=147-148}}}}

[[Yogacara]] uses the term ''āśraya parāvŗtti'', "revolution of the basis",{{sfn|Park|1983|p=126-132}} 
{{quote|... a sudden revulsion, turning, or re-turning of the [[Eight Consciousnesses#Ālayavijñāna|ālaya vijñāna]] back into its original state of purity [...] the Mind returns to its original condition of non-attachment, non-discrimination and non-duality".{{sfn|Park|1983|p=127}}}}

===Nirvana===
Nirvana is the "blowing out" of disturbing emotions, which is the same as liberation.&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin"&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/sutra/level2_lamrim/intermediate_scope/nirvana_enlightenment/transcript.html Dr. Alexander Berzin, ''Nirvana and enlightenment'']&lt;/ref&gt; The usage of the term "enlightenment" to translate "nirvana" was popularized in the 19th century, due, in part, to the efforts of Max Muller, who used the term consistently in his translations.{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=8}}

==Buddha's awakening==

===Buddhahood===
[[Buddhahood#The 3 Types of Buddhahood|Three types of buddha]] are recognized:{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=81}} 
* [[Arhat (Buddhism)|Arhat]] ([[Pali]]: ''arahant''), those who reach Nirvana by following the teachings of the Buddha.{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=81}} Sometimes the term [[Savakabuddha|Śrāvakabuddha]] (Pali: ''sāvakabuddha'') is used to designate this kind of awakened person{{citation needed|date=December 2011}};
* [[Pratyekabuddha]]s (Pali: ''paccekabuddha''), those who reach Nirvana through self-realisation, without the aid of spiritual guides and teachers, but don't teach the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]];{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=81}}
* Samyaksambuddha (Pali: ''samma sambuddha''), often simply referred to as ''Buddha'', one who has reached Nirvana by his own efforts and wisdom and teaches it skillfully to others.{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=81}}

[[Siddhartha Gautama]], known as the Buddha, is said to have achieved full awakening, known as ''samyaksaṃbodhi'' (Sanskrit; Pāli: ''sammāsaṃbodhi''), "perfect Buddhahood", or ''anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi'', "highest perfect awakening".{{sfn|Mäll|2005|p=83}}

The term buddha has acquired somewhat [[Buddhology|different meanings]] in the various Buddhist traditions. An equivalent term for [[Buddha]] is [[Tathāgata]], "the thus-gone". The [[Buddhist Paths to liberation|way to Buddhahood]] is somewhat differently understood in the various buddhist traditions.

===The awakening of the Buddha===

====Canonical accounts====
In the [[suttapitaka]], the Buddhist canon as preserved in the [[Theravada]] tradition, a couple of texts can be found in which the Buddha's attainment of liberation forms part of the narrative.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=45-50}}&lt;ref name="faure_1991"&gt;{{harvcolnb|Faure|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|See Majjhima Nikaya chapter 4, 12, 26 &amp; 36}}

The ''Ariyapariyesana Sutta'' (Majjhima Nikaya 26) describes how the Buddha was dissatisfied with the teachings of [[Alara Kalama]] and [[Uddaka Ramaputta]], wandered further through Magadhan country, and then found "an agreeable piece of ground" which served for striving. The sutra then only says that he attained Nibbana.{{sfn|Bikkhu Nanamoli|1995|p=259}}

In the ''Vanapattha Sutta'' (Majjhima Nikaya 17){{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli|1995}} the Buddha describes life in the jungle, and the attainment of awakening. The ''Mahasaccaka Sutta'' (Majjhima Nikaya 36) describes his ascetic practices, which he abandoned. There-after he remembered a spontaneous state of jhana, and set out for jhana-practice. Both suttras narrate how, after destroying the [[Sankhara|disturbances of the mind]], and attaining [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|concentration of the mind]], he attained three knowledges (vidhya):{{sfn|Bikkhu Nanamoli|1995|p=340-342}}{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=47–48}}{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=27}}
# Insight into his past lives
# Insight into the workings of [[Karma]] and [[Reincarnation]]
# Insight into the [[Four Noble Truths]]

Insight into the [[Four Noble Truths]] is here called awakening.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=47-48}} The monk (''[[bhikkhu]]'') has {{quote|...attained the unattained supreme security from bondage.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli|1996|p=199}}}}

Awakening is also described as synonymous with [[Nirvana]], the extinction of the passions whereby suffering is ended and no more rebirths take place.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=49}} The insight arises that this liberation is certain:
{{quote|Knowledge arose in me, and insight: my freedom is certain, this is my last birth, now there is no rebirth.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=49}}}}

====Critical assessment====
Schmithausen{{refn|group=note|In his often-cited article ''On some Aspects of Descriptions or Theories of 'Liberating Insight' and 'Enlightenment' in Early Buddhism''}} notes that the mention of the four noble truths as constituting "liberating insight", which is attained after mastering the Rupa Jhanas, is a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya 36.{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} Bronkhorst notices that 
{{quote|...the accounts which include the Four Noble Truths had a completely different conception of the process of liberation than the one which includes the Four Dhyanas and the destruction of the intoxicants.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}}}}

It calls in question the reliability of these accounts, and the relation between ''dhyana'' and insight, which is a core problem in the study of early Buddhism.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}} Originally the term ''prajna'' may have been used, which came to be replaced by the four truths in those texts where "liberating insight" was preceded by the four jhanas.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=108}} Bronkhorst also notices that the conception of what exactly this "liberating insight" was developed throughout time. Whereas originally it may not have been specified, later on the four truths served as such, to be superseded by ''pratityasamutpada'', and still later, in the Hinayana schools, by the doctrine of the non-existence of a substantial self or person.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=100-101}} And Schmithausen notices that still other descriptions of this "liberating insight" exist in the Buddhist canon: 
{{quote|"that the five Skandhas are impermanent, disagreeable, and neither the Self nor belonging to oneself";{{refn|group=note|Majjhima Nikaya 26}} "the contemplation of the arising and disappearance (''udayabbaya'') of the five Skandhas";{{refn|group=note|Anguttara Nikaya II.45 (PTS)}} "the realisation of the Skandhas as empty (''rittaka''), vain (''tucchaka'') and without any pith or substance (''asaraka'').{{refn|group=note|Samyutta Nikaya III.140-142 (PTS)}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=101}}}}

An example of this substitution, and its consequences, is Majjhima Nikaya 36:42-43, which gives an account of the awakening of the Buddha.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=102-103}}

==Understanding of ''bodhi'' and Buddhahood in Buddhism==
The term bodhi acquired a variety of meanings and connotations during the development of Buddhist thoughts in the various schools.

===Early Buddhism===
{{Main|Early Buddhism}}

In early Buddhism, ''bodhi'' carried a meaning synonymous to ''[[nirvana]]'', using only some different metaphors to describe the insight, which implied the extinction of ''[[lobha]]'' (greed), ''[[Dvesha (Buddhism)|dosa]]'' (hate) and ''[[Moha (Buddhism)|moha]]'' (delusion). 

===Theravada===
{{See also|Dhyāna in Buddhism#Contemporary reassessment - the "Jhana wars"|l1=Non-reactive and lucid awareness}}

In [[Theravada Buddhism]], bodhi and nirvana carry the same meaning, that of being freed from greed, hate and delusion. In [[Theravada]] Buddhism, ''bodhi'' refers to the realisation of the [[four stages of enlightenment]] and becoming an  [[Arahant]].{{sfn|Schreiber-Fischer|2008|p=50}} In Theravada Buddhism, ''bodhi'' is equal to supreme insight, the realisation of the four noble truths, which leads to deliverance.{{sfn|Schreiber-Fischer|2008|p=50}} Reaching full awakening is equivalent in meaning to reaching [[Nirvāṇa]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma6/enlightnirvana.html Kusala Bhikshu (3/2008), ''Buddhist Enlightenment vs Nirvana'']{{As of|2010|09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attaining Nirvāṇa is the ultimate goal of Theravada and other śrāvaka traditions.&lt;ref group=web&gt;"[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-AN/26715.htm David Loy (2010), ''Enlightenment in Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta: Are Nirvana and Moksha the Same?'']{{As of|2010|09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the abandonment of the [[Fetter (Buddhism)|ten fetters]] and the cessation of dukkha or suffering. Full awakening is reached in four stages. According to Nyanatiloka,
{{quote|(Through Bodhi) one awakens from the slumber or stupor (inflicted upon the mind) by the defilements (''[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kilesa]]'', q.v.) and comprehends the [[Four Noble Truths]] (''[[sacca]]'', q.v.)''.{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=40}}}}

Since the 1980s, western Theravada-oriented teachers have started to question the primacy of insight. According to [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]], ''jhana'' and ''vipassana'' (insight) form an integrated practice.{{sfn|Quli|2008}} Polak and Arbel, following scholars like Vetter and Bronkhorst, argue that [[right effort]], c.q. the [[Four Right Exertions|four right efforts]] (sense restraint, preventing the arising of [[Five hindrances|unwholesome states]], and the generation of [[Seven factors of awakening|wholesome states]]), mindfulness, and ''[[Dhyana in Buddhism|dhyana]]'' form an integrated practice, in which ''dhyana'' is the actualisation of insight, leading to an awakened awareness which is "non-reactive and lucid."{{sfn|Polak|2011}}{{sfn|Arbel|2017}}

===Mahayana===
{{Main|Mahayana}}

In Mahayana-thought, bodhi is the realisation of the inseparability of [[samsara]] and [[nirvana]],{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|2008|p=51}} and the unity of subject and object.{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|2008|p=51}} It is similar to [[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]], to [[kensho|realizing the Buddha-nature]], realizing [[sunyata]] and realizing [[suchness]].{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|2008|p=51}} In time, the Buddha's awakening came to be understood as an immediate full awakening and liberation, instead of the insight into and certainty about the way to follow to reach enlightenment. However, in some Zen traditions this perfection came to be relativized again; according to one contemporary Zen master, "Shakyamuni buddha and Bodhidharma are still practicing."{{sfn|Harris|p=103|2004}}

Mahayana discerns three forms of awakened beings:{{sfn|Schreiber|2008|p=51}}
# [[Arahat]] – Liberation for oneself;{{refn|group=note|This also includes [[Pratyekabuddha]], but is not being mentioned by Fischer-Schreiber et al.}}
# [[Bodhisattva]] – Liberation for living beings;
# [[Buddhahood|Full Buddhahood]].

Within the various Mahayana-schools exist various further explanations and interpretations.{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|2008|p=51}} In [[Mahāyāna]] Buddhism the [[Bodhisattva]] is the ideal. The ultimate goal is not only of one's own liberation in Buddhahood, but the liberation of all living beings. But Mahayana Buddhism also developed a cosmology with a wide range of buddhas and bodhisattvas, who assist humans on their way to liberation.

[[Nichiren Buddhism]] regards Buddhahood as a state of perfect freedom, in which one is awakened to the eternal and ultimate truth that is the reality of all things. This supreme state of life is characterized by boundless wisdom and infinite compassion. The Lotus Sutra reveals that Buddhahood is a potential in the lives of all beings. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nichirenlibrary.org/en/dic/Content/G/66|title=Buddhahood – Dictionary of Buddhism – Nichiren Buddhism Library|website=www.nichirenlibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddha-nature====
In the [[Tathagatagarbha]] and [[Buddha-nature]] doctrines bodhi becomes equivalent to the universal, natural and pure state of the mind:
{{quote|''Bodhi'' is the final goal of a Bodhisattva's career [...] ''Bodhi'' is pure universal and immediate knowledge, which extends over all time, all universes, all beings and elements, conditioned and unconditioned. It is absolute and identical with Reality and thus it is [[Tathata]]. ''Bodhi'' is immaculate and non-conceptual, and it, being not an outer object, cannot be understood by discursive thought. It has neither beginning, nor middle nor end and it is indivisible. It is non-dual (''advayam'') [...] The only possible way to comprehend it is through [[samadhi]] by the yogin.{{sfn|Sebastian|2005|p=274}}}}

According to these doctrines bodhi is always there within one's mind, but requires the defilements to be removed. This vision is expounded in texts such as the [[Shurangama Sutra]] and the [[Uttaratantra]].

In [[Shingon]] Buddhism, the state of Bodhi is also seen as naturally inherent in the mind. It is the mind's natural and pure state, where no distinction is being made between a perceiving subject and perceived objects. This is also the understanding of Bodhi found in [[Yogacara]] Buddhism.

To achieve this vision of non-duality, it is necessary to recognise one's own mind:
{{quote|... it means that you are to know the inherent natural state of the mind by eliminating the split into a perceiving subject and perceived objects which normally occurs in the world and is wrongly thought to be real. This also corresponds to the Yogacara definition&amp;nbsp;... that emptiness (''sunyata'') is the absence of this imaginary split{{sfn|Hodge|2003|p=31-32}}}}

====Harmonisation of the various terms and meanings====
During the development of Mahayana Buddhism the various strands of thought on Bodhi were continuously being elaborated. Attempts were made to harmonize the various terms. The Buddhist commentator [[Buddhaguhya]] treats various terms as synonyms:
{{quote|For example, he defines emptiness (''sunyata'') as suchness (''tathata'') and says that suchness is the intrinsic nature (''svabhava'') of the mind which is Enlightenment (''[[Bodhicitta|bodhi-citta]]''). Moreover, he frequently uses the terms suchness (''tathata'') and Suchness-Awareness (''tathata-jnana'') interchangeably. But since Awareness (''jnana'') is non-dual, Suchness-Awareness is not so much the Awareness of Suchness, but the Awareness which ''is'' Suchness. In other words, the term Suchness-Awareness is functionally equivalent to Enlightenment. Finally, it must not be forgotten that this Suchness-Awareness or Perfect Enlightenment ''is'' Mahavairocana [the Primal Buddha, uncreated and forever existent]. In other words, the mind in its intrinsic nature is Mahavairocana, whom one "becomes" (or vice versa) when one is perfectly enlightened.{{sfn|Hodge|2003|p=31-32}}}}

==Western understanding of enlightenment==
{{See also|Buddhist modernism|Transcendentalism|Perennial philosophy}}

In the western world the concept of ''enlightenment'' has taken on a romantic meaning.{{sfn|Carrette|King|2005}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} It has become synonymous with [[self-realization]] and the [[True self and false self|true self]], being regarded as a substantial essence being covered over by social conditioning.{{sfn|Carrette|King|2005}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}

===Enlightenment as "Aufklärung"===
The use of the western word ''enlightenment'' is based on the supposed resemblance of ''bodhi'' with ''[[Age of Enlightenment|Aufklärung]]'', the independent use of reason to gain insight into the true nature of our world. In fact there are more resemblances with [[Romanticism]] than with the Enlightenment: the emphasis on feeling, on intuitive insight, on a true essence beyond the world of appearances.{{sfn|Wright|2000|p=181-183}}

===Awakening===
The equivalent term "awakening" has also been used in a Christian context, namely the [[Great Awakening]]s, several periods of [[Christian revival|religious revival]] in [[Religion in the United States|American religious history]]. Historians and theologians identify three or four waves of increased religious enthusiasm occurring between the early 18th century and the late 19th century. Each of these "Great Awakenings" was characterized by widespread revivals led by evangelical Protestant ministers, a sharp increase of interest in religion, a profound sense of conviction and redemption on the part of those affected, an increase in evangelical church membership, and the formation of new religious movements and denominations.

===Romanticism and transcendentalism===
The romantic idea of enlightenment as insight into a timeless, transcendent reality has been popularized especially by [[D.T. Suzuki]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/CriticalZen/whose%20zen_sharf.pdf Robert H. Sharf, ''Whose Zen? Zen Nationalism Revisited'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/Chan_in_China.html Hu Shih: Ch'an (Zen) Buddhism in China. Its History and Method]&lt;/ref&gt; Further popularization was due to the writings of [[Heinrich Dumoulin]].{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a}}{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/McRaeIntroduction.pdf Critical introduction by John McRae to the reprint of Dumoulin's ''A history of Zen'']&lt;/ref&gt; Dumoulin viewed metaphysics as the expression of a transcendent truth, which according to him was expressed by Mahayana Buddhism, but not by the pragmatic analysis of the oldest Buddhism, which emphasizes anatta.{{sfn|Dumonlin|2000}} This romantic vision is also recognizable in the works of [[Ken Wilber]].{{sfn|Wilber|1996}}

In the oldest Buddhism this essentialism is not recognizable.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=116-124}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/publications/nlarc/Pruning_the_bodhi_tree.htm Nanzan Institute: Pruning the bodhi Tree]&lt;/ref&gt; According to critics it doesn't really contribute to a real insight into Buddhism:&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://meaningness.wordpress.com/2011/08/12/effing-the-ineffable/ David Chapman: Effing the ineffable]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;...most of them labour under the old cliché that the goal of Buddhist psychological analysis is to reveal the hidden mysteries in the human mind and thereby facilitate the development of a transcendental state of consciousness beyond the reach of linguistic expression.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992a|p=xi}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Enlightenment and experience===
A common reference in western culture is the notion of "enlightenment ''experience''". This notion can be traced back to [[William James]], who used the term "religious experience" in his book, ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]''.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}} [[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of "religious experience" further back to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768-1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. Schleiermacher used the notion of "religious experience" to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique.

It was popularised by the [[Transcendentalists]], and exported to Asia via missionaries.{{sfn|King|2002}} Transcendentalism developed as a reaction against 18th Century rationalism, [[John Locke]]'s philosophy of [[Sensualism]], and the predestinationism of New England [[Calvinism]]. It is fundamentally a variety of diverse sources such as Hindu texts like the [[Vedas]], the [[Upanishads]] and the [[Bhagavad Gita]],{{sfn|Versluis|2001|p=3}} various religions, and [[German idealism]].{{sfn|Hart|1995}}

It was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p=271}}{{refn|group=note|James also gives descriptions of conversion experiences. The Christian model of dramatic conversions, based on the role-model of Paul's conversion, may also have served as a model for western interpretations and expectations regarding "enlightenment", similar to Protestant influences on Theravada Buddhism, as described by Carrithers: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It rests upon the notion of the primacy of religious experiences, preferably spectacular ones, as the origin and legitimation of religious action. But this presupposition has a natural home, not in Buddhism, but in Christian and especially Protetstant Christian movements which prescribe a radical conversion.{{sfn|Carrithers|1983|p=18}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
See Sekida for an example of this influence of William James and Christian conversion stories, mentioning Luther{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=196-197}} and St. Paul.{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=251}} See also McMahan for the influence of Christian thought on Buddhism.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}}}

The notion of "experience" has been criticised.{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}}{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282-286}}{{sfn|Low|2006|p=12}} Robert Sharf points out that "experience" is a typical western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences.{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}}{{refn|group=note|Robert Sharf: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he role of experience in the history of Buddhism has been greatly exaggerated in contemporary scholarship. Both historical and ethnographic evidence suggests that the privileging of experience may well be traced to certain twentieth-century reform movements, notably those that urge a return to ''[[zazen]]'' or ''[[vipassana]]'' meditation, and these reforms were profoundly influenced by religious developments in the west [...] While some adepts may indeed experience "altered states" in the course of their training, critical analysis shows that such states do not constitute the reference point for the elaborate Buddhist discourse pertaining to the "path".{{sfn|Sharf|1995-C|p=1}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The notion of "experience" introduces a false notion of duality between "experiencer" and "experienced", whereas the essence of kensho is the realisation of the "[[non-duality]]" of observer and observed.{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=30}}{{dead link|date=May 2014}} {{sfn|Samy|1998|p=82}} "Pure experience" does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282}}{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80-82}} The specific teachings and practices of a specific tradition may even determine what "experience" someone has, which means that this "experience" is not the ''proof'' of the teaching, but a ''result'' of the teaching.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80}} A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by "cleaning the doors of perception" as per romantic poet [[William Blake]]{{refn|group=note|[[William Blake]]: "If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thru' narrow chinks of his cavern."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quotedb.com/quotes/2653 Quote DB]&lt;/ref&gt;}}, would, according to Mohr, be an overwhelming chaos of sensory input without coherence.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=284}}

==Bodhi Day==
Sakyamuni's Buddhahood is celebrated on [[Bodhi Day]]. In Sri Lanka and Japan different days are used for this celebration.

According to the Theravada tradition in Sri Lanka, Sakyamuni reached Buddhahood at the [[full moon]] in May. This is celebrated at [[Poya|Wesak Poya]], the full moon in May, as [[Sambuddhatva jayanthi]] (also known as Sambuddha jayanthi).&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://dedunu.wordpress.com/2008/06/12/vesak-full-moon-poya-day/ Vesak full moon poya day]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Zen tradition, the Buddha reached his decisive insight on 8 December. This is celebrated in Zen monasteries with a very intensive eight-day session of [[Bodhi Day#Rohatsu|''Rōhatsu'']].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8656">In [[philosophy]], the phrase '''further facts'''  refers to facts that do not [[logical consequence|follow logically]] from the physical facts of the world.&lt;ref name="Parfit"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parfit|first=Derek|title=Reasons and Persons|pages=309-310|year=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198249085|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/reasons-and-persons-9780198249085}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chalmers"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chalmers|first=David|title=The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory|pages=84-87|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195117899|url=https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/the-conscious-mind-9780195117899}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reductionism|Reductionists]] who argue that at bottom there is nothing more than the physical facts thus argue against the existence of further facts. The concept of further facts plays a key role in some of the major works in [[analytic philosophy]] of the late 20th century, including in [[Derek Parfit]]'s ''[[Reasons and Persons]]'', and [[David Chalmers]]'s ''[[The Conscious Mind]]''.

One context in which the existence of further facts is debated is that of [[personal identity]] across time: in what sense is Alice today really the ''same'' person as Alice yesterday, given that across the two days the state of her brain is different and the atoms that constitute her are different?  One may believe that at bottom, there is nothing more than the atoms and their arrangement at different points in time; while we may for practical purposes come up with some notion of sameness of a person, this notion does not reflect anything deeper about [[reality]].  Under this view there would be no further facts.  Alternatively, one may believe that there is a deeper sense in which Alice yesterday and Alice today really are the same person.  For example, if one believes in [[mind-body dualism|Cartesian souls]], one may believe that Alice yesterday and Alice today are the same person if and only if they correspond to the same soul.  Or one may not believe in Cartesian souls, but yet believe that whether Alice yesterday and Alice today are the same person is a question about something other than facts about which atoms constitute them and how they are arranged. These would both be further-fact views.

[[File:Derek_Parfit_at_Harvard-April_21,_2015-Effective_Altruism_(cropped).jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Derek Parfit]]]]
The debate about further facts about personal identity over time is most closely associated with Derek Parfit.  In his ''Reasons and Persons'', he describes the non-reductionist's view that "personal identity is a deep further fact, distinct from physical and psychological continuity".&lt;ref name="Parfit" /&gt;  Parfit takes a reductionist stance and argues against this further-fact view.  As a result it is not clear whether a person has any reason to be worried about her future [[self]] in a special way that does not also apply to worrying about others, with Parfit arguing that it is plausible that "only the deep further fact gives me a reason to be specially concerned about my future" (his so-called "Extreme Claim").&lt;ref name="Parfit" /&gt; [[Sydney Shoemaker]] objects that it is not clear how a further fact would give a reason for such special concerns, either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shoemaker|first=Sydney|title=Critical notice of ''Reasons and Persons''|journal=Mind|date=1985|volume=94|pages=443–453}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harold Langsam has attempted to give a positive account of how a further fact would give such a reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langsam|first=Harold|title=Pain, Personal Identity, and the Deep Further Fact|journal=Erkenntnis|date=2001|volume=54|issue=2|pages=247–271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:David_Chalmers_TASC2008.JPG|left|100px|thumb|[[David Chalmers]]]]
David Chalmers lists a number of other types of candidates for further facts.&lt;ref name="Chalmers" /&gt;  One is facts about [[consciousness|conscious experience]].  For example, it is difficult to see how it follows from the physical facts [[qualia|what it is like]] to experience seeing red; indeed, [[inverted spectrum]] scenarios, where we imagine that experiences of colors are swapped without anything else changing, might suggest that things could have been different without the physical facts changing.  Another candidate for a further fact is the fact that there is any conscious experience at all, rather than everyone being a [[philosophical zombie]]. Christopher Hill and Brian Mclaughlin have argued against the idea that facts about consciousness are further facts, disputing the [[logical possibility]] of a world physically identical to ours in which the facts about consciousness are different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=Christopher|last2=Mclaughlin|first2=Brian|title=Review: There are Fewer Things in Reality Than are Dreamt of in Chalmers's Philosophy|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|date=1999|volume=59|issue=2|pages=445–454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chalmers also considers facts about [[indexicality]].  He cites the fact that "''I'' am David Chalmers", noting that its significance seems to go beyond the [[Tautology_(logic)|tautology]] that David Chalmers is David Chalmers. (See also Caspar Hare's [[egocentric presentism]] and Benj Hellie's [[vertiginous question]].&lt;ref name="JPhil"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hare|first=Caspar|title=Self-Bias, Time-Bias, and the Metaphysics of Self and Time|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=July 2007|volume=104|issue=7|pages=350–373|url=http://web.mit.edu/~casparh/www/Papers/CJHareSelfBias2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hare|first=Caspar|title=On Myself, and Other, Less Important Subjects|year=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691135311|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8921.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hellie|first=Benj|title=Against egalitarianism|journal=Analysis|year=2013|volume=73|issue=2|pages=304–320|doi=10.1093/analys/ans101}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Similarly, in the [[philosophy of space and time|philosophy of time]], what date and time it is ''now'' might be considered a candidate for a further fact, in the sense that a being that knows everything about the full four-dimensional block of [[spacetime]] would still not know what time it is ''now''. (See also [[B-theory of time|the A-theory and the B-theory of time]].)

A final type of fact that Chalmers considers is that of ''negative'' facts.  For example, consider the following statement: there do not exist nonphysical [[angel|angels]].  If in fact true, it does not seem that this logically follows from any of the physical facts by themselves; but, he argues, it would follow if one added a "That is all" statement at the end of the list of all the physical facts.

Vincent Conitzer has used the following [[simulation hypothesis|computer simulation scenarios]] to illuminate further facts about [[qualia]] (what it is ''like'' to have specific experiences), indexicality, and personal identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conitzer|first=Vincent|title=A Puzzle about Further Facts|journal=Erkenntnis|arxiv=1802.01161|doi=10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imagine a person in the real world who is observing a simulated world on a screen, from the perspective of one of the simulated agents in it.  The person observing knows that besides the [[computer code|code]] responsible for the [[physics]] of the simulation, there must be ''additional'' code that determines in which colors the simulation is displayed on the screen, and which agent's perspective is displayed. That is, the person can conclude that the facts about the physics of the simulation (which are completely captured by the code governing the physics) do not fully determine her experience by themselves.  But then, Conitzer argues, imagine someone who has become so engrossed in the simulation that she has ''forgotten'' that it is a simulation that she is watching.  Could she not still reach the same conclusion?  And if so, can we not conclude the same in our own daily lives?

A '''General Confession''', as understood by [[St. Ignatius of Loyola]] is a form of [[Confession (religion)|Confession]] whereby one spends 3 to 10 days preparing for a confession of all one's 'sins up to that time.'&lt;ref&gt;O'Malley, J W 1993, 'The First Jesuits', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The main goal of the "general confession" is to turn one's life from one of sin to a more devout one.&lt;ref&gt;O'Malley, J W 1993, 'The First Jesuits', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass. p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius]]'' have done much to popularise this form of confession, with such a confession being the significant end-point of the First Week of his Spiritual Exercises.

In [[Anglicanism]], the expression "General Confession" is also used for the [[Act of Contrition#Anglican General Confession|act of contrition]] in [[Thomas Cranmer]]'s 1548 order of Communion and later in the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wohlers|first=Charles|title=The Order of the Communion, 1548|url=http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/Communion_1548.htm|work=The Book of Common Prayer|publisher=[[Society of Archbishop Justus]]|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2702">'''Genetic divergence''' is the process in which two or more populations of an ancestral species accumulate independent genetic changes ([[mutations]]) through time, often after the populations have become [[Reproductive isolation|reproductively isolated]] for some period of time. In some cases, subpopulations living in ecologically distinct peripheral environments can exhibit genetic divergence from the remainder of a population, especially where the range of a population is very large (see [[parapatric speciation]]). The genetic differences among divergent populations can involve [[silent mutations]] (that have no effect on the [[phenotype]]) or give rise to significant [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] and/or [[physiology|physiological]] changes. Genetic divergence will always accompany reproductive isolation, either due to novel adaptations via selection and/or due to genetic drift, and is the principal mechanism underlying [[speciation]].&lt;ref name=&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boundless.com/biology/textbooks/boundless-biology-textbook/evolution-and-the-origin-of-species-18/evolution-of-genomes-127/gene-duplications-and-divergence-511-13091/

On a molecular genetics level, genetic divergence is due to changes in a small number of [[gene]]s in a species, resulting in [[speciation]].&lt;ref name=Divergence&gt;{{cite journal|last=Palumbi|first=Stephen R.|authorlink=Stephen Palumbi|title=Genetic Divergence, Reproductive Isolation, and Marine Speciation|journal=[[Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics]]|date=1994|volume=25|pages=547–572|jstor=2097324|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.25.1.547}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, researchers argue that it is unlikely that divergence is a result of a significant, single, dominant mutation in a genetic [[locus (genetics)|locus]] because if that were so, the individual with that mutation would have zero [[fitness (biology)|fitness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayr|first1=Ernst|title=Systematics and the Origin of Species|date=1942|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, they could not reproduce and pass the mutation on to further generations. Hence, it is more likely that divergence, and subsequently [[reproductive isolation]], are the outcomes of multiple small mutations over evolutionary time.&lt;ref name=Divergence /&gt;

'''Gim Jip''' (1574–1656)&lt;ref&gt;Joseon Annals, May 13, 1656. No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Korea]]n [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] [[Neo-Confucian]] scholar, politician, educator and writer.  He was from the [[Gwangsan Kim clan]].  He was the son of Sagye [[Kim Jang-saeng]] and the grand uncle of [[Kim Man-jung]].  His mother was from the [[Chang-nyeong Jo clan]] (창녕조씨, 昌寧曺氏), the daughter of Jo Dae-geon (조대건, 曺大乾) He was also the teacher of [[Song Si-yeol]] and [[Song Jun-gil]], great Korean [[Neo-Confucian]] scholars.  He was granted the honor of [[Munmyo]] Bae-hyang (문묘배향) sage-scholar&lt;ref&gt;Joseon Annals, November 20, 1883.  No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and was put in the Confucian shrine.  Thus, making him one of the 18 sages of Korea.  He also married the daughter of famous scholar [[Yi I]] from the [[Deoksu Yi clan]] (덕수이씨, 德水李氏).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24805">'''Giorgi Japaridze''' (also spelled Giorgie Dzhaparidze) is a Georgian-American researcher in logic and theoretical computer science. He currently holds the title of Full Professor&lt;ref&gt;http://csc.villanova.edu/faculty/fullTime&lt;/ref&gt; at the Computing Sciences Department of [[Villanova University]]. Japaridze is best known for his invention of [[computability logic]], [[cirquent calculus]], and [[Japaridze's polymodal logic]].

== Research ==
During 1985-1988&lt;ref&gt;G. Japaridze, "[http://www.csc.villanova.edu/~japaridz/1988PolymodalProvLog.pdf The polymodal logic of provability]". Intensional Logics and Logical Structure of Theories. Metsniereba, Tbilisi, 1988, pages 16-48 (Russian).&lt;/ref&gt; Japaridze elaborated the system GLP, known as [[Japaridze's polymodal logic]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Boolos, "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016800729390200W The analytical completeness of Japaridze's polymodal logics]". Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 61 (1993), pages 95-111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.D. Beklemishev, J.J. Joosten and M. Vervoort, "[http://logcom.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/4/447.abstract A finitary treatment of the closed fragment of Japaridze's provability logic]". Journal of Logic and Computation 15(4) (2005), pages 447-463.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. Shapirovsky, "[http://www.aiml.net/volumes/volume7/Shapirovsky.pdf PSPACE-decidability of Japaridze's polymodal logic]". Advances in Modal Logic 7 (2008), pages 289-304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Pakhomov, "[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00153-014-0397-4 On the complexity of the closed fragment of Japaridze's provability logic]". Archive for Mathematical Logic 53 (2014), pages 949-967.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a system of [[modal logic]] with the "necessity" operators [0],[1],[2],…, understood as a natural series of incrementally weak provability predicates for [[Peano arithmetic]]. In "The polymodal logic of provability"&lt;ref&gt;G. Japaridze, "[http://www.csc.villanova.edu/~japaridz/1988PolymodalProvLog.pdf The polymodal logic of provability]". Intensional Logics and Logical Structure of Theories. Metsniereba, Tbilisi, 1988, pages 16-48 (Russian).&lt;/ref&gt; Japaridze proved the arithmetical completeness of this system, as well as its inherent incompleteness with respect to Kripke frames. GLP has been extensively studied by various authors during the subsequent three decades, especially after [[Lev Beklemishev]], in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;L. Beklemishev, "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168007203001325 Provability algebras and proof-theoretic ordinals, I]". Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 128 (2004), pages 103-123.&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out its usefulness in understanding the proof theory of arithmetic (provability algebras and proof-theoretic ordinals).

Japaridze has also studied the first-order (predicate) versions of provability logic. He came up with an axiomatization of the single-variable fragment of that logic, and proved its arithmetical completeness and decidability.&lt;ref&gt;G. Japaridze, "[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00401550 Decidable and enumerable predicate logics of provability]". Studia Logica 49 (1990), pages 7-21.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same paper he showed that, on the condition of the 1-completeness of the underlying arithmetical theory, predicate provability logic with non-iterated modalities is recursively enumerable. In&lt;ref&gt;G. Japaridze, "[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00370393 Predicate provability logic with non-modalized quantifiers]". Studia Logica 50 (1991), pages 149-160.&lt;/ref&gt; he did the same for the predicate provability logic with non-modalized quantifiers.

In 1992-1993, Japaridze came up with the concepts of [[cointerpretability]], [[tolerant sequence|tolerance]] and [[cotolerance]], naturally arising in interpretability logic.&lt;ref&gt;G. Japaridze, "[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00370116 The logic of linear tolerance]". Studia Logica 51 (1992), pages 249-277.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Japaridze, "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016800729390201N A generalized notion of weak interpretability and the corresponding modal logic]". Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 61 (1993), pages 113-160.&lt;/ref&gt; He proved that cointerpretability is equivalent to 1-conservativity and tolerance is equivalent to 1-consistency. The former was an answer to the long-standing open problem regarding the metamathematical meaning of 1-conservativity. Within the same line of research, Japaridze constructed the modal logics of tolerance&lt;ref&gt;G. Japaridze, "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016800729390201N A generalized notion of weak interpretability and the corresponding modal logic]". Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 61 (1993), pages 113-160.&lt;/ref&gt; (1993) and the [[arithmetical hierarchy]]&lt;ref&gt;G. Japaridze, "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168007294900639 The logic of arithmetical hierarchy]". Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 66 (1994), pages 89-112.&lt;/ref&gt; (1994), and proved their arithmetical completeness.
In 2002 Japaridze introduced "the Logic of Tasks",&lt;ref&gt;G. Japaridze, "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168007201001233 The logic of tasks]". Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 117 (2002), pages 261-293.&lt;/ref&gt; which later became a part of his Abstract Resource Semantics&lt;ref&gt;G. Japaridze, "[http://logcom.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/4/489.abstract Introduction to cirquent calculus and abstract resource semantics]". Journal of Logic and Computation 16 (2006), pages 489-532.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. Mezhirov and N. Vereshchagin, "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002200000900097X On abstract resource semantics and computability logic]". Journal of Computer and Systems Sciences 76 (2010), pages 356-372.&lt;/ref&gt; on one hand, and a fragment of Computability Logic (see below) on the other hand.

Japaridze is best known{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} for founding [[Computability logic|Computability Logic]] in 2003 and making subsequent contributions to its evolution. This is a long-term research program and a semantical platform for "redeveloping logic as a formal theory of (interactive) computability, as opposed to the formal theory of truth that it has more traditionally been".&lt;ref&gt;G. Japaridze, "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890540111001076 Introduction to clarithmetic I]". Information and Computation 209 (2011), pages 1312-1354.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2006&lt;ref&gt;G. Japaridze, "[http://logcom.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/4/489.abstract Introduction to cirquent calculus and abstract resource semantics]". Journal of Logic and Computation 16 (2006), pages 489-532.&lt;/ref&gt; Japaridze conceived [[cirquent calculus]] as a proof-theoretic approach that manipulates graph-style constructs, termed cirquents, instead of the more traditional and less general tree-like constructs such as formulas or sequents. This novel proof-theoretic approach was later successfully used to "tame" various fragments of computability logic,&lt;ref&gt;G. Japaridze, "[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00153-012-0313-8 The taming of recurrences in computability logic through cirquent calculus, Part I]". Archive for Mathematical Logic 52 (2013), pages 173-212.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Japaridze, "[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00153-012-0314-7 The taming of recurrences in computability logic through cirquent calculus, Part II]". Archive for Mathematical Logic 52 (2013), pages 213-259.&lt;/ref&gt; which had otherwise stubbornly resisted all axiomatization attempts within the traditional proof theory such as sequent calculus or Hilbert-style systems. It was also used to (define and) axiomatize the purely propositional fragment of [[Independence-friendly logic|Independent-Friendly Logic]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Japaridze, "[http://www.lmcs-online.org/ojs/viewarticle.php?id=717&amp;layout=abstract From formulas to cirquents in computability logic]". Logical Methods is Computer Science 7 (2011), Issue 2, Paper 1, pages 1-55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Japaridze, "On the system CL12 of computability logic". Logical Methods in Computer Science (in press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Xu, "[http://jigpal.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/6/982 A propositional system induced by Japaridze's approach to IF logic]". Logic Journal of the IGPL 22 (2014), pages 982-991.&lt;/ref&gt;
The birth of cirquent calculus was accompanied with offering the associated "abstract resource semantics". Cirquent calculus with that semantics can be seen as a logic of resources which, unlike Linear Logic, makes it possible to account for resource-sharing. As such, it has been presented as a viable alternative to [[linear logic]] by Japaridze, who repeatedly has criticized the latter for being neither sufficiently expressive nor complete as a resource logic. This challenge, however, has remained largely unnoticed by the linear logic community, which never responded to it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Japaridze has cast a similar (and also never answered) challenge to [[intuitionistic logic]],&lt;ref&gt;G. Japaridze, "[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4020-9374-6_11 In the beginning was game semantics]". Games: Unifying Logic, Language and Philosophy. O. Majer, A.-V. Pietarinen and T. Tulenheimo, eds. Springer 2009, pages 249-350.&lt;/ref&gt; criticizing it for lacking a convincing semantical justification the associated constructivistic claims, and for being incomplete as a result of "throwing out the baby with the bath water". [[Arend Heyting|Heyting]]'s intuitionistic logic, in its full generality, has been shown to be sound&lt;ref&gt;G. Japaridze, "[http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/actacybernetica/edb/vol18n1/Japaridze_2007_ActaCybernetica.xml Intuitionistic computability logic]". Acta Cybernetica 18 (2007), pages 77-113.&lt;/ref&gt; but incomplete&lt;ref&gt;I. Mezhirov and N. Vereshchagin, "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002200000900097X On abstract resource semantics and computability logic]". Journal of Computer and Systems Sciences 76 (2010), pages 356-372.&lt;/ref&gt; with respect to the semantics of computability logic. The positive (negation-free) propositional fragment of intuitionistic logic, however, has been proven to be complete with respect to the computability-logic semantics.&lt;ref&gt;G. Japaridze, "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168007207000346 The intuitionistic fragment of computability logic at the propositional level]". Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 147 (2007), pages 187-227.&lt;/ref&gt;
In "On the system CL12 of computability logic",&lt;ref&gt;G. Japaridze, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0103 On the system CL12 of computability logic]". Logical Methods is Computer Science (in press).&lt;/ref&gt; on the platform of computability logic, Japaridze generalized the traditional concepts of time and space complexities to interactive computations, and introduced a third sort of a complexity measure for such computations, termed "amplitude complexity".
Among Japaridze's contributions is the elaboration of a series of systems of (Peano) [[Peano arithmetic|arithmetic]] based on computability logic, named "[[clarithmetic]]s".&lt;ref&gt;G. Japaridze, "[http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?verb=Display&amp;version=1.0&amp;service=UI&amp;handle=euclid.jsl/1268917495&amp;page=record Towards applied theories based on computability logic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629001449/http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?verb=Display&amp;version=1.0&amp;service=UI&amp;handle=euclid.jsl%2F1268917495&amp;page=record |date=2015-06-29 }}".

Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 165 (2014), pages 241-252.&lt;/ref&gt; These include complexity-oriented systems (in the style of bounded arithmetic) for various combinations of time, space and amplitude complexity classes.

==Biography and academic career==
Giorgi Japaridze was born in 1961 in [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (then in the [[Soviet Union]]).
He graduated from [[Tbilisi State University]] in 1983, received a PhD degree (in philosophy) from [[Moscow State University]] in 1987, and then a second PhD degree (in computer science) from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1998. During 1987-1992 Japaridze worked as a Senior Researcher at the Institute of Philosophy of the Georgian Academy of Sciences. During 1992-1993 he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [[University of Amsterdam]] (Mathematics and Computer Science department).

In [[philosophy]], a '''grouped event'''&lt;ref name="events"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/events/ Events, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; is the experience of two or more events that occur in sequence or concurrently that can be subsequently categorized.

== Description ==
Grouped events can fall into categories depending upon whether the events are causal or acausal (noncausal), and are with or without meaning (significance). Causal&lt;ref name="dict1"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/causality definition of causality at Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; events are related as the subsequent event(s) are understood to be a consequence of the prior event(s).
Meaning&lt;ref name="dict2"&gt;
[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/meaning definition of meaning at Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; represents the purpose or significance of something.

Four categories are [[causality]], [[coincidence]], [[serendipity]], and [[synchronicity]].

'''Causality'''&lt;ref name="cause"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-process/ Causation, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; represents causal events grouped without meaning. These are common events.

'''Coincidence'''&lt;ref name="coinc"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/temporal-parts/ Coincidence, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; represents acausal events grouped without meaning. These are less common events.

'''Serendipity'''&lt;ref name="seren"&gt;[http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/content/45/2/631 Serendipity: Anatomy of the Unsought Finding, Oxford Journals]&lt;/ref&gt; represents causal events grouped by meaning. These are rare events.

'''Synchronicity'''&lt;ref name="synch"&gt;[http://www.carl-jung.net/synchronicity.html What is Sychronicity?, Carl Jung Resources]&lt;/ref&gt; represents acausal events grouped by meaning. These events are unlikely to occur by chance and may represent an outlier effect.

== Examples ==
A '''causality''' example is to strike a cue ball with a pool stick to make it move. The result is expected and has no meaning.

A '''coincidence''' example is two friends from the same town finding each other at the same time in the town's library without any planning. The result is unexpected, yet has no meaning (significance).

A '''serendipity''' example is finding something useful while looking for something else, such as finding the cue ball while looking for the pool stick. The find was caused by the search, and because the find was useful, the event has meaning.

A '''sychronicity''' example is two friends who rarely visit libraries, without any planning, finding each other in a library on one day; and again without any planning, finding each other in a distant library on a later date. Not only is the result unexpected, the friends find the event to have meaning (significance), because of the remote chance of the event.

== Criticisms and interpretations ==
Determinism theory&lt;ref name="deter"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/ Causal Determinism, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; argues against acausal events. However, the idea of causal determinism can neither be argued for nor against based on the scientific knoweldge at this point in time {{dubious|date=May 2016}}.

Causality appears to us to be reasonably objective to determine on the macroscopic scale. (But not on the quantum scale, where random chance prevails.) However, even large-scale physical causality is a somewhat mysterious notion; there is no general theory of causality in physics, and most events in physics are theoretically reversible in time {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}. However, the Second Law of Thermodynamics (which states that entropy always increases with time, in any closed system) can be regarded as providing a direction for the "arrow of time" and thus entropy may be related to the physically mysterious notion of causality. (See [[Causality (physics)]].)

Unlike causality, the concept of meaning is purely subjective except in symbol systems such as language/grammar and mathematics - both systems which depend on prior agreement on the arbitrary assignment of specific meanings to specific symbols or symbol groups {{dubious|date=May 2016}}.

The outlier effect can be used to explain events that are unlikely to occur by chance. Littlewood's Law&lt;ref name="littl"&gt;"Littlewoods's Miscellany", edited by B. Bollobás, Cambridge University Press; {{ISBN|0-521-33702-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that individuals can statistically expect a significant event to happen for them at a frequency of about once per month. Littlewood assumes a significant event frequency at one in a million with a duration of one second, and that an individual is alert to significant events for eight hours per day.

== In popular culture ==
The 1993 book, [[The Celestine Prophecy]], by James Redfield encouraged its readers to seek meaning from grouped events. From the book's First Insight: "In each of our lives occurs mysterious coincidences - sudden, synchronistic events that, once interpreted, lead us into our true destiny'.&lt;ref name="celes"&gt;"The Celestine Prophecy", by James Redfield; {{ISBN|0-446-51862-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was a 1996 best seller, spent 165 weeks on The New York Times Bestseller list, and has now sold over 20 million copies.

'''Heinz von Foerster''' ([[German language|German]] spelling: '''Heinz von Förster'''; November 13, 1911, [[Vienna]] – October 2, 2002, [[Pescadero, California]]) was an [[Austrian Americans|Austrian American]] scientist combining [[physics]] and [[philosophy]], and widely attributed as the originator of [[Second-order cybernetics]]. He was twice a [[Guggenheim fellow]] (1956–57 and 1963–64) and also was a fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], 1980. He is well known for his 1960 [[Doomsday equation]] formula published in ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'' predicting future population growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

As a [[polymath]], he wrote nearly two hundred professional papers, gaining renown in fields from [[computer science]] and [[artificial intelligence]] to [[epistemology]], and researched high-speed [[electronics]] and [[electro-optics]] switching devices as a physicist, and in [[biophysics]], the study of [[memory]] and knowledge. He worked on [[cognition]] based on [[neurophysiology]], [[mathematics]], and [[philosophy]] and was called "one of the most consequential thinkers in the history of [[cybernetics]]".&lt;ref name=FUP&gt;{{cite book

==Biography==
Von Foerster was born in 1911 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]], as Heinz von Förster. He was the grandson of Austrian architect [[:de:Emil von Förster|Emil Ritter von Foerster]]. He studied physics at the [[Technical University of Vienna]] and at the [[University of Breslau]], where in 1944 he received a [[Ph.D.]] in [[physics]]. His relatives included [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[:de:Erwin Lang (Maler)|Erwin Lang]] and [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]]. [[Ludwig Förster]] was his great-grandfather.&lt;ref name=markoff&gt;{{citation |last=Markoff |first=John |title=Heinz von Foerster, a Leading Information Theorist, Dies at 90 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 9, 2002 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/09/obituaries/09FOER.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Jewish]] roots didn't cause him much troubles while he worked in radar laboratories during the [[Nazi era]], as "he hid his ancestry with the help of an employer who chose not to press him for documents on his family."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Markoff]], "[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/09/us/heinz-von-foerster-90-dies-was-information-theorist.html Heinz von Foerster, 90, Dies; Was Information Theorist]", November 9 2002, ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to the USA in 1949, and worked at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], where he was a professor of electrical engineering from 1951–1975. He also was professor of [[biophysics]] (1962–1975) and Director of the [[Biological Computer Laboratory]] (1958–1975). Additionally, in 1956–57 and 1963–64 he was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] and also President of the [http://www.wennergren.org/ Wenner-Gren-Foundation] for anthropological research from 1963–1965.&lt;ref name="Constructivism"/&gt;

He knew well and was in conversation with [[John von Neumann]], [[Norbert Wiener]], [[Humberto Maturana]], [[Francisco Varela]], [[Gordon Pask]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Lawrence J. Fogel]] and [[Margaret Mead]], among many others. He influenced generations of students as a teacher and inclusive, enthusiastic collaborator.

==Work==
Von Foerster was influenced by the [[Vienna Circle]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. He worked in the field of [[cybernetics]] and is known as the inventor of [[second-order cybernetics]].&lt;ref name=FUP/&gt;  He made important contributions to [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]].&lt;ref&gt;Segal, L. ''The Dream of Reality: Heinz Von Foerster's Constructivism'', Springer, 2001. {{ISBN|0-387-95130-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known for his interest in computer music and [[Magic (illusion)|magic]].

===The electron tube laboratory===
In 1949 von Foerster started work at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] at the electron tube laboratory of the Electrical Engineering Department, where he succeeded [[Joseph Tykociński-Tykociner]]. With his students he developed many innovative devices, including ultra-high-frequency electronics&lt;ref&gt;See for example, in ''Review of Scientific Instruments'' '''25''': 640–653, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also worked on mathematical models of population dynamics and developed a general model now called the "[[von Foerster equation]]"

The mathematical formula can be derived from first principles and reads:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial n}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial n}{\partial a}  = - m(a)n, &lt;/math&gt;

where: ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''(''t'',''a''), ''t'' stands for time and ''a'' for age. ''m''(''a'') is the death in function of the population age; ''n''(''t'',''a'') is the population density in function of age.

When ''m''(''a'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, we have:&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;Murray, J.D. ''Mathematical Biology: An Introduction''. Third edition. Interdisciplinary Applied Mathematics. Mathematical Biology. Spring: 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial n}{\partial t} = - \frac{\partial n}{\partial a} &lt;/math&gt;

It relates that a population ages, and that fact is the only one that influences change in population density; the negative sign shows that time flows in just one direction, that there is no birth and the population is going to die out.&lt;ref&gt;"Some Remarks on Changing Populations" in ''The Kinetics of Cellular Proliferation'', F. Stohlman, Jr., ed., Grune &amp; Stratton, New York, pp. 382–407 (1959); E. Trucco, ''Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics'' '''27''': 285–304 and 449–471, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

It is therefore a [[transport equation]]; it can be solved using a characteristics method.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; Another way is by [[similarity solution]]; and a third is a numerical approach such as [[finite differences]].

To get the solution, the following boundary conditions should be added:

:&lt;math&gt; n(t,0)= \int_0^\infty b (a)n(t,a) \, dt ,&lt;/math&gt;

which states that the initial births should be conserved (see Sharpe–Lotka–McKendrick’s equation for otherwise), and that

:&lt;math&gt; n(0,a)= f(a), \, &lt;/math&gt;

which states that the initial population must be given; then it will evolve according to the partial differential equation.

===Biological Computer Laboratory===
In 1958 he formed the ''[[Biological Computer Laboratory|Biological Computer Lab]]'', studying similarities in cybernetic systems in [[biology]] and [[electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bcl.ece.uiuc.edu/ Biological Computer Laboratory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Macy conferences===
He was the youngest member of the core group of the [[Macy conferences]] on Cybernetics and editor of the five volumes of ''Cybernetics'' (1949–1953), a series of conference transcripts that represent important foundational conversations in the field. It was von Foerster who suggested that Wiener's coinage "[[Cybernetics]]" be applied to this conference series, which had previously been called "Circular Causal and Feedback Mechanisms in Biological and Social Systems".

===Doomsday equation===
A 1960 issue of ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'' magazine included an article by von Foerster and his colleagues P. M. Mora and L. W. Amiot proposing a formula representing a best fit to available historical data on world population; the authors then predicted future population growth on the basis of this formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
 | author = Heinz von Foerster, P. M. Mora and L. W. Amiot
 | title = Doomsday: Friday, 13 November, A.D. 2026. At this date human population will approach infinity if it grows as it has grown in the last two millenia
 | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]]
 |date=November 1960
 | volume = 132
 | issue = 3436
 | pages = 1291&amp;ndash;1295
 | pmid = 13782058
 | doi = 10.1126/science.132.3436.1291
 | bibcode = 1960Sci...132.1291V
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The formula gave 2.7 billion as the 1960 world population and predicted that population growth would become infinite by Friday, November 13, 2026 – von Foerster's 115th birthday anniversary – a prediction that earned it the name "the Doomsday Equation."

Based on population data obtained from various sources, von Foerster and his students concluded that world population growth over the centuries was faster than an exponential. In such a situation, doubling-time decreases over time. Von Foerster's tongue-in-cheek prediction of Doomsday on November 13, 2026, was based on an extrapolation into the future of doubling-time, with the finding that doubling-time would decrease to zero on that date.

Responders to his Doomsday prediction objected on the grounds of the finite human gestation time of 9 months, and the transparent fact that biological systems rarely persist in exponential growth for any substantial length of time. Those who knew von Foerster could see in his rejoinders an evident sense of humor.

====Doomsday equation: recent research====
The [[hyperbolic growth]] of the [[world population]] observed until the 1970s has recently been correlated to a non-linear second order [[positive feedback]] between demographic growth and technological development that can be spelled out as follows:&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g., [http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?cp=&amp;page=Book&amp;id=37484&amp;lang=en&amp;blang=en&amp;list=14 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics''] by [[Andrey Korotayev]] ''et al.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/35548090/Mathematical_Model_of_the_World_System_Growth Korotayev, A. V., &amp; Malkov, A. S. A Compact Mathematical Model of the World System Economic and Demographic Growth, 1 CE–1973 CE // INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL MODELS AND METHODS IN APPLIED SCIENCES Volume 10, 2016. P. 200-209].&lt;/ref&gt;
* technological growth implies an increase in [[carrying capacity]], an increase in the number of people who can survive on any given plot of land
* demographic growth (more people) implies more potential inventors and hence an acceleration of technological growth
* accelerating technological growth causes accelerating growth of carrying capacity, in a positive feedback loop
* faster population growth likewise feeds back by accelerating growth of the number of potential inventors, and then even faster technological growth
* hence, even faster growth of the Earth's carrying capacity for people, and so on

Helios is a web-based platform that is available to the general public. Users can vote in elections and users can create elections. Anyone can cast a ballot; however, for the final vote to be counted, the voter's identification must be verified. Helios uses [[Secret ballot|ballot secrecy]] and [[homomorphic encryption]] to protect the identity of the voter.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=dd5a3ec3-0047-4ebc-af72-645831520086%40sessionmgr4008&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=87598197&amp;db=a9h | title= Attacking and fixing Helios: An analysis of ballot secrecy | last1=Cortier | first1=Veronique | last2=Smyth | first2=Ben | language=en-US | archive-date= | dead-url= | access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creating an Election==
A user must have a Helios account in order to create an election. A Helios account requires a user to provide an email address, name, and a password. The registered user can then create an election by specifying a name and time period. The user who created the election is known as the administrator of the election.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Once an election is created, Helios provides a [[Public-key cryptography|public key]] to the administrator. The administrator prepares the ballot and creates a voter roll—these can be edited at any time before voting starts. The administrator freezes the election when the election is ready for voters to cast ballots. When the election is frozen, no changes can be made to the ballot, voter roll, or election time frame&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Voting Process==
A voter, from the voting roll created by the administrator, receives an email with the voter's username, a random password for that specific election, a URL to the voting booth, and an [[SHA-1 hash]] of the election parameters. The voter follows the link in the email and begins the voting process. Once the voter finishes and has reviewed the ballot, the voter seals the ballot which triggers Helios to encrypt it and display a [[ciphertext]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

At this point the voter can either audit or cast the ballot. Auditing the ballot allows the voter to verify that the ciphertext is correct. Once the audit is complete, the ballot must be sealed again. When the voter is ready to cast their ballot, they must verify their login information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/01/next-election-dont-recount-vote-encrypt/|title=For the Next Election, Don't Recount the Vote. Encrypt It|last=Greenberg|first=Andy|date=|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helios authenticates the voter's identity and the ballot is cast. All votes are posted to a public online bulletin board which displays either a voter name or a voter ID number with the encrypted vote. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After an election ends, the Helios system shuffles the ballots, encrypts all the votes, and makes the shuffle publicly accessible for interested parties to audit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wey9CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=helios+ben+adida&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjOjv7In9jaAhUp44MKHU5qC-UQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=helios%20ben%20adida&amp;f=false|title=Information Security and Cryptology - ICISC 2015: 18th International Conference, Seoul, South Korea, November 25-27, 2015, Revised Selected Papers|last=Kwon|first=Soonhak|last2=Yun|first2=Aaram|date=2016-03-09|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9783319308401|location=|pages=195, 199|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auditing allows anyone to verify that the shuffle is correct. Once a reasonable amount of time for auditing has passed, Helios decrypts the ballots and tallies the votes. Anyone can download the election data to verify that the shuffle, decryptions, and tally are correct.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Users==
The Helios platform is intended to be utilized in low-coercive, small scale environments such as university student governments.

The platform was utilized for student government elections at Princeton University and Universite Catholique de Louvain.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://static.usenix.org/events/evtwote11/tech/final_files/Karayumak7-8-11.pdf|title=Usability Analysis of Helios – An Open Source Verifiable Remote Electronic Voting System|last1=Karayumak|first1=Faith|last2=Olembo|first2=Maina M.|language=en-US|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-15|last3=Kauer|first3=Michaela|last4=Volkamer|first4=Melanie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Universite Catholique de Louvain used the Helios voting system in March 2009 to elect its university president.

To mitigate a security breach, Helios records all of the votes once they are submitted and leaves a trace of verified votes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The integrity of the ballots are ensured by trustees and the Helios server. Auditors can and are encouraged to verify votes. In the event of corrupted ballots (where a vote for one candidate is cast for another), Helios attempts to mitigate the risk by the Ballot Encryption Verification program. The Ballot Encryption Verification program allows voters (or anyone interested) to audit other votes before they cast their own.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5505">'''Higher self''' is a term associated with multiple belief systems, but its basic premise describes an eternal, omnipotent, conscious, and intelligent [[being]], who is one's [[real self]]. [[Blavatsky]] formally defined the higher self as "[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atma]] the inseparable ray of the Universe and one self. It is the God above, more than within, us". Each and every individual has a Higher self.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/key/key-9.htm The Key to Theosophy], H.P. Blavatsky, 1889, p175. {{ISBN|0-8356-0427-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
The Higher Self is generally regarded as a form of being only to be recognized in a union with a divine source. In recent years the New Age faith has encouraged the idea of the Higher Self in contemporary culture, though the notion of the Higher Self has been interpreted throughout numerous historical spiritual faiths. Some denominations believe that the higher self is a part of an individual's metaphysical identity, while others teach that the higher self is essentially our tie to the heavens. Similar to the notion of the soul, the higher self can be defined by many different sects, while also being a topic of interest in the scientific and philosophical fields.

== Religious views ==

'''Christianity:''' In the Christian interpretation, all beings contain a fragment of the [[Holy Spirit]], which ties them to their Higher Self. The concept of the Holy Spirit is widely taught by various Christian sects, but the idea of the individual higher consciousness is discussed less frequently. Christian theology adheres that the Higher Self is what connects one to God, and thus one must honor and keep one's Higher Self pure by following the ethical guidelines outlined in the scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;Holcombe, Alfred D., and Suzanne M. Holcombe. "Biblically-Derived Concept of Mankind's Higher-Self-Lower Self Nature." Journal of Religion &amp; Psychical Research 28.1 (2005): 20-25. EBSCOhost. Web. 10 Sept. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus said, "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak" (Matthew 26:41); a central tenet of Christianity is that the body is still under the bondage of sin and is therefore imperfect, unlike the Higher Self, which remains untainted.

'''Buddhism:''' In Buddhism, the [[Nirvana Sutra]] describes the notion of Higher self.

'''Islam:''' In Sufism and some esoteric Shia sects (Batiniyya), the [[Higher Self]] has an important role, which is connected with notion of al-Insān al-Kāmil, the six organs, Al-Nafsul Mud’ma’inah and Fana'.


'''Hinduism:''' In Hinduism, the higher self is one and the same with the  [[Jiva]] or individual self. With this perspective, the Hindu faith generally teaches that the higher self, or [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] is not an object possessed by an individual, rather the self is the subject which perceives. In his book, ''The Higher Self'', Deepak Chopra utilizes the views of the Hindi denomination to support his claims concerning the divine force that is acquired with the awareness of the self. Hinduism teaches that through the  examination of self-knowledge, or “atma jnana,” one can attain salvation by comprehending the true self.&lt;ref&gt;Chopra, D. (2001). The Higher Self. New York, NY: Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Age:''' Most New Age literature defines the Higher self as an extension of the self to a godlike state. This Higher Self is essentially an extension of the worldly self. With this perspective, New Age text teaches that in exercising your relationship with the higher self, you will gain the ability to manifest your desired future before you. In other words, the self creates its own reality when in union with the Higher Self.&lt;ref&gt;Hanegraaff, Woutner J. "New Age Spiritualities as Secular Religion: A Historian's Perspective." Social Compass 46.2 (1999): 145-60. Scp.sagepub. Web. 10 Sept. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Higher self meditation and channeling ==

In numerous reports concerning the Higher Self, the practice of meditation or channeling to contact the Higher Self is highly encouraged. Most of this ideology agrees with the concept that with mindful awareness of the higher self, peace, salvation, or enlightenment may be procured. This is due to the idea that the Higher Self contains an advanced amount of insight into man’s most taxing questions, such as the purpose of existence or death, etc.  
Evidence of this insight is found within the book, ''Open to Channel: How To Connect With Your Guide'', where dual authors [http://www.orindaben.com/pages/home/aboutsr/ Sanaya Roman] and [http://www.orindaben.com/pages/home/aboutdp/ Duane Packer] report a collective and educational account of the practice and benefits of existing in alignment with the Higher Self. This piece cites views from numerous practitioners of meditation and channeling who claim a consistent result of newly acquired peace and intuition. Essentially, the idea behind this practice is that through spiritual exposure, a person can make a conscious connection with their higher self or other higher beings. In this state, the meditator is free to tap into this higher intelligence in order to develop a more enlightened perspective on world matters.&lt;ref&gt;Roman, Sanaya, and Duane Packer. Opening To Channel: How To Connect With Your Guide. Tiburon: HJ Kramer, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International ethics''' is an area of [[international relations theory]] which concerns the extent and scope of ethical obligations between states in an era of [[globalization]]. Schools of thought include [[cosmopolitanism]] and [[anti-cosmopolitanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Baylis, Smith and Owens, The Globalisation of World Politics, OUP, 4th ed, Ch 11&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Realism (international relations)|Realism]], [[Liberalism (international relations)|Liberalism]], and [[Marxist international relations theory|Marxism]] are ethical traditions that conceptually address moral issues in [[international relations]].

==Realism==
Realism’s position is that ethics are secondary, or inapplicable to the affairs of international politics and believes in the primacy of self-interest over moral principle.  The pursuit of self-interest by states is viewed as a ''right'', or ''duty'', making it a principle for Realists to uphold.&lt;ref&gt;Nardin and Mapel, ''Traditions of International Ethics'' (Cambridge Studies in International Relations), Ch 4&lt;/ref&gt;  From their standpoint, the international environment is perpetually [[anarchy (international relations)|anarchic]] and competitive over resources.  There is no overarching authority over states.  Without a superior power to enforce order, ethics do not sustain in international affairs.  Out of ''necessity'', “international conditions compel states to defend their interests by frequently immoral means, and this compulsion of self-defense dissolves moral duties.”&lt;ref&gt;Nardin and Mapel, ''Traditions of International Ethics'' (Cambridge Studies in International Relations), Ch 4&lt;/ref&gt;  It would be considered unethical by the principle of pursuing self-interest, for a state to compromise its goal for power and security.

== Early life ==

Đaja was born on 21 July 1884 in [[Le Havre]], a major port in [[Normandy]], [[France]]. His mother, Delphine Depois-Auger (1861-1902), was French. She was a daughter of the local [[ship-owner]]. His father Božidar “Boža” Đaja (1850-1914) was a [[master (naval)|ship master]], originally working as a sea captain, later switching to river transportation.&lt;ref name="Nedic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pjer"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.politika.rs/scc/clanak/376895/Brat-Pjer|title=Brat Pjer|last=|first=|date=25 March 2017|website=www.politika.rs|publisher=[[Politika]], page 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zabavnik/&gt; Ivan was their eldest child. While they were still living in France, the couple had another son, Aleksandar,&lt;ref name="Nedic"/&gt; who died in 1969. When Ivan was six, the family moved to Belgrade in 1890, where his father took over as the captain of a steamboat, ''[[:sr:Parobrod Deligrad|Deligrad]]''&lt;ref name="Pjer"/&gt;&lt;ref name=zabavnik/&gt;, which was an official diplomatic ship of Serbian rulers. He helmed it until his retirement in 1907. In Belgrade, the couple had a daughter, Olga, their third child (1892-1974). 

Božidar was also an author. He wrote stories about the life of [[Dalmatia]]n sailors who worked on the [[sailing ship]]s and published them in the series of books jointly titled ''Our Seamen'': ''Apprentice'' in 1903, ''Young Man'' in 1904 and ''Helmsman'' in 1909, all three published by the [[Ilija M. Kolarac Endowment]]. When he died in Vienna, he left three more manuscripts from the same series, ready for print: ''Nostromo'', ''Captain'' and ''Old Age''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[Stanoje Stanojević]] |title=Narodna enciklopedija srpsko-hrvatsko-slovenačka, Vol. I A-H, page 623|date=1925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==

Đaja finished elementary and high school in Belgrade. After graduating at [[First Belgrade Gymnasium]] in 1902, he moved back to France, spending one year as a student at the Lycée Pierre-Corneille at [[Rouen]].&lt;ref name="Nedic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pjer"/&gt; He studied philosophy under [[Émile Chartier]].&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; In 1903 he enrolled at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], where one of his fellow students and best friends was Émile Herzog, later famous French author under the name [[Andre Maurois]]. He studied natural sciences ([[botany]], [[physiology]] and [[biochemistry]]) under [[Albert Dastre]], great scientific experimenter, himself a student of [[Claude Bernard]]. Đaja gave his [[final exam]] in 1905 and, mentored by Dastre, received a PhD on 23 July 1909 with the thesis in physiology ''Study on ferments of glycosides and carbohydrates in mollusks and crustaceans''.&lt;ref name="SPE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ESN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;
	
During his studying, he also had several jobs. In 1904, he became the youngest foreign correspondent of Serbian [[daily newspaper|daily]] [[Politika]]. Only 20 years old, he became recently established newspaper’s reporter from Paris and first foreign correspondent in general.&lt;ref name="Nedic"/&gt; He also worked for a while at [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|National Museum of Natural History]] with [[:de:Paul van Tieghem|Paul van Tieghem]], before spending five years at [[Station biologique de Roscoff|Marine station]] in [[Roscoff]], [[Brittany]]. Starting in 1906, he worked there with [[Yves Delage]] and Albert Dastre, beginning his career as a researcher.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

== Academic career ==
=== University ===

He was invited by the biologist [[:sr:Živojin Đorđević|Živojin Đorđević]] to return to Belgrade from France, where he became a [[docent]] at the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Matica"&gt;{{cite book|title=Odabrane biografije (Vol. I-IV), page 136|author=Desanka Kostić|publisher=[[Matica Srpska]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, that same year, he founded the first Chair for physiology in this part of the world, within the Institute for Physiology which he also founded and chaired for 40 years.&lt;ref name="SPE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ESN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MPE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nedic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; When [[World War I]] broke out in 1914, he was in [[Vienna]], and was kept in confinement, under the Austro-Hungarian police watch, until December 1918.&lt;ref name="Nedic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matica"/&gt;

Upon his return to Srbija, Đaja restored the Institute and became associate professor at the University’s Faculty of Philosophy in 1919 obtaining the full professorship in 1921. In 1947, when Faculty for mathematics and natural sciences (PMF) split from the Faculty of Philosophy, Đaja became PMF’s professor.&lt;ref name="SPE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KJK"/&gt; In 1934 he was elected to the one-year tenure as the [[rector (academia)|rector]] of the University of Belgrade. He founded and co-founded numerous scientific institutes both in Yugoslavia and abroad, including People’s University in Belgrade.&lt;ref name="SPE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ESN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nedic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matica"/&gt; He was vice-president of the [[Red Cross of Serbia|Red Cross of Yugoslavia]] in the [[Interbellum]].&lt;ref name=zabavnik/&gt;

[[World War II]] interrupted his work again, as Đaja staunchly opposed the German-appointed [[Government of National Salvation|puppet regime in Serbia]]. He asked to be retired in 1942 and was even confined for a while by the [[quisling]] authorities at the [[Banjica concentration camp]]. He was reactivated in 1945, both as the professor and head of the Institute for Physiology, before finally retiring in 1955.&lt;ref name="Nedic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matica"/&gt;

=== Academies ===

He became associate member of the [[Serbian Royal Academy]] on 18 February 1922, and was elected to the full membership on 16 February 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ljudi intelektualne vrline – 170 godina SANU, page 279|date=2011|publisher=Zavod za udžbenike|isbn=978-86-17-17795-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Academy, he was member of Academy of natural sciences and its secretary from 7 March 1937 to 7 March 1939. He gave his inaugural academic address on 6 March 1932, titled ''Some features of the fight against cold''.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.unilib.rs//oni-su-gradili-srbiju/ivan-djaja/beseda.php?lang=en|title=Ivan Đaja – Inaugural academic address}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reorganization of the Academy in 1947, Đaja was elected a member of Department for mathematics and natural sciences and Department for medical sciences on 22 March 1948. He became secretary of the former from that date to 10 June 1952, while he was entrusted with developing the latter and creating a new Department for arts and music (he himself played a [[Western concert flute|flute]].  He became member of that department, too, on 20 April 1949. In the process of reorganization, Serbian Royal Academy was renamed Serbian Academy of Science in 1947. Đaja later proposed for the name to be expanded by adding arts in the title, which was accepted after his death, in 1960, when thed academy was officially renamed to Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.

Soon after becoming an associated member of the Serbian academy, he was elected to the same position in [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in [[Zagreb]]. He helmed the process of collaboration between the two academies in an effort to realize his idea of creating a biology station for students located on the [[Adriatic Sea]]. As a result, Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries was founded in 1930 in [[Split, Croatia|Split]], on the [[Dalmatia]]n coast (today in [[Croatia]]).&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name=zabavnik/&gt;

Đaja was also a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="KJK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt; He was unanimously elected as a corresponding member in 1955,&lt;ref name="ESN"/&gt; being inaugurated on 28 May 1956 in the Section for medicine and surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.academie-sciences.fr/membres/in_memoriam/in_memoriam_liste_alphabetique_g.htm |title=In memoriam – Members of the French Academy of sciences since foundation (1666) |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123062103/http://www.academie-sciences.fr/membres/in_memoriam/in_memoriam_liste_alphabetique_g.htm |archivedate=2010-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected for his “seminal work on the behaviour of deep cooled warm blooded animals” and took over the academy seat which was left vacant after the death of [[Alexander Fleming]].&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

== Scientific career ==

After he founded the Institute, Đaja began his experimental work, adopting the [[motto]] ''Nulla dies sine experimentum'' (''Not one day without the experiment'').&lt;ref name="Nedic"/&gt; His entire scientific work can be divided into three phases. In the first phase, which started in his student days and lasted up to World War I, he concentrated on the research of the [[endogenic]] [[enzymes]] or [[ferments]], which are produced by the glands of [[digestive organs]]. He created a more rational nomenclature of the enzymes than the ones previously used.

When he returned to Serbia in 1919, his second phase was centered on metabolism. In this period, he published a physiology textbook in 1923, ''Fundamentals of physiology''. In preface, he wrote that “he arranged the subject matter based on one leading idea: that circulation of matter and energy is the basic phenomenon of life, and that all physiological functions are subordinated to it.” He also researched [[bioenergetics]] and an effect of the temperature and asphyxia induced numbness on living organisms. His major work from this phase is the two-volume ''Homeothermy and thermoregulation'' from 1938.

Đaja began to research hypothermia in 1935 and from 1940 it became the focal point of his scientific work. He was especially interested in the ways it can be achieved. With his [[treatise]] ''State similar to the [[winter sleep]] of the [[hibernation|hibernators]] achieved in rat by the means of [[barometric]] depression'', published on 15 January 1940, he began researching the physiology of the deeply cooled [[homeothermous organisms]]. He was interested in thermogenesis, gas circulation in organisms, adaptation to cold, defense role of hypothermia and metabolism in deep hypothermia. His results from this period have found a wide application in medical physiology.

Apart from pure chemical processes in the human body, he was interested in philosophical decoding of the complex functional plexus in the natural world in general. Considering physiology as the branch of biology which synthesizes the entire knowledge of the science of life, Đaja aimed to present the philosophical interpretation of the nature of science, its foundations and future development. He published his philosophical views in ''Following the footsteps of life and science'' in 1931 and ''Man and the inventive life'' in 1955. He presented thesis on the origin of the biological inventive power, purposefulness of certain phenomena in the living world and discussed the concept of usefulness in biology. He tried to comprehend the mechanics of life, chemistry and physical chemistry of the living organisms and to give a unifying scientific philosophical theory which would encompass physiology, evolution and genetics.&lt;ref name="Matica"/&gt;

He was also known as the major popularizer of biology, but also of science and arts in general and was remembered as an excellent lecturer and teacher.&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

== Personal life ==

Đaja married three times. His first wife was French and she died young. He married for the second time to a village teacher from [[Bavanište]], [[Pančevo]]. They had a daughter, Ivanka Đaja-Milanković (1934-2002). Ivanka worked as a journalist in [[Sremska Mitrovica]], where she died, though she spent a long time living in [[Canada]]. Already at an advanced age, he married for the third time, to Leposava Marković (1910-91). She was his former student and collaborator and worked as an assistant and professor at the University of Belgrade. They lived in Belgrade’s neighborhood of [[Profesorska Kolonija]]. Đaja was a good friend with [[Milutin Milanković]].&lt;ref name=zabavnik/&gt;

His paternal uncle was Jovan Đaja (1846-1928), a journalist and politician, member of [[Nikola Pašić]]’s [[People's Radical Party]]. He was president of Serbian association of journalists 1897-99 and [[Minister of Internal Affairs (Serbia)|Minister of internal affairs of Serbia]] 1890-91 and 1891-92.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srpska porodična enciklopedija, Vol. 8, page 118|date=2006|publisher=Narodna knjiga; [[Politika]]|isbn=86-331-2737-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==

In 1957, as president of the Symposium on hypothermia, Đaja was among the principal organizers of the XV congress of the [[International Committee of Military Medicine|Committee of International Congresses of Military Medicine and Pharmacy]] which was held in Belgrade. During the congress, on his way to the venue, Đaja died on 1 October 1957. Among many others, the scientific journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] marked his passing by publishing an [[Obituary|In memoriam]].&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

== Writings ==

Alone, or with his co-workers, Đaja authored over 250 works, out of which over 200 were scientific. Rest of it includes popular, philosophical and children books, translations from French and an autobiography.

He co-authored his first scientific paper in 1906, titled ''Amylolytic inactivity of dialyzed pancreatic juice''. His other initial studies were also centred on enzymology and published in magazines of the Parisian Biology society and French Academy of Sciences. Later, his works were mostly published by the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts and Croatian Natural Society.  Since 1913 he was correspondent for the ''Glasnik'', magazine of the Serbian academy, and later for the ''Medical overview'', ''[[:sr:Srpski književni glasnik|Serbian literary herald]]'' from 1905, ''Foreign review'' from 1933 and ''Science and technics'' from 1941. In 1927-28 he was an editor of the University’s magazine ''University life''.

After publishing his PhD thesis ''Study on ferments of glycosides and carbohydrates in mollusks and crustaceans'' in 1909, his first [[monograph]] was ''Ferments and physiology'' in 1912 and other important works in the next decade include ''Notes on a scientific work'' (1914), ''Biology papers'' (1918), ''Fundamental biological energy and energetics of kvass'' (1919), ''Does living yeast cause fermentation of sugar only by its zymase?'' (1919), ''Use of ferments in cell physiology studies'' (1919), ''Fundamental biological energy'' (1920), ''About electric thermostate'' (1920) and ''Experimental search for the common energetic foundation in living beings'' (1921), while in 1923 he published the first textbook on human and animal physiology in the region, ''Fundamentals of physiology''.&lt;ref name=zabavnik/&gt; Other scientific works include ''Mutual replacement of food ingredients in peak metabolism'' (1926), ''Basal metabolism and homeothermy'' (1929), ''Peak metabolism'' (1929), ''Problem of evolution'' (1931), ''Homeothermy and thermoregulation I-II'' (1938) and ''Hypothermia, hyberniation and poikilotherms'' (1953). Monograph ''Man and the inventive life'', published in 1955, is considered to be his [[opus magnum]]. 

Popular and philosophical works include ''Travels of “Obilić” through South Serbia in 1923'' (1929), ''Following the footsteps of life and science'' (1931), ''From life to civilization'' (1933), ''How do we feed?'' (1935), ''Louis Pasteur'' (1937), ''Downstream'' (1938), ''Twosome conversations'' (1938) and ''The look into life'' (1955), while writings aimed at the children include ''Tales of little Zdravko: book for children on nature, hygiene and health'' (1923) and ''What European youth thinks '' (1929).

In the last year of his life, 1957, he published five papers, while his last article, entitled ''For the scientific youth'', was published in ''Politika'' on the eve of his death. When he died, he left several writings in manuscripts:  ''Conversations in Dubrovnik'', ''Short stories'', ''Memories'', ''Physiology and hypothermia'' and his autobiography ''Discovery of the world''.&lt;ref name="SPE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KJK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MPE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JLZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jovan Hadži]]|title=Narodna enciklopedija srpsko-hrvatsko-slovenačka, Vol. 1 A-H, page 623|date=1925|editor=[[Stanoje Stanojević]] |publisher=Bibliografski zavod}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance and legacy ==

Ivan Đaja is one of the greatest Serbian physiologists and biologists who had the invaluable role in founding the experimentally based scientific physiology in Serbia. Gifted scientist, teacher, philosopher, writer and musician, he was a true modern [[polymath]]. As such, he was the founder of [[biochemistry]] in Serbia and [[Southeast Europe]]. His work brought him a worldwide reputation.&lt;ref name="MPE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

He was among the first scientists who pointed out the role of the adrenal glands in the body’s thermoregulation&lt;ref name="SPE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matica"/&gt; and is considered one of the pioneers in the research of hypothermia. He founded the new scientific branch, high altitude hypothermia (or physiology of the cooled organisms) which has a growing application in modern medicine, much more than it had in Đaja’s time.&lt;ref name="ESN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matica"/&gt;

A diagram he created in 1938 is today known as the ''Đaja’s diagram (of thermoregulation)'' or ''Đaja’s curve'',&lt;ref name="SPE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ESN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://giaja.bio.bg.ac.rs/wiki/diagram-thermoregulation/|title=Giaja’s diagram of thermoregulation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the way he brought organisms to hypothermia (reducing the body temperature by asphyxia and cold environment and then complete recovery by warming up the organism) is named ''Đaja’s method of induced hypothermia'' (“[[hypercapnia]]n hypothermia”).&lt;ref name="ESN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MPE"/&gt; Đaja also invented an apparatus for gas exchange measurement (''Đaja’s apparatus''). He coined the terms ''peak (or maximal) metabolism'' and ''metabolic quotient'' which entered the textbooks on the subject.&lt;ref name="SPE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matica"/&gt;

In the Institute for Physiology of Serbia, which he founded in 1910 and made a world class scientific facility, he was succeeded by his student Radoslav Anđus (1926-2003) who continued his work and the resulting scientific approach became known as the “Belgrade’s School of physiology“.&lt;ref name="ESN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matica"/&gt;

Commemoration named "100 years of Ivan Đaja's Belgrade school of physiology" was organized from 10 to 14 September 2010 by the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Biology. The event was held in the premises of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Artsm with participation of scientists from the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany, Slovakia, etc. A bust of Ivan Đaja was dedicated during the event, which was later moved to the hall of the Faculty of Biology.&lt;ref name=zabavnik/&gt;

== Accolades ==

Already for his first monograph from 1912, “Ferments and Physiology”, Đaja received an award from the Serbian Royal Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

For his studies on hypothermia and thermoregulation, French Academy of Sciences awarded him the Pourat prize in 1940 and the [[Montyon Prizes|Montyon Prize]] in 1946.&lt;ref name="SPE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JLZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matica"/&gt;

In 1954 he was awarded the [[doctor honoris causa]] at the Sorbonne, and was also awarded the French [[Legion of Honour]].&lt;ref name="SPE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ESN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; He was the third Serbian scientist who was awarded Sorbonne’s honorary degree, after [[Nikola Tesla]] and [[Jovan Cvijić]].&lt;ref name="Matica"/&gt; He was also an associate member of the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|National Museum of Natural History]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="KJK"/&gt;

In Belgrade’s municipality of [[Vračar]], a street was named in Đaja’s honor in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.planplus.rs/vracar/ulica/ivana-djaje/431|title=Plan Plus – Ivan Đaja street}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.beograd.rs/lat/upoznajte-beograd/1287593-promene-naziva-ulica-2004/|title=Promene naziva ulica 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrating 100 years of the Institute for Physiology, a commemorative plaque was placed in the street on 10 September 2010.&lt;ref name=zabavnik/&gt;

He was the recipient of the [[Order of the White Eagle (Serbia)|Serbian Order of the White Eagle, 4th class]] and Yugoslav Order of Labour, I rank.&lt;ref name="KJK"/&gt;

== Public image ==

He is remembered as a proper gentleman, always suitably dressed and groomed, and cultural and kind in communication with others. Đaja was also known as propagating humanistic approach, always helping his co-workers and students.  With his students, he organized and participated in transfer of the [[Josif Pančić]] remains from Belgrade to the [[Kopaonik]] mountain. He was known for joking, saying to his friends: "Come by too see my daughter, she is the best in the field of physiology I have done".&lt;ref name="zabavnik"/&gt;

During his tenure at the helm of the University of Belgrade in 1934-35, a major anti-government student protest was organized and to quench it, the police stormed the University. Đaja then supported the students, staunchly protesting the police action. After the war, when the Communists took over the government, he was introduced to the new authoritarian ruler [[Josip Broz Tito]] as the "students mother and red rector". Đaja replied: "I protected them so that they can study, their political fervor I considered a youthful frivolity". When Tito was nominated as the honorable member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Đaja was the only one who voted against him. As a result, the secret service labeled him as "reactionary and misfit". When he was inaugurated to the French Academy of sciences in 1956, Yugoslavia refused to send an ambassador. Đaja stated: "He was free to come, I criticize my country only when I'm in it".&lt;ref name=zabavnik&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://politikin-zabavnik.co.rs/pz/tekstovi/slobodan-covek-na | author = Radomir Mandić | title = Слободан човек на добром гласу | trans-title = Free man with good reputation | date = 2013 | publisher = [[Politikin Zabavnik]], No. 3197 | language = Serbian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IndicText}}
'''Kaundinyasana''' ({{IPA-sa|koːund̪inɟɑːsɐnɐ|IPA}}; {{lang-sa|कोउन्दिन्यासन}}; [[IAST]]: ''koundinyāsana'') '''Sage Koundinya's pose''' is an [[asana]]. It may be performed with both legs bent ('''Dvi Pada Kaundinyasana'''), or with one leg over the supporting arm, the other leg straight ('''Eka Pada Kaundinyasana''').&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url=http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2471 | title=Eka Pada Koundinyasana I | accessdate=2 December 2012 | publisher=Yoga Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url = http://www.yogajournal.com/pose/pose-dedicated-to-the-sage-koundinya-ii/ | title = Eka Pada Koundinyasana II | accessdate = 22 Oct 2015 | publisher = Yoga Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Light on Yoga"&gt;{{cite book |author=Iyengar, B. K. S. |authorlink=B. K. S. Iyengar | title=Light on Yoga | url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0805210318 | year=1966 | publisher=Harper Collins | pages=276, 332–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The asana is dedicated to the sage [[Kaundinya]]. In Kaundinyasana, the strong twist initiated by the legs stimulates the digestive organs and rejuvenates the spine. The asana improves balance and focus as it engages the muscles of the body and helps the mind remain stable.&lt;ref name="Light on Yoga"/&gt;

The name comes from "Kaundinya" ({{lang-sa| कोउन्दिन्य}}), an Indian sage, and ''asana''  ({{lang-sa|आसन}}) meaning "posture" or "seat". The variation for one and two legs include the Sanskrit words for one (ek) or two (dvi), and  "pada" ({{lang-sa|पद}}) meaning "foot".&lt;ref name="Yoga Anatomy"&gt;{{cite book | last=Kaminoff | first=Leslie | title=Yoga Anatomy | url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0736082182 | date=30 June 2007| publisher=Human Kinetics | isbn=0736082182 | page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

Kaundinyasana is traditionally entered from tripod headstand, but one can also get into the asana from [[Parsva Bakasana]].  Get the knee far enough up the triceps of the opposite arm before bending the elbows so that the core is fully engaged and the leg is less likely to slide down, making more work for the arms.

== Benefits ==

The pressure of the legs on the abdomen in this asana massages the abdominal organs.&lt;ref name="Light on yoga"&gt;{{cite book |author=Iyengar, B. K. S. |authorlink=B. K. S. Iyengar | title=Light on Yoga | titlelink=Light on Yoga | year=1966 | publisher=Harper Collins | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spinal twist strengthens and rejuvenates the spine;&lt;ref name="Light on yoga"/&gt; the pose also strengthens the arms and neck.&lt;ref name="Light on yoga"/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Kinko Kurosawa'''|黒沢 琴古|Kurosawa Kinko}} was an 18th-century ''[[komusō]]'' of the [[Fuke-shū|Fuke sect]] of [[Zen Buddhism]]. He was commissioned to travel round [[Japan]] and collect ''[[honkyoku]]'', spiritual ''[[shakuhachi]]'' music pieces from his fellow mendicant monks.  

The resulting collection of 36 ''honkyoku'' are the repertoire of the [[Kinko Ryu]] school of ''shakuhachi''.

The '''Epistle of Jerome to Pope Damasus I''' (Latin: ''Epistula Hieronymi ad Damasum papam''), written in 376 or 377 AD, is a response of [[Jerome]] to an epistle from [[Pope Damasus I|Damasus]], who had urged him to make a new translational work of the Holy Scripture. The letter was written before Jerome started his translation work (382–405).

Jerome agreed that Old-Latin translation should be revised and corrected, acknowledging the numerous differences between every Latin manuscript such that each one looked like its own version. To remedy the problem, Jerome agreed that they should be corrected on the basis of the Greek manuscripts. Jerome explained why the Old-Latin order of the Gospels (Matthew, John, Luke, Mark) should be changed into the order Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, because it is relevant for the Greek manuscripts. Jerome also explained the importance of the [[Eusebian Canons]] and how to use them.

Copies of the letter occur in many Latin manuscript [[Gospel book]]s and Bibles (even in Old Latin [[Codex Sangallensis 48]]). Usually it is placed at the beginning of the gospel book (e.g. Codex Sangallensis 48 or the [[Lindau Gospels]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1967">'''Minimal logic''', or '''minimal calculus''', is a [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]] system originally developed by [[Ingebrigt Johansson]] (1936). It is a variant of [[intuitionistic logic]] that rejects not only the [[classical logic|classical]] [[law of excluded middle]] (as intuitionistic logic does), but also the [[principle of explosion]] (ex falso quodlibet).

Like intuitionistic logic, minimal logic can be formulated in a language using → ([[logical implication|implication]]), ∧ ([[logical conjunction|conjunction]]), ∨ ([[logical disjunction|disjunction]]), and ⊥ ([[falsum]]) as the basic [[logical connective|connectives]], treating ¬A ([[negation]]) as an abbreviation for A → ⊥. In this language, it is axiomatized by the positive fragment (i.e., formulas using only →, ∧, and ∨) of intuitionistic logic, with no additional axioms or rules about ⊥. Thus minimal logic is a subsystem of intuitionistic logic,  and it is strictly weaker as it does not derive the ''ex falso quodlibet'' principle &lt;math&gt;\bot \vdash B&lt;/math&gt; (however, it derives its special case &lt;math&gt;\bot \vdash \neg B&lt;/math&gt;).

Adding the ex falso axiom &lt;math&gt;\neg A\to(A\to B)&lt;/math&gt; to minimal logic results in intuitionistic logic, and adding the double negation law &lt;math&gt;\neg\neg A\to A&lt;/math&gt; to minimal logic results in classical logic (Troelstra and Schwichtenburg 2000:37)

The '''Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues''' (the Bioethics Commission) was created by {{Executive Order|13521}} on November 24, 2009.&lt;ref name="EO13521"&gt;[[s:Executive Order 13521|Executive Order 13521]] - ''Establishing the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues'', November&amp;nbsp;24,&amp;nbsp;2009, Vol.&amp;nbsp;74, No.&amp;nbsp;228,&amp;nbsp;{{USFedReg|74|62671}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bioethics Commission advised President Barack Obama on [[bioethical]] issues arising from advances in biomedicine and related areas of science and technology. It replaces [[The President's Council on Bioethics]] appointed by United States President [[George W. Bush]] to advise his administration on bioethics, and the [[National Bioethics Advisory Commission]] (1996-2001).

== Criticism ==

[[Sam Harris]], author of [[The Moral Landscape|The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values]], has publicly noted his discussions with a member of this panel, specifically regarding the hypothesis of a society that [[Visual_impairment#Injuries|blinds]] every third citizen for [[Religion|religious reasons]]. The panel member found this unobjectionable for members of this [[Cultural relativism|culture]], while Harris found this practice objectively wrong. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trythought.com/blog/2010/10/whos-to-say-if-ritual-blinding-is-wrong/ |title=Who’s to say if ritual blinding is ‘wrong?’ |first= |last= |work=TryThought |date=October 2010 |accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris details a transcript of this conversation in Chapter 2 of his book. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://edthemanicstreetpreacher.wordpress.com/tag/biola-university/|title=Video of William Lane Craig’s misrepresentation of Sam Harris during and after their debate on morality |first= |last= |work= |date=March 2014 |accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Thinker close.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Philosophical quietists want to release man from deep perplexity that philosophical contemplation often causes.]]

'''Quietism''' in [[philosophy]] is an approach to the subject that sees the role of philosophy as broadly [[therapeutic approach|therapeutic]] or remedial. Quietist philosophers believe that philosophy has no positive thesis to contribute, but rather that its value is in defusing confusions in the linguistic and conceptual frameworks of other subjects, including non-quietist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Virvidakis|first=Stelios|last2=Kindi|first2=Vasso|title=Quietism|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/display/id/obo-9780195396577-0184|journal=Oxford Bibliographies Online Datasets|doi=10.1093/obo/9780195396577-0184}}&lt;/ref&gt; By re-formulating supposed problems in a way that makes the misguided reasoning from which they arise apparent, the quietist hopes to put an end to humanity's confusion, and help return to a state of intellectual quietude.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Quietist philosophers==

By its very nature, quietism is not a [[List of schools of philosophy|philosophical school]] as understood in the traditional sense of a body of doctrines, but still it can be identified both by its [[methodology]], which focuses on [[language]] and the use of [[word]]s, and by its objective, which is to show that most philosophical problems are only [[pseudo-problem]]s.

[[Pyrrhonism]] represents perhaps the earliest example of an identifiably quietist position in the West. [[Sextus Empiricus]] regarded Pyrrhonism not as a nihilistic attack but rather as a form of philosophical therapy:

{{Quote|text=The causal principle of scepticism we say is the hope of becoming tranquil. Men of talent, troubled by the anomaly in things and puzzled as to which of them they should rather assent to, came to investigate what in things is true and what false, thinking that by deciding these issues they would become tranquil. The chief constitutive principle of scepticism is the claim that to every account an equal account is opposed; for it is from this, we think, that we come to hold no beliefs.|sign=[[Sextus Empiricus]]|source=''[[Outlines of Pyrrhonism|Outlines of Scepticism]]'', 12}}

Contemporary discussion of quietism can be traced back to [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], whose work greatly influenced the [[Ordinary language philosophy|Ordinary Language philosophers]]. One of the early 'ordinary language' works, [[Gilbert Ryle]]'s ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'', attempted to demonstrate that [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] arises from a failure to appreciate that mental vocabulary and physical vocabulary are simply different ways of describing one and the same thing, namely human behaviour. [[J. L. Austin]]'s ''[[Sense and Sensibilia (Austin)|Sense and Sensibilia]]'' took a similar approach to the problems of [[skepticism]] and the reliability of [[Perception|sense perception]], arguing that they arise only by misconstruing ordinary language, not because there is anything genuinely wrong with [[empirical evidence]]. [[Norman Malcolm]], a friend of Wittgenstein's, took a quietist approach to skeptical problems in the [[philosophy of mind]]. More recently, the philosophers [[John McDowell]] and [[Richard Rorty]] have taken explicitly quietist positions.

[[File:Benvenuto-fronte-triste.jpg|thumb|200px|Sergio Benvenuto]]
'''Sergio Benvenuto''' (born 1948 in [[Naples]], Italy) is an Italian [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]], [[philosopher]] and author. He is researcher for the Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies (ISTC) of the Italian National Research Council ([[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche|CNR]]) in [[Rome]]. He is Professor Emeritus in [[Psychoanalysis]] at the International Institute of Depth Psychology in Kiev. He founded and edited the European Journal of Psychoanalysis (since 2012 also published in Russian).

==Biography==
He studied at the University of [[Paris]] 7 between 1967 and 1973, where he obtained a Maîtrise (master's degree) in Psychology. In the same period he followed seminars by [[Roland Barthes]] (at the École Pratique des Hautes Etudes) and [[Jacques Lacan]]. 
He obtained his second degree in [[Sociology]] (in 1976) at the University of Urbino (Italy) and trained in psychoanalysis with analysts [[Elvio Fachinelli]] and [[Diego Napolitani]] in Milan, where he lived and worked between 1974 and 1979. He was Visiting Researcher at the Philosophy Department  of the New School for Social Research (1989-1991).  Since moving from Milan to Rome he has divided his work activities between research in Social Psychology with CNR, his private practice as analyst and his writing, both as author of papers and as journalist publishing in newspapers and magazines. 
In 1984, he co-founded the cultural magazine Lettre Internationale (which comes out with editions in German, Italian, Spanish and several other languages). He also contributes to American Imago and to various international magazines (such as the French L’Evolution psychiatrique and Cliniques Méditerranéennes, the German Texte, the Russian Psykoanalyz). In 1995 he founded in New York the semestral Journal of European Psychoanalysis, later EJPsy - European Journal of Psychoanalysis, which he edited until 2012 (www.journal-psychoanalysis.eu). Since 2011 he teaches Psychoanalysis at Kiev’s  Institute of Depth Psychology.

==Thought==
Benvenuto has addressed fields apparently very different from one another – social psychology, philosophy of language, political philosophy, psychoanalysis, political theory – in the nineties he began to structure a predominant project that touches upon all these fields: to replace the primacy of reflection on Truth (typical of Western culture) with a reflection that aims at the Real. In this way he seeks a third way between the two predominant and opposing Western cultures:  positivist epistemology (concerned with the truth conditions of propositions) on the one hand, and hermeneutics (concerned with disclosing a Truth that unravels throughout human history) on the other. He adopts the concept of Real from Jacques Lacan, but broadens its meaning, including in it everything that remains external (origin and remainder) to every structure of sense, whether scientific, aesthetic, ethical and political. The Real is the background upon which every scientific theory, every artistic production, the psychoanalysis of each subject, every ethic arrangement, revolves and it is always in excess of all these “discourses”. Thus, the Real of every scientific theory is the Chaos that sets itself as the limit and background of every causative process. The Real in psychoanalysis is the background to the drives, the bodily, irreducibly individual background before which all interpretation stops. 
In particular (for example in La strategia freudiana [The Freudian Strategy] and in Perversionen [Perversions]) he has engaged in an original reinterpretation of Freudian theory and of psychoanalysis in general, as founded on a precise metaphysics of “the signifying flesh”. Freud’s interpretative and explicative tissue, however, also refers to something uninterpretable and inexplicable: the drive as an opaque non-signifying source of subjectivity.

The '''Tiger Mask donation phenomenon''' is a series of [[donation]]s of ''[[randoseru]]'' (school backpacks) and other items to [[orphanage]]s around [[Japan]]. The first donation happened when someone left ten 30,000-yen backpacks at a child guidance center in [[Gunma Prefecture]] on [[Christmas Day]] in 2010. A note attached to the bags was signed "Naoto Date", the real name of the titular character of ''[[Tiger Mask]]'', a popular 1960s and 70s [[manga]] about a [[wrestler]] who fought for orphans, being raised in an orphanage himself. Since the initial donation, copycat donations have appeared around Japan at various facilities for children, ranging from more backpacks to toys, food, and monetary gifts.

==Naoto Date/Tiger Mask background==
{{Main|Tiger Mask}}

Many of the donations have been made under the name of Naoto Date, a character in the [[manga]] and [[anime]] ''[[Tiger Mask]]''. In the manga and anime, Tiger Mask (whose real name was Naoto Date) was a feared [[Heel (wrestling)|heel]] wrestler in America who was extremely vicious in the ring. However, he became a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] after returning to Japan when a young boy said that he wanted to be a villain like Tiger Mask when he grew up. The boy lived in an orphanage, the same one that Tiger Mask grew up in during his childhood. Feeling that he did not want the boy to idolize a villain, Tiger was inspired to be a heroic wrestler and fights for the children in the orphanage.&lt;ref name="ANN1starticleTM"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2010-12-27/manga/anime-hero-leaves-gifts-on-christmas-morning |title = Interest: Manga/Anime Hero Leaves Gifts on Christmas Morning |publisher = [[Anime News Network]] |date = 2010-12-27 |accessdate = 2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANN2tharticleTM"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2011-01-06/manga/anime-tiger-mask-inspires-another-gift-giver |title = Interest: Manga/Anime's Tiger Mask Inspires Another Gift-Giver |publisher = [[Anime News Network]] |date = 2011-01-06 |accessdate = 2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANN3rdarticleTM"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2011-01-08/manga/anime-tiger-mask-inspires-3-more-gift-givers |title = Interest: Manga/Anime's Tiger Mask Inspires 4 More Gift-Givers (Updated) |publisher = [[Anime News Network]] |date = 2011-01-08 |accessdate = 2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANN4tharticleTM"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2011-01-09/tiger-mask-manga/anime-inspires-7th-8th-donor |title = Interest: Tiger Mask Manga/Anime Inspires 7th, 8th Donor (Updated) |publisher = [[Anime News Network]] |date = 2011-01-09 |accessdate = 2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANN5tharticleTM"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2011-01-10/tiger-mask-donors-strike-again-in-8-more-cities |title = Interest: Tiger Mask Donors Strike Again in 8 More Cities |publisher = [[Anime News Network]] |date = 2011-01-10 |accessdate = 2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANN6tharticleTM"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2011-01-11/100-tiger-mask-donors-now-reported-all-over-japan |title = Interest: 100 Tiger Mask Donors Now Reported All Over Japan |publisher = [[Anime News Network]] |date = 2011-01-11 |accessdate = 2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNBlog"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/01/11/gifts-from-comic-heroes-help-japans-orphans/?hpt=Sbin |title = Gifts from 'comic heroes' help Japan's orphans |publisher = [[CNN]] |date = 2011-01-11 |accessdate = 2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Donations==

===First donation===
On 25 December 2010, in Maebashi City, Gunma Prefecture, a child guidance center was visited by someone leaving ten 30,000-yen (about US$360) backpacks: five black backpacks wrapped with blue ribbons, and five red backpacks wrapped with pink ribbons. A card attached to the bags simply said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Please use these backpacks for the children.

''(signed)'' Naoto Date &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The backpacks were to be distributed between six orphans from six different orphanages in Gunma.&lt;ref name="ANN1starticleTM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNBlog"/&gt;

===Second donation===
A second donation was found by a security guard at the [[Odawara]] Child Guidance Center in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] on 1 January 2011. Six backpacks, three black and three red, were left. A note left behind stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A New Year's gift&amp;nbsp;— Naoto Date
&lt;br&gt;
The donation of backpacks in Gunma last year moved me deeply. My heart skipped a beat when I heard the news. Thinking I might do something as well, I offer these gifts. May the Tiger Mask movement live on.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As with the ten original backpacks in Gunma, they were left with a note signed by Naoto Date. The backpacks were to be distributed to new arrivals at the local orphanages and other children that Odawara Child Guidance center serves.&lt;ref name="ANN2tharticleTM"/&gt;

===Copycat donations===
Japan has around 580 children's centers that house around 30,000 children.&lt;ref name="ANN6tharticleTM"/&gt;

As of January 11, 2011, over 100 donations inspired by Tiger Mask have been reported across Japan.&lt;ref name="ANN6tharticleTM"/&gt; After the two initial donations, many other orphanages and children's facilities began to receive copycat donations of backpacks. Some have also received toys, food, and money to help pay for new backpacks. In addition, parallels to other anime and manga concerning orphaned children have also crept into the donation phenomenon.&lt;ref name="ANN5tharticleTM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ANN6tharticleTM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNBlog"/&gt;

===2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami===
Sometime during the night of March 17 - morning of March 18, three cars parked at an evacuation center in [[Yamada, Iwate|Yamadamachi]], [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]] had their tanks filled up and two 20-liter containers of [[heating oil]] were left outside the center by an unknown person. An evacuee discovered the donation upon starting his car and noticing his fuel gauge go from nearly empty to full. The evacuee noted: "We had hardly any fuel left. We were in a real pinch. I'm so grateful for the donation. I reckon it was Tiger Mask." The evacuation center noted that they would use the heating oil during the night to conserve fuel due to [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|the ongoing crisis]].&lt;ref name="TMTōhoku"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T110322002426.htm |title = 'Tiger Mask' donates gas, oil for evacuees |publisher = [[The Yomiuri Shimbun]] |date = Mar 23, 2011 |accessdate = Mar 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other child welfare offices and agencies have reported increased, anonymous donations in the aftermath of the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jiji Press]], "March 11 catastrophe spurs return of mysterious 'Tiger Mast' philanthropic movement", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 10 January 2012, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural aspects===
Because tax benefits for charitable donations are limited in Japan, a culture of charity donations has never really taken root.  For example, the ratio of charitable donations by individuals in Japan is 52.5%, compared with 82.7% for the US.  Also, Japanese culture emphasizes modesty, which means that Japanese people are generally reluctant to do good deeds in public view.  Therefore, the Tiger Mask movement assuages both cultural inhibitions towards charitable deeds; it gives people in Japan a reason to donate while allowing them to do so anonymously.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hiragana Times]]'', "How Japanese Culture Created the Tiger Mask Movement", March 2011, Volume No. 293, pp. 18-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several donators left notes purportedly from other fictional characters from franchises outside the Tiger Mask series. Notable characters who "donated" include Rei and Kaji from ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', [[Haruhi Suzumiya (character)|Haruhi Suzumiya]], and [[Stitch (Lilo &amp; Stitch)|Stitch]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27841">{{Contains Egyptian Hieroglyphic text|article}}The '''Turin King List''', also known as the '''Turin Royal Canon''', is an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[hieratic]] [[papyrus]] thought to date from the reign of Pharaoh [[Ramesses II]], now in the [[Museo Egizio]] (Egyptian Museum)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museoegizio.it/ |title=Museo Egizio  homepage |accessdate=20 December 2010 }} {{it icon}} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; in  [[Turin]]. The papyrus is the most extensive list available of kings compiled by the ancient Egyptians, and is the basis for most [[chronology]] before the reign of Ramesses II.

[[File:TurinPapyrus1904.png|thumb|800px|centre|1904 version of attempt to assemble parts of the Turin King list]]

==Creation and use==
The papyrus is believed to date from the reign of [[Ramesses II]], during the middle of the [[New Kingdom]], or the [[19th Dynasty]]. The beginning and ending of the list are now lost; there is no introduction, and the list does not continue after the 19th Dynasty. The composition may thus have occurred at any subsequent time, from the reign of Ramesses II to as late as the [[20th Dynasty]].
 
The papyrus lists the names of rulers, the lengths of reigns in years, with months and days for some kings. In some cases they are grouped together by family, which corresponds approximately to the dynasties of [[Manetho]]’s book. The list includes the names of ephemeral rulers or those ruling small territories that may be unmentioned in other sources.

The list also is believed to contain kings from the [[15th Dynasty]], the [[Hyksos]] who ruled [[Lower Egypt]] and the [[Nile Delta|River Nile delta]]. The Hyksos rulers do not have [[cartouche]]s (enclosing borders which indicate the name of a king), and a [[hieroglyph]]ic sign is added to indicate that they were foreigners, although typically on King Lists foreign rulers are not listed.

The papyrus was originally a tax roll, but on its back is written a list of rulers of [[Egypt]] – including mythical kings such as gods, demi-gods, and spirits, as well as human kings. That the back of an older papyrus was used may indicate that the list was not of great formal importance to the writer, although the primary function of the list is thought to have been as an administrative aid. As such, the papyrus is less likely to be biased against certain rulers and is believed to include all the kings of Egypt known to its writers up to the 19th or 20th Dynasty.

==Discovery and reconstruction==
The papyrus was found by the Italian traveler [[Bernardino Drovetti]] in 1820 at [[Luxor]] (Thebes), Egypt and was acquired in 1824 by the Egyptian Museum in Turin, Italy and was designated Papyrus Number 1874. When the box in which it had been transported to Italy was unpacked, the list had disintegrated into small fragments. [[Jean-Francois Champollion]], examining it, could recognize only some of the larger fragments containing royal names, and produced a drawing of what he could decipher. A reconstruction of the list was created to better understand it and to aid in research.

The Saxon researcher [[Gustav Seyffarth]] (1796–1885) re-examined the fragments, some only one square centimeter in size, and made a more complete reconstruction of the papyrus based only on the papyrus fibers, as he could not yet determine the meaning of the hieratic characters. Subsequent work on the fragments was done by the Munich Egyptologist [[Jens Peter Lauth]], which largely confirmed the Seyffarth reconstruction.

In 1997, prominent Egyptologist [[Kim Ryholt]] published a new and better interpretation of the list in his book, "The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period c. 1800–1550 B.C." After another study of the papyrus, an updated version from Ryholt is expected. Egyptologist [[Donald Redford]] has also studied the papyrus and has noted that although many of the list's names correspond to monuments and other documents, there are some discrepancies and not all of the names correspond, questioning the absolute reliability of the document for pre-Ramesses II chronology.

Despite attempts at reconstruction, approximately 50% of the papyrus remains missing. This papyrus as presently constituted is 1.7 m long and 0.41 m wide, broken into over 160 fragments. In 2009, previously unpublished fragments were discovered in the storage room of the Egyptian Museum of Turin, in good condition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lastampa.it/_web/cmstp/tmplrubriche/arte/grubrica.asp?ID_blog=62&amp;ID_articolo=1164&amp;ID_sezione=117&amp;sezione=News] wayback machine: [https://web.archive.org/web/20120223080309/http://www.lastampa.it/_web/cmstp/tmplrubriche/arte/grubrica.asp?ID_blog=62&amp;ID_articolo=1164&amp;ID_sezione=117&amp;sezione=News] (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt; A new edition of the papyrus is expected.

The name [[Hudjefa]], found twice in the papyrus, is now known to have been used by the royal scribes of the [[Ramesses II|Ramesside era]] during the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|19th dynasty]] of [[ancient Egypt]] when the scribes compiled king lists such as the [[Saqqara King List|royal table of Sakkara]] and the royal canon of Turin and the name of a deceased [[pharaoh]] was unreadable, damaged, or completely erased.

==Contents of the papyrus==
The papyrus is divided into eleven columns, distributed as follows. The names and positions of several kings are still being disputed, since the list is so badly damaged.

*Column 1 — Gods of Ancient Egypt
*Column 2 — Gods of Ancient Egypt, spirits and mythical kings
*Column 3 — Rows 11-25 (Dynasties 1-2)
*Column 4 — Rows 1-25 (Dynasties 2-5)
*Column 5 — Rows 1-26 (Dynasties 6-8/9/10)
*Column 6 — Rows 12-25 (Dynasties 11-12)
*Column 7 — Rows 1-2 (Dynasties 12-13)
*Column 8 — Rows 1-23 (Dynasty 13)
*Column 9 — Rows 1-27 (Dynasty 13-14)
*Column 10 — Rows 1-30 (Dynasty 14)
*Column 11 — Rows 1-30 (Dynasties 14-17)

{{nihongo|'''''Zendō'''''|禅堂}} ({{zh|Chántáng}}) or {{nihongo|''senbutsu-jō''|選仏場}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] "[[meditation]] hall".  In [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]], the ''zen-dō'' is a spiritual ''[[dōjō]]'' where ''[[zazen]]'' (sitting meditation) is practiced.  A full-sized Zen Buddhist temple will typically have at least one ''zen-dō'' as well as a {{nihongo|''hon-dō''}} ("[[Main Hall (Japanese Buddhism)|main hall]]", but sometimes translated as "Buddha hall"), which is used for ceremonial purposes, plus a variety of other buildings with different functions.  However, any place where people go to practice Zen can be referred to as a ''zen-dō''.

==Mealtimes==
Meals are in some temples eaten in the zendo during [[sesshin]]. Three meals a day are served. Breakfast is served in the early morning, before dawn. It normally consists of rice gruel and pickled vegetables. Two meals are taken later; at noon and late afternoon. The noon meal is the main meal. These meals usually consist of rice, vegetable soup and pickled vegetables. The afternoon meal consists of leftovers from the noon meal.
The ''Hridaya [[Sūtra]]'' and the "five meditations" are recited before breakfast and lunch. During lunch monks will offer some of their meal to the [[pretas]] or hungry ghosts.  The monks remain silent during mealtimes and communicate via hand and arm gestures.&lt;ref&gt;"''An Introduction to Zen Buddhism''" Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki, The Random House Group, Chapter 9 "''The Meditation Hall and the Monk's Life''", Pages 118-132&lt;/ref&gt;
