'''California Proposition 18''' was on the November 4, 1958 [[California ballot measure]] as an initiated constitutional amendment. This measure is more commonly referred as the "right to work" law and would have added a new provision, Section 1-A to Article 1 of the State Constitution. The amendment would “prohibit employers and employee organizations from entering into collective bargaining or other agreements which establish membership in a labor organization, or payment of dues or charges of any kind, as a condition of employment or continued employment.”&lt;ref name="lib"&gt;{{cite web|title=1958 California Ballot|url=http://librarysource.uchastings.edu/ballot_pdf/1958g.pdf|access-date=2013-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811070226/http://librarysource.uchastings.edu/ballot_pdf/1958g.pdf#|archive-date=2014-08-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, making union membership voluntary, rather than compulsory, for employment.&lt;ref name="UCHastings Law Library"&gt;{{cite web|title=General Election Ballot Pamphlet [Proposition #s 1-18] (November 4, 1958)|url=http://librarysource.uchastings.edu/ballot_pdf/1958g.pdf|publisher=UCHastings Law Library|accessdate=30 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811070226/http://librarysource.uchastings.edu/ballot_pdf/1958g.pdf|archivedate=11 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wells"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wells|first=Joseph|title=Right-to-Work Law and Union Strength|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=October 19, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt;

The proposition would also declare certain practices unlawful such as those  practices relating to membership in labor organizations. It also provides for injunction and damage suits against any individuals or group found to violate or attempt to violate the amendment. Proposition 18 also provides the definition for a “labor organization”.&lt;ref name="lib"/&gt; The proposition did not pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Proposition 18, Prohibition of Collective Bargaining (1958)|url=http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_18,_Prohibition_of_Collective_Bargaining_(1958)|publisher=Ballotpedia.org|accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Unions started to gain ground following the passage of several governmental acts such as the [[Railway Labor Act of 1926]], [[Wagner Act|Wagner Act of 1935]], and the [[National Labor Relations Act|Taft Hartley Act of 1957]]. The newly empowered unions would be able to engage in [[union shop]] activities due to the nature of these acts.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, Augustine B. "Should It Be Illegal To Require Union Membership As A Condition Of Employment? CON." Congressional Digest 36.10 (1957): 235-237. Academic Search Complete. Web. 1 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; With negotiating power now firmly in the hands of union officials and employers a growing concern about the power of employment and safety of workers' rights loomed. There was a shift from craft-unions to industrial-unions, ultimately changing the population of union members from approximately 3,000,000 in 1935 to 15,000,000 in 1945.  Labor unions had more power than they ever did before.  In response to these major changes, Congress passed the [[Labor Management Relations Act of 1947|Taft-Hartley Act of 1947]].&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt;  The [[Labor Management Relations Act of 1947|Taft-Hartley Act of 1947]], still in effect today, forbids certain practices by unions, including forcing workers to join a union, and allowed states to elect to pass [[right-to-work laws]].

The creation of the [[McClellan Committee]], which was a select committee in charge of investigating the extent of corruption in labor-management relations, would expose many corrupt bosses and labor unions.&lt;ref name="lib"/&gt; This national issue would be decided on the state level.

==Proponents==
Proponents of the constitutional amendment argued that all workers should have the right to elect whether or not they join a labor organization. Supporters of the proposition believed that voluntary unionism would provide a safeguard against the exploitation that could arise from monopoly control of employment.&lt;ref name="lib"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UCHastings Law Library"/&gt;

Those who supported the measure reasoned that it would grant workers the freedom of choice that was guaranteed in the U.S Constitution to all American citizens.&lt;ref name="lib"/&gt; This amendment would consequently protect workers from the unfair practices and corruption of employers and union officers.

Supporters also claimed that passing the right-to-work law in California would help rid of disloyal union leaders.&lt;ref name="ProQuest Historical Newspapers: Los Angeles Times (1881-1989) pg. B3"&gt;{{cite news|title=Irene Dunne Will Work to Help Proposition 18|newspaper=LA Times|date=September 26, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supporters include:'''
*William Jennings Bryan Jr., Co-chairman of Southern California section of Californians for Yes on Prop 18, son of [[William Jennings Bryan]]&lt;ref name="ProQuest Historical Newspapers: Los Angeles Times (1881-1989) pg. 5"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bryan Son Takes Post in Right-to-Work Group|newspaper=LA Times|date=September 10, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Irene Dunne]], honorary chairmanship of Women’s Division for Californians yes on Prop 18&lt;ref name="ProQuest Historical Newspapers: Los Angeles Times (1881-1989) pg. B3"/&gt;   
* August E. Sommerfield, Former Steward, Local 170, [[Sheet Metal Workers' International Association|Sheetmetal Workers Unions]]&lt;ref name="UCHastings Law Library"/&gt;
* Arthur E. Simpson, Member, Local 770, [[Retail Clerks International Union|Retail Clerks Union]], California Coordinator, Committee for Democracy in Labor Unions&lt;ref name="UCHastings Law Library"/&gt;
*Howard B. Wyatt, Member, Local 626, [[Teamsters]] Union Executive Secretary, Committee for Democracy in Labor Unions &lt;ref name="UCHastings Law Library"/&gt;

==Opponents==
Opponents argued that, the so-called “right to work” measure would jeopardize California's economy and pit employers and employees against one another during a time when there is a fluctuating national economy and international tension.&lt;ref name="lib"/&gt; The resulting tension between employers and employees would destroy industrial relations

The measure was deemed immoral and ran contrary to the U.S democratic system. The U.S government is based on the principle of majority rule and according to the [[Taft Hartley Act]]  states that union open shop can only exist where there is majority rule because the majority of employees has chosen a single union as their bargaining agent.&lt;ref name="lib"/&gt; According to opponents of the measure union open shop is therefore “the American, democratic way” as well.&lt;ref name="lib"/&gt;

Opponents of Proposition 18 quote statistics from the U.S Department of Commerce that reveal California's per capita income is 60 percent larger than those states who passed such “right to work” measures. Therefore, passage of the proposition would lower income and profits of all professional persons.&lt;ref name="lib"/&gt;

===Spending===
Opponents of Prop. 18 recorded spending $1,250,000 against the measure, according to the Secretary of State's office.  Their receipts totaled $1,523,653, while spending $1,241,196.  Supporters of Prop. 18 recorded their receipts to total $507,053 and spending $390,419.&lt;ref name="ProQuest Historical Newspapers: Los Angeles Times (1881-1989) pg.9"&gt;{{cite news|title=Prop. 18 Fees Report Costs of $1,241,196|newspaper=LA Times|date=September 30, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prop. 18 opposition outspent the supporters three to one.  It was reported that [[General Electric]] was the biggest supporter of the proposition residing outside of California, with the majority being spend on advertising.  The largest out-of-state check written for the opposition was by the National Council for Industrial Peace in Washington.&lt;ref name="ProQuest Historical Newspapers: Los Angeles Times (1881-1989) pg.A15"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lahey|first=Edwin A.|title=Right-to-Work Forces Outspent 3-1 by Labor|newspaper=The Washington Post and Times Herald (1954-1959)|date=October 28, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
California Proposition 18 was defeated in the general elections of 1958 on November 4. It was defeated by the efforts of unions and civil rights groups who fought to maintain the status quo, maintaining union strength. The labor issue created a rift in the Republican Party caused by the rivalry of Governor [[Goodwin J. Knight]] and Senator [[William F. Knowland]] would create a shift in the political tide in favor of the Democrats.&lt;ref name="Anderson, Totton J 1959 pp. 276-300"&gt;Anderson, Totton J. "The 1958 Election in California." The Western Political Quarterly , Vol. 12, No. 1, Part 2 (Mar., 1959), pp. 276-300&lt;/ref&gt; The liberal Democrats would remain firm and united in opposing the proposition, which would pay off with [[Pat Brown|Edmund G. Brown]] winning the governorship of California and political control of California being held firmly in the hands of the Democratic party.&lt;ref name="Anderson, Totton J 1959 pp. 276-300"/&gt;

The '''Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime and on the Financing of Terrorism''', also known as the '''Warsaw Convention''' or '''CETS 198''', is a [[Council of Europe]] [[Treaty|convention]] which aims to facilitate international co-operation and mutual assistance in investigating crime and tracking down, seizing and [[confiscation|confiscating]] the proceeds thereof. 

This Convention is the first international treaty covering both the prevention and the control of money laundering and the [[Terrorism Financing|financing of terrorism]]. This instrument recognises that quick access to financial information or information on assets held by criminal organisations, including terrorist groups, is the key to successful preventive and repressive measures, and, ultimately, is the best way to stop them.

CETS 198 builds on and updates the [[1990 Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime|1990 Strasbourg Convention]]; it takes into account the fact that [[terrorism]] can be financed not only through [[money laundering]] from [[crime|criminal activity]], but also through legitimate activities. The Convention also includes a mechanism to ensure the proper implementation by Parties of its provisions.

The Convention was opened for signature in Warsaw on 16 May 2005 and entered into force on 1 May 2008. It was last ratified by [[Turkey]] in May 2016, bringing the number of parties to 28. It has been signed but not ratified by another 11 states plus the [[European Union]].

==History==

===Context===
Money laundering involves a series of complicated financial operations ([[Deposit (finance)|deposit]], withdrawals, [[Wire transfer|bank transfers]], etc.) which ultimately results in criminal money becoming "clean" and acceptable for legitimate business purposes. This laundered criminal money is recycled through normal businesses and thus may penetrate legitimate markets and corrupt entire economies.

Misuse of the financial system is not limited to money laundering schemes designed to preserve and maximise proceeds from crimes which have been committed. The financial system is misused in similar ways to fund terrorist atrocities. After the [[September 11 attacks]], the international community rapidly recognised the important similarities between the processes involved in money laundering and in the financing of terrorism. Traditionally, the financing of terrorism stemmed from illegal activities, e.g. bank robberies, weapons and drug [[Illegal drug trade|trafficking]], etc. However, in recent years, a new phenomenon had grown: the carrying out of legitimate activities to finance terrorist actions. In this case, the phenomenon is the opposite of money laundering: the "clean" money collected through charities, legitimate commercial activities and so on, can be used to finance terrorist actions. The above considerations led to the Council of Europe’s decision to update the 1990 Strasbourg Convention.

===Updating the 1990 Strasbourg Convention===
One of the major purposes of the 1990 Strasbourg Convention was to facilitate international cooperation in the area of money laundering, which could only be accomplished if steps were taken to minimise the significant differences of approach which then existed in the domestic legal systems of member States. CETS 198 has left the general structure of the 1990 Convention untouched.

At the time of its elaboration, the Select Committee of Experts which drafted the 1990 Convention was not in a position to draw upon a settled and developed body of domestic law and practice. International cooperation in this sphere was relatively unknown. Indeed, save for the limited scope provided by the 1988 [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]], the area was a new one for the vast majority of members of the international community.

In the period of over ten years which had elapsed since the text of the 1990 Convention was adopted, valuable experience had been gained. The mutual evaluation procedures of the [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF), which updated its Recommendations in 1996 and 2003, and added 8 Special Recommendations in 2001 and one more in 2004,&lt;ref name="FATFRec"&gt;{{cite web|title=FATF 40 Recommendations of 2003|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/pdfs/FATF%20Recommendations%202003.pdf|publisher=FATF web portal|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the similar work undertaken by the [[MONEYVAL]], had provided valuable insights into the problems which had arisen both in the domestic implementation of anti-money laundering measures, and in international cooperation. The remits of these two evaluative bodies had also been extended to cover assessment of the effectiveness of measures taken in jurisdictions to counter terrorist financing.

Further debate on this issue had been stimulated by developments in other fora. On 26 June 2001, the [[European Union]] had adopted the Framework Decision on money laundering, the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds from crime. This includes, inter alia, significant movement towards a harmonised implementation of certain critical provisions of the 1990 Convention concerning action at the domestic level as well as embodying agreement on practices designed to enhance the effectiveness of international cooperation. The European Union Council [[Directive (European Union)|Directive]] of June 1991 on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering was also substantially amended in December 2001. At the time, the Commission had presented a proposal for a Third Money Laundering Directive and a Regulation on control of cash entering or leaving the Community; these proposals were being discussed in the [[European Parliament]] and the [[Council of the European Union|Council of the EU]] and the Third EU AML Directive was adopted in 2005.

Other important initiatives that have taken place in recent years include the development and expansion of the [[Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units]], the adoption of the [[United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]], [[United Nations Convention against Corruption|Convention against Corruption]] and [[Terrorist Financing Convention]] as well as the emergence of international pressure through the imposition of counter-measures on "non-cooperative countries and territories", which were not in conformity with international standards.

===Drafting of the Warsaw Convention===
Discussion within the Council of Europe started as early as 1998 on the advisability of drafting an updating Protocol to the 1990 Convention and on the scope of such an exercise should it be undertaken. Given differences of view among member States, a questionnaire-based enquiry was conducted on the subject in 2000. It emerged from this enquiry that a clear majority of States were in support of an early opening of negotiations on a protocol. The Reflection Group on the advisability of drawing up an additional protocol to the Convention on laundering, search, seizure and confiscation of the proceeds from crime (PC-S-ML) submitted its report to the CDPC at its 51st plenary session on 17-21 June 2002 and made specific suggestions as to the possible content of such a treaty.

The European Committee on crime problems (CDPC) entrusted at the end of 2003, the Committee of experts on the revision of the Convention on laundering, search, seizure and confiscation of the proceeds from crime (PC-RM) to draw up such a protocol.

These terms of reference were revised in March 2004 and read as follows:
{| style="padding-left:7px; padding-bottom:7px; float:right; border:1px dashed #aaa; margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:1em;"
|-
| style="vertical-align:top; font-size:100%;"|
"Within the context of the negotiations of the draft Protocol, consideration should be given to the introduction of provisions concerning the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism:

a.   as regards ''preventive measures'', consideration should be given, for instance, to introducing a context-setting provision or provisions on measures of prevention to facilitate subsequent coverage of the treatment of the powers and duties of FIUs, particularly those dealing with the duty to control (identification and verification of the identity of clients, identification of beneficial owners, suspicious transactions’ reports), the definition of FIUs and the principles of co-operation between them, as well as transparency of legal entities. Such provision or provisions, if introduced, should make appropriate reference to existing international standards and, particularly, a reference to the FATF recommendations on money laundering and terrorist financing either in the Preamble to the Protocol or as a self-standing provision;

b.   as regards ''financing of terrorism'', consideration should be given to introducing one or several provisions ensuring the application of the provisions of the 1990 Money Laundering Convention to the fight against the financing of terrorism and which, while giving added value, are in full conformity with internationally accepted standards, including the UN International Convention on the suppression of the financing of terrorism;

c.   a mechanism should also be found to ensure that the Convention, as revised by the Protocol, could be adapted accordingly, should the internationally accepted standards referred to therein be changed."
|}

The PC-RM developed a text which both added to and modified provisions of the 1990 Convention. Owing to the extent of the modifications envisaged and the enlargement of the scope of the treaty to include issues concerning the financing of terrorism, the drafters felt that this text should be a self-standing Convention, rather than a Protocol to 1990 Convention. The CDPC approved this Convention on 11 March 2005 and transmitted it to the Committee of Ministers for adoption. The [[Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe|Committee of Ministers]] adopted this Convention on 3 May 2005.

==General considerations==

At the time of drafting, there was no single dedicated international treaty covering both the prevention and the control of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The existing legally binding international instruments provided for a range of specific measures which focused on law enforcement and international cooperation (e.g. criminalisation of money laundering, confiscation, provisional measures, international cooperation), but the preventative aspects were mostly left unregulated by international law or addressed in somewhat general terms.

Since the adoption of the 1990 Convention, money laundering techniques and anti-money laundering strategies had significantly evolved. For example, laundering techniques increasingly targeted the non-financial sector and used professional intermediaries to invest criminal proceeds in the legitimate economy. Many jurisdictions had set up [[Financial Intelligence|Financial Intelligence Units]] to process suspicious or unusual transaction reports and thus triggered more laundering investigations. Those changes needed to be followed up by reassessing the Convention's focus, adjusting some of its requirements and supplementing it with additional provisions. In addition, some of these changes had already been included in standards set by other international fora (European Union, [[United Nations]], FATF), which a new convention could not ignore. Rather, the text of the new Convention brought into line with these new developments to ensure mutual consistency with these standards and to make possible harmonised domestic responses in an appropriate legal format.

Owing to the efficiency shown in practice of anti-money laundering techniques to combat also the financing of terrorism, the Warsaw aimed to expand the scope of its predecessor in order to be used in the fight against terrorism and its financing, while taking into account existing international instruments (e.g. the 1999 UN Terrorist Financing Convention). The events of 11 September 2001 had forced countries around the globe to take quick action to freeze terrorist funds and it appeared that many of them had serious difficulties in coping with this requirement: some were unable to rapidly trace property or bank accounts; others had to stretch the limits of legality to respond to requests or provide the evidence requested. The world had realised that quick access to financial information or information on assets held by criminal organisations, including terrorist groups, was a key to successful preventive and repressive measures and for disrupting their activities.

The main reasons for including provisions concerning the financing of terrorism in the Warsaw Convention were the following:
:a. the clear link between the financing of terrorism and money laundering is internationally recognised, particularly in the context of the mandate of the FATF and its 40 + 9 Recommendations, the UN, the EU, the World Bank, the IMF and the mandate of MONEYVAL;
:b. the tools which have proved effective to counter money laundering should be equally effective in combating the financing of terrorism;
:c. the current co-operation between FIUs already covers, in practice, questions relating to the financing of terrorism;
:d. as this Convention includes provisions on the role and functioning of FIUs, it would have been difficult to de-couple questions relating to the financing of terrorism;
:e. information exchanged by FIUs is now used and may also be used in the future for the purposes of fighting the financing of terrorism.

The remit of CETS 198 is therefore wider than that of the 1990 Convention, as it covers laundering and confiscation, but also financing of terrorism. As to the latter, the Convention first stresses the necessity for States to take immediate steps to ratify and implement fully the 1999 UN Terrorist Financing Convention, thereby recognizing its fundamental value in defining an international legal framework to cut terrorists off from their funds. The reference to the UN Convention aims at stressing the crucial importance of this treaty in the global fight against the financing of terrorism. It recognises that the 1999 UN Terrorist Financing Convention provides, for the first time, an agreed global framework within which the international community can collaborate more effectively in seeking to fight the financing of terrorism.

Finally, the Warsaw Convention aimed to improve international co-operation, inter alia, by taking into account the development of new investigative techniques adopted in other international fora, as those contained in the EU Protocol of 16 October 2001 to the [[European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters]].

The Warsaw Convention brings added value to the current international standards in the following areas: 
* proof of the predicate offence;
* the mental element for the money laundering offence, which may be mere suspicion;
* the liability of legal persons;
* the lack of supervision or control by a natural person over a legal person;
* the definition of laundered property;
* confiscation of property;
* the reversibility of the burden of proof;
* management of frozen or seized property;
* the granting of supervisory and monitoring powers to non-banking financial institutions;
* international assistance and cooperation between FIUs;
* the postponement of suspicious transactions on request of  a foreign FIU. 

==Conference of the Parties==

To achieve all these objectives, the Warsaw Convention provides for a separate monitoring mechanism for States parties, the "Conference of the Parties" (COP198) which ensures that the provisions of CETS 198 are applied.

In order to lead its activities, and according to its Rules of Procedure, the Conference of the Parties elects a Bureau from among its Parties, for a period of two years, a President and Vice-President, as well as three other members, for the term of office of one year, who together constitute the Bureau. The Bureau assists the President and ensures the preparation and continuity of meetings. The Conference of the Parties may appoint scientific experts whose role is to provide neutral, experienced opinions where necessary and to assist the President and Secretariat in ensuring the consistency of the Conference's outputs. The Conference of the Parties is also assisted by a Secretariat provided by the Council of Europe.

At its first meeting, the COP agreed that it would not duplicate the assessments of MONEYVAL or the FATF, and therefore that it would only assess those parts of CETS 198 that add value to the current global standards. The assessment is undertaken by rapporteurs for legal, FIU and international co-operation issues, and is based on the replies by the assessed country to a detailed questionnaire. COP assessment reports are subject to discussion and approval by the Conference of the Parties, in accordance with its Rules of Procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CETS 198 Reference Documents, including Rules of Procedure|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/cop198/C198-COP_CompilationRefDocs_en.pdf|publisher=FATF web portal|format=PDF|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All adopted reports of the Conference of the Parties are automatically published within four weeks of adoption, together with any comments from the relevant Party.

The COP meets once a year at its plenary meeting. Its activities include and are not limited to: the discussion and adoption of assessment reports in respect of contracting Parties; progress made by States in signing/ratifying the CETS No. 198; and possible amendments to the Convention. 

The COP also liaises and cooperates with other anti-money laundering bodies, including MONEYVAL and the FATF.

==Participation==

===Modalities===
Under Article 49, CETS 198 was opened for signature by the member States of the Council of Europe, the European Community and non‑member States which had participated in its elaboration. Instruments of [[ratification]], acceptance or approval are deposited with the [[Secretary General of the Council of Europe]]. The Convention entered into force on the first day of the month following the expiration of a period of three months after the date on which 6 signatories, of which at least four are member States of the Council of Europe, expressed their consent to be bound by the Convention. Following the ratifications of [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Malta]], [[Moldova]], [[Poland]] and [[Romania]], the Convention entered into force on 1 May 2008. For Signatories subsequently expressing their consent to be bound by it, the Convention enters into force on the first day of the month following the expiration of a period of three months after the date of the expression of its consent to be bound by the Convention.

The European Union which was associated in the drafting of the Convention, signed this instrument on 2 April 2009. There is an ongoing dialogue between the Conference of the Parties to the Convention and the European Union concerning legal issues associated with the ratification of the Convention.

As from its entry into force, Parties to CETS 198, which are at the same time Parties to the 1990 Convention shall apply the provisions of this Convention in their mutual relationships; and shall continue to apply the provisions of the 1990 Convention in their relations with other Parties to the said Convention, but not to CETS 198. 

===Participation by Council of Europe members===
The Warsaw Convention has currently been ratified by 28 member States of the Council of Europe and signed but not ratified by another 11, plus the European Union.&lt;ref name="SignCETS198"&gt;{{cite web|title=Signatures and ratifications of CETS 198|url=http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=198&amp;CM=0&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG|publisher=Council of Europe Treaty Office web portal|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current Parties are:

&lt;/div&gt;

===Participation by non–Council of Europe members===

Since its entry into force in 2008, the Convention is also open for accession by other non-member States, provided that they have been formally invited to accede by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;In November 2012, the Committee of Ministers invited Morocco to accede to the Convention.&lt;/ref&gt; To date, no non-member state has signed or acceded to the Convention. Article 50, paragraph 1, of the Convention concerning the accession by non-member States reads as follows:

{{cquote|After the entry into force of this Convention, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, after consulting the Parties to the Convention, may invite any State not a member of the Council and not having participated in its elaboration to accede to this Convention, by a decision taken by the majority provided for in Article 20.d. of the Statute of the Council of Europe and by the unanimous vote of the representatives of the Parties entitled to sit on the Committee.}}

The procedure for the accession of a State which is not a member of the Council of Europe and which has not participated in the elaboration of the Convention may be summarised as follows.

In principle, the Committee of Ministers may take the initiative of inviting a non-member State to accede to a specific Convention. It is nevertheless customary for the non-member State to request accession in a letter addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe. The letter should be signed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs or a diplomatic representative acting upon instructions of his or her government.

In line with the constant practice of the Council of Europe and before formally inscribing the point on the agenda of the Committee of Ministers, the Secretariat informally ascertains the opinion among member States' delegations.

Requests for accession to a Council of Europe convention are examined by a Committee of Ministers’ rapporteur group and, then, by the Committee of Ministers. Once there is agreement in principle within the Committee of Ministers to give a positive reply to a request, the Committee of Ministers instructs the Secretariat (Treaty Office) to consult, where relevant, the other non-member States which are Parties to the Convention. The non-member States are given a precise time-limit for giving their consent, usually two months.

Following the consultation of the non-member States which are Parties to the Convention, the decision inviting the non-member State becomes definitive. In the case of the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime and on the Financing of Terrorism, the decision on whether or not to issue an invitation has to be unanimously agreed by those Council of Europe members which are Parties to the Convention. This decision is usually taken at the level of the Ministers’ Deputies. Then, an invitation to accede to the Convention is notified to the State concerned by the Secretariat General.

It is customary for the instrument of accession to be deposited at the seat of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, in the presence of a representative of the acceding State and of the Secretary General of the Council of Europe or his Deputy. The representative of the acceding State brings with him or her the instrument of accession and a procès-verbal of deposit is signed by both parties. Should it prove difficult for the acceding State to send a representative to Strasbourg, the instrument of accession may be sent by diplomatic courrier. Deposit of the instrument of accession is notified to the members of the Council of Europe and to the other Parties to the Convention.

Article 50, paragraph 2, of the Convention provides that it enters into force on the first day of the month following the expiration of a period of three months after the date of deposit of the instrument of accession with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe.

Subject to the applicable provisions of each convention and in line with the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, any declarations or reservations are to be made when depositing the instrument of accession. For reasons of legal certainty and in order to ensure the uniform implementation of Council of Europe’s conventions, reservations may not be made at any later date.

Article 33 of the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime and on the Financing of Terrorism provides for the designation of a central authority to be made imperatively at the time of deposit of the instrument of accession.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3539">'''Adam Podgórecki''' (1925–1998) is a sociologist and one of the founders of the [[Research Committee on Sociology of Law]]. Podgórecki was also one of the founders of the first institute at Warsaw University which was devoted to the social scientific studies of law. He moved to Carlton University in Ottawa, Canada, and took up a Chair in [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]], when the communists expelled him from his professorship for "anti-communist academic activities".&lt;ref name="Czarnota 2009"&gt;Czarnota 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; "He worked tirelessly and fearlessly" to ensure the independence of the [[sociology of law]] "against the pull of the large disciplines of [[sociology]] on the one side and [[law]] on the other" and became one of the pioneers of the [[sociology of law]] after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;See Adam Podgórecki Prize at http://www.isa-sociology.org/rc12_prize.htm .&lt;/ref&gt;

He carried out a systematic programme of socio-legal research throughout his academic life, wrote and published widely in both Polish and English and developed a unique socio-legal line of inquiry which can be traced back to Leon Petrazycki’s theory of “intuitive law”.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Podgórecki 1973 and 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Adam Czarnota, Podgórecki developed his social theory “in opposition to the Marxist theory of law and the state. He stressed the importance of empirical comparative material guided by theoretical hypothesis. Crucial for him was the typology, derived from Petrazycki,&lt;ref&gt;Leon Petrazycki's theory of law is discussed in the section on the [[sociology of law]].&lt;/ref&gt; of intuitive and official law”.&lt;ref name="Czarnota 2009"/&gt;

To honour the significant contribution made by Adam Podgórecki to the development of [[sociology of law]] and to shape the history of the [[Research Committee on Sociology of Law]], its board decided in 2004 to establish the annual Adam Podgórecki Prize. It is awarded for outstanding achievements in socio-legal research.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.isa-sociology.org/rc12_prize.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20705">The '''Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures''', also known as the '''SPS Agreement''', is an international [[treaty]] of the [[World Trade Organization]]. It was negotiated during the [[Uruguay Round]] of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]], and entered into force with the establishment of the WTO at the beginning of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy J. Miano, [http://www.kentlaw.edu/jicl/articles/spring2006/s2006_Timothy_Miano.pdf "Understanding and Applying International Infectious Disease Law: U.N. Regulations During an H5N1 Avian Flu Epidemic"] 6 Chi-Kent J. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. 26, 42-48 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly, the sanitary and phytosanitary ('SPS') measures covered by the agreement are those aimed at the protection of human, animal or plant life or health from certain risks.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Van den Bossche and Werner Zdouc, The Law and Policy of the World Trade Organization: Text, Cases and Materials (Cambridge University Press, 2013) 834.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the SPS agreement, the WTO sets constraints on member-states' policies relating to food safety (bacterial contaminants, pesticides, inspection and labelling) as well as animal and plant health (phytosanitation) with respect to imported pests and diseases. There are 3 standards organizations who set standards that WTO members should base their SPS methodologies on.  As provided for in Article 3, they are the Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex), World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the Secretariat of the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC).

The SPS agreement is closely linked to the [[Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade]], which was signed in the same year and has similar goals. The TBT Emerged from the Tokyo Round of WTO negotiations and was negotiated with the aim of ensuring non-discrimination in the adoption and implementation of technical regulations and standards.&lt;ref&gt;Kasturi Das, 'Coping with SPS Challenges in India: WTO and Beyond', (2008) 11(4) Journal of International Economic Law, 971-1019, 973-974, 973&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and framework==
As GATT's preliminary focus had been lowering tariffs, the framework that preceded the SPS Agreement was not adequately equipped to deal with the problems of non-tariff barriers (NTBs) to trade and the need for an independent agreement addressing this became critical.&lt;ref&gt;Das, 'Coping with SPS Challenges in India: WTO and Beyond',973-974.&lt;/ref&gt; The SPS Agreement is an ambitious attempt to deal with NTBs arising from cross-national differences in technical standards without diminishing governments prerogative to implement measures to guard against diseases and pests.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Buthe, 'The globalization of health and safety standards: delegation of regulatory authority in the SPS Agreement of the 1994 agreement establishing the World Trade Organization' (2008) 71(1) Law and Contemporary Problems, 219-255&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main provisions==
* Article 1 – General Provisions - Outlines the application of the Agreement.
* Annex A.1 – Definition of SPS measures.
* Article 2 – Basic Rights and Obligations. Article 2.2 - requires measures to be based on sufficient scientific analysis. Article 2.3 - states that Members shall ensure that their sanitary and phytosanitary measures do not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between Members where identical or similar conditions prevail, including between their own territory and that of other Members.  Sanitary and phytosanitary measures shall not be applied in a manner which would constitute a disguised restriction on international trade.
* Article 3 – Harmonization. Article 3.1- To harmonize sanitary and phytosanitary measures on as wide a basis as possible, Members shall base their sanitary or phytosanitary measures on international standards, guidelines or recommendations, where they exist, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, and in particular in paragraph 3. Article 3.3 – allows Members to implement SPS measures higher than if they were basing them on international standards where there is a scientific justification or the Member determines the measure to be appropriate in accordance with 5.1-5.8. 
* Annex A.3 – outlines the standard-setting bodies.
* Article 5 – Risk Assessment and Determination of the Appropriate Level of SPS Protection. Article 5.1 - Members shall ensure that their sanitary or phytosanitary measures are based on an assessment, as appropriate to the circumstances, of the risks to human, animal or plant life or health, taking into account risk assessment techniques developed by the relevant international organizations.
* Annex A.4 – outlines risk assessment process.
* Article 5.5 - each Member shall avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable distinctions in the levels it considers to be appropriate in different situations, if such distinctions result in discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade. Article 5.7– echoes the 'Precautionary Principle' where there is no science available with which to justify a measure.&lt;ref&gt;Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, opened for signature 15 April 1994, 1867 UNTS 3 (entered into force 1 January 1995) annex 1A ('Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures') at https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/sps_e/spsagr_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetically modified organisms==
In 2003, the United States challenged a number of [[European Union|EU]] laws restricting the importation of [[Genetically Modified Organism]]s (GMOs) in a dispute known as EC-Biotech,&lt;ref&gt;Panel Report, European Communities – Measures Affecting the Approval and Marketing of Biotech Products, WTO Doc WT/DS291, WT/DS292/R, WT/DS293/R (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; arguing they are "unjustifiable" and illegal under SPS agreement. In May 2006, the WTO's dispute resolution panel issued a complex ruling which took issue with some aspects of the EU's regulation of GMOs, but dismissed many of the claims made by the USA.  A summary of the decision can be found [http://www.oaklandinstitute.org/content/summary-conclusions-and-recommendations-wto-dispute-panel-interim-report-gmos here].

==Hormone-treated beef==
{{Main|Beef Hormone Dispute}}
Another prominent SPS case is the hormone-treated beef case. In 1996, the United States and Canada challenged before the [[WTO Dispute Settlement Body]] (DSB) a number of [[European Union|EU]] [[Directive (European Union)|directive]]s prohibiting the importation and sale of meat and meat products treated with certain [[growth hormone]]s. The complainants alleged that the EU directives violated, among other things, several provisions of the SPS Agreement. The EU contended that the presence of the banned hormones in food may present a risk to consumers' health and that, as a consequence, the directives were justified under several WTO provisions authorizing the adoption of trade-restrictive measures that are necessary to protect human health. In 1997 and 1998, the WTO adjudicating bodies admitted USA and Canada claims and invited the EU to bring the directives into conformity with WTO law before end of May 1999. EU did not comply and the DSB authorized the USA and Canada to take countermeasures against the EU. The countermeasures took the form of increased custom duties applied by the USA and Canada on certain EU products, including the notorious [[Roquefort]] cheese. In 2004, while the ban on hormone-treated meat was still in place, the EU initiated before the DSB new proceedings seeking the lifting of the countermeasures applied by the USA and Canada. EU alleged that it had collected new scientific data evidencing that the banned hormones may cause harm to consumers. According to the EU, the new scientific data provides sufficient ground for the ban on hormones, which may no more be sanctioned by the countermeasures imposed by the USA and Canada. As of January 2007, the proceedings initiated by the EU were still pending.

==Interaction with other World Trade Organization instruments==
While Article 1.5 of the TBT precludes the inclusion of SPS measures from its ambit, in EC-Biotech, the panel recognised that situations could arise where a measure is only partly an SPS measure, and in those cases, the SPS part of the measure will be considered under the SPS Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Baughen, International Trade and the Protection of the Environment (Routledge-Cavendish, 2007) 53.&lt;/ref&gt; If a measure conforms with SPS, under Article 2.4 of the SPS Agreement, it is assumed that the measure falls within the scope of GATT, Article XX(b).

==Criticism==
'''Economic considerations.''' Trade in the products subject to SPS-type measures have the potential to result in significant economic gains for national economies.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Arthur, 'An Economic Analysis of Quarantine: The Economics of Australia's Ban on New Zealand Apple Imports' (Paper presented at the New Zealand Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Conference, Nelson, August 24–25, 2006) 2&lt;/ref&gt; Favouring economic concerns over other important public health policy issues, however, is something that requires close scrutiny by governments and the international community.&lt;ref&gt;Markus Wagner, 'Law Talk v. Science Talk: The Languages of Law and Science in WTO Proceedings' (2011) 35 Fordham International Law Journal 151-200, 194-198&lt;/ref&gt;

The SPS Agreement reflects the [[precautionary principle]]&amp;nbsp;– a principle which allows them to act on the side of caution if there is no [[Scientific consensus#Uncertainty and scientific consensus in policy making|scientific certainty]] about potential threats to human health and the environment. Under Article 5.7 Members who enact provisional measures are obligated to seek further information on possible risks and review the measure 'within a reasonable period of time'. The Appellate Body in Japan– Measures Affecting Agricultural Products, stated that the length of a 'reasonable period of time' is to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;Appellate Body Report, Japan – Measures Affecting Agricultural Products, WTO Doc WT/DS76/R, 61 (October 27, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Under SPS rules, the burden of proof is on the complainant country to demonstrate that a measure violates Article 2.2 and Articles 5.1-5.8 before it can be regulated&lt;ref&gt;Simon Baughen, International Trade and the Protection of the Environment (Routledge-Cavendish, 2007) 54&lt;/ref&gt; even though scientific evidence can never be conclusive and it is not possible to test for all health risks that could arise from importation of a certain product.&lt;ref&gt;William Kerr and Jill Hobbs, 'Consumers, Cows and Carousels: Why the Dispute over Beef Hormones is Far More Important than its Commercial Value' in Nicholas Perdikis and Robert Read (eds), The WTO and the regulation of international trade : recent trade disputes between the European Union and the United States (Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2005) 193&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Impact on Developing Countries.''' It is important that the views of developing countries are incorporated into the standard-setting process as the effect of exporting countries enacting SPS measures can be damaging to developing economies. This is partly due to these states not possessing the technology and resources needed to readily comply with certain SPS requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Das, 'Coping with SPS Challenges in India: WTO and Beyond',973-974, 1006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Impact of Consumer Pressure on adherence to the SPS Agreement.''' Some commentators pose that the WTO's assumption that trade liberalisation enhances consumer welfare, has resulted in the SPS Agreement being ill-equipped to deal with trade restrictions put in place by governments responding to protectionist pressure from consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr and Hobbs, , 'Consumers, Cows and Carousels: Why the Dispute over Beef Hormones is Far More Important than its Commercial Value', 191-192.&lt;/ref&gt; This was most noticeable in the Beef Hormones Dispute where, although the science pointed to the relative safety of the growth hormones in question, European consumers pressured governments to ban the import of hormone-treated beef.&lt;ref&gt;Tracey Epps, 'Reconciling public opinion and WTO rules under the SPS Agreement' (2008) 7(2) World Trade Review, 359-392, 360&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''All-Russian Congress of Soviets''' was the supreme governing body of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] from 1917 until 1936, effectively. The [[1918 Russian Constitution|1918 Constitution of the Russian SFSR]] mandated that Congress shall convene at least twice a year, with the duties of defining (and amending) the principles of the [[Soviet]] Constitution and ratifying [[peace]] treaties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/russian/const/18cons02.html Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the RSFSR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerry F. Hough, Merle Fainsod, ''How the Soviet Union is Governed'', US: Harvard College, 1979, reprint, p. 50-51 61–63, 67–68, 73, 81–84.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[October Revolution]] ousted the provisional government, making the Congress of Soviets the sole, and supreme governing body. It is important to note that this Congress was not the same as the [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union]] which governed the whole [[Soviet Union]] after its creation in 1922.

For the earlier portion of its life, the Congress was a democratic body. Over Russia there were hundreds of [[Soviet (council)|soviets]], democratic local governing bodies in which the surrounding population could participate. The soviets elected the delegates to the Congress, and then in turn the Congress held the national authority, making the highest decisions. There were several political parties represented in the various sessions of the Congress, each of which fought for increasing their own influence in the soviets. However, as the [[Russian civil war|civil war]] progressed, the soviets' authority was progressively reduced, with the rise to power of Stalinism effectively cementing this situation&lt;ref&gt;Models of Democracy, David Held, p. 225. "Stalinism destroyed the possibility of a radical workers' democracy, installed briefly in the Soviet Union in October 1917 under Lenin's leadership"&lt;/ref&gt; and decisively turning the Congress into a rubber-stamp parliament. The Congress was formed of representatives of city councils (1 delegate per 25,000 voters) and the congresses of the provincial (oblast) and autonomous republican councils (1 deputy for every 125,000 inhabitants).

The exclusive jurisdiction of the Congress consisted of the election of the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]], adoption of the Constitution of the Russian SFSR and amendments to it, approval of amendments proposed by the central executive committee, and approval of the autonomous republics' constitutions. On the other issues, the Congress and the Central Executive Committee had the same authority. The Congress ceased to exist at the end of the constitutional reform of 1936–1937, when first on the [[Soviet Union|union]] and then at the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|republican]] levels [[indirect election]] to Soviets were replaced by [[direct election]]s at all levels with the [[Supreme Soviet]] as the highest body.

== History ==
===Origin of Soviets===
{{also|Soviet (council)}}
The first ''soviets'' appeared during the [[1905 Russian Revolution]] as councils (soviets) of workers in those cities that were captured by mass strikes ([[strike action]]).&lt;ref name=eohou&gt;Kulchytskyi, S. ''[http://resource.history.org.ua/cgi-bin/eiu/history.exe?Z21ID=&amp;I21DBN=EIU&amp;P21DBN=EIU&amp;S21STN=1&amp;S21REF=10&amp;S21FMT=eiu_all&amp;C21COM=S&amp;S21CNR=20&amp;S21P01=0&amp;S21P02=0&amp;S21P03=TRN=&amp;S21COLORTERMS=0&amp;S21STR=rady_robitnychykh_seljanskykh Soviets of workers', peasants', and soldiers' deputies of toilers, people's deputies (РАДИ РОБІТНИЧИХ, СЕЛЯНСЬКИХ І СОЛДАТСЬКИХ ДЕПУТАТІВ, ДЕПУТАТІВ ТРУДЯЩИХ, НАРОДНИХ ДЕПУТАТІВ)]''. Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine&lt;/ref&gt; Enterprises that were participating in those strikes had delegated to those councils their delegates to coordinate joint actions. In various locations those councils carried different names such as "Soviet of workers deputies", "Delegate assembly", "Assembly of deputies", "Commission of elected", and others.&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt; By October of 1905 the "Soviet of workers deputies" became more common.&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt; Following the example of Soviets of workers deputies in other locations were appearing Soviets of workers, sailors, and soldiers deputies, Soviets of workers and peasants deputies, Soviet of peasants deputies.

Originally, those soviets were mass political organizations.&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt;

For socialist parties the appearance of soviets was unexpected, yet each made an effort to delegate to them their representatives.&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt; [[Mensheviks]] and SRs view those soviets as strike committees or local authorities of self-government.&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt; [[Bolsheviks]] have seen in them the authority with help of which they could install in the country their dictatorship.&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt; In 1905 [[Vladimir Lenin]] noted that in political relation the Soviet of workers deputies should be viewed as kernel (germ) of provisional revolutionary government.&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt;

In 1917 [[Vladimir Lenin]] in his [[April theses]] came up with famous slogan "All power to the Soviets!".&lt;ref name=cssospitu/&gt; Following the [[February Revolution]], Lenin considered that in Russia existed [[Dual power (Russian Revolution)|dual power]] as interweaving of bourgeoisie power ([[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]]) and power of revolutionary masses (soviets).&lt;ref name=cssospitu/&gt; All other Russian political parties considered soviets as temporary public organizations and dual power did not exist for them as they were preparing for elections to the [[All-Russian Constituent Assembly]].&lt;ref name=cssospitu/&gt;

Embedment of Bolsheviks into the Soviets (Bolshevization of the Soviets) established the Communist-Soviet system of state power in the USSR which existed until the 1988 constitutional reform.&lt;ref name=cssospitu&gt;Kulchystskyi, S. ''[http://resource.history.org.ua/cgi-bin/eiu/history.exe?Z21ID=&amp;I21DBN=EIU&amp;P21DBN=EIU&amp;S21STN=1&amp;S21REF=10&amp;S21FMT=eiu_all&amp;C21COM=S&amp;S21CNR=20&amp;S21P01=0&amp;S21P02=0&amp;S21P03=TRN=&amp;S21COLORTERMS=0&amp;S21STR=Kompartiyno_rad_systema_derzh_vlady Communist-Soviet system of state power in the USSR: creation, basic stages of development, collapse (КОМПАРТІЙНО-РАДЯНСЬКА СИСТЕМА ДЕРЖАВНОЇ ВЛАДИ В СРСР: ТВОРЕННЯ, ОСНОВНІ ЕТАПИ РОЗВИТКУ, КРАХ)]''. Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[political regime]] that have joined in itself the dictatorship of the communist party and power of soviets (councils).&lt;ref name=cssospitu/&gt; Mechanism of such combination was theoretically designed by [[Vladimir Lenin]] and placed into practice by [[Bolshevik]] party.&lt;ref name=cssospitu/&gt; In communist-soviet system of power, the dictatorship of party ([[professional revolutionaries]]) was concealed by [[popular sovereignty]] (people's rule) of the soviets and therefore officially the political regime has been called the [[Soviet power]].&lt;ref name=cssospitu/&gt;

===Main meetings===
====Conference====
Following the [[February Revolution]], on 11-16 April 1917 in Petrograd took place the All-Russian conference of Soviets of workers and soldiers deputies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bse.sci-lib.com/article007119.html All-Russian conference of Soviets of workers and soldiers deputies (Всероссийское совещание Советов рабочих и солдатских депутатов)]. [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

At the conference participated 480 delegates out of 139 Soviets, 13 military garrisons of the Rear, 7 of regular army, and 26 separate parts of frontlines. 

On the agenda were 
* attitude towards the [[World War I|War]]
* attitude towards the [[Russian Provisional Government]]
* organizational issues
* organization of revolutionary forces
* preparation to the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]]

Majority was composed of [[Mensheviks]] and [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|SR]]s. The [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] group introduced own resolution drafts on key issues of agenda. 

In its resolution on war that was rather defensive, presented by Menshevik-SR [[Petrograd Soviet]] Executive Committee, the conference approved the declaration of the Provisional Government about the war (of 28 March) as if it abandoned aggressive goals. The Bolshevik group, on behalf of which [[Lev Kamenev]] had been speaking, took a wrong position by taking off own resolution draft and voting for the Menshevik-SR resolution after it was added with resolutions about "control and impact" of revolutionary democracy on the Provisional Government and its local authorities. Recognizing the need for a legislative establishment of 8 hour workday, the conference did not call the workers upon its immediate establishment by revolutionary means. On peasant and land issues, the conference adopted its resolution about support in the Constituent Assembly for gratuitous alienation from all privately owned lands and transferring them to working people, but spoke against "arbitrary resolution of land issue at local level", leaving, thus, the land in hands of landowners.

On 16 April 1917 the conference elected 10 delegates from oblasts and 6 from the Army and the Navy to the Petrograd Soviet Executive Committee turning it in this way in central authority of Soviets of the whole country until the First All-Russian Congress of Soviet workers and soldiers deputies. On 17 April 1917 at Bolshevik conference, the conference delegates, [[Vladimir Lenin]] made a report about war and revolution in which he outlined his [[April theses]]. The same day he repeated his report at a joint conference of Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, the conference delegates.

====First Congress====
The First All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers 'and Soldiers' Deputies (June 16 – July 7, 1917) was convened by the National Conference of the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Schapiro, ''The Origin of the Communist Autocracy: Political Opposition in the Soviet State First Phase 1917–1922'', Second Edition, New York: MacMillan Press, 1977, p. 41, 363.&lt;/ref&gt; It was dominated by pro-government parties ([[Socialist Revolutionary Party|Socialist-Revolutionaries]], etc.) and confirmed the supremacy of the [[Russian Provisional Government]].

There were 1090 delegates, 822 with a right to vote, representing 305 workers', soldiers' and peasant soviets, and 53 regional, provincial and district soviets. The breakdown of delegates by party was thus: 285 [[Socialist-Revolutionaries]], 248 [[Mensheviks]], 105 [[Bolsheviks]], 32 [[Menshevik Internationalists]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encspb.ru/object/2804022766?lc=en First All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies], Saint Petersburg Encyclopaedia.

Translated from the Russian, Edited by Stephan Apresyan and Jim Riordan.&lt;/ref&gt; The right to vote was given to these soviets containing at least 25,000 persons, and a voice was given to these containing from 10,000 to 25,000.

Following the overthrow of the Provisional Government of Russia in the [[October Revolution]], the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies (November 7–9, 1917) ratified the revolutionary transfer of state power.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Schapiro, ''The Origin of the Communist Autocracy: Political Opposition in the Soviet State First Phase 1917–1922'', Second Edition, New York: MacMillan Press, 1977, p. 54, 58, 64, 363.&lt;/ref&gt; 649 delegates were elected to the Congress, representing 318 local soviets; 390 were [[Bolsheviks]], about 100 [[left SR]]s, about 60 other [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|SRs]], 72 [[Mensheviks]], 14 United Socialist Democrat-Internationalists, 6 [[Menshevik Internationalists]] and 7 of other factions.&lt;ref name="encyc_2nd"&gt;[http://www.encspb.ru/object/2804022647?lc=en All-Russian Congress of Workers' and Soldiers' Soviet Deputies, Second]. A. M. Kulegin. Encyclopaedia of St. Petersburg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/glossary/events/a/arcs.htm All-Russian Congress of the Soviet], [[Marxist Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt; On the first day of the Congress, the [[Socialist Revolutionaries]] split into two groups – the Left Social Revolutionaries and the Right Social Revolutionaries. Also on the first day, the [[Menshevik]] delegation and Right [[Socialist Revolutionary]] deputies walked out in protest. 505 delegates voted in favour of the transfer of power to the Soviets. The [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] and [[Council of People's Commissars]] was elected by the Congress, naming [[Lenin]] the Chairman, and thus making him the head of government.&lt;ref name="encyc_2nd" /&gt; At the opening of the Congress, [[Vladimir Lenin]] gave a speech saying that the "Soviet government will propose an immediate democratic peace to all the nations and an immediate armistice on all fronts" and declared "Long live the revolution!," uttering what are sometimes called the "Land Decree" and "Decree on Peace."&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Lenin]], "[https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/oct/25-26/25b.htm To Workers, Soldiers, and Peasants]!"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Lenin]], "[https://archive.org/details/reportonpeace00leniuoft Report on peace; delivered at the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies], October 26 (November 8) 1917," [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Smele,''Historical Dictionary of the Russian Civil Wars, 1916–1926'', Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2015, p. xxii, 156, 287, 447, 591, 593, 848, 971, 1055, 1177.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Third Congress====
The Third All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies (January 23–31, 1918) was attended by delegates from 317 Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' with a further 110 delegates from army, corps and divisional committees.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Schapiro, ''The Origin of the Communist Autocracy: Political Opposition in the Soviet State First Phase 1917–1922'', Second Edition, New York: MacMillan Press, 1977, p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bolsheviks comprised 441 of the 707 delegates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prlib.ru/en-us/History/Pages/Item.aspx?itemid=804 The 3rd All-Russian Congress of Soviets completed its work], [[Yeltsin Presidential Library]], January 31, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt; On the fourth day January 13 (26), more delegates who had been at the Third All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Peasants' Deputies arrived. By the end there were 1,587 delegates.

The Congress had a Praesidium composed of ten Bolsheviks and three Left Socialist-Revolutionaries with a further delegate from each other group (Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, etc.).

The Swiss, Romanian, Swedish and Norwegian Social-Democratic parties, the British Socialist Party and the Socialist Party of America sent messages of solidarity.

Occurring shortly after the [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]] had been dissolved by order of the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] (VTsIK), the Congress resolved to expunge any references to the forthcoming Constituent Assembly from all new editions of decrees and laws of the Soviet Government.
The Congress received:
* [[Yakov Sverdlov]]'s report on the activity of the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]].
* [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s report on the activity of the [[Council of People's Commissars]].
* [[Joseph Stalin]]'s report from the [[People's Commissariat of Nationalities]] on the principles of federation and the nationalities' policy for the emerging Soviet state. The nationalities policy was agreed.

The Mensheviks, Right Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Menshevik internationalists used the Congress to indicate their opposition to the domestic and foreign policy which the Bolsheviks passed.

The ''Declaration of Rights of the Working and Exploited People'' was passed and this went on to become the basis of the Soviet Constitution. It was also agreed to establish the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] on the basis of a free union of the peoples of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Smele,''Historical Dictionary of the Russian Civil Wars, 1916–1926'', Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2015, p. 317-318.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Congress also approved the Decree on Land which provided the basic provisions of the redistribution and nationalization of land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marx2mao.com/Lenin/TCS18.html#en160 Third All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies (January 23–31, 1918)] accessed 2 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fourth Congress====
At the Fourth Extraordinary All-Russian Congress of Soviets (March 14–16, 1918), the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] was ratified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1918/mar/13.htm Extraordinary Fourth All-Russia Congress Of Soviets (March 14–16, 1918)] accessed 2 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Smele,''Historical Dictionary of the Russian Civil Wars, 1916–1926'', Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2015, p. xxvii, 227.&lt;/ref&gt; This marked a rift between the Bolsheviks and the [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]], who voted against the treaty and whose ministers quit the Sovnarkom in protest.&lt;ref&gt;Mawdsley, Evan. ''The Russian Civil War'' p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fifth Congress====
The Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers’ Peasants’, Soldiers’ and Red Army Deputies was held July 4–10, 1918. The [[Left SR Uprising]] broke out on during this Congress, with its suppression marked the end of Left SR participation in the Congress of Soviets, and a decree that "linked citizenship to military service and obliged all healthy men aged 18–40 years to come forward" and fight for the [[Red Army]] in the [[Russian Civil War]] was passed.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Smele,''Historical Dictionary of the Russian Civil Wars, 1916–1926'', Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2015, p. xxx, 39, 315, 670–671, 751.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 5th All-Russia Congress of Soviets of July 4, 1918, the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries had 352 delegates compared to 745 Bolsheviks out of 1132 total. The Left SRs raised disagreements on the suppression of rival parties, the death penalty, and mainly, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.

====Sixth Congress====
The Sixth Extraordinary All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers’, Peasants’, Cossacks’ and Red Army Deputies was held November 6–9, 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Smele,''Historical Dictionary of the Russian Civil Wars, 1916–1926'', Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2015, p. 933.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schapiro&gt;Leonard Schapiro, ''The Origin of the Communist Autocracy: Political Opposition in the Soviet State First Phase 1917–1922'', Second Edition, New York: MacMillan Press, 1977, p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Seventh Congress====
The Seventh All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers’, Peasants’, Cossacks’ and Red Army Deputies was held December 5–9, 1919.&lt;ref name=Schapiro&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; That year a report on the foreign policy of [[Soviet]] Russia was submitted to the Congress and [[Leon Trotsky]] read a report on [[Soviet]] military construction and fronts in the [[Russian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[British Socialist Party]], ''[http://contentdm.warwick.ac.uk/cdm/ref/collection/russian/id/6756 The foreign policy of Soviet Russia : report submitted by the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs to the Seventh All-Russian Congress of Soviets], Nov. 1918 to Dec. 1919,'' [[University of Warwick]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon Trotsky]], ''[https://archive.org/details/ourmilitaryconst00trotrich Our military construction and our fronts; report read at the 7th All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers, Peasants, Red Army and Labour Cossacks Deputies on the 7th of December 1919]'', Moscow: Executive Committee of the Communist International, 1920, [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eighth Congress====
Officially called the ''Eighth All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers’, Peasants’, Red Army and Cossack Deputies'' was held in Moscow on December 22–29, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Smele,''Historical Dictionary of the Russian Civil Wars, 1916–1926'', Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2015, p. xlv, 1295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schapiro&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this Congress that [[Gleb Krzhizhanovsky]] presented his report on the [[GOELRO plan]]. This was the first economic plan which focused on significant electrification of Russian industry. Lenin criticised [[Trotsky]]'s pamphlet, ''The Role and Tasks of the Trade Unions'' at the subsequent preliminary joint meeting of [[Bolshevik]] delegates.&lt;ref name=TUs&gt;{{cite web|last=Lenin|first=Vladimir|title=The Trade Unions, The Present Situation And Trotsky’s Mistakes|url=http://marxists.anu.edu.au/archive/lenin/works/1920/dec/30.htm|work=Lenin’s Collected Works, 1st English Edition, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1965, Volume 32, pages 19–42|publisher=Progress Publishers|accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2948">The ''Berlin Decree'' was issued in [[Berlin]] by [[Napoleon]] on November 21, 1806,&lt;ref name="Napoleon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Berlin Decree|url=http://www.napoleon.org/en/reading_room/articles/files/berlin_decree.asp|publisher=Napoleon|accessdate=2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the French success against [[Prussia]] at the [[Battle of Jena]] and in response to the British [[Order-in-Council]] of 16 May 1806, by which the Royal Navy instituted a blockade of all ports from [[Brest, France|Brest]] to the [[Elbe]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c_continental.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The decree proclaimed that "the British Isles are declared to be in a state of blockade", and forbade all correspondence or commerce with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c_continental.html&lt;/ref&gt; All British subjects found in French territory or that of France's allies were to be arrested as prisoners of war, and all British goods or merchandise seized. Any vessel found contravening the decree and landing in a continental port from a British or British-colonial port was to be treated as if it were British property and therefore liable to confiscation along with all its cargo.&lt;ref&gt;Https://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c continental.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of this so-called [[Continental System]] was to force Britain to the peace table by starving her of trade with Europe and thereby wrecking her economy. However, the Napoleonic blockade's effectiveness was difficult to enforce over so vast an area and was generally unpopular among French subjects and allies. Historian Paul Schroeder considers it to have proved an ineffective method of economic warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Paul W. Schroeder, ''The Transformation of European Politics 1763-1848'' (1994) pp 305-10&lt;/ref&gt;

The Continental System eventually led to economic ruin for France and its allies. Less damage was done to the economy of Britain, which had control of the Atlantic Ocean trade.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Grab, ''Napoleon and the Transformation of Europe'' (2003) pp 29-33&lt;/ref&gt;  Other European nations removed themselves from the Continental System, which led in part to the downfall of Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;Francois Crouzet, "Wars, blockade, and economic change in Europe, 1792-1815." ''Journal of Economic History'' (1964) 24#4 pp 567-588.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Milan decree]] for the same purpose was issued the following year.

'''Bootleg mining''' or '''shoemaker mining''' is [[illegal mining|illegal]] [[coal mining]].  

The term originated around the 1920s, though the practice probably predates that. Generally, a bootleg mine (sometimes called a '''Bootleg Pit''') is a small mine dug by a handful of men. Often this took place surreptitiously on land owned by somebody else, such as a [[coal company]].  They were frequently dug by coal miners off official tunnels in order to procure additional, free coal for themselves, a practice that causes additional ramifications when fighting [[mine fire]]s. Sometimes small pits are hidden under houses or outbuildings.  Usually, the mine is not large enough to turn around in. The pits are known for being unsafe, and often causing collapse.

The practice has died away in the United States; an American with simple equipment cannot dig enough coal in a day to reach a [[living wage]].  Bootleg mines in [[China]] are still very common, as are the fatalities resulting from unregulated mining.

==In Pennsylvania==
Shortly before the [[Great Depression]], Pennsylvania's [[anthracite]] industry collapsed, shutting down [[collieries]] and throwing tens of thousands of miners out of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bootleg Coal Rebellion|url=https://coalcorncountry.com/the-bootleg-coal-rebellion/|website=Coal, Corn &amp; Country|accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unemployed miners dug their own coalholes, often on company property, and began setting up bootleg breakers and trucking operations, creating an entire bootleg coal industry.  According to a 1938 report commissioned by Governor [[George Howard Earle]], there were as many as 1,965 bootleg holes, operated by over 7,000 bootleg miners, producing 2,400,000 tons of coal per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=textsReport of the Anthracite Coal Industry Commission. Harrisburg, July 30,1938|url=https://archive.org/details/reportofanthraci00penn|website=Archive.org|publisher=Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1941, miners and police clashed over the dynamiting of their coalholes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police Blow Up Bootleg Mine; 30 Hurt in Riot|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1941/10/18/page/1/article/police-blow-up-bootleg-mine-30-hurt-in-riot|accessdate=9 June 2017|publisher=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=17 October 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Brinkley Act''' is the popular name given to {{UnitedStatesCode|47|325(c)}} (originally section 325(b) of the [[Communications Act of 1934]]). This provision was enacted by the [[United States Congress]] to prohibit broadcasting studios in the U.S. from being connected by live telephone line or other means to a [[transmitter]] located in [[Mexico]].

Prior to [[World War II]], Dr. [[John R. Brinkley]] controlled a  high-power radio station, [[XERA-AM|XERA]], located in [[Ciudad Acuña]], [[Coahuila]] (Acuna City), on the U.S.-Mexican border, across the [[Rio Grande]] from [[Del Rio, Texas]].  The programs on Brinkley's stations originated from studios in the US, which were connected to his transmitters via international telephone lines.  Brinkley ran a popular but controversial program offering [[Quackery|questionable medical advice]] to his listeners. Since Brinkley's transmitters were licensed in Mexico, which at the time had very limited regulation of broadcast content, his broadcasting licenses could not be directly threatened by the US government.

Dr. Brinkley's activities at his studio were thought to be a local matter, outside Congress's regulatory powers.  However, the communications between the studio and his transmitters clearly involved international commerce and were therefore within Congress's power to regulate under the [[Commerce Clause]].  The operative language is as follows:

:''No person shall be permitted to locate, use, or maintain a radio broadcast studio or other place or apparatus from which or whereby sound waves are converted into electrical energy, or mechanical or physical reproduction of sound waves produced, and caused to be transmitted or delivered to a radio station in a foreign country for the purpose of being broadcast from any radio station there having a power output of sufficient intensity and/or being so located geographically that its emissions may be received consistently in the United States, without first obtaining a permit from the Commission upon proper application therefor.''

The law goes on ({{UnitedStatesCode|47|325(d)}}) to state that the legal process for requesting such a permit is the same as that for requesting or renewing a license for a domestic station.

Although the original purpose of the Brinkley Act was to shut down a broadcaster, such applications are today granted as a matter of course, and a number of US broadcasters are permitted to program Mexican stations from their US studios in communities such as [[San Diego]], [[California]] and [[Brownsville, Texas]], where as many as a third of the stations in each [[media market|radio market]] are licensed in Mexico.  In recent years the law has returned to prominence, as its provisions have been used to extend US ownership limits to Mexican stations leased by US broadcasters.

== Comparable legislation elsewhere ==
To prevent [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] from beaming a live signal from continental [[Europe]], which had originated in the [[London]] studios of the station, to the whole of the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of International Broadcasting|author=James Wood|ISBN=0-86341-302-1|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[General Post Office]] which had control of British telephones, enacted similar regulations. Consequently, Radio Luxembourg, like the Mexican border-blasters, had to either use studios at the station in the [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]], or record information in London on a [[transcription disc]] which could then be flown to Luxembourg for replay.

==Facts==
Under the [[feudal system]], the [[allegiance]] owed to a king by his subjects—connected as it was to the holding of interests in land—ruled out the possibility of any given individual holding land in two different kingdoms. Robert Calvin, born in Scotland around 1606, inherited estates in England, but his rights thereto were challenged on the grounds that, as a Scot, he could not legally own English land.&lt;ref&gt;Price (1997), pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As it happened, the child "Robert Calvin" was actually named James Colville; he was the son of Robert Colville, Master of Culross, and grandson of the courtier [[James Colville, 1st Lord Colville of Culross]]. 

==Judgment==
The [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]] ruled in Calvin's favour, finding that he was not an alien and did have the right to hold land in England.&lt;ref name=LibertyFund&gt;[http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/911#lf0462-01_head_084 Sir Edward Coke, ''The Selected Writings and Speeches of Sir Edward Coke'', ed. Steve Sheppard] (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2003). Vol. 1. 31 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not directly relevant to the case, [[Edward Coke]] used the occasion to discuss the position of "Perpetual enemies", specifying  "All Infidels are in Law perpetui inimici (perpetual enemies)" (166). Having accepted that a King who conquers a Christian Kingdom is constrained by the continuance of such laws as exist until new laws are put in place, he continues, however "if a Christian King should conquer a kingdom of an Infidel, and bring them under his subjection, there ''ipso facto'' the Laws of the Infidel are abrogated, for that they be not only against Christianity, but against the Law of God and of Nature." (170). [[Robert A. Williams, Jr.]] argues that Coke used this occasion to quietly provide a legal sanction for the [[London Virginia Company]] to dispense with affording Native Americans any rights as they settled in Virginia. In the Eendracht case, King Charles reconfigured the ruling for New England.&lt;ref name = Williams/&gt;

The test case went to a panel of 14 judges drawn from different courts. Two of those dissented: Sir Thomas Foster (1548–1612) and [[Thomas Walmsley (judge)|Sir Thomas Walmsley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Zaller|title=The Discourse of Legitimacy in Early Modern England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZGZ9AICgiiIC&amp;pg=PA321|accessdate=18 October 2012|date=14 May 2007|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-5504-7|page=321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=67449|title=Colville, James|first=Arthur H.|last=Williamson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Walmesley, Thomas|volume=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
===''Postnati'' and ''antenati''===
[[File:Nicholas Hilliard 020.jpg|thumb|right|120px|James, King of Scots, inherited the throne of England in 1603, uniting both kingdoms under a single monarch.]]
The decision in ''Calvin's Case'' hinged on Calvin's status as one of the ''postnati''—subjects born into the allegiance of the Scottish king James after he had become the [[king of England]] in 1603—and on the fact that the monarch into whose allegiance he was born (the same James, in his capacity as [[King of Scots]]) was also the English king at the time of Calvin's birth—meaning that Robert Calvin, in the judgement of the court, was just as much a subject of the king of England as if he had been born in England instead of Scotland. The judges of the court cited existing statutes—including particularly a 1351 statute, ''[[De Natis Ultra Mare]]'', which granted the benefits of subject status to foreign-born children of the king's subjects—as supporting the concept that allegiance was tied to the person of the king, rather than to the kingdom itself or to its laws.&lt;ref&gt;Price (1997), p. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Calvin's Case'' did not extend English subject status to the ''antenati'' (Scots born prior to 1603). They remained [[Alien (law)|alien]]s in relation to England, on the theory that King James had not yet become the king of England at the time of their birth.&lt;ref&gt;Price (1997), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts had been made in the [[English Parliament]], prior to ''Calvin's Case'', to naturalise all of James's Scottish subjects—both those born after his English accession in 1603 (the ''postnati''), and also those born before 1603 (the ''antenati'')—but these legislative efforts had been unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Price (1997), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns had been expressed that extending the privileges of English subjects to all Scots would cause England to be flooded by "an influx of 'hungry Scots'".&lt;ref&gt;Price (1997), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Objections were also raised that granting naturalisation to all the Scots would have encouraged the legal philosophy, espoused by James, of [[absolute monarchy]] and the [[divine right of kings]].&lt;ref&gt;Price (1997), pp. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt; Even after ''Calvin's Case'', the English Parliament could have enacted a naturalisation bill covering the ''antenati'', but it never did so.&lt;ref&gt;Price (1997), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15602">'''Card check''' (also called '''majority sign-up''') is a method for employees to organize into a [[trade union|labor union]] in which a majority of employees in a [[bargaining unit]] sign authorization forms, or "cards", stating they wish to be represented by the union. Since the [[National Labor Relations Act]] (NLRA) became law in 1935, card check has been an alternative to the [[National Labor Relations Board]]'s (NLRB) election process. Card check and election are both overseen by the National Labor Relations Board. The difference is that with card sign-up, employees sign authorization cards stating they want a union, the cards are submitted to the NLRB and if more than 50% of the employees submitted cards, the NLRB requires the employer to recognize the union. The NLRA election process is an additional step with the NLRB conducting a secret ballot election after authorization cards are submitted. In both cases the employer never sees the authorization cards or any information that would disclose how individual employees voted.

== Current and proposed law ==
The current method for workers to form a union in a particular workplace in the [[United States]] is a sign-up then an election process. In that, a petition or an authorization card with the signatures of at least 30% of the employees requesting a union is submitted to the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB), who then verifies and orders a secret ballot election. Two exceptions exist. If over 50% of the employees sign an authorization card requesting a union, the employer can voluntarily choose to waive the secret ballot election process and just recognize the union. The other exception is a last resort, which allows the NLRB to order an employer to recognize a union if over 50% have signed cards if the employer has engaged in unfair labor practices that make a fair election unlikely.

Under the proposed [[Employee Free Choice Act]] (EFCA),  if the NLRB verifies that over 50% of the employees signed authorization cards, the secret ballot election is bypassed and a union is automatically formed. Introduced in the [[U.S. Congress]] in 2005 and reintroduced in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|110|HR|800}}, [[110th United States Congress|2007 in 110th Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt; and 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|1409}}, [[111th United States Congress|introduced 3/10/2009 in 111th Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt; the EFCA provides that the NLRB would recognize the union's role as the official bargaining representative if a majority of employees have authorized that representation via card check, without requiring a secret ballot election.&lt;ref&gt;The 2007 bill was passed by the House on March 1, 2007. The act had majority support in the Senate, but was never voted on due to the threat of a Republican-led [[filibuster]].&lt;/ref&gt; Under the EFCA, if over 30% and fewer than 50% of employees sign a petition or authorization cards, the NLRB would still order a [[secret ballot]] election for union representation.

== History ==
Card check is not new. Since the [[National Labor Relations Act]] was passed, it has been legal for workers to form a union when a majority of employees in a bargaining unit sign cards indicating their intent to bargain collectively with the employer. According to a recent law review article, the [[National Labor Relations Board]] in its early days "certified on the record when there had been an agreement with the employer for card-check". It adds that "in the final year before the [[Taft-Hartley Act]] was passed [in 1947], 646 representation petitions were informally resolved through the card-check procedure".&lt;ref&gt;Joel Dillard and Jennifer Dillard, "Fetishizing the Electoral Process: The National Labor Relations Board's Problematic Embrace of Electoral Formalism", ''Seattle Journal for Social Justice'', spring/summer 2008, p. 833&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, [[United States Chief Justice|Chief Justice]] [[Earl Warren]] delivered the majority opinion for the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] that upheld the use of card check. Warren stated, "Almost from the inception of the [[National Labor Relations Act|Act]], then, it was recognized that a union did not have to be certified as the winner of a Board election to invoke a bargaining obligation; it could establish majority status by other means... by showing convincing support, for instance, by a union-called strike or strike vote, or, as here, by possession of cards signed by a majority of the employees authorizing the union to represent them for collective bargaining purposes." ''[[NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;395 U.S. 575, 596–597&lt;/ref&gt; (1969). The Supreme Court has consistently ruled in favor of card check, and Warren cited prior affirmations in ''NLRB v. Bradford Dyeing Assn.'',&lt;ref&gt;310 U.S. 318, 339–340&lt;/ref&gt; (1940); ''Franks Bros. Co. v. NLRB'',&lt;ref&gt;321 U.S. 702&lt;/ref&gt; (1944); ''United Mine Workers v. Arkansas Flooring Co.'',&lt;ref&gt;351 U.S. 62&lt;/ref&gt; (1956).

== Support ==

Supporters of card check argue that it makes it easier for workers to join unions. For example, in his remarks accompanying the introduction of the Employee Free Choice Act, Rep. [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]] (D-Calif.),  former chairman of the U.S. House [[Committee on Education and Labor]], described the limitations of the system of NLRB elections:

{{quote|The current process for forming unions is badly broken and so skewed in favor of those who oppose unions, that workers must literally risk their jobs in order to form a union. Although it is illegal, one-quarter of employers facing an organizing drive have been found to fire at least one worker who supports a union. In fact, employees who are active union supporters have a one-in-five chance of being fired for legal union activities. Sadly, many employers resort to spying, threats, intimidation, harassment and other illegal activity in their campaigns to oppose unions. The penalty for illegal activity, including firing workers for engaging in protected activity, is so weak that it does little to deter law breakers.

Even when employers don't break the law, the process itself stacks the deck against union supporters. The employer has all the power; they control the information workers can receive, can force workers to attend anti-union meetings during work hours, can require workers to meet with supervisors who deliver anti-union messages, and can even imply that the business will close if the union wins. Union supporters' access to employees, on the other hand, is heavily restricted.

The Employee Free Choice Act [with its provisions for majority sign-up] would add some fairness to the system…}}

[[Barack Obama]] supports the bill. An original co-sponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act, then-Sen. Obama urged his colleagues to pass the bill during a 2007 motion to proceed:

{{quote|I support this bill because in order to restore a sense of shared prosperity and security, we need to help working Americans exercise their right to organize under a fair and free process and bargain for their fair share of the wealth our country creates. The current process for organizing a workplace denies too many workers the ability to do so. The Employee Free Choice Act offers to make binding an alternative process under which a majority of employees can sign up to join a union. Currently, employers can choose to accept — but are not bound by law to accept — the signed decision of a majority of workers. That choice should be left up to workers and workers alone.}}

The [[AFL-CIO]] states the following in arguing that the company-controlled secret ballots actually make the process less democratic:

{{quote|People call the current National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election system a secret ballot election — but in fact it's not like any democratic election held anywhere else in our society. It's really a management-controlled election process because corporations have all the power. They control the information workers can receive and routinely poison the process by intimidating, harassing, coercing and even firing people who try to organize unions. No employee has free choice after being browbeaten by a supervisor to oppose the union or being told they may lose their job and livelihood if workers vote for the union.}}

== Opposition ==

Those who oppose card check argue it strips workers of their right to a secret ballot.  They also argue that even though gathering a majority of card signers might imply that a secret ballot would be unnecessary, signers could be coerced to sign through intimidation and pressure; the same could also be said of employers in the period between sign-up and a secret ballot.  Many business organizations, including The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, oppose the implementation of card check. From its website:

{{quote|Under the existing law today, workers have a chance to vote for or against unionization in a private-ballot election that is federally supervised. Under Card Check, if more than 50% of workers at a facility sign a card, the government would have to certify the union, and a private ballot election would be prohibited--even if workers want one. By forcing workers to sign a card in public - instead of vote in private - card check opens the door to intimidation and coercion. Over 70% of voters agree that a private election is better than card check.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uschamber.com/issues/index/labor/cardchecksecrbal.htm |title=The Employee Free Choice Act - the "Card Check" Bill |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305135111/http://www.uschamber.com/issues/index/labor/cardchecksecrbal.htm |archive-date=5 March 2009 |publisher=[[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The National Restaurant Association lists three points in opposition to card check on its website.

{{quote|1. A card-check process increases the risk of coercion. When a union tries to organize a workplace, employees sometimes face intimidation and pressure about how they should vote, from the union, management, or both. The best way to protect employees from coercion is through the continued use of a federally supervised, private-ballot process.

2. Private ballots are a basic American right.
The entire American system is based on respect for individual liberty and democracy. If Congress passes this proposal, they will strip away the protections that federally protected, democratic elections provide for American workers.

3. An employee’s decision to join a union should be made in private. Employees should not have to reveal to anyone -- employers or unions -- how they exercise their right to choose whether to organize with their co-workers in a union. Moving to a card-check process rather than a federally supervised election tramples on employee privacy. An employee’s decision to join a union should be made in private, protected from any coercion by unions, employers or co-workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.restaurant.org/government/Issues/Issue.cfm?Issue=cardcheck |title=Card-Check Legislation - Government &amp; Legal |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081126201902/http://www.restaurant.org/government/Issues/Issue.cfm?Issue=cardcheck |archive-date=26 November 2008 |publisher=[[National Restaurant Association]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[John Kline (politician)|Representative John Kline]], R-Minn., in explaining his opposition to the EFCA:

{{quote|It is beyond me how one can possibly claim that a system whereby everyone — your employer, your union organizer, and your co-workers — knows exactly how you vote on the issue of unionization gives an employee 'free choice' ... It seems pretty clear to me that the only way to ensure that a worker is 'free to choose' is to ensure that there's a private ballot, so that no one knows how you voted. I cannot fathom how we were about to sit there today and debate a proposal to take away a worker's democratic right to vote in a secret-ballot election and call it 'Employee Free Choice.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://republicans.edlabor.house.gov/PRArticle.aspx?NewsID=58 |title=Former Union Organizer Details Tactics of Manipulating Workers Just to Get a Majority on the Cards |accessdate=2007-02-19 |date=2007-02-08 |work=Press Release |publisher=Committee on Education and Labor (Minority)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Forbes commentator [[Brett Joshpe]] states his opposition to card check as such:

{{quote|Ending secret ballot elections, which first emerged in the U.S. during Reconstruction to protect recently freed slaves, will provide significant opportunity for voter intimidation and greatly strengthen the labor bloc during a time of historic economic vulnerability. In addition to depriving workers of the right to vote by secret ballot, the EFCA also would mandate binding arbitration in the event management and labor are unable to reach a collective bargaining agreement... The EFCA would leave the fate of businesses (and their workers) in the hands of a government-appointed panel and would essentially empower bureaucrats to mandate a deal that the free market would not produce. If that sounds benign, consider what companies will do when forced to absorb labor costs higher than the market rate and higher than they can afford. They certainly will not go hire more workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/01/07/efca-labor-economy-oped-cx_bj_0108joshpe.html | work=Forbes | first=Brett | last=Joshpe | title=Fighting Card Check -- And Winning | date=2009-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to a 2004 Zogby survey conducted for the Michigan-based [[Mackinac Center for Public Policy]], when asked if they wished to keep the current voting process or replace it with one "less private", 78% of union members support keeping the current secret ballot system to one "less private".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mackinac.org/6704 |title=Checking the Premises of "Card Check" |date=July 20, 2004 |publisher=Mackinac Center for Public Policy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As noted above, in both card check and NLRB secret elections, employers never see authorization cards or identifying information of how an employee voted, though in card check unions would see how an employee voted.

The '''Chair of the [[Council on Environmental Quality]]''' serves as the principal environmental policy adviser to the US President.  In addition, CEQ reports annually to the President on the state of the environment; oversees federal agency implementation of the [[environmental impact assessment]] process; and acts as a referee when agencies disagree over the adequacy of such assessments.  The Council coordinates federal environmental efforts and works closely with agencies and other White House offices in the development of environmental policies and initiatives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2948">A  '''complete contract''' is an important concept from [[contract theory]].

If the parties to an agreement could specify their respective rights and duties for every possible future state of the world, their contract would be complete.  There would be no gaps in the terms of the contract.

However, because it would be prohibitively expensive to write a complete contract, contracts in the real world are usually incomplete. When a dispute arises and the case falls into a gap in the contract, either the parties must engage in [[bargaining]] or the courts must step in and fill in the gap. The idea of a complete contract is closely related to the notion of [[default rule]]s, e.g. legal rules that will fill the gap in a contract in the absence of an agreed upon provision.

In economics, the field of [[contract theory]] can be subdivided into the theory of complete contracts and the theory of [[incomplete contracts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contract theory|last = Bolton|first = Patrick|publisher = MIT Press|year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Dewatripont|first2 = Matthias}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complete contracting theory is also called agency theory (or [[principal-agent theory]]) and closely related to (Bayesian) [[mechanism design]] and [[implementation theory]]. The two most important classes of models in complete contracting theory are [[adverse selection]] and [[moral hazard]] models. In this part of contract theory, every conceivable contractual arrangement between the contractual parties is allowed, provided it is feasible given the relevant technological and information constraints. In the presence of asymmetric information, the optimization problems can be handled due to the [[revelation principle]]. A leading textbook exposition of complete contract theory is Laffont and Martimort (2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The theory of incentives: The principal-agent model|last = Laffont|first = Jean-Jacques|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Martimort|first2 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, [[Incomplete contracts|incomplete contracting]] models consider situations in which only a restricted class of contracts is allowed, e.g. only simple ownership structures can be contractually specified in the [[Theory of the firm|Grossman-Hart-Moore theory of the firm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Firms, contracts, and financial structure.|last = Hart|first = Oliver|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9180">'''Contract management''' or '''contract administration''' is the management of contracts made with customers, vendors, partners, or employees. The personnel involved in contract administration required to negotiate, support and manage effective contracts are often expensive to train and retain. Contract management includes negotiating the terms and conditions in contracts and ensuring compliance with the terms and conditions, as well as documenting and agreeing on any changes or amendments that may arise during its implementation or execution. It can be summarized as the process of systematically and efficiently managing contract creation, execution, and analysis for the purpose of maximizing financial and operational performance and minimizing risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aberdeen.com/summary/report/other/BPinCM_092904a.asp |title=Best Practices in Contract Management: Strategies for Optimizing Business Relationships&lt; |accessdate=2008-07-10 |publisher=Aberdeen Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common commercial contracts include employment letters, sales [[invoice]]s, [[purchase order]]s, and utility [[contract]]s. Complex contracts are often necessary for [[construction]] projects, goods or services that are highly [[Compliance (regulation)|regulated]], goods or services with detailed technical specifications, [[intellectual property]] (IP) agreements, [[outsourcing]] and [[international trade]]. Most larger contracts require the effective use of [[contract management software]] to aid administration among multiple parties.

A study has found that for "42% of enterprises...the top driver for improvements in the management of contracts is the pressure to better assess and mitigate risks" and additionally,"nearly 65% of enterprises report that [[contract lifecycle management]] (CLM) has improved exposure to financial and legal risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_pwwi/is_200705/ai_n19058810 |title=Contract Management: Optimizing Revenues and Capturing Savings |accessdate=2008-07-10 |date=May 2007 |publisher=Aberdeen Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contracts==
A [[contract]] is a written or oral legally-binding agreement between the parties identified in the agreement to fulfill the terms and conditions outlined in the agreement. A prerequisite requirement for the enforcement of a contract, amongst other things, is the condition that the parties to the contract accept the terms of the claimed contract. Historically, this was most commonly achieved through signature or performance, but in many jurisdictions - especially with the advance of electronic commerce - the forms of acceptance have expanded to include various forms of electronic signature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/contract |title=Contracts&lt; |accessdate=2015-07-22 |publisher=Cornell University Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contracts can be of many types, e.g. sales contracts (including leases), purchasing contracts, [[partnership agreement]]s, [[trade agreement]]s, and intellectual property agreements.

*A sales contract is a contract between a company (the seller) and a [[customer]] where the company agrees to sell products and/or services and the customer in return is obligated to pay for the product/services bought.
*A purchasing contract is a contract between a company (the buyer) and a supplier who is promising to sell products and/or services within agreed terms and conditions. The company (buyer) in return is obligated to acknowledge the goods / or service and pay for liability created. 
*A partnership agreement may be a contract which formally establishes the terms of a partnership between two legal entities such that they regard each other as 'partners' in a commercial arrangement. However, such expressions may also be merely a means to reflect the desire of the contracting parties to act 'as if' both are in a partnership with common goals.  Therefore, it might not be the [[common law]] arrangement of a partnership which by definition creates fiduciary duties and which also has 'joint and several' liabilities.

==Areas of contract management==
The business-standard contract management model, as employed by many organizations in the [[United States]], typically exercises purview over the following business disciplines: 
*Authorizing and negotiation
*Baseline management
*Commitment management
*Communication management.
*Contract visibility and awareness
*[[Document management]]
*Growth (for Sales-side contracts)
*Contract compliance/[[governance]]

==Change management==
There may be occasions where what is agreed in a contract needs to be changed later on. A number of bases may be used to support a subsequent change, so that the whole contract remains enforceable under the new arrangement.

A change may be based on: 
*A mutual agreement of both parties to vary the contract, outside the framework of the existing contract. This would be an independent basis for changing the contract.
*A unilateral decision to vary the contract, contemplated and allowed for by the existing contract. This would normally have notice periods for fairness and often the right of the other, especially in consumer contracts, to cease the contractual relationship.  Be careful that any one-way imposition of change is contractually justified, otherwise it may be interpreted as a repudiation of the original contract, enabling the other party to terminate the contract and seek damages.
*A bilateral decision to vary the contracting, within the variation or change control process outlined in the existing contract. These are often called change control provisions.

==Phases of contract management==

Contract management can be divided into three phases &lt;ref&gt;Contract &amp; Commercial Management - The Operational Guide, Van Haren Publishing, October 2011, {{ISBN|978 90 8753 627 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely

* pre- contract phase
* contract execution phase
* post award phase (often referred to as contract compliance/governance)

==Contract compliance/governance==
{{See also|Relational contract}}
During the post-award phase, it is important to ensure that contract conditions and terms are met, but it is also critical to take a closer look for items such as unrecorded liabilities, under-reported revenue or overpayments. If these items are overlooked, margin may be negatively impacted. A contract compliance audit will often commence with an opportunity review to identify the highest risk areas.  Having a dedicated contract compliance (and/or governance) program in place has been shown to result in a typical recovery of 2-4% and sometimes as high as 20%.&lt;ref&gt;"California Energy Commission:2008 Energy Efficiency Standards"|http://www.energy.ca.gov/2008publications/CEC-400-2008-016/CEC-400-2008-016-CMF-REV1.PDF|accessdate=2016-08-16}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current thinking about contract management in complex relationships is shifting from a compliance “management” to a “[[governance]]” perspective, with the focus on creating a governance structure in which the parties have a vested interest in managing what are often highly complex contractual arrangements in a more collaborative, aligned, flexible, and credible way.
In 1979, Nobel laureate Oliver Williamson wrote that the governance structure is the “framework within which the integrity of a transaction is decided.” He further added that “because contracts are varied and complex, governance structures vary with the nature of the transaction.”  &lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Oliver E.|1979|"Transaction-Cost Economics: The Governance of Contractual Relations,"|Journal of Law and Economics: Vol. 22: No. 2, Article 3|accessible at: http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/jle/vol22/iss2/3&lt;/ref&gt;

A collaborative governance framework has four components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vitasek|first=Kate|display-authors=etal|title=The Vested Outsourcing Manual|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=0230112684|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*A relationship management structure (how the parties work together to make both day-to-day operational decisions as well as strategic decisions)
*A joint performance and transformation management process designed to track the overall performance of the partnership
*An exit management plan as a controlling mechanism to encourage the organizations to make ethical, proactive changes for the mutual benefit of all the parties. 
*Compliance to special concerns and regulations, which include the more traditional components of contract compliance

'''''Copyright Criminals''''' is a 2009 [[documentary film]] directed and produced by [[Benjamin Franzen]] examining the creative and the commercial value of [[Sampling (music)|sampling]]  including the related debates over artistic expression, [[copyright]] law, and money.

''Copyright Criminals'' was funded by the [[Ford Foundation]], [[University of Iowa]] and [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]]. It premiered in 2009 at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/underwire/2010/01/copyright-criminals/ Scott Thill article in ''Wired'': Copyright Criminals Charts Hip-Hop’s Cultural, Legal Influence]&lt;/ref&gt; It was broadcast nationally in the [[United States]] on 18 January 2010 on [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) on the documentary series ''[[Independent Lens]]''.

Sampling is when musicians make an audio montage taking a portion, or sample, of a sound recording and reusing, remixing or reworking it as a separate instrumental layer or loop into another song.  It is popular with [[hip hop music|hip hop]] musicians.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  The documentary contains interviews with several sampling artist pioneers, including hip-hop groups. A longtime area of contention from a legal perspective, early sampling used portions of other artists' recordings without permission. Once hip-hop, rap and other music incorporating sampling began generating a noticeably substantial income, the original artists began to take legal action, claiming [[copyright]] infringement and demanding high-sum royalties. Sampling artists fought back, claiming [[fair use]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thonline.com/article.cfm?id=270701 Megan Close article in ''Dubuque Telegraph Herald'': Sample Says: Dubuque native Benjamin Franzen's new PBS documentary ]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary took five years to finish (2004–2009). It is the debut film for Franzen, a graduate of [[University of Iowa]] and founder of Atlanta-based production company Changing Images, and [[Kembrew McLeod]], a professor specializing in [[copyright law]] at University of Iowa.

# plastic works, maps and drawings in the field of topography, geography and science in general.

== Copyright formalities ==
In Romania, there is no requirement for a [[copyright notice]] in order to obtain copyright protection, as original works are automatically protected by copyright as of their creation. However, the author and other copyright holders are entitled to place on their works a copyright notice consisting of the letter C in a circle together with their name, and the place and year of the first publication. In cases where such a copyright notice is displayed, there is a presumption that the work is copyright protected in favour of the person using the copyright notice, until otherwise proven.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Duration of copyright protection ==
Duration of copyright protection is defined by chapter V (Object of copyright) of the Law No. 8/1996 on authors rights and related rights&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. The general rule is that the patrimonial rights of the author last for seventy (70) years after his or her death. If there are no heirs, the exercise of these rights rests with the collective management body mandated during the lifetime by the author or, in the absence of a mandate, by the collective management body with the largest number of members in the field of creation.

== Copyright infringement ==
Holders of copyright or related rights can file for infringement when there is:

* Unauthorised use of their works (by reproduction, distribution, loan, lease, communication to the public (including making available), importation, broadcasting, retransmission by cable networks or by making derivative works).
* Infringement of moral rights (first publication, attribution, right to choose name for publication, right to maintain integrity of the work, and right to retract the work).
* Infringement of the droit de suite (right to equitable remuneration).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Courthouses in New South Wales''' were designed by the [[New South Wales Government Architect|Colonial Architect, later known as the Government Architect]].

==History of New South Wales Local Courts==
The first New South Welsh Charter of Justice of 2 April 1787 created the power to convene a criminal court. This was the [[Court of Criminal Jurisdiction]]. The first Charter of Justice also created a [[Court of Civil Jurisdiction]] to hear and determine in a summary way all pleas relating to real and personal property, debts, contracts, grant of probates and to administer intestate estates.  Magistrates appointed in the early years of the colony were unpaid honorary appointments. The first paid magistrate was [[D'Arcy Wentworth]] appointed in 1810.&lt;ref name="lawlinkhistory"&gt;{{cite web

Local Courts were known as Courts of Petty Sessions.  Such courts had originated in England in the fourteenth century. Although during the early years of the colony references are made to Courts of Petty Session sittings by Magistrates, it was not until 1832 that Courts of Petty Sessions were formally established in New South Wales.&lt;ref name = "lawlinkhistory"/&gt;

The first Courts of Petty Sessions were proclaimed in the Government Gazette of 3 October 1832. The proclamations gave notice that Courts of Petty Sessions were to be held at the following locations: Sydney (Police Office and [[Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney|Hyde Park Barracks]]), Inverary, 
Parramatta, Bathurst, [[Windsor, New South Wales|Windsor]], Newcastle, Penrith, Paterson's Plains, Liverpool, Maitland, Campbelltown, Darlington, Wollongong, Invermein, Stonequarry Creek, Port Stephens, Bong Bong or Berrima, Port Macquarie, Goulburn Plains.&lt;ref name = "lawlinkhistory"/&gt;

More than three hundred courthouses have been built in New South Wales since settlement. The oldest existing Local Court in New South Wales is the Local Court at Windsor which was built in 1821.&lt;ref name = "lawlinkhistory"/&gt;

In 1985 the Local Courts Act abolished Courts of Petty Sessions by changing their name to Local Courts and appointments are now made under that Act. There are currently 160 [[Local Court of New South Wales|Local Courts]] established throughout New South Wales and 130 Magistrates appointed.&lt;ref name = "lawlinkhistory"/&gt;

* civil matters with a monetary value of up to $60,000
* committal hearings
* family law matters
* child care proceedings
* juvenile prosecutions and care matters
* coronial inquiries
* industrial matters
* mining matters

Local Courts also provide the following services:&lt;ref name="policensw"/&gt;

*Court Registries administer the sittings of the Local Court and provide registry services to the Court's clients.
*The Chamber Magistrate provides information about legal options and court proceedings, but cannot represent people appearing before the Court. In smaller Courts, the Chamber Magistrate service is often provided by the Clerk of the Court.
*Coroners hold inquests into deaths and inquiries into fires. Outside the metropolitan area, most Clerks of the Local Court are appointed as Coroners for the State. Within the metropolitan area, appointed coroners sit at the [[Coroner's Court of New South Wales]] in [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]].
*Marriage Celebrant: Clerks of the Local Court at most country registries (and some larger metropolitan registries) are authorised to perform marriages.
*Licensing: Most major country and outer metropolitan registries process applications for and issue certain licences such as a liquor licence or commercial agents licence.

==Partial list of courthouse buildings of New South Wales==
The following courthouses are located in New South Wales, with the [[New South Wales Government Architect|Colonial Architect]] [[James Barnet]] and his office responsible for designing and building 130 courthouses across the state. Some of the courthouses designed by Barnet replaced existing courthouses where it was deemed the building had been outgrown:

While small additions have been made to the rear of the building, the front remains relatively unchanged from Dawson's original design and is a rare example of his work. Albury Courthouse has been associated with the provision of law and justice in the town and broader region since 1860 and was the third courthouse built in the town. The scale and quality of Albury Courthouse demonstrates the confidence in the growing importance of the town as major port along the [[Murray River]] during the nineteenth century. Albury Courthouse forms an important element of Albury's civic centre and contributes to the streetscape of Dean Street. It was built out of local grey granite by Thomas Allen of Albury. In the press gallery there has been a tradition of journalists to carve their names. The first Clerk of Petty Sessions was John Roper, who had been a member of  [[Ludwig Leichhardt|Leichhardt]]'s 1844 expedition. || &lt;ref&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|3080002|Albury Courthouse|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |year=2005 |url=http://www.alburycity.nsw.gov.au/city/history/heritage_trail.htm |title=Albury Heritage Trail |work= |publisher=City of Albury |accessdate=2006-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819043844/http://www.alburycity.nsw.gov.au/city/history/heritage_trail.htm |archivedate=2006-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building has aesthetic significance as a fine and largely intact example of an early twentieth century building in the Federation Free Style, and as the only courthouse in the city constructed in this style. The building makes an important contribution to the character of the immediate area, and with its small town scale blends well with the older buildings in the complex. The building has historic and social significance as part of the site. The site is significant as the location chosen for Macquarie's first Georgian Public School which was modified during construction to accommodate the Supreme Court. Representative of the style as used in a courthouse building and the quality of the interior detailing is representative of the importance given to judicial buildings at the turn of the century. ||&lt;ref&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5011940|Banco Road Court, Sydney Supreme Court House|fn=S95/00338/1|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AHD|1902|Banco Court Building|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sydneylivingmuseums.com.au/sydneyopen/2017/st-james-road-banco-court |title=St James Road Banco Court |work=Sydney Living Museums |publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]] |date=2017|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| {{NSWcity|Batemans Bay}} || [[Federation Queen Anne]]  || align=center|1905 || Vernon || [[Image:Batemans Bay Courthouse.jpg|100px]] || ''Local'' || The first Batemans Bay Courthouse and Police Residence was opened in 1885 opposite the waterfront in Clyde Street. The building was gutted by fire in October 1903. The second Courthouse was built on the corner of Orient and Church Streets (now Beach Road), where the current police station now stands.  It now houses the Old Courthouse Museum. It was constructed of hardwood weatherboard and roofed with galvanised iron.  Local cedar was used for the door frames and mantelpieces. Built at a cost of £930 it was opened on 14 October 1905. The Complex is now operated by the Batemans Bay Historical Society as a museum. Although moved from its prominent location in the civic centre, the former Court House and Police Station retains its high-level local historic significance for its role in establishing police operations and the administration of justice in Batemans Bay. It is also of significance for the continuity of a single process for just over 100 years. The building has local aesthetic significance for having been designed by eminent Vernon and for its characteristic domestic style, unusual for a building of its type and function in the local Batemans Bay area. Some of the aesthetic significance of the building has been reduced with the loss of its tall chimneys, a characteristic of the Queen Anne style. It is of local social significance for its local area identification with the provision of law and order in Batemans Bay from the late 19th century. Scientifically, it has local significance for its potential to contribute to an understanding of the changes in the administration of law and order and of the lifestyle of police officers form the late 19th to late 20th centuries. || &lt;ref&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|1550002|Courthouse, Police Station and Police Residence (Former)|fn=88.0018.B &amp; D|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first quarter sessions were held at the courthouse in 1841. In 1843, the first [[Jury trial|trial by jury]] in the Colony of New South Wales was held here. The assize courts were only continued for seven years. In 1850 the district court moved to [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]]. Minor courts continued at Berrima until 1873. Notable trials were of John Lynch who was hung for the murder of at least nine people, and of Lucretia Dunkley and her lover, Martin Beach, who were both were hanged in 1843 for the murder of Dunkley’s husband. Dunkley was the only woman hanged at [[Berrima Correctional Centre|Berrima gaol]]. || &lt;ref&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|2680108|Berrima Court House|date=16 June 2010|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RDBHAT2ndEd"&gt;{{cite book |author= |authorlink=  |year=1998 |title=Reader’s Digest book of Historic Australian Towns |chapter= |editor=Irving, Robert |others= |edition=2nd |pages=56, 58 | publisher = Reader’s Digest (Australia) |location=Surry Hills, NSW, Australia |isbn=0-86449-271-5 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building is a fine and intact example of a classically inspired public building designed in the Federation Free Classical style by Barnet, with construction supervised by Vernon. The building is an example of a Court that operated in association with a Police Station and significantly has continued to operate with attached Holding Cells complex to present day. The Central Local Courthouse and holding Cells are good examples of late nineteenth century Courthouse and prison environment that despite alterations and modification demonstrate certain design philosophies and standards of that time. The form and relationship of the Holding Cells are functional and reflect Barnet’s preference to relate each building to its site and context. The design of the Courthouse and its principle façade connotes typical characteristics of this type of building. The buildings remain as a good and intact example of a Courthouse and associated facilities designed by the Colonial Architects Office and that demonstrate the growing affluence and prosperity of the time. Central Local Courts and Holding Cells are of social significance for their on-going association with the police, Attorney-General’s Department, Department of Corrective Services, NSW Sherriff’s office and all associated parties who have used the building for over 100 years. The building significantly continues to operate and is part of a network of Courts in the local area. ||&lt;ref&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5045635|Sydney Central Local Court House|fn=S90/01485/1|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AHD|2194|Central Police Courts|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building is one of the finest examples of courthouses designed by Barnet and displays the principal characteristics of his standard courthouse plan built on a grand scale. The courthouse features a grand projecting rusticated arched entrance and a finely detailed double-height court room with a coffered ceiling. The courthouse is set back from the street in formal landscaped grounds. Cooma Courthouse has been in continuous use for over 120 years, with only minor alterations since its construction. The grandeur and quality of Cooma Courthouse demonstrates the importance of the town as a regional centre and is symbolic of the growing confidence in regional centres during the nineteenth century due to expansions in mining and agriculture. A gaol was also established in the Cooma in 1873. It has shuttered French windows and a front verandah. || &lt;ref&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|3080044|Cooma Courthouse|date=6 August 2010|accessdate=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |year=2004 |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/New-South-Wales/Cooma/2005/02/17/1108500193375.html |title=Cooma |work=Sydney Morning Herald Travel |accessdate=2006-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The laying of the foundation stone for the courthouse was a major event, attended by the Premier at the time, JS Farrell, as well as the Minister for Public Works, J Sulterland and the Attorney General JS Foster. The size and extravagance of the courthouse demonstrates the wealth and importance of Yass during the nineteenth century. Yass Courthouse in an impressive example of the Victorian Free Classical style and an outstanding, representative example of courthouses designed by Barnet. The courthouse, which is located on a prominent corner site, is a landmark building in Yass. A court of petty sessions was first established in Yass in 1836. || &lt;ref&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|3080136|Yass Courthouse and Grounds|date=19 October 10|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |year=1997 |url=http://www.arts.monash.edu.au/ncas/multimedia/gazetteer/list/yass.html |title=Yass, New South Wales |work=Australian Places |publisher=Monash University |accessdate=2006-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060826000229/http://www.arts.monash.edu.au/ncas/multimedia/gazetteer/list/yass.html |archivedate=26 August 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is likely to comprise evidence of permanent structures, including court house, commandants house and cell blocks and associated auxiliary buildings created as permanent structures from 1835 onwards, as well as evidence of a variety of earlier temporary structures dating from the early 19th Century.

The courthouse was built during the period of Young's consolidation following the town's initial history as a leading goldfield. Also, the building is associated with the hectic period of Public Works Department construction activity during the 1870s and 1880s when courthouses were often impressive structures built sometimes without adequate regard for the communities concerned.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3492">[[File:Urthinflur.JPG|200px|thumb|An earthen floor]]

An '''earthen floor''', also called an [[adobe]] floor, is a floor made of dirt, raw earth, or other unworked ground materials.  It is usually constructed, in modern times, with a mixture of [[sand]], finely chopped [[straw]] and [[clay]], mixed to a thickened consistency and spread with a trowel on a sub-surface such as [[concrete]]. Once dry, it is then usually saturated with several treatments of a [[drying oil]].

==Benefits==

* Variety of colors, textures, and materials
* Can be installed over nearly any [[Floor#Ground floor construction|subfloor]]ing
* Integrates well with in-floor radiant heat tubing
* One of the cheapest flooring methods, [[Environmentalism|green]] or otherwise

==History==
Earthen floors were predominant in most houses until the mid 14th century in Europe, and persist to this day in many parts of the world.&lt;ref name="foo"&gt;[[Frances Gies and Joseph Gies|Gies, Frances &amp; Gies, Joseph]], Life in a Medieval Village&lt;/ref&gt;  In medieval times, almost all peasant housing had earthen floors, usually of hardpacked dirt topped off with a thin layer of straw for warmth and comfort. 
Soil in the southwestern parts of the US contains nearly a perfectly mixed ratio of adobe.

In China, most cottages and smaller houses also had earthen floors, made of [[rammed earth]] and sealed with raw linseed.&lt;ref name="foo2"&gt;Mitsu,Ahn , Developments in History: China&lt;/ref&gt;

Earthen floors were used in ancient Greece,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McAllister|first=Marian Holland|author2=Bradley A. Ault|title=The Excavations at Ancient Halieis: The Houses: The Organization and Use of Domestic Space|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2005|isbn=0-253-34710-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGwIb2uEIbIC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=Earthen+floor&amp;ei=QQ_-SJm7O4uWyATm3cWiDw&amp;client=firefox-a|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in many other countries in ancient times.

Earthen floors, along with stone and sometimes wood, were used as [[threshing floor]]s.

==Construction==

In modern times, most earthen floors are often laid over the top of a subfloor of tamped gravel or cob or adobe, and then a mixture of clay, sand and fiber are mixed and leveled onto the subfloor. The finished layer can be 1/2 to 2 inches thick, and once dry is sealed with a drying oil (like [[linseed oil]]). Earthen floors can be laid over the top of previously installed wood floors but weight can become an issue.

==Finishing==
A drying oil like linseed oil is usually used to seal the floor and protect it from wear and tear. A final coat of a wax sealing finish ([[perilla oil]] or floor wax) can be used to increase durability and lustre.

The Edict implicitly granted Christianity the status of "[[religio licita]]", a worship recognized and accepted by the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Arnaldo |last=Marcone |title=Pagano e cristiano. Vita e mito di Costantino |year=2002 |page=57 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=Y1JoAAAAMAAJ |publisher=GLF editori Laterza |isbn=9788842065951}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first edict legalizing Christianity, preceding the [[Edict of Milan]] by two years.

==History==

On February 23, 303, on the [[Terminalia]] feast, Emperor [[Diocletian]], by proposal of Galerius, issued a persecutory [[edict]]. The edict prescribed:
* Destroying of churches and burning of the [[Holy Scriptures]];
* Confiscation of church property;
* Banning Christians from undertaking collective legal action;
* Loss of privileges for Christians of high rank who refused to recant;
* The arrest of some state officials.

At that time, Galerius held the position of [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] of the Roman Empire, the second most important position after the Emperors.

In 305 Diocletian abdicated; Galerius, his successor, continued persecution in the East until 311, when he granted Christians forgiveness, freedom of worship and, implicitly, the ''status'' of ''religio licita''.

== Full text ==
Promulgated in the name of the other official members of the [[Tetrarchy]], the edict marked the end of persecutions against the Christians.

{{quote|Among other arrangements which we are always accustomed to make for the prosperity and welfare of the republic, we had desired formerly to bring all things into harmony with the ancient laws and public order of the Romans, and to provide that even the Christians who had left the religion of their fathers should come back to reason; since, indeed, the Christians themselves, for some reason, had followed such a caprice and had fallen into such a folly that they would not obey the institutes of antiquity, which perchance their own ancestors had first established; but at their own will and pleasure, they would thus make laws unto themselves which they should observe and would collect various peoples in diverse places in congregations. Finally when our law had been promulgated to the effect that they should conform to the institutes of antiquity, many were subdued by the fear of danger, many even suffered death. And yet since most of them persevered in their determination, and we saw that they neither paid the reverence and awe due to the gods nor worshipped the God of the Christians, in view of our most mild clemency and the constant habit by which we are accustomed to grant indulgence to all, we thought that we ought to grant our most prompt indulgence also to these, so that they may again be Christians and may hold their conventicles, provided they do nothing contrary to good order. But we shall tell the magistrates in another letter what they ought to do.

Wherefore, for this our indulgence, they ought to pray to their God for our safety, for that of the republic, and for their own, that the republic may continue uninjured on every side, and that they may be able to live securely in their homes.

This edict is published at Nicomedia on the day before the Kalends of May, in our eighth consulship and the second of Maximinus.|Lactantius, De Mort. Pers. ch. 34, 35. Opera, ed. O. F. Fritzsche, II, P. 273. (Bibl. Patt. Ecc. Lat. XI, Leipzig, 1844.)}}

The '''Electoral Commission of South Africa''' (often referred to as the '''Independent Electoral Commission''' or '''IEC''') is [[South Africa]]'s [[election management body]], an independent organisation established under [[Chapter nine institutions|chapter nine]] of the [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]]. It conducts elections to the [[National Assembly (South Africa)|National Assembly]], [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|provincial legislatures]] and [[municipalities of South Africa|municipal councils]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nationalgovernment.co.za/units/view/55/electoral-commission-iec-of-south-africa|title=Electoral Commission (IEC) of South Africa - Overview|website=nationalgovernment.co.za|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/independent-electoral-commission-iec-1996|title=Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) 1996|last=Abongile|date=2014-04-24|work=South African History Online|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eurasian Patent Convention''' ('''EAPC''') ({{lang-ru|Евразийская патентная конвенция}}) is an international [[patent|patent law]] [[treaty]] instituting both the [[Eurasian Patent Organization]] (EAPO) and the legal system pursuant to which Eurasian patents are granted.&lt;ref name=convention&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eapo.org/en/documents/norm/convention_txt.html|title=Eurasian Patent Convention|work=[[Eurasian Patent Organization]]|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed on 9 September 1994 in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], and entered into force on 12 August 1995.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eapo.org/eng/ea/patsys/history.html|title=History of the Eurasian patent organization|work=[[Eurasian Patent Organization]]|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pin&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 2016|title=Accessing patent information published in Russia – Part 1: Eurasian Patent Office|journal=Patent Information News|publisher=European Patent Office|volume=2016|issue=2|pages=12-14|url=http://documents.epo.org/projects/babylon/eponet.nsf/0/BB3248FC776D2A93C1257FD300318EC8/$File/patent_information_news_0216_en.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union]], its successor states had no system for protection of intellectual property. A common patent system was perceived in a convention which was signed on 27 December 1991, but never entered into force.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;  This system would provide for a true unitary patent that "may be granted, assigned or canceled in the territory of all the Contracting States with due regard to the invention [[patentability]] criteria provided for in the USSR legislation". The second version of the convention went less far: in line with the [[European Patent Convention]],&lt;ref name=pin/&gt; it provided for a single evaluation phase, but after approval, it would be converted in a bundle of national patents.

==States parties==
The convention was signed by 10 states in 1994, 8 of which became members one year later upon [[ratification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/other_treaties/parties.jsp?treaty_id=228&amp;group_id=21|title=Treaty database: Eurasian Patent Convention (EAPO)|work=WIPO|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Exempt property''', under the [[law]] of [[property]] in many jurisdictions, is property that can neither be passed by [[will (law)|will]] nor claimed by [[creditor]]s of the deceased in the event that a decedent leaves a surviving spouse or surviving descendants. Typically, exempt property includes a family [[car]], and a certain amount of cash (perhaps $10,000-$20,000), or the equivalent value in personal property.

Exempt property calculations and provisions are determined on a state-by-state basis.  This is important within the bankruptcy process, and may affect an individual's decision to file [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] or [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 13]] [[bankruptcy]].  State exemptions vary from strict to generous.  For example, [http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PR/htm/PR.42.htm Texas property exemptions] are more lenient and include your homestead and up to $60,000 in personal property. Texas also exempts certain investments and insurance policies. Other states, such as Arizona, may exempt only $150 in a checking account comparatively speaking.

The '''Financial Stability Board''' ('''FSB''') is an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the [[global financial system]]. It was established after the [[2009 G20 London summit|G20 London summit]] in April 2009 as a successor to the [[Financial Stability Forum]] (FSF). The Board includes all [[G20 major economies]], FSF members, and the [[European Commission]]. Hosted and funded by the [[Bank for International Settlements]], the board is based in [[Basel, Switzerland|Basel]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsb.org/contact/|title=Contact|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===Financial Stability Forum ===
{{Main|Financial Stability Forum}}

The FSB's predecessor organization, the Financial Stability Forum (FSF), had emerged from a group of [[finance ministry|finance ministries]], [[central bank]]ers, and international financial bodies, which had been founded in 1999 to promote international financial stability by the finance ministers and central bank governors of [[G7]] countries.&lt;ref name="Founding"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Genesis of the FSF | url = http://www.fsforum.org/about/genesis_of_the_fsf.html| work = | publisher = Financial Stability Forum| archive-date = 14 June 2008| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080614141837/http://www.fsforum.org/about/genesis_of_the_fsf.html | format = | doi = | accessdate = 30 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSF facilitated discussion and cooperation on supervision and surveillance of financial institutions, transactions, and events. FSF was managed by a small secretariat housed at the [[Bank for International Settlements]] in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="FSF home"&gt;{{cite web | title = Home/News| work = | publisher = Financial Stability Forum| date = | url = http://www.fsforum.org| archive-date = 12 May 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090512222115/http://www.fsforum.org/ | format = | doi = | accessdate = 30 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSF membership included about a dozen nations who participate through their central banks, financial ministries and departments, and securities regulators, including: the [[United States]], [[Japan]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], the [[Netherlands]] and several other industrialized economies as well as several international economic organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Who we are | url = http://www.fsforum.org/about/who_we_are.html| work = | publisher = Financial Stability Forum| archive-date = 14 June 2008| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080614141842/http://www.fsforum.org/about/who_we_are.html| format = | doi = | accessdate = 30 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the G20 summit on 15 November 2008, it was agreed that the membership of the FSF will be expanded to include emerging economies, such as China. The [[2009 G20 London summit]] decided to establish a successor to the FSF, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to include members of the G20 who had not been FSF members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Financial Stability Forum decides to broaden its membership |work= |publisher=Financial Stability Forum |date=12 March 2009 |url=http://www.fsforum.org/press/pr_090312b.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411064057/http://www.fsforum.org/press/pr_090312b.pdf |archive-date=11 April 2009 |format= |doi= |accessdate=30 April 2016 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding ===
The Financial Stability Forum met in [[Rome]] on 28–29 March 2008 in connection with the [[Bank for International Settlements]]. Members discussed current challenges in financial markets, and various policy options to address them from this point forward.&lt;ref name="BIS 0308"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bis.org/press/p080329.htm |title=Press release: Financial Stability Forum meets in Rome|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this meeting, the FSF discussed a report to be delivered to [[G7]] Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in April 2008. The report identifies key weaknesses underlying current financial turmoil, and recommends actions to improve market and institutional resilience. The FSF discussed work underway at the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] with regard to [[sovereign wealth fund]]s. The International Monetary Fund is working closely with sovereign wealth funds to identify a set of voluntary best practice guidelines, and is focusing on the governance, institutional arrangements and transparency of sovereign wealth funds.&lt;ref name="BIS 0308"/&gt; On 12 April 2008, the FSF delivered a report to the G7 Finance Ministers detailing its recommendations:&lt;ref name="FSFReport"&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the Financial Stability Forum on Enhancing Market and Institutional Resilience|date=7 April 2008|publisher=Financial Stability Forum|url=http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_0804.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.org/press/p080412.htm|title=Press release: Financial Stability Forum Recommends Actions to Enhance Market and Institutional Resilience|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Strengthen prudential oversight of capital, liquidity, and risk management
* Enhance transparency and valuation
* Change the role and uses of [[credit rating]]s
* Strengthen the authorities' responsiveness to risks
* Make robust arrangements for dealing with stress in the financial system

=== 2012 reforms ===
The High-Level Panel on the Governance of the FSB was an independent initiative coordinated by [[Domenico Lombardi]] of the [[Brookings Institution]]  and funded by the [[The Connect U.S. Fund|Connect U.S. Fund]]. It assembled a high-level panel of experts, including [[Uganda]]'s former [[Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (Uganda)|Finance Minister]] and [[Governor of the Bank of Uganda|Central Bank Governor]] of Uganda [[Ezra Suruma]], former [[Prime Minister of Kyrgyzstan|Prime Minister]] of [[Kyrgyzstan]] [[Djoomart Otorbaev]], former [[Minister of Finance and Public Credit of Colombia|Finance Minister]] of [[Colombia]] [[José Antonio Ocampo]], and [[Jacques Mistral]], a former member of [[France]]'s Council of Economic Analysis.&lt;ref name="newrules"&gt;{{cite web|title=What We Do: High-Level Panel on the Governance of the Financial Stability Board|url=http://www.new-rules.org/what-we-do/fsb-unlocking-the-black-box/hlp-on-fsb-governance|website=New Rules for Global Finance|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lombardi published the panel's final report in September 2011 as a Brookings Issue Paper, concluding that the FSB's governance had not evolved as quickly as its prominence. It made several recommendations:&lt;ref name="brookings"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Domenico Lombardi|authorlink1=Domenico Lombardi|title=The Governance of the Financial Stability Board|date=September 2011|publisher=Brookings Institution|location=Washington, DC|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FSB_Issues_Paper_Lombardi.pdf|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2011 G20 Cannes summit]], the G20 called for a strengthening of the FSB's capacity resources and governance by establishing the FSB "on an enduring organizational basis".&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.fsb.org/about/history/|website=Financial Stability Board|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2012 report to the [[2012 G20 Los Cabos summit|G20 Los Cabos summit]], the FSB set out concrete steps to strengthen the organization's capacity, resources, and governance as well as establish it on an enduring organizational footing. The G20 endorsed the FSB's restated and amended charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Report to the G20 Los Cabos Summit on Strengthening FSB Capacity, Resources and Governance|date=12 June 2012|publisher=Financial Stability Board|url=http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_120619c.pdf|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, the FSB became a separate legal entity in the form of an association or "Verein" under Swiss law, when its Articles of Association were adopted by the FSB Plenary.&lt;ref name="ar4"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Financial Stability Board|title=4th Annual Report|date=December 2017|publisher=Financial Stability Board|location=Basel|url=http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P160118.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FSB is hosted and funded by the Bank for International Settlements under a five-year agreement executed between the two in January 2013. The bank bears the majority of the FSB's operating expenses, and the FSB does not have any assets, liabilities, or revenue.&lt;ref name="ar4"/&gt;

=== 2016 reforms===

In late July 2016, after the world markets had faced a number of crises, including terrorism and the UK's [[Brexit|decision to leave]] the [[European Union]], Carney sent a letter to Finance Ministers attending the G20 Summit and to Central Bank Governors outlining the reforms the FSB had made&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theasianbanker.com/press-releases/fsb-chair-updates-g20-finance-ministers-and-central-bank-governors-on-progress-in-advancing-the-fsb%E2%80%99s-2016-priorities |title=FSB Chair updates G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on progress in advancing the FSB’s 2016 priorities |author= |date=24 July 2016 |website=The Asian Banker |access-date=25 July 2016 |quote=The letter outlines the progress the FSB is making in advancing its priorities for 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that the global economy and financial system had "continued to function effectively" and had "weathered" the "spikes in uncertainty and risk aversion", confirming that "this resilience in the face of stress demonstrates the enduring benefits of G20 post-crisis reforms". He emphasized the value of specific reforms that had been implemented by the Financial Stability Board stating that these had "dampened aftershocks from [global financial crises] rather than amplifying them". He expressed confidence in the FSB's strategies, stating that "resilience in the face of stress demonstrates the enduring benefits of G20 post-crisis reforms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Szu |first=Ping Chan |date=24 July 2016 |title=G20: Chancellor eyes clarity on Brexit deal 'later this year' as vote raises global risks |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/07/24/g20-chancellor-eyes-clarity-on-brexit-deal-later-this-year-as-vo |work=The Telegraph |location=London, UK |access-date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FSB published the pre-G20 summit letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsb.org/2016/07/fsb-chair-updates-g20-finance-ministers-and-central-bank-governors-on-progress-in-advancing-the-fsbs-2016-priorities/ |title=FSB Chair updates G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on progress in advancing the FSB’s 2016 priorities |author=|date=24 July 2016 |website=FSB |publisher=FSB |access-date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in light of the "two spikes in uncertainty and risk aversion" weathered by the global economy and financial system as of late July 2016, which outlined its priorities for 2016:
* Promote a coordinated program of reforms to deliver resilient sources of market-based finance, including addressing structural vulnerabilities associated with [[asset management]]
* Develop robust financial market infrastructure, including assessing policies on central counterparty resilience, recovery, and resolvability, and recommending any necessary improvements
* Support effective [[Macroprudential regulation|macroprudential]] arrangements by drawing lessons from countries that have applied macroprudential policy frameworks and tools, working in partnership with the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[Bank for International Settlements]]

In addition to the priorities listed above, the FSB also sought to:
* Pursue the full and consistent implementation of post-crisis reforms, while addressing material unintended consequences
* Address new and emerging vulnerabilities in the financial system, including those associated with conduct, correspondent banking and climate change
* Monitor the potentially systemic implications of [[Financial technology|financial technology]] [[Financial innovation|innovations]], and the systemic risks arising from operational disruptions

In November 2016, the FSB and the board of the Bank for International Settlements agreed to a further five-year extension of the agreement from January 2018 to 2023.&lt;ref name="ar4"/&gt;

== Overview ==
The FSB represented the G20 leaders' first major international institutional innovation. [[U.S. Treasury]] [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary]] [[Tim Geithner]] has described it as "in effect, a fourth pillar" of the architecture of global economic governance. The FSB has been assigned a number of important tasks, working alongside the International Monetary Fund, [[World Bank]], and the [[World Trade Organization]]. Chairman of the board is the Canadian [[Mark Carney]], [[Governor of the Bank of England|Governor]] of the [[Bank of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mark Carney gets chance to reshape Bank of England after departure of deputy governor|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2013/06/14/mark-carney-gets-chance-to-reshape-bank-of-england-as-deputy-governor-departs |accessdate=20 June 2013|work=[[Financial Post]]|date=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most multilateral financial institutions, the FSB lacks a legal form and any formal power, given that its charter is an informal and nonbinding memorandum of understanding for cooperation adopted by its members.&lt;ref name="brookings"/&gt;

=== Membership ===
The FSB has 68 member institutions, comprising ministries of finance, central banks, and supervisory and regulatory authorities from 25 jurisdictions as well as 10 international organizations and [[Standards organization|standard-setting bodies]], and 6 Regional Consultative Groups reaching out to 65 other jurisdictions around the world.&lt;ref name="ar4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Members"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/members/links.htm |title=Links to FSB members |publisher=Financial Stability Board |accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Freedom of the seas''' ({{lang-la|mare liberum}}, &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"free sea") is a principle in the [[international law]] and [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|sea]]. It stresses freedom to navigate the [[ocean]]s. It also disapproves of war fought in water. The freedom is to be breached only in a necessary international agreement.
[[File:"Freedom of Seas is in Your Hands" - NARA - 514332.jpg|thumb|right|Freedom of the Seas, World War II US poster]]
This principle was one of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]] proposed during the [[First World War]].   In his speech to the [[United States Congress|Congress]], the president said:

{{quote|Absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas, outside [[territorial waters]], alike in peace and in war, except as the seas may be closed in whole or in part by international action for the enforcement of [[treaty|international covenants]].}}

The United States' allies [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[France]] were opposed to this point, as [[Great Britain]] was also a considerable naval power at the time. As with Wilson's other points, freedom of the seas was rejected by the [[German Empire|German]] government.

Today, the concept of "freedom of the seas" can be found in the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] under Article 87(1) which states: "the [[international waters|high seas]] are open to all [[sovereign state|states]], whether coastal or [[landlocked country|land-locked]]". Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of [[submarine communications cable|submarine cables]], building [[artificial island]]s, fishing and scientific research.

==Historical background==
{{See also|Santa Catarina (ship)}}
Between the end of the 15th century up until the 17th century various powers claimed [[sovereignty]] over parts of the sea. In 1609, Dutch [[jurist]] and [[philosopher]] [[Hugo Grotius]] wrote what is considered the foundation of international legal doctrine regarding the [[sea]]s and [[ocean]]s&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Mare Liberum]]'', a Latin title that translates to "freedom of the seas". The Grotian concept of "freedom of the sea" was only accepted after a century long debate between Grotius' ideas and [[John Selden]]{{'}}s.&lt;ref name=mpeil&gt;{{Bluebook website |last=Treves |first=Trullio |title=High Seas |publisher=Max Planck Foundation for International Peace and the Rule of Law |url=http://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e1174 |date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is generally assumed that Grotius first propounded the principle of freedom of the seas, countries in the [[Indian Ocean]] and other Asian seas accepted the right of [[Freedom of navigation|unobstructed navigation]] long before Grotius wrote his ''De Jure Praedae'' (''On the Law of Spoils'') in the year of 1604. Previously, in the 16th century, Spanish theologian [[Francisco de Vitoria]] postulated the idea of freedom of the seas in a more rudimentary fashion under the principles of ''[[jus gentium]]''.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum1947"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Nussbaum|title=A concise history of the law of nations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxkQAQAAMAAJ|year=1947|publisher=Macmillan Co.|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, nations started to expand and claim many resources and water territories all over their surrounding coasts. There were four international treaties meticulously drafted in the late 1950s and onto the 1970s, but the issues were not resolved between nations until 1982 when the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] was introduced.

[[UNCLOS]] is a [[Law of the Sea]] treaty: an agreement of rights and responsibilities of nations and their use of the world’s ocean with guidelines of trade, environment, and the management of marine and open seas resources. UNCLOS replaced the four international treaties drafted in the late 1950s through 1970s. As of 2013, 165 countries and the European Union have joined the Convention.

==High seas and registration==
According to [[international law]], Article 92  of the convention which describes ships shall sail under the flag of one state only and, save in exceptional cases expressly provided for in international treaties or in this Convention, shall be subject to its exclusive jurisdiction on the high seas;&lt;ref&gt;UNCLOS article 92(1)&lt;/ref&gt; however, when a ship is involved in certain criminal acts, such as [[piracy]],&lt;ref&gt;UNCLOS article 105&lt;/ref&gt; any nation can exercise jurisdiction under the doctrine of [[universal jurisdiction]]. High seas were defined as any part of the sea that was not either territorial sea or [[internal waters]], [[territorial waters]] and [[exclusive economic zones]]. Article 88 of the 1982 Convention states that the high seas shall be reserved for peaceful purposes. Many countries engage in military maneuvers and the testing of conventional weapons and [[nuclear weapon]]s on the high seas.&lt;ref&gt;UNCLOS article 88(1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Trinity (nuclear test)]] and [[Ivy Mike]].&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to deliver the right punishment to the right person or state, ships must be registered to a country to show proof of ownership.&lt;ref name="A Guide to Ship Registration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimenz.govt.nz/Publications-and-forms/Commercial-operations/Ship-registration/A-guide-to-Ship-Registration.pdf |title=A Guide to Ship Registration |publisher=Maritime New Zealand |date=30 September 2010 |accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The owner of the vessel sometimes prefers to pay the lower registration fees by picking countries such as Panama, Bermuda, Italy, Malta and the Netherlands. According to Cruise Lines International Association, 90% of commercial vessels calling on U.S. ports fly foreign flags.&lt;ref name="Why are cruise ships registered in foreign countries?"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2012/12/11/why-are-cruise-ships-registered-in-foreign-countries/1760759/|title= Why are cruise ships registered in foreign countries? |publisher=Special for USA TODAY|date=8 January 2013 |accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid the high cost with more rules and regulations, ships and tankers sometime prefer lower cost registration with a lower standard of inspection and regulation by picking a country that exercises less control over their registered ships,&lt;ref&gt;Epps, V. ''International Law'', (2009) pg. 247&lt;/ref&gt; though many ships are owned by individuals or companies in another country (most commonly Japan and Greece) under a system called "[[flag of convenience]]". Registering a ship in Panama means that the ship is governed by the maritime rules of Panama rather than the ship owner's country. Ship owners do this because Panama has low taxes and fewer labor and safety regulations than most other countries. Ship owners can make their staff work longer hours in less safe environments, and therefore maximize their profits. Other countries, including Liberia, Cyprus and the Bahamas also offer flags of convenience, but Panama has the most ships registered under the scheme. Ships registered with the US will cost more, and the employee wages will be even higher.&lt;ref name="Why are cruise ships registered in foreign countries?"/&gt; Freedom of the seas allows a ship to move freely on the ocean as long as it follows international law.

==Trade opportunities==
From the [[Vikings]] to the European, Central Asia, Africa and North and South America, trade has served an important role in history, and has been a key factor of a growing economy. Trade transfers the ownership of goods from one person or entity to another by getting a product or service in exchange from the buyer. When a ship sets sail, there may be many ports waiting for it to bring goods from all over the world for trade and sale. [[Free trade]] opening up markets to foreign suppliers increases competition. Without free trade, domestic companies may have enjoyed monopolies or oligopolies that enabled them to keep prices well above marginal costs. Trade liberalization will undermine that market power.&lt;ref name="Why trade is good for you"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.economist.com/node/605144|title= A short tour of economic theory|publisher=A survey of world trade| accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Trade Organization]] states that "The ocean is a big part of the free trade happening around the world. Every day we see silk imported from China, fruits from Mexico, spices from India, chocolate from Africa and many more goods in our home were imported from another country. The ocean made it possible for many countries to put their cargoes on to ships and transfer them across the ocean.  Hundreds of nations joined the [[World Trade Organization]].  With goods to be traded from one nation to another through the transportation on various size vessels from coast to coast, trade promoted more economic value to goods where goods and services are produced to support the supply and demand of the participants in the organization."&lt;ref name="World Trade Organization"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/inbrief_e/inbr00_e.htm| title= The WTO in Brief| publisher=WTO| accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920]], also known as the Jones Act (46 USC § 883) is a maritime law that controls coastal trade within the United States and determines which ships may lawfully engage in that trade and the rules under which they must operate.&lt;ref name="MARITIME LAW CENTER"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.maritimelawcenter.com/html/the_jones_act.html | title=THE JONES ACT | publisher=Mike Vaughn, Attorney at Law| accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act is in place to protect jobs for US citizens and its people working at U.S. ports, and on U.S. vessels. Many vessels around the globe sail under many different flags, and have different crews from different parts of the world where the pay rate is much lower than the U.S.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} The Jones Act protects the Americans' jobs and restricts coastwise transportation of passengers. 46 USC § 12108 additionally restricts the use of foreign vessels to commercially catch or transport fish in U.S. waters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6365">{{Slavery}}
'''Freedom of wombs''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] '''''Libertad de vientres'''''), also referred to as '''free birth''', was a judicial principle applied in several countries in [[South America]] in the 19th century; it did not allow for the enslavement of [[slavery|slaves]]' children at birth. This overturned a tradition of enslavement in European colonies in the Americas where babies born to enslaved women became the property of the women's owners. Although intended to be a gradual abolition of slavery, the principle was unevenly applied and many countries did not follow through with full abolition.

The Freedom of Wombs Law, commonly referred to as The Free Womb Law was indeed a rule that all children who were born and raised from enslaved women were not enslaved at birth. This law provided protections of slave savings for each and every child, so that they could be protected, if anything were to happen. This also acknowledged that slaves could be self-purchased because they eventually did not need to get permission from, or have to really listen to their masters, and or multiple slave owners. This also allowed for potential slave registration to comply with it. It is also known that Congressional leads have changed the outcome of the Free Womb Law. These outlined the specific rules that Indigenous people had to follow in Chapter 4: Interpreting Machudo de Assis of the book entitled "Honor Status, and Law In Modern Latin America, written by Sueann Caulfield, Sarah C. Chambers, Laura Putnam and editors.&lt;ref&gt;Caulfield, Sueann, et al. “Interpreting Machado De Assis: Paternalism, Slavery, and the Free Womb Law.” Honor, Status, and Law in Modern Latin America, Duke University Press, 2005, pp. 99–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==
A movement for independence from Spain grew in the American colonies in the 19th century, influenced by liberal ideas, such as the [[abolitionism|abolition]] of slavery, which Mexico had declared in 1829 by President [[Vicente Guerrero]], Great Britain in 1833, and the United States in 1865 at the end of that country's civil war. One of the first steps in gradual abolition was the ''Ley de Libertad de Vientres,'' an 1811 law written by [[Manuel de Salas]] of Chile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auroradechile.cl/newtenberg/681/article-3031.html "Manuel de Salas"] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Argentina]], the Law of Wombs was passed on February 2, 1813 by the [[Asamblea del Año XIII|Assembly of Year XIII]]. The law stated that those born to slave mothers after January 31, 1813 would be granted freedom when contracting matrimony, or on their 16th birthday for women and 20th for men. Upon [[manumission]], they were to be given land and tools to work it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educar-argentina.com.ar/CORIA/coria9.htm "Pasado y presente de los Negros en Buenos Aires"] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, Argentina fully abolished slavery with the [[Argentine Constitution of 1853|Constitution of 1853]]. 

In [[Brazil]], in 1871 the “Free Womb Law”, also known as the “Law of 1871”, was passed. By the 1870s social tensions were rising due to slavery in Brazil. Conservatives and Parliament favored the idea of emancipating slaves and enacted a law freeing all slaves and children born to enslaved women. The "Free Womb Law" made it so that children born to a enslaved women were not enslaved and slaves themselves were consequently then granted freedom through self-purchase. Children born to slaves were now free people and this law began the process of slaves becoming free people. Slave masters had no say in the newly recognized right of freedom granted to children born to slaves.  &lt;ref&gt;Caulfield, Sueann, et al. “Interpreting Machado De Assis: Paternalism, Slavery, and the Free Womb Law.” Honor, Status, and Law in Modern Latin America, Duke University Press, 2005, pp. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Peru]], the [[president of Peru|president]] [[José de San Martín]] established "the freedom of wombs" for those born after the [[Independence of Peru|declaration of independence]] in 1821.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educared.edu.pe/estudiantes/historia6/fenomeno2.htm "La sociedad a inicios de la República"] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Colombia]], the Law of wombs was first passed by the government of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] in 1814, but it was not until 1824 that the country accepted it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colombiaaprende.edu.co/html/etnias/1604/article-82844.html "http://www.colombiaaprende.edu.co/html/etnias/1604/article-82844.html"] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spain]] passed a similar law in 1869 to apply to its plantation colonies of [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]], and passed it in 1870, to take effect in 1872. On the Iberian mainland, Spain had abolished slavery in 1837. It is also known as ''[[Ley Moret]]'' ([[Moret Law]]). &lt;ref&gt;[http://freeweb.supereva.com/carlo260/vientres_libres.html?p "La Ley de Vientres Libres y los intereses esclavistas"] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venezuela endorsed a similar law in 1821,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpolar.org.ve/nosotros/educacional/economia/abolescl.html "Ley de Abolición de la Esclavitud"] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Ecuador]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/historia/equinoccial_6_comercio/capitu26.htm "REFORMAS ECONÓMICAS DE MEDIADOS DEL SIGLO XIX"] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Uruguay]] in 1825,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidencia.gub.uy/_Web/ddhh/ddhhuru.htm "Instrumentos Nacionales de Derechos Humanos"] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paraguay]] in 1842&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asa.edu.py/tch_work/estudiossociales/cronologiaamericalatina.htm "De la Independencia  a nuestros días"] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brazil]] in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historiabrasileira.com/escravidao-no-brasil/lei-do-ventre-livre/ "LEI DO VENTRE LIVRE"] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The countries that first denied the enslavement of babies born to enslaved mothers proceeded to [[Abolitionism|abolish slavery]] in total later. Similar [[gradual abolition]] laws had been passed in some of the northern United States after the [[American Revolutionary War]], namely, [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1799 and [[New Jersey]] in 1804. All the slaves were freed in both states before the [[American Civil War]].

The '''Golden Bull of 1356''' ({{Lang-de|Goldene Bulle}}, {{Lang-la|Bulla Aurea}}, {{Lang-it|Bolla d'oro}}) was a decree issued by the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] at [[Diet of Nuremberg|Nuremberg]] and [[Metz]] ([[Diet of Metz (1356/57)|Diet of Metz, 1356/57]]) headed by the  Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] which fixed, for a period of more than four hundred years, important aspects of the [[constitution]]al structure of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It was named the ''[[Golden Bull]]'' for the golden seal it carried.

In June 2013 the Golden Bull was included in the [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World Register]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-8/the-golden-bull-all-seven-originals-and-the-king-wenceslaus-luxury-manuscript-copy-of-the-oesterreichische-nationalbibliothek/ Memory of the World - The “Golden Bull” – All seven originals and the “King Wenceslaus’ luxury manuscript copy” of the Österreichische Nationalbibliothek ], www.unesco.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
According to the written text of the Golden Bull of 1356
{{quote|We have promulgated, decreed and recommended for ratification the subjoined laws for the purpose of cherishing unity among the Electors, and of bringing about a unanimous election, and of closing all approach to the aforesaid detestable discord and to the various dangers which arise from it.&lt;ref&gt;Charles IV, Golden Bull of 1356. [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/medieval/golden.asp translated into English], Yale&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though the election of the [[King of the Romans]] by the chief ecclesiastical and secular [[princes of the Holy Roman Empire]] was well established, disagreements about the process and papal involvement had repeatedly resulted in controversies, most recently in 1314 when [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis of Bavaria]] and [[Frederick the Fair|Frederick of Austria]] had been elected by opposing sets of electors. Louis, who had eventually subdued his rival's claim on the battlefield,&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Heer, trans. Janet Sondheimer, ''The Holy Roman Empire'' (New York: Federick A. Praeger Publishers, 1968), p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; made a first attempt to clarify the process in the [[Declaration of Rhense]] of 1338, which renounced any papal involvement and had restricted the right to choose a new king to the [[prince-elector]]s. The Golden Bull, promulgated by Louis's successor and rival, Charles IV, was more precise in several ways.

==Prince-electors==

Firstly, the Bull explicitly named the seven [[Prince-elector]]s (''Kurfürsten'') who were to choose the King and also defined the ''Reichserzämter'', their (largely ceremonial) offices at court:&lt;ref name="Bryce"&gt;Bryce, James, ''The Holy Roman Empire'' (London: The Macmillan Company, new edition, 1978), p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, the principle of [[Majority rule|majority voting]] was explicitly stated for the first time in the Empire. The Bull prescribed that four (out of seven) votes would always suffice to elect a new King; as a result, three Electors could no longer block the election. Thirdly, the Electoral principalities were declared [[primogeniture|indivisible]], and succession to them was regulated to ensure that the votes would never be divided. Finally, the Bull cemented a number of privileges for the Electors, confirming their elevated role in the Empire. It is therefore also a milestone in the establishment of largely independent states in the Empire, a process to be concluded only centuries later, notably with the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648.

This codification of prince-electors, though largely based on precedence, was not uncontroversial, especially in regard to the two chief rivals of the ruling [[House of Luxembourg]]:
*The [[House of Wittelsbach]] ruled the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] as well as the County Palatinate. Dynastic divisions had caused the two territories to devolve upon distinct branches of the house. The [[Treaty of Pavia (1329)|Treaty of Pavia]], which in 1329 restored the Palatinate branch, stipulated that Bavaria and the Palatinate would alternate in future elections but the Golden Bull fixed the electoral vote upon the Palatinate and not upon Bavaria, partly because Charles's predecessor and rival, [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] was of that branch. Louis IV's sons, [[Louis V, Duke of Bavaria|Louis V]] and [[Stephen II, Duke of Bavaria|Stephen II of Bavaria]], protested this omission, feeling that Bavaria, one of the [[History of Bavaria|original duchies]] of the realm and their family's chief territory for over 170 years, deserved primacy over the Palatinate. The omission of Bavaria from the list of prince-electors also allowed Bavaria, which had only recently been reunited, to fall into dynastic fragmentation again. Brandenburg was in the hands of the Bavarian Wittelsbachs (though held by a junior member of the house) in 1356, they eventually lost the territory to the Luxemburgs in 1373, leaving the Bavarian branch without representation on the Electoral college until 1623.
*The [[House of Habsburg]], long-time rivals of the Luxembourgs, were completely omitted from the list of prince-electors, leading to decreased political influence and dynastic fragmentation. In retaliation, Duke [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria|Rudolf IV]], one of the dukes of fragmented Austria, had the ''[[Privilegium Maius]]'' forged, a document supposedly issued by Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]]. The document gave Austria - elevated to the position of an [[Archduchy of Austria|Archduchy]] - special privileges, including [[primogeniture]]. While ignored by the Emperor and other princes at the time, the document was eventually ratified when [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick of Austria]] himself became Emperor in the 15th century. Still, the Habsburgs remained without an electoral vote until they succeeded to the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1526.

==Procedures==
[[File:Golden Bull Metz 1356.jpg|thumb|Imperial Diet in [[Metz]] during which the Golden Bull of 1356 was issued.]]
The bull regulated the whole election process in great detail, listing explicitly where, when, and under which circumstances what should be done by whom, not only for the [[prince-elector]]s but also (for example) for the population of [[Frankfurt]], where the elections were to be held, and also for the counts of the regions the prince-electors had to travel through to get there. The decision to hold the elections in Frankfurt reflected a traditional feeling dating from [[East Frankish]] days that both election and coronation ought to take place on Frankish soil.&lt;ref name="Bryce"/&gt; However, the election location was not the only specified location; the bull specified that the coronation would take place in Aachen, and Nuremberg would be the place where the first diet of a reign should be held.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Heer, ''The Holy Roman Empire'', trans. Janet Sondheimer, (New York: Federick A. Praeger Publishers, 1968), 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The elections were to be concluded within thirty days; failing that, the bull prescribed that the prince-electors were to receive only bread and water until they had decided:

{{quote|
{{lang|la|Quod si facere distulerint infra triginta dies, a die prestiti juramenti prefati continuo numerandos, extunc transactis eisdem triginta diebus amodo panem manducent et aquam et nullatenus civitatem exeant antedictam, nisi prius per ipsos vel majorem partem ipsorum rector seu temporale caput fidelium electum fuerit, ut prefertur.}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phil.uni-erlangen.de/~p1ges/netzsem/gb/gb_c2.html#3 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520035819/http://www.phil.uni-erlangen.de/~p1ges/netzsem/gb/gb_c2.html |date=2006-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[Translation:] But if they shall fail to do this within thirty days, counting continuously from the day when they took the aforesaid oath: when those thirty days are over, from that time on they shall live on bread and water, and by no means leave the aforesaid city {{bracket|[[Frankfurt]]}} unless first through them, or the majority of them, a ruler or temporal head of the faithful shall have been elected, as was said before.&lt;ref&gt;http://avalon.law.yale.edu/medieval/golden.asp&lt;/ref&gt;|Chapter 2, §3.}}

Besides regulating the election process, the chapters of the Golden Bull contained many minor decrees. For instance, it also defined the order of marching when the emperor was present, both with and without his insignia. A relatively major decision was made in chapter 15, where Charles IV outlawed any ''{{lang|la|conjurationes, confederationes,}}'' and ''{{lang|la|conspirationes}}'', meaning in particular the city alliances (''[[Städtebund|Städtebünde]]''), but also other communal leagues that had sprung up through the [[communal movement in mediaeval Europe]]. Most ''Städtebünde'' were subsequently dissolved, {{citation needed|date=September 2013}} sometimes forcibly, and where refounded, their political influence was much reduced .{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Thus the Golden Bull also strengthened the nobility in general to the detriment of the cities .{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}
[[File:Goldene Bulle Druck 15. Jh.jpg|thumb|[[Incunable]] of the Golden Bull in [[Early New High German]], late 15th century, [[University of Jena]]]]
[[Pope Innocent VI|The pope]]'s involvement with the Golden Bull of 1356 was basically nonexistent, which was significant in the history of relations between the popes and the emperors. When Charles IV laid down procedure for electing a King of the Romans, he mentioned nothing about receiving papal confirmation of the election. However, [[Pope Innocent VI]] did not protest this because he needed Charles’s support against the [[house of Visconti|Visconti]].&lt;ref&gt;Yves Renouard, ''The Avignon Papacy 1305–1403'', (Connecticut : Archon Books, 1970), 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Innocent continued to have good relations with Charles IV after the Golden Bull of 1356 until the former's death in 1362.&lt;ref&gt;D.S.

''heerlijkheden''; also called ''heerschap''; Latin: ''[[Dominium]]''&lt;ref&gt;Brabantia illustrata&lt;/ref&gt;) was a landed estate that served as the lowest administrative and judicial unit in rural areas in the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking [[Low Countries]] before 1800. It originated as a unit of lordship under the [[feudal]] system during the [[Middle Ages]]. The English equivalents are ''[[manor]]'', ''[[seigniory]]'', and ''lordship''.&lt;ref name="van dale"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Van Dale|title=Groot Woordenboek Nederlands Engels}}. The translation used by J.L. Price in ''Dutch Society 1588-1713'' is "manor"; by David Nicholas in ''Medieval Flanders'' is "seigneury".&lt;/ref&gt; The ''heerlijkheid'' system was the Dutch version of [[manorialism]] that prevailed in the Low Countries and was the precursor to the modern [[Municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality system in the Netherlands]] and [[List of municipalities of the Flemish Region|Flemish Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;The unreferrenced information in this article has been translated from the mostly unfootnoted article on "heerlijkheid" on the Dutch version of Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Much of the unreferrenced information in this article is found at this website: [http://www.herenvanholland.nl Heerlijkheden van Holland] (in Dutch only)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics and types==
[[Image:Titles of Jacob Jan, Lord of Wassenaar (1765).JPG|thumb|260px|Titles of Jacob Jan, Lord of Wassenaar (1765)]]A typical ''heerlijkheid'' manor consisted of a village and the surrounding lands extending out for a kilometre or so. Taking 18th-century [[Wassenaar]] as an example of a large ''hoge heerlijkheid'', it was 3,612 [[morgen]]s in size and had 297 houses. Nearby [[Voorschoten]] was 1,538 morgens in size and had 201 houses. [[Nootdorp]] was an ''ambachtsheerlijkheid'' of 196 morgens and 58 houses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herenvanholland.nl Heerlijkheden van Holland] (in Dutch only)&lt;/ref&gt; There were 517 ''heerlijkheden'' in the province of Holland in the 18th century. All fell into the last three categories in the list below (except for a few for which this information is unknown).

Not all ''heerlijkheden'' were the same. They differed in size and composition.&lt;ref name="Janse"/&gt; Also, a ''heerlijkheid'' should not be confused with a larger territory, like a [[county]] (''graafschap'') or [[viscounty]] (''burggraafschap''), nor with administrative regions on par with an English [[shire]], Dutch ''gouw'', German ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|Gau]]'', or Roman or Carolingian ''[[pagus]]''. A Flemish [[castellany]] (''kasselrij'' or ''burggraafschap'') was larger and different from a ''heerlijkheid'', but they were similar in some ways.&lt;ref name="Nicholas"&gt;{{Cite book|author=David Nicholas|title=Medieval Flanders}} pp. 47, 50, 88, 106, 159, 341&lt;/ref&gt;

There were different kinds of ''heerlijkheid'':

* '''''vrijheerlijkheid''''' — an allod or allodium.&lt;ref name="NWNT"&gt;{{Cite book|author=I.M. Calisch and N.S. Calisch|title=Nieuw Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal 1864}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ''heerlijkheden'' were found usually at the edges of a county and were called ‘free’ (''vrij'') because they were [[allodial]] instead of a [[fief]] held by an overlord.&lt;ref name="Janse"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Antheun Janse, "Een in zichzelf verdeeld rijk"|title=Geschiedenis van Holland (Deel 1: tot 1572)}}pp. 70-102&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''erfheerlijkheid''''' — a [[feudal barony]].
* '''''hoge heerlijkheid''''' — a great barony or ‘[[Honour (feudal barony)|honour]]’, either a [[fief]] or [[allodium]]. In these large lordships, the lord had jurisdiction to appoint a bailiff (''baljuw'') instead of just a reeve (''[[schout]]''), and to administer capital punishment. It was possible for a ''heerlijkheid'' to be both prescriptive (''vrij'') and large (''hoge''). The largest were actually mini-counties within the county.&lt;ref name="Janse"/&gt;
* '''''ambacht''''' or '''''ambachtsheerlijkheid''''' — a [[serjeanty]], often located inland rather than on the borders. Serjeanties sometimes consisted of nothing more than a castle and a few hectares of land, although most were larger than this.&lt;ref name="Janse"/&gt; The serjeant did not have the power of ‘pit and gallows’, i.e., the power to impose the death penalty.
* '''''schoutsambt''''' — a reeveland, the territory under the charge of a reeve (''[[schout]]''), thus equivalent to the jurisdiction of a ''heerlijkheid''

==Lord of the manor (''heer'')==
[[Image:Unico Wilhelm van Wassenaer-Obdam door George de Marees 1697-1776.jpg|thumb|[[Unico Wilhelm van Wassenaer]]-Obdam as painted by George de Marees]]
The central figure was the lord of the ''heerlijkheid'' and effectively its owner—the [[lord of the manor|manorial lord]] or [[lady]]. In Dutch, the lord was called ''heer'' and the lady ''vrouw(e)''. The lord was also referred to by the Latin word ''[[dominus (title)|dominus]]''. A rarer English alternative is ''[[fiefdom|seigneur]]''.&lt;ref name="Schama PL"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Simon Schama|title=Patriots &amp; Liberators}} pp. 75-77, 212, 222, 429, 470-472&lt;/ref&gt; There were different kinds of lord and lady:

* '''''vrijheer''''' and '''''vrijvrouwe''''' (literally, ‘free lord’ and ‘free lady’) — allodial lord or allodiary, tenant of an allodial lordship.
* '''''erfheer''''' and '''''erfvrouwe''''' (literally, ‘hereditary lord’ and ‘hereditary lady’) — [[feudal baron]] or mesne lord, tenant of a fiefdom.
* '''''baanderheer''''' (literally, ‘[[knight banneret]]’) — tenant by [[knight-service]]; some lords used this title when their noble line was ancient and therefore superior to other nobles
* '''''ambachtsheer''''' — tenant by [[serjeanty]] (''ambacht'' or ''ambachtsheerlijkheid'').

Under the feudal system, a manorial lord typically was himself the [[vassal]] of a higher-ranking [[tenant-in-chief]], usually a highborn noble, who was in turn the crown vassal of the [[king]] or [[emperor]]. However, sometimes there was no [[Mesne lord|mesne]] tenancy (''tussenliggende heerschappij''), as was the case with knight's fees held ''[[Capite|in capite]]'' (''rijksonmiddellijke heerlijkheid''). The ''heerlijkheid'' was ruled directly by a count (''graaf''), a viscount (''burggraaf'') or a baron (''baron''). Also, it was not uncommon for the lord to be ecclesiastical, e.g. a [[prince-bishop]] (''prins-bisschop'') or [[prince-abbot]] (''vorst-abt'').

Originally, ''heerlijkheden'' were held exclusively by the nobility.&lt;ref name="Janse"/&gt; However, starting around the 16th century, lordship over a ''heerlijkheid'' was not synonymous with nobility. A ''heerlijkheid'' could be bought and sold. Many ended up in the hands of wealthy merchants and a political class known as the [[regenten|regents]].

In addition, many were bought by [[Ancient borough|borough]]s ([[burgh]]s). In the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, it was not unusual for a borough to purchase the ''heerlijkheden'' around it in order to gain control and ownership of the surrounding land and the resulting economic advantages. Boroughs were themselves not part of the manorial system: the countryside and villages were governed by lords, whereas boroughs were self-governing.

==Feudal origins==
The ''heerlijkheden'' came into being as a result of the feudal system, in particular the sovereign's delegated judicial prerogative. The crown, as lord paramount, granted the right to govern and to exercise judicial authority to a crown vassal, often a confidante or as a reward for military service or political support. The crown vassal—e.g. a [[count]] (''graaf'') or [[duke]] (''hertog'')—thus exercised all or part of the sovereign's royal authority. In turn the crown vassal granted rights to the mesne lords of the ''heerlijkheden''.

Because a [[fief]] (''leen'') originated out of a bond between vassal and lord for military service, vassalage (Dutch ''[[:nl:manschap|manschap]]'') was personal not heritable. With the advent of professional armies, the vassalage bond fell into disuse or was replaced by [[scutage]]; however, vassalage remained personal. One of the consequences of this was that, on the death of the vassal (''leenman'' or ''vazal''), the fief [[escheat]]ed to the lord (''leenheer''). The vassal's heir was able to retain the ''heerlijkheid'' through the [[commendation ceremony]] (''leenhulde''), the process of paying homage and swearing fealty officiated at the head [[manorial court|manor court]] (''souveraine leenhof'' or ''leenkammer''). The new vassal made a symbolic payment (''leenverhef'') to his lord. The same ceremony was held when a ''heerlijkheid'' manor was sold. If there was no direct descendant, other blood relatives could exercise their right of ''laudatio parentum'' (Du ''naderschap''), which grants them a [[right of first refusal]] and explains how ''heerlijkheden'' were able to be kept in the same families for centuries.

==Manorial rights==
The tenancy of a ''heerlijkheid'' is not to be confused with land ownership. It was an [[estate in land]], not land ''per se''. Although lords of the manor generally owned property within a ''heerlijkheid'' (often substantial amounts), it was possible for a lord not to own any property at all within his own ''heerlijkheid''. Also, when agricultural land was held by a lord in the Low Countries, the amount held was smaller in comparison to other countries.&lt;ref name="Price"&gt;{{Cite book|author=J.L. Price|title=Dutch Society 1588-1713}} pp. 174, 211, 212&lt;/ref&gt;

Lordship conferred a set of manorial rights. The word ''heerlijkheid'' denotes an estate in which these limited rights were held and could be exercised. The rights exercised varied widely, and were more extensive and survived longer in the eastern provinces.&lt;ref name="Schama PL"/&gt; A manorial lord was able to function as a minor potentate within "his" ''heerlijkheid''. However, his manorial rights were limited and subject to numerous restrictions.&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; The lord was required to conduct himself in accordance with local customary law.

* '''Appointments''': One of the most important manorial rights was the right to appoint bailiffs, reeves, aldermen, magistrates, schoolmasters, dike and polder officials, and so on.&lt;ref name="Schama PL"/&gt; A fee was paid by the recipients of these appointments. In particular, the lord was entitled to make the important appointment of the ''[[schout]]'' ‘reeve’. The reeve was charged with local administrative, law enforcement, and prosecutorial duties. The lord's right to appoint this official was significant because it entailed the associated right to receive the profits from [[amercement]]s collected by the reeve from sentences and fines for minor and mid-level offences. (Higher fines were paid to officials appointed by a count or duke, i.e. the sheriff, called variously ''hoofdschout'', ''hoofdmeier'', ''drossaard'' or ''amman''). The lord of the manor was entitled to act as reeve himself, but most lords delegated this duty by appointing someone else to the office.
* '''Advowson''': A lord might have a right to make [[advowson]]s, be they collative (''collatie''), presentative (''gezag'') or donative (''agrement'')&lt;ref name="Schama PL"/&gt; when it comes to instituting a parish priest or minister. As early as the high Middle Ages there were already disputes with ecclesiastical authorities over the [[usurpation]] of this right. After the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the involvement of a lord in a minister's institution might similarly result in tension between the lord and his vassals, particularly in places where the lord was of a different faith than most of his fellow parishioners.
* '''Manor house''': Most ''heerlijkheden'' had a [[manor house]] that served as the ''caput'', or ‘capital messuage’, of the lord, though not necessarily his permanent residence if he held multiple manors. There were sometimes grand homes with estates or even castles. (Some of these grand homes and castles still exist.)
* '''Church''': If a parochial church had been founded by a previous lord, the lord was considered to have his own church and enjoy the rights that went with that.
* '''Coat of arms''': A lord had his own [[coat of arms]], which was displayed in places like church pews and windows and carriages.&lt;ref name="Schama PL"/&gt; Many of these became municipal coats of arms.

==Income from a heerlijkheid==
A lord was entitled to receive feudal incidents in the form of rents, levies, and other payments from various financial and property rights associated with a ''heerlijkheid'':

* '''Real burdens''' (''onroerende belastingen''): Any bonded or unfree feuar (''cijnsplichtige'') of the manor's dependent holdings was required to pay a yearly feu-duty (''cijns'' or ''cijnsgeld''), which is comparable to the payment of property taxes today.&lt;ref name="Nicholas"/&gt; The amount of the ''cijns'' was proportional to the size of the burdened land. Since the amount of the ''cijns'' was not tied to inflation, it remained negligible during most of this period.
* '''Tenurial rents''' (''pachtgelden''): The largest revenue source for the lord of the manor was usually the leasehold rents from [[tenant farmer]]s working free peasant land.
* '''Entry fine''' (''pontpenning'' or ''werfschilling''): The lord of the manor was entitled to levy a fee of around 5% of the sales price when holdings or tenancies were conveyed.
* '''[[Feudal relief|Relief]]''' (''keurmede''): Usually the lord was entitled to levy a relief duty or [[heriot]] which was sometimes referred to in Dutch as the ''recht van de dode hand'', or ‘dead hand right’. This was an inheritance tax on a deceased tenant’s estate that granted the privilege to an heir to succeed to the deceased’s estate. The amount was usually in the order of 5% of the value of the real property. Sometimes the lord also had the right to take the deceased’s best chattel (''beste kateil/katell''). Depending on the region, this was also referred to as the ‘best beast’ (''beste hoofd''), referring to the best animal in the herd, or the ‘high chair’ (''hoogstoel''), meaning the nicest piece of household furniture. Often there was also a special relief for the estate of a ‘foreigner’ (''inwijkeling''), that is, someone not born in the ''heerlijkheid'', and illegitimate children.
* '''Tolls''' (''tolgelden''): [[Toll road|Tolls]] were charged to cross the borders of most ''heerlijkheden''. This was a kind of [[road toll (historic)|road toll]] (''wegentol''), but it also took the form of a charge on the transport of specific commodities (e.g. salt) or people.
* '''Astrictions''' (''banrechten''): Tenants were required to make use of the infrastructure (mill, smith, oven, etc.) that was operated by the lord of the manor more or less as a business. A typical example of these [[Serfdom#The serf's duties|astrictions]] was [[thirlage]] (''banmolen''): grain could only be ground at the lord's water mill or windmill. A toll, known as multure, for grinding corn at the manorial mill was paid to the lord (or to the miller who leased the mill from the lord).
* '''Royal privileges''' (''vorstelijke rechten''): Royal privileges included [[game rights]], [[hunting rights]], [[wind rights]] (''windrecht''), piscary (''visrecht''), and [[market right]]s (''marktrecht''). These traditional rights were usually granted in fief to a vassal lord, who continued to maintain them.
* '''[[Ecclesiastical privileges]]''' (''kerkelijke rechten''): In some ''heerlijkheden'' certain privileges that were in principle held by the church were absorbed by the ''heerlijkheid''. [[Tithes]] might accrue to the feudal estate.
* '''Fines''' (described in the previous part in the section on the appointment of the ''schout'')
* '''[[Quitrent]]''' (''dienstgeld''):&lt;ref name="Schama PL"/&gt; Released a tenant from services due by custom to his lord.
* '''Appointment fee''' (referred to by Schama as the ''leenrecht''): "The perquisite paid on appointment to office."&lt;ref name="Schama PL"/&gt;
* '''Marriage and death duties''': Marriage required the payment of a fee, the consent of the lord, [[merchet]], etc. In some places in later years the lord would receive gifts on [[Saint Walpurga|St. Walpurga's Day]] instead.&lt;ref name="Schama PL"/&gt; On death a tax also had to be paid.&lt;ref name="Nicholas"/&gt;

==Heerlijkheden and the nobility==
Originally ''heerlijkheden'' were in the hands of the [[List of Dutch noble families|nobility]]. Much of the wealth of a noble family came from their ownership. Many members of the nobiilty were heavily dependent on this source of power, income and status. Because the surnames of noble families were often derived from a ''heerlijkheid'' (e.g. "van [[Wassenaar|Wassenaer]]"), it was important for the prestige of the family to maintain ownership over it. However, the economic benefits of a heerlijkheid were not always certain, finances were not always well arranged, and some nobles were poor.&lt;ref name="Nicholas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt;

In the province of [[Holland]], possession of a ''heerlijkheid'' was a prerequisite for admission to the ''ridderschap'' (literally, the "knighthood"), the college of nobles that represented rural areas in the States of Holland. A seat in the ''ridderschap'' provided access to various financially interesting honorary positions and offices.

It was not unusual for a noble to amass a number of ''heerlijkheden''.&lt;ref name="Janse"/&gt; [[Queen Beatrix]] is a modern-day example of a noblewoman who holds the titles to many ''heerlijkheden''. In addition to her primary titles, she is the Erfvrouwe and Vrijvrouwe of Ameland and the Vrouwe of Baarn, Besançon, Borculo, Bredevoort, Bütgenbach, Daasburg, Geertruidenberg, Heiloo, Upper and Lower Zwaluwe, Klundert, Lichtenvoorde, Loo, Montfort, Naaldwijk, Niervaart, Polanen, Steenbergen, Sint Maartensdijk, Sint Vith, Soest, Ter Eem, Turnhout, Willemstad and Zevenbergen.

Starting around 1500, nobles began selling the rights to ''heerlijkheden'' to non-nobles; however, losing a ''heerlijkheid'' did not result in loss of noble status. The [[List of Dutch noble families|nobility]] were recognised by all as having a special status not attached to wealth or ownership of a ''heerlijkheid''.

==Heerlijkheden and the rise of a new nobility==
In the southern provinces (modern-day [[Belgium]]) the financial character of a ''heerlijkheid'' was accentuated by the Royal Edict of 8 May 1664. From then on, a noble title was granted only if the following minimum payment was obtained from the income of the feudal estate.

* for a [[feudal barony|barony]] (''baronie''): 6,000 guilders;
* for a [[county]] (''graafschap'') or marquisate (''markizaat''): 12,000 guilders;
* for a [[duchy]] (''hertogdom'') or principality (''prinsdom''): 24,000 guilders.

In the southern provinces, this edict ensured the financial stability of the most prominent ''heerlijkheden'' and resulted in the rise of a new nobility based on wealth.

Starting around the 16th century, lordship over a ''heerlijkheid'' was not synonymous with nobility. A ''heerlijkheid'' could be bought and sold. Many ended up in the hands of wealthy merchants and a small and exclusive political class known as the [[regenten|regents]]. In all the provinces the military obligations associated with a fief gradually died out so that by the 16th and 17th centuries the ''heerlijkheid'' was increasingly seen by non-nobles as a status symbol.

Successful merchants and regents from the large towns saw the ''heerlijkheid'' as a country residence and a means of giving the appearance of noble status. It often came with large tracts of land and a castle or manor house. In noble fashion, they then added the name of their ''heerlijkheid'' to their own surname, resulting in surnames like Deutz van Assendelft, Six van Oterleek, Pompe van Meerdervoort and Beelaerts van Blokland). (The word "[[Van (Dutch)|van]]" in the surname meant "of". However, very few Dutch surnames with "van" have their origins in the ownership of a ''heerlijkheid''.) They became what J.L. Price refers to as a "quasi-nobility". A ''heerlijkheid'' was also a source of income and an investment, but they were usually acquired for other reasons.&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt;

In the Netherlands, acquiring the rights to ''heerlijkheden'' did not confer noble status. The regent families who purchased ''heerlijkheden'' were not a true nobility, but by the early 19th century the ranks of the nobility had become so depleted that the Dutch king elevated certain members of the former regent class to noble status.)&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt;

==Abolition==
In the southern provinces (modern-day [[Belgium]]) ''heerlijkheden'' and the associated rights were abolished after the French invasion of 1795. In the northern provinces (modern-day [[Netherlands]]) they were declared abolished around the same time as part of the inauguration of the [[Batavian Republic]]. This was formalised in the 1798 Batavian Constitution (Bataafsche Staatsregeling). A distinction was made between the feudal rights of appointment and patronage, which were completely abolished, and the income-related rights, which were more complicated. Some of these were feudal in nature and abolished. Others were similar to contractual or property rights and therefore their loss was compensable. Lordly claims for reparations flooded in. Some ''heerlijkheid'' rights were maintained or later restored as property rights and still exist today.&lt;ref name="Schama PL"/&gt;

The overwhelming majority of the remaining rights disappeared in Belgium on the introduction of the 1830 constitution and in the Netherlands with the 1848 constitutional amendments. Most of the administrative functions of a ''heerlijkheid'' were transferred to the [[Municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] and fell under the new Municipality Act (''Gemeentewet''). Responsibility for the manor courts and judicial system were taken over by the national government.

After this, the use of the title "Lord of..." is based on the ownership of the remaining non-abolished rights. To this day there are people in the Netherlands who use the title "Lord of...". Unlike in the U.K., there is no trade today in ‘lord of the manor’ titles.

==Heerlijkheid manors==
[[Image:Slot-heemstede-text.jpg|thumb|Sign outside of former side of Heemstede Castle]]
What remains of the ''heerlijkheid'' system are many of the manors and [[List of castles in the Netherlands|castles]]. Most of them are now parts of estates, museums, parks, hotels, etc. Since the last ''heerlijkheid'' was seen over 200 years ago, many of the manor houses and castles have been rebuilt, or have been fully or partially demolished.

A sign erected at the remaining parts of the [[Slot Heemstede]] (now in a park) describes what happened to this particular manor. The history and fate of this manor are typical:

{{cquote|On this spot stood Heemstede House or Castle. It was first built by Dirk van Hoylede in 1280, who came from the Vlaardingen area. The ambachtsheerlijkheid of Heemstede was enfeoffed to him by Count Floris V. From then on Dirk van Hoylede and his descendants used the surname 'van Heemstede'. The house was destroyed a couple of times and then rebuilt. In 1620 Amsterdam merchant (and later Grand Pensionary) Adriaen Pauw purchased the heerlijkheid, including its dilapidated castle. After restoration and embellishment, it became a Renaissance summer mansion. As the negotiator for the States of Holland, he played an important role in the 1648 Peace of Munster that ended the Eighty Year War with Spain. As a memorial to this, he replaced the wooden access bridge with the Vredesbrug or Pons Pacis ('Peace Bridge'). By 1811, the house had become dilapidated again, at which time it was demolished with the exception of the 1640 'Nederhuys' ('Lower House'), consisting of the current Old Mansion, the Peace Bridge and the Dove Gate. The form and measurements (40x25 meter) of the island on which you now stand are identical to the plan for the 1645 mansion.}}

'''Internet privacy''' involves the right or mandate of personal [[privacy]] concerning the storing, repurposing, provision to third parties, and displaying information pertaining to oneself via of  the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20170329a"&gt;{{cite news |author=The Editorial Board |title=Republicans Attack Internet Privacy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/opinion/republicans-attack-internet-privacy.html |date=March 29, 2017 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=March 29, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20170329b"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wheeler |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Wheeler |title=How the Republicans Sold Your Privacy to Internet Providers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/opinion/how-the-republicans-sold-your-privacy-to-internet-providers.html |date=March 29, 2017 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=March 29, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet privacy is a subset of [[data privacy]]. Privacy concerns have been articulated from the beginnings of large-scale computer sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.multicians.org/fjcc6.html |author1=E. E. David |author2=R. M. Fano |title=Some Thoughts About the Social Implications of Accessible Computing. Proceedings 1965 Fall Joint Computer Conference |year=1965 |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Privacy can entail either ''[[Personally identifiable information|Personally Identifying Information]]'' (PII) or non-PII information such as a site visitor's behavior on a website.  PII refers to any information that can be used to identify an individual.  For example, age and [[physical address]] alone could identify who an individual is without explicitly disclosing their name, as these two factors are unique enough to  identify a specific person typically.

Some experts such as Steve Rambam, a private investigator specializing in Internet privacy cases, believe that privacy no longer exists; saying, "Privacy is dead – get over it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaYn_PkrfvQ |title=Steve Rambam – Privacy Is Dead – Get Over It at The Next HOPE, July 16-18, 2010 in New York City |publisher=youtube.com | accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it has been suggested that the "appeal of online services is to broadcast personal information on purpose."&lt;ref name="Pogue"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pogue |first=David |date=January 2011 |title=Don't Worry about Who's watching |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=304 |issue=1 |page=32 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=dont-worry-about-whos-watching |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0111-32}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in his essay ''The Value of Privacy,'' security expert [[Bruce Schneier]] says, "Privacy protects us from abuses by those in power, even if we're doing nothing wrong at the time of [[surveillance]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/05/the_value_of_pr.html |title=The Value of Privacy by Bruce Schneier |publisher=Schneier.com |accessdate=2015-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bruce Schneier |url=http://archive.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2006/05/70886 |title=The Eternal Value of Privacy by Bruce Schneier |publisher=Wired.com |date=May 18, 2006 |accessdate=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Levels of privacy==

Internet and [[digital privacy]] are viewed differently from traditional expectations of privacy. Internet privacy is primarily concerned with protecting user information. Law Professor Jerry Kang explains that the term privacy expresses space, decision, and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kang|first=Jerry|date=1998-01-01|title=Information Privacy in Cyberspace Transactions|jstor=1229286|journal=Stanford Law Review|volume=50|issue=4|pages=1193–1294|doi=10.2307/1229286}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of space, individuals have an expectation that their physical spaces (i.e. homes, cars) not be intruded. Privacy within the realm of decision is best illustrated by the landmark case ''[[Roe v. Wade]].'' Lastly, information privacy is in regards to the collection of user information from a variety of sources, which produces great discussion.

The 1997 Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF) created under [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] defined information privacy as "an individual's claim to control the terms under which personal information--information identifiable to the individual--is acquired, disclosed, and used."[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1229286?origin=crossref] At the end of the 1990s, with the rise of the Internet, it became clear that the internet and companies would need to abide by new rules to protect individual's privacy. With the rise of the internet and mobile networks the salience of internet privacy is a daily concern for users.

People with only a casual concern for Internet privacy need not achieve total [[anonymity]]. Internet users may protect their privacy through controlled disclosure of personal information. The revelation of IP addresses, non-personally-identifiable profiling, and similar information might become acceptable trade-offs for the convenience that users could otherwise lose using the workarounds needed to suppress such details rigorously. On the other hand, some people desire much stronger privacy. In that case, they may try to achieve ''Internet anonymity'' to ensure privacy — use of the Internet without giving any third parties the ability to link the Internet activities to personally-identifiable information of the Internet user. In order to keep their information private, people need to be careful with what they submit to and look at online. When filling out forms and buying merchandise, that becomes tracked and because the information was not private, some companies are now sending Internet users spam and advertising on similar products.

There are also several governmental organizations that protect individual's privacy and anonymity on the Internet, to a point. In an article presented by the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]], in October 2011, a number of pointers were brought to attention that helps an individual internet user avoid possible [[identity theft]] and other cyber-attacks. Preventing or limiting the usage of Social Security numbers online, being wary and respectful of emails including spam messages, being mindful of personal financial details, creating and managing strong passwords, and intelligent web-browsing behaviours are recommended, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onguardonline.gov/blog/preventing-identity-theft-and-other-cyber-crimes|title=Preventing Identity Theft and Other Cyber Crimes|work=onguardonline.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Posting things on the Internet can be harmful or in danger of malicious attack. Some information posted on the Internet is permanent, depending on the terms of service, and [[privacy policies]] of particular services offered online. This can include comments written on blogs, pictures, and Internet sites, such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. It is absorbed into cyberspace and once it is posted, anyone can potentially find it and access it. Some employers may research a potential employee by searching online for the details of their online behaviours, possibly affecting the outcome of the success of the candidate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atg.wa.gov/InternetSafety/FamiliesAndEducators.aspx No Author. Washington State Office of the Attorney General. (2008). Families and Educators: Information is Permanent.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005203739/http://www.atg.wa.gov/InternetSafety/FamiliesAndEducators.aspx |date=2011-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks to Internet privacy==
Companies are hired to watch what internet sites people visit, and then use the information, for instance by sending advertising based on one's [[browsing history]]. There are many ways in which people can divulge their personal information, for instance by use of "[[social media]]" and by sending bank and credit card information to various websites. Moreover, directly observed behaviour, such as browsing logs, search queries, or contents of the Facebook profile can be automatically processed to infer potentially more intrusive details about an individual, such as sexual orientation, political and religious views, race, substance use, intelligence, and personality.&lt;ref name=NAS-V110-I15&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kosinski |first=Michal |author2=Stillwell, D. |author3=Graepel, T. |title=Private traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of human behavior |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |year=2013 |volume=110 |issue=15 |pages=5802–5805 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/15/5802.full.pdf+html |doi=10.1073/pnas.1218772110 |pmid=23479631 |pmc=3625324}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, even without any historical behavioural data, there are a large number of insights which can be generated solely by tracking onsite user interaction like post code, name and local address.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.robert-matthees.de/ecommerce/cross-device-tracking/|title=Cross-Device Tracking: Advanced Client ID/Fingerprint User Identification|last=Matthees|first=Robert|website=www.robert-matthees.de|language=en|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those concerned about Internet privacy often cite a number of ''privacy risks'' — events that can compromise privacy — which may be encountered through Internet use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Matt Schafer |title=Privacy, Privacy, Where for Art Thou Privacy? |quote=As consumers have become wise to the use of cookies, however, the industry has began using both normal cookies and local shared objects (a.k.a. flash cookies) in the event that users would delete the normal cookies. |publisher=Lippmannwouldroll.com |date=August 2, 2010 |url=http://lippmannwouldroll.com/2010/08/02/privacy-privacy-where-for-art-thou-privacy/ |accessdate=October 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018071436/http://lippmannwouldroll.com/2010/08/02/privacy-privacy-where-for-art-thou-privacy/ |archivedate=October 18, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These range from the gathering of statistics on users to more malicious acts such as the spreading of spyware and the exploitation of various forms of [[Software bug|bugs]] (software faults).

Several social networking sites try to protect the personal information of their subscribers. On Facebook, for example, privacy settings are available to all registered users: they can block certain individuals from seeing their profile, they can choose their "friends", and they can limit who has access to one's pictures and videos. Privacy settings are also available on other social networking sites such as Google Plus and Twitter. The user can apply such settings when providing personal information on the internet.

In late 2007 Facebook launched the Beacon program where user rental records were released on the public for friends to see. Many people were enraged by this breach in privacy, and the ''[[Lane v. Facebook, Inc.]]'' case ensued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Grimmelmann |first=James |title=Saving Facebook |url=http://works.bepress.com/james_grimmelmann/20/ |work=Iowa Law Review |pages=1137–1206 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children and adolescents often use the Internet (including social media) in ways which risk their privacy: a cause for growing concern among parents. Young people also may not realise that all their information and browsing can and may be tracked while visiting a particular site, and that it is up to them to protect their own privacy. They must be informed about all these risks. For example, on Twitter, threats include shortened links that lead one to potentially harmful places. In their email inbox, threats include email scams and attachments that get them to install malware and disclose personal information. On Torrent sites, threats include malware hiding in video, music, and software downloads. Even when using a smartphone, threats include geolocation, meaning that one's phone can detect where they are and post it online for all to see. Users can protect themselves by updating virus protection, using security settings, downloading patches, installing a firewall, screening email, shutting down spyware, controlling [[HTTP cookie|cookies]], using encryption, fending off browser hijackers, and blocking pop-ups.&lt;ref&gt;Mediati, N. (2010). The Most Dangerous Places on the Web. PC World, 28(11), 72–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Youn |first=S. |year=2009 |title=Determinants of Online Privacy Concern and Its Influence on Privacy Protection Behaviors Among Young Adolescents |journal=Journal of Consumer Affairs |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=389–418 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-6606.2009.01146.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However most people have little idea how to go about doing many of these things. How can the average user with no training be expected to know how to run their own network security (especially as things are getting more complicated all the time)? Many businesses hire professionals to take care of these issues, but most individuals can only do their best to learn about all this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Larose |first=R. |last2=Rifon |first2=N. J. |year=2007 |title=Promoting i-Safety: Effects of Privacy Warnings and Privacy Seals on Risk Assessment and Online Privacy Behavior |journal=Journal of Consumer Affairs |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=127–149 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-6606.2006.00071.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the Federal Trade Commission in the USA considered the lack of privacy for children on the Internet, and created the Children Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). COPPA limits the options which gather information from children and created warning labels if potential harmful information or content was presented. In 2000, Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) was developed to implement safe Internet policies such as rules{{clarify|date=July 2013}}, and filter software. These laws, awareness campaigns, parental and adult supervision strategies and Internet filters can all help to make the Internet safer for children around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Valcke |first=M. |last2=De Wever |first2=B. |last3=Van Keer |first3=H. |last4=Schellens |first4=T. |title=Long-term study of safe Internet use of young children |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131511000273 |journal=Computers &amp; Education |volume=57 |issue=1 |doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2011.01.010 |year=2011 |pages=1292–1305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The privacy concerns of Internet users pose a serious challenge (Dunkan, 1996; Till, 1997). In an online survey conducted, approximately seven out of ten individuals responded that what worries them most is their privacy over the Internet than over the mail or phone. Internet privacy is slowly but surely becoming a threat, as a person's personal data may slip into the wrong hands if passed around through the Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larose|first=Robert|last2=ChoI|first2=Hyunyi|date=November 1, 1999|title=Privacy Issues in Internet Surveys|journal=Social Science Computer Review|volume=17|issue=9|pages=421–434|doi=10.1177/089443939901700402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HTTP cookies===
{{Main|HTTP cookie}}
An [[HTTP cookie]] is data stored on a user's computer that assists in automated access to websites or web features, or other [[State (computer science)|state]] information required in complex web sites.  It may also be used for user-tracking by storing special usage history data in a cookie, and such cookies—for example, those used by [[Google Analytics]]—are called ''tracking cookies''. Cookies are a common concern in the field of [[Google Analytics|Internet privacy]]. Although website developers most commonly use cookies for legitimate technical purposes, cases of abuse occur. In 2009, two researchers noted that social networking profiles could be connected to cookies, allowing the social networking profile to be connected to browsing habits.&lt;ref&gt;Krishnamurthy B, Wills CE. (2009). [http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2009/workshops/wosn/papers/p7.pdf On the Leakage of Personally Identifiable Information Via Online Social Networks].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, web sites have not generally made the user explicitly aware of the storing of cookies, however '''tracking cookies''' and especially '''third-party tracking cookies''' are commonly used as ways to compile long-term records of individuals' browsing histories — a [[Internet privacy#HTTP cookies|privacy concern]] that prompted European and US lawmakers to take action in 2011.&lt;ref name="eulaw"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12668552 |work=BBC |title=New net rules set to make cookies crumble |date=2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adage.com/article/digital/sen-rockefeller-ready-a-real-track-bill/227426/ |work=Adage.com |title=Sen. Rockefeller: Get Ready for a Real Do-Not-Track Bill for Online Advertising |date=2011-05-06 |author=Edmond Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cookies can also have implications for [[computer forensics]]. In past years, most computer users were not completely aware of cookies, but recently, users have become conscious of possible detrimental effects of Internet cookies: a recent study done has shown that 58% of users have at least once, deleted cookies from their computer, and that 39% of users delete cookies from their computer every month. Since cookies are advertisers' main way of targeting potential customers, and some customers are deleting cookies, some advertisers started to use persistent [[Internet privacy#Flash cookies|Flash cookies]] and [[zombie cookies]], but modern browsers and anti-malware software can now block or detect and remove such cookies.&lt;!-- United Virtualities has built a substitute: PIE (persistent identification element). PIEs unlike cookies, cannot be easily deleted or detected and can reinstate any deleted cookie. PIEs also hold a sufficient amount more data than a cookie can. If a website is connected to a PIE, then one's browser will be marked with a Flash object. This is very alike to the process of a cookie.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} --&gt;

The original developers of cookies intended that only the website that originally distributed cookies to users could retrieve them, therefore returning only data already possessed by the website. However, in practice programmers can circumvent this restriction. Possible consequences include:
* the placing of a personally-identifiable tag in a browser to facilitate [[web profiling]] (see below), or,
* use of [[cross-site scripting]] or other techniques to steal information from a user's cookies.

Cookies do have benefits that many people may not know. One benefit is that for websites that one frequently visits that require a password, cookies make it so they do not have to sign in every time. A cookie can also track one's preferences to show them websites that might interest them. Cookies make more websites free to use without any type of payment. Some of these benefits are also seen as negative. For example, one of the most common ways of theft is hackers taking one's username and password that a cookie saves. While a lot of sites are free, they have to make a profit somehow so they sell their space to advertisers. These ads, which are personalized to one's likes, can often freeze one's computer or cause annoyance. Cookies are mostly harmless except for third-party cookies.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=14&amp;hid=106&amp;sid=1d665348-3f95-431a-8b34-490220a8407f%40sessionmgr115&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=17039447&lt;/ref&gt; These cookies are not made by the website itself, but by web banner advertising companies. These third-party cookies are so dangerous because they take the same information that regular cookies do, such as browsing habits and frequently visited websites, but then they give out this information to other companies.

Cookies are often associated with pop-up windows because these windows are often, but not always, tailored to a person's preferences. These windows are an irritation because they are often hard to close out of because the close button is strategically hidden in an unlikely part of the screen. In the worst cases, these pop-up ads can take over the screen and while trying to exit out of it, can take one to another unwanted website.

Cookies are seen so negatively because they are not understood and go unnoticed while someone is simply surfing the Internet. The idea that every move one makes while on the Internet is being watched, would frighten most users.

Some users choose to disable cookies in their web browsers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2000/Trust-and-Privacy-Online/Summary/Findings.aspx Trust and Privacy Online: Why Americans Want to Rewrite the Rules. Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project. Released Aug. 20, 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113003519/http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2000/Trust-and-Privacy-Online/Summary/Findings.aspx |date=2012-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an action can reduce some privacy risks, but may severely limit or prevent the functionality of many websites. All significant web browsers have this disabling ability built-in, with no external program required. As an alternative, users may frequently delete any stored cookies. Some browsers (such as [[Mozilla Firefox]] and [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]]) offer the option to clear cookies automatically whenever the user closes the browser. A third option involves allowing cookies in general, but preventing their abuse. There are also a host of wrapper applications that will redirect cookies and cache data to some other location. Concerns exist that the privacy benefits of deleting cookies have been over-stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.danieldent.com/blog/six-internet-privacy-myths/|title=Six Common Internet Privacy Myths|work=Daniel Dent|date=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of ''profiling'' (also known as "tracking") assembles and analyzes several events, each attributable to a single originating entity, in order to gain information (especially patterns of activity) relating to the originating entity. Some organizations engage in the profiling of people's web browsing, collecting the [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]s of sites visited. The resulting profiles can potentially link with information that personally identifies the individual who did the browsing.

Some web-oriented marketing-research organizations may use this practice legitimately, for example: in order to construct profiles of 'typical Internet users'. Such profiles, which describe average trends of large groups of Internet users rather than of actual individuals, can then prove useful for [[market analysis]]. Although the aggregate data does not constitute a privacy violation, some people believe that the initial profiling does.

Profiling becomes a more contentious privacy issue when data-matching associates the profile of an individual with personally-identifiable information of the individual.
&lt;!-- TODO: Elaborate. Inability of individuals to review or correct false info about themselves. Reselling of the data. Concerns about undesirable uses to which this info is applied (eg, spamming and junk mail). --&gt;

Governments and organizations may set up [[Honeypot (computing)|honeypot]] websites – featuring controversial topics – with the purpose of attracting and tracking unwary people. This constitutes a potential danger for individuals.
&lt;!-- Fix above para --&gt;

===Flash cookies===
{{Main|Local shared object}}
When some users choose to disable [[HTTP cookie]] to reduce privacy risks as noted, new types of cookies were invented: since cookies are advertisers' main way of targeting potential customers, and some customers were deleting cookies, some advertisers started to use persistent Flash cookies and [[Internet privacy#Evercookies|zombie cookies]]. In a 2009 study, Flash cookies were found to be a popular mechanism for storing data on the top 100 most visited sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Soltani |first=Ashkan |title=Flash Cookies and Privacy |url=http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS10/paper/download/1070/1505 |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2011 study of social media found that, “Of the top 100 web sites, 31 had at least one overlap between HTTP and Flash cookies.”&lt;ref name="Heyman, R. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heyman | first1 = R. | last2 = Pierson | first2 = J. | year = 2011 | title = Social media and cookies: challenges for online privacy | url = | journal = The Journal of Policy, Regulation and Strategy for Telecommunications, Information and Media | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 30–42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern browsers and anti-malware software can now block or detect and remove such cookies.&lt;!-- Firms such as United Virtualities implemented "Zombie cookies" after they learned that 30% of internet users were deleting HTTP cookies. The zombie cookie, also known as a Persistent Identification Element (PIE) is tagged to the user’s browser, providing each with a unique ID, similar to traditional cookie coding. The PIE is made up of two cookies. Essentially, the first is an HTTP cookie and the second is the flash cookie. This suggests that the zombie cookie or PIE cannot be easily deleted, since users typically remove html cookies. &lt;ref name="Heyman, R. 2011"/&gt; This study shows how the two different types of cookies commonly exist in popular visited websites. For the users who choose to disable HTTP cookie, flash cookies could very well still exist if the two cookies overlap for a specific visited website. --&gt;

Flash cookies, also known as [[Local Shared Object]]s, work the same ways as normal cookies and are used by the [[Adobe Flash Player]] to store information at the user's computer. They exhibit a similar privacy risk as normal cookies, but are not as easily blocked, meaning that the option in most browsers to not accept cookies does not affect Flash cookies. One way to view and control them is with browser extensions or add-ons. 
&lt;!-- More information should be posted on flash cookies and how they impact users' privacy --&gt;
Flash cookies are unlike HTTP cookies in a sense that they are not transferred from the client back to the server. Web browsers read and write these cookies and can track any data by web usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Benninger |first=Corey |title=A Look At Flash Cookies and Internet Explorer Persistence |url=http://www.foundstone.com.au/us/resources/white-papers/foundstone/wp-ajax-storage.pdf |publisher=McAfee, Inc. |accessdate=3 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617200101/http://www.foundstone.com.au/us/resources/white-papers/foundstone/wp-ajax-storage.pdf |archive-date=2012-06-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although browsers such as Internet Explorer 8 and Firefox 3 have added a ‘Privacy Browsing’ setting, they still allow Flash cookies to track the user and operate fully. However, the Flash player browser plugin can be disabled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electrictoolbox.com/disable-flash-firefox/|title=How to disable Flash in Firefox|work=electrictoolbox.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or uninstalled,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/alternates/|title=Adobe - Web Players|work=adobe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adobe Flash Player#Privacy|Flash cookies can be disabled on a per-site or global basis]]. Adobe's Flash and (PDF) Reader are not the only browser plugins whose past [[Internet security|security]] defects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/support/security/|title=Security Bulletins and Advisories|work=adobe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; have allowed [[spyware]] or [[malware]] to be installed: there have also been problems with Oracle's Java.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alert-cve-2012-4681-1835715.html|title=Alert for CVE-2012-4681|work=oracle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- User privacy controls have a hard time blocking flash cookies because they are so flexible. --&gt;

===Evercookies===
{{Main|Zombie cookie|Evercookie}}
[[Evercookie]]s, created by [[Samy Kamkar]],&lt;ref name=evercookie&gt;{{cite news |title=Apple, Google Collect User Data |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703983704576277101723453610 |accessdate=26 May 2014 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=April 22, 2011 |author=Julia Angwin |author2=Jennifer Valentino-DeVries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Evercookie' is one cookie you don't want to bite |url=http://technolog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/09/22/5157641-evercookie-is-one-cookie-you-dont-want-to-bite |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223153605/http://technolog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/09/22/5157641-evercookie-is-one-cookie-you-dont-want-to-bite |archivedate=2011-12-23 |date=September 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are JavaScript-based applications which produce cookies in a web browser that actively "resist" deletion by redundantly copying themselves in different forms on the user's machine (e.g., Flash Local Shared Objects, various HTML5 storage mechanisms, window.name caching, etc.), and resurrecting copies that are missing or expired. Evercookie accomplishes this by storing the cookie data in several types of storage mechanisms that are available on the local browser. It has the ability to store cookies in over ten types of storage mechanisms so that once they are on one's computer they will never be gone. Additionally, if evercookie has found the user has removed any of the types of cookies in question, it recreates them using each mechanism available.&lt;ref&gt;schneier&lt;/ref&gt; Evercookies are one type of [[zombie cookie]].  However, modern browsers and anti-malware software can now block or detect and remove such cookies.

====Anti-fraud uses====
Some anti-fraud companies have realized the potential of evercookies to protect against and catch cyber criminals. These companies already hide small files in several places on the perpetrator's computer but hackers can usually easily get rid of these. The advantage to evercookies is that they resist deletion and can rebuild themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gitbook.com/book/ipmenorla/personal-information-gathering-sites/details|title=Personal information gathering sites · GitBook|website=GitBook|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321130710/https://www.gitbook.com/book/ipmenorla/personal-information-gathering-sites/details|archive-date=2018-03-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advertising uses====
There is controversy over where the line should be drawn on the use of this technology. Cookies store unique identifiers on a person's computer that are used to predict what one wants. Many advertisement companies want to use this technology to track what their customers are looking at online. [[Evercookie]]s enable advertisers to continue to track a customer regardless of if one deletes their cookies or not. Some companies are already using this technology but the ethics are still being widely debated.&lt;!-- This paragraph as well as the one previous lacks any citations  --&gt;

====Criticism====
Anonymizer nevercookies are part of a free Firefox plugin that protects against evercookies. This plugin extends Firefox's private browsing mode so that users will be completely protected from evercookies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.securityweek.com/nevercookie-eats-evercookie-new-firefox-plugin Nevercookie Eats Evercookie With New Firefox Plugin].

===Device fingerprinting===
{{main|Device fingerprinting}}
{{Cleanup section|reason=Some contents are outdated and details would be better suited for the main page about this topic|date=July 2018}}
[[Device fingerprinting]] is a fairly new technology that is useful in fraud prevention and safeguarding any information from one's computer. Device fingerprinting uses data from the device and browser sessions to determine the risk of conducting business with the person using the device.&lt;ref name="networkworld.com"&gt;[http://www.networkworld.com/newsletters/2009/042009bestpractices.html Device fingerprinting defends against online fraud]. Networkworld.com (2009-04-20). Retrieved on 2013-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt; This technology allows companies to better assess the risks when business is conducted through sites that include, e-commerce sites, social networking and online dating sites and banks and other financial institutions. ThreatMetrix is one of the leading vendors of device fingerprinting. This company employs a number of techniques to prevent fraud. For example, ThreatMetrix will pierce the proxy to determine the true location of a device.&lt;ref name="networkworld.com"/&gt; Due to the growing number of hackers and fraudsters using 'botnets' of millions of computers that are being unknowingly controlled,&lt;ref name="networkworld.com"/&gt; this technology will help not only the companies at risk but the people who are unaware their computers are being used.

It is difficult to surf the web without being tracked by device fingerprinting today. However, for people who do not want device fingerprinting, there are ways to attempt to block fingerprinting. The only ways to stop device fingerprinting cause web browsing to be very slow and websites to display information incorrectly. “There are not convenient options for privacy when it comes to device fingerprinting” said Peter Eckersely a staff scientist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and privacy-advocacy group.  Trying to avoid device fingerprinting is mostly just impractical and inconvenient. Fingerprints are tough to avoid because they are taken from data that are routinely passed from computers to websites automatically. Even if someone changes something slightly, the fingerprinters can still recognize the machine. There is one way to figure out that a device is being fingerprinted. The software JavaScript can be used to collect fingerprinting data. If it asks a browser for specific information, that could be a clue that a fingerprinter is working. Companies that are most known for conducting fingerprinting are advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Valentino-DeVries |first=Jennifer |title=How to Prevent Device Fingerprinting |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2010/11/30/how-to-prevent-device-fingerprinting/ |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=Feb 6, 2012 |date=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sentinel Advanced Detection Analysis and Predator Tracking (A.D.A.P.T.)====

Sentinel Advanced Detection Analysis and Predator Tracking (A.D.A.P.T.) is device fingerprinting software technology that identifies the device (computer, tablet, smartphone, ...) being used to access a website. This information in turn can be used to help differentiate legitimate users from those using false identities or those attempting to work anonymously. A.D.A.P.T. uses only HTTP and JavaScript to identify a device and identifies devices without requesting any personal information entered directly by the user. It makes an accurate “fingerprint” of the device by using many different pieces of information including, operating system, browser, and PC characteristics. A.D.A.P.T. is concealed in that the user of the device has no idea that the device is being “fingerprinted” and there is no actual tagging of the device.&lt;ref name=ADAPT&gt;[https://projectsgeek.com/2018/05/fraud-application-detection-using-data-mining.html Fraud application detection and analysis using data mining ], This application system allows detection of fraud using latest data analysis techniques such as hadoop.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canvas fingerprinting====
[[Canvas fingerprinting]] is one of a number of browser fingerprinting techniques of tracking online users that allow websites to uniquely identify and track visitors using HTML5 canvas element instead of browser cookies or other similar means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/now-sites-can-fingerprint-you-online-even-when-you-use-multiple-browsers/|title=Now sites can fingerprint you online even when you use multiple browsers|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photographs on the Internet===
[[Image:Wikimania impression nophoto.jpg|thumb|'No photos' tag at [[Wikimania]]]]
Today many people have [[digital cameras]] and post their photographs online, for example [[street photography]] practitioners do so for artistic purposes and [[social documentary photography]] practitioners do so to document the common people in everyday life. The people depicted in these photos might not want to have them appear on the Internet. Police arrest photos, considered public record in many jurisdictions, are often posted on the internet by numerous [[Mug shot publishing industry|online mug shot publishing sites]].

Some organizations attempt to respond to this privacy-related concern. For example, the 2005 Wikimania conference required that photographers have the prior permission of the people in their pictures, albeit this made it impossible for photographers to practice [[candid photography]] and doing the same in a public place would violate the photographers' [[free speech]] rights. Some people wore a 'no photos' tag to indicate they would prefer not to have their photo taken.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} {{See above|photo}}

The ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' published a short piece called "In The Face of Danger: Facial Recognition and Privacy Law", much of it explaining how "privacy law, in its current form, is of no help to those unwillingly tagged."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/120/may07/note_4397.php In the Face of Danger: Facial Recognition and the Limits of Privacy Law. (2007). Retrieved from Harvard, Harvard Law Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802122230/http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/120/may07/Note_4397.php |date=2010-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Any individual can be unwillingly tagged in a photo and displayed in a manner that might violate them personally in some way, and by the time Facebook gets to taking down the photo, many people will have already had the chance to view, share, or distribute it. Furthermore, traditional tort law does not protect people who are captured by a photograph in public because this is not counted as an invasion of privacy. The extensive Facebook privacy policy covers these concerns and much more.  For example, the policy states that they reserve the right to disclose member information or share photos with companies, lawyers, courts, government entities, etc. if they feel it absolutely necessary.  The policy also informs users that profile pictures are mainly to help friends connect to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/policy.php|title=Data Policy|work=facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these, as well as other pictures, can allow other people to invade a person's privacy by finding out information that can be used to track and locate a certain individual. In an article featured in ABC News, it was stated that two teams of scientists found out that Hollywood stars could be giving up information about their private whereabouts very easily through pictures uploaded to the Internet.  Moreover, it was found that pictures taken by some phones and tablets including [[iPhone]]s automatically attach the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of the picture taken through [[metadata]] unless this function is manually disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/technology/celebrity-stalking-online-photos-give-location/story?id=11162352&amp;page=1 |title=Celebrities' Photos, Videos May Reveal Location |date=16 July 2010 |publisher=ABC |accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Face recognition technology can be used to gain access to a person's private data, according to a new study. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University combined image scanning, cloud computing and public profiles from social network sites to identify individuals in the offline world. Data captured even included a user's social security number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14386514 |work=BBC News |title=Online photos can reveal our private data say experts |date=August 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts have warned of the privacy risks faced by the increased merging of our online and offline identities. The researchers have also developed an 'augmented reality' mobile app that can display personal data over a person's image captured on a smartphone screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmu.edu/homepage/society/2011/summer/facial-recognition.shtml |title=More Than Facial Recognition – Carnegie Mellon University |publisher=Cmu.edu |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since these technologies are widely available, our future identities may become exposed to anyone with a smartphone and an Internet connection. Researchers believe this could force us to reconsider our future attitudes to privacy.

====Google Street View====
[[Google Street View]], released in the U.S. in 2007, is currently the subject of an ongoing debate about possible infringement on individual privacy.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/nov/29/google-street-view Rodrigues, J. (November 29, 2009). Google Street View’s headaches around the world. ''The Guardian''.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9943140-7.html Shankland, S. (2008, May 13). Google begins blurring faces in Street View. ''CNet News''.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In an article entitled “Privacy, Reconsidered: New Representations, Data Practices, and the Geoweb”, Sarah Elwood and Agnieszka Leszczynski (2011) argue that Google Street View “facilitate[s] identification and disclosure with more immediacy and less abstraction.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elwood | first1 = S. | last2 = Leszczynski | first2 = A. | year = 2011 | title = Privacy, reconsidered: New representations, data practices, and the geoweb | url = | journal = Geoforum | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 6–15 | doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2010.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medium through which [[Street View]] disseminates information, the photograph, is very immediate in the sense that it can potentially provide direct information and evidence about a person's whereabouts, activities, and private property. Moreover, the technology's disclosure of information about a person is less abstract in the sense that, if photographed, a person is represented on Street View in a virtual replication of his or her own real-life appearance. In other words, the technology removes abstractions of a person's appearance or that of his or her personal belongings – there is an immediate disclosure of the person and object, as they visually exist in real life. Although Street View began to blur license plates and people's faces in 2008,&lt;ref name="guardian1" /&gt; the technology is faulty and does not entirely ensure against accidental disclosure of identity and private property.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  Elwood and Leszczynski note that “many of the concerns leveled at Street View stem from situations where its photograph-like images were treated as definitive evidence of an individual’s involvement in particular activities.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;  In one instance, Ruedi Noser, a Swiss politician, barely avoided public scandal when he was photographed in 2009 on Google Street View walking with a woman who was not his wife – the woman was actually his secretary.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt; Similar situations occur when Street View provides high-resolution photographs – and photographs hypothetically offer compelling objective evidence.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;  But as the case of the Swiss politician illustrates, even supposedly compelling photographic evidence is sometimes subject to gross misinterpretation. This example further suggests that Google Street View may provide opportunities for privacy infringement and harassment through public dissemination of the photographs. Google Street View does, however, blur or remove photographs of individuals and private property from image frames if the individuals request further blurring and/or removal of the images. This request can be submitted, for review, through the “report a problem” button that is located on the bottom left-hand side of every image window on Google Street View, however, Google has made attempts to report a problem difficult by disabling the "Why are you reporting the street view" icon.

===Search engines===
{{Main articles|Search engine privacy}}
Search engines have the ability to track a user's searches. Personal information can be revealed through searches by the user's computer, account, or IP address being linked to the search terms used.  Search engines have claimed a necessity to [[Data retention|retain such information]] in order to provide better services, protect against security pressure, and protect against fraud.&lt;ref name="privacyrights.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs18-cyb.htm|title=Online Privacy: Using the Internet Safely - Privacy Rights Clearinghouse|work=privacyrights.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A search engine takes all of its users and assigns each one a specific ID number. Those in control of the database often keep records of where on the Internet each member has traveled to.  AOL's system is one example. AOL has a database 21 million members deep, each with their own specific ID number. The way that AOLSearch is set up, however, allows for AOL to keep records of all the websites visited by any given member. Even though the true identity of the user isn’t known, a full profile of a member can be made just by using the information stored by AOLSearch. By keeping records of what people query through AOLSearch, the company is able to learn a great deal about them without knowing their names.&lt;ref name="AOL's disturbing glimpse into users' lives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1030_3-6103098.html|title=AOL's disturbing glimpse into users' lives|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Search engines also are able to retain user information, such as location and time spent using the search engine, for up to ninety days. Most search engine operators use the data to get a sense of which needs must be met in certain areas of their field. People working in the legal field are also allowed to use information collected from these search engine websites. The Google search engine is given as an example of a search engine that retains the information entered for a period of three-fourths of a year before it becomes obsolete for public usage. Yahoo! follows in the footsteps of Google in the sense that it also deletes user information after a period of ninety days. Other search engines such as Ask! search engine has promoted a tool of "AskEraser" which essentially takes away personal information when requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dye |first=Jessica |title=Consumer Privacy Advocates Seek Search Engine Solution |url=http://0-vnweb.hwwilsonweb.com.sculib.scu.edu/hww/results/getResults.jhtml?_DARGS=/hww/results/results_common.jhtml.35 |publisher=EContent |accessdate=2011-10-20 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some changes made to Internet search engines included that of Google's search engine. Beginning in 2009, Google began to run a new system where the Google search became personalized. The item that is searched and the results that are shown remembers previous information that pertains to the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Babic|first=Filip|date=2013|title=Rethinking Online Privacy Litigation as Google Expands Use of Tracking: Giving Meaning to Our Online Browsing and the Federal Wiretap Act|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/hascom36&amp;i=499|journal=Hastings Communications and Entertainment Law Journal|volume=36|issue=2|pages=471–488|via=BerkeleyLaw Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google search engine not only seeks what is searched, but also strives to allow the user to feel like the search engine recognizes their interests.

Google had publicly stated on January 24, 2012, that its privacy policy will once again be altered.  This new policy will change the following for its users: (1) the privacy policy will become shorter and easier to comprehend and (2) the information that users provide will be used in more ways than it is presently being used.  The goal of Google is to make users’ experiences better than they currently are.&lt;ref&gt;Cain Miller, C. (2012, January 25). A New Policy On Privacy From Google. The New York Times, p. B3&lt;/ref&gt;

This new privacy policy is planned to come into effect on March 1, 2012.  Peter Fleischer, the Global Privacy Counselor for Google, has explained that if a person is logged into his/her Google account, and only if he/she is logged in, information will be gathered from multiple Google services in which he/she has used in order to be more accommodating.  Google's new privacy policy will combine all data used on Google's search engines (i.e., YouTube and Gmail) in order to work along the lines of a person's interests.  A person, in effect, will be able to find what he/she wants at a more efficient rate because all searched information during times of login will help to narrow down new search results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/03/google-privacy-policy_n_1253467.html Steinhauser, G. (2012, February 3). Google's Privacy Policy Changes Prompt EU Probe. ''The Huffington Post'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Google's privacy policy explains information they collect and why they collect it, how they use the information, and how to access and update information. Google will collect information to better service its users such as their language, which ads they find useful or people that are important to them online. Google announces they will use this information to provide, maintain, protect Google and its users. The information Google uses will give users more relevant search results and advertisements. The new privacy policy explains that Google can use shared information on one service in other Google services from people who have a Google account and are logged in. Google will treat a user as a single user across all of their products. Google claims the new privacy policy will benefit its users by being simpler. Google will, for example, be able to correct the spelling of a user's friend's name in a Google search or notify a user they are late based on their calendar and current location. Even though Google is updating their privacy policy, its core privacy guidelines will not change. For example, Google does not sell personal information or share it externally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Miller |first=Claire |title=Google To Update Privacy Policy to Cover Wider Data Use |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/google-to-update-its-privacy-policies-and-terms-of-service/?scp=2&amp;sq=google's%20new%20privacy%20policy&amp;st=cse |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=Feb 6, 2012 |date=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Users and public officials have raised many concerns regarding Google's new privacy policy.  The main concern/issue involves the sharing of data from multiple sources.  Because this policy gathers all information and data searched from multiple engines when logged into Google, and uses it to help assist users, privacy becomes an important element.  Public officials and Google account users are worried about online safety because of all this information being gathered from multiple sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-google-defends-change-to-privacy-policies-20120201,0,3821438.story |title=Reuters.

Some users do not like the overlapping privacy policy, wishing to keep the service of Google separate. The update to Google's privacy policy has alarmed both public and private sectors. The European Union has asked Google to delay the onset of the new privacy policy in order to ensure that it does not violate E.U. law. This move is in accordance with objections to decreasing online privacy raised in other foreign nations where surveillance is more heavily scrutinized.&lt;ref&gt;James Canter, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/04/technology/eu-backs-delay-in-googles-privacy-policy.html "E.U. Presses Google to Delay Privacy Policy Changes"] 'The New York Times,' February 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Canada and Germany have both held investigations into the legality of both Facebook, against respective privacy acts, in 2010. The new privacy policy only heightens unresolved concerns regarding user privacy.&lt;ref&gt;Jay Perry, [http://www.techi.com/2010/05/facebook-vs-canada-its-about-to-get-ugly/ "Facebook vs. Canada. It's about to get ugly."] 'Techi,' May 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert McMillan, [http://www.pcworld.com/article/197955/google_relents_will_hand_over_european_wifi_data.html "Google Relents, Will Hand Over European Wi-Fi Data"] 'PCWorld,' June 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional feature of concern to the new Google privacy policy is the nature of the policy. One must accept all features or delete existing Google accounts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/google-privacy-policy-is-subject-of-backlash/2012/01/25/gIQAzwZCRQ_story.html "Google privacy policy is subject of backlash"] 'The Washington Post.'&lt;/ref&gt; The update will affect the Google+ social network, therefore making Google+’s settings uncustomizable, unlike other customizable social networking sites. Customizing the privacy settings of a social network is a key tactic that many feel is necessary for social networking sites. This update in the system has some Google+ users wary of continuing service.&lt;ref name="Facebook. PIC"&gt;EPIC – In re Facebook. (n.d.). EPIC – Electronic Privacy Information Center. Retrieved January 25, 2011/&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, some fear the sharing of data amongst Google services could lead to revelations of identities. Many using pseudonyms are concerned about this possibility, and defend the role of pseudonyms in literature and history.&lt;ref&gt;Jillian York [https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/07/case-pseudonyms "A Case for Pseudonyms"] EFF.org, July 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Some solutions to being able to protect user privacy on the Internet can include programs such as "Rapleaf" which is a website that has a search engine that allows users to make all of one's search information and personal information private. Other websites that also give this option to their users are Facebook and Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=World |first=PC |title=People Search Engines: Limit the Information They Can Collect |url=http://0-vnweb.hwwilsonweb.com.sculib.scu.edu/hww/results/getResults.jhtml?_DARGS=/hww/results/results_common.jhtml.35 |publisher=PC World |accessdate=2011-10-20 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Privacy focused search engines/browsers====

Search engines such as [[Startpage.com]], [[Disconnect Mobile|Disconnect.me]] and [[Scroogle]] (defunct since 2012) anonymize Google searches. Some of the most notable Privacy-focused search-engines are:

* '''[[DuckDuckGo]]''': DuckDuckGo is a meta-search engine that combines the search results from various search engines (excluding Google) and providing some unique services like using search boxes on various websites and providing instant answers out of the box.
* '''[[Fireball (Search Engine)|'''Fireball''']]''': Fireball is Germany's first search engine and obtains web results from various sources (mainly [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]]). Fireball is not collecting any user information. All servers are stationed in Germany, a plus considering the German legislation tends to respect privacy rights better than many other European countries.
* '''[[MetaGer]]''': MetaGer is a meta-search engine (obtains results from various sources) and in Germany by far the most popular safe search engine. MetaGer uses similar safety features as Fireball.
* '''[[Ixquick]]''': IxQuick is a Dutch-based meta-search engine (obtains results from various sources). It commits also to the protection of the privacy of its users. Ixquick uses similar safety features as Fireball.
* '''[[Yacy]]''': Yacy is a decentralized-search engine developed on the basis of a community project, which started in 2005. The search engine follows a slightly different approach to the two previous ones, using a peer-to-peer principle that does not require any stationary and centralized servers. This has its disadvantages but also the simple advantage of greater privacy when surfing due to basically no possibility of hacking.
* [[Search Encrypt (Search Engine)|'''Search Encrypt''']]: Search Encrypt is an Internet [[Web search engine|search engine]] that prioritizes maintaining user privacy and avoiding the [[filter bubble]] of personalized search results. It differentiates itself from other search engines by using local [[encryption]] on searches and delayed history expiration.
* '''[[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor Browser (The Onion Router)]]''': Tor Browser is free software that provides access to anonymised network that enables anonymous communication. It directs the internet traffic through multiple relays. This encryption method prevents others from tracking a certain user, thus allowing user's IP address and other personal information to be concealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/|title=Tor Status|last=|first=|date=|website=Tor|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy issues of social networking sites===
{{main|Privacy issues of social networking sites}}
The advent of the [[Web 2.0]] has caused social profiling and is a growing concern for Internet privacy. Web 2.0 is the system that facilitates participatory information sharing and collaboration on the Internet, in [[social networking]] media websites like [[Facebook]], [[Instagram]], Twitter, and [[MySpace]]. These social networking sites have seen a boom in their popularity starting from the late 2000s. Through these websites many people are giving their personal information out on the internet.

It has been a topic of discussion of who is held accountable for the collection and distribution of personal information. Some will say that it is the fault of the social networks because they are the ones who are storing the vast amounts of information and data, but others claim that it is the users who are responsible for the issue because it is the users themselves that provide the information in the first place. This relates to the ever-present issue of how society regards social media sites. There is a growing number of people that are discovering the risks of putting their personal information online and trusting a website to keep it private. Yet in a recent study, researchers found that young people are taking measures to keep their posted information on Facebook private to some degree. Examples of such actions include managing their privacy settings so that certain content can be visible to "Only Friends" and ignoring Facebook friend requests from strangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Alyson Leigh|year=2013|title=Privacy Protection Strategies on Facebook|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|volume= 16| issue = 4|pages=479–500|doi=10.1080/1369118X.2013.777757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 a class action lawsuit was filed against Facebook alleging the company scanned user messages for web links, translating them to “likes” on the user's Facebook profile. Data lifted from the private messages was then used for [[targeted advertising]], the plaintiffs claimed. ''"Facebook's practice of scanning the content of these messages violates the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA also referred to as the Wiretap Act), as well as California's Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), and section 17200 of California's Business and Professions Code,''" the plaintiffs said.[https://www.rt.com/usa/217875-facebook-lawsuit-advertising-messages/] This shows that once information is online it is no longer completely private.  It is an increasing risk because younger people are having easier internet access than ever before, therefore they put themselves in a position where it is all too easy for them to upload information, but they may not have the caution to consider how difficult it can be to take that information down once it is out in the open.  This is becoming a bigger issue now that so much of society interacts online which was not the case fifteen years ago.  In addition, because of the quickly evolving digital media arena, people's interpretation of privacy is evolving as well, and it is important to consider that when interacting online.  New forms of social networking and digital media such as [[Instagram]] and [[Snapchat]] may call for new guidelines regarding privacy.  What makes this difficult is the wide range of opinions surrounding the topic, so it is left mainly up to our judgement to respect other people's online privacy in some circumstances.  Sometimes it may be necessary to take extra precautions in situations where somebody else may have a tighter view on privacy ethics.  No matter the situation it is beneficial to know about the potential consequences and issues that can come from careless activity on social networks.

===Internet service providers===
Internet users obtain Internet access through an [[Internet service provider]] (ISP). All data transmitted to and from users must pass through the ISP. Thus, an ISP has the potential to observe users' activities on the Internet.

However, ISPs are usually prohibited from participating in such activities due to legal, ethical, business, or technical reasons.

Normally ISPs do collect at least ''some'' information about the consumers using their services. From a privacy standpoint, ISPs would ideally collect only as much information as they require in order to provide Internet connectivity (IP address, billing information if applicable, etc.).

Which information an ISP collects, what it does with that information, and whether it informs its consumers, pose significant privacy issues. Beyond the usage of collected information typical of third parties, ISPs sometimes state that they will make their information available to government authorities upon request. In the US and other countries, such a request does not necessarily require a warrant.

An ISP cannot know the contents of properly-encrypted data passing between its consumers and the Internet. For encrypting [[World Wide Web|web]] traffic, [[https]] has become the most popular and best-supported standard. Even if users encrypt the data, the ISP still knows the IP addresses of the sender and of the recipient. (However, see the [[#IP addresses|IP addresses]] section for workarounds.)

An [[Anonymizer]] such as [[I2P|I2P – The Anonymous Network]] or [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] can be used for accessing web services without them knowing one's IP address and without one's ISP knowing what the services are that one accesses. Additional software has been developed that may provide more secure and anonymous alternatives to other applications.  For example, [[Bitmessage]] can be used as an alternative for email and [[Cryptocat]] as an alternative for online chat.  On the other hand, in addition to End-to-End encryption software, there are web services such as Qlink&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g68ZC9kY-go Guillermo Arduino (2014, December 13). A simple Security Protocol which does not require special software ''CNN Technology CLIXCNN''.]&lt;/ref&gt; which provide privacy through a novel security protocol which does not require installing any software.

While signing up for internet services, each computer contains a unique IP, Internet Protocol address.  This particular address will not give away private or personal information, however, a weak link could potentially reveal information from one's ISP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs18-cyb.htm |title=Online Privacy: Using the Internet Safely &amp;#124; Privacy Rights Clearinghouse |publisher=Privacyrights.org |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General concerns regarding Internet user privacy have become enough of a concern for a UN agency to issue a report on the dangers of identity fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6199372.stm |title=UN warns on password 'explosion' |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-12-04 |accessdate=2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the [[Council of Europe]] held its first annual Data Protection Day on January 28, which has since evolved into the annual [[Data Privacy Day]].&lt;ref name=dataprivacyday&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/01/celebrating-data-privacy.html |title=Celebrating data privacy |author=[[Peter Fleischer]], [[Jane Horvath]], [[Shuman Ghosemajumder]] |publisher=[[Google Blog]] |accessdate=12 August 2011 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[T-Mobile USA]] doesn't store any information on [[web browsing]]. [[Verizon Wireless]] keeps a record of the websites a subscriber visits for up to a year. [[Virgin Mobile]] keeps [[text messages]] for three months. Verizon keeps text messages for three to five days. None of the other carriers keep texts of messages at all, but they keep a record of who texted who for over a year.

===HTML5===
[[HTML5]] is the latest version of [[Hypertext Markup Language]] specification. HTML defines how user agents, such as web browsers, are to present websites based upon their underlying code. This new web standard changes the way that users are affected by the internet and their privacy on the internet. HTML5 expands the number of methods given to a website to store information locally on a client as well as the amount of data that can be stored. As such, privacy risks are increased. For instance, merely erasing cookies may not be enough to remove potential tracking methods since data could be mirrored in [[web storage]], another means of keeping information in a user's web browser.&lt;ref name="PrivacyWHATWG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/webstorage.html#privacy |title=Privacy, Web Storage |accessdate=11 December 2012 |publisher=WHATWG}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are so many sources of data storage that it is challenging for web browsers to present sensible privacy settings. As the power of web standards increases, so do potential misuses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/11/business/media/11privacy.html?adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=all Vega, T. (2010, October 10). New web code draws concern over privacy risks. ''The New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

HTML5 also expands access to user media, potentially granting access to a computer's microphone or webcam, a capability previously only possible through the use of plug-ins like [[Adobe Flash Player|Flash]].&lt;ref name="getUserMedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/ |title=Capturing Audio &amp; Video in HTML5 |accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to find a user's geographical location using the [[W3C Geolocation API|geolocation API]]. With this expanded access comes increased potential for abuse as well as more vectors for attackers.&lt;ref name="SophosHTML5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sophos.com/en-us/security-news-trends/security-trends/html5-and-security.aspx |title=HTML5 and Security on the New Web: Promise and problems for privacy and security |publisher=Sophos |accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a malicious site was able to gain access to a user's media, it could potentially use recordings to uncover sensitive information thought to be unexposed. However, the [[World Wide Web Consortium]], responsible for many web standards, feels that the increased capabilities of the web platform outweigh potential privacy concerns.&lt;ref name="W3CHTML5Privacy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/html/wiki/FAQs#What_are_HTML5_Security_and_Privacy_Issues.3F |accessdate=11 December 2012 |title=What are HTML5 Security and Privacy Issues? |publisher=W3C}}&lt;/ref&gt; They state that by documenting new capabilities in an open standardization process, rather than through closed source plug-ins made by companies, it is easier to spot flaws in specifications and cultivate expert advice.

Besides elevating privacy concerns, HTML5 also adds a few tools to enhance user privacy. A mechanism is defined whereby user agents can share blacklists of domains that should not be allowed to access web storage.&lt;ref name="PrivacyWHATWG" /&gt; [[Content Security Policy]] is a proposed standard whereby sites may assign privileges to different domains, enforcing harsh limitations on JavaScript use to mitigate [[cross-site scripting]] attacks. HTML5 also adds HTML templating and a standard HTML parser which replaces the various parsers of web browser vendors. These new features formalize previously inconsistent implementations, reducing the number of vulnerabilities though not eliminating them entirely.&lt;ref name="HTML5 Security Realities"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hill |first=Brad |title=HTML5 Security Realities |url=http://www.slideshare.net/BradHill2/w3-conf-hillhtml5securityrealities |accessdate=23 February 2013 |date=February 2013 |quote=Rich web apps are not new, and HTML5 offers big security improvements compared to the proprietary plugin technologies it's actually replacing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="W3C HTML Templates"&gt;{{cite web |title=HTML Templates |url=https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webcomponents/raw-file/tip/spec/templates/index.html |publisher=W3C |accessdate=23 February 2013 |date=23 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310163433/https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webcomponents/raw-file/tip/spec/templates/index.html |archive-date=2013-03-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Big Data===
[[Big Data]] is generally defined as the rapid accumulation and compiling of massive amounts of information that is being exchanged over digital communication systems. The data is large (often exceeding [[exabytes]]) and cannot be handled by conventional computer processors, and are instead stored on large server-system databases. This information is assessed by analytic scientists using software programs; which paraphrase this information into multi-layered user trends and demographics. This information is collected from all around the Internet, such as by popular services like [[Facebook]], [[Google]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Spotify]] or [[GPS]] systems. 
Big Data provides companies with the ability to:
*Infer detailed psycho-demographic profiles of internet users, even if they were not directly expressed or indicated by users.&lt;ref name=NAS-V110-I15/&gt;
*Inspect product availability and optimize prices for maximum profit while clearing inventory.
*Swiftly reconfigure risk portfolios in minutes and understand future opportunities to mitigate risk.
*Mine customer data for insight, and create advertising strategies for customer acquisition and retention.
*Identify customers who matter the most.
*Create retail coupons based on a proportional scale to how much the customer has spent, to ensure a higher redemption rate.
*Send tailored recommendations to mobile devices at just the right time, while customers are in the right location to take advantage of offers.
*Analyze data from social media to detect new market trends and changes in demand.
*Use clickstream analysis and data mining to detect fraudulent behavior.
*Determine root causes of failures, issues and defects by investigating user sessions, network logs and machine sensors.&lt;ref name=SAS&gt;{{cite web |title=Big Data – What Is It? |url=http://www.sas.com/big-data/index.html |publisher=SAS |accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other potential Internet privacy risks===
* [[Malware]] is a term short for "malicious software" and is used to describe software to cause damage to a single computer, server, or computer network whether that is through the use of a virus, trojan horse, spyware, etc.&lt;ref name="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd632948.aspx"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://technet.microsoft.com | title=Resources and Tools for IT Professionals &amp;#124; TechNet}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Spyware]] is a piece of software that obtains information from a user's computer without that user's consent.&lt;ref name="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd632948.aspx" /&gt;
* A [[web bug]] is an object embedded into a web page or email and is usually invisible to the user of the website or reader of the email. It allows checking to see if a person has looked at a particular website or read a specific email message.
* [[Phishing]] is a criminally fraudulent process of trying to obtain sensitive information such as user names, passwords, credit card or bank information. Phishing is an internet crime in which someone masquerades as a trustworthy entity in some form of electronic communication.
* [[Pharming]] is a hacker's attempt to redirect traffic from a legitimate website to a completely different internet address. Pharming can be conducted by changing the hosts file on a victim's computer or by exploiting a vulnerability on the DNS server.
* [[Social engineering (computer security)|Social engineering]] where people are manipulated or tricked into performing actions or divulging confidential information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csoonline.com/article/514063/social-engineering-the-basics |title=Social Engineering: The Basics |last=Goodchild |first=Joan |date=11 January 2010 |publisher=csoonline |accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Proxy server#Risks of using anonymous proxy servers|Malicious proxy server]] (or other "anonymity" services).
* Use of [[Password strength|weak passwords]] that are short, consist of all numbers, all lowercase or all uppercase letters, or that can be easily guessed such as single words, common phrases, a person's name, a pet's name, the name of a place, an address, a phone number, a social security number, or a birth date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Protect Your Privacy |url=http://www.truste.com/products-and-services/consumer_privacy/privacy_tips#btt |publisher=TRUSTe |accessdate=2012-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Allowing unused or little used accounts, where unauthorized use is likely to go unnoticed, to remain active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 5 Online Privacy Tips |url=http://www.net-security.org/secworld.php?id=8798 |publisher=Net-Security |accessdate=2012-11-23|date=2010-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Using out-of-date software that may contain vulnerabilities that have been fixed in newer more up-to-date versions.&lt;ref name=DigitalToolstoCurbSnooping-NYT-17July2013/&gt;
* [[WebRTC]] is a protocol which suffers from a serious [[WebRTC#Concerns|security flaw]] that compromises the privacy of [[Virtual private network|VPN-tunnels]], by allowing the true [[IP address]] of the user to be read.

===Reduction of risks to Internet privacy===
''[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]]'' magazine reports that the Internet's biggest corporations have hoarded Internet users' personal data and sold it for large financial profits. The magazine reports on a band of startup companies that are demanding privacy and aiming to overhaul the social-media business, such as [[Wickr]], a mobile messaging app, described as using peer-to-peer encryption and giving the user the capacity to control what information is retained on the other end; &amp;nbsp; Ansa, an ephemeral chat application, also described as employing peer-to-peer encryption; &amp;nbsp; and Omlet, an open mobile social network, described as giving the user control over their data so that if a user does not want their data saved, they are able to delete it from the data repository.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inc.com/magazine/201407/ceo-of-wickr-leads-social-media-resistance-movement.html The Revolution Will Not Be Monetized], in the July–August 2014 issue of ''[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc. magazine]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noise Society – Protection through Information Overflow===

According to  [[Nicklas Lundblad]], another perspective on privacy protection is the assumption that the quickly growing amount of information produced will be beneficial. The reasons for this are that the costs for the surveillance will raise and that there is more noise, noise being understood as anything that interferes the process of a receiver trying to extract private data from a sender.

In this noise society, the collective expectation of privacy will increase, but the individual expectation of privacy will decrease. In other words, not everyone can be analyzed in detail, but one individual can be. Also, in order to stay unobserved, it can hence be better to blend in with the others than trying to use for example encryption technologies and similar methods. Technologies for this can be called Jante-technologies after the Law of Jante, which states that you are nobody special.
This view offers new challenges and perspectives for the privacy discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lundblad|first1=Nicklas|title=Privacy in the Noise Society|journal=Stockholm Institute for Scandianvian Law|date=2010|url=http://www.scandinavianlaw.se/pdf/47-16.pdf|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public views==
While internet privacy is widely acknowledged as the top consideration in any online interaction,&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miyazaki |first=A. D. |last2=Fernandez |first2=A. |year=2001 |title=Consumer Perceptions of Privacy and Security Risks for Online Shopping |journal=Journal of Consumer Affairs |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=38–39 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-6606.2001.tb00101.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; as evinced by the public outcry over SOPA/CISPA, public understanding of online privacy policies is actually being negatively affected by the current trends regarding online privacy statements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/19/us-data-collection-idUSTRE81I0AP20120219 Menn, J. (Feb. 19, 2012), Data Collection Arms Race Feeds Privacy Fears. ''Reuters'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Users have a tendency to skim internet privacy policies for information regarding the distribution of personal information only, and the more legalistic the policies appear, the less likely users are to even read the information.&lt;ref name="Milne, G. R 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Milne |first=G. R. |last2=Culnan |first2=M. J. |year=2004 |title=Strategies for reducing online privacy risks: Why consumers read (or don't read) online privacy notices |journal=J. Interactive Mark. |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=24–25 |doi=10.1002/dir.20009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coupling this with the increasingly exhaustive license agreements companies require consumers to agree to before using their product, consumers are reading less about their rights.

Furthermore, if the user has already done business with a company, or is previously familiar with a product, they have a tendency to not read the privacy policies that the company has posted.&lt;ref name="Milne, G. R 2004"/&gt; As internet companies become more established, their policies may change, but their clients will be less likely to inform themselves of the change.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt; This tendency is interesting because as consumers become more acquainted with the internet they are also more likely to be interested in online privacy.  Finally, consumers have been found to avoid reading the privacy policies if the policies are not in a simple format, and even perceive these policies to be irrelevant.&lt;ref name="Milne, G. R 2004"/&gt;  The less readily available terms and conditions are, the less likely the public is to inform themselves of their rights regarding the service they are using.

===Concerns of Internet privacy and real life implications===
While dealing with the issue of internet privacy, one must first be concerned with not only the technological implications such as damaged property, corrupted files, and the like, but also with the potential for implications on their real lives. One such implication, which is rather commonly viewed as being one of the most daunting fears risks of the Internet, is the potential for identity theft. Although it is a typical belief that larger companies and enterprises are the usual focus of identity thefts, rather than individuals, recent reports seem to show a trend opposing this belief. Specifically, it was found in a 2007 “Internet Security Threat Report” that roughly ninety-three percent of “gateway” attacks were targeted at unprepared home users. It should be noted that the term “gateway” attack was used to refer to attack which aimed not at stealing data immediately, but rather at gaining access for future attacks.&lt;ref name="Krapf, E. 2007"&gt;Krapf, E. (2007). A Perspective On Internet Security. Business Communications Review, 37(6), 10–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

But how, one might ask, is this still thriving given the increasing emphasis on internet security? The simple, but unfortunate solution, according to Symantec's “Internet Security Threat Report”, is that of the expanding “underground economy”. With more than fifty percent of the supporting servers located in the United States, this “underground economy” has become a haven for internet thieves, who use the system in order to sell stolen information. These pieces of information can range from generic things such as a user account or email to something as personal as a bank account number and [[Personal identification number|PIN]].&lt;ref name="Krapf, E. 2007"/&gt;

While the processes these internet thieves use are abundant and unique, one popular trap unsuspecting people fall into is that of online purchasing. This is not to allude to the idea that every purchase one makes online will leave them susceptible to identity theft, but rather that it increases the chances. In fact, in a 2001 article titled “Consumer Watch”, the popular online site PC World went as far as calling secure e-shopping a myth. Though unlike the “gateway” attacks mentioned above, these incidents of information being stolen through online purchases generally are more prevalent in medium to large sized e-commerce sites, rather than smaller individualized sites. This is assumed to be a result of the larger consumer population and purchases, which allow for more potential leeway with information.&lt;ref name="Kandra, Anne 2001, PC"&gt;Kandra, Anne. (2001, July). The myth of secure e-shopping. PC World, 19(7), 29–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, however, the potential for a violation of one's privacy is typically out of their hands after purchasing from an online “e-tailer” or store. One of the most common forms in which hackers receive private information from online “e-tailers” actually comes from an attack placed upon the site's servers responsible for maintaining information about previous transactions. For as experts&lt;!-- source needed --&gt; explain, these “e-tailers” are not doing nearly enough to maintain or improve their security measures. Even those sites that clearly present a privacy or security policy can be subject to hackers’ havoc as most policies only rely upon encryption technology which only apply to the actual transfer of a customer's data. However, with this being said, most “e-tailers” have been making improvements, going as far as covering some of the credit card fees if the information's abuse can be tracked back to the site's servers.&lt;ref name="Kandra, Anne 2001, PC"/&gt;

As one of the largest growing concerns American adults have of current Internet privacy policies, identity and credit theft remain a constant figure in the debate surrounding privacy online. A 1997 study by the Boston Consulting Group showed that participants of the study were most concerned about their privacy on the Internet compared to any other media.&lt;ref name="Langford"&gt;Langford, D. (Ed.). (2000). Internet Ethics. Houndmills: MacMillan Press Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is important to recall that these issues are not the only prevalent concerns our society has. Though some may call it a modern-day version of McCarthyism, another prevalent issue also remains members of our own society sending disconcerting emails to one another. It is for this reason in 2001 that for one of the first times ever the public demonstrated an approval of government intervention in their private lives.&lt;ref name="pewinternet.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org|title=Pew Research -|work=pewinternet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the overall public anxiety regarding the constantly expanding trend of online crimes, in 2001 roughly fifty-four percent of Americans polled showed a general approval for the FBI monitoring those emails deemed suspicious. Thus, it was born the idea for the FBI program: “Carnivore”, which was going to be used as a searching method, allowing the FBI to hopefully home in on potential criminals. Unlike the overall approval of the FBI's intervention, “Carnivore” was not met with as much of a majority's approval. Rather, the public seemed to be divided with forty-five percent siding in its favor, forty-five percent opposed to the idea for its ability to potentially interfere with ordinary citizen's messages, and ten percent claiming indifference. While this may seem slightly tangent to the topic of internet privacy, it is important to consider that at the time of this poll, the general population's approval on government actions was declining, reaching thirty-one percent versus the forty-one percent it held a decade prior. This figure in collaboration with the majority's approval of FBI intervention demonstrates an emerging emphasis on the issue of internet privacy in society and more importantly, the potential implications it may hold on citizens’ lives.&lt;ref name="pewinternet.org"/&gt;

Online users must seek to protect the information they share with online websites, specifically social media. In today's [[Web 2.0]] individuals have become the public producers of personal information.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Cornière|first=Alexandre|last2=de Nijs|first2=Romain|date=2016-02-01|title=Online advertising and privacy|journal=The RAND Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=47|issue=1|pages=48–72|doi=10.1111/1756-2171.12118|issn=1756-2171|citeseerx=10.1.1.406.8570}}&lt;/ref&gt; We create our own digital trails that hackers and companies alike capture and utilize for a variety of marketing and advertisement targeting. A recent paper from the [[RAND Corporation|Rand Corporation]] claims "privacy is not the opposite of sharing – rather, it is control over sharing."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Internet privacy concerns arise from our surrender of personal information to engage in a variety of acts, from transactions to commenting in online forums. Protections against invasions of online privacy will require individuals to make an effort informing and protecting themselves via existing software solutions, to pay premiums for such protections or require individuals to place greater pressure on governing institutions to enforce privacy laws and regulations regarding consumer and personal information.

==Laws and regulations==
{{Main |Privacy law |Information privacy law}}

===Global privacy policies===
Google has long been attacked for their lack of privacy in the U.S. as well as abroad. In 2007, however, the tables began to turn. Peter Fleischer, a Google representative, addressed the U.N. in France regarding privacy issues and expressed that the current international privacy policies were not adequately protecting consumers. Instead of continuing to enforce broken and ineffective Internet privacy laws, the Google representative proposed that the United Nations establish a global privacy policy that would efficiently protect consumers privacy while causing the least possible amount of negative impact on web browsers such as Google. At that time, Google was under investigation by the European Union for violating the global privacy policies that were already in place.
The greatest issue related to Internet privacy internationally is that of data collection. At this point in time, the U.S. and the European Union had separate sets of privacy policies, making it increasingly difficult for companies such as Google to exist globally without violating such policies. Google is just one example of a large company whose primary goal is to make money by serving their product, web browsing, to consumers. Consumers, however, are concerned with the quality of that product and their privacy. Online data collection by search engines allows Internet businesses to track consumer's online roadmap, everything from the sites they visit to the purchases they make. This poses problems globally to those who are web users around the world, especially in a world where there is no overarching privacy policy. The general consensus of this issue regarding international privacy violations at the time of Fleischer's U.N. address is that, since the Internet is global, the privacy policies should also be global and unified.

===Data protection regulation===
Currently, as of March 2012, the need for a set of unified privacy policies has been met by the European Union with proposed legislation. The [[General Data Protection Regulation]] is a proposed set of consistent regulations across the European Union that will protect Internet users from clandestine tracking and unauthorized personal data usage. This regulation will further protect users' privacy rights in two key ways: clearly defining the term “personal data” and increasing punishments for those who violate users' online privacy. In Article 4(2) of the proposed legislation, the definition of personal data is expanded significantly to include any information online that could be traced to an individual. In Articles 77 and 79 of the proposed legislation, appropriate punishments are outlined for many possible violations of users' privacy rights by controllers and effective enforcement of data protection is guaranteed. The Data Protection Regulation will also hold companies accountable for violations of the regulation by implementing a unified legislation outlining specific repercussions for various types of violations based on severity.
The CDT, the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, has carefully evaluated this proposed legislation in detail and officially issued an analysis on March 28, 2012. The Center for Democracy &amp; Technology is a nonprofit organization that advocates for Internet freedom and online privacy through government public policy. Analyses such as this interpret the governmental propositions for Internet users and promote democracy by allowing all the opportunity to agree or disagree with the proposition prior to its ruling. This analysis is posted publicly on the Internet, in compliance with the mission of CDT, and addresses each section of the Data Protection Regulation and the potential pitfalls of each article. The two major issues the CDT addresses in this analysis of the Data Protection Regulation are the inflexible rules against profiling users based on their Internet usage and the parental consent policy in regards to controlling the online information of children.

===Internet privacy in China===
{{refimprove section|date=June 2014}}

One of the most popular topics of discussion in regards to Internet privacy is China. Although China is known for its remarkable reputation on maintaining Internet privacy among many online users, it could potentially be a major jeopardy to the lives of many online users who have their information exchanged on the web on a regular basis. For instance, in China, there is a new software that will enable the concept of surveillance among the majority of online users and present a risk to their privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/26/china-boosts-internet-surveillance|title=China boosts internet surveillance|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2011-07-26|last1=Branigan|first1=Tania}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main concern with privacy of Internet users in China is the lack thereof. China has a well known policy of censorship when it comes to the spread of information through public media channels. [[Censorship in the People's Republic of China|Censorship]] has been prominent in [[Mainland China]] since the [[Communist Party of China|communist party]] gained power in China over 60 years ago. With the development of the Internet, however, privacy became more of a problem for the government. The Chinese Government has been accused of actively limiting and editing the information that flows into the country via various media. The Internet poses a particular set of issues for this type of censorship, especially when search engines are involved. Yahoo! for example, encountered a problem after entering China in the mid-2000s. A Chinese journalist, who was also a Yahoo! user, sent private emails using the Yahoo! server regarding the Chinese government. The Chinese staff of Yahoo! intercepted these emails and sent the journalist's reportedly bad impression of the country to the Chinese government, which in turn sentenced the journalist to ten years in prison.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} These types of occurrences have been reported numerous times and have been criticized by foreign entities such as the creators of the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor anonymity network]], which was designed to circumvent network surveillance in multiple countries.
User privacy in China is not as cut-and-dry as it is in other parts of the world.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} China, reportedly{{According to whom|date=May 2013}}, has a much more invasive policy when Internet activity involves the Chinese government. For this reason, search engines are under constant pressure to conform to Chinese rules and regulations on censorship while still attempting to keep their integrity. Therefore, most search engines operate differently in China than in the other countries, such as the US or Britain, if they operate in China at all. There are two types of intrusions that occur in China regarding the internet: the alleged intrusion of the company providing users with Internet service, and the alleged intrusion of the Chinese government.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The intrusion allegations made against companies providing users with Internet service are based upon reports that companies, such as Yahoo! in the previous example, are using their access to the internet users' private information to track and monitor users' Internet activity. Additionally, there have been reports that personal information has been sold. For example, students preparing for exams would receive calls from unknown numbers selling school supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Han |first1=Dong |title=The Market Value of Who We Are: The Flow of Personal Data and Its Regulation in China |journal=Media and Communication |date=12 April 2017 |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=21 |doi=10.17645/mac.v5i2.890}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claims made against the Chinese government lies in the fact that the government is forcing Internet-based companies to track users private online data without the user knowing that they are being monitored. Both alleged intrusions are relatively harsh and possibly force foreign Internet service providers to decide if they value the Chinese market over internet privacy. Also, many websites are blocked in China such as Facebook and Twitter. However many Chinese internet users use special methods like a VPN to unblock websites that are blocked.

===Internet privacy in Sweden===
Sweden is often considered to be at the forefront of Internet use and Internet regulations. On 11 May 1973 Sweden enacted the [[Data Act]] − the world's first national data protection law.&lt;ref name=impl&gt;{{cite web|last1=Öman|first1=Sören|title=Implementing Data Protection in Law|url=http://www.scandinavianlaw.se/pdf/47-18.pdf|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Privacy Law: Sweden|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/online-privacy-law/sweden.php|website=www.loc.gov|publisher=Law Library of Congress|accessdate=10 May 2017|language=en|date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are constantly innovating the way that the Internet is used and how it impacts their people. In 2012, Sweden received a Web Index Score of 100, a score that measures how the Internet significantly influences political, social, and economic impact, placing them first among 61 other nations. Sweden received this score while in the process of exceeding new mandatory implementations from the European Union. Sweden placed more restrictive guidelines on the directive on intellectual property rights enforcement (IPRED) and passed the FRA-law in 2009 that allowed for the legal sanctioning of surveillance of internet traffic by state authorities. The FRA has a history of intercepting radio signals and has stood as the main intelligence agency in Sweden since 1942. Sweden is an interesting topic when discussing Laws and Regulations of Internet Privacy because of mixture of their government's strong push towards implementing policy and their citizens continued perception of a free and neutral Internet. Both of the previously mentioned additions created controversy by critics but they did not change the public perception even though the new FRA-law was brought in front of the European Court of Human Rights for human rights violations. The law was established by the National Defense Radio Establishment (Forsvarets Radio Anstalt - FRA) to eliminate outside threats. However, the law also allowed for authorities to monitor all cross-border communication without a warrant. Sweden's recent emergence into Internet dominance may be explained by their recent climb in users. Only 2% of all Swedes were connected to the Internet in 1995 but at last count in 2012, 89% had broadband access. This was due in large part once again to the active Swedish government introducing regulatory provisions to promote competition among Internet Service Providers. These regulations helped grow web-infrastructure and forced prices below the European average. To add to the intrigue around Sweden's laws and regulations, one must also mention how copyright laws evolved in Sweden. Sweden was the birthplace of the Pirate Bay, an infamous file-sharing website. File sharing has been illegal in Sweden since it was developed, however, there was never any real fear of being persecuted for the crime until 2009 when the Swedish Parliament was the first in the European Union to pass the intellectual property rights directive. This directive persuaded internet service providers to announce the identity of suspected violators. A final piece of legislation worth mentioning when discussing Sweden's regulations is the infamous centralized block list. The list is generated by authorities and was originally crafted to eliminate sites hosting child pornography. However, there is no legal way to appeal a site that ends up on the list and as a result, many non-child pornography sites have been blacklisted. It is important to consider that Sweden's government enjoys a high level of trust from their citizens. Without this trust, many of these regulations would not be possible and thus many of these regulations may only be feasible in the Swedish context.&lt;ref&gt;[http://policyreview.info/articles/analysis/do-swedes-do-internet-policy-and-regulation-sweden-%E2%80%93-snapshot Do as the Swedes do?

===Internet privacy in the United States===
[[File:Jeff Flake official Senate photo (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|US Republican senator [[Jeff Flake]] spearheaded an effort to pass legislation allowing ISPs and tech firms to sell private customer information, such as their browsing history, without consent.]]

With the [[Republican party of the United States|Republicans]] in control of all three branches of the U.S. government, [[Lobbying in the United States|lobbyists]] for [[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) and tech firms persuaded lawmakers to dismantle regulations to protect privacy which had been made during the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]]. These FCC rules had required ISPs to get "explicit consent" before gathering and selling their private Internet information, such as the consumers' browsing histories, locations of businesses visited and applications used.&lt;ref name=twsWashPost47447/&gt; Trade groups wanted to be able to sell this information for profit.&lt;ref name=twsWashPost47447/&gt; Lobbyists persuaded Republican senator [[Jeff Flake]] and Republican representative [[Marsha Blackburn]] to sponsor legislation to dismantle Internet privacy rules; Flake received $22,700 in donations and Blackburn received $20,500 in donations from these trade groups.&lt;ref name=twsWashPost47447/&gt; On March 23, 2017, abolition of these privacy protections passed on a narrow party-line vote.&lt;ref name=twsWashPost47447&gt;Kimberly Kindy, May 30, 2017, Washington Post, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-congress-dismantled-federal-internet-privacy-rules/2017/05/29/7ad06e14-2f5b-11e7-8674-437ddb6e813e_story.html?wpisrc=nl_evening&amp;wpmm=1 How Congress dismantled federal Internet privacy rules], Retrieved May 30, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018, California passed the law restricting companies from sharing [[user data]] without permission.

==Legal threats==
Used by government agencies are array of technologies designed to track and gather Internet users' information are the topic of much debate between privacy advocates, [[civil liberties]] advocates and those who believe such measures are necessary for law enforcement to keep pace with rapidly changing communications technology.

Specific examples:
* Following a decision by the European Union's council of ministers in Brussels, in January 2009, the UK's [[Home Office]] adopted a plan to allow police to access the contents of individuals' computers without a warrant. The process, called "remote searching", allows one party, at a remote location, to examine another's hard drive and Internet traffic, including email, browsing history and websites visited. Police across the EU are now permitted to request that the British police conduct a remote search on their behalf. The search can be granted, and the material gleaned turned over and used as evidence, on the basis of a senior officer believing it necessary to prevent a serious crime. Opposition MPs and civil liberties advocates are concerned about this move toward widening surveillance and its possible impact on personal privacy. Says  Shami Chakrabarti, director of the human rights group Liberty, “The public will want this to be controlled by new legislation and judicial authorisation. Without those safeguards it’s a devastating blow to any notion of personal privacy.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5439604.ece |title=Police set to step up hacking of home PCs |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |accessdate=2011-11-25 |location=London|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The FBI's [[Magic Lantern (software)|Magic Lantern]] software program was the topic of much debate when it was publicized in November, 2001. Magic Lantern is a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan Horse]] program that logs users' keystrokes, rendering encryption useless to those infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/archive.cgi?noframes;read=15391 |title=FBI 'Lantern' Software Does Log Keystrokes |publisher=Rumormillnews.com |accessdate=2011-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623023322/http://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/archive.cgi?noframes;read=15391 |archive-date=2012-06-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Children and Internet Privacy ==
&lt;ref name="everydaylaw"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/galegel/internet_privacy/0|title=Internet Privacy|date=2013|website=Gale encyclopedia of everyday law|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet privacy is a growing concern with children and the content they are able to view. Aside from that, many concerns for the privacy of email, the vulnerability of internet users to have their internet usage tracked, and the collection of personal information also exist. These concerns have began to bring the issues of internet privacy before the courts and judges. &lt;ref name="everydaylaw"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5196">[[File:Kerry report cover.png|thumb|Cover of the Kerry Committee report]]

The '''Kerry Committee report''', formally titled '''''Drugs, Law Enforcement and Foreign Policy''''', was the final report of an investigation by the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee's]] Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics, and International Operations.  The report examined the problems that drug cartels and drug money laundering in South and Central America and the Caribbean posed for American law enforcement and foreign policy. The Sub-Committee was chaired at the time by Senator [[John Kerry]], so that the report is often referred to under his name. 

The report was released on April 13, 1989,&lt;ref name="Peter Kornbluh"&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Kornbluh|date=January–February 1997|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB2/storm.htm|title=Anatomy of a Story, Crack the Contras and the CIA: The Storm Over Dark Alliance|work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|accessdate=April 22, 2006}} ''Hosted on National Security Archives''&lt;/ref&gt; and included discussions of drug trafficking in the Bahamas, Colombia, Cuba and Nicaragua, Haiti, Honduras, and Panama. The longest chapter in the report was on narcotics trafficking and the Nicaraguan Contras. The Subcommittee "did not find that Contra leaders were personally involved in drug trafficking,"&lt;ref name="report1"&gt;''Drugs, Law Enforcement and Foreign Policy, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; but it did find "substantial evidence"  of drug smuggling by "individual Contras, Contra suppliers, Contra pilots, mercenaries who worked with the Contras, and Contra supporters."&lt;ref name="report1"/&gt;

==Background==
Press accounts concerning links between the [[Contras]] and drug traffickers, which began with a December 1985 story by the [[Associated Press]], led to a review by the [[United States Department of State]], [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] and relevant [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. intelligence agencies]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = GPO| last = United States Senate. Committee on Foreign Relations. Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics, and International Operations. | title = Drugs, law enforcement, and foreign policy : A report | location = Washington| date = 1989 | url = https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000014976124;view=1up;seq=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1986, the State Department informed Congress that it had "evidence of a limited number of incidents in which known drug traffickers tried to establish connections with Nicaraguan resistance groups."&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;

==Hearings begin==
In April 1986, [[John Kerry]] and Senator [[Christopher Dodd]], a Democrat from [[Connecticut]], proposed that hearings be conducted by the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] regarding charges of [[Contras|Contra]] involvement in [[cocaine]] and [[marijuana]] [[drug trafficking|trafficking]]. Senator [[Richard Lugar]] of [[Indiana]], the Republican chairman of the committee, agreed to conduct the hearings.

==Kerry's findings==
The Kerry Committee report found that "the Contra drug links included ".... Payments to drug traffickers by the U.S. State Department of funds authorized by the Congress for humanitarian assistance to the Contras, in some cases after the traffickers had been indicted by federal law enforcement agencies on drug charges, in others while traffickers were under active investigation by these same agencies."&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; The US State Department paid over $806,000 to known drug traffickers to carry humanitarian assistance to the Contras.&lt;ref name="white"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cockburn|first=Alexander |author2=Jeffrey St Clair |date=October 1, 1999|title=Whiteout: The CIA, Drugs and the Press|publisher=Verso |isbn=1-85984-258-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9547">{{Politics of Latvia}}

A '''constitutional referendum'''  to amend the [[constitution of Latvia]] in order to allow one-tenth of the total registered [[:wikt:electorate|electorate]] to initiate a popular [[referendum]] to [[Dissolution of parliament|dissolve]] the [[Saeima|Latvian parliament]] was held in [[Latvia]] on 2 August 2008.

The referendum on this issue was triggered when the [[Government of Latvia]] voted against an opposition motion to adopt this change to the constitution, which resulted in a referendum in Latvia by law. [[President of Latvia|President]] [[Valdis Zatlers]] and the left-wing opposition were in favour of the referendum, while the government was against it, arguing that it would cause even more instability in a country which has seen 13 governments in the 18 years since independence. At least half of the total registered electorate (i.e. more than 757,607) had to approve the referendum proposal in order for it to be valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5glLYfLwkvbzbPJScdfqZPHN0851g |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520153730/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5glLYfLwkvbzbPJScdfqZPHN0851g |archivedate=2011-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/223093,latvians-vote-in-a-poll-on-power-to-dissolve-parliament.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Preliminary results indicated that an overwhelming 96% of voters had voted in favour of the amendment, although only about 40% of the electorate voted in favour, which means the referendum is invalid.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.focus-fen.net/index.php?id=n148184&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected that the strong result, while failing to directly change the constitution, might press politicians to adopt a similar measure nonetheless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKL265890220080802?sp=true | work=Reuters | title=Latvian vote on sacking parliament falls short | date=2008-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If passed, the amendment would have represented the first time in an [[European Union|EU]] country that voters would have been able to [[Dissolution of parliament|dissolve]] their national parliament - a right traditionally reserved for the [[head of state]].&lt;ref name="International Herald Tribune"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/08/03/europe/EU-Latvia-Referendum.php|title= International Herald Tribune, 3 August 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The moves to initiate the referendum began in Autumn 2007 at a time of public discontent with the government which had led to the largest street protests to date in the [[History of Latvia|post-Soviet era]].&lt;ref name="France24"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20080802-referendum-vote-right-dissolve-parliament-latvia|title= Latvian referendum article|publisher=France24.com|accessdate=2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement to organise the referendum was led by the [[Free Trade Union Confederation of Latvia]].&lt;ref name="CVK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.cvk.lv/pub/public/29099.html|title=Collection of signatures for Amendments to the Constitution of Latvia|publisher=Latvian Central Election Commission web.cvk.lv|accessdate=2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum also took place at a time of poor economic indicators with inflation exceeding 17 percent and economic growth expected to fall to near zero.&lt;ref name="International Herald Tribune"/&gt;

===Procedure for calling a referendum===
Under the ‘Latvian Law on National Referendums and Legislative Initiatives’, the procedure on calling popular referendums has several stages. The first stage involves the collection of 10,000 signatures certified by notaries, which are then presented to the Latvian [[Central Election Commission]] (CEC). Following positive verification of these signatures, the Latvian Government must then provide facilities for signature gathering in every town and village in the country, to enable the population to sign in favour of a proposal for a referendum.&lt;ref name="Groundreport.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.groundreport.com/Politics/Referendum-Fails-in-Latvia|title= Latvian referendum fails|publisher=Groundreport.com|accessdate=2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to be successful, more than one-tenth of citizens eligible to vote in the previous parliamentary elections must sign in favour. Again, the signatures are verified by the CEC. If the 10% threshold is met, then the draft amendments are presented to the president who submits them to parliament for approval. If two thirds of MPs approve the changes at a sitting in which at least two thirds of the parliament is present then the changes are passed into law without the need for a referendum. If parliament rejects the laws, then a referendum is held.&lt;ref name="CVK"/&gt;

==Collection of signatures==
In the event, 11,095 signatures were initially collected and positively verified. Collection of further signatures then took place from March 12 to April 10, 2008 in 660 designated places, of which 40 were abroad.  In total, counting the initial signatures, 217,567 voters supported the introduction of the draft amendments.&lt;ref name="CVK"/&gt; A further 6,814 signatures were disqualified. In the vast majority of cases this was due to citizens signing more than once. However, 35 were disqualified due to not being Latvian citizens, 22 on the grounds of insanity, 62 who were deceased or could not be identified and 1 person who was under the age of 18 upon signing.&lt;ref name="CVK"/&gt;

As the total number of valid signatures represented 14.6% of the electorate,&lt;ref name="CVK"/&gt; the amendments were duly presented by the president to parliament, which rejected them on 5 June 2008.&lt;ref name="CVK fact sheet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.cvk.lv/cvkserv/TN_2008_1/faktu_lapa_EN.pdf|title=Referendum fact sheet|publisher=Latvian Central Election Commission|accessdate=2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, under the terms of the referendum law, a referendum had to be held not earlier than one month and not later than two months after rejection.&lt;ref name="CVK fact sheet"/&gt;

==Referendum campaign==

==="No" campaign===
Opposing the referendum, [[Prime Minister of Latvia|Prime Minister]] [[Ivars Godmanis]] pointed out that political instability had also been a feature of pre-Soviet Latvia. He also argued that “Electing the parliament is a creative process, while a referendum would be a destructive process without any result." &lt;ref name="Diena"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diena.lv/lat/politics/politika/vai-jus-iesiet-neiesiet-uz-referendumu-kapec-2008-07-30-1#comments|title=Politician's opinions on the referendum|publisher=Diena newspaper 30 July 2008|accessdate=2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spolitis.blogspot.com/2008/07/referendum-pro-et-contra.html English translation of above 30 July Diena article]&lt;/ref&gt; Parliamentary speaker [[Gundars Daudze]] argued that such referendums could create a huge crisis with neither parliament nor president operating. Meanwhile, the head of the People's Party in parliament, Māris Kučinskis, stated his belief that such referendums would allow a small number of people to change the election results.&lt;ref name="Diena"/&gt; The advertisements of the no campaign also played on fears of Russian influence, with one advertisement, illustrated by pictures of ethnic Russian politicians from the opposition left wing parties playing a balalaika in a sauna, declaring “If you vote tomorrow, then you, brother, are crazy. In our places, the Russians will come. The Russians will come.” &lt;ref&gt;Diena newspaper, 1 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Yes" campaign===
Former Prime Minister [[Einars Repše]], a member of the opposition [[New Era Party|New Era party]], argued that a yes vote of the majority of the electorate would be in accordance with basic democratic principles and that many contemporary Latvian politicians were working not for the state interest but for the interest of “Godfathers.” &lt;ref name="Diena"/&gt; Civic Union party leader [[Sandra Kalniete]] also called for a yes vote on the grounds that the amendments could force MPs “to finally listen to the will of their voters.” &lt;ref name="Diena"/&gt; [[For Human Rights in United Latvia]] MP [[Juris Sokolovskis]] supported a yes vote on the basis of perceived alienation of the electorate from their MPs and on the grounds that, even if the 50% quorum was not reached, a large yes majority would still be difficult for politicians to ignore.&lt;ref name="Diena"/&gt;

==Reactions==
Following the anticipated large yes vote, President Valdis Zatlers said the support shown was strong enough to prompt Parliament to adopt similar amendments on its own. "The rights of the people to dissolve the Parliament have to be included in the Constitution as soon as possible," Zatlers was quoted as saying by local news agency BNS. "If 40% want that, the duty of the Parliament is making it possible." &lt;ref name="International Herald Tribune"/&gt;

'''Loss of use''' is the inability, due to a [[tort]] or other [[injury]] to use a body part, animal, equipment, [[premises]], or other [[property]].  Law.com defines it as "the inability to use an automobile, premises or some equipment due to damage to the vehicle, premises or articles caused by the negligence or other wrongdoing of another."&lt;ref name=Law&gt;[http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?selected=1186 law.com Law Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schedule loss of use of a member (Workers' Compensation law)==
Under [[workers' compensation]] law, a schedule loss of use is the set amount of compensation an [[employee]] may receive for the inability to use a particular body [[Limb (anatomy)|member]], such as an [[arm]], [[hand]], [[finger]], [[human leg|leg]], [[foot]], or [[toe]].  An injured employee will receive monetary benefits for the loss of use of such a body member during periods of temporary disability associated therewith, and/or at the time a judicial finding is made of permanent impairment.  These monetary benefits are in addition to other [[Employee benefit|benefit]]s for compensation such as medical benefits.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., N.Y. WCL § 15 (New York Workers' Compensation Law section 15, "Schedule  in  case  of  disability").[http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS]&lt;/ref&gt;  An essential basis for calculating a Schedule Loss of Use ("SLU") is often a multiple of the injured employee's pre-injury average weekly wage, or some percentage thereof, as determined by a state's Workers' Compensation Law.  This wage information is utilized in conjunction with a medical assessment by an evaluating physician, together with a schedule which standardizes the value of particular injuries.  This standardization is necessary to ensure Equal Protection while applying a Workers' Compensation scheme.  The physician's loss assessment is converted to a period of weeks, utilizing the schedule published in law, and then this number of weeks is multiplied by the wage basis to determine the total value of the SLU.  Due to the complexity of the calculations involved in determining an SLU, it may be useful to utilize an SLU calculator, such as may be provided on legal, public service, academic, or informational websites.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see the calculators for New York Workers' Compensation Law at http://criscuololaw.com/workers_compensation_and_social_security_disability_resources.php&lt;/ref&gt;    
The [[etymology]] of [[tort]] is from the [[French language|French]] word for twisted—as in [[wrongful]], [[trespassing]], sick, perverted, or [[Disturbed (band)|disturbed]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Unlike in other aspects of [[tort law]], rather than being [[Literal and figurative language|figurative]], the meaning is sometimes literal, whereby a worker's arm has been twisted by machinery, and is rendered useless for work.&lt;ref&gt;Worker's compensation is usually '''not''' considered part of tort law, but is thought of as a statutory scheme that ''replaces'' tort law.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss of use (property)==
Under [[property law]], almost any possible [[property]] can be the subject of loss of use.&lt;ref name=Law /&gt;  This might include equipment, goods, [[inventory]], a [[House|residence]], a [[farm]], a [[motor vehicle]], office building, or [[commercial property]].  For example, the real property can not be used due to a [[chemical spill]], or the car can not be driven because it was damaged in a [[motor vehicle accident]].

When business equipment is damaged the injured business is entitled to a loss of use claim for the damaged property. In the trucking industry this is often referred to as downtime. Downtime claims indemnify for loss of earnings resulting from inability to operate because of damage to a tractor or trailer from an insured peril such as a collision or a fire. These claims can be made against the adverse party’s insurance policy. The loss must be established by presenting the previous income for the damaged equipment. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.landlinemag.com/Magazine/2013/July/Section4/whats-up-with-downtime.aspx|title=Land Line Magazine: The Business Magazine for Professional Truckers|website=Land Line Magazine: The Business Magazine for Professional Truckers|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insurance companies may use various formulas to calculate downtime losses. A common method is to determine gross income for 90 days before the accident, then subtract all variable expenses such as fuel, tolls, oil, etc. to figure a net income amount. Next, divide net income by the days actually driven during the 90 days before the truck was disabled in order to get a daily net loss figure. Finally, multiply the daily income times the number of days the truck is in the repair shop to arrive at your lost income amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.landlinemag.com/Magazine/2013/July/Section4/whats-up-with-downtime.aspx|title=Land Line Magazine: The Business Magazine for Professional Truckers|website=Land Line Magazine: The Business Magazine for Professional Truckers|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Car rental companies charge renters for loss of use in case of accidents, though the charges have been controversial. Insurers want to see the rental company's fleet utilization logs. If the rental company had other unused similar cars at the time, insurers argue the rental company suffered no loss from the unavailability of the damaged car. The Florida Supreme Court supported that interpretation in 2008.&lt;ref name="laplaca"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.autorentalnews.com/channel/fleet-insurance/article/story/2009/11/does-loss-of-use-require-proof-of-lost-revenue.aspx | title=Does Loss of Use Require Proof of Lost Revenue? | publisher=Auto Rental News | date= 2009 | accessdate=24 September 2016 | author=LaPlaca, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flsupreme"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/fl-supreme-court/1155147.html | title=MCI WORLDCOM NETWORK SERVICES, INC., Appellant, v.

'''Mammoth Lakes''' is a town in [[Mono County, California]], the county's only [[Municipal corporation|incorporated community]]. It is located {{convert|9|mi}} northwest of [[Mount Morrison (California)|Mount Morrison]], at an elevation of {{convert|7880|ft}}.&lt;ref name=gnis /&gt;&lt;ref name=CGN&gt;{{California's Geographic Names|1182}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the [[2010 United States Census]], the population was 8,234, reflecting an increase of 1,141 from the 7,093 counted in the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]].

==History==
The [[Mono people]] were the first settlers of the Mammoth Lakes area, thousands of years ago. They settled in the valley but traveled by foot to other lands when trading with different tribes.&lt;ref name="Mammoth Lakes Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Mammoth Mountain, California|url=http://www.pacificrimalliance.org/F.PublicAffairs/SkiHistory/historyResorts/Mammoth.html|website=Pacific Rim Snow Sports Alliance|accessdate=2015-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European history of Mammoth Lakes started in 1877, when four prospectors staked a claim on Mineral Hill, south of the current town, along Old Mammoth Road. In 1878, the Mammoth Mining Company was organized to mine Mineral Hill, which caused a [[gold rush]]. By the end of 1878, 1500 people settled in the mining camp called [[Old Mammoth, California|Mammoth City]]. By 1880, the company had shut down, and by 1888, the population declined to less than 10 people. By the early 1900s, the town of Mammoth was informally established near Mammoth Creek. The economics of the original town was based on logging and tourism.&lt;ref name=OldMammoth&gt;{{cite book|title=Old Mammoth|first=Adele|last=Reed|year=1982|publisher=[[Genny Smith]] Books|location=Mammoth Lakes, California|isbn=0-931378-04-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first post office at Mammoth Lakes opened in 1923.&lt;ref name=CGN /&gt;

In 2004, the Mammoth Ski Museum opened in town.  The museum featured many vintage artifacts, photographs, and posters.  A movie documenting the life of the founder of the ski resort ([[Dave McCoy]]) and those of early famous skiers in the area is shown.  In 2010, photographs taken by Dave McCoy were featured in an exhibit at the museum.

In 2008, after a jury trial, the Mono County Superior Court entered a $43 million judgment against the Town of Mammoth Lakes for breach of a development agreement.  The California Court of Appeal, Third District, affirmed the judgment in December 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

The town is surrounded by mountains: on the west, [[Mammoth Mountain]] looms over the town, while to the south, the [[Sherwin Range]] dominates the view. This hilly terrain and the high altitude makes the area great for [[altitude training|high-altitude athletic training]], including among elite [[long-distance running|long-distance runners]], who live and train in the thin air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/mar/24/sports/la-sp-mammoth-olympics-20120325 |title=U.S. distance runners get into tip-mountaintop shape for Olympics |last=Baxter |first=Kevin |date=2012-03-24 |work=The Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2013-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town is surrounded by acres of [[Sierra Nevada lower montane forest|forest]] and is bordered by the [[Ansel Adams Wilderness|Ansel Adams]] and [[John Muir Wilderness]] Areas. The eastern entrance of [[Yosemite National Park]] is located {{convert|32|mi|km}} north of town. The town is situated in the southwestern, mountainous part of [[Mono County, California]].

===Climate===
Due to its high elevation, Mammoth Lakes has a [[continental Mediterranean climate|dry-summer humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dsb''), with long, very snowy winters, and warm, dry summers. Snowfall is particularly heavy from December through March, and averages {{convert|206|in|m|sigfig=3}} per season. On average, there are 21 days of {{convert|80|°F|0}}+ highs, twenty-one days of highs under {{convert|32|F|C|1}} and 4.6 nights of sub-{{convert|0|°F|0}} lows annually.

==Economy==
Mammoth Lakes' economy is primarily tourism-based. For example, Mammoth Mountain Ski Resort is the top ski destination in California. A 13% tax is added to the rental of any lodging facility and campgrounds for stays of less than a month. There are more than 4,599 rental units in Mammoth Lakes and the lodging industry generates around two-thirds of the gross revenue of the Town of Mammoth Lakes. As well as the pull from winter extreme sports, Mammoth Lakes also benefits greatly from tourism in the summer from people who visit to camp, hike and fish.

The Mammoth Lakes [[real estate]] market has gone through ups and downs over the past few decades. In 1980, an [[earthquake]] with magnitude of 6.1 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]] sent area property values plummeting on fears of a potential volcanic eruption similar to the [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens]]. A significant real estate surplus formed after this, during which Mammoth Lakes had a total of over 1200 properties on the market. The development of the Mammoth Mountain ski area has had a direct effect on [[house|housing]] in more recent years. The tourist market has led to an explosion of property values. This peaked in 2003 when the median property value reached $750,000. Another peak occurred in 2006 with the sale of the Mammoth Mountain ski area to [[Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide|Starwood Capital Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Hotel Mogul to Buy Mammoth Ski Area|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/05/business/fi-mammoth5|date=October 5, 2005|last=Sahagun|first=Louis|author2=Roger Vincent}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of February 2010, the median listing price was $460,000. This represents a drop of over 38% from the peak reached in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mammoth Mountain Median Listing Price|work=Zillow|url=http://www.zillow.com/local-info/CA-Mammoth-Lakes-home-value/r_35858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) Program''' incentivizes business and real estate investment in low-income communities of the United States via a federal [[tax credit]]. The program is administered by the US Treasury Department's [[Community Development Financial Institutions Fund|Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund]] and allocated by local Community Development Entities (CDEs) across the United States.

==History==
The New Markets Tax Credit Program was established as part of the [[Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000]]. The goal of the program is to spur revitalization efforts of low-income and impoverished communities across the United States and Territories. The NMTC Program provides tax credit incentives to investors for equity investments in certified Community Development Entities, which invest in low-income communities.&lt;ref name=journalaccountancy1&gt;{{cite news|last=Fiore|first=Nicholas|title=The Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000: New incentives for taxpayers investing in distressed communities|url=http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/Issues/2001/Aug/TheCommunityRenewalTaxReliefActOf2000.htm|accessdate=19 September 2013|newspaper=Journal of Accountancy|date=August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The credit equals 39% of the investment paid out (5% in each of the first three years, then 6% in the final four years, for a total of 39%) over seven years (more accurately, six years and one day of the seventh year).  A Community Development Entity must have a primary mission of investing in low-income communities and persons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdfifund.gov/what_we_do/programs_id.asp?programID=5 ''US Department of Treasury: Community Development Financial Institutions Fund.''].&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept behind the NMTC emerged in the late 1990s, when numerous foundations and think tanks were working to popularize the idea of using business-oriented mechanisms to help disadvantaged communities increase wealth and jobs.  For example, business, community, academic, and public sector participants at the 1997 [[The American Assembly|American Assembly]] meeting issued a report urging business leaders to reinvest in urban areas in the U.S.  The final report also pushed nonprofit and government
officials to help lead this new effort to open untapped markets through a fostering of "community capitalism." It defined community capitalism as a "for-profit, business-driven expansion of investment, job creation, and economic opportunities in distressed communities, with government and the community sectors playing key supportive roles." To accomplish this revival, participants called for improving access to capital (especially through equity investment) and ensuring greater technical assistance for businesses. These were seen as the two key ways of "energizing community capitalism in distressed areas". The report  set out crucial components of the future New Markets initiative. The American Assembly disseminated the final report widely, including sending it to the [[White House]] and [[United States Congress|Congress]]. [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Al Gore]], in support of the conference conclusions, stated that, "The greatest untapped markets In the world are right here at home, in our distressed communities."

==Overview==
The [[Community Development Financial Institutions Fund|Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund]] in the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] has been authorized to administer the program. '''Community Development Entities (CDEs)''' apply to the CDFI Fund each year not for tax credits directly, but for an award of "allocation authority"—that is, the authority to raise a certain amount of capital, or '''Qualified Equity Investments (QEIs)''' from investors.  In the first year of the program (2001), the CDFI Fund awarded $1 billion in allocation authority to CDEs, enabling those CDEs to raise $1 billion in QEIs from investors, which enabled those investors to reduce their federal tax liability by $390 million (or 39% of the amount they invested in the CDEs) over seven years.  For the investors to be able to claim the credits over the seven-year compliance period, the CDEs must use "substantially all" ("Sub All") of the QEIs from investors to make '''Qualified Low Income Community Investments (QLICIs)''' in '''Qualified Active Low Income Community Businesses (QALICBs)''' located in '''Low Income Communities (LICs)'''.  (Each of the previous terms—CDE, QEI, "Substantially All," QLICI, QALICB, and LIC—are defined in the Internal Revenue Code and other federal guidance.)

==Allocation Rounds==
Through 2010, there have been eight NMTC allocation rounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdfifund.gov/docs/nmtc/2010/NMTCQEIReport-October-2010.pdf CDFI Fund]&lt;/ref&gt; Allocation awards for a prior round are typically made within the first quarter of the calendar year after a round. In the eighth round (2010), the CDFI fund awarded the $3.5 billion allocation authority pool (which would generate $1.365B in tax credits for investors; $3.5B x 39% = $1.365B) to 99 CDEs out of a pool of 250 applicants, who had requested allocations totaling $23.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdfifund.gov/news_events/Treasury-Announces-3.5-Billion-in-Awards-For-Economic-Development-and-Community-Revitalization.asp CDFI Fund]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms==

===CDEs===
From the CDFI Fund website:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdfifund.gov/what_we_do/programs_id.asp?programID=10#7 CDFI]&lt;/ref&gt;

:A CDE, or Community Development Entity, is a domestic corporation or partnership that is an intermediary vehicle for the provision of loans, investments, or financial counseling in Low-Income Communities (LICs). Benefits of being certified as a CDE include being able to apply to the CDFI Fund to receive a New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) allocation to offer its investors in exchange for equity investments in the CDE and/or its subsidiaries; or to receive loans or investments from other CDEs that have received NMTC allocations.

:To become certified as a CDE, an organization must submit a [http://www.cdfifund.gov/docs/certification/CDE/CDEcertificationApplication.pdf CDE Certification Application] to the Fund for review. The application must demonstrate that the applicant meets each of the following requirements to become certified:
:* Be a legal entity at the time of application;
:* Have a primary mission of serving LICs; and
:* Maintain accountability to the residents of its targeted LICs.

===QEIs===
A QEI is a Qualified Equity Investment.&lt;ref name="irs.gov"&gt;https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/atgnmtc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; An investor with a QEI is entitled to claim the NMTC, if a credit allowance date occurs during the investor's taxable year. For each equity investment in the CDE, examiners should determine whether the investment is a QEI for purposes of IRC §45D.

===QLICI===
A QLICI &lt;ref name="irs.gov"/&gt; is a Qualified Low-Income Community Investment. The CDE must invest the QEIs in QLICIs. The investments can be:
:* A capital or equity investment in, or loan to, any qualified active low-income community business.
:* The purchase from another CDE of any loan that was a QLICI either at the time the loan was made or at the time the CDE purchases it. It is not necessary for the CDE from which the loan is purchased to have received an NMTC allocation. See Treas. Reg. §1.45D-1(d)(1)(ii)(B) if the original loan was made before the CDE was certified. See Treas. Reg. §1.45D-1(d)(ii)(1)(C) regarding multiple purchases of a loan, and Treas. Reg. §1.45D-1(d)(1)(ii)(D) for examples.
:* Providing financial counseling or other services to qualified active low-income community businesses located in, or residents of, a low-income community.
:* An equity investment in, or loan to, another CDE, but only to the extent that the second, third or fourth CDE uses the investment or loan to make a QLICI. See Treas. Reg. §1.45D-1(d)(1)(iv) for complete discussion and examples of investments by CDEs in other CDEs.

===QALICB===
QALICB &lt;ref name="financefund.org"&gt;http://www.financefund.org/pdfs/NMLpolicy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is a Qualified Active Low-Income Community Business. QALICBs are any for-profit or non-profit corporation or partnership if;
:i. At least 50% of the total gross income of that business is derived from the active conduct of its business within any QLIC,
:ii. A substantial portion (defined as at least 40%) of the use of the tangible property of that business (whether owned or leased) is within any QLIC,
:iii. substantial portion (defined as at least 40%) of the services performed by that business' employees are performed in any QLIC; the business is not primarily holding collectibles.
:iv. If (ii) or (iii) are 50% or more than (i) is deemed to have been met.
:v. Less than 5% of the property is attributable to collectables (e.g. art and antiques), other than those held for sale in the ordinary course of business or is attributable to nonqualified financial property (e.g. debt instruments with term in excess of 18 months).

===LIC===
Low Income community (LIC) &lt;ref name="financefund.org"/&gt; is any population census tract that meets one of the following criteria (as reported in the most recently completed decennial census published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census):
:* i The poverty rate for such census tract is at least 20%; or
:* ii The Median Family Income (MFI) of such census tract does not exceed 80% of: (a) The statewide MFI, if the tract is not located within a metropolitan area, or (b) The greater of statewide MFI or the metropolitan area MFI, if the tract is located within a metropolitan area.

== Status of the Program in the Internal Revenue Code ==
The New Markets Tax Credit is outlined in [http://www.taxalmanac.org/index.php/Sec._45D._New_markets_tax_credit Section 45D] of the Internal Revenue Code. Unlike many other tax credit programs (such as the [[Low-Income Housing Tax Credit|Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program]], which was made a permanent part of the Internal Revenue Code in 1993 under the Clinton administration), as a non-permanent program, the New Markets Tax Credit has required renewal during each session of Congress. Most recently, the New Markets Tax Credit program was extended as part of Section 733 of the '''Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novoco.com/hottopics/resource_files/hr4853_121510.pdf NOVOCO]&lt;/ref&gt;

The NMTC program expired on December 31, 2011, along with several dozen of the so-called "tax extenders".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independentsector.org/uploads/Policy_PDFs/x-6-12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was retroactively renewed in H.R. 8, the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]] for another 2 years until January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr8/text&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. Senators [[Jay Rockefeller]] (D-West Virginia) and [[Roy Blunt]] (R-Missouri) introduced S.B. 1133, "New Markets Tax Credit Extension Act of 2013" in June 2013 to permanently add New Market Tax Credits to the Internal Revenue Code, however the program expired in January 2014 without the bill's passing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradley|first=Bill|title=New Market Tax Credits Set to Expire|url=http://nextcity.org/equityfactor/entry/new-market-tax-credits-set-to-expire|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/s1133/text&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8388">'''The Orphans' Decree''' was a law in Yemen mandating the [[forced conversion]] of [[Jewish]] orphans to Islam promulgated by the [[Zaydi]].  Although the law stipulated that any pre-pubescent [[dhimmi]] whose parents had died when he or she was a minor could be seized by the state and converted to Islam, it applied only to Jews because Jews were the only resident dhimmi in Yemen when the decree was issued, or revived, in the 17th century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}  According to one source, the decree has "no parallel in other countries".&lt;ref name = "Eraqi-Klorman"/&gt;

This law, like all laws applying to dhimmi, was applied more or less ruthlessly depending upon the inclination local and royal officials. &lt;ref name = "Yehuda Nini"/&gt; It was aggressively enforced at least some of the time and in some regions under [[Imam Yahya]] (1918–1948).&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Reeva Spector; Laskier, Michael Menachem &amp; Reguer, Sara, eds. (2003) ''The Jews of the Middle East and North Africa in Modern Times''. New York: Columbia University Press; p. 392&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Yehuda Nini"/&gt;

Although [[Forced conversion#Islam|forced conversion]] is not widely recognized under Islamic laws, historian and [[Arabist]] [[Shelomo Dov Goitein]] believes that a forced conversion of orphans could have been justified by the revelation attributed to [[Muhammad]] that states: "Every person is born to the natural religion [Islam], and only his parents make a [[Jew]] or a [[Christian]] out of him."&lt;ref name = "Yehuda Nini"/&gt;

==Before Ottoman rule==
There are only some fragmentary and isolated accounts about the enforcing of the decree before Ottoman rule. It was not enforced equally in every part of Yemen. There were places where Jews were able to hide orphaned children and protect them from being forcibly converted to Islam.&lt;ref name = "Yehuda Nini"/&gt; Still there are several accounts about the enforcement of the decree.&lt;ref name = "Yehuda Nini"/&gt;

[[Shalom Shabazi]], a Jewish poet who lived in 17th century Yemen, wrote in one of his poems about "stealing orphans". A translation of the poem runs thus: "Thousands of orphaned souls, both boys and girls, were wrested from the arms of their parents, grandfather and grandmother, by force by the nations all the days of the many kings of Yemen."&lt;ref name = "Yehuda Nini"/&gt;

[[Rabbi]] [[Hayyim Habshush]] writes that by the end of [[Al-Mansur Ali I]]'s rule in 1809 the [[Imam]] built palaces for his sons "and when he settled his sons in those palaces he ordered that the orphaned Jewish children be seized and converted and made servants and scribes in the palaces." In the same account Habshush testifies that there were some "who concealed the children in their homes until they were fully grown."&lt;ref name = "Yehuda Nini"/&gt;

One more account is dated to 1850. Jewish scholar [[Amram Qorah]] recalls a story about his orphaned father, who was hidden by a Jewish family in their home and thereby escaped a forced conversion.&lt;ref name = "Yehuda Nini"/&gt;

==After the end of Ottoman rule==
[[Tudor Parfitt]] compares the Orphans' Decree to "draconian measures introducing the [[Cantonist#Strains within the Jewish community|forced conscription of Jewish children]] into the [[Czarist]]'s army" in Russia.&lt;ref name = "Tudor Parfitt"/&gt; Concerning the reintroduction of the Orphans' Decree in Yemen in 1921, after the end of Ottoman rule, Parfitt says that "in the first ten years" it "was implemented with great rigour."&lt;ref name = "Tudor Parfitt"/&gt;

Once again the decree was not implemented equally in every part of Yemen. In some places the authorities turned "a blind eye" to escaped and hidden children, but, in the places the Decree was implemented, troops were sent to search for escaped children, and the leaders of Jewish communities that were suspected of hiding the children were "imprisoned and tortured".&lt;ref name = "Tudor Parfitt"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Yehuda Nini"/&gt;

In 1923 the Jewish community of [[Al Hudaydah]] suffered the abduction of 42 orphaned children, some of whom managed to escape.&lt;ref name = "Tudor Parfitt"/&gt;

A witness account from [[Sana'a]] recalls an abduction of two fatherless siblings, a brother and a sister. The children were forcibly taken from their mother's arms and beaten to make them convert to Islam. The Jewish community offered to pay for the children's release to their family, but Islamic law prohibits accepting money to avert such a conversion. The witness compares the ceremony of the conversion of the siblings to a "funeral procession".&lt;ref name = "Tudor Parfitt"/&gt;

After getting out of the orphanage, converted Jewish boys were often enlisted as soldiers. The girls made a valuable asset as brides because there were no relatives who needed to be paid a [[bride price]] in order to marry them.&lt;ref name = "Tudor Parfitt"/&gt;

Jewish communities responded by acting quickly when children were orphaned, sometimes taking children and placing them with Jewish families living in dense Jewish settlements, especially [[Sana]], large enough that a Jewish family might lack Muslim neighbors who would notice the addition of a child to a family.&lt;ref name = "Yehuda Nini"/&gt;  However, because "hidden" children might be discovered and forcibly converted, relatives or the Jewish community sometimes arranged to take them out of the Yemen; cases are recorded of Jews making the arduous journey to settle in the [[Land of Israel]] with orphaned relatives or unrelated children they had adopted in order to escape the threat that the children might be taken for conversion.&lt;ref name = "Yehuda Nini"/&gt; In the first-half of the twentieth-century, the Chief Rabbi of Yemen, [[Yihya Yitzhak Halevi]], worked tirelessly to save Jewish orphans from falling into the hands of Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Yehiel Hibshush, ''Shənei Ha-me'oroth'' ('''שני המאורות'''),  Tel-Aviv, 1987, pp. 10–11 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; From about 1920, British imperial control of [[Aden]] provided a safe haven to which orphaned children could be taken; clandestine caravans carrying orphans and traveling by night are known to have gone from various parts of Yemen to take orphaned children to the sanctuary of the British Empire.&lt;ref name = "Yehuda Nini"/&gt;

An orphaned boy or boy or girl could also be very quickly married, since married people had the legal status of adults and could not be taken for forcible conversion.&lt;ref name = "Yehuda Nini"/&gt;

==Modern day expression==
The ''Orphans' Decree'' has left its imprint in Modern Israel, where playwright, Shlomo Dori, in his play ''A New Life'' (1927), raises the concern of being imprisoned for hiding two Jewish orphans, and where actor and composer, Sa'adia Dhamari, in the musical ''The Bearer [of Good Tidings]'' (1957), makes his chief protagonists Jewish orphans who had converted to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Yedid &amp; Danny Bar-Maoz (ed.), ''Ascending the Palm Tree – An Anthology of the Yemenite Jewish Heritage'', E'ele BeTamar: Rehovot 2018, p. 388 {{ISBN|978-965-7121-33-7}}; S. Dori, ''New Life'' [play], pub. in: ''From Yemen to Zion'', Tel Aviv 1938, pp. 286–295&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kleiner Perkins===
{{main|Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers}}
Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers is a [[venture capital firm]] located in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]] in [[Silicon Valley]].

Although there are fewer women than men in both junior and senior positions employed by Kleiner Perkins, its gender gap is smaller than that of most other venture capital firms and its most prominent female partner, [[Mary Meeker]], has called it "the best place to be for a woman in the business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8228649/mary-meeker-ellen-pao-kleiner-perkins|title=The 'Queen of the Internet' defends Kleiner Perkins in gender discrimination trial|first=Nitasha|last=Tiku|publisher=The Verge|date=2015-03-17|accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of action==
The original case was filed under the [[California Fair Employment and Housing Act]] and contained three causes of action:&lt;ref name="Complaint"/&gt; 

*Employment discrimination based on gender:

{{quote|12940.  It is an unlawful employment practice, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification, or, except where based upon applicable security regulations established by the United States or the State of California:
(a) For an employer, because of the race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, or military and veteran status of any person, to refuse to hire or employ the person or to refuse to select the person for a training program leading to employment, or to bar or to discharge the person  from employment or from a training program leading to employment, or to discriminate against the person in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.&lt;ref name = 12940etseq &gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=12001-13000&amp;file=12940-12951 GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION 12940-12951]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

*Workplace retaliation: 

{{quote|(h) For any employer, labor organization, employment agency, or person to discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part.&lt;ref name = 12940etseq /&gt;}}

*Failure to take reasonable steps to prevent gender discrimination: 

{{quote|(k) For an employer, labor organization, employment agency, apprenticeship training program, or any training program leading to employment, to fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring.&lt;ref name = 12940etseq /&gt;}}

Following her termination the complaint was amended and a second count of retaliation, termination, was added.&lt;ref name = Complaint /&gt; The [[actual damages]] demanded by the suit totalled $16 million. This is approximately the amount that Pao floated in a  conversation with COO Eric Keller when asked what it would take to change her mind about staying at the company. Pao explained that she "wanted my payment to be enough so it was a meaningful amount to Kleiner Perkins, so they saw it would be painful to not fix problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/03/kleiner-attacks-pao-stand-resentful-greedy/|title=Kleiner attacks Pao on the stand as resentful and greedy|first=Davey|last=Alba|publisher=Wired|date=2015-03-12|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiff also made a plea for [[punitive damages]].&lt;ref name = PDRECODE &gt;[http://recode.net/2015/03/17/judge-says-pao-needs-to-do-better-to-prove-case-for-punitive-damages/ "Judge Says Pao Needs to Do Better to Prove Case for Punitive Damages"] Liz Gannes ''Re/code'' March 17, 2015, accessed March 18, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Although Judge Harold Kahn initially leaned toward denying this motion, he approved it on March 21, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/21/8267273/judge-in-kleiner-perkins-trial-just-ruled-that|title=Ellen Pao can sue Kleiner Perkins for punitive damages, rules judge|first=Nitasha|last=Tiku|publisher=The Verge|date=2015-03-21|accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a trial to a [[jury]] of 12 who, under the rules of the court, were permitted to submit written questions to witnesses. The judge was also permitted to question witnesses. Witnesses were disclosed and [[Deposition (law)|deposed]] prior to the trial and transcripts of their depositions were available to counsel for the opposing sides and could be compared to the testimony of the witness in the courtroom. There were hundreds of [[exhibit (legal)|exhibits]] consisting of documents and emails which the court had audio-visual equipment to display to the witness, jury, and audience.

===Plaintiff's case===
The plaintiff presented her case first, arguing that men were promoted ahead of women, that ideas coming from women were more quickly dismissed and that women who experienced sexual harassment received little support. Pao claimed that Ajit Nazre, the partner who initiated a sexual relationship with her, was responsible for much of this harassment. Pao said that he began excluding her from important meetings and emails after she ended the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/ellen-pao-testifies-in-silicon-valley-gender-bias-trial/article23374197/|title=Ellen Pao testifies in Silicon Valley gender-bias trial|first=Robert|last=Burnson|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=2015-03-09|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; To characterize the company's response, her case explained that $22,000 was deducted from his paycheck once and that there was no strong desire to reprimand him until an outside investigation was able to link him to multiple instances of harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/03/02/ellen-pao-kleiner-perkins-ted-schlein-cocky/24267571/|title=Man Ellen Pao accused of retaliation had bonus docked|first=Elizabeth|last=Wiese|publisher=USA Today|date=2015-03-02|accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally Pao said that she felt the need to move from green tech to the digital division to avoid him. Pao was asked if she objected to having Nazre's office moved to the same corridor as her own. However, she claimed that when she said "yes", the company responded by trying to move her office rather than cancelling the move of Nazre's.&lt;ref name="recode9" /&gt;

It was explained that Pao sourced an investment in [[RPX Corporation]], a company designed to fight [[patent trolls]], which led to an [[IPO]]. While arguing that this was adequate reason for a promotion, her side disputed KPCB's rationale for keeping her off the board of directors.&lt;ref name="owns"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/09/ellen-pao-owns-the-room/|title=Ellen Pao "Owns The Room"|first=Colleen|last=Taylor|publisher=TechCrunch|date=2015-03-09|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that the policies for how many investments and how many board seats could involve junior partners were unevenly applied between women and men. Performance reviews were raised to show contradictory evaluations such as "too bold" and "too quiet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2015/03/29/ellen-pao-trial-recap/|title=5 things we learned about Silicon Valley culture from the Ellen Pao Trial|first=Patrick|last=Kulp|publisher=Mashable|date=2015-03-29|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As further evidence that Pao's work for the company was not appreciated, they pointed to potential investments in Twitter and [[The Climate Corporation]] which were turned down after Pao proposed them, both of which were seen to be profitable later on.&lt;ref name="RCMM" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/03/24/ellen-pao-wanted-kleiner-perkins-to-invest-in-twitter-in-2008-kleiner-perkins-passed/|title=Ellen Pao wanted Kleiner Perkins to invest in Twitter in 2008|first=Mark|last=Sullivan|publisher=Venture Beat|date=2015-03-24|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of incidents were described in the plaintiff's case including a [[Valentine's day]] gift that she considered inappropriate, a conversation in a company jet that she felt objectified women, a dinner in [[Al Gore]]'s apartment to which no women were invited and a ski trip which invited one woman on a technicality.&lt;ref name="wired18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="recode25"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recode.net/2015/02/25/all-male-ski-trip-and-no-women-at-al-gore-dinner-kleiners-chien-takes-the-stand-in-pao-lawsuit/|title=All-male ski trip and no women at Al Gore dinner: Kleiner's Chien takes the stand in Pao lawsuit|first1=Liz|last1=Gannes|first2=Nellie|last2=Bowles|publisher=Recode|date=2015-02-25|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pao stated that she did not speak out about these when they occurred because she did not want a "reputation as a complainer".&lt;ref name="recode13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recode.net/2015/03/13/liveblog-ellen-pao-answers-questions-from-the-jury/|title=Liveblog: Ellen Pao Answers Questions From The Jury|first1=Liz|last1=Gannes|first2=Nellie|last2=Bowles|publisher=Recode|date=2015-03-13|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues with her last year at Kleiner Perkins concerned a memorandum she sent on January 4, 2012 and an alleged absence of training and policies to prevent discrimination. The plaintiff argued that the defendant took several steps to cover up aspects that reflected poorly on its record of gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mainenewsonline.com/content/15023052-there-was-no-distribution-gender-discrimination-policy-until|title=There was no distribution of gender discrimination policy until 2012, says Kleiner Perkins|first=Julia|last=Hawkins|publisher=Maine News|date=2015-02-27|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defendant's case===
The defendant's case placed emphasis on its large ratio of women compared to other venture capital firms. An example statistic was that it had 11 female partners and a 20% female staff compared to the average of 7-11% based on studies in 2011 and 2013.&lt;ref name="EP KP face off"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_27561160/former-vc-ellen-pao-and-powerhouse-firm-kleiner?source=pkg|title=Ellen Pao, Kleiner Perkins face off in $16M sex discrimination trial|work=San Jose Mercury News|author=Heather Somerville|date=20 February 2015|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2012/05/female-partners-venture-capital-firms-fem-kleiner-perkins/ |title=The Depressing Gender Gap at the Nation's Top 71 Venture Capital Firms|first1=Kelly|last1=Faircloth|first2=Adrianne|last2=Jeffries|publisher=Observer |date=2012-05-31 |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 study found that this number dropped to 4% when only senior partners were considered.&lt;ref name="senior-4-100"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2014/02/06/venture-capitals-stunning-lack-of-female-decision-makers/|title=Venture capital's stunning lack of female decision-makers|first=Dan|last=Primack|publisher=Fortune|date=2014-02-06|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defense also argued that Pao was paid more than most of her male colleagues. While salaries had previously been redacted from legal documents, the trial revealed that Pao's salary after bonuses eventually reached a peak of $560,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recode.net/2015/02/26/follow-the-money-did-men-make-quintuple-what-women-made-at-kleiner-perkins/|title=Follow the Money: Did Men Earn Quintuple What Women Made at Kleiner Perkins?|first1=Liz|last1=Gannes|first2=Nellie|last2=Bowles|publisher=Recode|date=2015-02-26|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also pointed to several opportunities that were afforded to Pao including a speech coach, mentorship from John Doerr and a longer career than that of many other junior partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/technology/kleiner-perkins-portrays-ellen-pao-as-combative-and-resentful-in-sex-bias-trial.html|title=Kleiner Perkins Portrays Ellen Pao as Combative and Resentful in Sex Bias Trial|first=David|last=Streitfeld|publisher=The New York Times|date=2015-03-11|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; To argue that Pao's firing was justified, they presented several negative performance reviews that she received and frequently described her as "entitled" and "not a team player".&lt;ref name="wired18"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/03/kleiner-putting-ellen-paos-personality-trial/|title=Kleiner is Putting Ellen Pao's Personality on Trial|first=Davey|last=Alba|publisher=Wired|date=2015-03-18|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kleiner Perkins contended that Pao's job description had been mostly managerial and that limiting her involvement in investing was not a sign of discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/02/24/ellen-pao-trial-kleiner-perkins-discrimination-silicon-valley-venture-capital/23908291/|title=Ellen Pao lawyer: Kleiner Perkins 'not a level playing field'|first=Elizabeth|last=Weise|publisher=USA Today|date=2015-02-26|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also said that promotions to the senior partner position were rare with 20 of the 25 people previously in Pao's position also being passed over.&lt;ref name="Doerr testifies"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_27645378/jurors-ellen-pao-discrimination-case-question-key-witness?source=pkg|title=Ellen Pao trial: Doerr says tech, VC firms would do better 'if they hired more women'|work=San Jose Mercury News|author=Heather Somerville|date=4 March 2015|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defense brought in emails to show that Pao expected to be fired and suggested that some of them provided evidence that she was plotting a lawsuit.&lt;ref name="recode11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recode.net/2015/03/11/an-alternate-narrative-of-ellen-pao-emerges-under-cross-examination/|title=An Alternative Narrative of Ellen Pao Emerges Under Cross-Examination|first1=Liz|last1=Gannes|first2=Nellie|last2=Bowles|publisher=Recode|date=2015-03-11|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also argued over whether her acceptance of [[severance package|severance pay]] constituted a tacit approval that the company was within its rights to fire her. The package was potentially valued at $400,000 but Pao did not receive the full amount on account of finding a job within less than a year.&lt;ref name="liveblog4" /&gt; There are also reports that she turned it down entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/suzanne-lucas/why-everyone-looks-bad-in-the-ellen-pao-case.html|title=Why everyone looks bad in the Ellen Pao case|first=Suzanne|last=Lucas|publisher=Inc|date=2015-03-30|accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stating that many of the plaintiff's [[statute of limitations|claims were stale]], KPCB's side offered some explanations for the incidents she described and alleged that she saw discrimination where none existed.&lt;ref name=RC032415/&gt; They claimed that this provided further evidence that she was an unpleasant coworker.

The defendant tried to introduce another line of argument based on Pao having a financial motive for filing the lawsuit. They stated in a [[Sidebar (law)|sidebar]] that she may have done this to help alleviate the financial troubles of her husband [[Buddy Fletcher]], a hedge fund manager who filed for bankruptcy in 2012. However, Judge Harold Kahn ruled out this defence stating that it would place undue scrutiny on the plaintiff's personal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/12/judge-denies-kleiner-perkins-bid-to-discuss-ellen-paos-financial-motives-in-court/|title=Judge Denies Kleiner Perkins' Bid To Discuss Ellen Pao's Financial Motives In Court|first=Colleen|last=Taylor|publisher=TechCrunch|date=2015-03-12|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Pao maintained that their money had always been separate due to a [[prenuptial agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plainsite.org/dockets/download.html?id=215062716&amp;z=d0d40f4c|title=Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion to Strike and Tax Defendant's Costs|publisher=Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe|date=2015-06-05|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Fletcher was reading news about the trial and not making courtroom appearances, on the advice of Pao and her lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Reset.html?id=pBdVDgAAQBAJ|title=Reset: My fight for inclusion and lasting change|first=Ellen|last=Pao|publisher=Spiegel &amp; Grau|year=2017|accessdate=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Testimony===
While most of the witnesses had some affiliation with Kleiner Perkins, many of them had left the firm by the time the trial took place. Some witnesses, such as John Doerr, were called by both the plaintiff and defense lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recode.net/2015/03/04/a-star-witness-for-both-sides-somehow-john-doerr-makes-both-ellen-pao-and-kleiner-perkins-look-good/|title=A Star Witness for Both Sides?

Kleiner Perkins|url=http://recode.net/2015/02/24/vcs-in-bathrobes-women-asked-to-play-secretary-and-angry-texts-day-one-of-pao-v-kleiner-perkins/|accessdate=March 8, 2015|work=[[Re/code]]|date=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hermle countered that other men not shown were not promoted and that those three were seen as assets because they had started businesses before being hired.

The first witness called was Tracy "Trae" Vassallo who agreed to testify despite remembering a conversation in which Pao called her "untrustworthy". Her appearance was described as a surprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/3/8141053/ellen-pao-kleiner-perkins-venture-capital|title=The Ellen Pao trial is spilling Silicon Valley secrets|first=Natasha|last=Tiku|publisher=The Verge|date=2015-03-03|accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having received a promotion to senior partner after Pao's termination, Vassallo testified that she still enjoyed working for KPCB but had problems with Chien and Nazre. About Nazre, she said he accosted her while in a bath robe and propositioned her at a dinner after lying that it would involve other contacts of theirs. She testified that her boss Ray Lane told her that she "should be flattered" by his advances and asked her to "talk to her husband" before deciding what to do. Lane denied making the former comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/kleiner-s-lane-tells-jury-partner-won-promotion-after-sex-affair|title=Kleiner's Lane tells jury partner won promotion after affair|first1=Karen|last1=Gullo|first2=Eric|last2=Newcomer|publisher=Bloomberg|date=2015-03-02|accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with explaining that she confided in Pao and filed the complaint which eventually led to Nazre's termination, Vassallo mentioned the seating plan of a meeting in which she and Pao were told to sit in the back. Her description was "it sounds petty, but people were arranged in the room around how much input they'd have in the discussion."&lt;ref name="recode24" /&gt;

The second witness was Chi-Hua Chien who confirmed that he organized the ski trip and the Al Gore dinner, both of which had only male guests. For the ski trip, he said this was done to ease the logistics of condo sharing and that if the trip were repeated in another year, it would have involved more women to make up for this. He denied the plaintiff's claim that he said "women kill the buzz." Regarding the dinner, a deposition video was brought up in which [[Aileen Lee]] testified that she and John Doerr complained about the lack of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_27444497/ellen-pao-seeking-16-million-sex-discrimination-lawsuit|title=Ellen Pao seeking $16 million in sex discrimination lawsuit against Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers|first=Heather|last=Somerville|publisher=Mercury News|date=2015-02-02|accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pao said she felt humiliated because she lived in the building where the event was being held and had to explain to the guests passing by that she was not one of them.&lt;ref name="owns" /&gt; Pao's side presented emails that showed Chien complaining about her in a vulgar way. Chien stated that he was collegial at first and only developed problems with Pao later on. The defense also argued that Chien would not have been named as a trustee of Lee's firm Cowboy Ventures if his respect for women had been doubted.&lt;ref name="recode25" /&gt;

Kleiner Perkins CFO Susan Biglieri testified that Mary Meeker and Beth Seidenberg were the first two women in the firm's history to reach its highest rank of "managing member". Pao's legal team argued that these promotions in 2011 and 2012 were made to save face in the wake of Pao's discrimination complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/02/ellen-pao-trial-kleiner-perkins-says-didnt-distribute-gender-discrimination-policy-2012/|title=Kleiner Perkins says it didn't distribute gender discrimination policy until 2012|first=Davey|last=Alba|publisher=Wired|date=2015-02-26|accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biglieri also testified that the firm's anti-discrimination policy, though distributed internally, was not posted on the website until after Ellen Pao filed her lawsuit. The plaintiff also showed that an Equal Opportunity Employment policy had to be written in 2012 after COO Eric Keller failed to find one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recode.net/2015/03/12/kleiner-perkins-wrote-an-hr-policy-in-wake-of-female-partner-complaints/|title=Kleiner Perkins Wrote HR Policy After Female Partner Complaints|first1=Liz|last1=Gannes|first2=Nellie|last2=Bowles|publisher=Recode|date=2015-03-12|accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rejecting claims that she was hired into an operating role, Pao explained that she initially turned down the job offer from Kleiner Perkins but arranged with John Doerr to make it "more senior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/when-kleiner-perkins-first-offered-ellen-pao-a-job-she-turned-it-down-2015-3|title=When Kleiner Perkins first offered Ellen Pao a job, she turned it down|first=Sam|last=Colt|publisher=Business Insider|date=2015-03-09|accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Pao's duties included reviewing 1,800 [[iFund]] applications, writing part of Mary Meeker's USA Inc report and ghostwriting many of Doerr's speeches including a [[TED Talk]].&lt;ref name="recode9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RCMM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recode.net/2015/03/16/liveblog-mary-meeker-testifies-in-paokleiner-perkins-case/|title=Liveblog: Mary Meeker Testifies in Pao/Kleiner Perkins Case|first1=Liz|last1=Gannes|first2=Nellie|last2=Bowles|publisher=Recode|date=2015-03-16|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doerr testified that he praised Pao's writing skills from her date of hiring but only learned that she resented this work much later.&lt;ref name="doerr2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recode.net/2015/03/04/john-doerr-testifies-in-pao-vs-kleiner-perkins-day-two-liveblog/|title=John Doerr Testifies in Pao vs Kleiner Perkins: Day Two Liveblog|first1=Liz|last1=Gannes|first2=Nellie|last2=Bowles|publisher=Recode|date=2015-03-04|accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doerr also recalled that before convincing her to stay, Pao wanted to leave in 2007 due to frustration with Ajit Nazre. Another of Pao's attempts to leave was protested by Ted Schlein, her boss after Doerr. Although Schlein testified that he "reluctantly" hired Pao, he also said that he convinced her to stay at the firm when she was being considered for one of the original jobs in [[Google Ventures]]. Schlein's testimony covered reviews that were frequently critical of Pao, using "entitled", "passive" and "territorial" to describe her. He was criticized for a comment that venture capital skills were "not part of Ellen's genetic makeup."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recode.net/2015/02/27/a-performance-review-that-changed-dramatically-and-paos-400000-severance-package-pao-v-kleiner-perkins-trial/|title=Performance Review Rewrites and Pao's 'Genetic Makeup': Pao vs Kleiner Perkins Trial Day 4|first1=Liz|last1=Gannes|first2=Nellie|last2=Bowles|publisher=Recode|date=2015-02-27|accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doerr claimed that he frequently defended Pao and advocated for the reviews to be rewritten until eventually supporting her termination. He said "the junior partner is an up-or-out role. We have no lifetime junior partners." When Hermle presented a list of female partners to Doerr, he described playing a role in all of their careers. However, Exelrod argued that Doerr was responsible for some sexism as well by playing a video where he stated that "white male nerds" were a safe investment.&lt;ref name="doerr2" /&gt; Although Pao spoke positively of Doerr, she commented that he often raised issues of pregnancy and suggested that her three-month maternity leave was the real reason she did not receive a board seat at RPX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/03/reddit-ceo-ellen-pao-harassment-complaints-fell-on-deaf-ears-at-kleiner-perkins/|title=Reddit CEO Ellen Pao: Harassment complaints fell on deaf ears at Kleiner Perkins|first=Megan|last=Geuss|publisher=ArsTechnica|date=2015-03-09|accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doerr stated that having junior partners sit on only one board was a guideline, not a rule.&lt;ref name="doerr1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recode.net/2015/03/03/kleiner-perkins-john-doerr-takes-the-stand-in-pao-case-liveblog/|title=Kleiner Perkins' John Doerr Takes the Stand in Pao Case: Liveblog|first1=Liz|last1=Gannes|first2=Nellie|last2=Bowles|publisher=Recode|date=2015-03-03|accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pao contended that Chien had "five or six" board seats as a junior&lt;ref name="recode13" /&gt; but the defense replied that he may have shortened "board observer seat" to "board seat" as a form of bragging and stated that Matt Murphy took five years to join a board.&lt;ref name=RC032415/&gt;

Testimony of the plaintiff occupied most of the second week. She described mentoring Wen Hsieh and recalled hearing about three administrative assistants who were harassed by Nazre. When questioned about this, Pao knew only that one of their first names was Tina, inviting theories that the women had settled with Kleiner Perkins and signed non-disclosure agreements.&lt;ref name="recode20"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recode.net/2015/03/20/ellen-pao-and-the-case-of-the-mysterious-missing-admins/|title=Ellen Pao and the Case of the Mysterious Missing Admins|first1=Liz|last1=Gannes|first2=Nellie|last2=Bowles|publisher=Recode|date=2015-03-20|accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[cross-examination]], Hermle found an inconsistency with Pao's deposition video on the question of whether she asked to see an Equal Opportunity Employment policy.&lt;ref name="recode-ep2" /&gt; She also sought to show evidence of plotting in 2011 and 2012 by bringing up emails in which Pao discussed her options with friend and Google engineer Lori Park. These revealed that Pao had applied for jobs at [[YouTube]] and [[Menlo Ventures]] and was considering starting her own firm.&lt;ref name="recode-ep3" /&gt; Some issues with how Pao responded to termination were also raised. Pao said that it made sense for her to break the news to the CEOs of the three companies in her immediate network but revealed that Ted Schlein chastised her for doing so.&lt;ref name=liveblog4 /&gt; On the stand, Pao objected to the way [[Employment Law Alliance]] investigator Stephen Hirschfeld responded to the discrimination complaints by Trae Vassallo and herself. She alleged that the reports used biased language, softened the airplane incident by changing the name of a pornographic show to ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'' and focused on eliminating KPCB's liability rather than addressing the concerns of employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/03/ellen-pao-answers-jury-questions-frankly-in-gender-discrimination-case/|title=Ellen Pao answers jury questions frankly in gender discrimination case|first=Megan|last=Geuss|publisher=ArsTechnica|date=2015-03-13|accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Hirschfeld was questioned by Lawless, he revealed that his reports did not include a matrix which Vassallo used to tabulate discrepancies between male and female partners.&lt;ref name=WP032415 /&gt; This criticism was repeated by Allison West of Employment Practices Specialists who testified that the firm's investigation of gender issues was insufficient. She also commented that it was circular for the defendant to rely heavily on performance reviews to discredit Pao's allegations against the people writing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recode.net/2015/03/16/expert-slams-kleiner-perkins-investigation-into-paos-allegations/|title=Expert Slams Kleiner Perkins' Investigation Into Pao's Allegations|first1=Liz|last1=Gannes|first2=Nellie|last2=Bowles|publisher=Recode|date=2015-03-16|accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Testifying in the final week was an investor witness from outside Kleiner Perkins named Andrew Jody Gessow, a passenger of the private flight that Pao described as offensive. He claimed that there was no discussion of pornography but Lawless pressed that his memory may have lapsed due to medication he was taking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/03/18/ellen-pao-randy-komisar-kleiner-perkins/24936023/|title=Ellen Pao trial testimony returns to that plane ride|first=Elizabeth|last=Weise|publisher=USA Today|date=2015-03-18|accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior partner Randy Komisar also testified that week about why he received the board seat at RPX despite his investment in it being a joint effort with Ellen Pao. He stated that Pao described her respect for John Doerr's decision in an email and interpreted that as meaning she agreed with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2015/03/17/kleiner-perkins-ellen-pao/|title=Kleiner Perkins partner gave Ellen Pao a book of sexual poetry because he 'felt guilty'|first=Patrick|last=Kulp|publisher=Mashable|date=2015-03-17|accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Komisar said that his friendship with Pao deteriorated over the word "hate" when she wrote in a later email that the board of RPX "hated him". He also testified that a book described as making Pao feel uneasy was a Valentine's day gift from him. Specifically it was the ''[[Book of Longing]]'' by [[Leonard Cohen]] with whom Pao claimed to be unfamiliar.&lt;ref name="recode11" /&gt; One of the last people to testify was senior partner Matt Murphy who described Pao as "pushy" and "aggressive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/03/18/kleiner-perkins-ellen-pao-murphy/|title=In sexism trial, Kleiner Perkins partner says Ellen Pao needed to go|first=Kia|last=Kokalitcheva|publisher=Fortune|date=2015-03-18|accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also recalled being embarrassed when Pao fell asleep at a board meeting. Although admitting that he began taking detailed notes about Pao four days after her suit was filed, he maintained that he had wanted to fire her for years and that only resistance from Doerr stood in the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recode.net/2015/03/18/how-kleiner-perkins-matt-murphy-fired-ellen-pao/|title=How Kleiner Perkins' Matt Murphy Fired Ellen Pao|first1=Liz|last1=Gannes|first2=Nellie|last2=Bowles|publisher=Recode|date=2015-03-18|accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing a negative performance review, Exelrod asked Murphy to explain why Pao was able to receive high praise from [[Mike McCue]]. Murphy's response was that McCue was known for saying overly positive things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recode.net/2015/03/19/kleiners-matt-murphy-on-why-pao-failed-as-a-vc/|title=Kleiner's Matt Murphy on why Ellen Pao failed as a VC|first1=Liz|last1=Gannes|first2=Nellie|last2=Bowles|publisher=Recode|date=2015-03-19|accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jury instructions===
The jury was reminded of the plaintiff's claims in which number 1 had to be proven before number 3 could be considered:&lt;ref name=RC032415/&gt;
#Kleiner Perkins discriminated against Ellen Pao because of her gender.
#Kleiner Perkins retaliated against her because of conversations in December 2011 and her memorandum in January 2012.
#Kleiner Perkins failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination against her.
#Kleiner Perkins retaliated by firing her after her conversations and memorandum.
There were no sexual harassment claims.&lt;ref name=RC032415/&gt; The standard of proof was [[preponderance of the evidence]],&lt;ref name=RC032415/&gt; met if a proposition is [[Probability|more likely]] to be true than not.

Despite the title of "junior partner," Ellen Pao was an [[At-will employment|at-will employee]] who could be fired without warning at any time for any reason or for no reason but not for the wrong reasons such as a [[At-will employment#Public policy exceptions|statutory exception]] where "actions or inactions were substantially motivated by gender discrimination and/or retaliation". "Substantial motivating reasons and factors are more than remote or trivial motivating reasons and factors."&lt;ref name=RC032415&gt;{{cite news|author1=Liz Gannes and Nellie Bowles|title=Live: Closing Arguments in Ellen Pao's Gender Discrimination Case Against Kleiner Perkins|url=http://recode.net/2015/03/24/live-closing-arguments-in-ellen-paos-gender-discrimination-case-against-kleiner-perkins/|accessdate=March 24, 2015|work=Re/code|date=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was explained that compensatory damages are an estimate of the plaintiff's past and future lost earnings. Other, more complicated and technical, compensatory damages were reserved for future determination in the event of a favorable verdict for plaintiff.&lt;ref name=RC032415/&gt;

If the jury felt the defendant's actions involved malice, fraud and oppression they could have considered punitive damages after the initial verdict was returned. There was a 7-page verdict form.&lt;ref name=RC032415/&gt;

===Closing arguments===
Alan Exelrod made the [[closing argument]] for plaintiff, saying that the defendant's leaders "ran Kleiner Perkins like a boys' club." Lynne Hermle made the closing statement for defendant, focusing on the issues of the numbers of women employed and the allegedly discriminatory events.&lt;ref name=RC032415/&gt; According to her, the plaintiff was fired because, while she is an excellent executive, she was not able to perform in venture capital at a senior level. Therese Lawless presented the rebuttal on behalf of the plaintiff, saying "women will be judged in one way and men in another. That's not how it works in this country."&lt;ref name=RC032515&gt;{{cite news|author1=Liz Gannes and Nellie Bowles|title=Live: Day Two of the Ellen Pao v.

===Submission and verdict===
The case was submitted to the jury about noon on March 25, 2015.&lt;ref name=RC032515/&gt; A unanimous verdict was not required, only support of 9 of the 12 jurors, 75%.&lt;ref name=WP032415&gt;{{cite news|author1=Andrea Peterson|title=The sex discrimination trial that rocked Silicon Valley is almost over.

The initial verdict was announced shortly after 2 p.m. on Friday, March 27. The jury found 10-2 in favor of Kleiner Perkins on the first 3 claims. The jury, which found 8 to 4 in favor of Kleiner Perkins on the fourth claim of retaliation by termination, was directed to continue to deliberate as the finding did not meet the required threshold of 75%. The jury deliberated for about two hours then returned a final verdict in favor of Kleiner Perkins on all claims as one juror changed his vote from yes to no on the 4th claim.&lt;ref name=Recodeverdict&gt;{{cite news|author1=Liz Gannes and Nellie Bowles|title=Live: Ellen Pao Loses on All Claims in Historic Gender Discrimination Lawsuit Against Kleiner Perkins|url=http://recode.net/2015/03/27/live-the-pao-v-kleiner-perkins-verdict/|accessdate=March 27, 2015|work=Re/code|date=March 27, 2015|quote=That's the full verdict.

On the same day, jurors Steve Sammut and Marshallette Ramsey revealed what their votes had been. Ramsey supported the plaintiff and said that she encouraged other women in Pao's situation to stand up for themselves. Her reason was that it "seemed that the men, with the same character flaws that Ellen was cited with, were able to propel and continue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/27/two-jurors-on-opposite-sides-share-their-pao-vs-kleiner-perspectives/|title=Two Jurors On Opposite Sides Share Their Pao Vs.

===Costs and appeal===
The defendant requested [[court costs|costs]] of $972,814, 90% of which was for expert witness fees. Kleiner Perkins stated that the fee would be waived if the plaintiff chose not to [[appeal]].&lt;ref name=Reuters42415&gt;{{cite news|author1=Dan Levine and Jim Christie|title=UPDATE 4-Kleiner Perkins seeks almost $1 mln in costs in Pao case|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/23/kleiner-lawsuit-idUSL1N0XK2K720150423|accessdate=April 24, 2015|work=Reuters|date=April 24, 2015|quote=Kleiner's offer to withdraw its costs request in exchange for an end to the case, is common when defendants prevail in employment lawsuits}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 18, 2015&lt;ref name=Recode6415a&gt;{{cite news|author1=Liz Gainnes|title=Why Did Ellen Pao File to Appeal?

On September 10, 2015, sources reported that Pao was dropping her appeal, citing an inability to afford further litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/09/10/439232954/ellen-pao-former-reddit-ceo-drops-appeal-in-gender-discrimination-lawsuit.|title=Ex-Reddit CEO Ellen Pao Drops Appeal In Gender-Bias Suit Against Kleiner Perkins|first=Eyder|last=Peralta|publisher=NPR|date=2015-09-10|accessdate=2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/3c6eb39c79634bc090636db988d879ed/woman-who-lost-silicon-valley-gender-bias-suit-drops-appeal|title=Woman who lost Silicon Valley bias suit is dropping appeal|publisher=Associated Press|first=Sudhin|last=Thanawala|date=2015-09-10|accessdate=2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Re/code]] post on the topic, Pao wrote about the importance of discussing gender bias publicly and stated that she was rejecting requests from KPCB to sign a non-disparagement agreement.

'''Perry Oliver Hooper Jr.''' (born October 5, 1954), is an [[insurance]] agent from his native [[Montgomery, Alabama]], who is a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] former member of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], having served in the District 73 seat from 1984 until 2003. After five terms, he was defeated in the [[primary election]] held on June 4, 2002.

==Background==

Hooper is the oldest of four sons of  late [[Perry O. Hooper Sr.]], the former [[Chief Justice]] of the [[Alabama Supreme Court]], and the former Marilyn Yost. He received his undergraduate degree from [[Auburn University at Montgomery]] and his [[Juris Doctor]] from the [[Thomas Goode Jones School of Law]], affiliated with [[Faulkner University]], also in Montgomery.&lt;ref name=campaigns/&gt;

Hooper is a vice president of the Palomar Insurance Corporation. He is married to the former Judy McKissick, the daughter of the late Mr. and Mrs. Jefferson Clement McKissick, formerly of Montgomery.  Judy Hooper is a teacher at the [[Trinity Presbyterian School]] in Montgomery, affiliated with the Trinity [[Presbyterian Church in America|Presbyterian Church]].&lt;ref name=campaigns/&gt; Hooper is [[United Methodist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/biography/5664/perry-hooper-jr#.U2CdkstOUfg|title=Perry Hooper Jr.'s Biography|publisher=[[Project Vote Smart]]|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple has three sons: (1) Perry Hooper III, [[D.O.]], who is married to Dr. Marsa True Beck, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Steven Taylor Beck of [[Richmond, VirginiaVirginia]],  named for her aunt, Marsa Susan Beck of [[Jacksonville, Florida]], (2) Davis Shaw Hooper of [[Auburn, Alabama]], and (3) Thomas Clement Hooper of Montgomery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/celebration/timesdispatch/celebrations-announcement.aspx?n=perry-oliver-hooper-iii&amp;aid=165900764|title=Wedding Announcement: Perry Oliver Hooper, III, and Marsa True Beck, July 21, 2013|publisher=''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]''|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political life==

In 1982, Hooper ran for the District 81 state House seat vacated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Larry Dixon (politician)|Larry Dixon]], who was elected to the [[Alabama State Senate]] and switched to Republican affiliation in 1984. He was narrowly defeated by another Democrat, Ham Wilson Jr., who received 7,996 votes (50.9 percent) to Hooper's 7,725 (49.1 percent). In a [[special election]] in District 73 in 1983, a result of [[redistricting]], he narrowly unseated Wilson, 4,518 (51.1 percent) to 4,328 (48.9 percent) to fill the remaining three years of the term. Hooper was unopposed for reelection in 1986 and won with 64.1 percent in 1990 over the Democrat Robert Finley. Hooper increased his margin in 1994 to 73.3 percent over another Democrat, Ray Vaughan. He won re-nomination in 1998 over fellow Republican Donald Blair Little (1954–2012), an attorney in Montgomery and a son of Republican former state Representative [[Tandy Little]]. Hooper had no Democratic opponent in 1998 for what turned out to be his last four-year term in the state House. Hooper lost in the 2002 primary to fellow Republican [[David Grimes (Alabama politician)|David Grimes]], 3,582 (52.3 percent) to 3,273 (47.8 percent). Grimes was then unopposed in the [[general election]] of 2002 but lost the Republican primary in 2008.&lt;ref name=campaigns/&gt;Hooper's defeat by Grimes is attributed in part to a $12,000 fine in 2001 from the Alabama Ethics Commission.&lt;ref name=ddaily&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/news/060716/loyalty.shtml|title=Candidates in GOP runoff for PSC 2 question loyalty|publisher=''Decatur Daily'', [[Decatur, Alabama]], July 16, 2006|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooper was a delegate to the [[Republican National Convention|Republican national conventions]] of [[1984 Republican National Convention|1984 (Dallas)]], [[1992 Republican National Convention|1992 (Houston)]], and [[1996 Republican National Convention|1996 (San Diego)]]. He served on the Platform Committee in 1992, with the re-nomination of the [[George Herbert Walker Bush|Bush]]-[[Dan Quayle|Quayle]] ticket, and the Rules Committee in 1996, when the party turned to [[Bob Dole]].&lt;ref name=campaigns&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=61173|title=Hooper, Perry O. Jr.|publisher=ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hooper failed in a political comeback in 2006 though he won the Republican nomination with 58 percent of the vote for the Place 2 seat on the [[Alabama Public Service Commission]] vacated by Democrat-turned Republican [[George Wallace Jr.]] Hooper defeated a former state senator, Democrat-turned-Republican [[John Amari]], a lawyer from the [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] [[suburb]] of [[Trussville, Alabama|Trussville]], to win the Republican nomination for the Public Service Commission. Hooper was thereafter defeated in the general election by the Democratic former state auditor, [[Susan Parker]], 633,584 (53.5 percent), to 550,435 (46.4 percent).&lt;ref name=campaigns/&gt; Amari served twenty years in both houses of the legislature and was elected in 2008 as a judge of the Alabama 10th Judicial Circuit Court. In the 2006 campaign, Hooper called Amari a "[[Republican in Name Only|RINO]], a Republican in name only." Amari replied that Hooper "might have been born in a Republican family, but [by] his conduct ... he has 'left his raising' as they say."&lt;ref name=ddaily/&gt; 

In 1987 at the age of thirty-three, Hooper was named "Outstanding Young Man of Alabama" by the [[Junior Chamber International]]. He received the Thomas Jefferson Free Enterprise Award from the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC), a group of [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] lawmakers and businesses.{{cn|date=January 2015}} A coach of youth athletics, Hooper is a former "Man of the Year" by the [[YMCA]] of Montgomery. He is affiliated with [[Kiwanis International]], the Southern Development Council, and the [[Montgomery County, Alabama|Montgomery County]] Republican Committee.&lt;ref name=campaigns/&gt;

{{NSA surveillance|2}}
The '''Protect America Act of 2007''' ('''PAA'''), ({{USStatute|110|55|121|552}}, enacted by {{USBill|110|S|1927|}}), is a controversial amendment to the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA) that was signed into law by [[United States president|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] on August 5, 2007.  It removed the [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] requirement for government surveillance of foreign intelligence targets "reasonably believed" to be outside the United States.&lt;ref name="Judiciary Testimony"&gt;[http://www.odni.gov/testimonies/20070918_testimony.pdf Statement for the Record to the House Judiciary Committee by Director John Michael McConnell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021039/http://www.odni.gov/testimonies/20070918_testimony.pdf |date=September 27, 2007 }} September 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[FISA Amendments Act of 2008]] reauthorized many provisions of the Protect America Act in Title VII of FISA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/07/print/20080710-2.html White House signing ceremony for FISA Amendments Act of 2008].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|NSA warrantless surveillance controversy}}
In December 2005, the ''[[New York Times]]'' published an article&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/bush-lets-us-spy-on-callers-without-courts.html?_r=0 "Bush Lets US Spy on Callers Without Courts"] ''New York Times'' (Dec. 16, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; that described a [[NSA electronic surveillance program|surveillance program]] of warrantless domestic wiretapping ordered by the Bush administration and carried out by the [[National Security Agency]] in cooperation with major telecommunications companies since 2002 (a subsequent [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=abIV0cO64zJE&amp;refer= |publisher=Bloomberg |title=Spy Agency Sought U.S. Call Records Before 9/11, Lawyers Say |date=June 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that this may have already begun by June 2000). Many critics have asserted that the Administration's warrant-free surveillance program is a violation of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] against warrantless search, and, a criminal violation of FISA.

The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] maintained that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]],&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Justice White Paper on NSA Legal Authorities [http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/nsa/dojnsa11906wp.pdf "Legal Authorities Supporting the Activities of the National Security Agency Described by the President"] January 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the President's inherent authority under [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] to conduct foreign surveillance trumped the FISA statute. However, the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' placed the legitimacy of this argument into question.&lt;ref name=GG&gt;[http://crooksandliars.com/2006/07/09/supreme-courts-ruling-in-hamdan-means-warrantless-eavesdropping-is-clearly-illegal Supreme Court's Ruling in Hamdan Means Warrantless Eavesdropping is Clearly Illegal], [[Glenn Greenwald]], July 9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://balkin.blogspot.com/2006/07/hamdan-and-nsa-domestic-surveillance.html Hamdan and the NSA Domestic Surveillance Program: What Next?], Marty Lederman, July 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 28, 2007, President Bush announced that his Administration had submitted a bill to Congress to amend FISA. He suggested that the current law was "badly out of date" – despite [[Section summary of the USA PATRIOT Act, Title II|amendments]] passed in October 2001 – and did not apply to disposable cell phones and Internet-based communications. The bill he submitted to Congress would address these new technologies, Bush said, as well as restore FISA's "original focus" on protecting the privacy of people within the United States, "so we don't have to obtain court orders to effectively collect foreign intelligence about foreign targets located in foreign locations." He asked that Congress pass the legislation before its August 2007 recess, stating that "Every day that Congress puts off these reforms increases the danger to our nation. Our intelligence community warns that under the current statute, we are missing a significant amount of foreign intelligence that we should be collecting to protect our country".&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/07/print/20070728.html President's Radio Address – July 28, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, 2007, the Senate passed the bill ([https://web.archive.org/web/20071222101804/http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-s1927/show S. 1927]) in a vote of 60 to 28([https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00309 110th Congress 1st Session Vote 309]). The House followed by passing the bill, 227–183 ([http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2007/roll836.xml House Roll Call 836]) on August 3, 2007.

The bill altered the original 1978 law in many ways, including:&lt;ref name="govtracktext"&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s110-1927 GovTrack U.S. – S. 1927 Text of Legislation]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warrant and notification requirements===
The bill amended FISA to substitute the requirement of a warrant to conduct surveillance with a system of NSA (National Security Agency) internal controls.&lt;ref name="govtracktext" /&gt;

The bill required notification to the FISA Court of warrantless surveillance within 72 hours of any authorization. The bill also required that "a sealed copy of the certification" be sent which would "remain sealed unless the certification is needed to determine the legality of the acquisition."&lt;ref name="govtracktext" /&gt;

===Domestic wiretapping===
The bill allowed the [[Telephone tapping|monitoring of all electronic communications]] of "Americans communicating with foreigners who are the targets of a U.S. terrorism investigation" without a court's order or oversight, so long as it is not targeted at one particular person "reasonably believed to be" inside the country.&lt;ref name="Judiciary Testimony"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakashima"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nakashima|first=Ellen |author2=Warrick, Joby |title=House Approves Wiretap Measure |work=Washington Post |date=August 5, 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/04/AR2007080400285.html?nav=rss_politics |accessdate=August 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ACLU fact sheet"&gt;{{cite web |title=ACLU Fact Sheet on the "Police America Act" |publisher=[[ACLU]] |date=August 8, 2007 |url=https://www.aclu.org/safefree/nsaspying/31203res20070807.html |accessdate=April 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign wiretapping===
The Act removed the requirement for a [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|FISA]] warrant for any communication which was foreign-related, even if the communication involved a U.S. location on the receiving or sending end of communication; all foreign-foreign communications were removed from warrant requirements, as well.&lt;ref name="Nakashima" /&gt;

Experts claimed that this deceptively opened the door to domestic spying, given that many domestic U.S. communications passed via non-US locations, by virtue of old telephony network configurations.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

===Data monitoring===
In the bill, the monitoring of data related to Americans communicating with persons (U.S citizens and non-citizens) outside the United States who are the targets of a U.S. government ''intelligence information gathering'' efforts was addressed. The Protect America Act differed from the FISA in that no discussion of actions or character judgment of the target was required for application of the statute (i.e., to receive a [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|FISA]] surveillance warrant, a [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|FISC]] foreign agent definition was required). This data could be monitored only if intelligence officials acted in the context of intelligence information gathering.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

===Foreign agent declaration not required===
No mention of [[foreign agent]] status is made in the Protect America Act of 2007. Under prior [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|FISA]] rules, persons targeted for surveillance must have been declared as foreign agents before a FISA warrant would be accorded by the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|FISC]] court.

==='Quasi-anti-terrorism law' for all-forms of intelligence collection===
Vastly marketed by U.S. federal and military agencies as a law to prevent terror attacks, the Protect America Act was actually a law focused on the 'acquisition' of desired intelligence information, of unspecified nature.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The sole requirement is geolocation outside the United States at time of Directive invocation; pursuant to Authorization or Order invocation, surveillance Directives can be undertaken towards persons targeted for intelligence information gathering. Implementation of Directives can take place inside the United States or outside the United States.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

No criminal or terrorism investigation of the person need be in play at time of the Directive. All that need be required is that the target be related to an official desire for intelligence information gathering for actions on part of persons involved in surveillance to be granted full immunity from U.S. criminal or civil procedures, under Section 105B(l) of the Act.&lt;ref name="Nakashima" /&gt;

===Authorization power===
Under the bill, the director of national intelligence and the attorney general could authorize the surveillance of all communications involving persons outside the United States (U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens). The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, normally the venue for intelligence-related warrants, was limited in power by the Protect America Act to an accept or reject power for government guidelines related to persons (U.S. and non-U.S. citizens) targeted for ''intelligence information gathering''.&lt;ref name="govtracktext" /&gt;

====1. Purpose of Directive====
:''The most significant of five points, comprising guidelines for Authorizing Certain Acquisitions Concerning Persons Outside the United States was that:''

:* ''A significant '''''purpose of the acquisition is to obtain foreign intelligence information''.'''''

====2. Minimization procedures====
:One of the five points referred to minimization procedures (how information was collected)

:* ''the minimization procedures to be used with respect to such acquisition activity meet the definition of minimization procedures under section 101(h).''

====3. Requirement to assist====
:Any person or company could be enjoined and requested, on a compulsory basis, to assist with the intelligence information gathering.

:* ''The acquisition involves obtaining the foreign intelligence information from or with the assistance of a communications service provider, custodian, or other person (including any officer, employee, agent, or other specified person of such service provider, custodian, or other person) who has access to communications, either as they are transmitted or while they are stored, or equipment that is being or may be used to transmit or store such communications;''

====4. Removal of FISA Strictures from warrant authorization; warrants not required====
:But the most striking aspect of the Protect America Act was the notation that any information gathering did not comprise electronic surveillance.  This wording had the effect of removing [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|FISA]]-related strictures from Protect America Act 2007-related Directives, serving to remove a number of protections for persons targeted, and requirements for persons working for U.S. intelligence agencies.

:* ''The acquisition does not constitute electronic surveillance''

::The removal of the term electronic surveillance from any Protect America Act Directive implied that the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|FISC]] court approval was no longer required, as [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|FISA]] warrants were no longer required.  In the place of a warrant was a certification, made by U.S. intelligence officers, which was copied to the Court. In effect, the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|FISC]] became less of a court than a registry of pre-approved certifications.

::Certifications (in place of FISA warrants) were able to be levied ''ex post facto'', in writing to the Court no more than 72 hours after it was made. The Attorney General was to transmit as soon as possible to the Court a sealed copy of the certification that would remain sealed unless the certification was needed to determine the legality of the acquisition.&lt;ref name="govtracktext" /&gt;

====5. Geolocation procedures====
:Assuring that the person targeted for intelligence information gathering was outside U.S. there are reasonable procedures in place for determining that the acquisition of foreign intelligence information under this section concerns persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States, and such procedures will be subject to review of the Court pursuant to section 105C of this Act;

===Reporting requirements===
The [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] would report to Congress semi-annually with:
* ''Reporting incidents of corporation non-cooperation''. A description of any incidents of non-compliance with a directive issued.&lt;ref name="govtracktext" /&gt;
* ''Reporting incidents of non-cooperative persons''. Incidents of noncompliance by a specified person to whom the Attorney General and [[Director of National Intelligence]] issued a directive.&lt;ref name="govtracktext" /&gt;
* ''The number of certifications and directives''. Issued in the preceding six months.&lt;ref name="govtracktext" /&gt;
* ''Reporting procedural failures''. Incidents of non-compliance with the guidelines or procedures established for determining that the acquisition concerns persons outside the United States by any entity of the Intelligence Community.&lt;ref name="govtracktext" /&gt;

==Legislative history==
Senator [[Mitch McConnell]] introduced the act on August 1, 2007, during the [[110th United States Congress]]. On August 3, it was passed in the Senate with an amendment, 60–28 (record vote number 309).&lt;ref name="govtrack"&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-1927 GovTrack U.S. – S. 1927]&lt;/ref&gt; On August 4, it passed the House of Representatives 227–183 (roll number 836).&lt;ref name="govtrack"/&gt; On August 5, it was signed by President Bush, becoming Public Law No. 110-055. On February 17, 2008, it expired due to the sunset provision.

==Sunset==
The Act provided for six months of time for new Directives to be issued;

::*'''Sunset''' – Except as provided in subsection (d), sections 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this Act, and the amendments made by this Act, shall cease to have effect 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.

==FISA Amendments of 2008==
Whereas it is generally understood that the FISA Amendments of 2008 repealed the Protect America Act, this is not the case for existing directives and authorizations.

:(1) IN GENERAL – Except as provided in section 404, effective December 31, 2012, title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as amended by section 101(a), is repealed.

===Continuance of Protect America Act 2007 Rules for Existing Orders===
'''Section 404 (Transition Procedures)''' allows for continuance of Protect America Act Sections 105A, 105B and 105C for all existing orders.  So for authorizations for intelligence information and directives issued under such authorizations, Protect America Act application continues to apply.
:'''Section 404(a)2(A)''' subject to paragraph (3), section 105A of such Act, as added by section 2 of the Protect America Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-55; 121 Stat. 552), shall continue to apply to any acquisition conducted pursuant to an order, authorization, or directive referred to in paragraph (1); and''
:'''Section 404(a)2(B)''' sections 105B and 105C of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as added by sections 2 and 3, respectively, of the Protect America Act of 2007, shall continue to apply with respect to an order, authorization, or directive referred to in paragraph (1) until the later of--

==Controversy==
The Protect America Act generated a great deal of controversy.  Constitutional lawyers and civil liberties experts expressed concerns that the Act authorized massive, wide-ranging information gathering with no oversight.  Whereas much focus was placed on communications, the Act allowed for information gathering of all shapes and forms.  The ACLU called it the "Police America Act" – "authorized a massive surveillance dragnet", calling the blank-check oversight provisions "meaningless," calling them a "phony court review of secret procedures."&lt;ref name="ACLU fact sheet"/&gt;

==FISC ruling, January 2009==
In January 2009, a [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review]] ruling was made in favor of the warrantless wiretapping role of the Protect America Act 2007, in a heavily redacted opinion released on January 15, 2009, which was only the second such public ruling since the enactment of the FISA Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/16/washington/16fisa.html?_r=1&amp;hp |title=Court Affirms Wiretapping Without Warrants|work=New York Times, January 15, 2009|accessdate=January 16, 2009 |first1=James |last1=Risen |first2=Eric |last2=Lichtblau |date=January 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123206893587088395?mod=googlenews_wsj |title=Court Backs U.S. Wiretapping |work=Wall Street Journal, January 16, 2009|accessdate=January 16, 2009 |first=Evan |last=Perez |date=January 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/15/AR2009011502311.html?hpid=topnews |title=Intelligence Court Releases Ruling in Favor of Warrantless Wiretapping|work=Washington Post, January 15, 2009|accessdate=January 16, 2009 |date=January 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g9Q7M6scz4PEW8SuEo_bpOer6ZAQD95NRD1G0 |title=Court ruling endorses Bush surveillance policy|work=Associated Press, January 15, 2009|accessdate=January 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/newsroom/2009/FISCR_Opinion.pdf?WT.cg_n=FISCROpinion_WhatsNew_homepage |title=No. 08-01 IN RE: DIRECTIVE (Redacted) * PURSUANT TO SECTION 105B OF THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT (redacted tect) ON PETITION FOR REVIEW OF A DECISION OF THE UNITED STATES FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE  COURT |accessdate=January 16, 2009 |publisher=United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review |date=August 22, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117194044/http://www.uscourts.gov/newsroom/2009/FISCR_Opinion.pdf?WT.cg_n=FISCROpinion_WhatsNew_homepage |archivedate=January 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2437">'''Public health law''' examines the authority of the government at various jurisdictional levels to improve the [[health]] of the general population within societal limits and norms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/910309614|title=Public health law : power, duty, restraint|last=Ogalthorpe),|first=Gostin, Lawrence O. (Lawrence|others=Wiley, Lindsay F., 1977-|isbn=9780520958586|edition=Third|location=Oakland, California|oclc=910309614}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public health law focuses on the duties of the government to achieve these goals, limits on that power, and the [[population perspective]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Public health law also focuses on legal issues in public health practice and on the public health effects of legal practice.

== Police power ==
Police power can be defined as the inherent power of a government to exercise reasonable control over persons and property within its jurisdiction in the interest of the general security, health, safety, morals, and welfare except where legally prohibited. These areas perpetuate are employed by governmental agencies. Bioterrorism is a growing focus of this practice area in some jurisdictions; for example, public health lawyers in the United States have worked in the creation of the [[Model State Emergency Health Powers Act]] and the [[Model State Public Health Act]].

== Disease and injury prevention ==
This broader area of public health law applies legal tools to public health problems associated with [[disease]] and [[injury]]. Practitioners apply [[legislation]], [[regulation]], [[litigation]] (private enforcement), and [[international law]] to public health problems using the law as an instrument of public health. Litigation against tobacco companies in the United States provides an excellent example.

'''''R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union''''' [2017] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/5.html UKSC 5] is a [[legal case]] decided by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom Supreme Court]] on 24 January 2017, which ruled that the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]] (the executive) may not initiate withdrawal from the European Union by formal notification to the [[Council of the European Union]] as prescribed by [[Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union]] without an [[Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|Act of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|the UK Parliament]] permitting the government to do so. Two days later, the government responded by bringing to Parliament the [[European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill 2017]] for first reading in the House of Commons on 26 January 2017. The case is informally referred to as "the ''Miller'' case"&lt;ref&gt;S. Renton, [https://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2017/01/19/simon-renton-historical-perspectives-and-the-miller-case/ "Historical Perspectives and the ''Miller'' Case"]&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Miller's case''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citywire.co.uk/money/millers-case-dubbed-back-door-attempt-to-block-brexit/a958053 "Miller's case dubbed 'back door' attempt to block Brexit"]. Citywire, 14 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Supreme Court's decision was given on appeal from the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]]'s ruling&lt;ref&gt;High Court judgment.[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2016/2768.html EWHC 2768]&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom#Foreign affairs|Crown's foreign affairs prerogative]], which is exercised by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|government]] led by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], may not be used to nullify rights that Parliament has enacted through primary legislation. The case was seen as having constitutional significance in deciding the scope of the [[royal prerogative]] in foreign affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-19/court-takes-brexit-challenge-very-seriously-judge-leveson-says |title=Brexit Article 50 Challenge to Quickly Move to Supreme Court |publisher=Bloomberg |date=19 July 2016 |accessdate= 18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court also ruled that devolved legislatures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have no legal right to veto the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-38723340|title=Brexit: Ministers 'not legally compelled' to consult AMs|date=24 January 2017|publisher=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The government's appeal was against the High Court order dated 7 November 2016 that formally declared: "The Secretary of State does not have power under the Crown's prerogative to give notice pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union for the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union." The [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] heard the appeal from 5 December 2016 to 8 December 2016, and, by a majority of 8–3, upheld the High Court ruling, finding that authorisation by Parliament was required for the invocation of Article 50.&lt;ref name="BBCSC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38720320|title=Brexit: Supreme Court says Parliament must give Article 50 go-ahead|publisher=BBC News|date=24 January 2017|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was [[Intervention (law)|intervened]] by the [[Lord Advocate]] and the [[Counsel General for Wales]] for the [[Scottish Government|Scottish]] and [[Welsh Government|Welsh]] governments (respectively as ''the Scottish'' and ''Welsh Ministers''), and applicants for judicial review in [[Northern Ireland]] also had their three separate applications considered together with this case, all of whom argued that the [[Scottish Parliament]], the [[National Assembly for Wales]] and the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] all had to consent to the invocation of Article 50. In each case this was unanimously rejected by the court.&lt;ref name="BBCSC" /&gt;

==Facts==
Following a [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|referendum held on 23 June 2016]], in which 51.9% of votes cast were in favour of leaving the EU, the UK government stated its intention to invoke [[Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union]] (the formal procedure for withdrawing) on 29 March 2017. A week after the referendum, a columnist for ''[[The Times]]'', [[David Pannick, Baron Pannick|David Pannick QC]], asked whether parliamentary approval was needed before notification could lawfully be given of the UK's intention to leave, and answered that an Act of Parliament is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Pannick, QC |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/c8985886-3df9-11e6-a28b-4ed6c4bdada3 |title=Why giving notice of withdrawal from the EU requires act of parliament |publisher=The Times |date=30 June 2016 |accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government argued that the use of prerogative powers to enact the referendum result was constitutionally proper and consistent with domestic law whereas the opposing view was that prerogative powers could not be used to set aside rights previously established by Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=f43e102f-ea09-4449-b781-a35ecfe628fe |title=Judicial review litigation over the correct constitutional process for triggering Article 50 TEU |publisher=Lexology |date=13 October 2016 |accessdate= 18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gina Miller]] and other claimants had sought permission to bring an action in the High Court for [[judicial review]] on whether the UK government was entitled to notify an intention to leave the European Union under Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union (TEU), as amended (the [[Treaty of Maastricht|Maastricht]] and [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon]] Treaties), without a vote or deliberative debate in Parliament. 

[[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], the [[Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union]], argued that the possibility to trigger article 50 was based on the royal prerogative and so any consultation of elected members of parliament was unnecessary.&lt;ref name="SCReuters" /&gt; Miller contended that, if notification under Article 50 were to be invoked to leave the European Union, it would effectively nullify a series of Acts of Parliament.&lt;ref name="SCReuters" /&gt; It was a constitutional principle that Acts of Parliament could not be changed without the consent of Parliament.&lt;ref name="SCJudgement"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2016-0196-judgment.pdf|title=R (on the application of Miller and another) (Respondents) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union (Appellant)|publisher=UK Supreme Court|date=24 January 2017|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Secretary of State did not contend that the Referendum Act 2015 supplied a statutory power for the Crown to give notice under Article 50.&lt;ref&gt;''R. (Miller and Dos Santos) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union''.[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2016/2768.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The Court observed that he was right not to do so, because any argument to that effect would have been untenable as a matter of statutory interpretation of the 2015 Act&lt;ref name="High Court Judgment"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union |court=High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division, Divisional Court |date=3 November 2016 |url=https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/judgments/r-miller-v-secretary-of-state-for-exiting-the-european-union/ |accessdate=7 November 2016 |id=Neutral Citation Number: [2016] EWHC 2768 (Admin), Case No. CO/3809/2016 and CO/3281/2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated: {{Quote|... a referendum on any topic can only be advisory for the lawmakers in Parliament unless very clear language to the contrary is in the referendum legislation in question.

== High Court judgment ==

=== Background ===
There was dispute over whether the decision to invoke Article 50 was the prerogative of the government, as the [[second Cameron ministry|Cameron government]] argued,&lt;ref name=letwin&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jul/05/brexit-live-tory-leadership-tom-watson-unions-jeremy-corbyn?page=with:block-577ba75be4b0b14d7ed7dc0b#block-577ba75be4b0b14d7ed7dc0b|title=Letwin says government can invoke article 50 without a vote in parliament|date=5 July 2016|accessdate=5 July 2016|author=Claire Phipps and Andrew Sparrow|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; or whether it required Parliamentary approval.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|title=Leaving the EU: Parliament's Role in the Process|url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/LLN-2016-0034|publisher=House of Lords Library|accessdate=1 July 2016|date=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2016/06/27/nick-barber-tom-hickman-and-jeff-king-pulling-the-article-50-trigger-parliaments-indispensable-role/|title=Nick Barber, Tom Hickman and Jeff King: Pulling the Article 50 ‘Trigger’: Parliament’s Indispensable Role|date=27 June 2016|accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 50 states that "Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements".

As Professor Kenneth Armstrong (Professor of EU law at Cambridge University) points out&lt;ref&gt;https://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2017/06/14/kenneth-armstrong-has-article-50-really-been-triggered/&lt;/ref&gt; this is a decision solely for domestic law: whether constitutional requirements have been met is a matter solely for the domestic law of member states. The UK's constitutional requirements for the valid invocation of Article 50 was the entire basis of this litigation, even though this was undertaken without explicit reference to that phrase as in Art 50(1) in the judgments. As will be seen below, it was held that the UK constitutional requirements were that an Act of Parliament needs be passed in order to bestow the power on the Secretary of State to invoke Article 50, as the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]] had displaced the Royal prerogative to take the UK outside of the EU treaties.

The first of the parties to lodge a complaint in the proceedings against the government's intention to [[UK invocation of Article 50|trigger Article 50]] without a parliamentary vote was Deir Dos Santos, who launched his action four days after the referendum of 23 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/hairdresser-behind-brexit-challenge-now-in-hiding-after-vile-hate-mail-a3387411.html|title=Hairdresser behind Brexit challenge now in hiding after vile hate mail|date=4 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller's claim form was served on 29 July 2016.&lt;ref name="mishcon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mishcon.com/qanda|title=Q&amp;A: Article 50 Legal Challenge|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law firm [[Mishcon de Reya]] announced that it had been retained by a group of clients to challenge the constitutionality of invoking Article 50 without Parliament debating it.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mance|first1=Henry|title=Businesses prepare legal challenge over Brexit negotiations|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/83db8e6a-4124-11e6-b22f-79eb4891c97d.html|work=Financial Times|date=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite web|title=Article 50 process on Brexit faces legal challenge to ensure parliamentary involvement|url=http://www.mishcon.com/news/firm_news/article_50_process_on_brexit_faces_legal_challenge_to_ensure_parliamentary_involvement_07_2016|publisher=Mishcon de Reya|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However a spokesman for the law firm would not name any other businesses or individuals who were said to be backing her claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3901568/Top-City-law-firm-led-High-Court-bid-stop-PM-triggering-Brexit-won-t-reveal-fat-cats-working-for.html|title=Top City law firm behind Brexit bid l won't reveal its fat cat backers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the proceedings, all parties accepted that withdrawal from the [[European Union]] will have profound consequences in terms of changing domestic law in each of the jurisdictions of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[2016] EWHC 2768 (Admin). para.4

Questions were also raised over the impartiality of [[Lord Neuberger]] by Brexit MPs and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', as his wife had made a series of tweets criticising Brexit.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-supreme-court-article-50-hearing-judge-lord-neuberger-wife-tweet-impartiality-a7427511.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3951682/Supreme-Court-s-senior-judge-urged-stand-crucial-Brexit-case-wife-s-pro-Remain-tweets.html&lt;/ref&gt; These allegations were countered by his spokesman, who said that Neuberger's wife's personal views had no effect on Neuberger's ability to interpret the law.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/740078/Lord-Neuberger-who-is-Supreme-Court-President-profile-judge-Brexit-case-Article-50-appeal&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hearing ===
At the full hearing in October, before three judges sitting as a [[Divisional court (England and Wales)|divisional court]] ([[John Thomas, Baron Thomas of Cwmgiedd|the Lord Chief Justice]], [[Terence Etherton|the Master of the Rolls]] and [[Philip Sales|Lord Justice Sales]]), it was argued for the lead claimant (Miller) that notification under Article 50 would commit the UK to the removal of rights existing under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]] and later ratification acts, and that it is not open to the government, without Parliament's approval, to use the [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|prerogative power]] to take action affecting rights which Parliament had recognised in that way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/20161013-all-day.pdf Transcript, 13 October 2016, p.109-115]&lt;/ref&gt; An argument put for the "[[Expatriate|expat]]" Interveners at the hearing was that by the 1972 Act, Parliament had conferred a legislative competence on the EU institutions, and in that way had changed the constitutional settlement in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brexit181016-all-day.pdf -: Transcript, 18 October 2016, p.31]&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding in the opening submissions for the government, the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney-General]] ([[Jeremy Wright]]) outlined how the decision had been reached. In support of the contention that when passing the 2015 Act Parliament well knew of the Article 50 procedure for leaving the European Union if that was voted for in the referendum, he said that Parliament had previously dealt with it when the Lisbon Treaty was included in [[Municipal law|domestic law]] by the 2008 Act, and he took the court through the legislation dealing with the European Union and its predecessor, namely:
*European Communities Act 1972 (before the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] came into force in 1980)
*[[European Assembly Elections Act 1978]]
*[[European Communities (Greek Accession) Act 1979]]

In further submissions for the government, the lead claimant's primary argument was said by [[Devilling#Treasury Devil|Treasury Counsel]] ([[James Eadie (barrister)|James Eadie]]) to be that it is not open to the executive to use the [[Royal prerogative|prerogative power]] in such a way as to affect or change current economic law, principally statute law;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/20161017-all-day.pdf -: Transcript, 17 October 2016, p.108]&lt;/ref&gt; but the government contended that [[Lists of landmark court decisions|the leading]] case ''[[A-G v De Keyser's Royal Hotel Ltd|Attorney General v De Keyser's Royal Hotel]]'' meant that the question about the use of the royal prerogative depended on Parliament's legislative intention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/20161017-all-day.pdf -: Transcript, 17 October 2016, p. 123]&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty ratification provisions of the [[Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010]] were in force from 11 November 2010,&lt;ref&gt;The Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 (Commencement No. 3) Order 2010.[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/2703/article/2/made#article-2-a]&lt;/ref&gt; that is, after the [[Ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]], including Article 50, was ratified for UK on 16 July 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7511281.stm|title=UK – UK Politics – UK ratifies the EU Lisbon Treaty}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had come into force on 1 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6901353.stm|title=Q&amp;A: The Lisbon Treaty}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Act describes "treaty" as an agreement between states, or between states and [[List of intergovernmental organizations#Regional organizations|international organisations]], which is binding under international law, including amendments to a treaty, and defines "ratification" as including acts (such as notification that domestic procedures have been completed) which establish as a matter of international law the United Kingdom's consent to be bound by the treaty, ratification of an amendment to a European Union treaty may involve compliance with the [[European Union (Amendment) Act 2008]], and there are further provisions under the European Union Act 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/25/notes/division/6/20|title=Explanatory Notes to Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010|first1=Ministry of|last1=Justice|first2=Cabinet|last2=Office|first3=Foreign and Commonwealth|last3=Office|first4=HM|last4=Treasury}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord Chief Justice described the statutory procedure as "of critical importance".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brexit181016-all-day.pdf -: Transcript, 18 October 2016, p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, the applications of other parties challenging the government in legal proceedings in Northern Ireland's High Court were dismissed on 28 October, but the court was prepared to grant leave to appeal in respect of four out of the five issues.&lt;ref&gt;R (on the application of Agnew and others) v Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union.[http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial%20Decisions/PublishedByYear/Documents/2016/&amp;#91;2016&amp;#93;%20NIQB%2085/j_j_MAG10076Final.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judgment ===
The court's unanimous judgment was delivered and published on 3 November. The decision was against the government's contention that the Crown's prerogative allowed giving Article 50 notice, and the court would later decide on the form of declaration it would make. The court described the passing of the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]] as the major step of "switching on the direct effect of [[European Union law|EU law]] in the national legal systems", and reasoned that it is implausible that Parliament's intention was that the Crown should be able to switch it off unilaterally by exercise of its prerogative powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/judgments/r-miller-v-secretary-of-state-for-exiting-the-european-union/|title=R (Miller) -v- Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The judgment stated that the question for the court's decision involved the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitutional law of the United Kingdom]]: it was whether the Crown's executive government is entitled to use the Crown's prerogative powers to give notice under Article 50 for the United Kingdom to cease to be a member of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;[2016] EWHC 2768 (Admin). [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2016/2768.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The court held that the Government had no power to trigger notification under article 50 of the [[Treaty on European Union]] (TEU), because it would remove a series of rights created by Acts of Parliament. The principle of [[parliamentary sovereignty]] required that only Parliament could take away those rights. This is expressed in the ''[[Case of Proclamations]]'' (1608), the [[Bill of Rights 1688]] section 1, and continually confirmed since in cases including ''[[Burmah Oil Co Ltd v Lord Advocate]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1965] AC 75&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[R (Jackson) v Attorney General]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[2005] UKHL 56, [9]&lt;/ref&gt; The Crown may not alter the domestic law of the UK or modify rights conferred by Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[2016] [https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/judgment-r-miller-v-secretary-of-state-for-exiting-the-eu-20161103.pdf EWHC 2768], [86]-[88]&lt;/ref&gt;

Three categories of rights were
:(i) rights that could be replicated by UK law (e.g. 28 days paid holidays under the [[Working Time Directive 2003]]), 
:(ii) rights of UK citizens in other EU member states (e.g. the right to work abroad, or set up a business, under [[TFEU]] articles 45 and 49) and 
:(iii) rights that could not be replicated in UK law (e.g. the right to vote in the [[EU Parliament]] or petition the [[EU Commission]] to enforce [[competition law]] or [[environmental law]] standards in the UK).&lt;ref&gt;[2016] [https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/judgment-r-miller-v-secretary-of-state-for-exiting-the-eu-20161103.pdf EWHC 2768], [58]-[61]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Secretary of State accepted that category (iii) rights would be nullified, the High Court also ruled that all rights in categories (i) and (ii) would also be jeopardised in their effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;[2016] [https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/judgment-r-miller-v-secretary-of-state-for-exiting-the-eu-20161103.pdf EWHC 2768], [63]-[66]&lt;/ref&gt;

The case had come before the court as a "rolled up" hearing,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/410079/Chapter_27_section_3_judicial_review_process.pdf ''Judicial Review Guidance,Section 3: Judicial Review Process'']&lt;/ref&gt; so that both the application for permission to seek judicial review and the substantive merits of the claim were considered at the hearing. Formally, this meant that permission for full judicial review on the substantive merits was granted.&lt;ref&gt;[2016] [https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/judgment-r-miller-v-secretary-of-state-for-exiting-the-eu-20161103.pdf EWHC 2768], [110]&lt;/ref&gt;

The High Court order dated 7 November 2016 declared: "The Secretary of State does not have power under the Crown's prerogative to give notice pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union for the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union."&lt;ref&gt;In the Supreme Court, Written Case for Birnie and others (the "Expat Interveners") para. 2.[http://www.croftsolicitors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/139459-UKSC-2016-0196-Skeleton-for-Expat-Interveners-final-written-case-2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appeal to Supreme Court ==
The case, involving the government's appeal from the High Court of England and Wales and two references from Northern Ireland, was the first ever to be heard ''[[en banc]]'' by the full court (eleven [[Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|justices]], there being one vacancy).&lt;ref name="SCReuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-article50-factbox-idUSKBN13P1SA|title=Factbox: Brexit case in Britain's Supreme Court – how will it work?|author=Michael Holden|date=30 November 2016|accessdate=24 January 2017|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Court]] scheduled the four days between 5 and 8 December 2016 for the hearing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/06/theresa-may-issues-a-staunch-defence-of-the-free-press-after-med/ Theresa May issues a staunch defence of the free press after media coverage of Brexit ruling] {{snd}} [[The Daily Telegraph]], 6 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37913911 Brexit court ruling appeal date set for 5 December] {{snd}} [[BBC]], 8 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Judgment was delivered on 24 January 2017.

=== In advance of appeal hearing ===
For the Scottish government, Scotland's First Minister, [[Nicola Sturgeon]], told the [[Lord Advocate]] to apply to join the case. Sturgeon maintained it "simply cannot be right" for EU rights to be "removed by the UK Government on the say-so of a Prime Minister without parliamentary debate, scrutiny or consent". She argued further that "legislation should be required at Westminster and the consent of the [[Scottish Parliament]] should be sought before Article 50 is triggered".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-nicola-sturgeon-scotland-theresa-may-legal-challenge-supreme-court-appeal-case-a7404591.html Nicola Sturgeon launches plan to stop Theresa May overturning Brexit legal challenge] {{snd}} ''[[The Independent]]'', 10 November 2016'&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 November the Supreme Court announced that the [[Attorney General for Northern Ireland]] had made a reference to the court regarding devolution issues relating to that jurisdiction and that the court had granted the applications of four interveners to take part in the appeal, namely:

The BBC reported that the Lord Advocate would be addressing the court on Scots law, and the Welsh Counsel General's submissions would be addressing the court on the rule of law and parliamentary sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-38027230|title=Scots and Welsh can have say in Brexit court case|date=18 November 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking on 9 November, [[Brenda Hale, Baroness Hale of Richmond|Lady Hale]], [[Deputy President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|deputy president of the Supreme Court]], stated that the issue in the case to be heard on appeal by the Court in December was whether giving Article 50 notification was within the [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|Crown's prerogative powers]] for the conduct of foreign relations or whether the prerogative cannot be used in a way that undermines an act of the United Kingdom Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;''The Supreme Court: Guardian of the Constitution?'' Lecture, Kuala Lumpur 9 November 2016.[https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/speech-161109.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the appeal the government argued that, while Parliament's enactment of the European Communities Act 1972 was necessary to prevent the UK breaching the EEC treaties when they came into force on 1 January 1973, the 1972 act was a legal precondition neither for the signature nor for the ratification of the Treaty of Accession, nor for the treaty coming into force in respect of the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/570778/Supreme_Court_Printed_Case_of_the_Secretary_of_State_for_Exiting_the_European_Union.PDF Appellant's Case, para. 19]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intervening for the Scottish government, the Lord Advocate stated as background that the UK "acceded to the constitutional order of the Communities" when joining on 1 January 1973&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0051/00510602.pdf Written Case of Lord Advocate, para. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that "[t]he purported giving of notification under Article 50 TEU by unilateral act of [the UK government] would be unlawful" because it would (''inter alia'')
* be contrary to provisions of the Acts of Union of 1706 and 1708; and
* circumvent the requirements of established constitutional convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0051/00510602.pdf Written Case of Lord Advocate, paras. 87 and 89]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the hearing, the Supreme Court invited the public to view video footage of the entire proceedings, and provided on its website a page headed "Article 50 'Brexit' Appeal" with multiple links, giving a brief explanation of the issues to be considered and other information, and stating that in addition to live video feeds and 'on demand' catch-up video of each court session, transcripts would be available at the website on a half-daily basis (morning session by 4&amp;nbsp;pm, afternoon session around 7&amp;nbsp;pm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/live/court-01.html|title=Court 1 -Supreme Court Live|first=The Supreme|last=Court|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/news/article-50-brexit-appeal.html|title=Article 50 Brexit Appeal - The Supreme Court|first=The Supreme|last=Court|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Access to the Supreme Court building: Article 50 'Brexit' case, 5–8 December 2016.[https://www.supremecourt.uk/news/access-to-supreme-court-building-article-50-brexit-case.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The hearing===

Before calling on the Attorney General to open the case for the government as Appellant, the Supreme Court President stated the justices were aware of the strong feelings associated with the many wider political questions surrounding the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union, but the appeal was concerned with the legal issues, and their duty was to consider those issues impartially and decide according to the law. He mentioned that all the parties involved in the proceedings had been asked whether they wished any of the justices to stand down, and each of them had stated that they had no objection to any of the eleven sitting on the appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-monday-161205.pdf SC Transcript, 5 December 2016, p. 3-4]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the government's oral submissions, the Attorney-General said the claimants had brought High Court proceedings perfectly properly and it was now perfectly proper for the Supreme Court to decide the appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-monday-161205-am.pdf SC Transcript, 5 December 2016, p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt; The Appellant's submissions, apart from devolution issues to be addressed later by the Advocate General for Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-tuesday-161206.pdf SC Transcript, 6 December 2016, from p.74]&lt;/ref&gt; were summed up on the morning of the second day in a series of points:
*As Parliament knows today and knew in 1972, the Crown prerogative to make and unmake or withdraw from treaties exists as a key part of the UK constitution.
*Parliament has deliberately regulated some parts of those prerogative powers, expressly and in detail, but it has not touched the power to give Article 50 notice.
*There is no basis for imposing a hidden legislative presumption on Parliament's intention: the rights in question in this case are created on the international plane, and then recognised by UK law; EU rights on that plane are altered and removed through the Crown's prerogative powers, and that is a "significant step along the road to finding the intention in relation to withdrawal".
*The courts should be wary of going over the line between interpretation of legislation and judicial legislation, in a way which would impose "a new control of a most serious kind in a highly controversial and, by Parliament, carefully considered area".
*The 2015 Act and the referendum emphatically undermine a suggestion that giving Article 50 notice by use of the prerogative power could be other than consistent with the will of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-tuesday-161206.pdf SC Transcript, 6 December 2016, p.72-74 (Eadie)]&lt;/ref&gt;
Following on, the Advocate General for Scotland ended his oral submissions for the Appellant by saying that if an exercise of the royal prerogative to take the UK out of the EU were seen as an abuse of power after the 1972 Act, there could be no such abuse after the Referendum Act 2015 and the result of the referendum was known: "It is simply a question of whether it would be proper and appropriate for the executive to exercise the prerogative in particular circumstances, and the circumstances that we have to address are those which exist today in light of the 2015 Act, which is of considerable constitutional importance and the decision made in the referendum, knowing that if Parliament wanted to intervene and limit the exercise of that prerogative right, it is free to do so and has chosen to remain silent."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-tuesday-161206.pdf SC Transcript, 6 December 2016, p.116]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Respondent Miller it was argued that the Court should not accept that the legal limits on ministers' powers are to be left to or influenced by political control, or parliamentary control, short of an act of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-wednesday-161207.pdf SC Transcript, 7 December 2016, p.51(Pannick)]&lt;/ref&gt; For the Respondent Dos Santos it was submitted that the legislature could easily have said what effect the 2015 referendum was if it wanted to tell us, but it has not told us, and the courts should not try and guess what the legislature intended, but instead leave it to the legislature to decide; and that, as there is no parliamentary authorisation for the loss of rights resulting from withdrawal from the EU, whether under the 2015 Act, or any other legislation which has been passed by Parliament, the government's appeal should be dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-wednesday-161207.pdf SC Transcript, 7 December 2016, p.110-111 (Chambers)]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Welsh Government submitted that the UK Government's proposed Article 50 notification would be an unlawful dispensation by the Crown of the provisions establishing the competence of the Welsh Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gov.wales/docs/dfm/minutes/cabinet/161125counselgeneralforwalesprintedcaseen.pdf Case of Counsel General for Wales, para. 20]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to submissions of parties opposing the appeal and questions put by the Justices, it was said for the government that the question before the court was about "the present state of the division of responsibility between our pillars of state, legislative, executive, and indeed judicial, and that demands a current answer and not a historic one"; and that parliament's legislation was to implement UK treaty obligations, not to control the government's exercise of the royal prerogative on the international plane.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-thursday-161208-four-page.pdf SC Transcript, 8 December 2016, p.172-176 (Eadie)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Closing the hearing, the Court President said that the appeal raised important constitutional issues, and the Justices would take time to give full consideration to the many arguments presented to them, orally and in writing, and they would do their best to resolve the case as quickly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-thursday-161208-four-page.pdf SC Transcript, 8 December 2016, p.204]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judgment===
The Supreme Court held by eight judges to three that only Parliament could authorise a notification under [[Treaty on European Union|TEU]] Article 50 to be given to the [[European Commission]], upholding the High Court.&lt;ref&gt;See in the media, {{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/21/four-versions-brexit-law-prepared-ministers-braced-court-defeat/|title=Four versions of Brexit law prepared as Government braced for Supreme Court defeat in Article 50 case|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all judges found unanimously that neither the [[Sewel Convention]], nor the [[Northern Ireland Act 1998]] and the [[Good Friday Agreement]], legally required the consent of the [[Scottish Parliament]], the [[National Assembly for Wales]] or the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] to trigger article 50.&lt;ref&gt;This rejected the arguments of the [[Lord Advocate]] (also known in the [[Courts of Scotland|Scottish courts]] as ''Her Majesty's Advocate'' or ''HM Advocate'', for the [[Scottish Government]], as ''the Scottish Ministers''), the [[Counsel General for Wales]] (for the [[Welsh Government]], as ''the Welsh Ministers'') and the Northern Ireland applicants for judicial review (in Northern Ireland) (Agnew and others (Stephen Agnew, Colum Eastwood, David Ford, John O'Dowd, Dessie Donnelly, Dawn Purvis, Monica Wilson, The Committee on the Administration of Justice, The Human Rights Consortium), and Raymond McCord.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority judgment said the following.

{{Cquote|[[File:Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury 2013.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Lord Neuberger, President of the Supreme Court, delivered the majority judgment for Lady Hale, Lord Mance, Lord Kerr, Lord Clarke, Lord Wilson, Lord Sumption and Lord Hodge.

51. ... ministers cannot frustrate the purpose of a statute or a statutory provision, for example by emptying it of content or preventing its effectual operation. Thus, ministers could not exercise prerogative powers at the international level to revoke the designation of Laker Airways under an aviation treaty as that would have rendered a licence granted under a statute useless: &lt;I&gt;Laker Airways Ltd v Department of Trade &lt;/I&gt; [1977] QB 643 - see especially at pp 718-719 and 728 per Roskill LJ and Lawton LJ respectively. And in &lt;I&gt;Fire Brigades Union&lt;/I&gt; cited above, at pp 551-552, Lord Browne-Wilkinson concluded that ministers could not exercise the prerogative power to set up a scheme of compensation for criminal injuries in such a way as to make a statutory scheme redundant, even though the statute in question was not yet in force. And, as already mentioned in para 35 above, he also stated that it was inappropriate for ministers to base their actions (or to invite the court to make any decision) on the basis of an anticipated repeal of a statutory provision as that would involve ministers (or the court) pre-empting Parliament’s decision whether to enact that repeal.

86. .. the EU Treaties not only concern the international relations of the United Kingdom, they are a source of domestic law, and they are a source of domestic legal rights many of which are inextricably linked with domestic law from other sources. Accordingly, the Royal prerogative to make and unmake treaties, which operates wholly on the international plane, cannot be exercised in relation to the EU Treaties, at least in the absence of domestic sanction in appropriate statutory form. It follows that, rather than the Secretary of State being able to rely on the absence in the 1972 Act of any exclusion of the prerogative power to withdraw from the EU Treaties, the proper analysis is that, unless that Act positively created such a power in relation to those Treaties, it does not exist. And, once one rejects the contention that section 2 accommodates a ministerial power to withdraw from the EU Treaties (as to which see paras 79 and 84 above), it is plain that the 1972 Act did not create such a power of withdrawal, as the Secretary of State properly accepts.

87. We accept, of course, that it would have been open to Parliament to provide expressly that the constitutional arrangements and the EU rights introduced by the 1972 Act should themselves only prevail from time to time and for so long as the UK government did not decide otherwise, and in particular did not decide to withdraw from the EU Treaties. But we cannot accept that the 1972 Act did so provide. As Lord Hoffmann explained in ''[[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Simms]]'' [2000] 2 AC 115, 131, “the principle of legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost”, and so “[f]undamental rights cannot be overridden by general … words” in a statute, “because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process”. Had the Bill which became the 1972 Act spelled out that ministers would be free to withdraw the United Kingdom from the EU Treaties, the implications of what Parliament was being asked to endorse would have been clear, and the courts would have so decided. But we must take the legislation as it is, and we cannot accept that, in Part I of the 1972 Act, Parliament “squarely confront[ed]” the notion that it was clothing ministers with the far-reaching and anomalous right to use a treaty-making power to remove an important source of domestic law and important domestic rights.

[...]

89. For these reasons, we disagree with Lloyd LJ’s conclusion in Rees-Mogg in so far as he held that ministers could exercise prerogative powers to withdraw from the EU Treaties....

90. The EU Treaties as implemented pursuant to the 1972 Act were and are unique in their legislative and constitutional implications. In 1972, for the first time in the history of the United Kingdom, a dynamic, international source of law was grafted onto, and above, the well-established existing sources of domestic law: Parliament and the courts. And, as explained in paras 13–15 above, before (i) signing and (ii) ratifying the 1972 Accession Treaty, ministers, acting internationally, waited for Parliament, acting domestically, (i) to give clear, if not legally binding, approval in the form of resolutions, and (ii) to enable the Treaty to be effective by passing the 1972 Act. Bearing in mind this unique history and the constitutional principle of Parliamentary sovereignty, it seems most improbable that those two parties had the intention or expectation that ministers, constitutionally the junior partner in that exercise, could subsequently remove the graft without formal appropriate sanction from the constitutionally senior partner in that exercise, Parliament.

[...]

121. Where, as in this case, implementation of a referendum result requires a change in the law of the land, and statute has not provided for that change, the change in the law must be made in the only way in which the UK constitution permits, namely through Parliamentary legislation.

122. What form such legislation should take is entirely a matter for Parliament. But, in the light of a point made in oral argument, it is right to add that the fact that Parliament may decide to content itself with a very brief statute is nothing to the point. There is no equivalence between the constitutional importance of a statute, or any other document, and its length or complexity. A notice under article 50(2) could no doubt be very short indeed, but that would not undermine its momentous significance. The essential point is that, if, as we consider, what would otherwise be a prerogative act would result in a change in domestic law, the act can only lawfully be carried out with the sanction of primary legislation enacted by the Queen in Parliament.}}

===Government bill===
After the government's appeal was dismissed, the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU formally introduced in Parliament, on 26 January 2017, a bill that, on 16 March, was enacted without amendment as the [[European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017]]. The act's [[long title]] is ''To Confer power on the Prime Minister to notify, under Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union, the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the EU''.  The act's two sections are to confer on the Prime Minister the power of giving the notice that the Treaty requires to be given when a member state decides to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;Explanatory Notes, Prepared 25 January 2017.[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2016-2017/0132/en/17132en02.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Routing Assets Database (RADb)''', also expanded as '''Routing Arbiter Database''', run by [[Merit Network]], is a lookup database designed to make fundamental information about networks available. The RADb is a public registry of routing information for networks in the Internet. It was developed in the early 1990s as part of the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF)-funded [[Routing Arbiter]] Project.  The acronym is frequently seen written in all caps ([[RADB]]) but its official usage is the following mixed case (RADb).{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Some Internet service providers require customers to be registered in some RADb prior to making BGP announcements.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Among other things, the registry validates the origin of each announcement.

'''''Sambucus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[flowering plant]]s in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Adoxaceae]]. The various species are commonly called '''elder''' or '''elderberry'''. The genus was formerly placed in the [[honeysuckle]] family, [[Caprifoliaceae]], but was reclassified as Adoxaceae due to genetic and morphological comparisons to plants in the genus ''[[Adoxa]]''.

== Description ==
The oppositely arranged [[leaf|leaves]] are [[pinnate]] with 5–9 leaflets (rarely 3 or 11). Each leaf is {{convert|5|–|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, and the leaflets have serrated margins. They bear large clusters of small white or cream-colored [[flower]]s in late spring; these are followed by clusters of small black, blue-black, or red berries (rarely yellow or white).

== Distribution and habitat ==
The genus occurs in [[temperateness|temperate]] to subtropical regions of the world. More widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, its Southern Hemisphere occurrence is restricted to parts of [[Australasia]] and [[South America]]. Many species are widely cultivated for their ornamental leaves, flowers and fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=RHS A-Z encyclopedia of garden plants|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4053-3296-5|location=United Kingdom|page=1136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elderberry fruit or flowers are used as [[dietary supplement]]s for minor diseases such as [[flu]], colds, [[constipation]], and other conditions, often served as a tea, [[extract]], or in a capsule.&lt;ref name="nih"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://nccih.nih.gov/health/euroelder | title=European elder | publisher=National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, National Institutes of Health | date=September 2016 | accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is insufficient research to know its effectiveness for such uses, or its safety profile - however, no illnesses caused by elderflower have been reported.&lt;ref name=nih/&gt;

=== Nutrition ===
Raw elderberries are 80% water, 18% [[carbohydrates]], and less than 1% each of [[protein]] and [[fat]] (table). In a 100 gram amount, elderberries supply 73 [[calories]] and are a rich source of [[vitamin C]], providing 43% of the [[Daily Value]] (DV). Elderberries also have moderate contents of [[vitamin B6]] (18% DV) and [[iron]] (12% DV), with no other nutrients in significant content (table).

=== Food ===
The French, Austrians and Central Europeans produce elderflower syrup, commonly made from an extract of elderflower blossoms, which in central Europe is added to [[Palatschinken]] filling instead of blueberries. People throughout much of Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe use a similar method to make a syrup which is diluted with water and used as a drink or as a flavoring in several food products. Fruit pies and relishes are produced with berries. Romanians produce a traditional soft drink in May and June called "[[socată]]" or "suc de soc". It is produced by letting the flowers macerate with water, yeast and lemon for 2–3 days. The last stage of fermentation is done in a closed pressure proof bottle to produce a fizzy drink. The beverage has also inspired Coca-Cola to launch an elderflower-based drink, Fanta Shokata.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Fanta Shokata |publisher= Coca-Cola HBC Austria GmbH |year= 2015 |url= http://en.coca-colahellenic.at/Productsandbrands/Sparklingproducts/Fanta-Shokata/ |access-date= 6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flowers of ''[[Sambucus nigra]]'' are used to produce [[elderflower cordial]]. [[St-Germain (liqueur)|St-Germain]], a French liqueur, is made from elderflowers. Hallands Fläder, a Swedish [[akvavit]], is flavoured with elderflowers. Despite the similarity in name, the Italian liqueur [[sambuca]] is mostly made with star anise and fennel essential oils extracted by vapor distillation. It also contains elderflower extracts with which it is flavored to add a floral note, to smooth and round off the strong licorice flavor.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Hollowed elderberry twigs have traditionally been used as [[spile]]s to tap [[maple]] trees for [[Maple syrup|syrup]].&lt;ref&gt;Medve, Richard J. ''et al.'' ''Edible Wild Plants of Pennsylvania and Neighboring States'' [[Penn State Press]], 1990, {{ISBN|978-0-271-00690-1}}, p.161&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traditional medicine ===

Although practitioners of [[traditional medicine]] have used black elderberry for hundreds of years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/e/elder-04.html A Modern Herbal | Elder]. Botanical.com (1923-01-06).

== Ecology ==

In Northern California, elderberries are a food for migrating [[band-tailed pigeon]]s. Elders are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]] species including [[brown-tail]], [[buff ermine]], [[dot moth]], [[Pavonia pavonia|emperor moth]], [[Engrailed (moth)|engrailed moth]], [[swallow-tailed moth]] and the [[V-pug]]. The crushed foliage and immature fruit have a strong fetid smell. [[Valley elderberry longhorn beetle]]s in California are very often found around red or blue elderberry bushes. Females lay their eggs on the bark.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The [[pith]] of elder has been used by [[watchmaking|watchmakers]] for cleaning tools before intricate work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldandsold.com/articles22/watch-repair-2.shtml Materials used in construction and repair of watches]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Habitat ===
Elder commonly grows near farms and homesteads. It is a [[nitrogen]]-dependent plant and thus is generally found near places of [[organic waste]] disposal. Elders are often grown as a [[hedgerow]] plant in Britain since they take very fast, can be bent into shape easily and grow quite profusely, thus having gained the reputation of being 'an instant hedge'. It is not generally affected by soil type or pH level and will virtually grow anywhere sufficient [[sunlight]] is available.

== Folklore and fiction ==
[[Folklore]] related to elder trees is extensive and can vary according to region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diacono|first1=Mark|title=In praise of the elderflower|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/plants/10117751/In-praise-of-the-elderflower.html|accessdate=10 September 2017|publisher=The Telegraph|date=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some myths, the elder tree is thought to ward off evil and give protection from [[witch]]es, while other beliefs say that witches often congregate under the plant, especially when it is full of fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jen Munson|title=Consider warding off witches, monsters with these spooktacular herbs this Halloween|url=http://www.news-herald.com/article/HR/20161025/FEATURES/161029659|accessdate=10 September 2017|publisher=The News-Herald, Digital First Media, Denver, CO|date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an elder tree was cut down, a spirit known as the [[Elder Mother]] would be released and take her revenge. The tree could only safely be cut while chanting a rhyme to the Elder Mother.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Michael. ''Traditional Folk Remedies'' (Century, 1987); pp. 134–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Made from the branch of an elder tree, the [[Elder Wand]] plays a pivotal role in the final book of the ''Harry Potter'' series, which was nearly named ''Harry Potter and the Elder Wand'' before author [[J. K. Rowling]] decided on ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Groves|first1=Beatrice|title=Literary Allusion in Harry Potter|date=2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781351978736|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8P8nDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50|accessdate=3 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Jen|title=Confused by Potter?

==Regulation==
===United States===
[[File:Hyperion plant.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Hyperion sewage treatment plant|Hyperion Wastewater Treatment Plant]] in Los Angeles, California is one of the largest municipal plants in the United States.]]
[[Sewage treatment]] systems in the United States are subject to the [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) and are regulated by federal and [[U.S. state|state]] environmental agencies. In most states, local sewage plants receive discharge permits from state agencies; in the remaining states and [[Insular area#Inhabited 2|territories]], permits are issued by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-state-program-information#tab-2 |title=NPDES State Program Information |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-02-06 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment plants, known as [[publicly owned treatment works]] (POTW) in CWA parlance, must protect the health and welfare of the local population by ensuring that wastewater does not contaminate the local potable water supply, nor violate additional [[Clean Water Act#Water Quality Standards Program|water quality standards]] that protect the ecological health of the water body. 

The basic national standard for U.S. municipal treatment plants is the '''Secondary Treatment Regulation'''.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (1989). "Secondary Treatment Regulation." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{uscfr|40|133}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most plants in the U.S. must meet this [[secondary treatment]] standard. The permit authority (state agency or EPA) can compel a POTW to meet a higher standard, if there are applicable water quality standards for the receiving water body. For water bodies with stringent standards, such as [[Lake Tahoe]], POTWs must treat their discharges to [[Sewage treatment#Tertiary treatment|tertiary treatment]] levels, and then pump all treated water out of the drainage basin so that no effluent ever drains to a certain body of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-limits |title=NPDES Permit Limits |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-11-29 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such higher standards may require the POTW to construct improvements to its plant(s). If not in compliance with its permit and regulations, POTWs may be subject to heavy fines. Regulation is therefore often the driving force behind increasing sewage treatment costs in the United States, and is directly linked to the high cost of constructing or expanding a sewage treatment facility.

Many large cities in the U.S. operate [[combined sewer]]s, which collect sewage and [[stormwater]] runoff in a single pipe system leading to the treatment plant. Combined sewers can cause serious water pollution problems due to combined sewer overflows, which are caused by large variations in flow between dry and wet weather. These overflows can lead to violation of the Secondary Treatment Regulation and/or water quality standards. Discharge permits for these POTWs typically have additional requirements that require facility improvements to reduce or eliminate the overflows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/combined-sewer-overflows-csos |title=Combined Sewer Overflows |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-12-16 |website=NPDES |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
In England and Wales, [[Ofwat]] regulates charges and service standards. In [[England]] environmental standards and their achievement for sewage disposal are regulated by the [[Environment Agency]]. In [[Wales]] environmental regulation is undertaken by [[Natural Resources Wales]]. In [[Scotland]] the [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]] fulfils the environmental regulation role and the [[Water Industry Commission for Scotland]] undertakes the economic regulatory role.

==Administration==
===United States===
Sewer systems are usually administered on the local level, usually citywide, and usually by the city itself. These systems, which may operate independently or as a subdivision of a city or other municipal agency, are typically operated as ''Enterprises'', meaning that they produce enough revenues to fund their own activities.

Revenues are usually generated through two charges to customers: ''connection fees'' and ''use charges''. Connection fees are charged once to new customers as they connect to the sanitary sewer collection system, and are usually designed to recover [[capital investments]] made by the enterprise to serve its customers. Use charges are periodic charges for ongoing use of the system, and are designed to recover [[operations and maintenance]] expenses. Both connection fees and use charges are typically proportionate to the amount and strength of wastewater expected to be generated by each customer. Therefore, a single family residence would pay much smaller fees and charges than a food processing plant.

Some POTWs are eligible for low-interest loans to finance system improvements, from the [[Clean Water State Revolving Fund]]. This program is administered by EPA and state agencies, using a combination of federal and state funds.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2012). [http://water.epa.gov/grants_funding/cwsrf/cwsrf_index.cfm "Clean Water State Revolving Fund."]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In [[England]] sewerage and sewage disposal is undertaken by relatively few large private companies, including several multi-national companies. In [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]] a "not for profit" company is the responsible body, however in Wales almost all the operational work is sub-[[subcontractor|contract]]ed by others. Charges to domestic users are based either on the metered volume of incoming water or on the notional value of the property ([[Rates (tax)|rateable]] basis).

==Gurdwara reform movement==
{{main|Gurdwara Reform Movement}}
Prior to 1925, a large proportion of the gurdwaras in India were under the control of clergy of the [[Udasi]] denomination of Sikhism. The Udasi differed from their mainline Sikh congregants, and due to differences in theology (such as [[syncretic]] Hindu practises) as well as some instances of malfeasance were seen as allowing or committing behaviours unsuitable for a gurdwara. By the 1920s, resentment of this perceived corruption led to the foundation of the [[Akali Movement]] which negotiated or forced Udasi [[mahant]]s (religious heads) out of control of key gurdwaras.&lt;ref name="google1925"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ai-rpcY-rrgC&amp;pg=PT108&amp;dq=%22Gurdwaras+Act+of+1925%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jR6RUfaHOc6G0QGDxoGoCA&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA |title=Sikhism: A Very Short Introduction - Eleanor Nesbitt - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2005-09-22 |accessdate=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the issues addressed by the legislation:
* Identification as a Sikh was defined by the attestation: ''One who professes the Sikh religion - I solemnly affirm that I am a Sikh, that I believe in the Guru Granth Sahib, that I believe in the Ten Gurus, and that I have no other religion''. This definition was to stand until 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aeKWQzesOc4C&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22Gurdwaras+Act+of+1925%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jR6RUfaHOc6G0QGDxoGoCA&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Gurdwaras%20Act%20of%201925%22&amp;f=false |title=Sikh Identity: An Exploration Of Groups Among Sikhs - Opinderjit Kaur Takhar - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Subsidiarity''' is a principle of social organization that holds that social and political issues should be dealt with at the most immediate (or local) level that is consistent with their resolution. 

Subsidiarity is perhaps presently best known as a [[general principle of European Union law]].

== Definition==
{{further |Subsidiarity (Catholicism)}}
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines subsidiarity as "the principle that a central authority should have a subsidiary function, performing only those tasks which cannot be performed at a more local level".&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary. https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/subsidiarity Definition: "[mass noun] (in politics) the principle that a central authority should have a subsidiary function, performing only those tasks which cannot be performed at a more local level:"&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is applicable in the fields of government, [[political science]], [[neuropsychology]], [[cybernetics]], management and in military command ([[mission command]]).  Subsidiarity is a general principle of [[European Union law]].  In the United States of America, the principle of [[States' Rights]] is enshrined in the constitution. Although the principle is older, its expression in the term "subsidiarity" was first coined in 1891 by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] for its social teaching.

The OED adds that the term "subsidiarity" in English follows the early German usage of ''"Subsidiarität"''. &lt;ref&gt; Early German usage: ''Subsidiarität''(1809 or earlier in legal use; 1931 in the context of Catholic social doctrine, in §80 of ''Rundschreiben über die gesellschaftliche Ordnung'' ("[[Encyclical]] concerning the societal order"), the German version of Pope Pius XI's encyclical [[Quadragesimo anno]] (1931))".&lt;/ref&gt; More distantly, it is derived from the [[Latin]] verb ''subsidio'' (to aid or help), and the related noun ''subsidium'' (aid or assistance). The concept as discussed here was first described formally in [[Catholic social teaching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Das Subsidiaritätsprinzip als wirtschaftliches Ordnungsprinzip | title = Wirtschaftliche Entwicklung und soziale Ordnung. Degenfeld-Festschrift | publisher = von Lagler and J. Messner | place = Vienna | year = 1952 | pages = 81–92}}, cited in {{Citation | url = http://www.helmut-zenz.de/hznellbr.html | title = Helmut Zenz | place = [[Germany|DE]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Coupled with another [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] principle, [[sphere sovereignty]], subsidiarity is said to have led to the creation of [[corporatist]] welfare states throughout the world.&lt;ref name="BakHolthoon1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bak|first1=Hans|last2=Holthoon |first2=F. L. van|last3=Krabbendam|first3=Hans |author4= Edward L. Ayers |title= Social and Secure?: Politics and Culture of the Welfare State: a Comparative Inquiry|date=1 January 1996|publisher=VU University Press|language=English |isbn=9789053834589|quote=The Christian democrats promoted a corporatist welfare state, based on the principles of the so-called "sphere sovereignty" and "subsidiarity" in social policy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political theory ==
[[Alexis de Tocqueville]]'s classic study, ''[[Democracy in America]]'', may be viewed as an examination of the operation of the principle of subsidiarity in early 19th century America. De Tocqueville noted that the French Revolution began with "a push towards decentralization ... in the end, an extension of centralization".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Vivien A | last = Schmidt | title = Democratizing France: The Political and Administrative History of Decentralization | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZsltI4XKXTUC&amp;pg=PA10 | page = 10}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote that "Decentralization has, not only an administrative value, but also a civic dimension, since it increases the opportunities for citizens to take interest in public affairs; it makes them get accustomed to using freedom. And from the accumulation of these local, active, persnickety freedoms, is born the most efficient counterweight against the claims of the central government, even if it were supported by an impersonal, collective will."&lt;ref name=EarthInstitute&gt;[http://www.ciesin.org/decentralization/English/General/history_fao.html A History of Decentralization], [[Earth Institute]] of [[Columbia University]], accessed 4 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Christian Democracy sidebar}}
As [[Christian Democratic]] political parties were formed, they adopted the [[Subsidiarity (Catholicism)|Catholic social teaching of subsidiarity]], as well as the [[neo-Calvinist]] theological teaching of [[sphere sovereignty]], with both Protestants and Roman Catholics agreeing "that the principles of sphere sovereignty and subsidiarity boiled down to the same thing".&lt;ref name="Segell2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Segell|first=Glen|title=Is There a Third Way?|year=2000|publisher=Glen Segell Publishers|language=English |isbn=9781901414189|page=80|quote=When the Dutch Protestant and Catholic parties combined, to form the Christian Democrats, the two parties agreed that the principles of sphere sovereignty and subsidiarity boiled down to the same thing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "subsidiarity" is also used to refer to a tenet of some forms of conservative or [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] thought in the United States. For example, conservative author [[Reid Buckley]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Will the American people never learn that, as a principle, to expect swift response and efficiency from government is fatuous? Will we never heed the principle of subsidiarity (in which our fathers were bred), namely that no public agency should do what a private agency can do better, and that no higher-level public agency should attempt to do what a lower-level agency can do better – that to the degree the principle of subsidiarity is violated, first local government, the state government, and then federal government wax in inefficiency? Moreover, the more powers that are invested in government, and the more powers that are wielded by government, the  less well does government discharge its primary responsibilities, which are (1) defence of the [[commonwealth]], (2) protection of the rights of citizens, and (3) support of just order.&lt;ref&gt;Reid Buckley, ''An American Family – The Buckleys'', [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2008, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s 1999 report on decentralisation noted that subsidiarity was an important principle. It quoted one definition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Decentralization, or decentralising governance, refers to the restructuring or reorganisation of authority so that there is a system of co-responsibility between institutions of governance at the central, regional and local levels according to the principle of subsidiarity, thus increasing the overall quality and effectiveness of the system of governance, while increasing the authority and capacities of sub-national levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.undp.org/evaluation/documents/decentralization_working_report.PDF Decentralization: A Sampling of Definitions], Joint UNDP ([[United Nations Development Programme]])-Government of Germany evaluation of the UNDP role in decentralization and local governance, at the [[United Nations Development Programme]] website, October 1999, pp. 2, 16, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Richard Macrory]], the positive effects of a political/economic system governed by the principle of subsidiarity include:&lt;ref name=Macrory&gt;Macrory, Richard, 2008, Regulation, Enforcement and Governance in Environmental Law, Cameron May, London, p. 657.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Systemic failures of the type seen in the crash of 2007/08 can largely be avoided, since diverse solutions to common problems avoid [[common mode failure]].
* Individual and group initiative is given maximum scope to solve problems.
* The systemic problem of [[moral hazard]] is largely avoided. In particular, the vexing problem of atrophied local initiative/responsibility is avoided.

He writes that the negative effects of a political/economic system governed by the principle of subsidiarity include:

* When a genuine principle of liberty is recognised by a higher political entity but not all subsidiary entities, implementation of that principle can be delayed at the more local level.
* When a genuinely efficacious economic principle is recognised by a higher political entity, but not all subsidiary entities, implementation of that principle can be delayed at the more local level.
* In areas where the local use of common resources has a broad regional, or even global, impact (such as in the generation of pollutants), higher levels of authority may have a natural mandate to supersede local authority.&lt;ref name=Macrory/&gt;

== General principle of European Union law ==
{{Politics of the European Union}}
{{wikisource|Consolidated protocols, annexes and declarations attached to the treaties of the European Union#PROTOCOL (No 2) ON THE APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY|Protocol on the Application of Principles of Subsidiarity and Proportionality}}
Subsidiarity is perhaps presently best known as a [[general principle of European Union law]]. According to this principle, the EU may only act (i.e. make laws) where action of individual countries is insufficient. The principle was established in the 1992 [[Treaty of Maastricht]].&lt;ref name="Shelton 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Shelton|first1=Dinah|title=The Boundaries of Human Rights Jurisdiction in Europe|access-date=17 April 2017| pages=95–154|volume=13|issue=1|date=2003 |publisher=Duke University School of Law|journal= Duke Journal of Comparative and International Law|url= http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/djcil/vol13/iss1/2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the local level it was already a key element of the [[European Charter of Local Self-Government]], an instrument of the [[Council of Europe]] promulgated in 1985 (see Article 4, Paragraph 3 of the [[European Charter of Local Self-Government|Charter]]) (which states that the exercise of public responsibilities should be decentralised).  Subsidiarity is related in essence to, but should not be confused with, the concept of a [[margin of appreciation]].

Subsidiarity was established in EU law by the [[Treaty of Maastricht]], which was signed on 7 February 1992 and entered into force on 1 November 1993. The present formulation is contained in Article 5(3) of the [[Treaty on European Union]] (consolidated version following the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], which entered into force on 1 December 2009):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Under the principle of subsidiarity, in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, either at central level or at regional and local level, but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A more descriptive analysis of the principle can be found in Protocol 2 to the [[Treaties of the European Union|European Treaties]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2004:310:0207:0209:EN:PDF Protocol 2 to the European Treaties].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court of Justice===
The [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] in Luxembourg is the authority that has to decide whether a regulation falls within the exclusive competence{{efn|Exclusive competencies are those matters that the member states have agreed with each other by treaty are those that they should achieve jointly (typically through the European Commission). All other matters remain as "national competences" (each member decides its own policy independently). International trade agreements are an example of the former, taxation is an example of the latter.}} of the Union, as defined by the [[Treaty of European Union]] and its predecessors. As the concept of subsidiarity has a political as well as a legal dimension,  the Court of Justice has a reserved attitude toward judging whether EU legislation is consistent with the concept. The Court will examine only marginally whether the principle is fulfilled. A detailed explanation of the legislation is not required; it is enough that the EU institutions explain why national legislation seems inadequate and that Union law has an added value.

An example is the judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Union in a legal action taken by the Federal Republic of Germany against the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union concerning a Directive on [[Deposit insurance|deposit guarantee schemes]] (13 May 1997). Germany argued that the Directive did not explain how it was compatible with the principle of subsidiarity. The Court answered:

{{quote|In the present case, the Parliament and the Council stated in the second recital in the preamble to the Directive that "consideration should be given to the situation which might arise if deposits in a credit institution that has branches in other Member States became unavailable" and that it was "indispensable to ensure a harmonised minimum level of deposit protection wherever deposits are located in the Community". This shows that, in the Community legislature's view, the aim of its action could, because of the dimensions of the intended action, be best achieved at Community level. …

Furthermore, in the fifth recital the Parliament and the Council stated that the action taken by the Member States in response to the Commission's Recommendation has not fully achieved the desired result. The Community legislature therefore found that the objective of its action could not be achieved sufficiently by the Member States.

Consequently, it is apparent that, on any view, the Parliament and the Council did explain why they considered that their action was in conformity with the principle of subsidiarity and, accordingly, that they complied with the obligation to give reasons as required under Article 190 of the Treaty. An express reference to that principle cannot be required.

On those grounds, the plea of infringement of the obligation to state reasons is unfounded in fact and must therefore be rejected. (Case C-233/94&lt;ref&gt;[http://curia.europa.eu/juris/showPdf.jsf?text=&amp;docid=99910&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=doc&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=190822 Judgment Of The Court in Case C-233/94]&lt;/ref&gt;)}}

In cooperation with [[:de:Marseille-Kliniken|Marseille-Kliniken]] Hamburg, [[The Trump Organization]] agreed in August 2000 to found TD Trump Deutschland AG with a [[Capital (economics)|common capital stock]] of {{€|4 million}}, split equally as 2 million for each partner company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article450778/Der-Turmbau-zu-Schwaben.html|title=Der Turmbau zu Schwaben: - WELT|website=DIE WELT|access-date=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://global.handelsblatt.com/politics/no-heimat-for-trump-486722|title=Donald Trump’s German Flop|date=2016-04-05|newspaper=Handelsblatt Global Edition|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw.com/en/donald-trumps-castles-in-the-german-sky/a-36472081&lt;/ref&gt;

TD Trump Deutschland AG initially planned to build a residential tower in Berlin's central [[Alexanderplatz]] area. Trump's German business partner Hans Ulrich Gruber described Trump's aim as "to build a bridge between Berlin and New York." However, his plan for the tallest building in Germany in the capital city was stymied by Berlin's relatively low (150 m) limit for new building height.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw.com/en/donald-trumps-castles-in-the-german-sky/a-36472081&lt;/ref&gt; 

The company settled on [[:de:Pragsattel|Pragsattel]] ([[Stuttgart]]) for the [[construction]] of what was to be a 55-story (220 m tall) building named Trump Tower, which would have been the highest building in south Germany. The project investment was estimated at 250 million Euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.serie-ablage-p-4-der-trump-tower-eine-luftnummer-page1.d66363fe-6cfe-40df-a031-d408c66224f8.html|title=Serie: Ablage P (4): Der Trump Tower - eine Luftnummer|last=Germany|first=Stuttgarter Zeitung, Stuttgart,|newspaper=stuttgarter-zeitung.de|language=de-DE|access-date=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/hochhaeuser-in-berlin-ein-trump-tower-fuer-den-alex/177544.html|title=Hochhäuser in Berlin: Ein Trump-Tower für den Alex|access-date=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.berliner-kurier.de/frankfurt-will-berlin-trump-tower-klauen-16903856|title=Frankfurt will Berlin Trump-Tower klauen|newspaper=Berliner-Kurier.de|language=de-DE|access-date=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ahgz.de/regional-und-lokal/trump-tower-wird-in-frankfurt-gebaut,110132545.html|title=Trump Tower wird in Frankfurt gebaut|last=Germany|first=Matthaes Verlag GmbH, Stuttgart,|newspaper=AHGZ.de|access-date=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/architektur-europas-erster-trump-tower-setzt-auf-sicherheit-138965.html|title=Architektur: Europas erster Trump-Tower setzt auf Sicherheit|last=Koerner|first=Swantje-Britt|date=2001-10-25|newspaper=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|issn=0174-4909|access-date=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.immobilien-zeitung.de/137679/zwei-grossprojekte-an-city-prag-geplant|title=Zwei Großprojekte an der City Prag geplant|last=Lange|first=Dagmar|date=2016-08-18|website=immobilien-zeitung.de|publisher=ImmobilienZeitung|access-date=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans by architect [[:de:Peter P.

== Lawsuits ==
TD Trump Deutschland AG brought a suit against the city of Stuttgart for compensation following the city's decision to rescind permission to build the tower. The company lost that lawsuit in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.shortnews.de/id/508756/stuttgart-vs-trump-gericht-entscheidet-kein-schadenersatz-an-trump|title=Stuttgart vs. Trump: Gericht entscheidet - kein Schadenersatz an Trump|newspaper=ShortNews.de|access-date=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 December 2004, Marseille-Kliniken AG filed a lawsuit against the Trump Organization in the regional court of [[Landgericht Berlin]]. In the initial formation of the two companies' partnership, payment of the share capital of EUR 2 million by Trump Organization Inc. was pre-financed by Marseille-Kliniken AG. Subsequently, the suit claimed, the Trump Organization did not comply with its contractual obligations of the partnership formation. Marseille-Kliniken AG thus asked for repayment of the EUR 2 million it had pre-financed for Trump. The lawsuit was filed in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wallstreet-online.de/diskussion/896037-31-40/marseille-kliniken-ag-langfristig-mit-erheblichlichem-potential|title=Marseille-Kliniken AG langfristig mit erheblichlichem Potential....
