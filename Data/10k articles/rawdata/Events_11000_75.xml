      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6204">The '''1990 October Revolution Parade''' was the last parade commemorating the 1917 [[October Revolution]] during the [[Soviet Union]]'s existence. It celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the revolution. It was the first and last parade attended by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in his position as [[President of the Soviet Union]]. At the chimes of the [[Kremlin Clock]], Gorbachev gave an address to the nation. It would be the first and last time a Soviet leader made an address on [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] during an October Revolution parade. After the anthem was played, the commander of the parade Colonel General [[Nikolai Kalinin]] reported to the parade inspector [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] [[Dmitry Yazov]]. Providing the music for the parade was the head of the central orchestra of the [[Moscow Military District]], Major General Nikolai Mikhailov.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=RedSamurai84|title=HD Final Soviet October Revolution Parade, 1990 Парад 7 Ноября|date=2016-05-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxZux1KLhAQ&amp;list=PL0g-YW_Z9IPCaYXm13-jBZ8ohjSHgCO5_&amp;index=31|accessdate=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parade location in Kiev was changed from [[Khreshchatyk]] Street to Victory Square by order of the Kiev City Council.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Attempted assassination of Gorbachev ==
At 11:00 AM, an hour after the parade began, an attempt to kill President Gorbachev was made by Alexander Shmonov.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rbth.com/politics_and_society/politics/2017/02/16/the-last-soviet-terrorist-the-man-who-tried-to-assassinate-gorbachev_703611|title=The last Soviet terrorist: The man who tried to assassinate Gorbachev|last=Levkovich|first=Yevgeny|date=2017-02-16|work=Russia Beyond The Headlines|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two bullets he fired missed and he was tackled to the ground by crowds of demonstrators. Shmonov was the last would-be-assassin of the Soviet period before the USSR's dissolution in 1991. He was sent to forced treatment which took a heavy toll on his mental state. Three weeks prior to the parade, Shmonov bought a double-barreled hunting rifle. He took out his rifle and was spotted immediately by the police, and as he was taking aim, an officer ran over and jerked the rifle by the barrel as the crowd jumped on him. Soviet Central television did not broadcast the assassination attempt and resumed its regular broadcasting at 11:25 AM.{{refn|group=nb|"Broadcast television was interrupted at 11:10 a concert of classical music and resumed at 11:25."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ru.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%D0%A8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2,_%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80_%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87&amp;oldid=87373265|title=Шмонов, Александр Анатольевич|date=2017-09-01|website=Wikipedia|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=March 2017}}}}

'''Ahsan's Formula''' (or an '''Admiral Ahsan Mission''') was a fact-finding expedition and peace initiative mission dispatched by the [[Government of Pakistan|Pakistani government]] to [[East Pakistan]] in early 1971.{{rp|103-102}}&lt;ref name="Algora Publishing, Ehtisham" /&gt; The mission was led by [[Vice-Admiral]] [[Syed Mohammad Ahsan]], then-Governor of [[East Pakistan]] and commander of the [[Pakistan Eastern Command|East-Pakistani military]], with the support from his [[chief of staff]] [[Lieutenant-General]]  [[Sahabzada Yaqub Khan|Yaqub Ali Khan]] to investigate the prelude causes of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|civil war progress]] and to workout a peace initiative to end the political crises in the [[East Pakistan]] to avoid international humiliation of Pakistan.{{rp|109–110}}&lt;ref name="Algora Publishing, Ehtisham"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ehtisham|first1=S. Akhtar|title=A Medical Doctor Examines Life on Three Continents: A Pakistani View|date=1998|publisher=Algora Publishing|isbn=9780875866345|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IuseZxgbn8oC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=admiral+ahsan+formula&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYl5mx5-XQAhVCrVQKHWcgDfQQuwUIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=admiral%20ahsan%20formula&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission came in the wake of increasingly strained and difficult foreign relations between Pakistan and [[East Pakistan]] since the civil unrest had gripped East Pakistan as Awami League's demonstrations and demands for the provincial autonomy against Pakistan's central administration after the [[Pakistani general elections, 1970|general elections]] held in 1970.{{rp|156}}&lt;ref name="Lancer Publishers, Rao"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rao|first1=K. V. Krishna|title=Prepare Or Perish: A Study of National Security|publisher=Lancer Publishers|isbn=9788172120016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[1971 Dhaka University massacre|violent raids]] in [[Dhaka University]] by the [[Bangladesh Police|East-Pakistani police]] supported by the military stationed in East, and ultimatum issued by India to intervene in the conflict, the Pakistan had authorized Admiral Ahsan to carry out the investigations into a possible Indian intervention through a cable communication to work out a possible peace solution to end violence in East.{{rp|102}}&lt;ref name="Algora Publishing, Ehtisham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Progressive Publishers"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rizvi|first1=Hasan Askari|title=Internal Strife and External Intervention: India's Role in the Civil War in East Pakistan (Bangladesh)|publisher=Progressive Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recommendations based on the studies were roughly based on [[Six point movement|six-point movement]] proposed by the [[Awami League]] in 1969 and called for:
** [[Islamabad|Center]] [[Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report|would control]] the [[Ministry of Defence (Pakistan)|defence]], [[Military of Pakistan|military]], [[Foreign policy of Pakistan|foreign]], [[National Security Council of Pakistan|national security]], and the [[Pakistan Rupee|currency]].{{rp|102}}&lt;ref name="Algora Publishing, Ehtisham" /&gt;
** [[Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|Province(s) would have the authority to raise revenue]] and would fund the subject of the federation.{{rp|102}}&lt;ref name="Algora Publishing, Ehtisham" /&gt;
** [[Repatriation]] of [[West Pakistanis|Western Pakistanis]] citizens and bureaucrats to Pakistan with [[East Pakistanis|Eastern Pakistanis]] stationed back to East.
** Equal divisions of national assets between Pakistan and East Pakistan based on population census.

The Mission also called for Pakistan becoming a [[Federation of Pakistan|co-federation]] with Yahya Khan as President with Mujib being the Prime Minister of East while Bhutto being Prime Minister of Pakistan.{{rp|102}}&lt;ref name="Algora Publishing, Ehtisham" /&gt; Civil servants from Pakistan stationed in East would repatriated to Pakistan and the national assets would equally be divided between East and West Pakistan.{{rp|102}}&lt;ref name="Algora Publishing, Ehtisham" /&gt; The proposal was met with strong support from the [[United Nations|international community]] and India fell in line though reluctant.{{rp|102}}&lt;ref name="Algora Publishing, Ehtisham" /&gt;

The mission was met with support from the [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Yahya Khan]], opposition leaders [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] and the [[United Nations|international community]] while India fell in line despite criticising Pakistan.{{rp|102}}&lt;ref name="Algora Publishing, Ehtisham" /&gt; However, the Mission was not supported by the military elements in the [[President Yahya Khan#President of Pakistan|Yahya administration]] who debated acrimoniously over the scope of the mission's recommendations among the advisors in Yahya administration.{{rp|206–207}}&lt;ref name="University Press, Ahmad"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahmed|first1=Moudud|title=Bangladesh: constitutional quest for autonomy, 1950-1971|date=1979|publisher=University Press|isbn=3515029087}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the  mission studies and recommendations at the [[National Security Council (Pakistan)|National Security Council]] cabinet meeting were vetoed and no further study missions were directed to the East Pakistan.{{rp|122–137}}&lt;ref name="Stacey International"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bush|first1=Muhammad Yusuf|first2=Hamid|last2=Jalal|title=Pakistan: Past &amp; Present; a comprehensive study|date=1977|publisher=Stacey International|location=London|pages=288|isbn=0950330493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the fall of 1971, the mission's recommendations were bypassed with Admiral Ahsan submitting his resignation and posted back to Pakistan, followed by the resignation of [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Sahabzada Yaqub Khan|Yaqub Ali Khan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9291">The '''Asian Science Camp (ASC)''' is an annual forum for pre-[[college|collegiate]] and college students which aims at promoting discussion and cooperation among [[Asia]]n students for the betterment of science in the Asian region. The first ASC was held at [[Taipei]] in 2007, and was subsequently held at [[Bali]] (2008), [[Tsukuba|Tsukuba (Japan)]] (2009), [[Mumbai]] (2010), [[Daejeon|Daejeon (South Korea)]] (2011), Hebrew University of Jerusalem ([[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]]) (2012). This idea of an annual camp was co-proposed by [[Yuan Tseh Lee]] and [[Masatoshi Koshiba]] at the 2005 [[Nobel Laureate Meetings at Lindau]]. The ASC is modeled after the Lindau meetings.&lt;ref name='hbcse'&gt;{{cite web| url = http://asc2010.hbcse.tifr.res.in/ | title = Asian Science Camp 2010, Mumbai, India | accessdate = 2011-08-11 | publisher = [[TIFR]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110721181127/http://asc2010.hbcse.tifr.res.in/| archivedate= 21 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='asc2011about'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asc2011.kr/about.html |title=ASC 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812084536/http://www.asc2011.kr/about.html |archivedate=2011-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='asc2012'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.asc2012.ort.org.il | title = Asian Science Camp 2012, Jerusalem, Israel | accessdate = 2012-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The idea of the Asian Science Camp&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiansciencecamp.org/ Asian Science Camp]&lt;/ref&gt; was co-proposed in September 2005 after the 55th Annual meeting of Nobel Laureates and Students in Lindau, Germany, by Professor [[Yuan Tseh Lee]] (1986 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry) from Chinese Taipei,  and Professor [[Masatoshi Koshiba]] (2002 Nobel Laureate in Physics) from [[Japan]]. The proposal expressed the aim to enlighten science talented youths through discussions and dialogues with top scholars in the world, and promoting international friendship and cooperation among best young students of the next generation in Asia. The Lindau Meetings will serve as a model.  The Asian Science Camp would invite a dozen Nobel Laureates or world-distinguished scientists as speakers and devise an interesting program to attract all the participants, including plenary sessions, round table discussions, student master dialogues, a creative poster competition, social events and excursion. The working language would be English. This proposal was soon discussed in a board meeting of the Wu Chien-Shiung Education Foundation and was approved unanimously by the board.

The governing body of the Asian Science Camp is the International Board of Asian Science Camp (IBASC). IBASC is a not- for- profit organization, consisting of non-governmental educational institutions. The 2007 Asian Science Camp was organized by the [[Wu Chien-Shiung Education Foundation]] with the assistance of [[Academia Sinica in Taiwan]]. This non-government Foundation was established in 1995 to commemorate the monumental contributions of Madame Dr. Wu Chien-Shiung to physics and her lifelong love for science education. Since its inauguration in Taiwan in August 2007, the Asian Science Camp has become an International annual event in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asc2008.suryainstitute.org Asian Science Camp 2008, Bali, Indonesia]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227011855/http://asc2008.suryainstitute.org/ |date=February 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2699">{{About|the use of this phrase in computing|other uses|Birds of a Feather (disambiguation)}}
In [[computing]], '''BoF (birds of a feather)''' can refer to:
* An informal discussion group. Unlike [[special interest group]]s or [[working group]]s, BoFs are informal and often formed in an ''ad hoc'' manner. The acronym is used by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) to denote initial meetings of members interested in a particular issue.
* A BoF session, an informal meeting at [[Business conference|conference]]s, where the attendees group together based on a shared interest and carry out discussions without any pre-planned agenda.

==Details==
The first use of this term among computer specialists is uncertain, but it was employed during [[DECUS]] conferences and may have been used at [[SHARE (computing)|SHARE]] [[user group]] meetings in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Mad | last=Macz | year=2002 | title=Internet Underground: The Way of the Hacker | publisher=PageFree Publishing, Inc | isbn=1930252536 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BoFs can facilitate networking and partnership formation among subgroups, including functionally oriented groups such as CEOs or geographically oriented groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2001_March_13/ai_71627961 | title="Birds of a Feather" Sessions Highlight Revamped ISPCON Spring Conference | date=March 13, 2001 | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | accessdate=2008-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; BoFs generally allow for more audience interaction than the panel discussions typically seen at conventions; the discussions are not completely unguided, though, as there is still a discussion leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2004_May_18/ai_n6032036 | title=Mac Users to Drive Discussions During Birds of a Feather Meetings at Macworld Conference &amp; Expo | date=May 18, 2004 | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | accessdate=2008-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Term===
The term is derived from the proverb "[[wikt:birds of a feather flock together|Birds of a feather flock together]]". The ([[idiomatic]]) phrase ''"birds of a feather"'' meaning "people having similar characters, backgrounds, interests, or beliefs". In old poetic English, "birds of a feather" means birds which have the same kind of feathers, so the proverb refers to the fact that birds congregate with birds of their own species.

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''{{'s}} earliest citation for "''Chew the fat''" is from 1885 in a book by J Brunlees Patterson called ''Life in the Ranks of the British Army in India''. He implied it was a kind of general grumbling and bending of the ears of junior officers to stave off boredom, a typical part of army life.&lt;ref name=ww/&gt; Patterson also uses "chew the rag" in the same sentence he used "chew the fat", but it is not the oldest occurrence of that phrase.&lt;ref name=ww/&gt;  Prior to the adoption of metallic cartridges, most ammunition was composed of powder and a ball wrapped in paper or cloth soaked in animal fat, which was bitten open during musket drill. Soldiers were known to chew on these ends to pass the time and reduce nerves, and in some cases to stave off cravings for chewing tobacco. Though long-since replaced by 1885, the idea of biting or chewing on fat-soaked rag ends may well have entered military parlance in this fashion prior to Patterson's recording.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

{{Campaignbox Cromwellian conquest of Ireland}}

The '''Cromwellian conquest of Ireland''' or '''Cromwellian war in Ireland''' (1649–53) refers to the conquest of [[Ireland]] by the forces of the [[English Parliament]], led by [[Oliver Cromwell]], during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. Cromwell invaded Ireland with his [[New Model Army]] on behalf of [[England]]'s [[Rump Parliament]] in August 1649.

Following the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]], most of Ireland came under the control of the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Catholic Confederation]]. In early 1649, the Confederates allied with the English [[Cavalier|Royalists]], who had been defeated by the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] in the [[English Civil War]]. By May 1652, Cromwell's Parliamentarian army had defeated the Confederate and Royalist coalition in Ireland and occupied the country—bringing to an end the [[Irish Confederate Wars]] (or Eleven Years' War). However, [[guerrilla warfare]] continued for a further year. Cromwell passed a series of [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] against [[Roman Catholics]] (the vast majority of the population) and [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|confiscated large amounts of their land]].

The Parliamentarian reconquest of Ireland was brutal, and Cromwell is still a hated figure in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;"Of all these doings in Cromwell's Irish Chapter, each of us may say what he will. Yet to everyone it will at least be intelligible how his name came to be hated in the tenacious heart of Ireland". John Morley, Biography of Oliver Cromwell. Page 298. 1900 and 2001. {{ISBN|978-1-4212-6707-4}}.; "Cromwell is still a hate figure in Ireland today because of the brutal effectiveness of his campaigns in Ireland. Of course, his victories in Ireland made him a hero in Protestant England." {{cite web|url=http://www.learningcurve.gov.uk/civilwar/g5/cs2/s4/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928062053/http://www.learningcurve.gov.uk/civilwar/g5/cs2/s4/ |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy }} British National Archives web site.

==Background==
The English [[Rump Parliament]], victorious in the [[English Civil War]], and having executed [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] in January 1649, had several reasons for sending the [[New Model Army]] to [[Ireland]] in 1649.

The first and most pressing reason was an alliance signed in 1649 between the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Confederate Catholics]], Charles II (who had been proclaimed [[Kingdom of Ireland|King of Ireland]] in January 1649), and the English Royalists. This allowed for Royalist troops to be sent to Ireland and put the Irish Confederate [[Catholic]] troops under the command of Royalist officers led by [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde|James Butler, Earl of Ormonde]]. Their aim was to invade England and restore the monarchy there. This was a threat which the new [[English Commonwealth]] could not afford to ignore.

Secondly, Parliament also had a longstanding commitment to re-conquer Ireland dating back to the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. Even if the Irish Confederates had not allied themselves with the Royalists, it is likely that the English Parliament would have eventually tried to invade the country to crush Catholic power there. They had sent Parliamentary forces to Ireland throughout the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] (most of them under [[Michael Jones (soldier)|Michael Jones]] in 1647). They viewed Ireland as part of the territory governed by right by the [[Kingdom of England]] and only temporarily out of its control since the Rebellion of 1641. Many Parliamentarians wished to punish the Irish for atrocities against English [[Protestant]] settlers during the 1641 Uprising. Furthermore, some Irish towns (notably [[Wexford]] and [[Waterford]]) had acted as bases from which [[privateers]] had attacked English shipping throughout the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;O'Siochru, God's Executioner, p.69 &amp; 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the English Parliament had a financial imperative to invade Ireland to confiscate land there in order to repay its creditors. The Parliament had raised loans of £10 million under the [[Adventurers Act]] to subdue Ireland since 1642, on the basis that its creditors would be repaid with land confiscated from Irish Catholic rebels. To repay these loans, it would be necessary to conquer Ireland and confiscate such land. The Parliamentarians also had internal political reasons to send forces to Ireland. Army mutinies at [[Banbury mutiny|Banbury]] and [[Bishopsgate mutiny|Bishopsgate]] in April and May 1649 were unsettling the New Model Army, and the soldiers' demands would probably increase if they were left idle. 

Finally, for some Parliamentarians, the war in Ireland was a religious war. Cromwell and much of his army were [[Puritans]] who considered all Roman Catholics to be [[heretics]], and so for them the conquest was partly a [[crusade]]. The Irish Confederates had been supplied with arms and money by the [[Papacy]] and had welcomed the [[papal legate]] [[Pierfrancesco Scarampi]] and later the [[Papal Nuncio]] [[Giovanni Battista Rinuccini]] in 1643–49.

==The Battle of Rathmines and Cromwell's landing in Ireland==
{{Main|Battle of Rathmines}}

By the end of the period, known as [[Confederate Ireland]], in 1649 the only remaining Parliamentarian outpost in Ireland was in [[Dublin]], under the command of Colonel [[Michael Jones (soldier)|Michael Jones]]. A combined [[Cavalier|Royalist]] and [[Confederate Ireland|Confederate]] force under the [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde|Marquess of Ormonde]] gathered at [[Rathmines]], south of Dublin, [[Siege of Dublin (1649)|to take the city]] and deprive the [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarians]] of a port in which they could land. Jones, however, [[battle of Rathmines|launched a surprise attack]] on the Royalists while they were deploying on 2 August, putting them to flight. Jones claimed to have killed around 4,000 Royalist or Confederate soldiers and taken 2,517 prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;McKeiver, A New History of Cromwell's Irish Campaign, page.59&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oliver Cromwell]] called the battle "an astonishing mercy, so great and seasonable that we are like them that dreamed",&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Fraser, Cromwell, our Chief of Men (1973), p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; as it meant that he had a secure port at which he could land his army in Ireland, and that he retained the capital city. With Admiral [[Robert Blake (admiral)|Robert Blake]] blockading the remaining Royalist fleet under [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]] in [[Kinsale]], Cromwell landed on 15 August with thirty-five ships filled with troops and equipment. [[Henry Ireton]] landed two days later with a further seventy-seven ships.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Cromwell our Chief of Men, p.326&lt;/ref&gt;

Ormonde's troops retreated from around Dublin in disarray. They were badly demoralised by their unexpected defeat at Rathmines and were incapable of fighting another pitched battle in the short term. As a result, Ormonde hoped to hold the walled towns on Ireland's east coast to hold up the Cromwellian advance until the winter, when he hoped that "Colonel Hunger and Major Sickness" (i.e. hunger and disease) would deplete their ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Padraig Lenihan, Confederate Catholics at War, p.113&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Siege of Drogheda==
{{Main|Siege of Drogheda}}
Upon landing, Cromwell proceeded to take the other port cities on Ireland's east coast, to facilitate the efficient landing of supplies and reinforcements from England. The first town to fall was [[Drogheda]], about 50&amp;nbsp;km north of Dublin. Drogheda was garrisoned by a regiment of 3,000 English [[Cavalier|Royalist]] and Irish Confederate soldiers, commanded by [[Arthur Aston (army officer)|Arthur Aston]]. After a week-long siege, Cromwell's forces breached the walls protecting the town. Aston refused Cromwell's request that he surrender.&lt;ref name="ReillyP61"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reilly|first1=Tom|title=Cromwell, An Honourable Enemy|date=1999|publisher=Phoenix Press|location=London|isbn=1-84212-080-8|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing battle for the town, Cromwell ordered that no quarter be given,&lt;ref name="ReillyP71"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reilly|first1=Tom|title=Cromwell, An Honourable Enemy|date=1999|publisher=Phoenix Press|location=London|isbn=1-84212-080-8|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the majority of the garrison and Catholic priests were killed. Many civilians also died in the sack. Aston was beaten to death by the [[Roundhead]]s with his own wooden leg.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, pp.336–339. {{harvnb|Kenyon|Ohlmeyer|1998|p=98}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The massacre of the garrison in Drogheda, including some after they had surrendered and some who had sheltered in a church, was received with horror in Ireland and is used today as an example of Cromwell's extreme cruelty.&lt;ref&gt;O Siochru, ''God's Executioner'', pp. 82–91. Faber &amp; Faber (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Reilly in ''Cromwell, an Honourable Enemy'' (Dingle 1999), argues that what happened at Drogheda was not unusually severe by the standards of 17th century [[siege warfare]]. In ''Cromwell was Framed'' (2014), he claims that civilians were not targeted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theirishstory.com/2014/08/13/opinion-cromwell-was-framed/ Tom Reilly, Opinion - Cromwell was Framed The Irish Story]&lt;/ref&gt;

Having taken Drogheda, Cromwell took most of his army south to secure the south western ports. He sent a detachment of 5,000 men north under [[Robert Venables]] to take eastern [[Ulster]] from the remnants of a Scottish [[Covenanter]] army that had landed there in 1642. They defeated the Scots at the [[Battle of Lisnagarvey]] (6 December 1649) and linked up with a Parliamentarian army composed of English settlers based around [[Derry]] in western Ulster, which was commanded by [[Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Mountrath|Charles Coote]].

==Wexford, Waterford and Duncannon==
[[File:kilkenny castle.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Kilkenny Castle]]. The Irish Confederate capital of [[Kilkenny]] fell to Cromwell in 1650.]]
{{main|Sack of Wexford|Siege of Waterford}}

The [[New Model Army]] then marched south to secure the ports of [[Wexford]], [[Waterford]] and [[Duncannon]]. Wexford was the scene of another [[Sack of Wexford|infamous atrocity]], when Parliamentarian troops broke into the town while negotiations for its surrender were ongoing, and sacked it, killing about 2,000 soldiers and 1,500 townspeople and burning much of the town.{{sfn|Kenyon|Ohlmeyer|1998|p=100}} Cromwell's responsibility for the sack of Wexford is disputed. He did not order the attack on the town, and had been in the process of negotiating its surrender when his troops broke into the town. On the other hand, his critics point out that he made little effort to restrain his troops or to punish them afterwards for their conduct.

Arguably, the sack of Wexford was somewhat counter-productive for the Parliamentarians. The destruction of the town meant that the Parliamentarians could not use its port as a base for supplying their forces in Ireland. Secondly, the effects of the severe measures adopted at Drogheda and at Wexford were mixed. To some degree they may have been effective in discouraging future resistance.

The Royalist commander Ormonde thought that the terror of Cromwell's army had a paralysing effect on his forces. Towns like [[New Ross]] and [[Carlow]] subsequently surrendered on terms when besieged by Cromwell's forces. On the other hand, the massacres of the defenders of Drogheda and Wexford prolonged resistance elsewhere, as they convinced many Irish Catholics that they would be killed even if they surrendered.

Such towns as [[Waterford]], [[Duncannon]], [[Clonmel]], [[Limerick]] and [[Galway]] only surrendered after determined resistance. Cromwell was unable to take Waterford or Duncannon and the New Model Army had to retire to winter quarters, where many of its men died of disease, especially [[typhoid]] and [[dysentery]]. The port city of Waterford and Duncannon town eventually surrendered after prolonged sieges in 1650.

==Clonmel and the conquest of Munster==
{{Main|Siege of Clonmel}}
[[File:Henry Ireton.jpg|right|thumb|[[Henry Ireton]]. Cromwell passed the command of Parliamentarian forces in Ireland to Ireton in 1650. He died of disease at the [[Siege of Limerick (1650–51)|Siege of Limerick]] in 1651]]

The following spring, Cromwell mopped up the remaining [[walled town]]s in Ireland's southeast—notably the [[Confederate Ireland|Confederate]] capital of [[Kilkenny]], which surrendered on terms: see [[Siege of Kilkenny]]. The [[New Model Army]] met its only serious reverse in Ireland at the [[Siege of Clonmel]], where its attacks on the towns walls were repulsed at a cost of up to 2,000 men. The town nevertheless surrendered the following day.

Cromwell's treatment of Kilkenny and Clonmel is in contrast to that of Drogheda and Wexford. Despite the fact that his troops had suffered heavy casualties attacking the former two, Cromwell respected surrender terms which guaranteed the lives and property of the townspeople and the evacuation of armed Irish troops who were defending them. The change in attitude on the part of the Parliamentarian commander may have been a recognition that excessive cruelty was prolonging Irish resistance. However, in the case of Drogheda and Wexford no surrender agreement had been negotiated, and by the rules of continental siege warfare prevalent in the mid-17th century, this meant no quarter would be given; thus it can be argued that Cromwell's attitude had not changed.

Ormonde's Royalists still held most of [[Munster]], but were outflanked by a mutiny of their own garrison in [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. The British [[Protestant]] troops there had been fighting for the Parliament up to 1648 and resented fighting with the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Confederates]]. Their mutiny handed Cork and most of Munster to Cromwell and they defeated the local Irish [[garrison]] at the [[Battle of Macroom]]. The Irish and Royalist forces retreated behind the [[River Shannon]] into [[Connacht]] or (in the case of the remaining Munster forces) into the fastness of [[County Kerry|Kerry]].

==The collapse of the Royalist alliance==
In May 1650, Charles II repudiated his father's (Charles I's) [[Confederate Ireland#Military defeat and a new Ormonde peace|alliance]] with the Irish Confederates in preference for an alliance with the Scottish [[Covenanters]] (see [[Treaty of Breda (1650)|Treaty of Breda]]). This totally undermined Ormonde's position as head of a Royalist coalition in Ireland. Cromwell published generous surrender terms for Protestant Royalists in Ireland and many of them either capitulated or went over to the Parliamentarian side.

This left in the field only the remaining Irish Catholic armies and a few diehard English Royalists. From this point onwards, many Irish Catholics, including their bishops and clergy, questioned why they should accept Ormonde's leadership when his master, the King, had repudiated his alliance with them. Cromwell left Ireland in May 1650 to fight the [[Third English Civil War]] against the new Scottish-Royalist alliance. He passed his command onto [[Henry Ireton]].

==Scarrifholis and the destruction of the Ulster Army==
{{Main|Battle of Scarrifholis}}
The most formidable force left to the Irish and Royalists was the 6,000 strong army of [[Ulster]], formerly commanded by [[Owen Roe O'Neill]], who died in 1649. However the army was now commanded by an inexperienced Catholic bishop named [[Heber MacMahon]]. The Ulster Army met a Parliamentarian army, composed mainly of British settlers and commanded by Charles Coote, at the [[Battle of Scarrifholis]] in [[County Donegal]] in June 1650. The Ulster army was routed and as many as 2,000 of its men were killed.&lt;ref&gt;McKeiver, A New History of Cromwell's Irish Campaign, p.167.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, MacMahon and most of the Ulster Army's officers were either killed at the battle or captured and executed after it. This eliminated the last strong field army opposing the Parliamentarians in Ireland and secured for them the northern province of Ulster. Coote's army, despite suffering heavy losses at the [[Siege of Charlemont]], the last Catholic stronghold in the north, was now free to march south and invade the west coast of Ireland.

==The Sieges of Limerick and Galway==
{{Main|Siege of Limerick (1650–51)|Siege of Galway}}
[[File:John Castle Limerick-seabhcan.jpg|thumb|[[King John's Castle (Limerick)|King John's Castle]] and Thomond Bridge, Limerick city. Ireton took Limerick in 1651 after a long siege]]

The Parliamentarians crossed the [[River Shannon|Shannon]] into the western province of [[Connacht]] in October 1650. An Irish army under [[Ulick Burke, 1st Marquess of Clanricarde|Clanricarde]] had attempted to stop them but this was surprised and routed at the [[Battle of Meelick Island]]. Ormonde was discredited by the constant stream of defeats for the Irish and Royalist forces and no longer had the confidence of the men he commanded, particularly the Irish Confederates. He fled for France in December 1650 and was replaced by an Irish nobleman Ulick Burke of Clanricarde as commander. The Irish and Royalist forces were penned into the area west of the river Shannon and placed their last hope on defending the strongly walled cities of [[Limerick]] and [[Galway]] on Ireland's west coast. These cities had built extensive modern defences and could not be taken by a straightforward assault as at Drogheda or Wexford. [[Ireton]] besieged Limerick while Charles Coote surrounded Galway, but they were unable to take the strongly fortified cities and instead blockaded them until a combination of hunger and disease forced them to surrender. An Irish force from Kerry attempted to relieve Limerick from the south, but this was intercepted and routed at the [[Battle of Knocknaclashy]]. Limerick fell in 1651 and Galway the following year. Disease however killed indiscriminately and Ireton, along with thousands of Parliamentarian troops, died of [[pandemic|plague]] outside Limerick in 1651.&lt;ref&gt;Micheal O Siochru, God's Executioner, Oliver Cromwell and Conquest of Ireland, p.187.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guerrilla warfare, famine and plague==
[[File:Old-Galway.jpg|344px|thumb|Right|The heavily fortified city of Galway in 1651. It was the last Irish stronghold to fall to the Parliamentarians, surrendering in 1652.]]

The fall of Galway saw the end of organised resistance to the Cromwellian conquest, but fighting continued as small units of Irish troops launched [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla attacks]] on the Parliamentarians.

The guerrilla phase of the war had been going since late 1650 and at the end of 1651, despite the defeat of the main Irish or Royalist forces, there were still estimated to be 30,000 men in arms against the Parliamentarians. [[tóraidhe|Tories]] (from the Irish word ''tóraidhe'' meaning, "pursued man") operated from difficult terrain such as the [[Bog of Allen]], the [[Wicklow Mountains]] and the [[drumlin]] country in the north midlands, and within months, made the countryside extremely dangerous for all except large parties of Parliamentarian troops. Ireton mounted a [[punitive expedition]] to the Wicklow mountains in 1650 to try to put down the tories there, but without success.

By early 1651, it was reported that no English supply convoys were safe if they travelled more than two miles outside a military base. In response, the Parliamentarians destroyed food supplies and forcibly evicted civilians who were thought to be helping the Tories. [[John Hewson (regicide)|John Hewson]] systematically destroyed food stocks in counties Wicklow and [[County Kildare|Kildare]], [[Hardress Waller]] did likewise in the [[The Burren|Burren]] in [[County Clare]], as did Colonel Cook in [[County Wexford]]. The result was [[famine]] throughout much of Ireland, aggravated by an outbreak of [[bubonic plague]].&lt;ref&gt;Lenihan, p.122&lt;/ref&gt; As the guerrilla war ground on, the Parliamentarians, as of April 1651, designated areas such as [[County Wicklow]] and much of the south of the country as what would now be called [[Free fire zone|free-fire zone]]s, where anyone found would be, "taken slain and destroyed as enemies and their cattle and good shall be taken or spoiled as the goods of enemies".&lt;ref&gt;James Scott Wheeler, Cromwell in Ireland&lt;/ref&gt; This tactic had succeeded in the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]].

This phase of the war was by far the most costly in terms of civilian loss of life. The combination of warfare, famine and plague caused a huge mortality among the Irish population. [[William Petty]] estimated (in the 1655-56 [[Down Survey]]) that the death toll of the wars in Ireland since 1641 was over 618,000 people, or about 40% of the country's pre-war population. Of these, he estimated that over 400,000 were Catholics, 167,000 killed directly by war or famine, and the remainder by war-related disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kenyon|Ohlmeyer|1998|p=278}}. Scott Wheeler, Cromwell in Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern estimates put the toll at closer to 20%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theirishstory.com/2014/01/22/from-catastrophe-to-baby-boom-population-change-in-early-modern-ireland-1641-1741/&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, some fifty thousand&lt;ref name=ocallaghan85/&gt; Irish people, including prisoners of war, were sold as [[indentured labourer]]s under the English Commonwealth regime.{{sfn|Kenyon|Ohlmeyer|1998|p=134}}{{sfn|Higman|1997|pp=107, 108}} They were often sent to the English colonies in [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean]] where they subsequently comprised a substantial portion of certain [[Caribbean]] colony populations in the late 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahoney|first1=Michael|title=Irish indentured labour in the Caribbean|url=http://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/irish-indentured-labour-in-the-caribbean|website=UK National Archive|publisher=UK National Archive|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Barbados]], some of their descendants are known as [[Redlegs]].{{sfn|Irish Times staff|2009}}

Eventually, the guerrilla war was ended when the Parliamentarians published surrender terms in 1652 allowing Irish troops to go abroad to serve in foreign armies not at war with the [[Commonwealth of England]]. Most went to France or Spain. The largest Irish guerrilla forces under John Fitzpatrick (in [[Leinster]]), Edmund O'Dwyer (in Munster) and Edmund Daly (in Connacht) surrendered in 1652, under terms signed at Kilkenny in May of that year. However, up to 11,000 men, mostly in [[Ulster]], were still thought to be in the field at the end of the year. The last Irish and Royalist forces (the remnants of the Confederate's Ulster Army, led by Philip O'Reilly) formally surrendered at [[Cloughoughter]] in [[County Cavan]] on 27 April 1653. However, low-level guerrilla warfare continued for the remainder of the decade and was accompanied by widespread lawlessness. Undoubtedly some of the tories were simple [[brigand]]s, whereas others were politically motivated. The Cromwellians distinguished in their rewards for information or capture of outlaws between "private tories" and "public tories".&lt;ref name="Third Burdensome Beast, A Tory."&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prendergast|first1=John Patrick|title=The Cromwellian Settlement of Ireland|date=1868|publisher=P M Haverty New York.|page=178,187|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=Yh8HAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=178&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Cromwellian Settlement==
{{Main|Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|Act of Settlement 1662}}

Cromwell imposed an extremely harsh settlement on the Irish Catholic population. This was because of his deep religious antipathy to the [[Catholic]] religion and to punish Irish Catholics for the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|rebellion of 1641]], in particular the massacres of Protestant settlers in Ulster. Also he needed to raise money to pay off his army and to repay the London merchants who had subsidised the war under the [[Adventurers Act]] back in 1640.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;!--Citation needed Cromwell was not in power in England until 1653, so much of the legislation was under the first Commonwealth not the Cromwellian Protectorship--&gt;

Anyone implicated in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|rebellion of 1641]] was executed. Those who participated in [[Confederate Ireland]] had all their land confiscated and thousands were transported to the [[West Indies]] as indentured labourers. Those Catholic landowners who had not taken part in the wars still had their land confiscated, although they were entitled to claim land in [[Connacht]] as compensation. In addition, no Catholics were allowed to live in towns. Irish soldiers who had fought in the Confederate and [[Cavalier|Royalist]] armies left the country in large numbers to find service in the armies of France and Spain—[[William Petty]] estimated their number at 54,000 men. The practice of Catholicism was banned and bounties were offered for the capture of priests, who were executed when found.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;!--for every sentence in this paragraph--&gt;

The [[Long Parliament]] had passed the [[Adventurers Act]] in 1640 (the act received royal assent in 1642), under which those who lent money to Parliament for the subjugation of Ireland would be paid in confiscated land in Ireland. In addition, Parliamentarian soldiers who served in Ireland were entitled to an allotment of confiscated land there, in lieu of their wages, which the Parliament was unable to pay in full. As a result, many thousands of [[New Model Army]] veterans were settled in Ireland. Moreover, the pre-war Protestant settlers greatly increased their ownership of land (see also: [[Plantations of Ireland#Cromwellian land confiscation (1652)|The Cromwellian Plantation]]).  Before the wars, Irish Catholics had owned 60% of the land in Ireland, whereas by the time of the [[English Restoration]], when compensations had been made to Catholic Royalists, they owned only 20% of it. During the Commonwealth period, Catholic landownership had fallen to 8%. Even after the Restoration of 1660, Catholics were barred from all public office, but not from the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;Lenihan, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical debate==
The Parliamentarian campaign in Ireland was the most ruthless of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Civil War period]]. In particular, Cromwell's actions at Drogheda and Wexford earned him a reputation for cruelty.

However, pro-Cromwell accounts argue that Cromwell's actions in Ireland were not excessively cruel by the standards of the day. Cromwell himself argued that his severity when he was in Ireland applied only to "men in arms" who opposed him.  Accounts of his massacres of civilians are still disputed.

Formally, Cromwell's command issued in Dublin shortly after his arrival states the following:

{{quote|I do hereby warn ... all Officers, Soldiers and others under my command not to do any wrong or violence toward Country People or any persons whotsoever, unless they be actually in arms or office with the enemy ... as they shall answer to the contrary at their utmost peril.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}}}

The purpose of this order was, at least in part, to ensure that the local population would sell food and other supplies to his troops. It is worth noting that the Parliamentarian Colonel [[Daniel Axtell]] was court-martialled by Ireton in 1650 as a result of atrocities committed by his soldiers during the [[Battle of Meelick Island]].

Cromwell's critics point to his response to a plea by Catholic Bishops to the Irish Catholic people to resist him in which he states that although his intention was not to "massacre, banish and destroy the Catholic inhabitants", if they did resist "I hope to be free from the misery and desolation, blood and ruin that shall befall them, and shall rejoice to exercise the utmost severity against them".{{sfn|Carlyle|2010|p=132}}&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The wording of this version is taken from a London edition, [[Thomas Carlyle]] notes that another contemporary version copied from the original Cork edition, ends with the phrase "and shall rejoice to act severity against them" and that he states "is probably the true reading" {{harv|Carlyle|2010|p=132}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also recently been argued, by Tom Reilly in ''Cromwell, an Honourable Enemy'',&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Dingle 1999 {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; that what happened at Drogheda and Wexford was not unusually severe by the standards of 17th century [[siege warfare]], in which the garrisons of towns taken by storm were routinely killed to discourage resistance in the future. [[John Morrill (historian)|John Morrill]] commented, "A major attempt at rehabilitation was attempted by Tom Reilly, Cromwell: An Honourable Enemy (London, 1999) but this has been largely rejected by other scholars."&lt;ref&gt;John Morrill. "Rewriting Cromwell: A Case of Deafening Silences." ''Canadian Journal of History.'' Dec 2003: 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Morrill himself argued, that what happened at Drogheda, "was without straightforward parallel in 17th century British or Irish history... So the Drogheda massacre does stand out for its mercilessness, for its combination of ruthlessness and calculation, for its combination of hot- and cold-bloodiness".&lt;ref&gt;Morrill pp. 263–265&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, historians critical of Cromwell point out that at the time the killings at Drogheda and Wexford were considered atrocities. They cite such sources as [[Edmund Ludlow]], the Parliamentarian commander in Ireland after Ireton's death, who wrote that the tactics used by Cromwell at Drogheda showed "extraordinary severity".

Cromwell's actions in Ireland occurred in the context of a mutually cruel war. In 1641–42 Irish insurgents in Ulster killed between 4,000 and 12,000 Protestant settlers who had settled on land where the former Catholic owners had been evicted to make way for them. These events were magnified in Protestant propaganda as an attempt by Irish Catholics to exterminate the English Protestant settlers in Ireland. In turn, this was used as justification by English Parliamentary and Scottish Covenant forces to take vengeance on the Irish Catholic population. A Parliamentary tract of 1655 argued that, "the whole Irish nation, consisting of gentry, clergy and commonality are engaged as one nation in this quarrel, to root out and extirpate all English Protestants from amongst them".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lawrence, The Interest of England in Irish transplantation (1655), quoted in Lenihan, Confederate Catholics at War, p.111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Atrocities were subsequently committed by all sides. When [[Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin|Murrough O'Brien]], the Earl of Inchiquin and Parliamentarian commander in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Sack of Cashel|took Cashel]] in 1647, he slaughtered the garrison and Catholic clergy there (including [[Theobald Stapleton]]), earning the nickname "Murrough of the Burnings". Inchiquin switched allegiances in 1648, becoming a commander of the Royalist forces. After such battles as [[battle of Dungans Hill|Dungans Hill]] and [[battle of Scarrifholis|Scarrifholis]], English Parliamentarian forces executed thousands of their Irish Catholic prisoners. Similarly, when the Confederate Catholic general [[Thomas Preston, 1st Viscount Tara|Thomas Preston]] took [[Maynooth]] in 1647, he hanged its Catholic defenders as [[apostates]].

Seen in this light, some have argued that the severe conduct of the Parliamentarian campaign of 1649–53 appears unexceptional.&lt;ref&gt;John Morrill. "Rewriting Cromwell: A Case of Deafening Silences." Canadian Journal of History. December 2003: 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the 1649–53 campaign remains notorious in Irish popular memory as it was responsible for a huge death toll among the Irish population. The main reason for this was the counter-guerrilla tactics used by such commanders as Henry Ireton, [[John Hewson (regicide)|John Hewson]] and Edmund Ludlow against the Catholic population from 1650, when large areas of the country still resisted the Parliamentary Army. These tactics included the wholesale burning of crops, forced population movement, and killing of civilians. 

Total excess deaths for the entire period of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] in Ireland was estimated by [[Sir William Petty]], the 17th Century economist, to be 600,000 out of a total Irish population of 1,400,000 in 1641.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Faolain |first1=Turlough |title=Blood On The Harp |date=1983 |page=191 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=X-XWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=william+petty+600000+Irish&amp;dq=william+petty+600000+Irish&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwieupnprojeAhUSNOwKHcrUCeMQ6AEIVjAJ |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=O' Connell |first1=Daniel |title=A collection of speeches spoken by ... on subjects connected with the catholic question |date=1828 |page=317 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H19_RUCZzNcC&amp;pg=PA317&amp;dq=william+petty+600000+Irish&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ2Ivlr4jeAhVK3qQKHQlVDME4ChDoAQg-MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=william%20petty%20600000%20Irish&amp;f=false |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Patrick |first1=Brantlinger |title=Dark Vanishings: Discourse on the Extinction of Primitive Races, 1800-1930 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ai5XAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT89&amp;dq=william+petty+600000+Irish&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwieupnprojeAhUSNOwKHcrUCeMQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=william%20petty%20600000%20Irish&amp;f=false |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; More modern estimates put the figure closer to 200,000 out of a population of 2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dregne |first1=Lukas |title=Just Warfare, or Genocide?: Oliver Cromwell and the Siege of Drogheda |url=https://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1187&amp;context=utpp |publisher=University of Montana |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the whole post-war Cromwellian settlement of Ireland has been characterised by historians such as Mark Levene and [[Alan Axelrod]] as [[ethnic cleansing]], in that it sought to remove Irish Catholics from the eastern part of the country, others such as the historical writer [[Tim Pat Coogan]] have described the actions of Cromwell and his subordinates as genocide.&lt;!-- GENOCIDE RFF TAG START--&gt;&lt;ref name=genocide&gt;

"Of course, this has never been the Irish view of Cromwell.&lt;br&gt; Most Irish remember him as the man responsible for the mass slaughter of civilians at Drogheda and Wexford and as the agent of the greatest episode of ethnic cleansing ever attempted in Western Europe as, within a decade, the percentage of land possessed by Catholics born in Ireland dropped from sixty to twenty. In a decade, the ownership of two-fifths of the land mass was transferred from several thousand Irish Catholic landowners to British Protestants. The gap between Irish and the English views of the seventeenth-century conquest remains unbridgeable and is governed by G. K. Chesterton's mirthless epigram of 1917, that 'it was a tragic necessity that the Irish should remember it; but it was far more tragic that the English forgot it'."

* Mark Levene (2005). ''Genocide in the Age of the Nation-State''. London: I.B. Tauris.
&lt;blockquote&gt;[The Act of Settlement of Ireland], and the parliamentary legislation which succeeded it the following year, is the nearest thing on paper in the English, and more broadly British, domestic record, to a programme of state-sanctioned and systematic ethnic cleansing of another people. The fact that it did not include "total" genocide in its remit, or that it failed to put into practice the vast majority of its proposed expulsions, ultimately, however, says less about the lethal determination of its makers and more about the political, structural and financial weakness of the early modern English state.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- GENOCIDE REF TAG END--&gt; The aftermath of the Cromwellian campaign and settlement saw extensive dispossession of landowners who were Catholic, and a huge drop in population. In the event, the much larger number of surviving poorer Catholics were not moved westwards; most of them had to fend for themselves by working for the new landowners.

==Long-term results==
The Cromwellian conquest completed the British [[Plantations of Ireland|colonisation]] of Ireland, which was merged into the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland]] in 1653–59. It destroyed the native Irish Catholic land-owning classes and replaced them with colonists with a British identity. The bitterness caused by the Cromwellian settlement was a powerful source of [[Irish nationalism]] from the 17th century onwards.

After the [[English Restoration|Stuart Restoration]] in 1660, [[Charles II of England]] restored about a third of the confiscated land to the former landlords in the [[Act of Settlement 1662]], but not all, as he needed political support from former parliamentarians in England. A generation later, during the [[Glorious Revolution]], many of the Irish Catholic landed class tried to reverse the remaining Cromwellian settlement in the [[Williamite War in Ireland]] (1689–91), where they fought en masse for the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]]. They were defeated once again, and many lost land that had been regranted after 1662. As a result, Irish and English Catholics did not become full political citizens of the British state again until [[Catholic Relief Act 1829|1829]] and were legally barred from buying valuable interests in land until the [[Papists Act 1778]].

'''Failure causes''' are defects in design, process, quality, or part application, which are the underlying cause of a failure or which initiate a process which leads to failure. Where failure depends on the user of the product or process, then [[human error]] must be considered.

==Component failure / Failure modes==

A part failure mode is the way in which a component fails "functionally" on the component level. Often a part has only a few failure modes. Thus a relay may fail to open or close contacts on demand. The failure mechanism that caused this can be of many different kinds, and often multiple factors play a role at the same time. They include [[corrosion]], [[welding]] of contacts due to an abnormal electric current, return spring [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue failure]], unintended command failure, dust accumulation and blockage of mechanism, etc. Seldom only one cause (hazard) can be identified that creates system failures. The real root causes can in theory in most cases be traced back to some kind of human error, e.g. design failure, operational errors, management failures, maintenance induced failures, specification failures, etc.

==Failure scenario==
A scenario is the complete identified possible sequence and combination of events, failures (failure modes), conditions, system states, leading to an end (failure) system state. It starts from causes (if known) leading to one particular end effect (the system failure condition). A failure scenario is for a system the same as the failure mechanism is for a component. Both result in a failure mode (state) of the system / component.

Rather than the simple description of symptoms that many product users or process participants might use, the term failure scenario / mechanism refers to a rather complete description, including the preconditions under which failure occurs, how the thing was being used, proximate and ultimate/final [[Causality (physics)|causes]] (if known), and any subsidiary or resulting failures that result.

The term is part of the engineering [[lexicon]], especially of engineers working to test and [[debugging|debug]] products or processes. Carefully observing and describing failure conditions, identifying whether failures are reproducible or transient, and hypothesizing what combination of conditions and sequence of events led to failure is part of the process of fixing design flaws or improving future [[iterations]]. The term may be applied to mechanical systems failure.

==Types of failure causes==
===Mechanical failure===
Some types of mechanical failure mechanisms are: excessive deflection, [[buckling]], [[ductile fracture]], [[brittle fracture]], [[impact (mechanics)|impact]], creep, relaxation, [[thermal shock]], [[wear]], corrosion,&lt;ref&gt;While corrosion is not technically a mechanical failure mode, it is usually included in mechanical failure modes because it leads directly to mechanical failures.&lt;/ref&gt; stress corrosion cracking, and various types of fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B2aAPVa1TloC|title=Metal Fatigue in Engineering|last=Stephens|first=Ralph I.|last2=Fatemi|first2=Ali|last3=Stephens|first3=Robert R.|last4=Fuchs|first4=Henry O.|date=2000-11-03|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780471510598|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each produces a different type of fracture surface, and other indicators near the fracture surface(s). The way the product is loaded, and the loading history are also important factors which determine the outcome. Of critical importance is design geometry because [[stress concentrations]] can magnify the applied load locally to very high levels, and from which [[Fracture|cracks]] usually grow.

Over time, as more is understood about a failure, the failure cause evolves from a description of symptoms and outcomes (that is, effects) to a systematic and relatively abstract [[model (abstract)|model]] of how, when, and why the failure comes about (that is, causes).

The more complex the product or situation, the more necessary a good understanding of its failure cause is to ensuring its proper operation (or repair).  [[Cascading failure]]s, for example, are particularly complex failure causes. [[Edge case]]s and [[corner case]]s are situations in which complex, unexpected, and difficult-to-debug problems often occur.

=== Failure by corrosion ===
Materials can be degraded by their environment by [[corrosion]] processes, such as [[rusting]] in the case of [[iron]] and [[steel]]. Such processes can also be affected by load in the mechanisms of [[stress corrosion cracking]] and [[environmental stress cracking]].

The '''Freewill Shakespeare Festival''', formerly known as the '''River City Shakespeare Festival''' was founded in 1989.  It is produced by the [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]]-based "Free Will Players" every summer from late-June to mid-July, with performances in the 1,000-seat Heritage Amphitheater in [[Hawrelak Park]] in Edmonton. The Festival includes full-scale professional productions of two plays by [[William Shakespeare]], as well as Camp Shakespeare, a summer drama camp for youth ages 8–16. In 2008, the festival was renamed the Freewill Shakespeare Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=e76a0bce-8de3-43ac-8643-a24c51881230 Shakespeare festival announces lineup, new name] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104114429/http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=e76a0bce-8de3-43ac-8643-a24c51881230 |date=2012-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to significant damage to Freewill's traditional venue at the Heritage Amphitheatre in Hawrelak Park, the festival's 2014 season took place inside the Myer Horowitz Theatre in the University of Alberta's Student's Union Building (8900 114 St.).

'''Global Crossing''' was a [[telecommunication]]s company that provided [[computer network]]ing services and operated a [[tier 1 carrier]]. It maintained a large [[backbone network]] and offered [[peering]], [[virtual private network]]s, leased lines, audio and video conferencing, long distance telephone, [[managed services]], [[dialup]], [[colocation centre]]s and [[VoIP]]. Its customer base ranged from individuals to large enterprises and other carriers, with emphasis on higher-margin layered services such as managed services and VoIP with leased lines. Its core network delivered services to more than 700 cities in more than 70 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110411005956/en/Level-3-Acquire-Global-Crossing | title=Level 3 to Acquire Global Crossing | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | date=April 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Global Crossing was the first global communications provider with [[IPv6]] natively deployed in both its private and public backbone networks.&lt;ref name=impsat&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://news.thomasnet.com/companystory/global-crossing-completes-acquisition-of-impsat-519482 | title=Global Crossing Completes Acquisition of Impsat | publisher=[[Thomas Register]] | date=May 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was legally domiciled in [[Bermuda]], although its administrative headquarters was in [[New Jersey]]. 

In 1999, during the [[dot-com bubble]], the company was valued at $47 billion.&lt;ref name=flameout&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/15/business/a-new-legal-chapter-for-a-90-s-flameout.html | title=A New Legal Chapter for a 90's Flameout | first=TIMOTHY L. | last=O'BRIEN | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=August 15, 2004}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bankruptcy&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2002/01/29/global-crossing-files-for-bankruptcy/fffcad1b-f522-479a-a9d4-659e74165b05/ | title=Global Crossing Files for Bankruptcy | first=Christopher | last=Stern | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=January 29, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the company never had a profitable year.&lt;ref name=flameout/&gt;

In 2002, the company filed for one of the largest bankruptcies in history and its executive were accused of covering up an [[accounting scandal]].

On October 3, 2011, the company was acquired by [[Level 3 Communications]] for $3 billion, including the assumption of $1.1 billion in debt.&lt;ref name=level3&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/level-3-completes-acquisition-of-global-crossing-131036448.html | title=Level 3 Completes Acquisition of Global Crossing | publisher=[[PR Newswire]] | date=October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Founding and early growth==
In March 1997, Global Crossing was founded by [[Gary Winnick]], the former manager of the bond desk of [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]], and his Drexel colleagues who moved on to work at [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce]] (CIBC): Abbott L. Brown, [[David L. Lee]], and Barry Porter. In 1997, the company raised $35 million, including investments by Winnick and the [[CIBC Argosy Merchant Funds]] (later [[Trimaran Capital Partners]]). 

CIBC later realized an estimated gain of $2 billion from its relatively small equity investment in the company, making it one of the most profitable investments by a financial institution in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/11/business/how-executives-prospered-as-global-crossing-collapsed.html | title=How Executives Prospered as Global Crossing Collapsed | first1=GERALDINE | last1=FABRIKANT | first2=SIMON | last2=ROMERO | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 11, 2002}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2002-03-10/the-drexel-connection-at-global-crossing | title=The Drexel Connection at Global Crossing | work=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] | date=March 11, 2002}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winnick salvaged $735 million from his $20 million investment, although his interest was worth $6 billion on paper at its peak.&lt;ref name=flameout/&gt;

Winnick was chairman of the company from 1997 until 2002. In 1998, he hired [[Lodwrick Cook]], former [[CEO]] of [[Atlantic Richfield Company]], as co-chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/03/business/the-rise-and-fall-of-global-dreams.html | title=The Rise And Fall Of Global Dreams | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 3, 2002}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Scanlon became the first CEO of the company in the same year, but was replaced in March 1999 by Robert Annunziata, who had resigned as president of [[AT&amp;T Corporation]]'s Business Services group to "build a company from start to finish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/12/business/fast-times-global-crossing-enjoying-spotlight-while-building-upstart.html | title=Fast Times at Global Crossing; Enjoying the Spotlight While Building An Upstart in Telecommunications | first=LAURA M. | last=HOLSON | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=October 12, 2000}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=profile/&gt;

In May 1999, the company made an offer to acquire [[US West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/1999/05/17/deals/crossing/ | title=US West, Global Crossing tie | work=[[CNNMoney]] | date=May 17, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the company was outbid by [[Qwest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB932332524549345218 | title=Qwest Wins U S West for $35 Billion, Ending Duel With Global Crossing | first=Rebecca | last=Blumenstein | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=July 19, 1999}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In July 1999, the company acquired [[Global Marine Systems]], the undersea cable maintenance business of [[Cable &amp; Wireless]], for $885 million.&lt;ref name=profile&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/corporate-profile-global-crossing-his-company-is-two-years-old-but-its-already-worth-pounds-20bn-1126582.html | title=Corporate profile: Global Crossing - His company is two years old.

Between 1999 and 2001, the company sponsored the [[Go Bowling at The Glen]] [[NASCAR]] race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Global+Crossing+Sponsors+NASCAR+Race+In+New+York.-a064078906 | title=Global Crossing Sponsors NASCAR Race In New York | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | date=August 11, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 1999, the company acquired [[Frontier Communications]], the former [[Rochester Telephone Corporation]], for $9.9 billion. It was renamed Global Crossing North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/global-crossing-completes-merger-with-frontier | title=Global Crossing completes merger with Frontier | work=[[Marketwatch]] | date=September 28, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The company also acquired 49% of SB Submarine Systems.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt;

In September 1999, the company formed Asia Global Crossing, a $1.3 billion joint venture with [[Softbank]] and [[Microsoft]] to build a fiber-optic network in Asia linking Japan, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/08/business/microsoft-to-join-fiber-optic-venture-in-asia.html | title=Microsoft to Join Fiber Optic Venture in Asia | first=SETH | last=SCHIESEL | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=September 8, 1999}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=profile/&gt;

In November 1999, the company acquired telecoms business of [[Racal]] for $1.65 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Global+Crossing+Completes+Acquisition+of+Racal+Telecom.-a057789204 | title=Global Crossing Completes Acquisition of Racal Telecom | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | date=November 24, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2000, the company formed a 50/50 joint venture with [[Hutchinson Whampoa]], valued at $1.2 billion, for a fiber-optic network in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.hutchison-whampoa.com/en/media/press_each.php?id=18 | title=Hutchison Whampoa and Global Crossing Complete Telecom Joint Venture in Hong Kong | publisher=[[Hutchinson Whampoa]] | date=January 10, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 2000, Annunziata resigned, receiving $160 million during his 13 month tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/18/business/fi-10004 | title=Global Crossing's Annunziata Gets $160 Million for 13 Months on Job | first=ELIZABETH | last=DOUGLASS | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=March 18, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo Hindery]], who had joined the company a few months earlier as head of its web hosting division, GlobalCenter, then became CEO.

In August 2000, the company attempted to rescue a Russian submarine during the [[Kursk submarine disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/aug/19/news/mn-7116 | title=Rescue Mission Steers Craft Operator Into Uncharted Waters | first=ELIZABETH | last=DOUGLASS | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=August 19, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2000, the company announced a deal to sell GlobalCenter to [[Exodus Communications]] for $6.5 billion in stock. By the time the deal closed in January 2001, the stock was only worth $1.95 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/oct/14/business/fi-56955/3 | title=Global's Lost Connection | first=ELIZABETH | last=DOUGLASS | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=October 14, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindery then resigned as CEO and was replaced with Thomas Casey, a lawyer who came to Global Crossing from [[Merrill Lynch]], where he was co-head of the global telecom investment banking group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2000/10/11/companies/global_crossing/ | title=Global Crossing CEO out | work=[[CNNMoney]] | date=October 11, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the year 2000, the company lost $1.4 billion.&lt;ref name=flameout/&gt;

In 2001, the company sold its local telephone operations and the Frontier name in 2001 to [[Citizens Communications]] for $3.65 billion in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/global-crossing-sells-its-local-business | title=Global Crossing sells local business | first=Jeffry | last=Bartash | work=[[Marketwatch]] | date=July 12, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2001, the company began discussing a transaction with [[Enron]] in which the company would pay Enron $650 million for its fiber-optic network in exchange for Enron paying the company $650 million to use the network, a move that would boost both companies' revenues without costing them anything. The transaction did not materialize.&lt;ref name=flameout/&gt;

In the fourth quarter of 2001, the company lost $3.4 billion on revenue of $793 million. In January 2002, the company filed [[bankruptcy]]. It listed total assets of $22.4 billion and debts of $12.4 billion and was paying annual interest of $600 million.&lt;ref name=bankruptcy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/anatomy-of-global-crossings-failure | title=Anatomy of Global Crossing's failure | first=Jeffry | last=Bartash | work=[[Marketwatch]] | date=January 29, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the bankruptcy, [[Hutchison Whampoa]] and [[ST Telemedia]] agreed to invest $750 million in the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2002/01/28/companies/globalcrossing/ | title=Global files for bankruptcy | work=[[CNNMoney]] | date=January 28, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutchinson Whampoa later pulled out of the deal due to regulatory resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.upi.com/ST-Telemedia-to-buy-Global-Crossing-stake/33741051752878/ | title=ST Telemedia to buy Global Crossing stake | first=SONIA | last=KOLESNIKOV | work=[[United Press International]] | date=April 30, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2002, Hutchinson Whampoa bought the company's 50% interest in the Hong Kong joint venture for $120 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.hutchison-whampoa.com/en/media/press_each.php?id=893 | title=Hutchison acquires Asia Global Crossing's interest in Hong Kong joint ventures for US$120 Million | publisher=[[Hutchinson Whampoa]] | date=April 29, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 2002, Global Crossing's Asian subsidiary, Asia Global Crossing, filed bankruptcy and sold its assets to Asia Netcom, a subsidiary of [[China Netcom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/nov/18/business/fi-asia18 | title=Asia Global Crossing Files for Bankruptcy | first1=James S. | last1=Granelli | first2=ELIZABETH | last2=DOUGLASS | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=November 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1998 and 2001, Winnick sold approximately $420 million in company stock and other executives sold an additional $900 million in company stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/covers/2002-02-27-global-crossing.htm | title=Global's warning signs there, Wall St. was unaware | first1=Jim | last1=Hopkins | first2=Matt | last2=Krantz | work=[[USA Today]] | date=February 26, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 9, 2003, the company emerged from bankruptcy and on April 1, 2004, the company once again became a [[public company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.sttelemedia.com/news/read/global-crossing-stock-to-begin-trading-on-nasdaq-national-market-today | title=Global Crossing Stock to Begin Trading on NASDAQ National Market Today | publisher=[[ST Telemedia]] | date=April 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 2004, Gary Winnick and other ex-executives settled lawsuits filed by investors and former employees accusing the executives of committing [[securities fraud]] by using improper accounting to inflate the company's revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/mar/20/business/fi-global20 | title=Global Crossing Ex-Execs to Pay $324 Million | first1=Alex | last1=Pham | first2=David | last2=Colker | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=March 20, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, the company announced the acquisition of UK-based [[Fibernet Corp.]] for £49.8 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/global-crossing-snaps-up-fibernet/ | title=Global Crossing snaps up Fibernet | first=Natasha | last=Lomas | work=[[ZDNet]] | date=October 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, the company acquired Impsat&lt;ref name=impsat/&gt;, a leading Argentine telecommunications company. Global Crossing and Impsat have had a commercial relationship since 2000, when Global Crossing selected Impsat as one of its providers of Point of Presence (PoP) facilities for Global Crossing's Latin American network, known as South American Crossing. Impsat has also been a customer of Global Crossing in Latin America since 2000. 

In October 2011, Level 3 Communications acquired the company for $3 billion, including the assumption of $1.1 billion in debt.&lt;ref name=level3/&gt;

==Controversies==
===Political activity===
The company contributed $250,000 to each of the [[2000 Republican National Convention]] and the [[2000 Democratic National Convention]] and made major contributions to politicians of both parties. The company also courted politicians to invest in the company. The company hired [[lobbyist]] and former [[United States Assistant Attorney General]] Anne Bingaman, married to Democratic New Mexico Senator [[Jeff Bingaman]], paying her $2.5 million between January and June 1999 to try to block licensing of an AT&amp;T, MCI, and Sprint consortium to lay cable from the U.S. to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/2002/03/13/0313topnews.html | title=House Committees To Investigate Global Crossing | first=Dan | last=Ackman | work=[[Forbes]] | date=March 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1015198215729065920 | title=Global Crossing Got Little in Return For Its Big Political Contributions | first1=Tom | last1=Hamburger | first2=John | last2=Harwood | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=March 4, 2002}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Golu''' is the festive display of dolls and figurines in South India during the autumn festive season, particularly around the multiday [[Navaratri]] (Dussehra, Dasara) festival of [[Hinduism]]. These displays are typically thematic, narrating a legend from a [[Hindu text]] or a secular cultural issue. They are also known as '''Kolu''', '''Gombe Habba''', '''Bommai Kolu''' or '''Bommala Koluvu'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/Unique-artistic-creative-Kolu-plans/article12547720.ece Unique, artistic, creative: Kolu plans], The Hindu (OCTOBER 06, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ClausDiamond2003p443"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter J.

Each displayed item in a golu display is sometimes called ''golu doll'' or equivalent. These are typically made by rural artisans from clay and local materials then brightly painted. They are generally arranged in an odd number of ''padis'' (tiers) to tell a story. Goddess-related themes are common, along with developments such as anticipated wedding within the family and of friends.&lt;ref name="ClausDiamond2003p443"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BornetBurger2012p192"/&gt; During the golu display season, families visit each other with gifts to view and chit-chat over the golu display, share festive foods, and sometimes play music or sing devotional songs together.&lt;ref name="BornetBurger2012p192"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Philippe Bornet|author2=Maya Burger|title=Religions in Play: Games, Rituals, and Virtual Worlds|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=t3X18dopUoMC&amp;pg=PA188 |year=2012|publisher= Theologischer Verlag Zürich|isbn=978-3-290-22010-5|pages=188–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vasudha Narayanan|editor=Knut A.

==Etymology==
[[File:Radhe Krishna - Navarathri Golu Dolls (15454637551).jpg|thumb|left|Radha Krishna as Kolu dolls.]]
Bommai Kolu in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] means ''Divine Presence''. Bommala Koluvu in [[Telugu language|Telugu]]  means ''Court of Toys'' and Bombe Habba means ''Doll Festival'' in Kannada. It is a part of the annual Dasara-Vijayadasami Hindu festival where young girls and women display dolls, figurine, court life, everyday scenes along with the divine presence of the Goddesses [[Saraswati]], [[Parvati]] and [[Laxmi]] in the Tamil, Kannada and Telugu households during [[Navaratri]] or The Nine nights.&lt;ref name="ClausDiamond2003p443"/&gt;

==Description==
On the first day of [[Navaratri]], following [[Ganesha|Ganapathi]] pooja, a welcoming ritual is performed for goddesses [[Saraswati]], [[Parvati]] and [[Lakshmi]] by Hindu ritual called Kalasa Ahvanam which is performed by an elderly male or female of the family. This is then followed by building a rack of odd-numbered shelves of ''Kolu'' (or ''Padi'') (usually 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11), set up using wooden planks. After the Kolu has been covered with fabric it is then adorned with various dolls, figurines and toys according to their size, with the deities at the top.&lt;ref name="BornetBurger2012p192"/&gt;

The Kolu is predominantly displayed with depictions from Hindu mythological [[Puranas]] text, court life, royal procession, ratha yatra, weddings, everyday scenes, miniature kitchen utensils, anything a little girl would have played with. It is a traditional practice to have wooden figurines of the bride and groom together, called '[[Marapachi Dolls|Marapacchi Bommai]]' or 'Pattada Gombe', usually made of sandalwood, teak or rosewood and decorated with new clothes each year before being displayed on the Kolu. In southern India, bride is presented with 'Marapacchi Bommai' during the wedding by her parents as part of wedding trousseau to initiate the yearly tradition of 'Navaratri Golu' in her new home with her husband.{{cn|date=November 2017}} These dolls come as couples dressed in their wedding attire, depicting husband and wife symbolizing prosperity and fertility and the start of the bride's Gollu collection. Display figurines are passed on from one generation to another as heirloom. In old Mysore area 'Pattada Gombe' is also believed to be a tribute to the Wodeyars the benevolent and progressive monarchs who ruled of the region for around 600 years.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

[[File:బొమ్మల కొలువు.JPG|thumb|A Bommala Koluvu display in early 1950s.]]
In the evenings, women within the neighborhood invite each other to visit their homes to view the Kolu displays; they also exchange gifts and sweets.  A ''Kuthuvilakku'' lamp is lit, in the middle of a decorated [[Rangoli]], while devotional hymns and [[shloka]]s are chanted. After performing the [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]], the food items that have been prepared are offered to the Goddess and then to the guests.&lt;ref name="BornetBurger2012p192"/&gt;

On the 9th day [[Saraswati Puja]], special pujas are offered to goddess [[Saraswati]], the divine source of wisdom and enlightenment. Books and musical instruments are placed in the puja and worshipped as a source of knowledge.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

The 10th day, [[Vijayadashami|Vijayadasami]], is the most auspicious day of all. It was the day on which evil was finally destroyed by good. It marks a new and prosperous beginning. Later, on the evening of [[Vijayadashami|Vijayadasami]], one of the doll from the display is symbolically put to sleep, and the Kalasa is moved a bit towards North to mark the end of that year's Navaratri golu.{{cn|date=November 2017}} Prayers are offered to thank the Lord for the successful completion of that year's Kolu and with hope of a successful one the next year. Then the Kolu is dismantled and packed up for the next year.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

==Significance==
Kolu also has a significant connection with the agricultural and handicrafts professions in India. Besides the economic aspect of the festival, it is an important occasion for socializing. During this season relatives and friends in south India make it a point to visit each other's homes. This is also a very important occasion that promotes creative expression for women and for the family to work together on an aesthetic aspect.&lt;ref name="BornetBurger2012p192"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vasudha Narayanan|editor=Knut A.

'''Grand Prix Masters''' was a one-make [[motor racing]] series featuring retired [[Formula One]] drivers. The inaugural (and sole 2005) event, at the [[Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit]] in [[South Africa]], took place on 11–13 November, but the series folded after a two-race season in 2006.

==Concept==
Grand Prix Masters was modeled on the lucrative seniors tours of golf and tennis. In order to compete, drivers must:

* Have retired from all forms of open wheel racing
* Have competed in F1 for two complete seasons
* Have passed a medical examination
* Be more than 45 years (later 40 in 2006) on 1 January for the season to follow, and have retired from F1 for two complete seasons.

==Car==
[[Image:2006FOS 2005GPMasters cropped.jpg|300px|thumb|right|2005 GP Masters Car]]
All participants raced identical [[open wheel car]]s, which are based on the 2000 [[Reynard Motorsport|Reynard]] 2KI [[Champ cars|Champ Car]]. The chassis was built by English constructor [[Delta Motorsport]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delta-motorsport.com/aboutdelta.htm Delta Motorsport - About Delta&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006085304/http://www.delta-motorsport.com/aboutdelta.htm |date=2008-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was powered by a [[naturally aspirated]], 3.5-litre, 80-degree [[V8 engine]] produced by [[Nicholson McLaren]]. The engine was based on the [[Cosworth]] XB engines previously used in [[Champ car|IndyCar]] racing, and according to the series' organisers, it produced more than 650[[Horsepower|bhp]] at 10,400 rpm with over {{convert|320|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} [[torque]] at 7,800 rpm.

In 2007 cars were to have been powered by a Mecachrome 90-degree V8 4.0 litre. It developed {{convert|600|bhp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} and revved to in excess of 9500 rpm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpmasters.com/News/6464.aspx Mecachrome powers the Masters&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055325/http://www.gpmasters.com/News/6464.aspx |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transmission (mechanics)|Gearbox]] operation was fully manual, and controlled by a contemporary paddle shift arrangement.

Grand Prix Masters promoters boasted that the 650&amp;nbsp;kg cars reach {{convert|200|mi/h|km/h||abbr=on}}. Claiming that the combination of stable [[aerodynamics]] and considerably simpler technology (than in use in modern [[Formula One]]) better demonstrate driver skill and promoted overtaking, electronic "drivers' aids" (such as [[traction control system|traction control]], [[power steering]] and [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]]) were absent, and [[brake]]s were made of steel rather than carbon (as in many contemporary [[Motorsport#Single-seater racing|single seater]] race cars) to increase braking distances.

==On track==
The Grand Prix Masters car first ran in late-September 2005 in the hands of [[Delta Motorsport]] Operations Director Simon Dowson. He reported a successful shakedown, despite appearing to sit very high in the car, his helmet appearing to sit level with the top of the roll-over hoop.

In mid-October 2005, [[Nigel Mansell]] and [[René Arnoux]] tested the car at the [[Pembrey Circuit]] in [[South Wales]]. 26 October saw the first multi-car test for the series, with Mansell, [[Andrea de Cesaris]], [[Stefan Johansson]], [[Derek Warwick]], [[Alex Caffi]], [[Hans-Joachim Stuck]], [[Patrick Tambay]] and [[Christian Danner]] running at the [[Silverstone Circuit]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=j8Ar6AXCoSY}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Cesaris was fastest, Danner slowest whilst Tambay crashed.

==Controversy==
There were questions surrounding the fitness of the former Formula One stars who ended up competing in the series. Participant [[Christian Danner]] questioned the ability of 1980 World Champion [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]] and former GP winner [[Patrick Tambay]] in particular, given the rapid expansion of these drivers' waistlines since retiring from racing. Jones hit back claiming the only time Danner had seen a Grand Prix podium was when he passed it on the way to the lavatory. Jones' lack of fitness at the first GP Masters event might suggest Danner's assessment had some merit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060501/FREE/60502002/1036/FREE You Can Go Home Again - AutoWeek Magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==2005: First race==
&lt;!-- [[2005 Grand Prix Masters season]] redirects to here --&gt;
The first event took place at Kyalami in South Africa on 13 November 2005. Nigel Mansell took pole then won after battling hard with Emerson Fittipaldi. Riccardo Patrese was third. Andrea de Cesaris finished fourth after a storming drive, where he pushed past Derek Warwick. Stefan Johansson spun out early on. Jacques Laffite retired with damaged right-front suspension after colliding with René Arnoux.
As predicted, Alan Jones proved a disappointment. In practice he was up to ten seconds off the pace of Mansell, before pulling out of the race –- ostensibly due to neck injury. He was replaced by [[Eliseo Salazar]].

Three races would be held in 2007, all cancelled due to organiser bankruptcy (see below section):

* {{flagicon|RSA}} [[Kyalami]] (South Africa), September 23

==Bankruptcy==
On 18 September 2007, Delta Motorsport, supplier of the GP Masters chassis, announced they were filing a petition with the British High Court to have the GP Masters Operating company placed in liquidation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/62536 autosport.com - GP Masters News: Winding up order served on GPM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; due to non-payment of invoices. Following a hearing on 28 November 2007, the Grand Prix Masters series was officially wound up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/64156 autosport.com - GP Masters News: Masters series officially wound up&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

GP Masters should not be confused with the Masters Series, owned by Ron Maiden, which runs various historic race series.

In the first quarter of 2008 Delta Motorsport stated that they intend to re-launch the series under the name F1 Masters using the original car that they manufactured for the GP Masters series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grandprixmastersonline.com/f1masters.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910221807/http://www.grandprixmastersonline.com/f1masters.php |archivedate=2008-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Great New Orleans Fire (1794)''' was a fire that destroyed 212 structures in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] on December 8, 1794, in the area now known as the [[French Quarter]] from Burgundy to Chartres Street, almost to the riverfront buildings.&lt;ref name=FQfire&gt;{{cite web|title=French Quarter Fire and Floord|url=http://www.frenchquarter.com/history/elements.php|website=New Orleans French Quarter|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NOfire&gt;{{cite web|title=A Great and Growing City|url=http://nutrias.org/exhibits/purchase/contents.htm|website=Nutrias|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another 856 buildings had been destroyed 6 years earlier, in the [[Great New Orleans Fire (1788)|First Great New Orleans Fire]] on March 21, 1788.&lt;ref name=FQfire/&gt;

== History ==
The fire started on December 8, 1794.

The fire area stretched across 212 buildings, including the royal jail.&lt;ref name=FQfire/&gt; It spared the Mississippi River front buildings. Among the buildings spared were the Customs House, the tobacco warehouses, the Governor's Building, the Royal Hospital, and the Ursulines Convent. Despite widespread fire damage, the [[St. Louis Cathedral, New Orleans|St. Louis Cathedral]] was not destroyed but was dedicated just 2 weeks later, on December 23, 1794.

Afterward, the [[schooner]] ''Nuestra Señora del Cármen'' was used as a temporary jail during the period December 10, 1794 to February 26, 1795. The ship's owner, Don Prospero Ferrayolo, received rental payments for use of the ship, replacing the royal jail destroyed during the fire.&lt;ref name=NOfire/&gt;

The Spanish were to replace the wooden buildings with structures with courtyards, thick [[brick]] walls, arcades, and wrought iron balconies.&lt;ref name=FQfire/&gt; Among the new buildings were the signature New Orleans buildings of [[St. Louis Cathedral, New Orleans|St. Louis Cathedral]] (1794), [[the Cabildo]] (1799), and [[the Presbytere]] (1797), all designed by [[Gilberto Guillemard]].&lt;ref name=NOfire/&gt;

In 1795, Don [[Andrés Almonaster y Rojas]] had agreed to pay for construction of the building now known as the Cabildo. It replaced an earlier structure that had been destroyed by the fire. Almonester had already commissioned Gilberto Guillemard to design the new cathedral and Presbytere.

Just 6 years earlier, on March 21, 1788, another 856 buildings had been destroyed in the [[Great New Orleans Fire (1788)]]. Still a colony of Spain, rebuilding after both fires continued in Spanish style, and most French architecture was eliminated from the French Quarter.&lt;ref name=FQfire/&gt;

[[File:2008-08 Halle 02.jpg|thumb|Halle Opera House]]
The '''Halle Opera House''' ({{Lang-de|'''Opernhaus Halle'''}}) is an [[opera house]] in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt]]. Originally named the '''Halle Town Theatre'''  ({{Lang-de|'''Stadttheater von Halle'''}}), the theatre was built in 1886. A bomb attack on 31 March 1945 destroyed much of the original building. Restorative work ensued a few years later, and the theatre reopened in 1951 under the name '''Landestheater Halle'''. In January 1992 it was renamed to its current title. The theatre is currently used for performances of [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[Play (theatre)|play]]s, and [[orchestra]]l concerts. It is also the main performance venue for the annual summer [[Handel Festival, Halle|Handel Festival]] held in the city.

'''''Hit List''''' is an [[United States|American]] musical with music and lyrics by [[Marc Shaiman]], [[Scott Wittman]], [[Drew Gasparini]], [[Joe Iconis]], [[Andrew McMahon]], [[Benj Pasek]] &amp; [[Justin Paul]], and [[Lucie Silvas]] and a book by Julia Brownell, based on the original fictitious musical from the second season of the [[NBC]] television series ''[[Smash (U.S. TV series)|Smash]]''.

Within the television series ''Smash'' is created by characters Jimmy Collins ([[Jeremy Jordan (stage actor)|Jeremy Jordan]]) and Kyle Bishop ([[Andy Mientus]]). ''Hit List'' centers around three characters, Amanda, Jesse and "The Diva", as they seek to attain and hold onto fame. Amanda is portrayed by Karen Cartwright ([[Katharine McPhee]]), Jesse by Jimmy Collins and The Diva by Ana Vargas ([[Krysta Rodriguez]]).

On October 15, 2013, New York City venue [[54 Below]] announced plans to stage ''Hit List'' in concert format. Jordan, Mientus and Rodriguez each appeared, with [[Carrie Manolakos]] standing in for McPhee. The musical's original concert production opened on December 8, 2013 and closed December 9, 2013 after 3 regular performances.

==Development==
''Hit List'' was created for season two of ''Smash'', intended to be a rival production to ''Bombshell'', the [[Marilyn Monroe]] biographical musical created for season one. [[Drew Gasparini]], [[Joe Iconis]], [[Andrew McMahon]], [[Benj Pasek]] and [[Justin Paul]], [[Marc Shaiman]] and [[Scott Wittman]] and [[Lucie Silvas]] created the material for the fictional musical.&lt;ref name = rejoice&gt;[http://www.broadway.com/buzz/172361/smash-fans-rejoice-hit-list-to-debut-at-54-below-starring-jeremy-jordan-krysta-rodriguez-andy-mientus/ ''Smash'' Fans, Rejoice! ''Hit List'' to Debut at 54 Below, Starring Jeremy Jordan, Krysta Rodriguez &amp; Andy Mientus]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Smash'' season two [[showrunner]] [[Joshua Safran]] envisioned ''Hit List'' as a "scrappy underdog" to the senior ''Bombshell'',&lt;ref name = times /&gt; taking inspiration from the 2005 documentary film ''[[ShowBusiness: The Road to Broadway]]'',&lt;ref name = npr /&gt; and from Broadway seasons which saw ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'' head-to-head with ''[[Avenue Q]]'' and ''[[Billy Elliot (musical)|Billy Elliot]]'' in competition with ''[[Next to Normal|next to normal]]''.&lt;ref name = times /&gt;

Safran wanted the sound of the second musical to completely contrast with that of ''Bombshell'' so he turned to rising theater writers. The first two songs selected for ''Hit List'' were "Broadway, Here I Come" and "The Goodbye Song", both by Joe Iconis. "So, in a very strange way, those songs actually created ''Hit List''", Safran stated. He described ''Hit List'' as being about "really deal[ing] with the power of fame these days in the music industry or the arts. And the idea that in order to be somebody, you have to pretend to be somebody else."&lt;ref name = npr /&gt;

==Productions==
===Original 54 Below Concert Production===
After creating a cult-like following from the television show, ''Hit List'' opened for a three show engagement at [[54 Below]] on December 8, 2013 through December 9, 2013. The production was musically directed by Benjamin Rauhala, orchestrated by Charlie Rosen, and presented by Julia Brownell, Joshua Safran, and Jennifer Ashley Tepper. The original concert cast included [[Jeremy Jordan (stage actor)|Jeremy Jordan]] and Carrie Manolakos in the lead roles of Jesse and Amanda. The cast also featured [[Krysta Rodriguez]] as The Diva, [[Andy Mientus]] as Nick, and Eric William Morris as JB.

==Synopsis (2013 Concert Version)==

Setting: New York City, New Jersey, and Los Angeles, Modern Day
===Act I===

The Diva attends Nina Hope's concert she walks toward the stage raises a gun and pulls the trigger ("Broadway, Here I Come (Pre-Reprise)").

As "poor little rich girl" Amanda Brown performs for a record producer, she hopes that this is finally her time to make it as a pop star ("Good For You"). Jesse returns home to his dirty Brooklyn apartment where he is greeted by his roommate Nick. After a brief discussion with his roommate, Jesse goes to bed, but not before a quick smoke ("Rewrite This Story"). Following a confrontation with her family, who threaten to cut her off financially if she pursues her pop star dreams, Amanda depressed and lonely heads to a deserted Brooklyn pier, where she contemplates suicide ("Broadway, Here I Come!"). Jesse seeing that Amanda is about to kill herself, intervenes by singing to her ("Anymore"). Infatuated with Amanda, Jesse delightedly tells his roommate about his love for her ("If I Had You"). Growing closer together Jesse and Amanda discuss Hollywood's biggest pop-star to date, The Diva ("Reach For Me"). Jesse confused as to why Amanda would want to be a fake sell out like The Diva, sits while she explains what it takes to be original ("Original"). After making love, Amanda sneaks out of bed, steals all of Jesse's sheet music and disappears into the night. Days later Nick sits in the apartment writing when Jesse enters, they discuss Amanda's disappearance. Jesse the only one convinced Amanda didn't kill herself doubts that she will return. Two months later Jesse and Nick are closing up the bar in which they work at when Jesse takes interest in the radio. A familiar song echoes through the speakers as Jesse realizes it's Amanda singing one of his songs ("Anymore Reprise"). The radio DJ announces that the song is the newest single by up and rising pop-star Nina Hope. Jesse convinced he has to find Nina makes his way to Los Angeles ("I Heard Your Voice In A Dream"). Outside a small club Jesse comes face to face with Amanda transformed into Nina Hope. Jesse goes to Nina's hotel room, where he is coaxed into writing more music to help Nina's career. As Nina career ascends, Jesse falls back into drug abuse. Nina takes over the party of talent manager JB Planko and forces an audition onto him, he agrees to represent her ("Pretender"). Jesse looms over Nina, JB informs him that it doesn't matter if Nina lies about writing her own music regardless records will sell, after all it is a business ("Guide To Success"). Jesse sits in Nina's hotel room hidden away from the world writing music ("Don't Let Me Know (Pre-Reprise)"). Nina checks in on his writing and begins practicing "her" newest hit to perform for JB ("Don't Let Me Know"). JB loving Nina wants to market her to the world, what better way then a duet performance on the international television broadcast of the [[MTV Video Music Award|VMAs]] between Nina and his currently biggest star The Diva ("I'm Not Sorry"). As Nina's career soars The Diva has a public breakdown. Nina goes on a publicity tour, advertising her new cd "Hopeful". Jesse appalled that Nina would throw The Diva under the bus on Conan, pleads for her to join him on a trip back to New York. Nina tells JB of her plans to return home for a brief trip when he kisses her, they make love. Jesse waits for Nina, who is not coming, depressed leaves without her ("Caught In The Storm").

===Act II===
Nick is on the phone trying to get a hold of Jesse, The Diva is hopelessly trying to find herself and blames Nina for her problems, Jesse is on his way home to New York ("Calling Out My Name"). Jesse and The Diva stand in front of two different doors, Jesse knocks first, Nick answers. Nick takes Jesse inside and gives him some advice ("Swim"). The Diva knocks on the door hoping to find her parents, she resumes her original identity, "Sara Smith". No one believes she was once The Diva and she spirals deeper into despair ("Haddonfield (15 Years Later)").Without Jesse to write for her, Nina attempts an original song at her concert ("Good For You (Reprise)"). Nina headed in a downward spiral breaks things off with JB, she returns to Jesse, now clean and sober, and expresses her desire to return to being the Amanda she used to be, with him at her side ("Heart-Shaped Wreckage").

Amanda, her work now polished by her experience as Nina, auditions again for the same record company executives who, along with the rest of the world, have no idea she used to be Nina (who has vanished without trace). She performs her first concert as herself and it is a moderate success. As she launches into her final song, Sara Smith arrives and shoots her ("Broadway, Here I Come! (Reprise)"). Sara Smith jumps on stage trying to promote her new song. Jesse holds Amanda in his arms, he tries to help her but it too late, Jesse sings his goodbyes to Amanda as she dies on stage ("The Love I Meant To Say"). The internet goes crazy over the news of The Diva's arrest, her mediocre single rises to the top, becoming bigger than she ever was. Jesse depressed, at the pier writes in his notebook ("Rewrite This Story (Reprise)"). The musical closes with Jesse once again bidding Amanda goodbye while The Diva is returned to her former glory despite the possibility that the next "Amanda" is out there ready to challenge her supremacy ("The Goodbye Song").

{{col-end}}
&lt;references group=note/&gt;

==Fictional genesis==
Karen Cartwright overhears Jimmy Collins performing "Broadway Here I Come" and calls director Derek Wills ([[Jack Davenport]]) to listen.&lt;ref&gt;''Smash'' Season 2 episode 1, "On Broadway"&lt;/ref&gt; She offers to introduce Jimmy and his writing partner, Kyle Bishop, to Derek. Jimmy initially refuses but at Kyle's urging he relents.&lt;ref&gt;''Smash'' Season 2 episode 2, "The Fallout"&lt;/ref&gt; The pair pitches the musical, about a poor boy with songwriting talent who falls for a rich girl who steals his songs. Derek agrees to help shape the musical, to be called ''Hit List''.&lt;ref&gt;''Smash'' Season 2 episode 3, "The Dramaturg"&lt;/ref&gt;

At Derek's suggestion, Jimmy and Kyle put together a [[workshop production]] of ''Hit List'' for the [[New York Fringe Festival]]. They do a read-through for friends, which is a disaster because of Kyle's weak book.&lt;ref&gt;''Smash'' Season 2 episode 5, "The Read-Through"&lt;/ref&gt; They press on with the Fringe presentation but Karen's commitment to ''Bombshell'' prevents her from appearing. The first staging is poorly received but Karen clandestinely appears in the second staging, which is applauded. With the success Derek sees the potential and attaches himself to the show as director.&lt;ref&gt;''Smash'' Season 2 episode 6, "The Fringe"&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a successful audition, Manhattan Theatre Workshop director Scott Nichols ([[Jesse L. Martin]]) offers to stage ''Hit List'' on his venue's "underground" stage. Karen withdraws from the role of [[Marilyn Monroe]] in ''Bombshell'' and joins the cast of ''Hit List'' as Amanda/Nina.&lt;ref&gt;''Smash'' Season 2 episode 7, "Musical Chairs"&lt;/ref&gt; After an impromptu audition in a bar, Ana secures the role of The Diva.&lt;ref&gt;''Smash'' Season 2 episode 9. "The Parents"&lt;/ref&gt; With the book still in trouble, Scott and Derek enlist Julia Houston ([[Debra Messing]]) to serve as [[Dramaturge|dramaturg]] for ''Hit List''.&lt;ref&gt;''Smash'' Season 2 episode 10, "The Surprise Party"&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hit List'' opens on the main stage at the Manhattan Theatre Project to excellent reviews. Broadway producer Jerry Rand ([[Michael Cristofer]]) commits to transferring it to the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]] on Broadway.&lt;ref name = newdate&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/183965-54-Below-Adds-Dec-8-Hit-List-Concert-Based-on-Fictional-Smash-Musical 54 Below Adds Dec. 8 ''Hit List'' Concert, Based on Fictional "Smash" Musical]&lt;/ref&gt; Jimmy's volatile attitude gets him fired from the production.

The night before ''Hit List'' is slated to open Off-Broadway, Kyle is struck by a car and killed.&lt;ref&gt;''Smash'' Season 2 episode 13, "The Producers"&lt;/ref&gt; Grief-stricken, the company decides to open anyway, performing a concert version of the show as a tribute. Moments after the show begins, Jimmy arrives and re-assumes the role of Jesse, performing "The Love I Meant to Say". The company then launches into the fully staged show.&lt;ref&gt;''Smash'' Season 2 episode 14, "The Phenomenon"&lt;/ref&gt;

With ''Hit List'' running on Broadway, a member of the company named Daisy Parker ([[Mara Davi]]) blackmails Derek with threats of a sexual harassment lawsuit unless he gives her the role of The Diva. To avoid scandal, Derek capitulates,&lt;ref&gt;''Smash'' Season 2 episode 15, "The Transfer",&lt;/ref&gt; leading Ana to threaten legal action.&lt;ref&gt;''Smash'' Season 2 episode 16, "The Nominations"&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hit List'' is nominated for 13 [[Tony Award]]s, facing off against rival show ''Bombshell'' (nominated in 12 categories). ''Hit List'' wins seven awards, including a posthumous Best Book Tony for Kyle, but loses Best Musical to ''Bombshell''. Karen loses Best Actress to Ivy Lynn ([[Megan Hilty]]) in the role of Marilyn.&lt;ref&gt;''Smash'' Season 2 episode 17, "The Tonys"&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Rent''==
Critics noted the similarities between ''Hit List'' and Kyle Bishop and the musical ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' and its creator, [[Jonathan Larson]]. Like ''Hit List'', ''Rent'' premiered in a workshop setting and transferred (although ''Rent'' went first to an [[Off-Broadway]] venue before going to Broadway). The morning before the show's Off-Broadway premiere, Larson died suddenly but the cast opened the show as scheduled. Like Kyle Bishop, Larson posthumously won the Tony Award for Best Book for a Musical (also Best Score). These parallels were intentional.

Two recurring cast members of ''Smash'', Jesse L. Martin and [[Daphne Rubin-Vega]], were also in the original cast of ''Rent''. [[Joshua Safran]], who was associated with ''Rent'' through his ex-boyfriend [[Anthony Rapp]], consulted with both actors to be sure they felt that the story was appropriate and not exploitative. "If Daphne or Jesse had said, 'We feel like this story is in poor taste,' or, 'We don’t think you should do this story,' we’d [have pulled] the plug on it ... Also, because I know them from back in the day — I lived with them ... I think they also felt like I had a connection to that history, and what I was doing was writing my life, in a way."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.buzzfeed.com/louispeitzman/born-to-die-why-smash-killed-off-a-fan-favorite-character Born To Die: Why "Smash" Killed Off A Fan Favorite Character]&lt;/ref&gt;

Andy Mientus has performed in ''Rent'' and was also aware of the parallels between his character and Larson. He was nervous about playing the parallels because of his connection to the show but hoped that it mirrored Larson's "enthusiasm and his light and positivity in a way that [made] that parallel something that’s a tribute and not exploitative. It’s about this kid who loves this art form more than anything, and has worked so hard and struggled so much to get the show to where it is, and then can’t be there to see it through. Hopefully that’s the story that we’re telling."&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvline.com/2013/05/04/smash-andy-mientus-kyle-dies-dead-interview/ Smash's Andy Mientus Talks Kyle's &lt;nowiki&gt;[Spoiler]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Hit List's Rent Parallels and Jimmy's Redemption]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real-world staging==
[[File:Artistpage_hitlist.jpg|thumb|right|Official poster for ''Hit List'']]
Safran initially expressed interest in staging a real-world version of ''Hit List'' during the second season. "We all talk about doing a ''Hit List'' concert at Joe's Pub, which everyone wants to do ... and if I did, I would use some of the songs we never used."&lt;ref name = vulture /&gt; Following a performance of the song "Broadway, Here I Come" on ''Smash'', [[54 Below]] artistic director Jennifer Ashley Tepper contacted Safran via the social networking site [[Twitter]]. Tepper had previously collaborated with [[Joe Iconis]], who wrote "Broadway, Here I Come".&lt;ref name = buzzfeed&gt;[https://www.buzzfeed.com/ericafutterman/how-hit-list-became-a-real-life-musical How “Hit List” Became A Real-Life Musical]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 2013, it was announced that ''Hit List'' would be staged in concert format at [[54 Below]] for two performances on December 9. 
Tickets for both shows sold out in under an hour. Because of the high demand, an additional performance was scheduled for December 8.&lt;ref name = newdate /&gt; The concerts, under the musical direction of Benjamin Rauhala, was presented by Safran and Tepper, with a book written by screenwriter Julia Brownell. ''Smash'' stars Jeremy Jordan, Andy Mientus and Krysta Rodriguez performed as "Jesse", "Nick" and "The Diva" respectively.&lt;ref name = rejoice /&gt;&lt;ref name = npr /&gt; [[Katharine McPhee]], whose character Karen Cartwright starred in the fictional ''Hit List'', was unavailable; her role of "Amanda" was performed by [[Carrie Manolakos]], who had recorded several [[Demo (music)|demo]] versions of songs performed on ''Smash''.&lt;ref name = times&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/07/theater/the-smash-that-wasnt-returns-for-3-concerts.html?_r=0 An Encore for the ‘Smash’ That Wasn’t]&lt;/ref&gt; Completing the cast are Molly Hager, Eric Michael Krop, Julia Mattison, Monet Julia Sabel, and Eric William Morris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/185217-Jeremy-Jordan-Krysta-Rodriguez-Andy-Mientus-Carrie-Manolakos-Bring-Smash-Musical-Hit-List-to-Life-Dec-8-9-at-54-Below Jeremy Jordan, Krysta Rodriguez, Andy Mientus, Carrie Manolakos Bring "Smash" Musical Hit List to Life Dec. 8-9 at 54 Below] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212103817/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/185217-Jeremy-Jordan-Krysta-Rodriguez-Andy-Mientus-Carrie-Manolakos-Bring-Smash-Musical-Hit-List-to-Life-Dec-8-9-at-54-Below |date=2013-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Songs that Safran had intended to use on ''Smash'' but did not were incorporated into the show, including "Anymore", "The Guide to Success"&lt;ref&gt;[http://popwatch.ew.com/2013/12/10/smash-hit-list-performance/ Ten things you missed when a New York theater put on 'Hit List' -- a musical from 'Smash']&lt;/ref&gt; and "Haddonfield, 15 Years Later" by Iconis, "Calling Out My Name"&lt;ref name = buzzfeed /&gt; by Lucie Silvas,&lt;ref name = npr /&gt; "If I Had You" by Gasparini and "Swim" by McMahon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/185297-Jeremy-Jordan-Krysta-Rodriguez-Andy-Mientus-Carrie-Manolakos-Prove-to-Be-a-Smash-in-54-Belows-Hit-List-Concert?tsrc=nx Jeremy Jordan, Krysta Rodriguez, Andy Mientus, Carrie Manolakos Prove to Be a "Smash" in 54 Below's Hit List Concert]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Hit List'' features 19 songs in total. Both Jordan and Rodriguez noted that the ''Hit List'' material when it appeared in ''Smash'' was more geared to advancing the ''Smash'' stories and characters rather than those of ''Hit List''. With the live staging some songs were performed by different characters from those who performed them for the series.&lt;ref name = npr&gt;[https://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2013/12/09/249741025/when-hit-list-got-another-shot-at-an-audience When 'Hit List' Got Another Shot At An Audience]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
''Times Square Chronicles'' described ''Hit List'' as "a show for anyone whose dreams are on the edge". Calling the show's sound "great" and its cast "energetic and vocal", the site declared that ''Hit List'' should come to Broadway or at least Off-Broadway but that the book should have explored a theme that its fictional writers proposed when pitching the show in ''Smash'', that the songs be an actual "hit list" for people who had wronged the character Jesse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.t2conline.com/54-below-presents-a-smash-hit-list-or-the-price-of-fame/ 54 Below Presents a Smash: Hit List or The Price of Fame]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeff Lunden for [[NPR]] concurred in part and dissented to an extent. Calling the concert "energetic", the cast "superb" and the music "genuinely impressive", he nonetheless expressed some doubt whether the show itself could be a hit. He would, however, buy a [[cast recording]].&lt;ref name = npr /&gt;

The ''[[New York Post]]'' declared ''Hit List'' to be "exhilarating" and the "hottest new musical in town". Citing the "workable book" as a "happy surprise", the ''Post'' praised the "energized" cast, singling out Jordan for special commendation, calling him "relaxed, charming and funny". ''Hit List'', the ''Post'' concluded, may prove to be ''Smash''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s legacy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nypost.com/2013/12/09/smash-spawn-hit-list-deserves-to-live-on/ ‘Smash’ spawn ‘Hit List’ deserves to live on]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
No plans to continue ''Hit List'' have been announced. The property is under the control of [[NBC]].&lt;ref name = times /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15084">{{Meyerbeer operas}}
'''''L'Africaine''''' (''The African Woman'') is a [[grand opera]] in five acts, the last work of the composer [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]. The French [[libretto]] by [[Eugène Scribe]] deals with fictitious events in the life of the Portuguese explorer [[Vasco da Gama]] – Meyerbeer's working title for the opera was in fact ''Vasco de Gama''. The opera had its first performance by the [[Paris Opéra]] at the [[Salle Le Peletier]] on 28 April 1865.

==Performance history==
[[File:Victor Warot in Meyerbeer's L'Africaine.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Victor Warot]] as Don Alvaro]]
The opera was premiered in a performing edition undertaken by [[François-Joseph Fétis]], as the composer had not prepared a final version by the time of his death the previous year. It is Fétis who gave the work its present title; Meyerbeer had referred to it as ''Vasco de Gama''. In fact it is clear from the text, with its references to [[Hinduism]], that the heroine Sélika hails not from Africa, but from a region of, or island nearby, India. [[Madagascar]] has been suggested as a compromise reconciliation. Gabriela Cruz has published a detailed analysis of the historical context of the events of the opera and the opera setting itself.&lt;ref&gt;Cruz, Gabriela, "Laughing at History: The Third Act of Meyerbeer's ''L'Africaine''" (March 1999). ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', '''11''' (1): pp. 31–76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cruz, Gabriela, "Meyerbeer's Music of the Future", ''Opera Quarterly'' 25: 169–202 (Summer–Autumn 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Meyerbeer worked on the score from 1854 to 1855. He had intended the role of Sélika for the soprano [[Sophie Cruvelli]], but Cruvelli's abrupt retirement from the public stage in January 1856 interrupted his plans.&lt;ref&gt;Camille Saint-Saëns, (Trans. Edwin Gile Rich),"Meyerbeer", ''Musical Memories'', Chapter XX. Boston: Small, Maynard &amp; Co., 1919&lt;/ref&gt;

The work had its British premiere at [[Covent Garden Theatre]], London, on 22 July 1865, and in New York on 1 December 1865. It also received its Italian premiere in 1865 in Bologna, conducted by [[Angelo Mariani (conductor)|Angelo Mariani]] and was staged four times at [[La Fenice]] between 1868 and 1892. It was also performed in Melbourne, Australia, in July 1866.

The opera was enormously successful in the 19th century, but along with Meyerbeer's other operas,it fell into almost complete neglect in the 20th century, except for very occasional revivals. [[Plácido Domingo]] has sung it in at least two productions: a revival at the [[War Memorial Opera House]] in San Francisco that premiered on November 13, 1973, with [[Shirley Verrett]]; and in 1977 at the [[Liceu]] in Barcelona, with [[Montserrat Caballé]]. To mark the 150th anniversary of Meyerbeer's death, the work was performed again at La Fenice in November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teatrolafenice.it/media/3vmye1384268377.doc Press release of Teatro La Fenice]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2013, Meyerbeer's original version in a new critical edition by [[Jürgen Schläder]] was performed by [[Chemnitz Opera]] under the original title ''Vasco de Gama''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Vasco de Gama''|url=http://www.theater-chemnitz.de/sparten/oper/oper_retrospektive/retro_oper_1213/vasco_de_gama.html|publisher=Die Theater Chemnitz|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714200135/http://www.theater-chemnitz.de/sparten/oper/oper_retrospektive/retro_oper_1213/vasco_de_gama.html|archivedate=2014-07-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Giacomo Meyerbeer – ''Vasco de Gama''|url=http://www.kulturradio.de/rezensionen/cd/2014/giacomo-meyerbeer-vasco-da-gama.html|website=Kulturradio|accessdate=15 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140615152605/http://www.kulturradio.de/rezensionen/cd/2014/giacomo-meyerbeer-vasco-da-gama.html|archivedate=15 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production was a success with audiences and critics and won the poll of German critics award presented by ''[[Opernwelt]]'' magazine annually as "Rediscovery of the year" in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opernhaus des Jahres|url=http://www.kultiversum.de/Opernwelt/Opernhaus-des-Jahres.html|website=Kultiversum.de|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This edition was also used for a production at the [[Deutsche Oper]] in October 2015, with [[Roberto Alagna]] as Vasco da Gama and [[Sophie Koch]] as Sélika.&lt;ref&gt;Solare, Carlos Maria.

==Synopsis==
The opera depicts fictional events in the life of the explorer [[Vasco da Gama]].

:Place: [[Lisbon]], at sea, and in an exotic new land
:Time: late 15th century

=== Act 1 ===
''The council chamber, Lisbon''

The beautiful Inès is forced by her father, the Grand Admiral Don Diego, to marry Don Pédro instead of her true love, Vasco da Gama. Da Gama, who is thought to have died in the expedition of [[Bartolomeu Dias]], appears at the Grand Council saying he has discovered a new land, and displaying Sélika and Nélusko as examples of a newly discovered race. His request for an expedition is refused, causing da Gama to attack the Grand Inquisitor, who [[anathema]]tises him. Da Gama is then imprisoned.

=== Act 2 ===
''The prison''

Sélika, who is in fact queen of the undiscovered land, saves da Gama, whom she loves, from being murdered by Nélusko, a member of her entourage. Inès agrees to marry Don Pédro if da Gama is freed; da Gama, not realising that Inès has made this bargain, and noticing her envy of Sélika, gives her Sélika and Nélusko as slaves. Don Pédro announces he is to mount an expedition to the new lands that were da Gama's discovery. Nélusko offers his services as pilot.

=== Act 3 ===
''On Don Pedro's ship''

Nélusko is navigating the ship, but is secretly planning to destroy the Europeans. He sings a ballad of the legend of [[Adamastor]], the destructive giant of the sea. Nélusko gives orders which will direct the ship into an oncoming storm. Da Gama has followed Don Pédro in another ship, and begs him to change course to avoid destruction. Don Pédro refuses, and orders him to be chained. The storm breaks out. Nélusko leads the local people to kill all the Europeans on the ships and only da Gama is spared.

=== Act 4 ===
''Sélika's island''

Sélika is met with a grand celebration and swears to uphold the island's laws, which include the execution of all strangers. Da Gama is captured by priests, who intend to sacrifice him. He is amazed by the wonders of the island, and sings the most famous aria of the opera "O Paradis!" (O Paradise!). Sélika saves him by saying that he is her husband, forcing Nélusko to swear this is true. Da Gama resigns himself to this new life, but hearing the voice of Inès, who is being taken to her execution, he rushes to find her.

=== Act 5 ===
''The island''

The reunion of da Gama and Inès is interrupted by Sélika, who feels betrayed. When she realises the strength of the lovers' affection, she allows them to return to Europe, telling Nélusko to escort them to da Gama's boat. She then commits suicide by inhaling the perfume of the poisonous blossoms of the [[manchineel]] tree. Nélusko follows her into death.

==Set designs for the premiere==
[[File:L'Africaine 1865 - settings - Gallica.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Set designs for the original production at the [[Salle Le Peletier]]]]
The stage designs for the original production at the Paris Opera were created by Auguste-Alfred Rubé and Philippe Chaperon for Act 1 (Council Scene) and Act 2 (Dungeon Scene); [[Charles-Antoine Cambon]] and Joseph Thierry for Act 3 (Sea Scene and Shipwreck) and Act 4 (Hindu Temple); [[Jean-Baptiste Lavastre]] for scene 1 of Act 5 (Queen's Garden, not shown); and [[Édouard Desplechin|Edouard Desplechin]] for scene 2 of Act 5 (The Manchineel Tree). Engravings depicting the amazing sets appeared in periodicals throughout Europe. The final scene designed by Desplechin received special praise for its originality. Possibly because of advance publicity and high expectations, the Shipwreck Scene of act 3, executed by numerous stagehands, was deemed by the press to be somewhat disappointing. However, [[Arthur Pougin]] writing in 1885 identified the scene as the epitome of the company's grand opera ''mise en scène''.&lt;ref&gt;Letellier, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="982">In non-consequentialist [[ethics|ethical thought,]] there is a moral distinction between [[murder|killing]] and '''letting die'''. Whereas killing involves intervention, letting die involves withholding care.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Judith (1976) Killing, letting die and the trolley problem The Monist, 59: 204-17&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in [[medical ethics]] there is a moral distinction between [[euthanasia]] and letting die. Legally, patients often have a right to reject life-sustaining care, in areas that do not permit euthanasia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/1001/p1555.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2020">{{refimprove|date=January 2012}}This list is concerned with severe and abnormal power outages which caused major power failures due to damage to a single [[thermal power station]] itself or its connections which take a significant amount of time - months or years to repair.

Whilst any [[electric grid]] is vulnerable to instability after the loss of a large generating source or [[transmission line]], this can generally be dealt with without serious inconvenience to customers. However some power stations can be exceptionally large in respect to connected grid capacity so that any failure for these proportionally large stations can be more problematic than the failure of a typically sized station.

'''Lorrin Andrews Thurston''' (July 31, 1858&amp;nbsp;– May 11, 1931) was an American lawyer, politician, and businessman born and raised in the [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]]. The grandson of two of the first Christian missionaries to Hawaii, Thurston played a prominent role in the [[overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom]] that replaced [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]] with the [[Republic of Hawaii]], dominated by American interests. He published the ''Pacific Commercial Advertiser'' (a forerunner of the present-day ''[[Honolulu Star-Advertiser]]''), and owned other enterprises. From 1906 to 1916 he and friends lobbied with national politicians to create a [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|National Park to preserve the Hawaiian Volcanoes]].

==Family life==
He was born on July 31, 1858, in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]].&lt;ref name="park"/&gt; His father was Asa Goodale Thurston and mother Sarah Andrews.&lt;ref name="thurstons"/&gt; On his father's side he was grandson of [[Asa and Lucy Goodale Thurston]], who were in the first company of American Christian Missionaries to the [[Hawaiian Islands]] in 1820.&lt;ref name="bishop"&gt;{{cite book| author=Sereno Edwards Bishop |title=Reminiscences of Old Hawaii |url=https://books.google.com/?id=pkhCAAAAIAAJ |year=1916 | isbn=1-104-37410-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his mother's side, he was also the grandson of another early missionary, [[Lorrin Andrews]]. His father was [[speaker (politics)|speaker]] of the house of representatives of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] but died when Lorrin was only a year and a half old in December 1859. He then moved to [[Maui]] with his mother.&lt;ref name="thurstons"&gt;{{cite book |title=Thurston genealogies |author=Brown Thurston |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SBBWAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA288 |year=1892 |publisher=Portland, Maine |edition=2nd |page =288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was fluent in the [[Hawaiian language]] and gave himself the Hawaiian nickname ''Kakina''.&lt;ref name="overthrow"/&gt;
In 1872, he attended [[Punahou School]], then known as Oahu College, where he played [[baseball]] with the sons of [[Alexander Cartwright]] (who invented the modern game). He was expelled shortly before graduation.&lt;ref name="press"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aEZlsHy70hUC |title=Presstime in paradise: The Life and Times of the Honolulu Advertiser, 1856–1995  |author=George Chaplin |year=1998 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=978-0-8248-2032-9  |pages=111–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; After working as a translator for a law firm and clerk at the Wailuku Sugar Company, he attended law school at [[Columbia University]]. He returned to Honolulu in 1881 and became partners in a law firm with [[William Owen Smith]].&lt;ref name="overthrow"&gt;{{cite book |title=Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q3o2BaNiJksC |author=Stephen Kinzer |year=2006 |publisher=Times Books |isbn=978-0-8050-7861-9 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Margaret Clarissa Shipman (daughter of missionary [[William Cornelius Shipman]] (1824–1861) from [[Hilo, Hawaii]] and brother of businessman [[William Herbert Shipman]]) in February 1884. They had a son Robert Shipman Thurston on February 1, 1888. Margaret died in childbirth on May 5, 1891 (as did the infant).&lt;ref name="press"/&gt;
On April 5, 1894, Lorrin Thurston married Harriet Potter of [[St. Joseph, Michigan|Saint Joseph, Michigan]]. They had a daughter Margaret Charter (the mother of [[Thurston Twigg-Smith]]) in 1895, and a son Lorrin Potter Thurston in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Historical Collections of Hawai'i |publisher=USGenWeb Archives |author=Darlene E. Kelley |url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/hi/statewide/newspapers/importan77nnw.txt }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lorrin Andrews Thurston died on May 11, 1931. In 1919, Robert Thurston married Evelyn M. Scott, and Margaret Charter married [[William Twigg-Smith]].

==Work==
Lorrin Thurston was influential in both the political arena and the business world of Hawaii.

===Politics===
He followed his father and became a member of the [[legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom]] in 1886.
Thurston inherited the conservative thinking of the missionaries, which put him at odds with Hawaiian royalty as well as immigrants such as Greek hotelier [[George Lycurgus]] who enjoyed lifestyles filled with gambling and liquor.&lt;ref name="greek"&gt;{{cite journal |hdl=10524/422 |title=The Queen's "Greek Artillery Fire": Greek Royalists in the Hawaiian Revolution and Counterrevolution |author=Helen G. Chapin |journal=Hawaiian Journal of History |year=1981 |volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Missionary Party would change its name to the [[Reform Party (Hawaii)|Reform Party]] in 1887, as it grew to include business owners.
In July 1887 Thurston authored what is called the "[[1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii|Bayonet Constitution]]" because it was imposed under threat by the Honolulu Rifle Company militia. It limited the executive power of the monarch [[King Kalākaua]]. Thurston became the powerful Interior Minister, with Englishman [[William Lowthian Green]] as minister of finance, as the old cabinet of [[Walter M. Gibson]] was ousted.&lt;ref name="gazette87"&gt;{{cite news |title= Appointment of a New Cabinet! |newspaper= Hawaiian Gazette |location= Honolulu |date= July 5, 1887 |page= 4 |url= http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025121/1887-07-05/ed-1/seq-4/ |accessdate= July 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Voting rights and membership of the legislature were based on property ownership, resulting in effective control by wealthy Americans and Europeans.
He served in the cabinet until June 17, 1890 when he was replaced by [[Charles N. Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH01ed.dir/doc.pdf |title=Interior, Minister of: office record |work= state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate= July 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]] became monarch in 1891 and tried to recover power with a new constitution. In 1892 Thurston led the Annexation Club, later adopting the more dramatic title [[Committee of Safety (Hawaii)|Committee of Safety]], which planned for making Hawaii a territory of the [[United States]]. In 1893 the Committee of Safety was supported by the U.S. Military in an [[overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom]], and the resulting [[Provisional Government of Hawaii]] was controlled by Thurston's committee.
Thurston headed the commission sent to [[Washington, D.C.]] to negotiate with [[Benjamin Harrison]] for American annexation. Lili{{okina}}uokalani and Crown Princess [[Ka'iulani|Victoria Ka{{okina}}iulani]] also traveled to Washington and made it clear the new government did not have the support of the majority of the Hawaiian population. As news spread of the force used, the proposed treaty met opposition and was not ratified. A century later in the [[Apology Resolution]] of 1993, the [[U.S. Congress]] apologized for the involvement of the [[United States Marine Corps]] in the overthrow, and the controversy continues to modern times.

In March 1893 [[Grover Cleveland]] became president, and disavowed the treaty. Thurston helped draft another constitution, and the [[Republic of Hawaii|Republic of Hawai{{okina}}i]] was declared on July 4, 1894. He appointed [[Sanford B. Dole]] to the office of President of the Republic. A series of attempted revolts called the [[Wilcox rebellions]] were defeated during this period. In 1897 [[William McKinley]] became president and Thurston's commission again lobbied for annexation. The [[Spanish–American War]] in April 1898 increased American interest in the Pacific, due to battles in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |hdl=10524/212 |title=The Summer of 1898 |author=Albertine Loomis |journal=Hawaiian Journal of History |year=1979 |volume=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
By July 1898 the annexation formed the [[Territory of Hawaii]] and Thurston retired from political office to run his business affairs.

===Business===
[[Image:Lorrin A. Thurston, 1916.jpg|thumb|left|Thurston circa 1916]]
In 1898 he purchased the ''Pacific Commercial Advertiser'' newspaper (forerunner of the present-day ''[[Honolulu Advertiser]]'').&lt;ref name="advertiser"&gt;{{cite web |title =Advertiser boasts a storied history  |author=Bob Krauss |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/commemorative/history |publisher=[[Honolulu Advertiser]] official web site |accessdate=2009-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As principal owner and publisher after 1900, he promoted the sugar and pineapple industries. He headed the Hawaiian Promotion Committee (which evolved into the [[Hawaii Visitors &amp; Convention Bureau]]), but his conservative values objected to the [[hula]] which he called "suggestive" and "indecent".&lt;ref name="press"/&gt; 
His fortunes rose considerably as a result of the 1898 annexation by the United States, since it removed all duties from shipments to the largest market. Thurston is credited with promoting the development of Hawai{{okina}}i's [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]]s and railroads and bringing the first electric street cars to Honolulu. 
Following [[World War I]] he called for government restrictions on Japanese-language schools, legislation that was ruled unconstitutional by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. Thurston put out a special edition to support the fight to ban billboards in Hawai{{okina}}i. He worked with [[Wallace Rider Farrington]] and [[Alexander Hume Ford]] to hold a world conference of newspaper editors.&lt;ref name="advertiser"/&gt;

He was also a volcano enthusiast, starting in his childhood exploring [[Haleakalā]] on Maui. He would act as an informal tour guide for visitors to the summit, and used oral history to estimate the time of its last eruption.&lt;ref name="park"/&gt; In 1891, he bought and expanded the [[Volcano House]] hotel at the rim of the active [[Kilauea|Kīlauea]] volcano on the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawai{{okina}}i]].&lt;ref name="hotel"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/hawaii-notes/vol5-2d.htm |title=The Volcano House |year=1953 |volume=5 |issue=2 |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |journal= Hawaii Nature Notes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurston commissioned a [[cyclorama]] of Kīlauea which he displayed in his travels to the mainland, including the Chicago [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893 and the [[California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894]] in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hawaiian Kingdom 1874–1893: the Kalakaua Dynasty |author=Ralph S. Kuykendall |year=1967 |isbn=978-0-87022-433-1 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |page=115 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=41gjgT5C0K8C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jaggar and Thurston at Kilauea.jpg|thumb|right|Thurston (center) at the volcano in 1917]]
Thurston eventually made peace with George Lycurgus, who had been an [[insurgent]] against Thurston's government, and sold him the Volcano House in 1902.
He also became friends with early [[volcanologist]] Dr. [[Thomas Jaggar]] in 1909 and raised money to fund the [[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]] in 1912. He used his newspaper to promote the national park idea and convinced the territorial legislature to fund a group of congressmen to visit Haleakalā and Kīlauea in 1907. The trip included a dinner cooked over active lava vents. He hosted a visit by the Secretary of the Interior [[James Rudolph Garfield]] in 1908, and another congressional visit in 1909. He convinced Governor [[Walter F. Frear]] to introduce a resolution supporting the idea, and formed a survey team to propose exact boundaries.  His newspaper printed endorsements of the park by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (a classmate at Columbia), conservationist [[John Muir]], and powerful Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]].&lt;ref name="park"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/hawaii-notes/vol5-2e.htm |title=Thurston, Father of Hawaii National Park |year=1953 |volume=5 |issue=2 |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |journal= Hawaii Nature Notes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1913 he explored a [[lava tube]] in [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]] that is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/havo/planyourvisit/craterrimtour_tube.htm |title=Thurston Lava Tube |publisher=Hawaii Volcanoes National Park official web site |accessdate=2009-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The park was finally formed in 1916.

He added a preface and published a second edition of his grandmother's book on early missionary life in May 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Lucy Goodale Thurston |title=Life and Times of Mrs. Lucy G. Thurston: Wife of Rev. Asa Thurston, Pioneer Missionary to the Sandwich Islands |url=https://books.google.com/?id=f1MXAAAAYAAJ |year=1872 |publisher=second edition 1921, reprinted by Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2007 |isbn=978-1-4325-4547-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His memoirs were published in a limited edition (along with those of Sanford Dole) after his death in 1931 by his newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Memoirs of the Hawaiian revolution |author1=Lorrin Andrews Thurston |author2=Sanford Ballard Dole |author3=Andrew Farrell |year=1936 |publisher=Advertiser publishing Co., Ltd. Honolulu |volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newspaper business was run by his son Lorrin Potter Thurston, whose policy of using the term "Jap" during [[World War II]] pleased the military, but not local readers of Japanese descent. After the war readership declined, until its hostile take-over in 1962 by Lorrin's grandson [[Thurston Twigg-Smith]] who changed to a more moderate editorial line. In 1992 it was sold to [[Gannett Company]] as the next generation of the family had no interest in running the paper.&lt;ref name="advertiser"/&gt; Twigg-Smith wrote a book about the overthrow and the role of his grandfather in 1998, and criticizing the modern [[Hawaiian Sovereignty movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Twigg-Smith|first=Thurston|authorlink=Thurston Twigg-Smith|title=Hawaiian Sovereignty: Do the Facts Matter?|year=1998|publisher=Goodale Publishing|location=Honolulu|isbn=978-0-9662945-0-7|oclc=39090004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1966, a chapel at Punahou School designed by [[Vladimir Ossipoff]] was named after Robert Shipman Thurston, Jr. of the class of 1941 who disappeared in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.punahou.edu/page.cfm?p=2787 |work= Punahou School web site |title= Thurston Memorial Chapel |accessdate= December 4, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110720190245/http://www.punahou.edu/page.cfm?p=2787 |archivedate= July 20, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Thurston's legacy is preserved throughout the islands. On Oahu, the Thurston name serves as a marker in many places, including a street named after Thurston in the [[Punchbowl Crater|Punchbowl]] neighborhood and the Thurston Memorial Chapel on the Punahou Campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.punahou.edu/page.cfm?p=1788 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527113911/http://www.punahou.edu/page.cfm?p=1788 |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others include Thurston Lava Tube at the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park]] on the Big Island.

In the 2009 film [[Princess Kaiulani (film)|Princess Kaiulani]], Thurston was portrayed by [[Barry Pepper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=1185344|title=Princess Kaiulani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludum Dare was originally only an [[Internet forum]]. The first competition&amp;mdash;often referred to as "Ludum Dare Zero"&amp;mdash;was held in April 2002, with 18 participants. Its popularity turned the focus towards the competitions rather than the forum. The time limit was subsequently increased to 48 hours, because 24 hours were decided to be too few.&lt;ref name=intel1&gt;{{cite web|last=Boswell|first=Wendy|title=Get Your Game On with Ludum Dare: Interview with Mike Kasprzak (Part 1)|url=http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2013/09/30/get-your-game-on-with-ludum-dare-interview-with-mike-kasprzak-part-1|work=Intel|accessdate=December 15, 2013|date=September 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011 the competition has seen significant annual increases in numbers of game submissions, partly owing to the public awareness of [[Minecraft]] designer [[Markus Persson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Peter|title=Ludum Dare for Rubyists: An Online 48 Hour Game Coding Competition|url=http://www.rubyinside.com/ludum-dare-for-rubyists-an-online-48-hour-game-coding-competition-5687.html|work=Ruby Inside|accessdate=December 15, 2013|date=December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has participated seven times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notch|url=http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/author/notch/|work=Ludum Dare|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2014, the event was very informal as the Ludum Dare team worked on it in their spare time. Due to the increasing number of contestants, long-time organizer Mike Kasprzak announced in September 2014 that he would attempt at setting up a business model allowing him to work full-time on the project.&lt;ref name="ldfuture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamasutra.com/view/news/225663/Ludum_Dare_organizer_ponders_the_game_jams_future.php|work=Gamasutra|title=Ludum Dare organizer ponders the game jam's future|date=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charging for Ludum Dare is however "out of question",&lt;ref name="ldfuture" /&gt; and money is currently exclusively raised through donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ludumdare.com/compo/2014/09/26/the-future-of-ludum-dare-part-3/|work=Ludum Dare|title=The Future of Ludum Dare (Part 3) – The Beginning|date=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Ludum Dare 35 in April 2016, an announcement acknowledged various issues regarding the game jam's rating system. In particular, it explained that some users had attempted to artificially boost their game ratings with alternate accounts. As a consequence of this problem, future Ludum Dare events were indefinitely cancelled pending a replacement website being constructed for hosting the game jam.&lt;ref&gt;http://ludumdare.com/compo/2016/06/08/well-this-is-awkward-2/&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a community backlash, and the game jam in August 2016 went ahead regardless, organized by website administrator and long-time community member ''sorceress''. In respect of the complaints previously raised, the community decided by referendum to forego the game rating phase after the game jam. So uniquely, there were no winners for that one event.&lt;ref&gt;http://ludumdare.com/compo/2016/06/09/august-ld-you-decide/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competition structure ==

Currently, Ludum Dare is held three times a year. In the week preceding each competition suggested themes are subject to votes by prospective participants. A theme is subsequently announced&lt;ref name=intel3&gt;{{cite web|last=Boswell|first=Wendy|title=Get Your Game On with Ludum Dare: Interview with Mike Kasprzak (Part 3)|url=http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2013/10/04/get-your-game-on-with-ludum-dare-interview-with-mike-kasprzak-part-3|work=Intel|accessdate=December 15, 2013|date=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; before participants are given 48 hours to create a [[video game]] (although [[board games]] or similar are accepted&lt;ref name=guide&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules and Guide|url=http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/rules/|work=Ludum Dare|accessdate=December 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that fits within it.  All game code and content must be created during the competition and by a single person, and [[source code]] is encouraged to be included. During the event many participants record multiple [[screenshot]]s of the development of their game to later produce a [[time-lapse]] video.&lt;ref name=timelapse /&gt; In addition, many broadcast a live [[streaming video|video stream]],&lt;ref name=intel2&gt;{{cite web|last=Boswell|first=Wendy|title=Get Your Game On with Ludum Dare: Interview with Mike Kasprzak (Part 2)|url=http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2013/10/02/get-your-game-on-with-ludum-dare-interview-with-mike-kasprzak-part-2|work=Intel|accessdate=December 15, 2013|date=October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly since April 2013, when a widget showing Ludum Dare video streams hosted on [[Twitch (website)|Twitch]] was added to the Ludum Dare website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kasprzak|first=Mike|title=Streaming Widget Alpha 2|url=http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2013/04/13/streaming-widget-alpha-2/|work=Ludum Dare|accessdate=December 15, 2013|date=April 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the competition participants are given three weeks to play and rate other submitted games to determine the winners.&lt;ref name=intel3 /&gt; There are no physical or cash prizes, but each participant retains full ownership of their game&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;&amp;mdash;some have achieved financial success after developing their initial submission.&lt;ref name=intel2 /&gt;

As of the 18th edition of the competition, which was held in August 2010, a more relaxed version called the "Jam" was introduced. The Jam, which allows development teams, private source code and an extended development time of 72 hours, takes place concurrently with the solo competition.&lt;ref name=guide /&gt;

A smaller competition called "Mini Ludum Dare" is held during months without a Ludum Dare. These are each hosted by a veteran participant who is free to decide the theme within which the games must fit.&lt;ref name=intel2 /&gt; The rules are generally the same as in Ludum Dare, but the 48-hour limitation is usually ignored in favor of late participation.

Every October Ludum Dare hosts the October Challenge, which challenges people to "Finish a game,  take it to market, and earn $1".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=October Challenge 2014|url=http://ludumdare.com/compo/2014/09/29/october-challenge-2014/|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants have 31 days to upload a link to their game to the website. The event is not competitive and is just a small event to encourage game development from people who do not make money from their games regularly.

'''Music Biennale Zagreb''' ({{lang-hr|Muzički biennale Zagreb}}, '''MBZ''') is an international festival of [[contemporary classical music|contemporary music]] in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]], organized by the [[Croatian Composers' Society]]. The [[wikt:biennale|Biennale]], founded by [[Milko Kelemen]] and held every spring of the odd years since 1961, has become one of the most important festivals of contemporary music in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="EFA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.efa-aef.eu/en/festivals/members/profile/83/Music%20Biennale%20Zagreb/ | title=Music Biennale Zagreb | work=efa-aef.eu | publisher=[[European Festivals Association]] | accessdate=2009-12-28 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720155916/http://www.efa-aef.eu/en/festivals/members/profile/83/Music%20Biennale%20Zagreb/ | archivedate=2011-07-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repertoire and format==
Throughout its history, the Biennale has given equal weight to classical 20th century repertoire and [[experimental music]],&lt;ref name="Vijenac"/&gt; encompassing a variety of musical forms, including [[orchestra|symphonic]] and [[chamber music|chamber]] concerts, [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[musical theatre|music theatre]] and [[multimedia]] performances.&lt;ref name="EFA"/&gt; Accompanying lectures, workshops and symposiums are also gaining prominence in recent years.&lt;ref name="Vijenac"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.matica.hr/vijenac/394/Injekcija%20suvremene%20glazbe/ | title=Injekcija suvremene glazbe | journal=[[Vijenac]] | issue=394 | date=9 April 2009 | last=Špoljarić | first=Mirta | publisher=[[Matica hrvatska]] | language=Croatian | accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Biennale has collaborated with some of the biggest international names in contemporary music, including [[Luciano Berio]], [[John Cage]], [[Peter Maxwell Davies]], [[Mauricio Kagel]], [[Witold Lutosławski]], [[Bruno Maderna]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.southeast-europe.eu/events/events-by-features/events-detail/article/music-biennale-zagreb.html?cHash=acbdedb011 | title=Music Biennale Zagreb | work=southeast-europe.eu | accessdate=2009-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival gained international prominence in the 1960s and the 1970s due in large part to an ambivalent position of [[Yugoslavia]] in the political and ideological divisions of the [[Cold War]], making it a unique gathering place for artists from both East and West.&lt;ref name="Vijenac"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/06/02/archives/east-meets-west-at-the-zagreb-biennale-festivals-best-soviets-and.html?sq=zagreb+biennale&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p | title=East Meets West at the Zagreb Biennale; Festival's Best Soviets and Nono | date=2 June 1963 | first=Gunther | last=Schuller | work=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mbz.hr/eng/o_mbzu | title=About MBZ | work=mbz.hr | publisher=[[Croatian Composers' Society]] | accessdate=2010-01-02 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120062352/http://www.mbz.hr/eng/o_mbzu | archivedate=2010-01-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as its founder had hoped, it has provided a boost for Croatian composers and musicians by accelerating their integration into world trends in contemporary music, especially through co-productions and partnerships with their foreign colleagues.&lt;ref name="Vijenac"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vjesnik.hr/pdf/2001%5C04%5C22%5C27A27.PDF | title=Biennale je poticaj za hrvatske skladatelje | date=22 April 2001 | work=[[Vjesnik]] | last=Haluza | first=Jana | language=Croatian | format=PDF | accessdate=2009-01-03}}{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also proved popular with the concert-going public, as its events are seen by almost ten thousand people, which, according to the festival's long-time director [[Ivo Josipović]], controverts the idea of Biennale being about a "group of freaks who pour water into a piano".&lt;ref name="Nacional 700"&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://arhiva.nacional.hr/en/clanak/50316/ivo-josipovic-presidential-ambitions-of-an-avant-garde-composer | title=Ivo Josipovic – presidential ambitions of an avant-garde composer | date=14 April 2009 | magazine=[[Nacional (weekly)|Nacional]] | issue=700 | last=Ožegović | first=Nina | archivedate=25 July 2012 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69QhKXEor?url=http://www.nacional.hr/en/clanak/50316/ivo-josipovic-presidential-ambitions-of-an-avant-garde-composer | accessdate=2018-03-09 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival's popularity is partly due to symbolic ticket prices: in 2011, entrance fee for most events was 20 [[Croatian kuna|HRK]] (c. [[euro|€]]3), while the festival pass was available for 150 HRK (€20).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mbz.hr/upload/ostalo/MBZ%202011%20cjenik.pdf | title=MBZ 2011 cjenik | work=mbz.hr | publisher=[[Croatian Composers' Society]] | format=PDF | language=Croatian | accessdate=2012-07-13 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 70% of the festival's funding is today provided by the [[Ministry of Culture (Croatia)|Ministry of Culture]] and the City of Zagreb, while the rest comes through donations and the festival's own income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.matica.hr/vijenac/394/Biennale%20u%20znaku%20umjetnosti%20i%20politike/ | title=Biennale u znaku umjetnosti i politike | journal=[[Vijenac]] | issue=394 | date=9 April 2009 | last=Jelača | first=Miljenko | publisher=[[Matica hrvatska]] | language=Croatian | accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the Biennale hosted the [[ISCM World Music Days]].&lt;ref name="EFA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="World Music Days"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mbz.hr/eng/vijesti/mbz_will_be_hosting_world_music_days_again | title=MBZ Hosts World Music Days Again! | work=mbz.hr | publisher=[[Croatian Composers' Society]] | accessdate=2010-01-02 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229162908/http://mbz.hr/eng/vijesti/mbz_will_be_hosting_world_music_days_again | archivedate=2008-12-29 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It hosted the World Music Days again in 2011, coinciding with the Biennale's 50th anniversary.&lt;ref name="World Music Days"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.iscm.org/activities/wmds/iscm-wmd-2011-zagreb | title=ISCM WMD 2011 Zagreb | work=iscm.org | publisher=[[International Society for Contemporary Music]] | accessdate=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Kelemen 030.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Croatian contemporary classical composer [[Milko Kelemen]] founded the Music Biennale Zagreb, served as its director from 1961 to 1979, and was later named the Biennale's honorary president.&lt;ref name="Vijenac"/&gt;]]

===The first Biennale===
The idea to organize the Biennale came from [[Milko Kelemen]], a Croatian contemporary classical composer. After studying [[musical composition|composition]] under [[Olivier Messiaen]] in [[Paris]] in 1954,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hdu.hr/porin/htm/MilkoKelemen.htm | title=Milko Kelemen | work=hdu.hr | publisher=Institute of Croatian Music Industry | language=Croatian | accessdate=2009-12-29 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519170723/http://www.hdu.hr/porin/htm/MilkoKelemen.htm | archivedate=2010-05-19 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelemen spent some time in [[Darmstadt]], where he was associated with the [[Darmstadt School]].&lt;ref name="Nacional 598"&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://arhiva.nacional.hr/clanak/33933/46-godina-poslije | title=46 godina poslije | magazine=[[Nacional (weekly)|Nacional]] | issue=598 | date=1 May 2007 | last=Čogelja | first=Miljenka | language=Croatian | accessdate=2018-03-09 |trans-title=46 years later|archivedate=9 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/692N1YFjk?url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/33933/46-godina-poslije}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to Zagreb, Kelemen got the impression that Croatian music was "eighty years behind", and in 1959 had an idea to organize an international festival of contemporary music.&lt;ref name="Nacional 598"/&gt; However, Zagreb Mayor [[Većeslav Holjevac]] was not interested until Kelemen threatened to organize the festival in [[Belgrade]] instead; even then, Holjevac could provide funding in domestic currency only, leaving the would-be organizers unable to pay any compensation to foreign participants.&lt;ref name="Nacional 598"/&gt;

Kelemen nevertheless had a plan. He visited [[Yekaterina Furtseva]], [[Minister of Culture of the Soviet Union]], and — knowing she was an ardent communist — told her that the influence of the United States and the West was getting stronger in [[Yugoslavia]], so Soviet musicians were needed in Zagreb. She not only accepted immediately, but also agreed to cover all expenses.&lt;ref name="Nacional 598"/&gt; After that, Kelemen traveled to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and spoke to the [[State Department]], this time arguing that Russian influence in Yugoslavia was very strong and that the Russians had already applied for performing in Zagreb. He asked for Americans to join in, and was again successful.&lt;ref name="Nacional 598"/&gt; Once Soviet and American participation was secured, Kelemen found that attracting the rest was "fairly easy".&lt;ref name="Nacional 598"/&gt; Still, his organizing efforts earned him two days in prison under interrogation by the [[UDBA|Yugoslav secret police]], because his frequent trips to Soviet Union and the USA were deemed suspicious.&lt;ref name="Nacional 598"/&gt; In the end, the first Biennale was a success noted even by ''[[The New York Times]]'', which published a half-page review of the event.&lt;ref name="Nacional 598"/&gt;

===1960s and 1970s===
One of the stars of the 2nd Biennale in 1963 was [[John Cage]]. Shortly before Cage was due to perform, Kelemen was warned by the authorities that any "antics" onstage such as crawling under the piano would lead to the festival being banned. Kelemen immediately relayed this to Cage, warned him about endangering the festival, and asked him to promise he would not crawl under the piano. Cage agreed, yet, as soon as his performance started, he did exactly that. This caused a sensation among the audience; according to Kelemen, "people went crazy" and gave Cage a big applause in the end.&lt;ref name="Nacional 598"/&gt;

The 3rd Biennale in 1965 was visited by [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Bruno Maderna]], [[Pierre Schaeffer]], and [[Olivier Messiaen]].&lt;ref name="Vijenac"/&gt;
[[File:Ivo Josipović election 2009-2010.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Professor of law, politician and composer [[Ivo Josipović]] was the Biennale's director from 1991 to 2010, when he assumed the office of the [[President of Croatia]].]]
The 8th Biennale in 1975 was the first to feature performances in the [[Vatroslav Lisinski Concert Hall]], a large hall and convention center that had opened in December 1973. Up to that time, the Biennale's mainstream events were held mostly in the [[Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb|Croatian National Theatre]].

At the 10th Biennale in 1979, a [[performance art|performance]] by [[Tomislav Gotovac]] caused some controversy. One hundred participants at the Republic Square (today's [[Ban Jelačić Square]]), instructed by Gotovac, blew their [[whistle]]s in accordance with the [[Sheet music|music score]] drawn in squares on the sidewalk. At one point, Gotovac unexpectedly stripped naked and started running from square to square. This was the first ever [[streaking]] act in Zagreb. Musicologist [[Nikša Gligo]], who was the art director of the 1979 festival, would later say Gotovac did not announce his undressing act, and if he did, Gligo would have tried to talk him out of it by arguing that [[body art]] is already ''[[passé]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.hfs.hr/hfs/zapis_clanak_detail.asp?sif=32599 | title=Antonio G.

===1980s to present===
In 1981, [[rock music]] was introduced to the Biennale, with a closing-night concert that featured [[Classix Nouveaux]] and [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]], together with some of the most prominent [[New wave music in Yugoslavia|Yugoslav new wave]] bands [[Električni orgazam]], [[Laboratorija zvuka]], [[Haustor]], and [[Šarlo akrobata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mbz.hr/eng/arhiv/1981/ | title=Programme for 16.05.1981 | work=mbz.hr | publisher=[[Croatian Composers' Society]] | accessdate=2010-01-02 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608111945/http://www.mbz.hr/eng/arhiv/1981/ | archivedate=2010-06-08 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:25th Music Biennale Zagreb.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander García Düttmann]]'s lecture in the [[Mimara Museum]], 25th Music Biennale, April 2009]]
A concert by the [[Slovenia]]n [[avant-garde music]] band [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]] at the 1983 Biennale caused a huge scandal.&lt;ref name="theslovenian.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theslovenian.com/articles/campbell.htm | title=Laibach: Project and Performance Highlights: 1980-1989 | last=Campbell | first=Donald | work=theslovenian.com | date=February 2005 | accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="muzika.hr"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.muzika.hr/clanak/24835/interview/ivo-josipovic-predsjednik-glazbenik-volio-bih-uskrsnuti-the-beatlese-i-zasvirati-s-njima.aspx | title=Ivo Josipović, predsjednik glazbenik: "Volio bih uskrsnuti The Beatlese i zasvirati s njima" | date=26 January 2010 | work=muzika.hr | last1=Tučkar | first1=Zoran | last2=Blažević | first2=Krešimir | language=Croatian | accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of their music act, they reproduced speeches by the late Yugoslav president [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] while simultaneously displaying a [[pornographic film]].&lt;ref name="muzika.hr"/&gt; The show was eventually interrupted by the police,&lt;ref name="theslovenian.com"/&gt; and the Biennale once again came on the verge of being abolished.&lt;ref name="muzika.hr"/&gt; The festival's already exhausted art director [[Igor Kuljerić]] had a [[nervous breakdown]] and absconded to the island of [[Silba]].&lt;ref name="muzika.hr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://igorkuljeric.com/news.php?kat_id=139 | title=Igor Kuljerić - Timeline | work=igorkuljeric.com | accessdate=2010-02-09 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713004829/http://igorkuljeric.com/news.php?kat_id=139 | archivedate=2011-07-13 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 21st Biennale in 2001 lasted ten days, which was its longest duration to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vjesnik.hr/Pdf/2001%5C04%5C20%5C14A14.PDF | title=Biennale na velika vrata u treće tisućljeće | date=20 April 2001 | work=[[Vjesnik]] | last=Turkalj | first=Nenad | language=Croatian | format=PDF | accessdate=2010-01-02}}{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Biennale's 25th edition was held from 17 to 26 April 2009 at multiple venues, including [[Vatroslav Lisinski Concert Hall]], [[Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb|Croatian National Theatre]], [[Gavella Drama Theatre]], and [[Mimara Museum]].&lt;ref name="HRT"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hrt.hr/index.php?id=76&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=35711&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=90&amp;cHash=5114423b9c | title=25. muzički biennale Zagreb | date=17 April 2009 | work=hrt.hr | publisher=[[Croatian Radiotelevision]] | language=Croatian | accessdate=2009-12-28}}{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its theme was "Art &amp; Politics".&lt;ref name="Nacional 700"/&gt;

'''New Ways of Analyzing Variation (NWAV)''' is an annual [[academic conference]] in [[sociolinguistics]]. NWAV attracts researchers and students conducting [[Linguistics|linguistic]] scientific investigations into patterns of [[Variation (linguistics)|language variation]], the study of [[language change]] in progress, and the interrelationship between [[language]] and [[society]], including how language variation is shaped by and continually shape societal [[institution]]s, social and [[interpersonal relationship]]s, and individual and group [[Identity (social science)|identities]]. In 2011, the 40th New Ways of Analyzing Variation (NWAV 40) conference celebrated the special anniversary at its birthplace, [[Georgetown University]]. Most recently, [https://wp.nyu.edu/nwav47/ NWAV 47] was held at [[New York University]] in [[New York City, New York]], October 18–21, 2018; in 2019, [https://nwav48.uoregon.edu NWAV 48] will be held at the [[University of Oregon]] in [[Eugene, Oregon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1097">A '''pop-up exhibition''' is a temporary art event, less formal than a gallery or museum but more formal than private artistic showing of work.  The idea began in 2007 in [[New York City]] where space for exhibiting artistic work is very limited.&lt;ref name="CrosJolliffe2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hilary Du Cros|author2=Lee Jolliffe|title=The Arts and Events|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e7KuAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40|date=30 May 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-04141-0|pages=40–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the idea originated from New York City, pop-up exhibitions occur all around the world. A recent example is [[Banksy|Banksy's]] [[Dismaland]], which ran from August to September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2015/08/dismaland/|title = Welcome to Dismaland: A First Look at Banksy’s New Art Exhibition Housed Inside a Dystopian Theme Park|date = 20 August 2015|accessdate = 6 September 2015|website = Colossal|publisher = Christopher Jobson|last = Jobson|first = Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fourteenth appearance in this country of the celebrated New Orleans Ethiopian Serenaders LCCN2014635580.jpg|thumb|1847 poster for the Princess's Theatre]]
The '''Princess's Theatre''' or '''Princess Theatre''' was a theatre in [[Oxford Street]], [[London]]. The building opened in 1828 as the "Queen's Bazaar" and housed a [[diorama]] by [[Clarkson Stanfield]] and David Roberts. It was converted into a theatre and opened in 1836 as the Princess's Theatre, named for then [[Queen Victoria|Princess Victoria]] before her accession as queen.&lt;ref&gt;Thomason, p. 883.&lt;/ref&gt; After an unsuccessful series of [[promenade concert]]s, alterations were made on the interior, and the theatre was reopened on 26&amp;nbsp;December 1842 with [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s [[opera]] ''[[La sonnambula]]''. The theatre, by now under the management of [[John Medex Maddox]], presented operas and other entertainments, such as [[General Tom Thumb]].

The theatre is best remembered for [[Charles Kean]]'s Shakespeare revivals, beginning in 1849 and continuing for ten years.  Kean presented these in lavish and well-researched "authentic" productions&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.winthrop.edu/vorderbruegg/winthropweb/vitaindex/gilbert.html Bruegge, Andrew Vorder "W. S. Gilbert: Antiquarian Authenticity and Artistic Autocracy" (Associate Professor, Department Chair, Department of Theatre and Dance, Winthrop University).  Professor Bruegge presented this paper at the Victorian Interdisciplinary Studies Association of the Western United States annual conference in October 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5yPic5kyJ?url=http://faculty.winthrop.edu/vorderbruegg/winthropweb/vitaindex/gilbert.html |date=3 May 2011 }}, accessed 26 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  and also presented French drama.  [[Dion Boucicault]] became the theatre's leading actor, and [[Ellen Terry]] and [[Henry Irving]] got their starts at the theatre.  Thereafter, the theatre presented mainly melodrama.  [[H. J. Byron]] wrote a series of Christmas [[pantomime]]s for the theatre, beginning in 1859 with ''Jack the Giant Killer, or, Harlequin, King Arthur, and ye Knights of ye Round Table''&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;Lee, Amy Wai Sum. [http://whaleyween.com/Holly/DLB344_19thC_BritishDramatists/Byron.pdf "Henry J. Byron"]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Hong Kong Baptist University&lt;/ref&gt; and followed the next year by ''Robinson Crusoe, or Harlequin Friday and the King of the Caribee Islands!''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worc.ac.uk/victorian/victorianplays/Vol49viiRobinson.pdf Script for ''Robinson Crusoe, or Harlequin Friday'']{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (1860)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, [[Sefton Henry Parry|Sefton Parry]], recently returned from Cape Town, appeared as Cousin Joe in the farce ''The Rough Diamond.''&lt;ref&gt;''Leeds Intelligencer'' 19 September 1863 p.3&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1864, a particularly popular drama was presented at the theatre called ''The Streets of London''. The theatre was demolished and rebuilt in 1879–80.  After this, the theatre continued to present melodramas, including ''[[The Lights o' London]]'' (1881) and ''The Silver King'' (1882).

The theatre closed permanently in 1902 after its last success, ''[[Theodore Kremer|The Fatal Wedding]]'', and the building became a warehouse.  It was demolished in 1931 and replaced by a [[Woolworths Group|Woolworth]] store, and then subsequently by the [[Oxford Walk]] shopping centre.  The site is now the location of a sports store.

The '''Royal Opera House''', also known as the '''Royal Theatre''' ({{lang-mt|It-Teatru Rjal}}, {{lang-it|Teatro Reale}}), was an [[opera house]] and performing arts venue in [[Valletta]], [[Malta]]. It was designed by the English architect [[Edward Middleton Barry]] and was erected in 1866. In 1873 its interior was extensively damaged by fire but was eventually restored by 1877. The theatre received a direct hit from aerial bombing in 1942 during [[World War II]]. Prior to its destruction, it was one of the most beautiful and iconic buildings in Valletta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valletta's Royal Opera House, from glamour to rubble|url=http://themanwhowenttomalta.wordpress.com/2011/12/12/vallettas-royal-opera-house-from-glamour-to-rubble/|website=The Man Who Went To Malta|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104204802/http://themanwhowenttomalta.wordpress.com/2011/12/12/vallettas-royal-opera-house-from-glamour-to-rubble/|archivedate=4 January 2014|date=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several abandoned plans to rebuild the theatre, the ruins were redesigned by the Italian architect [[Renzo Piano]] and in 2013 it once again started functioning as a performance venue, called Pjazza Teatru Rjal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pjazzateatrurjal.com www.pjazzateatrurjal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Operahouse1935.jpg|thumb|The Opera House in 1935.]]

The design of the building was entrusted to [[Edward Middleton Barry]], the architect of [[Covent Garden Theatre]], and the classic design plan was completed by 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Borg|first=Malcolm|date=2001|title=British Colonial Architecture: Malta, 1800-1900|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=lZ1QAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=baroque+architecture+in+merchant+street+valletta&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Borsa||page=138|publisher=Publishers Enterprises Group|isbn=9789990903003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/malta/7697046/Maltese-anger-at-plans-to-rebuild-Valletta.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rix2015&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rix|first1=Juliet|title=Malta and Gozo|date=2015|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=9781784770259|page=118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WmKKCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA118#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original plans had to be altered because the sloping streets on the sides of the theatre had not been taken into consideration. This resulted in a terrace being added on the side of Strada Reale (nowadays Republic Street) designed by Maltese architects.

The building of the {{convert|206|ft|m}} by {{convert|112|ft|m}} site{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} started in 1862, after what was the ''Casa della Giornata'' was demolished. After four years, the Opera House, with a seating capacity of 1,095 and 200 standing, was ready for the official opening on 9 October 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Denaro, Victor F. (1959). [http://mhs.eu.pn/mh/19591.html Houses in Kingsway and Old Bakery Street, Valletta] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117014317/http://mhs.eu.pn/mh/19591.html |date=2015-11-17 }}. Melita historica. ''Journal of the Malta Historical Society''. 2 (4). p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre was not to last long; on 25 May 1873,&lt;ref&gt;Denaro, Victor F. (1959). [http://mhs.eu.pn/mh/19591.html Houses in Kingsway and Old Bakery Street, Valletta] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117014317/http://mhs.eu.pn/mh/19591.html |date=2015-11-17 }}. Melita historica. ''Journal of the Malta Historical Society''. 2 (4). p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; a mere six years after its opening, it was brought to a premature end by a fire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mhs.eu.pn/mh3/19902.html Architect Andrea Vassallo]. p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; The exterior of the theatre was undamaged but the interior stonework was calcified by the intense heat.

It was decided to rebuild the theatre, and after the issuing of tenders for the work and a lot of arguing whether the front had to be changed or not, the theatre was ready. On 11 October 1877, after nearly four and a half years from the fire, the theatre reopened with a performance of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s [[Aida]].

[[File:BombDamageMalta.jpg|thumb|Strada Reale in Valletta after an air raid. The ruins of the Opera House can be seen on the right.]]
Some 65 years later, tragedy struck the Royal Opera House again:

{{quote|On the evening of Tuesday, April 7, 1942, the theatre was devastated by ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' bombers. The next morning a people hardened by aerial bombing inspected the remains of their national theatre.... The [[portico]] and the auditorium were a heap of stones, the roof a gaping hole of twisted girders. The rear end starting half way from the [[colonnade]] was however intact.&lt;ref name="bonnicicassar"&gt;{{cite book| first1=Joseph | last1=Bonnici | first2=Michael | last2=Cassar | title=The Royal Opera House – Malta | publisher=[[Gutenberg Press]] | date=1990 | page=79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The remaining structures were levelled down as a safety precaution. There is a claim that German [[prisoner of war|prisoners-of-war]] in Malta offered to rebuild the theatre in 1946 with the Government declining due to [[Trade Union|Union]] pressure; the more likely reason was that hardly anyone of these prisoners of war could be expected to be qualified masons.

All that remained of the Opera House were the terrace and parts of the columns.

==Site ruins and reconstruction plans==
[[File:royalvalletta.jpg|thumb|left|The ruins of the Opera House, in 2006, with the interior used as a [[car park]]]]
Although the bombed site was cleared of much of the rubble and all of the remaining decorative sculpture, rebuilding was repeatedly postponed by successive post-War governments, in favour of reconstruction projects that were deemed to be more pressing.

In 1953 six renowned architects submitted designs for the new theatre. The Committee chose Zavellani-Rossi's project and recommended its acceptance by Government subject to certain alterations. The project ground to a halt on [[Labour Party (Malta)#Re-founding and return to government (1949–1958)|Labour]]'s re-election, contending that it was not in a position to spend so much money on a theatre when so many other projects needed attention. Although a provision of 280,000 [[Maltese lira|pounds]] for the reconstruction of the theatre had been made in the 1955-56 budget, these were never used. By 1957 the project had been shelved and after 1961 all references to the theatre in the country's development plans were omitted.

In the 1980s contact was made with the renowned architect [[Renzo Piano]] to design a building to be constructed on site as well as the rehabilitiation of the entrance of the city. [[Renzo Piano|Piano]] submitted the plans which were approved by the Government in 1990 but work never started probably through the controversies the plans generated. In 1996 the incoming Labour Government announced that reconstruction of the site into a commercial and cultural complex together with an underground car park would be Malta's millennium project. In the late 1990s the Maltese architect [[Richard England (architect)|Richard England]] was also commissioned to come up with plans for a cultural centre. Each time, controversies killed off all initiatives.

[[File:Malta - Valletta - Triq ir-Repubblika - Royal Opera + New Parliament Building 01 ies.jpg|thumb|left|Pjazza Teatru Rjal under construction.]]
In 2006 the government announced a proposal to redevelop the site for a dedicated House of Parliament, which by then was located in the former Armoury of the [[Grandmaster's Palace in Valletta]]. The proposal was not well received since it had always been assumed that the site would eventually be developed into something that would house a cultural institution, however Renzo Piano was again approached and started to work on new designs. The proposal was ostensibly shelved until after the [[Maltese general election, 2008|general elections of 2008]] and, on 1 December 2008, Prime Minister [[Lawrence Gonzi]] revived the proposal with a budget of €80 million. Piano dissuaded the Government from building a Parliament on site of the Opera House, instead planning a House of Parliament on present-day Freedom Square and a re-modelling of the [[City Gate (Malta)|city gate]]. Piano proposed an open-air theatre for the site.

The development of the theatre by Piano is the most controversial in its time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Architect|editor=David Felice|last=Mallia|first=Nicholas|title=Chalet|url=https://kamratalperiti.org/wp-content/uploads/tA037.pdf|publisher=Media Today|page=11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120061815/https://kamratalperiti.org/wp-content/uploads/tA037.pdf|archive-date=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government still went ahead with the plans and the open-air theatre was officially inaugurated on 8 August 2013. The theatre was named ''Pjazza Teatru Rjal'' after the original structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Valletta's open theatre officially inaugurated|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130808/local/vallettas-open-theatre-is-officially-inaugurated.481358|accessdate=4 January 2014|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name translates to Royal Theatre Square, but the venue is always referred to by its Maltese name, even when written about in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ameen|first1=Juan|title=Pjazza Teatru Rjal to host arts festival|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130629/local/Pjazza-Teatru-Rjal-to-host-arts-festival.475838|accessdate=15 April 2016|work=Times of Malta|date=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cryptography]], the '''S-1 block cipher''' was a [[block cipher]] posted in [[source code]] form on [[Usenet]] on 11 August 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title=this looked like it might be interesting |author=Anonymous|date=1995-08-09 |newsgroup=sci.crypt |message-id=40b50l$oa8@utopia.hacktic.nl |url=http://groups.google.com/group/sci.crypt/msg/68a25b11b28c6e8e?dmode=source |accessdate=2009-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although incorrect security markings immediately indicated a [[hoax]], there were several features of the code which suggested it might be leaked source code for the [[Skipjack (cipher)|Skipjack]] cipher, which was still [[classified information|classified]] at the time.

However once [[David A. Wagner|David Wagner]] had discovered a [http://groups.google.com/group/sci.crypt.research/browse_thread/thread/e4dd336ab5385cfb/a4acecc197ec93dc severe [[product defect|design flaw]]], involving the [[key schedule]] but not the underlying round function, it was generally accepted as being a hoax—but one with an astonishing amount of work behind it. [[Bruce Schneier]] noted that S-1 contained a feature never seen before in the open literature; a G-table that results in key and data dependent rotation of S-boxes to use in a given round [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sci.crypt/l4nsjVu27lU/LIycdmVxJZ0J]. When Skipjack was eventually declassified in 1998, it was indeed found to be totally unlike S-1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9042">The '''Sharm El Sheikh Summit of 2005''' took place on 8 February, when four [[Middle East]]ern leaders gathered at [[Sharm El Sheikh]], in the [[Sinai Peninsula]], in an effort to end the four-year [[Second Intifada|Al-Aqsa Intifada]]. The four leaders were [[Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Ariel Sharon]], [[President of the Palestinian Authority]] [[Mahmoud Abbas]], [[Egyptian President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]], and [[King Abdullah II]] of Jordan.

Sharon and Abbas explicitly undertook to cease all violence against each other's peoples, marking a formal end to the Al-Aqsa Intifada and to move on in the [[Road map for peace]] process. Sharon also agreed to release 900 [[Palestinian prisoners in Israel|Palestinian prisoners]] of the 7,500 being held at the time,&lt;ref name=Reinhardtp77&gt;{{cite book|title=The Road Map to Nowhere: Israel/Palestine Since 2003|author=[[Tanya Reinhart]]|publisher=Verso|year=2006|isbn= 9781844670765|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to withdraw from West Bank towns. However, the violence continued into the following years, though suicide bombings decreased significantly. By the spring of 2005, 500 of the prisoners had been released, but after [[Qassam rocket]] attacks on [[Sderot]] on 5 May, Sharon stopped the release of the remaining 400, saying the Palestinian Authority needs to rein in the militants.&lt;ref name=Drakulichp79&gt;{{cite book|title=A Global Agenda: Issues Before the 60th General Assembly of the United Nations|author=Angela Drakulich, United Nations Association of the United States of America|publisher=United Nations Publications|year=2005|isbn= 9781880632710|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nn41RSRpoaIC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=palestinian+prisoners+israel+1948#PPA79,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background to the summit==
The [[Second Intifada|Al-Aqsa Intifada]], which began in September 2000, left over 5,000 [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] and [[Israel]]i casualties and took extensive toll on both economies and societies. The cycle of violence persisted throughout this period, except for the short-lived [[Hudna]] in mid-2003. 

Neither side was willing to negotiate until there was a halt to violence. [[Yasser Arafat]], the man thought by many to have engineered the intifada and to have kept it alive, died in November 2004. The [[Palestinian presidential election, 2005|Palestinian presidential election]] to elect Arafat's successor was held on 9 January 2005 and confirmed [[Mahmoud Abbas]] as President of the [[Palestinian Authority]]. His initial efforts were to bring order to the anarchy of the Palestinian territories and halt attacks against Israel. [[Ariel Sharon]] changed his attitude towards negotiations and ordered a significant reduction of Israeli military activity in the Palestinian territories and took many measures to help Palestinian civilians. 

These trust-building steps, together with renewed security coordination between the two sides and the backing of the [[United States]], [[Jordan]] and [[Egypt]] led to agreement on holding of the summit.

==The summit==
The summit began with a series of meetings between Sharon and Mubarak, King Abdullah and Abbas. Later, all leaders except King Abdullah read statements reaffirming their commitment to continued efforts to stabilize the situation and to move on in the [[Road map for peace]] process. 

Sharon and Abbas explicitly included an intended cessation of all violent activity against each other's peoples in their closing statements,&lt;ref name=Abbas_Sharm&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4247327.stm |title=The full text of Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas's declaration of a ceasefire with the Israelis at the Sharm al-Sheikh summit |publisher=BBC News |date=8 February 2005 |accessdate=28 September 2014 |quote=We have agreed with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to stop all acts of violence against Israelis and Palestinians, wherever they are. ...

Sharon also agreed to release 900 [[Palestinian prisoners in Israel|Palestinian prisoners]] and to withdraw from West Bank towns.

==Media coverage post-summit==
A 2007 report entitled "Quiet, We're Disengaging! Israeli Media Coverage of the Tense Ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian Authority Following the Sharm El Sheikh Understandings" by the Israeli media monitoring NGO [https://web.archive.org/web/20090628024544/http://www.keshev.org.il/siteEn/default.asp Keshev] (trans. "Awareness"):&lt;ref name="keshev"&gt;{{cite web|title=Keshev – Keshev  Publications &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt;|url=http://www.keshev.org.il/siteEn/FullNews.asp?NewsID=125&amp;CategoryID=9)|work=|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ioW9ivp9?url=http://www.keshev.org.il/siteEn/FullNews.asp?NewsID=125&amp;CategoryID=9)|archivedate=2009-08-06|deadurl=no|accessdate=2009-08-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quote|the Israeli media played down Israeli violations of the Sharm El Sheikh understandings and highlighted Palestinian violations.

[[Criticism of Israel]], by Palestinian, Israeli and international actors, appeared infrequently and always on the margins of the news. Criticism of Palestinians, by contrast, was covered profusely. In general, policy questions concerning Israeli violations of the ceasefire received secondary attention, as the media coverage mainly focused on the disengagement plan.

These patterns of coverage and editing, which broadly covered each Palestinian attack on Israelis, provided media consumers with a clear and unequivocal situation report: Israel is abiding by its commitments and in the vast majority of cases it is not endangering the ceasefire. The [[Palestinian Authority]], on the other hand, is consistently breaking its commitments and its leader, [[Abu Mazen]] [Abbas], does not want or cannot keep the ceasefire for any length of time. The ceasefire is therefore bound to collapse – and the Palestinians bear exclusive responsibility for this.&lt;ref name="Keshev 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keshev.org.il/siteEn/FullNews.asp?NewsID=87&amp;CategoryID=9 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721144035/http://www.keshev.org.il/siteEn/FullNews.asp?NewsID=87&amp;CategoryID=9 |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The report also notes:
{{quote|In this sense, the Israeli media continues to operate according to the prevailing established point of view, according to which the Palestinian Authority is not a "partner". This perspective also forms the basis for the unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip.&lt;ref name="keshev 3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keshev.org.il/FileUpload/KESHEV_2nd_Report_ENG.pdf |title=Archived copy: Keshev Report: Quiet, We’re Disengaging!

{{One source|date=July 2018}}
An '''[[independence referendum]]''' was held in [[South Ossetia]] on 19 January 1992.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=ge011992 Süd-Ossetien (Georgien), 19. Januar 1992 : Unabhängigkeit von Georgien und Anschluss an Russland] Direct Democracy&lt;/ref&gt; The voters answered the questions: "Do you agree that South Ossetia should be an independent country?" and "Do you agree with the South Ossetian parliament solution of September 1, 1991 on reunion with [[Russia]]?"&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; The proposals were approved by 99.9% of voters.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

==Background==
On November 1989 the Supreme Soviet of the [[South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast]] voted for conversion to the status of an [[Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]. However, the [[Cabinet of Georgia (country)|Georgian government]] revoked the territory's autonomous status on 1 December 1990. Although Georgia boycotted the [[Soviet Union referendum, 1991|March 1991 referendum]] on creating a renewed Soviet federation, South Ossetian voters took part. When Georgia held an [[Georgian independence referendum, 1991|independence referendum]] later in the month, it was boycotted in South Ossetia.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

On 28 November 1991 the South Ossetia government declared independence.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4208">In [[United States law|American law]], [[Scots law]] and under the law of some English-speaking [[Commonwealth]] nations, '''subornation of perjury''' is the [[crime]] of persuading a person to commit [[perjury]], the swearing of a false oath to tell the truth in a legal proceeding, whether spoken or written. The term ''subornation of perjury'' further describes the circumstance wherein an [[lawyer|attorney at law]] causes a client to lie under oath or allows another party to lie under oath.&lt;ref name="NAS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.gov.uk/guides/legalTerms.asp|title=Scots Legal Terms and Offences Libelled|publisher=National Archives of Scotland|accessdate=19 May 2012|location=Edinburgh|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530035318/http://www.nas.gov.uk/guides/legalTerms.asp|archivedate=30 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garner, Bryan A., Ed., ''Black's Law Dictionary'' 7th Ed. West Group, St. Paul Minnesota, 1999, p. 1440.&lt;/ref&gt;

In American federal law, Title {{United States Code|18|1622}} provides:

{{quote|Whoever procures another to commit any perjury is guilty of subornation of perjury, and shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.}}

In California law, per the State bar Code,&lt;ref&gt;''In re Rivas'' (1989) 49 Cal.3d 794, 263 California Reporter. 654, 781 P.2d 946&lt;/ref&gt; the subornation of perjury constitutes an act of "[[moral turpitude]]" on the part of the attorney, and thus is cause for his or her disbarment, or for the suspension of his or her license to practice law.&lt;ref&gt;California Business &amp; Professions Code §6102(a)&lt;/ref&gt;

In legal practice, the condition of suborning perjury applies to a lawyer who presents either [[testimony]] or an [[affidavit]], or both, either to a [[judge]] or to a [[jury]], which the attorney knows to be [[Materiality (law)|materially]] false, and not factual. In [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] and in [[criminal law]], the attorney's knowledge that the testimony is materially false must rise above mere [[suspicion (emotion)|suspicion]] to what an attorney would reasonably have believed in the circumstances of the matter discussed in the testimony. Hence, the attorney cannot be [[willful blindness|wilfully blind]] to the fact that his or her witness is giving false, perjurious testimony.

An attorney who encourages a witness to give false testimony is suborning [[perjury]], a crime punished either with formal disciplinary action, [[disbarment]], jail or a combination thereof. A false statement by an attorney in court also is a crime similar to subornation of perjury and is punished accordingly. In the professional conduct of an attorney at law, there is a fine delineation between assisting a witness to recall events and encouraging him or her to give materially false testimony. The practice of ″horse shedding the witness″ (rehearsing testimony) is an example of such perjurious criminal conduct by an attorney, which  is depicted in the true-crime novel ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'' (1958), by [[John D. Voelker|Robert Traver]] and in the eponymous film (Otto Preminger, 1959), about a rape-and-murder case wherein are explored the [[Legal ethics|ethical]] and legal problems inherent to the subornation of perjury.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kjwVASsTUm0C&amp;pg=PA445&amp;lpg=PA445&amp;dq=%22horse+shedding%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=DnNsSClpMd&amp;sig=rGf9tg3HTgWmCNOBBC6u_4IsBAA#PPA445,M1 “Horse shedding” term, ''Quote it Completely!''

'''Taylor Opera House''' was an [[opera]] house in [[Trenton, New Jersey]]. It was the city's first theater, and was founded by [[John Taylor (Taylor Ham)|John Taylor]], creator of Pork Roll and one of Trenton's leading citizens.   The building first opened March 18, 1867 at 18 S. Broad Street.  A historical marker was placed on the site after its demolition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=3991 Historical Marker Database: Taylor Opera House]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theater presented the major speakers and performers of the day, including [[Mark Twain]], [[Ethel Barrymore]], and [[George M. Cohan]], and played host to political conventions, Bible conferences, musical revues and local meetings and events.  It hosted the inaugurations of Governor [[George B. McClellan]] in 1877, and [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1910,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trentonhistory.org/Documents/Manuscript1900.htm Trenton Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Fairman Fielder|James F.

Accessed December 29, 2007. "At midnight to-morrow New Jersey will have a new Governor, James F. Fielder of Jersey City, but he will not take the oath of office until Tuesday at noon.... The Legislature will assemble at the State House shortly before 12 o'clock on Tuesday and then proceed to the Taylor Opera House."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Walter Evans Edge]] in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F01E0D6163AE433A25756C1A9679C946696D6CF "EDGE IN OFFICE TOMORROW.; Inaugural in Opera House;-Parade and Social Affairs."], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 15, 1917. Accessed December 29, 2007. "Everything is ready for the inauguration here Tuesday of Walter E. Edge of Atlantic City, Republican, as Governor of New Jersey. The induction ceremonies will be held in the Taylor Opera House."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, it was converted into a movie and vaudeville palace known as '''Keith's Capitol Theatre'''; after later sales it was renamed the '''RKO International'''.

The theater was razed by its next door neighbor (the [[Trenton Saving Fund Society]]) to create a parking lot in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Modica, Glenn R.

'''''The Trainer''''' is a play by David Wilson and Anne Aylor (with writing contributions from composer [[Keith Burstein]]).

==Description==

''The Trainer'' is a multi-media play set in a posh gym in the basement of a gentlemen’s club, punctuated with excerpts from the (real life) opera ''[[Manifest Destiny (opera)|Manifest Destiny]]'', news footage from [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and inane breakfast TV programmes. It delivers a darkly comical comment on the justice system, while at the same time highlighting the struggles taking place both in Gaza and in the UK and other Western countries to defend humanity from barbarism.

==Synopsis==

The play explores the love story between a British Jew, Josh, and his Palestinian fiancée Taghreed (who works as a fitness trainer at the gym in a London gentlemen's club). Their story is interwoven with a predominantly fact-based account of the real-life bankruptcy of British composer [[Keith Burstein]] (as the result of a libel trial relating to issues of alleged promotion of terrorism) as told by the attendees of the gym in which Taghreed works (all of whom happen to be Judges of the Court of Appeal).

==Background==

After [[Keith Burstein]] and [[Dic Edwards]]’ opera ''[[Manifest Destiny (opera)|Manifest Destiny]]'' was performed at the [[2005 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] the ''[[Evening Standard|London Evening Standard]]'' newspaper published a review which claimed that the opera glorified terrorism. Burstein subsequently took the newspaper to court on the grounds that this claim put him at risk under the terms of the Terrorism Acts of 2005 and 2006. The High Court found in his favour and granted him the right to take the case to a trial by jury. However, this decision was reversed in the Court of Appeal, which ordered Burstein to pay the legal costs of the ''[[Evening Standard|London Evening Standard]]'' (some £70,000). In consequence, Burstein was bankrupted and the Official Receiver seized possession of all of his works (including ''[[Manifest Destiny (opera)|Manifest Destiny]]'').

The court case and its aftermath inspired David Wilson and Anne Aylor (in collaboration with Burstein) to write ''The Trainer''. The play covers a fictionalised version of the events of the trial, in parallel with a separate plot strand similar to one used in ''[[Manifest Destiny (opera)|Manifest Destiny]]'' (that of an educated Palestinian woman with a Jewish lover, driven towards acts of violence in response to the state violence demonstrated in the Middle Eastern conflicts of the late 20th and early 21st centuries).

==Performance history==

''The Trainer'' premiered at Oxford House, London, in March 2009. Actors involved included [[Corin Redgrave]], [[Tim Pigott-Smith]] and Lebanese-American actress Jana Zeineddine.

Following rewrites, ''The Trainer'' was revived for the fundraising evening ''Two Plays For Gaza'' on May 21, 2009 at the [[Hackney Empire]] theatre in London, UK (which also featured a performance of [[Caryl Churchill]]'s play ''[[Seven Jewish Children]]'', talks by [[Tony Benn]] and Ben Griffin, and music from [[Reem Kelani]] and hip-hop poet [[Lowkey]].) For this production, actors [[Janie Dee]] and [[Roger Lloyd-Pack]] joined the cast.

Both productions were directed by Tom Platten.

'''Tiger Conference''' is an annual [[conference]], founded in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://labs.kyivpost.com/tiger2017/6th_TIGER_Conference.pdf|title=Tiger Conference Chronology|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Kyiv Post]]. The conference brings together more than 400 [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] and world leaders, top managers, top executives of leading companies, media, parliamentarians, diplomats and opinion leaders to exchange ideas about the future of [[Ukraine]] in a changing world.

Since 2016, Kyiv Post has launched a "Top 30 Under 30" [[List of awards|award ceremony]], selected by jury on the basis of nominations from readers and business community. This ceremony completes the conference.

As of 2018, the Tiger Conference has become an independent discussion platform for discussing the strongest challenges of Ukraine.

== Format ==
The event holds 4 panel discussions, speeches delivered by key speakers, 2 sectional meetings and the award ceremony of the 30 most successful young Ukrainians "TOP30UNDER30".

== Top 30 Under 30 ==
[[File:Logo 30UNDER30 Ukraine.png|thumb|Official logo of the nomination]]
The Top 30 Under 30 [[nomination]] is a popular practice among international editions, research organizations such as [[Forbes]]. In Ukraine, the award was launched in 2016 by [[Kyiv Post|KyivPost]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tiger.kyivpost.com/page1414128.html|title=6th Tiger Conference|website=tiger.kyivpost.com|accessdate=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in partnership with the [[Victor Pinchuk Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pinchukfund.org/ua/news/17090/|title=Фонд Віктора Пінчука - Новини|website=pinchukfund.org|accessdate=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winners of the nomination must be a [[Citizenship|citizen]] of Ukraine who has not yet reached the age of 30 years and have outstanding achievements in the fields of [[education]], [[health care]], [[business]], [[science]], [[medicine]], social activities, [[art]] and other fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prostir.ua/?grants=nominatsiya-top-30-under-30-vid-kyiv-post-tryvaje-pryjom-zayavok|title=Номінація TOP 30 UNDER 30 від Kyiv Post – триває прийом заявок {{!}} Громадський простір|website=www.prostir.ua|language=uk|accessdate=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award is realized in a crystal engraving [[Figurine|statuette]].
