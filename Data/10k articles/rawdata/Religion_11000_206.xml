'''''A Stranger in Tibet''''' is the story of [[Ekai Kawaguchi]] and his travels in [[Tibet]] and [[Nepal]] at the turn of the 20th century. Kawaguchi, a [[Zen Buddhism|Zen Buddhist]] [[monk]], was the first [[Japan]]ese explorer to enter Nepal, in 1897, and Tibet, in 1900. His goal was to find ancient copies of [[sanskrit]] documents related to Buddhism. Since Tibet was closed to foreigners at that time, Kawaguchi travelled disguised as a Chinese monk. The book is a combination biography, travel book and history of the region, and also explains differences in the beliefs and practices of different schools of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://fionnchu.blogspot.jp/2011/10/scott-berrys-stranger-in-tibet-book.html| author=John L. Murphy| title=Scott Berry's ''A Stranger in Tibet'': Book Review| publisher=Blogtrotter| date=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote| text="...ultimately, Zen came to represent the antithesis of [[Tantric Buddhism]] with its elaborate secret doctrines and equally complex artistic tradition. Tantric Buddhists tend to offer great respect to images and paintings, while a Zen master once made a point of burning a statue of the Buddha to keep warm. As much as Kawaguchi might at times disagree with certain aspects of Zen, particularly its aversion to book learning, the very fact that he came from a tradition so far removed from Tibet's Tantrism seemed to put him on a collision course with that country right from the beginning."| sign=''A Stranger in Tibet''

'''[[Arya Samaj]]''' ([[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|ārya samāja}}'' {{lang|sa|आर्य समाज}} "[[Arya]] Society")  is a [[Hindu reform movement]] in [[Mauritius]]. Established in 1911, the Arya Paropkarini Sabha was officially registered in 1913. Since its creation Arya Samaj has had a great influence on the [[religious]], [[social]], [[educational]] and [[political]] lives of the people of [[Indian people|Indian]] origin on the island. It has endeavoured to uphold the principles and ideals set forth by [[Maharishi Dayanand]] and his reformist movement. Some of the more notable ideals are women parity and free access to education. It has provided [[Hindus]] with a choice of progressive [[Hinduism]], has promoted education with particular emphasis on [[Hindi]] and established [[orphanage]]s, [[primary school]]s, [[college]]s and [[tertiary institution]].&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aryasabhamauritius.com/?q=node/6 |title=The Arya Sabha Mauritius |publisher=aryasabhamauritius.com |accessdate=11 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074718/http://aryasabhamauritius.com/?q=node%2F6 |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The teachings of [[Arya Samaj]] was first introduced to [[Mauritius]] in 1897 by a group soldiers from the British Indian Army based there. On their departure in 1902, they left a copy of ''[[Satyarth Prakash]]'' and ''[[Sanskar Vidhi]]'' which became an inspiration for the establishment of the first Arya Samaj at [[Curepipe]] Road in 1903 by Bekarilal Singh, Lala Khemlall and Goorooparsad Duljeet. The trio were concerned at the deteriorating situation of the [[Hindu]] community in Mauritius, and despite early setback the Arya Samaj soon gained popular support.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aryasabhamauritius.com/?q=node/9 |title=History of Arya Samaj Movement in Mauritius |publisher=aryasabhamauritius.com |accessdate=11 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041523/http://aryasabhamauritius.com/?q=node%2F9 |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of [[Manilal Doctor]] in 1907 provided impetus to the movement. Manilal, a lawyer by profession, published a regular [[Hindi]] magazine for the Arya Samaj. On 8 May 1911, another Arya Samaj was formed in [[Port Louis]]. The Samajs then combined to form the Arya Pratinidhi Sabha of Mauritius. The arrival of Chiranjiva Bharadwaj on 15 December 1911 provided further impetus to the Arya Samaj movement in Mauritius. Under his guidance Arya Samajs were established at places where Indians had settled in large numbers, such as [[Vacoas]], [[Triolet]], [[Labourdonnais]], [[Pamplemousses]] and [[Rivière des anguilles]]. He conducted evening [[Hindi]] classes and toured villages to spread the message of the [[Vedas]]. Following opposition to the registration of the ''Arya Pratinidhi Sabha'' by the Government, Bharadwaj registered the ''Arya Paropkarini Sabha'' in 1912 with headquarters in Port Louis where a new building was constructed.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arya_Samaj_in_Mauritius&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1
The Arya Samaj sent young men to [[India]] to be trained as preachers and organised preachers from India to visit Mauritius. On such preacher was Swami Swantantranand who arrived in Mauritius in 1914. He further promoted the learning of Hindi and improved the ''Arya Patrika'', a newspaper in Hindi which was the voice of the Arya Samaj.  He returned to India in 1916 with Arya Samj well established and his work was furthered by Pandit Kashinath Kistoe, who had been sent to India for religious training. Kistoe took part in public debates with the orthodox Hindus but his greatest contribution was the establishment of Hindi schools. In 1924, the Arya Vedic School was established and subsequently two other primary schools were established. The DAV College of Port Louis was also established. Another preacher, Swami Vijayanand Saraswati arrived in February 1926 and used the latest audio visual aids to help with his lectures. He organised village processions and started ''shuddhi'' (conversion) ceremonies.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

== Splits with the Arya Samaj ==
In 1927 another Arya Samaj body, known as the ''Arya Pratinidhi Sabha'' was formed, supported by some of the veterans of the Arya Samaj. The new body obtained recognition from the ''[[Sarvadeshik Arya Pratinidhi Sabha]]'' (World Council of Arya Samaj) in [[New Delhi]] and grew popular. The fiftieth anniversary of the death of [[Swami Dayanand]] was celebrated in 1933 separately by the two Arya Samaj organisations. In 1934, another group broke away from the ''Paropkarni Sabha'' and formed the ''Arya Ravi Ved Pracharini Sabha''. Despite these divisions, the work of Arya Samaj, particularly in promoting Vedic teachings and the Hindi language, continued until 1950 when the ''Sarvadeshik Arya Pratinidhi Sabha'' sent Swami Swantantranand Saraswati to restore unity by diplomacy. After protracted negotiations the ''Arya Paropkarini Sabha'' and the ''Arya Pratinidhi Sabha'' agreed to merge to form the ''Arya Sabha Mauritius'', but the ''Arya Ravi Ved Pracharini Sabha'' remained a separate body. Swami Swantantranand Saraswati returned to India and at the first election of the executive committee of the new Sabha all the former members of the ''Arya Pratinidhi Sabha'' lost their seats. They then reconstituted the ''Arya Pratinidhi Sabha'' in 1954. ''Sarvadeshik Arya Pratinidhi Sabha'' intervened once again and sent Swami Dhruvanand Saraswati who managed to persuade the ''Arya Pratinidhi Sabha'' to merge with the ''Arya Sabha Mauritius'' in 1958. In 1970, the ''Arya Sabha Mauritius'' and the ''Arya Ravi Ved Pracharini Sabha'' jointly celebrated the sixtieth anniversary of the establishment of Arya Samaj in Mauritius.

== Promotion of education ==
The Arya Samaj vigorously promoted the teaching of [[Hindi]] and the first Hindi school was opened by the Arya Samaj in Mauritius on 18 July 1918. Gradually other subjects were introduced and the school became a government-aided institution. In 1920 there were 75 Hindi schools in Mauritius and following pressure from the Arya Samaj, [[languages of Asia|Asian languages]] were included in the curriculum of schools in Mauritius. The teaching of Hindi gained impetus when another Aryan Vedic School was established in 1938. A teacher training school for Hindi teachers was also established. Various Arya Samajs conduct three hundred evening Hindi schools at both primary and secondary level. The Arya Samaj is working with other Indian organisations to pressure the Government to include the teaching of Asian languages in secondary schools. The establishment of D.A.V. College by the Arya Sabha Mauritius on 11 January 1965, satisfied some of the need for Hindi education at secondary level.

== Women and Arya Samaj ==
The Arya Samaj believes in providing equal opportunity to women and the first steps in this direction was taken in Mauritius in 1912, when a women's association was formed in [[Vacoas]] to promote education among women. In 1931, a ''Mahila Mandal'' (Women's Association) was formed in [[Port Louis]] on the initiative of the ''Arya Pratinidhi Sabha''. In 1933 a conference for women was held, attended by over five hundred women from all parts of Mauritius. The M''ahila Mandal'' held a conference in Port Louis in 1965 and again in 1970. At present there are fifty ''Mahila Sabhas'' in Mauritius, which encourage vedic prayer, provide education and encourage women writers.

== Other activities ==
In 1967 the ''Arya Sabha of Mauritius'' established the ''Arya Yuvak Sangh'' (Arya Youth Union) to promote Indian culture amongst Indian youth. There are twenty branches and conferences are held regularly.

The Arya Samaj also runs an orphanage, established in 1940.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3283">In [[Zoroastrian]] mythology, '''Axtya''', also spelt '''Akhtya''' or '''Axt''' ({{lang-ae|axtya}}, {{lang-pal|Axt}}), is an evil sorcerer and an opponent of the religion,{{sfn|Kanga|2011}} known for killing those who were not able to answer his [[Riddle contest|riddles]].{{sfn|Dhalla|1938|p=137}} There is a mention of him in the [[Avesta]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Yasht|Yt.]] 5.81–82&lt;/ref&gt; where the hero Yōišta of the Fryāna family (Middle Persian: ''{{lang|pal|Yōšt-ī Friyān}}'')&lt;!--Dhalla, p. 137 has it as Yoisht-i Fryana--&gt; performs a sacrifice to the goddess [[Aredvi Sura Anahita]], who grants him the boon of being able to answer Axtya's 99 questions. This story is elaborated at greater length in the mediaeval&lt;ref&gt;The main manuscript that the English translation was made from, dates from the 14th century {{harv|Haug|West|1872|p=v}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pahlavi literature|Pahlavi]] text ''{{lang|pal-Latn|Mādayān ī Yōšt ī Friyān}}''. There Axtya threatens to destroy a certain city unless a righteous man comes out and solves his riddles. Yōšt steps forward for this task, and with some divine assistance manages to answer all of Axtya's 33 questions, after which he asks three questions of his own. Unable to answer them, Axtya seeks help from [[Ahriman]], who refuses to reveal the answers. Axtya then admits defeat and is ritually slain by Yosht. This story is likely to be of an [[Proto-Indo-European society|Indo-European]] origin as there are broad parallels in [[Nordic mythology]], particularly in the wisdom contest between [[Odin]] and the giant [[Vafþrúðnir]] in the [[Vafþrúðnismál]] poem of the Poetic Edda, as well as the contest described in chapter 10 of the 13th-century [[Hervarar Saga]].{{sfn|Hultgård|2009|pp=537–38}}

'''Bufotenin''' ('''5-HO-DMT''', bufotenine) is a [[tryptamine]] related to the [[neurotransmitter]] [[serotonin]].  It is an [[alkaloid]] found in the skin of some species of [[Psychoactive toad|toad]]s; in [[mushrooms]], higher [[plants]], and [[mammals]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=10257 CID 10257.] ''[[PubChem]].'' Accessed on May 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name bufotenin originates from the toad genus ''[[Bufo]]'', which includes several species of [[psychoactive toad]]s, most notably ''[[Incilius alvarius]]'', that [[secrete]] [[bufotoxin]]s from their [[parotoid gland]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?query_src=aw_lists_soundInclude_&amp;where-genus=Bufo&amp;where-species=alvarius Bufo Alvarius.] ''AmphibiaWeb.'' Accessed on May 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Bufotenin is similar in chemical structure to the [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]]s [[psilocin|psilocin (4-HO-DMT)]], [[5-MeO-DMT]], and [[dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], chemicals which also occur in some of the same fungus, plant, and animal species as bufotenin. The [[psychoactive drug|psychoactivity]] of bufotenin has been disputed, though recent studies suggest it is similar in nature to [[5-MeO-DMT]].{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}

==Nomenclature==
Bufotenin (bufotenine) is also known by the chemical names 5-hydroxy-''N'',''N''-dimethyltryptamine (5-HO-DMT), ''N'',''N''-dimethyl-5-hydroxytryptamine, dimethyl serotonin, and mappine.&lt;ref name="dea"&gt;{{cite web |title = DEA Drug Scheduling|publisher = U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration|url = http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/scheduling.html|accessdate = 2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bufotenin was first isolated from toad skin, and named by the Austrian chemist Handovsky at the [[Czech Technical University in Prague|University of Prague]] during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=chilton&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chilton WS, Bigwood J, Jensen RE |year=1979 |title=Psilocin, bufotenine and serotonin: historical and biosynthetic observations |journal=J Psychedelic Drugs |volume=11 |issue=1–2 |pages=61–9 |pmid=392119 |doi=10.1080/02791072.1979.10472093}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of bufotenine was first confirmed in 1934 by [[Heinrich Wieland]]’s laboratory in Munich, and the first reported synthesis of bufotenine was by Toshio Hoshino and Kenya Shimodaira in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Toads===
{{see also|Psychoactive toad}}
Bufotenin is a chemical constituent in the poison and eggs of several species of toads belonging to the genus ''Bufo'', but most notably in the [[Colorado River toad]] (''Bufo alvarius'') as it is the only toad species in which bufotenin is present in large enough quantities for a psychoactive effect. Extracts of toad venom, containing bufotenin and other [[Bioactive compound|bioactive]] compounds, have been used in some traditional medicines such as ''ch’an su'' (probably derived from ''[[Bufo gargarizans]]''), which has been used medicinally for centuries in China.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt;

The toad was "recurrently depicted in [[Mesoamerican]] art,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kennedy AB |title=Ecce Bufo: The Toad in Nature and in Olmec Iconography |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=23 |pages=273–90 |year=1982 |doi=10.1086/202831 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which some authors have interpreted as indicating that the effects of ingesting ''Bufo'' secretions have been known in Mesoamerica for many years; however, others doubt that this art provides sufficient "ethnohistorical evidence" to support the claim.&lt;ref name=davis&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Davis W, Weil A |year=1992 |title=Identity of a New World Psychoactive Toad |journal=Ancient Mesoamerica |volume=3 |pages=51–9 |doi=10.1017/s0956536100002297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to bufotenine, ''Bufo'' venoms also contain [[digoxin]]-like [[cardiac glycoside]]s, and ingestion of the venom can be fatal. Ingestion of ''Bufo'' toad venom and eggs by humans has resulted in several reported cases of poisoning,&lt;ref name=hitt&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM198606053142320 |vauthors=Hitt M, Ettinger DD |year=1986 |title=Toad toxicity |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=314 |issue=23 |pages=1517–8 |pmid=3702971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ragonesi&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ragonesi DL |year=1990 |title=The boy who was all hopped up |journal=Contemporary Pediatrics |volume=7 |pages=91–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brubacher&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brubacher JR, Ravikumar PR, Bania T, Heller MB, Hoffman RS |year=1996 |title=Treatment of toad venom poisoning with digoxin-specific Fab fragments |journal=Chest |volume=110 |issue=5 |pages=1282–8 |doi=10.1378/chest.110.5.1282 |pmid=8915235}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which resulted in death.&lt;ref name=brubacher/&gt;&lt;ref name=godwa&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gowda RM, Cohen RA, Khan IA |year=2003 |title=Toad venom poisoning: resemblance to digoxin toxicity and therapeutic implications |journal=Heart |volume=89  |issue=4 |pages=e14 |doi=10.1136/heart.89.4.e14 |pmid=12639891 |pmc=1769273}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lever, Christopher |title=The Cane Toad: The History and Ecology of a Successful Colonist |publisher=Westbury Academic &amp; Scientific Publishing |year=2001 |isbn=1-84103-006-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary reports indicate that bufotenine-containing toad venom has been used as a [[street drug]]; that is, as a supposed [[aphrodisiac]] (it is ''not'' an aphrodisiac but definitely ''is'' a lethal poison&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigues, R.J.

&lt;/ref&gt;), ingested orally in the form of ''ch’an su'',&lt;ref name=brubacher/&gt; and as a psychedelic, by smoking or orally ingesting ''Bufo'' toad venom or dried ''Bufo'' skins. The use of ''chan'su'' and ''love stone'' (a related toad venom preparation used as an aphrodisiac in the [[West Indies]]) has resulted in several cases of poisoning and at least one death.&lt;ref name=brubacher/&gt;&lt;ref name=cdc&gt;{{cite journal |author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) |year=1995 |title=Deaths associated with a purported aphrodisiac—New York City, February 1993 – May 1995 |journal=MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep |volume=44 |issue=46 |pages=853–5, 861 |pmid=7476839 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00039633.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of orally ingesting toad venom has been referred to in popular culture and in the scientific literature as toad licking and has drawn media attention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6376594 The Dog Who Loved to Suck on Toads.] ''[[NPR]].''

Bufotenin is also present in the skin secretion of three arboreal hylid frogs of the genus ''[[Osteocephalus]]'' (''[[Osteocephalus taurinus]]'', ''[[Osteocephalus oophagus]]'', and ''[[Osteocephalus langsdorfii]]'') from the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]] and Atlantic [[rain forests]].&lt;ref name=costa&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Costa TO, Morales RA, Brito JP, Gordo M, Pinto AC, Bloch C Jr |year=2005 |title=Occurrence of bufotenin in the Osteocephalus genus (Anura: Hylidae) |journal=Toxicon |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=371–5 |pmid=16054186 |doi=10.1016/j.toxicon.2005.02.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Anadenanthera'' seeds===
Bufotenin is a constituent of the [[seeds]] of ''[[Anadenanthera colubrina]]'' and ''[[Anadenanthera peregrina]]'' trees. Anadenanthera seeds have been used as an ingredient in psychedelic [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] preparations by indigenous cultures of the Caribbean, Central and South America.&lt;ref name="ISBN 0789026422"&gt;{{cite book |author1=David B. Repke |author2=Constantino Manuel Torres |title=Anadenanthera: visionary plant of ancient South America |publisher=Haworth Herbal Press |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=0-7890-2642-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other sources===
Bufotenin has been identified as a component in the latex of the takini (''[[Brosimum]] acutifolium'') tree, which is used as a psychedelic by South American shamans,&lt;ref name=gaillard&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moretti C, Gaillard Y, Grenand P, Bévalot F, Prévosto JM |year=2006 |title=Identification of 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (bufotenine) in takini (Brosimumacutifolium Huber subsp. acutifolium C.C.

==Pharmacology==

===Uptake and elimination===
In rats, [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]]ly administered bufotenin (1–100 μg/kg) distributes mainly to the [[lungs]], [[heart]], and [[blood]], and to a much lesser extent, the [[brain]] ([[hypothalamus]], [[brain stem]], [[striatum]], and [[cerebral cortex]]) and [[liver]]. It reaches peak concentrations at 1 hour and is nearly completely eliminated within 8 hours.&lt;ref name=fuller&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fuller RW, Snoddy HD, Perry KW |year=1995 |title=Psilocin Tissue distribution, metabolism and effects of bufotenine administered to rats |journal=Neuropharmacology |volume=34 |issue=7 |pages=799–804 |doi=10.1016/0028-3908(95)00049-C |pmid=8532147}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, [[intravenous]] administration of bufotenin results in [[excretion]] of (70%) of injected drug in the form of [[5-HIAA]], an [[endogenous]] [[metabolite]] of serotonin, while roughly 4% is eliminated unmetabolized in the urine. Orally administered bufotenine undergoes extensive [[first-pass metabolism]] by the enzyme [[monoamine oxidase]].

===Lethal dose===
The acute toxicity ({{LD50}}) of bufotenin in rodents has been estimated at 200 to 300&amp;nbsp;mg/kg. Death occurs by respiratory arrest.&lt;ref name="ISBN 0789026422"/&gt; In April 2017 a South Korean man died of bufotenin poisoning after consuming [[Asiatic toad|toads]] that had been mistaken as edible [[Chinese edible frog|Asian bullfrogs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = South Korean man dies after eating toads | date = 21 April 2017 | work = BBC | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39665192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects in humans===

====Fabing &amp; Hawkins (1955)====
In 1955, Fabing and Hawkins administered bufotenin intravenously at doses of up to 16&amp;nbsp;mg to prison inmates at Ohio State Penitentiary.&lt;ref name=fabing&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fabing HD, Hawkins JR |year=1956 |title=Intravenous bufotenine injection in the human being |journal=Science |volume=123 |issue=3203 |pages=886–7 |doi=10.1126/science.123.3203.886 |pmid=13324106}}&lt;/ref&gt; A troubling toxic blood circulation effect causing a purpling of the face was seen in these tests.

A subject given 1&amp;nbsp;mg reported “a tight feeling in the chest” and prickling “as if he had been jabbed by needles.” This was accompanied by a “fleeting sensation of pain in both thighs and a mild nausea.” &lt;ref name=fabing/&gt;

Another subject given 2&amp;nbsp;mg reported “tightness in his throat”. He had tightness in the stomach, tingling in pretibial areas, and developed a purplish hue in the face indicating blood circulation problems. He vomited after 3 minutes.&lt;ref name=fabing/&gt;

Another subject given 4&amp;nbsp;mg complained of “chest oppression” and that “a load is pressing down from above and my body feels heavy.” The subject also reported “numbness of the entire body” and “a pleasant Martini feeling-my body is taking charge of my mind”. The subject reported he saw red spots passing before his eyes and red-purple spots on the floor, and the floor seemed very close to his face. Within 2 minutes these visual effects were gone, and replaced by a yellow haze, as if he were looking through a lens filter.&lt;ref name=fabing/&gt;

Fabing and Hawkins commented that bufotenin’s psychedelic effects were "reminiscent of [[LSD]] and [[mescaline]] but develop and disappear more quickly, indicating rapid central action and rapid degradation of the drug".

====Isbell (1956)====
In 1956, Dr. [[Harris Isbell]] at the Public Health Service Hospital in [[Lexington, Kentucky]] experimented with bufotenine as a snuff. He reported “no subjective or objective effects were observed after spraying with as much as 40 mg bufotenine”; however subjects who received 10–12&amp;nbsp;mg injected [[intramuscular]]ly reported “elements of visual hallucinations consisting of a play of colors, lights, and patterns”.&lt;ref name=chilton/&gt;

====Turner &amp; Merlis (1959)====
Turner and Merlis (1959) &lt;ref name=turner&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Turner WJ, Merlis S |year=1959 |title=Effects of some indolealkylamines on man |journal=Arch Neurol Psychiatry |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=121–9 |doi=10.1001/archneurpsyc.1959.02340130141020 |pmid=13605329}}&lt;/ref&gt; experimented with intravenous administration of bufotenine (as the water-soluble creatinine sulfate salt) to schizophrenics at a New York state hospital. They reported that when one subject received 10&amp;nbsp;mg during a 50-second interval, “the peripheral nervous system effects were extreme: at 17 seconds, flushing of the face, at 22 seconds, maximal inhalation, followed by maximal hyperventilation for about 2 minutes, during which the patient was unresponsive to stimuli; her face was plum-colored". Finally, Turner and Merlis reported that:

{{quote|on one occasion, which essentially terminated our study, a patient who received 40 mg intramuscularly, suddenly developed an extremely rapid heart rate; no pulse could be obtained; no blood pressure measured. There seemed to have been an onset of auricular fibrillation…extreme [[cyanosis]] developed. Massage over the heart was vigorously executed and the pulse returned to normal…shortly thereafter the patient, still cyanotic, sat up saying: "Take that away. I don’t like them".}}

After pushing doses to the morally admissible limit without producing visuals, Turner and Merlis conservatively concluded: “We must reject bufotenine…as capable of producing the acute phase of [[Cohoba]] intoxication”.&lt;ref name=chilton/&gt;

====McLeod and Sitaram (1985)====
A 1985 study by McLeod and Sitaram in humans reported that bufotenine administered [[Insufflation (medicine)|intranasally]] at a dose of 1–16&amp;nbsp;mg had no effect, other than intense local irritation. When given intravenously at low doses (2–4&amp;nbsp;mg), bufotenine [[oxalate]] caused anxiety but no other effects; however, a dose of 8&amp;nbsp;mg resulted in profound emotional and perceptual changes, involving extreme [[anxiety]], a sense of imminent death, and visual disturbance associated with color reversal and distortion, and intense flushing of the cheeks and forehead.&lt;ref name=mcleod&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McLeod WR, Sitaram BR |year=1985 |title=Bufotenine reconsidered |journal=[[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] |volume=72 |issue=5 |pages=447–50 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1985.tb02638.x |pmid=4091027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ott (2001)====
In 2001, ethnobotanist [[Jonathan Ott]] published the results  of a study in which he self-administered [[free base]] bufotenine via [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]] (5–100&amp;nbsp;mg), [[sublingual]]ly (50&amp;nbsp;mg), [[rectal|intrarectally]] (30&amp;nbsp;mg), [[Mouth|orally]] (100&amp;nbsp;mg) and via [[smoking|vaporization]] (2–8&amp;nbsp;mg).&lt;ref name=ott2&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ott J |year=2001 |title=Pharmanopo-psychonautics: human intranasal, sublingual, intrarectal, pulmonary and oral pharmacology of bufotenine |journal=J Psychoactive Drugs |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=273–81 |url=http://entheology.org/edoto/anmviewer.asp?a=9&amp;z=8 |pmid=11718320 |doi=10.1080/02791072.2001.10400574}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ott reported “visionary effects" of intranasal bufotenine and that the "visionary threshold dose" by this route was 40&amp;nbsp;mg, with smaller doses eliciting perceptibly psychoactive effects. He reported that "intranasal bufotenine is throughout quite physically relaxing; in no case was there facial rubescence, nor any discomfort nor disesteeming side effects".

At 100&amp;nbsp;mg, effects began within 5 minutes, peaked at 35–40 minutes, and lasted up to 90 minutes. Higher doses produced effects that were described as psychedelic, such as "swirling, colored patterns typical of tryptamines, tending toward the arabesque".
Free base bufotenin taken sublingually was found to be identical to intranasal use. The potency, duration, and psychedelic action was the same. Ott found vaporized free base bufotenin active from 2–8&amp;nbsp;mg with 8&amp;nbsp;mg producing "ring-like, swirling, colored patterns with eyes closed". He noted that the visual effects of insufflated bufotenine were verified by one colleague, and those of vaporized bufotenine by several volunteers.

Ott concluded that free base bufotenin taken intranasally and sublingually produced effects similar to those of [[Yopo]] without the toxic peripheral symptoms, such as facial flushing, observed in other studies in which the drug was administered intravenously.

===Association with schizophrenia and other mental disorders===
A study conducted in the late 1960s reported the detection of bufotenin in the urine of schizophrenic subjects;&lt;ref name="nature_2204"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Faurbye A, Pind K |title=Occurrence of bufotenin in the urine of schizophrenic patients and normal persons |journal=Nature |volume=220 |issue=5166 |page=489 |date=November 1968 |pmid=5686166 |doi=10.1038/220489a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, subsequent research has failed to confirm these findings.&lt;ref name="pm5860629"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Siegel M |title=A sensitive method for the detection of n,n-dimethylserotonin (bufotenin) in urine; failure to demonstrate its presence in the urine of schizophrenic and normal subjects |journal=J Psychiatr Res |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=205–11 |date=October 1965 |pmid=5860629 |doi=10.1016/0022-3956(65)90030-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pomilio&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pomilio AB, Vitale AA, Ciprian-Ollivier J, Cetkovich-Bakmas M, Gómez R, Vázquez G |year=1999 |title=Ayahoasca: an experimental psychosis that mirrors the transmethylation hypothesis of schizophrenia |journal=J Ethnopharmacol |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=29–51 |pmid=10350367 |doi=10.1016/S0378-8741(98)00163-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ciprian&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ciprian-Ollivier J, Cetkovich-Bakmas MG |year=1997 |title=Altered consciousness states and endogenous psychoses: a common molecular pathway? |journal=[[Schizophrenia Research]] |volume=28 |issue=2–3 |pages=257–65 |pmid=9468359 |doi=10.1016/S0920-9964(97)00116-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=carpenter&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Carpenter WT Jr |author2=Fink EB |author3=Narasimhachari N |author4=Himwich HE |year=1975 |title=A test of the transmethylation hypothesis in acute schizophrenic patients |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=132 |issue=10 |pages=1067–71 |pmid=1058643 |doi=10.1176/ajp.132.10.1067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study utilized a [[mass spectrometry]] approach to detect levels of bufotenin in the urine of individuals with severe autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and asymptomatic subjects. Their results indicate significantly higher levels of bufotenin in the urine of the ASD and schizophrenic groups when compared to asymptomatic individuals.&lt;ref name="pm20150873"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Emanuele E, Colombo R, Martinelli V, Brondino N, Marini M, Boso M, Barale F, Politi P |title=Elevated urine levels of bufotenine in patients with autistic spectrum disorders and schizophrenia |journal=Neuro Endocrinol Lett |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=117–21 |year=2010 |pmid=20150873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==

===[[Australia]]===
Bufotenin is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance according to the Criminal Code Regulations of the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia.&lt;ref name=ccr&gt;{{citation |title=Criminal Code Regulation 2005 (SL2005-2) |version= |publisher=Australian Capital Territory |date=May 1, 2005 |url=http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/sl/2005-2/20050501-18968/rtf/2005-2.rtf |format=rtf |accessdate=2007-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also listed as a Schedule 9 substance under the [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons|Poisons Standard]] (October 2015).&lt;ref name="Poisons Standard"&gt;Poisons Standard October 2015 https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2015L01534&lt;/ref&gt; A schedule 9 drug is outlined in the [[Poisons Act 1964]] as "Substances which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of the CEO."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slp.wa.gov.au/pco/prod/FileStore.nsf/Documents/MRDocument:26063P/$FILE/Poisons%20Act%201964%20-%20%5B09-f0-04%5D.pdf?OpenElement Poisons Act 1964]. slp.wa.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1981]] {{convert|6.0|g|oz}} is determined to be enough for court of trial and {{convert|2.0|g|oz}} is considered intent to sell and supply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slp.wa.gov.au/pco/prod/FileStore.nsf/Documents/MRDocument:28280P/$FILE/Misuse%20Of%20Drugs%20Act%201981%20-%20%5B06-e0-00%5D.pdf?OpenElement Misuse of Drugs Act 1981 (2015)]. slp.wa.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[United Kingdom]]===
In the UK, bufotenin is a Class A drug under the 1971 [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971|Misuse of Drugs Act]].

===[[United States]]===
Bufotenine (DEA Drug Code 7403) is regulated as a [[Schedule I (US)|Schedule I]] drug by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] at the federal level in the [[United States]] and is therefore illegal to buy, possess, and sell.&lt;ref name="PART 1308 — SCHEDULES OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES - 1308.11 Schedule I"&gt;[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/1308_11.htm §1308.11 Schedule I.] deadiversion.usdoj.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

Although raised Catholic, he has expressed [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] views&lt;ref name=indielondon/&gt; and a great interest in the philosophies of [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=Average&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.details.com/celebrities-entertainment/cover-stars/201205/chris-evans-avengers |title=''The Avengers''{{'}} Chris Evans: Just Your Average Beer-Swilling, Babe-Loving Buddhist |magazine=[[Details (magazine)|Details]] |first=Adam |last=Sachs |date=May 2012 |accessdate=April 16, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412044521/http://www.details.com/celebrities-entertainment/cover-stars/201205/chris-evans-avengers |archivedate=April 12, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evans is a supporter of marriage equality. In 2012, he said “Are you kidding me? It’s insane that civil rights are being denied people in this day and age. It’s embarrassing, and it’s heartbreaking. It goes without saying that I’m completely in support of gay marriage. In 10 years we’ll be ashamed that this was an issue.” &lt;ref&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/21/chris-evans-on-gay-marriage_n_1442704.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schisms and their Councils.svg|thumb|right|upright=2.25|Christian schisms and their councils]]

A '''Christian denomination''' is a distinct [[religion|religious]] body within [[Christianity]], identified by traits such as a name, organisation, leadership and doctrine. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church or sometimes [[Communion (Christian)|fellowship]]. Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine; issues such as the [[Christology|nature of Jesus]], the authority of [[apostolic succession]], [[Christian eschatology|eschatology]], and [[papal primacy]] may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations—often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties—are sometimes known as "[[branches of Christianity]]". These branches differ in many ways, especially through differences in practices and belief.

Individual [[List of Christian denominations|denominations]] vary widely in the degree to which they recognize one another. Several groups claim to be the direct and [[One true church|sole authentic successor]] of the church founded by [[Jesus Christ]] in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century AD]].  Others, however, believe in denominationalism, where some or all Christian groups are legitimate churches of the same religion regardless of their distinguishing labels, beliefs, and practices&lt;!--from Denominationalism 3/22/15--&gt;.  Because of this concept, some Christian bodies reject the term "denomination" to describe themselves, to avoid implying equivalency with other churches or denominations.

The [[Catholic Church]] which claims 1.2 billion members&amp;nbsp;– slightly over half of all Christians worldwide&amp;nbsp;– does not view itself as a denomination, but as the original pre-denominational church,&lt;ref name=olsen1999&gt;Olson, Roger E. (1999). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3QHRJNkbKJgC&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=%22Roman+Catholic+Church%22,+%22mother+church%22,+denomination&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dSrNTbqSFo2btweXzo3tDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The story of Christian theology: twenty centuries of tradition &amp; reform.]'' Downer's Grove, Illinois: InterVarsity Press (652 pages). p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; a view rejected by other Christians. [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] account for approximately 37 percent of Christians worldwide.&lt;ref name="pewforum1"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pewforum.org/files/2011/12/Christianity-fullreport-web.pdf |title= Pewforum: Christianity (2010) |format= PDF |date= |accessdate= 2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, Catholicism and Protestantism (including [[Anglicanism]], and other denominations sharing historical ties) comprise [[Western Christianity]]. Western Christian denominations prevail in [[Western Europe|Western]], [[Northern Europe|Northern]], [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Southern Europe]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the [[Americas]] and [[Oceania]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], with an estimated 225–300 million adherents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= Fairchild |first1= Mary |title= Christianity:Basics:Eastern Orthodox Church Denomination |publisher= about.com |url= http://christianity.about.com/od/easternorthodoxy/p/orthodoxprofile.htm |accessdate= 23 June 2014 |ref= none }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the second-largest Christian organization in the world and also considers itself the original pre-denominational church. Unlike the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church is itself a [[communion (Christianity)|communion]] of fully independent [[autocephalous]] churches (or "jurisdictions") that mutually recognize each other to the exclusion of others. The Eastern Orthodox Church, together with [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], constitutes [[Eastern Christianity]]. (There are also some smaller groups of [[Eastern Catholics]] which are in communion with the Bishop of Rome but have cultural and historical ties with other Eastern Christians.) Eastern Christian denominations are represented mostly in [[Eastern Europe]], [[North Asia]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Northeast Africa]].

Christians have various doctrines about the Church (the body of the faithful that they believe Jesus Christ established) and about how the divine church corresponds to Christian denominations. Both Catholics and Eastern Orthodox hold that their own organizations faithfully represent the ''[[Four Marks of the Church|One Holy catholic and Apostolic Church]]'' to the exclusion of the other. Sixteenth-century Protestants separated from the Catholic Church because of [[theology|theologies]] and [[ritual|practices]] that they considered to be in violation of their own interpretation. Generally, members of the various denominations acknowledge each other as Christians, at least to the extent that they have mutually recognized [[baptism]]s and acknowledge historically [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] views including the [[Divinity of Jesus]] and doctrines of [[Christian views on sin|sin]] and [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]], even though doctrinal and  [[ecclesiology|ecclesiological]] obstacles hinder [[ecumenism|full communion between churches]].

Since the reforms surrounding the [[Second Vatican Council]] of 1962–1965, the Catholic Church has referred to Protestant communities as "denominations", while reserving the term "church" for [[apostolic see|apostolic churches]], including the Eastern Orthodox (see ''[[subsistit in]]'' and [[branch theory]]). But some [[non-denominational Christianity|non-denominational Christians]]&lt;ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
{{See also|Christian Church#Related concepts}}

Each group uses different terminology to discuss their beliefs. This section will discuss the definitions of several terms used throughout the article, before discussing the beliefs themselves in detail in following sections.

A denomination within Christianity can be defined as a "recognized autonomous branch of the Christian Church"; major synonyms include "religious group, sect, Church," etc.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The Oxford Dictionary's full list of synonyms for "denomination" includes: "religious group, sect, Church, cult, movement, faith community, body, persuasion, religious persuasion, communion, order, fraternity, brotherhood, sisterhood, school; faith, creed, belief, religious belief, religion. rare: sodality."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Denomination|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries: English|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/denomination|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Church" as a synonym, refers to a "particular Christian organization with its own clergy, buildings, and distinctive doctrines";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Church|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries:English|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/church|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "church" can also more broadly be defined as the entire body of Christians, the "[[Christian Church]]".

Some traditional and [[evangelical]] [[Protestants]] draw a distinction between membership in the universal church and fellowship within the local church. Becoming a believer in Christ makes one a member of the universal church; one then may join a fellowship of other local believers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Church Membership and Church Fellowship. Is there a difference?|url=http://lifehouse.org/tracts/tbgchurchmembership.htm|first=T. B.|last=Gilbert|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some evangelical groups describe themselves as interdenominational fellowships, partnering with local churches to strengthen evangelical efforts, usually targeting a particular group with specialized needs, such as students or ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Church|first=Alec|last=Hill|date=1 July 2003|accessdate=6 June 2015|publisher=Intervarsity Christian Fellowship|url=http://www.intervarsity.org/news/church}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related concept is [[denominationalism]], the belief that some or all Christian groups are legitimate churches of the same religion regardless of their distinguishing labels, beliefs, and practices.&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.christiancourier.com/articles/798-denominationalism-permissible-or-reprehensible|title=Denominationalism – Permissible or Reprehensible?|publisher=Christian Courier|first=Wayne|last=Jackson|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Conversely, "denominationalism" can also refer to "emphasizing of denominational differences to the point of being narrowly exclusive", similar to [[sectarianism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/denominationalism|title=Denominationalism|publisher=Merriam Webster Dictionary|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protestant leaders differ greatly from the views of the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, the two largest Christian denominations. Each church makes mutually exclusive claims for itself to be the direct continuation of the Church founded by Jesus Christ, from whom other denominations later broke away.&lt;ref name=olsen1999 /&gt; These churches, and a few others, reject denominationalism.

==Major branches==

{{More citations needed|section|date=June 2016}}

[[Christianity]] can be taxonomically divided into five main groups: the [[Church of the East]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Catholicism|Roman Catholicism]], and [[Protestantism]]. The last is a broad umbrella term including many groups which do not share any ecclesiastical governance and have widely diverging beliefs and practices.

Christianity has denominational families (or movements) and also has individual denominations (or communions). The difference between a denomination and a denominational family is sometimes unclear to outsiders. Some denominational families can be considered major branches.  Groups that are members of a branch, while sharing historical ties and similar doctrines, are not necessarily in [[communion (Christianity)|communion]] with one another.

There were some movements considered heresies by the [[early church]] which do not exist today and are not generally referred to as denominations. Examples include the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]] (who had believed in an [[esotericism|esoteric]] [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] called [[gnosis]]), the [[Ebionite]]s (who denied the [[divinity of Jesus]]), and the [[Arianism|Arians]] (who subordinated the [[God the Son|Son]] to the [[God the Father|Father]] by denying the [[pre-existence of Christ]], thus placing [[Jesus]] as a created being), [[Bogumilism]] and [[Bosnian Church]]. The greatest divisions in Christianity today, however, are between the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox, Catholicism, and the various denominations formed during and after the [[Protestant Reformation]]. There also exists a number of [[non-Trinitarian]] groups. There also exist some non-traditional groups that the majority of other Christians view as [[apostasy|apostate]] or [[heresy|heretical]], and not as legitimate versions of Christianity.

Comparisons between denominational churches must be approached with caution. For example, in some churches, congregations are part of a larger church organization, while in other groups, each congregation is an independent [[autonomous entity|autonomous]] organization. This issue is further complicated by the existence of groups of congregations with a common heritage that are officially nondenominational and have no centralized authority or records, but which are identified as denominations by non-adherents. Study of such churches in denominational terms is therefore a more complex proposition.

Some groups count membership based on adult believers and [[baptism|baptized]] children of believers, while others only count adult baptized believers. Others may count membership based on those adult believers who have formally affiliated themselves with the congregation. In addition, there may be political motives of advocates or opponents of a particular group to inflate or deflate membership numbers through [[propaganda]] or outright deception.

===Denominationalism {{anchor|denominationalism}}===
Denominationalism is the belief that some or all Christian groups are legitimate churches of the same religion regardless of their distinguishing labels, beliefs, and practices.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt; The idea was first articulated by [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] within the [[Puritan]] movement. They argued that differences among Christians were inevitable, but that separation based on these differences was not necessarily [[schism (religion)|schism]]. Christians are obligated to practice their beliefs rather than remain within a church with which they disagree, but they must also recognize their imperfect knowledge and not condemn other Christians as [[apostate]] over unimportant matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seminary.fresno.edu/resources/life-in-a-muddy-world-reflections-on-denominationalism |title=Life in a Muddy World: Reflections on Denominationalism |first=Bruce |last=Guenther |publisher=Fresno Pacific Biblical Seminary; first published in Fall/Winter 2008 edition of In Touch Magazine. For reprint permission contact the Director of Public Relations at 1-800-251-6227 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310144947/http://seminary.fresno.edu/resources/life-in-a-muddy-world-reflections-on-denominationalism |archivedate=2015-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians view denominationalism as a regrettable fact. As of 2011, divisions are becoming less sharp, and there is increasing cooperation between denominations.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
[[theology|Theological]] denominationalism ultimately denies reality to any apparent doctrinal differences among the "denominations", reducing all differences to mere matters ''de nomina'' ("of names").{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

A denomination in this sense is created when part of a church no longer feel they can accept the leadership of that church as a spiritual leadership due to a different view of doctrine or what they see as immoral behaviour, but the schism does not in any way reflect either group leaving the Church as a theoretical whole.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

This particular doctrine is rejected by [[Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and the [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]. In these churches, it is not possible to have a separation over doctrinal or leadership issues, and any such attempts automatically are a type of [[Schism (religion)|schism]]. Some Protestant groups reject denominationalism as well.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Historical schisms and divisions==
Christianity has not been a monolithic faith since the [[Christianity in the 1st century|first century]] or [[Apostolic Age]], if ever, and today there exist a large variety of groups that share a common history and tradition within and without [[mainstream]] Christianity. Christianity is the largest religion in the world (making up approximately one-third of the population) and the various divisions have commonalities and differences in tradition, [[theology]], [[ecclesiology|church government]], doctrine, and language.

The largest [[schism]] or division in many classification schemes is between the families of [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] and [[Western Christianity]]. After these two larger families come distinct branches of Christianity. Most classification schemes list six (in order of size: Roman [[Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Anglicanism]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and the Church of the East, which was originally referred to as [[Nestorianism]] but in modern times is embodied by the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]).

Unlike Roman Catholicism, Protestantism is a general movement that has no universal governing authority. As such, diverse groups such as [[Adventism|Adventists]], [[Anabaptists]], [[Baptists]], [[Binitarianism|Binitarians]], [[Charismatic Christianity|Charismatics]], [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], [[Evangelical Christianity|Evangelicals]], [[Holiness movement|Holiness churches]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Moravian Church|Moravians]], [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], [[Reformed churches|Reformed]], and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] (depending on one's classification scheme) are all a part of the same family but have distinct doctrinal variations within each group{{snd}}[[Lutherans]] see themselves not to be a part of the rest of what they call "Reformed Protestantism" due to radical differences in sacramental theology and historical approach to the Reformation itself (both Reformed and Lutherans see their reformation in the sixteenth century to be a 'reforming' of the Catholic Church, not a rejection of it entirely). From these come denominations, which in the West, have independence from the others in their doctrine.

The Eastern and Roman Catholic churches, due to their [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] structures, are not said to be made up of denominations, rather, they include kinds of regional councils and individual congregations and church bodies, which do not officially differ from one another in doctrine.

===Antiquity===
The initial differences between the East and West traditions stem from socio-cultural and ethno-linguistic divisions in and between the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire]]s. Since the West (that is, Western Europe) spoke [[Latin]] as its ''[[lingua franca]]'' and the East (Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and northern Africa) largely used [[Aramaic]] and [[Koine Greek]] to transmit writings, theological developments were difficult to translate from one branch to the other. In the course of [[ecumenical council]]s (large gatherings of Christian leaders), some church bodies split from the larger family of Christianity. Many earlier [[heresy|heretical]] groups either died off for lack of followers or suppression by the church at large (such as [[Apollinarianism|Apollinarians]], [[Montanism|Montanists]], and [[Ebionites]]).

The first significant, lasting split in historic Christianity came from the [[Church of the East]], who left following the [[Christology|Christological]] controversy over [[Nestorianism]] in 431 (the Assyrians in 1994 released a common Christological statement with the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]). Today, the Assyrian and Roman Catholic Church view this schism as largely linguistic, due to problems of translating very delicate and precise terminology from Latin to [[Aramaic]] and vice versa (see [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]]).

Following the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, the next large split came with the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac]] and [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] churches dividing themselves, with the dissenting churches becoming today's [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]. In modern times, there have also been moves towards healing this split, with common Christological statements being made between [[Pope John Paul II]] and Syriac patriarch [[Ignatius Zakka I Iwas]], as well as between representatives of both Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy.

There has been a claim that the Chalcedonian Creed restored Nestorianism, however this is refuted by maintaining the following distinctions associated with the ''person'' of Christ:
two hypostases, two natures (Nestorian); one hypostasis, one nature (Monophysite); one hypostasis, two natures (Orthodox/Catholic).&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, J. (1911).

===Middle Ages===
{{main|East-West Schism}}
In Western Christianity, there were a handful of geographically isolated movements that preceded the spirit of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The [[Cathars]] were a very strong movement in medieval southwestern France, but did not survive into modern times. In northern [[Italy]] and southeastern [[France]], [[Peter Waldo]] founded the [[Waldensians]] in the 12th century. This movement has largely been absorbed by modern-day Protestant groups. In [[Bohemia]], a movement in the early 15th century by [[Jan Hus]] called the [[Hussite]]s defied Roman Catholic [[dogma]] and still exists to this day (alternately known as the [[Moravian Church]]).

Although the church as a whole did not experience any major divisions for centuries afterward, the Eastern and Western groups drifted until the point where patriarchs from both families [[excommunication|excommunicated]] one another in about 1054 in what is known as the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]]. The political and theological reasons for the schism are complex, but one major controversy was the inclusion and acceptance in the West of the [[filioque clause]] into the [[Nicene Creed]], which the East viewed as erroneous. Another was the definition of [[Primacy of the Roman Pontiff|papal primacy]].

Both West and East agreed that the patriarch of Rome was owed a "primacy of honour" by the other patriarchs (those of [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]], [[Constantinople]] and [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]), but the West also contended that this primacy extended to jurisdiction, a position rejected by the Eastern patriarchs. Various attempts at dialogue between the two groups would occur, but it was only in the 1960s, under Pope [[Paul VI]] and [[Patriarch Athenagoras]], that significant steps began to be made to mend the relationship between the two.

[[File:Lutherstadt Wittenberg 09-2016 photo06.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Door of the ''Schlosskirche'' (castle church) in Wittenberg to which Luther is said to have nailed his [[95 Theses]] on 31st October 1517, sparking the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].]]

===Protestant Reformation (16th century)===
{{main|Protestant Reformation}}

The Protestant Reformation began with the posting of [[Martin Luther]]'s ''[[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]]'' in [[Saxony]] on October 31, 1517, written as a set of grievances to reform the pre-Reformation Western Church. [[Martin Luther (resources)|Luther's writings]], combined with the work of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] theologian [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and French theologian and politician [[John Calvin]] sought to reform existing problems in doctrine and practice. Due to the reactions of ecclesiastical office holders at the time of the reformers, these reformers separated from the Roman Catholic Church, instigating a rift in [[Western Christianity]].

In [[England]], [[Henry VIII of England]] declared himself to be supreme head of the [[Church of England]] with the [[Act of Supremacy]] in 1531, founding the Church of England, repressing both Lutheran reformers and those loyal to the pope. [[Thomas Cranmer]] as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] introduced the Reformation, in a form compromising between the Calvinists and Lutherans.

===Old and Liberal Catholic Churches (19th-20th centuries)===

The [[Old Catholic Church]] split from the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] in the 1870s because of the promulgation of the [[dogma]] of [[Papal Infallibility]] as promoted by the [[First Vatican Council]] of 1869–1870. The term 'Old Catholic' was first used in 1853 to describe the members of the See of Utrecht that were not under Papal authority. The Old Catholic movement grew in America but has not maintained ties with Utrecht, although talks are under way between independent Old Catholic bishops and Utrecht.

The [[Liberal Catholic Church]] started in 1916 via an Old Catholic bishop in London, bishop Matthew, who consecrated bishop James Wedgwood to the Episcopacy. This stream has in its relatively short existence known many splits, which operate worldwide under several names.

===Eastern Christianity===
In the Eastern world, the largest body of believers in modern times is the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], sometimes imprecisely called "Greek Orthodox" because from the time of Christ through the Byzantine empire, Greek was its common language. However, the term "[[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]]" actually refers to only one portion of the entire Eastern Orthodox Church. The Eastern Orthodox Church believes itself to be the continuation of the original Christian Church established by [[Jesus Christ]], and the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]]. The Eastern Orthodox and the Roman Catholics have been separated since the 11th century, following the [[East–West Schism]], with each of them claiming to represent the original pre-schism Church.

The Eastern Orthodox consider themselves to be spiritually one body, which is administratively grouped into several [[autocephaly|autocephalous]] jurisdictions (also commonly referred to as "Churches", despite being parts of one Church). They do not recognize any single bishop as universal church leader, but rather each bishop governs only his own [[diocese]]. The [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] is known as the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]], and holds the title "[[primus inter pares|first among equals]]", meaning only that if a great council is called, the Patriarch sits as president of the council. He has no more power than any other bishop. Currently, the largest [[synod]] with the most members is the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. Others include the ancient Patriarchates of [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Antioch]] and [[Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], the [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian]], [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian]], [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian]] and [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgarian]] Orthodox Churches, and several smaller ones.
[[File:Church of Saint John the Arab.jpg|thumb|225px|A 6th century Nestorian church, St. John the Arab, in the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] village of [[Andac|Geramon]].]]
The second largest Eastern Christian communion is [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], which is organized in a similar manner, with six national autocephalous groups and two autonomous bodies, although there are greater internal differences than among the Eastern Orthodox (especially in the diversity of [[rite]]s being used). The six autocephalous Oriental Orthodox Churches are the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] (Egyptian), [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac]], [[Armenian Orthodox Church|Armenian]], [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church|Malankara]] (Indian), [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian]] and [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Eritrean]] Orthodox Churches. In the Aramaic-speaking areas of the [[Middle East]], the Syriac Orthodox Church has long been dominant. Although the region of modern-day [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]] has had a strong body of believers since the infancy of Christianity, these regions only gained autocephaly in 1963 and 1994 respectively. The Oriental Orthodox are distinguished from the Eastern Orthodox by doctrinal differences concerning the union of human and divine natures in the person of Jesus Christ, and the two communions separated as a consequence of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in the year 451, although there have been recent moves towards reconciliation. Since these groups are relatively obscure in the West, literature on them has sometimes included the [[Church of the East]], which, like the Oriental Orthodox, originated in the 1st century A.D., but has not been in communion with them since before the [[Council of Ephesus]] of 431.

Largely [[aniconic]], the Church of the East represents a third Eastern Christian tradition in its own right. In recent centuries, it has split into three Churches. The largest (since the early 20th century) is the [[Baghdad]]-based [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] formed from groups that entered communion with Rome at different times, beginning in 1552. The second-largest is what since 1976&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CnSCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=Assyrian+officially+1976&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjOqPzw45LeAhWoDcAKHSd0BrMQ6AEIVTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Assyrian%20officially%201976&amp;f=false Wilhelm Baum, Dietmar W. Winkler (editors), ''The Church of the East: A Concise History'' (Routledge 2003), p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt; is officially called the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and which from 1933 to 2015 was headquartered first in [[Cyprus]] and then in the [[United States]], but whose present Catholicos-Patriarch, [[Gewargis III]], elected in 2015, lives in [[Erbil]], [[Iraq]]. The third is the [[Ancient Church of the East]], distinct since 1964 and headed by [[Addai II Giwargis]], resident in Baghdad.

There are also the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], most of which are counterparts of those listed above, sharing with them the same theological and liturgical traditions, but differing from them in that they recognize the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]] as the [[Primacy of the Roman Pontiff|universal head of the Church]]. They are fully part of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic communion]], on the same level juridically as the [[Latin Church]]. Most of their members do not describe themzselves as "[[Roman Catholic (term)|''Roman'' Catholics]]", a term they associate with membership of the Latin Church, and speak of themselves in relation to whichever Church they belong to: [[Maronite Church|Maronites]], [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkites]], [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholics]], [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic Catholics]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean Catholics]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crisismagazine.com/2011/we-are-non-roman-catholics Robert Spencer, "We are Non-Roman Catholics" in ''Crisis Magazine'', 22 November 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Christianity===
{{Denominations of Christianity}}

The [[Latin Church|Latin portion]] of the [[Catholic Church]], along with [[Anglicanism]] and [[Protestantism]], comprise the three major divisions of [[Christianity]] in the Western world. Roman Catholics do not describe themselves as a denomination but rather as the original Holy and Universal Church; which all other branches broke off from in [[schism (religious)|schism]]. The [[Baptist]], [[Methodism|Methodist]], and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches are generally considered to be Protestant denominations, although strictly speaking, of these three, only the Lutherans took part in the official [[Protestation at Speyer]] after the decree of the [[Second Diet of Speyer]] mandated the burning of Luther's works and the end of the [[Protestant Reformation]].

Anglicanism was generally classified as Protestant, but since the "Tractarian" or [[Oxford Movement]] of the 19th century, led by [[John Henry Newman]], Anglican writers emphasize a more catholic understanding of the church and characterize it as more properly understood as its own tradition—a ''via media'' ("middle way"), ''both'' Protestant and Catholic. The American province of the [[Anglican Communion]], the [[Episcopal Church USA]], describes itself as a modern ''via media'' church in this tradition. A case is sometimes also made to regard Lutheranism in a similar way, considering the catholic character of its foundational documents (the [[Augsburg Confession]] and other documents contained in the [[Book of Concord]]) and its existence prior to the Anglican, Anabaptist, and [[Reformed]] churches, from which nearly all other Protestant denominations derive.

One central tenet of Catholicism (which is a common point between Roman Catholic, Anglican, Eastern Orthodox, and some other Churches), is its practice of [[apostolic succession]]. "Apostle" means "one who is sent out". Jesus commissioned the first [[twelve apostles]] (see [[Biblical Figures]] for the list of the Twelve), and they, in turn laid hands on subsequent church leaders to ordain (commission) them for ministry. In this manner, Roman Catholics and Anglicans trace their ordained ministers all the way back to the original Twelve.

Roman Catholics believe that the [[Pope]] has authority which can be traced directly to the apostle [[Saint Peter|Peter]] whom they hold to be the original head of and first Pope of the [[Christian Church|Church]]. There are smaller churches, such as the [[Old Catholic Church]] which rejected the definition of [[Papal Infallibility]] at the [[First Vatican Council]], and [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholics]], [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] who believe that Anglicanism is a continuation of historical [[Catholicism]] and who incorporate many Catholic beliefs and practices. The Catholic Church refers to itself simply by the terms ''Catholic'' and ''Catholicism'' (which mean universal).

Sometimes, Catholics, based on a strict interpretation of ''[[extra ecclesiam nulla salus]]'' ("Outside the Church, there is no salvation"), rejected any notion those outside its communion could be regarded as part of any true Catholic Christian faith, an attitude rejected by the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962{{ndash}}1965).&lt;ref name="UnitatisRed"&gt;«It remains true that all who have been justified by faith in Baptism are members of Christ's body, and have a right to be called Christian, and so are correctly accepted as brothers by the children of the Catholic Church.» [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html Second Vatican Council, Decree on Ecumenism ''Unitatis Redintegratio'', n.3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306113628/http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html |date=March 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholicism has a hierarchical structure in which supreme authority for matters of faith and practice are the exclusive domain of the Pope, who sits on the Throne of Peter, and the bishops when acting in union with him. Most Catholics are unaware of the existence of [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholicism]] which represents a relatively recent split from the Catholic Church and is particularly vocal in rejecting their use of the term ''Catholic''.

Each Protestant movement has developed freely, and many have split over theological issues. For instance, a number of movements grew out of spiritual [[Revivalism|revivals]], such as [[Pentecostalism]]. Doctrinal issues and matters of [[conscience]] have also divided Protestants. The [[Anabaptist]] tradition, made up of the [[Amish]], [[Hutterites]], and [[Mennonites]], rejected the Roman Catholic and Lutheran doctrines of [[pedobaptism|infant baptism]]; this tradition is also noted for its belief in [[pacifism]]. Still others formed out of administrative issues; [[Methodism]] branched off as its own group of denominations when the [[American Revolutionary War]] complicated the movement's ability to ordain ministers (it had begun as a movement within the Church of England). In Methodism's case, it has undergone a number of administrative schisms and mergers with other denominations (especially those associated with the [[holiness movement]] in the 20th century).

Many churches with roots in [[Restorationism]] reject being identified as Protestant or even as a denomination at all, as they use only the Bible and not creeds, and model the church after what they feel is the first-century church found in scripture; the [[Churches of Christ]] are one example; [[African Initiated Church]]es, like [[Kimbanguism]], mostly fall within Protestantism, with varying degrees of syncretism. The measure of mutual acceptance between the denominations and movements varies, but is growing largely due to the [[ecumenism|ecumenical movement]] in the 20th century and overarching Christian bodies such as the [[World Council of Churches]].

===Christians with Jewish roots===

[[Messianic Jews]] maintain a Jewish identity while accepting Jesus as the [[Messiah]] and the [[New Testament]] as authoritative. After the founding of the church, the [[Jewish Christian|disciples of Jesus]] generally retained their ethnic origins while accepting the [[Gospel]] message. The [[Council of Jerusalem|first church council was called in Jerusalem]] to address just this issue, and the deciding opinion was written by [[James, brother of Jesus|James the Just]], the first bishop of Jerusalem and a pivotal figure in the Christian movement. The history of Messianic Judaism includes many movements and groups and defies any simple classification scheme.

The [[Saint Thomas Christians|Nasrani]] or [[Saint Thomas Christians|Syrian Malabar Nasrani]] community in [[Kerala]], [[India]] is conscious of their Jewish origins. However, they have lost many of their Jewish traditions due to western influences. The Nasrani are also known as [[Saint Thomas Christians|Syrian Christians]] or [[Saint Thomas Christians|St. Thomas Christians]]. This is because they follow the traditions of [[Syriac Christianity]] and are descendants of the early converts by [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas the Apostle]]. Today, they belong to various denominations of Christianity but they have kept their unique identity within each of these denominations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stthoma.com/ Thomas The Apostole] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208073816/http://stthoma.com/ |date=2011-02-08 }}. Stthoma.com. Retrieved on 2010-11-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

An existing community that still maintain their Jewish traditions is the [[Knanaya]]. They are an endogamous sub-ethnic group among the Syrian Malabar Nasrani and are the descendants of early Jewish Christian settlers who arrived in Kerala in A.D 345. Although affiliated with a variety of Roman Catholic and Oriental Orthodox denominations, they have remained a cohesive community, shunning intermarriage with outsiders (but not with fellow-Knanaya of other denominations).

==Modern history==

===Quakers===
Some denominations which arose alongside the Western Christian tradition consider themselves Christian, but neither Roman Catholic nor wholly Protestant, such as the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers). Quakerism began as an evangelical Christian movement in 17th century [[England]], eschewing priests and all formal Anglican or Roman Catholic sacraments in their worship, including many of those practices that remained among the stridently Protestant [[Puritan]]s such as baptism with water. They were known in America for helping with the Underground Railroad, and like the Mennonites, Quakers traditionally refrain from participation in war.

===Latter Day Saint movement===
{{Main|Latter Day Saint movement|Mormonism}}
{{See also|List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|Mormonism and Christianity}}
Most Latter Day Saint denominations are derived from the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)]] established by [[Joseph Smith]] in 1830. The largest worldwide denomination, and the one publicly recognized as [[Mormonism]], is [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], although there are various considerably smaller sects that broke from it after its relocation to the Rocky Mountains in the mid-1800s. Several of these broke away over the abandonment of practicing [[Mormonism and polygamy|plural marriage]] after the [[1890 Manifesto]]. Most of the "Prairie Saint" denominations (see below) were established after [[Death of Joseph Smith|Smith's death]] by the remnants of the Latter Day Saints who did not go west with [[Brigham Young]]. Many of these opposed some of the 1840s theological developments in favor of 1830s theological understandings and practices. Other denominations are defined by either a belief in Joseph Smith as a [[prophet]] or acceptance of the [[Book of Mormon]] as [[religious text|scripture]]. [[Mormons]] generally consider themselves to be [[Restorationism|restorationist]], believing that Smith, as [[prophet, seer, and revelator]], restored the original and true Church of Christ to the earth. Some Latter Day Saint denominations are regarded by other Christians as being [[Nontrinitarianism|nontrinitarian]] or even non-Christian, but the Latter Day Saints are predominantly in disagreement with these claims. Mormons see themselves as believing in a [[God in Mormonism|Godhead]] comprising the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost as separate personages united in purpose. Mormons regard traditional definitions of the [[Trinity]] as aberrations of true doctrine and emblematic of the [[Great Apostasy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Articles of Faith, no. 1|url=http://mormon.org/articles-of-faith}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they do not accept certain trinitarian definitions in the [[List of Christian creeds|post-apostolic creeds]], such as the [[Athanasian Creed]].

===Second Great Awakening===
{{Main|Second Great Awakening|Restorationism|Restoration Movement}}
The Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement began on the American frontier during the [[Second Great Awakening]] (1790–1870) of the early 19th century. The movement sought to restore the church and "the unification of all Christians in a single body patterned after the church of the New Testament."&lt;ref name="I Just Want to Be a Christian"&gt;[[Rubel Shelly]], ''I Just Want to Be a Christian'', 20th Century Christian, Nashville, Tennessee 1984, {{ISBN|0-89098-021-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54}} Members do not identify as [[Protestant]] but simply as Christian.&lt;ref&gt;"The church of Jesus Christ is non-denominational. It is neither Catholic, Jewish nor Protestant. It was not founded in 'protest' of any institution, and it is not the product of the 'Restoration' or 'Reformation.' It is the product of the seed of the kingdom (Luke 8:11ff) grown in the hearts of men." V. E. Howard, ''What Is the Church of Christ?'' 4th Edition (Revised), 1971, page 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Neither Catholic, Protestant nor Jew"&gt;Batsell Barrett Baxter and Carroll Ellis, ''Neither Catholic, Protestant nor Jew'', tract, Church of Christ (1960) ASIN: B00073CQPM. According to Richard Thomas Hughes in ''Reviving the Ancient Faith: The Story of Churches of Christ in America,'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1996 ({{ISBN|0-8028-4086-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8028-4086-8}}), this is "arguably the most widely distributed tract ever published by the Churches of Christ or anyone associated with that tradition."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Religion in the South"&gt;Samuel S. Hill, Charles H. Lippy, Charles Reagan Wilson, ''Encyclopedia of Religion in the South'', Mercer University Press, 2005, ({{ISBN|0-86554-758-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-86554-758-2}}) 854 pages&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|213}}

The Restoration Movement developed from several independent efforts to return to [[Apostolic Age|apostolic Christianity]], but two groups, which independently developed similar approaches to the Christian faith, were particularly important.&lt;ref name="Redigging the Wells"&gt;Monroe E. Hawley, ''Redigging the Wells: Seeking Undenominational Christianity'', Quality Publications, Abilene, Texas, 1976, {{ISBN|0-89137-512-0}} (paper), {{ISBN|0-89137-513-9}} (cloth)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27–32}} The first, led by [[Barton W. Stone]], began at [[Cane Ridge]], Kentucky and called themselves simply as "[[Christians (Stone Movement)|Christians]]". The second began in western Pennsylvania and Virginia (now West Virginia) and was led by [[Thomas Campbell (clergyman)|Thomas Campbell]] and his son, [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]]; they used the name "[[Disciples of Christ (Campbell Movement)|Disciples of Christ]]". Both groups sought to restore the whole Christian church on the pattern set forth in the [[New Testament]], and both believed that [[creed]]s kept Christianity divided. In 1832 they joined in fellowship with a handshake.

Among other things, they were united in the belief that [[Jesus]] is the Christ, the [[Son of God]]; that Christians should celebrate the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]] on the [[Sabbath in Christianity|first day of each week]]; and that [[Believer's baptism|baptism of adult believers]] by [[Immersion baptism|immersion in water]] is a necessary condition for [[salvation]]. Because the founders wanted to abandon all denominational labels, they used the biblical names for the followers of Jesus.&lt;ref name="McAlister &amp; Tucker, 1975"&gt;McAlister, Lester G. and Tucker, William E. (1975), ''Journey in Faith: A History of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)'', St. Louis, MO: Chalice Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8272-1703-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}} Both groups promoted a return to the purposes of the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st-century churches]] as described in the New Testament. One historian of the movement has argued that it was primarily a unity movement, with the restoration motif playing a subordinate role.&lt;ref name="Garrett 2002"&gt;Leroy Garrett, ''The Stone-Campbell Movement: The Story of the American Restoration Movement'', College Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-89900-909-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-89900-909-4}}, 573 pages&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |8}}

The Restoration Movement has since divided into multiple separate groups. There are three main branches in the US: the [[Churches of Christ]], the [[Christian churches and churches of Christ]], and the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]]. Other U.S.-based groups affiliated with the movement are the [[International Churches of Christ]] and the [[International Christian Churches]]. Non-U.S. groups include the [[Churches of Christ in Australia]], the [[Evangelical Christian Church in Canada]], the [[Churches of Christ in Europe]]. The [[Plymouth Brethren]] are a similar though historically unrelated group which originated in the United Kingdom. Some churches, such as [[Churches of Christ]] or the [[Plymouth Brethren]] reject formal ties with other churches within the movement.

Other groups originating during the Second Great Awakening include the [[Millerites|Adventist]] movement, the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Christian Science]] (which had roots in [[Congregational church|Congregationalism]], but regarded itself as restorative). Each of these groups, founded within fifty years of one another, originally claimed to be an unprecedented, late restoration of the primitive Christian church. Some Baptist churches with [[Landmarkism|Landmarkist]] views have similar beliefs concerning their connection with primitive Christianity.

===Russian sectarianism===
The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] has a long history of opposing heresies, beginning with [[Bogomilism]] and the [[Old Believers]], a sect opposing the reforms introduced in the [[Russian Empire]] under [[Patriarch Nikon]] in 1666.

In 18th to 19th century [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], there arose a new type of denominational schism grouped as [[Spiritual Christianity]] ({{lang|ru|духовное христианство}}).
Many heresies, nicknamed by the church or government, called themselves "spiritual Christians", such as: [[Dukhobor]]s, [[Ikonobortsy]] ("[[Iconoclasm|Iconoclasts]]"), [[Khlysts]], [[Molokan]]s, ''[http://www.molokane.org/taxonomy/ Pryguny]'', [[Skoptsy]], [[Shtundists]], ''[http://www.subbotniki.net Subbotniki]'', etc. These sects often have radically divergent notions of spirituality. Their common denominator is that they sought God in "Spirit and Truth", ([[Gospel of John]] 4:24) rather than in the Church of official Orthodoxy or ancient rites of [[Old Believers]]. Rejecting the official church, they considered their religious organization as a homogeneous community, without division into laymen and clergy.

In the 1830s, Ivan Grigorev Kanygin founded religious communities with communal practices in the [[Novouzensk]] region. They called themselves Communists or Methodists, but from the 1870s became known as "Mormons", by comparison with the contemporaneous American movement. An unrelated community known as "Samara Mormons" developed near the [[Volga]] city of [[Samara, Russia|Samara]]. They avoided alcohol, tobacco, and swearing, cooperated in commercial enterprises, and governed themselves by "apostles" and "prophets".

A more recent charismatic movement in Russia is the "[[Vissarion|Church of the Last Testament]]", which established a substantial settlement in the Siberian Taiga in the 1990s.

===Iglesia ni Cristo===
Due to a number of similarities, some [[Protestantism|Protestant]] writers describe the doctrines of the Philippines originating [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] as restorationist in outlook and theme.&lt;ref name=annharper&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Iglesia ni Cristo and Evangelical Christianity|journal=Journal of Asian Mission|year=2001|first=Ann C.|last=Harper|volume=3|issue=1|pages=101–119|id=|url=http://www.apologeticsindex.org/docs/iglesia_ni_cristo_and_evangelical_christianity.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; INC, however, does not consider itself to be part of the [[Restoration Movement]]. On the other hand, some Catholic leaders viewed Iglesia ni Cristo as an offshoot of the Roman Catholic Church, since the then first leader or Executive Minister ([[Felix Y. Manalo|Felix Ysagun Manalo]]) was a former Catholic member. However, INC is working and functioning spiritually and financially on its own, thus, completely independent from any religious body and communion.

The church hierarchical administration (Filipino: ''Pamamahala''),&lt;ref name='exec'&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=501504 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130208163319/http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=501504 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2013-02-08 | title = Iglesia ni Cristo leader Manalo passes away | author = Katherine Adraneda | newspaper = The Philippine Star | accessdate = 2011-06-11 | date = 2009-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; centralized church governance, theological orientation, places of worship architectural design, adaptation to modern technology, very strong and strict discipline, and country of origin or establishment, are some of the INC features, polity and organizational structure that identify itself different from Restoration Movement, [[Protestantism]], [[Catholicism]] and mainstream [[Christianity]]. Iglesia ni Cristo members are noted for [[voting block|bloc voting]] in [[Philippine elections|political elections]]&lt;ref name="Pasugo1986"&gt;an article in ''Pasugo'' (Manila: Iglesia ni Cristo, 1986) cited by "Pepe" [http://128.32.250.15:8080/pepesblog/2005/02/21 'Iglesia ni Kristo - religion and politics in Philippine society']{{Dead link|date=April 2009}} ''Pepeslog'' (Berkeley: University of California, 21 February 2001). Retrieved July 3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; which is unique to the church due to their doctrine on unity and a practice that cannot be found outside INC.

===New Thought Movement===
{{Main|New Thought}} {{See also|History of New Thought}}
Another group of churches is known under the banner of "[[New Thought]]". These churches share a [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[mysticism|mystical]] predisposition and understanding of the [[Bible]] and were strongly influenced by the [[Transcendentalist]] movement—particularly the work of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]]. Another antecedent of this movement was [[Swedenborgianism]], founded in 1787 on the writings of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], who claimed to have received a new revelation from Jesus Christ through continuous heavenly visions which he experienced over a period of at least twenty-five years.&lt;ref&gt;William James, [http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=JamVari.sgm&amp;images=images/modeg&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=all "The Varieties of Religious Experience"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. pp.92-93. New York 1929&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Thought concept was named by [[Emma Curtis Hopkins]] ("teacher of teachers") after Hopkins broke off from [[Mary Baker Eddy]]'s [[Church of Christ, Scientist]]—the movement had been previously known as the Mental Sciences. The New Thought movement includes [[Religious Science]] founded by [[Ernest Holmes]]; [[Divine Science]], founded by [[Malinda Cramer]] and the [[Nona L. Brooks|Brook sisters]]; and [[Unity Church|Unity]] founded by [[Charles Fillmore (Unity Church)|Charles Fillmore]] and [[Myrtle Fillmore]]. The founders of these denominations all studied with Emma Curtis Hopkins. Each of one these New Thought Churches has been influenced by a wide variety of ancient spiritual ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/ne/NewThoug.html "New Thought. The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001-07"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605040101/http://www.bartleby.com/65/ne/NewThoug.html |date=June 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these churches identify to different degrees with Christianity, Unity and Divine Science being the most explicit in the use of the Bible.

===The Christian Community===
[[The Christian Community]] is a movement for religious renewal. It was founded in 1922 in Switzerland by the Lutheran theologian and minister Friedrich Rittlemeyer, inspired by [[Rudolf Steiner]], the Austrian philosopher and founder of [[anthroposophy]]. Christian Community congregations exist as financially independent groups with regional and international administrative bodies overseeing their work. There are approximately 350 worldwide. The international headquarters are in Berlin, Germany.

The Christian Community does not require its members to conform to any specific teaching or behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Ravetz: ''Free From Dogma. Theological Reflections in The Christian Community.'' Edinburgh 2009
&lt;/ref&gt; Seven sacraments are celebrated within the Community: the [[Eucharist]], generally called the ''Act of Consecration of Man'', and six other sacraments: [[Baptism]], [[Confirmation]], [[Marriage]], The Last [[Anointing]], Sacramental Consultation (replacing [[Confession (religion)|Confession]]), and [[Ordination]].&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Francis Capel and Tom Ravetz, ''Seven Sacraments in the Christian Community'', Floris Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other movements===
Protestant denominations have shown a strong tendency towards diversification and fragmentation, giving rise to numerous churches and movements, especially in Anglo-American religious history, where the process is cast in terms of a series of "[[Great Awakening]]s".
The most recent wave of diversification, known as the [[Fourth Great Awakening]] took place during the 1960s to 1980s and resulted in phenomena such as the [[Charismatic Movement]], the [[Jesus movement]], and a great number of [[Parachurch organization]]s based in [[Evangelicalism]].

Many independent churches and movements considered themselves to be [[Nondenominational|non-denominational]], but may vary greatly in doctrine. Many of these, like the [[Local churches (affiliation)|local churches]] movement, reflect the core teachings of traditional Christianity. Others however, such as [[The Way International]], have been denounced as cults by the [[Christian anti-cult movement]].

Two movements, which are entirely unrelated in their founding, but share a common element of an additional Messiah (or incarnation of Christ) are the [[Unification Church]] and the [[Rastafari movement]]. These movements fall outside of traditional [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] of Christian groups, though both cite the Christian Bible as a basis for their beliefs.

[[Syncretism]] of Christian beliefs with local and tribal religions is a phenomenon that occurs throughout the world. An example of this is the [[Native American Church]]. The ceremonies of this group are strongly tied to the use of [[peyote]]. (Parallels may be drawn here with the Rastafari [[Entheogen|spiritual use]] of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].) While traditions vary from tribe to tribe, they often include a belief in Jesus as a Native American cultural hero, an intercessor for man, or a spiritual guardian; belief in the Bible; and an association of Jesus with peyote.

There are also some Christians that reject organized religion altogether. Some [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]] believe that the [[Ministry of Jesus|original teachings of Jesus]] were corrupted by Roman statism (compare [[Early Christianity]] and [[State church of the Roman Empire]]), and that earthly authority such as government, or indeed the established Church, do not and should not have power over them. Following "[[Ethic of reciprocity|The Golden Rule]]", many oppose the use of physical force in any circumstance, and advocate [[nonviolence]]. The Russian novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]] wrote ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kingdomnow.org/withinyou.html Leo Tolstoy - The Kingdom of God is Within You] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205200941/http://www.kingdomnow.org/withinyou.html |date=2012-02-05 }}. Kingdomnow.org. Retrieved on 2010-11-03.&lt;/ref&gt; and was a Christian anarchist.

The [[Community of Christ]] (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church)) and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) are two [[Christian denomination|denominations]] that share a common heritage in the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] founded by [[Joseph Smith]] on April 6, 1830. Since [[death of Joseph Smith|Smith's death]] in 1844, they have evolved separately in belief and practices. The LDS Church is headquartered in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], and claims more than 16 million members worldwide;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.lds.org/ensign/2014/05/saturday-afternoon-session/statistical-report-2013 |title=Statistical Report, 2013 |publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] |date=April 2014 |accessdate=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Community of Christ is headquartered in [[Independence, Missouri]], and reports a worldwide membership of approximately 250,000.&lt;ref name="Henderson2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henderson|first1=Garnet|title=Dissatisfied liberal Mormons find refuge in the Community of Christ|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/01/women-lgbt-mormons-community-of-christ|accessdate=9 May 2017|work=The Guardian|date=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community of Christ transformation since 1960==
Significant doctrinal, organizational, and attitudinal changes in the Community of Christ since 1960 have narrowed the similarities that remain between it and the LDS Church. While the doctrine and belief system of the LDS Church is highly centralized, systematic, and static, the Community of Christ has adopted an adaptive, decentralized, and progressive approach to doctrine. In 1997, the Community of Christ initiated a three-year period of transformation entitled “Transformation 2000,” that was seen by its president [[W. Grant McMurray]] as the culmination of a series of changes dating back to 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. Grant McMurray]], [http://www.cofchrist.org/docs/T2000/en/transfch.pdf "Transforming the Church"], 1998. {{dead link|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMurray identified these changes as a movement away from a belief that the denomination was "''the'' restored church" and towards a position within [[Mainline (Protestant)|mainstream Christianity]]. At the World Conference of 2000, by vote of 1,979 to 561, the name of the church was changed from the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints to Community of Christ. In so doing, the church was attempting to distance itself from comparisons with the LDS Church and in the process transform itself into a unique body among mainstream Christian denominations.

McMurray was the first president of the Community of Christ who was not a direct descendant of Joseph Smith. He sought to formalize developments in thinking about prophetic leadership, the historical basis of the [[Book of Mormon]], and the concept that [[priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] authority had been restored in the 1820s and 1830s after centuries of [[apostasy]]. During his presidency, the church moved from a [[closed communion|closed]] to an [[open communion]] and McMurray began to open the door to [[Ordination of LGBT Christian clergy|priesthood ordination for LGBT individuals]], something which he acknowledged was already occurring. At the time, negative membership response to this issue forced McMurray to reaffirm the official policy prohibiting the ordination of sexually active gays and lesbians. The church allowed those who were ordained against policy to continue in their priesthood offices. Since 2010, gay rights have been formalized in Community of Christ doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bycommonconsent.com/2010/04/15/gay-rights-revelation-added-to-dc-world-conference-part-2-april-12%E2%80%9315/ Gay Rights Revelation added to Community of Christ D&amp;C] Retrieved April 26, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1960, the RLDS Church's identity was primarily tied to its differences with the larger LDS Church, which RLDS Church members usually referred to as the "Utah Church" or "Mormon Church". McMurray cited a 1960 world tour by former president [[W. Wallace Smith]] as a pivotal event impacting the evolution of RLDS Church beliefs. Leaders such as [[Roy Cheville]] had already been teaching a new generation of church members a more ecumenical and open-minded system of beliefs. But it was the church's proselytizing of cultures in countries outside North America that knew little about Christianity, much less Mormonism, that forced a reassessment of denominational practices and beliefs. RLDS [[apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[Charles Neff]], a leading church missionary, pushed fellow leaders and field ministers towards a relativistic doctrinal viewpoint motivated by a combination of practical missionary concerns and an attitude of theological openness. These significant moves of the Community of Christ towards alignment with [[liberal Christianity|liberal Protestant]] doctrine were influenced in part by many in church leadership who pursued theological studies at [[St. Paul School of Theology]] in Kansas City, Missouri. While the RLDS Church had long been known for its strong anti-polygamy stance, its outreach efforts amongst the [[Sora people]] in India brought a re-examination even on this issue.

Church president [[Wallace B. Smith]]’s 1984 call for the ordination of women to the priesthood was a milestone in the doctrinal evolution of the church towards progressive Christianity. During his term in office, greater attention was brought to peace and justice issues. The call to dedicate the [[Independence Temple]] to the "pursuit of peace" is widely regarded as both symbolic and practical evidence of the differences between the two denominations. While the LDS Church has a set of highly standardized [[temple (LDS Church)|temple]] [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|rituals]] and regards temples as sacred space for the creation of [[covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenants]], the Community of Christ understands temples to be a less formalized center for spirituality, ministerial education, and church administration.

These changes constituted a broad shift in theology of the Community of Christ from [[Restorationism]] to mainline Protestant Christianity. They also widened the scope of long-standing doctrinal differences between it and the LDS Church. Nearly all of the traditional differences between the two groups can be seen as aligning the Community of Christ more closely with traditional Christian teaching and [[neo-orthodoxy]], which further isolates the LDS Church within Christianity as a whole.

==Historical differences between the churches==
{{main|Community of Christ history}}
The RLDS Church was founded by the confederation of a number of smaller groups that declined to migrate with [[Brigham Young]] to [[Utah Territory]] or follow any of the others vying to become the successor to Joseph Smith. Prior to the 1860 [[Amboy Conference]], in which the church was formally "reorganized" into the RLDS Church, numerous doctrinal differences were espoused by the leaders of the various splinter groups. Following the reorganization, these differences were solidified into a litany of what might now be called "[[wedge issue]]s" that would distinguish it from Young's LDS Church in Utah.&lt;ref name = EASmith&gt;[[Elbert A. Smith]], [http://www.centerplace.org/library/books/Differencesthatpersist.pdf ''Differences That Persist between the RLDS and LDS Churches''], (1950), website accessed 2008-06-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The differences enumerated below characterize the major differences between the Community of Christ and the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.mrm.org/rlds |title= LDS and RLDS (Community of Christ): Differences &amp; Similarities |authorlink= Bill McKeever |first= Bill |last= McKeever |work= MRM.org |publisher= Mormonism Research Ministry |accessdate= 2013-01-17 }} {{unreliable source?|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scriptures===
Both churches believe in an open canon of scripture founded upon the Bible, the [[Book of Mormon]], and revelations of God to the church recorded in the [[Doctrine and Covenants]].

====Bible====
The [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible|Inspired Version of the Bible]] is part of the Community of Christ's canon of scripture,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =  Brown | first =  Rich | title =  Web site of The Community of Christ - Sacrament - A Sacrament of Blessing and Promise | publisher =  Herald | url =  http://www.cofchrist.org/sacraments/blessing/blessing-brown.asp | accessdate =  3 September 2009 | archive-url =  https://archive.is/20120730035228/http://www.cofchrist.org/sacraments/blessing/blessing-brown.asp | archive-date =  2012-07-30 | dead-url =  yes | df =   }} Note: Paragraph 14 says “The unique teachings offered in the Inspired Version (Joseph Smith’s emendations of the King James translation of the Bible) add significantly to our theological understanding.”&lt;/ref&gt; although it does not mandate a single translation of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =  Euritt | first =  Mark | title =  Official Web site of The Community of Christ - Sacrament - The Sacrament of Ordination | publisher =  Herald | url =  http://www.cofchrist.org/sacraments/blessing/blessing-brown.asp | accessdate =  3 September 2009 | archive-url =  https://archive.is/20120730035228/http://www.cofchrist.org/sacraments/blessing/blessing-brown.asp | archive-date =  2012-07-30 | dead-url =  yes | df =   }} Note: Paragraph 3 refers to the King James Version (referred to as the Authorized Version of the Bible), the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV), and the New International Version (NIV) Bibles.&lt;/ref&gt;

The LDS Church has officially adopted the [[Authorized King James Version]] for English speakers, and has produced [[LDS edition of the Bible|its own edition]] which is extensively footnoted with clarifications from the Inspired Version. The LDS Church refers to the Inspired Version as the "Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible." For [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking members, the LDS Church publishes a slightly modified version of the [[Reina-Valera]] version, including footnotes and annotations comparable to those found in its official King James Version. For other languages, the LDS Church recommends usage of specific traditional translations that are selected based on doctrinal integrity with the other official [[standard works]].

====Book of Mormon====
[[File:The Book of Mormon- An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi.jpg|thumbnail|upright|right|alt= Book of Mormon (1830) | Title page of the first edition of the Book of Mormon (1830).]]

Both the Community of Christ and LDS Church accept the [[Book of Mormon]] as a second canon of scripture&lt;ref name = "Minutes"&gt;Andrew M. Shields, "Official Minutes of Business Session, Wednesday March 28, 2007," in 2007 World Conference Thursday Bulletin, March 29, 2007. Community of Christ, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and views it as an additional witness of Jesus Christ that complements the Bible. The Community of Christ publishes two versions of the book through its official publishing arm, [[Herald House]]. The Authorized Edition is based on the original printer's manuscript and the 1837 Second Edition (or "Kirtland Edition") of the Book of Mormon. Its content is similar to the Book of Mormon published by the LDS Church, but the versification is different&lt;ref name="Authorized"&gt;[http://www.heraldhouse.org/cart/edit.asp?p=125146 1966 "Revised Authorized Edition"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719124752/http://www.heraldhouse.org/cart/edit.asp?p=125146 |date=2011-07-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Community of Christ also publishes a 1966 "Revised Authorized Edition", which attempts to modernize some of the language.&lt;ref name = "Authorized"/&gt;

The LDS Church publishes a single version of the Book of Mormon, which is extensively footnoted to the church's other [[standard works]]. Its chapter and versification is based upon the 1879 edition edited by [[Orson Pratt]].

At a 2007 World Conference, Community of Christ President Stephen M. Veazey ruled that a resolution to "reaffirm the Book of Mormon as a divinely inspired record" was out of order.&lt;ref name = "Minutes"/&gt; He stated that "while the Church affirms the Book of Mormon as scripture, and makes it available for study and use in various languages, we do not attempt to mandate the degree of belief or use. This position is in keeping with our longstanding tradition that belief in the Book of Mormon is not to be used as a test of fellowship or membership in the church."&lt;ref name = "Minutes"/&gt; The LDS Church regularly emphasizes the importance of the Book of Mormon and encourages its members to read from it daily.

====Doctrine and Covenants====
{{main |Doctrine and Covenants}}
Both churches publish a book called the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] and accept it as scripture.&lt;ref name="CofCscriptures"&gt;{{Citation | title = Basic Beliefs: Scripture | publisher = Official Web site of The Community of Christ | url = http://www.cofchrist.org/OurFaith/faith-beliefs.asp | accessdate = 2 September 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120730151718/http://www.cofchrist.org/ourfaith/faith-beliefs.asp | archivedate = 30 July 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="LDSD&amp;C"&gt;{{Citation | title = Doctrine and Covenants of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints | publisher = Official Web site of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints | url = http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/contents | accessdate = 2 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Community of Christ has removed several early sections&lt;ref Name = "DC107"&gt;Community of Christ, Doctrine and Covenants - Doctrine and Covenants 107  [http://www.centerplace.org/hs/dc/rdc-107.htm see header]&lt;/ref&gt; and has regularly added new revelations and other inspired documents to the book since the death of Joseph Smith. The LDS Church removed what was [http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/doctrine-and-covenants-1835/259 Section 101] (the declaration on marriage which prohibited polygamy) in the 1835 edition of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] and added the [[wikisource:The_Doctrine_and_Covenants/Section_132|revelation on plural marriage]]. The LDS Church has added some material to the Doctrine and Covenants since Smith's death, but less than that of the Community of Christ. The Community of Christ version currently contains 166 documents, 51 of which were produced after the death of Joseph Smith. The LDS Church version currently contains 140 documents, five of which were produced after Smith's death.

====Pearl of Great Price====
{{main|Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)}}
The LDS Church includes the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]] as part of its [[standard works]]. The Community of Christ has never published or considered this book to be scripture.&lt;ref name = "CofCscriptures"/&gt; However, the Community of Christ does accept two portions of the Pearl of Great Price—the [[Book of Moses]] and [[Joseph Smith–Matthew]]—as scripture:
*Chapters 2–8 of the Book of Moses are included within the [[Book of Genesis]] in the Community of Christ's Inspired Version of the Bible;
* Chapter 1 of the Book of Moses is accepted as section 22 of the Community of Christ's Doctrine and Covenants;
* In addition to appearing in the Inspired Version of the Bible, chapter 7 of the Book of Moses is accepted as section 36 of the Community of Christ's Doctrine and Covenants; and
* [[Joseph Smith–Matthew]] is accepted as part of the [[Book of Matthew]] in the Inspired Version of the Bible.
Portions of the Pearl of Great Price that are not accepted as scripture by the Community of Christ are the [[Book of Abraham]], [[Joseph Smith–History]], and the [[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)|Articles of Faith]].

===Presidential tenure and succession===
{{main | Lineal succession (Latter Day Saints)}}
[[File:JosephSmith3.jpg|thumbnail|upright=.7|right|alt=Joseph Smith III | Joseph Smith III, the successor to Joseph Smith as the Prophet-President of the Community of Christ]]
Both the Community of Christ and the LDS Church are headed by a [[President of the Church]], a position created and held by [[Joseph Smith]]. In the LDS Church, succession to the presidency has been based on apostolic seniority. In the Community of Christ, the president has the power to appoint a successor; if the outgoing president does not appoint a successor, the [[Council of Twelve Apostles (Community of Christ)|Council of Twelve Apostles]] nominates a successor.

After Smith, the next three presidents of the Community of Christ served as President of the Church until their deaths. In 1978, [[W. Wallace Smith]] broke this tradition and retired from the presidency, designated himself as "president emeritus", and appointed [[Wallace B. Smith]] as his successor. Wallace B. Smith and his chosen successor—McMurray—also retired from the position. In the LDS Church, every President of the Church has served until his death and none have selected a successor prior to death.

Smith]] was the justification used by schismatic groups that abandoned the Community of Christ. This schism led to the creation of the [[Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]]. The president of the Remnant Church, [[Frederick Niels Larsen]], is a maternal great-great-grandson of Joseph Smith.

The LDS Church determines its presidential successor by principles of apostolic seniority combined with inspiration from God.&lt;ref name = "bTOP"&gt;[[Brent L. Top]] and Lawrence R. Flake, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1996/08/the-kingdom-of-god-will-roll-on-succession-in-the-presidency "'The Kingdom of God Will Roll On': Succession in the Presidency'], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', August 1996, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; When a church president dies, the member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] who has been an apostle the longest—the [[President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]]—becomes the new president of the church.&lt;ref name = "bTOP"/&gt; Prior to making the succession official, the apostles individually and collectively pray for divine guidance and confirmation of their proposed action.&lt;ref name = "bTOP"/&gt;

While this is an area that marked a traditional difference between the two denominations, a 2004–05 succession crisis prompted  the [[Council of Twelve Apostles (Community of Christ)|Council of Twelve Apostles]] of the Community of Christ to utilize an inspiration-seeking procedure similar to that adopted by the apostles of the LDS Church.&lt;ref name ="APNEW"&gt;{{Citation | author = Associated Press | title = Community of Christ selects new president | work =  | place = Independence, Missouri | pages =  | language =  | publisher =  | date = 7 March 2005 | url = http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,600117063,00.html | accessdate = 19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When McMurray stepped down as president in 2004, he chose not to name a successor, as previous retirees from the position had done.

===Godhead===

====Exaltation====
{{Main | Exaltation (LDS Church)}}
The LDS Church teaches the principle of [[exaltation (LDS Church)|exaltation]];&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Exaltation |contribution= Exaltation |last= Pope |first= Margaret McConkie |page= 479 |title= [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; this doctrine is not accepted by the Community of Christ.&lt;ref name = EASmith/&gt;

====Adam–God doctrine====
{{main | Adam–God doctrine}}
According to [[Brigham Young]], the Adam–God doctrine was first taught by [[Joseph Smith]] before his death in 1844. However, the evidence that Smith originated the doctrine consists only of Young's own assertions,&lt;!--FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Collier|1999|p=229 fn. 12}} (citing minutes of meeting of the Quorum of Twelve, 4 April 1860, in which it was recorded: "It was Joseph's doctrine that Adam was God… God comes to earth and eats and partakes of fruit. Joseph could not reveal what was revealed to him, and if Joseph had it revealed, he was not told to reveal it."). {{harvtxt|Collier|1999|p=360}} (citing Wilford Woodruff Journal of 4 September 1860, in which George Q. Cannon said "that Adam is our Father [and] is a true doctrine revealed from God to Joseph &amp; Brigham. For this same doctrine is taught in some of the old Jewish records which have never been in print...."). {{harvtxt|Collier|1999|p=367}} (citing Wilford Woodruff Journal of 16 December 1867, stating that "President Young said Adam was Michael the Archangel, &amp; he was the Father of Jesus Christ &amp; was our God &amp; that Joseph taught this principle.")&lt;/ref&gt; an 1877 recollection of [[Anson Call]],&lt;!--FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Collier|1999|p=233}} (citing an 1877 reminiscence of [[Anson Call]], who said he heard Joseph Smith say: "now regarding Adam: He came here from another planet [as] an immortalized being and brought his wife, Eve, with him, and by eating of the fruits of the earth became subject to death and decay and he became of the earth, earthly, was made mortal and subject to death.").&lt;/ref&gt; and some circumstantial evidence collected by [[Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalist]] writers.&lt;!--FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{harvtxt|Collier|1999|pp=228–42}} (a fundamentalist author, arguing that Joseph Smith believed and taught the doctrine).&lt;/ref&gt; LDS Church President [[Spencer W. Kimball]] officially denounced the Adam–God doctrine in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Conference Report, p. 115 (October 1–3, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spencer W. Kimball, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1976/11/our-own-liahona "Our Own Liahona"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', November 1976, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the Community of Christ was founded by the confederation of a number of smaller groups that declined to accept Young's leadership, the Adam–God doctrine has never been a part of Community of Christ teachings, and it has maintained that the doctrine was first enunciated by Young, not Smith.&lt;ref name = EASmith/&gt;

===Priesthood eligibility===
{{main | Priesthood (Community of Christ)|Priesthood (LDS Church)}}
{{see also |Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)}}

Both churches have a tradition of bestowing the priesthood on adult male members of the church. The priesthood of the Community of Christ has always been open to persons of all races,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cofchrist.org/seek/beliefs.asp Faith and Beliefs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070409095936/http://cofchrist.org/seek/beliefs.asp |date=2007-04-09 }}, webpage, retrieved June 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and was opened to women in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Community of Christ, Doctrine and Covenants Section 156:9C-D [http://www.centerplace.org/library/study/dc/rdc-156.htm] see 9C and 9D&lt;/ref&gt;  The LDS Church's priesthood is open to males only&lt;ref Name = "Official Declaration 2"&gt;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/od/2 "Official Declaration 2"], Doctrine and Covenants.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Why don’t women hold the priesthood in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints? | publisher = mormon.org | url = http://www.mormon.org/faq/women-in-the-church | accessdate = 13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the mid 1800s until 1978 was not open to people of [[Black people and Mormonism|black African descent]],.&lt;ref name = "Official Declaration 2"/&gt; The LDS Church routinely gives its [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic priesthood]] to boys 12 years of age and older, while the Community of Christ generally restricts its priesthood to adult men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Community of Christ, [http://www.latter-dayseekers.org/commonly-asked-questions.html "Commonly Asked Questions: What is the youngest age one may be called to priesthood?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222030250/http://www.latter-dayseekers.org/commonly-asked-questions.html |date=2013-02-22 }}, latter-dayseekers.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temples===
[[File:Community of Christ Temple located in Independence, Missouri.jpg|thumbnail|upright=.7|right|alt=[[Independence Temple]]|[[Independence Temple]] of the [[Community of Christ]] in Independence, Missouri.]]
{{main|Temple (Latter Day Saints)}}
{{see also |  Kirtland Temple}}
Both the Community of Christ and the LDS Church operate [[temple (Latter Day Saints)|temples]], which for both groups are separate and distinct from church chapels or meetinghouses. The Community of Christ operates two temples, the [[Kirtland Temple]] and the [[Independence Temple]], while the LDS Church has [[List of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|160]]&lt;ref&gt;{{LDS Temple status}}&lt;/ref&gt; operating temples.&lt;ref&gt;as of November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The Community of Christ does not practice and has traditionally objected to the idea of [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|sacraments or rituals]] being performed in its temples.&lt;ref name = EASmith/&gt; The Community of Christ's temples are open to the public&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Our Faith: Frequently Asked Questions: Do you perform sacraments in your Temple in Independence? |publisher=Official Web site of The Community of Christ |url=http://www.cofchrist.org/ourfaith/faq.asp |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20131021172827/http://www.cofchrist.org/ourfaith/faq.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 October 2013 |accessdate=3 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are dedicated to the pursuit of peace, spiritual learning, and church history and  administration. LDS Church temples are open only to approved members and are primarily used for the performance of rites such as the [[endowment (Mormonism)|endowment]], [[celestial marriage]], and [[baptism for the dead]]; these ordinances have never been embraced by the Community of Christ.&lt;ref name = EASmith/&gt;

Historically, the Community of Christ did include documents in its Doctrine and Covenants&lt;ref&gt;Community of Christ, Doctrine and Covenants [http://www.centerplace.org/hs/dc/ Sections 107, 109, 110, 113 and 123]&lt;/ref&gt; which sanctioned baptism for the dead and other temple rites.&lt;ref name = EASmith/&gt; However, the Community of Christ considers that the institution of baptism for the dead was made conditional on the completion of the [[Nauvoo Temple]] in a reasonable amount of time.&lt;ref name = "Baptism"&gt;Charles R. Hield and Russell F. Ralston, [http://www.centerplace.org/library/study/bap4dead.htm "Baptism for the Dead".]&lt;/ref&gt; Because the membership of the church failed to complete the temple during Smith's lifetime, the Community of Christ teaches that the right to perform baptisms for the dead was withdrawn and has not been reinstituted.&lt;ref name = "Baptism"/&gt;

The 1970 World Conference of the Community of Christ concluded that sections 107, 109, and 110 (regarding baptism for the dead and temple rites) had been added to the 1844 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants without proper [[common consent (Latter Day Saints)|approval]] of a church conference. Thus, the conference [[Doctrine and Covenants#Portions removed from the Community of Christ edition|removed]]&lt;ref Name = "DC107" /&gt; The World Conference of 1990 subsequently removed the entire appendix from the Doctrine and Covenants.&lt;ref Name = "DC107"/&gt;

===Use of cross and other symbols===
{{see also| Symbolism in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
The Community of Christ utilizes the symbol of the [[Christian cross]] on its buildings and temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cofchrist.org/visit/virtual/EXTcross.html |title=Official Web site of Community of Christ: Virtual Tour: Exterior Cross |access-date=2009-09-08 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20100417070331/http://www.cofchrist.org/visit/virtual/EXTcross.html |archive-date=2010-04-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The LDS Church currently does not use the cross&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Cross |contribution= Cross |last= Keller |first= Roger R. |authorlink= Roger R.

Most temples of the LDS Church include a statue of the [[Angel Moroni]] on a spire,&lt;ref&gt;Eight LDS temples do not have an angel Moroni (either in original design or added later). For list see [http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/articles/facts/ LDSChurchTemples.com: Interesting Facts: Angel Moroni Statues #1]&lt;/ref&gt; but the church does not consider Moroni to be an official symbol and "has no policy regarding the use of statues of the angel Moroni atop temples", but rather includes or excludes a statue from each temple based on local circumstances.&lt;ref name = "Greenwood"&gt;{{Citation | last = Greenwood | first = Val D. | journal = [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] | pages = 66–67 | date = July 1994 |title = I Have a Question: How long have statues of the angel Moroni appeared atop Latter-day Saint temples?

In the United States, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs emblems for headstones and markers|Veterans Affairs (VA) emblem for headstones]] for LDS Church members is a stylized Angel Moroni. For the Community of Christ, the VA emblem is a stylized representation of a child standing between a lion and a lamb, which is an official logo of the Community of Christ.

===Polygamy===
{{see also | Mormonism and polygamy | Origin of Latter Day Saint polygamy}}

In the 19th century, the differences between the LDS Church and the RLDS Church regarding polygamy was the principal distinction between the two churches. The LDS Church openly practiced plural marriage from 1852 to 1890 and taught that the practice was instituted by Joseph Smith and taught in secret to members of the church before his death. For many years, the leaders of the RLDS Church were vocal critics of the LDS Church's polygamy and argued that the practice had been introduced by [[Brigham Young]] and falsely attributed to Smith after Smith's death. Polygamy was frequently denounced by RLDS leaders and the practice was never accepted by the church.&lt;ref name="polyg"&gt;{{Citation |title=Our Faith: Frequently Asked Questions: What position does Community of Christ take on Joseph Smith's alleged involvement in polygamy? |publisher=Official Web site of The Community of Christ |url=http://www.cofchrist.org/ourfaith/faq.asp |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20131021172827/http://www.cofchrist.org/ourfaith/faq.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 October 2013 |accessdate=3 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's son [[Joseph Smith III]] and widow [[Emma Smith]] repeatedly taught that Smith opposed the practice and was not a polygamist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Whitmer|1887}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Times and Seasons]]'', volume 5, page [http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v5n03.htm 423], [http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v5n06.htm 474].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Millennial Star]]'' '''4''':144 (January 1844).&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, although the Community of Christ has no official position on whether Smith was a polygamist,&lt;ref name="polyg"/&gt; some members now accept the historical consensus that Smith [[List of the wives of Joseph Smith|had multiple wives]]. Some members have argued that Smith was wrong to introduce polygamy;&lt;ref name = "polyg"/&gt; in any case, most Community of Christ members continue to reject polygamy.&lt;ref name = EASmith/&gt;&lt;ref name = "polyg"/&gt; Today, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints opposes the practice of polygamy, its church presidents have repeatedly emphasized that the Church and its members are no longer authorized to enter into plural marriage.&lt;ref name="lds.org"&gt;https://www.lds.org/topics/plural-marriage-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints?lang=eng&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tithing===
Traditionally, the Community of Christ taught that [[Tithing (Latter Day Saints)|tithing]] should be calculated as one-tenth of a member's discretionary income.&lt;ref name="Path"&gt;[http://www.cofchrist.org/templeschool/Curriculum/te231.asp Stewardship: An Old Path Made New] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120724074130/http://www.cofchrist.org/templeschool/Curriculum/te231.asp |date=2012-07-24 }}, webpage, retrieved June 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The LDS Church teaches that it is ten percent of one's annual income,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= http://www.lds.org/topics/tithing |contribution= Tithing |title= Gospel Topics |publisher= LDS Church |url= https://www.lds.org/topics/tithing |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141112232154/https://www.lds.org/topics/tithing |archive-date= 2014-11-12 |dead-url= no }}&lt;/ref&gt; with it left to the member to determine how to calculate it (e.g., what constitutes "income" and whether it is ten percent of income after or before tax).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Tithing |contribution= Tithing |last= Swainston |first= Howard D. |pages= 1480–1482 |title= [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the Community of Christ has adopted a program known as Disciples' Generous Response, which encourages financial generosity as a response to God rather than as a set calculated obligation.&lt;ref name = "Path"/&gt;

===Apostasy and Restoration===
[[File:Joseph Smith first vision stained glass.jpg|right|thumb|[[Stained glass]] depiction of the first vision of [[Joseph Smith]], completed in 1913 by an unknown artist (LDS Museum of Church History and Art).]]
{{main|Restoration (Latter Day Saints)}}
The LDS Church teaches that Joseph Smith restored the fullness of the gospel after a centuries long period known as the [[Great Apostasy]].&lt;ref name = "Talmage"&gt;[[James E. Talmage]], ''[[The Great Apostasy (book)|The Great Apostasy]]'' (1909, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book) [https://books.google.com/books?id=yJn69K_Q0y0C]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Barker"&gt;''Apostasy from The Divine Church'' by [[James L. Barker]]&lt;/ref&gt; The LDS Church therefore characterizes itself as a restoration of fallen Christianity and the [[one true church]] that exists.&lt;ref name = "Talmage"/&gt; In contrast, the Community of Christ has de-emphasized its traditional tenet that it is the one true church and has adopted a viewpoint that all faith traditions can offer a pathway to [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|spiritual enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Basic Beliefs: The Church | publisher = Official Web site of The Community of Christ | url = http://www.cofchrist.org/OurFaith/faith-beliefs.asp | accessdate = 2 September 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120730151718/http://www.cofchrist.org/ourfaith/faith-beliefs.asp | archivedate = 30 July 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara McFarlane Higdon has called the Community of Christ a "unique member of the body of Christ, the universal community of believers."&lt;ref&gt;Higdon, Barbara McFarlane, "Faith and Beliefs: The Church," ''Herald'', September 2006, p. 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Higdon also suggests that prior claims that the church had been "restored" were tantamount to idolatry. The Community of Christ has therefore moved towards [[ecumenism]] and inter-faith dialogue. Nevertheless, the Community of Christ "steadfastly affirms the primacy of continuing revelation instead of creedal rigidity". The Community of Christ's Doctrine and Covenants continues to contain documents that declare that the church is the one true church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerplace.org/hs/dc/rdc-001.htm Community of Christ, Doctrine and Covenants Section 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the [[Community of Christ]] generally refers to Joseph Smith's [[First Vision]] as the "grove experience" and takes a flexible view about its historicity,&lt;ref&gt;According to its website, the church "does not legislate or mandate positions on issues of history. We place confidence in sound historical methodology as it relates to our church story. We believe that historians and other researchers should be free to come to whatever conclusions they feel are appropriate after careful consideration of documents and artifacts to which they have access. We benefit greatly from the significant contributions of the historical discipline."

'''Curley Headed Doctor''' [sic] ([[Modoc language|Modoc]]: ''Cho-ocks'', 1828 — 1890) was the spiritual leader for the [[Modoc people|Modoc]] tribe, notably during the [[Modoc War]] troubles.

==Background==
Curley Headed Doctor was Modoc from [[California]]. While initially a proponent of peaceful coexistence with the white settlers in the area, Curley Headed Doctor came to stand for Modoc independence as a means to preserve religious beliefs and traditions. He learned the [[Ghost Dance]] from a [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] Indian.&lt;ref name="thrapp"&gt;Thrapp, Dan L. ''Encyclopedia of Frontier Biography, Volume 1: A-F.'' Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to encroachment by American gold prospectors and ranchers, leaders of his tribe ceded their traditional homelands to settle on a reservation in [[Oregon]], jointly occupied by the [[Klamath people|Klamath]] and [[Yahooskin]] Band of [[Snake Indians]] in 1864. Reservation life was difficult for the Modoc, due to a neglectful and corrupt Indian and continually harassment by the Klamath. The leader of Curley Headed Doctor's band, known as the Hot Creeks, was [[Captain Jack (Native American)|Captain Jack]]. Captain Jack led the band back to their ancestral homelands in California. The US Army responded violently.&lt;ref name="mod"&gt;Scruggs, Patrica. [http://www.modoctribe.net/history.html The History of the Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma.] 2009 (10 Feb 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modoc Wars and removal==
During the [[Battle of Lost River]] on November 29, 1872, Curley Headed Doctor led dances to support Modoc warriors. Detractors of the medicine man accused him of having, "used magic and fanaticism to support the followers of Jack."&lt;ref name="thrapp"/&gt; Due to his involvement, Curley Headed Doctor was indicted by an [[Oregon]] grand jury but not tried.&lt;ref name="thrapp"/&gt;

He is credited with raising the fog in the area that protected the tribe during the [[First Battle of the Stronghold]] in January 1873,&lt;ref&gt;David, Eric. [http://www.techgnosis.com/chunkshow-single.php?chunk=chunkfrom-2008-09-25-1733-0.txt Captain Jack's Stronghold: Ghost Dancing.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709065127/http://www.techgnosis.com/chunkshow-single.php?chunk=chunkfrom-2008-09-25-1733-0.txt |date=2009-07-09 }} 25 Sept 2008 (10 Feb 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and leading them in the Ghost Dance to protect and save them from extinction. He urged the assassination of the Peace Commissioners but did not physically harm them.&lt;ref name="thrapp"/&gt;

After the Modoc surrendered, he was spared by the [[US Government]] and deported to [[Indian Territory]] with the survivors of [[Captain Jack (Native American)|Captain Jack]]'s band, who would become the [[Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma]]. Curley Headed Doctor died in [[Oklahoma]].

==Family==
His son-in-law was [[Hooker Jim]], a Modoc warrior who played a pivotal role in the Modoc War.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/archive/labe/content/HISTORY_War.htm The Modoc war: a Brief History], www.nps.gov, date unknown (accessed 2 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/labe/chap2.htm A very tired lot of soldiers], Modoc War, 1971, Argus Books (accessed 2 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1652">In [[social theory]], '''detraditionalization''' refers to the erosion of [[tradition]] in religion ([[Secularization]], [[agnosticism]], [[Religious disaffiliation]]) and society in ([[postmodernism|post]])[[modernism]].

Traditional societies belief in established, timeless, authoritative orders and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], above the [[individual]], and timeless attainable goals.

Factors that contribute to ''loss of tradition'' are endorsement of individual [[choice]] and responsibility or the "sacred" (in [[Émile Durkheim]]'s sense of the term) individual itself in [[democracy|democratic]] societies, and the revolution in [[Information and communications technology|communications]]. Among the theorists who believe that society is [[social change|moving]] from a modernity that has been largely traditional to a post-traditional time is [[Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens]].

Monsignor '''Ernest Jouin''' (21 December 1844 – 27 June 1932) was a [[French people|French]] [[traditional Catholic|Catholic]] priest and essayist, known for his promotion of the [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory]]. He also published the first French edition of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''.&lt;ref name="Marks"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marks |first1=Steven Gary |title=How Russia Shaped the Modern World: From Art to Anti-semitism, Ballet to Bolshevism |date=2003 |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
In 1912, Jouin founded the ''Ligue Franc-Catholique''. The league's journal, the ''Revue internationale des sociétés secrètes'', was one of the two main [[anti-Semitic]] tribunes of the interwar period, along with the paper of the [[Action Française]], and often published right-wing Russian accusations that Jews engaged in ritual murder and that [[Bolshevism]] was a Judeo-Masonic plot.&lt;ref name="Marks" /&gt; Describing the ''Protocols'', Jouin wrote: "From the triple viewpoint of race, of nationality, and of religion, the Jew has become the enemy of humanity."&lt;ref name="Michael"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=R. |title=A History of Catholic Antisemitism: The Dark Side of the Church |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Benedict XV]] made Jouin an [[Honorary Prelate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McElligott |first1=Anthony |title=Antisemitism Before and Since the Holocaust: Altered Contexts and Recent Perspectives |date=2017 |publisher=Springer |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Pius XI]] praised Jouin for "combating our mortal [Jewish] enemy" and appointed him to high papal office as a [[protonotary apostolic]].&lt;ref name="Marks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael" /&gt;

The '''First Battle of Anandpur'''  was fought between the [[Mughal Empire]] and the [[Sikhs]] in 1704.

==The Battle==

The Mughals were defeated in the [[First Battle of Chamkaur (1702)]] therefore the Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]] sent a huge force under General Ramjan Khan to [[Anandpur Sahib|Anandpur]]. General Sayyid Khan was replaced by General Ramjan Khan.Ramjan khan besieged the fort of Anandpur and the battle starts.In the battle, Ramjan Khan was severely wounded against the Guru at the well militarised fort of Anandpur Sahib. Hence, seeing all failure of the efforts the mughal forces were forcefully repulsed by the Sikhs.

'''''God is Red: A Native View of Religion''''', by [[Vine Deloria, Jr.]] ([[Standing Rock Sioux]]), is a [[nonfiction]] [[book]] that discusses traditional [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] religious views, particularly their relation to Western [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=tinker&gt;Tinker, George E. [http://www.ecologicalhope.org/book-reviews/god-is-red-a-native-view-of-religion-30th-anniversary-edition/ "''God is Red: A Native View of Religion'', 30th Anniversary Edition."] ''Spirituality and Ecological Hope.'' 27 June 2008 (retrieved 31 Aug 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; It also details the hardships faced by Native Americans as their country was quickly flooded with foreigners eager for land and other resources. Deloria links the [[anthropocentrism]] of Christian orthodoxy and subsequent American economic philosophies with increasing environmental upheaval. Deloria also explains how religious views are rooted to "place" as opposed to being universal.&lt;ref name=tinker/&gt;

The book was first published in 1972, then 1992, and 2003.&lt;ref name=tinker/&gt;

The '''Goranchacha Temple''' (Spanish: ''Templo de Goranchacha'') is an archeological site of the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] located in the city of [[Tunja]], [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]], which in the time of the [[Muisca Confederation]] was called Hunza. The temple is named after the [[Muisca mythology|mythological]] [[Goranchacha]]. The remains of the temple are located on the terrain of the [[Pedagogical and Technological University of Colombia]] in Tunja. [[List of Muisca scholars|Scholar]] [[Javier Ocampo López]] has written about the temple and its [[Muisca religion|religious meaning]].&lt;ref name=Ocampo_p81&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.13, p.81&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge about the temple has been provided by chronicler [[Pedro Simón]].&lt;ref name=PueblosGoranchacha&gt;{{es}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/sur/caribe/muisca/goranchacha.html Goranchacha] - Pueblos Originarios&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
During the time before the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca]], the central highlands of the Colombian [[Andes]] ([[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]]) were populated by the Muisca. This advanced civilization had its own religion and rituals, centered around the most important deities Sué and Chía. The northern territories were ruled by the ''[[iraca]]'' of [[Sogamoso|Sugamuxi]], the ''[[tundama]]'' of [[Duitama|Tundama]] and the ''[[zaque]]'' based in Hunza.

Goranchacha was a mythical ''[[cacique]]'' who moved the capital of the northern Muisca from [[Ramiriquí]] to Hunza and was feared by the people, ruling as a dictator.&lt;ref name=Ocampo_p81/&gt;&lt;ref name=TiempoTunja&gt;{{es}} [http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-382428 Tunja, legendária y culta] - [[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The Goranchacha Temple was allegedly constructed of two circular structures of rocks, reed and wood, transported from the farthest regions of the [[Muisca Confederation]]. In the centre was placed a column to support the roof.&lt;ref name=PueblosGoranchacha/&gt; Goranchacha ordered the temple to be built to worship his father; [[Sué]], the God of the Sun. The ''cacique'' organised pilgrimages to the temple passing over painted cotton mantles and adorned with flower petals.&lt;ref name=MitosTunja&gt;{{es}} [http://eutimioreyesmanosalva.jimdo.com/libros-e-r-m/leyendas-mitos-espantos-y-romer%C3%ADas-de-tunja/ Leyendas, mitos, espantos y romerías de Tunja]&lt;/ref&gt; At the temple [[tunjo|offerings]] were made.&lt;ref name=PueblosGoranchacha/&gt;

Pedro Simón wrote about the temple:&lt;ref name=PueblosGoranchacha/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Cerca de las postreras casas del pueblo a la parte del norte donde ahora llaman las cuadras de Porras, hizo edificar un templo a su padre el Sol donde lo hacía venerar con frecuentes sacrificios..."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Close to the farthest houses of the village in the northern part where today it's called Porras quarter, he ordered the construction of a temple to his father, the Sun, where he venerated him with frquent sacrifices..." 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The location of the temple was found using this description in 1937 by Colombian [[archaeologist]] Gregorio Hernández de Alba (1904–1973). He excavated the site.&lt;ref name=PueblosGoranchacha/&gt;
&lt;ref name=PueblosGoranchacha/&gt;&lt;ref name=BancoSantuario&gt;{{es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/node/26259 Arqueología del cercado grande de los santuarios - 9] - [[Banco de la República]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the remains of the temple are part of the [[Pedagogical and Technological University of Colombia|Universidad Pedagógica y Tecnológica de Colombia]] in Tunja.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6153">'''Atheism''', or '''Irreligion in Indonesia''', is uncommon among the country's inhabitants, as there is a great [[Social stigma|stigma]] attached to being an atheist in [[Indonesia]] and is widely condemned by the Indonesian people.

==Society==
It is difficult to quantify the number of atheists or agnostics in [[Indonesia]] as they are not officially counted in the census of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Commentary: Is there room for atheists in Indonesia?| publisher= [[The Jakarta Globe]]| date= | url= http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/06/18/commentary-is-there-room-atheists-indonesia.html| accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Indonesian atheists, such as those belonging to the [[Indonesian Atheists]] organization, predominantly communicate with each other solely via the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= The Rise of Indonesian Atheism| publisher= The Jakarta Globe| date= | url= http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/archive/the-rise-of-indonesian-atheism/410166/| accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Human Rights Watch]], tolerance towards atheists among the general Indonesian public is growing, but they are still subject to violence by "largely militant Islamists."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news | title= For Indonesian Atheists, a Community of Support Amid Constant Fear| publisher= The New York Times| date= 2013-04-26| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/27/world/asia/26iht-indonesia26.html?pagewanted=all| accessdate=2013-09-18| first=Sara| last=Schonhardt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discrimination===
{{More information|Discrimination against atheists in Indonesia}}
{{See also|Islam in Indonesia#Religious freedom}}
[[Atheists]] are subject to discrimination in Indonesia, seeing as irreligion violates the first principle of [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] (the Indonesian constitution). Religious tolerance in Indonesia is limited to muted acceptance of other religions apart from Islam. Indonesian atheist activists are pursuing their religious freedom.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/03/indonesia-atheists-religious-freedom-aan | title=Indonesia's atheists face battle for religious freedom | publisher=The Guardian | accessdate=November 7, 2012 | location=London | first=Kate | last=Hodal | date=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==
Freedom of religion is enshrined in the Indonesian Constitution; however legal protection is only afforded only to six official faiths of the country—[[Islam]], [[Protestantism]], [[Catholicism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Confucianism]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; B. F. Intan has written that ''[[natural law]]'' does not require one to follow a particular religion. Atheism as he sees it, however, is used more as an example of harmony between various religions and is not used as grounds to denounce popular religion.&lt;ref name="Intan2006"&gt;{{cite book| author=Benyamin Fleming Intan| title="Public Religion" and the Pancasila-Based State of Indonesia: An Ethical and Sociological Analysis| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXmRwiYEy1IC&amp;pg=PA160| accessdate=7 November 2012| year=2006| publisher=Peter Lang| isbn=978-0-8204-7603-2| page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; This natural law is used as grounds for the creation of a [[common law]], which is more usually employed elsewhere as the basis for laws governing criminal activity or civil disputes.&lt;ref name="Intan2006"/&gt;

===Blasphemy===
{{Main|Blasphemy law in Indonesia}}
{{See also|Freedom of religion in Indonesia#Recent examples of abuses}}
Insulting or interfering with the practice of one of the official faiths stated above in Indonesia can bring a five-year prison term.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; In the past, prominent atheists have only been prosecuted under religious customary laws, so it is unknown if atheism is actually prosecutable under secular law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |title= Raising Kids Without God: Atheist Parents in Indonesia |publisher= The Jakarta Globe| date= | url= http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/features/raising-kids-without-god-atheist-parents-in-indonesia/| accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= No Need to Believe: Indonesia’s Atheists| publisher= The Jakarta Globe| date= | url= http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/archive/no-need-to-believe-indonesias-atheists/492147/| accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Commentary: Is there room for atheists in Indonesia?| publisher= The Jakarta Post| date= | url= http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/06/18/commentary-is-there-room-atheists-indonesia.html| accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

When declared atheist [[Alexander Aan]] wrote in February 2012 (on [[Facebook]]) that God does not exist, he was taken into custody and initially charged with [[blasphemy]]. The police claimed that they were doing this to protect him from attackers, however, no charges have been levied against his attackers.  He has been prosecuted under blasphemy law,  blasphemy by its Criminal Code. The Code’s Article 156(a) targets those who deliberately, in public, express feelings of hostility, hatred, or contempt against religions with the purpose of preventing others from adhering to any religion, and targets those who disgrace a religion. The penalty for violating Article 156(a) is prisonment, Presidential Decree No. 1/PNPS/1965 on the Prevention of Blasphemy and Abuse of Religions.&lt;ref name="jakartapost"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/06/18/commentary-is-there-room-atheists-indonesia.html | title=Commentary: Is there room for atheists in Indonesia? | publisher=The Jakarta Post | accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident raised a debate about the legality of atheism versus treating it as a genuine religion.&lt;ref name="jakaglobe"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/opinion/is-atheism-illegal-in-indonesia/496337#Scene_1 | title=Wed, November 7, 2012 | publisher=THE JAKARTA GLOBE | accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jacopo Amigoni''' (1682–1752), also named '''Giacomo Amiconi''', was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Painting|painter]] of the late-[[Baroque]] or [[Rococo]] period, who began his career in [[Venice]], but traveled and was prolific throughout Europe, where his sumptuous [[portrait]]s were much in demand.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Naples]] or Venice. Amigoni initially painted both mythological and religious scenes; but as the panoply of his patrons expanded northward, he began producing many parlour works depicting gods in sensuous languor or games. His style influenced [[Giuseppe Nogari]]. Among his pupils were [[Charles Joseph Flipart]], [[Michelangelo Morlaiter]], [[Pietro Antonio Novelli]], [[Joseph Wagner (engraver)|Joseph Wagner]], and [[Antonio Zucchi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANFullDisplay?find=&amp;role=&amp;nation=&amp;subjectid=500016473  Getty Museum Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1717, he is documented as working in [[Bavaria]] in the [[Nymphenburg Palace|Castle of Nymphenburg]] (1719); in the [[Schleissheim Palace|castle of Schleissheim]] (1725–1729); and in the [[Ottobeuren Abbey|Benedictine abbey]] of [[Ottobeuren]]. He returned to Venice in 1726. His ''Arraignment of Paris'' hangs in the [[Villa Pisani]] at [[Stra]]. From 1730 to 1739 he worked in [[England]], in  [[Pown House]], [[Moor Park (house)|Moor Park]] [[Wolterton Hall]] and in the Theatre of Covent Garden. From there, he helped convince [[Canaletto]] to travel to England by telling him of the ample patronage available. 

From his travel to [[Paris]] in 1736, he met the celebrated [[castrato]] [[Farinelli]]. Later in Madrid, he was to paint a self-portrait with the singer and entourage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/european/em_ipa00014.html  Farinelli and friends]&lt;/ref&gt; He also encountered the painting of [[François Lemoyne]] and [[François Boucher|Boucher]]. 

In 1739 he returned to Italy, perhaps to Naples and surely to [[Montecassino]], in whose Abbey existed two canvases (destroyed during World War II). Until 1747, he travelled to Venice to paint for [[Sigismund Streit]], for the [[Casa Savoia]] and other buildings of the city. In 1747 he left Italy and established himself in Madrid. There he became court painter to [[Ferdinand VI of Spain]] and director of the Royal Academy of Saint Fernando. He died in Madrid.

Amigoni was the father of the pastellist [[Caterina Amigoni Castellini]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pastellists.com/Articles/Amigoni.pdf Profile of Caterina Amigoni Castellini] in the ''Dictionary of Pastellists Before 1800''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ShabbatcandlesC.jpg|thumb|Candles are lit on the eve of the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath:)("Shabbat"]]) and Jewish holidays.]]
'''Jewish holidays''', also known as '''Jewish festivals''' or '''''Yamim Tovim''''' ({{big|{{lang|he|ימים טובים}}}}, "Good Days", [[Grammatical number|or singular]] {{big|{{lang|he|יום טוב}}}} '''''Yom Tov''''', in [[Romanization of Hebrew|transliterated]] [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [{{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|j|ɔː|m|_|ˈ|t|ɔː|v|,_|j|oʊ|m|_|ˈ|t|oʊ|v}}]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/yom+tov "yom tov"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; are holidays observed in [[Judaism]] and by [[Jews]]&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;This article focuses on practices of mainstream [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. [[Karaite Judaism#The calendar|Karaite Jews]] and [[Samaritans#Samaritanism|Samaritans]] also observe the biblical festivals, but not in an identical fashion and not always at exactly the same time.&lt;/ref&gt; throughout the [[Hebrew calendar]]. They include religious, cultural and national elements, derived from three sources: [[Hebrew Bible|Biblical]] ''[[Mitzvah|mitzvot]]'' ("commandments"); [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinic mandates]]; [[Jewish history]] and the [[Israel#Independence and first years|history of the State of Israel]].

Jewish holidays occur on the same dates every year in the Hebrew calendar, but the dates vary in the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]]. This is because the Hebrew calendar is a [[lunisolar calendar]] (''i.e.'', based on the cycles of both the sun and moon), whereas the Gregorian is a [[solar calendar]].

==General concepts==

===Groupings===
Certain terms are used very commonly for groups of holidays.
* The Hebrew-language term ''Yom Tov'' (יום טוב), sometimes referred to as "festival day," usually refers to the six Biblically-mandated festival dates on which all [[#work|activities prohibited on Shabbat]] are prohibited, except for some related to food preparation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', Moshe ben Maimon, vol. 1, Jerusalem, 1974, s.v. ''Shevitat Yom-Tov'' 1:1 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; These include the first and seventh days of [[#Pesach—Passover|Passover]], [first day of] [[#Shavuot—Feast of Weeks—Yom HaBikurim|Shavuot]], both days of [[#Rosh Hashanah|Rosh Hashanah]], first day of [[#Sukkot—Feast of Booths (or Tabernacles)|Sukkot]], and [first day of] [[#Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah|Shemini Atzeret]]. By extension, outside the [[Land of Israel]], the second-day holidays known under the rubric ''[[#2days|Yom tov sheni shel galuyot]]'' (literally, "Second ''Yom Tov'' of the Diaspora") are also included in this grouping. Colloquially, [[#Yom Kippur—Day of Atonement|Yom Kippur]], a Biblically-mandated date on which even food preparation is prohibited, is often included in this grouping. The tradition of keeping two days of Yom Tov in the diaspora has existed since roughly 300 BCE.
* The English-language term [[High Holy Days]] (or High Holidays) refers to [[#Rosh Hashanah|Rosh Hashanah]] and [[#Yom Kippur—Day of Atonement|Yom Kippur]] collectively. Its Hebrew analogue, ''[[Yamim Nora'im]]'' (ימים נוראים), "Days of Awe”, is more flexible: it can refer just to those holidays, or to the [[#Aseret Yemei Teshuva—Ten Days of Repentance|Ten Days of Repentance]], or to the entire penitential period, starting as early as the beginning of [[Elul]], and (more rarely) ending as late as [[Shemini Atzeret]].
* The term [[Three Pilgrimage Festivals]] (שלוש רגלים, ''shalosh regalim'') refers to [[#Pesach—Passover|Passover]], [[#Shavuot—Feast of Weeks—Yom HaBikurim|Shavuot]] and [[#Sukkot—Feast of Booths (or Tabernacles)|Sukkot]]. Within this grouping Sukkot normally includes [[#Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah|Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah]].

===Terminology used to describe holidays===
Certain terminology is used in referring to different categories of holidays, depending on their source and their nature:

''[[#Shabbat—The Sabbath|Shabbat]]'' (שבת) ([[Ashkenazi]] pron. from [[Yiddish]] ''shabbos''), or Sabbath, is referred to by that name exclusively. Similarly, ''[[#Rosh Chodesh—The New Month|Rosh Chodesh]]'' (ראש חודש) is referred to by that name exclusively.
*{{anchor|yomtov}}''Yom tov'' (יום טוב) (Ashkenazi pron. from Yid. ''yontif'') (''lit.,'' "good day"): See "[[#Groupings|Groupings]]" above.
* ''Moed'' (מועד) ("festive season"), plural ''moadim'' (מועדים), refers to any of the [[Three Pilgrimage Festivals]] of Passover, Shavuot and Sukkot. When used in comparison to ''Yom Tov,'' it refers to [[Chol HaMoed]], the intermediate days of Passover and Sukkot.
* ''Ḥag'' or ''chag'' (חג) ("festival"), plural ''chagim'' (חגים), can be used whenever ''yom tov'' or ''moed'' is. It is also used to describe [[#Hanukkah—Festival of Lights|Hanukkah]] and [[#Purim—Festival of Lots|Purim]], as well as ''[[#Yom Ha'atzmaut—Israel Independence Day|Yom Ha'atzmaut]]'' (Israeli Independence Day) and ''[[#Yom Yerushalayim—Jerusalem Day|Yom Yerushalayim]]'' (Jerusalem Day).
* ''Ta'anit'' (תענית), or, less commonly, ''tzom'' (צום), refers to a ''fast''. These terms are generally used to describe the rabbinic fasts, although ''tzom'' is used liturgically to refer to Yom Kippur as well.&lt;ref&gt;See text from the Yom Kippur [[liturgy]] available at [[Unetanneh Tokef#He Judges Us|Unetanneh Tokef (He Judges Us)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|work}}"Work" on Sabbath and biblical holidays===
{{Main article|Melacha}}
The most notable common feature of Shabbat and the Biblical festivals is the requirement to refrain from ''melacha'' on these days.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;This "negative" (refraining) requirement is paired with a positive requirement to honor and enjoy the Sabbath or festival day.  For information on the positive requirements, see [[Shabbat#Rituals|Shabbat: Rituals]] and [[Shabbat#Encouraged activities|Shabbat: Encouraged activities]].&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Melacha'' is most commonly translated as "work"; perhaps a better translation is "creative-constructive work".  Strictly speaking, ''Melacha'' is defined in [[halacha|Jewish law ''(halacha)'']] by [[melacha#Definition|39 categories of labor]] that were used in constructing the [[Tabernacle]] while the Jews wandered in the desert. As understood traditionally and in [[Orthodox Judaism]]:
*On Shabbat and [[Yom]] Kippur all ''melacha'' is prohibited.
*On a Yom Tov (other than Yom Kippur) which falls on a weekday, not Shabbat, most ''melacha'' is prohibited. Some ''melacha'' related to preparation of food is permitted.{{refn|group=Note|Carrying items needed for the holiday in a public domain—more technically, [[Melacha#Transferring between domains|transferring items between domains]]—is considered to be a ''melacha'' related to food preparation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Beitza]] 12a and {{cite wikisource|wslink=Translation:Shulchan Aruch/Orach Chaim/495|title=Shulchan Aruch OC 495:1|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=Note|Burials are also permitted on a yom tov, although not on Shabbat nor Yom Kippur. On the first day of yom tov, burial is prohibited unless the bulk of the associated ''melacha'' is done by non-Jews. On the second day of yom tov, including Rosh Hashanah, burial is permitted even if the bulk of the associated ''melacha'' is done by Jews. In modern times, it is extremely unusual for a yom tov burial to occur, except on the second day of Rosh Hashanah in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Beitza]] 6a and [[Igrot Moshe]] OC III, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Further details are beyond the scope of this article.}}
*On weekdays during Chol HaMoed, ''melacha'' is not prohibited ''per se.'' However, ''melacha'' should be limited to that required either to enhance the enjoyment of the remainder of the festival or to avoid great financial loss.
*On other days, there are no restrictions on ''melacha.''&lt;ref group=Note&gt;There is a practice for women to refrain from some types of labor on Rosh Chodesh; see [[Rosh Chodesh#Rosh Chodesh and women|Rosh Chodesh and women]].&lt;/ref&gt;
In principle, [[Conservative Judaism]] understands the requirement to refrain from ''melacha'' in the same way as Orthodox Judaism.  In practice, Conservative rabbis frequently rule on prohibitions around ''melacha'' differently from Orthodox authorities.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{Citation|last=Nevins|first=Daniel|title=The Use of Electrical and Electronic Devices on Shabbat|url=http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/sites/default/files/public/halakhah/teshuvot/2011-2020/electrical-electronic-devices-shabbat.pdf|accessdate=October 23, 2012}}, as an illustration both on general concepts and on specific rulings.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, there are a number of Conservative/Masorti communities around the world where Sabbath and Festival observance fairly closely resembles Orthodox observance.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;This is especially, though not exclusively, true outside the US.  For example, Masorti Judaism in Israel and the UK rejects North American Conservatism's position to permit [[Driving on Shabbat#Conservative|driving to synagogue on Shabbat]].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many, if not most, lay members of Conservative congregations in North America do not consider themselves [[Shomer Shabbat|Sabbath-observant]], even by Conservative standards.&lt;ref&gt;This is widely recognized as true. The best objective source is probably ''Jewish Identity and Religious Commitment: The North American Study of Conservative Synagogues and Their Members, 1995–96,'' edited by [[Jack Wertheimer]], 1997, Ratner Center for the Study of Conservative Judaism. But reliable, updated figures are difficult to come by.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, adherents of [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] do not accept ''halacha'', and therefore restrictions on ''melacha,'' as binding at all.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;See, for example, [[Reform Judaism#Reform Judaism's Position on Jewish Law|Reform Judaism's Position on Jewish Law]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism#Jewish law and tradition|Reconstructionist Judaism (Jewish Law and Tradition)]], and references in those articles.&lt;/ref&gt; Jews fitting any of these descriptions refrain from ''melacha'' in practice only as they personally see fit.

Shabbat and holiday work restrictions are always put aside in cases of ''[[pikuach nefesh]],'' which is saving a human life. At the most fundamental level, if there is any possibility whatsoever that action must be taken to save a life, Shabbat restrictions are set aside immediately, and without reservation.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The Babylonian Talmud (see at ''[[Sotah (Talmud)|Sotah]] 20-21'') describes one who fails to do so as a ''chasid shoteh,'' a foolishly pious individual.&lt;/ref&gt;  Where the danger to life is present but less immediate, there is some preference to minimize violation of Shabbat work restrictions where possible. &lt;!--Where the danger to life is not so pressing, then the preference for preservation of life would not be preserved otherwise. Otherwise, normal life indicates that normal laws should be followed, except in emergency cases; for example, in clinical emergency cases. --&gt;The laws in this area are complex.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yeshiva University|YU]] Torah ''shiurim'' on ''Pikuach Nefesh:'' [http://www.yutorah.org/_shiurim/Pikuach%20Nefesh%20Part%20I.html Part I], [http://www.yutorah.org/_shiurim/Pikuach%20Nefesh%20Part%20II.html Part II], and [http://www.yutorah.org/_shiurim/Pikuach%20Nefesh%20Part%20III.html Part III], accessed July 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|2days}}Second day of biblical festivals===
{{Main article|Yom tov sheni shel galuyot}}
The Torah specifies a single date on the Jewish calendar for observance of holidays. Nevertheless, festivals of Biblical origin other than Shabbat and Yom Kippur are observed for two days outside the [[land of Israel]], and Rosh Hashanah is observed for two days even inside the land of Israel.

Dates for holidays on the Jewish calendar are expressed in the Torah as "day x of month y." Accordingly, the beginning of ''month y'' needs to be determined before the proper date of the holiday on ''day x'' can be fixed. Months in the Jewish calendar are [[lunar month|lunar]], and originally were proclaimed by the blowing of a ''[[shofar]]''. Later, the [[Sanhedrin]] received testimony of witnesses saying they saw the new crescent moon.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Similar practices are still used in [[Islamic calendar|Islam]] as well as in the [[Karaite Judaism#The calendar|Karaite]] and [[Samaritan]] communities.&lt;/ref&gt; Then the Sanhedrin would inform Jewish communities away from its meeting place that it had proclaimed a new moon. The practice of observing a second festival day stemmed from delays in disseminating that information.&lt;ref&gt;See, in general, [[Rambam]], ''[[Mishnah Torah]], Kiddush HaChodesh,'' Chapters 3 and 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Rosh Hashanah.'' Because of holiday restrictions on travel, messengers could not even leave the seat of the Sanhedrin until the holiday was over. Inherently, there was no possible way for anyone living away from the seat of the Sanhedrin to receive news of the proclamation of the new month until messengers arrived ''after the fact''. Accordingly, the practice emerged that Rosh Hashanah was observed on both possible days, as calculated from the previous month's start, everywhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|title=Mishnah Rosh Hashanah 1:3|wslink=Mishnah/Seder Moed/Tractate Rosh Hashanah/Chapter 1/3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;This ''reasoning'' did not directly apply in the actual meeting place of the Sanhedrin, but there are other reasons that the ''practice'' was applied there as well. See Rambam, ''Mishnah Torah, Kiddush HaChodesh'' 5:8.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Three Pilgrimage Festivals.'' Sukkot and Passover fall on the 15th day of their respective months. This gave messengers two weeks to inform communities about the proclamation of the new month. Normally, they would reach most communities within the land of Israel within that time, but they might fail to reach communities farther away (such as those in Babylonia or overseas). Consequently, the practice developed that these holidays be observed for one day within Israel, but for two days (both possible days as calculated from the previous month's start) outside Israel. This practice is known as ''yom tov sheni shel galuyot'', "second day of festivals in exile communities".&lt;ref&gt;Rambam, ''Mishnah Torah, Kiddush HaChodesh'' 5:9–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

:: For Shavuot, calculated as the fiftieth day from Passover, the above issue did not pertain directly, as the "correct" date for Passover would be known by then. Nevertheless, the Talmud applies the same rule to Shavuot, and to the [[Passover#Seventh day of Passover|Seventh Day of Passover]] and Shemini Atzeret, for consistency.&lt;ref&gt;Rambam, ''Mishnah Torah, Kiddush HaChodesh'' 3:12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yom Kippur is not observed for two days anywhere because of the difficulty of maintaining a fast over two days.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;In practice, the Sanhedrin had the discretion to arrange the month proclamations so that Elul would almost never be extended to 30 days. See [[Rosh Hashanah (Talmud)|BT Rosh Hashanah]] 19b, as well as commentators there. This greatly reduced the practical level of doubt as to which day would be the first day of Tishrei. The doubt still existed, so ''Rosh Hashanah'' and ''Sukkot'' were observed for two days.  However, the low level of the doubt–combined with the difficulty of a 49-hour fast–led to the exemption of ''Yom Kippur'' from the requirement for a second day of observance. This complex issue is discussed more fully [http://www.mail-archive.com/daf-discuss@shemayisrael.co.il/msg02556.html here].&lt;/ref&gt;

: Shabbat is not observed based on a calendar date, but simply at intervals of seven days. Accordingly, there is never a doubt of the date of Shabbat, and it need never be observed for two days.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;There are differing opinions as to the location of the International Date Line for purposes of Jewish law. Accordingly, some ''halachic'' authorities do have doubts as to which (secular) day of the week should be considered Shabbat in some Pacific islands. See [[International date line in Judaism]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adherents of [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] generally do not observe the second day of festivals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Second Festival Day and Reform Judaism (Responsum 5759.7)|journal=CCAR Responsa|year=1999|url=http://ccarnet.org/responsa/nyp-no-5759-7/|accessdate=July 15, 2013}}. See in particular footnotes 1 and 2 to the responsum.&lt;/ref&gt; although some do observe two days of Rosh Hashanah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rosh Hashanah: Customs|url=http://www.reformjudaism.org/rosh-hashanah-customs|work=ReformJudaism.org|publisher=Union for Reform Judaism|accessdate=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holidays of biblical and rabbinic (Talmudic) origin==

{{hatnote|Theories concerning possible non-Jewish sources for Biblical holidays are beyond the scope of this article.  Please see individual holiday articles, particularly [[Shabbat#History|Shabbat (History)]].}}

===Shabbat—The Sabbath===
[[File:Shabbat Candles.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Shabbat candles]] and [[kiddush cup]]]]
{{Main article|Shabbat}}
Jewish law ''(halacha)'' accords ''Shabbat'' (שבת) the status of a holiday, a day of rest celebrated on the seventh day of each week. Jewish law defines a day as ending at either sundown or nightfall, when the next day then begins. Thus,
* Shabbat begins just before sundown Friday night.  Its start is marked by the lighting of [[Shabbat candles]] and the recitation of [[Kiddush]] over a cup of [[kosher wine|wine]]; and
* Shabbat ends at nightfall Saturday night.  Its conclusion is marked by the prayer known as [[Havdalah]].
The fundamental rituals and observances of Shabbat include:
* Reading of the [[Weekly Torah portion]]
* Abbreviation of the [[Amidah]] in the three regular daily services to eliminate requests for everyday needs
* Addition of a [[musaf]] service to the daily prayer services
* Enjoyment of three meals, often elaborate or ritualized, through the course of the day
* Restraint from performing ''melacha'' (see [[#work|above]]).
In many ways, ''halakha'' (Jewish law) sees ''Shabbat'' as the most important holy day in the Jewish calendar.
* It is the first holiday mentioned in the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), and [[God]] was the first one to observe it ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]).
* The [[Torah]] reading on ''Shabbat'' has more sections of ''parshiot'' (Torah readings) than on Yom Kippur or any other Jewish holiday.
* The prescribed penalty in the Torah for a transgression of ''Shabbat'' prohibitions is [[Capital punishment in Judaism|death by stoning]] ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 31), while for other holidays the penalty is (relatively) less severe.
* [[Shomer Shabbat|Observance of Shabbat]] is the benchmark used in ''halacha'' to determine whether an individual is a religiously observant, religiously reliable member of the community.

===Rosh Chodesh—The New Month===
{{main article|Rosh Chodesh}}
Rosh Chodesh (ראש חודש) (lit., "head of the month") is a minor holiday or observance occurring on the first day of each month of the Jewish calendar, as well as the last day of the preceding month if it has thirty days.
* Rosh Chodesh observance during at least a portion of the period of the [[Nevi'im|prophets]] could be fairly elaborate.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Books of Samuel|I Samuel]] 20.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Over time there have been varying levels of observance of a custom that women are excused from certain types of work.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] 22b.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fasting is normally prohibited on Rosh Chodesh.
Beyond the preceding, current observance is limited to [[Rosh Chodesh#Traditional observances|changes in liturgy]].
:In the month of Tishrei, this observance is superseded by the observance of [[#Rosh Hashanah|Rosh Hashanah]], a major holiday.
''Related observances:''
* The date of the forthcoming Rosh Chodesh is [[Rosh Chodesh#Announcement|announced]] in synagogue on the preceding Sabbath.
* There are [[Kiddush Levanah|special prayers]] said upon observing the waxing moon for the first time each month.

===Rosh Hashanah—The Jewish New Year===

====Selichot====
The month of [[Elul]] that precedes Rosh Hashanah is considered to be a propitious time for [[repentance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Month of Elul: Stocktaking and Introspection|url=http://www.chabad.org/holidays/JewishNewYear/template_cdo/aid/4685/jewish/Elul.htm|publisher=Chabad.org|accessdate=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason, additional penitential prayers called [[Selichot]] are added to the daily prayers, except on Shabbat. [[Sephardi Jews]] add these prayers each weekday during Elul.  [[Ashkenazi Jews]] recite them from the last Sunday (or Saturday night) preceding Rosh Hashanah that allows at least four days of recitations.

====Rosh Hashanah====
[[File:Symbols of Rosh Hashana.jpg|thumb|200px|Rosh Hashana symbols: [[shofar]], [[apple]]s and [[honey]], [[pomegranate]]s, kiddush wine]]
{{Main article|Rosh Hashanah}}
* Erev Rosh Hashanah (eve of the first day): 29 Elul
* Rosh Hashanah: 1–2 [[Tishrei]]

According to [[Oral Torah|oral tradition]], Rosh Hashanah (ראש השנה) (lit., "Head of the Year") is the Day of Memorial or Remembrance (יום הזכרון, ''Yom HaZikaron''),&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian [[Talmud]] (BT) [[Rosh Hashanah (tractate)|Rosh Hashanah]] 16a&lt;/ref&gt; and the day of judgment (יום הדין, ''Yom HaDin'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Talmud]] Rosh Hashanah 1:2&lt;/ref&gt; God appears in the role of King, remembering and judging each person individually according to his/her deeds, and making a decree for each person for the following year.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the [[piyyut|liturgical poem]] ''[[Unetanneh Tokef]]'' in the ''[[Machzor]]'' (holiday prayer book) for Rosh Hashanah.&lt;/ref&gt;

The holiday is characterized by one specific [[mitzvah]]: blowing the ''[[shofar]]''.&lt;ref name=PinchasRH&gt;{{bibleref|Numbers|29:1|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Torah, this is the first day of the seventh month of the calendar year,&lt;ref name=PinchasRH /&gt; and marks the beginning of a ten-day period leading up to Yom Kippur. According to one of two Talmudic opinions, the creation of the world was completed on Rosh Hashanah.&lt;ref&gt;See BT Rosh Hashanah 10b. The other opinion is that the creation was completed on 1 Nisan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Morning prayer services are lengthy on Rosh Hashanah, and focus on the themes described above: majesty and judgment, remembrance, the birth of the world, and the blowing of the ''shofar''.  [[Ashkenazi Jews]] recite the brief ''[[Tashlikh]]'' prayer, a symbolic casting off of the previous year's sins, during the afternoon of Rosh Hashanah.

The Bible specifies Rosh Hashanah as a one-day holiday,&lt;ref name=PinchasRH /&gt; but it is traditionally celebrated for two days, even within the [[Land of Israel]]. (See ''[[#2days|Second day of Biblical festivals]],'' above.)

====Four New Years====
The Torah itself does not use any term like "new year" in reference to Rosh Hashanah. The [[Mishnah]] in [[Rosh Hashanah (tractate)|Rosh Hashanah]]&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Mishnah/Seder Moed/Tractate Rosh Hashanah/Chapter 1/1|Mishnah Rosh Hashanah 1:1]]&lt;/ref&gt; specifies four different "New Year's Days" for different purposes:
* 1 Tishrei (conventional "Rosh Hashanah"):  "new year" for calculating calendar years, [[shmita|sabbatical-year ''(shmita)'']] and [[Jubilee (Biblical)|jubilee]] cycles, and the age of trees for purposes of Jewish law; and for separating grain [[tithe]]s.
* 15 [[Shevat]] ([[#Tu Bishvat—New Year of the Trees|Tu Bishvat]]): "new year" for trees–''i.e.,'' their current agricultural cycle and related tithes.
* 1 [[Nisan]]: "new year" for counting months and major festivals and for calculating the years of the reign of a Jewish king
** In biblical times, the day following 29 Adar, Year 1 of the reign of ___, would be followed by 1 Nisan, Year 2 of the reign of ___.
** In modern times, although the Jewish calendar year number changes on Rosh Hashanah, the months are still numbered from Nisan.
** The three pilgrimage festivals are always reckoned as coming in the order Passover-Shavuot-Sukkot. This can have religious law consequences even in modern times.
* 1 Elul ([[Rosh Hashanah LaBehema]]):  "new year" for animal tithes.

====Aseret Yemei Teshuva—Ten Days of Repentance====
{{Main article|Ten Days of Repentance}}

The first ten days of Tishrei (from the beginning of Rosh Hashana until the end of Yom Kippur) are known as the Ten Days of Repentance (עשרת ימי תשובה, ''Aseret Yemei Teshuva''). During this time, in anticipation of Yom Kippur, it is "exceedingly appropriate"&lt;ref&gt;[[Rambam]], [[Mishneh Torah]], Laws of Repentance 2:6.&lt;/ref&gt; for Jews to practice ''[[teshuvah]]'' (literally "return"), an examination of one's deeds and repentance for sins one has committed against other people and God. This repentance can take the form of additional supplications, confessing one's deeds before God, fasting, self-reflection, and an increase of involvement with, or donations to, [[tzedakah|charity]].

===Tzom Gedalia—Fast of Gedalia{{anchor|Tzom Gedalia}}===
{{Main article|Fast of Gedalia}}
* Tzom Gedalia: 3 Tishrei
The Fast of Gedalia (צום גדליה) is a minor Jewish fast day. It commemorates the assassination of the governor of Judah, [[Gedalia]], which ended any level of Jewish rule following the destruction of the First Temple.
: The assassination apparently occurred on Rosh Hashanah (1 Tishrei),&lt;ref&gt;See {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|41:1|HE}}, ''ff.''&lt;/ref&gt; but the fast is postponed to 3 Tishrei in respect for the holiday. It is further postponed to 4 Tishrei if 3 Tishrei is Shabbat.

As on all minor fast days, fasting from dawn to dusk is required, but other laws of mourning are not normally observed. A Torah reading is included in both the ''Shacharit'' and ''Mincha'' prayers, and a Haftarah is also included at ''Mincha''. There are also a number of additions to the liturgy of both services.&lt;ref name="Fast Liturgy"&gt;See [[Amidah#Fast days|Amidah (Fast Days)]], [[Avinu Malkenu]], and [[Selichot#Selichot of Fast Days|Selichot of Fast Days]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yom Kippur—Day of Atonement===
[[File:Shofar-Sabbath-Horn-Yemenite-Jew.jpg|thumb|A man in a [[tallit]] blows the [[shofar]]]]
{{Main article|Yom Kippur}}

* Erev Yom Kippur: 9 Tishrei
* Yom Kippur: 10 Tishrei (begins at sunset)

Yom Kippur (יום כיפור) is the holiest day of the year for Jews.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;That is, conventional (Rabbinic) Jews. [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite Jews]] and [[Samaritans]] regard [[Passover]] as the holiest day of the year.&lt;/ref&gt; Its central theme is [[Atonement in Judaism|atonement]] and [[:wikt:reconciliation|reconciliation]]. This is accomplished through prayer and complete fasting—including abstinence from all food and drink (including water) —by all healthy adults.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Fasting begins at religious majority–age 13 for boys and age 12 for girls. Fasting is prohibited for a variety of medical reasons (''e.g.,'' for nursing mothers, diabetics, people with anorexia nervosa, etc.).&lt;/ref&gt; Bathing, wearing of perfume or cologne, wearing of leather shoes, and sexual relations are some of the other prohibitions on Yom Kippur—all them designed to ensure one's attention is completely and absolutely focused on the quest for atonement with God. Yom Kippur is also unique among holidays as having [[#work|work-related restrictions]] identical to those of Shabbat. The fast and other prohibitions commence on 10 Tishrei at sunset—sunset being the ''beginning'' of the day in Jewish tradition.

A traditional prayer in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] called ''[[Kol Nidre]]'' ("All Vows") is traditionally recited just before sunset. Although often regarded as the start of the Yom Kippur evening service—to such a degree that ''Erev Yom Kippur'' ("Yom Kippur Evening") is often called "Kol Nidre" (also spelled "Kol Nidrei")—it is technically a separate tradition. This is especially so because, being recited before sunset, it is actually recited on 9 Tishrei, which is the day ''before'' Yom Kippur; it is not recited on Yom Kippur itself (on 10 Tishrei, which begins ''after'' the sun sets).
: The words of Kol Nidre differ slightly between Ashkenazic and Sephardic traditions. In both, the supplicant prays to be released from all personal vows made to God during the year, so that any unfulfilled promises made to God will be annulled and, thus, forgiven. In Ashkenazi tradition, the reference is to the coming year; in Sephardic tradition, the reference is to the year just ended. Only vows between the supplicant and God are relevant. Vows made between the supplicant and other people remain perfectly valid, since they are unaffected by the prayer.

A ''[[Tallit]]'' (four-cornered [[prayer]] shawl) is donned for evening and afternoon prayers–the only day of the year in which this is done. In traditional Ashkenazi communities, men wear the ''[[kittel]]'' throughout the day's prayers. The prayers on Yom Kippur evening are lengthier than on any other night of the year. Once services reconvene in the morning, the services (in all traditions) are the longest of the year. In some traditional synagogues prayers run continuously from morning until nightfall, or nearly so. Two highlights of the morning prayers in traditional synagogues are the recitation of ''[[Yizkor]],'' the prayer of remembrance, and of liturgical poems ''([[piyyutim]])'' describing the [[Yom Kippur#Temple service|temple service of Yom Kippur]].

Two other highlights happen late in the day. During the ''[[Minchah]]'' prayer, the ''[[haftarah]]'' reading features the entire [[Book of Jonah]]. Finally, the day concludes with ''[[Ne'ilah]],'' a special service recited only on the day of Yom Kippur. Ne'ilah deals with the closing of the holiday, and contains a fervent final plea to God for forgiveness just before the conclusion of the fast. Yom Kippur comes to an end with the blowing of the ''[[shofar]]'', which marks the conclusion of the fast. It is always observed as a one-day holiday, both inside and outside the boundaries of the [[Land of Israel]].

Yom Kippur is considered, along with 15th of Av, as the happiest days of the year (Talmud Bavli—Tractate Ta'anit).&lt;ref name="Tubav"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Fifteenth Av and Yom Kippur |author=Nachum Mohl | url=http://www.jewishmag.co.il/136mag/tu_bav_yom_kippur/tu_bav_yom_kippur.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sukkot—Feast of Booths (or Tabernacles)===
[[File:Sukkots with wall from wood.JPG|thumb|A [[sukkah]] booth]]
{{Main|Sukkot}}

* Erev Sukkot: 14 Tishrei
* Sukkot: 15–21 Tishrei (22 outside Israel)
* The first day of Sukkot is (outside Israel, first [[#2days|two days]] are) full'' [[#yomtov|yom tov]], ''while the remainder of Sukkot has the status of [[Chol Hamoed]], "intermediate days".
''Sukkot'' (סוכות or סֻכּוֹת, ''sukkōt'') or ''Succoth'' is a seven-day [[religious festival|festival]], also known as the Feast of Booths, the Feast of Tabernacles, or just Tabernacles. It is one of the [[Three Pilgrimage Festivals]] (''shalosh regalim'') mentioned in the Bible. Sukkot commemorates the years that the Jews spent in the desert on their way to the Promised Land, and celebrates the way in which God protected them under difficult desert conditions. The word ''sukkot'' is the plural of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''sukkah'', meaning booth. Jews are commanded to "dwell" in booths during the holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|23:42|HE}} and other places&lt;/ref&gt; This generally means taking meals, but some sleep in the ''sukkah'' as well, particularly in Israel. There are specific [[Sukkah#Structure|rules]] for constructing a ''sukkah''.

Along with dwelling in a ''sukkah,'' the principal ritual unique to this holiday is use of the [[Four Species]] ([[lulav|''lulav'' (palm)]], [[hadass|''hadass'' (myrtle)]], [[Aravah (Sukkot)|''aravah'' (willow)]] and [[etrog|''etrog'' (citron)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|23:40|HE}} and other places&lt;/ref&gt; On each day of the holiday other than Shabbat, these are waved in association with the recitation of [[Hallel]] in the synagogue, then walked in a procession around the synagogue called the [[Sukkot#Hoshanot|''Hoshanot'']].

The seventh day of the Sukkot is called [[Hoshanah Rabbah]], the "Great ''Hoshanah"'' (singular of ''Hoshanot'' and the source of the English word [[hosanna]]). The climax of the day's prayers includes seven processions of ''Hoshanot'' around the synagogue. This tradition mimics practices from the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. Many aspects of the day's customs also resemble those of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Hoshanah Rabbah is traditionally taken to be the day of the "delivery" of the final judgment of Yom Kippur, and offers a [[Hoshanah Rabbah#Final judgment|last opportunity for pleas of repentance]] before the holiday season closes.

===Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 4466 Religion in Israel.JPG|thumb|200px|Dancing with the [[Torah]]]]
{{Main|Shemini Atzeret|Simchat Torah}}

* Shemini Atzeret: 22 Tishrei (combined with Simchat Torah in Israel)
* Simchat Torah outside Israel: 23 Tishrei

The holiday of Shemini Atzeret (שמיני עצרת) immediately follows the conclusion of the holiday of Sukkot. The Hebrew word ''shemini'' means "eighth”, and refers to its position on "the eighth day" of Sukkot, actually a seven-day holiday. This name reflects the fact that while in many respects Shemini Atzeret is a separate holiday in its own right, in certain respects its celebration is [[Shemini Atzeret#Relationship to Sukkot|linked to that of Sukkot]]. Outside Israel, meals are still taken in the Sukkah on this day.


The main notable custom of this holiday is the celebration of ''Simchat Torah'' (שמחת תורה), meaning "rejoicing with the Torah". This name originally referred to a special "ceremony": the last [[weekly Torah portion]] is read from [[Deuteronomy]], completing the annual cycle, and is followed immediately by the reading of the first chapter of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], beginning the new annual cycle. Services are especially joyous, and all attendees, young and old, are involved.

This ceremony so dominates the holiday that in Israel, where the holiday is one day long, the whole holiday is often referred to as ''Simchat Torah''. Outside Israel, the holiday is two days long; the name ''Shemini Atzeret'' is used for the first day, while the second is normally called ''Simchat Torah''.

===Hanukkah—Festival of Lights===
{{Main article|Hanukkah}}
[[File:The 8th Night.jpg|thumb|[[Menorah (Hanukkah)|Hanukkiah]]]]

* Erev Hanukkah: 24 [[Kislev]]
* Hanukkah: 25 Kislev–2 or 3 [[Tevet]]

The story of Hanukkah (חנוכה) is preserved in the books of the [[1 Maccabees|First]] and [[2 Maccabees|Second Maccabees]]. These books are not part of the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), they are [[Biblical apocrypha|apocryphal]] books instead. The miracle of the one-day supply of [[olive oil]] miraculously lasting eight days is first described in the [[Talmud]] [[Shabbat (Talmud)|(Shabbat 21b)]], written about 600 years after the events described in the books of Maccabees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shawna-dolansky/the-truth-about-hanukah_b_1165708.html Shawna Dolansky, "The Truth(s) About Hanukkah”, ''The Huffington Post,'' December 23, 2011], accessed most recently November 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanukkah marks the defeat of [[Seleucid Empire]] forces that had tried to prevent the people of [[Israel]] from practicing Judaism. [[Judas Maccabeus|Judah Maccabee]] and his brothers destroyed overwhelming forces, and rededicated the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. The eight-day festival is marked by the kindling of lights—one on the first night, two on the second, and so on—using a special candle holder called a ''[[Hanukkiah]]'', or a ''Hanukkah menorah.''

Religiously, Hanukkah is a minor holiday. Except on Shabbat, restrictions on work do not apply.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Some customs around cessation of work do exist–particularly work by women during the period the candles are burning. See, for example, [http://www.chabad.org/holidays/chanukah/article_cdo/aid/105100/jewish/Working-on-Chanukah.htm Eliyahu Kitov, "Working on Chanukah"], retrieved November 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the kindling of lights, formal religious observance is restricted to [[Hanukkah#Special additions to daily prayers|changes in liturgy]]. Hanukkah celebration tends to be informal and based on custom rather than law. Three widely practiced customs include:
* Consumption of [[Hanukkah#Hanukkah foods|foods prepared in oil]], such as potato pancakes or ''[[sufganiyot]],'' commemorating the miracle of oil
* Playing the game of [[dreidel]] (called a ''sevivon'' in Hebrew), symbolizing Jews' disguising of illegal Torah study sessions as gambling meetings during the period leading to the Maccabees' revolt&lt;ref group=Note name="Origin"&gt;The game of dreidel itself, though, is likely of much later origin.  See, for example, [http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Jewish_Holidays/Hanukkah/At_Home/Dreidel.shtml David Golinkin, "The Origin of the Dreidel" at myjewishlearning.com], accessed November 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Giving children money, especially coins, called [[Hanukkah gelt]].  However, the custom of giving presents is of far more recent, North American, origin, and is connected to the [[gift economy]] prevalent around North American [[Christmas]] celebrations.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Hanukkah and Christmas fall out during the same period of the year, but are not related religiously.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenth of Tevet===
{{Main article|Tenth of Tevet}}
* Asarah B'Tevet: 10 Tevet
The Tenth of Tevet (עשרה בטבת, ''Asarah B'Tevet'') is a minor fast day, marking the beginning of the siege of Jerusalem as outlined in [[2 Kings]] 25:1

:And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.

This fast's commemoration also includes [[Tenth of Tevet#History|other events]] occurring on 8, 9 and 10 Tevet.

This fast is observed like other minor fasts (see [[#Tzom Gedalia—Fast of Gedalia|Tzom Gedalia]], above). This is the only minor fast that can fall on a Friday under the current fixed [[Jewish calendar]].

===Tu Bishvat—New Year of the Trees===
[[File:DriedfruitS.jpg|thumb|Nuts and dried fruits, traditionally eaten on [[Tu Bishvat]]]]
{{main article|Tu Bishvat}}
* Tu Bishvat: 15 [[Shevat]]

Tu Bishvat (ט"ו בשבט) (lit., "fifteenth of Shevat”, as ט״ו is the number "15" in Hebrew letters), is the new year for trees. It is also known as חג האילנות (''Ḥag ha-Ilanot,'' Festival of Trees), or ראש השנה לאילנות (''Rosh ha-Shanah la-Ilanot,'' New Year for Trees). According to the [[Mishnah]], it marks the day from which fruit [[tithe]]s are counted each year. Starting on this date, the Biblical prohibition on eating the first three years of fruit (''[[Orlah prohibition|orlah]]'') and the requirement to bring the fourth year fruit ''(neta revai)'' to the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] were counted.&lt;ref&gt;Tractate [[Orlah (Mishnayoth)|Orlah]] is dedicated to these topics.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th century, Rabbi [[Yitzchak Luria]] of [[Safed]] and his disciples created a short seder, called ''Hemdat ha‑Yamim,'' reminiscent of the seder that Jews observe on [[Passover]], that explores the holiday's [[Jewish Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] themes. This [[Tu Bishvat seder]] has witnessed a revival in recent years.  More generally, Tu Bishvat is celebrated in modern times by eating various fruits and nuts associated with the [[Land of Israel]].

Traditionally, trees are planted on this day.&lt;ref&gt;See, just as one example, {{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/israelis-go-green-for-tu-bishvat-1.338092 |title=Israelis Go Green For Tu Bishvat |last=Rinat |first=Zafrir |date=January 20, 2011 |accessdate=January 20, 2011 |work=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many children collect funds leading up to this day to plant trees in Israel.  Trees are usually planted locally as well.

===Purim—Festival of Lots===
{{Main|Purim}}
* Fast of Esther: normally 13 [[Adar]]
* Purim: 14 Adar
* Shushan Purim: 15 Adar
* In [[Leap year#Hebrew calendar|leap years on the Hebrew calendar]], the above dates are observed in the Second Adar ''(Adar Sheni). The 14th and 15th of First Adar ''(Adar Rishon)'' are known as ''Purim Katan''

====Purim Katan====
''Purim Katan'' (פורים קטן) (lit., "small Purim") is observed on the 14th and 15th of First Adar in leap years. These days are marked by a small increase in festivity, including a prohibition on fasting, and slight changes in the liturgy.

====Ta'anit Esther–Fast of Esther====
[[File:Megillat Esther (1).jpg|thumb|250px|The opening chapter of a hand-written scroll of the Book of Esther, with reader's pointer]]
[[File:2 Mishloach Manot.jpg|thumb|[[Mishloah manot]]]]
{{Main article|Fast of Esther}}
''Ta'anit Esther'' (תענית אסתר), or "Fast of Esther", is named in honor of the fast of [[Esther]] and her court as Esther prepared to approach the king unbidden to invite him and [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] to a banquet.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Bibleverse||Esther|4:16|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It commemorates that fast, as well as one alluded to later in the [[Book of Esther]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Esther|9:2|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; undertaken as the Jews prepared to battle their enemies.

This fast is observed like other minor fasts (see [[#Tzom Gedalia|Tzom Gedalia]], above). While normally observed on 13 Adar, the eve of Purim, this fast is advanced to Thursday, 11 Adar, when 13 Adar falls on Shabbat.

====Purim and Shushan Purim====
{{Main article|Purim}}
Purim (פורים) commemorates the events that took place in the [[Book of Esther]]. The principal celebrations or commemorations include:&lt;ref name="E9"&gt;See {{bibleverse||Esther|9|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The reading of the ''[[Book of Esther|''Megillah'']]''. Traditionally, this is read from a scroll twice during Purim–once in the evening and again in the morning. Ashkenazim have a custom of making disparaging noises at every mention of [[Haman (Judaism)|Haman]]'s name during the reading.
* The giving of [[Purim#Food gifts and charity|''Mishloakh Manot'']], gifts of food and drink to friends and neighbors.
* The giving of [[Purim#Food gifts and charity|''Matanot La'evyonim'']], gifts to the poor and the needy.
* The [[Purim#Purim meal (se'udah) and festive drinking|Purim meal]] (''Se'udat Purim'' or ''Purim Se'udah''). This meal is traditionally accompanied by consumption of alcohol, often heavy,&lt;ref&gt;[[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] 7b&lt;/ref&gt; although Jewish sages have warned about the need to adhere to all religious laws even in a drunken state.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The requirement to drink at the Purim Se'udah does not create license for dangerous or immoral behavior. See [[Purim#Purim meal (se'udah) and festive drinking|''Se'udat Purim'']], as well as {{cite web |url=http://www.koltorah.org/Volume%2013/24%20Tetzaveh%20and%20Purim.htm#Author4|title=Baruch Haman, Arur Mordechai|author=Josh Rossman and Shlomo Yaros|date=March 6, 2004|work=Kol Torah,'' Vol. 13 No. 24''|publisher= Torah Academy of Bergen County|accessdate=August 8, 2012|postscript=}} and {{cite web |url= http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Jewish_Holidays/Purim/At_Home/Meal/Drinking_on_Purim.shtml|title=Drinking on Purim|author=Jeffrey Spitzer|publisher=MyJewishLearning.com|accessdate=August 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several customs have evolved from these principal commemorations. One widespread custom to act out the story of Purim. The [[Purim spiel]], or Purim play, has its origins in this, although the ''Purim spiel'' is not limited to that subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://judaism.about.com/od/purim/a/purim_play.htm|title=Purim Shpiels|author=Lisa Katz|publisher=about.com Judaism|accessdate=December 26, 2012|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wearing of costumes and masks is also very common. These may be an outgrowth of Purim plays, but there are several theories as to the origin of the custom, most related in some way to the "hidden" nature of the miracles of Purim.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;One common suggestion is that the custom comes from Esther's hiding her family background when first brought to the palace ({{bibleverse||Esther|2:10|HE}}). See {{cite web |url=http://judaism.about.com/od/holidays/a/Purim.htm|title=Purim–Jewish Holiday of Purim|author=Ariela Pelaia|publisher=about.com Judaism|accessdate=December 26, 2012|postscript=.}} See {{cite web |url=http://www.vosizneias.com/50116/2010/02/25/new-york-purim-costumes-%E2%80%93-a-history-%E2%80%93-reasons-and-origins|title=New York–Purim Costumes–A History–Reasons and Origins|author=Rabbi Yair Hoffman|date=February 25, 2010|publisher=Vos iz Neias.com|accessdate=December 26, 2012|postscript=}}, for another theory.&lt;/ref&gt;

Purim carnivals of various types have also become customary. In Israel there are festive parades, known as ''Ad-D'lo-Yada'',&lt;ref&gt;Literally, "until you don't know", a phrase from (Babylonian Talmud) Megillah 7b about drinking on Purim. See [[Purim#Purim meal (se'udah) and festive drinking|Purim (Purim meal [se'udah] and festive drinking)]].&lt;/ref&gt; in the town's main street. The largest and most renowned is in [[Holon]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite web|url=http://www.theicenter.org/resource/adloyadah-%E2%80%93-purim-parade-israel |title=ADLOYADA-The Purim Parade in Israel |publisher=theicenter.org |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Jews celebrate Purim on 14 Adar, the day of celebration after the Jews defeated their enemies. Because Jews in the capital city of [[Shushan]] fought with their enemies an extra day, Purim is celebrated a day later there, on the day known as שושן פורים, [[Purim#Sushan Purim|Shushan Purim]]. This observance was expanded to "walled cities",&lt;ref name="E9"/&gt; which are defined as cities "walled since the time of [[Joshua]]".&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud: ''Megillah'' 2b, 3b, 10b.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, there are no Jews living in Shushan ([[Shush, Iran]]), and Shushan Purim is observed fully only in [[Jerusalem]]. Cities like [[Safed]] and [[Tiberias]] also partially observe Shushan Purim. Elsewhere, Shushan Purim is marked only by a small increase in festivity, including a prohibition on fasting, and slight changes in the liturgy.

===Pesach—Passover===
* Erev Pesach and Fast of the Firstborn, ("Ta'anit Bechorot"): 14 [[Nisan]]
* Pesach&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The text of the Torah itself uses the term ''Pesach'' to refer to the ''[[Korban Pesach]]'', the offering of the paschal lamb, as well as the day that the sacrifice is offered—14 Nisan. See {{bibleref|Leviticus|23:5|HE}}. The long pilgrimage festival of 15–21 Nisan is always called ''Ḥag haMatzot,'' or "Festival of Unleavened Bread"; see {{bibleref|Lev.|23:6|HE}}. This distinction is still made in Karaite Judaism and in Samaritanism. In conventional Rabbinic Judaism the term ''Pesach'' now commonly refers to the pilgrimage festival itself, although the text of the liturgy continues to use the name ''Ḥag haMatzot''.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Passover]]): 15–21 Nisan (outside Israel 15–22 Nisan)
* The first day and last day of Passover (outside Israel, [[#2days|first two]] and last two days) are full ''[[#yomtov|yom tov]]'', while the remainder of Passover has the status of ''[[Chol Hamoed]]'', "intermediate days".
* Pesach Sheni (second Passover): 14 [[Iyar]]

====Month of Nisan====
As a rule, the month of Nisan is considered to be one of extra joy. Traditionally, throughout the entire month, [[Tahanun]] is omitted from the prayer service, many public mourning practices (such as delivering a [[hesped|eulogy]] at a funeral) are eliminated, and voluntary [[fasting#Judaism|fasting]] is prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Mashechet [[Soferim (Talmud)|Soferim]]'' 21:3 and BT [[Menachot]] 65, discussed at {{cite web |url=http://dafyomi.co.il/menachos/insites/mn-dt-065.htm |title=Insights to the Daf—Menachos 65 |publisher=Kollel Iyun Hadaf of Yerushalayim |accessdate=January 15, 2013|postscript=,}} which differ in their explanation for the custom.&lt;/ref&gt; However, practices sometimes vary.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/260800/jewish/The-Laws-Concerning-the-Thirty-Days-before-Passover.htm |title=The Laws Concerning the Thirty Days before Passover |last1=Wenger |first1=Eliezer |publisher=chabad.org |accessdate=January 15, 2013|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eve of Passover and Fast of the Firstborn====
[[File:Seder Plate.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Traditional arrangement of symbolic foods on a [[Passover Seder Plate]]]]
[[File:Sedertable.jpg|thumb|200px|Table set for [[Passover]] [[seder]]]]
The day before Passover (''Erev Pesach,'' lit., "Passover eve") is significant for three reasons:
* It is the day that all of the involved preparations for Passover, especially [[Passover#Removing all chametz|elimination of leavened food, or ''chametz'']], must be completed. In particular, a formal search for remaining ''[[chametz]]'' is done during the evening of Erev Pesach, and all remaining ''chametz'' is finally destroyed, disposed of or nullified during the morning of Erev Pesach.&lt;ref name="Pesahim"&gt;See the Talmud tractate [[Pesaḥim]] in both the Mishnah and Gemara, among many sources.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is the day observed as the [[Fast of the Firstborn]] (תענית בכורות). Jews who are firstborn&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Exactly what this means is disputed.  See [[Fast of the Firstborn#Qualifications for fasting|Fast of the Firstborn (Qualifications for fasting)]].&lt;/ref&gt; fast, in remembrance of the [[Plagues of Egypt#plague10|tenth plague]], when God killed the Egyptian firstborn, while sparing the Jewish firstborn.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Masechet Soferim'' 21:3 and ''Shulḥan Aruch Oraḥ Ḥayyim'' 470:1.&lt;/ref&gt; This fast is overridden by a ''[[seudat mitzvah]]'', a meal celebrating the fulfillment of a commandment; accordingly, it is almost universal for firstborn Jews to attend such a meal on this day&lt;ref group=Note&gt;This is usually a [[seudat mitzvah#Seudat Siyum Masechet|''siyum'']], a meal celebrating the conclusion of substantial study of Talmud, as there is great flexibility around scheduling such an event.&lt;/ref&gt; so as to obviate their need to fast.
* During the era of the Temple in Jerusalem, the ''[[Korban Pesach]]'', or sacrifice of the Paschal Lamb, was carried out the afternoon of 14 Nisan in anticipation of its consumption on Passover night.&lt;ref name="Pesahim"/&gt;

When Passover starts on Sunday, and the eve of Passover is therefore Shabbat, the above schedule is altered. See [[Eve of Passover on Shabbat]] for details.

====Passover====
{{Main article|Passover}}
Passover (פּסח) ''(Pesach''), also known liturgically as חג המצות ''("Ḥag haMatzot"'', the "Festival of Unleavened Bread"), is one of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals (''shalosh regalim'') mentioned in the Bible. Passover commemorates the liberation of the Israelite [[Slavery|slaves]] from [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:14|HE}} and following verses.&lt;/ref&gt; No ''[[chametz]]'' ([[Leavening agent|leavened]] food) is eaten, or even owned, during the week of Passover, in commemoration of the fact that the Israelites left Egypt so quickly that their bread did not have enough time to rise.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{bibleverse||Ex.|12:39|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Observant Jews go to great lengths to remove all ''chametz'' from their homes and offices in the run-up to Passover.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Chametz#Stringency|Chametz (Stringency)]] and [[Chametz#Removal of chametz|Chametz (Removal of Chametz)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the avoidance of ''chametz'', the principal ritual unique to this holiday is the [[seder]]. The ''seder'', meaning "order", is an ordered ritual meal eaten on the first night of Passover, and outside Israel also on the [[#2days|second night]]. This meal is known for its distinctive ritual foods—[[matzo]] (unleavened bread), [[maror]] (bitter herbs), and four cups of [[kosher wine|wine]]—as well as its prayer text/handbook/study guide, the [[Haggadah]]. Participation in a Passover seder is one of the most widely observed of Jewish rituals, even among less affiliated or less observant Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Passover lasts seven days in Israel (as per {{bibleverse||Ex.|12:15|HE}}), and eight days outside Israel. The holiday of the last day of Passover (outside Israel, last [[#2days|two days]]) commemorates the [[Splitting of the Red Sea]]; according to tradition this occurred on the [[Passover#Seventh day of Passover|seventh day of Passover]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web

====Pesach Sheni====
{{Main article|Pesach Sheni}}
''Pesach Sheni'' (פסח שני) ("Second Passover") is a day prescribed in the Torah&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|9|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to allow those who did not bring the Paschal Lamb offering ''(Korban Pesach)'' a second chance to do so. Eligibility was limited to those who were distant from Jerusalem on Passover, or those who were ritually impure and ineligible to participate in a sacrificial offering. Today, some have the custom to eat matzo on Pesach Sheni, and some make a small change to the liturgy.

===Sefirah—Counting of the Omer===
{{Main article|Counting of the Omer}}
* ''Sefirat HaOmer'' (Counting of the Omer): 16 Nisan–5 [[Sivan]]&lt;ref name="Karomer" group=Note&gt;Based on the source text at {{bibleverse||Lev.|23:11|HE}}, normative Jewish practice identifies the start of the Omer period as the second day of Passover, or 16 Nisan. (See {{cite wikisource|wslink=Translation:Shulchan Aruch/Orach Chaim/489|title=Shulchan Aruch OC 489|postscript=.}})  Based on the same source text, Karaite practice identifies this as the first Sunday on or after 16 Nisan, and therefore places Shavuot on the eighth Sunday on or after 16 Nisan—both as reckoned on the Karaite calendar. (See [[Karaite Judaism#Sephirath Ha‘Omer and Shavu‘oth|Karaite Judaism: Sephirath Ha‘Omer and Shavu‘oth]].)&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Sefirah'' (lit. "Counting"; more fully, ''Sefirat HaOmer,'' "Counting of the Omer") (ספירת העומר), is the 49-day period between the Biblical pilgrimage festivals of Passover and Shavuot. The Torah states&lt;ref name="Omersource" /&gt; that this period is to be counted, both in days and in weeks. The first day of this period&lt;ref group=Note name="Karomer" /&gt; is the day of the first [[grain offering]] of the new year's crop, an [[omer (unit)|omer]] of [[barley]]. The day following the 49th day of the period is the festival of Shavuot; the Torah specifies a grain offering of [[wheat]] on that day.&lt;ref name="Omersource"&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|23:9–17|HE}} and {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|16:9–10|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolically, this period has come to represent the spiritual development of the Israelites from slaves in the [[polytheistic]] society of [[Ancient Egypt]] to free, [[monotheistic]] people worthy of the [[revelation#Judaism|revelation]] of the Torah, traditionally said to have occurred on [[Shavuot#Giving of the Torah|Shavuot]]. Spiritual development remains a key rabbinic teaching of this period.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite web |url=http://www.tfdixie.com/parshat/emor/019.htm |title=Count Up |last1=Cohen |first1=Ezra |publisher=Torah from Dixie |accessdate=January 18, 2013|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sefirah has long been observed as a period of semi-mourning. The customary explanation&lt;ref name="sefira"&gt;{{cite wikisource|wslink=Translation:Shulchan Aruch/Orach Chaim/489|title=Shulchan Aruch OC 489|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; cites a plague that killed 24,000 students of [[Rabbi Akiva]] (BT ''[[Yevamot]]'' 62b).&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Neither the Torah nor the Talmud specifies Sefirah as a mourning period. However, there is evidence that this custom was in place by the era of the [[Geonim]], which ended around 1040 CE. See {{cite web |url=http://www.aish.com/h/o/33o/48970241.html |title=Rebbe Akiva's 24,000 Students |last1=Kahn |first1=Rabbi Ari |date=February 20, 2006 |publisher=aish.com |accessdate=January 18, 2013|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In broad terms, the mourning practices observed include limiting actual celebrations (such as weddings), not listening to music, not wearing new clothing, and not shaving or taking a haircut.&lt;ref name="sefira" /&gt; There is a wide variety of practice as to the specifics of this observance.  See [[Counting of the Omer#As a period of semi-mourning|Counting of the Omer (Semi-mourning)]].

====Lag Ba'Omer====
{{Main article|Lag Ba'Omer}}
* Lag Ba'Omer: 18 [[Iyar]]
''Lag Ba'Omer'' ({{lang|he|ל"ג בעומר}}) is the 33rd day in the Omer count ({{lang|he|ל"ג}} is the number 33 in Hebrew). By Ashkenazi practice, the semi-mourning observed during the period of Sefirah (see above) is lifted ''on'' Lag Ba'Omer, while Sefardi practice is to lift it ''at the end of'' Lag Ba'Omer.&lt;ref name="sefira" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondbt.com/2012/05/09/mournings-end-understanding-sefira-and-lag-bomer |title=Mourning’s End – Understanding Sefira and Lag B’Omer |last=Travis |first=Rabbi Daniel Yaakov |date=April 29, 2010 |accessdate=May 2, 2010 |publisher=Beyond BT |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501164650/http://www.beyondbt.com/2012/05/09/mournings-end-understanding-sefira-and-lag-bomer/ |archivedate=May 1, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Minor liturgical changes are made on Lag Ba'omer; because mourning practices are suspended, weddings are often conducted on this day.

Lag Ba'Omer is identified as the ''[[Yom Hillula]] ([[yahrzeit]])'' of [[Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai]], one of the leading ''[[Tannaim]]'' (teachers quoted in the Mishna) and ascribed author of the core text of [[Kabbalah]], the [[Zohar]]. Customary celebrations include bonfires, [[picnic]]s, and bow and arrow play by children.&lt;ref name="peter" /&gt; Boys sometimes receive their first haircuts on Lag Ba'Omer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishmag.com/10mag/israel/israel.htm |title=Meron on Lag B'Omer |last=Rossoff |first=Dovid |accessdate=April 28, 2010 |publisher=The Jewish Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Hasidic rebbes hold ''[[Tish (Hasidic celebration)|tish]]es'' in honor of the day.

In Israel, Lag Ba'Omer is associated with the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] against the Roman Empire. In Zionist thought, the plague that decimated Rabbi Akiva's 24,000 disciples is explained as a veiled reference to the revolt; the 33rd day representing the end of the plague is explained as the day of Bar Kokhba's victory. The traditional bonfires and bow-and-arrow play were thus reinterpreted as celebrations of military victory.&lt;ref name="peter"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1TA-Fg4wBnUC&amp;pg=PA283 |pages=283–286 |title=The Bar Kokhba War Reconsidered: New perspectives on the Second Jewish Revolt against Rome|last=Schäfer|first=Peter|year=2003 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |isbn=3-16-148076-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this vein, the order originally creating the [[Israel Defense Forces]] was issued on Lag Ba'Omer 1948, 13 days after Israel declared independence.&lt;ref name="Ynet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3540212,00.html |title=Lag B'Omer |date=May 13, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2012 |work=[[Ynetnews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shavuot—Feast of Weeks—Yom HaBikurim===
[[File:Cheese blintzes with blackberries.jpg|thumb|250px|Cheese [[blintz]]es, a traditional food on [[Shavuot]]]]
{{Main article|Shavuot}}
* Erev Shavuot: 5 [[Sivan]]
* [[Shavuot]]: 6 (and outside Israel: 7) Sivan

''[[Shavuot]]'' ({{lang|he|שבועות}}), the Feast of Weeks, is one of the three pilgrimage festivals (''Shalosh regalim'') ordained in the Torah. Different from other Biblical holidays, the date for Shavuot is not explicitly fixed in the Torah. Instead, it is observed on the day following the 49th and final day in the [[#Sefirah—Counting of the Omer|counting of the Omer]].&lt;ref name="Omersource" /&gt; In the current era of the fixed [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish calendar]], this puts the date of Shavuot as 6 Sivan. In Israel and in Reform Judaism, it is a one-day holiday; elsewhere, it is a two-day holiday extending through 7 Sivan.&lt;ref group=Note name="Karomer" /&gt;

According to Rabbinic tradition, codified in the Talmud at [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat 87b]], the [[Ten Commandments]] were given on this day. In the era of the Temple, there were certain specific [[Korban|offerings]] mandated for Shavuot, and Shavuot was the first day for bringing of [[First Fruits#Hebrew perspective|Bikkurim]] to the Temple.  Other than those, there are no explicit ''mitzvot'' unique to Shavuot given in the Torah (parallel to matzo on Passover or Sukkah on Sukkot).

Nevertheless, there are a number of widespread customs observed on Shavuot. During this holiday the [[Torah]] portion containing the Ten Commandments is read in the synagogue, and the biblical [[Book of Ruth]] is read as well. It is traditional to eat dairy meals during Shavuot. In observant circles, [[Shavuot#All-night Torah study|all night Torah study]] is common on the first night of Shavuot, while in Reform Judaism, Shavuot is the customary date for [[Reform Judaism#Confirmation ceremonies|Confirmation ceremonies]].

===Mourning for Jerusalem: Seventeenth of Tammuz and Tisha B'Av===
The three-week period starting on 17 Tammuz and concluding after Tisha B'Av has traditionally been observed as a period of mourning for the destruction of [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Holy Temple]] there.

====Fast of the Seventeenth of Tammuz====
{{Main article|Seventeenth of Tammuz}}
* Shiva Asar B'Tammuz: 17 [[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tammuz]]
The Seventeenth of Tamuz (שבעה עשר בתמוז, ''Shiva Asar B'Tamuz'') traditionally marks the first breach in the walls of the Jerusalem during the Roman conquest in 70 CE, at the end of the [[Second Temple]] period.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] at ''[[Ta'anit (tractate)|Ta'anit]]'' 4:5 states that the walls were breached on this date during the [[First Temple]] period as well, notwithstanding the text of {{bibleref|Jeremiah|39:2|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to tradition, this day has had negative connotations since Moses broke the first set of tablets on this day.&lt;ref&gt;Per {{bibleref|Exodus|32:1|HE}} ''ff.,'' counting forty days from [[Shavuot]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mishnah cites five negative events that happened on 17 Tammuz.&lt;ref name=taanit46&gt;Mishnah [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/h/h29.htm ''Ta'anit'' 4:6] (reference in Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

This fast is observed like other minor fasts (see [[#Tzom Gedalia|Tzom Gedalia]], above). When this fast falls out on Shabbat, its observance is postponed until Sunday.

====The Three Weeks and the Nine Days====
{{main article|The Three Weeks|The Nine Days}}
* The Three Weeks: 17 Tammuz – 9 [[Av]]
* The Nine Days: 1–9 Av
* The Week of Tisha B'Av (beginning at the conclusion of Shabbat preceding Tisha B'Av)

The period between the fasts of 17 Tammuz and 9 Av, known as the "Three Weeks" (Hebrew:  בין המצרים, "between the straits"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Lamentations|1:3|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;), features a steadily increasing level of mourning practices as Tisha B'Av approaches. Ashkenazi Jews refrain from conducting weddings and other joyful events throughout the period unless the date is established by Jewish law (as for a [[bris]] or ''[[pidyon haben]])''. They do not cut their hair during this period.&lt;ref name=sa551&gt;{{cite wikisource|wslink=Shulchan Aruch/Orach Chaim/551|title=Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 551|noicon=yes|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting on the first of Av and throughout the nine days between the 1st and 9th days of Av, Ashkenazim traditionally refrain from eating [[meat]] and drinking [[wine]], except on Shabbat or at a ''Seudat Mitzvah'' (a [[Mitzvah]] meal, such as for a bris or ''[[siyum]]'').&lt;ref name=sa551 /&gt; They also refrain from bathing for pleasure.&lt;ref name=sa551 /&gt; Sefardic practice varies some from this; the less severe restrictions usually begin on 1 Av, while the more severe restrictions apply during the week of Tisha B'Av itself.&lt;ref name=sa551 /&gt;

Subject to the variations described above, [[Orthodox Judaism]] continues to maintain the traditional prohibitions.  In [[Conservative Judaism]], the [[Rabbinical Assembly]]'s Committee on Jewish Law and Standards has issued several [[halakha|responsa (legal rulings)]] which hold that the prohibitions against weddings in this timeframe are deeply held traditions, but should not be construed as binding law. Thus, Conservative Jewish practice would allow weddings during this time, except on the 17th of Tammuz and 9th of Av themselves.{{refn|group=Note|See, ''e.g.,'' {{cite book|title=Proceedings of the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Conservative Movement 1927-1970|year=1998|volume=III|publisher=The Rabbinical Assembly and The Institute of Applied Halakhah|location=Jerusalem|editor=Rabbi David Golinkin}}. Based on these responsa, many Conservative rabbis will only perform small weddings in the rabbi's study between 1-9 Av.}} Rabbis within [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] hold that halakha (Jewish law) is no longer binding and follow their individual consciences on such matters. Nevertheless, the rabbinical manual of the Reform movement encourages Reform rabbis not to conduct weddings on Tisha B'Av itself "out of historical consciousness and respect" for the Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ask the Expert: Wedding Timing|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/ask_the_expert/at/Ask_the_Expert_wedding_timing.shtml|publisher=MyJewishLearning.org|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tisha B'Av—Ninth of Av====
[[File:Eicha268.jpg|thumb|Worshipers seated on the floor of the [[synagogue]] before the reading of [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] on [[Tisha B'Av]]]]
{{main article|Tisha B'Av}}
* Tisha B'Av : 9 Av
''Tisha B'Av'' ({{lang|he|תשעה באב}}) is a major fast day and day of mourning. A Midrashic tradition states that the spies' negative report concerning the Land of Israel was delivered on Tisha B'Av. Consequently, the day became auspicious for negative events in Jewish history. Most notably, both the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]], originally built by King [[Solomon]], and the [[Second Temple]] of Roman times were destroyed on Tisha B'Av.&lt;ref name=taanit46 /&gt; Other calamities throughout Jewish history are said to have taken place on Tisha B'Av, including King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]'s edict compelling the Jews to leave England (1290) and the [[Alhambra Decree|Jewish expulsion]] from Spain in 1492.

Tisha B'Av is a major fast. It is a 25-hour fast, running from sundown to nightfall. As on Yom Kippur, not only are eating and drinking prohibited, but also bathing, anointing, marital relations and the wearing of leather shoes.  Work is not prohibited, as on Biblical holidays, but is discouraged. In the evening, the [[Book of Lamentations]] is read in the synagogue, while in the morning lengthy ''[[kinot]],'' poems of elegy, are recited. From evening until noon mourning rituals resembling those of [[Shiva (Judaism)|shiva]] are observed, including sitting on low stools or the floor; after noon those restrictions are somewhat lightened, in keeping with the tradition that Messiah will be born on Tisha B'Av.&lt;ref name=KSA&gt;[http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%A7%D7%9B%D7%93#.28.D7.99.D7.91.29 Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 124 (Hebrew Wikisource)].&lt;/ref&gt;

While the fast ends at nightfall of 9-10 Av, the restrictions of the Three Weeks and Nine Days continue through noon on 10 Av because the Second Temple continued to burn through most of that day. When 9 Av falls on Shabbat, when fasting is prohibited, the fast is postponed until 10 Av. In that case, the restrictions of the Three Weeks and Nine Days end with the fast, except for the prohibition against eating meat and drinking wine, which extend until the morning of 10 Av.&lt;ref name=KSA /&gt;

===Tu B'Av===
{{main article|Tu B'Av}}
* Tu B'Av: 15 Av
''Tu B'av'' (ט״ו באב), lit. "15th of Av", is a day mentioned in the Talmud alongside Yom Kippur as "happiest of the year".&lt;ref name="Tubav"/&gt; It was a day celebrating the bringing of wood used for the Temple Service, as well as a day when marriages were arranged. Today, it is marked by a small change in liturgy. In modern Israel, the day has become somewhat of an analog to [[Valentine's Day]].

===Other fasts===
{{Main article|Ta'anit}}
Several other fast days of ancient or medieval origin continue to be observed to some degree in modern times. Such continued observance is usually by Orthodox Jews only, and is not universal today even among Orthodox Jews.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Private fasts are beyond the scope of this article.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Fasts for droughts and other public troubles. Much of the Talmudic tractate [[Ta'anit (tractate)|''Ta'anit'']] is devoted to the proclamation and execution of public fasts. The most detailed description refers to fasts in times of [[drought]] in the Land of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;See especially Mishnah Ta'anit 1:4-2:6 and the Gemara on it.&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently these fasts included a ''[[Ne'ilah]]'' (closing) prayer, a prayer now reserved for recitation on Yom Kippur only.&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah Ta'anit 4:1&lt;/ref&gt;
:While the specific fasts described in the Mishnah fell into disuse once Jews were exiled from the land of Israel, various Jewish communities have declared fasts over the years, using these as a model. Two examples include a fast among Polish Jews commemorating the massacre of Jews during the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising#Jews|Khmelnytsky Uprising]] and one among Russian Jews during anti-Jewish [[pogrom#19th century|pogroms of the 1880's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia |title=Fasting and Fast Days|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6033-fasting-and-fast-days}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=weinfast&gt;{{cite web|last=Wein |first=Rabbi Berel |title=Days of Fasting |url=http://www.torah.org/features/holydays/daysoffasting.html |work=torah.org |publisher=Project Genesis |accessdate=July 14, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509081738/http://torah.org/features/holydays/daysoffasting.html |archivedate=May 9, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Behab'' (בה"ב).

Based on the model of Mishnah ''Ta'anit'', they are then observed on the Monday, Thursday and Monday following that Shabbat.
* ''[[Yom Kippur Katan]]'' ("little Yom Kippur"). These fasts originated in the sixteenth-century [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] community of [[Safed]]. They are conceptually linked to the sin-offerings that were brought to the Temple in Jerusalem on each [[#Rosh Chodesh|Rosh Chodesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Numbers|28:15|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fasts are observed on the day before Rosh Chodesh in most months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia|title=Yom Kippur Katan|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=74&amp;letter=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israeli/Jewish national holidays and days of remembrance==
{{main article|Public holidays in Israel}}

As a general rule, the Biblical Jewish holidays (Sabbath, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Passover, Shavuot, Sukkot and Purim) are observed as public holidays in Israel. Chanukah is a school holiday, but businesses remain open. On Tisha B'Av, restaurants and places of entertainment are closed.  Other Jewish holidays listed above are observed in varying ways and to varying degrees.

Between the creation of the [[State of Israel]] in 1948 and the aftermath of the [[Six-Day War]], the [[Knesset]], generally in consultation with the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]], established four national holidays or days of remembrance:

* ''Yom HaShoah:'' Holocaust Remembrance Day
* ''Yom Hazikaron:'' Memorial Day
* ''Yom Ha'atzmaut:'' Israel Independence Day
* ''Yom Yerushalayim:'' Jerusalem Day

The status of these days as ''religious'' events is not uniform within the Jewish world.  Non-Orthodox, [[Religious Zionist]] and [[Modern Orthodox]] [[Jewish religious movements]]{{refn|group=Note|''Inter alia'': 
*Non-orthodox: [[Union for Traditional Judaism]], [[Conservative Judaism]], [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]]
*Religious Zionist: [[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]]–[[Bnai Akiva]]
*Modern Orthodox: [[Orthodox Union|Union of Orthodox Congregations]], [[Rabbinical Council of America]], [[United Synagogue|United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth]]}} accept these days as ''religious'' as well as ''national'' in nature.

As a rule, these four days are not accepted as religious observances by most [[Haredi Jews]], including [[Hasidim]].  Some ''ḥaredim'' are opposed to the existence of the State of Israel altogether on religious grounds; others simply feel that there are not sufficient grounds under Jewish law to justify the establishment of new religious holidays.  For details, see [[Haredim and Zionism]].

Observance of these days in [[Jewish diaspora|Jewish communities outside Israel]] is typically more muted than their observance in Israel. Events held in government and public venues within Israel are often held in Jewish communal settings (synagogues and community centers) abroad.

More recently, the Knesset established two additional holidays:

* ''Yom HaAliyah'': Aliyah Day
* A day to commemorate the expulsion of Jews from Arab lands and Iran

Finally, the Israeli government also recognizes several [[#Ethnic holidays|ethnic Jewish observances]] with holiday status.

===Yom HaShoah—Holocaust Remembrance Day===
[[File:Yom Hashoah candle.jpg|thumb|200px|A lit Yom HaShoah Yellow Candle]]
* [[Yom HaShoah]]: (nominally) 27 [[Nisan]]

''Yom HaShoah'' (lit. "Holocaust Day") is a day of remembrance for victims of the [[Holocaust]].  Its full name is ''Yom Hazikaron LaShoah v'LiGevurah'' (lit. "Holocaust and Heroism Remembrance Day") ({{lang|he|יום הזכרון לשואה ולגבורה}}), and reflects a desire to recognize martyrs who died in active [[Jewish resistance under Nazi rule|resistance]] to the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] alongside those who died as passive victims.  Its date, 27 Nisan, was chosen because it commemorates the [[Warsaw Ghetto uprising]], the best known of the armed Jewish uprisings.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The uprising began on 14 Nisan, Passover eve.  There was sufficient opposition to the selection of that date for the memorial that its observance was moved to 27 Nisan, approximately halfway between the end of Passover and Yom Ha'Atzmaut, and still within the period of the uprising. See {{cite web|last=Rosenberg|first=Jennifer|title=Holocaust Remembrance Day|url=http://history1900s.about.com/cs/holocaust/a/yomhashoah.htm|publisher=about.com|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;In contrast, [[International Holocaust Remembrance Day]] is observed on January 27, the day the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] camp was liberated in 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

Places of public entertainment are closed throughout Israel in recognition of the day.&lt;ref name=tdshoah&gt;{{cite web|title=Yom HaShoah|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/jewish/yom-hashoah|publisher=timeanddate.com|accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Public [[Yom HaShoah#Commemoration|commemoration]] of Yom HaShoah usually includes religious elements such as the recitation of [[Psalms]], memorial prayers, and [[kaddish]], and the lighting of [[memorial candle]]s.  [[Yom HaShoah#In Israel|In Israel]], the most notable observances are the State memorial ceremony at [[Yad Vashem]] and the sirens marking off a two-minute silence at 10:00 am.  Religious Zionist and Modern Orthodox Jews generally participate in such public observances along with secular Jews and Jews who adhere to more liberal religious movements.  [[Yom HaShoah#Abroad|Outside Israel]], Jewish communities observe Yom HaShoah in addition to or instead of their countries' [[Holocaust Memorial Days]].&lt;ref name=tdshoah/&gt; Probably the most notable commemoration is the [[March of the Living]], held at the site of [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]], attended by Jews from all parts of the world.

Outside Orthodoxy, a liturgy for Yom HaShoah is beginning to develop.  The Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist prayer books all include [[Yom HaShoah#Liturgy for Yom HaShoah|liturgical elements for Yom HaShoah]], to be added to the regular weekday prayers. Conservative Judaism has written a scroll, called ''[[Tikkun megillat hashoah|Megillat HaShoah]],'' intended to become a definitive liturgical reading for Yom HaShoah.&lt;ref name="anchor1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gordon|first=Sheldon|title=Holocaust Scroll|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Jewish_Holidays/Modern_Holidays/Yom_Hashoah/Observances/Holocaust_Scroll.shtml|newspaper=The Jewish Forward|accessdate=January 22, 2013|date=May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orthodox world–even the segment that participates publicly in Yom HaShoah–has been reluctant to write a liturgy for the day, preferring to compose ''[[Kinnot]]'' (prayers of lamentation) for recitation on [[#Tisha B'av|Tisha B'Av]].&lt;ref name="anchor1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wagner |first=Matthew |url=http://www.jpost.com/Features/Article.aspx?id=99553 |title=An anchor for national mourning |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=April 28, 2008|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Along with the ''ḥaredi'' resistance to new days of commemoration, there is a reluctance to introduce unnecessary mourning during the month of Nisan ([[#Month of Nisan|see above]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to ensure that public Yom HaShoah ceremonies in Israel do not violate Shabbat prohibitions, the date for Yom HaShoah varies&lt;ref name="chutz" group=Note&gt;These changes are not uniformly observed by communities outside Israel, where the ceremonies are not official in nature.&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:
*If 27 Nisan occurs on a Friday, the observance of Yom HaShoah is advanced to the previous day (Thursday, 26 Nisan).
*If 27 Nisan occurs on a Sunday, the observance of Yom HaShoah is delayed to the following day (Monday, 28 Nisan).

===Yom Hazikaron—Memorial Day===
[[File:HPIM0313.jpg|300px|thumb|A [[moment of silence]] as the siren is sounded in [[Tel Aviv]], Yom Hazikaron 2007]]
* [[Yom Hazikaron]]: (nominally) 4 [[Iyar]]

''Yom Hazikaron'' (lit. "Memorial Day") is a day of remembrance of the fallen of Israel's wars. During the first years of Israel's independence, this remembrance was observed on [[#Yom Ha'Atzmaut—Independence Day|Yom Ha'atzmaut (Independence Day)]] itself.  However, by 1951, the memorial observance was separated from the festive celebration of Independence Day and moved to its current date, the day before Yom Ha'atzmaut.&lt;ref name="ken"&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/holidays/eng/memorial_day_eng.htm Memorial Day for Israel's Fallen Soldiers], Knesset official website. Retrieved April 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;As early as 1940, 4 Iyar had been established as a memorial day for victims of Arab terror attacks.

Places of public entertainment are closed throughout Israel in recognition of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Jewish_Holidays/Modern_Holidays/Yom_Hazikaron.shtml|title=Yom Hazikaron: Israel's Memorial Day|publisher=My Jewish Learning|accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many schools, businesses and other institutions conduct memorial services on this day, and it is customary to visit the graves of fallen soldiers and to recite memorial prayers there.  The principal public observances are the evening opening ceremony at the [[Western Wall]] and the morning services of remembrance at military cemeteries throughout the country, each opened by the sounding of sirens.  The public observances conclude with the service at the military cemetery on [[Mount Herzl]] that serves as the transition to Yom Ha'atzmaut.

Outside Israel, Yom HaZikaron observances are often folded into Yom Ha'atzmaut celebrations.  Within Israel, Yom Hazikaron is always the day before Yom Ha'atzmaut, but that date moves to prevent violation of Sabbath prohibitions during the ceremonies of either day.  See following section for details.

===Yom Ha'atzmaut—Israel Independence Day===
[[File:Peresohad1985hidon.jpg|thumb|The final round of the [[International Bible Contest]] (here in 1985) is held on Yom Ha'atzmaut]]
[[File:Israel-Jerusalem Day.jpg|thumb|[[Jerusalem Day]] celebrations]]
* [[Yom Ha'atzmaut]]: (nominally) 5 Iyar

''Yom Ha'atzmaut'' ({{lang|he|יום העצמאות}}) is Israel's [[Independence Day (Israel)|Independence Day]]. Observance of this day by Jews inside and outside Israel is widespread,&lt;ref name=tdind&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/jewish/yom-haatzmaut|title=Yom HaAtzmaut|accessdate=February 27, 2013|publisher=timeanddate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and varies in tone from secular (military parades and barbecues) to religious (recitation of Hallel and new liturgies).

Although Israel's independence was declared on a Friday, the Chief Rabbinate has long been mindful of the possibility of Yom Ha'atzmaut (and Yom Hazikaron) observances leading to violation of Sabbath prohibitions.  To prevent such violations, the dates of Yom Hazikaron and Yom Ha'atzmaut vary&lt;ref name="chutz" group=Note /&gt; as follows:
*If 4–5 Iyar occur on a Sunday-Monday, the observances are delayed to Monday-Tuesday, 5–6 Iyar.
*If 4–5 Iyar occur on a Tuesday-Wednesday, the observances are not moved.
*If 4–5 Iyar occur on a Thursday-Friday, the observances are advanced to Wednesday-Thursday, 3–4 Iyar.
*If 4–5 Iyar occur on a Friday-Shabbat, the observances are advanced to Wednesday-Thursday, 2–3 Iyar.

Nearly all non-''ḥaredi'' Jewish religious communities have incorporated changes or enhancements to the liturgy in honor of Yom Ha'atzmaut and suspend the mourning practices of [[#Sefirah|the period of Sefirat Ha'Omer]].  (See [[Yom Ha'atzmaut#Religious customs|Yom Ha'atzmaut&amp;mdash;Religious Customs]] for details.)  Within the Religious Zionist and Modern Orthodox communities, these changes are not without controversy, and customs continue to evolve.&lt;ref name=Haber&gt;{{cite web|title=Yom HaAtzmaut and Yom Yerushalayim in Halacha and Hashkafa |url=http://www.mevaseret.org/mmy/Shiurim/Rabbi%20Haber/Yom%20HaAtzmaut%20in%20Halacha%20and%20Hashkafa.htm |publisher=Yeshivat Shaarei Mevaseret Zion |accessdate=February 27, 2013 |last=Haber |first=Alan |postscript=. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725124922/http://www.mevaseret.org/mmy/Shiurim/Rabbi%20Haber/Yom%20HaAtzmaut%20in%20Halacha%20and%20Hashkafa.htm |archivedate=July 25, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ḥaredi'' religious observance of Yom Ha'atzmaut varies widely.  A few ''ḥaredim'' (especially [[Sefardic Ḥaredim]]) celebrate the day in a reasonably similar way to the way non-''ḥaredim'' do.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Haredim and Zionism#ZH|Haredim and Zionism (Groups that support Zionism)]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Most ''ḥaredim'' simply treat the day indifferently; ''i.e.,'' as a regular day.&lt;ref name=Haber /&gt;  And finally others (notably [[Satmar Hasidism|Satmar Ḥasidim]] and [[Neturei Karta]]) mourn on the day because of their opposition to the enterprise of the State of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Guttman|first= Moishe|date= March 14, 2007|title=Zealots and Zionism |magazine=Mishpacha|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yom Yerushalayim—Jerusalem Day===
* [[Yom Yerushalayim]]: 28 Iyar

Jerusalem Day ({{lang|he|יום ירושלים}}) marks the 1967 [[reunification of Jerusalem]] under Israeli control during the [[Six-Day War]]. This marked the first time in 19 years that the [[Temple Mount]] was accessible to Jews, and the first time since the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] 1900 years earlier that the Temple Mount was under Jewish political control.

As with Yom Ha'atzmaut, celebrations of Yom Yerushalayim range from completely secular (including hikes to Jerusalem and a large parade through downtown Jerusalem) to religious (recitation of Hallel and new liturgies). Although Haredim do not participate in the liturgical changes, they are somewhat more likely to celebrate Yom Yerushalayim than the other modern Israeli holidays because of the importance of the liberation of the [[Western Wall]] and the [[Old City of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yom Yerushalayim:The Celebration|url=http://www.mazornet.com/holidays/YomYerushalayim/celebrate.htm|publisher=MazorGuide|accessdate=April 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside Israel, observance of Yom Yerushalayim is widespread, especially in Orthodox circles. It has not gained as widespread acceptance as Yom Ha'atzmaut, especially among more politically liberal Jews, because of the continuing conflicts over the future of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yom Yerushalayim, Jerusalem Day|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Jewish_Holidays/Modern_Holidays/Yom_Yerushalayim.shtml|publisher=MyJewishLearning.com|accessdate=April 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yom Yerushalayim has not traditionally moved to avoid Shabbat desecration, although in 2012 the Chief Rabbinate began some efforts in that direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yom Yerushalayim and Lag Ba'omer Events Postponed a Day Due to Chillul Shabbos|url=http://matzav.com/yom-yerushalayim-and-lag-baomer-events-postponed-a-day-due-to-chillul-shabbos|publisher=Matzav.com|accessdate=April 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aliyah Day ({{lang|he|יום העלייה}}) is an Israeli national holiday celebrated annually on the tenth of Nisan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4817589,00.html/ YNET: Grassroots initiated holiday becomes law]&lt;/ref&gt; The day was established to acknowledge [[Aliyah]], immigration to the Jewish state, as a core value of the State of Israel, and honor the ongoing contributions of Olim (immigrants) to Israeli society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/178843 Knesset Proposes Aliyah Holiday Bill]&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigration to Israel is a recognized religious value of Judaism, sometimes referred to as the [[Gathering of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{slink|Aliyah|Religious, ideological and cultural concept}} for more details.&lt;/ref&gt; The date chosen for Yom HaAliyah, 10 Nisan, has religious significance: it is the day on which Joshua and the Israelites crossed the Jordan River at [[Gilgal]] into the Promised Land. It was thus the first documented "mass Aliyah".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Joshua|4:19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative date observed in the school system, 7 [[Heshvan]], falls during the week of the Torah portion in which God instructs [[Abraham]] to leave his home and his family and go up to the Land of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Genesis|12:1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the present time, observance of this day appears to be secular in nature.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;!--Doesn't have a source; it's a conclusion based on a lack of evidence for any religious observance so far. But I'd welcome a source, either way, if someone has one.--&gt;

===Day to commemorate the expulsion of Jews from Arab lands and Iran===
* [[Day to Mark the Departure and Expulsion of Jews from the Arab Countries and Iran]]: 30 November (on the Gregorian calendar)

The Knesset established this observance in 2014. The purpose of this observance is to recognize the collective trauma of [[Mizrahi Jews]] during the period around the establishment of the State of Israel. Many Mizrachi Jews felt that their own suffering was being ignored, both in comparison to the suffering of [[European Jewry]] during the [[Holocaust]] and in comparison to the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[Nakba]]. The Gregorian-calendar date chosen is the day after the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] was adopted, as that date marked the beginning of concentrated pressure and hostility against the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/.premium-1.629226 |title=Israel marks first-ever national day remembering Jewish exodus from Muslim lands |first=Ofer |last=Aderet |date=November 30, 2014 |work=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=April 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic holidays===
{{Main article|Mimouna|Seharane|Sigd}}
The Israeli government officially recognizes three traditional holidays of ethnic Jewish communities in Israel. These days are also observed by their respective communities outside Israel.
* ''Mimouna'' began as a holiday of [[Moroccan Jews]], while similar celebrations also exist among [[Turkish Jews]] and [[Persian Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sephardic Passover Customs and Traditions For Pesach|url=http://www.angelfire.com/pa2/passover/sephardicpassovercustoms.html|publisher=Elimelech David Ha-Levi Web|accessdate=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These festivals are observed on the [[isru chag|day after Passover]], when eating of ordinary food ("chametz") resumes. In Israel, observance of Mimouna has spread widely in recent years; it has been estimated that up to two million Jews in Israel now participate in Mimouna celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Une fête peu connue en Europe, La Mimouna|url=http://www.harissa.com/news/article/une-f%C3%AAte-peu-connue-en-europe-la-mimouna|publisher=Harissa.com|accessdate=July 22, 2013|language=French|date=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: On the evening concluding Passover,&lt;ref group=Note&gt;When this is Friday night in Israel, the celebration is deferred until after Shabbat.&lt;/ref&gt; the celebration centers on visiting the homes of friends and neighbors, Jewish and non-Jewish. A variety of traditional foods are served, and symbols representing good luck and prosperity are prominently displayed. The next day, barbecues and picnics are among the most widespread activities of the celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jafi.org.il/JewishAgency/English/Jewish+Education/Compelling+Content/Jewish+Time/Festivals+and+Memorial+Days/Mimouna/Mimounah+Customs.htm|title=Mimouna Customs|publisher=[[Jewish Agency for Israel]]|year=2011|accessdate=22 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528021137/http://www.jafi.org.il/JewishAgency/English/Jewish+Education/Compelling+Content/Jewish+Time/Festivals+and+Memorial+Days/Mimouna/Mimounah+Customs.htm|archive-date=May 28, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Seharane'' was celebrated by [[Kurdish Jews]] as a multi-day nature festival starting the day after Passover. Communities would leave their villages and camp out for several days, celebrating with eating and drinking, nature walks, singing and dancing. 
: Its observance was interrupted after the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|relocation of this community to Israel in the 1950s]]. In recent years it has been revived. But because of the already-widespread celebration of Mimouna in Israel, the celebration of the Seharane was moved to ''Chol HaMoed'' Sukkot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Seharane|url=http://www.jafi.org.il/JewishAgency/English/Jewish+Education/Compelling+Content/Jewish+Time/Festivals+and+Memorial+Days/The+Seharane.htm|publisher=The Jewish Agency for Israel|accessdate=July 22, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017205645/http://www.jafi.org.il/JewishAgency/English/Jewish+Education/Compelling+Content/Jewish+Time/Festivals+and+Memorial+Days/The+Seharane.htm|archivedate=October 17, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The ''Sigd'' began as an evolution of the observance of Yom Kippur by the [[Beta Israel]] (Ethiopian) community. Currently that community now observes it in addition to Yom Kippur; its date is 29 [[Heshvan]], 49 days after Yom Kippur. It shares some features of Yom Kippur, Shavuot, and other holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ethiopian Sigd|url=http://www.jafi.org.il/JewishAgency/English/Jewish+Education/Compelling+Content/Jewish+Time/Festivals+and+Memorial+Days/sigd.htm|publisher=The Jewish Agency for Israel|accessdate=July 22, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017211045/http://www.jafi.org.il/JewishAgency/English/Jewish+Education/Compelling+Content/Jewish+Time/Festivals+and+Memorial+Days/sigd.htm|archivedate=October 17, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: The Sigd is modeled on a ceremony of fasting, study and prayer described in {{bibleref|Nehemiah|8|HE}}, when the Jews rededicated themselves to religious observance on return to Israel after the [[Babylonian exile]]. In Ethiopia, the community would gather on a mountaintop and pray for a return to Jerusalem. The modern Sigd is centered on a promenade overlooking the [[Old City of Jerusalem]]. The day's observance ends with a celebratory [[break fast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Afsai|first=Shai|title=The Sigd Festival comes home to Jerusalem|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/The-Sigd-Festival-comes-home-to-Jerusalem|accessdate=July 22, 2013|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Temple-Jagannath.jpg|thumb|[[Jagannath Temple, Puri#Structure|The Jagannath Temple]], one of the four holiest places (Dhamas) of Hinduism,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.odissi.com/orissa/jagannath.htm&lt;/ref&gt; in the coastal town of [[Puri]] in [[Odisha]].]]
{{Hinduism}}
The '''Kaḷinga architectural style''' is a style of [[Hindu architecture]] which flourished in the ancient [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] region or present eastern Indian state of [[Odisha]], large parts of [[West Bengal]] and northeastern [[Andhra Pradesh]]. The style consists of three distinct types of temples: Rekha Deula, Pidha Deula  and Khakhara Deula. The former two are associated with [[Vishnu]], [[Surya]] and [[Shiva]] temples while the third is mainly with [[Chamunda]] and [[Durga]] temples. The Rekha Deula and Khakhara Deula houses the [[sanctum sanctorum]] while the Pidha Deula constitutes outer dancing and offering halls.

In Kalinga, the ancient land of [[Sakta]] cult, divine iconography existed since the mythological era.  Present day research implies that idols (deities) were placed under auspicious Trees in the ancient days. And maybe today a Temple in general carries various minute details and the overall shape of some heritage tree. The various aspects of a typical Kalinga Temple include Architectural stipulations, Iconography, historical connotations and honoring the traditions, customs and associated legends.

==Architecture==

===Selecting people===
According to [[Manusmṛti]] there is a specific hierarchy of Command for the management of people involved in they are classified as:
# Kartā : The Chief patron of the temple, generally the king of the state is designated as kartā. Hence these devotional ancient architectures often reflect various socio-cultural aspects of society of the time.
# Mukhya Sthapati : The Chief Architect, The master of the [[Shilpa Shastras]], [[Vastu Shastra]], [[Dharma Shastra]], [[Agni Purana]] and Mathematical Calculations. Besides being a very knowledgeable person he is also a very pious man. He translates the Kartā's vision into an architectural design based on stipulations.
# Sutra Grahaṇi : The Chief Engineer (can be equated) as he is the person who translates the architecture into actual geometrical dimensions. He is equally proficient in all the required knowledge and most often is the son of the Mukhya Sthapati.
# Bārdhanikas : The masons, the stone setters
# Takṣaka : The sculptor with hands that create poetry in stone does all the magnificent carvings and engravings of various forms that has left us spell bound.

Besides these primary set of specialists, various supportive functions are carried out by other people.

===Material selection===
Primarily certain classes of stones are considered auspicious for the construction of Kalinga deula (temples). Shilpa Chandrika, an ancient architecture book define some specific seven varieties of stone as ideal and specific types are used for certain portions of the temple :

# Sahaṇa
# Chhita Sāhaṇa
# Baḍa Pagaḍa
# Dhobā Kuṇḍa
# Rasa Chiṇḍa
# Niḷa Kusāṇa

Though clay bricks have been used in very rare cases most Kalingan temples are built using these stones.

===Site Selection===
Various aspects like type of soil, shape of the Plot, location of the plot, availability and type of space and ground water level, etc. are taken into consideration while selecting the site. Color, density, composition and moisture content of the soil discriminates between the best, middle, sub-middle and worst kind of soil. Based on [[Vastu Shastra]], a rectangular, square, elliptical or circular plot of land is selected in order of preference.

=== Naga Bāndhēṇi ===
This is an intricate and ancient method in [[Shilpa Shastras|Shilpa Shastra]], by which the temples direction and the auspicious moment for beginning the sacred construction is determined. Like the present day [[Geomorphology]], [[Seismology]], [[Topology]] etc., probably this is some ancient science which guides the architect to understand natural forces and build stable massive structures in [[Odisha]].

=== Scale Model ===
The Mukhya Sthaptya (Main Sculptor similar to Chief Architect) creates a scale model based on traditional stipulations and takes the Karta's (producer / financier) approval. In many instances we see such depictions on walls and motifs.

== Potā and piṭha (Mobile Foundation)==
By observing conventional masonry and going through the following steps of the preparation of potā and piṭha the foundation of a temple could be understood:

# A square or rectangular area is dug out depending on the type and combination of temple proposed at the center of the preselected Nāgabandhani plot of land.
# The depth of this Potā is 1/3 of the height of the proposed temple, from plinth level.
# The length and width of this Potā (pit) is always sufficiently broader than the diameter of the proposed temple.
# Hard stone slabs are laid at the bottom to create a level.
# Then with uniformly cut hard stones, the four walls of the Potā are erected and the outer perimeter space between the pit wall and ground is properly filled with soil.
# The Asṭadala Padma Chakaḍā (Eight lotus petal shaped), is then laid at the exact spot required. This is a square or rectangular shape of hard uniform stone slab at the center of which an eight petaled lotus shape in exact geometric proportions is engraved. The petals are aligned to the north, north-east, east, southeast, south, south-west, west and north-west. The exact perpendicular line through the center of this Asṭadala Padma Chakaḍā determines the axis (rekhā/meru) of the temple. The traditional method of such alignment is termed as ''Sanku''.
# Thereafter the Potā is properly packed up with large pieces of stone and soil, probably pressed down by [[elephant]]s.
# The Potā (pit) is leveled off at ground level with huge and thick cut theodolite stones.
# Another layer of theodolite stones, corresponding to the shape and size of the ground plan called the piṭha is constructed. This is the base of the temple. In many instances, we see this piṭha at various levels of elevation.

=== Bhunaksā (the ground plan) ===
Keeping the Sanku (the vertical axis through the center of Asṭadala Padma Chakaḍā) as the exact center of ''Garbhagruha'', the ground plan of the proposed temple is engraved by the Sthapati and Sutragrahaṇi with the help of a sharp edged instrument, on the perfectly leveled Piṭha. As temples in every of their details depend on proportions, complex ancient methods are used for correct geometric designing and executing the ground plan (bhunaksa) to ensure long term stability and aesthetic appearance of these huge structures. Simplicity or intricacy of the temple is reflected in this ground plan.

Thereafter, the Bardhanikas set about precut stones, under the strict vigilance of Sutragrahaṇi as per the Bhunaksa, deula gaddanni has started.

== Deuḷa (Temple of Odisha) ==
Temple architecture in [[Orissa, India|Odisha]] evolved over a long period of time. Stipulated architectural principles with ample provision for artistic improvisation enabled the progressive generations. Temples in Odisha are based on certain fundamental principles of stability and take their cue from the human body. The superstructure is basically divided into three parts, the Bāḍa (Lower Limb), the Ganḍi (Body) and the Cuḷa/Mastaka (Head). Accordingly, each part is given a different treatment throughout, from the architecture to the final ornamentation of the Temple.

'''Khambhalida Caves''', or '''Rajkot Caves''', are three Buddhist caves located near [[Gondal, Gujarat|Gondal]] in [[Rajkot district]], [[Gujarat]], [[India]].

==Architecture==
P. P. Pandya, a prominent archeologist, discovered these Buddhist caves in 1958. These caves are maintained by the Archaeology Department of Gujarat state.

The caves are situated at the foot of small hillocks on the banks of a spring. They are carved out of [[limestone]] rocks. There are three caves, the central one contains the ''[[stupa]]'' which is known as ''chaitya'' cave. There are two sculptures of [[Bodhisattva]] on the either sides of the gate of the ''chaitya'' cave. On the left, the figure is probably [[Padmapani]] under [[Ashoka]]-like tree with a female companion and five attendants. There is a [[yaksha]]-like dwarf on the left of it holding a basket. The figure on the right is probably [[Vajrapani]] under Ashoka-like tree with similar attendants. The broad belts of female are similar to that of figures at [[Uparkot Caves]] of Junagadh. They are comparable to late [[Kushana]]-[[Western Satraps|Kshatapa]] period sculptures elsewhere as well as features some late Andhra mannerism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nanavati|first=J.

Supplementum|volume=26|pages=15–17|doi=10.2307/1522666}}&lt;/ref&gt; The caves are believed to have come into existence in the 4th or 5th century AD.&lt;ref name="Gujarat Tourism"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tourism Corporation of Gujarat Limited |title=Khambhalida Caves |url=http://www.gujarattourism.com/showpage.aspx?contentid=166&amp;webpartid=1690 |publisher=Gujarat Tourism, Govt. of Gujarat |accessdate=1 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127061525/http://www.gujarattourism.com/showpage.aspx?contentid=166&amp;webpartid=1690 |archivedate=27 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The another cave on the left is deep and huge and is open in the front. It may have used for meditation by the monks.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.discoveredindia.com/gujarat/attractions/caves/khambhalid-caves-rajkot.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 15 small caves situated near the Khambhalida caves. They are probably carved by the [[Lesser Vehicle]] branch of Buddhism.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

[[File:koshinscroll.jpg|thumb|A Kōshin scroll|right]]
{{nihongo|'''''Kōshin'''''|庚申|}} or {{nihongo|''Kōshin-shinkō''|庚申信仰|}} is a folk faith in [[Japan]] with [[Taoism|Taoist]] origins, influenced by [[Shinto]], [[Buddhism]] and other local beliefs. A typical event related to the faith is called {{nihongo|Kōshin-kō|庚申講|}}, held on the Kōshin days that occur every 60 days in accordance with the [[Chinese sexagenary cycle]].

On this day some believers stay awake to prevent {{nihongo|Sanshi|三尸|}}, entities believed to live inside the body of believers, from leaving it during that night in order to report the good and specially the bad deeds of the believer to the god Ten-Tei.

It is not clearly certain when such custom arrived or came into fashion in Japan, although it is believed that by some time in the 9th century it had been already practiced at least by aristocrats. A Japanese monk called [[Ennin]] wrote is his travel book upon visiting [[Tang dynasty|Tang China]] in 838, that "Tonight people are not sleeping. It is the same as in our country on Kōshin nights." In the [[Muromachi period]], [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]] started to write about the Kōshin, which led to wider popularity of the faith among public. Numerous monuments or pillars called {{nihongo|Kōshin-tō|庚申塔|}} (or also {{nihongo|Kōshin-zuka|庚申塚|}}) were erected all over the country and the faith remained very popular through the  [[Edo period]]. When the Meiji Government issued the [[Shinbutsu bunri|Shinto and Buddhism Separation Order]] in 1872, folk beliefs were turned down as superstitious, Kōshin belief too losing popularity as a result.

Today, the Kōshin belief still survives, although it is far less popular and receives smaller recognition than it once did, due to the absence of any central organization to help promote such faith because of its folkloric nature. While many Kōshin-tō were moved, for example, to inside Buddhist temples or even to private houses to be protected, there are many remaining along historical roads as well. There are also well maintained {{nihongo|Kōshin-dō|庚申堂|}}, built in respect for the Kōshin, sometimes attached to Buddhist temples, or otherwise in stand-alone.

==Deities and customs==
It is believed that Kōshin belief had arrived in Japan at the latest by the [[Heian period]], and was adopted only by the aristocracy in the beginning. The most ancient custom is that of staying awake one special night every sixty days. It is called ''Kōshin-Machi'' (庚申待 - Kōshin Waiting). During the early years this custom became a kind of overnight festivity or party.

The main Kōshin belief that survived from an original complex faith, is the concept that [[Three Corpses]], called ''Sanshi'' (三尸), live in everyone's body. The Sanshi keep track of the good deeds and particularly the bad deeds of the person they inhabit. On the night called Kōshin-Machi (which happens each 60 days), while the person sleeps, the ''Sanshis'' leave the body and go to [[King of Heavens|Ten-Tei]] (天帝), the Heavenly god, to report about the deeds of that person. Ten-Tei will then decide to punish bad people, making them ill, shortening their lifetime and in extreme cases putting an end to their lives. Believers of Kōshin will try to live a life without bad deeds, but those who have reason to fear will try to stay awake during Kōshin nights, as the only way to prevent the Sanshi from leaving the body and reporting to Ten-Tei.

In the [[Edo period]], Kōshin-Machi became more popular in other levels of society and with commoners, leading to a proliferation of festivities and cultic activities. Many of these practices convened around the worship of specific deities. These deities were visualized in hanging scrolls, icons, and stone carvings, many of which continue to dot the rural landscape of Japan today. One god of special prominence in the Kōshin cult was Shōmen-Kongō (Blue-Faced Vajra-Yakṣa), a fearsome blue-faced deity with many arms. Shōmen-Kongō's role connections with Kōshin belief and practice can be traced back as early as the late Heian period, if not earlier. The first scriptures that established such connections were significantly produced in the context of esoteric Buddhist rituals centered at Onjōji (a.k.a. Miidera). Another temple crucial in the early development of this cult was [[Shitennō-ji]].

[[Shōmen-Kongō]] became Kōshin-san when people expected this demon to make the Sanshis themselves ill and prevent them going to Ten-Tei. Shōmen-Kongō is not really a god but a demon who can send illnesses.

[[Three wise monkeys|Three monkeys]] covering eyes, mouth and ears with their hands are the best known symbols of Kōshin faith. They are ''Mizaru'' (not see), ''Iwazaru'' (not say) and ''Kikazaru'' (not hear). It is not very clear why the three monkeys became part of Kōshin belief, but is assumed that it is because like the monkeys, the Sanshis and Ten-Tei are not to see, hear, or tell the bad deeds of a person.

Statues of Shōmen-Kongō with the three monkeys have existed in temples and shrines since the Edo era. Sometimes carved stones called Kōshin-tō were placed around a dwelling for protection. Such stones can present diverse forms, from having only Chinese characters (kanji) to including a depiction of Shōmen- Kongō with one, two or three monkeys.

Other custom of the Kōshin belief are the use of paper scrolls also showing Kōshin-san and the monkeys which are displayed on Kōshin-machi, the Kōshin night. Those who keep this tradition invite neighbours, friends and relatives and sit in front of a provisory altar which has a bowl of rice, soup, seasonal fruit, flowers, candles and incense sticks. They also hang scrolls with pictures of Shōmen-Kongō. Everyone will try to stay awake through the whole night.

'''Lahutā''' (Pali) is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as  "lightness", and it is the basis for the following pair of [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings:
* ''Kāyalahutā'' - lightness of mental body (or lightness of cetisakas)
* ''Cittalahutā'' - lightness of consciousness (or lightness of citta)

These two mental factors have the characteristic of the subsiding of heaviness (garubhāva) in the mental body and consciousness, respectively.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2364-2366}}

==Definition==
Bhikkhu Bodhi states:{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2364-2366}}
:The twofold lightness has the characteristic of the subsiding of heaviness (garubhāva) in the mental body and consciousness, respectively. Its function is to crush heaviness. It is manifested as non-sluggishness. Its proximate cause is the mental body and consciousness. It should be regarded as opposed to such defilements as sloth and torpor, which create heaviness.

Nina van Gorkom explains:{{sfn|van Gorkom|2010|p=225}}
:According to the ''Dhammasangani'' (par 42, 43) this pair of cetasikas consists in the absence of sluggishness and inertia, they have “alertness in varying”. The meaning of this will be clearer when we read what the ''Mula-Tīkā'' states about lightness of citta: “the capacity of the mind to turn very quickly to a wholesome object or to the contemplation of impermanence, etc.”

The ''[[Atthasālinī]]'' (I, Book I, Part IV, Chapter I, 30) states:{{sfn|van Gorkom|2010|p=226}}
: Kāya-lightness is buoyancy of mental factors; citta-lightness is buoyancy of consciousness. They have the characteristic of suppressing the heaviness of the one and the other; the function of crushing heaviness in both; the manifestation of opposition to sluggishness in both, and have mental factors and consciousness as proximate cause. They are the opponents of the corruptions, such as sloth and torpor, which cause heaviness and rigidity in mental factors and consciousness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3241">[[File:Bishop Michael Reid.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Michael Reid]]'''Michael Reid''' (born 1944) was a Christian evangelist in [[Essex]], [[England]] and founder of [[Peniel Pentecostal Church]] (aka ''Michael Reid Ministries''). He resigned from the role of pastor at Peniel Church in April 2008 after admitting to an extra-marital sexual relationship.

==Biography==

Along with his wife, Rev. Ruth Reid, he travelled globally and claims to have witnessed miraculous healings through his ministry,&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/otherparties/comment/0,,448067,00.html "Stand by your man and put a ribbon in your hair"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 10 December 2000&lt;/ref&gt; although a 1999 investigation by the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] was unable to substantiate the claims.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,309715,00.html "Miracle ad does not wash with watchdog"], ''The Guardian'', 13 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/317131.stm "Church defends miracle cure campaign"], ''[[BBC News]]'', 12 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the author and co-author of several books and a founder member of the Christian Congress for Traditional Values (CCTV) to monitor challenges to family life and traditional belief in the UK. He was also a leading figure in the organisation's campaign challenging the BBC over its decision to screen ''[[Jerry Springer - The Opera]]'' on television.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/4606085.stm "Legal threat over Springer opera "], 3 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, Reid admitted to an extramarital sexual relationship and resigned from the leadership of Peniel Pentecostal Church, stating that "It is with great sorrow and regret that I have resigned from the church board and have stepped down from official duties. I confess that I have sinned by committing adultery. I recognize that I have failed in my duties and acted in a way that harmed the Church. I take full responsibility for my actions and so I resigned. I apologize to my wife and family and all of you whose trust I have betrayed and ask for your forgiveness and prayers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ni/2008/04/family_values_campaigner_resig_1.html BBC blog accessed 11 April 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talk2action.org/story/2008/4/8/8338/23733 Talk To Action blog], accessed 11 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beforeiforget.co.uk/2008/hypocrisy-is-the-greatest-luxury/ HYPOCRISY IS THE GREATEST LUXURY], BEFOREiFORGET blog 9 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article1017184.ece "Bash Bishop is a Jerry Sinner"], ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', 9 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=558365&amp;in_page_id=1770 "Bishop who preached family values finally admits: I am an adulterer"], ''[[The Daily Mail]]'', 10 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Minhaj-ul-Quran International]] has been working for the promotion of the peace and interfaith harmony around the world since its establishment. In India there was also established a unit of [[Minhaj-ul-Quran International]] known as Minhaj-ul-Quran International India for the same purpose of the promotion of the peace and interfaith harmony. There were and are being organised a number of programs based on the Islamic concept of peace and education to make people aware of their responsibilities.

'''Muhūrt''' ({{lang-sa|मुहूर्त}}) is a  [[Hindu units of measurement|Hindu unit of measurement]] for time along with nimesh, kāṣṭhā and kalā&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hinduism for Children Activity Workbook|last=Verma|first=Dinesh|publisher=Chanda Books|year=2008|isbn=9781440499913|location=|pages=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Hindu calendar]].

In the [[Brāhmaṇas]], ''muhūrta'' denotes a division of time: one-thirtieth of a day, or a period of forty-eight minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 10, I, I (for the names); 9, 7; 12, 9, 6; Śatapata Brāhmaṇa, x. 4, 2, 18. 25. 27; 3, 20; xii. 3, 2, 5; x. 4, 4, 4, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; The sense "moment" is also common in the Brāhmanạs.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 9, 139 et seq.; Indische Streifen, I, 92, et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Rigveda]]&lt;ref&gt;Rigveda iii. 33, 5: 53, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; we only find the sense "moment."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Anthony Macdonnell and [[Arthur Berriedale Keith]], ''Vedic Index of Names and Subjects,'' vol. 2, p. 169. Motilal Banarsidas, London 1912, reprint 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further each muhūrta is further divided into 30 (Indian) minutes or kalā (making 30 Kalā ≈ 48 western min). Each kalā is further divided into 30 (Indian) seconds or Kāṣṭhā, making 30 Kāṣṭhā ≈ 1.6 western minute.

==Etymology==
The "Sandhi Vidchhed" for the term is thus: It breaks muhūrt into two parts, "muhu" (moment/immediate) and "ṛta" (order). The author of Ṛg Ved III.33.5 has accordingly created this descriptive term. [[Rta|Ṛta]] refers to the natural, yearly order of the seasons, so that the term muhūrt refers to the daily reflection of these. Also, cf., ''Śatpath Brāhmaṇa'' X.4.2.18, as below.

==Usage in the Vedic Period==
The term appears as early as the Ṛg Veda, where, according to Monier Williams, it means "a moment",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0825-mugdha.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; but does not evidence any specification of an exact periodicity there as received in later works, such as the  ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana|Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa]]'', "The One Hundred Path Riddle" or the ''[[Taittiriya Brahmana|Taittirīya-Brāhmaṇa]]'', "The Partridge's Riddle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Index of Names and Subjects, Volume 2; Volume 5|page=169|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|author=Arthur Anthony Macdonell |author2=Arthur Berriedale Keith|date=1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U5GaKHfNzScC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pt. Vijay Shrikrishna Jakatdar points to two specific Ṛg Veda passages that employ the term, III.33.5, and III.53.8:&lt;ref name="ebookbrowsee.net"&gt;http://ebookbrowsee.net/filedownload-php-v-8-a-y-b-y-f-71-muhurtaaconcepttobeamendedaspermoderntimesbw-pdf-d169899279&lt;/ref&gt;

पर सिन्धुमछा बर्हती मनीषावस्युरह्वे कुशिकस्य सूनुः ||

"Linger a little at my friendly bidding rest, Holy Ones, a ''moment'' in your journey.
With hymn sublime soliciting your favour Kuśika's son hath called unto the River." (trans. [[Ralph T. H. Griffith]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv03033.htm&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
and

रूपं-रूपं मघवा बोभवीति मायाः कर्ण्वानस्तन्वं परि सवाम | 
तरिर्यद दिवः परि मुहूर्तमागात सवैर्मन्त्रैरन्र्तुपा रतावा ||

"Maghavan weareth every shape at pleasure, effecting magic changes in his body,
Holy One, drinker out of season, coming thrice, in a ''moment'', through fit prayers, from heaven." (ibid.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv03053.htm&lt;/ref&gt;)

According to Authur Anthony Macdonell and Authur Berriedale, the Taittirīya-Brāhmaṇa mentions the names of 15 muhūrtas:

''(1) saṁjñānaṁ (2) vijñānaṁ (3) prajñānaṁ (4) jānad (5) abhijānat'' |&lt;br&gt;
''(6) saṁkalpamānaṁ (7) prakalpamānam (8) upakalpamānam (9) upakḷptaṁ (10) kḷptam'' |&lt;br&gt;
''(11) śreyo (12)  vasīya (13) āyat (14) saṁbhūtaṁ (15) bhūtam'' |&lt;br&gt;
''citraḥ ketuḥ prabhānābhānt saṁbhān'' |&lt;br&gt;
''jyotiṣmaṁs-tejasvānātapaṁs-tapann-abhitapan'' |&lt;br&gt;
''rocano rocamānaḥ śobhanaḥ śobhamānaḥ kalyāṇaḥ'' |&lt;br&gt;
''darśā dṛṣṭā darśatā viṣvarūpā surdarśanā'' |&lt;br&gt;
''āpy-āyamāṇāpyāyamānāpyāyā su-nṛterā'' |&lt;br&gt;
''āpūryamāṇā pūryamāṇā pūryantī pūrṇā paurṇamāsī'' |&lt;br&gt;
''dātā pradātā'nando modaḥ pramodaḥ ''|| III.10.1.1 ||

Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa describes a muhūrta as 1/15th portion of a day:

átʰa yaccáturviṃśatimātmáno'kuruta |
tásmāc-cátur-viṃśaty-ardʰa-māsaḥ saṃ-vatsaraḥ sá etaiś-cátur-viṃśatyā triṃ-śád-iṣṭakair-ātmábʰir-na vyábʰavat-sa páñca-daśā́hno rūpā́ṇy-apaśyad-ātmánas-tanvò muhūrtā́lokam-pr̥ṇāḥ páñca-daśaiva rā́tres-tadyán-muhu trā́yante tásmān-muhurtā átʰa yát-kṣudrāḥ sánta imā́ṃ-lokā́n-āpūráyanti tásmāl-lokam-pr̥ṇā́ḥ || (X.4.2.18)

It is stated in ''[[Manusmṛti]]'' that 18 nimeṣas (twinklings of the eye) are 1 Kāṣṭhā, 30 Kāṣṭhās are 1 Kāla, 30 Kālas are one Muhūrta, and 30 Muhūrtas are one day and night.

==Ritual Significance==
It is a common practice in Hinduism to perform or avoid activities like important religious ceremonies on the basis of the quality of a particular Muhūrta.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Demystifying Brahminism and Re-Inventing Hinduism: Volume 1 - Demystifying Brahminism|last=Shri|first=Satya|publisher=Notion Press|year=2017|isbn=9781946515544|location=Chennai|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://dheivegam.com/tamil-muhurtham-dates/ | title=Tamil Muhurtham dates | publisher=Dheivegam}}&lt;/ref&gt; One or more Muhūrtas are recommended by the Vedic scriptures when performing rituals and other ceremonies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is demonstrated in the way "Muhūrt" is used in present-day South Asia for calculating the most auspicious moment for a Vedic-Hindu Wedding ceremony. Astrologers are often hired to calculate a moment for the wedding so that any possible divinely-sourced problems can be averted. Jakatdar suggests a shift in the contemporary temperament regarding the traditional approach to calculating such events, to accommodate the ever increasing complexity of modern life.&lt;ref name="ebookbrowsee.net"/&gt; The muhūrt has the same utility in the marriage rites in Brahmanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency, Volume 20|last=Sholapur|first=|publisher=Government Central Press|year=1884|isbn=|location=Bombay|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another example is the so-called Brahma Muhūrta, which is about one and a half hours before sunrise. This particular time, which is associated with the constellations during the Vernal Equinox, is said to be auspicious for practicing yoga.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is also the case of ''samayik'', which is part of the initiation rite for the ''Svetambar'' mendicants or those who pursue a perpetual state of heightened meditative awareness. They take the ''samayik,'' a vow for life taken for short periods, preferably one or two muhūrts, where one muhūrt constitutes forty minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jains in the World: Religious Values and Ideology in India|last=Cort|first=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0195132343|location=Oxford|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yearly Calibration==
The Muhūrtas are traditionally calculated{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} by assuming sunrise at 06:00 AM on the Vernal Equinox, which is the Vedic New Year.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Not all of the constellations cross the zenith, so that it is not in every case clear which constellation presides over the Muhūrta. Yet it is clear that one or more prominent features of the correlate constellations, from which the later Muhūrtas draw their respective names, falls within the Celestial Longitude of the same, drawn from the Polar Axis.

==Significance==
Traditionally, it is common practice amongst [[Hindu]]s to start or avoid starting significant tasks like religious ceremonies, etc. on the basis of the quality of a particular Muhūrta. The [[Vedas|Vedic scriptures]] also generally recommend one or more Muhūrtas to perform rituals and practices. The most widely known example of this practice:

* [[Brahma muhurta|Brahma Muhūrta]], approximately one and a half hours before sunrise or more precisely is 1Hr 36 Mins. i.e. 96 Minutes = 2 Muhūrta or 4 Ghaṭīkā, is recommended in all practices of [[yoga]] is traditionally considered most apt for [[meditation]].&lt;ref name="brahma-muhurta" /&gt; However, it is clear from the associations of the names with specific constellations that the present Brahma-Muhūrta starts just before 6:00AM during the Vernal Equinox. At present, Jīva-Amṛta and Viṣṇu comprise the two twilight muhūrtas prior to sunrise.

He is also probably the first and one of the best known martyrs of the early Bábí period.{{sfn|Momen|2009}}{{sfn|Winters|1997}}

== Biography ==

=== Early Life ===
He was born near the small city of [[Bastam]] in northwestern [[Persian Empire|Persia]] during the reign of the [[Qajar dynasty]].{{sfn|Amanat|1989|p=212}} He married in his youth and had at least one child.{{Sfn|Momen|1982|p=}} As a young man gained a reputation for his interest in religion and studied as a [[Mullah]] in the shrine city of [[Mashhad]] as a young man.

In Mashhad he became familiar with local clerics who were associated with the [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] [[Shaykhism|Shaykhí]] denomination of [[Shia Islam]] and was attracted to Shaykhí doctrine.{{Sfn|Amanat|1989|p=176}} Eventually he moved to [[Karbala]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and studied under [[Kazim Rashti|Siyyid Kazim Rashti]] then the leader of Shaykhism for at least seven years.

=== Conversion to Bábism ===
Shaykis expected the imminent arrival of the [[Al-Qa'im (person)|Qa'im]] or [[Mahdi]], and after the death of Siyyid Kazim in January 1844,{{sfn|Momen|1982}} Bastámí led a group of Shaykhís who—along with a group led by [[Mullá Husayn]] sought out the expected Mahdi. {{sfn|Amanat|1989|p=176}} On May 22nd, 1844 Mullá Husayn became the first Shayki to accept a [[Shiraz|Shirazi]] merchant named [[Báb|Siyyid ʿAli Muhammad]] as the Mahdi predicted in [[Islamic eschatology]]; Bastámí reportedly converted rapidly after hearing some verses of the [[Selections from the Writings of the Báb|Qayyúmu'l-Asmá']] written by Ali Muhammad.{{sfn|Amanat|1989|p=176}} ʿAli Muhammad would later take on the title of the Báb, meaning "gate" in Arabic and declare himself to be a [[Manifestation of God]] founding the new religion of [[Bábism]]. Bastámí accepted the Báb as the Mahdi on their first meeting and was appointed by him to the position of one of eighteen [[Letters of the Living]] and identified as the allegorical return of the Shia [[Ali|Imam 'Ali]].{{sfn|Amanat|1989|p=176}} Most sources identify him as the second Letter of the Living, but a minority say he was the fourth. A [[Tablet (religious)|tablet]] was addressed by the Báb to each of the Letters of the Living, including Bastámí; no translation of this tablet into English exists at present.

=== Trial in Baghdad ===
The Báb gave Bastámí the very specific mission of leaving Persia and travelling to the holy [[Shi'a]]  shrine cities of [[Najaf]] and Karbala in modern-day Iraq about the summer of 1844.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/chronology_principal_events_dawn-breakers Chronology of Principal Events Related in the Dawn-Breakers], Bahai-library.com&lt;/ref&gt; It was here he was to announce the Báb's mission to [[Ijtihad|mujtahid]] Shaykh Muhammad Hasan,{{sfn|Momen|2009}} a senior member of the Shi'a clergy. He was put on trial for heresy on the basis of a copy of the [[Qayyúmu'l-Asmá']] in his possession on 13 January 1845 by a combined jury of Shi'a and Sunni clerics.{{sfn|Momen|2009}} The trial spun into a political event pitting Ottoman/Sunni interests against Shi'a/Persian interests - the Sunni clergy wanted Bastamí to be immediately executed while the Shi'a clergy insisted only on banishment and Persian politicians requested his removal to Persia.{{sfn|Momen|2009}} Instead, in April, he was transferred to Istanbul where he was further sentenced to hard labour in Istanbul's docks.{{sfn|Momen|2009}} Persian politicians continued insisting but when the Ottoman's finally agreed, 4 December 1846, it was found he had died a few days later and was accounted to be the first Bábi martyr by Bábis and Bahá'ís.{{sfn|Momen|2009}} After his death a [[Ziyarat|visitation prayer]] was revealed by the Báb in his honor.{{sfn|MacEoin|1994|p=27}}

A '''multifaith space''' or '''multifaith prayer room''' is a quiet location set aside in a busy public place (hospital, university, airport, etc.) where people of differing [[religious belief]]s, or none at all, are able to spend time in contemplation or prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What are MFS?|work=[[University of Manchester]]|url=http://www.multi-faith-spaces.org|first=Chris|last=Hewson|date=March 1, 2012|accessdate= September 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these spaces are "small, clean and largely unadorned areas", which can be adapted and serve for any religious or spiritual practice.&lt;ref name=Manchester&gt;{{cite news|title=Multi-faith Spaces: Symptoms and Agents of Religious and Social Change|work=[[University of Manchester]]|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/mfs|first=Chris|last=Hewson|date=January 1, 2010|accessdate= September 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rarely, persons of different faiths may come together in such spaces within the context of [[multifaith]] [[Service of worship|worship services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Queens Courier]]|title=St. John's Multifaith Service Honors WTC Victims|url=http://www.queenscourier.com/articles/2001/10/18/import/20011018-archive1.txt|first=Joe|last=Orlando|date=October 18, 2001|accessdate=January 19, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716022150/http://www.queenscourier.com/articles/2001/10/18/import/20011018-archive1.txt|archivedate=July 16, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Rare Show of Mutual Regard|first=Jacqueline Ann|last=Surin|work=[[The Sun (Malaysia)|theSun]]|url=http://www.thesundaily.com/article.cfm?id=19486|date=September 27, 2007|accessdate=January 19, 2010}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent research project at the [[University of Manchester]], [[UK]] has conceptualised the modern multifaith space as "an intentional space, designed to both house a plurality of religious practices, as well as address clearly defined pragmatic purposes."&lt;ref name=Manchester /&gt;

==Design concepts==
[[File:MultifaithAblutionFacility.jpg|thumb|[[Ritual purification|Ablution]] facility in the [[University of Toronto]]'s multifaith building]]
The Manchester University research highlighted two key factors for a multifaith space to work:

* There needs to be a balance achieved for the range of different users most likely to make regular use of the space, thus preventing conflict. All norms and values need to be considered and respected, which often leads to an "unstable equilibrium where divergent worldviews can be brought together." Social cooperation and openness must be possible within the space.
* Most multifaith spaces maintain a very basic design, in order to minimize the visibility of a single faith group, whilst remaining easily adaptable to the many different practices for which the space may be utilized. Each space raises question of ethics and "national style", in which different faith members are able to participate in a mutually respectful, yet cooperative, manner.&lt;ref name=Manchester /&gt;

{{Status of religious freedom |persecution}}
'''Persecution of Muslims''' is the [[religious persecution]] inflicted upon followers of the [[Islam]]ic faith. This page lists incidents in both [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[modern history]] in which [[Muslim]] populations have been targeted for persecution by non-Muslim groups.

==Medieval==
{{See also|Shaheed}}

===Early Islam===
{{Main|Persecution of Muslims by the Meccans}}
In the early days of Islam at [[Mecca]], the new Muslims were often subjected to abuse and persecution by the [[pagan]] Meccans (often called ''Mushrikin'': the unbelievers or [[polytheist]]s). Some were killed, such as [[Sumayyah bint Khabbab]], the seventh convert to Islam, who was allegedly tortured first by [[Amr ibn Hishām]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | edition = 2nd| publisher = [[Brill Academic Publishers]]| volume = 7| pages = 360–376| last2 = Welch| first2 = A.T.| last1=Buhl | first1 = F.| title = Muḥammad| encyclopedia = [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]| isbn = 9004094199| year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''An Introduction to the Quran'' (1895), p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;
Even the Islamic [[Muhammad in Islam|Prophet Muhammad]] was subjected to such abuse; while he was praying near the [[Kaaba]], [[Uqba ibn Abu Mu'ayt]] threw the [[entrail]]s of a sacrificed camel over him. Abu Lahab's wife [[Umm Jamil]] would regularly dump filth outside his door and placed thorns in the path to his house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From the Beginning of Revelation|url=http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/MH_LM/from_the_beginning_of_revelation.htm |accessdate=19 September 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109035218/http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/MH_LM/from_the_beginning_of_revelation.htm |archivedate=9 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, if free Muslims were attacked, slaves who converted were subjected to far worse. The master of the [[Ethiopia]]n [[Bilal ibn Rabah]] (who would become the first [[muezzin]]) would take him out into the desert in the boiling heat of midday and place a heavy rock on his chest, demanding that he forswear his religion and pray to the polytheists' gods and goddesses, until [[Abu Bakr]] bought him and freed him.&lt;ref&gt;Janneh, Sabarr.

=== Crusades ===
The [[First Crusade]] was launched in 1095 by [[Pope Urban II]], with the stated goal of regaining control of the sacred city of [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Holy Land]] from the Muslims, who had captured them from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] in 638. The Fatimid Caliph, Al Hakim of Cairo, known as the "mad Caliph"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rOdpBdorm8wC&amp;pg=PA245#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Keys to Jerusalem: Collected Essays|last=Murphy-O'Connor|first=Jerome|date=2012-02-23|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0199642021|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; destroyed the ancient and magnificent Constantine Church of the Holy Sepulcher in 1009, as well as [[Fatimid desecration of Jerusalem|most other Christian churches and shrines in the Holy Land]].

This, in conjunction with the killings of Germanic pilgrims traveling to Jerusalem from Byzantium, raised the anger of Europe, and inspired Pope Urban II to call on all Catholic Rulers, Knights and Gentleman to recapture the Holy Land from Muslim rule.

It was also partly a response to the [[Investiture Controversy]], which was the most significant [[Separation of church and state (medieval)|conflict between secular and religious]] powers in [[medieval Europe]]. The controversy began as a dispute between the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and the [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregorian Papacy]] and gave rise to the political concept of [[Christendom]] as a union of all peoples and sovereigns under the direction of the pope; as both sides tried to marshal public opinion in their favor, people became personally engaged in a dramatic religious controversy. Also of great significance in launching the crusade were the string of victories by the Seljuk Turks, which saw the end of Arab rule in Jerusalem.

[[File:Counquest of Jeusalem (1099).jpg|thumb|Capture of Jerusalem by the Crusaders in 1099]]
On 7 May 1099 the crusaders reached [[Jerusalem]], which had been recaptured from the [[Seljuks]] by the [[Fatimid]]s of Egypt only a year before. On 15 July, the crusaders were able to end the siege by breaking down sections of the walls and entering the city. Over the course of that afternoon, evening and next morning, the crusaders killed almost every inhabitant of Jerusalem. Muslims and Jews alike. Although many Muslims sought shelter atop the [[Temple Mount]] inside the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], the crusaders spared few lives. According to the anonymous ''[[Gesta Francorum]]'', in what some believe to be one of the most valuable contemporary sources of the First Crusade, "...the slaughter was so great that our men waded in blood up to their ankles...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/cde-jlem.html#gesta2 |title=King John of England: Royal Licenses to Export and Import, 1205–1206 |website=Fordham.edu |accessdate=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tancred]] claimed the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple quarter]] for himself and offered protection to some of the Muslims there, but he was unable to prevent their deaths at the hands of his fellow crusaders. According to Fulcher of Chartres: "Indeed, if you had been there you would have seen our feet coloured to our ankles with the blood of the slain. But what more shall I relate? None of them were left alive; neither women nor children were spared."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/cde-jlem.html#fulcher1 |title=King John of England: Royal Licenses to Export and Import, 1205–1206 |website=Fordham.edu |accessdate=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the First Crusade and the massacre at Jerusalem, it has been reported that the Crusaders "[circled] the screaming, flame-tortured humanity singing 'Christ We Adore Thee!' with their Crusader crosses held high".&lt;ref&gt;Rausch, David (1990), ''Legacy of Hatred: Why Christians Must Not Forget the Holocaust'', Baker Pub Group, {{ISBN|0801077583}}, p.  27&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims were indiscriminately killed, and Jews who had taken refuge in their Synagogue were killed when it was burnt down by the Crusaders.

===Southern Italy===
{{Further|History of Islam in southern Italy|Emirate of Sicily|Muslim settlement of Lucera|Muslim conquest of Sicily}}

The island of [[Sicily]] was conquered by the [[Aghlabids]] by the 10th century after over a century of conflict, with the [[Byzantine Empire]] losing their final stronghold in 965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archaeology.stanford.edu/MountPolizzo/handbookPDF/MPHandbook5.pdf|publisher=Archaeology.Stanford.edu|title=Brief history of Sicily|date=7 October 2007|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609094555/http://archaeology.stanford.edu/MountPolizzo/handbookPDF/MPHandbook5.pdf|archivedate=9 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Italo-Norman|Normans]] conquered the last Arab Muslim stronghold by 1091.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=ABC-CLIO|title=Faiths Across Time: 5,000 Years of Religious History [4 Volumes]: 5,000 Years of Religious History|page=713|date=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, taxes were imposed on the Muslim minority called the ''jizya'' (locally spelled ''gisia'') which was a continuation of the [[jizya]] imposed on non-Muslims in Sicily, by Muslim rulers in the 11th century, before the Norman conquest. Another tax on levied them for a time was the ''augustale''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shlomo Simonsohn|title=Between Scylla and Charybdis: The Jews in Sicily|publisher= Brill |page= 163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim rebellion broke out during the reign of [[Tancred, King of Sicily|Tancred]] as [[King of Sicily]]. Lombard pogroms against Muslims started in the 1160s. Muslim and Christian communities in Sicily became increasingly geographically separated. The island's Muslim communities were mainly isolated beyond an internal frontier which divided the south-western half of the island from the Christian north-east. Sicilian Muslims, a subject population, were dependent on royal protection. When [[William II of Sicily|King William the Good]] died in 1189, this royal protection was lifted, and the door was opened for widespread attacks against the island's Muslims. Islam was no longer a major presence in the island by the 14th century. Toleration of Muslims ended with increasing Hohenstaufen control. Many repressive measures, passed by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], were introduced in order to please the Popes who could not tolerate Islam being practiced in the heart of [[Christendom]], which resulted in a rebellion of Sicily's Muslims. This in turn triggered organized resistance and systematic reprisals and marked the final chapter of Islam in Sicily. The rebellion abated, but direct papal pressure induced Frederick to mass transfer all his Muslim subjects deep into the Italian hinterland, to [[Lucera]]. Following this, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|King Frederick]] embarked on deporting Muslims from Sicily to [[Lucera]] where they were allowed to practice their faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Luscombe|author2=Jonathan Riley-Smith|title=The New Cambridge Medieval History: Volume 4, c. 1024 – c. 1198|publisher= Cambridge University Press |page= 470}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Philip Grierson|author2=Lucia Travaini|title=Medieval European Coinage: Volume 14, South Italy, Sicily, Sardinia: With a Catalogue of the Coins in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge|publisher= Cambridge University Press |page= 184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;A.Lowe: The Barrier and the bridge; p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Pierre|last=Aubé|title=Roger Ii De Sicile – Un Normand En Méditerranée|publisher=Payot|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aghlabids also conquered the island of [[Malta]] at the same time during their invasion of Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Idris El Harier|author2=Ravane Mbaye|title=The Spread of Islam Throughout the World|publisher= UNESCO|page= 441}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per the [[Kitab al-Rawd al-Mitar|Al-Himyari]] the island was reduced to an uninhabited ruin due to the conquest. The place was later converted into a settlement by Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blouet|first1=Brian W.|title=The Story of Malta|date=2007|publisher=Allied Publications|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Normans conquered it as the same time as Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dennis Angelo Castillo|title=The Maltese Cross: A Strategic History of Malta|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Normans however didn't interfere in the matters of Muslims of the island and gave them a tributary status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mario Buhagiar|title=The late Medieval art and architecture of the Maltese islands|publisher=University of Michigan|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their conquest however led to the [[Christianisation]] and [[Latinization (historical)|Latinisation]] of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Joe Zammit-Ciantar |title=Symposia Melitensia 4|publisher=University of Malta|page=150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An annual fine on the Christian community for killing of a Muslim was also repealed in the 12th century, signifying the degradation of the protection given to the Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Metcalfe|title=Muslims of Medieval Italy|publisher= Edinburgh University Press|page= 285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Maltese Muslims were deported by 1271.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dante and Islam|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=238|author=Jan M. Ziolkowski}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Maltese Muslims had converted to Christianity by the end of the 15th century and had to find ways to disguise their previous identities by Latinizing or adopting new surnames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Malta, Mediterranean Bridge|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=24|author=Stefan Goodwin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1224, [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], responding to religious uprisings in [[Sicily]], expelled all Muslims from the island, transferring many to Lucera (''Lugêrah'', as it was known in Arabic) over the next two decades. In this controlled environment, they could not challenge royal authority and they benefited the crown in taxes and military service. Their numbers eventually reached between 15,000 and 20,000, leading Lucera to be called ''Lucaera Saracenorum'' because it represented the last stronghold of Islamic presence in Italy. During peacetime, Muslims in Lucera were predominantly farmers. They grew [[durum]] wheat, [[barley]], [[legume]]s, grapes and other fruits. Muslims also kept bees for [[honey]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Muslim settlement of Lucera]] was destroyed by [[Charles II of Naples]] with backing from the papacy. The Muslims were either massacred, forcibly converted, enslaved or exiled. Their abandoned mosques were demolished, and churches were usually built in their place. The [[Lucera Cathedral]] was built on the site of a mosque which was destroyed. The mosque was the last one still functioning in [[medieval Italy]] by that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Julie Anne Taylor|title=Muslims in Medieval Italy: The Colony at Lucera|publisher= Lexington Books |page= 208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Nicolle|title=European Medieval Tactics (2): New Infantry, New Weapons 1260–1500|publisher= Bloomsbury|page= 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Norman Dariel|title=The Arabs and the Medieval Europe|publisher= UCD Library|page= 156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Metcalfe|title=Muslims of Medieval Italy|publisher= Edinburgh University Press|page= 294}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julie Taylor.

===Mongol invasions===
[[Genghis Khan]], and the following Yuan Emperors in China forbade Islamic practices like halal butchering, forcing Mongol methods of butchering animals on Muslims, and other restrictive degrees continued. Muslims had to slaughter sheep in secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hUEswLE4SWUC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=yuan+dynasty+halal&amp;q=yuan+dynasty+halal#v=onepage&amp;q=chinggis%20khan%20forbidden%20halal&amp;f=false|title=China's Muslim Hui community: migration, settlement and sects|author=Michael Dillon|year=1999|publisher=Curzon Press|location=Richmond|page=24|isbn=0700710264|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genghis Khan directly referred to Muslims as "slaves", and he demanded that they follow the Mongol method of eating rather than the halal one. [[Circumcision]] was also forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicpopulation.com/asia/China/China_integration%20of%20religious%20minority.pdf|title=The Integration of Religious Minorities in China: The Case of Chinese Muslims|author=Donald Daniel Leslie|year=1998|page=12|publisher=The Fifty-ninth George Ernest Morrison Lecture in Ethnology|accessdate=30 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217112014/http://islamicpopulation.com/asia/China/China_integration%20of%20religious%20minority.pdf|archivedate=17 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=N7_4Gr9Q438C&amp;pg=PA230&amp;dq=yuan+dynasty+halal&amp;q=yuan+dynasty+halal#v=onepage&amp;q=%20halal%20chinggis%20khan%20you%20are%20our%20slaves%20&amp;f=false|title=Buddhism and Islam on the Silk Road|author=Johan Elverskog|year=2010|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|edition=illustrated|location=|page=228|isbn=0812242378|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of their rule, the corruption of the Mongol court and the persecution of Muslims became so severe that Muslim generals joined [[Han Chinese]] in rebelling against the Mongols. The [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim generals like [[Lan Yu (general)|Lan Yu]] who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat. Some Muslim communities had the name "kamsia," which, in [[Hokkien]] Chinese, means "thank you"; many Hui Muslims claim that their communities were named "kamsia"because the Han Chinese appreciated the important role they played in assisting them to overthrow the Mongols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kkJwAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Thus%2C+Changying+means+either+%22many+thanks%22+to+the+Hui+who+helped+drive+out+the+Mongols%2C+or+the+%22many+barracks%22+of+the+Hui+militia+eventually+established+there.+This+reflects+the+popular+belief+among+the+Hui+that+they+played+an+important&amp;q=popular+belief+mongols|title=Muslim Chinese: ethnic nationalism in the People's Republic|author=Dru C.

{{Further|Battle of Baghdad (1258)|Mongol invasions of Syria}}
[[File:Baghdad old Abbasid Minaret.jpg|175px|right|thumb|Site where the [[Mongol]] ruler [[Hulegu Khan]] destroyed a [[Baghdad]] mosque during the [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|sack of Baghdad]].]]
Following the brutal [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia]] under [[Genghis Khan]], and after the [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|sack of Baghdad]], the [[Mongol Empire]]'s rule extended across most Muslim lands in Asia. The [[Abbasid caliphate]] was destroyed and the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]] suffered much devastation, especially in [[Mesopotamia]], and [[Tengriism]] and [[Buddhism]] replaced it as the official religion of the empire.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown, Daniel W. (2003), '' New Introduction to Islam'', Blackwell Publishing, pp. 185–87, {{ISBN|0631216049}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Mongols attacked people for goods and riches and not because of their religion. Later, many Mongol khans and rulers themselves became Muslims such as [[Oljeitu]] and other [[Ilkhanid]] and [[Golden Horde]] rulers and inhabitants. There was no real effort to replace Islam with any other religion, just the desire to plunder goods from anyone who didn't submit, which was characteristic of Mongol warfare. During the [[Yuan Dynasty]] that the Mongols founded, Muslim scientists were highly regarded and Muslim beliefs were [[Islam during the Yuan dynasty|respected]]. On the Mongol attacks, the Muslim historian, [[Ali ibn al-Athir|ibn al-Athir]] lamented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I shrank from giving a recital of these events on the account of their magnitude and abhorrence. Even now I come reluctant to the task, for who would deem it a light thing to sing the death song of Islam and the Muslims or find it easy to tell this tale? O that my mother had not given me birth!&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Thomas Walker, ''The preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith'', p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The detailed atrocities include:
* The [[House of Wisdom|Grand Library of Baghdad]], containing countless precious historical documents and books on subjects ranging from medicine to astronomy, was destroyed. Survivors said that the waters of the [[Tigris]] ran black with ink from the enormous quantities of books that were flung into the river.
* Citizens attempted to flee, but they were intercepted by Mongol soldiers who killed them with abandon. Martin Sicker writes that close to 90,000 people may have died (Sicker 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;111). Other estimates go much higher. [[Wassaf]] claims the loss of life was several hundred thousand. Ian Frazier of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' says estimates of the death toll have ranged from 200,000 to a million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ian |last=Frazier |url= http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/050425fa_fact4 |title=Annals of history: Invaders: Destroying Baghdad |work= [[The New Yorker]] |date=25 April 2005 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Mongols looted and then destroyed mosques, palaces, libraries, and hospitals. Grand buildings that had been the work of generations were burned to the ground.
* The caliph was captured and forced to watch as his citizens were murdered and his treasury was plundered. According to most accounts, the caliph was killed by trampling. The Mongols rolled the caliph up in a rug, and rode their horses over him, because they believed that the earth would be offended if it were ever touched by royal blood. All but one of his sons were killed, and the sole surviving son was sent to Mongolia.
* [[Hulagu Khan|Hulagu]] had to move his camp upwind of the city, due to the stench of decay that emanated from its ruins.

At the intervention of Hulagu's [[Nestorian Christian]] wife, [[Dokuz Khatun]], the city's Christian inhabitants were spared.&lt;ref&gt;Maalouf, 243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Runciman, 306&lt;/ref&gt; Hulagu offered the royal palace to the Nestorian [[Catholicos]] [[Mar Makikha]], and he ordered that a cathedral should be built for him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Foltz]], ''Religions of the Silk Road'', New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the seventh ruler of the Ilkhanate dynasty, [[Mahmud Ghazan]], converted from Tengrism to Islam, and thus began the gradual trend of the decline of Tengrism and Buddhism in the region and its replacement by the renaissance of Islam. Later, three of the four principal Mongol khanates embraced Islam.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia Americana'', Grolier Incorporated, p. 680&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iberian Peninsula===
{{Main|Expulsion of the Moriscos|Islam in Spain}}
{{See also|Morisco rebellions in Granada}}

Arabs relying largely on [[Berber people|Berbers]] [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquered the Iberian Peninsula starting in 711]], subduing the whole [[Visigothic Kingdom]] by 725. The triumphant [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] got conditional capitulations probably in most of the towns, so that they could get a compromise with the native population. This was not always so. For example, Mérida, Cordova, Toledo, or Narbonne were conquered by storm or after laying siege on them. The arrangement reached with the locals was based on respecting the laws and traditions used in each place, so that the ''Goths'' (a legal concept, not an ethnic one, i.e. the communities ruled by the ''[[Forum Iudicum]]'') continued to be ruled on new conditions by their own tribunals and laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1995 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710-797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 0631194053|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gothic Church remained in place and collaborated with the new masters. [[Al-Andalus]] or Muslim ruled Iberian peninsula, was conquered by northern Christian kingdoms in 1492, as a result of their expansion taking place especially after the definite collapse of the [[Caliphate of Cordova]] in 1031.

The coming of the Crusades (starting with the [[War of Barbastro|massacre of Barbastro]]) and similarly entrenched positions on the northern African [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]], who took over al-Andalus as of 1086, added to the difficult coexistence between communities, including Muslims in Christian ruled territory, or the [[Mozarabic rite]] Christians (quite different from those of the northern kingdoms), and further minority groups. The Almohads, a fanatic north African sect, pushed the boundaries of religious intolerance during their occupation of al-Andalus, affecting also the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history/Ancient_and_Medieval_History/632-1650/Islamic_World/Jewish-Muslim_Relations/Almohads.shtml|title=The Almohads – My Jewish Learning|website=Myjewishlearning.com|accessdate=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Embarco moriscos en el Grao de valencia.jpg|thumb|[[Expulsion of the Moriscos]] from Valencia]]
During the expansion south of the northern Christian kingdoms, depending on the local capitulations, local Muslims were allowed to remain ([[Mudéjar]]s) with some restrictions, while some were assimilated into the Christian faith. After the [[conquest of Granada]], all the Spanish Muslims were under Christian rule. The new acquired population spoke Arabic or [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]], and the campaigns to convert them were unsuccessful. Legislation was gradually introduced to remove Islam, culminating with the Muslims being forced to convert to Catholicism by the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. They were known as [[Morisco]]s and considered [[New Christian]]s. Further laws were introduced, as on 25 May 1566, stipulating that they 'had to abandon the use of Arabic, change their costumes, that their doors must remain open every Friday, and other feast days, and that their baths, public and private, to be torn down.'&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigo de Zayas: Les Morisques'; p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; The reason doors were to be left open so as to determine whether they secretly observed any Islamic festivals.&lt;ref&gt;T.B. Irving: Dates, Names and Places; p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Philip II of Spain]] ordered the destruction of all public baths on the grounds of them being relics of infidelity, notorious for their use by Muslims performing their purification rites.&lt;ref&gt;S. Lane Poole: The Moors; pp. 135–36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marmol Carvajal: Rebellion; pp. 161–62&lt;/ref&gt; The possession of books or papers in Arabic was near concrete proof of disobedience with severe repercussions.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. Lea: The Moriscos of Spain; p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 January 1568, Christian priests were ordered to take all Morisco children between the ages of three and fifteen, and place them in schools, where they should learn Castillian and Christian doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;H. C. Lea: A History of the Inquisition; vol 3; p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; All these laws and measures required force to be implemented, and from much earlier.

Between 1609 and 1614 the Moriscos were expelled from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;L.P. Harvey. ''Muslims in Spain, 1500 to 1614''.

===Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===

{{See also|Lipka Rebellion}}
The [[Lipka Tatars]], also known as Polish Tatars or Lithuanian Tatars, were a community of Tatar Muslims who migrated into the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and became [[Polonization|Polonized]].

The [[Counter-Reformation]] of the [[Catholic Church]] in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] led to persecution of Muslims, [[Jews in Poland|Jews]], and [[Orthodox Christians]]. The ways the Muslims were persecuted included banning the repair of old mosques and preventing new ones from being constructed, banning [[serfdom]] of Christians under Muslims, banning marriage of Christian females to Muslims, putting limitations on property ownership among Tatars and the [[Polish–Ottoman Wars]] fed into the discriminatory atmosphere against them and led to anti-Islamic writings and attacks.&lt;ref name="Akiner2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shirin Akiner|title=Religious Language of a Belarusian Tatar Kitab: A Cultural Monument of Islam in Europe : with a Latin-script Transliteration of the British Library Tatar Belarusian Kitab (OR 13020) on CD-ROM|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FEJ7F2cmCt0C&amp;pg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2009|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3447030274|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sikhs and Sikh Empire===

Following the [[Sikh]] occupation of [[Samana, Punjab|Samana]] in 1709, the Sikh army participated in a massacre of the city's residents. 10,000 unarmed Muslim men and women were slain.&lt;ref name="sikhpillage"/&gt; Following the [[Siege of Sirhind]], [[Banda Singh Bahadur]] ordered that all men, women and children be executed.&lt;ref name="sikhpillage"&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/?id=t9IBAAAAMAAJ|title=History of the Panjab: From the Remotest Antiquity to Present Time|author=Syad Muhammad Latif|pages=111–21|year=1964|origyear=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.34649/page/n1 first published 1891]}}&lt;/ref&gt; All residents of [[Sirhind]], whether they were men, women or children were all burned alive or slain.&lt;ref name="sikhpillage"/&gt; In December 1757, Sikhs pillaged the Doab and the city of [[Jullunder]].&lt;ref name="sikhpillage"/&gt; During this pillaging, "Children were put to the sword, women were dragged out and forcibly converted to [[Sikhism]]" and Mosques were defiled by pigs blood.&lt;ref name="sikhpillage"/&gt; The body of Nassir Ali was dug out by Sikhs and flesh was thrust into it.&lt;ref name="sikhpillage"/&gt;

Diwan Chand became the first Hindu Governor of Kashmir after 1354 and enacted dozens of anti-Muslim laws. He raised the tax on Muslims, demolished the Jama Masjid of Srinagar and prohibited cow slaughter. The punishment for cow slaughter was the death penalty without any exception. He abducted all the [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] and [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] women and infamously sold them at Hira Mandi, a very popular market in Lahore (the Sikh Empire Capital).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DqAHweWRUs0C&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=diwan+chand+kashmir#v=onepage&amp;q=diwan%20chand%20kashmir&amp;f=false|title=The Valley of Kashmir|publisher=|isbn=978-8120616301|author1=Lawrence|first1=Sir Walter Roper|year=1895|pp=198–}}{{primary-source-inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Zutshi |first=Chitralekha |title=Languages of Belonging: Islam, Regional Identity, and the Making of Kashmir |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=dlBjzE-1ML8C&amp;pg=PA39 |publisher=C.

In retaliation for the [[Armenian Genocide|Armenian]] and [[Greek Genocide]]s, many Muslims (Turkish and Kurdish) were killed by [[Russians]] and [[Armenians]] in eastern provinces in Ottoman Empire (including Bayburt, Bitlis, Erzincan, Erzurum, Kars and Muş).&lt;ref&gt;T.

On 14 May 1919, the Greek army landed in [[Izmir]] ([[Smyrna]]), which marked the beginning of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)]]. During the war, the Greek side committed a number of atrocities in western provinces (such as Izmir, Manisa and Uşak),&lt;ref name="U.S. Vice-Consul James Loder Park 1923"&gt;U.S. Vice-Consul James Loder Park ''to Secretary of State, [[Smyrna]], 11 April 1923.''

As the [[Ottoman Empire]] entered a permanent phase of decline in the late 17th century it was engaged in a protracted state of conflict, losing territories both in [[Europ]]e and the [[Caucasus]]. The victors were the Christian States, the old [[Habsburg]] and [[Romanov]] Empires and the new nation-states of Greece, Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Michael ''The dark side of democracy: explaining ethnic cleansing'' Cambridge University Press 2005, pp. 112–13&lt;/ref&gt; Rival European powers encouraged the development of nationalist ideologies among the Ottoman subjects in which the Muslims were portrayed as an ethnic "fifth column" left over from a previous era that could not be integrated into the planned future states. The struggle to rid themselves of Ottomans became an important element of the self-identification of the Balkan Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Carmichael, Cathie (2002), ''Ethnic cleansing in the Balkans'', Routledge, pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mark Levene, the Victorian public in the 1870s paid much more attention to the massacres and expulsions of Christians than to massacres and expulsions of Muslims, even if on a greater scale. He further suggests that such massacres were even favored by some circles. Mark Levene also argues that the dominant powers, by supporting "nation-statism" at the [[Congress of Berlin]], legitimized "the primary instrument of Balkan nation-building": [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref&gt;Levene, Mark (2005), "Genocide in the Age of the Nation State" pp. 225–26&lt;/ref&gt; Hall points out that atrocities were committed by all sides during the Balkan conflicts. Deliberate terror was designed to instigate population movements out of particular territories. The aim of targeting the civilian population was to carve ethnically homogeneous countries.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Richard C. (2002), ''The Balkan Wars, 1912–1913: prelude to the First World War'', Routledge, pp. 136–37&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792)|Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792]] the [[Military history of Imperial Russia|Russian Army]] commander [[Alexander Suvorov]] successfully besieged the fortress of Izmail on 22 December 1790. Ottoman forces inside the fortress had the orders to stand their ground to the end, haughtily declining the Russian ultimatum. [[Alexander Suvorov]] announced the capture of Ismail in 1791 to the [[Catherine the Great|Tsaritsa Catherine]] in a doggerel couplet, after the assault had been pressed from house to house, room to room, and nearly every Muslim man, woman, and child in the city had been killed in three days of uncontrolled massacre, 40,000 Turks dead, a few hundred taken into captivity. For all his bluffness, Suvorov later told an English traveller that when the massacre was over he went back to his tent and wept.&lt;ref name="J. Goodwin, p. 244"&gt;J.

Muslim Albanians, along smaller numbers of urban Turks (some with Albanian heritage), were expelled by the [[Armed forces of the Principality of Serbia|Serb army]] from most parts of the [[Sanjak of Niš|Sanjak of Niş]] and fled to the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] during and after the [[Serbian–Ottoman War (1876–78)]].&lt;ref name=Jagodic1998&gt;{{cite book|last=Jagodić|first=Miloš|title=The Emigration of Muslims from the New Serbian Regions 1877/1878|year=1998|publisher=Balkanologie|url=http://balkanologie.revues.org/265}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 60–70,000 to as low as 30,000&lt;ref&gt;Pllana, Emin (1985).

Driving out the Albanians from the annexed territory, now called "New Serbia," was a result of collaboration between regular troops and guerrilla forces, and it was done in a manner which can be characterized as ethnic cleansing, since the victims were not only the combatants, but also virtually any civilian regardless of their attitude towards the Serbians (Müller 2005b). The majority of the refugees settled in neighboring Kosovo where they shed their bitter feelings on the local Serbs and ousted some of them from merchant positions, thereby enlarging the area of Serbian–Albanian conflict and intensifying it."&lt;/ref&gt;

Justin McCarty estimates that between 1821 and 1922 around five and a half million Muslims were driven out of Europe and five million more were killed or died of disease and starvation while fleeing.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Justin (1995), ''Death and Exile: The Ethnic Cleansing of Ottoman Muslims, 1821–1922'', Princeton: Darwin Press, pp. 335–40&lt;/ref&gt; Cleansing occurred as a result of the Serbian and Greek independence in the 1820s and 1830s, the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] 1877–1878, and culminating in the [[Balkan Wars]] 1912–1913. Mann describes these acts as "murderous ethnic cleansing on stupendous scale not previously seen in Europe" referring to the 1914 [[Carnegie Endowment]] report.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Michael (2005), ''The dark side of democracy: explaining ethnic cleansing'', Cambridge University Press, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Report of the International Commission to Inquire into the Causes and Conduct of the Balkan Wars (Washington, DC: The Endowment, 1914)&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that at the turn of the 20th century there were 4,4 million Muslims living in the Balkan zone of Ottoman control.&lt;ref name="Cornis-Pope, Marcel Neubauer pp.21"&gt;Cornis-Pope, Marcel &amp; Neubauer, John (2004), ''History of the literary cultures of East-Central Europe'' p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; More than one million Muslims left the Balkans in the last three decades of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Todorova, Maria (2009), ''Imagining the Balkans'', Oxford University Press, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1912 and 1926 nearly 2.9 million Muslims were either killed or forced to emigrate to Turkey.&lt;ref name="Cornis-Pope, Marcel Neubauer pp.21" /&gt;

The Dungan revolt erupted due to infighting between different Muslim Sufi sects, the Khafiya and the Jahariyya, and the [[Gedimu]]. When the rebellion failed, mass-immigration of the [[Dungan people]] into [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]] ensued. Before the war, the population of Shaanxi province totalled approximately 13 million inhabitants, at least 1,750,000 of whom were Dungan (Hui). After the war, the population dropped to 7 million; at least 150,000 fled. But once-flourishing Chinese Muslim communities fell 93% in the revolt in Shaanxi province. Between 1648 and 1878, around twelve million [[Hui people|Hui]] and Han Chinese were killed in ten unsuccessful uprisings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yugong.fudan.edu.cn/Article/Info_View.asp?ArticleID=72 |accessdate=7 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222062408/http://yugong.fudan.edu.cn/Article/Info_View.asp?ArticleID=72 |archivedate=22 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yugong.fudan.edu.cn/Article/Info_View.asp?ArticleID=73 |accessdate=7 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101222355/http://yugong.fudan.edu.cn/Article/Info_View.asp?ArticleID=73 |archivedate=1 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various sources criticize the claims that the Dungan and Panthay Revolts were due to religious persecution by the Qing.

The Dungan and Panthay Revolts by the Hui occurred because of racial antagonism and [[Class Warfare|class warfare]], not purely religious strife as is sometimes mistakenly assumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eEwTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA894&amp;dq=The+most+notable+and+most+serious+of+such+outbreaks+have+been+those+of+the+north+(Kan-su+and+Shen-si)+in+1861-74,+and+of+the+south+(Yiin-nan)+in+1858-72.+It+would+be+a+mistake,+however,+to+attribute+these+ruinous+insurrections+to+religious+motives+alone,+for+racial+antagonisms+and+the+conflicting+interests+of+different+social+classes+were+certainly+no+less+potent+factors.#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20most%20notable%20and%20most%20serious%20of%20such%20outbreaks%20have%20been%20those%20of%20the%20north%20(Kan-su%20and%20Shen-si)%20in%201861-74%2C%20and%20of%20the%20south%20(Yiin-nan)%20in%201858-72.%20It%20would%20be%20a%20mistake%2C%20however%2C%20to%20attribute%20these%20ruinous%20insurrections%20to%20religious%20motives%20alone%2C%20for%20racial%20antagonisms%20and%20the%20conflicting%20interests%20of%20different%20social%20classes%20were%20certainly%20no%20less%20potent%20factors.&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopædia of religion and ethics|volume= 8|author1=James Hastings |author2=John Alexander Selbie |author3=Louis Herbert Gray |year=1916|publisher=T. &amp; T.

The [[Panthay rebellion]] was not religious in nature, since the Muslims were joined by non-Muslim Shan and Kakhyen and other hill tribes in the revolt.&lt;ref name="fytche_300"&gt;{{harvnb|Fytche|1878|p=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; A British officer testified that the Muslims did not rebel for religious reasons, and that the Chinese were tolerant of different religions and were unlikely to have caused the revolt by interfering with the practicing of Islam.&lt;ref name="fytche_301"&gt;{{harvnb|Fytche|1878|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, loyalist Muslim forces helped the Qing crush the rebel Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5LSvkQvvmAMC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=arab+mercenaries+china&amp;q=arab+mercenaries+china#v=onepage&amp;q=yunnan%20rebellion%20loyalist&amp;f=false|title=The religious traditions of Asia: religion, history, and culture|author=Joseph Mitsuo Kitagawa|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|page=283|isbn=0700717625|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Du Wenxiu was not aiming his rebellion at Han, but was anti-Qing and wanted to destroy the Manchu government. During the revolt Hui from provinces which were not in rebellion, like Sichuan and Zhejiang, served as negotiators between rebel Hui and the Qing government. One of Du Wenxiu's banners said "Deprive the Manchu Qing of their Mandate to Rule" ({{lang|zh|革命滿清}}), and he called on Han to assist Hui to overthrow the Manchu regime and drive them out of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BwuSpFiOFfYC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=du+wenxiu+han#v=onepage&amp;q=du%20wenxiu%20han&amp;f=false|title=China's Muslim Hui community: migration, settlement and sects|author=Michael Dillon|year=1999|publisher=Curzon Press|location=Richmond|page=59|isbn=0700710264|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Da2M_viEclEC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=du+wenxiu+anti+han#v=onepage&amp;q=du%20wenxiu%20anti%20han&amp;f=false|title=The Chinese sultanate: Islam, ethnicity, and the Panthay Rebellion in southwest China, 1856–1873|author=David G.

Muslims in other parts of [[China proper]] such as the east and southern provinces who did not revolt were not affected at all by the rebellion, and experienced no genocide, nor did they seek to revolt. It was reported that Muslim villages in Henan province, which was next to Shaanxi, were totally unaffected by the Dungan revolt and relations between Han and Hui continued normally. Muslims from eastern China like [[Ma Xinyi]] continued to serve in the Chinese government during the revolt, and ignored the Muslims of northwest China.
[[File:Uyghur protest Berlin, July 2009 3.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Street demonstration with banners, passing an official building|Demonstration in Berlin for Uyghur human rights.]]

The Hui Muslims in [[Xi'an]] city in Shaanxi province were completely spared from reprisals by General Zuo Zongtang and allowed to stay in Xi'an after the war since they never joined the Hui rebels in the rural areas of Shaanxi, despite the fact that Shaanxi was the epicenter of the Dungan rebellion. The Muslim quarter still exists in Xi'an to this day with the Hui people living inside it.

The Muslims of [[Xining]] were also spared by Zuo after his forces captured the city from the rebels. Zuo differentiated between rebels and "good Muslims", seeking arrangements to resettle Muslim refugees in new areas to avoid future conflict. Zuo Zongtang resettled Hui refugees from Shaanxi in southern Gansu province after defeating the rebels in Xining and Suzhou. Zuo offered amnesty to Gedimu Sunni and Khufiyya Sufi rebels who surrendered.

Elisabeth Allès wrote that the relationship between Hui Muslim and Han peoples continued normally in the [[Henan]] area, with no ramifications or consequences from the Muslim rebellions of other areas. Allès wrote in the document "Notes on some joking relationships between Hui and Han villages in Henan" published by French Centre for Research on Contemporary China that "The major Muslim revolts in the middle of the nineteenth century which involved the Hui in Shaanxi, Gansu and Yunnan, as well as the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, do not seem to have had any direct effect on this region of the central plain."&lt;ref name="Allès"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chinaperspectives.revues.org/document649.html|title=Notes on some joking relationships between Hui and Han villages in Henan|last=Allès|first=Elizabeth|publisher=French Centre for Research on Contemporary China|page=6|date=&lt;!-- September–October 2003, Online since 17 January 2007 --&gt;|accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hui people|Hui]] Muslim population of Beijing was unaffected by the Muslim rebels during the Dungan revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hong Kong images: people and animals|author=Hugh D.R.

[[Gedimu]] [[Hanafi]] Sunni Muslims tried to distance themselves from the [[Jahriyya]] [[Sufi]] rebels. Some of them even helped the Qing dynasty crush the Sufi rebels.&lt;ref name="Masumi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science-islam.net/article.php3?id_article=676&amp;lang=fr|title=The completion of the idea of dual loyalty towards China and Islam|last=Masumi|first=Matsumoto|publisher=|accessdate=2010-06-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724054724/http://science-islam.net/article.php3?id_article=676&amp;lang=fr|archivedate=24 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebels were disorganized and without a common purpose. Some Han Chinese rebelled against the Qing state during the rebellion, and rebel bands fought each other. The main Hui rebel leader, Ma Hualong, was even granted a military rank and title during the rebellion by the Qing dynasty. It was only later when Zuo Zongtang launched his campaign to pacify the region, did he decide which rebels who surrendered were going to be executed, or spared.&lt;ref name="Garnaut"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ouigour.fr/recherches_et_analyses/Garnautpage_93.pdf |title=From Yunnan to Xinjiang:Governor Yang Zengxin and his Dungan Generals |last=Garnaut |first=Anthony |publisher=Pacific and Asian History, Australian National University |accessdate=2010-07-14 |page=98 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309054654/http://www.ouigour.fr/recherches_et_analyses/Garnautpage_93.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zuo Zongtang generally massacred New Teaching Jahriyya rebels, even if they surrendered, but spared Old Teaching Khafiya and Sunni Gedimu rebels. Ma Hualong belonged to the New Teaching school of thought, and Zuo executed him, while Hui generals belonging to the Old Teaching clique such as Ma Qianling, Ma Zhan'ao and Ma Anliang were granted amnesty and even promoted in the Qing military. Moreover, an army of Han Chinese rebels led by [[Dong Fuxiang]] surrendered and joined Zuo Zongtang.&lt;ref name="Garnaut"/&gt;
General Zuo accepted the surrender of Hui people belonging to the Old Teaching school, provided they surrendered large amounts of military equipment and supplies, and accepted relocation. He refused to accept the surrender of New Teaching Muslims who still believed in its tenets, since the Qing classified them as a dangerous heterodox cult, similar to the [[White Lotus]] Buddhists. Zuo said, "The only distinction is between the innocent and rebellious, there is none between Han and Hui".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pEfWaxPhdnIC&amp;pg=PA228|title=Late Ch'ing, 1800–1911|author1=John King Fairbank |author2=Kwang-ching Liu |author3=Denis Crispin Twitchett |year=1980|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|isbn=0521220297|page=228|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qing authorities decreed that the Hui rebels who had taken part in violent attacks were merely heretics and not representative of the entire Hui population, just as the heretical White Lotus did not represent all Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ju8MAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=eunuch+slaves+turkestan&amp;q=moslem#v=onepage&amp;q=moslem%20heretical%20sect%20white%20lotus%20buddhist%20clergy%20population%20nothing&amp;f=false|title=Verhandelingen der Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen, Afd.

The new were heretics and deviated from Islam in the same way that the White Lotus deviated from Buddhism and Daoism, and stated its intention to inform the Hui community that it was aware that the original Islamic religion was one united sect before the advent of new "heretics", saying they would separate Muslim rebels by which sect they belonged to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oL5ZAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20whole%20moslem%20population%20may%20get%20convinced&amp;f=false|title=Sectarianism and religious persecution in China: a page in the history of religions, Volume 2|author=Jan Jakob Maria Groot|year=1904|publisher=J.

Zuo also stated that he would accept the surrender of New Teaching Muslims who admitted that they were deceived, radicalized, and misled by its doctrines. Zuo excluded khalifas and mullas from the surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pEfWaxPhdnIC&amp;dq=ma+hua-lung+ch%27ing+loyalist&amp;q=pardon+new+teaching+khalifas+mullas#v=snippet&amp;q=pardon%20new%20teaching%20khalifas%20mullas&amp;f=false|title=Late Ch'ing, 1800–1911|author1=John King Fairbank |author2=Kwang-ching Liu |author3=Denis Crispin Twitchett |year=1980|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|isbn=0521220297|page=233|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted in the previously, Zuo relocated Han Chinese from Hezhou as a reward for the Hui leader Ma Zhan'ao after he and his followers surrendered and joined the Qing to crush the rebels. Zuo also moved Shaanxi Muslim refugees from Hezhou, only allowing native Gansu Muslims to stay behind.

The Qing dynasty did not persecute Muslims systematically, it only massacred rebels regardless of their religion, when the Muslim General [[Ma Rulong (general)|Ma Rulong]] defected to the Qing Dynasty, he became the most powerful military official in [[Yunnan]] province.&lt;ref name="Garnaut"/&gt;

The Qing armies only massacred the Muslims who had rebelled, and spared Muslims who took no part in the uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hUEswLE4SWUC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=ma+anliang+disown#v=snippet&amp;q=hui%20communities%20spared%20risings&amp;f=false|title=China's Muslim Hui community: migration, settlement and sects|author=Michael Dillon|year=1999|publisher=Curzon Press|location=Richmond|page=77|isbn=0700710264|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hui people|Hui Muslims]] and [[Uyghur people|Uyghur Muslims]] massacred each other in the [[Battle of Kashgar (1933)]], [[Kizil massacre]], [[Battle of Kashgar (1934)]], [[Battle of Yarkand]], [[Battle of Yangi Hissar]], [[Charkhlik Revolt]], during the [[Kumul Rebellion]]. More massacres occurred during the [[Ili Rebellion]].

Tensions between Hui and Uyghurs arose because Hui troops and officials often dominated the Uyghurs and crush Uyghur revolts.{{sfn|Starr|2004|p=311}} Xinjiang's Hui population increased by over 520 percent between 1940 and 1982, an average annual growth of 4.4 percent, while the Uyghur population only grew at 1.7 percent. This dramatic increase in Hui population led inevitably to significant tensions between the Hui and Uyghur populations. Some Uyghurs in [[Kashgar]] remember that the Hui army at the [[Battle of Kashgar (1934)]] massacred 2,000 to 8,000 Uyghurs, which causes tension as more Hui moved into Kashgar from other parts of China.{{sfn|Starr|2004|p=113}} Some Hui criticize Uyghur separatism and generally do not want to get involved in conflict in other countries.&lt;ref name="Van Wie Davis"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apcss.org/Publications/APCSS--%20Uyghur%20Muslim%20Separatism%20in%20Xinjiang.doc |title=Uyghur Muslim Ethnic Separatism in Xinjiang, China |last=Van Wie Davis |first=Elizabath |publisher=Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies |accessdate=2010-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617011421/http://apcss.org/Publications/APCSS--%20Uyghur%20Muslim%20Separatism%20in%20Xinjiang.doc |archivedate=17 June 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hui and Uyghur live separately, attending different mosques.&lt;ref name="Safran 1998 35"&gt;{{cite book| first = William |last=Safran| title = Nationalism and ethnoregional identities in China| url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=MT0VFdKklYoC |p=35}}| accessdate = 2011-01-11| year = 1998| publisher = Psychology Press| isbn = 071464921X| page = 35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cultural Revolution]], mosques along with other religious buildings were often defaced, destroyed or closed and copies of the [[Quran]] were destroyed and cemeteries by the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldman|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} During that time, the government also constantly accused Muslims and other religious groups of holding "superstitious beliefs" and promoting "[[anti-socialist]] trends".&lt;ref&gt;Israeli (2002), p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; The government began to relax its policies towards Muslims in 1978, and supported worship and rituals.

However, restrictions have been applied to Uyghur Islamic practices because the Chinese government has attempted since 2001 to link Islamic beliefs with terrorist activities. Numerous events have led the government to crack down on most displays of Islamic piety among Uyghurs, including the wearing of veils and long beards. The [[Ghulja Incident]] and [[July 2009 Ürümqi riots]] have both resulted from abusive treatment of Uyghur Muslims within Chinese society, and resulted in ever more extreme government crackdowns. While Hui Muslims are seen as relatively docile, Uyghurs are stereotyped as Islamists and punished more strictly for crimes. In 1989 China banned a book titled "Xing Fengsu" ("Sexual Customs") which insulted Islam and placed its authors under arrest after protests in Lanzhou and Beijing by Uyghurs and [[Hui people|Hui]] Muslims.&lt;ref name="Beijing Review, Volume 32 1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gladney 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schein 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gladney 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bulag 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gladney 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gladney 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sautman 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gladney 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lipman 1996"/&gt; Hui Muslims who vandalized property during the protests against the book went unpunished while Uyghur protestors were imprisoned.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

In August 2018, the [[United Nations]] said that credible reports had led it to estimate that up to a million Uighurs and other Muslims were being held in "something that resembles a massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy". The U.N.'s
[[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] said that some estimates indicated that up to 2 million Uighurs and other Muslims were held in "political camps for indoctrination", in a "no-rights zone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rights-un/u-n-says-it-has-credible-reports-that-china-holds-million-uighurs-in-secret-camps-idUSKBN1KV1SU |title=U.N. says it has credible reports that China holds million Uighurs in secret camps |date=10 August 2018 |last=Nebehay |first=Stephanie |work=Reuters |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By that time, conditions in Xinjiang had deteriorated so far that they were described by informed political scientists as "Orwellian"&lt;ref name=HKFP-AFP /&gt; and observers drew comparisons with Nazi concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/08/22/chinas-mass-internment-camps-have-no-clear-end-in-sight/?utm_source=PostUp&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Editors%20Picks%20%208/22/2018%20-%20Brand%20South%20Africa&amp;utm_keyword=Editor&amp;#39;s%20Picks%20OC|title=China's Mass Internment Camps Have No Clear End in Sight|website=Foreign Policy|date=22 August 2018|last=Thum|first=Rian|access-date=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the UN panel's finding of indefinite detention without due process, the Chinese government delegation officially conceded that it was engaging in widespread "resettlement and re-education" and State media described the controls in Xinjiang as "intense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/13/china-state-media-defend-intense-controls-xinjiang-uighurs|title=China denies violating minority rights amid detention claims|date=13 August 2018|last=Kuo|first=Lily|access-date=14 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180814004315/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/13/china-state-media-defend-intense-controls-xinjiang-uighurs#|archive-date=2018-08-14|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 31 August 2018, the United Nations committee called on the Chinese government to "end the practice of detention without lawful charge, trial and conviction", to release the detained persons, to provide specifics as to the number of interred individuals and the reasons for their detention, and to investigate the allegations of "racial, ethnic and ethno-religious profiling". A [[BBC]] report quoted an unnamed Chinese official as saying that "Uighurs enjoyed full rights" but also admitting that "those deceived by religious extremism... shall be assisted by resettlement and re-education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-45364689 |title=UN 'alarmed' by reports of China's mass detention of Uighurs |date=31 August 2018 |work=BBC News Asia |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:L’armée Française terrorise la population Algérienne.jpg|thumb|The French military in Algeria]]
Some governments and scholars have called the [[French conquest of Algeria]] a genocide. [[Ben Kiernan]], an Australian expert on the [[Cambodian genocide]], wrote in ''[[Blood and Soil (book)|Blood and Soil: A World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur]]'' on the French conquest of Algeria:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiernan|first1=Ben|title=Blood and Soil: A World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur|page=374|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XR91bs70jukC&amp;q=374#v=snippet&amp;q=374&amp;f=false|isbn=0300100981|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;By 1875, the French conquest was complete. The war had killed approximately 825,000 indigenous Algerians since 1830. A long shadow of genocidal hatred persisted, provoking a French author to protest in 1882 that in Algeria, "we hear it repeated every day that we must expel the native and if necessary destroy him." As a French statistical journal urged five years later, "the system of extermination must give way to a policy of penetration."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

French Algeria became the prototype for a pattern of French colonial rule which has been described as "quasi-[[apartheid]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Algeria ... was a society of nine million or so 'Muslim' Algerians who were dominated by the million settlers of diverse origins (but fiercely French) who maintained a quasi-apartheid regime." David Scott Bell. ''Presidential Power in Fifth Republic France'', Berg Publishers, 2000, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Napoleon III]] oversaw an 1865 decree that allowed Arab and [[Berber people|Berber]] Algerians to request French citizenship—but only if they "renounced their Muslim religion and culture":&lt;ref&gt;Debra Kelly.

During the [[Second Sino-Japanese war]] the Japanese followed what has been referred to as a "killing policy" and destroyed many mosques. According to Wan Lei, "Statistics showed that the Japanese destroyed 220 mosques and killed countless Hui people by April 1941." After the [[Rape of Nanking]] mosques in Nanjing were found to be filled with dead bodies. They also followed a policy of economic oppression which involved the destruction of mosques and Hui communities and made many Hui jobless and homeless. Another policy was one of deliberate humiliation. This included soldiers smearing mosques with pork fat, forcing Hui to butcher pigs to feed the soldiers, and forcing girls to supposedly train as geishas and singers but in fact made them serve as sex slaves. Hui cemeteries were destroyed for military reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=LEI |first=Wan |date= (2010/2) |title=The Chinese Islamic "Goodwill Mission to the Middle East" During the Anti-Japanese War |url=https://www.academia.edu/4427135/The_Chinese_Islamic_Goodwill_Mission_to_the_Middle_East_-_Japonyaya_Karsi_Savasta_Cinli_Muslumanlarin_Orta_Dogu_iyi_Niyet_Heyeti_-_Wan_LEI |publisher= |journal=Dîvân Disiplinlerarasi Çalismalar Dergisi |volume= cilt 15 |issue= sayi 29 |page=|pages=139–41 |doi= |accessdate=2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Hui [[Chinese Muslims in the Second Sino-Japanese war|fought in the war against Japan]].

===Myanmar===
{{Main|Persecution of Muslims in Myanmar|Rohingya people}}
[[Myanmar]] has a Buddhist majority. The Muslim minority in Myanmar mostly consists of the [[Rohingya people]] and the descendants of Muslim immigrants from India (including what is now Bangladesh) and China (the ancestors of [[Islam in China|Chinese Muslims]] in Myanmar came from [[Yunnan]] province), as well as descendants of earlier Arab and [[Persian people|Persian]] settlers. [[Islam in India|Indian Muslims]] were brought to Burma by the British to aid them in clerical work and business. After independence, many Muslims retained their previous positions and achieved prominence in business and politics.

First Buddhist persecution of Muslims arose from religious reasons, and occurred during the reign of King [[Bayinnaung]], 1550–1589 AD. {{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} After conquering [[Bago, Burma|Bago]] in 1559, the Buddhist King prohibited the practice of [[halal]], specifically, killing food animals in the name of Allah. He was religiously intolerant, forcing some of his subjects to listen to Buddhist sermons possibly converting by force.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} He also disallowed the [[Eid al-Adha]], religious sacrifice of cattle, regarding killing animals in the name of religion as a cruel custom. Halal food was also forbidden by King Alaungpaya in the 18th century.

When General [[Ne Win]] swept to power on a wave of nationalism in 1962, the status of Muslims changed for the worse. Muslims were expelled from the army and were rapidly marginalized.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/aviewer.asp?a=5380&amp;z=102 |title=The Outsiders |authors=Harry Priestley/Rangoon |date=January 2006 |website=irrawaddy.org |publisher=The Irrawaddy |access-date=6 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127183834/http://www.irrawaddy.org/aviewer.asp?a=5380&amp;z=102 |archivedate=27 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Rohingya Muslims fled Burma and many refugees inundated neighbouring Bangladesh including 200,000 in 1978 as a result of the [[King Dragon operation in Arakan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=45850 |title=Burma's Muslim Rohingyas&amp;nbsp;– The New Boat People.

The Philippines is predominantly a Christian society with a complicated history of relations between Islam and Christianity. Despite historic evidence of [[Islam in the Philippines|Islamization]] spreading throughout the islands in the 13th–16th centuries, the archipelago [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|came under Spanish rule]] in the 16th century. The Spanish proselytized many natives, and labelled those who remained Muslims as ''Moro'', a derogatory term recalling the [[Moors]], an Islamic people of [[North Africa]] who occupied parts of Spain for several centuries. Today, this term ''Moro'' is used to refer to the indigenous Muslim tribes and ethnic groups of the country. When the Spanish came to the Philippine islands, most of the natives in Luzon and Visayas were pagans with Muslim minorities, and while Spanish proselytized many natives, many Muslims in Luzon and Visayas were not exempted by the Spaniards from the [[Spanish Inquisition]], wherein Muslims to become Catholics or die for their faith. Those who remained Muslims are only the natives of [[Mindanao]] and [[Sulu]] which the Spaniards did not invade or had control of only briefly and partially.

The [[Spanish–Moro Wars]] between Spanish colonial authorities and the indigenous Sultanates of the [[Moro people]]s, (the [[Sultanate of Sulu]], [[Confederation of sultanates in Lanao]] and [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]]) further escalated tensions between the Christian and Muslim groups of the country. The Moros fought in the [[Moro Rebellion]] against the Americans during which Americans massacred Moro women and children at the [[Moro Crater massacre]], [[Moros during World War II|against the Japanese in World War II]], and are [[Moro insurgency in the Philippines|waging an insurgency against the Philippines]]. The pro-Philippine government [[Ilaga]] militia, composed of Catholic and other Christian settlers on Moro land in Mindanao, were known for their atrocities and massacres against Moro civilians and their bloodiest attack happened in June 1971 when they slaughtered 65 Moro civilians at a Mosque during the [[Manili massacre]]. On 24 September 1974, in the [[Malisbong massacre]] the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] slaughtered about 1,500 Moro Muslim civilians who were praying at a Mosque in addition to [[Wartime sexual violence#Philippines|mass raping]] Moro girls who had been taken aboard a boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindanews.com/top-stories/2014/09/26/1500-moro-massacre-victims-during-martial-law-honored/|title=1,500 Moro massacre victims during Martial Law honored|work=MindaNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russian Empire====
[[File:Firinat xalikov war.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Qolsharif]] and his students defend their mosque during the [[Siege of Kazan]].]]
{{Further|Circassian genocide|Caucasian War}}
The period from the [[Russo-Kazan Wars|conquest of Kazan]] in 1552 to the ascension of [[Catherine the Great]] in 1762, was marked by systematic repression of Muslims through policies of exclusion and discrimination as well as the destruction of Muslim culture by elimination of outward manifestations of Islam such as mosques. The Russians initially demonstrated a willingness in allowing Islam to flourish as Muslim clerics were invited into the various region to preach to the Muslims, particularly the [[Kazakhs]] whom the Russians viewed as "savages" and "ignorant" of morals and ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Khodarkovsky, Michael. ''Russia's Steppe Frontier: The Making of a Colonial Empire, 1500–1800'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EncycSex572&gt;Ember, Carol R. and Melvin Ember. ''Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender: Men and Women in the World's Cultures'', p. 572&lt;/ref&gt; However, Russian policy shifted toward weakening Islam by introducing pre-Islamic elements of collective consciousness.&lt;ref name=Hunter14&gt;Hunter, Shireen. "Islam in Russia: The Politics of Identity and Security", p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Such attempts included methods of eulogizing pre-Islamic historical figures and imposing a sense of inferiority by sending Kazakhs to highly elite Russian military institutions.&lt;ref name=Hunter14 /&gt; In response, Kazakh religious leaders attempted to bring religious fervor by espousing [[pan-Turkism]], though many were persecuted as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Farah, Caesar E. ''Islam: Beliefs and Observances'', p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;

While total expulsion as in other Christian nations such as Spain, Portugal and Sicily was not feasible to achieve a homogenous [[Russian Orthodox]] population, other policies such as land grants and the promotion of migration by other Russian and non-Muslim populations into Muslim lands displaced many Muslims making them minorities in places such as some parts of the South Ural region to other parts such as the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkey]], and almost annihilating the [[Circassians]], [[Crimean Tatars]], and various [[Peoples of the Caucasus in Turkey|Muslims of the Caucasus]]. The Russian army rounded up people, driving Muslims from their villages to ports on the Black Sea, where they awaited ships provided by the neighboring [[Ottoman Empire]]. The explicit Russian goal was to expel the groups in question from their lands.&lt;ref&gt;Kazemzadeh 1974&lt;/ref&gt; They were given a choice as to where to be resettled: in the Ottoman Empire or in Russia far from their old lands. Only a small percentage (the numbers are unknown) accepted resettlement within the [[Russian Empire]]. The trend of [[Russification]] has continued at different paces during the remaining Tsarist period and under the Soviet Union, so that today there are more Tatars living outside the [[Republic of Tatarstan]] than inside it.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Shireen Tahmasseb, Thomas, Jeffrey L. &amp; Melikishvili, Alexander (2004), ''Islam in Russia'', M.E.

[[Alexander Suvorov]] announced the capture of Ismail in 1791 to the [[Catherine the Great|Tsarina Catherine]] in a doggerel couplet, after the assault had been pressed from house to house, room to room, and nearly every Muslim man, woman, and child in the city had been killed in three days of uncontrolled massacre, 40,000 [[Turkish people|Turks]] dead, a few hundred taken into captivity. For all his bluffness, Suvorov later told an English traveller that when the massacre was over he went back to his tent and wept.&lt;ref name="J. Goodwin, p. 244"/&gt;

The Soviet Union was hostile to all forms of religion, which was "[[opium of the people|the opium of the masses]]" in accordance with [[Marxism|Marxist ideology]]. Relative religious freedom existed for Muslims in the years following the revolution, but in the late 1920s the Soviet government took a strong anti-religious turn.

From May to November, 10,105 Crimean Tatars died of starvation in Uzbekistan (7% of deported to Uzbek SSR). Nearly 30,000 (20%) died in exile during the year and a half by the NKVD data and nearly 46% by the data of the Crimean Tatar activists. According to Soviet dissident information, many Crimean Tatars were made to work in the large-scale projects conducted by the Soviet [[Gulag]] system of slave labor camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,823132,00.html|title=Russia: The Muzhik &amp; the Commissar|date=30 November 1953|publisher=|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Soviet–Afghan War====
{{main|Soviet–Afghan War}}
Soviet–Afghan War lasted over nine years, from December 1979 to February 1989. Insurgent groups known collectively as the mujahideen fought a guerrilla war against the Soviet Army.
The Soviets used their air power to deal harshly with both rebels and civilians, levelling villages to deny safe haven to the mujahideen, destroying vital irrigation ditches, and laying millions of land mines.
American professor Samuel Totten,[189] Australian professor Paul R. Bartrop,[189] scholars from Yale Law School such as W. Michael Reisman[190] and Charles Norchi,[191] as well as scholar Mohammed Kakar, believe that the Afghans were victims of genocide by the Soviet Union. The army of the Soviet Union killed large numbers of Afghans to suppress their resistance.[192] The Soviet forces and their proxies deliberately targeted civilians, particularly in rural areas. 
Up to 2 million Afghans lost their lives during the Soviet occupation.[35][36]
In one notable incident the Soviet Army committed mass killing of civilians in the summer of 1980.[194] In order to separate the mujahideen from the local populations and eliminate their support, the Soviet army killed and drove off civilians, and used scorched earth tactics to prevent their return. They used booby traps, mines, and chemical substances throughout the country.[194] The Soviet army indescriminately killed combatants and noncombatants to ensure submission by the local populations.[194] The provinces of Nangarhar, Ghazni, Lagham, Kunar, Zabul, Qandahar, Badakhshan, Lowgar, Paktia and Paktika witnessed extensive depopulation programmes by the Soviet forces.
The Soviet forces abducted Afghan women in helicopters while flying in the country in search of mujahideen. In November 1980 a number of such incidents had taken place in various parts of the country, including Laghman and Kama. Soviet soldiers as well as KhAD agents kidnapped young women from the city of Kabul and the areas of Darul Aman and Khair Khana, near the Soviet garrisons, to rape them.[195] Women who were taken and raped by Russian soldiers were considered 'dishonoured' by their families if they returned home.[196] Deserters from the Soviet Army in 1984 also confirmed the atrocities by the Soviet troops on Afghan women and children, stating that Afghan women were being raped.[197]
There have also been numerous reports of chemical weapons being used by Soviet forces in Afghanistan, often indiscriminately against civilians.[139][229][230] A declassified CIA report from 1982 states that between 1979 and 1982 there were 43 separate chemical weapons attacks which caused more than 3000 deaths.[231] By early 1980, attacks with chemical weapons were reported in "all areas with concentrated resistance activity".[231]
Civilian death and destruction from the war was considerable. Estimates of Afghan civilian deaths vary from 562,000[31] to 2,000,000.[32][33][35][36] 5–10 million Afghans fled to Pakistan and Iran, 1/3 of the prewar population of the country, and another 2 million were displaced within the country. In the 1980s, half of all refugees in the world were Afghan.[234]

====Bulgaria====
In 1989, 310,000 Turks left Bulgaria, many under pressure as a result of the communist [[Todor Zhivkov|Zhivkov]] regime's assimilation campaign (though up to a third returned before the end of the year). That program, which began in 1984, forced all Turks and other Muslims in Bulgaria to adopt [[Bulgarian name]]s and renounce all Muslim customs. The motivation of the 1984 assimilation campaign is unclear; however, some experts believe that the disproportion between the birth rates of the Turks and the Bulgarians was a major factor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Glenn E. Curtis, ed. Bulgaria: A Country Study. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; During the name-changing phase of the campaign, Turkish towns and villages were surrounded by army units. Citizens were issued new identity cards with Bulgarian names. Failure to present a new card meant forfeiture of salary, pension payments, and bank withdrawals. Birth or marriage certificates would only be issued in Bulgarian names. Traditional Turkish costumes were banned; homes were searched and all signs of Turkish identity were removed. Mosques were closed. According to estimates, 500 to 1,500 people were killed when they resisted assimilation measures, and thousands of others were imprisoned, sent to labor camps or forcibly resettled.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, [http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/bgtoc.html A Country Study: Bulgaria], Call Number DR55.B724 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

According to human rights organizations and western media [[Uyghurs]] face discrimination and religious persecution at the hands of the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|government]] authorities. In a 2013 news article, ''The New York Times'' reported, "Many Uighurs are also convinced that Beijing is seeking to wipe out their language and culture through assimilation and education policies that favor Mandarin over Uighur in schools and government jobs. Civil servants can be fired for joining Friday afternoon prayer services, and Uighur college students say they are often required to eat lunch in school cafeterias during the holy month of Ramadan, when observant Muslims fast."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/08/world/asia/uighurs-in-china-say-bias-is-growing.html | work=The New York Times | first=Andrew | last=Jacobs | title=Uighurs in China Say Bias Is Growing | date=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the suppression of the Uyghurs has more to do with the fact that they are separatist, rather than Muslim. China banned a book titled "Xing Fengsu" ("Sexual Customs") which insulted Islam and placed its authors under arrest in 1989 after protests in Lanzhou and Beijing by Chinese [[Hui people|Hui]] Muslims, during which the Chinese police provided protection to the Hui Muslim protestors, and the Chinese government organized public burnings of the book.&lt;ref name="Beijing Review, Volume 32 1989"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qBINAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=sexual+customs+banned+book+Islam&amp;dq=sexual+customs+banned+book+Islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vm7OVJDXOoKigwT9ioOgCw&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBg Beijing Review, Volume 32 1989], p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gladney 1991"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bcsmAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=sexual+customs+banned+book+Islam&amp;dq=sexual+customs+banned+book+Islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vm7OVJDXOoKigwT9ioOgCw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw Gladney 1991], p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schein 2000"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GomyOthrHjUC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=xing+fengsu+sexual&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bHDOVO75GMe7ggSL1oOwAg&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=xing%20fengsu%20sexual&amp;f=false Schein 2000], p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gladney 2004"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mzxSNM3_vCEC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=xing+fengsu+sexual&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bHDOVO75GMe7ggSL1oOwAg&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=xing%20fengsu%20sexual&amp;f=false Gladney 2004], p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bulag 2010"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sQLiMYUk-nIC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=xing+fengsu+sexual&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bHDOVO75GMe7ggSL1oOwAg&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=xing%20fengsu%20sexual&amp;f=false Bulag 2010], p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gladney 2005"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=icZJJN0wYPcC&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=xing+fengsu+sexual&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bHDOVO75GMe7ggSL1oOwAg&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=xing%20fengsu%20sexual&amp;f=false Gladney 2005], p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gladney 2013"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8WGOAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=xing+fengsu+sexual&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dHLOVPb1BOjCsASe0YDADg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=xing%20fengsu%20sexual&amp;f=false Gladney 2013], p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sautman 2000"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HH94dPJrkA4C&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=xing+fengsu+sexual&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dHLOVPb1BOjCsASe0YDADg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=xing%20fengsu%20sexual&amp;f=false Sautman 2000], p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gladney 1996"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_hJ9aht6nZQC&amp;pg=PA341&amp;dq=xing+fengsu+sexual&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dHLOVPb1BOjCsASe0YDADg&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=xing%20fengsu%20sexual&amp;f=false Gladney 1996], p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lipman 1996"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AvDOudr5M6MC&amp;pg=PA299&amp;dq=xing+fengsu+sexual&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dHLOVPb1BOjCsASe0YDADg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=xing%20fengsu%20sexual&amp;f=false Lipman 1996], p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese government assisted them and gave into their demands because Hui do not have a separatist movement, unlike the Uyghurs,&lt;ref name="Harold Miles Tanner 2009 581"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VIWC9wCX2c8C&amp;pg=PA581#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=China: a history|author=Harold Miles Tanner|year=2009|publisher=Hackett Publishing|location=|page=581|isbn=0872209156|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hui Muslim protestors who violently rioted by vandalizing property during the protests against the book were let off by the Chinese government and went unpunished while Uyghur protestors were imprisoned.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mzxSNM3_vCEC&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=sexual+customs+banned+book&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o23OVLLEGoaxggTAj4TwBw&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=sexual%20customs%20banned%20book&amp;f=false Gladney 2004], p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different Muslim ethnic groups in different regions are treated differently by the Chinese government in regards to religious freedom. Religious freedom is present for Hui Muslims, who can practice their religion, build Mosques, and have their children attend Mosques, while more controls are placed specifically on Uyghurs in Xinjiang.&lt;ref name="Senate U S Committee on Foreign Relations 2005 159–60"&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Report on International Religious Freedom, 2004|issue=|author=Senate (U S ) Committee on Foreign Relations|editor=State Dept (U S )|others=Compiled by State Dept (U S )|edition=illustrated|date=|year=2005|publisher=Government Printing Office|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04dlwzB2SvcC&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=159–60|isbn=0160725526|accessdate=24 April 2014| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although religious education for children is officially forbidden by law in China, the Communist party allows Hui Muslims to violate this law and have their children educated in religion and attend Mosques while the law is enforced on Uyghurs. After secondary education is completed, China then allows Hui students who are willing to embark on religious studies under an Imam.&lt;ref name="ALLÈS &amp; CHÉRIF-CHEBBI &amp; HALFON 2003"&gt;[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rss/31-1_007.pdf Alllès &amp; Chérif-Chebbi &amp; Halfon 2003], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; China does not enforce the law against children attending Mosques on non-Uyghurs in areas outside of Xinjiang.&lt;ref name="Senate U S Committee on Foreign Relations 2005 160"&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Report on International Religious Freedom, 2004|issue=|author=Senate (U S ) Committee on Foreign Relations|editor=State Dept (US )|others=Compiled by State Dept (U S )|edition=illustrated|date=|year=2005|publisher=Government Printing Office|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04dlwzB2SvcC&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=160|isbn=0160725526|accessdate=24 April 2014| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="venninstitute.org"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Szadziewski|first1=Henryk|title=Religious Repression of Uyghurs in East Turkestan|url=http://www.venninstitute.org/uncategorized/religious-repression-of-uyghurs-in-east-turkestan|website=Venn Institute|accessdate=26 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327231707/http://www.venninstitute.org/uncategorized/religious-repression-of-uyghurs-in-east-turkestan|archive-date=27 March 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s Islamic private schools (Sino-Arabic schools (中阿學校)) have been supported and permitted by the Chinese government among Muslim areas, only specifically excluding Xinjiang from allowing these schools because of separatist sentiment there.&lt;ref name="VersteeghEid2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kees Versteegh|author2=Mushira Eid|title=Encyclopedia of Arabic Language and Linguistics: A-Ed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SuNiAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA383|year=2005|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-9004144736|pages=383–|quote=The People's Republic, founded in 1949, banned private confessional teaching from the early 1950s to the 1980s, until a more liberal stance allowed religious mosque education to resume and private Muslim schools to open.

''[[The Diplomat]]'' reported on the fact that while Uyghur's religious activities are curtailed, Hui Muslims are granted widespread religious freedom and that therefore the policy of the Chinese government towards Uyghurs in Xinjiang is not directed against Islam, but rather aggressively stamping out the Uyghur separatist threat.&lt;ref name="Brent Crane, The Diplomat"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/08/a-tale-of-two-chinese-muslim-minorities/|title=A Tale of Two Chinese Muslim Minorities|author=Brent Crane |work=The Diplomat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uyghur views vary by the oasis they live in. China has historically favored Turpan and Hami. Uyghurs in Turfan and Hami and their leaders like Emin Khoja allied with the Qing against Uyghurs in [[Altishahr]]. During the Qing dynasty, China enfeoffed the rulers of Turpan and Hami (Kumul) as autonomous princes, while the rest of the Uyghurs in Altishahr (the Tarim Basin) were ruled by Begs.&lt;ref name="Rudelson &amp; Rudelson 1997"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MT2D_0_eBPQC&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Rudelson &amp; Rudelson 1997], p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Uyghurs from Turpan and Hami were appointed by China as officials to rule over Uyghurs in the Tarim Basin. Turpan is more economically prosperous and views China more positively than the rebellious Kashgar, which is the most anti-China oasis. Uyghurs in Turpan are treated leniently and favourably by China with regards to religious policies, while Kashgar is subjected to controls by the government.&lt;ref name="MT2D_0_eBPQC pp. 46-7"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MT2D_0_eBPQC&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Rudelson &amp; Rudelson 1997], pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Central Asia Monitor 1993"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cQppAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Turpan+liberalization+religious&amp;dq=Turpan+liberalization+religious&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NifdU7nqMdPfsATz7ICQBQ&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg ''Central Asia Monitor'' 1993], p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In Turpan and Hami, religion is viewed more positively by China than religion in Kashgar and Khotan in southern Xinjiang.&lt;ref name="Mackerras 2003"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3EWAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA118#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Mackerras 2003], p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Uyghur and Han Communist officials in Turpan turn a blind eye to the law and allow religious Islamic education for Uyghur children.&lt;ref name="Svanberg &amp; Westerlund 2012"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jTVjWTllOGgC&amp;pg=PA202#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Svanberg &amp; Westerlund 2012], p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MT2D_0_eBPQC p. 81"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MT2D_0_eBPQC&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Rudelson &amp; Rudelson 1997], p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrating at religious functions and going on Hajj to Mecca is encouraged by the Chinese government, for Uyghur members of the Communist party.

=====Tibet=====
When Hui started migrating into [[Lhasa]] in the 1990s, rumors circulated among Tibetans in Lhasa about the Hui, such as that they were [[cannibal]]s or ate children.&lt;ref name="Fischer"/&gt;{{rp|2, 5, 10, 17–20}} In February 2003, Tibetans rioted against Hui, destroying Hui-owned shops and restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/east/02/23/china.clash.reut/index.html|title=Tibetans, Muslim Huis clash in China|date=2003-02-23|accessdate=2010-01-15|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local [[Tibetan Buddhist]] religious leaders led a regional boycott movement that encouraged Tibetans to boycott Hui-owned shops, spreading the racist myth that Hui put the ashes of cremated [[imam]]s in the cooking water they used to serve Tibetans food, in order to convert Tibetans to Islam.&lt;ref name="Fischer"/&gt;

In Tibet, the majority of Muslims are Hui people. Hatred between Tibeans and Muslims stems from events during the Muslim warlord [[Ma Bufang]]'s oppressive rule in Qinghai such as [[Ngolok rebellions (1917–49)]] and the [[Sino-Tibetan War]], but in 1949 the Communists put an end to the violence between Tibetans and Muslims, however, new Tibetan-Muslim violence broke out after China engaged in liberalization. Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over incidents such as bones in soups and prices of balloons, and Tibetans accused Muslims of being cannibals who cooked humans in their soup and of contaminating food with urine. Tibetans attacked Muslim restaurants. Fires set by Tibetans which burned the apartments and shops of Muslims resulted in Muslim families being killed and wounded in the 2008 mid-March riots. Due to Tibetan violence against Muslims, the traditional Islamic white caps have not been worn by many Muslims. Scarfs were removed and replaced with hairnets by Muslim women in order to hide. Muslims prayed in secret at home when in August 2008 the Tibetans burned the Mosque. Incidents such as these which make Tibetans look bad on the international stage are covered up by the [[Tibetan exile]] community. The repression of Tibetan separatism by the Chinese government is supported by Hui Muslims.&lt;ref name="Demick"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/23/world/fg-muslims23 |title=Tibetan-Muslim tensions roil China |last=Demick |first=Barbara |publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' |accessdate=2010-06-28 |deadurl=yes |date=23 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622013126/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/23/world/fg-muslims23 |archivedate=22 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Chinese-speaking Hui have problems with Tibetan Hui (the Tibetan speaking [[Kache]] minority of Muslims).&lt;ref name="Mayaram 2009 75"&gt;{{cite book| first = Shail |last=Mayaram| title = The other global city| url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=tOZ1pBTJvp4C}}| accessdate = 2010-07-30| year = 2009| publisher = Taylor Francis US| isbn = 0415991943| page = 75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 October 2012, a mob of about 200 [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] monks beat a dozen Dungans (Hui Muslims) in [[Luqu County]], [[Gansu]] province, in retaliation for the Chinese Muslim community's application to build a mosque in the county.&lt;ref name="Ethnic Clashes Over Gansu Mosque"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/mosque-10082012100424.html|title=Ethnic Clashes Over Gansu Mosque|work=Radio Free Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Chinese government supports and backs up the Hui Muslims, the Tibetans deliberately attack the Hui Muslims as a way to demonstrate anti-government sentiment and because they have a background of sectarian violence against each other since Ma Bufang's rule due to their separate religions and ethnicity and Tibetans resent Hui economic domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/analects/2012/11/tibetan-protest|title=The living picture of frustration |author=A.A. |date=11 November 2012|accessdate=2014-01-15|newspaper=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major riots took place in [[Ranchi]], Bihar in 1967 and in [[Ahmedabad]] in Gujarat in 1969. In the 1970s and 1980s major communal riots took place. In many of these riots nearly 1000 Muslims were killed. In [[Bombay riots|1992–93 riots]] took place in Bombay in which 575 Muslims perished.

The roots of the communal disharmony and violence between Hindus and Muslims goes back to the history of several centuries. Historical analysis of Hindu-Muslim conflict has been highly contentious. Contemporary historians of India do not even agree that there were Hindu or Muslim communal identities before the nineteenth century. Historians like Sarkar view Hindu-Muslim conflict as essentially modern phenomena as communal riots do seem to have been significantly rare down to the 1880s. However, on the other side are historians who argue that Hindu-Muslim conflict has a longer history and, according some arguments, extends into the early period of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule. According to this view, inter-religious strife and riots which resemble contemporary Hindu-Muslim conflict were present, even endemic, in pre-modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=w5SlnZilfMMC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=communal+riots+in+india+mostly+muslim#v=onepage&amp;q=communal%20riots%20in%20india%20mostly%20muslim&amp;f=false|title=The Ethics of Terrorism: Innovative Approaches from an International Perspective|last=|first=|publisher=Charles C Thomas Publisher|year=2009|isbn=978-0398079956|location=|page=23|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sinhala Buddhist Nationalism is opposed to Sarvodaya, although they share many of the same influences like [[Dharmapāla]]'s teachings by example, by having a focus upon Sinhalese culture and ethnicity sanctioning the use of violence in defence of dhamma, while Sarvodaya has emphasized the application of Buddhist values in order to transform society and campaigning for peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Powers|first1=John|title=Destroying Mara Forever: Buddhist Ethics Essays in Honor of Damien Keown|date=2009|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|isbn=978-1559397889|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7zO-zLaSwXoC&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Islam in Tajikistan|Religion in Tajikistan}}
Sunni Islam of the [[Hanafi]] school has been officially recognized by the government since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Avaz Yuldashev|url=http://asiaplus.tj/news/16/47964.html|script-title=ru:«Ханафия» объявлена официальным религиозным течением Таджикистана|trans-title="Hanafi" declared the official religious movement in Tajikistan|language=ru|date=5 March 2009|dead-url=y|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825055806/http://asiaplus.tj/news/16/47964.html|archive-date=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tajikistan considers itself a [[secular state]] with a Constitution providing for freedom of religion. The Government has declared two Islamic holidays, [[Eid ul-Fitr|Id Al-Fitr]] and [[Eid al-Adha|Idi Qurbon]], as State holidays. According to a [[U.S. State Department]] release and Pew research group, the population of Tajikistan is 98% [[Muslim]]. Approximately 87–95% of them are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and roughly 3% are [[Shia]] and roughly 7% are [[non-denominational Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-1-religious-affiliation/#identity Pew Forum on Religious &amp; Public life, Chapter 1: Religious Affiliation] retrieved 29 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5775.htm |title=Background Note: Tajikistan |publisher=State.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining 2% of the population are followers of [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]], a variety of Protestant denominations, Catholicism, [[Zoroastrianism]] and Buddhism.

A great majority of Muslims fast during Ramadan, although only about one third in the countryside and 10% in the cities observe daily prayer and dietary restrictions.

There is some reported concern among mainstream Muslim leaders that minority religious groups undermine national unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Religious Freedom Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2001/5719.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a concern for religious institutions becoming active in the political sphere. The [[Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan|Islamic Renaissance Party]] (IRP), a major combatant in the [[Tajikistan Civil War|1992–1997 Civil War]] and then-proponent of the creation of an [[State religion#Islamic states|Islamic state]] in Tajikistan, constitutes no more than 30% of the government by statute. Membership in [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]], a party which today aims for a nonviolent overthrow of secular governments and the unification of Tajiks under one Islamic state, is illegal and members are subject to arrest and imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Hizb ut Tahrir | newspaper =BBC News | publisher = | date =2003-08-27 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/3182271.stm | accessdate = 2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers of large mosques appropriate for Friday prayers are limited and some{{who|date=December 2012}} feel this is discriminatory.

By law, religious communities must register by the State Committee on Religious Affairs (SCRA) and with local authorities. Registration with the SCRA requires a charter, a list of 10 or more members, and evidence of local government approval prayer site location. Religious groups who do not have a physical structure are not allowed to gather publicly for prayer. Failure to register can result in large fines and closure of place of worship. There are reports that registration on the local level is sometimes difficult to obtain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=190 Tajikistan: Religious freedom survey] – [[Forum 18]] News Service, 20 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; People under the age of 18 are also barred from public religious practice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper U.

The reason for having Tajikistan in this article is primarily because the government of the country itself, is – or is seen to be – the source of claimed persecution of Muslims. (As opposed to coming from outside forces or other religious groups.) This can make the reported issues open to bias by media and personal religious beliefs or preferences. In actual fact, the government – with the apparent approval of the people – is attempting to keep the government completely secular (full separation of Church and State) to avoid what they perceive as problems in other surrounding countries.&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of State"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Religious Freedom Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2001/5719.htm|publisher=U.S. Government|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respects this right &lt;ref name="U.S. Department of State"/&gt;
* There are some restrictions, and the Government monitors the activities of religious institutions to keep them from becoming overtly political.&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of State"/&gt;
* Religious communities must be registered by the Committee on Religious Affairs, which monitors the activities of Muslim groups&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of State"/&gt;
* The official reason given to justify registration is to ensure that religious groups act in accordance with the law but in practice it ensures they do not become overly political.&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of State"/&gt;
* President Imomali Rahmonov strongly defended "secularism", likely understood both by the President and his audience, as being "antireligious" rather than "nonreligious."&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of State"/&gt;
* The vast majority of citizens, including members of the Government, consider themselves Muslims and are not anti-Islamic but there is a pervasive fear of Islamic fundamentalism in both the government and much of the population at large.&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of State"/&gt;
* A 1998 law prohibits the creation of political parties with a religious orientation.&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of State"/&gt;
* A November 2015 rule reportedly bans Government Employees from attending Friday Prayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tajikistan: USCIRF Criticizes Crackdown on Religious Freedom|url=http://www.uscirf.gov/news-room/press-releases/tajikistan-uscirf-criticizes-crackdown-religious-freedom|accessdate=31 January 2016|agency=U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom|issue=Religious Freedom|publisher=USCIRF|date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eurasianet1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/75501|title=Tajikistan: Friday Prayers Ban for Government Workers|work=EurasiaNet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Friday "Government Employee Prayer ban" appears to relate to leaving work during normal working hours to attend prayers. "Over the last two weeks, after Idi Qurbon, our management forbade us from leaving work to attend Friday prayers," one unnamed government employee told Asia-Plus.&lt;ref name="eurasianet1"/&gt;

Mosques are not permitted to allow women inside due to a fatwa issued in August 2004, by the Tajik Council of Ulema, or scholars – the country's highest Muslim body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date= 20 October 2004 |title= Tajikistan: Top Islamic Body Bans Women From Attending Mosque Services  |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1055440.html |newspaper=Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the reasoning for this is that Tajikistan has 3,980 mosques, but very few are designed to allow men and women to worship separately, a practice Islam generally requires. The fatwa was not strictly enforced and more recently, it has been reported that the Ulema Council will relax the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date= 1 February 2014 |title= Tajik mosques open their doors wider to women  |url=http://islam.ru/en/content/story/tajik-mosques-open-their-doors-wider-women }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Qasr el Yahud''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{rtl-lang|ar|قصر اليهود}}; also Kasser/Qasser al-Yahud/Yehud etc.; lit. "Castle of the Jews", [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{rtl-lang|he|קאסר אל יהוד}}) is the official name of a [[baptism]] site in the [[Jordan River Valley]] in the [[Palestinian territories, Occupied|Occupied Territories of Palestine]]. Even if the site is not in Israel the site and facilities are administered by the [[Israeli Civil Administration]] and the [[Israeli Ministry of Tourism]] as part of an [[Israel Nature and Parks Authority|Israeli national park]].

It is the western part of the traditional site of the [[baptism of Jesus]] by [[John the Baptist]] ({{Bibleref2|Matthew 3:13-17}}), in Arabic [[Al-Maghtas]], a name which was historically used for the pilgrimage site on both sides of the river. It is also traditionally considered to be the place where the [[Israelites]] crossed the [[Jordan River]],&lt;ref name="Haaretz"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ginat |first=Gitit |date=January 14, 2010 |title=Take me to the river |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/take-me-to-the-river-1.261478 |work=Haaretz |location= |access-date=August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elijah the Prophet]] ascended to heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=May 16, 2016 |title=Jesus’s baptismal site, long sealed off, to be cleared of landmines |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/jesuss-baptismal-site-long-sealed-off-to-be-cleared-of-landmines/ |work=The Times of Israel |location= |access-date=August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:KasserAlYahud4.jpg|thumb|150px|Baptism site]]

==Etymology==
The Arabic name of the baptism site is [[Al-Maghtas]],  an area stretching over both banks of the river. The Jordanian side uses the names ''Al-Maghtas'', ''Bethany beyond the Jordan'' and ''Baptism(al) Site'', while the western part is known as ''Qasr el-Yahud''. The nearby Greek Orthodox Monastery of St John the Baptist has a castle-like appearance (thus ''qasr'', "castle"), and tradition holds that the Israelites crossed the river at this spot (thus ''el-Yahud'', "of the Jews").&lt;ref name="SWP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~240993~5512445:Composite--Map-of-Western-Palestine |title=Survey of Western Palestine, sheet 15 |publisher=[[Palestine Exploration Fund]] |accessdate=23 March 2015 }}&lt;!-- cf. on same map nearby "Kusr Hajleh", the Greek Orthodox Monastery of [[Gerasimus of the Jordan|St Gerasimos]], now more commonly known as Deir Hajla --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Patriarchate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jp-newsgate.net/en/2013/08/16/2854 |title=The Holy Monastery of St John the Baptist on the banks of the Jordan River/Qasr-el-Yahud |publisher=The [Greek Orthodox] Patriarchate of Jerusalem – Official News Gate |author= Theodosios Mitropoulos, architect |quote=The Holy Monastery of St John the Baptist on the banks of the Jordan River/Qasr-el-Yahud […] The perimeter walls, specifically their uppermost portion, terminate at battlements, which lend the monument the form of a Medieval castle.

==History==
[[Image:Baptism site - structure of Israel at Jordan River.jpg|thumb|Renovated facilities at Qasr el Yahud]]
Qasr el-Yahud is close to the ancient road and river ford connecting Jerusalem, via Jericho, to several [[Transjordan (Bible)|Transjordan]]ian biblical sites such as [[Madaba]], [[Mount Nebo]] and the [[King's Highway (ancient)|King's Highway]]. It is located in the [[West Bank]], a little southeast from [[Jericho]] and is part of the [[Jericho Governorate]] of [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date= |title=In rivalry over Jesus' baptism site, UNESCO backs Jordan over West Bank, as debate goes on |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/07/13/in-rivalry-over-jesus-baptism-site-unesco-backs-jordan-over-west-bank-as-debate.html |work=Fox News World |location=Al-Maghtas, Jordan |access-date=August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The modern site reopened in 2011 after being closed since the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]&lt;ref name="fox"/&gt;. The restoration project was approved before the 2000 [[millennium]] celebrations but was delayed due to the [[Second Intifada]] and flooding in the region in 2003&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt;. In 2000, Pope [[John Paul II]] landed at Qasr el Yahud in a helicopter and held private worship at the site.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt; 
 
Qasr el Yahud is administered by the Israeli Civil Administration and the Israeli Ministry of Tourism. Before the site became accessible, baptisms took place at [[Yardenit]].

'''Rangfarah''' is the name chosen for a revivalist movement of [[Tangsa]] traditional spirituality. The intention is "to give an alternative form of religious belief to those who were neither following the Christian beliefs nor the traditional ways". "Rangfrah" meaning "God" in the [[Longchang]] dialect was given a form very similar to that of the "[[Shiva]]" of the Hindu religion and a worshiping house called "Rangshom Him" was built to place the Rangfrah idol and make arrangement for the followers to gather and offer their prayers.

In the dialects of other [[Tangsa]] communities, the term for "God" takes variants such as Rangwa, Rangkhothak, etc. Traditionally, the Tangsas rarely practiced any kind of religious rituals dedicated to the God. However, they generally used various ways to invoke spirits to either receive their benevolent influences or to protect themselves from their malevolent activities. The rituals were mostly invocations, which predominantly involved offerings of animals, rice, rice-beer, eggs, etc. wrapped in leaves of a particular plant and then placing them at a sacred location specific to that particular ritual.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9602">[[File:Maesilea quadrifolia denjisou01.jpg|right|thumb|''Razkovniche'' is the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian-language]] name for the real plant ''[[Marsilea quadrifolia]]'', which shares some features with the legendary raskovnik.]]

In [[Slavic folklore]], the '''raskovnik''' or '''razkovniche''' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]] [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and {{lang-mk|расковник}}, {{lang-bg|разковниче}}, pronounced {{IPA-bg|rɐsˈkɔvnitʃɛ|}}, {{lang-ru|разрыв-трава}}, {{lang-pl|rozryw}}) is a magical [[herb]]. According to lore, the raskovnik has the magical property to unlock or uncover anything that is locked or closed. However, legends claim it is notoriously difficult to recognize the herb, and reputedly only certain [[chthonic]] animals are able to identify it.&lt;ref name="stoynev"&gt;{{cite book|last=Стойнев|first=Анани|author2=Димитър Попов |author3=Маргарита Василева |author4=Рачко Попов |title=Българска митология.

==Names==
The herb is known by a multitude of names among the South Slavs, and the names vary significantly by region. While ''razkovniche'' and ''raskovnik'' are the customary names in Bulgarian and Serbian respectively and the [[Root (linguistics)|root]] is also preserved in the [[Leskovac]] dialect as ''raskov'', in some parts of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] it is known as ''ež trava'' ("hedgehog grass"). In the vicinity of [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] (southeastern [[Montenegro]]), the term is ''demir-bozan'', a [[Turkish language|Turkish]] borrowing meaning "iron breaker". In [[Syrmia]], the plant is referred to as ''špirgasta trava ''(a [[hapax legomenon]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rječnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika|last = |first = |publisher = Jugoslavenska akademija znanosti i umjetnosti|year = 1959|isbn = |location = Zagreb|pages = 735|volume = 17|url = https://books.google.rs/books?id=1GI5AQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%C5%A1pirgast}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Slavonia]] it is known as ''zemaljski ključ'' ("earth key"), and in [[Slovenia]]'s [[Savinja Valley]] as ''mavričin koren'' ("rainbow root").&lt;ref name="radenkovic"/&gt;

==Description and properties==
Traditionally, it is considered that few people, if any, could actually recognize the herb.&lt;ref name="kulisic"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kulišić|first=Š.|author2=P. Ž. Petrović |author3=N. Pantelić |title=Српски митолошки речник|year=1970|publisher=Nolit|language=Serbian|chapter=Raskovnik|oclc=462860728}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Bulgarian sources the raskovnik is sometimes described as a [[grass]] resembling a [[four-leaf clover]]. It grows in meadows and may be picked either while green and blooming or in [[hay]], when it is already dry. While it is not necessarily rare, nor does it thrive only in remote locations, it is nevertheless impossible to recognize by the uninitiated.&lt;ref name="stareva"/&gt; In the words of Serbian linguist and folklorist [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]], “It is some (may be imaginary) grass for which it is thought that thanks to it (when brushed by it) every lock and every other closure would open by itself.”&lt;ref name="miljkovic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/knjizevnost/umetnicka/poezija/bmiljkovic-izbor_c.html#_Toc479683345|script-title=sr:Изабране песме|last=Миљковић|first=Бранко|date=2000-04-07|publisher=Пројекат Растко|language=Serbian|accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the legend, the raskovnik could unlock any gate or padlock, regardless of its size, material or key. It could also uncover treasures buried in the ground: in Bulgarian beliefs, it could split the ground at the place where a treasure lay so that people could locate it.&lt;ref name="stoynev"/&gt; In some regions of Serbia, the treasure itself was a [[Black Arab (mythology)|black man]] in chains who requested that a raskovnik be brought to him. The raskovnik would break the chains and the man would disappear into the ground to be replaced by a cauldron filled with gold coins.&lt;ref name="radenkovic"/&gt; Other supernatural properties attributed to the herb by Bulgarians include the [[alchemistry|alchemic]] ability to transmute [[iron]] into [[gold]], the more general ability to make the one who picked it forever happy&lt;ref name="stareva"/&gt; or wealthy.&lt;ref name="beniesh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnr.bg/sites/hristobotev/Shows/ChildrenShows/RadioTheatre/Pages/0102razkovniche_2010.aspx|title=Какво е това „разковниче”?|last=Бениеш|first=Мая|date=2010-01-01|publisher=БНР|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some interpretations, the raskovnik is a wonderful plant that makes true whatever its owner desires.&lt;ref name="borislavov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonapeti.bg/index.php?product=7&amp;art_id=416|title=Билките&amp;nbsp;– разковниче за добрия...|last=Бориславов|first=Ясен|year=2009|publisher=Бон Апети|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obtainment==
[[File:European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus).jpg|right|thumb|In some parts of [[Serbia]], hedgehogs are believed to be animals capable of identifying the raskovnik and involuntarily assisting people in obtaining it.]]
The raskovnik is believed to have been sought after by [[treasure hunter]]s, [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerers]] and [[herbalist]]s who desired its magic powers for personal benefit. In Serbia, it was believed that there exist certain treasures, such as the Treasure of Tsar Radovan, which could not be unlocked in any other way but employing a raskovnik.&lt;ref name="kulisic"/&gt;

As, according to Bulgarian folklore, [[tortoise]]s were the only beings who knew the appearance of the herb and the location where it grows, such people would try to obtain the raskovnik by deceiving a tortoise. They would find a tortoise nesting site and hem it in with a fence while the tortoise is away. When it returns, the tortoise would be unable to access its eggs, so it would return with a raskovnik in order to breach the fence. Thus, the tortoise would reveal the herb and people would acquire it from the tortoise, which does not need it anymore.&lt;ref name="stoynev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stareva"/&gt;&lt;ref name="radenkovic"/&gt;

While the tricking of a tortoise was the most popular method in Bulgarian mythology, in [[Dalmatia]] the legend refers to [[snake]]s,&lt;ref name="radenkovic"/&gt; and among [[Serbs]] another version involves the locking of young [[hedgehog]]s in a box for their mother to unlock. In Serbia, one would also have to be quick to take the raskovnik, as the hedgehog would swallow it after use. In any case, turtles, snakes and hedgehogs are all animals with chthonic characteristics which were often variously associated with the underworld in South Slavic tradition.&lt;ref name="radenkovic"/&gt;

Karadžić also mentions another Serbian method to obtain the raskovnik. He recorded a story from the town of [[Zemun]] about a merchant who desired to find the herb. The merchant locked an old woman into [[leg irons]] and let her wander in a field during the night; if the irons unlocked by themselves at a certain place, that would be a place where the raskovnik grows.&lt;ref name="kulisic"/&gt;

==Metaphoric use==
The legendary herb has entered the modern Bulgarian [[vocabulary]] as a metaphor for a magic key or a [[Panacea (medicine)|panacea]] in the wider sense. The phrase “to find the razkovniche” („да намериш разковничето“ ''„da namerish razkovnicheto“'') means to find the solution to a certain problem, usually a complex or difficult one.&lt;ref name="eurodict"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurodict.com/%D0%A0%D0%90%D0%97%D0%9A%D0%9E%D0%92%D0%9D%D0%98%D0%A7%D0%95+searchid-40684-ed_bg_en.html|title=Разковниче|publisher=Eurodict|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Razkovniche'' is also the common Bulgarian name for the plant [[Marsilea quadrifolia|European waterclover]] (''Marsilea quadrifolia'') which, in its appearance, has many similarities with the descriptions of the mythical raskovnik.&lt;ref name="bozhilova"&gt;{{cite book|last=Божилова|first=Е.|title=Ръководство по систематика на висшите растения|year=2003|publisher=Pensoft Publishers|language=Bulgarian|isbn=978-954-642-174-6|page=53|chapter=Marsilea quadrifolia L.&amp;nbsp;— Разковниче}}&lt;/ref&gt; In eastern Serbia, ''raskovnik'' also refers to a specific plant used in vernacular medicine, namely ''[[Laserpitium siler]]''.&lt;ref name="radenkovic"/&gt;

==Programs and Facilities==
RRC is a graduate institution.  Rabbinical and other degree candidate students are required to have a bachelor's degree, and meet Hebrew and other requirements before enrolling.

Graduates of the five- to six-year program are required to spend one of those years studying in Israel before graduating. Graduates receive the title of [[rabbi]] and a [[Master of Arts]] degree in Hebrew letters.  RRC offers specialized training tracks in five different areas:  congregational life; education [with [[Gratz College]], leading to an M.A. in Jewish education]; geriatric chaplaincy; campus rabbinate; and communal organization.  RRC also offers a master's degree program in Jewish studies.

From its early years, RRC included students in decision making. Representatives of students, alumni, faculty, and administration meet in a College Council that advises on current issues. In addition, all these groups have representatives on the RRC Board of Governors.  Students are members of the Reconstructionist Student Association (RSA.)

The college's main building is {{convert|27500|sqft|m2}} and is red-brick, slate-roofed, and an example of [[Georgian architecture]]. It includes classrooms, a lounge, faculty and administrative offices, the Einstein Reconstructionist Archives; a beit midrash (study and discussion hall, also used for religious services); a media center, and conference rooms. The adjacent Goldyne Savad Library Center opened in 1999.  The library houses approximately 50,000 books on Judaica, primarily in English, [[Hebrew]], and [[Yiddish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barasch |first=Sarah |url=http://www.rrc.edu |title=Home &amp;#124; RRC |publisher=Rrc.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College enrollment and alumni==
The first graduate of RRC, Michael Luckens, was ordained in 1973.  From its second year, 1969, RRC students included women.  [[Sandy Eisenberg Sasso]] was ordained in 1974, the second woman rabbi in the United States, and the first female Reconstructionist rabbi.  Since 1984, RRC has admitted and allowed the ordination of openly gay, bisexual, and lesbian rabbis, the first major rabbinic seminary to do so.&lt;ref&gt;RRC press release, “Reconstructionist Movement to Respond to Vote of Conservative Movement on Homosexuality,” Dec. 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2018, RRC has graduated more than 420 rabbis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jewishexponent.com/2018/01/31/reconstructionist-judaism-gets-rebrand/|title=Reconstructionist Judaism Gets a Rebrand - Jewish Exponent|last=Kurland|first=Rachel|date=2018-01-31|work=Jewish Exponent|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most RRC graduates are members of the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association]].  Approximately half the graduates serve congregations (Reconstructionist, those affiliated with other movements, or unaffiliated.)  Others serve in academia, in Hillel and campus positions, as civilian and military chaplains, educators, in Jewish agencies, or are employed by the Reconstructionist movement.  About one-fifth work in other areas, including as authors, editors, researchers, spiritual counselors, independent rabbis, or are retired. RRC graduates serve Jewish communities in the US, Canada, Australia, France, and Israel.

==College Centers==
The College sponsors three program centers:

===The Center for Jewish Ethics===
The Center for [[Jewish ethics]] has published a series of guides with multiple commentaries, using contemporary and classical Jewish sources on topics including bioethics, the ethics of speech, and the ethics of organizations.

===Kolot, The Center for Jewish Women's and Gender Studies===
Created in 1996, this center works in both [[gender studies|gender]] and [[women's studies]]. Kolot sponsors a variety of publications and seminars. It hosts a Web site for creative Jewish liturgy for holidays and life cycle events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ritualwell.org |title=Tradition &amp; Innovation |publisher=Ritualwell.org |date=2015-05-11 |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History: Founding to 1981==
[[Reconstructionist Judaism]], a liberal movement that views Judaism as the “evolving religious civilization of the Jewish people” was established by [[Mordecai Kaplan]] in the 1930s as a school of thought. He had extensive influence on American Judaism, particularly on Conservative and Reform Judaism.  However, his followers, including [[Ira Eisenstein]] (Kaplan’s son-in-law and leader of the Jewish Reconstructionist Foundation from 1959 onward) were frustrated by the lack of a continuing framework to promote their ideas in American Judaism. Eisenstein criticized dependence on “’Reconstructionist rabbis’ …borrowed from the ranks of Reform and Conservativism…A movement must produce its own leaders.”&lt;ref&gt;Ira Eisenstein, “From School of Thought to Movement.” Reconstructionist, 41:1 (February, 1975) p.5&lt;/ref&gt;  Kaplan himself was reluctant to establish a seminary which would mean creating a separate denomination alongside Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox Judaism.  However, lay and rabbinic leaders of the small Federation of Reconstructionist Congregations and Havurot (FRCH, later re-named the Jewish Reconstructionist Federation) encouraged this step, and Kaplan eventually gave his blessing.&lt;ref&gt;M. Kaplan, “Why A Reconstructionist Rabbinical College?”  Reconstructionist 35:14 (2 Jan. 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;  At the FRCH conference in Montreal in June, 1967, the delegates overwhelmingly called for the establishment of a school for training rabbis.

The college opened in 1968 based in two brownstone buildings at 2308 North Broad Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, near [[Temple University]].&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Ann Musher, “Reconstructionist Judaism in the Mind of [[Mordecai Kaplan]]: The Transformation from a Philosophy into a Religious Denomination,” American Jewish History, 86:4, December 1998, pp. 397-417.  Also see Eric Caplan, From Ideology to Liturgy: Reconstructionist Worship and American Liberal Judaism (Hebrew Union College Press, New York and Cincinnati, 2002) pp.135 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

From its founding, RRC had two unique features in its curriculum. First, based on the Reconstructionist concept of an “evolving religious civilization” the five-year curriculum was centered on a historical period each year. These were biblical, rabbinic, medieval, modern (roughly to 1948), and contemporary periods.  During each year, students would focus on the history, texts, and concepts of that period. With modifications, this developmental approach continues as a central feature of the RRC curriculum. RRC describes this goal:”…students enter into a dialogue with those in previous generations who addressed perennial human issues. In this way, RRC educates leaders who can articulate the voice of tradition as it speaks to today’s Jews.” &lt;ref&gt;RRC Catalogue, 2007-09, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second curricular innovation, based on Kaplan’s concept that American Jews live in two civilizations (Jewish and American), had all rabbinical students enroll in a secular doctoral program, initially in religion at [[Temple University]] (a nearby state-related institution), later including other potential majors and universities.  The goal was that students be aware of general trends in the study of religion and of other religious traditions. This “dual program” proved difficult to complete, as most students were enrolled in two graduate programs while also working part-time.  The initial doctoral requirement was eventually reduced to a secular master's degree.

The Reconstructionist Rabbinical College also recognized that future rabbis needed preparation in addition to purely academic courses and text studies.  From the early years of RRC there were courses in practical rabbinics, covering such issues as pastoral counseling and life cycle events.  In more recent years these have expanded to a multi-tiered program of practical rabbinics that includes coursework, supervised field internships, group supervision, and a requirement to shadow religious leaders in the field.

==History: 1981-1993==
[[File:Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in Wyncote, PA.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Ziegleman Hall, the RRC's main building]]
In 1981, Eisenstein, the founding president, retired, succeeded by Ira Silverman (1981–86).  Under his leadership RRC moved from its urban setting in September 1982 to its current location, formerly the mansion of [[John Charles Martin]], on Church Road in suburban Wyncote.

By the early 1980s, curriculum changes at RRC included more Hebrew, classic texts, and electives, reducing the time available for secular graduate studies. In addition, many more entering students were preparing for their second career and had already completed a secular master's degree or the equivalent. The “dual program” requirement for a secular graduate degree was dropped. However, a program of courses in religious studies including Christianity, Islam, and Eastern religions was instituted at RRC, some taught by adjunct faculty. At least two of these courses, including one in Christianity, are required for rabbinical students.&lt;ref&gt;RRC Catalogue, 2007-09, pp. 25, 35-36&lt;/ref&gt; A mekhinah (preparatory) year was added for many students who needed additional work in Hebrew and traditional Jewish sources and traditions.

[[Arthur Green]], a student of mysticism and a founder of the [[havurah]] movement, became president in 1986 after serving as dean from 1984.  Faculty and student enrollment significantly increased, and the Israel study program expanded.  To move beyond a strictly academic focus, RRC began offering programs in spiritual growth in 1987, under the leadership of dean Jacob Staub.  Staub commented that the early focus of RRC, as with other seminaries, was not on questions of meaning but “We were going for the original, objective, dispassionate description of phenomena.”  But this expansion enabled the faculty to begin working with students as spiritual people and future leaders.&lt;ref&gt;RRC, 2007 annual report, “Spiritual Practice and Study Move to the Head of the Class: by Gerald S. Cohen, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first experimental edition of a new Reconstructionist Sabbath eve prayer book, the first in the Kol Haneshamah series, by the Reconstructionist Press in 1989 included contributions from a number of RRC faculty members.

==History: Since 1993==
[[David Teutsch]] became president in 1993.  During his tenure the college strengthened its financial base and expanded its programs, publications, and facilities.&lt;ref&gt;David Teutsch, “Rabbis for the 21st Century,” Sh’ma, January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  The new series of Reconstructionist prayer books, Kol Haneshamah, was published under the leadership of Teutsch. Although RRC struggled to reach a $500,000 minimum endowment in its early years, by 1992 it reached $2.4 million, $14.8 million in 2004, and $19.7 million in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;“Innovations in Spirit and Practice,” RRC Annual Report, 2007 p. 39 See also Caplan, From Ideology to Liturgy, p.135ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cantorial and master’s programs in Jewish studies were added.  Three academic centers were established, The Center for Jewish Ethics (1994); Kolot: The Center for Jewish Women’s and Gender Studies (1996) and Hiddur: The Center for Aging and Judaism (2003).

RRC had long been preparing students for a variety of rabbinic careers, including campus work, chaplaincy, and Jewish education as well as congregational leadership.  Especially since the mid-1990s many students take at least one unit of [[Clinical Pastoral Education]], a supervised program of training for clergy and other caregivers, often based in a hospital.

During this time the college expanded its vision of modeling creation of a Jewish community for its future rabbis. From 1998, aided by a grant from the Nathan Cummings Foundation, a Jewish spiritual direction program founded by faculty member Jacob Staub grew.  In 2007, on a completely voluntary basis, spiritual direction included 75% of the student body.  The program includes individual meetings with a spiritual director, small groups, and in hevrutah (partners or dyads).&lt;ref&gt;RRC Catalogue, 2008-09, pp. 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt;  Faculty member Barbara Breitman says, “Every spiritual tradition has within it the qualities of soul that people need to cultivate in their lives so that they can live according to a higher sense of purpose: generosity, patience, gratitude, truthfulness.  Spiritual companioning needs to support people in cultivating those qualities.” &lt;ref&gt;RRC, 2007 annual report, “Spiritual Practice” p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

The college marked a milestone in 2002 when Rabbi [[Dan Ehrenkrantz]] became the first graduate of RRC to become president.  The RRC curriculum continues to be based on its civilizational approach.  In addition, the college focuses on developing community and integrating spiritual growth with academic studies.&lt;ref&gt;"Ahavah Rabbah:To Learn And To Teach" inaugural address delivered by Rabbi Dan Ehrenkrantz on April 6, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Rabbi [[Deborah Waxman]] was elected as the President of RRC.&lt;ref name="thejewishweek1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anne Cohen |url=http://forward.com/articles/185252/trailblazing-reconstructionist-deborah-waxman-reli/?p=all |title=Trailblazing Reconstructionist Deborah Waxman Relishes Challenges of Judaism - News – |publisher=Forward.com |date=2013-10-09 |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the President, she is believed to be the first woman and first lesbian to lead a Jewish congregational union, and the first female rabbi and first lesbian to lead a Jewish seminary; RRC is both a congregational union and a seminary.&lt;ref name="thejewishweek1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In 2015 RRC voted to accept rabbinical students in interfaith relationships, making Reconstructionist Judaism the first type of Judaism to officially allow rabbis in relationships with non-Jewish partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/75811/reconstructionists-give-green-light-to-intermarried-rabbinical-students|title=Reconstructionists give green light to intermarried rabbinical students|publisher=Jweekly|author=Lisa Hostein|date=October 1, 2015|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shrine of Our Lady of the Prairies was begun in the 1950s by the late Reverend Fredrick J Nelson.  Father Nelson started a grade school and high school in 1961, and built a retirement home also.  He founded an order of [[nun]]s, the Marian Sisters, headed by Sister Lillian.  He had "pilgrimages" during the summer months, drawing thousands of faithful from all over the world to [[Powers Lake, North Dakota|Powers Lake, ND]].  After Father Nelson's passing the numbers of faithful who came to Powers Lake began to dwindle.

==Overview==
The title of the book is drawn from a quote from ''[[Meditations]]'', a series of personal writings by Roman emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]]: “''The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way''.”&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; Holiday draws from ''Meditations'', Aurelius, and the philosophy of [[stoicism]] to expand the idea that how we respond to obstacles is what defines us.&lt;ref name=les&gt;{{cite web|last1=HERRMANN|first1=JOSHI|title=How to avoid a work crisis with a 'pre-mortem'|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/how-to-avoid-a-work-crisis-with-a-premortem-9356225.html|work=London Evening Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holiday argues that obstacles don't inhibit success, they create success and that readers should see "through the negative, past its underside, and into its corollary: the positive."&lt;ref name=pw&gt;{{cite web|title=The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Adversity to Advantage|url=http://reg.publishersweekly.com/978-1-59184-635-2|publisher=Publisher's Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes2&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trapp|first1=Roger|title=True Leaders Do As A Roman Did - And Focus On The Positive|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogertrapp/2014/05/29/true-leaders-do-as-a-roman-did-and-focus-on-the-positive/|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Vajrayana}}
The '''True Buddha School'''  ({{zh|t=真佛宗|p=Zhēn Fó Zōng|poj=Chin-hu̍t-chong}}) is a new religious movement with Buddhist overtones based in Taiwan and parts of East Asia with influence from [[Sutrayana]] and [[Taoism]].

Founded in the late 1980s, the founder of this sect is [[Lu Sheng-yen]] (盧勝彥), often referred to by his followers as a ''[[tulku]]'', a Tibetan term for a reincarnated teacher or deity. He is called the ''Root Guru'' by his disciples. Lu claims to be a [[samyaksambuddha|fully enlightened buddha]], known by his disciples as "Living Buddha Lian-sheng" (蓮生活佛). He is a writer who has written approximately 232 books to date.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} As of Feb of 2013, the organization claims over 5,000,000 became Buddhists through Lu.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed|date=September 2015}}

==Teachings ==
Members of the True Buddha School emphasize the necessity to [[Sādhanā|cultivate]] diligently for the benefit of spiritual advancement, as is practiced in general Vajrayana Buddhism. This is done through empowerment directly from the Root Guru, who himself proclaims to be an emanated being from the [[Pure Land]]s shed directly from [[Vairocana Buddha]], then later achieving enlightenment in the human realm through his own rigorous practice and after being given several empowerments from other buddhas and bodhisattvas. A Tantric Buddhist practitioner cannot rely solely on listening or reading spiritual doctrines, or simply worshiping and paying respect to buddhas and bodhisattvas as the method to achieve the goal of spiritual liberation. All students are expected to follow the fourteen Root Tantric Vows (known as [[Vajrayana]] [[samaya]]) along with the Five Precepts that all Buddhists should follow, and to respect the Root Guru.

There is a structured curriculum to guide the student's practice, and at each level, a specific yoga is practiced.  To advance to the next level, the student must achieve yogic response from the yoga being practiced in the current level and receive empowerment for the yoga of the next level.

As a beginner, there are specific yogas that are practiced to establish a strong foundation. The yoga practiced in the first stage is [[Vajrasattva]] yoga, a great repentance yoga to purify bad karma. The next level is [[Guru Yoga]], followed by Personal [[Deity yoga]] and then the inner body practices of energy yoga.

== Worldwide chapters ==
True Buddha School has chapters across North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Latin America, though the size of each local chapter varies. The main temple is located in [[Redmond, Washington]], it also served as the main residence where Lu resided while he was living in United States. He lived in Tahiti with his wife Lian Hsiang in solitude for six years before re-emerging in the US in 2006, returning to his home in Redmond.

The majority of the followers of the True Buddha School are located in Asia, and many devotees are from Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan. Across North America, Australia, and Europe, the majority of the students are immigrants of Asian descent.

True Buddha School's funding relies heavily on donations. This is supplemented with the income from the publication of Lu's books and videos of his sermons. The money is used to publish its teaching materials and for charity work such as the South Asian tsunami relief effort. True Buddha School disseminates Buddhist teachings through Lu's sermons, books and articles. These materials are supplemented with sermons and articles by other [[acharyas]] (other gurus) certified by the grand master. Lu's books are mainly published in Chinese, with a limited number currently being translated into English. However, more translations are slowly being made to reach a wider audience. Many of the major True Buddha School sadhanas (liturgies) and practices are available in English.

==Objection==
Venerable [[Hsuan Hua]] warned his disciples about Lu Sheng-yen's claims, lamenting that many modern people lack [[wisdom]], and dismissing Lu by saying, "I don't know what this person is. I call him a [[demon]] [[runt]]."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drbachinese.org/vbs/publish/319/vbs319p033.htm|title=Discussion of Venerable Master Hsuan Hua's Contribution to Buddhism|author=You-Bin Chen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lu was criticized for eating meat, drinking [[alcohol]], and "playing around with women."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Despite being the largest Vajrayana sect in Taiwan, the True Buddha School has been criticized by six Buddhist organizations in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=七大佛團舉證  | url=http://www.sinchew.com.my/node/26973| date =2007-10-25| accessdate=2007-10-25| publisher =[[Sin Chew Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2002, Lu and his temple (Ling Shen Ching Tze Temple) were sued in Washington State by a former member who alleged [[sexual abuse]] on the part of Master Lu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=wa&amp;vol=2002_app/49309-4&amp;invol=3 S.H.C., et al., v.

However, because of lack of evidence, the charges did not hold.

Typically, this ritual was for 8 year olds in ancient India, but is now practiced for all ages.&lt;ref name=haroldcoward&gt;Harold Coward et al (1997), Religious Dimensions of Child and Family Life, Wilfrid Laurier University Press, {{ISBN|978-1550581041}}, page 67&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Upanayana''' ({{lang-sa|उपनयन}} {{IAST|upanayana-}}) is one of the traditional [[Sanskara (rite of passage)|saṃskāra]]s (rites of passage) that marked the acceptance of a student by a ''[[guru]]'' (teacher) and an individual's entrance to a school in [[Hinduism]]. The tradition is widely discussed in ancient [[Sanskrit]] texts of India and varies regionally.&lt;ref name=kaneupan/&gt; The '''sacred thread''' ('''''yagyopavita''''' or '''''janeu''''') is received by the boy during this ceremony, that he continues wearing across his chest thereafter.

The upanayana was restricted in many medieval Indian texts to the upper three of the four [[varna (Hinduism)|varna]]s (castes) of society — [[brahmin]]s, [[kshatriya]]s and [[vaishya]]s. However, [[Vedic period]] texts such as the [[Baudhayana|Baudhāyana]] ''Grihyasutra'' encouraged all members of society to undergo the upanayana, even  (manual workers)  [[shudra]]s.{{sfn|Mookerji|1998|p=174}}&lt;ref name=elgood/&gt;&lt;ref name=scharfe/&gt; Women were encouraged to undergo upanayana in ancient India before they started Vedic studies or before their wedding.&lt;ref name=pvkaneyajnow/&gt;

==Etymology==
''Upanayana'' ([[Sanskrit]]: उपनयन) literally means "the act of leading to or near".&lt;ref name=mmwupa&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/tamil/recherche upanyana] Monier Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, Cologne Sanskrit Digital Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; It is an important and widely discussed samskara in ancient Sanskrit text.&lt;ref name=kaneupan/&gt; The rite of passage symbolizes the leading or drawing towards the self of a child, in a school, by a teacher.&lt;ref name=mmwupa/&gt; It is a ceremony in which a guru (teacher) accepts and draws a child towards knowledge and initiates the second birth that is of the young mind and spirit.&lt;ref name=kaneupan/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Upanayanam.jpg|thumb|right|A boy during his upanayana ritual. The thin, yellow ''Yajnopavita'' thread runs from left shoulder to waist. Note the [[Sugarcane|munja grass]] girdle around the waist. The [[Sacred Fig|peepal tree]] twig in his right hand marks his entry into the [[Brahmacharya]] stage of life.]]
Upanayana is the rite of passage for the start of formal education of writing, numbers, reading, [[Vedanga]]s, arts and other skills.&lt;ref name=pandeyupan&gt;Rajbali Pandey (2013), Hindu Saṁskāras: Socio-religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803961}}, pages 111-117&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Upanayana'' rite of passage was also important to the teacher, as the student would therefrom begin to live in the ''gurukul'' (school).&lt;ref name=kaneupan&gt;PV Kane, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofdharmas029210mbp#page/n325/mode/2up Samskara, Chapter VII], History of Dharmasastras, Vol II, Part I, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages 268-287&lt;/ref&gt;

Upanayana was an elaborate ceremony, that included rituals involving the family, the child and the teacher. A boy receives during this ceremony a sacred thread called ''Yajñopaveetam'' that he wears. The ''Yajñopavita'' ceremony announced that the child had entered into formal education.&lt;ref name=kaneupan2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ram Chandra Prasad (1997), The Upanayana: The Hindu Ceremonies of the Sacred Thread, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812406}}, pages 119-131&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era, the Upanayana rite of passage is open to anyone at any age.&lt;ref name=haroldcoward/&gt;

The education of a student was not limited to ritual and philosophical speculations found in the Vedas and the Upanishads. They extended to many arts and crafts, which had their own, similar rites of passages.&lt;ref name=stella&gt;Stella Kramrisch (1958), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/538558 Traditions of the Indian Craftsman], ''The Journal of American Folklore'', Vol. 71, No. 281, pages 224-230&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aitareya Brahmana]], Agamas and [[Puranas]] literature of Hinduism describe these as ''Shilpa Sastras''. They extend to all practical aspects of culture, such as the sculptor, the potter, the perfumer, the wheelwright, the painter, the weaver, the architect, the dancer, and the musician. Ancient Indian texts assert that the number of the arts is unlimited, but each deploy elements of 64 ‘‘kala’’ (कला, techniques) and 32 ‘‘vidyas’’ (विद्या, fields of knowledge).&lt;ref name=stella/&gt; The training of these began from childhood and included studies about [[dharma]], culture, reading, writing, mathematics, geometry, colors, tools, as well as traditions (trade secrets). The rites of passage during apprentice education varied in the respective guilds.&lt;ref name=elgood&gt;Heather Elgood (2000), Hinduism and the religious arts, {{ISBN|978-0304707393}}, Bloomsbury Academic, pages 32-134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stella Kramrisch, The Hindu Temple, Vol 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120802223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rajbali Pandey compares the Upanayana rite of passage to Baptism in Christianity where the person is born again unto spiritual knowledge, as the ceremony marked the initiation of the student for spiritual studies such as the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref name=pandeyupan/&gt;

==Age, gender and varna restrictions==
[[File:Susnata.jpg|thumb|The Upanayan in [[West Bengal]], India. In Bengali Language it is called 'Paite'.{{cn|date=April 2017}}]]
In Hindu traditions, a human being is born at least twice — once at physical birth and second at intellectual birth through teacher's care. The first is marked through the ''Jatakarman'' sanskara ritual; the second is marked through ''Upanayanam'' or ''Vidyarambha'' rites of passage.&lt;ref name=maryhinduworld&gt;Mary McGee (2007), Samskara, in ''The Hindu World'' (Editors: Mittal and Thursby), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415772273}}, pages 332-356&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kathy Jackson (2005), Rituals and Patterns in Children's Lives, University of Wisconsin Press, {{ISBN|978-0299208301}}, page 46&lt;/ref&gt; A sacred thread was given by the teacher during the initiation to school ceremony and was a symbolic reminder to the student of his purpose at school as well as a social marker of the student as someone who was born a second time ([[dvija]], twice born); he went about collecting fire wood in forest and food donations from villages on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="ref06lidaj"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raman Varadara, Glimpses of Indian Heritage, {{ISBN|978-8171547586}}, page 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Many medieval era texts discuss Upanayana in the context of three ''varnas'' (caste, class) — Brahmins, Kshtreyas and Vaishyas.&lt;ref name=pandeyupan/&gt; Several texts such as ''Sushruta Sutrasthana'', however, also include Sudras entering schools and the formal education process,&lt;ref&gt;RK Mookerji (2011), Ancient Indian Education: Brahmanical and Buddhist, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120804234}}, pages 270-271&lt;/ref&gt; stating that the Upanayana samskara was open to everyone.&lt;ref name=scharfe&gt;Hartmut Scharfe (2007), Handbook of Oriental Studies, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004125568}}, pages 102-103, 197-198, 263-276&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kaneupan2&gt;PV Kane, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofdharmas029210mbp#page/n345/mode/2up Samskara, Chapter VII], History of Dharmasastras, Vol II, Part I, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages 288-300&lt;/ref&gt; The Baudhayana ''Grihya sutra'' in verses 2.5.8 and 2.5.9 states the teacher to "[l]et him initiate [to school through Upanayana] a Brahmin in spring, a Kshatriya in summer, a Vaishya in autumn, a Sudra in the rainy season; or all of them in the spring."{{sfn|Mookerji|1998|p=174}}

The ceremony was typically performed at age eight among the [[Brahmin]]s, at age 11 among the [[Kshatriya]]s, and age 12 among Vaishyas.{{sfn|Mookerji|1998|p=174}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Religious thought and life in India: as based on the Veda and other sacred books of the Hindūs | author=Sir Monier Monier-Williams | publisher=J. Murray, 1891 | page=360 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-jNbAAAAQAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apastamba Gryha Sutra, in verse 1.1.1.27, places a maximum age limit of 24 for the Upanayana ceremony and start of formal education. However, Gautama Gryha Sutra and other ancient texts state that there is no age restriction and anyone of any age can undertake Upanayanam when they feel they initiate their formal studies of the Vedas.&lt;ref&gt;RK Mookerji (2011), Ancient Indian Education: Brahmanical and Buddhist, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120804234}}, pages 174-177&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women and Upanayana===

In some regions, in modern times, boys and girls undergo the tradition of ''Upanayana'' initiation when they start their formal schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Village in Bihar, where Girl wear the Sacred Thread 'Janeu'|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/02/a-village-in-bihar-where-girl-wear-sacred-thread-janeu/|work=IANS |publisher=news.biharprabha.com|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient and medieval eras, texts such as Harita Dharmasutras, Asvalayana Grhya Sutra and Yama smriti suggest women could begin Vedic studies after the Upanayana rite of passage.&lt;ref name=pvkaneyajnow/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=3852 Starting Vedic Studies - Backed by scripture, girls get their sacred thread], ''Hinduism Today'' (December 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C Tripathi (2005), The Evolution of Ideals of Womenhood in Indian Society, {{ISBN|978-8178354255}}, page 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Girls who decided to become a student underwent the Upanayana rite of passage, at the age of 8, and thereafter were called ''Brahmavadini''. They wore a thread or upper garment over their left shoulder.&lt;ref name=pvkaneyajnow/&gt; Those girls who chose not to go to a ''gurukul'' were called ''Sadyovadhu'' (literally, one who marries straight). However, the ''Sadyovadhu'', too, underwent a step during the wedding rituals, where she would complete Upanayana, and thereafter wear her upper garment (saree) over her left shoulder.&lt;ref name=pvkaneyajnow/&gt; This interim symbolic Upanayana rite of passage for a girl, before her wedding, is described in multiple texts such as the Gobhila Gryha Sutra verse 2.1.19 and some Dharmasutras.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/grihyasutrasrule02olde#page/44/mode/2up Grihya sutra of Gobhila] Verse 2.1.19, Herman Oldenberg &amp; Max Muller (Translator), The [[Sacred Books of the East]], Vol. 30, Part 2, Oxford University Press, page 44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doubts about Upanayanam rite of passage in old texts==
Scholars&lt;ref name=herman/&gt; state that the details and restrictions in the Upanayana ceremony is likely to have been inserted into ancient texts in a more modern era. [[Hermann Oldenberg]], for example, states that Upanayana — the solemn reception of the pupil by the teacher to teach him the Veda — is joined into texts of Vedic texts at places that simply do not make any contextual sense, do not match the style, and are likely to be a corruption of the ancient texts.&lt;ref name=herman/&gt; For example, in Satapatha Brahmana, the ''Upanayana'' rite of passage text appears in the middle of a dialogue about Agnihotra; after the Upanayana verse end, sage Saukeya abruptly returns to the Agnihotra and Uddalaka. Oldenberg states that the Upanayana discussion is likely an insertion into the older text.&lt;ref name=herman&gt;Herman Oldenberg, The Gryha Sutra - Rules of Vedic Domestic Ceremonies, Oxford University Press, page 7-8, {{oclc|866776938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars state that there is high likelihood of interpolation, insertion and corruption in dharma sutras and dharma sastra texts, and there are contradictory verses in it on Upanayana-related rites of passage.&lt;ref name=kaneupan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arun Kumbhare (2009), Women of India: Their Status Since the Vedic Times, {{ISBN|978-1440156007}}, page 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J Sinha (2014), Psycho-Social Analysis of the Indian Mindset, Springer Academic, {{ISBN|978-8132218036}}, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; Kane similarly states, in his History of Dharmasastra reviews, that there is high likelihood of interpolation, insertion and corruption in dharma sutras and dharma sastra texts on Upanayana-related rite of passage.&lt;ref name=kaneupan/&gt; [[Patrick Olivelle]] notes the doubts in [[postmodern]] scholarship about the presumed reliability of Manusmriti manuscripts.&lt;ref name=olivellecriticaledition/&gt; He writes, "Manusmriti was the first Indian legal text introduced to the western world through the translation of Sir William Jones in 1794". This was based on the Calcutta manuscript with the commentary of Kulluka, which has been assumed to be the reliable vulgate version, and translated repeatedly from Jones in 1794 to [[Wendy Doniger|Doniger]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=olivellecriticaledition/&gt; The reliability of the Manusmriti manuscript used since colonial times, states Olivelle, is "far from the truth. Indeed, one of the great surprises of my editorial work has been to discover how few of the over fifty manuscripts that I collated actually follow the vulgate in key readings."&lt;ref name=olivellecriticaledition&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2004), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195171464}}, pages 353-354, 356-382&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of the yajñopavītam, sacred thread==
The "sacred thread" ({{lang-sa|यज्ञोपवीतम्}} ''yajñopavītam'' or ''upavīta'') is a thin cord, composed of three cotton strands.&lt;ref name="ref06lidaj"&gt;{{Citation | title=Religious thought and life in India: as based on the Veda and other sacred books of the Hindūs | author=Sir Monier Monier-Williams | publisher=J. Murray, 1891 | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-jNbAAAAQAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strands symbolize different things in their regions. For example, among Tamil Hindus, each strand is for each of the three trinity of goddesses (Parvati, Lakshmi and Saraswati).&lt;ref name="ref91mazij"&gt;{{Citation | title=Festivals of Tamil Nadu: Volume 3 of Peeps into Tamil culture | author=M. Arunachalam | publisher=Gandhi Vidyalayam, 1980 | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3IrXAAAAMAAJ | quote=''... boy is invested for the first time with the sacred thread ... the three devis Sarasvati, Savitri and Gayatri ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Sanskrit texts offer a diverse view while describing yajñopavītam or upavita. The term upavita was originally meant to be any upper garment, as stated in verse 2.2.4.22&amp;ndash;2.2.4.23 of Apastamba [[Dharmasutra]] or, if the wearer doesn't want to wear a top, a thread would suffice.&lt;ref name=pvkaneyajno/&gt; The thread identified a person who is studying at a school or has graduated. The ancient Indian scholar Haradatta states, "''yajñopavītam'' means a particular mode of wearing the upper garment, and it is not necessary to have the yajñopavīta at all times".&lt;ref name=pvkaneyajno/&gt; The Gobhila Gryha Sutra similarly states, at verse 1.2.1 in its discussion on Upanayana, that "the student understands the yajnopavita as a cord of threads, or a garment, or a rope of kusa grass", and it is its methods of wearing and the significance that matters.&lt;ref name=pvkaneyajno/&gt; The proper manner of wearing the upper garment or thread, state the ancient texts, is from over the left shoulder and under the right arm.&lt;ref name=pvkaneyajno&gt;PV Kane, [https://archive.org/stream/HistoryOfDharmasastraancientAndMediaevalReligiousAndCivilLawV.2.1/Kane_A-History-of-Dharmasastra-v2-1_1941#page/n347/mode/2up History of Dharmasastra] Volume 2.1, 1st Edition, pages 290-293&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of wearing the upper garment or sacred thread, and its significance, extended to women.&lt;ref name=pvkaneyajnow/&gt; This is reflected in the traditional wearing of sari over the left shoulder, during formal occasions and the celebration of rites of passage such as Hindu weddings. It was also the norm if a girl undertakes the Upanayana ceremony and begins her Vedic studies as a ''Brahmavadini''.&lt;ref name=pvkaneyajnow&gt;PV Kane, [https://archive.org/stream/HistoryOfDharmasastraancientAndMediaevalReligiousAndCivilLawV.2.1/Kane_A-History-of-Dharmasastra-v2-1_1941#page/n349/mode/2up History of Dharmasastra] Volume 2.1, 1st Edition, pages 293-295&lt;/ref&gt;

The sacred Yajñopavītam is known by many names (varying by region and community), such as ''Bratabandha, Janivaara'', ''Jandhyam'', ''Poita'', ''Pūṇūl'', ''Janeu'', ''Lagun'', ''Yajnopavita'', ''Yagyopavit'', ''Yonya'' and ''Zunnar''.&lt;ref name="ref97cafup"&gt;{{Citation | title=Death before dying: the Sufi poems of Sultan Bahu | author=Sultān Bāhū, Jamal J. Elias | publisher=University of California Press, 1998 | isbn=978-0-520-21242-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GlECx1j0B4IC | quote=''... in Punjabi, zunnar, the sacred Yajñopavītam worn by Brahmin Hindus ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref34quyaq"&gt;{{Citation | title=Living faiths in modern India | author=Shashi Ahluwalia, Meenakshi Ahluwalia | publisher=Indian Publishers&amp;#39; Distributors, 1992 | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hqTXAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other Sanskrit term for it is ''Avyanga''.

===Vedic or medieval tradition?===
There is no mention of any rule or custom, states [[Patrick Olivelle]], that "required Brahmins to wear a sacred string at all times", in the Brahmanical literature (Vedic and ancient post-Vedic).&lt;ref name=patrickoilvelletsu9&gt;Patrick Olivelle (1992), The Samnyasa Upanisads, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195070453}}, pages 9-10&lt;/ref&gt; Yajñopavītam, textual evidence suggests, is a medieval and modern tradition.&lt;ref name=patrickoilvelletsu9/&gt; However, the term ''Yajñopavīta'' appears in ancient Hindu literature, and therein it means a way of wearing the upper garment during a ritual or rites of passage.&lt;ref name=patrickoilvelletsu9/&gt; The custom of wearing a string is a late development in Hinduism, was optional in the medieval era, and the ancient Indian texts do not mention this ritual for any class or for ''Upanayana''.&lt;ref name=pvkaneyajno/&gt;&lt;ref name=patrickoilvelletsu9/&gt;

''Yajñopavīta'' contrasts with ''Pracinavita'' method of wearing the upper garment, the latter a reverse and mirror image of former, and suggested to signify rituals for elders/ancestors (for example, funeral).&lt;ref name=patrickoilvelletsu9/&gt;

==Regional variations==

===Nepal===
[[File:Upanayana krish.jpg|thumb|x216px|right|text|At Upanayana ceremony of [[People of Nepal|Nepalis]]]]
In Nepal a slightly different ceremony is held which combines 'चूड़ाकर्म' (choodakarma) (tonsure, shave the head) and Upanayana [[Sanskara (rite of passage)|saṃskāra]] locally known as ''Bratabandha'' ([[Sanskrit]] ''brata'' = promise, ''bandhan'' = to be bound) It is held among the Bhramin and Kshytreya hill communities in [[Nepal]]. This Sanskara (rite of passage) involves elaborate  Karma Kanda which involves the participation of entire family and  a ''[[guru]]'' (teacher) who then accepts the boy as a disciple in the [[Guru–shishya tradition]] of Hinduism. This marks as an individual's entrance to a school of [[Hinduism]].This ceremony ends after the boy goes for his first alms round to relatives and leave for gurus Ashram.
Traditionally these boys were sent to ''[[ashrams]]'' with the gurus to learn in a [[gurukul]] system of education but in modern times this act of the boy doing for first alms round in town and leaving his family for gurus hermitage is done symbolically within the family and is later stopped by his maternal uncle (Mama) from leaving.&lt;ref name="Shore"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shore |first=Amanda |title=Miss |url=http://intravelmag.com/intravel/indigenous/hindu-bratabandha-ceremony-nepal|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
The ceremony is called ''Munja'' / Munji or ''Mounji-Bandhana'' (lit. 'tying of munja') in the states of [[Maharashtra]] &amp; [[Karnataka]]. This name finds its origin in the name of a grass called [[Saccharum]] munja (Bengal cane&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantnames.unimelb.edu.au/Sorting/Saccharum.html#bengalense Bengal Cane]&lt;/ref&gt;). This grass is used to make a girdle that is tied around the waist of the child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindunet.com/forum/showflat.php?Cat=&amp;Number=9946&amp;Main=9946 Upanayana]&lt;/ref&gt;. In Bengal, the girdle of munja grass is called "Mekhala". In Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and in several areas of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the sacred thread is known as the "Janoi",  "Janeva" or "Janeu".

'''Shri Uttaradi Matha''' (also ''Uttaradi Mutt or Uttaradi Math'') [ [[IAST]]: ''Śrī Uttarādi Maṭha''] is a [[Dvaita]] [[matha]]  (a monastic religious establishment) based in southern [[India]] and has great history. It is one of the original seats of Jagad-guru Śrī [[Madhvacharya|Madhvācārya]] and thus belongs to the [[Madhva Sampradaya|Madhva Sampradāya]].

==Origin==
As per authoritative Dvaita scripture ''"The Supreme God also wanted to bless the souls with divine knowledge, by which they can attain salvation. For this purpose, the Supreme God — Śrī Nārāyana Himself incarnated as Śrī Hamsa and adorned the pontifical seat called the Hamsa-Pīṭha."''

The complete list of [[pontiff]]s ('''Peetādhipathi's''' / '''ācāryas''') who had taken the seat of this math is as below:&lt;ref&gt;Sūrya Siddhānta Pañcāṅgam (astrological almanac) of Śrīmad Uttarādi Maṭha, 2010-2011 AD&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uttaradimath.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=94 Uttaradi Math - Parampara]&lt;/ref&gt;
This list represents the authorized ''guru-paramparā'' (disciplic succession) of Śrī Uttaradi Math till date (2010-2011 AD).

==Mission==

Its chief mission is to practice, protect, preach and propagate the ancient Vedic dharma (''sanātana dharma''). Since the time of its origin, till date, Uttharadi Math has been and continuing to be the strong advocate of the true Vedic dharma. The Math is very much committed in extending service to mankind in all spheres of life like medical care, education, disaster, calamities, wars etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uttaradimath.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=57&amp;Itemid=93 Uttaradi Math - Mission]&lt;/ref&gt;

The current ''pīṭādhipati'' or the acharya holding the pontifical seat is His Holiness [[Satyatma Tirtha|Śrī Satyātma Tīrtha Swāmīji]] (officially known as Śrī 1008 Śrī Satyātma Tīrtha Śrīpādaṅgaḷavaru)

This math is predominantly present in [[Karnataka]] and has many followers in southern [[India]] and few in the north too.

Currently this math has 3-4 Vidyapeethas prominent being Shri Jayateertha Vidyapeetha, Bangalore and S Shri Satyadhyana Vidyapeetha in Mumbai (Old Hindu Style Gurukuls) with boarding facilities where in students stay and continue their study in Vedas and Madhwa Shastras. Nearly 200 students are being rigorously trained here in various branches of knowledge like Grammar, Linguistics, Logic, Mimamsa, Sankhya, Yoga, Veda, Jyotisha, Advaita, Vishistadvaita and Dvaita systems. The students are also trained in Modern Philosophies.

Shri Jayateertha Vidyapeetha, Bangalore: Sudha Visharada Sri Guttal Rangacharya is the Kulapati and Vidwan Sri Satyadhyanacharya Katti is the administrator.
Shri Satyadhyana Vidyapeetha, Mumbai: Vidwan Shri Vidyaasimhacharya Maahuli is the Kulapati &amp; administrator.

Curriculum:
The uniqueness of this institution is that its students are specially trained under the guidance of Shri 1008 Shri Satyatma Teertha Swamiji for 12 years with initial 9 years of training at the Jayateertha Vidyapeetha Residential Campus where they attain mastery over Kavya, Vyakarana, Sahitya, Vedas, Sankshya, Yoga, Jaina, Bauddha, Shakta, Advaita, Vishistadvaita and Dvaita Philosophies under the guidance of Kulapati Sudha Visharada Vidwan Guttala Rangacharya., Principal Vidwan Satyadhyanacharya and several other experienced Adhyapakas.

During the last 3 years of the course, the students are given extensive classes in Shriman Nyaya Sudha, Tatparya Chandrika, Tarkatandava etc., on tour directly by the learned Swamiji, thus giving the student an opportunity to expand his knowledge base by way of  getting exposed, at an early age, to the scholarly world, with opportunity to meet several esteemed scholars and conducting debates and discussions with them in esteemed centers of learning across the entire country like Kashi, Prayag, Delhi, Pune, Rajahmundry etc.

Graduation
After successfully completing the 12 year course, the students are awarded the title "Sudha Vidwan" in a grand convocation function called the "Sudha Mangala", held at various prime centers of learning. To make themselves eligible for the title the students have to present a paper orally before distinguished scholars and also take an oral exam in Shriman Nyaya Sudha, the magnum opus of Dvaita Philosophy. The candidate is tested for all round skills and then declared to be eligible for the title by a jury of scholars headed by His Holiness.

The '''Vatican leaks scandal''' is a scandal initially involving leaked [[Holy See|Vatican]] documents, exposing alleged [[corruption]]; in addition, an internal Vatican investigation purportedly uncovered the [[blackmail]]ing of [[Homosexuality and Roman Catholic priests|homosexual clergy]] by individuals outside the Church. Italian journalist [[Gianluigi Nuzzi]] published letters from Archbishop [[Carlo Maria Viganò]], in which he begged not to be transferred for having exposed alleged corruption that cost the [[Holy See]] millions in higher contract prices.  The name "VatiLeaks" is a [[pun|play on]] the word ''[[WikiLeaks]]'', a not-for-profit media organisation whose goal is to bring important news and information to the public.

Over the following months the situation widened as documents were leaked to Italian journalists, uncovering power struggles inside the Vatican over its efforts to show greater financial transparency and comply with international norms to fight [[money laundering]]. In early 2012, an anonymous letter made the headlines for its warning of a death threat against [[Pope Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref name="independent1"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/vatileaks-hunt-is-on-to-find-vatican-moles-7794193.html| title=Vatileaks: Hunt is on to find Vatican moles|publisher=The Independent|date=28 May 2012|accessdate=29 May 2012|location=London|first=Michael|last=Day}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal escalated in May 2012 when Nuzzi published a book entitled ''[[His Holiness: The Secret Papers of Benedict XVI]]'' consisting of confidential letters and memos between Pope Benedict and his personal secretary, a controversial book that portrays the Vatican as a hotbed of jealousy, intrigue and underhanded factional fighting.&lt;ref name="Squires"&gt;{{cite news|last=Squires|first=Nick|title=Vatican newspaper editor accused of gay smear against rival|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/9284994/Vatican-newspaper-editor-accused-of-gay-smear-against-rival.html|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=6 October 2012|location=London|date=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book reveals details about the Pope's personal finances, and includes tales of bribes made to procure an audience with him.

==Leaks==
The scandal first came to light in late January 2012 in a television program aired in Italy under the name of ''The Untouchables'' (''Gli intoccabili''),&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivereigh, Austen]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=TMkbCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA343&amp;dq=vatican+leaks+scandal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCTgUahUKEwiXpb-kmorJAhXIbSYKHbmSDLE#v=onepage&amp;q=vatican%20leaks%20scandal&amp;f=false Macmillan, ''The Great Reformer'', 2014] {{ISBN|9781627791571}}&lt;/ref&gt; and escalated in May 2012 when [[Gianluigi Nuzzi]] published a book entitled ''[[His Holiness: The Secret Papers of Benedict XVI]]'' consisting of confidential letters and memos.&lt;ref name="Squires"/&gt;

Among the documents were letters written to the pope and to the Secretary of State, Cardinal [[Tarcisio Bertone]], by then [[Apostolic Nunciature to the United States|apostolic nuncio to the United States]], Italian Archbishop [[Carlo Maria Viganò]], complaining of corruption in [[Vatican finances]] and a campaign of defamation against him. Viganò, formerly the second ranked Vatican administrator to the [[pope]], [[Carlo Maria Viganò#Secretary General of the Vatican City Governatorate|begged not to be transferred]] for having exposed alleged corruption that cost the [[Holy See]] millions in higher contract prices.

An anonymous document described a conversation with Cardinal [[Paolo Romeo]] of Palermo, Sicily, in which he allegedly predicted the pope would be dead within 12 months. According to Allen none of the information leaked seem "especially fatal". "It's not so much the content of the leaks, but the fact of them, which is the real problem".&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;[http://ncronline.org/blogs/all-things-catholic/five-questions-about-vaticans-leaks-scandal "Five questions about the Vatican's leaks scandal"], [[Allen Jr., John L.]], ''[[National Catholic Reporter]]'', 17 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vatican internal investigation==
The Vatican probe into the leaks worked along several tracks, with Vatican magistrates pursuing the criminal investigation and the [[cardinal secretary of state|Vatican secretariat of state]] an administrative probe. In March 2012 Pope Benedict appointed a [[council|commission]] of cardinals to investigate the leaks. The three cardinals appointed by Benedict acted in a supervisory role, looking beyond the narrow criminal scope of the leaks to interview broadly across the Vatican bureaucracy; they purportedly uncovered a sexual and blackmail scandal.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt; They reported directly to the pope, and could both share information with Vatican prosecutors and receive information from them, according to Vatican spokesman the [[Federico Lombardi|Rev. Federico Lombardi]]. The group was headed by [[Julián Herranz Casado|Cardinal Julian Herranz]], an [[Opus Dei]] prelate who headed the Vatican's legal office as well as the disciplinary commission of the Vatican bureaucracy before retiring.&lt;ref name="foxnews1"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/05/28/reports-italian-cardinal-linked-to-scandal273614/|title=Pope's butler vows to help Vatican scandal probe|publisher=foxnews.com|date=28 May 2012|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest of Paolo Gabriele==
Paolo Gabriele, who had been the pope's personal butler since 2007, leaked the stolen information to [[Gianluigi Nuzzi]]. He was arrested on 23 May 2012 after confidential letters and documents addressed to the pope and other Vatican officials were found in his Vatican apartment. The arrest was made by [[Vatican police]], who claimed to have found classified documents in his apartment that Gabriele shared with his wife and three children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/5913526/vatican-documents-leak-the-butler-did-it|title=Vatican Documents Leak: The Butler Did It |publisher=Gawker|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar documents had been published in Italian media over the previous five months; many of them dealt with allegations of corruption, abuse of power and a lack of financial transparency at the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2012/papal-butler-s-lawyers-say-client-acted-out-of-love-for-church-pope.cfm|title=Papal butler's lawyers say client acted out of love for church, pope|website=www.catholicnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Papal response==
On 30 May 2012, Pope Benedict made his first direct comments on the scandal in remarks at the end of his weekly general audience. The Pope said the "exaggerated" and "gratuitous" rumours had offered a false image of the Holy See, commenting "The events of recent days about the Curia and my collaborators have brought sadness in my heart...I want to renew my trust in and encouragement of my closest collaborators and all those who every day, with loyalty and a spirit of sacrifice and in silence, help me fulfill my ministry."&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hlIIJlaZhzmXG9T60ztbm9_nQcZw?docId=a75547d274094085aa0892c3c238d083 |title=The Associated Press: Pope breaks silence over Vatileaks scandal |publisher=Google |accessdate=19 May 2012 |date=30 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604001859/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hlIIJlaZhzmXG9T60ztbm9_nQcZw?docId=a75547d274094085aa0892c3c238d083 |archivedate=4 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July, Pope Benedict held a meeting of the commission of cardinals. Included in attendance, were the head of the Vatican police, those judges involved in the case, and representatives of the Vatican secretariat of state, according to a report from Federico Lombardi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2012/pope-hosts-top-level-meeting-on-leaks-in-vatican.cfm|title=Pope hosts top-level meeting on leaks in Vatican|website=www.catholicnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial of Paolo Gabriele and papal pardon==

Piero Antonio Bonnet, the Vatican's judge, had been instructed to examine the evidence of the case and to decide whether there is sufficient material to proceed to trial. Gabriele faced a maximum sentence of 8 years for the illegal possession of documents of a head of state.&lt;ref&gt;Messia, Hada (CNN). {{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/06/world/europe/vatican-leaks-trial/ |title=Verdict Expected in 'Vatileaks' Trial of Pope's Ex-butler |publisher= CNN.com |date= 6 October 2012|accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paolo Gabriele was indicted by Vatican magistrates on 13 August 2012 for aggravated theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2012/vatican-magistrates-order-trial-for-papal-assistant-accused-of-theft.cfm|title=Vatican magistrates order trial for papal assistant accused of theft|last=Wooden|first=Cindy|date=13 August 2012|publisher=Catholic New Service|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first hearing took place on 29 September 2012.

Gabriele's trial began on 2 October 2012.&lt;ref name=nsquires&gt;{{cite news|last=Squires|first=Nick|title=Trial of Pope's butler Paolo Gabriele begins as he's accused of leaking Vatican secrets |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/9575729/Trial-of-Popes-butler-Paolo-Gabriele-begins-as-hes-accused-of-leaking-Vatican-secrets.html |accessdate=7 October 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph |date=29 September 2012|location=Vatican City}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed to have stolen the documents to fight "evil and corruption" and put the Vatican "back on track".&lt;ref name=nsquires/&gt; Multiple evaluations of Gabriele's mental health provided conflicting results: concluding in one report that, Gabriele suffered from a "fragile personality with paranoid tendencies covering profound personal insecurity"; yet another report found that Gabriele showed no adequate signs of a major psychological disorder nor posing any serious threat to himself or others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pope-butler-gabriele-idUSBRE88R0EV20120928|title=Paolo Gabriele, the papal butler who fell from grace|date=28 September 2012|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vatican police seized encrypted documents and confidential papers that the Pope had marked "to be destroyed" when they raided the apartment of his butler, the court heard.&lt;ref name=ttel31012&gt;{{cite news |last=Squires|first=Nick |title=Vatileaks: Butler 'stole papers Pope wanted destroyed' |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/9583810/Vatileaks-Butler-stole-papers-Pope-wanted-destroyed.html |accessdate=7 October 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=3 October 2012|location=Vatican City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 October, Paolo Gabriele was found to be guilty of theft, and was sentenced to a reduced sentence of 18 months. Gabriele was also ordered to pay legal expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=WINFIELD|first=NICOLE|title=POPE'S BUTLER CONVICTED IN LEAKS, Given 18 Months|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/popes-butler-awaits-verdict-papal-leaks-trial|publisher=AP|accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2012/10/06/lombardi:_papal_pardon_for_former_butler_possible/en1-627547|title=Vatican Radio Vatican Radio|website=en.radiovaticana.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gabriele served his sentence in the Vatican itself, as opposed to the usual arrangement of sending prisoners to serve time in an Italian prison due to concerns that he might leak further secrets.&lt;ref name="BBCVaticanPrisoner26Oct"&gt;{{cite news|last=Willey|first=David|title=Who, what, why: What's it like to be a prisoner of the Vatican?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20093538|publisher=BBC|accessdate=26 October 2012|date=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabriele was personally visited and [[pardoned]] by Benedict XVI on 22 December 2012.&lt;ref name="BBCPopePardon22Dec"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pope Benedict pardons former butler Paolo Gabriele|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20824814|accessdate=22 December 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.va/en/news/papal-visit-and-christmas-pardon-for-paolo-gabriel|title=NEWS.VA: Papal visit and Christmas pardon for Paolo Gabriele}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claudio Sciarpelletti, a computer specialist at the Secretariat of State who allegedly helped Gabriele, was convicted of obstruction of justice based on conflicting information he gave to prosecutors. He was sentenced to four months, which was amended to two months suspended with five years probation due to his long years of service and lack of a criminal record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-20200038|title=Pope butler's 'helper' Claudio Sciarpelletti on trial|date=5 November 2012|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath of the investigation==
One of the reasons listed for the dismissal of [[Ettore Gotti Tedeschi]] as head of the Vatican bank was the "Failure to provide any formal explanation for the dissemination of documents last known to be in the president's possession."&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2115967,00.html Faris, Stephan. "The Vatican Scandals: What Did the Pope's Butler Know?", ''Time'', 29 May 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 December 2012 the Pope received a report on "Vatican lobbies" prepared by cardinals [[Julián Herranz]], [[Salvatore De Giorgi]], a former archbishop of Palermo, and [[Jozef Tomko]]. Vatican spokesman [[Federico Lombardi]], speaking on Vatican Radio on 23 February 2013, strongly criticized media coverage&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/21/pope-retired-amid-gay-bishop-blackmail-inquiry | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=John | last=Hooper | title=Papal resignation linked to inquiry into 'Vatican gay officials', says paper | date=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sesso e carriera, i ricatti in Vaticano dietro la rinuncia di Benedetto XVI|url = http://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2013/02/21/news/ricatti_vaticano-53080655/?ref=HREC1-4|website = La Repubblica|accessdate = 2016-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/23/vatican-gay-scandal_n_2748470.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Paul | last=Raushenbush | title=Vatican Slams Media Reports Of Gay Scandal As 'Gossip, Misinformation And Slander' | date=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a financial scandal which purportedly became, upon the cardinals' internal investigation, a gay sex and blackmail scandal as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Papal Conclave Accompanied by Reports of Scandals and Intrigue|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/world/europe/shadows-accompany-gathering-to-pick-pope.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2013-02-23|access-date = 2016-01-01|issn = 0362-4331|first = Rachel|last = Donadio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the dossier was available only to Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and the investigators themselves, the latter were free to discuss the results of their investigation with the Cardinal electors of the [[Papal conclave, 2013|March 2013 papal conclave]], and the dossier itself was to have been given to Benedict's successor as Pope, [[Pope Francis|Francis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/02/results-of-vatileaks-probe-for-popes-eyes-only/|title=Vatican Dossier for 'Pope's Eyes Only'|first=ABC|last=News|website=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March 2013, Lombardi reported that "two or three phones" had been [[Telephone tapping|tapped]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/01/vatican-wiretap-vatileaks_n_2792956.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Meredith | last=Bennettsmith | title=Vatican Admits To Possible Wiretaps Of Church Officials | date=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-pope-goodbye-20130301,0,2904382.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first1=Henry | last1=Chu | first2=Tom | last2=Kington | title=Pope Benedict XVI leaves the Vatican | date=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 June 2013 it was reported that leaked notes of a private conversation between Pope Francis and Catholic officials at the Latin American Conference of Religious (CLAR) confirmed the existence of "a stream of corruption", and that "The '[[gay]] lobby' is mentioned, and it is true, it is there … We need to see what we can do". According to [[La Repubblica]] "Vatican investigators had identified a network of gay prelates".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Style and substance|url = https://www.economist.com/news/international/21582553-pope-wows-brazil-battlesand-trapslie-home-style-and-substance|newspaper = The Economist|access-date = 2016-01-01|issn = 0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi made no comment on the remarks made in "a private meeting".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pope Francis 'admits that gay prelate network exists'|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/12/reports-pope-gay-prelate-network|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2016-01-01|first = Lizzy Davies in|last = Rome}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2016, the Vatican court acquitted the two journalists involved in the Vatileaks trial, citing freedom of expression as its reason. Judge Giuseppe Della Torre, head of the tribunal of the Vatican City State declared that "the court had no legitimate jurisdiction over Gianluigi Nuzzi and Emiliano Fittipald."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/citing-freedom-press-vatican-court-acquits-journalists-vatileaks-trial|title=Citing freedom of press, Vatican court acquits journalists in 'VatiLeaks' trial|date=7 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Msgr Lucio Balda, by contrast, was sentenced to 18 months in prison, and his sentence began on August 22 in a cell within the confines of the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americamagazine.org/issue/monsignor-behind-vatican-document-leak-begins-jail-time|title=The 18-month prison sentence begins for man behind "Vatileaks"|date=30 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Requests for a papal pardon for Msgr Balda have, so far, been met with silence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=29624|title=No reply from Pope to ‘Vatileaks’ convict’s appeal for pardon : News Headlines|website=www.catholicculture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vivekananda Vidyapith''' Academy of Indian Philosophy and Culture is a [[Sanskrit]] school in [[Wayne, New Jersey]].

Vivekananda Vidyapith takes its philosophical inspiration from [[Swami Vivekananda]], a nineteenth and early twentieth-century teacher and explorer of [[Vedanta]], or Indian philosophy. The Vidyapith’s closest sister organization is the '''[[Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center]]''' in [[New York City]].

==History==

In 1976, Dr. Mahendra Jani was studying for his doctoral degree at [[CUNY]], and his wife, Dr. Vandana Jani was teaching at [[Kean College]]. They lived in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], and regularly attended services and classes held by Swami Adiswarananda at the [[Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center]] in New York. During that time, they held prayers and scripture-study classes with a few families on Saturday evenings in friends' houses in Jersey City. Soon, the need arose to occupy the children of the families, including their son, during these sessions.

Mrs. Jani took the children to a separate room and engaged them in instructional activities. At the end of the classes, children presented what they had learned. After a couple of weeks, both Vandana and Mahendra Jani decided to hold separate classes for children on Saturday mornings and provide them with a "character building education." Both of them prepared a curriculum, and in September, 1976, started classes for children on Saturdays, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. in their one-bedroom-apartment in Elizabeth. There were seven children on the first day.

Soon more and more adults valued the opportunity to bring their children for instruction, and the idea for an ongoing cultural educational program for children started. After one year the Janis moved to [[Jersey City]], where the majority of students who were attending the program resided. In 1979, the Janis rented a large [[basement apartment]] in order to facilitate more children. They incorporated the Vivekananda Vidyapith that same year. When the owner of the house sold the property, the Janis were forced to move to a house in [[Woodland Park, New Jersey]].

As participant families continued to grow in number, the corporation started to look for a facility to house the Vidyapith in 1988. After a two-year search, they found the current house, situated on approximately one acre of land in [[Wayne, NJ]]. They rented the facility for one year during 1990, but it was not until they received proper zoning as a “house of worship” that they could begin using the facility for classes in 1991. The Board of the Vidyapith purchased the property in 1991.

In 2000, they built a two-story addition on the facility, with classrooms on the first floor and a prayer hall on the second floor. The hall seats approximately 200 people. There is currently an enrollment cap of approximately 200 students, and there is also a waiting list for next year’s program. The Vidyapith has a mailing list of 1200 families, and the average attendance on the two weekend morning sessions totals approximately 350 people, mostly children. There are evening classes for adults during the week.

==Activities and Schedule==
An average weekend session begins with group prayer in the prayer hall, including the singing of [[aarti]] and the recitation of [[prayers]]. This also includes a long talk by Dr. Mahendra Jani, followed by a felicitation of children who are celebrating birthdays, and a welcome to young [[alumni]] of the program who come to visit. Besides the educational programs on weekends, the Vidyapith celebrates the major Indian religious festivals with special celebrations. Christmas and Buddha’s birthday are also celebrated. Also, every year, the Vidyapith celebrates its founding with a large cultural program, including dance, music, and dramas. Students’ speech competitions are held every year. These larger programs are held in local public school auditoriums such as the Diwali Function. In 2001, the Vidyapith celebrated its 25th anniversary, and celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2006 with a special alumni reunion, where over 100 alumni and their families reunited from the class of 1976 to the present.

==Philosophy==
The Vivekananda Vidyapith is a volunteer, [[non-profit organization]]. The Board of Directors consists of eleven people who meet two to three times a year. The organization emphasizes the teachings of Swami Vivekananda, and strives to teach proper values and character building.

Although religious in nature, the instruction emphasizes what Dr. Jani refers to as the science of character development. The focus is on the inner spiritual search expounded by [[Vedanta]], but not on rituals or dogma. The philosophy is meant to be inclusive and encourages students to serve society around them.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

"'''Who is a Jew?'''" ({{lang-he-n|מיהו יהודי}} {{IPA-he|ˈmihu jehuˈdi|pron}}) is a basic question about [[Jewish identity]] and considerations of Jewish [[self-identification]]. The question is based on ideas about [[Jewish]] personhood, which have [[Jewish culture|cultural]], [[Jewish ethnic divisions|ethnic]], [[Judaism|religious]], [[political]], [[genealogy|genealogical]], and [[family|personal]] dimensions. [[Orthodox Judaism]] and [[Conservative Judaism]] follow Jewish law ([[Halakha]]), deeming a person to be Jewish if their [[Matrilineality in Judaism|mother]] is Jewish or they underwent a halakhic [[conversion to Judaism#Halakhic_considerations|conversion]]. [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] accept both [[matrilineal]] and [[patrilineal]] descent. [[Karaite Judaism]] predominantly follows patrilineal descent.

Jewish identity is also commonly defined through [[Jewish ethnic divisions|ethnicity]]. Opinion polls have suggested that the majority of Jews see being Jewish as predominantly a matter of ancestry and culture, rather than religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/16/a-closer-look-at-jewish-identity-in-israel-and-the-u-s/|title=A closer look at Jewish identity in Israel and the U.S.|date=March 16, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Poll-Many-Israelis-see-Jewish-identity-as-being-self-defined-375551|title=Poll: Many Israelis see Jewish identity as being self-defined|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional interpretation and variations==

The definition of who is a Jew varies according to whether it is being considered by Jews on the basis of religious law and tradition or self-identification, or by non-Jews for other reasons, sometimes for prejudicial purposes. Because Jewish identity can include characteristics of an [[ethnicity]],&lt;ref name="Jews-are-ethnoreligious-group"&gt;

According to the simplest definition used by most Jews for self-identification, a person is a Jew by birth, or becomes one through religious conversion. However, there are differences in interpretations when it comes to non-[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Jewish religious movements|Jewish denominations]] in the application of this definition, including

* Should a person with only one Jewish parent be considered Jewish?
* Which conversion processes should be considered valid?
* Can one remain a Jew after converting to another religion? 
* How does being unaware of having Jewish parents affect one's Jewish status?
* How is Jewish identity determined in different countries throughout the Jewish Diaspora?
* How is the claim to Israeli citizenship adjudicated in the context of the [[Basic Laws of Israel]]?

==Tannaitic Judaism==
According to the [[Mishnah]], the first written source for [[halakha]], the status of the offspring of mixed marriages was determined matrilineally.

According to historian [[Shaye J. D. Cohen]], in the Bible, the status of the offspring of mixed marriages was determined patrilineally. He brings two likely explanations for the change in Mishnaic times: first, the Mishnah may have been applying the same logic to mixed marriages as it had applied to other mixtures (''kilayim''). Thus, a mixed marriage is forbidden as is the union of a horse and a donkey, and in both unions the offspring are judged matrilineally. Second, the [[Tannaim]] may have been influenced by Roman law, which dictated that when a parent could not contract a legal marriage, [[Mater semper certa est|offspring would follow the mother]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Shaye J.D. Cohen |year=1999 |title=The Beginnings of Jewishness |publisher=U. California Press |pages=305–306 |isbn=0-585-24643-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vX8moleho2kC&amp;q=%22bible+a+mixed%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22bible%20a%20mixed%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However Leviticus 24:11, Ezra 9-10, and Nehemiah 13 seem to indicate that matrilineal descent was recognized and patrilineal descent was rejected in Biblical times as well.

==Contemporary Judaism==
All [[Jewish religious movements]] agree that a person may be a Jew either by birth or through conversion. According to ''[[halakha]],'' a Jew by birth must be born to a Jewish mother. ''Halakha'' states that the acceptance of the principles and practices of Judaism does not make a person a Jew. However, those born Jewish do not lose that status because they cease to be observant Jews, even if they adopt the practices of another religion.&lt;ref name=about.com-jewish&gt;{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Lisa|title=Am I Jewish?|url=http://judaism.about.com/od/whoisajew/a/amijewish.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism, as movements which reject the concept of ''halakha'', often accept a child as Jewish even if only the father is Jewish and if the child chooses to identify as Jewish.&lt;ref name=Judaism101-who-is-a-jew/&gt; As the various denominations of Judaism differ on their conversion processes, conversions performed by more liberal denominations are not accepted by those that are less so.&lt;ref name=Judaism101-who-is-a-jew&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Is a Jew?|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/whoisjew.htm|publisher=Judaism101|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish by birth===

According to ''halakha'', to determine a person's Jewish status (Hebrew: ''yuhasin'') one needs to consider the status of both parents. If both parents are Jewish, their child will also be considered Jewish, and the child takes the status of the father (e.g., as a [[kohen]]). If either parent is subject to a genealogical disability (e.g., is a [[mamzer]]) then the child is also subject to that disability. If one of the parents is not Jewish, the rule is that the child takes the status of the mother ([[Nashim|Kiddushin]] 68b, [[Shulchan Aruch]], EH 4:19).&lt;ref name = "AsktheRabbi"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling is derived from various sources including {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|7:1–5|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Leviticus|24:10|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Ezra|10:2–3|HE}}.&lt;ref name = "AsktheRabbi" /&gt; Accordingly, if the mother is Jewish, so is her child, and if she is not Jewish, neither is her child considered Jewish. In [[Orthodox Judaism]] the child of a non-Jewish mother can be considered Jewish only by a process of [[conversion to Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/whojew1.html |title=Who Is A Jew? |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The child is also freed from any disabilities and special status to which the father may have been subject (e.g., being a [[mamzer]] or [[kohen]]) under Jewish law.&lt;ref&gt;''The Principles of Jewish Law,'' Ed. [[Menachem Elon]], p. 429m {{ISBN|0-7065-1415-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] branches of Judaism maintain that the halakhic rules (i.e. matrilineal descent) are valid and binding. [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Liberal Judaism (United Kingdom)|Liberal Judaism]] do not accept the halakhic rules as binding, and most branches accept a child of one Jewish parent, whether father or mother, as Jewish if the parents raise the child as a Jew and foster a Jewish identity in the child, noting that "in the Bible the line always followed the father, including the cases of [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]] and [[Moses]], who married into non-Israelite priestly families."&lt;ref name=JVL&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/patrilineal.html ''Patrilineal Descent'', Jewish Virtual Library], . Retrieved September 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; (However, according to the oral tradition of Orthodox Judaism, the spouses of both Joseph and Moses converted to Judaism prior to marrying them.) The Reform movement's standard states that "for those beyond childhood claiming Jewish identity, other public acts or declarations may be added or substituted after consultation with their rabbi".&lt;ref&gt;"Reform Movement's Resolution on Patrilineal Descent, The Status of Children of Mixed Marriages" from the final text of the ''Report of the Committee on Patrilineal Descent'' adopted on March 15, 1983, Central Conference of American Rabbis&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of patrilineal descent point to {{bibleverse||Genesis|48:15–20|HE}} and {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|10:15|HE}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishjustice.com/torah.html ''Fighting for Patrilineal Descent'', Jewish Justice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531085900/http://www.jewishjustice.com/torah.html |date=May 31, 2009 }}, . Retrieved September 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy is commonly known as [[patrilineal descent]], though "bilineal" would be more accurate.

===Patrilineal descent===

In 1983, the Reform Central Conference of American Rabbis passed the Resolution on Patrilineal Descent, declaring that "the child of one Jewish parent is under the presumption of Jewish descent. This presumption of the status of the offspring of any mixed marriage is to be established through appropriate and timely public and formal acts of identification with the Jewish faith and people... Depending on circumstances, mitzvot leading toward a positive and exclusive Jewish identity will include entry into the covenant, acquisition of a Hebrew name, Torah study, Bar/Bat Mitzvah, and Kabbalat Torah (Confirmation). For those beyond childhood claiming Jewish identity, other public acts or declarations may be added or substituted after consultation with their rabbi."&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Living: A Guide to Reform Contemporary Practice'' by Rabbi Mark Washofsky (URJ Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Mark Washofsky summarizes the 1983 CCAR resolution and subsequent interpretations in Reform responsa literature as follows:

* "The resolution is advisory rather than halachic in the traditional sense. It does not establish a new definition of Jewish identity, for its preamble states expressly that it means to be operative only for Reform Jews in North America, not for all Jews everywhere."
* "Jewish descent may be from either parent....The Reform Movement presumes the child of ''one'' Jewish parent, either mother or father, as Jewish. In fact, the 1983 resolution is in one significant respect more stringent than the traditional definition of Jewish status. The child of a Jewish mother and gentile father, whom halachah regards as clearly Jewish, enjoys but a ''presumption'' of Jewish status that must be "established" by "appropriate and timely public and formal acts of identification."
* "Biology remains a crucial factor. In the determination of Jewish identity...the child of ''two gentile'' parents is, as before, definitely a non-Jew and must undergo a formal conversion in order to become a Jew."
* "Both descent and behavior are crucial in determining Jewish status under the resolution. The Jewish status of a child of an intermarriage cannot be determined "automatically" either by biology or behavior. Both elements—descent from one Jewish parent ''and'' the performance of mitzvot that lead to a "positive and exclusive Jewish identity—must be present, and they must be present during childhood."
* "The resolution applies only to children raised exclusively as Jews....A child raised simultaneously in Judaism and another religious tradition does not develop a "positive and exclusive" Jewish identity; therefore the presumption of Jewish status is disproved, and the resolution does not apply to that child. He or she will require conversion prior to observing bar or bat mitzvah in the synagogue."&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Living: A Guide to Reform Contemporary Practice'', Rabbi Mark Washofsky (URJ Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Waiving the need for formal conversion for anyone with at least one Jewish parent who has made affirmative acts of Jewish identity was a departure from the traditional position requiring formal [[conversion to Judaism]] for children without a [[matrilineal descent|Jewish mother]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/patrilineal1.html|title=Reform Movement's Resolution on Patrilineal Descent (March 1983)|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CCAR's 1983 resolution has had a mixed reception in Reform Jewish communities outside the United States. Most notably, the [[Israel Movement for Progressive Judaism]] has rejected patrilineal descent and requires formal conversion for anyone not born of a Jewish mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=ijITI2PHKoG&amp;b=840313&amp;ct=1051515|title=The Establishment of Reform Judaism in Israel|publisher=American Jewish Committee|access-date=July 26, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304114546/http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=ijITI2PHKoG&amp;b=840313&amp;ct=1051515|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karaite Judaism]] believes that Jewish identity can only be transmitted by patrilineal descent. They argue that only patrilineal descent can transmit Jewish identity on the grounds that all descent in the Torah went according to the male line, basing this idea "on the fact that, in the Bible, [[Tribes of Israel#Origin|tribes]] are given male names and that biblical characters are always referenced by their fathers' names.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;p.154, Levinson, David (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of World Cultures Vol 9 : Africa and the Middle East'', G. K. Hall &amp; Co., Boston, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; However, a minority of modern Karaites believe that Jewish identity requires that both parents be Jewish, and not only the father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karaite-korner.org/karaite_faq.shtml|title=Karaite FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions About Karaism|publisher=karaite-korner.org|access-date=July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The divergence of views has become an issue because Orthodox and Conservative communities do not recognize a person as Jewish if only their father is Jewish.&lt;ref name=Judaism101-who-is-a-jew/&gt; For the person to be accepted as Jewish by an Orthodox or Conservative community (for example, on an occasion of their bar/bat mitzvah or marriage), they require a formal conversion (in accordance with halakhic standards). Orthodox Judaism has a predominant position in Israel. Although Orthodox and Conservative Judaism do not recognize Jewishness through patrilineal descent, "it should also be noted, however, that in the case of a child born to a Jewish father but to a non-Jewish mother, most Orthodox rabbis will relax the stringent demands normally made of would-be converts",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/patrilineal.html|title=Patrilineal Descent|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|access-date=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Rabbinical Assembly of the Conservative movement "agreed that 'sincere Jews by choice' should be warmly welcomed into the community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/od/whoisajew/a/whoisjewdescent.htm|title=Who is a Jew via Descent|author=Lisa Katz|work=About|access-date=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Converts to Judaism===

{{Main article|Conversion to Judaism}}

All mainstream forms of Judaism today are open to sincere converts, with most subgroups accepting converts by the process accepted within the group. Not all conversions are recognised by all varieties of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sJlGeE9D2JIC&amp;q=%22increase+in+the+number%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22increase%20in%20the%20number%22&amp;f=false|title=Conversion to Judaism|publisher=|access-date=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Rabbinic Judaism]], the laws of conversion are based on [[Jewish law|the classical sources of Jewish law]], especially discussions in the [[Talmud]], and the law as codified in the [[Shulkhan Arukh]].&lt;ref&gt;Ben Rafael, Eliezer, ''Jewish identities: fifty intellectuals answer [[David Ben-Gurion|Ben Gurion]]'', p.210&lt;/ref&gt; This corpus of traditional [[Jewish law]] (halakha) is regarded as authoritative by the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]]&lt;ref name="Alon"&gt;{{cite book

Shulchan Aruch translates as "set table," thereby symbolically stating that the Jewish law has finally be set and settled in a clear code. (The authoritative code of Jewish law is the Shulchan Aruch along with glosses on the Shulchan Aruch added by Moshe Isserles (c. 1525–1572), also called Rama or Remu, that present legal opinions omitted by Karo, especially opinions specific to the Ashkenazic (German and Eastern European) Jewish customs. The glosses are called the "table cloth" to the "set table" of the Shulchan Aruch. The two together still form the definitive codification of Jewish law. 3 ELON at 1359–1365.)

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional halakhic requirements for conversion are instruction in the commandments, [[circumcision]] (if male), and immersion in [[mikveh|an acceptable body of water]] before valid witnesses, and acceptance of the commandments before a [[beit din|rabbinical court]]. If a male is already circumcised, a drop of blood is drawn from the penis.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Isaac. ''A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice.'' The Jewish Theological Seminary, 1979. p. 442-443&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthodox [[posek|authorities]] require that conversions be performed in accord with traditional Jewish law and recognise only those conversions in which a convert accepts and undertakes to observe Jewish law as interpreted by Orthodox [[rabbi]]s. Because rabbis in the other movements do not require that converts make this commitment, Orthodox authorities do not generally accept as valid conversions performed outside the Orthodox community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judaismconversion.org/|title=Conversion to Judaism - Jewish Converting|publisher=judaismconversion.org|accessdate=July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative authorities likewise require that conversions be conducted according to traditional Jewish law. Conducting a conversion absent the traditional requirements of immersion in a [[mikveh|ritual bath]] and circumcision for males is a violation of a Standard of the [[Rabbinical Assembly]] and grounds for expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/sites/default/files/public/halakhah/teshuvot/2011-2020/JewishIdentity6.2011.pdf|title="Proving Jewish Identity"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative authorities generally recognize any conversion done in accord with the requirements of Jewish law, even if done outside the Conservative movement. Accordingly, Conservative rabbis may accept the validity of some conversions from other non-Orthodox movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/20012004/16.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051228082854/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/20012004/16.pdf |archivedate=2005-12-28 |title=The Status of Non-Halakhic Conversions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/20012004/17.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628202448/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/20012004/17.pdf |archivedate=2006-06-28 |title=Should the Kashrut of Conversions be Investigated?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Union for Reform Judaism]] states that "people considering conversion are expected to study Jewish theology, rituals, history, culture and customs, and to begin incorporating Jewish practices into their lives. The length and format of the course of study will vary from rabbi to rabbi and community to community, though most now require a course in basic Judaism and individual study with a rabbi, as well as attendance at services and participation in home practice and synagogue life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templeisrael-ne.org/_kd/Items/actions.cfm?action=Show&amp;item_id=1036&amp;destination=ShowItem|title=www.templeisrael-ne.org|accessdate=January 6, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112210602/http://www.templeisrael-ne.org/_kd/Items/actions.cfm?action=Show&amp;item_id=1036&amp;destination=ShowItem|archivedate=January 12, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] recommends that three rabbis be present for the conversion ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.ccarnet.org/glgerim7.html "Guidelines for Rabbis Working with Prospective Gerim"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721041142/http://data.ccarnet.org/glgerim7.html |date=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rabbinical Court of the [[Israel Movement for Progressive Judaism]] requires an average of a year of study to become conversant in Jewish life and tradition. Following this, converts are required to immerse in a ritual bath, be circumcised if male, and accept the commandments before the rabbinical court.&lt;ref&gt;Zemer, Moshe. ''Evolving Halakha''. Jewish Lights Publishing, 1999. pp. 137–138&lt;/ref&gt;

Although an infant conversion might be accepted in some circumstances (such as in the case of adopted children or children whose parents convert), children who convert would typically be asked if they want to remain Jewish after reaching religious adulthood – which is 12 years of age for a girl and 13 for a boy, as required by Jewish law.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, George.

[[Karaite Judaism]] does not accept the oral legal traditions of Rabbinic Judaism. It has different requirements for conversion, and refrained from accepting any converts until recently.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Traditionally non-proselytizing, on August 1, 2007, the Karaites reportedly converted their first new members in 500 years. At a ceremony in their Northern California synagogue, ten adults and four minors swore fealty to Judaism after completing a year of study. This conversion came 15 years after the Karaite Council of Sages reversed its centuries-old ban on accepting converts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/103393.html Karaites hold first conversion in 500 years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011151023/http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/103393.html |date=October 11, 2008 }}.

[[Syrian Jews|Syrian Jewish communities]] do not normally carry out conversions, particularly where the conversion is suspected of being for the sake of marriage. Nor do they accept such converts from other communities, or the children of mixed marriages or marriages involving such converts.&lt;ref&gt;Although no scientific studies have been completed in regard to the Syrian-Jewish intermarriage rate, anecdotal evidence suggests that the Syrian community's current rate of intermarriage with non-Jews is between 2 and 3%. The National Jewish Population Survey study cited by Gordon and Horowitz {{cite web|url=http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/WillYourGrandchildrenBeJews.htm |title=Will Your Grandchildren Be Jewish |accessdate=2008-02-19 |author=Antony Gordon and Richard Horowitz}} gives intermarriage rates for Centrist and Hasidic Jews of 3% for those between the ages of 18-39 and 6% overall, as compared with 32% for Conservative Jews, 46% for Reform Jews and 49% for secular Jews. Gordon and Horowitz suggest that the main reason for the difference is the growing commitment to Jewish Day School education: "The combination of Jewish commitment and having experienced a complete K-12 Orthodox Jewish Day School education results in an intermarriage rate of not greater than 3%." This suggests that Jewish day schools, rather than the edict, are the decisive factor in discouraging intermarriage.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jews who have practiced another religion===

In general, [[Orthodox Judaism]] considers individuals born of Jewish mothers to be Jewish, even if they convert to or are raised in another religion.&lt;ref name="katz" /&gt; [[Reform Judaism]] views Jews who convert to or are raised in another religion as non-Jews. For example "...anyone who claims that Jesus is their [[Salvation|savior]] is no longer a Jew..." [Contemporary American Reform Responsa, #68].&lt;ref name="faqs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/judaism/FAQ/10-Reform/section-15.html|title=Question 18.3.4: Reform's Position On...What is unacceptable practice?|date=July 17, 2008|publisher=FAQs.org|accessdate=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcrelations.net/en/?item=961|title=What about Christian Jews or Jewish Christians?|last=Voll|first=Fritz|work=Jewish-Christian Relations|publisher=International Council of Christians and Jews|accessdate=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatjewsbelieve.org/explanation09.html|title=Jews believe that "Jews for Jesus," "Messianic Jews," and "Hebrew Christians" are no longer Jews, even if they were once Jews|last=Federow|first=Stuart |year=2003|publisher=What Jews Believe.org|accessdate=July 17, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080628192736/http://www.whatjewsbelieve.org/explanation09.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = June 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, a Jew who has been declared to be a [[heresy|heretic]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: ''[[Minuth|min]],'' מין) or Christian (Hebrew: ''[[Nazarene (title)|notzri]],'' נוצרי, meaning "Nazarene") may have had a ''[[Herem (censure)|cherem]]'' (similar to [[excommunication]]) placed on him or her; but the practice of communal and religious exclusion does not affect their status of Jewish birth.&lt;ref name="leavesoffaith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lichtenstein|first=Aharon |title=Leaves of Faith: Selected Essays of Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein|publisher=KTAV Publishing House, Inc.|date=March 2004|isbn=0-88125-668-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_QshqTu9nGIC&amp;pg=PA369&amp;lpg=PA369&amp;dq=Leaves+of+Faith:+Selected+Essays+of+Rabbi+Aharon+Lichtenstein|accessdate=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism also views as Jewish those who involuntarily convert from Judaism to another religion ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: ''[[anusim]],'' אנוסים, meaning "forced ones"), and their matrilineal descendants are likewise considered to be Jewish.

Judaism has a category for those who are Jewish but who do not practice or who do not accept the tenets of Judaism, whether or not they have converted to another religion. The traditional view regarding these individuals, known as [[Meshumad]]im ({{lang-he|משומדים}}), is that they are Jewish; however, there is much debate in the rabbinic literature regarding their status vis-a-vis the application of Jewish law and their participation in Jewish ritual,&lt;ref name="leavesoffaith" /&gt; but not to their status as Jews.

A Jew who leaves Judaism is free to return to the religion at any time. In general, no formal ceremony or declaration is required to return to Jewish practices. All [[Jewish denominations|movements of Judaism]] welcome the return to Judaism of those who have left, or been raised in another religion. When returning to Judaism, these individuals would be expected to abandon their previous practices and adopt Jewish customs.

The same rules in principle apply to the matrilineal descendants of such persons, though some rabbinical authorities may require stricter proof of Jewish descent than others. Whether such persons are required to undergo a full formal conversion depends on the community and their individual circumstances. For example, a male who has had a [[brit milah]], who has a general understanding of Judaism, but who has been raised in a secular home might not be required to undergo ritual conversion. However, a male who has not had a brit milah, a male or female who has converted to or been brought up in another religion, or an individual raised in a completely secular home without any Jewish education, in most communities, may be required to undergo a full ritual conversion. For full participation in the community (for example, to marry with the participation of a rabbi), they may be required to display sincerity, such as a declaration of commitment to Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zelizer|first=Gerald L.|date=June 14, 1995|title=The Return of Second Generation Apostates|journal=YD|publisher=The Rabbinical Assembly|volume=268|issue=12|pages=146–50|url=http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/sites/default/files/public/halakhah/teshuvot/19912000/zelizer_apostates.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of the issues involved is the case of converts to Judaism who cease to practice Judaism (whether or not they still regard themselves as Jewish), do not accept or follow halakha, or now adhere to another religion. Technically, such a person remains Jewish, like all Jews, provided that the original conversion is valid. However, in some recent cases, [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] [[Posek|rabbinical authorities]], as well as the current [[Religious Zionism|Religious Zionist]] [[Israel]]i [[Chief Rabbi]]nate, have taken the view that a given convert's lapse from Orthodox Jewish observance is evidence that he or she cannot, even at the time of the conversion, have had the full intention to observe the commandments, and that the conversion must therefore have been invalid.

A valid Jewish court of sufficient stature has the ability to revoke a person's or a group's status as Jews. This was done for the [[lost Ten Tribes]] of Israel&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, Yebamoth 16b)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Samaritans]].&lt;ref&gt;Pirke De-Rabbi Elieze, chapter 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious definitions==

===Halakhic perspective===

According to the traditional Rabbinic view, which is maintained by all branches of [[Orthodox Judaism]] and [[Conservative Judaism]], and some branches of [[Reform Judaism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reform Judaism - Halachah|url=http://www.reformjudaism.org.uk/a-to-z-of-reform-judaism/contemporary-issues/halachah.html|accessdate=8 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104221109/http://www.reformjudaism.org.uk/a-to-z-of-reform-judaism/contemporary-issues/halachah.html|archivedate=November 4, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; only ''[[Jewish law|halakha]]'' can define who is or is not a Jew when a question of Jewish identity, lineage, or parentage arises about any person seeking to define themselves or claim that they are Jewish.

As a result, mere ''belief'' in the principles of Judaism does ''not'' make one a Jew. Similarly, non-adherence by a Jew to the [[613 Mitzvot]], or even formal conversion to another religion, does not make one lose one's Jewish status. Thus, the immediate descendants of all female Jews (even [[apostate]]s) are still considered to be Jews, as are those of all their female descendants. Even those descendants who are not aware they are Jews, or practice a religion other than Judaism, are defined by this perspective as Jews, as long as they come from an unbroken female line of descent. As a corollary, the children of a Jewish father and a non-Jewish mother are not considered to be Jews by Halakha unless they formally convert according to Halakha, even if raised fully observant in the Mitzvot.&lt;ref&gt;Angel, Marc, ''Choosing to be Jewish: the Orthodox road to conversion'', pp.114–117&lt;/ref&gt;

Those not born to a Jewish mother may become accepted as Jews by the Orthodox and Conservative communities through a formal process of [[conversion to Judaism]] in order to become "righteous converts" (''{{lang|he-Latn|Gerei Tzedek}}''—{{lang-he|גרי צדק}}). In addition, Halakha requires that the new convert commit himself to observance of its tenets; this is called ''{{lang|he-Latn|Kabbalat Ol Mitzvot}}'' ({{lang-he|קבלת עול מצוות}}), "Acceptance of the Yoke of the Commandments". ''{{lang|he-Latn|Kabbalat mitzvot}}'' ({{lang-he|קבלת מצוות}}) is used by [[Reform Judaism]] in accordance with reform responsa and Halakhah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.ccarnet.org/glgerim7.html |title=Guidelines for Rabbis Working with Prospective gerim |quote=Prior to completing the process of ''giur'', a rabbi should require that each prospective ''ger/gioret'' make commitments within each of the following areas.

Both [[Haredi Judaism]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] accept a similar set of rules regarding Jewish status based on classical rabbinic Judaism, including both matrilineal descent and requirements that conversions be performed by Orthodox rabbis and that converts promise to strictly observe elements of traditional Judaism such as [[Shabbat]] and [[Niddah]]. However, their application of these rules have been different, and the difference has been increasing in recent years. Modern Orthodox authorities have been more inclined to rule in favor of Jewish status and to accept non-Orthodox Jews' word in doubtful cases involving people claiming to be Jews, while Haredi authorities have in recent years tended to presume non-Jewish status and require more stringent rules and standards of evidence in order for Jewish status to be proven, and have tended to distrust the evidence of Jews who are not personally Orthodox. Haredi rabbis have tended to look at a convert's current personal observance and to regard deficiencies or lack of Orthodoxy in current observance as evidence that the convert never intended to validly convert. In addition, the contemporary situation is further complicated by the fact that some Haredi rabbis no longer regard some Modern Orthodox rabbis as reliable.&lt;ref name="The Forward"&gt;{{cite news|title=

===Karaite Judaism===

Unlike the denominations of Rabbinical Judaism, [[Karaite Judaism]] maintains that it is the responsibility of each Jew to study the ''[[Tanakh]]'' for themselves. The [[Talmud]] and [[Oral Law]] are not considered canonical, and rabbinical opinions are not considered authoritative either, but every interpretation is held up to the same scrutiny, regardless of its source. Karaite Judaism relies on the Tanakh to indicate that Jewishness is passed down through the paternal line, not the maternal line as is maintained by Orthodox Judaism (though a minority hold that both parents need to be Jewish). Karaite Jews are eligible for [[Aliyah]] under the [[Law of Return]]. The eligibility of converts to Judaism through the Karaite movement to make Aliyah under the Law of Return has not yet been addressed in Israeli courts.&lt;ref&gt;Yaron, Y., Joe Pessah, and Abraham Qanai. An Introduction to Karaite Judaism: History, Theology, Practice, and Culture. N.p.: Qirqisani Center, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform Judaism===

Reform Judaism recognizes a child as being Jewish if either parent is Jewish and the child is being raised Jewish. Voices within the Reform movement say that the law, which changed to matriarchal around 2,000 years ago (originally in the Torah  the offspring was determined by patriarchal descent) and was based on the tragic circumstances the Jewish people were facing - was once helpful but is no longer relevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Troderman | first=Joshua | title=Halacha Unplugged, Part 1 – The Bris: Which Parent Makes a Child Jewish? | website=InterfaithFamily | date=2016-01-12 | url=https://interfaithfamily.com/blog/iff/halacha-unplugged-part-1-the-bris-which-parent-makes-a-child-jewish/ | access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Progressive Jewish denominations have a conversion process based on their [[Columbus Platform|principles]]. In the US, an official Reform resolution in 1893 abolished circumcision as a requirement for converts,&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Michael "''Berit Mila'' within the History of the Reform Movement" in Barth, Lewis (1990) ''Berit Mila'' in the Reform Context. New York: Berit Milah Board of reform Judaism&lt;/ref&gt; and Reform does not require converts to have ''tevilah,'' ritual immersion. A "prospective convert declares, orally and in writing, in the presence of a rabbi and no less than two lay leaders of the congregation and community, acceptance of the Jewish religion and the intention to live in accordance with its ''mitzvot''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/reform_practices.html|title=The Tenets of Reform Judaism|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Controversies====
The controversy in determining "who is a Jew" concerns four basic issues:

One issue arises because North American [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and UK [[Liberal Judaism (UK)|Liberal]] movements have changed some of the halakhic requirements for a Jewish identity in two ways:

:A. Children born of just one Jewish parent – regardless of whether the father or mother is Jewish – can claim a Jewish identity. A child of only one Jewish parent who does not claim this identity has, in the eyes of the Reform movement, forfeited his/her Jewish identity. By contrast, the halakhic view is that any child born to a Jewish mother is Jewish, whether or not he/she is raised Jewish, or even whether the mother considers herself Jewish. As an example, the children of [[Madeleine Albright]] (who was raised Catholic and was unaware of her Jewish heritage) would all be Jewish according to halakha, since their mother's traceable female ancestors were all Jewish and all three of her children were female. However, this is not the belief of progressive Judaism, which  views Jews who convert to or are raised in another religion as non-Jews.

:B. The requirement of ''[[brit milah]]'' has been relaxed, as has the requirement of ritual immersion. (While the Conservative movement permits conversion without circumcision in some cases, most Orthodox Jews do not,&lt;ref name="chabad.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Is a convert who is a hemophiliac required to have a circumcision? |author=Menachem Posner |publisher=Chabad.org |url=http://www.chabad.org/476233}}&lt;/ref&gt; except in cases specifically exempted by the [[Talmud]], such as one who has had three brothers die as a result of circumcision; Jewish children who are [[hemophilia]]cs are exempt from circumcision.&lt;ref name="chabad.org"/&gt;)

Secondly, [[Orthodox Judaism]] asserts that non-Orthodox [[rabbi]]s are not qualified to form a ''[[beit din]].''&lt;ref name="How do you prove you're a Jew"/&gt; This has led to non-Orthodox conversions generally being unaccepted in Orthodox communities. Since [[Orthodox Judaism]] maintains the traditional standards for conversion – in which the commitment to observe halakha is required – non-Orthodox conversions are generally not accepted in Orthodox communities because the non-Orthodox movements perform conversions in which the new convert does not undertake to observe halakha as understood by Orthodox Judaism.

A third controversy concerns persons (whether born Jews or converts to Judaism) who have converted to another religion. The traditional view is such persons remain Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culteducation.com/reference/jews_for_jesus/jews_for_jesus8.html|title=Efforts to convert Jews draw fire from interdenominational group|website=www.culteducation.com|access-date=September 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104185118/http://www.culteducation.com/reference/jews_for_jesus/jews_for_jesus8.html|archive-date=November 4, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milechai.com/judaism/jewish-people.html|title=Jewish People - Define|accessdate=January 6, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230222942/http://www.milechai.com/judaism/jewish-people.html|archivedate=December 30, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reform Judaism]] regards such people as apostates,&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.ccarnet.org/cgi-bin/respdisp.pl?file=13&amp;year=5753 Apostate in the Synagogue] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929175340/http://data.ccarnet.org/cgi-bin/respdisp.pl?file=13&amp;year=5753 |date=September 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.ccarnet.org/cgi-bin/respdisp.pl?file=71&amp;year=arr |title=American Reform Responsa : 71.

We can not do so as they consider Jesus of Nazareth as the Messiah who has fulfilled the Messianic promises. In this way, they have clearly placed themselves within Christianity. They may be somewhat different from other Christians as they follow various Jewish rites and ceremonials, but that does not make them Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Contemporary American Reform Responsa : 67. Burial of "Messianic Jews" |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YbKqlxCZdsC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ps5-RkzeIf&amp;sig=oIilDwQP-iYfhAULqcane4m0YdI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdg-aBoprYAhVoKsAKHRziBjkQ6AEINDAF#v=onepage }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, such people do not count as Jewish for the purposes of the Israeli citizenship laws.

A fourth controversy stems from the manner in which the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] has been handling marriage and conversion decisions in recent years. Conversions and marriages within Israel are legally controlled by the Orthodox Israeli Chief Rabbinate; therefore, a person not proven to be a Jew to the Rabbinate's satisfaction is not legally permitted to marry a Jew in Israel today. Although the Rabbinate has always refused to accept non-Orthodox conversions, until recent years it was more willing to accept the Jewish parentage of applicants based on personal testimony, and the validity of conversions based on the testimony of Orthodox Rabbis. However, in recent years the rabbinate, whose rabbis historically had a more [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] orientation, has increasingly been filled by the more stringent [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] camp. It has increasingly been inclined to presume that applicants are not Jewish until proven otherwise, and require more stringent standards of proof than in the past. It has implemented a policy of refusing to accept the testimony of non-Orthodox Jews in matters of Jewish status, on grounds that such testimony is not reliable. It also has been increasingly skeptical of the reliability of Orthodox rabbis ordained by institutions not subject to its accreditation, particularly in matters of conversion. Accordingly, non-Orthodox Jews born to Jewish parents, and some Jews converted by Orthodox rabbis, have been increasingly unable to prove their Jewishness to the Rabbinate's satisfaction, because they are unable to find an Orthodox rabbi who is both acceptable to the Rabbinate, and familiar with and willing to vouch for the Jewishness of their maternal lineage or the validity of their conversion.&lt;ref name="The Forward" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The New York Times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="How do you prove you're a Jew"/&gt;

There have been several attempts to convene representatives of the three major movements to formulate a practical solution to this issue. To date, these have failed, though all parties concede the importance of the issue is greater than any sense of rivalry among them.

==Ethnic definitions==
&lt;!-- The term "Ethnic Jew" redirects here. --&gt;
{{Anchor|Ethnic and cultural perspectives}}
{{Refimprove|date=February 2008}}
{{See also|Secular Jewish culture}}

[[Ethnic group|Ethnic]] Jew is a term generally used to describe a person of Jewish parentage and background who does not necessarily actively practice Judaism, but still identifies with Judaism or other Jews culturally or fraternally, or both. The term "ethnic Jew" does not specifically exclude practicing Jews, but they are usually simply referred to as "Jews" without the qualifying adjective "ethnic".{{efn|See [[Ethnic group]].}}

The term can refer to people of diverse beliefs and backgrounds because [[genealogy]] largely defines who is "Jewish". "Ethnic Jew" is sometimes used to distinguish non-practicing from practicing (religious) Jews. Other terms include "non-observant Jew", "non-religious Jew", "non-practicing Jew", and "secular Jew".

The term may also refer to Jews who do not practice the religion of Judaism. Typically, ethnic Jews are cognizant of their Jewish background, and may feel strong cultural (even if not religious) ties to Jewish traditions and to the Jewish people or nation. Like people of any other ethnicity, non-religious ethnic [[Jewish assimilation|Jews often assimilate]] into a surrounding non-Jewish culture, but, especially in areas where there is a strong local Jewish culture, they may remain largely part of that culture instead.

"Ethnic Jews" include [[Jewish atheism|atheists]], agnostics, non-denominational [[deism|deists]], Jews with only casual connections to [[Jewish denominations]] or converts to other religions, such as Christianity, [[Buddhism]], or Islam. Religious Jews of all denominations sometimes engage in outreach to non-religious ethnic Jews. In the case of some [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] denominations (e.g. [[Chabad-Lubavitch]]), this outreach extends to actively proselytizing more secular Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/9689/ |title=Knesset Mulls Ban on Proselytizing |author=Orly Halpern |date=December 22, 2006 |work=The Jewish Daily Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor=3773993 |journal=Ethnology |volume=44 |number=2 |date=Spring 2005 |pages=125–145 |author=Andrew Buckser |title=Chabad In Copenhagen: Fundamentalism And Modernity In Jewish Denmark |doi=10.2307/3773993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0492_0573_ZO.html|title=492 U.S. 573|accessdate=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/13/books/men-in-black.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Men In Black |author=Samuel G.

===Public opinion===
The 2013 Pew Research study of American Jews found that 62% thought that being Jewish was mainly a matter of ancestry and culture, while 15% thought that it was mainly a matter of religion. Of those who stated themselves to be Jews by religion, 55% thought that being Jewish was mainly a matter of ancestry and culture, while two-thirds thought that it was not  necessary to believe in God to be Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/jewish-american-beliefs-attitudes-culture-survey/|title=A Portrait of Jewish Americans|date=October 1, 2013|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project|accessdate=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical European definitions===
The traditional European definition of Jewishness (although it was not uniform across Europe) defined a Jew as one belonging to the "Mosaic faith". That is, a Jew was someone who practiced Judaism.&lt;ref name = "denick2005"&gt;{{cite article|first=Lars|last=Denick|year=2005|title=Jewishness in Postmodernity: The Case of Sweden|page=25|publisher=Rappaport Center for Assimilation Research and Strengthening Jewish Vitality|url=http://archive.jpr.org.uk/object-swe3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition gradually changed in the beginning of the 20th century due to the emergence of racial ideology.

The European definition is traditional in many respects, and reflects not only how the Europeans saw Jews, but also how Jews saw themselves.

In the former [[Soviet Union]], "Jewish" was a nationality by law, as with other nationalities such as Russians, Ukrainians, Georgians and others. There were certain restrictions on their civil liberties in the early years of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Decter|first1=Moshe|title=The Status of the Jews in the Soviet Union|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/23494/moshe-decter/the-status-of-the-jews-in-the-soviet-union|publisher=The Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=21 April 2015|date=January 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genealogy===
The modern [[genealogical DNA test]] of ethnicity is certainly a non-religious definition of 'who is a Jew?' as increasing numbers of persons discover their biological and cultural origins outside the traditional religious setting.&lt;ref&gt;Vence, Tracy. (July 10, 2014) "DNA Ancestry for All". The Scientist. Retrieved 4 July 2015. [http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/40460/title/DNA-Ancestry-for-All/ The Scientist website]&lt;/ref&gt; The top two Jewish haplogroups for the priestly families, [[Haplogroup J-M267]] and [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)]] have genetic origins in the vast [[Arabian Peninsula]], Egypt, the [[Horn of Africa]], and the [[Levant]], which indicates a more complex cultural genesis and potential identity.

==="Half-Jewish"===
In the United States and Europe, because of [[interfaith marriage|intermarriage]], the population of "half-Jews" is beginning to rival that of Jews with two Jewish parents. Self-identified "half-Jews" consider the term a familial category, which reflects multiple heritages and possible Jewish cultural or spiritual practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.half-jewish.net/|title=The HalfJewish Network: Welcoming Adult Children &amp; Grandchildren of Intermarriage|work=The Half-Jewish Network: Welcoming Adult Children &amp; Grandchildren of Intermarriage|accessdate=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.half-jewish.org/who_is_born_a_jew.shtml|title=Beta-Gershom.org|accessdate=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=klein&gt;Daniel Klein and Freke Vuijst, ''The Half-Jewish Book: A Celebration'', New York: Villard Books, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar terms that have been used include: "part-Jewish" and "partial-Jews". The term "Gershom", "Gershomi" or "Beta Gershom" has also been used as an alternative to "half-Jewish" and "part-Jewish" in connection with descendants of intermarriage, [[Gershom]] being the son of Moses and his [[Midian]]ite wife [[Zipporah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.half-jewish.org/Beta_Gershom.shtml|title=Beta-Gershom.org|accessdate=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term typically has no religious meaning, as terms like [[Jewish Christians|Jewish Christian]] do, but rather describes ethnic Jewry.

==Other non-religious definitions==

The [[Society for Humanistic Judaism]] defines a Jew as "someone who identifies with the history, culture and fate of the Jewish people." In their view it is therefore possible for a non-religious individual to adopt Judaism and join a Humanistic Jewish community, and for the Society for Humanistic Judaism to adopt the person wanting to be part of the Humanistic Jewish family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SHJ Philosophy|url=http://www.shj.org/mission.htm|accessdate=8 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813073051/http://www.shj.org/mission.htm|archivedate=August 13, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Israeli author [[Amos Oz]] puts it, "a Jew is anyone who chooses or is compelled to share a common fate with other Jews."&lt;ref name="Auron2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yair Auron|title=Israeli Identities: Jews and Arabs Facing the Self and the Other|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZGmF--NN5ZYC&amp;pg=PA25|year=2012|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-0-85745-305-1|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oz summed up his position more succinctly in a monologue published in ''[[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]]'', saying "Who is a Jew?

==Legal structure in Israel==
Israel has no single document called a [[constitution]] (the [[Basic Laws of Israel]] function as an [[uncodified constitution]]); however, the definition of "who is a Jew" has become an important issue in [[Politics of Israel|Israeli politics]] due to the involvement of religious parties in the [[Knesset]].&lt;!--I don't know what the introductory clause has to do with the rest of the sentence, and would rather just remove it, but at least it is more accurate now, and doesn't make Israel sound legally primitive --AlanM1--&gt;

The issue of who is considered a Jew has given rise to legal controversy in Israel. There have been court cases in Israel since 1962 that have addressed the question.&lt;ref name="Navot, Suzi p.189"&gt;Navot, Suzi, ''Constitutional law of Israel'', p.189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Uzi Rebhun pp.296-297"&gt;Uzi Rebhun, Chaim Isaac Waxman, ''Jews in Israel: contemporary social and cultural patterns'', pp.296–297&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism test===

{{As of|2010}}, anyone who immigrated to Israel after 1990 and wishes to marry or divorce via the Jewish tradition within the state limits must go through a "Judaism test"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judaism Test Guidelines|url=http://www.rabanut.gov.il/vf/ib_items/80/hanhayotyehadut.pdf|publisher=Israeli Rabbanut|accessdate=2012-06-24|location=Israel|language=Hebrew|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; at an Orthodox [[Beth din|Rabbinical court]]. In this test, a person would need to prove their claim to be Jewish to an investigator beyond a reasonable doubt. They would need to present original documentation of their [[Matrilineality|matriline]] up to their great-grandmother (4 generations),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=(unknown title)|url=http://www.rbc.gov.il/forms/docs/by.doc|publisher=Rabbinical Court, State of Israel|accessdate=2012-06-24|language=Hebrew|format=MSWord doc}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in the case of [[Ethiopian Jews]], 7 generations back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=(unknown title)|url=http://www.dat.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/DDA0419D-EDFF-48D6-8E89-9B24450AA00B/0/Ethiopian.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Religious Affairs, State of Israel|accessdate=2012-06-24|location=Israel|page=1|language=Hebrew|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they should provide government documents with nationality/religion shown as Jewish (e.g., birth/death certificates, marriage documents, etc.).

===Law of Return===
{{main|Law of Return}}

Following the birth of the modern State of Israel in 1948, the [[Law of Return]] was enacted in 1950 to give any Jew the right to immigrate to Israel and become a citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Navot, Suzi, ''Constitutional law of Israel'', p.188&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to an inability on the lawmakers to agree, the Law did not define who was a Jew, relying instead on the issue to resolve itself over time. As a result, the Law relied in form on the traditional halakhic definition. But, the absence of a definition of who is a Jew, for the purpose of the Law, has resulted in the divergent views of the various streams of Judaism competing for recognition.

Besides the generally accepted halakhic definition of who is a Jew, the Law extended the categories of person who are entitled to immigration and citizenship to the children and grandchildren of Jews, regardless of their present religious affiliation, and their spouses.&lt;ref&gt;Law of Return, paragraph 4A. This provision does not extend to the spouse of an Israeli Jew (a non-Israeli person who married an Israeli Jew).&lt;/ref&gt; Also, converts to Judaism whose conversion was performed outside the State of Israel, regardless of who performed it, are entitled to immigration under the Law. Once again, issues arose as to whether a conversion performed outside Israel was valid. The variation of the definition in the Law and the definition used by various branches of Judaism has resulted in practical difficulties for many people.

It has been estimated that in the past twenty years about 300,000 avowed non-Jews and even practicing Christians have entered Israel from the former [[Soviet Union]] on the basis of being a child or grandchild of a Jew or by being married to a Jew.&lt;ref name=rosenblum&gt;Jonathan Rosenblum, [http://www.jr.co.il/articles/mixedm.txt "Our New Mixed Multitude"], Jacob Richman Home Page. Retrieved March 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there was an exception in the case of a person who had formally converted to another religion derived from the ''[[Oswald Rufeisen#Life|Rufeisen]] Case'' in 1962.&lt;ref name="Navot, Suzi p.189"/&gt; Such a person, no matter what their halakhic position, was not entitled to immigration under the Law. This created a divergence between the Israeli state's interpretation of Jewishness and that of halakha. In the 1970 Shalit case the Israeli Supreme Court ruled in favour of a family which sought to register children born in Israel from a Scottish mother as Jewish by nationality,&lt;ref name="Navot, Suzi p.189"/&gt; but the 1972 amendment to the Population Registry Law prevented their third child being registered as Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/israel/conversion/testing-principles.asp|title=The Conversion Crisis: Testing the Principles|accessdate=January 6, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025133946/http://www.adl.org/Israel/Conversion/testing-principles.asp|archivedate=October 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current Israeli definitions specifically exclude Jews who have openly and knowingly converted to or were raised in a faith other than Judaism, including [[Messianic Judaism]]. This definition is not the same as that in traditional Jewish law; in some respects it is deliberately wider, so as to include those non-Jewish relatives of Jews who may have been perceived to be Jewish, and thus faced [[antisemitism]].

The Law of Return does not, of itself, define the Jewish status of a person; it only deals with those who have a right of immigration to Israel.

In the early 1950s, the [[Israel]]i [[Chief Rabbinate]] originally objected to the immigration of [[Karaite Jew]]s to Israel, and unsuccessfully tried to obstruct it. In 2007 Rabbi David Chayim Chelouche, the chief rabbi of Netanya, was quoted in the Jerusalem Post as saying: "A Karaite is a Jew. We accept them as Jews and every one of them who wishes to come back [to mainstream Judaism] we accept back. There was once a question about whether Karaites needed to undergo a token circumcision in order to switch to rabbinic Judaism, but the rabbinate agrees that today that is not necessary."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1178708657471&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |author=Joshua Freeman |work=The Jerusalem Post |title=Laying down the (Oral) law |date=May 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israeli laws governing marriage and divorce===
{{See also|Marriage in Israel}}

In relation to [[Marriage in Israel|marriage]], [[Get (divorce document)|divorce]], and burial, which are under the jurisdiction of the [[Ministry of Interior (Israel)|Israeli Interior Ministry]], the halakhic definition of who is a Jew is applied. When there is any doubt, the Israeli Chief Rabbinate generally determines the issue.

In terms of social relations, most secular Jews view their Jewish identity as a matter of culture, heritage, nationality, or ethnicity.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/judaism.htm|title=What Is Judaism?|last=Rich|first=Tracey R.|publisher=Judaism 101|accessdate=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancestral aspects can be explained by the many Jews who [[Jewish atheist|view themselves as atheists]] and are defined by matrilineal descent&lt;ref name="katz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/od/whoisajew/a/whoisjewdescent.htm|title=Who is a Jew?|last=Katz|first=Lisa|work=Judaism|publisher=About.com|accessdate=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aboutatheism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/library/world/AJ/bl_IsraelJudaism.html|title=Judaism in Israel|work=Judaism|publisher=About.com|accessdate=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[Kohen|Cohen (Kohen)]] or [[Levi]], which is connected by ancestry.&lt;ref name="cohenlevi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cohen-levi.org|title=The Tribe|publisher=The Cohen-Levi Family Heritage|accessdate=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question of "who is a Jew" is a question that is under debate.&lt;ref name="weiner"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/whojew1.html|title=Who is a Jew?|last=Weiner|first=Rebecca|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues related to ancestral or ethnic Jews are dealt with by the Israeli Chief Rabbinate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=559669&amp;contrassID=1&amp;subContrassID=5&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y|title=Amar: Bnei Menashe are Descendants of Ancient Israelites|date=January 4, 2005|work=Haaretz|accessdate=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="freund"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1159193360806&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter|title=Right On: A Miracle of Biblical Proportions|last=Freund|first=Michael|date=October 3, 2006|work=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=July 17, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615040438/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1159193360806&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter|archivedate=June 15, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Indian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/bneimenashe.html|title=Chief Rabbi Says Indian Community Descended From Israelites|date=July 20, 2006|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jstandard"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jstandard.com/articles/1101/1/Israel%92s-Chief-Rabbinate-rejects-some-diaspora-Orthodox-conversions|title=Israel's Chief Rabbinate Rejects some Diaspora Orthodox Conversions|last=Tigay|first=Chanan|date=May 26, 2006|publisher=New Jersey Jewish Standard|accessdate=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthodox halachic rules apply to converts who want to marry in Israel. Under these rules, a conversion to Judaism must strictly follow halachic standards to be recognised as valid. The rabbinate even scrutinizes Orthodox conversions, with some who have converted by orthodox authorities outside Israel not being permitted to marry in Israel.&lt;ref name="jstandard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="meyers"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/22872/are-israel-s-marriage-laws-archaic-and-irrelevant/|title=Are Israel's Marriage Laws 'Archaic and Irrelevant'?|last=Meyers|first=Nechemia|date=July 12, 1997|work=Jewish News Weekly|accessdate=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one's ancestral line of Jewishness is in doubt, then a proper conversion would be required in order to be allowed to marry in the Orthodox community, or in Israel, where such rules govern all marriages.

===Israeli definition of nationality===
The Jewish status of a person in Israel is considered a matter of "nationality".

In the registering of "nationality" on [[Israeli identity card]]s, which is administered by the Ministry of the Interior, a person had to meet the Halakhic definition to be registered as a "Jew". However, in a number of cases the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] has ordered the [[Ministry of Interior (Israel)|Ministry of Interior]] to register Reform and Conservative converts as Jews. The right of people who convert in the Diaspora under Reform or Conservative auspices to immigrate to Israel and claim citizenship as Jews, is detailed in Israeli law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://forward.com/articles/136245/ |title=Israeli Government Rejects Orthodox Converts' Bids To Immigrate as Jews |author=Nathan Jeffay |date=March 16, 2011 &lt;!--issue of March 25, 2011--&gt; |work=The Jewish Daily Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently, Israeli identity cards had an indication of nationality, and the field was left empty for those who immigrated not solely on the basis of being Jewish (i.e. as a child, grandchild or spouse of a Jew only) to indicate that the person may not be a Jew. Many Israeli citizens who are not recognised by the Rabbinate as Jewish have been issued with Israeli identity cards that do not include their Hebrew calendar birth date.

===Outside Israel===
In 2010 the Labour Court of South Africa addressed the question of who is a Jew for the purposes of the Employment Equity Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZALC/2010/218.html|title=Lewis v Media 24 Ltd (C88/2007) [2010] ZALC 218; (2010) 31 ILJ 2416 (LC) (4 May 2010)|accessdate=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question has also arisen in the United Kingdom, where religious schools are allowed to select all, or a proportion of their intake based upon religion. A 2009 ruling, ''[[R(E) v Governing Body of JFS]]'', determined that the definition of Jewish religion based upon descent constituted discrimination on ethnic grounds, and therefore contravened racial discrimination laws.

==Other definitions==
There have been other attempts to determine Jewish identity beside the traditional Jewish approaches. These range from [[genetics|genetic]] population studies{{efn|See ''[[Y-chromosomal Aaron]]''}} to controversial evolutionary perspectives including those espoused by [[Kevin B. MacDonald]] and [[Yuri Slezkine]]. Historians, such as the late [[Kamal Salibi]], have utilized [[etymology]] and geography to reconstruct the prehistoric origin of the Jewish people in the [[Arabian Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;Salibi, Kamal S. (1988). Secrets of the Bible People. New York: Interlink Books. p. 75 sqq. {{ISBN|0-940793-16-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology and anthropology===

As with any other ethnic identity, Jewish identity is, to some degree, a matter of either claiming that identity or being perceived by others (both inside and outside the ethnic group) as belonging to that group, or both. Returning again to the example of Madeleine Albright&amp;nbsp;– during her Catholic childhood, her being in some sense Jewish was presumably irrelevant. It was only after she was nominated to be [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] that she, and the public, discovered her Jewish ancestry.

[[Ido Abram]] states that there are five aspects to contemporary Jewish identity:
#Religion, culture, and tradition.
#The tie with Israel and Zionism.
#Dealings with antisemitism, including issues of persecution and survival.
#Personal history and life-experience.
#Relationship with non-Jewish culture and people.&lt;ref name=abram&gt;[http://www.jhm.nl/exhibitions.aspx?ID=110 "What does it mean to be Jewish"], Jewish Historical Museum. Retrieved March 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=voudouris1&gt;Monica Săvulescu Voudouris and Camil Fuchs, ''Jewish identity after the Second World War'', Editura Hasefer, Bucharest, 1999, p. 16. {{ISBN|973-9235-73-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative importance of these factors may vary enormously from place to place. For example, a typical Dutch Jew might describe his or her Jewish identity simply as "I was born Jewish," while a Jew in [[Romania]], where levels of antisemitism are higher, might say, "I consider any form of denying as a proof of cowardice."&lt;ref name=voudouris2&gt;Monica Săvulescu Voudouris and Camil Fuchs (1999), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=June 2013}}

===The Inquisition===
During the time of the [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]]s, conversion to Roman Catholicism did not result in total termination of the person's Jewish status. Legally, the converts were no longer regarded as Jews, and thus allowed to stay in the Iberian Peninsula. During the Inquisition in Spain and [[Portugal]], however, many Jews were forced to convert, but thereafter were regarded by many people, though not in a legal form, as [[New Christian]]s, distinguishing them as separate from the Old Christians of non-Jewish lineage. Since legal, political, religious and social pressure pushed many people to untrue conversions (public behaviour as Christians while retaining some Jewish beliefs and practices privately, a kind of [[crypto-Judaism]]),{{efn|See [[Marrano]] and [[Anusim]]}} they were still treated with suspicion, a stigma sometimes carried for several generations by their identifiable descendants.
The ''[[limpieza de sangre]]'' ("Cleanliness of blood") required public officials or candidates for membership of many organizations to prove that they did not have Jewish or Muslim ancestry.

===Secular philosophy===

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]], who was not Jewish, suggested in ''[[Anti-Semite and Jew]]'' (1948) that Jewish identity "is neither national nor international, neither religious nor ethnic, nor political: it is a quasi-historical community." While Jews as individuals may be in danger from the antisemite who sees only "Jews" and not "people", Sartre argues that the Jewish experience of antisemitism preserves—even creates—the sense of Jewish community. In his most extreme statement of this view he wrote, "It is the anti-Semite who creates the Jew." Conversely, that sense of specific Jewish community may be threatened by the democrat who sees only "the person" and not "the Jew".

[[Hannah Arendt]] repeatedly asserted a principle of claiming Jewish identity in the face of antisemitism. "If one is attacked as a Jew, one must defend oneself as a Jew. Not as a German, not as a world-citizen, not as an upholder of the Rights of Man, or whatever"; "A man attacked as a Jew cannot defend himself as an Englishman or a Frenchman. The world can only conclude from this that he is simply not defending himself at all."

Wade Clark Roof (1976), a sociologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara, proposed that social sectors in [[modernity|modern life]], in which traditional symbols and rituals are meaningful, provide an alternative approach for explaining the social basis of religion in a secular order, in doing so, he turned to the local community as a sphere in modern society that still persists "as a complex system of friendship and kinship networks, formal and informal associations, as well as symbolic attachments, very much rooted in family life and ongoing socialization processes".&lt;ref&gt;Alice Goldstein, "Jews on the move: implications for Jewish identity'", in eds. [[Ivan Kalmar]] &amp; [[Derek Penslar]], ''Orientalism and The Jews'', pp. 4. [[SUNY Press]], 1995 ({{ISBN|0-7914-2747-1}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antisemitic definitions===

The question "who is a Jew?" is also sometimes of importance to non-Jews. It has had exceptional significance historically when considered by anti-Jewish groups for the purpose of targeting Jews for persecution or discrimination. The definition can impact on whether a person may have a certain job, live in certain locations, receive a [[free education]], live or continue to live in the country, be [[prison|imprisoned]], or executed.

====Nazism====

The question was of critical importance during the rule of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi party in Germany]], which persecuted the Jews and defined them for the government's purposes by the [[Nuremberg Laws]]. In 2009, a United Kingdom court considered whether the question was a racial issue, in the case ''[[R(E) v Governing Body of JFS]]'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;Nazi Germany's Nuremberg Laws sources:

The [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime instituted laws discriminating against Jews, declared a race by the Nazis, and thus needed a working definition of who is a Jew as to its law-defined race system. These definitions almost completely categorised persons through the religions followed by each individual's ancestors, according to membership registries. Thus, personal faith or individual observance, as well as the religious definitions of Judaism as given by the [[Halacha]], were mostly ignored.

In Germany itself, the [[Ahnenpass]] and [[Nuremberg Laws]] classified people as being of the Jewish race if they descended from three or four grandparents enrolled in Jewish congregations. A person with one or two grandparents enrolled in a Jewish congregation could be classified as ''[[Mischling]]'',&lt;ref&gt;A Mischling was called ''Mischling of first degree'', or colloquially half-Jew, if they had two grandparents enrolled in a Jewish congregation, and ''Mischling of second degree'', or colloquially quarter-Jew, respectively, if they had one grandparent enrolled in a Jewish congregation.&lt;/ref&gt; a crossbreed, of "mixed blood", if they were not a member of a Jewish congregation at the time the Nuremberg Laws were enacted. Only people with at least two of their grandparents of "German blood" could be German Reich's citizens, other Germans dropped into the new second class group of citizens, the so-called state citizens.&lt;ref name="nurnberggesetz"&gt;[[Media:Nuremberg laws Racial Chart.jpg|Nazi guide to the Nuremberg laws]].&lt;/ref&gt; If a person, with grandparents of the same religious combination, was enrolled as a member of a Jewish congregation in 1935 or would join later, they switched from the discriminatory class of Mischlinge into that of [[Geltungsjude]], "Jew by legal validity", despite of not fulfilling the no less law-defined discriminating criterion of descending from three or four Jewish grandparents. Whereas every Mischling could anytime drop into the class of Geltungsjude by joining a Jewish congregation, the Nuremberg Laws provided for the unchanged classification of any Geltungsjude, regardless if she or he tried to evade harm by seceding from the Jewish congregation after 1935, considering such secessions as being of no effect as to the discrimination. Let alone people with three or four Jewish grandparents who themselves could never alter their law-defined racial categorisation as Jews. Any Mischling with two Jewish grandparents, colloquially called a half-Jew, marrying after 1935 anybody classified as Jew would drop into the discriminatory class of Geltungsjude. Mischlinge with one Jewish grandparent were usually forbidden to marry anybody with any Jewish grandparent. The [[Mischling Test]] was introduced to identify Europeans with Jewish blood and consider those tested "Jews of the first or second degree."

One could not become a non-Jew in the eyes of the Nazi government by seceding from one's Jewish congregation, becoming non-practicing, marrying outside the religion, or converting to Christianity. In 1935 the Nuremberg Laws forbade new marriages of people classified as Jews with people of other classifications.{{efn|See [[Anti-miscegenation laws#Nazi Germany]], ''[[Mischling]]e''}} Earlier contracted marriages between spouses of different classifications (so-called mixed marriages; Mischehe) provided the Jewish-classified spouse with an uncertain protection from some discriminations and atrocities.

There were very few [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]] in Europe during the Nazi era; most lived in the region of Turkey, Greece, and the [[Crimea]]. Karaites were not considered Jewish for the purpose of [[the Holocaust]] extermination policy;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ruth Tsoffar |title=The Stains of Culture: An Ethno-Reading of Karaite Jewish Women |location=Detroit |publisher=Wayne State University Press, |year=2006 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to SS Obergruppenführer Gottlob Berger, writing on November 24, 1944, discrimination against the Karaites had been prohibited due to their proximity to the Crimean [[Tatars]], to whom Berger views the Karaites as being related. Nazis still retained hostility towards the Karaites, on grounds of their religion; and there were a number of small scale massacres of Karaites.

In [[German occupation of France during World War II|German-occupied France]] an ordinance defined a Jew as an individual who belonged to the Jewish religion or who had more than two Jewish grandparents.&lt;ref name="Weisberg"/&gt;

The [[Vichy France|Vichy régime]] in southern France defined a Jew as an individual with three Jewish grandparents or two grandparents if his/her spouse was Jewish. Richard Weisberg points out that this was a potentially broader classification than the one used in Occupied France, for example, a [[Mischling]] could not be classified a Jew under the Nazi dictate, by her/his spouse's classification if the marriage was contracted before the imposition of anti-Semitic marriage laws there, but would be deemed one under the Vichy act if he/she had married a Jew, regardless when.&lt;ref name="Weisberg"&gt;Daniel C.

==Israelite identity loss claims==
{{See also|Israelite|Ten Lost Tribes}}

There are various groups besides Jews that have claimed descent from the biblical [[Israelite]]s. The question nowadays arises in relation to [[Israel]]'s [[Law of Return]], with various groups seeking to migrate there. Some claims have been accepted, some are under consideration, while others have been rejected by Israel's rabbinate.

===Cochin Jews (Indian Jews)===
{{See also|Cochin Jews}}

Some sources say that the earliest Jews of [[Cochin]], India were those who settled in the [[Malabar Coast]] during the times of [[Biblical account of King Solomon|King Solomon]] of Israel, and after the Kingdom of [[Israel]] split into two. There is historical documentation of the Jews being in Cochin after the fall of the Second Temple, from around the first century CE. Later additions were a smaller immigration of Sephardic Jews from Europe in the sixteenth century after the expulsion from Spain, and [[Baghdadi Jews]], [[Arabic]]-speaking Jews who arrived in the late eighteenth century, at the beginning of the British colonial era.&lt;ref&gt;Katz 2000; Koder 1973; Thomas Puthiakunnel 1973; David de Beth Hillel, 1832; Lord, James Henry 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the independence of India and the establishment of [[Israel]], most Cochin Jews emigrated to Israel in the mid-1950s. Some have gone on to North America or Britain.

===Bene Israel===
{{See also|Bene Israel}}

The [[Bene Israel]] in India claim to be descended from Jews who escaped persecution in [[Galilee]] in the 2nd century BCE. The Bene Israel resemble the non-Jewish [[Marathi people]] in appearance and customs, which indicates some intermarriage between Jews and Indians. The Bene Israel, however, maintained the practices of Jewish [[Kashrut|dietary laws]], [[Brit milah|male circumcision]] and observation of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] as a day of rest. From the late eighteenth century, other Jewish communities instructed them in normative Judaism.

Initially the Orthodox rabbinate in Israel said that the Bene Israel would have to undergo conversion in order to marry other Jews, as matrilineal descent could not be proven. In 1964 the Israeli Rabbinate declared that the Bene Israel are "full Jews in every respect".

The Bene Israel claim a lineage to the [[Kohen|Kohanim]], the Israelite priestly class, which claims descent from Aaron, the brother of Moses. In 2002, DNA testing revealed that the Bene Israel shared some genetic markers of the Kohanim. These are not exclusive to the Kohanim, but appear among them at a higher frequency. These are also shared with some non-Jewish Semitic peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/16588182.cms |work=The Times of India |location=India | first1=Rashmee Z | last1=Ahmed | title=India's children of Israel find their roots | date=July 20, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Many of the Bene Israel emigrated from India to Israel, where around 6,000 Jews of this group reside. About 5,000 remain in India. They maintain 65 synagogues in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indjews.com/|title=Indian Jewish Community in Israel|publisher=indjews.com|accessdate=July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beta Israel===
The [[Beta Israel]] or [[Falasha]] is a group formerly living in [[Ethiopia]] who have a tradition of descent from the lost tribe of [[Dan (biblical figure)|Dan]]. They have a long history of practicing such Jewish traditions as kashrut, Sabbath and Passover, and had Jewish texts. In 1975, their claim of Jewishness was accepted by the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] and the Israeli government. The government assisted them in emigrating ''en masse'' to Israel during the 1980s and 1990s as Jews under the [[Law of Return]], when Ethiopia was undergoing civil war. Some who claim to be Beta Israel still live in Ethiopia.

===Bnei Menashe===
The [[Bnei Menashe]] is a group in [[India]] claiming to be descendants of the half-tribe of [[Tribe of Menasheh|Menashe]]. Members who have studied Hebrew and who observe the Sabbath and other Jewish laws in 2005 received the support of the [[Sephardic Judaism|Sephardic]] [[Chief Rabbi of Israel]] to arrange formal conversion to Judaism. Some have converted and immigrated to Israel under the Law of Return.

===The Kaifeng Jews===
{{Details|History of the Jews in China}}

The [[Kaifeng Jews]], a [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin-speaking]] group from [[Henan Province]], China, experienced first contact with Europeans in 1605 via the religious scholar [[Matteo Ricci]]. Modern researchers believe these Jews were descended from Persian merchants who settled in China during the early [[Song Dynasty]]. They prospered during the [[Ming Dynasty]] as Confucian civil servants, soldiers, and merchants, but they quickly assimilated and lost much of their Jewish heritage. By the beginning of the 19th century, the last rabbi with knowledge of Hebrew died, leaving no successor. The community had become extinct religiously by the late [[Qing Dynasty]] due to anti-foreign persecutions brought on by the [[Taiping Rebellion]] and [[Boxer Rebellion]]. There are a small number of Chinese people today who consider themselves to be descendants of these Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Xu, Xin. ''The Jews of Kaifeng, China: History, Culture, and Religion''. Jersey City, NJ: KTAV Pub. House, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their isolation from the rest of the [[Jewish diaspora]], the Jews of Kaifeng preserved Jewish traditions and customs for many centuries. In the 17th century, assimilation began to erode these traditions. The rate of intermarriage between Jews and other ethnic groups, such as the [[Han Chinese]], and the [[Hui people|Hui]] and [[Manchu]] minorities in China, increased. The destruction of the synagogue in the 1860s led to the community's demise.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/992405.html|title = Taking the Silk Route back home|work = [[Haaretz]]|first = Anshel|last = Pfeffer|date = June 27, 2008|accessdate =December 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, J.L. Liebermann, the first Western Jew to visit Kaifeng in 1867, noted that "they still had a burial ground of their own". S.M. Perlmann, the Shanghai businessman and scholar, wrote in 1912 that "they bury their dead in coffins, but of a different shape than those of the Chinese are made, and do not attire the dead in secular clothes as the Chinese do, but in linen".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://books.google.com/?id=V4SmEW0WXCwC&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=german%20jewish%20china&amp;pg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;f=false|editor-first = Jonathan|editor-last = Goldstein|title = From Berlin To Tianjin|journal = The Jews of China|volume = 1|year = 1998|page = 117|isbn = 978-0-7656-0103-2|first = Heinz|last = Dawid}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, there is only one scholar, Zhou Xu, who doubts the Kaifeng community's Jewishness and claims them to have been a western construct.&lt;ref&gt;Xun Zhou, "The Kaifeng Jew Hoax: Constructing the 'Chinese Jews'", in eds. Ivan Kalmar &amp; Derek Penslar, ''Orientalism and The Jews'', pp. 68–80. Brandeis University Press (USA), 2004 ({{ISBN|1-58465-411-2}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, 600-1,000 residents of Kaifeng trace their lineage to this community.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; After contact with Jewish tourists, the Jews of Kaifeng have reconnected to mainstream Jewry. With the help of Jewish organizations, some members of the community have emigrated to Israel.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; In 2009, Chinese Jews from Kaifeng arrived in Israel as immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://jta.org/news/article/2009/10/26/1008728/descendants-of-chinese-jews-arrive-in-israel| title=Descendants of Chinese Jews arrive in Israel |work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |date=October 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chinese Jews from Kaifeng arrive in Israel 2009 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edhtdoPukk0 |quote=A short documentary produced by Shavei Israel on the aliyah of Jews from Kaifeng China to Israel.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3936926,00.html |title=Kaifeng Jews study in Israeli yeshiva |author=Rebecca Bitton |date=August 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Lemba===
{{see also|Jews and Judaism in Africa}}
The [[Lemba people|Lemba]], group of people from southern Africa, primarily [[Zimbabwe]] and [[South Africa]], speak the [[Bantu languages]] spoken by their geographic neighbours and resemble them physically, but they have some religious practices and beliefs similar to those in [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]], which they claim were transmitted by oral tradition.&lt;ref name="Magdel"&gt;{{Cite book|author= le Roux, Magdel|title=The Lemba – A Lost Tribe of Israel in Southern Africa?|pages=209–224, 24, 37 |publisher=University of South Africa|location=Pretoria|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have a tradition of ancient Jewish or South Arabian descent through their male line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi= 10.1163/157430199X00100|title='Lost Tribes1 of Israel' in Africa?

===New Mexico's Crypto-Jews===
A small [[Hispanic|Hispano]] group of Sephardic Jews in northern [[New Mexico]] may be one of the oldest groups of practicing Jews in North America, dating back to the early Spanish settlers of Jewish descent who had been forcibly converted to Catholicism as [[Conversos]] or [[New Christians]], or both after 1492. Some families of Conversos began to settle in Mexico City in the 1530s and 1540s. Some converted back to Judaism; others maintained some Jewish beliefs and practices in secret. After the [[Spanish Inquisition]] came to the New World in 1571, the conversos were threatened with death if it was found they were practicing Judaism.

In 1598, the first expedition was made to New Mexico, and included conversos.&lt;ref name="wheelwright"/&gt; After that, other conversos fled to the northwestern frontier of the [[Spanish Empire]],&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; now the American Southwest, to evade the scrutiny and threat of discovery in the more monitored settlements. Outwardly Catholic, these forced converts maintained Jewish practices and customs for generations in secret, hence their name, "[[Crypto-Jews]]". They have been the subject of recent academic study.&lt;ref&gt;Hordes, Stanley M. (2005). ''To The End of The Earth: A History of the Crypto-Jews of New Mexico,'' Columbia University Press. pp. 376. {{ISBN|978-0-231-12937-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of New Mexico's Crypto-Jews have begun to return to normative Judaism in recent years, through study and ritual conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/29/national/29religion.html| work=The New York Times | first=Simon | last=Romero | title=Hispanics Uncovering Roots as Inquisition's 'Hidden' Jews | date=October 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others feel enlarged by learning this part of their history, but continue as practicing Catholics.

A genetic study of men in the early 2000s showed that many Hispanos of the American Southwest are descended from [[Anusim]] (Sephardic Jews who were forcibly converted to Roman Catholicism). Only Catholic Spanish were allowed to go to the New World with the exploration and colonial expeditions. Families first kept their secrets for protection and then out of habit. Michael Hammer, a research professor at the [[University of Arizona]] and an expert on Jewish genetics, said that fewer than 1% of non-Semites possessed the male-specific "[[Y-chromosomal Aaron|Cohanim marker]]" or [[Cohen Modal Haplotype]], which is prevalent among Jews claiming descent from hereditary priests. 30 of 78 Latinos tested in New Mexico (38.5%), were found to have Y-DNA with the Cohanim marker.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/dec/05/nation/na-heritage5 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=David | last=Kelly | title=DNA Clears the Fog Over Latino Links to Judaism in New Mexico | date=December 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wider DNA testing of Hispanic populations has revealed between 10% and 15% of men living in New Mexico, south Texas and northern Mexico have a Y chromosome associated with the Middle East. Their history makes it most likely that they are Jewish rather than Arabic Muslim.

In 2008, a [[BRCA mutation|gene mutation]] that is typically found only in [[Ashkenazi]] Jews, and is linked to a virulent form of breast cancer in women, was discovered in a cluster of Hispanic Catholic women in southern Colorado, many of whom trace their family's roots to northern New Mexico. It was conclusively shown to be related to Jewish ancestry, given the history of the people in the area, and many families reported knowledge of a high incidence of cancer. After testing and notification of families, researchers worked with the extended families on genetic counseling and to develop health strategies for monitoring, early detection and treatment, as they were faced with the higher risk associated with the gene.&lt;ref name="wheelwright"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/san-luis-valley.html |title=The 'Secret Jews' of San Luis Valley |work=Smithsonian Magazine |author=Jeff Wheelwright |date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other evidence of Jewish ancestry is language. According to a Jewish genealogy blog, so-called "Mountain Spanish", a Spanish [[dialect]] spoken by many of the old families of northern New Mexico and southern Colorado—and chiefly only among themselves—appears to be a form of [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino or Judezmo]]. This was a hybrid language that developed among Sephardic Jews in Iberia, from Old Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Hebrew]], with sprinklings of [[Arabic]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and other languages, depending on the geographic region of the speakers or their ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tracingthetribe.blogspot.com/2009/10/turkey-ladino-newspaper.html |title=Turkey: A Ladino newspaper |work=Tracing the Tribe: The Jewish Genealogy Blog |date=October 9, 2009 |quote=In northern New Mexico, the descendants of Converso settlers who arrived as early as the late 16th century, still speak "Mountain Spanish." In reality, it is 16th century Ladino, and scholars who have visited them have been amazed at how well the language has been transmitted down through the generations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Why Darwin Matters: The Case Against Intelligent Design''''' is a 2006 book by [[Michael Shermer]], a [[historian of science]]. Shermer argues that [[intelligent design]] is bad science, that different fields of science converge in supporting evolution, and that religion and science are not in conflict. As a former [[young Earth creationism|young Earth creationist]], Shermer explores the beliefs and critiques the claims behind it.

[[Christopher Hitchens]] commented on the book, "With his forensic and polemical skill, he could have left them for dead: instead he generously urges them to stop wasting their time (and ours) and do some real work."&lt;ref name="Reviews"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/06-08-30.html | title=announcing Michael Shermer’s NEW book | publisher=[[The Skeptics Society]] |date= August 30, 2006  | first= | last=    | accessdate =2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Pinker]] wrote it is "A readable and well-researched book on what is perhaps the most vital scientific topic of our age. Anyone who has been snowed into thinking that there is a real scientific controversy over evolution by natural selection will be enlightened by Why Darwin Matters, which is both genial and intellectually uncompromising."&lt;ref name="Reviews"/&gt; Robert Lee Hotz, for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' explained "None writes so fiercely in defense of evolution as Shermer... With the sustained indignation of a former creationist, Shermer is savage about the shortcomings of intelligent design and eloquent about the spirituality of science. In Why Darwin Matters, he has assembled an invaluable primer for anyone caught up in an argument with a well-intentioned intelligent design advocate."&lt;ref name="Reviews"/&gt;

Jim Walker wrote, "This book should appeal to Christians who want to understand evolution but who do not want to feel offended by the anti-religious tone of some evolutionary scientists. Shermer carefully explains, in a non-threatening manner, how evolution and natural selection works while also explaining why Intelligent Design theory cannot explain the diversity of life on the planet earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nobeliefs.com/Shermer4.htm | title=Review of Why Darwin Matters  | publisher=NoBeliefs.com |year= 2006  | first= | last=    | accessdate =2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Zawāyā''' are tribes in the southern [[Sahara]] who have traditionally followed a deeply religious way of life. They accepted a subordinate position to the warrior tribes, whether Arab or Berber, who had little interest in [[Islam]].  The Zawāyā introduced [[Sufi]] brotherhoods to the black populations south of the Sahara.  The ''[[jihad]]'' movements of the [[Fula people]] in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries have their origins with the Zawāyā.  Today the Zawāyā are one of the two noble castes of [[Mauritania]].

==Background==

The Zawāyā{{efn|The term ''[[Zawiya (institution)|Zawiya]]'', plural form ''Zawaya'', is also used in the [[Maghreb]] and West Africa for Sufi centers of religious education.{{sfn|Mohamed|2012|p=20}} The Zawaya tribes were nomadic, but followed the teachings that emanated from these centers.}} were nomadic tribes from the arid lands to the north and east of the [[Senegal River]] in [[West Africa]].{{sfn|Gray|1975|p=12}}
Their religious beliefs may possibly be traced back to the eleventh century [[Almoravid]] movement, although their generally more passive attitude is in contrast to that of the militant Almoravids.{{sfn|Willis|1979|p=3}}
They gave great importance to teaching the Islamic religious sciences and to reciting the [[Quran]].{{sfn|Willis|1979|p=4}}
The Zawāyā attempted to avoid conflict with the stronger warrior groups by renouncing arms and paying tribute.{{sfn|Willis|1979|p=6}}

In the west, the Zawāyā were of [[Berber people|Berber]] origin, while after the fifteenth century the warrior tribes were [[Arab people|Arab]].  In the center, the reverse applied.
The Zawāyā were Arab, while Berber or [[Tuareg]] tribes held military and political power.{{sfn|Fage|Tordoff|2002|p=193}}
The Zawāyā, with their passive lifestyle of herding, prayer and study, were treated with some contempt by the stronger groups, but this was mingled with respect.{{sfn|Willis|1979|p=6}}
A story was told by the sixteenth century [[Timbuktu]] jurist al-Muṣallī, so-called because he worshiped in the mosque so often.
He was a Zawāyā from the west and a regular attendant at the teaching circle of the jurist Maḥmūd, grandson of Anda Ag-Muhammad in the female line.  
Al-Muṣallī resolved to ask for the hand of Maḥmūd's daughter in marriage.  Before he could make his proposal Maḥmūd politely deflected it, saying that "birds of a feather flock together".{{sfn|Hunwick|2003|p=44}}

The separation of the tribes of this region into warrior and Zawāyā tribes had probably occurred before the fifteenth century.{{sfn|Gray|1975|p=199}}
By then some of the Zawāyā were moving south to avoid the depredations of the warrior tribes, risking conflict with the sedentary populations of [[Chemama]], [[Gorgol Region|Gorgol]] and [[Tagant Region|Tagant]].{{sfn|Kane|2004|p=379}}
During the fifteenth century the [[Beni Ḥassān]] Arab nomads began to enter the region. Hassāni rulers imposed heavy tributes on the Zawāyā, but did not give them effective protection against their enemies.{{sfn|Gray|1975|p=199}}
Although subordinate to the Banū Ḥassan warriors, the Zawāyā ranked above other Berbers.  
These in turn ranked above blacksmiths, who were said to be Jewish in origin, and mixed-race people.{{sfn|Willis|1979|p=8}}

==Revolt in 1673==

In the late seventeenth century, Awbek Ashfaga of the Banū Daymān tribe, later to style himself Nāșir al-Din ("Protector of the Faith"), emerged as a leader of the Zawāyā tribes in resisting the Hassān. He was widely respected for his scholarship, purity of life and healing ability. His goal was to establish an ideal Islamic society based on the original organization of the first caliphs, where ethnic and tribal differences would be ignored. Nāșir al-Din demanded strict obedience to his authority by the Zawāyā.  He set out to create a secure and stable administration in the southern Sahara, led by himself, his vizier and four qāḍīs.  To do so he would defeat warriors who failed to follow Islamic principles and who harmed the faithful,
and would establish a theocratic state that rose above tribal divisions and followed the commands of God.{{sfn|Gray|1975|p=200}}

Rather than immediately attack the Hassān, in 1673 Nāșir al-Din launched his ''jihad'' with an invasion across the [[Senegal River]] into the [[Futa Tooro]] and [[Wolof people|Wolof]] states. This would give him control of the trade in gum with the French on the Senegal, a source of income for his new state. He then imposed the [[zakāt]] legal tax on the tributary tribes to the north of the Senegal. When one of these tribes called for assistance from the Hassān, war broke out.{{sfn|Gray|1975|p=200}} 
Nāșir al-Din was supported by most but not all of the Zawāyā, although some disputed his authority to impose the zakāt and did not assist him. 
There were at least three battles, in each of which the Zawāyā defeated the Hassān.
However, in the last battle, which probably took place in August 1674, Nāșir al-Din and many of his immediate entourage were killed.{{sfn|Gray|1975|p=201}}

The Zawāyā elected Sīdī al-Fāḍil as Nāșir al-Din's successor, who took the name of al-Amīn. 
Al-Amīn was disposed to make peace with the Hassān, and they were willing to accept his religious authority but not his right to levy the zakat.  Most of the Zawāyā were opposed to the peace, and deposed al-Amīn, replacing him with 'Uthmān, the former vizier and close friend of Nāșir al-Din. 'Uthmān took an aggressive stance against the Hassān, and again attempted to enforce collection of the zakāt. His tax collectors were massacred by a [[Trarza]] chief who had come to the assistance of the weaker tribes, and 'Uthmān was killed in battle by the Wolof. His successors were decisively defeated by the Hassān.{{sfn|Gray|1975|p=201}}

==Later history==

Following this defeat, the Zawāyā lost all temporal power and again became strictly tributary to the Hassān, and were parceled out among the Hassān groups.{{sfn|Gray|1975|p=202}}
They had to provide milk from their herds to the Hassān warriors and provide them with saddles.{{sfn|Willis|1979|p=10}}
They had to let the Hassān take the first bucket of water from their wells, and had to feed and shelter Hassān women in time of need.
This seems to have been a return to their condition before the revolt started.{{sfn|Gray|1975|p=202}}
Many of the Zawāyā continued their religious studies after puberty, while others engaged in commerce, agriculture, livestock management or hired out their labor where the work was consist with their religious practices.{{sfn|Willis|1979|p=10}} 
The Zawāyā were required to educate the Ḥassanī children.{{sfn|Willis|1979|p=10}}
Although subject to the Hassān, their religious influence on their Arab masters grew.{{sfn|Gray|1975|p=211}}

The economic and political structure of the region changed as contact with Europeans increased. Slaves were increasingly used to mine salt and cultivate crops in the oases rather than as trade goods.  The French continued to expand the gum trade, particularly after 1815.  This brought increased prosperity to the Hassāni of Ida Aish, who controlled the trade to [[Bakel, Senegal|Bakel]] on the Senega River, and took some of the profits that the Zawāyā had traditionally made from collecting and selling gum. 
However, a clerical leader managed to establish an alternative gum market at [[Médine, Mali|Medine]], further upstream, competing with the Hassāni.{{sfn|Law|2002|p=229}}

Both the Zawāyā and the Hassāni became more wealthy in slaves and material property, but a shift in the balance of power occurred as more students and clients were attracted to the  Zawāyā, who also acquired better arms.{{sfn|Law|2002|p=230}}
The rise of the Zawāyā as merchants coincided with growth in demand for religious instruction.{{sfn|Law|2002|p=231}}
The distinction between Zawāyā and Hassāni also began to blur, as each group entered the traditional occupations of the other.{{sfn|Law|2002|p=234}}
In modern [[Mauritania]], the Zawāyā and Hassāni are both considered noble castes, dominating the politics of the country.{{sfn|Isichei|1997|p=300}}

==Wider influence==

The Zawāyā introduced sub-Saharan Africans to the two main [[Sufi]] brotherhoods.
Muhammed al-Hafiz (1759/60-1830) and his people transmitted the [[Tijaniyyah]], while the [[Kunta family|Kunta]], including the scholars Shaykh [[Sidi Mukhtar]] (1729-1811) and his son Sidi Muhammad, transmitted the [[Qadiriyya]].{{sfn|Kane|2012|p=21}}

There are records of Zawāyā moving into the lands south of the Senegal in the seventeenth century, where they proselytized and intermarried with the local people.{{sfn|Willis|1979|p=11}}
Nāșir al-Din had gained support from the [[Torodbe]] clerical clan of Futa Tooro in his struggle.{{sfn|Gray|1975|p=205}} 
After the defeat in 1674, some of the Torodbe migrated south to [[Bundu, Senegal|Bundu]] and some continued on to the [[Fouta Djallon]].{{sfn|Gray|1975|p=206}}
The Torodbe, the kinsmen of the [[Fula people|Fulbe]] of the Fouta Djallon, influenced them in embracing a more militant form of Islam.{{sfn|Gray|1975|p=207}}
In 1726 or 1727 the Fulbe were to launch their successful ''jihad'' in the Fouta Djallon.{{sfn|Amanat|Bernhardsson|2002|p=244}}
Later the Fulbe would establish Islamic states in Futa Tooro (1776), [[Sokoto Caliphate|Sokoto]] (1808) and [[Masina, Mali|Masina]] (1818).{{sfn|Stanton|Ramsamy|Seybolt|Elliott|2012|p=148}}

The [[Kunta]] became particularly influential in the eighteenth century. Many of them moved east to the region north of Timbuktu and became salt merchants. They adopted the teachings of the fifteenth century cleric [[Muhammad al-Maghili]], said to be the first to introduce the [[Qadiriyya]] Sufi brotherhood to the western Sudan. The Kunta produced several important  clerics, of whom Sidi Mukhtar had the greatest impact.{{sfn|Fage|Tordoff|2002|p=193}}
Sidi Mukhtar became the leader of a Tuareg coalition dominated by the Kunta that controlled the Niger bend and surrounding areas.  He is also credited with authoring over 300 treatises.
His sponsorship of the proselytizing Sufi ''[[tariqa]]s'', particularly the Qadiriyya order, meant that Islam was no longer the private religion of Saharan traders, but began to steadily spread among the black populations of the Sahel and further south.{{sfn|Fage|Tordoff|2002|p=194}}

Many West African libraries and collections of Islamic writings include works by Zawāyā authors.{{sfn|Kane|2012|p=21}}
Most of these writings are in Arabic.{{sfn|Kane|2012|p=22}}
Today the Zawāyā continue to be in demand as teachers of the Quran in West African Islamic schools.{{sfn|Kane|2012|p=21}}

}}
'''Zhong Gong''' (中功) is a spiritual movement based on ''[[qigong]]'' founded in 1987 by [[Zhang Hongbao]].&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; The full name (中华养生益智功) translates to "China Health Care and Wisdom Enhancement Practice." The system distinguished itself from other forms of ''qigong'' by its strong emphasis on commercialisation, and a targeted strategy that aimed to build a national commercial organisation in China in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=palmer.fever&gt;Palmer (2007), p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhong Gong achieved national prominence during the '[[qigong fever]]' that gripped China during the Deng era. The denomination included a nationwide network of schools and healing centres based on Zhang's form of ''qigong'' before being outlawed by Chinese authorities in 1999. Zhang Hongbao claimed in 2003 to have about 38&amp;nbsp;million followers, and even [[Jiang Zemin]] allegedly believed in the curative power of Zhong Gong’s message.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Lionel. Entry on "Falun Gong" in the Encyclopedia of Contemporary Chinese Culture, Edward L. Davis (ed.) Routledge 2004, pp. 252–263&lt;/ref&gt;

After China declared Zhong Gong an illegal organisation, all its assets and those of the 3,000 entitles constituting the Unicorn Group were confiscated, its 600 principals arrested.&lt;ref name=kylinwenhua/&gt; Zhong Gong wilted away once the organisation was no longer able to transmit the material and social benefits which were motivational drivers for its followers.&lt;ref name=palmer.fever262/&gt; After a warrant for the arrest of leader Zhang Hongbao was issued, he fled to United States and applied for [[political asylum]]—he gained Protective resident status in U.S. on 13 June 2001. Zhang died in a car accident in July 2006.

== History and development ==
In the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations, Zhang Hongbao retreated to a remote base area in Sichuan, where he reorganised his followers as employees of a web of private enterprises owned by a parent firm, the Qilin Group.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton (2003), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1990s, Zhong Gong became the most popular of the  various ''qigong'' schools, but rumours concerning Zhong Gong started to surface.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;Smith, Craig S. "[https://www.nytimes.com/library/world/asia/073100china-leader.html Asylum Plea by Chinese Sect's Leader Perplexes the U.S.]," [[New York Times]], 31 July 2000&lt;/ref&gt; As controversy about Zhong Gong increased, Falun Gong gained in popularity, eventually superseding Zhong Gong as the largest movement of its kind.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

Its commercial activities were incorporated in China as the Unicorn Group (麒麟集团), a collectively ownership enterprise. In [[Mainland China]], it had numerous operations, branches, and staff. There were six subordinate divisions, including Qigong training, healthy living, travel, education, medical.

Political scientist Patricia M. Thornton at the University of Oxford lists Zhong Gong as an example of a [[cybersect]], due to the group's reliance internet for text distribution, recruitment and information-sharing among adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, Patricia M. "The New Cybersects: Resistance and Repression in the Reform era" in Elizabeth Perry and Mark Selden, eds., ''Chinese Society: Change, Conflict and Resistance'' (second edition) (London and New York: Routledge, 2003), pp. 149–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs and teachings ==
Palmer, citing Ji Yi, said Zhang developed a style of ''Qigong'' which was based on [[automation]], physics, [[Theory of relativity|relativity]], [[bionics]], and with distinctive use of mechanical engineering jargon,&lt;ref name=palmer.fever2&gt;Palmer (2007) pp. 146–150&lt;/ref&gt; and founded Zhong Gong in 1987, launching it on the [[numbers in Chinese culture|auspicious date]] of 8 August 1987.&lt;ref name=palmer.fever2/&gt;

Zhong Gong is based on the Qilin culture (麒麟文化) created by Zhang in 1987 which He (2000) states is "an obvious challenge to Marxism and the CCP's one-party rule". According to Zhang's 'spirit-matter dialectics', both spirit and matter both have objective existence and can transform into the other under certain circumstances. In 1992, based on the ancient theories of [[yin and yang]], Zhang extrapolated his universal law of motion according to which all objects or matter can subdivide into 'Yin' or 'Yang', predicting anything or act which contravened it would bring eventual disaster. He asserted [[Marxism|Marxist]] property right theory and the derived Communist Party aim to eliminate [[private property]] were in conflict with his laws. In 1993, Zhang advanced his theories of 'promotion-restriction-inhibition-transformation' derived from the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Five elements]]. In 1998, Zhang put forward a moral code which he referred to as "eight virtues and eight calls".&lt;ref name=kylinwenhua&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O6ac30QVU-4C&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=zhang+hongbao#v=onepage&amp;q=zhang%20hongbao&amp;f=false |title=Kylin wenhua |work=Dictionary of the political thought of the People's Republic of China |first=Henry Y. |last=He |pages=224–226 |isbn=0-7656-0569-4 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qilin culture==
'Qilin Culture' was one of the most elaborate syntheses of qigong as a totalising knowledge system, developed by Zhang Hongbao, master of Zhong Gong.

It aimed to combine all forms of knowledge into a single, integrated system: During lectures at the Beijing Great Hall of Sciences, Zhang "solemnly proclaimed to China and the world" that the Zhong Gong cultural system, which came to him by inspiration, would be formally named Qilin Culture.&lt;ref name="Palmer 2007, p. 81"&gt;Palmer (2007), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a well-known account by Ji Yi, a journalist and enthusiastic ''qigong'' practitioner himself, "the qilin combines in a single body the essence of different species of living beings: the dragon's head, the pig's nose, the serpent's scales, the deer's body, the tiger's back, the bear's thighs, the ox's hooves and the lion's tail."&lt;ref name="Palmer 2007, p. 81"/&gt;

He says it belongs to none of these species, but combines the powers of each. "By thus naming his scientific research system, this symbolises that Qilin Culture is the spark produced by the friction of ancient and modern cultures, and the fruit of the integration of Western and Eastern philosophies." It absorbs "the essence of the Chinese nation," he wrote, and "rests on the shoulders of the giants of the history of science."&lt;ref name="Palmer 2007, p. 81"/&gt;

According to Ji Yi's account, conveyed in Palmer, Qilin culture was said to "smelt in a single furnace the Way of Heaven, the Way of Earth, the Way of Man, government, economy, military affairs, art and philosophy. It covers virtue, intelligence and the body; it neglects neither the natural sciences, nor the social sciences, nor the life sciences. It rests on the soil of the Realm of Spirit; it is a remarkable contribution of the Chinese nation, to the universe and to the human race."&lt;ref name="Palmer 2007, p. 81"/&gt;

Qilin culture, according to Zhang, was made up of eight "systems": a philosophical system based on the traditional "diagram of ultimate return," which is to explain the origin of all creatures, their functions, and final destinations; a system of life sciences based on the use of ''qi'' to penetrate the mystery of biological systems; a system of "special medicine," which was different in important ways from Chinese and Western medicine, and "even garden variety qigong"; a system of art and aesthetics included ''qigong'' art, architecture, dance, music; a system of education; a system of industrial and political management; a system of everyday behaviour; a system of body practices.&lt;ref&gt;Ownby, David. ''Falun Gong and the Future of China'' (2008) Oxford University Press, pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisational techniques==
Zhang Hongbao's had two organisations which formed the foundation of what eventually became an "impressive set of interlocked enterprises, the engine of which was a Qigong practice" according to Patricia Thornton.

More than any other ''qigong'' group, Zhong Gong concerned itself with a systematic training scheme of eight ascending levels. The practitioner would thus have a clear path of progression on which to advance. Unlike other ''qigong'' schools, which emphasised mastery of sitting meditation, movements, and inner alchemy, Zhong Gong geared its workshops around the acquisition of specific skills. The participants were to master a skill with satisfaction after several days training. Workshops aimed to train participants in Zhong Gong's brand of organisational and managerial techniques at the "second level." They would then be able to go forth and set up their own Zhong Gong franchises.&lt;ref name=palmer.fever/&gt;

Stage one included basic techniques and posters; stage two covered organisational methods, certain ''qigong'' performance arts, and the 'secret of secrets' of Buddhist and Taoist techniques; stage three consisted of still meditation (''jinggong''), ''qigong'' hypnosis, and spontaneous boxing; stage four included more advanced ''qigong'' techniques like electric ''qigong'', hard ''qigong'' etc., while stage five covered [[Fengshui]], massage, regulation of the emotions, and more. The sixth, seventh, and eighth levels were never disclosed to the public.&lt;ref name=palmer.fever3&gt;Palmer (2007), p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhong Gong drew a large number of staunch believers across China, elaborating a highly organised structure that led Chinese Communist Party authorities to suspect it may turn into an opposing political force.&lt;ref name=kylinwenhua/&gt;

Qilin Culture's modern management theory, based on the traditional yin—yang and five-elements cosmology, was the basis for the Zhong Gong organisation, according to Palmer.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer (2007), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed to be applicable to family, business or government, and aimed to synthesise the best aspects of the five phases of human social development: primitive society, slave society, feudal society, capitalist society and communist society.

==Banned in China==
The 12th session of the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|NPC Standing Committee]] passed a resolution on 30 October 1999 which allowed it to take action against "heretic cults"&lt;ref name=kylinwenhua/&gt; and which applied retroactively to Falun Gong, Zhong Gong and any other spiritual groups deemed "dangerous to the state".&lt;ref name=Leung&gt;Leung, Beatrice. "China and Falun Gong: Party and society relations in the modern era," Journal of Contemporary China, 11:33, 2002, pp. 761–784&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Zhong Gong has been much more low key than Falun Gong, and the government crackdown on it is almost unknown in China.&lt;ref name=Japan&gt;Cunningham, Philip. "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/member/member.html?eo20001230a1.htm Falling victim to U.S.-Chinese diplomacy]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}," The Japan Times, 30 Dec. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer describes how Zhong Gong effectively ceased to exist once the organisation was no longer able to provide material and social benefits to its followers.&lt;ref name=palmer.fever262&gt;Palmer (2007), p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

As a sign of Zhang's acumen, Thornton notes that when the Beijing daily reported that his Beijing-based International Qigong Service Enterprise had been shut down pending an investigation into possible criminal activities, Zhang hired the team of lawyers who had defended Mao's widow during the [[Gang of Four]] trial, and managed to gain a public apology from the paper. A five-year string of unsuccessful legal actions against the government followed, during which Zhang managed to elude arrest.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton (2008), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

After China declared Zhong Gong an illegal organisation, all its assets and those of the 3,000 entities constituting the Unicorn Group were confiscated, and its 600 principals arrested.&lt;ref name=kylinwenhua/&gt; After a warrant for the arrest of leader Zhang Hongbao was issued, he fled to the United States and applied for [[political asylum]]. He was not granted asylum, but gained Protective Resident Status on 13 June 2001. Zhang died in the United States in a motor accident on 31 July 2006 at the age of 52. After Zhang’s death, Zhong Gong almost disappeared from the public's eye.

'''Śramaṇa''' ([[Sanskrit]]: श्रमण; [[Pali]]: '''samaṇa''') means "one who labors, toils, or exerts themselves (for some higher or religious purpose)"&lt;ref&gt;Dhirasekera, Jotiya.

The śramaṇa movements arose in the same circles of [[mendicant]]s in ancient India that led to the development of [[yoga|yogic]] practices,{{sfn|Samuel|2008|p=8; Quote: such (yogic) practices developed in the same ascetic circles as the early Sramana movements (Buddhists, Jainas and Ajivikas), probably in around the sixth or fifth BCE}} as well as the popular concepts in all major [[Indian religions]] such as ''[[saṃsāra]]'' (the cycle of birth and death) and ''[[moksha]]'' (liberation from that cycle).&lt;ref name="Flood, Gavin 2003. pg. 273-4"&gt;Flood, Gavin.

These include the two pillars of Indian theologies: samsara - the belief that life in this world is one of suffering and subject to repeated deaths and births (rebirth); moksa/nirvana - the goal of human existence....."&lt;ref name="Flood, Gavin 2003. pg. 273-4" /&gt;}}

The Śramaṇic traditions have a diverse range of beliefs, ranging from accepting or denying the concept of soul, fatalism to free will, idealization of extreme asceticism to that of family life, wearing dress to complete nudity in daily social life, strict [[ahimsa]] (non-violence) and vegetarianism to permissibility of violence and meat-eating.&lt;ref name=Jaini_2001&gt;Padmanabh S Jaini (2001), Collected papers on Buddhist Studies, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120817760}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|57-77}}&lt;ref name=Jaini_2000&gt;Padmanabh S Jaini (2000), Collected papers on Jaina Studies, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120816916}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3-14}}

==Etymology and origin==
One of the earliest recorded uses of the word ''śramaṇa'', in the sense of a mendicant, is in verse 4.3.22 of the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] composed by about the 8th century BCE.&lt;ref name=Jaini_2001 /&gt;{{rp|48}}&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads02ml#page/168/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4.3.22] Oxford University Press, page 169&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of renunciation and monk-like lifestyle is found in Vedic literature, with terms such as [[yati]]s, [[rishi]]s, and śramaṇas.&lt;ref name=gavinflood76/&gt;&lt;ref name=sociology&gt;{{cite book|author1=École pratique des hautes études (France)|author2=Section des sciences économiques et sociales, University of Oxford|author3=Institute of Social Anthropology|author4=Institute of Economic Growth (India)|author5=Research Centre on Social and Economic Development in Asia|title=Contributions to Indian sociology, Volume 15|year=1981|publisher=Mouton|page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vedic literature from pre-1000 BCE era, mentions ''[[Rishi|Muni]]'' (मुनि, monks, mendicants, holy man).&lt;ref name=werner289&gt;{{cite journal |first=Karel |last=Werner |date=1977 |title=Yoga and the Ṛg Veda: An Interpretation of the Keśin Hymn (RV 10, 136) |work=Religious Studies |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=289–302}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rigveda|Rig Veda]], for example, in Book 10 Chapter 136, mentions mendicants as those with ''kēśin'' (केशिन्, long-haired) and ''mala'' clothes (मल, dirty, soil-colored, yellow, orange, saffron) engaged in the affairs of ''mananat'' (mind, meditation).&lt;ref name=gsg&gt;GS Ghurye (1952), Ascetic Origins, Sociological Bulletin, Vol. 1, No. 2, pages 162-184;&lt;br&gt;For Sanskrit original: [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.१३६ Rigveda] Wikisource;&lt;br&gt;For English translation: [https://archive.org/stream/hymnsrigveda00unkngoog#page/n588/mode/2up Kesins] Rig Veda, Hymn CXXXVI, Ralph Griffith (Translator)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/poem&gt;
|Rig Veda|Hymn 10.136.1-2&lt;ref name=gsg/&gt;&lt;ref name=werner289/&gt;}}

The hymn uses the term ''vātaraśana'' (वातरशन) which means "girdled with wind".&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams, [http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=vAtarazana+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU vAtarazana] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Olivelle|1993|p=12}} Some scholars have interpreted this to mean "sky-clad, naked monk" and therefore a synonym for ''[[Digambara]]'' (a Jainism sect). However, other scholars state that this could not be the correct interpretation because it is inconsistent with the words that immediately follow, "wearing soil-hued garments". The context likely means that the poet is describing the "munis" as moving like the wind, their garments pressed by the wind. According to Olivelle, it is unlikely that the ''vātaraśana'' implies a class within the Vedic context.{{sfn|Olivelle|1993|pp=12-13}}

The earliest known explicit use of the term śramaṇa is found in section 2.7 of the ''Taittiriya [[Aranyaka]]'', a layer within the ''[[Yajurveda]]'' (~1000 BCE, a scripture of Hinduism). It mentions ''śramaṇa [[Rishi]]s'' and celibate ''Rishis''.{{sfn|Olivelle|1993|p=12 with footnote 20}}&lt;ref name=crangle30/&gt;

Buddhist commentaries associate the word's etymology with the quieting (''{{lang|pi-Latn|samita}}'') of evil (''{{lang|pi-Latn|pāpa}}'') as in the following phrase from the 3rd century BCE ''[[Dhammapada]]'', verse 265: ''{{lang|pi-Latn|samitattā pāpānaŋ ʻsamaṇoʼ ti pavuccati}}'' ("someone who has pacified evil is called ''{{lang|pi-Latn|samaṇa}}''").{{refn|group=note|According to [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:3300.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), "Samaṇa," p. 682:] 'an edifying etymology of the word [is at] DhA iii.84: "samita-pāpattā [samaṇa]," cp. Dh 265 "{{IAST|samitattā pāpānaŋ ʻsamaṇoʼ ti pavuccati}}"....' The English translation of [[Dhammapada|Dh]] 265 is based on Fronsdal (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;69.}}

The word śramaṇa is postulated to be derived from the verbal root ''{{IAST|śram}}'', meaning "to exert effort, labor or to perform austerity".&lt;ref name=mmw1096/&gt; The history of wandering monks in ancient India is partly untraceable. The term 'parivrajaka' was perhaps applicable to all the peripatetic monks of India, such as those found in Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism.&lt;ref name=Jash&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pranabananda Jash|title=History of the Parivrājaka, Issue 24 of Heritage of ancient India|year=1991|publisher=Ramanand Vidya Bhawan|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''śramaṇa'' refers to a variety of [[sannyasa|renunciate]] ascetic traditions from the middle of the 1st millennium BCE.&lt;ref name=Lochtefeld&gt;{{cite book|author1=James G. Lochtefeld|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: N-Z, Volume 2 of The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism|year=2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|page=639|ISBN=9780823922871|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6FsB3psOTIC&amp;pg=PA639}}&lt;/ref&gt; The śramaṇas were individual, experiential and free-form traditions.&lt;ref name=Lochtefeld/&gt; The term "śramaṇas" is used sometimes to contrast them with "Brahmins" in terms of their religious models.&lt;ref name=Lochtefeld/&gt; Part of the śramaṇa tradition retained their distinct identity from Hinduism by rejecting the [[pramana|epistemic]] authority of the [[Vedas]], while a part of the śramaṇa tradition became part of Hinduism as one stage in the [[Ashrama (stage)|Ashrama]] dharma, that is as renunciate [[sannyasa|sannyasin]]s.&lt;ref name=Lochtefeld/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.

Pali ''samaṇa'' has been suggested as the ultimate origin of the word [[Evenki language|Evenki]] [[wikt:саман#Evenki|сама̄н]] (''samān'') "shaman", possibly via [[Middle Chinese]] or [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian B]]; however, the etymology of this word, which is also found in other [[Tungusic languages]], is controversial (see {{slink|Shamanism|Etymology}}).&lt;!-- more sources can be found in an old version of the article, which contained a dedicated section that was removed in this edit: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%C5%9Arama%E1%B9%87a&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=476242445 --&gt;

==History==
{{PaliCanonSamanaViews}}
Several ''śramaṇa'' movements are known to have existed in India before the 6th century BCE (pre-Buddha, pre-Mahavira), and these influenced both the [[āstika and nāstika]] traditions of Indian philosophy.&lt;ref name=reginaldray247&gt;Reginald Ray (1999), Buddhist Saints in India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195134834}}, pages 237-240, 247-249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="andrew"&gt;Andrew J. Nicholson (2013), [[Unifying Hinduism|Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History]], Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231149877}}, Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} Martin Wiltshire states that the Śramaṇa tradition evolved in India over two phases, namely Paccekabuddha and Savaka phases, the former being the tradition of individual ascetic and latter of disciples, and that Buddhism and Jainism ultimately emerged from these as sectarian manifestations.&lt;ref name=wiltshire293&gt;Martin Wiltshire (1990), Ascetic Figures Before and in Early Buddhism, De Gruyter, {{ISBN|978-3110098969}}, page 293&lt;/ref&gt; These traditions drew upon already established Brahmanical concepts, states Wiltshire, to formulate their own doctrines.&lt;ref name=wiltshire226&gt;Martin Wiltshire (1990), Ascetic Figures Before and in Early Buddhism, De Gruyter, {{ISBN|978-3110098969}}, pages 226-227&lt;/ref&gt; Reginald Ray concurs that Śramaṇa movements already existed and were established traditions in pre-6th century BCE India, but disagrees with Wiltshire that they were nonsectarian before the arrival of Buddha.&lt;ref name=reginaldray247/&gt;

According to the [[Jain Agamas]] and the Buddhist [[Pāli Canon]], there were other śramaṇa leaders at the time of Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Some terms are common between Jainism and Buddhism, including:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;• Symbols: [[chaitya|caitya]], [[stupa|stūpa]], [[dharmacakra]]&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;• Terms: [[arihant (Jainism)]]/[[arhat (Buddhism)]], [[nirvana|{{IAST|nirvāṇa}}]], [[Sangha (Buddhism)|{{IAST|saṅgha}}]], [[acharya|ācārya]], Jina etc.&lt;br /&gt;The term ''pudgala'' is used by both but with completely different meanings.}} In the ''[[Mahaparinibbana Sutta|Mahāparinibbāna Sutta]]'' ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 16), a śramaṇa named Subhadda mentions:
{{quote|
...those ascetics, samaṇa and Brahmins who have orders and followings, who are teachers, well-known and famous as founders of schools, and popularly regarded as saints, like [[Purana Kassapa|Pūraṇa Kassapa]], [[Makkhali Gosala|Makkhali Gosāla]], [[Ajita Kesakambali|Ajita Kesakambalī]], [[Pakudha Kaccayana|Pakudha Kaccāyana]], [[Sanjaya Belatthiputta]] and Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta (Mahavira)...
|Digha Nikaya|16&lt;ref&gt;Walshe (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;268&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Relationship with Vedism===
[[Govind Chandra Pande]], a professor of Indian history, states in his 1957 study on the origins of Buddhism, that Śramaṇa was a "distinct and separate cultural and religious" tradition than the Vedic.&lt;ref name="Pande"&gt;{{citation|first=Govind|last= Pande|title=Studies in the Origins of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__1kiAonBzIC&amp;redir_esc=y| year=1957| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Reprint: 1995)|isbn=81-208-1016-3|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Patrick Olivelle]], a professor of Indology and known for his translations of major ancient Sanskrit works, states in his 1993 study that contrary to some representations, the original Śramaṇa tradition was a part of the Vedic one.{{sfn|Olivelle|1993|p=14}} He writes,

{{Quote|Sramana in that context obviously means a person who is in the habit of performing srama. Far from separating these seers from the vedic ritual tradition, therefore, śramaṇa places them right at the center of that tradition. Those who see them [Sramana seers] as non-Brahmanical, anti-Brahmanical, or even non-Aryan precursors of later sectarian ascetics are drawing conclusions that far outstrip the available evidence.

According to Olivelle, and other scholars such as Edward Crangle, the concept of Śramaṇa exists in the early [[Brahmanism|Brahmanical]] literature.{{sfn|Olivelle|1993|p=12 with footnote 20}}&lt;ref name=crangle30&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Fitzpatrick Crangle|title=The Origin and Development of Early Indian Contemplative Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HOzdcIxJy2sC&amp;pg=PA30 |year=1994|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-03479-1|pages=30 with footnote 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used in an adjectival sense for sages who lived a special way of life that the Vedic culture considered extraordinary. However, Vedic literature does not provide details of that life.{{sfn|Olivelle|1993|p=15}} The term did not imply any opposition to either Brahmins or householders. In all likelihood states Olivelle, during the Vedic era, neither did the Śramaṇa concept refer to an identifiable class, nor to ascetic groups as it does in later Indian literature.{{sfn|Olivelle|1993|pp=15-16}} Additionally, in the early texts, some pre-dating 3rd-century BCE ruler [[Ashoka]], the Brahmana and Śramaṇa are neither distinct nor opposed. The distinction, according to Olivelle, in later Indian literature "may have been a later semantic development possibly influenced by the appropriation of the latter term [Sramana] by Buddhism and Jainism".{{sfn|Olivelle|1993|p=12}} 

The Vedic society, states Olivelle, contained many people whose roots were non-Aryan who must have influenced the Aryan classes. However, it is difficult to identify and isolate these influences,{{sfn|Olivelle|1993|p=68, Quote: "It is obvious that vedic society contained large numbers of people whose roots were non-Aryan and that their customs and beliefs must have influenced the dominant Aryan classes. It is quite a different matter, however, to attempt to isolate non-Aryan customs, beliefs, or traits at a period a millennium or more removed from the initial Aryan migration."}} in part because the vedic culture not only developed from influences but also from its inner dynamism and socio-economic developments.{{sfn|Olivelle|1993|p=68, Quote: "The Brahmanical religion. furthermore, like any other historical phenomenon, developed and changed over time not only through external influences but also by its own inner dynamism and because of socio-economic changes, the radical nature of which we have already discussed. New elements in a culture, therefore, need not always be of foreign origin."}}

According to Bronkhorst, the sramana culture arose in "greater Magadha," which was Indo-European, but not Vedic. In this culture, Kshatriyas were placed higher than Brahmins, and it rejected Vedic authority and rituals.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|2007}}{{sfn|Long|2013|p=chapter II}}

===Pre-Buddhist śrāmana schools in Buddhist texts===
Pande attributes the origin of Buddhism, not entirely to the Buddha, but to a "great religious ferment" towards the end of the Vedic period when the Brahmanic and Sramanic traditions intermingled.&lt;ref name="Pande"/&gt;

The Buddhist text of the ''[[Samaññaphala Sutta]]'' identifies six pre-Buddhist śrāmana schools, identifying them by their leader. These six schools are represented in the text to have diverse philosophies, which according to Padmanabh Jaini, may be "a biased picture and does not give a true picture" of the Sramanic schools rivaling with Buddhism,&lt;ref name=Jaini_2001 /&gt;{{rp|57-60}}&lt;ref&gt;AL Basham (2009), History and Doctrines of the Ajivikas - a Vanished Indian Religion, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812048}}, pages 18-26&lt;/ref&gt;

#śrāmana movement of [[Purana Kassapa]] ([[Amoralism]]): believed in antinomian ethics. This ancient school asserted that there are no moral laws, nothing is moral or immoral, there is neither virtue nor sin.&lt;ref name=Jaini_2001 /&gt;{{rp|57-60}}&lt;ref&gt;AL Basham (2009), History and Doctrines of the Ajivikas - a Vanished Indian Religion, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812048}}, pages 80-93&lt;/ref&gt;
#śrāmana movement of [[Makkhali Gosala]] ([[Ajivika]]): believed in fatalism and determinism that everything is the consequence of nature and its laws. The school denied that there is free will, but believed that soul exists. Everything has its own individual nature, based on how one is constituted from elements. Karma and consequences are not due to free will, cannot be altered, everything is pre-determined, because of and including one's composition.&lt;ref name=Jaini_2001 /&gt;{{rp|57-60}}&lt;ref name="james22"/&gt;
#śrāmana movement of [[Ajita Kesakambali]] ([[Lokayata]]-[[Charvaka]]): believed in materialism. Denied that there is an after-life, any samsara, any karma, or any fruit of good or evil deeds. Everything including humans are composed of elemental matter, and when one dies one returns to those elements.&lt;ref name=Jaini_2001 /&gt;{{rp|57-60}}&lt;ref&gt;AL Basham (2009), History and Doctrines of the Ajivikas - a Vanished Indian Religion, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812048}}, pages 54-55&lt;/ref&gt;
#śrāmana movement of [[Pakudha Kaccayana]]: believed in [[atomism]]. Denied that there is a creator, knower. Believed that everything is made of seven basic building blocks that are eternal, neither created nor caused to be created. The seven blocks included earth, water, fire, air, happiness, pain and soul. All actions, including death is mere re-arrangement and interpenetration of one set of substances into another set of substances.&lt;ref name=Jaini_2001 /&gt;{{rp|57-60}}&lt;ref&gt;AL Basham (2009), History and Doctrines of the Ajivikas - a Vanished Indian Religion, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812048}}, pages 90-93&lt;/ref&gt;
#śrāmana movement of [[Mahavira]] ([[Jainism]]): believed in fourfold restraint, avoid all evil (see more below).&lt;ref name=Jaini_2001 /&gt;{{rp|57-60}}
#śrāmana movement of [[Sanjaya Belatthiputta]] ([[Ajñana]]): believed in absolute agnosticism. Refused to have any opinion either way about existence of or non-existence of after-life, karma, good, evil, free will, creator, soul, or other topics.&lt;ref name=Jaini_2001 /&gt;{{rp|57-60}}

The pre-Buddhist śrāmana movements were organized ''[[Sangha]]gani'' (order of monks and ascetics), according to the Buddhist ''Samaññaphala Sutta''. The six leaders above are described as a ''Sanghi'' (head of the order), ''Ganacariyo'' (teacher), ''Cirapabbajito'' (recluse), ''Yasassi and Neto'' (of repute and well known).&lt;ref name=Jaini_2001 /&gt;{{rp|60}}

===Jainism===
{{Further|History of Jainism}}
Jain literature too mentions Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla and Sañjaya Belaṭṭhaputta.{{refn|group=note|The Pali Canon is the only source for Ajita Kesakambalī and Pakudha Kaccāyana.}} During the life of Buddha, Mahavira and the Buddha were leaders of their śramaṇa orders. Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta refers to Mahāvīra.{{refn|group=note|In the Buddhist Pāli literature, these non-Buddhist ascetic leaders – including Mahavira – are also referred to as Titthiyas of Tīrthakas.}}

According to Pande, Jainas were same as the Niganthas mentioned in the Buddhist texts, and they were a well established sect when Buddha began preaching. He states, without identifying supporting evidence, that "[Jainas] appear to have belonged to the non-Vedic Munis and Sramanas who may have been ultimately connected with pre-Vedic civilization".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Govind|last= Pande|title=Studies in the Origins of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__1kiAonBzIC&amp;redir_esc=y| year=1957| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Reprint: 1995)|isbn=81-208-1016-3|page=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The śramaṇa system is believed by a majority of Jaina scholars to have been of independent origin and not a protest movement of any kind, were led by Jaina thinkers, and were pre-Buddhist and pre-Vedic.&lt;ref name=marwaha&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sonali Bhatt Marwaha|title=Colors Of Truth: Religion, Self And Emotions: Perspectives Of Hinduism, Buddhism.

Some scholars posit that the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] symbols may be related to later Jain statues, and the bull icon may have a connection to [[Rishabhanatha]].&lt;ref name=indianethics&gt;{{cite book|author1=Puruṣottama Bilimoria|author2=Joseph Prabhu|author3=Renuka M.

===Buddhism===
{{main|Buddhist monasticism}}
{{peoplepalicanon}}
It was as a śramaṇa that the Buddha left his father's palace and practised austerities.&lt;ref name=society&gt;{{cite book|author1=Buddhist Society (London, England)|title=The Middle way, Volumes 75-76|year=2000|publisher=The Society|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gautama Buddha]], after fasting nearly to death by starvation, regarded extreme austerities and self-mortification as useless or unnecessary in attaining enlightenment, recommending instead a "[[Middle Way]]" between the extremes of hedonism and self-mortification.&lt;ref name=randallcollins204&gt;Randall Collins (2000), The sociology of philosophies: a global theory of intellectual change, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674001879}}, page 204&lt;/ref&gt; [[Devadatta]], a cousin of Gautama, caused a split in the Buddhist [[sangha]] by demanding more rigorous practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boucher|first=Daniel|title=Bodhisattvas of the Forest and the Formation of the Mahayana|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|year=2008|page=47|ISBN=9780824828813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddhist movement chose a moderate ascetic lifestyle.&lt;ref name=randallcollins204/&gt; This was in contrast to Jains, who continued the tradition of stronger austerity, such as fasting and giving away all property including clothes and thus going naked, emphasizing that complete dedication to spirituality includes turning away from material possessions and any cause for evil [[karma]].&lt;ref name=randallcollins204/&gt; The moderate ascetic precepts, states Collins, likely appealed to more people and widened the base of people wanting to become Buddhists.&lt;ref name=randallcollins204/&gt; Buddhism also developed a code for interaction of world-pursuing [[Upāsaka and Upāsikā|lay people]] and world-denying [[Buddhist monasticism|Buddhist monastic communities]], which encouraged continued relationship between the two.&lt;ref name=randallcollins204/&gt; Collins states, for example, that two rules of the [[vinaya]] (monastic code) were that a person could not join a monastic community without parent's permission, and that at least one son remained with each family to care for that family.&lt;ref name=randallcollins204/&gt; Buddhism also combined the continuing interaction, such as giving alms to renunciants, in terms of merit gained for good rebirth and good karma by the lay people. This code played a historic role in its growth, and provided a means for reliable alms (food, clothing) and social support for Buddhism.&lt;ref name=randallcollins204/&gt;

[[Randall Collins]] states that Buddhism was more a reform movement within the educated religious classes, composed mostly of Brahmins, rather than a rival movement from outside these classes.&lt;ref name="collins2000p205"/&gt; In early Buddhism, the largest number of monastics were originally [[brahmin]]s, and virtually all were recruited from the two upper classes of society – brahmins and [[kshatriya]]s.&lt;ref name="collins2000p205"&gt;Randall Collins (2000), The sociology of philosophies: a global theory of intellectual change, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674001879}}, page 205&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Randall Collins: "Thus, although the Buddha himself was a kshatriya the largest number of monks in the early movement were of Brahman origin. In principle, the Sangha was open to any caste; and since it was outside the ordinary world, caste had no place in it. Nevertheless, virtually all monks were recruited from the upper two classes. The biggest source of lay support, however, the ordinary donor of alms, were the landowning farmers."&lt;ref name="collins2000p205" /&gt;}}

===Ājīvika===
[[Ājīvika]] was founded in the 5th century BCE by [[Makkhali Gosala]], as a śramaṇa movement and a major rival of [[early Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey D Long (2009), Jainism: An Introduction, Macmillan, {{ISBN|978-1845116255}}, page 199&lt;/ref&gt; Ājīvikas were organised renunciates who formed discrete communities.&lt;ref&gt;AL Basham (1951), History and Doctrines of the Ajivikas -  a Vanished Indian Religion, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812048}}, pages 145-146&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ājīvikas reached the height of their prominence in the late 1st millennium BCE, then declined, yet continued to exist in south India until the 14th Century CE, as evidenced by inscriptions found in southern India.&lt;ref name=james22/&gt;&lt;ref name=philtarajiv&gt;[http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/hindu/ascetic/ajiv.html Ajivikas] World Religions Project, [[University of Cumbria]], United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient texts of Buddhism and Jainism mention a city in the first millennium BCE named Savatthi (Sanskrit ''[[Shravasti|Śravasti]]'') as the hub of the Ājīvikas; it was located in what is now the [[North India]]n state of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. In later part of the common era, inscriptions suggests that the Ājīvikas had a significant presence in the [[South India]]n state of [[Karnataka]] and the Kolar district of [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref name=philtarajiv/&gt;

Original scriptures of the Ājīvika school of philosophy once existed, but these are unavailable and probably lost. Their theories are extracted from mentions of Ājīvikas in the secondary sources of ancient Indian literature.&lt;ref name=bashamintro&gt;AL Basham (2009), History and Doctrines of the Ajivikas -  a Vanished Indian Religion, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812048}}, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars question whether Ājīvika philosophy has been fairly and completely summarized in these secondary sources, written by ancient Buddhist and Jaina scholars, who represented competing and adversarial philosophies to Ājīvikas.&lt;ref name=dundas&gt;Paul Dundas (2002), The Jains (The Library of Religious Beliefs and Practices), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415266055}}, pages 28-30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict between śramaṇa movements===
According to the 2nd century CE text ''[[Ashokavadana]]'', the Mauryan emperor [[Bindusara]] was a patron of the Ajivikas, and it reached its peak of popularity during this time. ''[[Ashokavadana]]'' also mentions that Bindusara's son [[Ashoka]] converted to Buddhism, became enraged at a picture that depicted Buddha in negative light, and issued an order to kill all the Ajivikas in [[Pundravardhana]]. Around 18,000 followers of the Ajivika sect were executed as a result of this order.&lt;ref name="John1989"&gt;{{cite book | author=John S. Strong | authorlink = John S.

Jaina texts mention separation and conflict between Mahavira and Gosala, accusation of contemptuous comments, and an occasion where the Jaina and Ajivika monastic orders "came to blows".&lt;ref&gt;John McKay et al, A History of World Societies, Combined Volume, 9th Edition, Macmillan, {{ISBN|978-0312666910}}, page 76&lt;/ref&gt; However, given the texts alleging conflict and portraying Ajivikas and Gosala in negative light were written centuries after the incident by their śramaṇa opponents, and given the versions in Buddhist and Jaina texts are different, the reliability of these stories, states Basham, is questionable.&lt;ref&gt;AL Basham (2009), History and Doctrines of the Ajivikas - a Vanished Indian Religion, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812048}}, pages 62-66, 88-89, 278&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

===Jain philosophy===
{{Jainism}}
{{Main|Jain philosophy}}
{{Further|Anekantavada|Syādvāda|Jainism and non-creationism}}
[[Jainism]] derives its philosophy from the teachings and lives of the twenty-four [[Tirthankara]]s, of whom [[Mahavira]] was the last. [[Acharya]]s [[Umaswati]], [[Kundakunda]], [[Haribhadra]], {{IAST|[[Yashovijaya|Yaśovijaya Gaṇi]]}} and others further developed and reorganized [[Jain philosophy]] in its present form. The distinguishing features of Jain philosophy are its belief in the independent existence of soul and matter, predominance of [[Karma in Jainism|karma]], [[Jainism and non-creationism|the denial of a creative and omnipotent God]], belief in an [[Jain cosmology|eternal and uncreated universe]], a strong emphasis on [[ahimsa in Jainism|nonviolence]], an accent on [[anekantavada]] and morality and ethics based on [[moksha (Jainism)|liberation of the soul]]. The Jain philosophy of [[anekantavada]] and [[syādvāda]], which posits that the truth or reality is perceived differently from different points of view, and that no single point of view is the complete truth, have made very important contributions to ancient [[Indian philosophy]], especially in the areas of skepticism and relativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Thomas | last=McEvilley | title=The Shape of Ancient Thought | publisher=Allworth Communications | year=2002 | isbn=1-58115-203-5 | page=335 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage in Jain texts===
[[Jain monasticism|Jain monastics]] are known as śramaṇas while lay practitioners are called [[śrāvaka]]s. The religion or code of conduct of the monks is known as the śramaṇa dharma. Jain canons like ''[[Acharanga Sutra|Ācāranga Sūtra]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jacobi | first =Hermann | title =Ācāranga Sūtra, Jain Sutras Part I, Sacred Books of the East, Vol. 22. | year =1884 | url =http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/sbe22/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other later texts contain many references to Sramanas.

====''Ācāranga Sūtra''====
One verse of the ''Ācāranga sūtra'' defines a good śramaṇa:
{{quote|Disregarding (all calamities) he lives together with clever monks, insensitive to pain and pleasure, not hurting the movable and immovable (beings), not killing, bearing all: so is described the great sage, a good Sramana.&lt;ref&gt;''Ācāranga Sūtra''. 1097&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The chapter on renunciation contains a śramaṇa vow of non-possession:
{{quote|I shall become a śramaṇa who owns no house, no property, no sons, no cattle, who eats what others give him; I shall commit no sinful action; Master, I renounce to accept anything that has not been given.' Having taken such vows, (a mendicant) should not, on entering a village or free town, take himself, or induce others to take, or allow others to take, what has not been given.&lt;ref&gt;''Ācāranga Sūtra'', 799&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''Ācāranga Sūtra'' gives three names of Mahavira, the twenty fourth [[Tirthankara]], one of which was ''Śramaṇa'':

{{quote|The Venerable ascetic Mahavira belonged to the ''Kasyapa [[gotra]]''. His three names have thus been recorded by tradition: by his parents he was called ''Vardhamana'', because he is devoid of love and hate; (he is called) Sramana (i.e. ascetic), because he sustains dreadful dangers and fears, the noble nakedness, and the miseries of the world; the name Venerable Ascetic '''Mahavira''' has been given to him by the gods.&lt;ref&gt;''Ācāranga Sūtra'' 954&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Sūtrakrtanga====
Another Jain canon, ''[[Sutrakritanga|Sūtrakrtanga]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jacobi | first =Hermann | editor =(ed.) Max Müller | title =Jaina Sutras, Part II : Sūtrakrtanga | publisher =The Clarendon Press | year =1895 | location =Oxford | url =http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/sbe45/index.htm | series =Sacred Books of the East, Vol. 45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the śramaṇa as an ascetic who has taken [[Mahavrata]], the five great vows:

{{quote|He is a Śramaṇa for this reason that he is not hampered by any obstacles, that he is free from desires, (abstaining from) property, killing, telling lies, and sexual intercourse; (and from) wrath, pride, deceit, greed, love, and hate: thus giving up every passion that involves him in sin, (such as) killing of beings. (Such a man) deserves the name of a Śramaṇa, who subdues (moreover) his senses, is well qualified (for his task), and abandons his body.&lt;ref&gt;''Sūtrakrtanga'', Book 1: 16.3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''Sūtrakrtanga'' records that a prince, [[Ardraka]], who became disciple to Mahavira, arguing with other heretical teachers, told [[Makkhali Gosala]] the qualities of śramaṇas:

{{quote|He who (teaches) the great vows (of monks) and the five small vows (of the laity 3), the five Âsravas and the stoppage of the Âsravas, and control, who avoids Karman in this blessed life of Śramaṇas, him I call a Śramaṇa.&lt;ref&gt;''Sūtrakrtanga'', Book 2: 6.6&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Buddhist philosophy===
{{Main|Buddhist philosophy}}
Buddha initially practiced severe austerities, fasting himself nearly to death of starvation. However, he later considered extreme austerities and self-mortification as unnecessary and recommended a "Middle Way" between the extremes of hedonism and self-mortification.&lt;ref name=randallcollins204/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laumakis, Stephen. ''An Introduction to Buddhist philosophy''. 2008. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brahmajāla Sutta mentions many śramaṇas with whom Buddha disagreed.&lt;ref name=venkata&gt;{{cite book|author1=N. Venkata Ramanayya|title=An essay on the origin of the South Indian temple|year=1930|publisher=Methodist Publishing House|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in contrast to Sramanic Jains whose philosophical premise includes the existence of an ''Atman'' (self, soul) in every being, Buddhist philosophy denies that there is any self or soul.&lt;ref name=laumakis125&gt;Stephen J Laumakis (2008), An Introduction to Buddhist Philosophy, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521689779}}, pages 125-134, 271-272&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=5sources/&gt; This concept called ''Anatta'' (or ''Anatman'') is a part of ''Three Marks of existence'' in Buddhist philosophy, the other two being ''Dukkha'' (suffering) and ''Anicca'' (impermanence).&lt;ref name=laumakis125/&gt; According to Buddha, states Laumakis, everything lacks inherent existence.&lt;ref name=laumakis125/&gt; [[Buddhism]] is a [[Nontheism|non-theistic]] philosophy, which is especially concerned with [[pratītyasamutpāda]] (dependent origination) and [[śūnyatā]] (emptiness or nothingness).&lt;ref name=laumakis125/&gt;

From rock edicts, it is found that both Brahmans as well as śramaṇas enjoyed equal sanctity.&lt;ref name=jstor&gt;{{cite book|author=Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain &amp; Ireland |title=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|year=1850|publisher=Lyon Public Library|page=241|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-AQlfBOL5rgC&amp;pg=PA241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ajivika philosophy===
The Ājīvika school is known for its ''Niyati'' doctrine of absolute determinism, the premise that there is no free will, that everything that has happened, is happening and will happen is entirely preordained and a function of cosmic principles.&lt;ref name=james22&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Ajivika", The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bashamintro/&gt; Ājīvika considered the [[karma]] doctrine as a fallacy.&lt;ref name=philtarajiv/&gt; Ajivika [[metaphysics]] included a theory of atoms similar to the [[Vaisheshika]] school, where everything was composed of atoms, qualities emerged from aggregates of atoms, but the aggregation and nature of these atoms was predetermined by cosmic forces.&lt;ref name=bashamatomism&gt;AL Basham (2009), History and Doctrines of the Ajivikas -  a Vanished Indian Religion, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812048}}, pages 262-270&lt;/ref&gt; Ājīvikas were atheists&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Quack (2014), The Oxford Handbook of Atheism (Editors: Stephen Bullivant, Michael Ruse), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199644650}}, page 654&lt;/ref&gt; and rejected the epistemic authority of the [[Vedas]], but they believed that in every living being is an ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]]'' – a central premise of Hinduism and Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;Analayo (2004), Satipaṭṭhāna: The Direct Path to Realization, {{ISBN|978-1899579549}}, pages 207-208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AL Basham (1951), History and Doctrines of the Ajivikas -  a Vanished Indian Religion, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812048}}, pages 240-261, 270-273&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison of philosophies===
The ''śramaṇa'' traditions subscribed to diverse philosophies, significantly disagreeing with each other as well as orthodox Hinduism and its six schools of [[Hindu philosophy]]. The differences ranged from a belief that every individual has a soul (self, atman) to asserting that there is no soul,&lt;ref name=Jaini_2001 /&gt;{{rp|119}}&lt;ref name=5sources/&gt; from axiological merit in a frugal ascetic life to that of a hedonistic life, from a belief in rebirth to asserting that there is no rebirth.&lt;ref name=collins&gt;{{cite book|author1=Randall Collins|title=The sociology of philosophies: a global theory of intellectual change|year=2000|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=199–200|isbn=9780674001879|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2HS1DOZ35EgC&amp;pg=PA199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A denial of the epistemic authority of the Vedas and Upanishads was one of the several differences between Sramanic philosophies and orthodox Hinduism.&lt;ref name=jaini47/&gt; Jaini states that while authority of vedas, belief in a creator, path of ritualism and social system of heredity ranks, made up the cornerstones of Brahminal schools, the path of ascetic self-motification was the main characteristic of all the Sramanic schools.&lt;ref name=Jaini_2001 /&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to Rahul Sankrityayan, the 7th-century CE Buddhist scholar [[Dharmakirti]] wrote:&lt;ref name=jaini47&gt;{{cite book|author1=Padmanabh S.

The unquestioned authority of the vedas; the belief in a world-creator; the quest for purification through ritual bathings; the arrogant division into castes; the practice of mortification to atone for sin; - these five are the marks of the crass stupidity of witless men. - Translated by Rahul Sankrityayan&lt;br&gt;
Belief in the authority of the Vedas, and in a creator, desiring merit from bathing, pride in caste, and practicising self denial for the eradication of sins - these five are the marks of stupidity of one whose intelligence is damaged. - Translated by Ramkrishna Bhattacharya&lt;ref&gt;Ramkrishna Bhattacharya (June 2015), Cārvāka Miscellany II, Journal of Indian Council of Philosophical Research, Volume 32, Issue 2, pages 199-210&lt;/ref&gt;{{underdiscussion-inline|talk=Philosophy_section}}}}

In some cases when the Sramanic movements shared the same philosophical concepts, the details varied. In Jainism, for example, Karma is based on materialist element philosophy, where Karma is the fruit of one's action conceived as material particles which stick to a soul and keep it away from natural omniscience.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt; The Buddha conceived Karma as a chain of causality leading to attachment of the material world and hence to rebirth.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt; The Ajivikas were fatalists and elevated Karma as inescapable fate, where a person's life goes through a chain of consequences and rebirths until it reaches its end.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt; Other śramaṇa movements such as those led by Pakkudha Kaccayana and Purana Kashyapa, denied the existence of Karma.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt;

==Influences on Indian culture==
The śramaṇa traditions influenced and were influenced by Hinduism and by each other.&lt;ref name="Flood, Gavin 2003. pg. 273-4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gavinflood76&gt;Gavin D. Flood (1996), An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521438780}}, page 76-78&lt;/ref&gt; According to some scholars,&lt;ref name="Flood, Gavin 2003. pg. 273-4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gavin D. Flood (1996), An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-43878-0}}, page 86, Quote: "It is very possible that the karmas and reincarnation entered the mainstream brahaminical thought from the śramaṇa or the renouncer traditions."&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of the cycle of birth and death, the concept of [[samsara]] and the concept of liberation may quite possibly be from śramaṇa or other [[Sannyasa|ascetic]] traditions. Obeyesekere&lt;ref&gt;G Obeyesekere (2002), Imagining Karma - Ethical Transformation in Amerindian, Buddhist, and Greek Rebirth, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520232433}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that tribal sages in the [[Ganges]] valley may instead have inspired the ideas of samsara and liberation, just like rebirth ideas that emerged in Africa and Greece. O'Flaherty states that there isn't enough objective evidence to support any of these theories.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy D O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, pages xi-xxvi&lt;/ref&gt;

It is in the Upanishadic period that Sramanic theories influence the Brahmanical theories.&lt;ref name=Jaini_2001/&gt;{{rp|50}} While the concepts of [[Brahman]] and [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (Soul, Self) can be consistently traced back to pre-Upanishadic layers of Vedic literature, the heterogeneous nature of the Upanishads show infusions of both social and philosophical ideas, pointing to evolution of new doctrines, likely from the Sramanic movements.&lt;ref name=Jaini_2001/&gt;{{rp|49–56}}

Śramaṇa traditions brought concepts of Karma and Samsara as central themes of debate.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt; Śramaṇa views were influential to all schools of Indian philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin D. (1996) p. 86-90&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts, such as karma and reincarnation may have originated in the śramaṇa or the renunciant traditions, and then become mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin D. Flood (1996), An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press : UK {{ISBN|0-521-43878-0}} P. 86&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple theories of possible origins of concepts such as [[Ahimsa]], or non-violence.&lt;ref name=indianethics/&gt; The [[Chāndogya Upaniṣad]], dated to about the 7th century BCE, in verse 8.15.1, has the earliest evidence for the use of the word ''Ahimsa'' in the sense familiar in Hinduism (a code of conduct). It bars violence against "all creatures" (''sarvabhuta'') and the practitioner of Ahimsa is said to escape from the cycle of [[metempsychosis]] (CU 8.15.1).&lt;ref name=indianethics/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uno Tähtinen (1976), Ahimsa: Non-Violence in Indian Tradition, London, {{ISBN|0-09-123340-2}}, pages 2–5&lt;/ref&gt; According to some scholars, such as D. R. Bhandarkar, the Ahimsa dharma of the Sramanas made an impression on the followers of Brahamanism and their law books and practices.&lt;ref&gt;By D. R. Bhandarkar, 1989 "Some Aspects of Ancient Indian Culture" Asian Educational Services 118 pages {{ISBN|81-206-0457-1}} p. 80-81&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories on who influenced whom, in ancient India, remains a matter of scholarly debate, and it is likely that the different philosophies contributed to each other's development. Doniger summarizes the historic interaction between scholars of Vedic Hinduism and Sramanic Buddhism:

{{Quote|
There was such constant interaction between Vedism and Buddhism in the early period that it is fruitless to attempt to sort out the earlier source of many doctrines, they lived in one another's pockets, like Picasso and Braque (who, in later years, were unable to say which of them had painted certain paintings from their earlier, shared period).
|Wendy Doniger|&lt;ref&gt;Wendy D. O'Flaherty (1980), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039230}}, pp xvii-xviii&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Hinduism===
[[Randall Collins]] states that "the basic cultural framework for lay society which eventually became Hinduism" was laid down by Buddhism.&lt;ref name="collins2000p205"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Randall Collins: "Buddhism laid down the basic cultural framework for lay society which eventually became Hinduism. Buddhism cannot be understood as a reaction against the caste system, any more than it is simply an effort to escape from karma."&lt;ref name="collins2000p205" /&gt;}}

Modern [[Hinduism]] can be regarded as a combination of Vedic and śramaṇa traditions as it is substantially influenced by both traditions. Among the [[Astika]] schools of Hinduism, [[Vedanta]], [[Samkhya]], and [[Yoga]] philosophies influenced and were influenced by the śramaṇa philosophy. As Geoffrey Samuel notes, 
{{quote|Our best evidence to date suggests that [yogic practice] developed in the same ascetic circles as the early śramaṇa movements (Buddhists, Jainas and Ajivikas), probably in around the sixth and fifth centuries BCE.{{sfn|Samuel|2008|p=8}}}}

Some Brahmins joined the śramaṇa movement such as [[Chanakya|Cānakya]] and [[Sariputta|Sāriputta]].&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), pp.&amp;nbsp;10–11, 13&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a group of eleven Brahmins accepted Jainism and become Mahavira's chief disciples or [[ganadhara]]s.&lt;ref name=Jaini_2001 /&gt;{{rp|64}}{{refn|group=note|"Mahavira, it is said, proceeded to a place in the neighbourhood where a big yagna was being organized by a brahman, Somilacharya, and preached his first sermon denouncing the sacrifice and converting eleven learned Brahmins assembled there who became his chief disciples called ganadharas."&lt;ref name=Jaini_2001 /&gt;}}

Patrick Olivelle suggests that the Hindu [[Ashrama (stage)|ashrama]] system of life, created probably around the 4th-century BCE, was an attempt to institutionalize renunciation within the Brahmanical social structure.&lt;ref name=patrickolivelle278&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2005), ''The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism'' (Editor: Flood, Gavin), Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|978-1405132510}}, pages 277-278&lt;/ref&gt; This system gave complete freedom to adults to choose what they want to do, whether they want to be householders or [[sannyasa|sannyasins]] (ascetics), the monastic tradition was a voluntary institution.&lt;ref name=patrickolivelle278/&gt; This voluntary principle, states Olivelle, was the same principle found in Buddhist and Jain monastic orders at that time.&lt;ref name=patrickolivelle278/&gt;

==In Western literature==
Various possible references to "śramaṇas", with the name more or less distorted, have appeared in ancient Western literature.

===Clement of Alexandria (150-211)===
[[Clement of Alexandria]] makes several mentions of the śramaṇas, both in the context of the Bactrians and the Indians:
{{quote|Thus philosophy, a thing of the highest utility, flourished in antiquity among the barbarians, shedding its light over the nations. And afterwards it came to [[Greece]]. First in its ranks were the prophets of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]]; and the [[Chaldea]]ns among the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]; and the [[Druids]] among the [[Gauls]]; and the '''Samanaeans''' among the [[Bactrians]] ("Σαμαναίοι Βάκτρων"); and the philosophers of the [[Celts]]; and the [[Magi]] of the [[Persia]]ns, who foretold the Saviour's birth, and came into the land of [[Judea|Judaea]] guided by a star. The Indian gymnosophists are also in the number, and the other barbarian philosophers. And of these there are two classes, some of them called ''Sarmanae'' ("Σαρμάναι"), and [[Brahmins|Brahmanae]] ("Βραχμαναι").&lt;ref&gt;Clement of Alexandria, "Strom." [Book 1, Ch 15]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Porphyry (233-305)===
[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] extensively describes the habits of the śramaṇas, whom he calls "Samanaeans", in his "On Abstinence from Animal Food" Book IV {{ref|Porphyry}}. He says his information was obtained from "the [[Babylonia]]n [[Bardesanes]], who lived in the times of our fathers, and was familiar with those [[India]]ns who, together with Damadamis, were sent to [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]."{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

{{quote|For the polity of the [[India]]ns being distributed into many parts, there is one tribe among them of men divinely wise, whom the [[Greeks]] are accustomed to call [[Gymnosophists]]. But of these there are two sects, over one of which the [[Brahmins]] preside, but over the other the Samanaeans. The race of the [[Brahmins]], however, receive divine wisdom of this kind by succession, in the same manner as the priesthood. But the Samanaeans are elected, and consist of those who wish to possess divine knowledge.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Porphyry, [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_abstinence_04_book4.htm ''On abstinence from animal food''], Book IV.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

;On entering the order:
{{quote|All the [[Brahmins|Bramins]] originate from one stock; for all of them are derived from one father and one mother. But the Samanaeans are not the offspring of one family, being, as we have said, collected from every nation of Indians. A Bramin, however, is not a subject of any government, nor does he contribute any thing together with others to government.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;}}

{{quote|The Samanaeans are, as we have said, elected. When, however, any one is desirous of being enrolled in their order, he proceeds to the rulers of the city; but abandons the city or village that he inhabited, and the wealth and all the other property that he possessed. Having likewise the superfluities of his body cut off, he receives a garment, and departs to the Samanaeans, but does not return either to his wife or children, if he happens to have any, nor does he pay any attention to them, or think that they at all pertain to him. And, with respect to his children indeed, the king provides what is necessary for them, and the relatives provide for the wife. And such is the life of the Samanaeans. But they live out of the city, and spend the whole day in conversation pertaining to divinity. They have also houses and temples, built by the king, in which they are stewards, who receive a certain emolument from the king, for the purpose of supplying those that dwell in them with nutriment. But their food consists of rice, bread, autumnal fruits, and pot-herbs. And when they enter into their house, the sound of a bell being the signal of their entrance, those that are not Samanaeans depart from it, and the Samanaeans begin immediately to pray.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;}}

;On food and living habits:
{{Quote|And with respect to those that are philosophers, among these some dwell on mountains, and others about the river Ganges. And those that live on mountains feed on autumnal fruits, and on cows' milk coagulated with herbs. But those that reside near the [[Ganges]], live also on autumnal fruits, which are produced in abundance about that river. The land likewise nearly always bears new fruit, together with much rice, which grows spontaneously, and which they use when there is a deficiency of autumnal fruits. But to taste of any other nutriment, or, in short, to touch animal food, is considered by them as equivalent to extreme impurity and impiety. And this is one of their dogmas. They also worship divinity with piety and purity. They spend the day, and the greater part of the night, in hymns and prayers to the Gods; each of them having a cottage to himself, and living, as much as possible, alone. For the Bramins cannot endure to remain with others, nor to speak much; but when this happens to take place, they afterwards withdraw themselves, and do not speak for many days. They likewise frequently fast.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;}}

;On life and death:
{{quote|They are so disposed with respect to death, that they unwillingly endure the whole time of the present life, as a certain servitude to nature, and therefore they hasten to liberate their souls from the bodies [with which they are connected]. Hence, frequently, when they are seen to be well, and are neither oppressed, nor driven to desperation by any evil, they depart from life.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;}}

==In contemporary Western culture==
German novelist [[Hermann Hesse]], long interested in Eastern, especially Indian, spirituality, wrote ''[[Siddhartha (novel)|Siddhartha]]'', in which the main character becomes a Samana upon leaving his home (where he was a [[Kshatriya]]).&lt;ref&gt;Samuel, Geoffrey (2010), The Origins of Yoga and Tantra.
