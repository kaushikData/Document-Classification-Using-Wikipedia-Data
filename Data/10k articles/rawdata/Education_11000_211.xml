'''Aluka''' was an [[Internet|online]] [[digital library]] focusing on materials about [[Africa]]. Aluka's mission is to connect scholars from around the world by building a common platform that allows online collaboration and knowledge sharing. Aluka's audience is higher education and research communities worldwide.

Aluka is an initiative of [[Ithaka Harbors]], which is a non profit organization that has a mission of incubating promising new projects that support the use of technology for the benefit of higher education.  An assumption of the incubation process is that successful projects will eventually become independent or join larger, existing organizations serving the academic community.  In June 2008, the Ithaka and JSTOR Trustees approved a recommendation that the Aluka initiative be integrated into JSTOR.

Founded in 2003, Aluka was an initiative of Ithaka, a [[non-profit organization]] based in [[New York City]] and [[Princeton, New Jersey]].  The initial funding was provided by the [[Mellon Foundation]], the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]], and the [[Stavros Niarchos|Stavros S. Niarchos]] Foundation.

The first release of Aluka took place in early February 2007 with preview access to [[JSTOR]] subscribers. In Africa, Aluka is free to all academic and other not-for-profit institutions.

The name 'Aluka' is derived from a [[Zulu language|Zulu]] word meaning 'to weave'.

Aluka seeks to attract other collections of scholarly interest from institutions and individuals worldwide. By bringing materials together, Aluka creates new opportunities for research and collaboration.  Documents and materials that were previously hard or impossible to access are now available for researchers around the world.

==Content==
Initial focus of Aluka digital library is in three major areas:
* '''African Plants''': Collection of African plants specimens and related materials contributed by the African Plants Initiative. Migrated to JSTOR.
* '''[http://www.aluka.org/heritage Cultural Heritage]''': Collection of images, documents and [[3D computer graphics|3D]] models documenting African [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] sites, including Timbuktu, Djenne, Lalibela, Kilwa Kisiwani, Lamu, and Elmina.  This content area also includes a large collection of African Rock Art from many African nations. 
* '''[http://www.aluka.org/struggles Struggles for Freedom]''': Documents, images and other materials documenting the liberation struggles in Southern Africa, including those from [[Angola]], [[Botswana]], [[Mozambique]], [[Namibia]], [[South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2262">The '''Australia-Indonesia Youth Exchange Program''' (AIYEP) is an exchange program which aims to provide opportunities for young Australians and Indonesians through social, professional and cultural exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Australia-Indonesia Institute |title=Advice to Applicants |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/aii/scholarship_program/advice_applicants.html |accessdate=8 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918013929/http://www.dfat.gov.au/aii/scholarship_program/advice_applicants.html |archivedate=18 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program sees 18 Indonesian participants (9 male, 9 female) aged between 21-25 undertake professional development activities in an Australian state or territory to experience through a rural and urban phase. Then after two months, they meet their Australian counterparts - and together they travel to Indonesia where they undertake a similar experience in an Indonesian province as a group of 36. In Indonesia they experience both a [[rural]] [[Home stay|village-stay]] and an [[urban area|urban]] environment.

== History ==
The program was established in 1981 and is an initiative of the Australia-Indonesia Institute ([[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About AIYEP|work=The Communications Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10485">'''Baby videos''' are educational tools which can be used for teaching [[Baby|babies]] as young as six months by introducing the [[alphabet]], different sights, [[Shape|shapes]] and [[Color|colors]], [[Number|numbers]] and [[counting]]. Baby videos can be used for helping babies learn important educational skills, comprehension, introduction to the environment, as well as [[music]]. Some parents use baby videos to help develop their children's [[motor skills]] and open their young minds to the world. Certain [[Preschool|preschools]], educators and caregivers find baby videos to be a useful tool, but medical professionals have yet to determine whether or not baby videos are beneficial to children or not.

Several baby videos are available on the market today. They include videos which introduce letters, music videos, or videos that teach babies to communicate when they are young such as signing videos.

The biggest benefit of digital media on children is the ability to expose children to the world during their “Why?” phase. Digital media will help explain things to children that parents may not have the ability to.

== History ==
The earliest forms of entertainment for children were usually meant to be educational. The very first television program that was tailored to children specifically was the [[BBC]]’s [[The Children's Hour (TV program)|''Children’s Hour'']]'','' which was first broadcast in 1946&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/are-you-sitting-comfortably-a-history-of-childrens-tv-1335443.html|title=ARE YOU SITTING COMFORTABLY? A HISTORY OF CHILDREN'S TV|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States followed suit in 1947 by airing [[Kukla, Fran and Ollie|''Kukla, Fran, and Ollie,'']] a show featuring puppets which ran for 10 years''. [[Howdy Doody]]'' and [[Captain Kangaroo|''Captain Kangaroo'']] soon followed, and both ran for over 12 years. The shows that were being broadcast for children were successful, but not necessarily educational. Later on in the 1960’s and 1970’s, television shows for children began to change pace. Not only were the shows being released entertaining and loved by children, but they were also educational. Shows like [[Sesame Street|''Sesame Street,'']] [[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood|''Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood'']]'','' and [[Schoolhouse Rock!|''Schoolhouse Rock!'']] began to gain popularity&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wartella|first=Ellen|last2=Richert|first2=Rebekah A.|last3=Robb|first3=Michael B.|date=2010-06|title=Babies, television and videos: How did we get here?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dr.2010.03.008|journal=Developmental Review|volume=30|issue=2|pages=116–127|doi=10.1016/j.dr.2010.03.008|issn=0273-2297}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Engstrom|first=Erika|date=1995-07|title=Schoolhouse Rock: Cartoons as Education|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01956051.1995.9943695|journal=Journal of Popular Film and Television|volume=23|issue=3|pages=98–104|doi=10.1080/01956051.1995.9943695|issn=0195-6051}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fredrogers.org/fred-rogers/bio/index-test.php|title=Mister Rogers' Neighborhood: A History|website=www.fredrogers.org|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These shows’ target audiences were intended to be children in general without a specific age group.

In 1997 the [[Baby Einstein|Baby Einstein Company]] released its first video ''Baby Einstein''. This was the first educational video targeted specifically to infants. The release of this particular brand of educational videos was very successful, and impactful. The New York Times published in 2003 that 32% of all new babies born in the United States owned a ''Baby Einstein'' video.  There was a surge of educational media targeted towards infants and babies after the initial release of ''Baby Einstein''. Television shows such as ''[[Teletubbies]]'' and [[Classical Baby|''Classical Baby'']] were introduced. An entire television network dedicated to infant education called [[BabyFirst|Baby First TV]] was also created&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

Thousands of baby oriented educational videos can be found on [[YouTube|Youtube]], teaching lessons about shapes, colors, numbers, etc. to babies specifically. [[Mother Goose Club]] is a [[YouTube|Youtube channel]] devoted to educating infants and toddlers through the use of nursery rhymes. Mobile app developers have also seen the profitability of infant oriented media, and there are now hundreds of mobile applications specifically tailored to educate infants.  

== Impact ==
The educational videos babies are exposed to could actually be harming them. Exposing babies to screens, could take away time that could be used for other things like exploring, interacting, playing, and actively learning &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://zerotofive.net/parenting/pros-and-cons-of-screen-time/|title=Baby TV: Pros and cons of screen time {{!}} Zero to Five|date=2016-07-05|work=Zero to Five|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. During the first two years, babies are beginning to develop intellectual, social, and emotional skills that are needed in life. If used correctly, these videos could possibly benefit a child’s development. Babies are also learning language during the first two years which is a vital part of [[Child development|childhood development]]. Children could develop language skills by watching videos as they will begin to mimic the TV characters who talk to them&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.raisesmartkid.com/pre-natal-to-1-year-old/2-articles/22-the-effects-of-tv-on-baby|title=The Effects of TV on Baby - Raise Smart Kid|date=2015-08-25|work=Raise Smart Kid|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Some researchers say that babies rarely benefit from digital media exposure while others say it’s beneficial for their development. In some cases, babies show higher [[vocabulary]] from media. It’s difficult for parents to determine how much their child is actually learning from the videos&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.babycentre.co.uk/a25006035/is-screen-time-good-or-bad-for-babies-and-children|title=Is Screen Time Good or Bad for Babies and Children|last=|first=|date=11-16-2018|website=Baby Centre|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Criticism ==
The use of baby videos is not without criticism. Frederick Zimmerman and Dr. Dimitri Christakis of the [[University of Washington]] published a study in 2007 that called the positive learning effect of the videos questionable, and say that they may in fact limit the language learning abilities of toddlers.  They claim babies are drawn to the videos due to the rapid scene changes causing an [[orienting reflex]].

Studies have “found that children exposed to educational programs were more aggressive in their interactions.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2013/02/18/educationalmedia|title=It may be educational, but what is that TV show really teaching your preschooler? - News Service - Iowa State University|website=www.news.iastate.edu|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educational programs are not only introducing young children to pro-education and pro-social goals, but the conflict between characters is often depicted with characters being unkind to each other or using [[Aggression|aggressive]] actions with each other &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. The research claims that educational programs are by extension teaching these aggressive tendencies that are being shown in conflict development and that the young children are absorbing this information. This means while teaching them conflict resolution the shows are also teaching children how to behave while in a conflict, which in most cases is harsh and unkind.

Another aspect of educational programs focuses on how it takes away from the communicating opportunities between child and parent. A study shows the uses of [[book]] reading, [[toy]] playing, and co-tv viewing to study how well communication between parents and children were conducted. “Although not better than books, toy playing was significantly better than shared TV viewing at encouraging communication”. The study found that tv did not allow for much communication, but when there was communication it was relatively unrelated to what the toddler had asked or said. This is seen as a hindrance to the child’s chance to learn&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/turn-tv/201110/the-real-reason-why-tv-is-bad-the-kids|title=The Real Reason Why TV Is Bad for the Kids|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Educational programs are seen as a hindrance to young children in the aspect of learning due to the poor communication that is had between parent and child.

One study states that “until about age 2, studies show that young children can’t cognitively comprehend what’s being said and retain that information”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://healthland.time.com/2011/10/18/why-educational-tv-for-babies-doesnt-exist/|title=‘Educational TV’ for Babies? It Doesn’t Exist|last=Rochman|first=Bonnie|work=Time|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;. “[[Television]]-viewing also fosters less parent-child interaction, cutting down on what experts call “talk time,” in which a child hears lots of [[vocabulary]] words that in turn help develop their language abilities”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. With no educational value being learned before the age of two and the lack of “talk time” that comes with educational programs this research shows the underside of educational television.

'''Black snake''' (or '''Sugar snake''') and '''Pharaoh's serpent''' are two similar types of [[firework]].

After being lit, both fireworks begin to smoke and spew out ash resembling a snake via an [[intumescent]] reaction. They stay on the ground and do not emit sparks, flares, any form of projectiles, or any sound, but may release smoke.

[[Sodium bicarbonate]] which produces [[carbon dioxide]] gas, and [[sugar]] forming carbon containing ash, are common chemicals used for the black snake demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chemistry.about.com/od/chemistryhowtoguide/a/blacksnakes.htm |title=Black Snakes or Glow Worms |publisher=[[about.com]] |author= Anne Helmenstine, Ph.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources report the contents as "a nitrated mixture of [[linseed oil]] and [[naphthalene]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mailer.uwf.edu/listserv/wa.exe?A2=ind9707&amp;L=chemed-l&amp;D=1&amp;P=10432 |title=LISTSERV 15.0 - CHEMED-L Archives |publisher=Mailer.uwf.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913101119/http://mailer.uwf.edu/listserv/wa.exe?A2=ind9707&amp;L=chemed-l&amp;D=1&amp;P=10432 |archivedate=2006-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional "Pharaoh's serpent" version of this firework produces a more impressive snake, but its operation depends upon [[Mercury(II) thiocyanate|mercury (II) thiocyanate]], which is no longer commonly used because of its toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chemistry.about.com/b/2011/05/12/pharoahs-snake-firework-or-chemistry-demonstration.htm|title=Pharaoh's Snake Firework or Chemistry Demonstration|publisher=[[about.com]]|date=2011-05-12|accessdate=2011-10-20 |author= Anne Helmenstine, Ph.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp''' is a Michigan nonprofit organization located in the Manistee National Forest that provides summer fine arts camp and international exchange programs in music, art, dance, and drama.

The Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp was founded as a non-profit organization in 1966 by the Stansell family, who remain the multi-generational proprietors of the institution.&lt;ref name="Res253"&gt;Journal of the Senate of the State of Michigan, 1991 p.1414, Senate Resolution 253 of 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The camp is located on approximately 1200 acres in the [[Manistee National Forest]] in Michigan. It can host 4500 &lt;ref name="Jazz"&gt;Internationalidssmf Association for Jazz Education, Jazz Education Journal, 2001, NPN&lt;/ref&gt; 5th through 12th grade students across several 12-day sessions each summer.&lt;ref&gt;Instrumentalist Magazine, Volume 57, 2003, NPN&lt;/ref&gt; It operates FM radio stations&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;Bidgoli, Hossein, The Internet Encyclopedia, Volume 2, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Hoboken NJ, 2004, P.677&lt;/ref&gt; locally and in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] that are [[National Public Radio]] affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;Blue Lake website, http://www.bluelake.org&lt;/ref&gt; For Central campers, several options for fine arts are offered, including theater, band, choir, art, dance, and many others.

Blue Lake also offers adult camp programs. Rather than the rustic cabins of the camp, adult musicians find accommodation at local hotels.&lt;ref name="Dummies"&gt;Rapoport, Katharine, Violin for dummies, John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd., Canada / Consumer Dummies, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Like the youth programs, adult campers take part in daily instruction on their instrument as well as ensemble rehearsals. Access to the camp’s recreational, elective instructional, and regular concert programs is available to all ages as well.&lt;ref&gt;Strings Magazine, volume 3, String Letter Corp, 1988, P.57&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Exchange==

[[Image:BLIB W Locals81.gif|thumb|right|Blue Lake Students and Staff join with a town band in the Bavarian Alpine foothills.]]
Blue Lake hosts international exchange students in the arts as well as organizing several ensembles of American students to travel to Europe and perform each year. These ensembles include, but are not limited to, [[concert band]], [[jazz band]], [[orchestra]], and [[choir]].&lt;ref name="Jazz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the Senate of the State of Michigan 1979, pp1341-44&lt;/ref&gt; These exchanges serve to expose students to other cultures and have been cited as “outstanding representatives of the United States”.&lt;ref&gt;Senate Resolution 621 of 1979, Journal of the Massachusetts Senate, Volume 2, 1979, p.1734&lt;/ref&gt; The camp has also initiated such experiments in multi-cultural cooperation as the ''Blue Lake in Bavaria'' [[concert band]] which was formed out of a mixture of American and European junior and senior high school students to rehearse and perform together over the course of a month.&lt;ref&gt;Blue Lake in Bavaria International Exchange Program(brochure), Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leonard Falcone==

Prior to the founding of Blue Lake, [[Leonard Falcone]], [[Baritone Horn|baritone]] virtuoso and Director of Bands at [[Michigan State University]], had conducted many ''Youth Music at Michigan State'' summer camps in conjunction with, and support of, the Michigan School Band and Orchestra Association.&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia page and associated sources, [[Leonard Falcone]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Falcone Papers, collection of the Michigan State University Archives, East Lansing, MI&lt;/ref&gt; At the urging of Fritz Stansell, Falcone shifted his focus to aiding the program at Blue Lake and became a regular staff member/artist in residence.&lt;ref name="Stansel211"&gt;Stansell, Fritz, Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp, the Early Years, RDR Books, Muskegon, MI, 2007, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Falcone would be joined later by other notables of the music education and concert band world, such as composers [[John Barnes Chance]] and [[Václav Nelhýbel]].&lt;ref&gt;Stansell, Fritz, Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp, the Early Years, RDR Books, Muskegon, MI, 2007, P.101&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Falcone’s death in 1985, Blue Lake became home to the new [[Leonard Falcone International Tuba and Euphonium Festival]] and competition created by his students in his memory and held at Blue Lake every year. This has become a significant annual event in the international [[tuba]] and [[euphonium]] community and  is the leading American venue for these instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia page and associated sources, [[Leonard Falcone International Tuba and Euphonium Festival]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The School grew to offer a varied programme of practical and academic courses for young musicians and singers at the start of their professional career. Master classes have been taught by such distinguished visiting faculty members as [[Elisabeth Schwarzkopf]], [[Murray Perahia]] and [[Pierre Fournier]]. The successor of the school, the Britten–Pears Young Artist Programme, continues to provide training for outstanding young professionals from around the world and also manages courses for the [[Britten-Pears Orchestra]], formerly The Snape Maltings Training Orchestra.&lt;ref name=BPF/&gt;

Singers are auditioned for song recital courses, and recent courses have included American and French song with [[Dawn Upshaw]]. Singers and orchestra come together to perform opera; recent productions have included Death in Venice and Albert Herring, and in the autumn of 2012 soloists from the programme sang [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]]'s ''[[Les Mamelles de Tiresias]]'' in [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]]'s arrangement. At Easter 2012, the programme presented [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]]'s [[Dido and Aeneas]] under the direction of Christian Curnyn.

Each year there is a digital media course, called New Music/New Media.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aldeburgh.co.uk/bpp/new-music-new-media, accessed 16 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, the course was led by [[Rolf Wallin]], [[Tansy Davies]], and [[Alexander Refsum Jensenius]], co-founder of the [[Oslo Laptop Orchestra]]. String quartets come together each spring and present a weekly recital of "work-in-progress" at the Jubilee Hall, and in late summer the International Academy of String Quartets provides further opportunities for working on repertoire. Menahem Pressler, [[Pierre-Laurent Aimard]] and the [[Arditti Quartet]] have all taught masterclasses.

[[File:151-Karolina Müller-Svenska teatern 1.jpg|thumb|Karolina Müller]]
'''Caroline Frederikke Müller''' née ''Halle'' (5 February 1755 &amp;ndash; 17 November 1826) also known as '''Caroline Walther''', was a [[Denmark|Danish]] and later naturalized [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[opera singer]] ([[mezzo-soprano]]).  She was also active as an instructor at the ''[[Dramatens elevskola]]''.  She was a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Music]] and a ''[[Hovsångare]]''.

She was born as Caroline Halle, was known in Denmark as ''Caroline Walther'' (1774–80, during her first marriage) and known in Sweden as Caroline Müller (from 1780, after her second marriage).

==Life==
She was the illegitimate daughter of the ensign Christian Frederik Halle and Johanne Christine Hansdatter.  She was the half sister of the actor [[Ferdinand Lindgreen]].

===Career in Denmark===

Her stepfather Thomas Jespersen was a machinist at the [[Royal Danish Theatre]], and had her enrolled as a student in the [[Royal Danish Ballet]] in 1761, at the age of six.  Soon, she was also assigned small children's parts at the theater.  The theater had not yet an organized theater school, but she was tutored in declamation by [[Dorothea Biehl]] and drama by [[Lisbeth Cathrine Amalie Rose]].&lt;ref&gt;Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon&lt;/ref&gt;

She debuted as an actress at the age of thirteen in the role of Pernille in [[Ludvig Holberg]]'s ''Den Stundesløse'' in the season of 1768-69.  She made a success and soon became the leading [[soubrette]] actress of the theater.&lt;ref&gt;Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1771, she made a debut as an opera singer in the main female part of ''Tronfølgen i Sidon'' by [[Giuseppe Sarti]].  In 1773, the theater organized an opera school, and she was successfully educated in opera singing by [[Michel Angelo Potenza]].

In 1773 she left her abusive mother and the following year, she married the music director and secretary Thomas Christian Walther (1749-1788): the marriage ended in 1775 when he left Denmark, but she was thereafter known as Caroline Walther.

She performed over 124 roles at the opera theater: as a soubrette and tragedienne in theater productions, and in the female leads of the opera.  As an opera singer, she also participated in concerts at the royal Danish court.  She is considered to have had a great impact on the great age of Danish opera in the 1770s and has been referred to as the "perhaps greatest female stage artist" in Denmark at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon&lt;/ref&gt;   She was painted by [[Jens Juel (painter)|Jens Juel]], praised by the poet [[Johannes Ewald]] and the ''[[Det norske Selskab]]'', and the critic [[Peder Rosenstand-Goiske]] wrote: "The fire and emotion, that she understands to give her action, reveal the great genius of her mind."&lt;ref&gt;Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1777, general H. H. von Eickstedt became director of the Royal Danish Theatre.  von Eickstedt reportedly undermined her position because her wished to benefit the career of his lover, [[Catharine Frydendahl]], and it is noted how he gave the role in ''Ewalds Fiskerne'', which was written for her, to Frydendahl.&lt;ref&gt;Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon&lt;/ref&gt;   The conflict culminated when von Eickstedt refused to give Caroline's lover, the German violinist Christian Friedrich Müller (1752-1827), a position in the theater, ordered him exiled from Denmark and delayed Caroline's divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon&lt;/ref&gt;   Reportedly, the theater direction feared that they would loose her if she married a foreigner.  In 1780, not long after Caroline had finally been granted her divorce, Christian Friedrich Müller left Denmark for Sweden, and soon after, Caroline left Denmark in the guise of a man after her performance as Louise in ''Desertøren'' and reunited with him in [[Gothenburg]] in Sweden, where they married.&lt;ref&gt;Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon&lt;/ref&gt;  They had one child, Caroline (1791).

===Career in Sweden===
In 1780, Caroline Müller was engaged at the [[Royal Swedish Opera]] in [[Bollhuset]] in [[Stockholm]], where she debuted in ''Alceste'' by Glück.  Despite her Danish accent, she made a success, and [[Johan Henric Kellgren]] wrote: "Yesterday I cried for two hours at the opera, when Alceste was played for the first time: Mrs Müller made her debut. One might say that there had been no performance or an actress in Sweden before."&lt;ref&gt;Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1782, as she was scheduled to perform in the inauguration performance of the new building of the Royal Swedish Opera, Caroline Müller and her spouse suddenly left her contract in Sweden and left for [[London]] to escape her creditors.  In London, she became the first Danish opera singer to perform outside of the Nordic countries.  In 1783, she returned to the Royal Swedish Opera when King [[Gustav III of Sweden]] offered her an immunity against her contract crime and raised her salary, and her husband was given a position at the ''[[Kungliga Hovkapellet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Österberg, Carin, Lewenhaupt, Inga &amp; Wahlberg, Anna Greta, Svenska kvinnor: föregångare nyskapare, Signum, Lund, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Elisabeth Olin]] retired in 1784, Müller effectively replaced her as the [[prima donna]] of the Royal Swedish Opera, performing in productions written by Italian, French, German and Swedish composers, some of which written by the king, Gustav III.  Among her most celebrated parts where ''Armida'' and ''Iphigenie de Thauride'' by [[Glück]].  Her most famous part was arguably the role of [[Christina Gyllenstierna]] in ''Gustav Wasa'' by Johann Gottlieb Naumann with text by Kellgren and Gustav III and which was referred to as the national opera if Sweden.  Her last performance was as Christina Gyllenstierna in ''Gustav Wasa'' for the newly elected crown prince [[Carl Johan Bernadotte]] in 1810.   She was sculptured by J.T. Sergel and a friend of [[Edvard du Puy]] and [[Carl Michael Bellman]].

In 1791, she visited Denmark and was present at a performance given to the benefit of her mentor, Lisbeth Cathrine Amalie Rose.

Caroline Müller also took students, and [[Lars Hjortsberg]] was among her students.  From 1812 to 1815, she was the principal of the acting school ''[[Dramatens elevskola]]'' in succession to [[Sofia Lovisa Gråå]], which was a period of expansion and development of the school.

Caroline Müller was appointed ''[[Hovsångare]]'' and inducted into the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Music]] in 1788 (her spouse was also inducted the same year).&lt;ref&gt;Österberg, Carin, Lewenhaupt, Inga &amp; Wahlberg, Anna Greta, Svenska kvinnor: föregångare nyskapare, Signum, Lund, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Gustav Löwenhielm]] mentioned her importance in Swedish theater and opera history in the 19th century, during a discussion about the employment of foreign artists, when he pointed out that several of the artists during the foundation of the Royal Swedish Opera and the Royal Dramatic Theatre had been foreigners: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Is it impossible to engage Mr Berg and Miss Schoultz? - Generally, I can not see how we can elude the employment of half grown foreigners. Gustav III's ''[[Sweden|Swedish]]'' national theatre started with the ''[[Denmark|Danish]]'' [[Caroline Frederikke Müller|Mrs Müller]], the ''[[France|French]]'' [[Marie Louise Marcadet|Mrs Marcadet]], the ''[[Germany|German]]'' [[Franziska Stading|Mamsell Stading]], the ''German'' [[Lovisa Augusti|Mrs Augusti]] and the ''[[Poland|Polish]]'' [[Sophie Stebnowska|Mrs Karsten]]. These ladies occupied our stage and kept it from the foundation of the opera and the premature departure of [[Elisabeth Olin|Mrs Olin]] in the beginning of the 1780s, until the year of 1800, when the school of [[Anne Marie Milan Desguillons|Mrs Desguillons]] had created [[Jeanette Wässelius|Mamsell Wässelia]] cum celeris."&lt;ref name="Nordensvan, Georg"&gt;Nordensvan, Georg, Svensk teater och svenska skådespelare från Gustav III till våra dagar.

[[Image:Civil War class.jpg|thumb|right|250|A photograph of a class in [[Wilmington, Massachusetts|Wilmington]], [[Massachusetts]] in the 2005–2006 school year.]]
A '''class''' in [[education]] has a variety of related meanings.

It can be the group of students which attends a specific [[course (education)|course]] or [[lesson]] at a [[university]], [[school]], or other [[education]]al institution, see ''[[Form (education)]]''.

It can refer to a [[course (education)|course]] itself, for example, a class in Shakespearean drama.

It can be the group of students at the same level in an institution: the freshman class; or the group of students which graduates from the institution at the same time: the Class of 2005. The term can be used in a slightly more general context, such as "the graduating class."

It can also refer to the [[classroom]], in the building or venue where such a lesson is conducted.

In some countries' educational systems (such as [[Taiwan]]'s), it can refer to a subdivision of the students in an academic department, consisting of a cohort of students of the same academic level. For example, a department's sophomores may be divided into three classes.

In countries such as the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[India]], [[Germany]], [[Russia]], and in the past, [[Sweden]], the word can mean a [[Educational stage|grade]]: 1st class is ages 4–5, 2nd class is ages 6–7, 3rd class is ages 8–9, 4th class is ages 9–10, 5th class is ages 10–11, 6th class is ages 11–12,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/education/the-irish-education-system/overview-of-the-irish-education-system&lt;/ref&gt; and 9th class is ages 14–15, class 10 is ages 15–16 and class 12th is ages 17–18.

{{US student loans}}
In discussions of the cost of college in the United States, the '''cost of attendance''' ('''COA''') (also known as the '''price of attendance''') is a statutory term for the estimated full and reasonable cost of completing a full academic year (usually, nine months) as a full-time student. The cost of attendance is published by each educational institution and includes:
* [[Tuition]] and fees payable to the institution
* Books and supplies
* [[Room and board]]
* Personal costs (medical, toiletries, clothing, laundry)
* Transportation to and from the school

As of October 29, 2011, every [[post-secondary]] institution that receives federal [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]] funds is required to post its COA. Colleges are also required to post a Net Price Calculator, that determines for each prospective or current student a personalized Net Price, which is the difference between COA and need- and merit-based Grant Aid (not including loans or [[Federal Work-Study Program|work-study]] programs).

Financial aid cannot exceed the cost of attendance.

== Biography ==

Dennis Epple earned a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in [[aeronautical engineering]] from [[Purdue University]] in 1968, whereafter he briefly worked as an engineer for the [[McDonnell Douglas Corporation]] (1968-69). Epple subsequently changed to the social sciences, earning a [[Master of Public Affairs]] from [[Princeton University|Princeton's]] [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]] in 1971 as well as a [[Master of Science|M.S.]] and a [[Ph.D.]] in economics from Princeton in 1973 and 1975. Since 1974, Epple has worked at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] (CMU), first as an assistant professor of economics (1974-78), then as associate professor (1978-83), and finally as full professor (since 1983). Following a short position as Gary A. Rosenberg Professor of Real Estate, Finance, and Economics and Director of the Center for Real Estate Research at [[Northwestern University]] (1994-95), Epple was made the Thomas Lord Professor of Economics in 1996 and a University Professor in 2013. Moreover, he briefly worked as a fellow at the [[Hoover Institution]] and maintains a courtesy affiliation with the H.J. Heinz III School of Public Policy and Management at CMU.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tepper.cmu.edu/~/media/97476faf7ef7471d8f3d7a54bdfd9e1a.ashx Curriculum vitae of Dennis Epple from the website of the Tepper School of Business (from April 2015). Retrieved March 14th, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of professional service, Epple repeatedly served as Head of Economics (1980-84, 2005-14) at CMU and performed editorial functions with the ''[[American Economic Review]]'', ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'' and ''[[Journal of Public Economics]]'', among others. In 2003, Epple's contributions to economic research were rewarded with a fellowship of the [[Econometric Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.econometricsociety.org/society/organization-and-governance/fellows List of Fellows of the Econometric Society.

== Research ==

Dennis Epple's research focuses on [[political economics]], the [[education economics|economics of education]], and [[public finance]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://hceconomics.uchicago.edu/people/dennis-epple Profile of Dennis Epple on the website of the Human Capital and Economic Opportunity (HCEO) Global Working Group. Retrieved March 14th, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, influenced by the [[Tiebout model|Tiebout hypothesis]], Epple has extensively published on the public decision-making, financing and provision of private and public goods and services in local settings, e.g. on fiscal decentralization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://econpapers.repec.org/bookchap/eeeregchp/4-55.htm Epple, D., Nechyba, T.

Amsterdam: Elsevier, pp. 2423-2480.]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1990s, this research has branched out into extensive work on topics related to the economics of education (generally together with [[Richard Romano]]) such as peer effects,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444537072000037 Epple, D., Romano, R.E.

=== The political and public economics of local government===

After an early interest in [[environmental economics]], research on the [[Tiebout hypothesis]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/v86y1978i3p405-25.html Epple, D., Zelenitz, A., Visscher, M. (1978). A Search for Testable Implications of the Tiebout Hypothesis. ''Journal of Political Economy'', 86(3), pp. 405-425.]&lt;/ref&gt;, led Dennis Epple to adopt a perspective framed by competition between different localities;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/v89y1981i6p1197-1217.html With regard to the Tiebout hypothesis, Epple and Allan Zelenitz argue that competition among numerous local jurisdictions alone doesn't prevent local governments from exercising monopoly power; as - unlike residents - land is immobile, local governments are able to capture at least some land rents.]&lt;/ref&gt; this perspective is present in much of his research on public and political economics, including school competition. In further research on interjurisdictional competition with [[Thomas Romer]] and Radu Filimon, Epple has explored the conditions under which there is an equilibrium between mobile consumers' choices in terms of housing location and public goods provision&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/pubeco/v24y1984i3p281-308.html Epple, D., Filimon, R., Romer, T.

(1998). Equilibrium and Local Redistribution in an Urban Economy when Households Differ in both Preferences and Incomes. ''Journal of Urban Economics'', 43(1), pp. 23-51.]&lt;/ref&gt; In research with Holger Sieg (and Thomas Romer) in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Epple has further investigated the estimation of structural [[general equilibrium model]]s of interjurisdictional competition&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/v107y1999i4p645-681.html Epple, D., Sieg, H. (1999). Estimating Equilibrium Models of Local Jurisdictions. ''Journal of Political Economy'', 107(4), pp. 645-681.]&lt;/ref&gt;. Corresponding applications, e.g. in the [[Boston Metropolitan Area]], have found evidence of sophisticated voting behaviour in line with households' sorting into communities with similar public spending preferences and rejected myopic voting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ecm/emetrp/v69y2001i6p1437-1465.html Epple, D., Romer, T., Sieg, H. (2001). Interjurisdictional Sorting and Majority Rule: An Empirical Analysis. ''Econometrica'', 69(6), pp. 1437-1465.]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in work with Richard Romano during the mid-1990s, Epple has studied how the presence of private alternatives affects public service provision in theory, finding (among else) that the public provision of services without restrictions on privately purchased supplements will be preferred by a majority of households relative to purely market or government-based provision systems, would maximize public and private expenditure on the public good, and be opposed by both poor and rich households.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/pubeco/v62y1996i3p297-325.html Epple, D., Romano, R.E.

=== Learning in industrial organisations ===

In the 1990s, Dennis Epple and Linda Argote contributed substantially to the theory of [[organizational learning]]. While Epple and Argote observe learning curves in many manufacturing organisations, they also observe considerable variation in the extent to which organisations' productivity increases in production, which they attribute to differences between organizations "memories", [[employee turnover]], [[economies of scale]] and knowledge transfers from other products and organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17776451 Argote, L., Epple, D. (1990). Learning curves in manufacturing. ''Science'', 247(4945), pp. 920-924.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economics of education ===

In 1998, Epple and Richard Romano developed a seminal model of competition between tuition-financed [[private school]]s, tax-financed, tuition-free [[state school|public schools]] and students that differ in terms of ability and income. The model predicts that private schools will attempt to vary tuition to attract relatively able students through tuition discounts as less able yet wealthy students benefit from the educational peer effects due to their more talented but poorer peers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v88y1998i1p33-62.html Epple, D., Romano, R.E.

''American Economic Review'', 88(1), pp. 33-62.]&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to public and private schools, these predictions are borne out by later work with [[David Figlio]], which moreover asserts that students' income plays a stronger role in determining placement in the hierarchy of private schools the more public school expenditure falls.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/pubeco/v88y2004i7-8p1215-1245.html Epple, D., Figlio, D., Romano, R.

''Journal of Public Economics'', 88(7), pp. 1215-1245.]&lt;/ref&gt; In an extension, Epple, Romano and Elizabeth Newlon study the effect of [[Tracking (education)|student tracking]] on school competition and predict that tracking would increase the share of high ability students in public schools but also push wealthy, low-ability students into private education, which attracts the wealthiest and most talented students.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/pubeco/v83y2002i1p1-48.html Epple, D., Newlon, E., Romano, R.

'''Emerich Coreth''' (10 August 1919 – 1 September 2006) was an Austrian Philosopher, Jesuit and Catholic Priest. He is well known for his works on [[metaphysics]] and [[philosophical anthropology]]. A close associate of Karl [[Rahner]], Coreth is a renowned neo-Thomist of 20th century. He was the Rector of the [[University of Innsbruck]] and the Provincial of the Austrian Province of the [[Society of Jesus]].

== Philosophy ==
Coreth specialises in [[metaphysics]], [[philosophical anthropology]], and [[history of philosophy]]. He is considered one of the philosophers who sought the creative recovery of [[Thomas Aquinas]]' metaphysics through the transcendental method introduced by [[Joseph Maréchal|Joseph Marechal]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Quest for Plausible Christian Discourse in a World of Pluralities: The Evolution of David Tracy's Understanding of "Public Theology"|last=Kim|first=Younhee|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2008|isbn=9783039107339|location=Oxford|pages=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, Coreth and other theologians attempted to revive the [[Philosophical realism|metaphysics of realism]] (Aristotelian-Thomistic metaphysics) by addressing the failure of [[Kantianism|Kantian philosophy]] using its presuppositions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One of Coreth's most important works was ''Metaphysik'' where he wrote about the Christian metaphysics of Being so that it presented a completely transcendentally reformulated version.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Being and God: A Systematic Approach in Confrontation with Martin Heidegger, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jean-Luc Marion|last=Puntel|first=Lorenz|last2=White|first2=Alan|publisher=Northwestern University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780810127708|location=Evanston, Illinois|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book also refuted critics such as [[Étienne Gilson|Etienne Gilson]], who argued that transcendental turn among Thomists can only lead to [[phenomenalism]] or [[idealism]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Twentieth-Century Western Philosophy of Religion 1900-2000|last=Long|first=Eugene Thomas|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|year=2003|isbn=0792362853|location=Dordrecht, The Netherlands|pages=348}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Coreth maintained that instead of having an objective, metaphysics only has a subjective function. Here, metaphysics loses its foundation in being but Coreth said that "our a priori knowledge is metaphysical knowledge of being, which opens for us the absolute horizon of being as such."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School.JPG|thumb|220px|Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School, Calala, NSW]]
'''Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School''' is an [[Selective school (New South Wales)|academically selective]], [[Day school|day]] and [[Boarding school|boarding]], [[Public school (government funded)|Public]] [[high school]] for boys, located at [[Calala, New South Wales|Calala]], a small suburb of [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]], in northern [[New South Wales]], Australia. It is the only public [[Agriculture|agricultural]] high school for boys in Australia.&lt;ref name=Welcome&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farreragri-h.schools.nsw.edu.au/SchoolInfo/SchoolInfo.html|title=Principal's Welcome Message|accessdate=3 February 2008|work=About Farrer|publisher=Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210034330/http://www.farreragri-h.schools.nsw.edu.au/SchoolInfo/SchoolInfo.html|archivedate=10 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 1939, Farrer is one of the few agricultural [[secondary school]]s catering for both boarding and day students. The school currently enrols approximately 610 students from Years 7 to 12, including 360 boarders,&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt; making it the third largest boarding school in the State.&lt;ref name=OBA06/&gt; Being a public high School, tuition is free, and the school charges the lowest boarding fees in New South Wales.&lt;ref name="ABSA"/&gt;

While an emphasis is placed on the agricultural [[curriculum]], but a broad curriculum is also on offer for students from rural NSW who do not wish to return to the land or gain employment in an agricultural field. Other areas of emphasis at Farrer include sport and student welfare.&lt;ref name=NSWPubSchools&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schools.nsw.edu.au/schoolfind/locator/?section=showRecord&amp;code=8111|title=Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School|accessdate=3 February 2008|work=School Locator|publisher=NSW Public Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farrer embodies a conservative culture with a high degree of inclusiveness of Ethnicity and Disabilities. [[School uniform]] is compulsory and is traditional in style, including [[blazer]], [[necktie|tie]] and wide-brimmed [[hat]]. The school marches each week as part of the school assembly, and a [[prefect]] system is in place, playing an important role in the welfare and supervision of students.&lt;ref name=NSWPubSchools/&gt;

==History==
Farrer Memorial High School was founded in 1939 by Sir Addison Craig as an agricultural high school for boarders, particularly those who are isolated and day students from the Tamworth region.&lt;ref name=OBA06/&gt;

The school was named in memory of [[William Farrer|William James Farrer]] (1845–1906), a leading Australian [[agronomist]] and [[wheat]] [[breeder]], best known for developing the "Federation" breed of wheat. His work led to significant increases in the Australian wheat crop for decades to come, and economic prosperity for the wheat industry.&lt;ref name=Narsa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narsa.com.au/accguide/nsw-nonmem/farrer.pdf|title=Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School|accessdate=3 February 2008|year=2007|format=PDF|work=Accommodation Guide|publisher=National Association for Rural Student Accommodation Inc|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829011241/http://www.narsa.com.au/accguide/nsw-nonmem/farrer.pdf|archivedate=29 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WFarrer&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Wrigley|first=C.W.|encyclopedia=Australian Dictionary of Biography|title=Farrer, William James (1845–1906)|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080498b.htm|accessdate=3 February 2008|edition=Online|year=1981|publisher=Melbourne University Press|volume=8|location=Melbourne|pages=471–473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
The Farrer [[campus]] is {{convert|140|ha|acre|0}} in size, and is located on the outskirts of [[Rural area|rural]] Tamworth, on prime Peel Valley [[arable land|farmland]].&lt;ref name=OBA06/&gt;

The school's facilities include computer rooms, TAS workshops, a 200-seat [[auditorium]], Old Boys museum and multiple facilities to teach practical agriculture,&lt;ref name=OBA06/&gt; such as a {{convert|170|ha|acre|0}} [[farm]], [[horticultural]] centre and [[piggery]].&lt;ref name=Farm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farreragri-h.schools.nsw.edu.au/Farm/Farm.html|title=The Farm|accessdate=3 February 2008|work=Farm |publisher=Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210204947/http://www.farreragri-h.schools.nsw.edu.au/Farm/Farm.html|archivedate=10 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[dairy cattle]], White Suffolk Flock and Angus [[Stud (animal)|stud]] are run as profitable business ventures, turning over in excess of [[Australian dollar|A$]]140,000 at the Bull Sale in 2005.&lt;ref name=OBA06/&gt;

The school's sporting facilities include a [[gym]]nasium, [[swimming pool]], weights room, [[tennis court]]s, [[basketball court]]s, [[Playing field|football fields]] and a [[Cricket field|cricket oval]] with [[Cricket nets|practice nets]]. The school also makes use of the city's sporting facilities, including the synthetic hockey surface and athletics track.&lt;ref name=Narsa/&gt;

==Curriculum==
Students at Farrer have the opportunity to undertake study in a number of areas from their [[School Certificate]] in Years 9 and 10, through to their [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]] (HSC) in Years 11 and 12. Some of these subject areas on offer include: Industrial Tech Metal, Industrial Tech Wood, [[Electronics]], Information and Software Technology, [[Art]], [[Music]], [[Drama]], Software Design and Development, Beef production, Sheep production, sport science and [[Journalism]].&lt;ref name=Subject&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farreragri-h.schools.nsw.edu.au/SchoolInfo/SubjectSelection/SubjectSelection.html|title=Subject Selection|accessdate=3 February 2008|work=School Information|publisher=Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210205923/http://www.farreragri-h.schools.nsw.edu.au/SchoolInfo/SubjectSelection/SubjectSelection.html|archivedate=10 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agricultural opportunities include Beef cattle, Sheep, Dairy cattle, Wool husbandry, Horticulture, Pig Production, Egg
Growing, Dry land and Irrigated cropping.

Agriculture at Farrer is mandatory for years 7 to 10.&lt;ref name=OBA06/&gt;

==Sack System==
In years past, a "sack" was a student in lower years, particularly years 7–10.  Such students were at the beck and call of students in higher years, particularly year 12, to labour at menial tasks such as shining boots, fetching food or creating confetti with a paper hole punch.  The name "sack" was said to be derived from the idea that younger years were a load to carry, as a sack.&lt;ref&gt;Textbooks 'brought bullying back' http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/national/national/general/textbooks-brought-bullying-back/1357972.aspx{{dead link|date=September 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power was not restricted to year 12. Students of any year higher than another were empowered to issue such commands.  For example, a year 8 boy could make demands of a year 7 boy.  In this respect, the sack system may differ from the English practice of [[Fagging]].

Failure to comply on the part of a "sack" was often disciplined with corporal punishment from the year 12 students.  This punishment commonly took the form of being struck on the backside with a broom, occasionally without pants.  Active resistance to the system was met with ongoing intimidation, assault and bullying from many members of the school community, including the principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/old-boy-seeks-2m-for-years-of-torment/2008/11/10/1226165481820.html|title=Old boy seeks $2m for years of torment|first=Harriet|last=Alexander|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=11 November 2008|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This punishment resulted in the interesting linguistic twist of the word broom being used as a verb.  For example, "Tell that sack to get on with it or he's going to get broomed".

The school has now admitted in court that this system existed and that it failed to implement adequate control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/national/teachers-ignored-bullied-boys-pleas-20081110-5lc1.html|title="Teachers 'ignored bullied boy's pleas'|first=Katelyn|last=John|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=10 November 2008|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable alumni==
[[Alumni]] of Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School are known as Old Boys, and may elect to join the school's [[alumni association]], the Farrer Old Boys' Association. The Old Boys network totals approximately 4000 members across NSW, Australia and the world.&lt;ref name=OBA06&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farreragri-h.schools.nsw.edu.au/Downloads/PDF/Old%20boys%20Master%20Nov%2006c.pdf|title=Farrer Old Boys' Association 2006 Newsletter|accessdate=3 February 2008|year=2006|format=PDF|work=Old Boys|publisher=Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721143921/http://www.farreragri-h.schools.nsw.edu.au/Downloads/PDF/Old%20boys%20Master%20Nov%2006c.pdf|archivedate=21 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some notable Farrer Old Boys include:

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:History of the Caribbean Volume 1.jpg|thumb|General History of the Caribbean - Volume I]] --&gt;
The [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/dialogue/general-and-regional-histories/generalhistoryofthecaribbean2/ General History of the Caribbean] is part of [[UNESCO]]’s [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/dialogue/general-and-regional-histories/ General and Regional Histories] Collection.  The publication seeks to contribute to mutual understanding and dialogue between cultures and civilizations. This series seeks to illustrate the encounters between cultures across history and their respective contributions to the general progress of humankind. This is done through the promotion of a pluralist vision of history.

== Objectives and Main Themes ==
[[The Caribbean]] is understood to encompass the islands in the Caribbean sea and also the coastal part of [[South America]], from Colombia to the Guyanas and the riverine zones of [[Central America]]. Despite the varieties of different languages and customs in this region, many cultural commonalities exist among the populations due to shared experiences and histories.

In an attempt to promote the preservation of cultural identities and greater understanding among peoples through intercultural dialogue and exchange, [[UNESCO]] has promoted and supported the exploration of the history of [[Caribbean people]]s. The project brought together various scholars and researchers at universities and explores civilization, development, and culture in this region.  The collection addresses indigenous communities, slave societies, the influx of settlement with people from Asia, and movements towards autonomy and independence.

The General History of the Caribbean is published in six volumes and seeks to provide an historical account of the area from the perspective of those who live there, highlighting the richness and diversity of these cultures. It seeks to integrate the historical experience of its peoples and societies from the earliest times to the present to highlight the common heritage and destiny of Creole populations and societies in the region.  The collection highlights the population of the Caribbean not as an object of history, but rather actors of their own history.

The [http://publishing.unesco.org/details.aspx?&amp;Code_Livre=4082&amp;change=E first] and [http://publishing.unesco.org/details.aspx?&amp;Code_Livre=1491&amp;change=E second] volumes of the [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/dialogue/general-and-regional-histories/generalhistoryofthecaribbean2/ General History of the Caribbean] begin with analyses and discussions of the indigenous peoples of the region, including hunter-gatherers as well as cultivators associated with the beginnings of village life – the first of the populations to be enslaved. The major struggles that occurred during this period as a result of excessive inhumanity and disease, are studied. The numbers of these populations significantly dwindled and in the eighteenth century, those resisting colonial powers were transported to the coast of Belize, where they established communities that continue to exist today.

[http://publishing.unesco.org/details.aspx?&amp;Code_Livre=1492&amp;change=E Volume III] of this history entitled The Slave Societies constitutes a central point of reference. In examining the creation of new societies, full account is taken of slavery, the terrible toll of human life and suffering it exacted and its pervasive impact on the psyche of the [[Caribbean]] people, both white and black. Resistance to slavery took many forms, of which marronnage in [[Haiti]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Suriname]], where the numbers were large, has received the most attention. Revolts and rebellions persisted throughout the region from the seventeenth century, although the best known is understandably that which led to Haiti’s independence at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The abolition of the British slave trade left slavery itself intact, until it gradually succumbed in the decades of the nineteenth century, first to the creed of the [[French Revolution]], then to the combination of slave rebellions in the islands and the determined protestations of humanitarians and free traders in Europe.

[[File:Custom House- Port-au-Prince- Haiti, her history and her detractors.jpg|thumb|left|Custom House, Port-au-Prince, Haiti]]

By the middle of the nineteenth century, the disputes between estate owners and the emancipated field labourers, referred to in [http://publishing.unesco.org/details.aspx?&amp;Code_Livre=4082&amp;change=E Volumes I] and IV, opened the way for the influx of people from Asia, predominantly from India, thus adding a new element to the [[Creole peoples|Creole societies]] which had gradually been formed since the sixteenth century. To avoid this supply of new labour for sugar estates becoming the restoration of slavery in a new guise, the recruitment of the labourers and their condition of work in the islands were regulated by law. Nevertheless, the constraints of indenture and the indignities attendant on being estate labourers affected the way in which Creole societies developed in the twentieth century. Undoubtedly, slavery and indenture have influenced the social and economic relations of societies in the circum-Caribbean in ways productive of ethnic and class conflict. Yet they have not only been the sources of cruelty and injustice, of acts remembered and resented. By persistent resistance to these oppressive regimes, these societies have also endowed themselves with the dignity and self-confidence of free people. [1]

During the latter part of the nineteenth century, the impulse towards autonomy which was felt by some of the propertied and educated elites was frustrated by international, political and economic circumstances outside their control. The production of sugar from cane continued to dominate the Caribbean economies, with oil, minerals and tourism becoming important items in the twentieth century. The influx of American capital and the gradual diminution of European interests in the Caribbean led to the expansion of American influence in the region from the turn of the century onwards, notably in [[Cuba]], [[Haiti]] and [[Santo Domingo]]. This was the context in which the movements for self-determination worked, complicated everywhere by racial prejudice and disparities in the ownership of property.

In the years following the Second World War, examined in [http://publishing.unesco.org/details.aspx?&amp;Code_Livre=4256&amp;change=E Volume V], the islands and their immediate mainland neighbours have sought a variety of solutions to the problems which arise from societies asserting political autonomy while possessing economies dependent on overseas markets where their goods are protected from competition. [[Puerto Rico]] became the ‘Estado Libre’, a Commonwealth; the French-speaking islands became departments of France; the Dutch-speaking islands, prior to the independence of [[Suriname]], all became part of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]; the British islands first flirted with a Federation, then became independent states separately; other states, following periods of military dictatorship, have pursued the path of socialist revolution. Currently, both in the islands and on the continent, there is a growing tendency for policy to be guided by regionalism, by the impulse towards association and co-operation, towards the formation of trading blocs, initially prompted by geographical propinquity.

== History of the Project ==
The Working Group convened by the Director-General of [[UNESCO]] in Paris in 1981 to begin work on the project of writing a [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/dialogue/general-and-regional-histories/generalhistoryofthecaribbean2/ General History of the Caribbean] – separately from the [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/dialogue/general-and-regional-histories/general-history-of-latin-america/ General History of Latin America]. In conjunction with the Working Group and broad consultation carried out by the Regional Offices in Latin America and the Caribbean, a Drafting Committee was established by the Director-General. This Drafting Committee included 19 scholars and researchers from a range of places, two-thirds of whom were from the [[Caribbean]], including [[Martinique]], [[Santa Lucia]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Haiti]], [[Barbados]] and [[Cuba]]. The six-volume History was officially launched in 1993 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2011.

'''Geometry from the Land of the Incas''' is a free [[geometry]] [[website]] funded by advertising, aimed mainly at high school and college age students.

Developed by Antonio Gutierrez, the site uses sound, dynamic geometry, [[animations]], [[science]], and [[Incan]] [[history]] with the goal of raising students' interest in Euclidean geometry. Numerous problems are presented with step-by-step solutions for each proof. 

Around 2003, the website won several minor awards {{ref|awards}} from educational publications, including One of the Top 10 educational Web Sites Canada's SchoolNet's in 2003 {{ref|canada}}, the Knot #284 [[Canadian Mathematical Society]] {{ref|knot}}, [[NCTM]] Illuminations Web Byte (National Council of Teacher of Mathematics){{ref|nctm}}, and one of 30 “Desert Island Theorems” of the book: "The Changing Shape of Geometry Celebrating a Century of Geometry and Geometry Teaching", the [[Mathematical Association]] [[UK]]{{ref|ma_uk}}.

The author designed the site for teachers, students and parents, and anyone else curious about geometry, [[mathematics]], popular science, [[geography]], Incan history and visual perception.

The site moved to www.gogeometry.com on November 5, 2007 from www.agutie.homestead.com.

== Site contents ==
Geometry from the Land of the Incas is divided into nine major categories: Geometry theorems and problems, Inca Geometry, Quizzes, Puzzles, Quotations, Inspiration, Landscapes, Mindmaps, and Geometric art.  This site is loaded with advertisements and very little, if any, interesting exploration of the Inca's understanding of geometry.

==Technical requirements==
Requires [[Flash Player]] 5.0 or higher version, [[Java Runtime Environment]] 1.3 or higher version and [[JavaScript]].

This site is best viewed using [[Internet Explorer]] version 6.0 or higher, or [[Firefox]] version 1.5 or higher and at a [[display resolution]] of 1024&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;768 or higher.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2269">'''Infostate''' is an index used to measure the [[Digital Divide]].
It was proposed by [[Orbicom-UNESCO|Orbicom]], the International Network of [[UNESCO]] Chairs in Communications, in ''"Monitoring the Digital Divide… and beyond"''.
The conceptual framework of the index introduces the notions of a country’s infodensity and info-use.
Infodensity refers to the stocks of [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] capital and labour, including networks and ICT skills, indicative of a country’s productive capacity and indispensable to function in an Information Society. It includes ICT networks, machinery, and equipment, as well as ICT skills, indispensable for the functioning of information, knowledge-oriented societies.
Info-use refers to the uptake and consumption flows of ICTs, as well as their intensity of use by households, businesses and governments and the intensity of their actual use.
Infostate is an aggregation of Infodensity and Info-use indexes and represents the degree of a country’s ‘ICT-ization’.
The [[Digital Divide]] is then defined as the relative difference in infostates among economies.

The Infostate index is used as a base for another index, the [[ICT Opportunity Index]], proposed by ITU, International Telecommunication Unit in “From the Digital Divide to DIGITAL OPPORTUNITIES: Measuring Infostates for Development”.
The ICT Opportunity Index is in fact the merger of two well known initiatives, ITU’s Digital Access Index (DAI) and Orbicom’s Monitoring the Digital Divide/ Infostate conceptual framework and model.

The University, known earlier as Kumasi [[Vocational education|Technical Institute]], was established in 1954, but started actual teaching and learning in 1955, dealing mainly with craft courses. It became a [[Institute of technology|Polytechnic]] on 30 October 1963 and a [[University]] in 2017. From then on, it concentrated on Technician and a few Diploma Programmes. Additionally, a few professional courses were offered. Following the enactment of the Polytechnic Law 1992, PNDC Law 321, Kumasi Polytechnic ceased to exist in its previous form and became a [[tertiary institution]].

==Faculties ==
It has expanded from three Faculties and one Centre in 2009/2010 to six Faculties, one school and two Institutes in the 2010/2011 academic year. The polytechnic is currently organised into the following faculties, Schools and Institutes:

Sponsors include BBC Knowledge, Phyzok Learning Solutions LLP and other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.letmeknow.in/opportunity/lsi-national-young-change-agent-award-by-phyzok-bbc-knowledge-business-arts-design-maths-sciences-social-sciences-9554.html{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== LSI 2012 ===
The conclave was held on 4 December 2012 at India Habitat Centre, Delhi, with Mrs. Avnita Bir and Simon Breakspear as curators. The conclave was centered around three "focus questions", that summarized the key issues in the Indian education system &lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/LearnShiftIndia/photos/ms.c.eJw1x8kNACAMA7CNUHoldP~;FkCj45wLNCLkSEFbN~_5773awTVPh~;zHEAkoAMmA~-~-.bps.a.506116056073405.123617.480851735266504/506116092740068/?type=1&amp;theater&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
The three questions were as follows :

1. Teachers : How could we attract, prepare, retain and develop high quality teachers?

2. Equity : How could we achieve equity, access and quality in education for all?

3. Technology : How could we harness the potential for technology to transform learning?

The LSI Young Changemaker Award Contest was held for students to present their opinions in the form of an essay or a video entry.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/LearnShiftIndia/photos/a.480920528592958.118271.480851735266504/496923060326038/?type=1&amp;theater&lt;/ref&gt;

=== LSI 2013 ===
The Mumbai chapter conclave was held at JW Marriott, Mumbai, on 13 November 2013 and was attended by distinguished dignitaries from the education field with [[Kiran Bir Sethi]] as the keynote speaker. Student representatives were selected across schools to participate in the discussions and the LearnShift Young Change Agent Award Contest in organized in association with Phyzok Learning Solutions LLP saw entries from school students all across the country on making everyday concepts interesting in the form of video entries.

== Event procedures ==

There are sessions and discussions on the themes highlighted for the year, and details of works being done by different individuals/institutions is shared. Students from schools across the country are invites as representatives for the discussions since the Mumbai Chapter of LSI in 2013. The Learnshift India Young Agent Contest and the Teacher Catalyst Award at LSI 2015 aim at bringing in opinions of students and teachers respectively on education related issues in the form of videos.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/5074-be-india-s-young-change-agent&lt;/ref&gt;

== Student and teacher contests ==
The LSI Young Agent Award Contest (for students) and the Teacher Catalyst Award (for teachers, since LSI 2015), in 2012 (as the LSI Young Changemaker Award), focused on essays on the topic "If you were the minister of education, what changes would you like to bring about in school education ? Give reasons for the required changes and tell us the proposed plan of action" and videos on the topic "Education should be for all and not just the prerogative of the few".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/LearnShiftIndia/photos/pb.480851735266504.-2207520000.1428841320./505390989479245/?type=3&amp;theater&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Master of Engineering degree''' (abbreviated '''MEng''', '''M.E.''' or '''M.Eng.''') can be either an [[Academic degree|academic]] or [[Professional degree|professional]] [[master's degree]] in the field of [[engineering]].

==International variations==

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the Master of Engineering degree is a research degree requiring completion of a thesis. Like the [[Master of Philosophy]] (M.Phil.), it is considered a lesser degree than [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) and a higher degree than coursework master. It is not to be confused with Master of Engineering Science, Master of Engineering Studies or Master of Professional Engineering which are coursework master's degrees. Exceptions are Monash University which awards a Master of Engineering Science by either research or coursework, the University of Melbourne which offers a Master of Engineering by coursework,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.unimelb.edu.au/Postgrad/MEng/about/overview.html|title=404|author=|date=|website=www.eng.unimelb.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the University of Tasmania which offer a Master of Engineering Science by research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.utas.edu.au/static/documents/1096_Engineering.pdf University of Tasmania Engineering Course Guide] Accessed 16 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Melbourne accepted the first intake of Master of Engineering students in February 2010. The coursework Master of Engineering is offered in 11 specialisations and accepts graduates with three-year degrees in Science and Maths.

The entry requirement is completion of a [[bachelor's degree]] at or above the second class honours level. Some universities do not offer direct enrolment into [[Doctor of Philosophy degree]] and students must first enrol in a lesser research degree before "upgrading".

===Brazil===
In Brazil, the rough equivalent of a Master of Engineering degree is a professional master's degree of typically two years' length that involves mostly coursework and a thesis or research paper in applied engineering. Entrance to a Master of Engineering degree is a 5-year bachelor engineering degree.
Another variant (academic master) is equivalent to a Master of Science, such degree is tied to extensive research and is valid for a Ph.D. entry.
Both can be stricto sensu classified and it depends of the course provider institution..

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], the Master of Engineering degree is a [[professional degree]] of typically two years length that involves coursework and a thesis or research paper of significant depth. Some Canadian universities offer a Master of Engineering or either a [[Master of Science]] or [[Master of Applied Science]] in engineering or both. Master of Engineering degrees usually require more coursework and examination and less research, whereas Master of Applied Science degrees require less coursework and more research. However, this is not absolute since some universities only offer a Master of Engineering and some only offer a Master of Science or Master of Applied Science. Some universities differentiate only by the requirement to be resident and therefore assist in teaching/tutoring for a Master of Science Degree.

===Colombia===
In [[Colombia]], the Master of Engineering, which takes a minimum of two years, is a postgraduate program that follows the undergraduate of five years. Depending upon the emphasis is called Ms.Eng. with emphasis in Energy, Chemistry, Environment and so on. At the end, it is required to make a publication of the developed work in a recognized journal of scientific spreading as a requirement for the degree.

===Croatia===
Introduced with the [[Bologna process]], the Croatian Master of Engineering is typically a two-year program and a direct continuation of a three-year Bachelor course. The degree is abbreviated mag. ing. and followed by the field of study (for example: ''mag. ing. računarstva'' – Master of Computer Engineering)

===Finland===
There are two distinct degrees in [[Finland]], a taught university degree (''[[diplomi-insinööri]]'') and a polytechnic master's degree's (''[[Insinööri (amk)#The insinööri (ylempi amk) or insinööri (yamk) degree|insinööri (ylempi AMK)]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2005/20050423 Finnish legislation 423/2005 on degrees at Universities of Applied Sciences] Accessed: 21 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[diplomi-insinööri|former]] is translated as "Master of Science in Technology", the term "Master of Engineering" is predominantly used by [[Universities of Applied Sciences]], which offer master's degree programmes to holders of polytechnic bachelor's degrees (''[[insinööri (amk)]]''). As European [[Bologna process]] directs, in order to get a M.Eng. degree, B.Sc. engineers have to additionally study full-time one or two years and finalize a Master's thesis. Most of the M.Eng. degree programs are taught in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], but some Swedish and English language programs also exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metropolia.fi/en/studies/masters_degrees/ Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, Master's degrees] Accessed: 21 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In [[France]], two diploma exist for 5 years of study in the field of engineering: the Master's diploma in engineering (''diplôme de master en sciences de l'ingénieur'') which is usually delivered by Universities and the [[Engineer's degree]] ("[[diplôme d'ingénieur]]") which can only be delivered by some Engineering schools called [[grandes écoles]]—very selective schools that are generally smaller than universities—and provides "a level of education comparable to a master's degree in engineering in the United States" ([http://www.aacrao.org/resources/resources-detail-view/new-information-warrants-change-in-french-placement-recommendations|source AACRAO]).

The Engineer's degree usually prepare students for professional careers. Courses always include management, economy or more generally transverse courses. Training periods in industry or in laboratories are also required. The Master's diploma in engineering offers a more focused approach on a field of engineering. A Ph.D. program can be joined by acquiring a Master's diploma in engineering or an Engineer's degree.

===Germany===
In [[Germany]], the local engineer's degrees (Diplomingenieur (Dipl.-Ing.), a first degree after 5 years of study at a university and Dipl.-Ing. (FH), the engineering degree offered by Fachhochschulen after 4 years of study) were abolished in most universities in 2010 and were replaced by postgraduate master's degrees (M.Sc. and M.Eng.).

The first Master of Engineering courses were introduced in Germany in 2000 as result of the [[Bologna process]]. This type of master's degree is offered by German universities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zfuw.uni-kl.de/en/distance-learning-courses/science-engineering/software-engineering-for-embedded-systems/#zielsetzung|title=Software Engineering for Embedded Systems|website=www.zfuw.uni-kl.de|language=en|access-date=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Fachhochschulen]]'' (''[[Universities of Applied Sciences]]'') alike and is typically a two-year program with application-oriented coursework and an applied research thesis. The entry requirement is the successful completion of a [[bachelor's degree]] or an equivalent from before the Bologna process, with good marks. The nine leading German [[Technical University|Technical Universities]] (Group of [[TU9]]) prefer awarding the [[Master of Science]] degree for completing engineering studies in a master's program.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tu9.de/graduate/master.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===

In [[India]], Master of Engineering (ME) or Master of Technology (MTech) or Master of Science in Engineering (M.Sc.Eng.) degree is a [[postgraduate]] program in engineering field. This is generally a 2-year program (2 or more years in case of M.Sc.Eng. degree) after completing a 4-year [[undergraduate]] program in engineering resulting in the award of a [[Bachelor of Engineering]] or [[Bachelor of Technology]] degree.

Master of Science in Engineering (M.Sc.Eng.) degree in India is usually structured as an engineering research degree, lesser than [[Ph.D.]] and considered to be parallel to [[M.Phil.]] degree in humanities and science.

===Italy===
In Italy, the local engineer's degrees (Laurea in Ingegneria), a first degree after 5 years of study at a university were abolished in most universities in 2008.
The equivalent of a Master of Engineering degree is a professional master's degree (Laurea Magistrale) of two years length that involves mostly coursework and a thesis paper in applied engineering. Entry requirements to a Master of Engineering degree include a 3-year bachelor engineering degree (Laurea).

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], the Master of Engineering degree is generally a research based degree requiring completion of a thesis in key universities ([[University of Auckland]], [[University of Canterbury]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/future-students/qualifications-and-courses/masters-degrees/master-of-engineering/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineering.auckland.ac.nz/en/for/futurepostgraduates/fp-study-options/fp-admission-for-masters/master-of-engineering.html|title=Master of Engineering - The University of Auckland|author=|date=|website=www.engineering.auckland.ac.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the UK's [[Master of Philosophy]] (M.Phil.) in engineering or technology, it is considered a lesser degree than [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) and a higher degree than a coursework master. It is not to be confused with Master of Engineering Studies which is coursework master's degree.

In [[Auckland University of Technology]] (AUT), this degree can be achieved either by completing a thesis (research pathway) or a combination of coursework and research project (coursework pathway)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aut.ac.nz/study-at-aut/study-areas/engineering/postgraduate/master-of-engineering/&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Nepal===

In Nepal,  Master of Engineering or Master of Technology degree is a postgraduate program in engineering. This is generally a 2-year specialization program in a specific branch of engineering field. Students typically enter the ME/MTech program after completing a 4-year undergraduate program in engineering resulting in the award of a [[Bachelor of Engineering]] or [[Bachelor of Technology]] degree. [[Kathmandu University]], [[Tribhuwan University]], [[Pokhara University]] and [[Purvanchal University]] offer this degree.

===Japan===
In Japan, the {{Nihongo|master of engineering|工学修士|Kogaku Shushi}}, which takes a minimum of two years, is a [[postgraduate]] program that follows the undergraduate of four years. It is a research degree between the [[bachelor's degree]] and the [[doctor's degree]] and requires completion of a thesis.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, the master of engineering is a research-based [[postgraduate]] program that typically lasts 2 to 3 years including coursework and must be completed by a comprehensive thesis evaluated by an examination committee. It is generally awarded as a pre-doctoral qualification in the field of engineering. This is in contrast to the "master of science" programs in engineering which are coursework-based and do not require a research thesis.

===South Korea===
In South Korea, the master of engineering, which takes a minimum of two years, is a [[postgraduate]] program that follows the undergraduate of four years. It is commonly awarded for specializations in the field of engineering rather than the science. For example, the degree "master of science in computer science" differs from the degree "master of engineering in computer science" in that the latter one is mainly concentrated on the applicability of the design with strong relation with the hardware rather than the software. Generally, the master of engineering program includes both coursework and research.

===Poland===
'''Magister inżynier''' ('''mgr inż.''', literally: ''master engineer'') academic degree that can be obtained after 2 years post-graduate education (for students having already B.Eng.—''inż.'') or formerly (until full adaptation of [[Bologna process]] by university) through integrated 5 years B.Eng.–M.Eng. (or B.Sc.–M.Sc) programme, giving double degree ''mgr inż.''

[[:sk:Fakulta elektrotechniky a informatiky Slovenskej technickej univerzity|FEI]] [[Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava|STU]] engineering [[Engineering Council|IEE]] accreditation

===Spain===
Before the introduction of the [[Bologna Process]], there were two different Spanish Engineering degrees: "Ingeniería", which took 5 or in some cases 6 full-time yearly courses; and "Ingeniería Técnica", of a shorter duration: 3 years or in some cases 4 full-time yearly courses.

In the wake of the Bologna Process, the [[Higher education in Spain|Spanish Educational System]] implanted the "Máster Habilitante en Ingeniería" and the "Máster Universitario en Ingeniería" degrees (Postgraduate Studies), which use the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] system designed by the European Union. They are slightly shorter to the second half of the former Engineering ("Ingeniería") academic degree, whereas the Technical Engineering Degree is approximately similar to the [[Bachelor's Degree]] within the Bologna system.

Education in Engineering in Spain had traditionally not too many specialties (Naval, Aerospatial, Industrial, Civil, Telecommunications, Informatics, among others) as in the past specialization was not so necessary but after Bologna the Degrees and Masters branched out numerously, giving birth to hundreds of different combinations, opening the possibility to do a bachelor's degree in one university and specialty and then to take a Master´s degree on another specialty, perhaps at a different university, having usually passed an individual interview by the Dean and/or a "Propedeutics" exam or test of some sort, designed to guarantee a solid basis upon which to build further knowledge, that must take into consideration the relationship between the two branches of knowledge and among the subjects being taught at both degrees at the origin and the destination.

The "Master of Engineering" title was introduced in some Swedish universities proceeding the Bologna process. The title "civilingenjör" (literally translated "Civilian engineer", the English term "Civil engineer" is not equivalent to "civilingenjör") is the equivalent of a M.Eng. as well as the "[[Master of Science in Engineering]]" title. A Master of Science in Engineering is awarded after a minimum of 5 years of studies. Before 2007-07-01, it was awarded after a minimum of 4½ year of studies. Students starting with their studies before 2007-07-01, but finishing them before 2015-06-30 and after 2007-07-01, may choose to obtain the title either after 4½ year or after 5 years.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]] the degree of Master of Engineering (MEng) is the highest award for undergraduate studies in engineering. It is the standard university-level qualification taken by people wishing to become [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|chartered engineers]] registered with the Engineering Council (EngC). The MEng degree represents the minimum educational standard required to become a chartered engineer, but there are other equally satisfactory ways to demonstrate this standard such as the completion of a BEng Honours and a subsequent postgraduate diploma, MA or MSc or by completion of the Engineering Council Postgraduate Diploma administered by [[City and Guilds]].  The UK MEng (undergraduate degree) is typically equivalent to the European [[Diplom|''Diplom Ingenieur'']] (Dipl.-Ing.) and [[:sv:Civilingenjör|''Civilingenjör'']] degrees.

EngC's minimum requirement for entry to a recognised MEng course is BBB at A-level, compared to CCC for a BEng Honours course. Universities are free to set higher entry requirements if they wish. Some universities, such as [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and some courses at [[Imperial College London|Imperial]] only admit students to study for the MEng degree. (Their courses usually allow a student to leave with a bachelor's degree after three years, but these shortened degrees are not ECUK-recognised and therefore do not count towards the educational requirements for becoming a chartered engineer) Other universities, such as the [[University of Greenwich]], [[University of Surrey]], [[Coventry University]], [[Brunel University]] and [[Swansea University]], admit students to read for BEng Honours and MEng courses and allow students to change between the two during the early years of the course. The [[Open University]] offers the MEng degree as a postgraduate qualification but requires students to complete its course within four years of completing a BEng Honours degree.

In England, Northern Ireland and Wales the degree is a four-year course or a 'sandwich' five-year course (with one year spent working in industry). In Scotland, it is a five-year course. The Bachelor of Engineering degree (BEng) is usually a three-year course (four in Scotland) or can also include a year in industry. Many universities offer the BEng and may then allow a transfer onto the MEng The Graduateship in engineering, awarded by the [[City &amp; Guilds of London Institute]] (Institution Established in 1878 recognized by Royal Charter n.117 year 1900), is mapped to a British Bachelor of Engineering (Honours)—BEng (Honours)—degree. The Post Graduate Diploma is mapped to a British Master of Engineering (MEng) degree. The Membership in Engineering (MCGI)(NQF at Level 7) is a strategic Management/Chartered professional level and a Post Graduate Diploma, mapped to a British master's degree, awarded by the City &amp; Guilds of London Institute. This will be supported by a minimum of ten years of seasoned experience (peer reviewed) in areas as the Engineering + a British bachelor/graduateship (or by CEng).

Engineers who have been awarded a BEng(Ordinary) or BEng(Honours) and have appropriate training and experience in the work place are able to apply to become an [[Incorporated Engineer]] (IEng). If an engineer has studied beyond the BEng for an MSc or has an MEng, they may apply to become a [[Chartered Engineer]] (CEng), once they have completed the required amount of post graduate work-based competency training and experience. Competency and training requirements are met over a period of 4–8 years in practice for a total of 8–12 years education, training and professional responsibility. Formal structured post graduate training schemes such as the monitored professional development [[IMechE]] enable the Engineer in training to satisfy the requirements for Chartered Engineer faster.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.engc.org.uk/documents/EC0006_UKSpecBrochure_MR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Chartered Engineer and Incorporated Engineer titles awarded by the Engineering Council UK, are very broadly equivalent to (but not the same as) North American Professional Engineer (PEng / PE) and Professional Technologist (PTech) designations, but with often a far greater geographical recognition.  However, P.Eng/PE serve a very different purpose than the CEng qualification.  PE/P.Eng are licenses to practice engineering in the public domain with legal liability at the state or provincial level.  Unlike C.Eng they are not qualifications or titles. Under government legislations they allow one to engage in professional practice in a defined geographic region.  For example, in Ontario the P.Eng license is issued within the Professional Engineers Act (established in 1922).  Despite the Washington accord PE/PEng does not equal C.Eng.  The ability of a C.Eng to practice engineering in the public domain in North America is determined on a case by case basis usually by state or province.  Agreements to recognize qualifications between EngC or Engineers Ireland and Engineers Canada or the USA ABET are not recognized by individual states or provinces.

====Structure====
MEng degrees usually follow the pattern familiar from [[bachelor's degrees]] with [[lecture]]s, [[laboratory]] work, [[coursework]] and [[exam]]s each year. There is usually a substantial project to be completed in the fourth year which may have a research element to it and a more teaching-based project to be completed in the third year. At the end of the third year, there is usually a threshold of academic performance in examinations to allow progression to the final year. At some universities, the structure of the final year is rather different from that of the first three, for example, at the [[University of York]], the final year for the Computer Systems and Software programme consists entirely of project work and intensive advanced seminar courses rather than traditional lectures and problem classes. Final results are, in most cases, awarded on the standard [[British undergraduate degree classification]] scale, although some universities award something structurally similar to 'Distinction', 'Merit', 'Pass' or 'Fail' as this is often the way that taught postgraduate master's degrees are classified.

====History====
At some universities in the UK in the early 1980s, the MEng was awarded as a taught postgraduate degree after 12 months of study. Its entry requirements would typically be like those for other taught postgraduate courses, including holding an undergraduate degree and its format would be similar to the modern MEng although, as with many postgraduate master's degrees, the project would extend over a longer period. MEng courses in their modern, undergraduate form were introduced in the mid-1980s in response to growing competition from technical-degree [[alumnus|graduates]] from continental [[Europe]], where undergraduate bachelor's degree courses are often longer than the usual three years in the UK. There was a feeling among recent graduates, the engineering institutions, employers and universities, that the longer and more in-depth study offered on the continent needed to be made available to UK students as well. Since to obtain a taught master's degree in the UK typically took an additional year beyond a bachelor's degree, it was decided that this extra year would be integrated into the undergraduate program and, instead of pursuing both a bachelor's and master's degree, students would proceed directly to a master's degree.

Since its introduction, the MEng has become the degree of choice for most undergraduate engineers, as was intended. The most common exception to this is international students who, because of the substantially higher fees they are charged, sometimes opt to take the tradition BEng/B.Sc. route where that is available{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}. Most of the [[Engineering society#United Kingdom|engineering institutions]] have now made an MEng the minimum academic standard necessary to become a [[Chartered Engineer]]. Students who graduated before the changes in the rules will still be allowed to use their bachelor's degree for this purpose and those who have earned a bachelor's degree since the changes can usually take some additional courses (known as 'further learning') over time to reach an equivalent standard to the MEng Some older universities such as [[Durham University|Durham]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/ecs/ecs_prospective_students/undergraduate/degrees/engineering/|title=Engineering and Computing Science - Durham University|author=|date=|website=www.dur.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2016}} allow students to obtain the BEng degree after the third year before continuing on to the fourth year.

====Other undergraduate masters====
The MEng is one of a number of integrated master's degrees introduced in the UK since the late 20th century, the other major degree introduced being MSci (Master in Science). Some universities, however, have chosen to award subject specific integrated master's degrees, in subjects such as [[Mathematics]] ([[MMath]]), [[Computer Science]] (MCompSci), [[Physics]] ([[MPhys]]), [[Chemistry]] ([[MChem]]) and [[Biology]] (MBiol).

===United States and Canada===
In the [[United States]] and Canada the Master of Engineering degree is generally a [[professional degree]] offered as a coursework-based alternative to the traditional research-based [[Master of Science]]. It is typically a two-year program, entered after the completion of a 4-year bachelor's degree and many universities allow students to choose between the Master of Engineering and the [[Master of Science]].
The Master of Engineering degree is offered at many leading universities in the United States and Canada on either a full-time and part-time (weekends or evenings) basis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gordon.tufts.edu/programs/m-s-in-engineering-management/academic-calendar/weekend|title=Flexible Schedule - Gordon Institute at Tufts University|author=|date=|website=tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered a [[terminal degree]] in the field of engineering.

Some M.Eng. degree programs require a scholarly project in addition to coursework. Some Master of Engineering programs require additional courses beyond those required for Master of Science students in order to better prepare students for professional careers. Some Master of Engineering programs highly encourage students to participate in collaborative consulting projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gordon.tufts.edu/programs/m-s-in-engineering-management/program-structure#tabs|title=MSEM Curriculum - Gordon Institute|author=|date=|website=tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; These courses may include topics such as business fundamentals, management and leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Master of Engineering, Duke University, http://meng.pratt.duke.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mentorship''' is a relationship in which a more experienced or more knowledgeable person helps to guide a less experienced or less knowledgeable person. The [[mentor]] may be older or younger than the person being mentored, but he or she must have a certain area of expertise.&lt;ref name="MasteryWorks"/&gt; It is a learning and development partnership between someone with vast experience and someone who wants to learn.&lt;ref name="MasteryWorks"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farren Ph.D.|first1=Caela|title=Eight Types of Mentor: Which Ones Do You Need?|url=http://www.masteryworks.com/newsite/downloads/Article3_EightTypesofMentors-WhichOnesdoyouNeed.pdf|publisher=MasteryWorks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mentorship experience and relationship structure affect the "amount of psychosocial support, career guidance, role modeling, and communication that occurs in the mentoring relationships in which the protégés and mentors engaged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fagenson-Eland | first1 = Ellen A. | last2 = Marks | first2 = Michelle A. | last3 = Amendola | first3 = Karen L. | year = 1997 | title = Perceptions of mentoring relationships | url = | journal = Journal of Vocational Behavior | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 29–42 | doi=10.1006/jvbe.1997.1592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The person in receipt of mentorship may be referred to as a '''''protégé''''' (male), a '''''protégée''''' (female), an [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] or, in the 2000s, a '''mentee'''.

The roots of the practice are lost in antiquity. The word itself was inspired by the character of [[Mentor (Odyssey)|Mentor]] in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]''. Though the actual Mentor in the story is a somewhat ineffective old man, the goddess [[Athena]] takes on his appearance in order to guide young [[Telemachus]] in his time of difficulty.

Historically significant systems of mentorship include the [[Guru–shishya tradition|guru–disciple tradition]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yogicwayoflife.com/the-guru-disciple-tradition/|title=Guru Disciple Tradition - The Spiritual Lineage|date=2016-10-07|work=Yogic Way Of Life|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;practiced in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], [[Elder (administrative title)|Elder]]s, the discipleship system practiced by [[Rabbi]]nical [[Judaism]] and the [[Christianity|Christian]] church&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bible.org/article/being-first-century-disciple|title=Being a First-Century Disciple|work=Bible.org|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[apprentice|apprenticing]] under the medieval [[guild]] system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://technicaleducationmatters.org/2009/05/13/chapter-3-the-guilds-and-apprenticeships/|title=Chapter 3 – The Guilds and Apprenticeships|website=technicaleducationmatters.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the United States, advocates for workplace equity in the second half of the twentieth century popularized the term "mentor" and concept of career mentorship as part of a larger [[social capital]] lexicon which also includes terms such as [[glass ceiling]], bamboo ceiling,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Asian American and Pacific Islander Work Group Report|url = http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/reports/aapi.html|website = www.eeoc.gov|accessdate = 2016-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[personal network|networking]], [[role model]], and [[gatekeeper]]—serving to identify and address the problems barring non-dominant groups from professional success. Mainstream business literature subsequently adopted the terms and concepts, promoting them as pathways to success for all career climbers. In 1970, these terms were not in the general American vocabulary; by the mid-1990s they had become part of everyday speech.&lt;ref name="Laird, Pamela Walker"/&gt;

== Professional bodies and qualifications ==
The [[European Mentoring and Coaching Council]], also called the EMCC, is the leading global body in terms of creating and maintaining a range of industry standard frameworks, rules and processes across the mentoring and related supervision and coaching fields e.g. a code of practice for those practising mentoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3tAv72yfBMC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=emcc%20mentoring&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJwKzB8bfTAhUGU1AKHa1mBa0Q6AEIITAA#v=onepage&amp;q=emcc%20mentoring&amp;f=false|title=Facilitating Reflective Learning Through Mentoring &amp; Coaching|first1=Anne|last1=Brockbank|first2=Ian|last2=McGill|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vH1LpGVEgPgC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=emcc%20mentoring&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJwKzB8bfTAhUGU1AKHa1mBa0Q6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=emcc%20mentoring&amp;f=false|title=The Complete Guide to Mentoring: How to Design, Implement and Evaluate Effective Mentoring Programmes|first=Hilarie|last=Owen|date=3 October 2011|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F1vf9RatJhkC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=emcc%20mentoring&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5lYud8rfTAhUCEVAKHSmuD0g4ChDoAQgoMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=emcc%20mentoring&amp;f=false|title=Coaching and Mentoring in Health and Social Care: The Essentials of Practice for Professionals and Organisations|first=Julia|last=Foster-Turner|date=1 May 2005|publisher=Radcliffe Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
The focus of mentoring is to develop the whole person and so the techniques are broad and require wisdom in order to be used appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Effective Teaching and Mentoring| author=Daloz, L. A. | year=1990 | publisher=Jossey Bass | location=San Francisco | pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 1995 study of mentoring techniques most commonly used in business&lt;ref name="Aubrey1995"&gt;{{cite book |title=Working Wisdom: Timeless Skills and Vanguard Strategies for Learning Organizations |publisher=Jossey Bass |year=1995 |pages=23, 44–47, 96–97 |author1=Aubrey, Bob  |author2=Cohen, Paul |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the five most commonly used techniques among mentors were:

# ''Accompanying:'' making a commitment in a caring way, which involves taking part in the learning process side-by-side with the learner.
# ''Sowing:'' mentors are often confronted with the difficulty of preparing the learner before he or she is ready to change. Sowing is necessary when you know that what you say may not be understood or even acceptable to learners at first but will make sense and have value to the mentee when the situation requires it.
# ''Catalyzing:'' when change reaches a critical level of pressure, learning can escalate. Here the mentor chooses to plunge the learner right into change, provoking a different way of thinking, a change in identity or a re-ordering of values.
# ''Showing:'' this is making something understandable, or using your own example to demonstrate a skill or activity. You show what you are talking about, you show by your own behavior.
# ''Harvesting:'' here the mentor focuses on "picking the ripe fruit": it is usually used to create awareness of what was learned by experience and to draw conclusions. The key questions here are: "What have you learned?", "How useful is it?".

Different techniques may be used by mentors according to the situation and the mindset of the mentee, and the techniques used in modern organizations can be found in ancient education systems, from the Socratic technique of harvesting to the accompaniment method of learning used in the apprenticeship of itinerant cathedral builders during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Aubrey1995"/&gt; Leadership authors Jim Kouzes and [[Barry Z. Posner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Credibility |author1=Posner, B.  |author2=Kouzes, J.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=1993 | publisher=Jossey Bass | location=San Francisco | pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; advise mentors to look for "teachable moments" in order to "expand or realize the potentialities of the people in the organizations they lead" and underline that personal credibility is as essential to quality mentoring as skill.

'''Multiple mentors''': A new and upcoming trend is having multiple mentors.&lt;ref name=Ensher2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ensher|first1=E.|last2=Heun|first2=C.|last3=Blanchard|first3=A.|title=Online mentoring and computer-mediated communication: New directions in research|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|volume=63|pages=264–288|doi=10.1016/s0001-8791(03)00044-7|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be helpful because we can all learn from each other. Having more than one mentor will widen the knowledge of the person being mentored. There are different mentors who may have different strengths.

'''Profession or trade mentor''': This is someone who is currently in the trade/profession you are entering. They know the trends, important changes and new practices that you should know to stay at the top of your career. A mentor like this would be someone you can discuss ideas regarding the field, and also be introduced to key and important people that you should know.

'''Industry mentor''': This is someone who doesn't just focus on the profession. This mentor will be able to give insight on the industry as a whole. Whether it be research, development or key changes in the industry, you need to know.

'''Organization mentor''': Politics in the organizations are constantly changing. It is important to be knowledgeable about the values, strategies and products that are within your company, but also when these things are changing. An organization mentor can clarify missions and strategies, and give clarity when needed.

'''Work process mentor''': This mentor can speed quickly over the bumps, and cut through the unnecessary work. This mentor can explain the 'ins and outs' of projects, day to day tasks, and eliminate unnecessary things that may be currently going on in your work day. This mentor can help to get things done quickly and efficiently.

'''Technology mentor''': This is an up-and-coming, incredibly important position. Technology has been rapidly improving, and becoming more a part of day to day transactions within companies. In order to perform your best, you must know how to get things done on the newest technology. A technology mentor will help with technical breakdowns, advise on systems that may work better than what you're currently using, and coach you through new technology and how to best use it and implement it into your daily life.

These mentors are only examples. There can be many more different types of mentors. Look around your workplace, your life, and see who is an expert that you can learn something from.&lt;ref name="MasteryWorks"/&gt;

[[File:What is mentoring (14805966275).jpg|thumb|right|400px|Some elements of mentoring.]]

There are two broad types of mentoring relationships: formal and informal.{{cn|date=June 2018}} Formal mentoring relationships are set up by an administrative unit or office in a company or organization, which solicits and recruits qualified individuals who are willing to mentor, provides training to the mentors, and then helps to match the mentors up with a person in need of mentoring. While formal mentoring systems contain numerous structural and guidance elements, they still typically allow the mentor and mentee to have an active role in choosing who they want to work with. Formal mentoring programs which simply assign mentors to mentees without giving these individuals a say have not performed well. Even though a mentor and a mentee may seem perfectly matched "on paper", in practice, they may have different working or learning styles. As such, giving the mentor and the mentee the opportunity to help select who they want to work with is a widely used approach. Informal mentoring occurs without the use of structured recruitment, mentor training and matching services. Informal mentoring arrangements can develop naturally from [[business networking]] situations in which a more experienced individual meets a new employee, and the two strike up a rapport.

In addition to these broad types, there are also peer, situational and supervisory mentoring relationships.{{cn|date=June 2018}} These tend to fall under the categories of formal and informal mentoring relationships. Informal relationships develop on their own between partners. Formal mentoring, on the other hand, refers to a structured process supported by the organization and addressed to target populations. '''Youth mentoring programs''' assist at-risk children or youth who lack role models and sponsors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/implement/youth-mentoring/overview/main|title=Chapter 22. Youth Mentoring Programs {{!}} Section 1. Building Youth Mentoring Programs {{!}} Main Section {{!}} Community Tool Box|website=ctb.ku.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In business, formal mentoring is part of [[talent management]] strategies which are used to groom key employees, newly hired graduates, high potential-employees and future leaders. The matching of mentor and mentee is often done by a mentoring coordinator, often with the help of a computerized database registry. The use of the database helps to match up mentees with mentors who have the type of experience and qualifications they are seeking.

There are formal mentoring programs that are values-oriented, while social mentoring and other types focus specifically on career development. Some mentorship programs provide both social and vocational support. In well-designed formal mentoring programs, there are program goals, schedules, training (for both mentors and protégés), and evaluation. In 2004 Metizo created the first mentoring certification for companies and business schools in order to guarantee the integrity and effectiveness of formal mentoring. Certification is attributed jointly by the organization and an external expert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metizo.com/home/how-metizo-certifies-personal-development |title=How Metizo certifies personal development |publisher=Metizo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many kinds of mentoring relationships from school or community-based relationships to e-mentoring relationships. These mentoring relationships vary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/entrepreneurs-organization/4-key-facets-of-successful-mentoring-relationships.html|title=4 Key Facets of Successful Mentoring Relationships|date=2017-08-11|work=Inc.com|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be influenced by the type of mentoring relationship that is in effect. That is whether it has come about as a formal or informal relationship. Also there are several models have been used to describe and examine the sub-relationships that can emerge. For example, Buell describes how mentoring relationships can develop under a cloning model, nurturing model, friendship model and apprenticeship model. The cloning model is about the mentor trying to "produce a duplicate copy of him or her self." The nurturing model takes more of a "parent figure, creating a safe, open environment in which mentee can both learn and try things for him-or herself." The friendship model are more peers "rather than being involved in a hierarchical relationship." Lastly, the apprenticeship is about less "personal or social aspects... and the professional relationship is the sole focus".&lt;ref name="Buell2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Buell | first = Cindy | title = Models of Mentoring in Communication |journal = Communication Review | issue = 1 | issn = 1479-5795 |date = January 2004 |pages = 56–73 | volume = 53 | doi=10.1080/0363452032000135779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sub-groups of formal and informal mentoring relationships: peer mentoring relationships are relationships where individuals are at the same skill training, similar positions and stages of career. However, one person may be more knowledgeable in a certain aspect or another, but they can help each other to progress in their work. A lot of time, peer relationships provide a lot of support, empathy and advice because the situations are quite similar.

'''Situational mentoring''': Short-term relationships in which a person mentors for a specific purpose. This could be a company bringing an expert in regarding social media, or internet safety. This expert can mentor employees to make them more knowledgeable about a specific topic or skill.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''Supervisory mentoring''': This kind of mentoring has'go to' people who are supervisors. These are people who have answers to many questions, and can advise to take the best plan of action. This can be a conflict of interest relationship because many supervisors do not feel comfortable also being a mentor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://research.wustl.edu/Resources/PERCSS/library/Pages/mentoringtypes.aspx research.wustl.edu], Washington University in St. Louis.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mentoring circles''': Participants from all levels of the organization propose and own a topic. They then meet in groups to discuss the topic, which motivates them to grow and become more knowledgeable. Flash mentoring is ideal for job shadowing, reverse mentoring, and more.

'''Flash mentoring''': Creates a low-pressure environment for mentoring that focuses on single meetings rather than a traditional, long-term mentoring relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronus.com/modern-mentoring-flash-mentoring-for-organizations chronus.com], Chronus.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
[[File:Neo mentoring students 001.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mentor Neo Ntsoma (on the right) giving a workshop to young people.]]
Meta-analysis of 112 individual research studies found mentoring has significant behavioral, attitudinal, health-related, relational, motivational, and career benefits.&lt;ref name=Eby2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eby|first1=Lillian|last2=Allen|first2=Tammy|last3=Evans|first3=Sarah|last4=Ng|first4=Thomas|last5=DuBois|first5=David|title=Does mentoring matter?

These benefits for a mentee depend on which of the different (not mutually exclusive) functions is performed by the mentor. Originally, the concept of mentoring functions was developed based on [[qualitative research]] in a organizational context with functions being subsumed under two major factors: [[psychosocial support]] (e.g. [[Role model|role modeling]], friendship, emotional support, encouragement) and career-related support (e.g. providing advice, discussing goals).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kram|first=Kathy E.|date=1983|title=Phases of the Mentor Relationship|url=http://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/255910|journal=Academy of Management Journal|language=en|volume=26|issue=4|pages=608–625|doi=10.5465/255910|issn=0001-4273|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early quantitative approach found role modeling to be a distinct third factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scandura|first=Terri A.|last2=Ragins|first2=Belle Rose|date=1993|title=The Effects of Sex and Gender Role Orientation on Mentorship in Male-Dominated Occupations|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0001879183710468|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|volume=43|issue=3|pages=251–265|doi=10.1006/jvbe.1993.1046|issn=0001-8791|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mentoring for [[Academic achievement|college success]], a fourth function concerning knowledge transfer was additionally identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nora|first=Amaury|last2=Crisp|first2=Gloria|date=November 2007|title=Mentoring Students: Conceptualizing and Validating the Multi-Dimensions of a Support System|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2190/CS.9.3.e|journal=Journal of College Student Retention: Research, Theory &amp; Practice|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=337–356|doi=10.2190/cs.9.3.e|issn=1521-0251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later research also found this function in the context of mentoring [[creativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Form|first=Sven|last2=Schlichting|first2=Kerrin|last3=Kaernbach|first3=Christian|date=2017|title=Mentoring functions: Interpersonal tensions are associated with mentees’ creative achievement.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/aca0000103|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=440–450|doi=10.1037/aca0000103|issn=1931-390X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially in the workplace, there are also many benefits for an employer in developing a mentorship program for new and current employees.

'''Career development''': Setting up a career development mentoring program for employees enables an organization to help junior employees to learn the skills and behaviours from senior employees that the junior employees need to advance to higher-responsibility positions. This type of mentoring program can help to align organizational goals with employees' personal career goals (of progressing within the organization). It gives employees the ability to advance professionally and learn more about their work. This collaboration also gives employees a feeling of engagement with the organization, which can lead to better retention rates and increased employee satisfaction.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''High potential mentoring''': The most talented employees in organizations tend to be difficult to retain, as they are usually seeking greater challenges and responsibilities, and they are likely to leave for a different organization if they do not feel that they are being given the opportunity to develop. Top talent, whether in an innovation or management role, have incredible potential to make great things happen for an organization. Creating a mentoring program for high-potential employees that gives them one-on-one guidance from senior leaders can help to build the engagement of these talented employees, give them the opportunity to develop, and increase their retention in the organization.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''Diversity mentoring''': One of the top ways to innovate is by bringing in new ideas from senior employees and leaders from underrepresented groups (e.g., women, ethnic minorities, etc.). Who is an underrepresented group depends on the industry sector and country. In many Western countries, women and ethnic minorities are significantly underrepresented in executive positions and boards of directors. In some traditionally gender segregated occupations, such as [[education]] and [[nursing]], however, women may be the dominant gender in the workforce. Mentors from underrepresented groups can empower employees from underrepresented groups to increase their confidence to take on higher-responsibility tasks and prepare for leadership roles. By developing employees from diverse groups, this can give the organization access to new ideas, new ways of looking at problems, and new perspectives. This also brings cultural awareness and intercultural  dialogue into the workplace.{{cn|date=June 2018}}
[[File:119th Wing Airman promotes mentoring youth 150416-Z-WA217-001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A US Air Force member providing youth mentoring.]]
'''Reverse mentoring''': While mentoring typically involves a more experienced, typically older employee or leader providing guidance to a younger employee, the opposite approach can also be used. In the 2000s, with the rise of digital innovations, Internet applications and [[social media]], in some cases, new, young employees are more familiar with these technologies than senior employees in the organizations. The younger generations can help the older generations to expand and grow towards current trends. Everyone has something to bring to the table, this creates a "two way street" within companies where younger employees can see the larger picture, and senior employees can learn from young employees.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''Knowledge transfer mentoring''': Employees must have a certain set of skills in order to accomplish the tasks at hand. Mentoring is a great approach to help employees get organized, and give them access to an expert that can give feedback, and help answer questions that they may not know where to find answers to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chronus|title=Mentoring &amp; Talent Development Solutions|url=http://chronus.com/how-to-use-mentoring-in-your-workplace|website=chronus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mentorship provides critical benefits to individuals as well as organizations. Although mentorship can be important for an individual's career advancement, in the United States it historically has been most apparent in relation to the advancement of women and minorities in the workplace. Until recent decades, American men in dominant ethnic groups gained most of the benefits of mentorship without consciously identifying it as an advancement strategy. American women and minorities, in contrast, more pointedly identified and pursued mentorship in the second half of the twentieth century as they sought to achieve the professional success they had long been denied.&lt;ref name="Laird, Pamela Walker"/&gt;

In a 1958 study, Margaret Cussler showed that, for each female executive she interviewed who did not own her own company, "something—or someone—gave her a push up the ladder while others halted on a lower rung." Cussler concluded that the relationship between the "sponsor and protégé" (the vocabulary of "mentorship" was not yet in common use) was the "magic formula" for success.&lt;ref name="Cussler, Margaret"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cussler|first=Margaret|title=The Woman Executive|year=1958|publisher=Harcourt, Brace and Co.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1970s, numerous publications had established the centrality of mentorship to business success for everyone and particularly for women trying to break into the male-dominated business world. These publications noted the many specific benefits provided by mentorship, which included insider information, education, guidance, moral support, inspiration, sponsorship, an example to follow, protection, promotion, the ability to "bypass the hierarchy," the projection of the superior's "reflected power," access to otherwise invisible opportunities, and [[Tutor|tutelage]] in corporate politics.&lt;ref name="Laird, Pamela Walker"/&gt;

This literature also showed the value of these benefits. A ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' survey of 1,250 top executives published in 1979, for example, showed that most had been mentored or sponsored and that those who received such assistance reported higher income, a better education, a quicker path to achievement, and more job satisfaction than those who did not.&lt;ref name="Roche, Gerard R."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roche|first=Gerard R.|title=Much Ado about Mentors|journal=Harvard Business Review|date=January–February 1979|pages=14–28|volume=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The literature particularly emphasized the necessity of mentoring for businesswomen's success.&lt;ref name="Laird, Pamela Walker"/&gt; For example, although women made up less than one percent of the executives in the ''Harvard Business Review'' survey, all of these women reported being mentored.&lt;ref name="Roche, Gerard R."/&gt; In subsequent decades, as mentoring became a widely valued phenomenon in the United States, women and minorities in particular continued to develop mentoring relationships consciously as they sought professional advancement.&lt;ref name="Laird, Pamela Walker"/&gt;

==Contemporary research and practice in the US==
Research in the 1970s, partly in response to a study by [[Daniel Levinson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Seasons of a Man's Life |last1=Levinson |first1=Daniel S. |last2=Darrow |first2=C. N, |last3=Klein |first3=E. B. |last4=Levinson |first4=M. |year=1978 |location=New York |publisher=Random House. |isbn=0-394-40694-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; led some women and African Americans to question whether the classic "white male" model was available or customary for people who are newcomers in traditionally white male organizations. In 1978 [[Edgar Schein]] described multiple roles for successful mentors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Career Dynamics: Matching Individual and Organizational Needs |last1=Schein |first1=Edgar H. |publisher=Addison-Wesley |date=June 1978 |isbn=0-201-06834-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He identified seven types of mentoring roles in his book entitled, ''Career Dynamics: Matching individual and organizational needs'' (1978). He said that some of these roles require the teacher to be in a position of power such as "opener of doors, protector, sponsor and leader."{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Capability frameworks encourage managers to mentor staff. A manager can mentor their own staff, but more likely will mentor staff in other parts of their organisation, staff in special programs (such as graduate and leadership programs), staff in other organisations or members of professional associations.

Mentoring covers a range of roles. Articulating these roles is useful not only for understanding what role you play, but also for writing job applications. Demonstrating how you go about mentoring needs a language of behaviours.

Two of Schein's students, Davis and Garrison, undertook to study successful leaders of both genders and at least two races. Their research presented evidence for the roles of: cheerleader, coach, confidant, counsellor, developer of talent, "griot" (oral historian for the organization or profession), guardian, guru, inspiration, master, "opener of doors", patron, role model, pioneer, "seminal source", "successful leader", and teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davis, Jr |first1=Robert L. |last2=Garrison |first2=Patricia A. |year=1979 |title=Mentoring: in search of a typology (MIT Sloan Master Thesis)}}&lt;/ref&gt; They described multiple mentoring practices which have since been given the name of "mosaic mentoring" to distinguish this kind of mentoring from the single mentor approach.

Mosaic mentoring is based on the concept that almost everyone can perform one or another function well for someone else — and also can learn along one of these lines from someone else. The model is seen as useful for people who are "non-traditional" in a traditional setting, such as people of color and women in a traditionally white male organization. The idea has been well received in medical education literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Periyakoil, Vyjeyanthi S. |title=Journal of Palliative Medicine |date=October 2007 |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=1048–1049 |doi=10.1089/jpm.2006.9911 |journal=Journal of Palliative Medicine |pmid=17985959}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also mosaic mentoring programs in various faith-based organizations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Corporate programs==
[[File:MOI PA video mentoring (4476152064).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A NATO mentor trains two broadcasters on video editing and storytelling techniques.]] 
Corporate mentoring programs are used by mid-size to large organizations to further the development and retention of employees. Mentoring programs may be formal or informal and serve a variety of specific objectives including acclimation of new employees, skills development, employee retention and diversity enhancement.

===Formal programs===
Formal mentoring programs offer employees the opportunity to participate in an organized mentoring program. Participants join as a mentor, protégé or both by completing a mentoring profile. Mentoring profiles are completed as written forms on paper or computer or filled out via an online form as part of an online mentoring system. Protégés are matched with a mentor by a program administrator or a mentoring committee, or may self-select a mentor depending on the program format.

Informal mentoring takes places in organizations that develop a culture of mentoring but do not have formal mentoring in place. These companies may provide some tools and resources and encourage managers to accept mentoring requests from more junior members of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smartblogs.com/leadership/2012/04/13/how-can-corporate-mentoring-work-for-your-company/],''SmartBlog on Leadership'', 13 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of 1,162 employees found that "satisfaction with a mentoring relationship had a stronger impact on attitudes than the presence of a mentor, whether the relationship was formal or informal, or the design of a formal mentoring program."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ragins | first1 =  | last2 = Rose | first2 = Belle | last3 = Cotton | first3 = John L. | last4 = Miller | first4 = Janice S. | year = 2000 | title = Marginal mentoring: The effects of type of mentor, quality of relationship, and program design on work and career attitudes | url = | journal = Academy of Management Journal | volume = 43 | issue = 6| pages = 1177–1194 | doi=10.2307/1556344}}&lt;/ref&gt; So even when a mentoring relationship is established, the actual relationship is more important than the presence of a relationship.

Fortune 500 companies are also implementing formal mentoring programs on a global scale. [[Cardinal Health]] has had an enterprise-wide formal mentoring initiative in place since 2011. The initiative encompasses nine formal mentoring programs, some enterprise-wide and some limited to specific business segments and functions. Goals vary by program, with some focused on employees facing specific challenges or career milestones and others enabling more open-ended learning and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mentorcliq.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Cardinal-Health-Mentoring-Case-Study-Conducted-by-APQC-1.pdf|title=Cardinal Health INC Case Study - Technical Mentoring|last=|first=|date=2015|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New-hire programs===
New-hire mentoring programs are set up to help new employees acclimate more quickly into the organization. In new-hire mentoring programs, newcomers to the organization (protégés) are paired with more experienced people (mentors) in order to obtain information, good examples, and advice as they advance. It has been claimed that new employees who are paired with a mentor are twice as likely to remain in their job than those who do not receive mentorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kaye | first1 = Beverly |last2=Jordan-Evans| title = Love 'Em or Lose Em: Getting Good People to Stay| publisher = Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Inc | year = 2005 | location = San Francisco | page = 117 | isbn=978-1-57675-327-9 |first2=Sharon }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These mentoring relationships provide substance for career growth and benefit both the mentor and the protégé. For example, the mentor gets to show leadership by giving back and perhaps being refreshed about their own work. The organization receives an employee that is being gradually introduced and shaped by the organization's culture and operation because they have been under the mentorship of an experienced member. The person being mentored networks, becomes integrated easier in an organization, gets experience and advice along the way.&lt;ref name="Pompper2006"/&gt; It has been said that "joining a mentor's network and developing one's own is central to advancement" and this is possibly why those mentored tend to do well in their organizations.&lt;ref name="Pompper2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pompper |first1=D. |last2=Adams |first2=J. |title=Under the microscope: Gender and mentor-protege relationships |journal=Public Relations Review |issue=32 |pages=309–315 |publisher=Science Direct |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the organizational setting, mentoring usually "requires unequal knowledge",&lt;ref name="BozemanFeeney2007"/&gt; but the process of mentorship can differ. Bullis describes the mentoring process in the forms of phase models. Initially, the "mentee proves himself or herself worthy of the mentor's time and energy". Then cultivation occurs which includes the actual "coaching...a strong interpersonal bond between mentor and mentee develops". Next, under the phase of separation, "the mentee experiences more autonomy". Ultimately, there is more of equality in the relationship, termed by Bullis as Redefinition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bullis |first1=C. |last2=Bach |first2=W. B. |title=Are mentor relationships helping organizations? An exploration of developing mentee-mentor-organizational identification using turning point analysis |journal=Communication Quarterly |issue=3 |pages=199–213 |year=1989 |volume=37 |doi=10.1080/01463378909385540 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High-potential programs===
High-potential mentoring programs are used to groom up-and-coming employees deemed to have the potential to move up into [[leadership]] or executive roles. Here the employee (protégé) is paired with a senior-level leader (or leaders) for a series of [[career]]-[[coaching]] interactions. These programs tend to be smaller than more general mentoring programs and mentees must be selected based on a list of eligibility criteria to participate. Another method of high-potential mentoring is to place the employee in a series of jobs in disparate areas of an organization (e.g., human resources, sales, operations management, etc.) all for short periods of time, so they can learn in a "hands-on", practical fashion, about the organization's structure, culture, and methods.

==Matching approaches==
;Matching by committee
Mentees are matched with mentors by a designated mentoring committee or mentoring administrator usually consisting of senior members of the training, learning and development group and/or the human resources departments.  The matching committee reviews the mentors' profiles and the coaching goals sought out by the mentees and makes matches based on areas for development, mentor strengths, overall experience, skill set, location and objectives.

;Matching through self-match technology
Mentoring technology, typically based on computer software, can be used to facilitate matches allowing mentees to search and select a mentor based on their own development and coaching needs and interests. This mentee-driven methodology increases the speed in which matches are created and reduces the amount of administrative time required to manage the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nobscot.com/press/Workforce_Mentor-Scout-Client-Success-Story.pdf],''Matchmaker, Matchmaker Make Me a Mentor Match'', Workforce Magazine, 16 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of matches increases as well with self-match programs because the greater the involvement of the mentee in the selection of their mentor, the better the outcome of the mentorship.&lt;ref name="Allen TD, Eby LT, Lentz e 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=TD. |last2=Eby |first2=LT. |last3=Lentz |first3=E |title=Mentorship behaviors and mentorship quality associated with formal mentoring programs: closing the gap between research and practice |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=91 | issue = 3 |pages=567–578|year=2006 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.91.3.567|pmid=16737355 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of online mentoring technology programs available that can be utilized to facilitate this mentee-driven matching process.

;Speed mentoring
[[Speed Networking|Speed mentoring]] follows some of the procedures of [[speed dating]]. Mentors and mentees are introduced to each other in short sessions, allowing each person to meet multiple potential matches in a very short timeframe. Speed mentoring occur as a one-time event in order for people "to meet potential mentors to see if there is a fit for a longer term engagement."&lt;ref&gt;http://iainstitute.org/documents/mentoring/Speed-Mentoring-Procedures-on-site-event.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

==In education==
{{main|Peer mentoring}}
In many secondary and post-secondary schools, mentorship programs are offered to support students in program completion, confidence building and transitioning to further education or the workforce. There are also [[peer mentoring]] programs designed specifically to bring under-represented populations into science and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oied.ncsu.edu/divweb/msa/peer-mentor-program/|title=Think and Do The Extraordinary|website=oied.ncsu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Internet has brought university alumni closer to graduating students. Graduate university alumni are engaging with current students in career mentorship through interview questions and answers. The students with the best answers receive professional recommendations from industry experts build a more credible CV.

=== Instructional coaches ===

Instructional coaches are former teachers or principals that have shown effectiveness in their work of teaching or leading and go through additional training to learn more about the technical skills needed to be an effective coach.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The art of coaching: effective strategies for school transformation|last=Aguilar|first=Elena|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=2013|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her book ''The Art of Coaching'', Elena Aguilar recommends that a coach "must have been an effective teacher for at least five years."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though skills that were effective in the classroom are a must, the coach must also be confident in working with adults, bringing strong listening, communication, and data analysis skills to the coaching position.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Ultimately, an instructional coach is a former teacher who was successful in the classroom and is respected in the field, with the respect carrying over into this new position.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://piic.pacoaching.org/index.php/piic-coaching/what-is-an-instructional-coach|title=What is an Instructional Coach?|last=Dupree|first=Orlena|website=piic.pacoaching.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Activities ====
Coaches seek to work one-on-one with teachers or in a small group setting with teachers to build student achievement in the classroom based on data collected and discussed by both teacher or coach.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  According to Melinda Mangin and KaiLonnie Dunsmore, instructional coaching models may include: "cognitive coaching, clinical supervision, peer coaching and mentoring, formal literacy coaching, informal coaching, or a mixed model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Promoting quality assurance in literacy instruction: The preparation, inquiries and practices of literacy professionals|last=Bukowiecki|first=E.|publisher=New Foundations|year=2012|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=24–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have described categories of coaching such as data-oriented, student-oriented, managerial, and coaches who work with individual teachers or with groups of teachers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Coach" can mean many things: Five categories of literacy coaches in Reading First|last=Deussen|first=T.|last2=Coskie|first2=T.|last3=Robinson|first3=L.|last4=Autio|first4=E.|publisher=U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences, National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance|year=2007|isbn=|location=Washington D.C.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mangin|first=Melinda M.|last2=Dunsmore|first2=KaiLonnie|date=2014-05-14|title=How the Framing of Instructional Coaching as a Lever for Systemic or Individual Reform Influences the Enactment of Coaching|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0013161X14522814|journal=Educational Administration Quarterly|language=en|volume=51|issue=2|pages=179–213|doi=10.1177/0013161x14522814}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately, coaching roles are designed to increase teacher capacity and push teacher improvement through learning opportunities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The practice of instructional coaching is embedded within the work of a teacher, not in isolation of their everyday teaching.  In other words, the coach works with the teacher throughout the school year and meets during the school day with the teacher regarding current lessons, planning, and the observations/data collected.  The discussions between the instructional coach and teacher are built upon mutual respect and a trusting relationship through confidentiality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Overall, instructional coaching is meant to serve as professional development for the teacher(s).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A coach's main responsibility in this way is to change practice and build knowledge on "new instructional materials, programs, and initiatives" with the teacher.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;   This professional development can come through discussion, but also can come in other forms.  Instructional coaches can model lessons and instructional strategies in the teachers' classroom to show examples and have teachers feel more confident in using these strategies.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Instructional Coaching: A Partnership Approach to Improving Instruction|last=Knight|first=J.|publisher=Corwin Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teacher observations is one of the most powerful ways that coaches can put data for change in front of teachers.  Coaches doing observations and collecting data to debrief with teachers helps paint a picture for teacher improvement.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Effectiveness ====
According to a three-year research study done by the Pennsylvania Institute for Instructional Coaching, there was an increase in student success when instructional coaching was used in the classroom.  This, however, could not be viewed as solely "instructional coaching" in isolation of other factors.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://piic.pacoaching.org/images/PIICdocuments/Research_and_Eval/piic_report_abstract.pdf|title=Instructional Coaching and  Student Outcomes: Findings from a Three Year Pilot Study|last=Medrich|first=E.A.|last2=Fitzgerald|first2=R.|date=2013|website=|access-date=March 20, 2017|last3=Skomsvold|first3=P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The coaching "model emphasizes the simultaneous use of four strategies: one-on-one teacher engagement; evidence-based literacy practices applied across the curriculum; data analytics; and reflection on practice."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Yet, teachers have shared that:

* Ninety-one percent of teachers coached regularly stated that coaches helped them understand and use new teaching strategies.
* Seventy-nine percent of teachers coached regularly said that their coach played a significant role in improving their classroom instruction and practice.
* Teachers who were regularly coached one-on-one reported that:
** They made significant changes in their instructional practice.
** Their students were more engaged in the classroom and enthusiastic about learning.
** Attendance increased dramatically in their classes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In addition to this, "the most effective professional development model is thought to involve follow-up activities, usually in the form of long-term support, coaching in teachers' classrooms, or ongoing interaction with colleagues."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ball|first=D. L.|date=1996|title=Teacher Learning and the Mathematics Reforms:  What We Think We Know and What We Need to Learn|url=|journal=The Phi Delta Kappan|volume=77|pages=500–508}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In most cases, instructional coaching can provide this support and meet this definition of effective professional development.

===== Administrative support =====
There should also be support from administration around the instructional coaching to align the work of the coach and teacher with the school's mission or vision.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Knight focuses on the partnership with the principal being at the core of successful coaching.  Knight explains that the principal and the instructional coach need to be aligned in their goals for the coaching occurring.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  If they have differing desired outcomes for teaching, then the teacher will be receiving mixed messages and caught between improvement and a standstill.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Aguilar suggests that coaches continually ask about the school's goals as well as action steps to meet these and bring into daily coaching.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===== Data-driven strategies =====
In conjunction with this partnership and observations, Knight's belief of data usage is critical for teacher improvement during coaching sessions.  Knight shares how giving opinions and telling a teacher how to improve stops the learning for the teacher and instead creates a barrier between the coach and teacher and makes the teacher expect hand-holding.  Instead, the data needs to tell a story for the teacher to determine moves to try to improve.  This allows ownership for the teacher as well as understanding of their work in conjunction with the work.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===== Relationship building =====
The relationship and trust between the coach and coachee are a critical component of coaching.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  A coach having specific content knowledge and respect in a teacher's field of teaching would help build trust. Another way to build this trust is through confidentiality.  By keeping all conversations confidential and sticking to that, the coachee knows that your word is good.  In addition to relationship building, it is important to let the coachee feel comfortable talking to you about anything—there may need to be the time when a crisis they are facing trumps conversation about the lesson.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Starting a coaching conversation about how life is going for a coachee is also important to relationship building.

===== Content and pedagogical knowledge =====
According to Nelson and Sassi, "knowledge of pedagogical process and content knowledge must be fused" in both understanding teaching and observing teaching.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Barbara Scott|last2=Sassi|first2=Annette|date=2016-06-29|title=Shifting Approaches to Supervision: The Case of Mathematics Supervision|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00131610021969100|journal=Educational Administration Quarterly|language=en|volume=36|issue=4|pages=553–584|doi=10.1177/00131610021969100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, an instructional coach that is working with a math teacher should know "current mathematics education reform efforts are built on the notion that the ideas in a subject, and the ways in which students and teachers work with the ideas, matter."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shulman|first=L.|date=1986|title=Those who understand: Knowledge growth in teaching. Educational Researcher|url=|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=57|pages=4–14|doi=10.3102/0013189x015002004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It seems clear that a deep pedagogical knowledge as well as deep content specific knowledge are required for the teacher to have confidence in the coach and for the coach to be able to step in and assume the role of the teacher.

Knowledge that coaches need to be effective span just content and pedagogical knowledge.  Aguilar uses the ladder of inference to allow coaches to evaluate their own thoughts, and ultimately use this ladder to help principals and teachers evaluate their own beliefs before jumping to assumptions. Aguilar states that her "list of beliefs has changed over the years. You can change yours, too.  The point is to be mindful of the beliefs from which we're working and to notice the effect of working from those beliefs." Beliefs can change about approaches to teaching, classroom management, or even content knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Blended mentoring==
Blended mentoring is an implementation of information technology (IT) into the traditional mentoring program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Celia|first=Argente-Linares, Eva{{!}}Pérez-López, M. Carmen{{!}}Ordóñez-Solana,|date=2016/00/00|title=Practical Experience of Blended Mentoring in Higher Education.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1127848|journal=Mentoring &amp; Tutoring: Partnership in Learning|language=en|volume=24|issue=5|issn=1361-1267}}&lt;/ref&gt;, intended to give to career counseling and development services the opportunity to adopt mentoring in their ordinary practice.

==Reverse mentoring==
In the reverse mentoring situation, the mentee has less overall experience (typically as a result of age) than the mentor (who is typically older), but the mentee has more knowledge in a particular area, and as such, reverses the typical constellation. Examples are when young internet or mobile savvy [[millennial generation]] teens train executives in using their high end [[smartphone]]s. They in turn sometimes offer insight in business processes.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Business mentoring==
The concept of mentoring has entered the business domain as well. This is different from being an [[apprentice]]; a business mentor provides guidance to a business owner or an [[entrepreneur]] on the entrepreneur's business&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/271908|title=10 Places to Find Mentors and Advisors for Entrepreneurs|last=DeMers|first=Jayson|date=2016-03-17|work=Entrepreneur|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. An apprentice learns a trade by working on the job with the "employer".

A 2012 literature review by EPS-PEAKS investigated the practice of business mentoring, with a focus on the [[MENA|Middle-East and North Africa region]].&lt;ref&gt;Pompa, C. (2012) [http://partnerplatform.org/?dk6sxm5w Literature Review on enterprise mentoring]. [http://partnerplatform.org/eps-peaks EPS-PEAKS] query response.&lt;/ref&gt; The review found strong evidence to suggest that business mentoring can have real benefits for entrepreneurs, but highlights some key factors that need to be taken into account when designing mentoring programmes for this to be the case, such as the need to balance a formal and informal approach and to appropriately match mentors and mentees.

The '''Ministry of Science and Higher Education''' ({{lang-pl|Ministerstwo Nauki i Szkolnictwa Wyższego}}) in [[Poland]] was opened on 5 May 2006 by the Minister of Science and Higher Education, in replacement of several parts of the Ministry of Education and Science. The Minister of Science and Higher Education administers governmental activities in [[science]] and [[higher education]] and has a budget for scientific [[research]] provided by State funds. The [[Rada Nauki]] (Science Council) acts together with the Minister, in replacement of the [[Komitet Badań Naukowych]] (Science Research Council) which was closed in 2005. The headquarters of the ministry are located at ulica Wspólna 1/3, [[Warsaw]].

The current Minister of Science and Higher Education is [[Jarosław Gowin]].

A '''monograph''' is a specialist work of writing (in contrast to [[reference work]]s)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Campbell |first1=Robert |last2=Pentz |first2=Ed |last3=Borthwick |first3=Ian |date=2012 |title=Academic and Professional Publishing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IpRlAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-1-78063-309-1 |quote='[M]onograph' has become a catch-all term for a book that is not of a reference type, that is of primary material}}.&lt;/ref&gt; on a single subject or an aspect of a subject, often by a single author, and usually on a scholarly subject. 

In library cataloging, ''monograph'' has a broader meaning, that of a nonserial publication complete in one [[Volume (bibliography)|volume]] (book) or a definite number of volumes. Thus it differs from a [[periodical publication|serial]] publication such as a [[magazine]], [[academic journal|journal]], or [[newspaper]].&lt;ref&gt;Prytherch, Raymond John, ''Harrod's librarians' glossary and reference book: a directory of over 10,200 terms, organizations, projects and acronyms in the areas of information management, library science, publishing and archive management'', 10th edn (Aldershot, Hants, England ; Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2005), p. 462.; "For the purpose of library cataloging, any nonserial publication, complete in one volume or intended to be completed in a finite number of parts issued at regular or irregular intervals, containing a single work or collection of works. Monographs are sometimes published in monographic series and subseries. Compare with book."[http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#monograph]&lt;/ref&gt; In this context only, books such as [[novel]]s are monographs.__FORCETOC__

== In academia ==
{{See also|Monographic series}}
The term "monographia" is derived from the Greek "mono" (single) and ''grapho'' (to write), meaning "writing on a single subject".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.phytojournal.com/archives/?year=2018&amp;vol=7&amp;issue=4&amp;ArticleId=5296&amp;si=false |title=Development of monograph and study of variation in chemical constituent of plant Balanites roxburghii |journal=Journal of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry |volume=7 |issue=4 |year=2018 |access-date=8 October 2018 |pages=2369-2371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a textbook, which surveys the state of knowledge in a field, the main purpose of a monograph is to present primary research and original scholarship ascertaining reliable credibility to the required recipient. This research is presented at length, distinguishing a monograph from an article. For these reasons, publication of a monograph is commonly regarded as vital for career progression in many academic disciplines. Intended for other researchers and bought primarily by libraries, monographs are generally published as individual volumes in a short print run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/00012530910932294 |title=The role and future of the monograph in arts and humanities research|journal=Aslib Proceedings |volume=61 |pages=67 |year=2009 |last1=Williams |first1=Peter |last2=Stevenson|first2=Iain|last3=Nicholas|first3=David|last4=Watkinson|first4=Anthony|last5=Rowlands|first5=Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain and the U.S., what differentiates a scholarly monograph from an academic trade title varies by publisher, though generally it is the assumption that the readership has not only specialized or sophisticated knowledge but also professional interest in the subject of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=John B. |title=Books in the Digital Age: The Transformation of Academic and Higher Education Publishing in Britain and the United States |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge |year=2005 |isbn=978-0745634784 |pages=84-85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In art ==
Book publishers use the term "artist monograph" to indicate books dealing with a single artist, as opposed to broader surveys of art subjects.

== In biology ==

In biological taxonomy a monograph is a comprehensive treatment of a [[taxon]]. Monographs typically review all known species within a group, add any newly discovered species, and collect and synthesize available information on the ecological associations, geographic distributions, and morphological variations within the group. See this reference as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=|title=Revision of the Triatominae (Hemiptera, Reduviidae), and their significance as vectors of Chagas' disease |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/89400#/summary |journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History|volume=163|issue=3|pages=125-520|hdl=2246/1282 |author1=Lent, Herman |author2=Wygodzinsky, Pedro W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first-ever monograph of a plant taxon was [[Robert Morison]]'s 1672 ''Plantarum Umbelliferarum Distributio Nova'', a treatment of the [[Apiaceae]].&lt;ref name="Vines 1913"&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Sydney Howard Vines|Vines, Sydney Howard]] | year = 1913 | chapter = Robert Morison 1620–1683 and John Ray 1627–1705 | editor = [[Francis Wall Oliver|Oliver, Francis Wall]] (ed.) | title = Makers of British Botany | publisher = Cambridge University Press | page = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In United States Food and Drug Administration regulation ==
{{See also|Pharmacopoeia}}
In the context of [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulation, monographs represent published standards by which the use of one or more substances is automatically authorized. For example, the following is an excerpt from the ''[[Federal Register]]'': "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a final rule in the form of a final monograph establishing conditions under which over-the-counter (OTC) sunscreen drug products are [[generally recognized as safe and effective]] and not misbranded as part of FDA's ongoing review of OTC drug products."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98fr/052199b.txt |work=Federal Register|date= May 21, 1999 |volume= 64|number= 98 |series=Rules and Regulations |pages=27666–27693|title=DOCID:fr21my99-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such usage has given rise to the use of the word monograph as a verb, as in "this substance has been monographed by the FDA".

The '''National Library of Peru''' ({{lang-es|Biblioteca Nacional del Perú}}) is the [[national library]] of [[Peru]], located in [[Lima, Peru|Lima]]. It is the country's oldest and most important library. Like the majority of Peruvian libraries, it is a non-circulating library. It has two branches. The old building is on Abancay Avenue ([[Lima District]]) and the modern building is on Javier Prado Avenue ([[San Borja District]]). Both are open to the public.

== History ==

The library was founded by [[José de San Martín]] in 1821, after he donated his collection of books and praised the new library as: "... one of the most efficient mediums to place into circulation our intellectual values." The library has various duties, among which it must formulate, conduct, supervise, and evaluate the fulfillment of policies and plans of development of library service within a national and international sphere for educational purposes. These and other administrative decisions concerning the library also depend on the ministry of education of the country.

Historically, the library has passed through various phases of restructuring since its foundation. During the [[War of the Pacific]], the Chilean army, after taking Lima, ransacked various items along with much capital stock from the library. Peruvian author and scholar [[Ricardo Palma]], who was director of the library in 1884, noted in one of his recounts that of the 56,000 works the library possessed before the war, only 378 were left at the end of the occupation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} In 2007, 3,778 books were returned to Peru from Chile.&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes2007"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E1DE113DF934A35752C1A9619C8B63 Chile: Plundered Books Returned]&lt;/ref&gt; There are current talks between the director of the library and Chilean authorities on identifying works which might belong to Peru that would be eventually returnable. Another significant event the library has gone through was a fire which almost completely destroyed the grounds of the library on May 10, 1943, in which various highly valued historical works were lost.&lt;ref name="lostmemoryunesco"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/webworld/mdm/administ/pdf/LOSTMEMO.PDF LOST MEMORY - LIBRARIES AND ARCHIVES DESTROYED IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY] ( {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607035711/http://www.unesco.org/webworld/mdm/administ/pdf/LOSTMEMO.PDF |date=June 7, 2011 }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=7d1_XtHDLsM|title=Carlos Aguirre: El incendio de la Biblioteca Nacional del Perú de 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new building was erected on the same grounds of the old library along with a training center for future librarian administrators.

==Modernization==

The National Library of Peru is currently undergoing a modernization program which aspires to turn the library into one of Latin America's most modern libraries. It is located in Lima's [[San Borja District|San Borja]] district. After years of financial planning for the new building, the government of Peru financially collaborated to finish the building, along with a loan of up to seven million dollars from [[Spain]] to equip the new library with modern equipment. According to official sources from the library, it is said to have a bibliographic patrimony valued at around 400 million dollars. Among historical works the library has is the first book printed in Lima in 1584 along with other historical books dating back to colonial times. The new library will also attempt to connect to other Peruvian libraries in an effort to create an online national catalog of books and other materials for better research.

The new library was officially inaugurated on March 27, 2006. To mark the occasion, the then Minister of Education, [[Javier Sota Nadal]], commissioned a symphonic poem from Peruvian composer [[Jimmy Lopez]]. The work titled, "America Salvaje", is inspired by the poem "Blasón" by [[José Santos Chocano]]. President [[Alejandro Toledo]] and National Library director Sinesio López were present at the inauguration. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10418">'''Nicolás Ruiz Espadero''' (February 15, 1832 – August 30, 1890) was a Cuban [[pianist]], [[composer]], [[piano teacher]] and [[editing|editor]] of the posthumous works of American composer-pianist [[Louis Moreau Gottschalk]].&lt;ref&gt;(Carpentier 2001), pp. 194-203. The work by Alejo Carpentier is indispensable for the study of Cuban music. Although written in the early 1940s and never revised, it is by far the best monograph on Cuban music available today.&lt;/ref&gt;

Espadero was born and died in [[Havana]].  In his time, he was the most famous Cuban composer, the only one published abroad, the only one who, at least in the eyes of his Cuban contemporaries, could compete with composers from [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, the article in Fetis’ famous dictionary on musicians: '''Espadero''', pianiste et compositeur, ''instrumentiste de premier ordre et musicien plein de talent'', est né en 1835 à la Havane ; élève d'Arizti, ses œuvres pour piano ont toute la saveur de la musique de Gottschalk , avec quelque chose de plus puissant et de plus profond. '''Translation:''' Espadero, pianist and composer, ''instrumentalist of the first rank and a musician full of talent.'' Pupil of Arizti. His piano works have all the taste of the music of Louis Moreau Gottschalk, but they are more powerful and more profound (Fetis 1878), p. 307. Italics added.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet of all the Cuban composers of the 19th and early 20th century he was the most parochial and idiosyncratic one. Without schooling and formal musical training, he grew into a chronically shy person, emotionally dependent on his mother. He composed and continually practised, but gave few concerts and had little contact with other people. Espadero never left [[Cuba]], indeed he seldom ever left [[Havana]] or his own house, where he lived with seventeen cats, surrounded by stacks of European music scores. Universally described as a recluse, he died from accidental burns after his usual bath in alcohol - one of several musicians to die of rather unnatural causes ([[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] and [[Charles-Valentin Alkan]] would be among some of the other ones).

Although brought up in a cosmopolitan atmosphere and surrounded by black [[Cuban music]], he was the one Cuban composer who adopted but little of the local music tradition that inspired [[Manuel Saumell]] before and [[Ignacio Cervantes]] after him. He had numerous pupils, and some of them became prominent musicians themselves. Nothing of Espadero’s music has remained in the repertoire, yet his later pieces – allegedly his best output, albeit never printed - remain to be investigated. A CD with a selection of his piano music came out in 2006.

==Biography==

===Culture and society===
Espadero was born in [[Havana]],&lt;ref&gt;Havana had 119.000 inhabitants in 1856, not counting the slaves, as Morelet writes.  (Morelet 1857), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cuba]]. Cuba was then still a Spanish colony and in all matters of administration, economy and interior and exterior policy dependent on [[Madrid]]. The island was a colonial backwater, infested by [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]]. Cuba's society was sharply divided into a privileged class of landowners and Spanish colonial administrators – and black and mulatto slaves. Virtually no middle class existed. Of more than two millions blacks, less than 35,000 were free.

===Descent and parents===

Espadero was born in Havana, Cuba. His mother was a pianist from Cadiz who distinguished herself in the Havana salons around 1810 performing Haydn and Mozart. His father, Don Nicolás Ruiz, was a civil servant in the colonial administration. As is often the case in well-to-do families, the father wanted his only son to become a lawyer, an officer or an administrator – but not a musician. Although proud of his wife's musical talents and flattered by his son's nascent artistic abilities, Espadero's father would only permit half an hour's piano lesson every day. But young Espadero's talent proved too strong. From an early age on he showed exceptional ability at the piano. With his mother's complicity young Espadero would play the piano several hours every day.

===Musical training: 1840–1853===

Espadero never went to school and thus never enjoyed a structured formal education. What education he had received came from pieces and fragments from European, especially Spanish, culture, from selected and very mixed readings and from the surroundings of Cuban upper-class society. Havana had an opera house, the Teatro Colón, but the only operas, sung and acted by imported itinerant opera troupes, were mostly by Bellini, Donizetti and later Verdi.

On July 8, 1844, Polish pianist and composer [[Julian Fontana]], a close friend of Frédéris Chopin, gave a series of concerts and recitals in Havana playing works by Liszt, Chopin, Thalberg and himself. This was the first time that music by Chopin was played in Cuba. Fontana stayed a year and a half (until November 1845) in Havana giving concerts, composing and teaching. Espadero was among Fontana’s piano students.

By the time he was twenty, he had already traces of the withdrawn and unsociable character that would grow into in middle and later life. Carpentier characterizes him thus:

:He did not have friends his own age, living exclusively with his family, under the constant vigilance of his mother. (...) He was sixteen when his father, without previous warning, dropped dead in his presence. This blow, the widowhood, the long mourning period, further reduced, if that were possible, Espadero’s horizon. He would not go out, did not accept invitations, and would not frequent the promenades.  He spent his days reading, drawing, and composing. At twilight, he would go to a music store close to his house to play the piano until eight o’clock at night. He could not tolerate a presence at his side at those moments. His adolescent neurosis became more pronounced with the passing of time, making him appear unsociable, sullen or weird.&lt;ref&gt;(Carpentier 2001), p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life and death: 1870-1890===
Carpentier postulates that Espadero came to believe that in his youth he had been overly influenced by bravura piano music by composers such as [[Sigismond Thalberg]], [[Émile Prudent]], and [[Joseph Ascher]], among others. He then turned to composing according to classical European musical forms. He wrote a [[piano trio]], a [[scherzo]], a [[sonata]], and various longer études. None of it he saw in print. As soon as Espadero started to eschew the bravura pieces of the day, publishers were no longer interested in his music.

This rejection of his more serious efforts may have contributed his state of mind. The death of his mother in 1885 came as an almost devastating blow to him. Although he was now free to travel and leave Cuba, he did exactly the opposite – he became a total recluse. During his last years Espadero isolated himself almost totally from society, living only for his cats and his piano. Carpentier writes: ''He distanced himself from his colleagues, gruffly reproaching them for not having created a serious institution for the teaching of music.''&lt;ref&gt;(Carpentier 2001), p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; This anti-social behaviour may have been aggravated by obsessive-compulsive disorder. The most recent of Espadero’s biographers writes that Espadero could not enter a house without having to rearrange the furniture to suit his orderliness.&lt;ref&gt;(Ferrer 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

Even his sudden and tragic death had its cause in Espadero's neurotic behaviour. For a long time he had had the habit of taking baths in alcohol. On August 22, 1890, he again took an alcohol bath. After the bath, however, he did not rub himself completely dry. When he tried to extinguish a gas light, he was suddenly engulfed by flames and suffered horrifying burns. He died eight days later. Considering the mental state of Espadero prior to his death and his long years of neurotic and increasingly bizarre behaviour, some of his biographers speculated that his death was actually a suicide.

Since Espadero died childless, his estate was scattered. Much of it, among them many unprinted manuscripts, must be considered lost.

In this system, 1 is always the root or origin, but the scale being represented may be [[major scale|major]], [[minor scale|minor]], or any of the diatonic [[mode (music)|mode]].  Accidentals (sharps and flats outside the [[key signature]]) are noted with a + or - when the numbers are written, but are often skipped when they are spoken or sung.

In some pedagogies involving numerical sight-singing notation students are not taught to modify vowels to represent sharp or flat notes. In these cases the students usually name the note and whether it is flat or sharp.&lt;ref&gt;Humphries, Lee. [http://www.thinkingapplied.com/sight-singing_folder/sight-singing.pdf ''Learning to Sight-Sing: The Mental Mechanics of Aural Imagery.''] Minneapolis: Thinking Applied, 2008, No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an augmented unison ("ouey") might be called "one sharp," and in some other pedagogies this same pitch may also simply be called "one."

There is a continual debate about the merits of this system as compared to [[solfege]]: it holds the advantage that when dealing with abstract concepts such as interval distance a student may easily recognize that the distance between 1 and 5 is larger than the distance between 1 and 4 because of the numerical values assigned (as compared to Solfege, where comparing Do to Sol and Do to Fa remain completely abstract until sung or played). A drawback often pointed out is that numerical numbers are not always "singable," for example, scale degree 7 (ti, in solfege) contains vowels that are hard to tune.

Numerical sight singing is not the same as integer notation derived from [[set theory (music)|musical set theory]] and used primarily for sight singing [[atonal]] music. Nor is it the same as "[[count singing]]", a technique popularized by [[Robert Shaw (conductor)|Robert Shaw]] in which the numbers sung represent the rhythms of a piece in accordance with the beat of a measure.

It is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) corporation based in Broward County, Florida. The company was originally established in Virginia as PAIRS, Ltd. in 1983 and as The PAIRS Foundation, Inc. in Florida in 2000. In 2010, PAIRS, Ltd. formally merged into The PAIRS Foundation, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunbiz.org Florida Department of State]&lt;/ref&gt;

PAIRS Foundation owns copyright to marriage and relationship education programs that are taught by instructors worldwide who are trained, certified and licensed by the foundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://consumer.pairs.com/directory.php PAIRS Instructors]&lt;/ref&gt; and to the trademark,  "skills for successful relationships".

==Mission==

PAIRS Foundation's mission is to "teach those attitudes, emotional understandings, and behaviors that nurture and sustain healthy relationships and to make this knowledge broadly available on behalf of a safer, saner, more loving world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://instructor.pairs.com/history.html PAIRS Mission]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The PAIRS 120-hour semester course was   developed in 1975 by marriage and family therapist Lori Heyman Gordon as a graduate program for counseling students at [[American University]] in Washington, D.C.; it was one of the first comprehensive educational programs in the United States that sought to reduce marriage and family breakdown through [[Relationship Education]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Lori Heyman. "Passage to Intimacy", Fireside Books, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  The course integrated and  work by  [[Virginia Satir]], [[Daniel Harold Casriel|Daniel Casriel]], [[Murray Bowen]], [[James Framo]], George Bach, Gordon and others.&lt;ref&gt;DeMaria, Rita. "Building Intimate Relationships", "The Saga of PAIRS." Routledge, December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Casriel_website"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Lori Heyman|title=From the road to happiness to a relationship roadmap for couples|url=http://danielcasriel.com/2017/08/22/from-the-road-to-happiness-to-a-relationship-roadmap-for-couples/|website=DanielCasriel.com|publisher=Purpose Built Families Foundation|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A 1982 [[Washington Post]] article featured PAIRS as a new alternative to traditional [[Family Therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2011/03/31/couples-can-this-marriage-be-saved-331 McNees, Pat. "Can This Marriage Be Saved," Washington Post, November 29, 1982.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1992 and 1997, Carlos Durana, Ph.D., conducted early studies on the impact of the program, many of which were published in industry journals. During that period, articles about the program appeared in ''Newsweek'', ''Time'', ''Cosmopolitan,''  '' Ladies Home Journal'' and ''Psychology Today'' Gordon was also featured in interviews on CNN, NBC's Today Show, Geraldo, The Gordon Elliot Show, and CBN.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Lori Heyman. "If You Really Loved Me", Science and Behavior, Palo Alto (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation began piloting intensive couples seminars, ranging from one to four days, in the late nineties. A December 1998 ''New Woman'' magazine cover story featured the first-person account of Molly and Chris Hanson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pairs.com/marriage_makeover.html Hanson, Molly. "PAIRS Marriage Makeover," New Woman Magazine, December 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 2000, the foundation's CEO Seth Eisenberg was a guest on ABC's ''[[Politically Incorrect]] with Bill Maher'' to discuss Florida's Marriage Preparation and Preservation Act, mandating relationship skills training in high schools and for couples applying for marriage licenses. O .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/detail/tv-show.aspx?tvobjectid=203828&amp;more=ucepisodelist&amp;episodeid=2480254  - TV Guide, Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Gordon was recognized with the Impact Award of the Coalition for Marriage, Family and Couples Education:&lt;ref&gt;[http://instructor.pairs.com/history.html PAIRS History]&lt;/ref&gt;

PAIRS was awarded a $5 million federal grant in 2006 by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]], [[Administration for Children and Families]], to provide classes and conduct a five-year evaluation of the program's impact among English, Spanish and French/Creole-speaking couples and singles in Florida's Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2010/04/14/marriages-families-jobs/ Falciglia, Amanda. "Study offers hope for marriages, families, and jobs," FatherhoodChannel.com, April 14, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, PAIRS was featured in a [[Time magazine]] cover story by Belinda Luscombe, "Who Needs Marriage?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2032116,00.html Luscombe, Belinda. "Who Needs Marriage," Time Magazine, November 18, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Another [[Time Magazine]] story that month featured a PAIRS [[iPhone]] App and questioned, "Can an iPhone App Save Your Marriage?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthland.time.com/2010/11/01/can-an-iphone-app-save-your%C2%A0marriage/ Luscombe, Belinda. "Can an iPhone App Save Your Marriage," Time Magazine, November 1, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] [[Veterans Health Administration]] featured PAIRS in an article about helping Veterans strengthen "their most significant relationships":

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Department of Veterans Affairs is trying a new path to caring for and healing the nation's wounded Veterans. Now, in addition to repairing their damaged bodies and minds, VA is going one step further and helping to repair their crumbling intimate relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.va.gov/health/NewsFeatures/20121018a.asp Peterson, Hans. "Relationship Retreats: From Warriors to Soul Mates," Veterans Health Administration, October 18, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also in October 2012, PAIRS Foundation's collaboration with the San Diego VA Healthcare System was recognized with the "Spirit of Planetree Award" for the program's impact strengthening relationships between "family, friends and social supports as a central component of patient-centered care."&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2012/10/04/pairs-collaboration-with-va-recognized-with-prestigious-2012-spirit-of-planetree-award-104/ Henthorn, Robert. "PAIRS Collaboration with VA Recognized with Prestigious 2012 Spirit of Planetree Award," FatherhoodChannel.com, October 4, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetree.org/?page_id=2327 2012 Planetree Program Awards, Human Interactions/Independence, Dignity and Choice.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a joint effort with the Department of Veterans Affairs Patient-Centered Care and Cultural Transformation Initiative, PAIRS Foundation published the ''PAIRS Essentials VA Program Support Guide'' in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/pairs/docs/va_support PAIRS Essentials VA Program Support Guide, January 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation produced a video in May 2014 promoting the Warrior to Soul Mate program, supported by the PAIRS curriculum, as a valuable component of VA's efforts to promote health and wellness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1qDGaW-PbM U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation. "Health for Life: Strengthening Relationships through the Warrior to Soul Mate Program," Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation, May 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation Sacred Trust==

In September 2011, the foundation's [[Operation Sacred Trust]] initiative, launched in collaboration with [[Carrfour Supportive Housing]], Henderson Behavioral Health, and Neighborhood Housing Services of South Florida, was awarded a $1 million grant from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Supportive Services for Veteran Families ("SSVF"), to help end homelessness for Veteran families in Broward and Miami-Dade counties. An additional $1 million was awarded in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.va.gov/homeless/ssvf.asp U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Supportive Services for Veteran Families website]&lt;/ref&gt; Two November 11, 2012 articles featured Operation Sacred Trust as a new model for ending homelessness for veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lilly|first=Christiana|title=Operation Sacred Trust Combats Veteran Homelessness In South Florida With $1 Million Grant |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/08/homeless-veterans-operation-sacred_n_2093151.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berman-Eisenberg|first=Stephanie|title=A step forward for homeless vets|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/11/11/3090081/a-step-forward-for-homeless-vets.html|publisher=Miami Herald|date=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 12, 2012, a CBS News story featured Operation Sacred Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newland|first=Maggie|title=Miami Man Turns Life Around, Gives Back to Fellow Veterans|url=http://miami.cbslocal.com/2012/11/12/miami-man-turns-life-around-gives-back-to-fellow-veterans/|publisher=CBS Miami|date=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage Equality==

Following the 2014 ruling of [[Robert Lewis Hinkle|U.S. District Judge Robert L. Hinkle]] that Florida's same sex marriage ban violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Court Rules that Florida Ban on Marriage for Same-Sex Couples is Unconstitutional|url=https://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/federal-court-rules-florida-ban-marriage-same-sex-couples-unconstitutional/|publisher=ACLU|date=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; PAIRS Foundation began offering ''PAIRS for Love, for Life'' classes in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade]] and [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]], Florida specifically geared to committed, engaged and married same sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://equality.pairs.com PAIRS Classes for Same Sex Couples]&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Florida's 1998 Marriage Preparation and Preservation Act, completion of the PAIRS class allows same sex couples to receive a discount on marriage licenses and exemption from Florida's typical three-day waiting period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.flrules.org/1998/403 Florida Marriage Preparation and Preservation Act of 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curricula==

"PAIRS Essentials" is a nine-hour curriculum delivered in a group setting, with a PAIRS Instructor, often over a weekend, or in several weekly class sessions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://training.pairs.com/essentials/overview.php PAIRS Essentials Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;  "PAIRS For Our Future, For Our Family" is a 30-hour curriculum typically delivered over 12 weekly 2-1/2 hour sessions "&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2012/10/17/national-marriage-education-study-117/ Henthorn, Robert.

'''Paulo Reglus Neves Freire''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|r|ɛər|i}}; {{IPA-pt|ˈpawlu ˈfɾeiɾi|lang}}; September 19, 1921 – May 2, 1997) was a [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] [[educator]] and [[philosophy|philosopher]] who was a leading advocate of [[critical pedagogy]]. He is best known for his influential work, ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]'', generally considered one of the foundational texts of the critical pedagogy movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justinwyllie.net/essays/pedagogy_oppressed.pdf|title=The New Observer|publisher=Justinwyllie.net|date=|accessdate=2012-11-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916224840/http://www.justinwyllie.net/essays/pedagogy_oppressed.pdf|archivedate=2012-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/10/26/why-paulo-freires-pedagogy-of-the-oppressed-is-just-as-relevant-today-as-ever/|title=Why Paulo Freire's "Pedagogy of the Oppressed" is just as relevant today as ever|author=Sima Barmania|publisher=Blogs.independent.co.uk|date=2011-10-26|accessdate=2012-11-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430215016/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/10/26/why-paulo-freires-pedagogy-of-the-oppressed-is-just-as-relevant-today-as-ever/|archivedate=2012-04-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-freir.htm|title=Paulo Freire and informal education|publisher=Infed.org|date=2012-05-29|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Freire was born on September 19, 1921 to a [[middle-class]] family in [[Recife]], [[Pernambuco]], [[Brazil]]. He became familiar with [[poverty]] and [[hunger]] from an early age, during the [[Great Depression]]. In 1931, his family moved to the less expensive city of [[Jaboatão dos Guararapes]]. On October 31, 1934, his father died.&lt;ref&gt;Freire, P. (1996). ''Letters to Cristina: reflections on my life and work''. New York, NY: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; 

During his [[childhood]] and [[adolescence]] at [[school]], Freire ended up four [[Educational stage|grade]]s behind, and his social life revolved around playing [[Pick-up game|pick-up]] [[football]] with other poor children, from whom he states to have learned a great deal. These experiences would shape his concerns for the poor and would help to construct his particular educational viewpoint. Freire stated that [[poverty]] and [[hunger]] severely affected his ability to [[learn]]. These experiences influenced his decision to dedicate his life to improving the lives of the poor: "I didn't understand anything because of my hunger. I wasn't dumb. It wasn't lack of interest. My social condition didn't allow me to have an education. Experience showed me once again the relationship between social class and knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Stevens&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, his family's misfortunes turned around and their prospects improved.

Freire enrolled in [[law school]] at the [[Federal University of Pernambuco|University of Recife]] in 1943. He also studied philosophy, more specifically [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and the [[psychology of language]]. Although admitted to the legal bar, he never practiced law and instead worked as a [[secondary school]] [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] [[teacher]]. In 1944, he [[marriage|married]] Elza Maia Costa de Oliveira, a fellow teacher. The two worked together and had five children.

In 1946, Freire was appointed director of the [[Pernambuco]] Department of Education and Culture. Working primarily among the illiterate poor, Freire began to develop an educational [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] that would have an influence on the [[liberation theology]] movement of the 1970s.

In 1961, he was appointed director of the Department of Cultural Extension at the [[Federal University of Pernambuco|University of Recife]]. In 1962, he had the first opportunity for large-scale application of his theories, when, in an experiment, 300 [[sugarcane]] harvesters were taught to read and write in just 45 days. In response to this experiment, the [[Brazilian government]] approved the creation of thousands of cultural circles{{clarify|date=February 2017}} across the country.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état]] put an end to Freire's literacy effort, as the ruling military junta did not endorse it. Freire was subsequently imprisoned as a [[traitor]] for 70 days. After a brief exile in [[Bolivia]], Freire worked in [[Chile]] for five years for the [[Christian Democratic Agrarian Reform Movement]] and the [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]. In 1967, Freire published his first book, ''Education as the Practice of Freedom''. He followed it with his most famous work, ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]'', first published in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pedagogy of the Oppressed|last=Freire|first=Paulo|publisher=The Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1993|isbn=0826412769|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a positive international reception of his work, Freire was offered a [[visiting professorship]] at [[Harvard University]] in 1969. The next year, ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed'' was published in Spanish and English, vastly expanding its reach. Because of political feuds between Freire, a [[Christian socialist]], and Brazil's successive [[right-wing]] [[authoritarian]] [[military junta|military governments]], the book went unpublished in Brazil until 1974, when, starting with the presidency of [[Ernesto Geisel]], the military junta started a process of slow and controlled political [[liberalisation]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Following a year in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], Freire moved to [[Geneva]] to work as a special education [[advisor]] to the [[World Council of Churches]]. During this time Freire acted as an advisor on education reform in several former [[Portuguese colonies]] in [[Africa]], particularly [[Guinea-Bissau]] and [[Mozambique]].

In 1979, he first visited Brazil after more than a decade of [[exile]], eventually moving back in 1980. Freire joined the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] (PT) in [[São Paulo]] and acted as a supervisor for its [[adult literacy]] project from 1980 to 1986. When the Workers' Party won the [[São Paulo mayoral election, 1988|1988 São Paulo mayoral elections]] in 1988, Freire was appointed municipal [[Secretary of Education]].

Freire died of [[heart failure]] on May 2, 1997 in São Paulo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/06/world/paulo-freire-75-is-dead-educator-of-the-poor-in-brazil.html|title=Paulo Freire, 75, Is Dead; Educator of the Poor in Brazil|last=Pace|first=Eric|date=1997-05-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pedagogy ==
{{Critical pedagogy}}
{{quote|"There is no such thing as a neutral education process. Education either functions as an instrument which is used to facilitate the integration of generations into the logic of the present system and bring about conformity to it, or it becomes the 'practice of freedom', the means by which men and women deal critically with reality and discover how to participate in the transformation of their world."|Richard Shaull, drawing on Paulo Freire&lt;ref&gt;''Gramsci, Freire, and Adult Education: Possibilities for Transformative Action'', by Peter Mayo, Macmillan, 1999, {{ISBN|1-85649-614-7}}, pg 5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Paulo Freire contributed a philosophy of education which blended classical approaches stemming from [[Plato]]and modern [[Marxist]], [[post-Marxist]] and [[anti-colonialist]] thinkers. His ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]'' (1968) can be read as an extension of, or reply to, [[Frantz Fanon]]'s ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'' (1961), which emphasized the need to provide [[native populations]] with an education which was simultaneously new and modern, rather than traditional, and anti-colonial — not simply an extension of the colonizing culture.

In ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed'', Freire, reprising the [[oppressors–oppressed distinction]], applies the distinction to education, championing that education should allow the oppressed to regain their sense of humanity, in turn overcoming their condition. Nevertheless, he acknowledges that for this to occur, the oppressed individual must play a role in their liberation. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
No pedagogy which is truly liberating can remain distant from the oppressed by treating them as unfortunates and by presenting for their emulation models from among the oppressors. The oppressed must be their own example in the struggle for their redemption.&lt;ref&gt;Freire, P. (1970). ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed''. New York: Continuum. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Likewise, oppressors must be willing to rethink their way of life and to examine their own role in oppression if true liberation is to occur: "those who authentically commit themselves to the people must re-examine themselves constantly".&lt;ref&gt;Freire, P. (1970). ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed''. New York: Continuum. p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Freire believed education could not be divorced from politics; the act of teaching and learning are considered political acts in and of themselves. Freire defined this connection as a main tenet of [[critical pedagogy]]. Teachers and students must be made aware of the politics that surround education. The way students are taught and what they are taught serves a political agenda. Teachers, themselves, have political notions they bring into the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Kincheloe, J.L. (2008). ''Critical Pedagogy Primer'', 2nd Ed. New York: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; Freire believed that "education makes sense because women and men learn that through learning they can make and remake themselves, because women and men are able to take responsibility for themselves as beings capable of knowing—of knowing that they know and knowing that they don't".&lt;ref&gt;Freire, P. (2004). ''Pedagogy of Indignation''. Boulder: Colorado, Paradigm. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Criticism of the "banking model" of education===
{{Main|Banking model of education}}
In terms of pedagogy, Freire is best known for his attack on what he called the "banking" concept of education, in which students are viewed as empty accounts to be filled by teachers. He notes that "it transforms students into receiving objects [and] attempts to control thinking and action, lead[ing] men and women to adjust to the world, inhibit[ing] their creative power."&lt;ref&gt;Freire, 1970a, p.&amp;nbsp;77&lt;/ref&gt; The basic critique was not entirely novel, and paralleled [[Rousseau]]'s conception of children as [[active learner]]s, as opposed to a [[tabula rasa]] view, more akin to the banking model.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} [[John Dewey]] was also strongly critical of the transmission of mere facts as the goal of education. Dewey often described education as a mechanism for [[social change]], stating that "education is a regulation of the process of coming to share in the social consciousness; and that the adjustment of individual activity on the basis of this social consciousness is the only sure method of social reconstruction".&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. (1897). [https://books.google.com/books?id=gZq6NB6R-P8C ''My Pedagogic Creed''] p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Freire's work revived this view and placed it in context with contemporary theories and practices of education, laying the foundation for what would later be termed [[critical pedagogy]].

===Culture of silence===
According to Freire, inequal social relations create a 'culture of silence' that instill a negative, passive and suppressed self-image onto the oppressed, and learners must, then, develop a [[critical consciousness]] in order to recognize that this culture of silence is created to oppress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tx.cpusa.org/school/classics/freire.htm|title=Marxist education:Education by Freire|publisher=Tx.cpusa.org|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A culture of silence can also cause the "dominated individuals [to] lose the means by which to critically respond to the culture that is forced on them by a dominant culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.miami.edu/ep/contemporaryed/Paulo_Freire/paulo_freire.html|title=Paulo Freire|publisher=Education.miami.edu|accessdate=2012-11-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326012648/http://education.miami.edu/ep/contemporaryed/Paulo_Freire/paulo_freire.html|archivedate=2013-03-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He considers social, race and class dynamics to be interlaced into the conventional education system, through which this culture of silence eliminates the "paths of thought that lead to a ''language of critique''."&lt;ref&gt;(Giroux, 2001, p. 80) {{cite web|title=Culture, Power and Transformation in the Work of Paulo Freire by Henry A. Giroux|author=(A Presentation by) John Cortez Fordham University|url=http://faculty.fordham.edu/kpking/classes/uege5102-pres-and-newmedia/Giroux-John-Cortez-Presentation.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and impact==
Since the publication of the [[English language|English]] edition in 1970, ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed'' has had a large impact in [[education]] and [[pedagogy]] worldwide{{cn|date=November 2018}}, especially as a defining work of [[critical pedagogy]]. According to [[Israelis|Israeli]] writer and [[education reform]] theorist [[Sol Stern]], it has "achieved near-iconic status in [[United States|America]]'s teacher-training programs".{{cn|date=November 2018}} Connections have also been made between Freire's non-dualism theory in pedagogy and Eastern philosophical traditions such as the [[Advaita Vedanta]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bharath Sriraman]], "[http://www.math.umt.edu/TMME/Monograph1/ "On the Origins of Social Justice: Darwin, Freire, Marx and Vivekananda"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330190940/http://www.math.umt.edu/TMME/Monograph1/ |date=2012-03-30 }}, ''[[The Mathematics Enthusiast]]'', Monograph 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Freire's major exponents in North America are [[Henry Giroux]], [[Peter McLaren]], [[Donaldo Macedo]], [[Antonia Darder]], [[Joe L. Kincheloe]], [[Carlos Alberto Torres (academic)|Carlos Alberto Torres]], [[Ira Shor]], and [[Shirley R. Steinberg]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} One of McLaren's edited texts, ''Paulo Freire: A Critical Encounter'', expounds upon Freire's impact in the field of [[critical pedagogy]]. McLaren has also provided a comparative study concerning Paulo Freire and [[Argentinian]] [[revolutionary]] icon [[Che Guevara]]. Freire's work influenced the [[radical math]] movement in the United States, which emphasizes social justice issues and critical pedagogy as components of mathematical curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radicalmath.org/|title=Radical Math|website=www.radicalmath.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Africa, Freire's ideas and methods were central to the 1970s [[Black Consciousness Movement]], often associated with [[Steve Biko]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/anne-hope-a-woman-of-substance-in-anti-apartheid-movement-1964986|title=Anne Hope – a woman of substance in anti-apartheid movement - Cape Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://msupress.org/books/book/?id=50-1D0-33FD#.V1KZ8SN97o Liberation and Development: Black Consciousness Community Programs in South Africa], Leslie Anne Hadfield,2016&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the trade union movement in the 1970s and 1980s, and the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mg.co.za/article/2017-08-04-00-art-of-listening-is-at-heart-of-true-democracy Art of listening is at heart of true democracy], Richard Pithouse, ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', 4 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; There is a Paulo Freire Project at the [[University of KwaZulu-Natal]] in [[Pietermaritzburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cae.ukzn.ac.za/PauloFreireProject.aspx|title=Paulo Freire Project|website=cae.ukzn.ac.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the Paulo Freire Institute was established in [[São Paulo]] to extend and elaborate upon his theories of [[popular education]]. The institute has started projects in many countries and is headquartered at the [[UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies]], where it actively maintains the Freire archives. Its director is UCLA [[professor]] [[Carlos Alberto Torres (academic)|Carlos Torres]], the author of several Freirean work, including the 1978 ''A praxis educativa de Paulo Freire''.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In 1999 PAULO, a national training organisation named in honour of Freire, was established in the United Kingdom. This agency was approved by the New Labour Government to represent some 300,000 community-based education practitioners working across the UK. PAULO was given formal responsibility for setting the occupational training standards for people working in this field.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The [[Paulo and Nita Freire Project for International Critical Pedagogy]] was founded at [[McGill University]]. Here [[Joe L. Kincheloe]] and Shirley R. Steinberg worked to create a dialogical forum for critical scholars around the world to promote research and re-create a Freirean pedagogy in a multinational domain. After the death of Kincheloe the project was transformed into a virtual global resource.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In 2012, a group of educators in Western [[Massachusetts]], [[United States]] received permission to name a public school after Freire. The [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]] Paulo Freire Social Justice Charter School opened in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2012/02/28/state-approves-four-new-charter-schools/vJSYRGhkz9rgEBqwaPMyGI/story.html|title=State approves four new charter schools|publisher=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before his death, Freire was working on a book of [[ecopedagogy]], a platform of work carried on by many of the Freire Institutes and Freirean Associations around the world today. It has been influential in helping to develop planetary education projects such as the [[Earth Charter]] as well as countless international grassroots campaigns in the spirit of Freirean popular education generally.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Freirean literacy methods have been adopted throughout the [[developing world]].{{where|date=November 2018}} In the Philippines, Catholic "basal Christian communities" adopted Freire's methods in [[community education]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Papua New Guinea, Freirean literacy methods were used as part of the World Bank funded Southern Highlands Rural Development Program's Literacy Campaign. Freirean approaches also lie at the heart of the "Dragon Dreaming" approach to community programs that have spread to 20 countries by 2014.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

'''''Powerhouse''''' is a video game developed and published by [[Impressions Games|Impressions]] for the [[personal computer|PC]].

==Gameplay==
''Powerhouse'' is a simulation in which the player is the head of a power utility, and has got to develop an electrical infrastructure for a given region before competitors can.&lt;ref name="NG"/&gt;

==Reception==
''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that "Looking at the mind-boggling array of charts and graphs in the game will provide some answers, but when all is said and done, making those decisions is up to you, and that's where the real fun in this economic simulation lies."&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=Finals|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=10|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|date=October 1995|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Project Blogger''' is an educational initiative in [[Ireland]] by [[Discover Science &amp; Engineering]] (DSE). It provides blogging tools and an online space for [[secondary school]] students and their teachers to create blogs about their school [[science]] experiments and science interests.

Through the [[blog]]s, the students can share their experiences about science with their classmates, as well as with students from other schools across [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sligotoday.ie/detail.php?id=3368 Article on Sligo Today]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scheme was piloted in the 2007-08 academic year and was extended the following year.
 
DSE has also teamed up with Scifest for students to use Project Blogger in their SciFest projects. The students use their online science diaries to store ongoing project results, images, ideas, graphs, video and discussions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.ie/EN/index.cfm/section/news/page/newsPage/news_key/756 Article on Science.ie]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Project Exploration''' is a not-for-profit educational program whose goal is to "change the face of science" by encouraging interest in science among students—especially girls and minorities—who traditionally have not found effective career routes into scientific disciplines. Its primary method is to create intensive collaborative relationships between students and working field researchers through structured programs involving the [[University of Chicago]] and other institutions. In January 2010, it received a Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring.&lt;ref name="press1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-honor-teachers-and-mentors-announce-key-partnerships-educate-innova|title=President Obama to Honor Teachers and Mentors, Announce Key Partnerships in "Educate to Innovate" Campaign|date=January 4, 2010 |publisher=The White House, Office of the Press Secretary|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization, founded in 1999, is based in Chicago, Illinois, USA.

==Activities==
Project Exploration currently serves nearly 1,000 students.  It began as an after-school and summer program when Gabrielle Lyon, a teacher at Fiske Elementary School on the [[South Side of Chicago]], decided that students underrepresented in the sciences, primarily girls and minorities, should be given opportunities to collaborate with actual scientists and participate in real-life scientific research. Students design research projects and test them in the field, or work summers at museums demonstrating science to young children.&lt;ref name="Trib"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2009/jul/17/local/chi-president-award-sciencejul17|title=Chicago-based Project Exploration wins a presidential award for science education|last=Mitchum|first=Robert |date=July 17, 2009|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Sisters4Science
Sisters4Science is a year-round after-school and field program that combines science exploration with leadership development for approximately 100 minority middle school girls. Girls participate in hands-on science activities led by women scientists as well as participate in science-based field trips.&lt;ref name="s4s"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectexploration.org/s4s/|title=Sisters4Science|publisher=Project Exploration|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Girls Health and Science Day
Project Exploration organizes a one-day symposium with workshops on the topics of sexuality and tolerance, healthy relationships, self-worth, the female body, and self-defense for female students across Chicago in grades 7-10.&lt;ref name="ghsd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectexploration.org/ghsd|title=Girls Health and Science Day|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* All Girls Expedition
The All Girls Expedition is an intensive two-week classroom and field work experience for twenty girls .  It includes intensive classroom instruction in geology, biology, evaluation, and field skills followed by one week working in the field alongside scientists.&lt;ref name="age"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectexploration.org/age/ |title=All Girls Expedition  |publisher=Project Exploration|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent expedition was to [[Yellowstone National Park]] in Wyoming, to conduct fieldwork on the water chemistry of geysers, track [[coyotes]] and explore a cave with Project Exploration and Yellowstone researchers.&lt;ref name="UofChi1"/&gt;

* The Science Teacher Field Institute
The Science Teacher Field Institute is an annual three-week professional development program for Chicago Public School teachers  which includes both classroom and field experience with scientists in the disciplines of geology, paleontology, and [[astronomy]].  All costs are covered by private donations.&lt;ref name="stfi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectexploration.org/stfi/|title=The Science Teacher Field Institute |publisher=Project Exploration|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This program includes field work at eastern [[Montana]]'s Lost-in-Time Ranch under supervision of professional paleontologists from the University of Chicago and Project co-founder Gabrielle Lyon.&lt;ref name="UofChi1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.uchicago.edu/news.php?asset_id=1644|title=Project Exploration offers mammoth-scale summer learning experience|date=25 June 2009|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidential Award==
The Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring, awarded each year to individuals or organizations, recognizes the crucial role that mentoring plays in the academic and personal development of students studying science or engineering and who belong to minorities that are underrepresented in those fields. By offering their time, encouragement and expertise to these students, mentors help ensure that the next generation of scientists and engineers will better reflect the diversity of the United States.
Candidates for the Presidential Mentoring Award are nominated by colleagues, administrators, and students from their home institutions.  The mentoring can involve students at any grade level from elementary through graduate school. In addition to being honored at the [[White House]], recipients receive awards of $10,000 to advance their mentoring efforts. "There is no higher calling than furthering the educational advancement of our nation’s young people and encouraging and inspiring our next generation of leaders," [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] said. "These awards represent a heartfelt salute of appreciation to a remarkable group of individuals who have devoted their lives and careers to helping others and in doing so have helped us all."&lt;ref name="whitehouse2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Honors-Outstanding-Science-Math-Engineering-Teachers-And-Mentors/|title=President Honors Outstanding Science Math Engineering Teachers And Mentors/|date=9 July 2009|publisher=The White House, Office of the Press Secretary|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award to Project Exploration was announced in July 2009.&lt;ref name="Trib" /&gt; The award ceremony took place in January 2010 at the White House.

'''Radical transparency''' is a phrase used across fields of governance, politics, software design and business to describe actions and approaches that radically increase the [[openness]] of organizational process and data. Its usage was originally understood as an approach or act that uses abundant networked information to access previously confidential organizational process or outcome data.&lt;ref name="Hammond"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hammond |first=Allen |url= http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/56853/allen-l-hammond/digitally-empowered-development |title=Digitally Empowered Development |publisher=Foreign Affairs |date=March–April 2001 |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sifry"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Sifry| first=Micah| year=2011| title=WikiLeaks and the Age of Transparency| publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300176766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and uses==

Modern usage of the term radical transparency coincided with increased public use of [[Information communications technologies]] including the [[Internet]]. [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] argued in 1994 that, “in the network era, openness wins, central control is lost.”&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Kelly| first=Kevin| year=1994| title=Out of control : the rise of neo-biological civilization| publisher=Addison-Wesley| isbn= 9780201577938}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.116}} [[David Brin]]'s writing on ''[[The Transparent Society]]'' re-imagined the societal consequences of radical transparency remixing [[George Orwell|Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]''. However, the explicit political argument for “radical transparency”&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt; was first made in a 2001 [[Foreign Affairs]] article on information and communication technology driving economic growth in developing regions. In 2006 [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]’s Chris Anderson blogged on the shift from secrecy to transparency blogging culture had made on corporate communications, and highlighted the next step as a shift to ‘radical transparency’ where the “whole product development process [is] laid bare, and opened to customer input.”&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite web |last=Anderson |first=Chris |url= http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/11/in_praise_of_ra.html |title=The LongTale: In Praise of Radical Transparency |date=November 26, 2006 |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008 the term was being used to describe the [[WikiLeaks]] platform that radically decentralized the power, voices and visibility of governance knowledge that was previously secret.&lt;ref name="Heemsbergen"&gt;{{Citation| last=Heemsbergen| first=Luke| year=2008| title=Radical Pockets of Digital Democracy: Deleuzian Grandeur?| publisher=Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association, August 28–31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.58}}

==Contexts==

=== Radical corporate transparency===

Radical corporate transparency, as a philosophical concept, would involve removing all barriers to free and easy public access to corporate, political and personal (treating persons as corporations) information and the development of laws, rules, social [[connivance]] and processes that facilitate and protect such an outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bernardi |first=Richard A. |last2=LaCross |first2=Catherine C. |url=http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2005/405/essentials/p34.htm |title=Corporate Transparency: Code of Ethics Disclosures |publisher=The CPA Journal |date=April 2005 |accessdate=December 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using these methods to 'hold corporations accountable for the benefit of everyone' was emphasised in Tapscott and Ticoll's book "The Naked Corporation"&lt;ref&gt;Tapscott, D., &amp; Ticoll, D. (2003). The naked corporation: How the age of transparency will revolutionize business. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2003. Radical transparency has also been explained by Dan Goleman as a [[management]] approach where (ideally,) all decision making is carried out publicly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danielgoleman.info/topics/ecological-intelligence/ Ecological Intelligence]&lt;/ref&gt; Specific to this approach is the potential for new technologies to reveal the eco-impact of products bought to steer consumers to make informed decisions and companies to reform their business practices.

In traditional [[public relations]] management, [[damage control (news)|damage control]] involved the suppression of public information. But, as observed by [[Clive Thompson (journalist)|Clive Thompson]] in  ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', the [[Internet]] has created a force towards transparency:
"[H]ere's the interesting paradox: The reputation economy creates an incentive to be more open, not less. Since Internet commentary is inescapable, the only way to influence it is to be part of it. Being transparent, opening up, posting interesting material frequently and often is the only way to amass positive links to yourself and thus to directly influence your Googleable reputation. Putting out more evasion or PR puffery won't work, because people will either ignore it and not link to it – or worse, pick the spin apart and enshrine ''those'' criticisms high on your Google list of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Clive |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.04/wired40_ceo.html |title=The See-Through CEO |publisher=Wired |date=March 2007 |accessdate=December 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Zuckerberg]] has opined that "more transparency should make for a more tolerant society in which people eventually accept that everybody sometimes does bad or embarrassing things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gould |first=Emily |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/06/12/faith-in-facebook.html |title=Faith in Facebook |publisher=Newsweek |date=June 12, 2010 |accessdate=December 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radical political transparency===
A partial form of radical transparency was instituted into parliaments of the [[Westminster system]], through full records of discussions in parliament, recorded and published in what is referred to as ''[[Hansard]]'', while the texts of proposed laws and final laws are all, in principle, public documents.

Since the late 1990s, many national parliaments decided to publish all parliamentary debates and laws on the Internet. However, the initial texts of proposed laws and the discussions and negotiations regarding them generally occur in parliamentary commissions, which are rarely transparent, and among [[political party|political parties]], which are very rarely transparent. Moreover, given the logical and linguistic complexity of typical national laws, public [[participation (decision making)|participation]] is difficult despite the radical transparency at the formal parliamentary level.

Radical transparency has also been suggested in the context of government finance and public economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidbrin.com/radicaltransparency.html|title=Radical Transparency|author=David Brin|accessdate=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radical educational transparency ===
A radically transparent approach is also emerging within education. Open Educational Resources (OER) are freely accessible, usually [[open license|openly licensed]] documents and media that are useful for teaching, learning, educational, assessment and research purposes. Although some people consider the use of an [[open format]] to be an essential characteristic of OER, this is not a universally acknowledged requirement. In addition online courses activities are also becoming increasingly more accessible for others.&lt;ref&gt;Baltzersen, R. K. (2010). [http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/ajet26/baltzersen.html Radical transparency: Open access as a key concept in wiki pedagogy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215062212/http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/ajet26/baltzersen.html |date=2013-02-15 }}. ''Australasian Journal of Educational Technology'', 26(6), p.791-809. Retrieved May 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; One example are the new and popular [[massive open online courses]] (MOOC).

'''Robert Vincent ("Bob") Hogg''' (8 November 1924 – 23 December 2014)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press-citizen.com/story/news/local/2014/12/24/robert-hogg/20876423/ Colleagues, family remember a statistical giant]&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States|American]] [[statistician]] and professor of statistics of the [[University of Iowa]]. Hogg is known for his widely used textbooks on [[statistics]] (with his 1963 Ph.D. student Elliot Alan Tanis) and on [[mathematical statistics]] (with his 1950 Ph.D. advisor Allen Thornton Craig). Hogg has received recognition for his research on
[[robust statistics|robust]] and [[sequential analysis|adaptive]] [[nonparametric statistics]] and for his [[scholarship]] on [[total quality management]] and [[statistics education]].&lt;ref name="Randles2007"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Statistical Science|year=2007|volume=22|issue=1|pages=137–152 | doi=10.1214/088342306000000637 | title=A Conversation with Robert V.

==Academic career==

===Early life===
Born on 8 November 1924 in [[Hannibal, Missouri]], Hogg served three years in the [[US Navy]] from 1943 through 1946. In 1947, he graduated from the [[University of Illinois]] with a bachelor's degree in mathematics. With the goal of becoming an [[actuary]], Hogg matriculated at the mathematics department of the [[University of Iowa]] (then the "[[State University of Iowa]]").&lt;ref name="Pages"&gt;Pages 137–139 in Randles.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hogg studied statistics under Allen Craig, who became his mentor and helped him obtain a job teaching statistics at the Mathematics Department. Hogg earned his Ph.D. 1950 under Allen Craig. After graduating, Hogg remained at the Mathematics Department, where he remained to become a long-serving professor.&lt;ref name="Pages" /&gt;

===Basu's theorem: Special cases===
Hogg independently discovered a special case of "[[Basu's theorem]]", a few years [[Stigler's law of eponymy|before]] the publication by [[Deb Basu]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Basu's theorem]] appears in {{cite journal |last=Basu |first=D. |authorlink=Debabrata Basu |title=On Statistics Independent of a Complete Sufficient Statistic |journal= [[Sankhya (journal)|Sankhyā]] |volume=15 |issue=4 |year=1955 |pages=377–380 |mr=74745 | zbl = 0068.13401 | jstor = 25048259 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-5825-9_14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/2685927 |last=Boos |first=Dennis D.|author2=Oliver, Jacqueline M.

(Later, in his interview with Randles, Hogg speculates that the anonymous referee was [[Erich Leo Lehmann]].)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Basu refers "to Hogg and Craig (1956) for several interesting uses [of [[Basu's theorem]]] in proving results in distribution theory".&lt;ref&gt;Page 348 in ''Statistical Information and Likelihood : A Collection of Critical Essays by Dr. D. Basu'' ; [[Jayanta Kumar Ghosh|J. K. Ghosh]], editor. Springer 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaboration and friendship with Allen Craig===
The textbook "Hogg and Craig" was innovative, particularly in emphasizing [[sufficient statistic]]s: Sufficient statistics were treated not only for [[exponential family|parametric families]] but also for nonparametric probability distributions: In particular, the sufficiency and [[completeness (statistics)|completeness]] of the [[order statistics]] from a [[absolute continuity|continuous]] [[probability distribution|distribution]] were treated.  Another innovation was the systematic derivation of the distributions of functions of several random variables by using the [[Change of variable#Application in probability|change-of-variable]] method.&lt;ref&gt;Page 2468 in Randles and Calvin. (Pages 139–140 in Randles.)&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted before, Craig was Hogg's mentor, helping him to obtain a teaching position while a graduate student and also supervising his thesis. Later, after Hogg had graduated, Craig became a close friend, and served as the [[best man]] at Hogg's wedding and later as the "[[godparent]]" &lt;!-- gender-neutral "godparent" in the original description by Hogg in Randles --&gt; to each of Hogg's four children. Indeed, Hogg's son Allen was [[namesake|named]] after Craig.&lt;ref&gt;Page 141 in Randles, which mentions only two children. Page 149 mentions four children.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chairing a new Department of Statistics===
In 1965 Hogg became the founding chair of the new Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, and he remained as the chair for nineteen years. At Iowa, Hogg held other positions, including Chair of the Quality Management and Productivity Program and the Hanson Chair of Manufacturing Productivity. After serving 51 years as an instructor at the University of Iowa, Hogg became Professor Emeritus in 2001.&lt;ref name="Randles2007" /&gt;

==Statistics education==
Hogg has been a leader in [[statistics education]] in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Randles and Calvin, page 2468. Randles declares that Hogg is a leader in [[statistics education]] on page 144 of Randles.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogg has received a number of educational awards by state and national organizations: these awards include the Iowa Governor’s Science Medal for Teaching in 1990, the [[Board of Regents, State of Iowa|Iowa Board of Regents']] Award for Faculty Excellence in 1992, and the Iowa Section of the [[Mathematical Association of America]] (MAA)'s Distinguished Teaching Award in 1992 with the national MAA's Distinguished Teaching Award in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Randles and Calvin report that the MAA award was in 1992 (Page 2468). (Randles reports the MAA prize in 1993 on page 146.)&lt;/ref&gt; At the University of Iowa, Hogg won his first teaching award after a student submitted a nomination with the title "There is a hog in my statistics book!".&lt;ref&gt;Hogg quoted on page 146 in Randles.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
Hogg's 70th birthday was marked by a conference organized by the [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]], whose proceedings were published as a [[festschrift|special issue]] of ''Communications in Statistics&amp;nbsp;— Theory and Methods'' in 1996; in the conference proceedings, a list of Hogg's publications appears on pages 2467–2481.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1080/03610929608831849 | editor=James A.

For his research in [[nonparametric statistics]], Hogg received the [[Gottfried E. Noether|Gottfried Noether]] Senior Scholar Award in 2001.

Hogg has been recognized internationally as a leading researcher in statistics and as an exemplary professor of statistics who has served as a public spokesperson for the profession. Hogg has had a particularly visible role in the United States, where he was elected as President of the [[American Statistical Association]] (ASA), serving in 1988. One of the ASA President's tasks is to arrange an annual meeting, and Hogg's diligence was rewarded by the ASA staff, who presented him with the name tag, "[[Boss Hogg]]" (after the name of a character in the television series ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Page 147 in Randles.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years after Hogg had served as President, he was awarded the ASA’s Founder’s Award in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Page 146 in Randles.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Hogg had previously been elected as a fellow of the American Statistical Association. --&gt;

Hogg has also been internationally active on behalf of the statistics profession. Hogg is a Fellow of the [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]], which awarded him its [[Harry C. Carver|Carver]] Medal.&lt;ref&gt;Page 151 in Randles.&lt;/ref&gt; Hogg is also an Elected Member of the [[International Statistical Institute]].&lt;ref name="Randles2007" /&gt;

The '''School Prayer Amendment''' is a [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|proposed amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]] intended by its proponents to protect the right of the students if they wish, to voluntarily pray in schools, although opponents argue it allows for government sponsored prayer.

==Background==
In the cases ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'' (1962) and ''[[Abington School District v. Schempp]]'' (1963), the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that [[government mandated school prayer]] is unconstitutional under the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. However voluntary prayer is not unconstitutional.

The history of school prayer amendment began in 1962 with the Supreme Court case of Engel v. Vitale. A New York policy required schools to begin each day with a word of prayer. Regarding this case, Justice Hugo Black wrote "… the constitutional prohibition against laws respecting an establishment of religion must at least mean that in this country it is no part of the business of government to compose official prayers for any group of the American people to recite as a part of a religious program carried on by government."

The next year, a similar case arose: Abington Township School District v. Schempp. The effect of this incident was the prohibition of school officials from organizing or leading prayers as well as devotional Bible reading in public schools. Abington v. Schempp required that school faculties should neither promote nor degrade religion. The Supreme Court next examined school prayer in 1985 with the case of [[Wallace v. Jaffree]]. A change to Alabama's moment-of-silence law included a requirement that the moment of silence must be for "meditation or voluntary prayer." The Court saw the change as government promotion of prayer in the schools, and overturned the change to the law. The justices explained that a moment of silence is appropriate, but not for any religious purpose.

==History==
[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Robert Byrd]] of [[West Virginia]] proposed the amendment in 1962, 1973, 1979, 1982, 1993, 1995, and 1997.&lt;ref name="Byrd 2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=16832|title=Sen.

''[[The New York Times]]'' reported in July 1999 that the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], at that time occupied by a Republican majority, had long been proposing such an amendment but was preoccupied with a competing, more general amendment allowing for "religious freedoms" proposed by [[Henry Hyde]], then-Chairman of the [[House Judiciary Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE0D61E39F935A25754C0A960958260|title=Republicans in Congress Renew Push for Vote on School Prayer Amendment |last=Seelye|first=Katharine Q.|date=1996-07-16|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representative [[Ernest Istook]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from [[Oklahoma's 5th congressional district]], proposed the amendment on May 8, 1997.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d105:HJ00078:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp;&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1998, the Judiciary Committee passed the bill by a 16-11 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/04/20/time/pols.schoolprayer.html|title=Spiriting Prayer Into School|last=Van Biema|first=David|date=1998-04-27|work=Time|accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 4, 1998, the full House voted on the amendment, 224-203 in favor.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt; The vote was 61 short of the two-thirds majority required by [[Article Five of the United States Constitution]] to propose a constitutional amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03EED61F3BF934A35755C0A96E958260|title=Votes in Congress |date=1998-06-07|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Istook reintroduced the amendment to Congress twice: first in 1999 as the House Joint Resolution 66&lt;ref&gt;http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c106:H.J.RES.66.IH:&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2001 as the "Religious Speech Amendment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.au.org/site/News2?abbr=pr&amp;page=NewsArticle&amp;id=6009 |title=Rep.

Though the proposed amendment failed to be adopted, it led to the passing of the [[Equal Access Act]].

{{corporal punishment}}
The '''tawse''', sometimes formerly spelled '''taws''' (the plural of [[Scots language|Scots]] '''taw''', a thong of a whip) is an implement used for [[corporal punishment]]. It was used for [[School corporal punishment|educational discipline]], primarily in [[Scotland]], but also in schools in the English cities of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Gateshead]], [[Manchester]] and [[Walsall]].

A tawse consists of a strip of [[leather]], with one end split into a number of tails. The thickness of the leather and the number of tails is variable. Many Scottish saddlers made tawses for local schoolmasters. The official name "tawse" was hardly ever used in conversation by either teachers or pupils, who instead referred to it as either '''the school strap''' or '''the belt''', the normal term for an unforked implement, as worn in trousers (see [[Belt (clothing)|belt]]).

[[State school#Scotland|Scottish public (state) schools]] used the tawse to punish pupils of either sex on the palm of the outstretched hand. Pupils were usually instructed to hold out one hand, palm uppermost, supported by the other hand below, which made it difficult to move the hand away during the infliction of the strokes. It also ensured that the full force of each stroke was taken by the hand being strapped. The punishment was usually inflicted by the class teacher in front of the entire class, to act as a deterrent to others; sometimes by a designated teacher, such as the Deputy Headmaster, to whom the pupil was sent.

In Walsall and Gateshead, and in some schools in Manchester and [[Nottingham]], male students were tawsed on the [[buttocks|seat of the trousers]].

Some [[Independent school#Scotland|Scottish private (independent) schools]] also used the tawse, such as [[Keil School]], but others such as [[Fettes College]] used the cane instead, as did most schools in England outside the north-east.

In 1982 two Scottish mothers went to the [[European Court of Human Rights]], who passed a judgment that parents had the right to refuse corporal punishment of a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uLdAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yaUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2319%2C4771823 |title=Victor in belt case set to sue |first=John |last=Linklater |work=The Glasgow Herald |date=26 February 1982 |page=1 |accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This judgement led indirectly to the use of the tawse (and all other forms of corporal punishment) being banned by law in UK state schools. The legislation came into force in 1987, but most Scottish local education authorities had already abolished it by the early 1980s.

John J. Dick Leather Goods was a manufacturer in [[Lochgelly]] estimated to have made around 70% of tawses when they were used in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-39044445 |title=How the tawse left its mark on Scottish pupils |work=BBC News |date=22 February 2017 |accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04qz9s8 |title=Making the Lochgelly Tawse |work=BBC |date=20 February 2017 |accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Original tawses sold for around £6 in 1982 but twenty years later some collectors were paying hundred of pounds each for rare items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.scotsman.com/news/cash-strapped-teachers-offer-shy-collectors-six-of-the-best-1-1378698 |title=Cash-strapped teachers offer shy collectors six of the best |work=The Scotsman |location= Edinburgh |date=25 August 2002 |accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tawse was also used for [[judicial corporal punishment]] in Scotland as an alternative to the more usual birch. Courts could sentence boys of over 14 but under 16 to up to 36 strokes with an extra-heavy tawse for any offence. This was administered to the offender's bare buttocks. Judicial corporal punishment was abolished in 1948.

upgraded to a college level,following its
achievements in education, becoming
the first privately owned college in
Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.addistribune.com/Archives/2001/12/28-12-01/Unity.htm|title=Unity College Graduates Students|date=28 December 2001|work=Addis Tribune|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209140131/http://www.addistribune.com/Archives/2001/12/28-12-01/Unity.htm|archivedate=9 February 2008|dead-url=yes|accessdate=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through
the years, the institute has played a
pioneering role in providing quality
education, setting a fine record. Later
named Unity College, the institute has
promoted innovative approaches and
launched degree programs in various

'''The University of West Alabama''' (abbreviated as '''UWA''') is a public university located in [[Livingston, Alabama]], United States.

Founded in 1835, the school began as a church-supported school for young women called '''Livingston Female Academy'''.  The original Board of Trustees of Livingston Female Academy was selected in 1836, and four of the seven board members were [[Presbyterian]]s.

The university serves students in several academic colleges and divisions on a {{convert|600|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus in west-central Alabama.  UWA offers a wide arrangement of degree programs including associate, bachelor's, master's,educational specialist, and educational doctorate degrees.&lt;ref name="Academic Programs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uwa.edu/admissions/undergraduate/academics|title=Academic Programs|publisher=The University of West Alabama|accessdate=February 6, 2010}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The university hosts concerts, lectures, fall and spring theatrical productions, fall and spring commencement exercises, and intercollegiate athletic events.

Its athletics teams, known as the [[West Alabama Tigers]], are members of the [[Gulf South Conference]] and compete in the [[NCAA]]'s [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] in all sports except two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulfsouthconference.org/about.asp?page=schools|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207122751/http://www.gulfsouthconference.org/about.asp?page=schools|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 7, 2007|title=Gulf South Conference-About the Gulf South Conference|publisher=Gulf South Conference|date=January 1, 2007|accessdate=February 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The men's and women's rodeo teams compete in the Ozark Region of the [[National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegerodeo.com/membership/RegionInfo.asp?Region=OZ|title=NIRA-Membership for Ozark Region|publisher=National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association|date=January 1, 2007|accessdate=February 7, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729072432/http://www.collegerodeo.com/membership/RegionInfo.asp?Region=OZ|archivedate=July 29, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early history ===
The University of West Alabama began as '''Livingston Female Academy''' in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Az4dAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dqYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3520,4334527&amp;dq=livingston+female+academy&amp;hl=en|title=College, small-town life intersect in Livingston|date=March 24, 2002|work=Tuscaloosa News|page=1B|accessdate=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a church-related female academy, it admitted its first students in 1839.  The school was established by [[ethnic]] [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] Presbyterians, who controlled the majority of seats on the first board of trustees selected in 1836.  The purpose of the school was to educate future teachers, while also offering course work in art, music, languages, and home economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C6AWAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=livingston+female+academy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WnGY6uMiSm&amp;sig=A2FVm3w98WgaPBIzxNN-Y2laVIo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cZSVS47VMqCQmAeo5PyaCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CAwQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=livingston%20female%20academy&amp;f=false|title=History of Higher Education of Women in the South|last=Blandin|first=I.M.E|year=1909|work=The Neale Publishing Company|pages=100–101|accessdate=March 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tuition at this time was $20 annually with an additional $25 charged for piano lessons and $10 for French language and [[embroidery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aBkfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=C5wEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4975,2299182&amp;dq=livingston+female+academy&amp;hl=en|title=1847 college ad proves passage of time makes remarkable change in living costs|date=December 11, 1969|work=Tuscaloosa News|page=30|accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones Hall was the first building constructed on the campus in 1837, and was located near what is now Brock Hall.  (The building was lost to fire in the 1890s). On January 15, 1840, state lawmakers incorporated Livingston Female Academy, granted it tax-exempt status, and gave the board the authority to establish rules and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://meridianstar.com/editorials/x681144390/Sumter-County-Alabama-Our-neighbors-to-the-East|title=Sumter County Alabama–Our Neighbors to the East|last=McKee|first=Anne|date=December 11, 2008|work=Meridian Star|accessdate=March 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Livingston Female Academy awarded its first diploma in 1843 to Elizabeth Houston, the daughter of M. L. Houston, a prominent local businessman and a school trustee. The first principal of the school was A. A. Kimbrell, followed by Margaret McShan. In 1853, Dr. Robert Dickens Webb arrived in Sumter County and served as a trustee for more than 40 years. He led the school during the [[American Civil War]] and Reconstruction through the 1870s, helping to keep the institution open. The main administration building that sits in the middle of campus today is named in his honor. In 1878, the institution changed its name to '''Livingston Normal College'''.

Education reformer [[Julia Tutwiler|Julia Strudwick Tutwiler]] joined the faculty in 1881 as co-principal with her uncle, [[Carlos Green Smith]], former president of the [[University of Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ffXf-VnSlTsC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=livingston+female+academy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jH--ek2wuf&amp;sig=KpaoEX9t3tqLpqKFG5PwwMK03V0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TZiVS5z3NNCEmQex_6yPBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CBEQ6AEwBTg8#v=onepage&amp;q=livingston%20female%20academy&amp;f=false |title=Stories of the Haunted South|last=Brown|first=Alan|year=2004|work=University Press of Mississippi|page=11|accessdate=March 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882–1883, state lawmakers provided $2,500 for tuition and supplies; Alabama was the first southern state to fund the education of women. Tutwiler and state legislator Addison Gillespie Smith helped secure this appropriation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlcdAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=livingston+female+academy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hn9e6cTSjl&amp;sig=IMUq0BgIx0lAbL7qSDeZIdd0cC4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BgiXS4maGtKW8AbY6JwM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=livingston%20female%20academy&amp;f=false|title=Public School Laws of the State of Alabama|last=Turner|first=John|year=1895|work=Roemer Printing Company|pages=70–74|accessdate=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, the school was renamed the Alabama Normal College for Girls and Livingston Female Academy, to better reflect the new mission of the institution, providing students with choices of either two- or four-year programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20100227/NEWS02/2270332/1009/Reed-organ-represents-heritage-of-University-of-West-Alabama|title=Reed organ represents heritage of University of West Alabama|last=Rupinski|first=Patrick|date=February 27, 2010|work=Montgomery Advertiser|accessdate=March 10, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Normal training" was the term used at that time to describe teacher education that represented high school plus two years of college education. The Normal College presented its first diplomas at the 1886 [[commencement speech|commencement]] exercises.

In 1890, Tutwiler was named president of the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HjAdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1p4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3257,7307276&amp;dq=livingston+normal+college+julia+tutwiler&amp;hl=en|title=Woman heads college|date=November 28, 1979|work=Tuscaloosa News|page=3|accessdate=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the only woman to have been president. During her tenure, Tutwiler aided in establishing the Alabama Girls' Industrial Institute (now the [[University of Montevallo]]) and in having the first women admitted to the [[University of Alabama]] in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&amp;dat=19760920&amp;id=2xgfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8J0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5858,5137571|title=Livingston, Alabama; a city with a rich heritage and a bright future|date=September 20, 1976|work=Tuscaloosa News|page=7|accessdate=March 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century new leadership brought a new name to the college as well. George William Brock was hired by the trustees in 1907 to oversee the institution's financial affairs. Following Tutwiler's retirement in 1910, Brock assumed the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1112|title=Julia S. Tutwiler|work=Encyclopedia of Alabama|accessdate=March 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alumni began meeting in honor of Tutwiler in 1910 and formed the first alumni association. Men were admitted to the institution as regular students in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bGEeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=msgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2485,5379976&amp;dq=livingston+female+academy&amp;hl=en|title=Livingston's 150th|date=March 21, 1986|work=Times Daily|page=12A|accessdate=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foust Hall was built in 1922 as a lab school where college professors taught, and students observed and participated in classroom instruction.  The building's open-air plan with a central courtyard became a building design familiar to many Alabamians. In 1928, both Bibb Graves Hall and Brock Hall were added to the physical plant under this plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-2358|title=A History of Livingston University, 1835–1963|last=Lyon|first=Ralph M|year=1976|publisher=Encyclopedia of Alabama|accessdate=February 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AlamucheeCB.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Alamuchee-Bellamy Covered Bridge]] on campus]]
In 1929, the Alabama State Board of Education took over supervision and renamed the facility the '''Livingston State Teachers College'''. Under George William Brock, in 1929 the school founded a student newspaper called ''Campus Lights'' (now called ''The Muse'').

A football team was added in 1931. With striped uniforms, the college took the tiger as its mascot, and the sports teams continue to be known as the [[West Alabama Tigers|UWA Tigers]]; red and white are the school colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uwa.edu/Media/Website%20Resources/thelife/2010/March%203.pdf|title=We are the Tigers|date=March 3, 2010|work=The Life|pages=1–2|accessdate=March 23, 2010}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; After president Brock retired in 1936, Noble Franklin Greenhill took over and served until 1944. Under Greenhill, campus life flourished as social sororities and intercollegiate sports in baseball, basketball, and football were added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AOohAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0ZkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5329,3758198&amp;dq=livingston+state+teachers+college&amp;hl=en|title=Livingston State sororities have rush week activities|date=October 2, 1955|work=Tuscaloosa News|page=21|accessdate=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[homecoming]] celebration was held in 1939.

World War II brought such a decline in enrollment that the college nearly closed.  When William Wilson Hill assumed the presidency in 1944 after Greenhill left, he commissioned studies to determine if the institution should continue as a four-year college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LgwsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KLoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4430,1927988&amp;dq=livingston+state+teachers+college&amp;hl=en|title=State teachers’ college at Livingston is studied|date=August 29, 1944|work=Times Daily|pages=2–3|accessdate=March 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill began with only 92 students, so he set out to recruit [[veterans]].  With more men on campus, the interest in sports was revived, and servicemen were aided financially in going to college by the [[GI Bill]], which increased the educational level of a generation of men. [[Tiger Stadium (West Alabama)|Tiger Stadium]] was built in 1952. The first campus fraternities were established during Wilson's presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=c2QeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7JkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7370,5323634&amp;dq=livingston+state+teachers+college&amp;hl=en|title=Plans, projects, happenings at Livingston State College|date=October 14, 1956|work=Tuscaloosa News|page=24|accessdate=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college gained a reputation for teacher education in the region and state through the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QIkfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=85kEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7198,3431127&amp;dq=livingston+state+teachers+college&amp;hl=en|title=Livingston State College classrooms filled to capacity|last=Ennis|first=Richard|date=September 27, 1959|work=Tuscaloosa News|page=27|accessdate=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the institution was broadened in 1957 when, under the leadership of Delos Culp (1954–1963), the school's name was changed to '''Livingston State College'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TPkcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AZoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3836,3839209&amp;dq=livingston+state+college&amp;hl=en|title=Livingston State enrollment near all-time high with 600|last=Watkins|first=Ed|date=October 30, 1957|work=Tuscaloosa News|page=6|accessdate=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduate-level classes were added, and the state board of education began awarding master's degrees in professional education under a new graduate division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7ewhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=45kEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6263,6091730&amp;dq=livingston+state+teachers+college&amp;hl=en|title=Summer quarter classes begin at Livingston State College|date=June 16, 1957|work=Tuscaloosa News|page=8|accessdate=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly Hester Land was awarded the first master's degree, and a writing scholarship competition and building are named for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kxQfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5p0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3910,6466302&amp;dq=livingston+state+teachers+college&amp;hl=en|title=For 3 LU retirees, ninety years service|date=May 30, 1976|work=Tuscaloosa News|page=3A|accessdate=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under John E.

In 1973, Asa N. Green (1973–1994) became president; he oversaw the establishment of the Ira D.

Students who receive a Trustee Scholarship from the University or participate in certain activities such as varsity-level athletics may be required to live on campus.  Three buildings make up the traditional residence halls on the University campus.  These are Spieth Hall, Selden Hall and Sisk Hall.  Most students who attend the University reside in these residence halls.  Three buildings make up the residential scholar communities on the University campus.

A '''Vocational Education Committee''' ('''VEC''') ({{lang-ga|Coiste Gairmoideachais}}) was a [[statute|statutory]] local education body in the [[Republic of Ireland]] that administered some secondary education, most adult education and a very small amount of primary education in the state. Before 1992 VECs had authority over the [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] and the [[Regional Technical College]]s. They existed from 1930 to 2013, when they were replaced by [[Education and Training Board]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Education and Training Boards replace VECs to save €2m a year|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/education-and-training-boards-replace-vecs-to-save-2m-a-year-599013.html|accessdate=2 July 2013|newspaper=[[Irish Examiner]]|date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment==
VECs were originally created by the Vocational Education Act 1930, as successors to the Technical Instruction Committees established by the Agriculture and Technical Instruction (Ireland) Act 1899. The original purpose of the committees was to administer continuation and technical education for 14- to 16-year-olds. Continuation education was defined as ''"general and practical training in preparation for employment in trades"'', while technical education was described as ''"pertaining to trades, manufacturers, commerce and other industrial pursuits"''. To this end the VECs were charged with the duty of setting up and maintaining [[vocational school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1930_29.html Vocational Education Act, 1930, accessed 20 October 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duties==
Over time the duties of VECs increased, in particular in the area of adult education. These included:

''Post-primary (secondary) education''
*Vocational Schools
*Community Colleges

''Further and adult education''
*Post-Leaving Certificate courses (PLCs)
*Youthreach Services
*Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS)
*Community Education&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corkvec.ie/about/ ''What are VECs?'', (Cork VEC), visited 20 October 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Adult Literacy and Basic Education
*Back To Education Initiative (BTEI)
*Adult Refugee Programme (ARP)

VECs also administered maintenance grants and bursaries for third-level education until 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quick guide to the SUSI grant process|url=http://www.studentfinance.ie/mp9544/quick-guide-to-the-susi-grant-process/index.html|work=studentfinance.ie|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, County Dublin VEC opened the first Community [[National school (Ireland)|National School]], in [[Porterstown]], Dublin 15. This marked the first time a VEC had become involved in primary school education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codubvec.ie/index.cfm/go/news_one/news_key/266]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
VECs were originally established in each [[administrative county]] and [[county borough]] in the then [[Irish Free State]]. In addition, a VEC was formed in those [[municipal borough]]s and [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]s which had a separate Technical Instruction Committee under the 1899 legislation (namely [[Bray, County Wicklow|Bray]], [[Drogheda]], [[Sligo]], [[Tralee]] and [[Wexford]]) and in the newly created [[Corporation of Dún Laoghaire|Borough of Dún Laoghaire]].

The number of VECs was reduced to the final number of thirty-three when five town committees were amalgamated with the adjacent county committees, leaving Dún Laoghaire as the only VEC area not consisting of a city or county.

===Committees===
Each Vocational Education Committee was elected by the county, borough or urban district council and consisted partly of councillors and partly of persons with an ''"interest and experience in education"'' and who could be recommended by bodies ''"interested in manufacture or trades"''.

The Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 2001 changed the composition of the committees, and parents of students under 18 and members of the staff were also entitled to elect committee members. Members could also be appointed to represent the interests of students, voluntary organisations, community organisations, [[Irish language]] interests and business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0023/index.html Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 2001, accessed 20 October 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Griesemer]], Jeffry Ramsey, Sahotra Sarkar, [[Jeffrey Schank]], and Marty Sereno.&lt;ref name="Bechtel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wimsatt Fest|url=http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/conferences/_files/Wimsatt%20Fest.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal===

Wimsatt is the son of the late [[William A. Wimsatt]] who was a Cornell University professor specializing in bats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kwiecinski|first=Gary G.|author2=Mark A. Cukierski |title=William A. Wimsatt: Dedication and biography|journal=American Journal of Anatomy|date=April 1987|volume=178|issue=4|pages=309–311|doi=10.1002/aja.1001780402|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aja.1001780402/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was married to Barbara Horberg on June 13, 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wimsatt|first=William|title="short" Curriculum Vita|url=http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/files/wimsatt/WimsattCV.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has one son, [[William Upski Wimsatt]], known as an author and political activist.

==Philosophy==

Wimsatt's philosophical position starts with two themes: we are limited beings and the world we try to understand is complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Richardson|first=Robert C.|title=Re-Engineering Philosophy for Limited Beings: Piecewise Approximations to Reality|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23284/?id=11965|publisher=University of Notre Dame}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The problem then is how to build a philosophical world view based on these two themes. For Wimsatt, ''robustness'' (e.g., believing that a particular apple exists because we can see it, feel it, smell it, taste it, and hear it crunch when we eat it) is fundamental for accessing what exists in the world. The more we can detect things in multiple ways, the more we are inclined to believe they exist. Closely connected to robustness are the [[heuristics]], which we use to think about the world and are foundational to his epistemology. They are rules of thumb, which can be wrong or biased but tend to work when applied to what is robust in the world.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with William Wimsatt|url=http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/07/071004.wimsatt.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For Wimsatt, questions of [[Philosophical realism|realism]] (i.e., what exists) are not separable from questions of [[epistemology]] (i.e., what we can know) and the discovery of what exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wimsatt|first=William|title=Video on philosophy and philosophy of biology|url=http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/07/video/071004.wimsatt6.mov}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may appear circular, but it is by [[evolution]] that we have evolved multiple ways of detecting things in the world.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;
