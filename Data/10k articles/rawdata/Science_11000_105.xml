      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4040">An '''abutter''' is a person (or entity) whose property is adjacent to the property of another. In jurisdictions such as [[Massachusetts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Laws: CHAPTER 40A, Section 11|url=https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleVII/Chapter40A/Section11|publisher=The Massachusetts General Court|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Hampshire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TITLE LXIV PLANNING AND ZONING: CHAPTER 672 GENERAL PROVISIONS: Words and Phrases Defined: Section 672:3 |url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/lxiv/672/672-3.htm |publisher=The New Hampshire General Court |accessdate=18 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924040720/http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/lxiv/672/672-3.htm |archivedate=24 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nova Scotia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abandonment of Rights of Way|url=http://www.lians.ca/sites/default/files/documents/AbandonmentOfRights-of-way.pdf|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Halifax Regional Municipality By Law Affecting Streets|url=https://halifax.ca/legislation/bylaws/hrm/documents/By-LawS-300.pdf|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is a defined legal term. Some  jurisdictions, such as [[Virginia]], may use the term '''adjacent landowner''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fairfax County Planning Commission Glossary|url=http://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/planning/glossary.htm|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others, such as [[California]], use the term '''adjoining landowner''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Code Section 841|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=841.&amp;lawCode=CIV|website=California Code|publisher=State of California|access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] defines rights of '''contiguous property owners''' (CPO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contiguous Property Owners|url=http://www2.epa.gov/enforcement/contiguous-property-owners|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove section|date=February 2015}}
In [[land use]] regulations, concerns of an abutter may be given special attention, being the one most likely to suffer specific harm from a hasty, uninformed decision. For example, a developer requesting a [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] may be required to notify (or pay to notify) all abutters of the proposal and invite them to a public hearing. Regulations may also provide an abutter with the right to be heard at the hearing, unlike others who must request permission to be heard, at the discretion of the board.

In the spirit of [[land use politics]], even the unified voices of the concerned abutters may sound only faintly against the machinery of "progress" or well-funded special interests. However, the courts will objectively consider a proper case brought by an abutter whose rights have been arguably under-appreciated.  Generally, the more abutters interested in a project, the more likely someone will object to it. 

Some regulations otherwise expand or limit the participation of local owners, as where notice may be required for "anyone whose property is within 200 feet of any point of the parcel under consideration."  Another expansive definition would include those whose properties are across a public way or flowing waterway, where the parcels do not actually touch. Contrarily, regulations may define "abutter" to include only those people who hold record title to an adjacent parcel, thus undermining the rights of tenants, associations and partial owners (e.g., mineral rights and easement owners) to be notified, let alone heard on a proposal. This would also eliminate participation of owners of unrecorded title, such as [[adverse possession]] or those who have simply failed to record a [[deed]] or settle an [[will (law)|estate]] involving the adjacent property.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4281">'''Adaptability''' ({{lang-la|adapt≈ç}} "fit to, adjust") is a feature of a system or of a process. This word has been put to use as a specialised term in different disciplines and in business operations. Word definitions of adaptability as a specialised term differ little from [[wikt:adaptability|dictionary definitions]]. According to Andresen and Gronau&lt;ref&gt;Andresen, K., Gronau, N.: An Approach to Increase Adaptability in ERP Systems. In: Managing Modern Organizations with Information Technology : Proceedings of the 2005 Information Resources Management Association International Conference, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; adaptability in the field of organizational management can in general be seen as an ability to change something or oneself to fit to occurring changes. In ecology, adaptability has been described as the ability to cope with unexpected disturbances in the environment. 

With respect to business and manufacturing systems and processes, adaptability has come to be seen increasingly as an important factor for their efficiency and economic success. In contrast, adaptability and efficiency are held to be in opposition to each other in biological and ecological systems, requiring a trade-off, since both are important factors in the success of such systems.&lt;ref name="Conrad, Michael 1983"&gt;{{cite book |author=Conrad, Michael |title=Adaptability, the Significance of Variability from Molecule to Ecosystem |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |year=1983 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jRXaBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=Adaptability+the+Significance+of+Variability+from+Molecule+to+Ecosystem+Plenum+Press+New+York+1983+Conrad+Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; To determine the adaptability of a process or a system, it should be validated concerning some criteria.

==Development of the use of this term==
In the life sciences the term adaptability is used variously.  At one end of the spectrum, the ordinary meaning of the word suffices for understanding.  At the other end, there is the term as introduced by Conrad,&lt;ref&gt;Conrad, M. 1972.  Statistical and Hierarchical Aspects of Biological Organization.  pp. 189-220 in Towards a Theoretical Biology, Vol. 4, ed. by [[C. H. Waddington]], Edinburgh University Press, Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; referring to a particular [[Entropy (information theory)|information entropy]] measure of the biota of an ecosystem, or of any subsystem of the biota, such as a population of a single species, a single individual, cell, protein or gene.

In the technical research field this feature has been considered only since the late 1990s. H. P. Wiendahl first introduced adaptability as a necessary feature of a [[Manufacturing Execution Systems|manufacturing system]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Wiendahl, H.-P.; Hern√°ndez, R.; Scheffczyk, H. (1999): Die Wandlungsf√§hige Fabrik ‚Äì Ans√§tze und L√∂sungen, Tagungsband zur Fachkonferenz, Frankfurt am Main, 26. und 27. April (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The need to consider adaptability arose in the context of factory planning, where it is an objective to develop modular, adaptable systems.  It has now become an important consideration for manufacturing and system engineers.

==Adaptability of a system==
{{details|Adaptation (computer science)}}
Adaptability is to be understood here as the ability of a [[system]] (e.g. a [[computer system]]) to adapt itself efficiently and fast to changed circumstances. An [[adaptive system]] is therefore an [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]] that is able to fit its behaviour according to changes in its environment or in parts of the system itself. That is why a requirement to recognize the demand for change without any other factors involved can be expressed.&lt;ref&gt;Andresen, K., Gronau, N.: An Approach to Increase Adaptability in ERP Systems. In: Managing Modern Organizations with Information Technology: Proceedings of the 2005 Information Resources Management Association International Conference, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andresen, K.: Design and Use Patterns of Adaptability in Enterprise Systems, Gito, Berlin; 2006; S. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16892">In [[psychology]], an '''affectional bond''' is a type of attachment behavior one individual has for another individual,&lt;ref name="Bowlby 2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bowlby, J. |title=The Making and Breaking of Affectional Bonds |publisher=Routledge Classics |year=2005 |isbn=0-415-35481-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically a caregiver for her or his child,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.personalityresearch.org/papers/pendry.html&lt;/ref&gt; in which the two partners tend to remain in proximity to one another.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 2005"/&gt; The term was coined and subsequently developed over the course of four decades, from the early 1940s to the late 1970s, by psychologist [[John Bowlby]] in his work on [[attachment theory]]. The core of the term ''affectional bond'', according to Bowlby, is the attraction one individual has for another individual. The central features of the concept of affectional bonding can be traced to Bowlby's 1958 paper, "The Nature of the Child's Tie to his Mother".&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, J. (1958). "The Nature of the Childs Tie to his Mother." ''[[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]'' 39: 350‚Äì373.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Five criteria==
Bowlby referred to attachment bonds as a specific type of "affectional" bond, as described by him and developmental psychologist [[Mary Ainsworth]]. She established five criteria for affectional bonds between individuals, and a sixth criterion for attachment bonds:
* An affectional bond is persistent, not transitory.
* An affectional bond involves a particular person who is not interchangeable with anyone else.
* An affectional bond involves a relationship that is emotionally significant.
* The individual wishes to maintain proximity or contact with the person with whom he or she has an affectional tie.
* The individual feels sadness or distress at involuntary separation from the person.

An attachment bond has an additional criterion: the person seeks security and comfort in the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, M.D.S. (1989). Attachments beyond infancy. ''American Psychologist'', 44, 709716. Reference for the entire section "Five criteria"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attachment theory==

===Background===

Bowlby believed that there were four distinguishing characteristics of attachment. These included:

*Proximity Maintenance: The desire to be near the people we are attached to.
*Safe Haven: Returning to the attachment figure for comfort and safety in the face of fear or threat.
*Secure Base: The attachment figure acts as a base of security from which the child can explore the surrounding environment.
*Separation Distress: Anxiety that occurs in the absence of the attachment figure.

Bowlby's thoughts on distinguishing attachment led the way for many other psychologists' viewpoints on attachment and the various bonds that attachment coincides with.&lt;ref name = "Bowlby, J."&gt;Bowlby, J. (1988). A Secure Base. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attachment through the lifespan==

===Attachment style===
Child psychologist Mary Ainsworth further expanded on Bowlby's research by conducting an experiment that is known as the "Strange Situation" experiment. In the experiment, a parent and child are alone in the room. A stranger then walks into the room and talks to the parent. After some amount of time, the parent quietly exits the room, leaving the stranger and child in the room. The child then reacts to the situation at hand and then the parent re-enters the room and comforts the child. From this groundbreaking study, Ainsworth developed different forms of attachment styles that infants display with the people they are close to.&lt;ref name = "Ainsworth"&gt;Ainsworth, M.; Blehar, M.; Waters, E.; and Wall, S. (1978). Patterns of Attachment. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt;

====Secure attachment====
[[Secure attachment]] in infancy was characterized by noticeable distress when the parent left the room. When the parent returned, the child was extremely happy to see them. Infants are more likely to choose a parent over any other person, especially a stranger. As they embark on childhood, those who maintain secure attachment have an easier time making friends and meeting new people and hold a trustworthy bond with their parents.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth" /&gt; Adolescents benefit from parental support, but they are also beginning to make the transitions from relying heavily on their parents to a more independent environment with more freedom.&lt;ref name = "Doyle, Moretti, Voss &amp; Margolese"&gt;Doyle, A. B., Moretti, M. M., Voss, K., &amp; Margolese, S. (2006, February). Attachment to parents and adjustment in adolescents: Literature review and policy implications. Retrieved from http://www.cyc-net.org/cyc-online/cycol-0206-attachment.html&lt;/ref&gt; In adulthood, they are more likely to have long-lasting relationships, high self-esteem, find pleasure from romantic relationships and are able to easily talk with their partners.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth" /&gt;

====Ambivalent-insecure attachment====
'''Ambivalent attachment''' is characterized by a strong wariness towards strangers. Children get extremely uncomfortable when they do not have a noticeable face in the room. When the parent returns, the child receives no comfort from their return and is inconsolable.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth" /&gt; In childhood, these children tend to act "clingy" towards their parents and tend to heavily rely on others. In adulthood, they have difficulty with trust and feel that their partner does not exhibit the same feelings towards them. Insecurely attached adults tend to act cold and experience many break-ups throughout their life.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth"/&gt;

====Avoidant-insecure attachment====
Infants and children with '''avoidant attachment''' tend to show no preference between their caregivers and the stranger. They do not actively seek much comfort of contact from their parents and usually tend to avoid them. In adulthood, those with avoidant attachment have difficulty maintaining relationships due to the inability to display emotions. They are more likely to engage in casual sex and think about other people or things while they are having sex. Finally, they are not likely to be supportive when other people are in stressful situations and have an inability to look at ideas in another person's perspective.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth"/&gt;

====Disorganized-insecure attachment====

'''Disorganized Attachment''' in infants tends to display avoidant and unsure behavior. They tend to be in a daze and seem confused about the situation that they are in. They tend not show any clear signs of attachment at any point in their lives.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth" /&gt;

This fourth form of attachment was observed in later studies conducted by Main and Solomon.&lt;ref name = "Main &amp; Solomon"&gt;Main, M., &amp; Solomon, J. (1986). Discovery of an insecure-disorganized/ disoriented attachment pattern: Procedures, findings and implications for the classification of behavior. In T. B. Brazelton &amp; M. Yogman (Eds.), Affective Development in Infancy, 95-124. Norwood, NJ: Ablex.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies have supported Ainsworth's observations. These studies have also shown that attachment styles developed in infancy can influence behavior later in life. Children in this group tend to take on a parental role and act like a caregiver toward their parent. They display an overall inconsistent form of behavior. Research by Main and Hesse showed that parents who use tactics of fear and assurance contribute to this disorganized form of attachment.&lt;ref name = "Main &amp; Hesse"&gt;Main, M., &amp; Hesse, E. (1990). Parents' unresolved traumatic experiences are related to infant disorganized attachment status: Is frightened/frightening parental behavior the linking mechanism? In M. T. Greenberg, D. Cicchetti, &amp; E. M. Cummings (Eds.), Attachment in the Preschool Years: Theory, Research, and Intervention, 161-182. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goal corrected partnership===

According to Bowlby's ideas of attachment, '''goal-corrected partnership''' is the last stage that a child experiences. It usually happens around age three. As the child begins spending more time with their caregiver, they begin to realize that their caregiver has goals and ideas of their own that may not concern the child.&lt;ref name = "Benson"&gt;Benson, J. B. (2009). Social and emotional development in infancy and early childhood. (1 ed., Vol. 1, p. 34). San Diego, CA: Academic Press. Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=VUvdHreepDYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq Social and Emotional Development in Infancy and Early Childhood&amp;ots=Ox_xcFAxi9&amp;sig=UZW8V21UjzOOCsExAThrRCY_CHk&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the child begins to "mold their behavior in order to please or impress the caregiver". This type of bond is most likely to occur between the infant and the mother.

==Caregivers==

[[Caregivers]] play an important role in children's lives for several reasons. It is important for the child to have an affectional bond with the person who is caring for that child. According to Bowlby, caregivers can be anyone who is caring for the child but is usually the mother or father of that child. Children place a high value on their relationship with their parents and will alter their behavior to meet the desired behavior from their parents. Bowlby explains by the time the child has reached twelve months of age the child has developed a strong relationship with his mother.  Freud who is cited in Bowlby's article "The Nature of the Child's Tie to his Mother" says that a child's first love is a satisfaction of the need for food and an object for food, so either the mother's breast or bottle of milk.&lt;ref name = "Bowlby"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1958). "The Nature of the Childs Tie to his Mother." International Journal of Psychoanalysis 39: 350‚Äì373.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowlby has four theories that explain how the attachment and bond are created between a child and his or her caregiver.

*Secondary drive: When the physiological needs of the child are met, for example when the child needs are met by the mother feeding or keeping her child warm.
*Primary object sucking: Infants have an innate quality that needs to be filled by sucking on the mother's breast which he realized is connected to his mother, therefore creating a stronger bond.
*Primary object clinging: Besides food as a primary need, the feel or touch of another human is also a primary need for infants so they cling to their parents to meet this need.
*Primary return-to-womb craving: Infants crave to go back inside their mother's womb.

==Other affectional bonds through the lifespan==

===Mother to infant===
The bond between mothers and infants has been determined to be the core bond during the lifespan for mothers and children.  At birth, mothers go through a postpartum period where they feel detached from their infant and need to create a new bond different from the one that was created during the prenatal period.  The bond between mother and infant is just as important to the mother as it is to the infant.  This bond can be formed after the once believed critical period of postpartum skin contact.  This first emotional bond is the basis of all future relationships and bonds in the child's future.&lt;ref name = "books.google.com"&gt;
https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=0BBIVLW5HKUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=affectional+bond&amp;ots=XVKDgT4Lxb&amp;sig=WAuJ7vWXdX_qQ7h2FmQA2WPpItc#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Father to child===
The bond between father and child has been found to be more important than previously believed, however it has not been found to be as important as the bond between mother and child.  Children do bond with fathers as a caregiver but the level of the strength of the bond is dependent upon the level of involvement by the father.  However, there is not sufficient research on the subject to draw any other conclusions on the bond and on father's involvement.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

===Sexual partnership===
The bond between sexual partners is characterized with three components which are reproductive, attachment and caregiver, and they may be more prevalent in certain relationships than in others.  In some sexual partnerships there is only a reproductive component, with no emotional attachment.  When an attachment is formed on top of the reproductive bond, the male is likely to take on a caregiver role with offspring as well as his mate; which in western culture is usually his wife.  In western culture the pair often exchanges levels of care, and attachment throughout the lifespan.  In traditional married couples the level of sexual attachment changes throughout the lifespan of the relationship thus stating that there are other important aspects of the bond between man and wife.  Couples share an emotional and intellectual bond on top of the sexual one.  In western society traditional gender roles are being challenged which is impacting the level of male caregiver attachment to his wife; however there is not a large field of research on the subject.&lt;ref name = "books.google.com"/&gt;

Homosexual couples are hypothesized to share much of the same attachment components; however there is little research on the subject to draw conclusions from.&lt;ref name = "books.google.com"/&gt;

===Friends, companions, intimates===
The bond formed between friends, companions and intimates are essential bonds to the lifetime.  These bonds are essential for social development because they differ from the bonds formed with parents and other kin.  Humans are naturally social creatures thus forming bonds with other people comes naturally.  These relationships are often formed through common interests, and proximity.  Friendships begin in early childhood, and last throughout adulthood.  Many different friendships are formed throughout the lifespan and they can be any length of time.  Again, these bonds tend to not be as strong as those formed with other kin, but the social aspects of them are essential to development.&lt;ref name = "books.google.com" /&gt;

===Siblings and other kin===
The bond between siblings and other kin is largely dependent upon the age of the kin, and the level of involvement with the child.  Older siblings can take on more of a parental role with younger siblings thus creating more of a parental bond.  This parental bond is found when a parent dies, or when the level of parental involvement is low, however this area of research is still fairly new.  Siblings that are close in age often have more of a friendship bond.  Siblings can also have a different type of bond that is not seen in other relationships because siblings have a close bond but may have more indecisive feelings towards each other.&lt;ref name = "books.google.com"/&gt;

The bond between other kin is largely dependent on the society that the child grows up in.  In more collectivist cultures the bond between kin is stronger than in the individualistic ones.  The level of bond between kin is often because of shared values, culture, background, and personal experiences.  There is little research on this subject thus the level of information is still low.&lt;ref name = "books.google.com"/&gt;

==Harlow's attachment in non-human animals==
Attachment is not something that is only limited to humans, it is seen in non-human animals as well. A classic study demonstrating attachment in animals was done by Harry Harlow with his macaque monkeys. His study suggests that an infant not only feels attachment to his/her mother because of needs for nutrients and protection, but they feel attachment to their mother for needs of comfort as well.&lt;ref name = "Harlow"&gt;Harlow, H. F. (1958). The nature of love. American Psychologist, 13, 673-685.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Harry Harlow's experiment he separated infant monkeys from their mothers 6‚Äì12 hours after birth and raised them in a laboratory, isolated from humans and other monkeys. In each cage these infant monkeys had two "mothers." One mother was made solely from wire, and the other mother was made from a block of wood and sponge rubber which was then wrapped with terry cloth; both radiated heat. In one condition only the wire mother nursed, and in the other condition only the terry cloth mother nursed.&lt;ref name = "Harlow"/&gt;

The results show that infant monkeys spent significantly more time with the terry cloth mother whether she provided nutrients or not.&lt;ref name="Harlow"/&gt; This demonstrates that infants not only need their mothers to provide food and protection, but they need to provide some sort of comfort as well.

The emergence and need for the analysis of different types of data generated through biological research has given rise to the field of [[bioinformatics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rothberg|first=J|author2=Merriman, B|author3= Higgs, G|title=Bioinformatics. Introduction|journal=The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine|date=September 2012|volume=85|issue=3|pages=305‚Äì8|pmid=23189382|pmc=3447194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular sequence and structure data of [[DNA]], [[RNA]], and [[proteins]], [[gene expression]] profiles or [[microarray]] data, [[metabolic pathway]] data are some of the major types of data being analysed in bioinformatics. Among them sequence data is increasing at the exponential rate due to advent of next-generation sequencing technologies. Since the origin of bioinformatics, [[sequence analysis]] has remained the major area of research with wide range of applications in database searching, [[genome annotation]], [[comparative genomics]], [[molecular phylogeny]] and [[gene prediction]]. The pioneering approaches for sequence analysis were based on [[sequence alignment]] either global or local, pairwise or [[multiple sequence alignment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Batzoglou|first=S|title=The many faces of sequence alignment|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|date=March 2005|volume=6|issue=1|pages=6‚Äì22|pmid=15826353|doi=10.1093/bib/6.1.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mullan|first=L|title=Pairwise sequence alignment‚Äîit's all about us!|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|date=March 2006|volume=7|issue=1|pages=113‚Äì5|pmid=16761368|doi=10.1093/bib/bbk008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alignment-based approaches generally give excellent results when the sequences under study are closely related and can be reliably aligned, but when the sequences are divergent, a reliable alignment cannot be obtained and hence the applications of sequence alignment are limited. Another limitation of alignment-based approaches is their computational complexity and are time-consuming and thus, are limited when dealing with large-scale sequence data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kemena|first=C|author2=Notredame, C|title=Upcoming challenges for multiple sequence alignment methods in the high-throughput era|journal=Bioinformatics|date=Oct 1, 2009|volume=25|issue=19|pages=2455‚Äì65|pmid=19648142|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btp452|pmc=2752613}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of [[next-generation sequencing]] technologies has resulted in generation of voluminous sequencing data. The size of this sequence data poses challenges on alignment-based algorithms in their assembly, annotation and comparative studies.

== Alignment-free methods ==
Alignment-free methods can broadly be classified into four categories: a) methods based on ''k''-mer/word frequency, b) methods based on substrings, c) methods based on information theory and d) methods based on graphical representation.

=== Methods based on ''k''-mer/word frequency ===
The popular methods based on ''k''-mer/word frequencies include feature frequency profile (FFP),&lt;ref name="FFP"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sims|first=GE|author2=Jun, SR|author3= Wu, GA|author4= Kim, SH|title=Whole-genome phylogeny of mammals: evolutionary information in genic and nongenic regions.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Oct 6, 2009|volume=106|issue=40|pages=17077‚Äì82|pmid=19805074|doi=10.1073/pnas.0909377106|pmc=2761373|bibcode=2009PNAS..10617077S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sims|first=GE|author2=Kim, SH|title=Whole-genome phylogeny of Escherichia coli/Shigella group by feature frequency profiles (FFPs).|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=May 17, 2011|volume=108|issue=20|pages=8329‚Äì34|pmid=21536867|doi=10.1073/pnas.1105168108|pmc=3100984|bibcode=2011PNAS..108.8329S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composition vector (CV),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gao|first=L|author2=Qi, J|title=Whole genome molecular phylogeny of large dsDNA viruses using composition vector method.|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|date=Mar 15, 2007|volume=7|pages=41|pmid=17359548|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-7-41|pmc=1839080}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=H|author2=Xu, Z|author3= Gao, L|author4= Hao, B|title=A fungal phylogeny based on 82 complete genomes using the composition vector method.|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|date=Aug 10, 2009|volume=9|pages=195|pmid=19664262|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-9-195|pmc=3087519}}&lt;/ref&gt; Return time distribution (RTD),&lt;ref name="RTD1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kolekar|first=P|author2=Kale, M|author3= Kulkarni-Kale, U|title=Alignment-free distance measure based on return time distribution for sequence analysis: applications to clustering, molecular phylogeny and subtyping.|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics &amp; Evolution|date=November 2012|volume=65|issue=2|pages=510‚Äì22|pmid=22820020|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2012.07.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; frequency chaos game representation (FCGR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hatje|first=K|author2=Kollmar, M|title=A phylogenetic analysis of the brassicales clade based on an alignment-free sequence comparison method.|journal=Frontiers in Plant Science|year=2012|volume=3|pages=192|pmid=22952468|doi=10.3389/fpls.2012.00192|pmc=3429886}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Spaced Words &lt;ref name=spaced /&gt;

==== Feature frequency profile (FFP) ====
The methodology involved in FFP based method starts by calculating the count of each possible ''k''-mer (possible number of ''k''-mers for nucleotide sequence: 4&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;, while that for protein sequence: 20&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;) in sequences. Each ''k''-mer count in each sequence is then normalized by dividing it by total of all ''k''-mers' count in that sequence. This leads to conversion of each sequence into its feature frequency profile. The pair wise distance between two sequences is then calculated [[Jensen‚ÄìShannon divergence|Jensen‚ÄìShannon (JS) divergence]] between their respective FFPs. The [[distance matrix]] thus obtained can be used to construct [[phylogenetic tree]] using clustering algorithms like [[neighbor-joining]], [[UPGMA]] etc.

==== Composition vector (CV) ====
In this method frequency of appearance of each possible ''k''-mer in a given sequence is calculated. The next characteristic step of this method is the subtraction of random background of these frequencies using [[Markov model]] to reduce the influence of random neutral [[mutations]] to highlight the role of selective evolution. The normalized frequencies are put a fixed order to form the composition vector (CV) of a given sequence. [[Cosine distance]] function is then used to compute pairwise distance between CVs of sequences. The distance matrix thus obtained can be used to construct phylogenetic tree using clustering algorithms like [[neighbor-joining]], [[UPGMA]] etc. This method can be extended through resort to efficient pattern matching algorithms to include in the computation of the composition vectors: (i) all ''k''-mers for any value of ''k'', (ii) all substrings of any length up to an arbitrarily set maximum ''k'' value, (iii) all maximal substrings, where a substring is maximal if extending it by any character would cause a decrease in its occurrence count.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Apostolico|first=A|author2=Denas, O |title=Fast algorithms for computing sequence distances by exhaustive substring composition.|journal=Algorithms for Molecular Biology|date=March 2008|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Apostolico|first=A|author2=Denas, O|author3= Dress, A |title=Efficient tools for comparative substring analysis.|journal= Journal of Biotechnology|date=September 2010|volume=149|issue=3|pages=120‚Äì126|doi=10.1016/j.jbiotec.2010.05.006|pmid=20682467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Return time distribution (RTD) ====
The RTD based method does not calculate the count of ''k''-mers in sequences, instead it computes the time required for the reappearance of 
''k''-mers. The time refers to the number of residues in successive appearance of particular ''k''-mer. Thus the occurrence of each ''k''-mer in a sequence is calculated in the form of RTD, which is then summarised using two statistical parameters [[mean]] (Œº) and [[standard deviation]] (œÉ). Thus each sequence is represented in the form of numeric vector of size 2&amp;middot;4&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; containing ''Œº'' and ''œÉ'' of 4&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; RTDs. The pair wise distance between sequences is calculated using [[Euclidean distance]] measure. The distance matrix thus obtained can be used to construct phylogenetic tree using clustering algorithms like [[neighbor-joining]], [[UPGMA]] etc.

==== Frequency chaos game representation (FCGR) ====
The FCGR methods have evolved from chaos game representation (CGR) technique, which provides scale independent representation for genomic sequences.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey 2163‚Äì70"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jeffrey|first=HJ|title=Chaos game representation of gene structure.|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=April 25, 1990|volume=18|issue=8|pages=2163‚Äì70|pmid=2336393|doi=10.1093/nar/18.8.2163|pmc=330698}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CGRs can be divided by grid lines where each grid square denotes the occurrence of oligonucleotides of a specific length in the sequence. Such representation of CGRs is termed as Frequency Chaos Game Representation (FCGR). This leads to representation of each sequence into FCGR. The pair wise distance between FCGRs of sequences can be calculated using the Pearson distance, the Hamming distance or the Euclidean distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Y|author2=Hill, K|author3= Singh, S|author4= Kari, L|title=The spectrum of genomic signatures: from dinucleotides to chaos game representation.|journal=Gene|date=Feb 14, 2005|volume=346|pages=173‚Äì85|pmid=15716010|doi=10.1016/j.gene.2004.10.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spaced-word frequencies====
While most alignment-free algorithms compare the word-composition of sequences, Spaced Words uses a pattern of care and don't care positions. The occurrence of a spaced word in a sequence is then defined by the characters at the match positions only, while the characters at the don't care positions are ignored.  Instead of comparing the frequencies of contiguous words in the input sequences, this approach compares the frequencies of the spaced words according to the pre-defined pattern.&lt;ref name=spaced/&gt; Note that the pre-defined pattern can be selected by analysis of the [[Variance]] of the number of matches,&lt;ref name=rasbhari&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hahn|first=L|author2=Leimeister, CA|author3=Ounit, R|author4=Lonardi, S|author5=Morgenstern, B|title=rasbhari: Optimizing Spaced Seeds for Database Searching, Read Mapping and Alignment-Free Sequence Comparison.|journal=PLOS Computational Biology|date=Oct 19, 2016|volume=12|issue=10|pages=e1005107|pmid=27760124|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005107|pmc=5070788|arxiv=1511.04001|bibcode=2016PLSCB..12E5107H}}&lt;/ref&gt; the probability of the first occurrence on several models,&lt;ref name=bhit&gt;{{cite journal|last=Noe|first=L|title=Best hits of 11110110111: model-free selection and parameter-free sensitivity calculation of spaced seeds.|journal=Algorithms for Molecular Biology|date=Feb 14, 2017|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1|doi=10.1186/s13015-017-0092-1|pmid=28289437|pmc=5310094}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Pearson correlation coefficient]] between the expected word frequency and the true alignment distance.&lt;ref name=Cov/&gt;

=== Methods based on substrings ===

The methods in this category employ the [[Semantic similarity|similarity]] and differences of substrings in a pair of sequences. These algorithms
were mostly used for string processing in [[computer science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gusfield|first=Dan|title=Algorithms on strings, trees, and sequences : computer science and computational biology|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=9780521585194|edition=Reprinted (with corr.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Average common substring (ACS) ====

In this approach, for a chosen pair of sequences (A and B of lengths ''n'' and ''m'' respectively), [[Longest common substring problem|longest substring]] starting at some position is identified in one sequence (A) which exactly matches in the other sequence (B) at any position. In this way, lengths of longest substrings starting at different positions in sequence A and having exact matches at some positions in sequence B are calculated. All these lengths are averaged to derive a measure &lt;math&gt;L(A, B)&lt;/math&gt;. Intuitively, larger the &lt;math&gt;L(A, B)&lt;/math&gt;, the more similar the two sequences are. To account for the differences in the length of sequences, &lt;math&gt;L(A, B)&lt;/math&gt; is normalized [i.e. &lt;math&gt;L(A, B)/\log(m)&lt;/math&gt;]. This gives the similarity measure between the sequences.

In order to derive a distance measure, the inverse of [[similarity measure]] is taken and a [[correction term]] is subtracted from it to assure that &lt;math&gt;d(A, A)&lt;/math&gt; will be zero. Thus

: &lt;math&gt;d(A, B) = \left [ \frac{\log m}{L(A, B)} \right] - \left[\frac{\log n}{L(A, A)} \right]. &lt;/math&gt;

This measure &lt;math&gt;d(A, B)&lt;/math&gt; is not symmetric, so one has to compute &lt;math&gt;d_s(A, B) = d_s(B, A) = (d(A, B) + d(B, A))/2&lt;/math&gt;, which gives final ACS measure between the two strings (A and B).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ulitsky|first=I|author2=Burstein, D|author3= Tuller, T|author4= Chor, B|title=The average common substring approach to phylogenomic reconstruction.|journal=Journal of Computational Biology : A Journal of Computational Molecular Cell Biology|date=March 2006|volume=13|issue=2|pages=336‚Äì50|pmid=16597244|doi=10.1089/cmb.2006.13.336|citeseerx=10.1.1.106.5122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequence/substring search can be efficiently performed by

==== ''k''-mismatch average common substring approach (kmacs) ====
This approach is a generalization of the ACS approach. To define the distance between two DNA or protein sequences, kmacs estimates for each position ''i'' of the first sequence the longest substring starting at ''i'' and matching a substring of the second sequence with up to ''k'' mismatches. It defines the average of these values as a measure of similarity between the sequences and turns this into a symmetric distance measure. Kmacs does not compute exact ''k''-mismatch substrings, since this would be computational too costly, but approximates such substrings.&lt;ref name=kmacs/&gt;

==== Mutation distances (Kr) ====

This approach is closely related to the ACS, which calculates the number of substitutions per site between two DNA sequences using the shortest 
absent substring (termed as shustring).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haubold|first=B|author2=Pfaffelhuber, P|author3= Domazet-Loso, M|author4= Wiehe, T|title=Estimating mutation distances from unaligned genomes.|journal=Journal of Computational Biology : A Journal of Computational Molecular Cell Biology|date=October 2009|volume=16|issue=10|pages=1487‚Äì500|pmid=19803738|doi=10.1089/cmb.2009.0106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods based on information theory ===

[[Information Theory]] has provided successful methods for alignment-free sequence analysis and comparison. The existing applications of information theory include global and local characterization of DNA, RNA and proteins, estimating genome entropy to motif and region classification. It also holds promise in [[gene mapping]], [[next-generation sequencing]] analysis and [[metagenomics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vinga|first=S|title=Information theory applications for biological sequence analysis.|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|date=Sep 20, 2013|pmid=24058049|doi=10.1093/bib/bbt068|volume=15|issue=3|pages=376‚Äì389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Base‚Äìbase correlation (BBC) ====

Base‚Äìbase correlation (BBC) converts the genome sequence into a unique 16-dimensional numeric vector using the following equation,

: &lt;math&gt;T_{ij}(K) = \sum_{\ell=1}^K P_{ij}(\ell) \cdot \log_2 \left ( \frac{P_{ij}(\ell)}{P_i P_j} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_j&lt;/math&gt; denotes the probabilities of bases ''i'' and ''j'' in the genome. The &lt;math&gt;P_{ij}(\ell)&lt;/math&gt; indicates the probability of bases ''i'' and ''j'' at distance ''‚Ñì'' in the genome. The parameter ''K'' indicates the maximum distance between the bases ''i'' and ''j''. The variation in the values of 16 parameters reflect variation in the genome content and length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=Z|author2=Meng, J|author3= Sun, X|title=A novel feature-based method for whole genome phylogenetic analysis without alignment: application to HEV genotyping and subtyping.|journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications|date=Apr 4, 2008|volume=368|issue=2|pages=223‚Äì30|pmid=18230342|doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.01.070}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=ZH|author2=Sun, X|title=Coronavirus phylogeny based on base-base correlation.|journal=International Journal of Bioinformatics Research and Applications|year=2008|volume=4|issue=2|pages=211‚Äì20|pmid=18490264|doi=10.1504/ijbra.2008.018347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheng|first=J|author2=Zeng, X|author3= Ren, G|author4= Liu, Z|title=CGAP: a new comprehensive platform for the comparative analysis of chloroplast genomes.|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|date=Mar 14, 2013|volume=14|pages=95|pmid=23496817|pmc=3636126|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-14-95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Information correlation and partial information correlation (IC-PIC) ====
IC-PIC ([[information correlation]] and partial information correlation) based method employs the base correlation property of DNA sequence. IC and PIC were calculated using following formulas,

: &lt;math&gt; IC_\ell = -2 \sum_i P_i \log_2 P_i + \sum_{ij} P_{ij} (\ell) \log_2 P_{ij} (\ell)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; PIC_{ij} (\ell) = (P_{ij} (\ell) - P_i P_j (\ell))^2&lt;/math&gt;

The final vector is obtained as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;V = {IC_\ell \over PIC_{ij} (\ell)} \text{ where } \ell \isin \left \{ \ell_0, \ell_0 + 1, \ldots, \ell_0 + n \right \}, &lt;/math&gt;

which defines the range of distance between bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gao|first=Y|author2=Luo, L|title=Genome-based phylogeny of dsDNA viruses by a novel alignment-free method.|journal=Gene|date=Jan 15, 2012|volume=492|issue=1|pages=309‚Äì14|pmid=22100880|doi=10.1016/j.gene.2011.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pairwise distance between sequences is calculated using [[Euclidean distance]] measure. The distance matrix thus obtained can be used to construct phylogenetic tree using clustering algorithms like [[neighbor-joining]], [[UPGMA]], etc..

==== Lempel‚ÄìZiv compression ====
[[Lempel-Ziv complexity]] uses the [[relative information]] between the sequences. This complexity is measured by the number of steps required to generate a string given the prior knowledge of another string and a self-delimiting production process. This measure has a relation to measuring ''k''-words in a sequence, as they can be easily used to generate the sequence. It is computational intensive method. Otu and Sayood (2003) used this method to construct five different distance measures for [[phylogenetic tree]] construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Otu|first=HH|author2=Sayood, K|title=A new sequence distance measure for phylogenetic tree construction.|journal=Bioinformatics|date=Nov 1, 2003|volume=19|issue=16|pages=2122‚Äì30|pmid=14594718|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btg295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Context modeling compression ====

In the context modeling complexity the next-symbol predictions, of one or more statistical models, are combined or competing to yield a prediction that is based on events recorded in the past. The algorithmic information content derived from each symbol prediction can be used to compute algorithmic information profiles with a time proportional to the length of the sequence. The process has been applied to DNA sequence analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pinho|first=A|author2=Garcia, S|author3=Pratas, D|author4=Ferreira, P|title=DNA Sequences at a Glance.|journal=PLOS ONE|date=Nov 21, 2013|volume=8|issue=11|pages=e79922|pmid=24278218|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0079922|pmc=3836782|bibcode=2013PLoSO...879922P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods based on graphical representation ===

==== Iterated maps ====
The use of iterated maps for sequence analysis was first introduced by HJ Jefferey in 1990&lt;ref name="Jeffrey 2163‚Äì70"/&gt; when he proposed to apply the [[Chaos game|Chaos Game]] to map genomic sequences into a unit square. That report coined the procedure as Chaos Game Representation (CGR). However, only 3 years later this approach was first dismissed as a projection of a Markov transition table by N Goldman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldman|first=N|title=Nucleotide, dinucleotide and trinucleotide frequencies explain patterns observed in chaos game representations of DNA sequences.|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=May 25, 1993|volume=21|issue=10|pages=2487‚Äì91|pmid=8506142|doi=10.1093/nar/21.10.2487|pmc=309551}}&lt;/ref&gt; This objection was overruled by the end of that decade when the opposite was found to be the case ‚Äì that CGR bijectively maps Markov transition is into a fractal, order-free (degree-free) representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Almeida|first=JS|author2=Carri√ßo, JA|author3= Maretzek, A|author4= Noble, PA|author5= Fletcher, M|title=Analysis of genomic sequences by Chaos Game Representation.|journal=Bioinformatics|date=May 2001|volume=17|issue=5|pages=429‚Äì37|pmid=11331237|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/17.5.429}}&lt;/ref&gt; The realization that iterated maps provide a bijective map between the symbolic space and numeric space led to the identification of a variety of alignment-free approaches to sequence comparison and characterization. These developments were reviewed in late 2013 by JS Almeida in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Almeida|first=JS|title=Sequence analysis by iterated maps, a review.|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|date=Oct 25, 2013|pmid=24162172|doi=10.1093/bib/bbt072|volume=15|issue=3|pages=369‚Äì375|pmc=4017330}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of web apps such as https://usm.github.com,&lt;ref name="Almeida 12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Almeida|first=Jonas S.|last2=Gr√ºneberg|first2=Alexander|last3=Maass|first3=Wolfgang|last4=Vinga|first4=Susana|date=2012-05-02|title=Fractal MapReduce decomposition of sequence alignment|journal=Algorithms for Molecular Biology: AMB|volume=7|issue=1|pages=12|doi=10.1186/1748-7188-7-12|issn=1748-7188|pmc=3394223|pmid=22551205}}&lt;/ref&gt; are available to demonstrate how to encode and compare arbitrary symbolic sequences in a manner that takes full advantage of modern [[MapReduce]] distribution developed for cloud computing.

The '''Automated Planet Finder Telescope''' ('''APF''') a.k.a. '''Rocky Planet Finder''',&lt;ref name="UCO 2015"/&gt; is a fully [[robotic telescope|robotic]] 2.4-meter optical telescope at [[Lick Observatory]], situated on the summit of Mount Hamilton, east of San Jose, California, USA.&lt;ref name="arxiv.org"&gt;Steven S. Vogt et al., ''[https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6684 APF - The Lick Observatory Automated Planet Finder]'', 26 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It is designed to search for [[extrasolar planets]] in the range of five to twenty times the mass of the [[Earth]]. The instrument will examine about 10 stars per night. Over the span of a decade, the telescope is expected to study 1,000 nearby stars for planets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=1537 Major gift supports crucial piece of Automated Planet Finder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613013718/http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=1537 |date=2008-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its estimated cost was $10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Automated-Planet-Finder-telescope-seeks-life-3177056.php |title=Automated Planet Finder telescope seeks life |first=David |last=Perlman |date=August 21, 2010 |work=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total cost-to-completion of the APF project was $12.37 million.&lt;ref name="arxiv.org"/&gt; First light was originally scheduled for 2006, but delays in the construction of the major components of the telescope&lt;ref&gt;[http://ucodirector.blogspot.com/2009/10/uco-newsletter-6-october-2009.html UCO Director Newsletters: Newsletter #6 October 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; pushed this back to August 2013.&lt;ref name="UCO 2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucolick.org/public/telescopes/apf.html |title=Telescopes of the Lick Observatory |work=University of California Observatories |date=2015 |accessdate=2016-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was commissioned in August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucolick.org/public/telescopes/apf.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The telescope uses high-precision [[radial velocity]] measurements to measure the gravitational reflex motion of nearby stars caused by the orbiting of planets. The design goal is to detect stellar motions as small as one meter per second, comparable to a slow walking speed. The main targets will be stars within about 100 light years of the Earth.&lt;ref name="UCO 2015"/&gt;

Early tests show that the performance of the [[Ken and Gloria Levy Doppler Spectrometer]] is meeting the design goals.  The spectrometer has high throughput and is meeting the design sensitivity of (1.0&amp;nbsp;m/s),&lt;ref name="UCO 2015"/&gt; similar to the radial velocity precision of [[HARPS]] and [[W. M. Keck Observatory#Instruments|HIRES]].

==Construction==
Parts for the telescopes were constructed by international companies:&lt;ref name="UCO 2015"/&gt;
*The mirror blank was cast in Russia.
*The blank was optical figured in Maryland, USA.
*Assembly was performed in Arizona, USA.
*The dome was built in Australia.
*The [[spectrograph]] was designed and built in [[California]].
*It is located on [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mount Hamilton]] in California.

== Collaboration with Breakthrough Listen ==
The telescope will also be used to search for optical signals coming from [[laser]] transmissions from hypothetical extraterrestrial civilizations ([[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] - SETI). This undertaking is for the heavily funded [[Breakthrough Listen]] to the [[Berkeley SETI Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/07/russian-tycoon-spending-100-million-hunt-aliens/ |title=A Russian Tycoon Is Spending $100 Million to Hunt for Aliens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Launch Complex 14''' (LC-14) is a [[List of Merritt Island launch sites|launch site]] at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] in [[Florida]].  LC-14 was used for various manned and unmanned [[Atlas (rocket family)|Atlas]] launches, including the ''[[Friendship 7]]'' flight aboard which [[John Glenn]] became the first American to orbit the Earth.

==History==
LC-14 was the first Atlas pad in operation and hosted the initial test flights in 1957‚Äì58. It was also the only one of the original four Atlas pads to never have a booster explode on it. By 1959, it was decided to convert the pad for the Atlas D missile and space launches, and a large service tower was added early in the year. The first Atlas flown from the renovated LC-14 was Missile 7D on May 18, however a problem with the launcher hold-down arms damaged the missile and caused its explosion shortly after launch. This was traced to improper procedures during the renovation of the pad and was quickly fixed. The first space launch off of LC-14 was the [[Big Joe (Project Mercury)|Big Joe]] Mercury test in September. As the designated Mercury-Atlas facility, LC-14 was thus the only Atlas pad sporting the infrastructure needed for manned launches. The first MIDAS satellites, one Atlas-Able launch, and a few more ICBM tests were conducted from LC-14 before it was completely turned over to NASA.

LC-14 is most well known as the launch site for [[NASA]]'s [[Mercury-Atlas 6]] flight, which made Glenn the first American in orbit. It was also the launch site of the remaining three [[Project Mercury|Mercury-Atlas]] flights and various unmanned Atlas launches. Later, it was the site for [[Atlas-Agena]] launches for the [[Agena Target Vehicle]]s for [[Project Gemini]].

Following decommissioning and abandonment as an active launch site, LC-14 slowly fell into decay. The proximity to the Atlantic Ocean created an ideal environment for corrosion of metal components, and the complex's red metal gantry structures were dismantled for safety purposes in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Hennig, Katy (July 5, 2014) [http://www.lidarnews.com/content/view/10806/198/ "Historic Documentation: Documenting Cape Canaveral"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813004047/http://www.lidarnews.com/content/view/10806/198/ |date=August 13, 2014 }} ''LiDAR News'' Spatial Media LLC, Frederick, MD&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
In 1997, the [[45th Space Wing]] embarked on a partial restoration of LC-14 under the aegis of the 45th Operations Support Squadron and its commander, Lt Col Dennis Hilley, USAF. Although extensive repairs were made by [[Boeing]] and [[Johnson Controls]], with additional assistance from [[Lockheed Martin]] and [[KBR (company)|Brown and Root]], the restoration utilized no military construction or military operations and maintenance funding and was effected strictly with military, DoD civilian, NASA civilian, DoD contractor and NASA contractor volunteers.  Several months later, the exterior and interior of the original blockhouse and its nearby astronaut parking area had been restored, with the blockhouse converted into a conference facility for military, NASA and contractor use.

Present at the dedication in May 1998 were former Mercury astronauts Colonel [[Gordon Cooper]], USAF (Ret.) and Commander [[Scott Carpenter]], USN (Ret.); Mrs. Betty Grissom, widow of Lt Col [[Gus Grissom]], USAF; and comedian [[Bill Dana]], known for his "[[Jos√© Jim√©nez (character)|Jos√© Jim√©nez]], the reluctant astronaut" character.  The character caught on among the seven Mercury astronauts. Among other Mercury astronauts, former U.S. Senator (and Colonel, USMC (Ret.)) [[John Glenn]] could not attend due to preparations for his then-pending [[Space Shuttle]] flight ([[STS-95]]), and Captain [[Wally Schirra]], USN (Ret.) could not attend due to a scheduling conflict. [[Deke Slayton]] had died in 1993, while Rear Admiral [[Alan Shepard]], USN (Ret.) extended his regrets due to illness.  Largely unknown at the time was that Shepard was suffering from terminal leukemia, and he died shortly after the dedication.

In addition to the total interior renovation, the blockhouse contains historical documents, photos and memorabilia from Project Mercury, as well as photos of the blockhouse area before, during and after the restoration. Future improvements to the pad itself are also planned as time and contributory funding permits.

The entrance road to LC-14 is marked by several memorials and signs commemorating Project Mercury and the four of six manned Mercury missions launched there. This includes a large sculpture of the Project Mercury symbol constructed of titanium, under which is buried a time capsule containing technical documents of the Mercury program. The time capsule is scheduled to be opened in 2464, 500 years after the official conclusion of the program.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMH6RF_Mercury_7_Time_Capsule_Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station&lt;/ref&gt;  With its withdrawal from operational status, a memorial marker in granite was also placed at the beginning of the concrete ramp that leads to LC-14's launch pad and two outdoor kiosks were erected to contain historical photos.

'''Caramelization''' is the [[Browning (food process)|browning]] of [[sugar]], a process used extensively in cooking for the resulting sweet nutty flavor and brown color. The brown colours are produced by three groups of polymers: [[caramelans]] (C&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;), [[caramelens]] (C&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[caramelins]] (C&lt;sub&gt;125&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;188&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;). As the process occurs, [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] chemicals such as [[diacetyl]] are released, producing the characteristic [[caramel]] flavor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food Chemistry: A Laboratory Manual|last=Miller|first=Dennis|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|year=1998|isbn=978-0471175438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the [[Maillard reaction]], caramelization is a type of [[non-enzymatic browning]]. However, unlike the [[Maillard reaction]], caramelization is [[pyrolysis| pyrolytic]], as opposed to being a reaction with [[amino acid]]s.

When caramelization involves the [[disaccharide]] [[sucrose]], it is broken down into the [[monosaccharides]] [[fructose]] and [[glucose]].

==Process==
Caramelization is a complex, poorly understood process that produces hundreds of chemical products, and includes the following types of reaction:
* [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibration]] of [[anomeric]] and ring forms
* [[sucrose inversion]] to fructose and glucose
* [[condensation reaction]]s
* intramolecular bonding
* [[isomerization]] of [[aldose]]s to [[ketose]]s
* [[dehydration reaction]]s
* fragmentation reactions
* unsaturated [[polymer]] formation.

==Effects on caramelization==
The process is temperature-dependent. Specific sugars each have their own point at which the reactions begin to proceed readily. Impurities in the sugar, such as the [[molasses]] remaining in [[brown sugar]], greatly speed the reactions.

The caramelization reactions are also sensitive to the chemical environment. By controlling the level of acidity ([[pH]]), the reaction rate (or the temperature at which the reaction occurs readily) can be altered. The rate of caramelization is generally lowest at near-neutral acidity (pH around 7), and accelerated under both acidic (especially pH below 3) and basic (especially pH above 9) conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Food biochemistry and food processing |editor1=Hui, Y.

==Uses in food==
Caramelization is used to produce several foods, including:

* [[Caramel sauce]], a sauce made with caramel
* ''[[Confiture de lait]]'', caramelized, sweetened milk
* ''[[Dulce de leche]]'', caramelized, sweetened milk
* [[Caramel]] candies
* Caramelized onions, which are used in dishes like [[French onion soup]]. Onions require 30 to 45 minutes of cooking to caramelize.&lt;ref&gt;Scocca, Tom.

* Caramelized potatoes
* Caramelized pears&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stemilt.com/stem-blog/caramelizing-pears-tips/|title=Caramelizing Pears {{!}} Stemilt|date=2016-10-10|newspaper=Stemilt|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cola]], of which some brands use caramelised sugar in small amounts for colour

Note that the preparation of many "caramelized" foods also involves the [[Maillard reaction]]; particularly recipes involving protein and/or amino acid -rich ingredients.

==Building==

The Copernicus Science Centre building has been erected on the bank of the [[Vistula River]] in the very heart of [[Warsaw]] (the corner of Wybrze≈ºe Ko≈õciuszkowskie and Zajƒôcza streets, above the Wis≈Çostrada tunnel). The building design was developed by young Polish architects from the firm RAr-2 in Ruda ≈ölƒÖska, who won an architectural competition for the Copernicus Science Centre facility in December 2005, with engineers [[Buro Happold]].

The Centre complex comprises: 
* a two-storey building with total floor-space of 15,000 square metres housing permanent and temporary exhibitions, laboratories and workshops, a conference centre, cafes and restaurants, plus office space and a distinctive rooftop garden
* a garage and a workshop on a subterranean level
* a multimedia planetarium housed within an intriguing boulder-shaped building, including an observation deck
* a surrounding Discovery Park, including open-air experimentation stations, an outdoor art gallery, and an amphitheatre.

==Permanent Exhibition==

Permanent Exhibition in the Copernicus Science Centre consists of over 400 interactive exhibits. The exhibition is divided into six sections concerning various fields of knowledge:

* On the Move
* Humans and the Environment
* Buzzz! - gallery for preschool children
* Lightzone
* Roots of Civilization
* RE: generation - gallery for young adults

==Planetarium The Heavens of Copernicus==

The Heavens of Copernicus is a modern planetarium where you can see more than just images of the starry sky and related films. The shows concern a variety of popular science issues, including from the field of astronomy, natural science and ethnography.

The shows are displayed on a spherical screen surrounding the audience on all sides. Thanks to this solution, the audience experiences a feeling of immersion in the displayed world, which is strengthened by the high quality sound system deployed around the dome.

==The ''Experiment!'' Exhibition and other activities of the Centre==
''Experiment!'' is the first exhibition to be organized by the Copernicus Science Centre. It made its premiere appearance at the [[Warsaw]] [[Science Picnic]] in June 2006, where more than 10,000 individuals visited it in a single day. Since September 2006, it has been traveling around large cities and small towns to give their residents an opportunity to try out the hands-on experiments on their own.

The Copernicus Science Centre also organizes ''Family Workshops'', where children (5‚Äì8 years old) together with their parents or carers can carry out experiments to help them better understand everyday phenomena (e.g. ''where does the current in electrical outlets come from, how does a TV set work or why does yeast make dough rise''). The children can easily repeat the experiments themselves at home.

The Centre takes part in various events popularizing science: the ''Summer'' and ''Winter in the City'' events, ''Science Festivals'' and the ''Summer with Radio'' event. For teachers, the Copernicus Science Centre organizes trainings and competitions.

==Form of organization==
The Copernicus Science Centre is a cultural institution established and financed by the [[City of Warsaw]], the [[Ministry of Science and Higher Education (Poland)|Minister of Science and Higher Education]], and the [[Ministry of National Education (Poland)|Minister of National Education]].

'''Differential scanning calorimetry''', or '''DSC''', is a [[thermal analysis|thermoanalytical]] technique in which the difference in the amount of [[heat]] required to increase the [[temperature]] of a sample and reference is measured as a function of temperature. Both the sample and reference are maintained at nearly the same temperature throughout the experiment. Generally, the temperature program for a DSC analysis is designed such that the sample holder temperature increases linearly as a function of time. The reference sample should have a well-defined [[heat capacity]] over the range of temperatures to be scanned.

The technique was developed by E. S. Watson and M. J. O'Neill in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|3263484}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced commercially at the 1963 [[Pittsburgh Conference on Analytical Chemistry and Applied Spectroscopy]]. The first [[adiabatic]] differential scanning calorimeter that could be used in biochemistry was developed by P. L. Privalov and D. R. Monaselidze in 1964 at Institute of Physics in Tbilisi, Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1975|title=Molecular biology|volume=6|place=Moscow |pages=7‚Äì33 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term DSC was coined to describe this instrument, which measures energy directly and allows precise measurements of heat capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Wunderlich B |year=1990|title=Thermal Analysis|place=New York|publisher=Academic Press|pages=137‚Äì140|isbn=0-12-765605-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of DSC:
* ''Power-compensated DSC'', keeps power supply constant
* ''Heat-flux DSC'', keeps heat flux constant

==Detection of phase transitions==
The basic principle underlying this technique is that when the sample undergoes a physical transformation such as [[phase transition]]s, more or less heat will need to flow to it than the reference to maintain both at the same temperature. Whether less or more heat must flow to the sample depends on whether the process is [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]] or [[endothermic reaction|endothermic]]. For example, as a solid sample [[melting|melts]] to a liquid, it will require more heat flowing to the sample to increase its temperature at the same rate as the reference. This is due to the absorption of heat by the sample as it undergoes the endothermic [[phase transition]] from solid to liquid. Likewise, as the sample undergoes exothermic processes (such as [[crystallization]]) less heat is required to raise the sample temperature. By observing the difference in heat flow between the sample and reference, differential scanning [[calorimeter]]s are able to measure the amount of heat absorbed or released during such transitions. DSC may also be used to observe more subtle physical changes, such as [[glass transition]]s. It is widely used in industrial settings as a quality control instrument due to its applicability in evaluating sample purity and for studying polymer curing.&lt;ref name=Dean&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Dean JA |title=The Analytical Chemistry Handbook|place=New York|publisher=McGraw Hill, Inc.|year=1995|pages=15.1‚Äì15.5|isbn=0-07-016197-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pugnor&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Pungor E |title=A Practical Guide to Instrumental Analysis|publisher=Boca Raton|place=Florida|year=1995|pages=181‚Äì191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Skoog&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Skoog DA, Holler FJ, Nieman T |title=Principles of Instrumental Analysis |edition=5th |place=New York |year=1998 |pages=805‚Äì808 |isbn=0-03-002078-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DTA==
An alternative technique, which shares much in common with DSC, is [[differential thermal analysis]] (DTA). In this technique it is the heat flow to the sample and reference that remains the same rather than the temperature. When the sample and reference are heated identically, phase changes and other thermal processes cause a difference in temperature between the sample and reference. Both DSC and DTA provide similar information. DSC measures the energy required to keep both the reference and the sample at the same temperature whereas DTA measures the difference in temperature between the sample and the reference when the same amount of energy has been introduced into both.

==DSC curves==
[[Image:CalibratingDSCcurve.png|frame|Top: A schematic DSC curve of amount of energy input (y) required to maintain each temperature (x), scanned across a range of temperatures. Bottom: Normalized curves setting the initial heat capacity as the reference. Buffer-buffer baseline (dashed) and protein-buffer variance (solid).]]
[[Image:2and3stDSCcurves.png|frame|Normalized DSC curves using the baseline as the reference (left), and fractions of each conformational state (y) existing at each temperature (right), for two-state (top), and three-state (bottom) proteins. Note the minuscule broadening in the peak of the three-state protein's DSC curve, which may or may not appear statistically significant to the naked eye.]]

The result of a DSC experiment is a curve of heat flux versus temperature or versus time. There are two different conventions: exothermic reactions in the sample shown with a positive or negative peak, depending on the kind of technology used in the experiment. This curve can be used to calculate [[enthalpy|enthalpies of transitions]]. This is done by integrating the peak corresponding to a given transition. It can be shown that the enthalpy of transition can be expressed using the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta H = K A&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta H&lt;/math&gt; is the enthalpy of transition, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the calorimetric constant, and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the area under the curve. The calorimetric constant will vary from instrument to instrument, and can be determined by analyzing a well-characterized sample with known enthalpies of transition.&lt;ref name=Pugnor/&gt;

==Applications==
Differential scanning calorimetry can be used to measure a number of characteristic properties of a sample. Using this technique it is possible to observe [[melting point|fusion]] and [[crystal]]lization events as well as [[glass transition]] temperatures ''T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''. DSC can also be used to study [[oxidation]], as well as other chemical reactions.&lt;ref name=Dean/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pugnor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = O'Neill MJ | title=The Analysis of a Temperature-Controlled Scanning Calorimeter|journal=Anal. Chem.|year=1964|volume=36|pages=1238‚Äì1245|doi=10.1021/ac60213a020|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glass transition]]s may occur as the temperature of an [[amorphous]] solid is increased. These transitions appear as a step in the baseline of the recorded DSC signal. This is due to the sample undergoing a [[Kauzmann paradox|change in heat capacity]]; no formal phase change occurs.&lt;ref name=Dean/&gt;&lt;ref name=Skoog/&gt;

As the temperature increases, an amorphous solid will become less [[viscosity|viscous]]. At some point the molecules may obtain enough freedom of motion to spontaneously arrange themselves into a crystalline form. This is known as the [[crystallization|crystallization temperature]] (''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''). This transition from amorphous solid to crystalline solid is an exothermic process, and results in a peak in the DSC signal. As the temperature increases the sample eventually reaches its melting temperature (''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''). The melting process results in an endothermic peak in the DSC curve. The ability to determine [[transition temperature]]s and [[enthalpy|enthalpies]] makes DSC a valuable tool in producing [[phase diagram]]s for various chemical systems.&lt;ref name=Dean/&gt;

Differential scanning calorimetry can also be used  to obtain valuable thermodynamics information about proteins. The thermodynamics analysis of proteins can reveal important information about the global structure of proteins, and protein/ligand interaction. For example, many mutations lower the stability of proteins, while ligand binding usually increases protein stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sch√∂n A, Brown RK, Hutchins BM, Freire E | title = Ligand binding analysis and screening by chemical denaturation shift | journal = Analytical Biochemistry | volume = 443 | issue = 1 | pages = 52‚Äì7 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23994566 | pmc = 3809086 | doi = 10.1016/j.ab.2013.08.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using DSC, this stability can be measured by obtaining [[Gibbs free energy|Gibbs Free Energy]] values at any given temperature. This allows researchers to compare the free energy of unfolding between ligand-free protein and protein-ligand complex, or wild type and mutant proteins. DSC can also be used in studying protein/lipid interactions, nucleotides, drug-lipid interactions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chiu MH, Prenner EJ | title = Differential scanning calorimetry: An invaluable tool for a detailed thermodynamic characterization of macromolecules and their interactions | journal = Journal of Pharmacy &amp; Bioallied Sciences | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 39‚Äì59 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21430954 | pmc = 3053520 | doi = 10.4103/0975-7406.76463 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In studying protein denaturation using DSC, the thermal melt should be at least to some degree reversible, as the thermodynamics calculations rely on chemical equlibreum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Examples==
The technique is widely used across a range of applications, both as a routine quality test and as a research tool. The equipment is easy to calibrate, using low melting [[indium]] at 156.5985 ¬∞C for example, and is a rapid and reliable method of thermal analysis.

===Polymers===
DSC is used widely for examining [[polymer]]ic materials to determine their thermal transitions.  The observed thermal transitions can be utilized to compare materials, although the transitions do not uniquely identify composition. The composition of unknown materials may be completed using complementary techniques such as IR spectroscopy.  [[Melting point]]s and [[glass transition temperature]]s for most [[polymer]]s are available from standard compilations, and the method can show [[polymer degradation]] by the lowering of the expected melting point, ''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'', for example. ''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' depends on the [[molecular weight]] of the polymer and thermal history, so lower grades may have lower melting points than expected. The percent crystalline content of a polymer can be estimated from the crystallization/melting peaks of the DSC graph as reference heats of fusion can be found in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | vauthors = Wunderlich B | title = Macromolecular Physics | year = 1980 | volume =  3 | chapter = Chapter 8, Table VIII.6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DSC can also be used to study thermal degradation of polymers using an approach such as Oxidative Onset Temperature/Time (OOT), however, the user risks contamination of the DSC cell, which can be problematic.  [[Thermogravimetric Analysis]] (TGA) may be more useful for decomposition behavior determination.  Impurities in polymers can be determined by examining thermograms for anomalous peaks, and [[plasticiser]]s can be detected at their characteristic boiling points.  In addition, examination of minor events in first heat thermal analysis data can be useful as these apparently "anomalous peaks" can in fact also be representative of process or storage thermal history of the material or polymer physical aging. Comparison of first and second heat data collected at consistent heating rates can allow the analyst to learn about both polymer processing history and material properties.

===Liquid crystals===
DSC is used in the study of [[liquid crystal]]s. As some forms of matter go from solid to liquid they go through a third state, which displays properties of both phases. This [[anisotropic]] liquid is known as a liquid crystalline or mesomorphous state. Using DSC, it is possible to observe the small energy changes that occur as matter transitions from a solid to a liquid crystal and from a liquid crystal to an [[isotropic]] liquid.&lt;ref name=Pugnor/&gt;

===Oxidative stability===
Using differential scanning calorimetry to study the stability to [[oxidation]] of samples generally requires an airtight sample chamber. Usually, such tests are done isothermally (at constant temperature) by changing the atmosphere of the sample. First, the sample is brought to the desired test temperature under an inert atmosphere, usually [[nitrogen]]. Then, oxygen is added to the system. Any oxidation that occurs is observed as a deviation in the baseline. Such analysis can be used to determine the stability and optimum storage conditions for a material or compound.&lt;ref name=Dean/&gt;

===Safety screening===
DSC makes a reasonable initial safety screening tool. In this mode the sample will be housed in a non-reactive crucible (often [[gold]] or gold-plated steel), and which will be able to withstand [[pressure]] (typically up to 100 [[bar (unit)|bar]]). The presence of an [[exothermic]] event can then be used to assess the [[chemical stability|stability]] of a substance to heat. However, due to a combination of relatively poor sensitivity, slower than normal scan rates (typically 2‚Äì3 ¬∞C/min, due to much heavier crucible) and unknown [[activation energy]], it is necessary to deduct about 75‚Äì100 ¬∞C from the initial start of the observed exotherm to ''suggest'' a maximal temperature for the material. A much more accurate data set can be obtained from an [[Calorimeter#Adiabatic calorimeters|adiabatic calorimeter]], but such a test may take 2‚Äì3 days from [[Ambient temperature|ambient]] at a rate of a 3 ¬∞C increment per half-hour.

===Drug analysis===
DSC is widely used in the [[pharmaceutical]] and [[polymer]] industries. For the polymer chemist, DSC is a handy tool for studying [[curing (chemistry)|curing]] processes, which allows the fine tuning of polymer properties. The [[cross-link]]ing of polymer molecules that occurs in the curing process is exothermic, resulting in a negative peak in the DSC curve that usually appears soon after the glass transition.&lt;ref name=Dean/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pugnor/&gt;&lt;ref name=Skoog/&gt;

In the pharmaceutical industry it is necessary to have well-characterized [[Medication|drug]] compounds in order to define processing parameters. For instance, if it is necessary to deliver a drug in the amorphous form, it is desirable to process the drug at temperatures below those at which crystallization can occur.&lt;ref name=Pugnor/&gt;

===General chemical analysis===
[[Freezing-point depression]] can be used as a '''purity analysis''' tool when analysed by differential scanning calorimetry. This is possible because the temperature range over which a mixture of compounds melts is dependent on their relative amounts. Consequently, less pure compounds will exhibit a broadened melting peak that begins at lower temperature than a pure compound.&lt;ref name=Pugnor/&gt;&lt;ref name=Skoog/&gt;

[[Image:Commander Donald Baxter MacMillan at White House 30 mar 1925.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Commander MacMillan at [[The White House]], 1925]]
'''Donald Baxter MacMillan''' (November 10, 1874 &amp;ndash; September 7, 1970) was an [[Americans|American]] explorer, sailor, researcher and lecturer who made over 30 expeditions to the [[Arctic]] during his 46-year career. He pioneered the use of radios, airplanes, and electricity in the Arctic, brought back films and thousands of photographs of Arctic scenes, and put together a dictionary of the [[Inuktitut]] language.

==Early life==
Born in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown]], [[Massachusetts]] in 1874, MacMillan lived in [[Freeport, Maine|Freeport]], [[Maine]] after the deaths of both his parents in 1883 (his father died while captaining a Grand Banks fishing schooner) and 1886 (his mother died suddenly), and was educated at [[Bowdoin College]] in [[Brunswick, Maine|Brunswick]], graduating in 1898 with a degree in geology. He later taught at [[Worcester Academy]] from 1903 to 1908.

==Personal life==
On March 18, 1935, MacMillan married Miriam Norton Look, the daughter of his long-time friends Jerome and Amy Look. Though MacMillan at first refused to let her accompany him north, Miriam soon convinced him of her willingness and ability to participate in his Arctic travels.&lt;ref&gt;Bowdoin College. Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum. https://www.bowdoin.edu/arctic-museum/biographies/macmillan.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; She participated in several of his scientific and exploration trips to the Arctic and elsewhere.

==Arctic explorations==
[[Image:Donald macmillan on ship bowdoin 1922.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Donald MacMillan in fur suit at wheel of ship ''Bowdoin'' c. 1922]]
After five years as a high school teacher, MacMillan caught the attention of explorer and fellow Bowdoin graduate [[Robert E. Peary]] when he saved the lives of nine shipwrecked people in two nights.&lt;ref name="trueadventure"&gt;{{cite book |last=West |first=James E. |authorlink=James E. West (Scouting) |coauthors= |title=The Boy Scouts Book of True Adventure |year=1931 |publisher=Putnam  |location=New York  |oclc=8484128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peary subsequently invited MacMillan to join his 1908 journey to the [[North Pole]]. Although MacMillan himself had to turn back at 84¬∞29' on March 14 because of frozen heels, Peary allegedly reached the Pole 26 days later.

MacMillan spent the next few years traveling in [[Labrador]], carrying out ethnological studies among the [[Innu]] and [[Inuit]]. He organized and commanded the ill-fated [[Crocker Land Expedition]] to northern [[Greenland]] in 1913. Unfortunately [[Crocker Land]] turned out to be a [[mirage]]. The expedition members were stranded until 1917, when Captain [[Robert Bartlett (explorer)|Robert A. Bartlett]] of the ship ''Neptune'' finally rescued them. Journals from the expedition by [[Maurice Cole Tanquary|Maurice C. Tanquary]], [[Walter Elmer Ekblaw|Walter E. Ekblaw]], Donald B. and Miriam MacMillan are available online at the [https://library.bowdoin.edu/arch/index.shtml George J. Mitchell Department of Special Collections &amp; Archives] website. Digitization of materials at Bowdoin College related to the Crocker Land Expedition was generously funded by the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.bowdoin.edu/arch/index.shtml|title=George J. Mitchell Department of Special Collections &amp; Archives (Bowdoin Library - George J. Mitchell Department of Special Collections &amp; Archives)|website=library.bowdoin.edu|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the armistice which ended the First World War, MacMillan was commissioned an ensign in the [[Naval Reserve Flying Corps]] on 24 December 1918.  (MacMillan was 44 years old at the time, making him one of the oldest ensigns in the history of the U.S. Navy.)  After the war, MacMillan began raising money for another Arctic expedition. In 1921, the [[schooner]] ''[[Bowdoin (Arctic schooner)|Bowdoin]]''‚Äînamed for [[Bowdoin College|MacMillan's alma mater]]‚Äîwas launched from East [[Boothbay, Maine]] and set sail for [[Baffin Island]], where MacMillan and his crew spent the winter.  The expedition was notable for taking along an [[amateur radio]] operator, Don Mix, who used station WNP ("Wireless North Pole") to keep them in contact with the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;John Dilks, ''Wireless North Pole Christmas'', ''QST'', December 2008, pp. 94-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923 there was concern about a new ice age and he sailed toward the [[North Pole]] aboard the [[schooner]] ''[[Bowdoin (Arctic schooner)|Bowdoin]]'', sponsored by the [[National Geographical Society]] to look for evidence of advancing glaciers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |agency= |title=MacMillan Sails North.

Byrd]] who would rise to international fame three years later when he and [[Floyd Bennett]] became the first men to fly over the North Pole.

In 1925 MacMillan was commissioned as a lieutenant commander in the United States Naval Reserve Force.  Thereafter, he was frequently referred to as "Commander MacMillan".

In September 1926 MacMillan led a group of explorers which included three women and five scientists to [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]]. The team spent several months beforehand collecting flora and fauna in [[Labrador]] and [[Greenland]]. He believed it was possible that the ancient ruins off Sculpin Island, twenty miles from Nain, Labrador, are the remains of a [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlement 1,000 years old. On the side bordering the mainland MacMillan found what he considered the vestiges of ten or twelve houses. He estimated the age of the dwellings to be hundreds of years old according to the lichens which partially covered their foundations. However MacMillan could not say for certain if these had been built by [[Vikings]]. According to [[Inuit]] tradition the "stone igloos" were constructed by men who came from the sea in ships. Inuit called the site ''Tunitvik'', meaning ''the place of the Norseman''. MacMillan said the strongest argument that the Sculpin dwellings were of Viking origin was their resemblance to those he found in Greenland the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=MacMillan Finds Old Norse Ruins |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1926/09/05/archives/macmillan-finds-old-norse-ruins-thinks-relics-of-settlement-off.html |quote=Thinks Relics of Settlement Off Labrador Perhaps 1,000 Years Old.

==World War II==
MacMillan was placed on the Naval Reserve Honorary Retired List with the rank of lieutenant commander on his 64th birthday in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Register of Commissioned Officers of the U.S. Naval Reserve.  July 1, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite being past retirement age, he volunteered for active duty with the Navy during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]].   On May 22, 1941, he transferred the ''Bowdoin'' to the Navy for the duration of the war and served as her initial commanding officer before being transferred to the [[Hydrographic office#United States|Hydrographic Office]] in [[Washington, DC]].   He was promoted to the rank of commander on 13 June 1942.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Naval Reserve Register. 1 July 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

After the war, MacMillan continued his trips to the Arctic, taking researchers north and carrying supplies for the MacMillan-Moravian School he established in 1929.   On June 25, 1954 MacMillan was promoted, by a special act of Congress, to rank of rear admiral on the Naval Reserve retired list in honor of his lifetime of service and achievement.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times''.  June 25, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

Admiral MacMillan made his final trip to the Arctic in 1957 at age 82, and died in 1970 at the age of 95.  He is buried in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], where a main wharf is named after him.

==Honors==
In 1927, the [[Boy Scouts of America]] made MacMillan an ''Honorary Scout'', a new category of Scout created that same year.  This distinction was given to "American citizens whose achievements in outdoor activity, exploration and worthwhile adventure are of such an exceptional character as to capture the imagination of boys...".  The other eighteen who were awarded this distinction were: [[Roy Chapman Andrews]]; [[Robert Bartlett (explorer)|Robert Bartlett]]; [[Frederick Russell Burnham]]; [[Richard E. Byrd]]; [[George Kruck Cherrie]]; James L. Clark; [[Merian C. Cooper]]; [[Lincoln Ellsworth]]; [[Louis Agassiz Fuertes]]; [[George Bird Grinnell]]; [[Charles A. Lindbergh]]; Clifford H.

'''''Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures''''' is an [[encyclopedia]] edited by [[Helaine Selin]] and published by [[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] in 1997, with a second edition in  2008, and third edition in 2016.

==Summary==
From the Preface:
:The purpose of the ''Encyclopaedia'' is to bring together knowledge of many disparate fields in one place to legitimize the study of other cultures' science... The Western academic divisions of science, technology and medicine have been united in the ''Encyclopaedia'' because in ancient cultures these disciplines were connected.
The first edition (1997) has 600 articles by a range of experts. The arrangement is alphabetical from "Abacus" to "Zu Chongzi". It includes an index from page 1079 to page 1117. [[K. V. Sarma]] contributed 35 articles, Greg De Young 13, Boris A. Rosenfeld 12, and Emilia Calvo and Ho Peng Yoke 11 each. [[Fabrizio Pregadio]] contributed 10 articles, Julio Samo wrote 9, and Richard Bertschinger, [[Radha Charan Gupta]] and [[David A. King (historian)|David A. King]] wrote 8 each. Dozens of other contributors wrote fewer articles.

In 2008 the ''Encyclopaedia'' was split into two volumes and extended to 1000 articles for a second edition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/philosophy/epistemology+and+philosophy+of+science/book/978-1-4020-4559-2 Springer]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
* Toby E. Huff (1999) Review: EHSTMNC, [[Isis (journal)|Isis]] 90(2):410,1 {{doi|10.1086/284409}}
: "A splendid piece of joint scholarship, and some would say long overdue."
: Huff counts nine entries on maps and map making, five on geometry, eleven on environment, four on city planning, five on east-west issues, six on colonialism, six on textile technology, ten on weights and measures
* Jensine Andresen (1999) Review: EHSTMNC, [[Zygon (journal)|Zygon]] {{doi|10.1111/0591-2385.00218}}
: Dispels the illusion that "members of non-Western cultures have offered only marginal contributions to the rigorous investigation of the natural world".
: "Catalyzes a thorough reconsideration of the scope of the ideational nexus influencing the interaction between religion and science in the West."
: Andresen characterizes the contributors an "iconoclastic bunch".
* Sujit Sivasundaram (2010) Review: EHSTMNC second edition, [[The British Journal for the History of Science]] {{doi|10.1017/S000708741000049X}}
: "Turning points in the European historical narrative are being contextualized within other senses of chronology and space, and so decentralized from their mythic status as events in the birth of modern science."
: The second edition shifts "from advocacy to analysis". The reviewer considers the term ''Non-Western'' to be outdated, particularly as [[ethnobotany]] regions proliferate, and Europe is excluded except as the colonizer.

'''Engineering education''' is the activity of [[teaching]] knowledge and principles to the professional practice of [[engineering]]. It includes an initial education ([[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] and/or [[master's degree]]), and any advanced education and specializations that follow. Engineering education is typically accompanied by additional postgraduate examinations and supervised training as the requirements for a professional engineering license. The length of education, and training to qualify as a basic professional engineer, is typically 8‚Äì12 years, with 15‚Äì20 years for an engineer who takes responsibility for major projects.

Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education in primary and secondary schools often serves as the foundation for engineering education at the university level.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Iverson &amp; Kalyandurg, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], engineering education is a part of the [[STEM fields|STEM initiative]] in public schools. [[Service-learning in engineering education]] is gaining popularity within the variety of disciplinary focuses within engineering education including [[chemical engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[industrial engineering]], [[computer engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], and other engineering education.

==Africa==University of Port Harcourt (uniport) River State Nigeria:
===Kenya===
Engineering training in [[Kenya]] is typically provided by the universities. Registration of engineers is governed by the Engineers Registration Act. A candidate stands to qualify as a registered engineer, R.Eng, if he/she is a holder of a minimum four years post-secondary Engineering Education and a minimum of three years of postgraduate work experience.&lt;ref&gt;Engineers Registration Board of Kenya. [http://www.erbk.go.ke/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=27 Registration of Engineers in Kenya] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816025957/http://www.erbk.go.ke/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=27 |date=16 August 2010 }}, Engineers Registration Board of Kenya website.&lt;/ref&gt;

All registrations are undertaken by the Engineers Registration Board which is a statutory body established through an Act of the Kenyan Parliament in 1969. A minor revision was done in 1992 to accommodate Technician Engineer grade. The Board has been given the responsibility of regulating the activities and conduct of Practicing Engineers in the Republic of Kenya in accordance with the functions and powers conferred upon it by the Act. Under CAP 530 of the Laws of Kenya, it is illegal for an engineer to practice or call himself an engineer if not registered with the Board. Registration with the Board is thus a license to practice engineering in Kenya.

===South Africa===
Engineering training in South Africa is typically provided by the universities, universities of technology and colleges for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (previously Further Education and Training).&lt;ref&gt;Engineering Council Of South Africa. [http://www.ecsa.co.za/index.asp?x=procedure Registration Process], Engineering Council Of South Africa website, Bruma, Johannesburg, South Africa, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The qualifications provided by these institutions must have an [[Engineering Council of South Africa]] (ECSA) accreditation for the qualification for graduates and diplomats of these institutions to be registered as Candidate Certificated Engineers,Candidate Engineers, Candidate Engineering Technologists and Candidate Engineering Technicians.

The academic training performed by the universities is typically in the form of a four-year BSc(Eng), BIng or BEng degree. For the degree to be accredited, the course material must conform to the ECSA Exit Level Outcomes (ELO).

Professional Engineers (Pr Eng) are persons that are accredited by ECSA as engineering professionals. Legally, a Professional Engineer's sign off is required for any major project to be implemented, in order to ensure the safety and standards of the project. Professional Engineering Technologists (Pr Tech Eng) and Professional Engineering Technicians (Pr Techni Eng) are other members of the engineering team.

Professional Certificated Engineers (Pr Cert Eng) are people who hold one of seven Government Certificates of Competency and who have been registered by ECSA as engineering professionals.

The categories of professionals are differentiated by the degree of complexity of work carried out, where Professional Engineers are expected to solve complex engineering problems, Professional Engineering Technologists and Professional Certificated Engineers, broadly defined engineering problems and Professional Engineering Technicians, well-defined engineering problems.

===Tanzania===
Engineering training in Tanzania is typically provided by various universities and technical institutions in the country. Graduate engineers are registered by the Engineers Registration Board (ERB) after undergoing three years of practical training. A candidate stands to qualify as a professional engineer, P.Eng, if he/she is a holder of a minimum four years post-secondary Engineering Education and a minimum of three years of postgraduate work experience. Engineers Registration Board is a statutory body established through an Act of the Tanzanian Parliament in 1968. Minor revision was done in 1997 to address the issue of engineering professional excellence in the country.

The Board has been given the responsibility of regulating the activities and conduct of Practicing Engineers in the United Republic of Tanzania in accordance with the functions and powers conferred upon it by the Act. According to Tanzania Laws, it is illegal for an engineer to practice or call himself an engineer if not registered with the Board. Registration with the Board is thus a license to practice engineering in United Republic of Tanzania.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, engineering education is accredited by the [[Pakistan Engineering Council]], a statutory body, constituted under the PEC Act No. V of 1976 of the constitution of Pakistan and amended vide Ordinance No.XXIII of 2006, to regulate the engineering profession in the country. It aims to achieve rapid and sustainable growth in all national, economic and social fields. The council is responsible for maintaining realistic and internationally relevant standards of professional competence and ethics for engineers in the country. PEC interacts with the Government, both at the Federal and Provincial level by participating in Commissions, Committees and Advisory Bodies. PEC is a fully representative body of the engineering community in the country. PEC has a full signatory status with [[Washington Accord]].

===Austria===
In [[Austria]], similar to Germany, an engineering degree can be obtained from either Universities or Fachhochschulen (Universities of Applied Sciences). As in most of Europe, the education usually consists of a 3-year [[Bachelor's Degree]] and a 2-year [[Master's Degree]].

A lower engineering degree is offered by [[H√∂here Technische Lehranstalt|H√∂heren Technische Lehranstalten]], (HTL, Higher Technical Institute), a form of secondary college which reaches from grade 9 to 13. There are disciplines like [[civil engineering]], [[electronics]], [[information technology]], etc.

In the 5th year of HTL, as in other secondary schools in Austria, there is a final exam, called [[Matura]]. Graduates obtain an ''Ingenieur'' engineering degree after three years of work in the studied field.

===Bulgaria===
The beginning of higher engineering education in [[Bulgaria]] is established by the Law for Establishing a Higher Technical School in Sofia in 1941. Only two years later however because of the bombs flying over [[Sofia]], the school was evacuated in [[Lovech]], and the regular classes were discontinued. The learning process started again in 1945 when the University became a State Polytechnic.

In [[Bulgaria]], engineers are trained in the three basic degrees - bachelor, master and doctor. Since the [[Bologna declaration]], students receive a bachelor's degree (4 years of studies), optionally followed by a [[master's degree]] (1 years of studies). The science and engineering courses include lecture and laboratory education. The main subjects to be studied are mathematics, physics, chemistry, electrical engineering and etc. The degree received after completing with a state exam or defense of a thesis. Absolvents are awarded with the ''Ing''. title always put in front of one's name.

Some of [[engineering]] specialties are completely traditional, such as machine building, computer and software engineering, automation, electrical engineering, electronics. Newer specialties are [[engineering design]], mechatronics, [[aviation engineering]], industrial engineering.

The following technical universities prepare mainly engineers in Bulgaria:

* Technical University Sofia
* Technical University Varna
* Technical University Gabrovo&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tugab.bg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=featured&amp;Itemid=298&amp;lang=en Technical University Gabrovo]&lt;/ref&gt;
* University of Forestry
* University of Architecture, Civil Engineering and Geodesy
* University of Chemical Technology and Metallurgy Sofia
* Agricultural University Plovdiv
* University of Mining and Geology ‚ÄúSt. Ivan Rilski‚Äù

The Bulgarian engineers are united in the Federation of Scientific and Technical Unions, established in 1949. It comprises 33 territorial and 19 national unions.

===Denmark===
In Denmark, the engineering degree is delivered by either Universities or Engineering Colleges (e.g. Engineering College of Aarhus).

Students receive first a baccalaureate degree (3 years of studies) followed by a master's degree (1‚Äì2 years of studies) according to the principles of the Bologna declaration, though traditionally. The engineering doctorate degree is the ''[[PhD]]'' (3 years of studies).

The quality of Danish engineering expertise has long been much vaunted. Danish engineers especially from Engineering Colleges have also been praised at being very practical (i.e. skilled at physical work related to their discipline), ascribed to the high quality of the apprenticeship courses many Danish engineers go through as part of their education.

===Finland===
Finland's system is derived from Germany's system. Two kinds of universities are recognized, the universities and the universities of applied sciences [Ammattikorkeakoulu].

Universities award typically 'Bachelor of Science in Technology' and 'Master of Science in Technology' degrees. Bachelor's degree is a three-year degree as master's degree is equivalent for two-year full-time studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aalto.fi/en/studies/about_studying_at_aalto/ |title=Aalto University studies-pages |accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Finnish the master's degree is called [[diplomi-insin√∂√∂ri]], similarly as in Germany (''Diplom-Ingenieur''). The degrees are awarded by engineering schools or faculties in universities (in [[Aalto University]], [[University of Oulu|Oulu]], [[University of Turku|Turku]], [[University of Vaasa|Vaasa]] and [[√Öbo Akademi University]]) or by separate universities of technology ([[Tampere university of technology|Tampere UT]] and [[Lappeenranta University of Technology|Lappeenranta UT]]). The degree is a scientific, theoretical taught master's degree. Master's thesis is important part of master's degree studies. Master's degree qualifies for further study into Licentiate or Doctorate. Because of the Bologna process, the degree ''tekniikan kandidaatti'' ("Bachelor of Technology"), corresponding to three years of study into the master's degree, has been introduced.

The Universities of applied sciences are regional universities that award 3.5-, to 4-year engineer degrees [[insin√∂√∂ri (amk)]]. An engineer's degree is noramlly 240 ECTS. There are 20 universities of applied sciences in Finland with a vide range of disciplines. The aim of the degree is professional competency with an emphasis on practical problem solving in engineering. Normally the teaching language is Finnish but there are also universities with Swedish as language of instruction, and most universities of applied sciences offer some degrees in English, too. These universities also award a  Master of Engineering degree, designed for engineers already involved in the working life with at least two years of professional experience.

===France===
In France, the engineering degree is mainly delivered by "[[Grande √âcole#List of graduate engineering schools (grandes √©coles d'ing√©nieurs)|Grandes √âcoles d'Ing√©nieurs]]" (graduate schools of engineering) upon completion of 3 years of Master's studies. Many √âcoles recruit undergraduate students from [[Classe pr√©paratoire aux grandes √©coles|CPGE]] (two- or three-year high level program after the [[Baccalaur√©at]]), even though some of them include an integrated undergraduate cycle. Other students accessing these Grandes Ecoles may come from other horizons, such as DUT or BTS (technical two-year university degrees) or standard two-year university degrees. In all cases, recruitment is highly selective. Hence graduate engineers in France have studied a minimum of five years after the baccalaureate. Since 2013, the French engineering degree is recognized by the [[American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers|AACRAO]] as a Master of Science in Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://highereducation.frenchculture.org/news/accord-historique-pour-les-ingenieurs-francais-aux-etats-unis|title=Accord historique pour les ing√©nieurs fran√ßais aux Etats-Unis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To be able to deliver the engineering degree, an √âcole Master 's curriculum has to be validated by the [[Commission des titres d'ing√©nieur]] ([[Commission des titres d'ing√©nieur|Commission of the Engineering Title]]). It is important for the external observer to note that the system in France is extremely demanding in its entrance requirements (numerus clausus, using student rank in exams as the only criterion), despite being almost free of tuition fees, and much stricter in regards to the academic level of applying students than many other systems. The system focuses solely on selecting students by their engineering fundamental disciplines (mathematics, physics) abilities rather than their financial ability to finance large tuition fees, thus enabling a wider population access to higher education. In fact, being a graduate engineer in France is considered as being near/at the top of the social/professional ladder. The engineering profession grew from the military and the nobility in the 18th century. Before the [[French Revolution]], engineers were trained in schools for technical officers, like "√âcole d'Arts et M√©tiers" ([[Arts et M√©tiers ParisTech]]) established in 1780. Then, other schools were created, for instance the [[√âcole Polytechnique]] and the [[Conservatoire national des arts et m√©tiers]] which was established in 1794. Polytechnique is one of the ''grandes √©coles'' that have traditionally prepared technocrats to lead French government and industry, and has been one of the most privileged routes into the elite divisions of the civil service known as the [[French Civil Service#Great corps of the State|"grands corps de l'√âtat"]].

Inside a French company the title of ''Ing√©nieur'' refers to a rank in qualification and is not restricted. Therefore, there are sometimes ''Ing√©nieurs des Ventes'' (Sales Engineers), ''Ing√©nieur Marketing'', ''Ing√©nieur Bancaire'' (Banking Engineer), ''Ing√©nieur Recherche &amp; D√©veloppement'' (R&amp;D Engineer), etc.

===Germany===
In [[Germany]], the term ''Ingenieur'' (engineer) is legally protected and may only be used by graduates of a university degree program in engineering. Such degrees are offered by universities (''Universit√§ten''), including ''Technische Universit√§ten'' (universities of technology), or [[Fachhochschule|''Fachhochschulen'']] (universities of applied sciences), including ''[[Technische Hochschule]]n''.

Since the [[Bologna Process|Bologna reforms]], students receive a bachelor's degree (3‚Äì4 years of studies), optionally followed by a master's degree (1‚Äì2 years of studies). Prior to the country adopting the Bologna system, the first and only pre-doctorate degree received after completing engineering education at university was the German ''[[Diplom]]ingenieur'' (Dipl.-Ing.). The engineering [[doctorate]] is the ''[[Doktoringenieur]]'' (Dr.-Ing.).

The quality of German engineering expertise has long been much vaunted, especially in the field of mechanical engineering. This is supported by the degree to which the various theories governing [[aerodynamics]] and [[structural mechanics]] are named after German scientists and engineers such as [[Ludwig Prandtl]]. German engineers have also been praised at being very practical (i.e. skilled at physical work related to their discipline), ascribed to the high quality of the apprenticeship courses many German engineers go through as part of their education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dF7G0yZ51GgC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41 Human Resource Management] - Biswajeet Pattanayak, 3rd Edition, Page 41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
In [[Italy]], the engineering degree and "engineer" title is delivered by Polytechnic Universities upon completion of 3 years of studies (laurea). Additional master's degree (2 years) and doctorate programs (3 years) provide the title of "dottore di ricerca in ingegneria". Students that started studies in Polytechnic Universities before 2005 (when Italy adopted the Bologna declaration) need to complete a 5 years program to get the engineer title. In this case the master's degree is obtained after 1 year of studies.
Only people with an engineer title can be employed as "engineers". Still, some with competence and experience in an engineering field that do not have such a title, can still be employed to perform engineering tasks as "specialist", "assistant", "technologist" or "technician". But, only engineers can take legal responsibility and provide guarantee upon the work done by a team in their area of expertise. Sometimes a company working in this area, which temporarily does not have any employees with an engineer title must pay for an external service of an engineering audit to provide legal guarantee for their products or services.

===The Netherlands===
In the [[Netherlands]] there are two ways to study engineering, i.e. at the Dutch 'technical [[hogeschool]]', which is a [[professional school]] (equivalent to a [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|polytechnic]] in the UK and a [[university of applied sciences]] internationally) and awards a practically orientated degree with the pre-nominal ''ing.'' after four years study. Or at the university, which offers a more academically oriented degree with the pre-nominal ''ir.'' after five years study. Both are abbreviations of the title [[Ingenieur]].

In 2002 when the [[Netherlands]] switched to the Bachelor-Master system. This is a consequence of the [[Bologna process]]. In this accord 29 European countries agreed to harmonize their higher education system and create a [[European higher education area]]. In this system the professional schools award bachelor's degrees like ''BEng'' or ''BASc'' after four years study. And the universities with engineering programs award the bachelor's degree ''BSc'' after the third year. A university bachelor is usually continuing his education for one or two more years to earn his master's degree ''MSc''. Adjacent to these degrees, the old titles of the pre-populated system are still in use. A ''vocational'' bachelor may be admitted to a university master's degree program although often they are required to take additional courses.

===Poland===
In [[Poland]] after 3,5‚Äì4 years of technical studies, one gets '''in≈ºynier''' degree ('''in≈º.'''), which corresponds to ''B.Sc.'' or ''B.Eng.'' After that, one can continue studies, and after 2 years of post-graduate programme (supplementary studies) can obtain additional ''M.Sc.'' (or ''M.Eng.'') degree, called '''magister''', '''mgr''', and that time one has two degrees: '''magister in≈ºynier''', '''mgr in≈º.''' (literally: ''master engineer''). The ''mgr'' degree formerly (until full adaptation of [[Bologna process]] by university) could be obtained in integrated 5 years B.Sc-M.Sc. programme studies. Graduates having ''magister in≈ºynier'' degree, can start 4 years doctorate studies (Ph.D.), which require opening of doctoral proceedings (''przew√≥d doktorski''), carrying out own research, passing some exams (''e.g.'' foreign language, philosophy, economy, leading subjects), writing and defense of doctoral thesis. Some Ph.D. students have also classes with undergraduate students (B.Sc., M.Sc.). Graduate of doctorate studies of technical university holds ''scientific degree'' of '''doktor nauk technicznych''', '''dr in≈º.''', (literally: ''"doctor of technical sciences"'') or other ''e.g.'' ''Doktor Nauk Chemicznych'' (lit. ''"doctor of chemical sciences"'').

===Portugal===
In Portugal, there are two paths to study engineering: the [[polytechnic (Portugal)|polytechnic]] and the university paths. In theory, but many times not so much in practice, the polytechnic path is more practical oriented, the university path being more research oriented.
 
In this system, the polytechnic institutes award a ''licenciatura'' (bachelor) in engineering degree after three years of study, that can be complemented by a ''mestrado'' (master) in engineering after two plus years of study.

Regarding the universities, they offer both engineering programs similar to those of the polytechnics (three years ''licenciatura'' plus two years ''mestrado'') as ''mestrado integrados'' (integrated master's) in engineering programs. The ''mestrado integrado'' programs take five years of study to complete, awarding a ''licenciatura'' degree in engineering sciences after the first three years and a ''mestrado'' degree in engineering after the whole five years. Further, the universities also offer ''doutoramento'' (Ph.D.) programs in engineering.

Being an holder of an academic degree in engineering is not enough to practice the profession of engineer and to have the legal right of the use of the title ''engenheiro'' (engineer) in Portugal. For that, it is necessary to be admitted and be a member of the [[Ordem dos Engenheiros]] (Portuguese institution of engineers). At the Ordem dos Engenheiros, an engineer is classified as an E1, E2 or E3 grade engineer, accordingly with the higher engineer degree he or she holds. Holders of the ancient pre-Bologna declaration five years ''licenciatura'' degrees in engineering are classified as E2 engineers.

===Romania===
In [[Romania]], the engineering degree and "engineer" title is delivered by technology and polytechnics universities upon completion of 4 years of studies. Additional master's degree (2 years) and doctorate programs (4‚Äì5 years) provide the title of "doctor inginer". Students that started studies in Polytechnic Universities before 2005 (when Romania adopted the Bologna declaration) needed to complete a 5 years program to get the engineer title. In this case the master's degree is obtained after 1 year of studies.
Only people with an engineer title can be employed as "engineers". Still, some with competence and experience in an engineering field that do not have such a title, can still be employed to perform engineering tasks as "specialist", "assistant", "technologist" or "technician". But, only engineers can take legal responsibility and provide guarantee upon the work done by a team in their area of expertise. Sometimes a company working in this area, which temporarily does not have any employees with an engineer title must pay for an external service of an engineering audit to provide legal guarantee for their products or services.

[[Moscow School of Mathematics and Navigation]] was a first Russian educational institution founded by [[Peter the Great]] in 1701. It provided Russians with technical education for the first time and much of its curriculum was devoted to producing sailors, engineers, cartographers and bombardiers to support Russian expanding navy and army.
Then in 1810, the Saint Petersburg [[Military engineering-technical university]] becomes the first engineering [[higher learning institution]] in the [[Russian Empire]], after addition of officers classes and application of five-year term of teaching. So initially more rigorisms of standards and teaching terms became the traditional historical feature of the Russian engineering education in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://works.tarefer.ru/33/101252/index.html|title=–†–µ—Ñ–µ—Ä–∞—Ç –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –ü–æ–¥–≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤–∫–∞ –∏–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–æ–≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ –≤ XIX –≤–µ–∫–µ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slovakia===
In [[Slovakia]], an engineer (''in≈æinier'') is considered to be a person holding master's degree in technical sciences or economics. Several technical and economic universities offer 4-5-year master study in the fields of chemistry, agriculture, material technology, computer science, electrical and mechanical engineering, nuclear physics and technology or economics. A bachelor's degree in similar field is prerequisite. Absolvents are awarded with the ''Ing.'' title always put in front of one's name; eventual follow-up doctoral study is offered both by universities and some institutes of the [[Slovak Academy of Sciences]].

===Spain===
In [[Spain]], the engineering degree is delivered by Universities in Engineering Schools, called "Escuelas de Ingenier√≠a". Like with any other degree in Spain, students need to pass a series of examinations based on Bachillerato's subjects (Selectividad), select their bachelor's degree, and their marks determine whether they are access the degree they want or not.

Students receive first a grado degree (4 years of studies) followed by a master's degree (1‚Äì2 years of studies) according to the principles of the Bologna declaration, though traditionally, the degree received after completing an engineering education is the Spanish title of "Ingeniero". Using the title "Ingeniero" is legally regulated and limited to the according academic graduates.

===Sweden===
An institution offering engineering education is called "teknisk [[h√∂gskola]]" (institute of technology). These schools primarily offers five-year programmes resulting in the ''civilingenj√∂r'' degree (not to be confused with the narrower English term "civil engineer"), internationally corresponding to a [[Master of Science in Engineering]] degree. These programmes typically offers a strong backing in the natural sciences, and the degree also opens up for doctoral (PHD) studies towards the degree "teknologie doktor". Civilingenj√∂r programmes are offered in a broad range of fields: [[Engineering physics]], [[Chemical engineering|Chemistry]], [[Civil engineering]], [[surveying]], Industrial engineering and management, etc. There also are shorter three-year programmes called ''h√∂gskoleingenj√∂r'' ([[Bachelor of Science in Engineering]]) that are typically more applied.

===Turkey===
In [[Turkey]], engineering degrees range from a bachelor's degree in engineering (for a four-year period), to a master's degree (adding two years), and to a doctoral degree (usually four to five years).

The title is limited by law to people with an engineering degree, and the use of the title by others (even persons with much more work experience) is illegal.

The Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects (UCTEA) was established in 1954 and separates engineers and architects to professional branches, with the condition of being within the framework of laws and regulations and in accordance with the present conditions, requirements and possibilities and to also establishes new Chambers for the group of engineers and architects, whose professional or working areas are similar or the same.

UCTEA is maintaining its activities with its 23 Chambers, 194 branches of its Chambers and 39 Provincial Coordination Councils. Approximately, graduates of 70 related academic disciplines in engineering, architecture and city planning are members of the Chambers of UCTEA.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, like in the United States and [[Canada]], most professional engineers are trained in universities, but some can start in a technical [[apprenticeship]] and either enroll in a university engineering degree later, or enroll in one of the [[Engineering Council UK]] programmes (level 6 - bachelor's and 7 - master's) administered by the [[City and Guilds of London Institute]]. A recent trend has seen the rise of both bachelor's and master's degree higher engineering apprenticeships. All accredited engineering courses and apprenticeships are assessed and approved by the various professional engineering institutions reflecting the subject by engineering discipline covered; [[IMechE]], [[Institution of Engineering and Technology|IET]], [[British Computer Society|BCS]], [[Institution of Civil Engineers|ICE]], [[Institution of Structural Engineers|IStructE]] etc. Many of these institutions date back to the 19th century, and have previously administered their own engineering examination programmes. They have become globally renowned as premier learned societies.

The degree then counts in part to qualifying as a [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|Chartered Engineer]] after a period (usually 4‚Äì8 years beyond the first degree) of structured professional practice, professional practice peer review and, if required, further exams to then become a corporate member of the relevant professional body. The term 'Chartered Engineer' is regulated by [[Royal Assent]] and its use is restricted only to those registered; the awarding of this status is devolved to the professional institutions by the Engineering Council.

In the UK, most engineering courses take three years for an undergraduate bachelors ([[BEng]]) and four years for an [[Master's degree in Europe#United Kingdom|undergraduate master's]]. Students who read a four-year engineering course are awarded a [[MEng|Masters of Engineering]] (as opposed to [[Master of Science in Engineering|Masters of Science in Engineering]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.see.ed.ac.uk/undergraduate/Prospective/mech/DegsAvail/mech_eng.shtml "Prospective"], [[University of Edinburgh]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some universities allow a student to opt out after one year before completion of the programme and receive a [[Higher National Diploma]] if a student has successfully completed the second year, or a [[Higher National Certificate]] if only successfully completed year one. Many courses also include an option of a year in industry, which is usually a year before completion. Students who opt for this are awarded a 'sandwich' degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seacoast.sunderland.ac.uk/~hs0acu/Biomed/sandwich.htm "Sandwich degree"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726093951/http://seacoast.sunderland.ac.uk/~hs0acu/Biomed/sandwich.htm |date=26 July 2010 }}, University of Sunderland&lt;/ref&gt;

BEng graduates may be registered as an "[[Incorporated Engineer]]" by the Engineering Council after a period of structured professional practice, professional practice peer review and, if required, further exams to then become a member of the relevant professional body. Again, the term 'Incorporated Engineer' is regulated by Royal Assent and its use is restricted only to those registered; the awarding of this status is devolved to the professional institutions by the Engineering Council.

Unlike the US and Canada, engineers do not require a licence to practice the profession in the UK. In the UK, the term "engineer" is applied to non-degree vocations such as [[Engineering technologist|technologist]]s, [[technicians]], [[draftsmen]], [[machinists]], [[mechanic]]s, [[plumbers]], [[electricians]], repair people, semi-skilled and even unskilled occupations.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

In recent developments by government and industry, to addressing the growing skills deficit in many fields of UK engineering, there has been a strong emphasis placed on dealing with engineering in school and providing students with positive role models from a young age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/policy/the-need-for-role-models-in-british-engineering |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113014113/http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/policy/the-need-for-role-models-in-british-engineering |archive-date=13 January 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America==
===Canada===
Engineering degree education in Canada is highly regulated by the [[Canadian Council of Professional Engineers]] (Engineers Canada) and its Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB). In [[Canada]], there are 43 institutions offering 278 engineering accredited programs delivering a bachelor's degree after a term of 4 years.&lt;ref name="Engineers Canada Accreditation page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Engineers Canada Accreditation|url=http://www.engineerscanada.ca/accreditation|website=engineerscanada.ca|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many schools also offer graduate level degrees in the applied sciences. ''Accreditation'' means that students who successfully complete the accredited program will have received sufficient engineering knowledge in order to meet the knowledge requirements of licensure as a [[Professional Engineer]].&lt;ref name="Engineers Canada Accreditation page" /&gt; Alternately, Canadian graduates of unaccredited 3-year diploma, BSc, B.Tech, or B.Eng programs can qualify for professional license by association examinations. Some of the schools include: [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]], [[√âcole de technologie sup√©rieure]], [[√âcole Polytechnique de Montr√©al]], [[University of Toronto]], [[University of Manitoba]], [[University of Saskatchewan]], [[University of Victoria]], [[University of Calgary]], [[University of Alberta]], [[University of British Columbia]], [[McGill University]], [[Dalhousie University]], [[Ryerson University]], [[York University]], [[University of Regina]], [[Carleton University]], [[McMaster University]], [[University of Ottawa]], [[Queen's University]], [[University of New Brunswick]], [[UOIT]], [[University of Waterloo]], [[University of Guelph]], [[University of Windsor]], [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]], and [[Royal Military College of Canada]] just to name a few. Every university offering engineering degrees in Canada needs to be accredited by the CEAB (Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board), thus ensuring high standards are enforced at all universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineerscanada.ca/e/co_schools.cfm Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board Approved Schools] Retrieved on 13 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Engineering degrees in Canada are distinct from degrees in [[engineering technology]] which are more applied degrees or diplomas. An engineering education in Canada is held in very high esteem culminating by qualifying as a [[professional engineer]] (P.Eng) licensee. Many graduate engineers enter other areas of professional practice including management consulting, law, medicine, and business administration.

=== Mexico ===
{{Confusing section|date=January 2017}}
In the case of Mexico, the education in Engineering field could be taken from public and private Universities. Both types of Colleges and Universities can confers degrees of B.Eng., B.Sc., M.Eng., M.Sc. and Ph.D. through the presentation and dissertation of a thesis or other kind of requirements such as Technical reports, knowledge exams among others.

The first University on Mexico in offers degrees in some Engineering fields was the Pontifical and royal University of Mexico, established under the Spanish rule; the degrees offered by includes Mines Engineering and Physical Mathematical state of the art knowledge from Europe.

Entered the 19th century and lack of political stability the Universities founded under Spanish rule were closed and reopened and the Engineering teaching tradition was lost; the University of Mexico, University of Guadalajara and University of M√©rida suffered this. then the liberal rule create the Arts and Handcraft schools were opened without the same success as the Universities. Entered on 20th Century and with the success of Mexican Revolution some of that old colleges were reopened and the old Arts and Handcraft schools were joined to the new Universities. On 1936 the National Polytechnic Institute of Mexico was created as an educational alternative for workers son and it's families, few time later the Regional Institutes of Technology were founded as a branch of the Polytechnic Institute on few states of the republic, the most of them do not have any University in own territory.

Right now the Regional Institutes of Technology were merged into one single entity labeled as "Mexican National Technological Institute". The National Polytechnic Institute is the ensign university of the Mexican federal government on engineering education.

Some of the first engineers designed irrigation canals, buildings, dams, and many other things to satisfy the needs of the people. Early engineers during wartime designed weapons and war machines. Engineering education has changed since the times of the early engineers. "By the middle of the 20th century there were almost 1 million engineers in the United States."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Reyes-Guerra, D. R. (2011). Engineering. In J. M. Castagno, P. Barrows, L. Brearley, &amp; K. Fairchild (Eds.), Grolier online. Retrieved from http://0-ea.grolier.com.libweb.dmacc.edu/article?id=0143510-00{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first professional degree in engineering is a bachelor's degree with few exceptions. This being said, interest in engineering has grown since 1999; the number of bachelor's degrees issued has increased by 20%.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Most bachelor's degree engineering programs are four years long and require about two years of [[Core curriculum|core courses]] followed by two years of specialized discipline specific courses. This is where a typical engineering student would learn [[mathematics]] (single- and multi-variable [[calculus]] and elementary [[differential equation]]s), general [[chemistry]], [[English composition]], general and modern [[physics]], [[computer science]] (typically [[Computer programming|programming]]), and introductory engineering in several areas that are required for a satisfactory engineering background and to be successful in their program of choice. Several courses in [[social science]]s or [[humanities]] are often also required to be taken, but are commonly [[elective course]]s from a broad choice. Required common engineering courses typically include [[engineering drawing]]/drafting, [[materials engineering]], [[statics]] and [[Dynamics (physics)|dynamics]], [[strength of materials]], electrical engineering, [[thermodynamics]], [[fluid mechanics]], and perhaps some [[Systems engineering|systems]] or industrial engineering. The science and engineering courses include lecture and laboratory education, either in the same course(s) or in separate courses. However, some professors and educators believe that engineering programs should change to focus more on professional engineering practice, and engineering courses should be taught more by professional engineering practitioners and not by engineering researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Wulf, W. A., Smith, R., Winston, S. B., Lotas, A., Marcum, K., Beale, K., Sherman, W. (2007, 23 February). Engineering education in the 21st century [Video file]. Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oaIhzlpENY&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the first year an engineering student should be looking to decide what specialization they would like to study. Specializations could include the following: civil (including [[Structural engineering|structural]]), [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]], electrical (often including [[computer engineering|computers]]), [[Chemical engineering|chemical]], [[Biological engineering|biological]], [[Industrial engineering|industrial]], [[Aerospace engineering|aerospace]], [[Materials engineering|materials]] (including [[Metallurgical engineering|metallurgical]]), [[Agricultural engineering|agricultural]], and many other specializations. After choosing a specialization an engineering student will begin to take class that will build on the education that they have received and focus their future education toward their specialization or field of study. Towards the end of their undergraduate education, engineering students often undertake a [[design]] or other special project specific to their field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learnon.org/ |title=Educating Engineers |accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After formal education, the engineer will often enter an [[internship]] or [[engineer in training]] status for approximately four years. After that time the [[engineer in training]] can decide whether or not to take a state licensing test to make them a [[Professional Engineer]]. After successful completion of that test, the Professional engineer can place the initials P.E. after their name signifying that they are now a Professional Engineer.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
There are also [[graduate degree]] options for an engineer. Many engineers decide to complete a master's degree in some field of engineering or [[Masters in Business Administration|business administration]] or get education in law, medicine, or other field.

Two types of doctorate are available also, the traditional [[Ph.D.]] or the [[doctor of engineering]]. The Ph.D. focuses on research and academic excellence, whereas the doctor of engineering focuses on practical engineering. The education requirements are the same for both degrees; however, the [[dissertation]] required is different. The Ph.D. requires the standard research problem, where the doctor of engineering focuses on a practical dissertation.

In present undergraduate engineering education, the emphasis on linear systems develops a way of thinking that dismisses nonlinear dynamics as spurious oscillations. The linear systems approach oversimplifies the dynamics of nonlinear systems. Hence, the undergraduate students and teachers should recognize the educational value of [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title= Introducing undergraduate electrical engineering students to chaotic dynamics: Computer simulations with logistic map and buck converter.|last= Iqbal|first= Sajid| year= 2014| doi= 10.1109/AMS.2014.20|pages = 47‚Äì52|publisher= Modelling Symposium (AMS), 2014 8th Asia.

After graduation, [[continuing education]] courses may be needed to keep a government-issued [[professional engineer]] (PE) license valid, to keep skills fresh, to expand skills, or to keep up with new technology.

== South America ==
=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, education in engineering is offered by both public and private institutions. A degree in engineering requires 5 to 6 years of studies, comprising the core courses, specific subjects, an internship and a ''Course Completion Paper''.

Due to the nature of college admissions in Brazil, most students have to declare their major before entering college. This said, the first 2 years of a degree in engineering consist mostly of the core courses (calculus, physics, programming, etc.) along with a few specific subjects as well as some courses in humanities. After this period, some institutions offer specializations within the different fields of engineering (i.e. a student majoring in electrical engineering can choose to specialize in electronics or telecommunications) although most institutions balance their workload in order to give the students a consistent knowledge of every specialiation.

Towards the end of their undergratuate education, students are required to develop the Course Completion Paper under the guidance of an adviser to be presented to and graded by a number of professors. In some institutions, studends are also required to pursue an internship (the amount of time depends on the institution).

In order to pursue a career in engineering, graduates must first register with and abide by the rules of the Regional Counsel of Engineering and Agronomy of their state, a regional representative of the Federal Counsel of Engineering and Agronomy, a certification board for engineers, agronomists, geologists and other professionals of the applied sciences.

'''Fishless cycling''' is a form of "maturing" an [[aquarium]]. In this process, [[ammonia]] is provided to allow beneficial bacteria to colonize. Fishless cycling can reduce the chance of fish loss resulting from insufficient populations of these bacteria.

== Process ==
[[File:Aquarium Nitrogen Cycle.png|thumb|300px|The nitrogen cycle in an aquarium]]
Fishless cycling takes place over a period of several weeks, during which the aquarist provides an ammonia source for the development of the nitrifying bacterial colony. Nitrifying bacteria in the aquarium grow on all surfaces, but particularly in areas of high water flow and high surface area such as the filter. Allowing ammonia to be converted to nitrite, and on to the less harmful nitrate, minimizes stress and injury to aquarium fish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.algone.com/fishless_cycling.php  Fishless Cycling of the Aquarium] (Algone.com)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aquatic-hobbyist.com/profiles/misc/fishlesscycling.html  Fishless Cycling] (Aquatic-Hobbyist.com)&lt;/ref&gt; The "nitrogen cycle" may take several weeks to complete, but may be quicker under certain conditions. Higher water temperatures, greater dissolved oxygen and bacterial seeding seeding from an established tank may cut down the time required to less than a week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://petfishclub.com/tips-to-speed-up-aquarium-cycling/  3 Tips For The Fastest Aquarium Nitrogen Cycle] (PetFishClub.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==
The most significant advantage of fishless cycling is that it can reduce fish loss due to ammonia and nitrite spikes. Fish loss can be very discouraging for beginners of fish keeping, so indirectly, fishless cycling can also help beginners get a good start.

Cycling aquariums using feeder fish is risky because it infects the aquarium with any disease or parasite they happen to have. Fish raised as feeders do not get the same degree of care as non feeders. Fishless cycling avoids this potential problem.

Fishless cycling also allows the aquarium to be partially stocked from the moment it is cycled,  if the nitrogen cycle is completed with high concentration of pure ammonia added daily. This makes for faster stocking than having to wait several weeks between each new group of additions to the tank. It can also be extremely useful when the fish keeper plan to stock a tank full of territorial aggressive fish such as African cichlids, where the later added fish can be at a disadvantage.

== Disadvantages ==
*Phosphates are often created as byproducts when decaying fish food is the source of ammonia.
*There might not be enough ammonia to allow a sufficient population of bacteria to colonize when fish food is the source of ammonia.

Note that these are not problems when ammonium hydroxide or ammonium chloride is used as the source of ammonia.

*It might cost more than using a few cheap fish to cycle the tank, if you include all the cost of the water test kit, pure ammonia, etc.
*Pure ammonia cycling is not as quick nor does it allow as higher bio load stocking of the aged filter media method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanaquariumproducts.com/Nitrogen_Cycle.html Aquarium Nitrogen Cycle]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18184">'''Generalized filtering''' is a generic [[Recursive Bayesian estimation|Bayesian filtering]] scheme for nonlinear state-space models.&lt;ref&gt;K Friston, K Stephan, B Li, and J. Daunizeau, "[http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/Generalised%20Filtering.pdf Generalised Filtering]," [[Mathematical Problems in Engineering]], vol. vol., 2010, p. 621670, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on a [[Principle of least action|variational principle of least action]], formulated in generalized coordinates.&lt;ref&gt;B Balaji and K Friston, "[http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/Bayesian%20State%20Estimation%20Using%20Generalized%20Coordinates.pdf Bayesian state estimation using generalized coordinates]," Proc. SPIE, p. 80501Y , 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the concept of "generalized coordinates" as used here differs from the concept of [[generalized coordinates]] of motion as used in (multibody) dynamical systems analysis. Generalized filtering furnishes posterior densities over hidden states (and parameters) generating observed data using a generalized gradient descent on variational free energy, under the [[Laplace's method|Laplace assumption]]. Unlike classical (e.g., [[Kalman filter|Kalman-Bucy]] or [[Particle filter|particle]]) filtering, generalized filtering eschews Markovian assumptions about random fluctuations. Furthermore, it operates online, assimilating data to approximate the posterior density  over unknown quantities, without the need for a backward pass. Special cases include '''variational filtering''',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; '''dynamic expectation maximization'''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and '''generalized predictive coding'''.

== Definition ==
'''Definition''': Generalized filtering rests on the [[tuple]] &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,U,X,S,p,q)&lt;/math&gt;:
* ''A sample space'' &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;  from which random fluctuations &lt;math&gt;\omega \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;  are drawn
* ''Control states'' &lt;math&gt;U \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; ‚Äì that act as external causes, input or forcing terms 
* ''Hidden states''  &lt;math&gt;X:X \times U \times \Omega \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; ‚Äì that cause sensor states and depend on control states
* ''Sensor states''  &lt;math&gt;S:X \times U \times \Omega \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; ‚Äì a probabilistic mapping from hidden and control states 
* ''Generative density''  &lt;math&gt;p(\tilde{s},\tilde{x},\tilde{u}\mid m)&lt;/math&gt; ‚Äì over sensory, hidden and control states under a generative model &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;
* ''Variational density'' &lt;math&gt;q(\tilde{x},\tilde{u}\mid \tilde{\mu})&lt;/math&gt;  ‚Äì over hidden and control states with mean &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\mu} \in \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;

 
Here ~ denotes a variable in generalized coordinates of motion: &lt;math&gt;\tilde{u} = [u,u',u'',\ldots]^T&lt;/math&gt;

=== Generalized filtering ===
The objective is to approximate the posterior density over hidden and control states, given sensor states and a generative model ‚Äì and estimate the (path integral of) [[Marginal likelihood|model evidence]]  &lt;math&gt;p(\tilde{s}(t)\vert m)&lt;/math&gt; to compare different models. This generally involves an intractable marginalization over hidden states, so model evidence (or marginal likelihood) is replaced with a variational free energy bound.&lt;ref&gt;R P Feynman, Statistical mechanics. Reading MA: Benjamin, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Given the following definitions:

: &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\mu}(t) = \underset{\tilde{\mu}}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} \{F(\tilde{{s}}(t),\tilde{{\mu }})\}  &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; G(\tilde{s},\tilde{x},\tilde{u})=-\ln p(\tilde{s},\tilde{x},\tilde{u}\vert m) &lt;/math&gt;

Denote the [[Entropy (information theory)|Shannon entropy]] of the density &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;H[q]=E_q[-\log(q)]&lt;/math&gt;. We can then write the variational free energy in two ways:

: &lt;math&gt; F(\tilde{s}, \tilde\mu)=E_q [G(\tilde{s},\tilde{x},\tilde{u})]-H[q(\tilde{x},\tilde{u} \vert \tilde{\mu})] =-\ln p(\tilde{s} \vert m)+D_{KL} [q(\tilde{x},\tilde{u} \vert \tilde{\mu})\vert \vert p(\tilde{x},\tilde{u} \vert \tilde{s},m)]  &lt;/math&gt;

The second equality shows that minimizing variational free energy (i) minimizes the [[Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence|Kullback-Leibler divergence]] between the variational and true posterior density and (ii) renders the variational free energy (a bound approximation to) the negative log evidence (because the divergence can never be less than zero).&lt;ref&gt;M J Beal, "[http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/mbeal/papers/beal03.pdf Variational Algorithms for Approximate Bayesian Inference]," PhD. Thesis, University College London, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Laplace assumption &lt;math&gt;q(\tilde{x},\tilde{{u}}\mid \tilde{\mu})=\mathcal{N}(\tilde{\mu},C)&lt;/math&gt; the variational density is Gaussian and the precision that minimizes free energy is &lt;math&gt;C^{-1}=\Pi =\partial_{\tilde{\mu}\tilde{\mu}} G(\tilde{\mu})&lt;/math&gt;. This means that free-energy can be expressed in terms of the variational mean &lt;ref&gt;K Friston, J Mattout, N Trujillo-Barreto, J Ashburner, and W Penny, "[http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/Variational%20free%20energy%20and%20the%20Laplace%20approximation.pdf Variational free energy and the Laplace approximation]," NeuroImage, vol. 34, no. 1, pp. 220-34, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; (omitting constants):

: &lt;math&gt;F=G(\tilde{\mu})+\textstyle{1 \over 2}\ln \vert \partial_{\tilde{\mu}\tilde{\mu}} G(\tilde{\mu})\vert&lt;/math&gt;

The variational means that minimize the (path integral) of free energy can now be recovered by solving the generalized filter:

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\tilde{\mu}}=D\tilde{\mu}-\partial_{\tilde{\mu}} F(\tilde{s},\tilde{\mu})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is a block matrix derivative operator of identify matrices such that &lt;math&gt;D\tilde{u}=[u',u'',\ldots ]^T&lt;/math&gt;

=== Variational basis ===

Generalized filtering is based on the following lemma: ''The self-consistent solution to'' &lt;math&gt;\dot{\tilde{\mu}}=D\tilde{\mu}-\partial_{\tilde{\mu}} F(s,\tilde{\mu})&lt;/math&gt; ''satisfies the variational [[Principle of least action|principle of stationary action]], where action is the path integral of variational free energy''

: &lt;math&gt;S=\int dt\, F(\tilde{s}(t),\tilde{\mu}(t))&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof''': self-consistency requires the motion of the mean to be the mean of the motion and (by the [[Fundamental lemma of calculus of variations|fundamental lemma of variational calculus]])

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\tilde{\mu}} = D\tilde{\mu}\Leftrightarrow \partial_{\tilde{\mu}} F(\tilde{s},\tilde{\mu}) = 0\Leftrightarrow \delta_{\tilde{\mu}} S=0&lt;/math&gt;

Put simply, small perturbations to the path of the mean do not change variational free energy and it has the least action of all possible (local) paths.

'''Remarks''': Heuristically, generalized filtering performs a gradient descent on variational free energy in a moving frame of reference: &lt;math&gt;\dot{{\tilde{{\mu }}}}-D\tilde{{\mu }}=-\partial_{\tilde{\mu}} F(s,\tilde{\mu})&lt;/math&gt;, where the frame itself minimizes variational free energy. For a related example in statistical physics, see Kerr and Graham &lt;ref&gt;W C Kerr and A J Graham, "[http://epjb.epj.org/articles/epjb/abs/2000/10/b9689/b9689.html Generalised phase space version of Langevin equations and associated Fokker-Planck equations]," Eur. Phys. J. B., vol. 15, pp. 305-11, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; who use ensemble dynamics in generalized coordinates to provide a generalized phase-space version of Langevin and associated Fokker-Planck equations.

In practice, generalized filtering uses [[Linearization|local linearization]] &lt;ref&gt;T Ozaki, "[http://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/statistica/oldpdf/A2n16.pdf A bridge between nonlinear time-series models and nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems: A local linearization approach]," Statistica Sin., vol. 2, pp. 113-135, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; over intervals &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; to recover discrete updates

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Delta \tilde{\mu} &amp; =(\exp (\Delta t\cdot J)-I)J^{-1}\dot{\tilde{\mu}} \\
J &amp; =\partial_{\tilde{\mu}} \dot{\tilde{\mu}} =D-\partial _{\tilde{\mu}\tilde{\mu}} F(\tilde{s},\tilde{\mu})
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This updates the means of hidden variables at each interval (usually the interval between observations).

== Generative (state-space) models in generalized coordinates ==

Usually, the generative density or model is specified in terms of a nonlinear input-state-output model with continuous nonlinear functions:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
         s &amp; = g(x,u)+\omega_s \\
 \dot{{x}} &amp; = f(x,u)+\omega_x
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding generalized model (under local linearity assumptions) obtains the from the chain rule

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \tilde{s} &amp; =\tilde{g}(\tilde{x},\tilde{u})+\tilde{\omega}_s \\ 
 \\ 
     s &amp; =g(x,u)+\omega_s \\
  s' &amp; =\partial_x g\cdot x'+\partial_u g\cdot u'+\omega'_s \\ 
 s'' &amp; =\partial_x g\cdot x''+\partial_u g\cdot u''+\omega''_s
\\
&amp;  \vdots \\
 \end{align} \qquad \begin{align}
 \dot{\tilde{x}}  &amp; =\tilde{f}(\tilde{x},\tilde{u})+\tilde{\omega}_x \\ 
 \\
 \dot{x} &amp; =f(x,u)+\omega_x \\ 
 \dot{x}' &amp; =\partial_x f\cdot x'+\partial_u f\cdot u'+\omega'_x \\ 
 \dot{x}''&amp; =\partial_x f\cdot x''+\partial_u f\cdot u''+\omega''_x \\ 
 &amp; \vdots 
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Gaussian assumptions about the random fluctuations &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; then prescribe the likelihood and empirical priors on the motion of hidden states

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 p\left( \tilde{s},\tilde{x},\tilde{u}\vert m \right) &amp; = p\left( \tilde{s}\vert \tilde{x},\tilde{u},m \right)p\left( {D\tilde{x}\vert x,\tilde{u},m} \right)p(x\vert m)p(\tilde{u}\vert m) \\ 
 p\left( \tilde{s}\vert \tilde{x},\tilde{u},m \right) &amp; = \mathcal{N}(\tilde{g}(\tilde{x},\tilde{u}),\tilde{\Sigma}(\tilde{x},\tilde{u})_s) \\ 
 p\left( {D\tilde{{x}}\vert x,\tilde{{u}},m} \right) &amp; = {\mathcal{N}}(\tilde{f}(\tilde{x},\tilde{u}),\tilde{\Sigma}(\tilde{x},\tilde{u})_x ) \\ 
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The covariances &lt;math&gt;\tilde{{\Sigma }}=V\otimes \Sigma&lt;/math&gt; factorize into a covariance among variables and correlations &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; among generalized fluctuations that encodes their [[autocorrelation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;V=\begin{bmatrix}
 1  &amp; 0  &amp; \ddot{\rho}(0) &amp; \cdots  \\
 0  &amp; -\ddot{\rho}(0)  &amp; 0 \ &amp; \ \\
 \ddot{\rho}(0) \ &amp; 0 \ &amp; \ddot{\ddot{\rho}}(0) \ &amp; \ \\
 \vdots \ &amp; \ &amp; \ &amp; \ddots \ \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\ddot{{\rho }}(0)&lt;/math&gt; is the second derivative of the autocorrelation function evaluated at zero. This is a ubiquitous measure of roughness in the theory of [[stochastic processes]].&lt;ref&gt;D R Cox and H D Miller, The theory of stochastic processes. London: Methuen, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; Crucially, the precision (inverse variance) of high order derivatives fall to zero fairly quickly, which means it is only necessary to model relatively low order generalized motion (usually between two and eight) for any given or parameterized autocorrelation function.

== Special cases ==

=== Filtering discrete time series ===

When time series are observed as a discrete sequence of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; observations, the implicit sampling is treated as part of the generative process, where (using [[Taylor's theorem]])

: &lt;math&gt; [s_1 ,\dots ,s_N ]^T = (E\otimes I)\cdot \tilde{s}(t): \qquad E_{ij} =\frac{(i-t)^{(j-1)}}{(j-1)!} &lt;/math&gt;

In principle, the entire sequence could be used to estimate hidden variables at each point in time. However, the precision of samples in the past and future falls quickly and can be ignored. This allows the scheme to assimilate data online, using local observations around each time point (typically between two and eight).

=== Generalized filtering and model parameters ===

For any slowly varying model parameters of the equations of motion &lt;math&gt;f(x,u,\theta )&lt;/math&gt; or precision &lt;math&gt;\tilde{{\Pi }}(x,u,\theta )&lt;/math&gt; generalized filtering takes the following form (where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the variational mean of the parameters)

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \dot{\mu} &amp; = \mu' \\ 
 \dot{\mu'} &amp; = -\partial_\mu F(\tilde{s},\mu )-\kappa \mu'
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the solution &lt;math&gt;\dot{{\tilde{{\mu }}}}=0&lt;/math&gt; minimizes variational free energy, when the motion of the mean is small. This can be seen by noting &lt;math&gt;\dot{{\mu }}={\dot{{\mu }}}'=0\Rightarrow \partial_{\mu } F=0\Rightarrow \delta_{\mu } S=0&lt;/math&gt;. It is straightforward to show that this solution corresponds to a classical [[Newton's method in optimization|Newton update]].&lt;ref&gt;K Friston, K Stephan, B Li, and J. Daunizeau, "Generalised Filtering," Mathematical Problems in Engineering, vol. vol., 2010, p. 621670, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to Bayesian filtering and predictive coding ==

=== Generalized filtering and Kalman filtering ===

Classical filtering under Markovian or Wiener assumptions is equivalent to assuming the precision of the motion of random fluctuations is zero. In this limiting case, one only has to consider the states and their first derivative &lt;math&gt;\tilde{{\mu }}=(\mu ,{\mu }')&lt;/math&gt;. This means generalized filtering takes the form of a Kalman-Bucy filter, with prediction and correction terms:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \dot{\mu} &amp; = \mu'-\partial_\mu F(s,\tilde{\mu}) \\ 
 \dot{\mu'}  &amp; =-\partial_{\mu'} F(s,\tilde{\mu}) 
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this first-order filtering into the discrete update scheme above gives the equivalent of (extended) Kalman filtering.&lt;ref&gt;K J Friston, N Trujillo-Barreto, and J Daunizeau, "DEM: A variational treatment of dynamic systems," Neuroimage, vol. 41, no. 3, pp. 849-85, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Generalized filtering and particle filtering ===

[[Particle filter]]ing is a sampling-based scheme that relaxes assumptions about the form of the variational or approximate posterior density. The corresponding generalized filtering scheme is called '''variational filtering'''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;K J Friston, "[http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/Variational%20filtering.pdf Variational filtering]," Neuroimage, vol. 41, no. 3, pp. 747-66, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In variational filtering, an ensemble of particles diffuse over the free energy landscape in a frame of reference that moves with the expected (generalized) motion of the ensemble. This provides a relatively simple scheme that eschews Gaussian (unimodal) assumptions. Unlike particle filtering it does not require proposal densities‚Äîor the elimination or creation of particles.

=== Generalized filtering and variational Bayes ===

[[Variational Bayesian methods|Variational Bayes]] rests on a mean field partition of the variational density:

: &lt;math&gt;q(\tilde{x},\tilde{u},\theta \dots \vert \tilde{\mu},\mu 
)=q(\tilde{x},\tilde{u}\vert \tilde{\mu})q(\theta \vert \mu 
)\dots&lt;/math&gt;

This partition induces a variational update or step for each marginal density‚Äîthat is usually solved analytically using conjugate priors. In generalized filtering, this leads to '''dynamic expectation maximisation'''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;K J Friston, N Trujillo-Barreto, and J Daunizeau, "[http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/DEM%20A%20variational%20treatment%20of%20dynamic%20systems.pdf DEM: A variational treatment of dynamic systems]," Neuroimage, vol. 41, no. 3, pp. 849-85, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; that comprises a D-step that optimizes the sufficient statistics of unknown states, an E-step for parameters and an M-step for precisions.

=== Generalized filtering and predictive coding ===

Generalized filtering is usually used to invert hierarchical models of the following form

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\tilde{s} &amp; =\tilde{{g}}^1 (\tilde{x}^1,\tilde{u}^{(1)})+\tilde{\omega}_s^{(1)} \\ 
\dot{\tilde{x}}^{(1)} &amp; =\tilde{f}^{(1)}(\tilde{x}^{(1)},\tilde{u}^{(1)})+\tilde{\omega}_{x}^{(1)} \\ 
 \vdots \\
\tilde{u}^{(i-1)} &amp; =\tilde{g}^{(i)}(\tilde{x}^{(i)},\tilde{u}^{(i)})+\tilde{\omega}_u^{(i)} \\ 
\dot{\tilde{x}}^{(i)} &amp; =\tilde{f}^{(i)}(\tilde{x}^{(i)},\tilde{u}^{(i)})+\tilde{\omega}_x^{(i)} \\ 
 \vdots
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The ensuing generalized gradient descent on free energy can then be expressed compactly in terms of prediction errors, where (omitting high order terms):

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \dot{\tilde{\mu}}_u^{(i)} &amp; =D\tilde{\mu}^{(u,i)}-\partial_u \tilde{\varepsilon}^{(i)}\cdot \Pi^{(i)}\tilde{\varepsilon}^{(i)}
-\Pi^{(i+1)}\tilde{\varepsilon}_u^{(i+1)} \\ 
 \dot{\tilde{\mu}}_x^{(i)} &amp; =D\tilde{\mu}^{(x,i)}-\partial_x \tilde{\varepsilon}^{(i)}\cdot \Pi^{(i)}\tilde{\varepsilon}^{(i)} \\ 
 \\
 \tilde{\varepsilon}_u^{(i)} &amp; =\tilde{\mu}_u^{(i-1)} -\tilde{g}^{(i)} \\ 
 \tilde{\varepsilon}_x^{(i)} &amp; =D\tilde{\mu}_x^{(i)} -\tilde{f}^{(i)}
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\Pi^{(i)}&lt;/math&gt; is the precision of random fluctuations at the ''i''-th level. This is known as generalized predictive coding [11], with [[linear predictive coding]] as a special case.

== Applications ==

Generalized filtering has been primarily applied to biological timeseries‚Äîin particular functional magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiological data. This is usually in the context of [[dynamic causal modelling]] to make inferences about the underlying architectures of (neuronal) systems generating data.&lt;ref&gt;J Daunizeau, O David, and K E Stephan, "[http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~jdaunize/publications/dcm_review.pdf Dynamic causal modelling: a critical review of the biophysical and statistical foundations]," Neuroimage, vol. 58, no. 2, pp. 312-22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to simulate inference in terms of generalized (hierarchical) predictive coding in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;K Friston, "[http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/Hierarchical%20Models%20in%20the%20Brain.pdf Hierarchical models in the brain]," PLoS Comput. Biol., vol. 4, no. 11, p. e1000211, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection''' ('''GRAND''') is a proposed large-scale detector designed to collect [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray|ultra-high energy cosmic particles]] as [[cosmic rays]], [[neutrino]]s and [[photon]]s with energies exceeding 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; [[Electronvolt|eV]]. This project aims at solving the mystery of their origin and the [[Cosmogony|early stages]] of the universe itself. The proposal, formulated by an international group of researchers, calls for an array of 200,000 receivers to be placed on mountain ranges around the world.

==Overview==

The GRAND detector would search for [[neutrino]]s, exotic particles emitted by some and the [[black hole]]s in the center of galaxies. These neutrinos could help astronomers find the source of other energetic particles called [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray]]s. When neutrinos reach Earth, they often collide with particles either in the air or on the ground, creating showers of secondary particles. These secondary particles can be picked up by the radio antennas, which lets researchers calculate the trajectory of the initial neutrinos and trace them back to their source. &lt;ref name='Gizmodo 2018'&gt; {{cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/astronomers-propose-huge-new-telescope-system-to-unders-1830074459|title=Astronomers Propose Huge New Telescope System to Understand the Most Energetic Particles Ever Detected|author=Ryan F.

The giant radio detector array would comprise 200,000 low-cost antennas in groups of 10,000 spread out over nearly 200,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (80,000 square miles) at different locations around the world.&lt;ref name='PM 2018'/&gt; This would make it the largest detector in the world. Construction, installation and networking the 200,000 antennae, would cost approximately $226 million,&lt;ref name='Gizmodo 2018'/&gt; excluding the price for renting the land and manpower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grand.cnrs.fr/grand/faq/ GRAND - Home site: FAQ].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==

The strategy of GRAND is to detect the radio emission coming from particle showers that develop in the terrestrial atmosphere as a result of the interaction of ultra-high energy (UHE) cosmic rays, gamma rays, and neutrinos. &lt;ref name='Alvarez 2018'/&gt; Astrophysical [[tau neutrino]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|Tauon neutrino}}) can be detected through [[Air shower (physics)|extensive air showers]] (EAS) induced by [[Tau (particle)|tau]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Tau-}}) decays in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name='Present and Perspectives 2017'/&gt; The short-lived tau decays in the atmosphere generates an EAS that emits measurable  electromagnetic emissions up to frequencies of hundreds of [[Hertz|MHz]].&lt;ref name='Present and Perspectives 2017'/&gt; The antennae are foreseen to operate in the 60-200 MHz band to avoid the short-wave background noise at lower frequencies. &lt;ref name='Present and Perspectives 2017'/&gt;

Each individual antenna is a simple [[Batwing antenna|Bow-tie design]], featuring 3 perpendicular bows with an additional vertical arm to sample all three [[Polarization in astronomy|polarization]] directions.&lt;ref name='Alvarez 2018'/&gt; Each antenna is mounted on a single 5-meter-tall pole, and each antenna in the grid is spaced at 1 km within a square grid. If the full array of 200,000 antennae is build, GRAND would reach an [[Flavour (particle physics)|all-flavor]] sensitivity of 4 x10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt; GeV cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;   sr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; above 5 x10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; eV. Because of its sub-degree angular resolution, GRAND will also search for point sources of UHE neutrinos, steady and transient, potentially starting UHE neutrino astronomy, allowing for the discovery and follow-up of large numbers of radio transients, [[fast radio burst]]s, giant radio pulses, and for precise studies of the [[Reionization|epoch of reionization]].&lt;ref name='Alvarez 2018'/&gt;

The researchers estimate that GRAND could allow not just the detection of neutrinos, but could also allow a differentiation of the source types, such as [[galaxy cluster]]s with central sources, fast-spinning newborn [[pulsar]]s, [[active galactic nuclei]], and afterglows of [[gamma-ray burst]]s.&lt;ref name='Present and Perspectives 2017'/&gt;

==Status==

Simulation and experimental work is ongoing on technological development and background rejection strategies. Phase one is called GRANDProto35, that includes 35 antennas and 24 [[scintillator]]s, deployed in the [[Tian Shan|Tian Shan mountains]] in China.&lt;ref name='Present and Perspectives 2017'/&gt; If a pulse is observed simultaneously in the signals from three or more scintillators, the signals are recorded.  As of October 2018, GRANDProto35 is in commissioning phase.&lt;ref name='Alvarez 2018'/&gt; So far, the system achieves 100% detection efficiency for trigger rates up to 20 kHz. 

The following step is planned for 2020, and its is a dedicated setup called GRANDProto300 within an area of 300 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;ref name='Present and Perspectives 2017'/&gt; The baseline layout is a square grid with a 1 km inter-antenna spacing, just as for later stages. Because GRANDProto300 will not be large enough to detect cosmogenic neutrinos, the viability will be tested using instead [[Air shower (physics)|extensive air showers]] initiated by very inclined cosmic rays, thus providing an opportunity to do cosmic-ray science.&lt;ref name='Alvarez 2018'/&gt; The site would be hosted at the Chinese provinces of XinJiang, Inner Mongolia, Yunnan, and Gansu.&lt;ref name='Alvarez 2018'/&gt; If funded, the later phases would build GRAND10k in 2025, and finally GRAND200k (200,000 receivers) in the 2030s.&lt;ref name='Alvarez 2018'/&gt;

This is a glossary for the terminology often encountered in undergraduate [[quantum mechanics]] courses.

'''Cautions:'''
* Different authors may have different definitions for the same term.
* The discussions are restricted to [[Schr√∂dinger picture]] and non-[[relativistic quantum mechanics]].
* Notation:
** &lt;math&gt; | x \rangle &lt;/math&gt; - position eigenstate
** &lt;math&gt;| \alpha \rangle, | \beta \rangle, | \gamma \rangle ...&lt;/math&gt; - wave function of the state of the system
** &lt;math&gt; \Psi &lt;/math&gt; - total wave function of a system
** &lt;math&gt; \psi &lt;/math&gt; - wave function of a system (maybe a particle)
** &lt;math&gt; \psi_\alpha(x,t) &lt;/math&gt; - wave function of a particle in position representation, equal to &lt;math&gt; \langle x | \alpha \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

== Formalism ==

=== Kinematical postulates ===

: The Hermitian conjugate of a ket is called a bra. &lt;math&gt;\langle \alpha| = (|\alpha \rangle)^\dagger&lt;/math&gt;. See "bra‚Äìket notation".

; [[Bra‚Äìket notation]]
: The bra‚Äìket notation is a way to represent the states and operators of a system by angle brackets and vertical bars, for example, &lt;math&gt;| \alpha \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;| \alpha \rangle \langle \beta|&lt;/math&gt;.

; [[Density matrix]]
: Physically, the density matrix is a way to represent pure states and mixed states. The density matrix of pure state whose ket is  &lt;math&gt;|\alpha \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;|\alpha \rangle \langle \alpha|&lt;/math&gt;.
: Mathematically, a density matrix has to satisfy the following conditions:
:* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tr}(\rho) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt;\rho^\dagger = \rho&lt;/math&gt;

; Density operator
: Synonymous to "density matrix".

; Dirac notation
: Synonymous to "bra‚Äìket notation".

; [[Hilbert space]]
: Given a system, the possible pure state can be represented as a vector in a [[Hilbert space]]. Each ray (vectors differ by phase and magnitude only) in the corresponding [[Hilbert space]] represent a state.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Exception: superselection rules&lt;/ref&gt;

; Ket
: A wave function expressed in the form &lt;math&gt;|a\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is called a ket. See "bra‚Äìket notation".

; [[Mixed state (physics)|Mixed state]]
: A mixed state is a statistical ensemble of pure state.
: criterion:
:: Pure state: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tr}(\rho^2) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:: Mixed state: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tr}(\rho^2) &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

; Normalizable wave function
: A wave function &lt;math&gt;|\alpha' \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is said to be normalizable if &lt;math&gt;\langle \alpha'| \alpha' \rangle &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;. A normalizable wave function can be made to be normalized by &lt;math&gt;|a' \rangle \to \alpha = \frac{|\alpha' \rangle}{\sqrt{\langle \alpha'|\alpha' \rangle}}&lt;/math&gt;.

; Normalized wave function
: A wave function &lt;math&gt;| a \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is said to be normalized if &lt;math&gt;\langle a| a \rangle = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

; [[Pure state]]
: A state which can be represented as a wave function / ket in Hilbert space / solution of Schr√∂dinger equation is called pure state. See "mixed state".

; [[Quantum numbers]]
: a way of representing a state by several numbers, which corresponds to a [[complete set of commuting observables]].
: A common example of quantum numbers is the possible state of an electron in a central potential: &lt;math&gt;(n, l, m, s)&lt;/math&gt;, which corresponds to the eigenstate of observables &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; (in terms of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; (magnitude of angular momentum), &lt;math&gt;L_z&lt;/math&gt; (angular momentum in &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-direction), and &lt;math&gt;S_z&lt;/math&gt;.

; Spin wave function
Part of a wave function of particle(s). See "total wave function of a particle".

; Spinor
Synonymous to "spin wave function".

; Spatial wave function
Part of a wave function of particle(s). See "total wave function of a particle".

; [[Quantum state|State]]
: A state is a complete description of the observable properties of a physical system.
: Sometimes the word is used as a synonym of "wave function" or "pure state".

; State vector
: synonymous to "wave function".

; [[Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|Statistical ensemble]]
: A large number of copies of a system.

; [[Physical system|System]]
: A sufficiently isolated part in the universe for investigation.

; [[Tensor product]] of Hilbert space
: When we are considering the total system as a composite system of two subsystems A and B, the wave functions of the composite system are in a Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;H_A \otimes H_B&lt;/math&gt;, if the Hilbert space of the wave functions for A and B are &lt;math&gt;H_A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_B&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

; Total wave function of a particle
: For single-particle system, the total wave function &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; of a particle can be expressed as a product of spatial wave function and the spinor. The total wave functions are in the tensor product space of the Hilbert space of the spatial part (which is spanned by the position eigenstates) and the Hilbert space for the spin.

; Wave function
: The word "wave function" could mean one of following:
:# A vector in Hilbert space which can represent a state; synonymous to "ket" or "state vector".
:# The state vector in a specific basis. It can be seen as a [[covariant vector]] in this case.
:# The state vector in position representation, e.g. &lt;math&gt;\psi_\alpha(x_0) = \langle x_0 | \alpha \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;| x_0 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the position eigenstate.

===Dynamics===
{{Main|Schr√∂dinger equation}}

; Degeneracy
: See "degenerate energy level".

;Degenerate energy level
: If the energy of different state (wave functions which are not scalar multiple of each other) is the same, the energy level is called degenerate.
: There is no degeneracy in 1D system.

; Energy spectrum
: The energy spectrum refers to the possible energy of a system.
: For bound system (bound states), the energy spectrum is discrete; for unbound system (scattering states), the energy spectrum is continuous.
:: ''related mathematical topics: [[Sturm‚ÄìLiouville equation]]''

; [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] &lt;math&gt;\hat H&lt;/math&gt;
: The operator represents the total energy of the system.

; [[Schr√∂dinger equation]]
:: &lt;math&gt;i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} |\alpha\rangle = \hat H | \alpha \rangle&lt;/math&gt; -- (1)
: (1) is sometimes called "Time-Dependent Schr√∂dinger equation" (TDSE).

; Time-Independent Schr√∂dinger Equation (TISE)
: A modification of the Time-Dependent Schr√∂dinger equation as an eigenvalue problem. The solutions are energy eigenstate of the system.
:: &lt;math&gt;E \alpha \rangle = \hat H | \alpha \rangle&lt;/math&gt; -- (2)

====Dynamics related to single particle in a potential / other spatial properties====
::In this situation, the SE is given by the form
:::&lt;math&gt;i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi_\alpha(\mathbf{r},\,t) = \hat H \Psi = \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r})\right)\Psi_\alpha(\mathbf{r},\,t) = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\Psi_\alpha(\mathbf{r},\,t) + V(\mathbf{r})\Psi_\alpha(\mathbf{r},\,t)&lt;/math&gt;
:: It can be derived from (1) by considering &lt;math&gt; \Psi_\alpha(x,t) := \langle x |\alpha\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \hat H := -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + \hat V&lt;/math&gt;

; Bound state
: A state is called bound state if its position probability density at infinite tends to zero for all the time. Roughly speaking, we can expect to find the particle(s) in a finite size region with certain probability. More precisely, &lt;math&gt;| \psi( \mathbf{r}, t) |^2 \to 0&lt;/math&gt;  when &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{r}| \to +\infty&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;t &gt;0 &lt;/math&gt;.
: There is a criterion in terms of energy:
:: Let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be the expectation energy of the state. It is a bound state iff &lt;math&gt;E &lt; \operatorname{min}\{ V( r \to - \infty ) ,  V( r \to + \infty ) \}&lt;/math&gt;.

; Position representation and momentum representation
: Position representation of a wave function: &lt;math&gt; \Psi_\alpha(x,t) := \langle x |\alpha\rangle&lt;/math&gt;,
: momentum representation of a wave function: &lt;math&gt; \tilde{\Psi}_\alpha(p,t) := \langle p |\alpha\rangle&lt;/math&gt; ;
: where &lt;math&gt; | x \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is the position eigenstate and &lt;math&gt; | p \rangle &lt;/math&gt; the momentum eigenstate respectively.
: The two representations are linked by [[Fourier transform]].

; Probability amplitude
: A probability amplitude is of the form  &lt;math&gt;\langle \alpha |\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

; [[Probability current]]
: Having the metaphor of probability density as mass density, then probability current &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is the current:
:: &lt;math&gt; J(x,t) = \frac{i \hbar}{2m} ( \psi \frac{\partial \psi^*}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} \psi ) &lt;/math&gt;

: The probability current and probability density together satisfy the [[continuity equation]]:
:: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial }{\partial t}|\psi(x,t)|^2 + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J(x,t)} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

; [[Probability amplitude|Probability density]]
: Given the wave function of a particle, &lt;math&gt;|\psi(x,t)|^2&lt;/math&gt; is the probability density at position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;|\psi(x_0,t)|^2 \, dx&lt;/math&gt; means the probability of finding the particle near &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.

; Scattering state
: The wave function of scattering state can be understood as a propagating wave. See also "bound state".
: There is a criterion in terms of energy:
:: Let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be the expectation energy of the state. It is a scattering state iff &lt;math&gt;E &gt; \operatorname{min}\{ V( r \to - \infty ) ,  V( r \to + \infty ) \}&lt;/math&gt;.

; Square-integrable
: Square-integrable is a necessary condition for a function being the position/momentum representation of a wave function of a bound state of the system.
: Given the position representation &lt;math&gt;\Psi(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; of a state vector of a wave function, square-integrable means:
:: 1D case: &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} |\Psi(x,t)|^2 \, dx &lt; +\infty&lt;/math&gt;.
:: 3D case: &lt;math&gt;\int_{V}   |\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)|^2 \,  dV &lt;  +\infty &lt;/math&gt;.

; Stationary state
: A stationary state of a bound system is an eigenstate of Hamiltonian operator. Classically, it corresponds to standing wave. It is equivalent to the following things:&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Some textbooks (e.g. Cohen Tannoudji, Liboff) define "stationary state" as "an eigenstate of a Hamiltonian" without specific to bound states.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian operator
:* an eigenfunction of Time-Independent Schr√∂dinger Equation
:* a state of definite energy
:* a state which "every expectation value is constant in time"
:* a state whose probability density (&lt;math&gt; |\psi(x,t)|^2&lt;/math&gt;) does not change with respect to time, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}|\Psi(x,t)|^2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

=== Measurement postulates ===
{{Main|Measurement in quantum mechanics}}

; [[Born's rule]]
: The probability of the state &lt;math&gt;| \alpha \rangle&lt;/math&gt; collapse to an eigenstate &lt;math&gt;| k \rangle&lt;/math&gt; of an observable is given by &lt;math&gt;|\langle k | \alpha \rangle|^2&lt;/math&gt;.
; [[Collapse postulate|Collapse]]
: "Collapse" means the sudden process which the state of the system will "suddenly" change to an eigenstate of the observable during measurement.
; [[Eigenstates]]
: An eigenstate of an operator &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a vector satisfied the eigenvalue equation: &lt;math&gt;A |\alpha \rangle = c |\alpha \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar.
: Usually, in bra‚Äìket notation, the eigenstate will be represented by its corresponding eigenvalue if the corresponding observable is understood.

; [[Expectation value]]
: The expectation value &lt;math&gt; &lt;M&gt;&lt;/math&gt; of the observable M with respect to a state &lt;math&gt;| \alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the average outcome of measuring &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; with respect to an ensemble of state &lt;math&gt;| \alpha&lt;/math&gt; .
: &lt;math&gt; &lt;M&gt;&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated by:
:: &lt;math&gt; &lt;M&gt; = \langle \alpha | M | \alpha \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.
: If the state is given by a density matrix &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; &lt;M&gt; = \operatorname{Tr}( M \rho)&lt;/math&gt;.

; [[Hermitian operator]]
: An operator satisfying &lt;math&gt;A = A^\dagger&lt;/math&gt;.
: Equivalently, &lt;math&gt;\langle \alpha | A|\alpha \rangle = \langle \alpha | A^\dagger |\alpha \rangle &lt;/math&gt; for all allowable wave function &lt;math&gt;|\alpha\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

; [[Observable]]
: Mathematically, it is represented by a Hermitian operator.

=== Indistinguishable particles ===
; Exchange

; Intrinsically identical particles
: If the intrinsic properties (properties that can be measured but are independent of the quantum state, e.g. charge, total spin, mass) of two particles are the same, they are said to be (intrinsically) identical.

; [[Indistinguishable particles]]
: If a system shows measurable differences when one of its particles is replaced by another particle, these two particles are called distinguishable.

; [[Boson]]s
:Bosons are particles with integer [[Spin (physics)|spin]] (''s'' = 0, 1, 2, ... ). They can either be elementary (like [[photon]]s) or composite (such as [[mesons]], nuclei or even atoms). There are five known elementary bosons: the four force carrying gauge bosons Œ≥ (photon), g ([[gluon]]), Z ([[Z boson]]) and W ([[W boson]]), as well as the [[Higgs boson]].

; [[Fermion]]s
:Fermions are particles with half-integer spin (''s'' = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, ... ). Like bosons, they can be elementary or composite particles. There are two types of elementary fermions: [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s, which are the main constituents of ordinary matter.

HerpMapper's primary goal is to share data with professional conservation and research organizations to better conserve [[herpetofauna]] around the world. Because of this, HerpMapper does not share point-location information publicly because of over-collection and [[poaching]] concerns. This sets HerpMapper apart from many other citizen-science projects.

== History ==
[http://www.herpmapper.org/ HerpMapper.org] was officially launched in September 2013. It is currently a volunteer-run organization of professional herpetologists, IT specialists, and field herpers with decades of experience. HerpMapper is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.

== Organizational Structure ==
The HerpMapper Advisory Team includes nonprofit organization staff, state agency [[biologists]], university faculty, [[Information technology|IT]] professionals, and field [[herpers]] with decades of experience. Learn more on the [http://www.herpmapper.org/about About Us] webpage.

== Data Access ==
Data are made freely available to professional conservation and research organizations. Data are made available via real-time online access or via one-time data transfers.

'''Image analysis''' is the extraction of meaningful information from [[image]]s; mainly from [[digital image]]s by means of [[digital image processing]] techniques.&lt;ref name="solomonbreckon10fundamentals"&gt;{{cite book| author=Solomon, C.J., Breckon, T.P.| title=Fundamentals of Digital Image Processing: A Practical Approach with Examples in Matlab| year=2010| publisher=Wiley-Blackwell| doi=10.1002/9780470689776| isbn=978-0470844731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Image analysis tasks can be as simple as reading [[barcode|bar code]]d tags or as sophisticated as [[facial recognition system|identifying a person from their face]].

[[Computer]]s are indispensable for the analysis of large amounts of data, for tasks that require complex computation, or for the extraction of quantitative information.  On the other hand, the human [[visual cortex]] is an excellent image analysis apparatus, especially for extracting higher-level information, and for many applications &amp;mdash; including medicine, security, and remote sensing &amp;mdash; human analysts still cannot be replaced by computers.  For this reason, many important image analysis tools such as [[edge detection|edge detectors]] and [[neural networks]] are inspired by human [[visual perception]] models.

==Digital==
Digital Image Analysis or Computer Image Analysis is when a computer or electrical device automatically studies an image to obtain useful information from it. Note that the device is often a computer but may also be an electrical circuit, a digital camera or a mobile phone. 
It involves the fields of [[computer vision|computer]] or [[machine vision]], and [[medical imaging]], and makes heavy use of [[pattern recognition]], [[digital geometry]], and [[signal processing]].  This field of [[computer science]] developed in the 1950s at academic institutions such as the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] A.I. Lab, originally as a branch of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[robotics]].

It is the [[quantitative property|quantitative]] or [[Qualitative property|qualitative]] characterization of [[two-dimensional]] (2D) or [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] (3D) [[digital images]]. 2D images are, for example, to be analyzed in [[computer vision]], and 3D images in [[medical imaging]]. The field was established in the 1950s‚Äî1970s, for example with pioneering contributions by [[Azriel Rosenfeld]], [[Herbert Freeman]], [[Jack E. Bresenham]], or [[King-Sun Fu]].

==Techniques==
There are many different techniques used in automatically analysing images. Each technique may be useful for a small range of tasks, however there still aren't any known methods of image analysis that are generic enough for wide ranges of tasks, compared to the abilities of a human's image analysing capabilities. Examples of image analysis techniques in different fields include:
* 2D and 3D [[object recognition]],
* [[Segmentation (image processing)|image segmentation]], 
* [[motion detection]] e.g. [[Single particle tracking]], 
* [[video tracking]], 
* [[optical flow]], 
* [[Medical imaging|medical scan analysis]], 
* [[3D Pose Estimation]], 
* [[automatic number plate recognition]].

==Applications==
The applications of digital image analysis are continuously expanding through all areas of science and industry, including:
*[[plate reader|assay micro plate reading]], such as detecting where a chemical was manufactured.
*[[astronomical image processing|astronomy]], such as calculating the size of a planet.
*[[defense (military)|defense]]
*[[Error level analysis]]
*[[filter (software)|filter]]ing &lt;!-- get a more specific link, and-or examples --&gt;
*[[machine vision]], such as to automatically count items in a factory conveyor belt.
*[[materials science]], such as determining if a metal weld has cracks. &lt;!-- get a more specific link--&gt;
*[[medical image processing|medicine]], such as detecting cancer in a mammography scan.
*[[metallography]], such as determining the mineral content of a rock sample.
*[[microscope image processing|microscopy]], such as counting the germs in a swab.
*[[optical character recognition]], such as automatic license plate detection.
*[[remote sensing]], such as detecting intruders in a house, and producing land cover/land use maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xie|first1=Y.|last2=Sha|first2=Z.|last3=Yu|first3=M.|title=Remote sensing imagery in vegetation mapping: a review|journal=Journal of Plant Ecology|date=2008|volume=1|issue=1|pages=9‚Äì23|doi=10.1093/jpe/rtm005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilschut|first1=L.I.|last2=Addink|first2=E.A.|last3=Heesterbeek|first3=J.A.P.|last4=Dubyanskiy|first4=V.M.|last5=Davis|first5=S.A.|last6=Laudisoit|first6=A.|last7=Begon|first7=M.|last8=Burdelov|first8=L.A.|last9=Atshabar|first9=B.B.|last10=de Jong|first10=S.M|title=Mapping the distribution of the main host for plague in a complex landscape in Kazakhstan: An object-based approach using SPOT-5 XS, Landsat 7 ETM+, SRTM and multiple Random Forests|journal=International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation|date=2013|volume=23|issue=100|pages=81‚Äì94|doi=10.1016/j.jag.2012.11.007|pmid=24817838|pmc=4010295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Object-based==
{{split section|Object-based image analysis|date=May 2016}}
[[File:Object based image analysis.jpg|thumb|Image segmentation during the
object base image analysis]]
''Object-Based Image Analysis'' (OBIA) employs two main processes, segmentation and classification.  Traditional image segmentation is on a per-pixel basis.  However, OBIA groups pixels into homogeneous objects.  These objects can have different shapes and scale.   Objects also have statistics associated with them which can be used to classify objects.  Statistics can include geometry, context and texture of image objects.  The analyst defines statistics in the classification process to generate for example [[land cover]]. The technique is implemented in software such as [[eCognition]] or the [[Orfeo toolbox]].

{{anchor|GEOBIA}}When applied to earth images, OBIA is known as ''Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis'' (GEOBIA), defined as "a sub-discipline of [[geoinformation]] science devoted to (...) partitioning [[remote sensing]] (RS) imagery into meaningful image-objects, and assessing their characteristics through spatial, spectral and temporal scale".&lt;ref&gt;G.J. Hay &amp; G. Castilla: ''Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA): A new name for a new discipline.'' In: T. Blaschke, S. Lang &amp; G. Hay (eds.): Object-Based Image Analysis ‚Äì Spatial Concepts for Knowledge-Driven Remote Sensing Applications. Lecture Notes in Geoinformation and Cartography, 18. Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg, Germany: 75-89 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
The international GEOBIA conference has been held biannually since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing/special_issues/geobia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Object-based image analysis is also applied in other fields, such as cell biology or medicine. It can for instance detect changes of cellular shapes in the process of cell differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salzmann|first=M.|last2=Hoesel|first2=B.|last3=Haase|first3=M.|last4=Mussbacher|first4=M.|last5=Schrottmaier|first5=W.

==Dynamics of the inclination instability==

In a flat disk of objects with eccentric orbits a small initial vertical [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]] is amplified by the inclination instability. The initial perturbation exerts an vertical force. On very long timescales relative to the period of an object's orbit this force produces a net [[torque]] on the orbit due to the object spending more time near aphelion. This torque causes the plane of the orbit to roll on its major axis. In a disk this results in the orbits rolling with respect to each other so that the orbits are no longer co-planar. The gravity of the objects now exerts forces on each other that are out of planes of their orbits. Unlike the force due to the initial perturbation these forces are in opposite directions, up and down respectively, on the inbound and outbound portions of their orbits. The resulting torque causes their orbits to rotate about their minor axes, lifting their aphelia, causing the disk to form a cone. The angular momentum of the orbit is also increased due to this torque resulting in reduction of the eccentricity of the orbits. The inclination instability requires an initial eccentricity of 0.6 or larger, and saturates when inclinations reach ~1 radian, after which orbits precess due to the gravity toward the cone's [[axis of symmetry]].&lt;ref name="Madigan_etal_2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Madigan |first1=Ann-Marie |last2=Zderic |first2=Alexander |last3=McCourt |first3=Michael |last4=Fleisig |first4=Jacob |title=On the Dynamics of the Inclination Instability |date=2018 |journal=The Astronomical Journal |volume=156 |issue=4 |page=141 |arxiv=1805.03651 |doi=10.3847/1538-3881/aad95c |

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11877">'''Institutional logic''' is a core concept in  [[sociological theory]] and [[organizational studies]]. It focuses on how broader belief systems shape the [[cognition]] and behavior of actors.&lt;ref&gt;Friedland &amp; Alford, 1991; [[Michael Lounsbury|Lounsbury]], 2007; Thornton, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedland and Alford (1991) defined Institutions as "both supraorganizational patterns of activity by which individuals and organizations produce and reproduce their material subsistence and organize time and space. They are also symbolic systems, ways of ordering reality, thereby rendering experience of time and space meaningful".&lt;ref&gt;Friedland, Roger, and Robert R. Alford.  1991.  Bringing Society Back in: Symbols, Practices, and Institutional Contradictions.  Pp. 232-266 in The New Institutionalism in Organizational Analysis, edited by Walter W. Powell and Paul J. DiMaggio. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Thornton and Ocasio (1999: 804) define institutional logics as "the socially constructed, historical patterns of material practices, assumptions, values, beliefs, and rules by which individuals produce and reproduce their material subsistence, organize time and space, and provide meaning to their social reality".&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, Patricia, H. and William Ocasio (2008). ‚ÄúInstitutional Logics,‚Äù in Royston Greenwood, Christine Oliver, Kerstin Sahlin and Roy Suddaby (eds.) Handbook of Organizational Institutionalism, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Focusing on macro-[[societal]] phenomena, Friedland and Alford (1991: 232) identified several key Institutions: the [[Capitalist]] market, [[bureaucratic]] state, [[democracy]], [[nuclear family]], and [[Christianity]] that are each guided by a distinct institutional logic. Thornton (2004) revised Friedland and Alford‚Äôs (1991) inter-institutional scheme to six institutional orders, i.e., the market, the corporation, the professions, the state, the family, and religions. More recently, Thornton, Ocasio and Lounsbury (2012), in more fully fleshing out the institutional logic perspective, added community as another key institutional order. This revision to a theoretically abstract and analytically distinct set of ideal types makes it useful for studying multiple logics in conflict and consensus, the hybridization of logics, and institutions in other parts of society and the world. While building on Friedland and Alford‚Äôs scheme, the revision addresses the confusion created by conflating institutional sectors with ideology (democracy) and means of organization (bureaucracy), variables that can be characteristic several different institutional sectors. The institutional logic of Christianity leaves out other religions in the US and other religions that are dominant in other parts of the world. Thornton and Ocasio (2008) discuss the importance of not confusing the ideal types of the inter-institutional system with a description of the empirical observations in a study‚Äîthat is to use the ideal types as meta theory and method of analysis.

== New institutionalism ==
[[Organizational theorist]]s operating within the [[new institutionalism]] (see also [[institutional theory]]) have begun to develop the institutional logics concept by empirically testing it. One variant emphasizes how logics can focus the attention of key decision-makers on a particular set of issues and solutions (Ocasio, 1997), leading to logic-consistent decisions (Thornton, 2002).  A fair amount of research on logics has focused on the importance of dominant logics and shifts from one logic to another (e.g., Lounsbury, 2002; Thornton, 2002; Suddaby &amp; Greenwood, 2005).  Haveman and Rao (1997) showed how the rise of Progressive thought enabled a shift in savings and loan organizational forms in the U.S. in the early 20th century.  Scott et al. (2000) detailed how logic shifts in healthcare led to the valorization of different actors, behaviors and governance structures.  Thornton and Ocasio (1999) analyzed how a change from professional to market logics in U.S. higher education publishing led to corollary changes in how executive succession was carried out.

While much earlier work focused on ambiguity as a result of multiple and conflicting institutional logics, at the levels of analysis of society and individual roles,&lt;ref&gt;(Boltanski and Thevenot ([1986] 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Friedland and Alford (1991:248-255) discussed in theory multiple and competing logics at the macro level of analysis. Recent empirical research, inspired by the work of [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]], is developing a more pluralistic approach by focusing on multiple competing logics and contestation of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;(Lounsbury, 2007; Marquis &amp; Lounsbury, 2007; Schneiberg, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  By focusing on how some fields are composed of multiple logics, and thus, multiple forms of institutionally-based rationality, institutional analysts can provide new insight into practice variation and the dynamics of practice.&lt;ref&gt;(see Lounsbury, 2001; Lounsbury &amp; Crumley, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Multiple logics can create diversity in practice by enabling variety in cognitive orientation and contestation over which practices are appropriate.  As a result, such multiplicity can create enormous ambiguity, leading to logic blending, the creation of new logics, and the continued emergence of new practice variants.  Thornton, Jones, and Kury (2005) showed how competing logics may never resolve but share the market space as in the case of architectural services.

Recent research has also documented the co-existence or potential conflict of multiple logics within particular organizations. Zilber (2002), for example, described the organizational consequences of a shift from one logic to another within an Israeli rape crisis center, in which new organization members reshaped the center and its practices to reflect a new dominant logic that they have carried into the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Zilber, T. B. (2002). "Institutionalization as an Interplay between Actions, Meanings, and Actors: The Case of a Rape Crisis Center in Israel." Academy of Management Journal, 45(1), 234-254.&lt;/ref&gt; Tilcsik (2010) documented a logic shift in a post-Communist government agency, describing a conflict between the agency's old guard (carriers of the logic of Communist state bureaucracies) and its new guard (carriers of a market logic). This study shows that, paradoxically, an intra-organizational group's efforts to resist a particular logic might in fact open the organization's door to carriers of that very logic.&lt;ref&gt;Tilcsik, A. (2010). "From ritual to reality: Demography, ideology, and decoupling in a post-communist government agency." Academy of Management Journal, 53(6), 1474-1498. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1494035 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; Almandoz (2012) examined the embeddedness of new local banks' founding teams in a community logic or a financial logic, linking institutional logics to new banking venture's establishment and entrepreneurial success.&lt;ref&gt;Almandoz, J. (2012). "Arriving at the Starting Line: The Impact of Community and Financial Logics on New Banking Ventures." Academy of Management Journal.&lt;/ref&gt; As these studies demonstrate, the institutional logics perspective offers valuable insights into important intra-organizational processes affecting organizational practices, change, and success. These studies represent an effort to understand institutional complexity due to conflicting or inconsistent logics within particular organizations, a situation that might results from the entry of new organization members or the layering (or "sedimentation") of new organizational imprints upon old ones over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marquis|first=Christopher|last2=Tilcsik|first2=Andr√°s|date=2013-06-01|title=Imprinting: Toward a Multilevel Theory|url=http://annals.aom.org/content/7/1/195|journal=Academy of Management Annals|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=195‚Äì245|doi=10.1080/19416520.2013.766076|issn=1941-6520|citeseerx=10.1.1.728.6149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Glimcher's research has focused on the [[immune system]]; she is known for early work with [[T cell]] differentiation, her discovery that [[HIVEP3|Schnurri-3]] regulates [[osteoblasts]] which led to a collaboration with [[Merck &amp; Co.]], and her discovery of the role played by [[XBP1|XBP-1]] in [[lipogenesis]] and the [[unfolded protein response]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neill|first1=US|title=A conversation with Laurie Glimcher.|journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation|date=1 July 2016|volume=126|issue=7|pages=2392‚Äì3|pmid=27367182|pmc=4922720|doi=10.1172/jci88964}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sedwick|first=Caitlin|date=2010-04-19|title=Laurie Glimcher: Merging cell biology and immune function|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|volume=189|issue=2|pages=192‚Äì193|doi=10.1083/jcb.1892pi|pmid=20404104|pmc=2856904}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glimcher's role helped discover Schnurri-3 (Shn3 for short) is a large zinc finger protein distantly related to Drosophila.

In February 2016, Laurie Glimcher was named the next president and CEO of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Glimcher was considered for the position for the Dean of Harvard Medical School but turned the position down in order to become the president of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statnews.com/2016/03/01/laurie-glimcher-dana-farber/|title=Recruited to lead Harvard med, 'fearless' scientist chose Dana-Farber|date=2016-03-01|website=STAT|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Dana-Farber, Glimcher is collaborating on research which strives to find methods of combatting cancer from within the human immune system.&lt;ref name="Stat News"/&gt; The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute is an institution that is affiliated with Harvard, as it currently is one of its teaching hospitals. Glimcher, who was the first female dean of any medical school in New York state, became the first female to lead the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

==Research==
Glimcher became interested in immunology during her first year of medical school at Harvard.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; There she took interest dysregulation in [[autoimmune diseases]] and, in her fourth year at Harvard, discovered the protein known as Nk1.1(see [[natural killer T cell]]), which soon became widely recognized across the field of immunology.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; For this discovery, Glimcher became the first woman to receive the [[Soma Weiss]] Award, an honor her father had received 26 years earlier. During this time, Glimcher worked with mentor Bill Paul, who strongly encouraged her to continue her research independently after completing medical school.
During her second year of residency, Glimcher realized why she felt so drawn to this area of research. ‚ÄúWhat always fascinated me was not so much treating patients with disease, but figuring out why they had the disease,‚Äù says Glimcher.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;
Glimcher currently heads her own lab for research in immunology. She has been interested in studying the ties between ER stress system in neurons and immune function and neuro-degeneration.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; Her past work has involved regulation of immune function and has shifted towards osteobiology with a focus on the bone disease [[osteoporosis]]. Her Harvard lab has a three-year contract with Merck for the drug [[Fosamax]], a treatment for osteoporosis.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; Glimcher‚Äôs more current research looks to answer the question, ‚Äúhow does the immune system and the ER stress system in neurons impact neurodegenerative diseases?‚Äù.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

==Awards==
Glimcher is a member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]]. She received the [[L'Or√©al-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science]] in 2014 for her work in the field of immunology and her research regarding the control of immune responses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/priority-areas/gender-and-science/for-women-in-science-programme/2014-awards/ 16th Annual L‚ÄôOR√âAL-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science - 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sedwick|first1=Caitlin|title=Laurie Glimcher: Merging cell biology and immune function|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=19 April 2010|issue=189|pages=192-192|doi=10.1083/jcb.1892pi|pmid=20404104|pmc=2856904|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received the {{ill|Steven C.

== Women's involvement ==
Laurie Glimcher has been considered a champion of women's rights in the scientific by many of her peers. While she was at Harvard, she hired lab technicians with her own research fund to support her postdoctoral fellows after they had babies so that they were allowed to leave by 6. This carried on into Glimcher's involvement with the National Institutes of Health to create a similar postdoc grant program caring for family members.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statnews.com/2016/03/01/laurie-glimcher-dana-farber/|title=Recruited to lead Harvard med, 'fearless' scientist chose Dana-Farber|date=2016-03-01|website=STAT|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glimcher served on the 2005 Larry Summers Task Force for Women in Science and Engineering, where she expressed her disappointment in the rate of progress for women in science. She joined this task force after a controversy was sparked when former Harvard president Larry Summers suggested that women might be able to innately do less in science. Although she was on the Larry Summers committee, Glimcher still believes that there is still more work to be done. She was quoted as saying: "There are not enough women in senior leadership positions, period. It hasn't gotten a heck of a lot better since I was in medical school".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After she was appointed to Cornell's medical school she immediately made changes regarding women's rights. She established paid maternity leave, created day care centers and another postdoc grant program for primary caregivers. Upon arriving at Cornell there were 0 out of 19 clinical department chairs filled by women; as of today there are 2.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== NYBC controversy ==
From October 2015 to February 2016, Glimcher was the target of eight protests by animal rights activists angered by [[New York Blood Center]]'s abandonment of 66 chimpanzees that had been used in medical research; Glimcher was a member of the board of directors,&lt;ref name="Sun" /&gt; which had voted to stop paying for care of the chimpanzees before she joined it.&lt;ref name="Sun" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gorman|first1=James|title=Chimpanzees in Liberia, Used in New York Blood Center Research, Face Uncertain Future|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/29/science/chimpanzees-liberia-new-york-blood-center.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=12 November 2016|date=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/11/living/chimpanzee-liberia-new-york-blood-center-feat/ Chimps in need after U.S. organization withdraws care - CNN.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Glimcher said that the decision was made before her term on the board and said: "As a scientist, I strongly support the ethical and humane treatment of animals used in research.... I have a great respect for these animals and recognize the value they bring in our pursuit of new cures for devastating human diseases."&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cornellsun.com/2015/10/29/weill-cornell-medicine-dean-accused-of-chimp-abandonment/|title=Weill Cornell Medicine Dean Accused of Chimp Abandonment|date=2015-10-30|website=The Cornell Daily Sun|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Blood Center had funded a Liberian lab since 1974 where the chimps had been used for testing of different viruses.

=== File systems optimized for flash memory, solid state media ===
{{Main article|Flash file system}}

Solid state media, such as [[flash memory]], are similar to disks in their interfaces, but have different problems. At low level, they require special handling such as [[wear leveling]] and different [[error detection and correction]] algorithms. Typically a device such as a [[solid-state drive]] handles such operations internally and therefore a regular file system can be used. However, for certain specialized installations (embedded systems, industrial applications) a file system optimized for plain flash memory is advantageous.

* [[exFAT]] ‚Äì [[Microsoft]] proprietary system intended for flash cards (see also [[XCFiles]], an exFAT implementation for [[Wind River Systems|Wind River]] [[VxWorks]] and other embedded operating systems).
* [[ExtremeFFS]] ‚Äì internal filesystem for SSDs.
* [[F2FS]] ‚Äì Flash-Friendly File System. An open source Linux file system introduced by [[Samsung]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTE5OTY |title=Samsung Introduces New Linux File-System: F2FS |publisher=phoronix.com |author=Michael Larabel |date=2011-10-05 |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Flash memory#Flash file systems|FFS2]] (presumably preceded by FFS1), one of the earliest flash file systems.  Developed and patented by [[Microsoft]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=5392427.PN.&amp;OS=PN/5392427&amp;RS=PN/5392427 |title=United States Patent: 5392427 |publisher=Patft.uspto.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[JFFS]] ‚Äì original log structured Linux file system for NOR flash media.
* [[JFFS2]] ‚Äì successor of JFFS, for [[NAND flash#NAND flash|NAND]] and [[NOR flash]].
* [[LSFS]] ‚Äì a [[Log-structured file system]] with writable snapshots and inline data deduplication created by [[StarWind Software]]. Uses DRAM and flash to cache spinning disks. 
* [[LogFS]] ‚Äì intended to replace JFFS2, better scalability. No longer under active development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/9/11/58|title=Linux Kernel Mailing List: logfs: remove from tree|accessdate=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[NILFS]] ‚Äì a log-structured file system for Linux with continuous snapshots.
* [[Non-Volatile File System]] ‚Äì the "non-volatile file system" for [[flash memory]] introduced by [[Palm, Inc.]]
* [[NOVA_(filesystem)|NOVA]] ‚Äì the "non-volatile memory accelerated" file system for persistent main memory.
* [[One File System|OneFS]] ‚Äì a filesystem utilized by [[Isilon Systems|Isilon]]. It supports selective placement of meta-data directly onto flash SSD.
* [[Segger Microcontroller Systems]] emFile ‚Äì filesystem for deeply embedded applications which supports both NAND and NOR flash.  Wear leveling, fast read and write, and very low RAM usage.
* [[SPIFFS]] ‚Äì SPI Flash File System, a wear-leveling filesystem intended for small NOR flash devices.
* [[Transaction-Safe FAT File System|TFAT]] ‚Äì a transactional version of the FAT filesystem.
* [[TrueFFS]] ‚Äì internal file system for SSDs, implementing error correction, bad block re-mapping and wear-leveling.
* [[UBIFS]] ‚Äì successor of JFFS2, optimized to utilize non-volatile DRAM.
* [[Write Anywhere File Layout]] (WAFL) ‚Äì an internal file system utilized by [[NetApp]] within their DataONTAP OS, originally optimized to use non-volatile DRAM. WAFL uses [[Non-standard RAID levels#RAID-DP|RAID-DP]] to protect against multiple disk failures and NVRAM for transaction log replays.
* [[YAFFS]] ‚Äì a log-structured file system designed for NAND flash, but also used with NOR flash.
* [[ZFS]] ‚Äì allows placing write-ahead log (ZIL) on flash, and using flash as a second-level read cache (L2ARC).

=== Record-oriented file systems ===

In [[Record-oriented filesystem|record-oriented file systems]] files are stored as a collection of [[record (computer science)|records]]. They are typically associated with [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] and [[minicomputer]] operating systems. Programs read and write whole records, rather than bytes or arbitrary byte ranges, and can seek to a record boundary but not within records. The more sophisticated record-oriented file systems have more in common with simple [[database]]s than with other file systems.

* [[CMS file system]] ‚Äì The native file system of the [[Conversational Monitor System]] component of [[VM/370]]

=== {{Anchor|SHARED}}Shared-disk file systems ===
Shared-disk file systems (also called ''shared-storage file systems'', [[SAN file system]], [[Clustered file system]] or even ''cluster file systems'') are primarily used in a [[storage area network]] where all nodes directly access the [[Block (data storage)|block storage]] where the file system is located. This makes it possible for nodes to fail without affecting access to the file system from the other nodes. Shared-disk file systems are normally used in a [[high-availability cluster]] together with storage on hardware [[RAID]]. Shared-disk file systems normally do not scale over 64 or 128 nodes.

Shared-disk file systems may be [[symmetric]] where [[metadata]] is distributed among the nodes or [[asymmetry|asymmetric]] with centralized [[metadata]] servers.

=== Distributed parallel file systems ===

Distributed [[Parallel computing|parallel]] file systems stripe data over multiple servers for high performance. They are normally used in [[high-performance computing|high-performance computing (HPC)]].

Some of the distributed parallel file systems use [[object storage device]] (OSD) (In Lustre called OST) for chunks of data together with centralized [[metadata]] servers.

* [[Parallel Virtual File System]] (PVFS, PVFS2, [[OrangeFS]]).  Developed to store virtual system images, with a focus on non shared writing optimizations. Available for [[Linux]] under [[GNU General Public License|GPL]].

=== {{Anchor|DISTRIBUTED-PARALLEL-FAULT-TOLERANT}}Distributed parallel fault-tolerant file systems ===

Distributed file systems, which also are [[Parallel computing|parallel]] and [[fault tolerant]], stripe and replicate data over multiple servers for high performance and to maintain [[data integrity]]. Even if a server fails no data is lost. The file systems are used in both [[high-performance computing|high-performance computing (HPC)]] and [[high-availability cluster]]s.

All file systems listed here focus on [[high availability]], [[scalability]] and high performance unless otherwise stated below.

{{Expand list|date=December 2014}}

This is a '''list of [[open-access journal]]s''' by field. The list contains notable journals which have a policy of full open access. It does not include [[delayed open access journal]]s, [[hybrid open access journal]]s, or related collections or indexing services.

True open-access journals can be split into two categories : 
* [[Open_access_journal#No-fee_open_access_journals|diamond or platinum open-access journals]] (which charge no additional publication, open access or article processing fees) 
* gold open-access journals (which charge publication fees, also called [[article processing charge]]s [APCs]).

The list below is focused on open-access journals with no fees. 
However, some fields like biology and medicine have a stronger tradition of article processing charge,
the corresponding journals below then have a footnote indicating such fees.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt; &lt;!-- See [[Wikipedia talk:Featured lists]] for an explanation of this and other inclusion tags below --&gt;
[[Vegetable oil]]s are [[triglyceride]]s extracted from [[plant]]s. These oils have been part of human culture for millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 | url=http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/001708.html

 | accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edible vegetable oils are used in food, both in [[Cooking oil|cooking]] and as [[Food additive|supplements]]. Many oils, edible and otherwise, are burned as fuel, such as in [[oil lamp]]s and as a substitute for [[petroleum]]-based fuels. Some of the many other uses include [[wood finishing]], [[oil painting]], and [[Skin care products|skin care]].&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

There are several [[types of plant oils]], distinguished by the method used to extract the oil from the plant. The relevant part of the plant may be placed under pressure to extract the [[oil]], giving an [[Ram press (food)|expressed]] (or pressed) oil. The oils included in this list are of this type. Oils may also be extracted from plants by [[solvation|dissolving]] parts of plants in water or another [[solvent]]. The solution may be separated from the plant material and concentrated, giving an extracted or [[Leaching (chemical science)|leached]] oil. The mixture may also be separated by [[distillation|distilling]] the oil away from the plant material. Oils extracted by this latter method are called [[essential oil]]s. Essential oils often have different properties and uses than pressed or leached vegetable oils. Finally, [[List of macerated oils|macerated oils]] are made by infusing parts of plants in a base oil, a process called [[liquid‚Äìliquid extraction]].

The term "vegetable oil" can be narrowly defined as referring only to substances that are liquid at room temperature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Pearson Guide to the B.Sc. (Nursing) Entrance Examination|author=Parwez Saroj|publisher=Pearson Education India|page=109|isbn=978-81-317-1338-9|date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; or broadly defined without regard to a substance's [[state of matter]] at a given temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The International Cocoa Trade|author=Robin Dand|publisher=Woodhead Publishing|year=1999|page=169|isbn=978-1-85573-434-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a large majority of the entries in this list fit the narrower of these definitions, some do not qualify as vegetable oils according to all understandings of the term.

Vegetable oils can be classified in several ways, for example:

* By source: most, but not all vegetable oils are extracted from the [[fruit]]s or [[seed]]s of plants, and the oils may be classified by grouping oils from similar plants, such as "nut oils".
* By use: as described above, oils from plants are used in [[cooking oil|cooking]], for fuel, for cosmetics, for medical purposes, and for other industrial purposes.

The vegetable oils are grouped below in common classes of use.

==Edible oils==

===Major oils===

'''Marion Dietrich''' (1926‚Äì1974) was a pilot and one of the [[Mercury 13]] who underwent the same [[NASA]] testing in the early 1960s as the [[Mercury Seven|Mercury 7]] astronauts.

Born in San Francisco in 1926, Dietrich was the daughter of Richard Dietrich, who worked in the import business, and his wife, Marion. Dietrich began flying at an early age, getting a student pilot certificate at age 16. She and identical twin sister [[Janet Dietrich]] were the only girls in an aviation class at Burlingame High School.

In 1947, Dietrich and sister Janet entered the inaugural Chico-to-San Mateo Air Race and took first place, defeating experienced men. Dietrich graduated from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1949, with degrees in mathematics and psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/astros/diearion.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628182413/http://www.astronautix.com/astros/diearion.htm |archivedate=2011-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After placing in other local racess, the flying twins collected the second-place trophy in the 1951 All-Women's Transcontinental Air Race, known as the [[Powder Puff Derby (1947)|Powder Puff Derby]]. Dietrich worked for a time as a newspaper reporter for the ''[[Oakland Tribune]]'', flying supersonic as a passenger in a fighter aircraft on a story assignment. She also became a commercial transport pilot, flying charter and ferry flights.

In 1960, Dietrich and her sister were among a select group of female aviators invited to the Lovelace Clinic in Albuquerque, where experts had screened potential NASA astronauts. The women underwent the same medical tests and examinations as [[Alan Shepard]], [[John Glenn]], and the other men who eventually traveled into space. The extensive exams included everything from swallowing 3 feet of rubber hose to drinking radioactive water. Though only 5 feet 3&amp;nbsp;inches tall and 100 pounds, Dietrich completed the regimen of tests, as did her sister and 11 other women.&lt;ref name=Lopez&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/06/17/BA4211A0VO.DTL | title=Bay Area pilot Janet Christine Dietrich dies | date=2008-06-17 | access-date=April 20, 2018 | last=Lopez | first=Cory | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | publisher=[[Hearst Communications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the women waited for the next phase of their program in July 1961, the testing was halted without warning or explanation. It would be two more decades before the United States launched its first woman into space, [[Sally Ride]], an astrophysicist turned astronaut.

Dietrich died in 1974 from cancer.

In 2006, the International Women's Air &amp; Space Museum opened an exhibit honoring the Mercury 13 - Mercury Women: Forgotten Link to the Future. And in May 2007, the women of Mercury 13 received honorary doctor of science degrees from the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/06/17/BA4211A0VO.DTL#ixzz1DxgTd0AI&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marrow Adipose Tissue and Hematopoietic Cells ==
[[Hematopoietic]] cells (also known as blood cells) reside in the bone marrow along with marrow adipocytes.  These hematopoietic cells are derived from [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s (HSC) which give rise to diverse cells:  cells of the blood, immune system, as well as cells that break down bone ([[osteoclast]]s). HSC renewal occurs in the marrow [[Stem-cell niche|stem cell nich]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;e, a microenvironment that contains cells and secreted factors that promote appropriate renewal and differentiation of HSC. The study of the [[Stem-cell niche|stem cell niche]] is relevant to the field of [[oncology]] in order to improve therapy for multiple [[hematologic cancer]]s. As such cancers are often treated with [[bone marrow transplantation]], there is interest in improving the renewal of HSC. Recent work demonstrates that marrow adipocytes secrete factors that promote HSC renewal in most bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhou|first=Bo O.|last2=Yu|first2=Hua|last3=Yue|first3=Rui|last4=Zhao|first4=Zhiyu|last5=Rios|first5=Jonathan J.|last6=Naveiras|first6=Olaia|last7=Morrison|first7=Sean J.|title=Bone marrow adipocytes promote the regeneration of stem cells and haematopoiesis by secreting SCF|journal=Nature Cell Biology|volume=19|issue=8|pages=891‚Äì903|doi=10.1038/ncb3570|pmid=28714970|pmc=5536858|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''nanodumbell''' is a pair of spheres attached together that may be made of silica or zinc oxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10854-014-2470-5 |title=Investigation on the influence of dichromate ion on the ZnO nano-dumbbells and ZnCr2O4 nano-walls |journal=Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=821‚Äì829 |year=2014 |last1=Dixit |first1=Tejendra |last2=Palani |first2=I.

They have been used in a [[Purdue University]] experiment where they were made to spin in a vacuum at 60 billion rotations per minute.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/63139-fastest-spinner-nanodumbbell.html|title=What in the Whirled? Tiny, Floating Dumbbell Rotates 60 Billion Times Per Minute|work=Live Science|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The nanodumbbells are first created in the lab using a hydro-thermal process. The resulting dumbbell consists of two joined silica spheres, making it 320 nanometers long and around 170 nanometers wide in size.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Nanodumbbells are also being studied for possible use in [[photodynamic therapy]], a way of treating cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jcis.2017.01.053 |pmid=28167424 |title=Construction of near infrared light triggered nanodumbbell for cancer photodynamic therapy |journal=Journal of Colloid and Interface Science |volume=494 |pages=363‚Äì372 |year=2017 |last1=Hou |first1=Beibei |last2=Zheng |first2=Bin |last3=Yang |first3=Weitao |last4=Dong |first4=Chunhong |last5=Wang |first5=Hanjie |last6=Chang |first6=Jin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experiment==
Highly focused circularly polarized light laser light bombards the levitated dumbbell to set it spinning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Previous records==
The speed of  the rotation is a world record that beats previous records. In 2008, a small motor rotated at 1 million rotations per minute. In 2010, a slice of graphene was made to spin at 60 million spins per minute. Around 2013, a  sphere measuring just 4 micrometers was spun at 600 million spins per minute.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3217">The '''National Radiological Protection Board''' (NRPB) was a [[public authority]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] created by the Radiological Protection Act 1970. Its statutory functions were to conduct research on radiological protection and provide advice and information on the subject to Government Departments and others. It was also authorized to provide technical services and charge for them. Originally NRPB dealt only with [[ionizing radiation]], but its functions were extended in 1974 to [[non-ionizing radiation]].

==Structure==

The Board consisted of a chairman and a maximum of nine other members, later increased to twelve, all appointed by Health Ministers. Throughout its existence, NRPB had 300 members of staff on average. They were located at the headquarters in [[Chilton, Oxfordshire|Chilton]] near [[Oxford]] and at laboratories in [[Leeds]] and [[Glasgow]]. The [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] funded the difference between the cost of NRPB and its income by annual grant.

==Work==

Research on ionizing radiation included: [[plutonium]] exposure; [[internal dosimetry]]; radioactive discharges; [[nuclear accident]]s and [[Nuclear waste|wastes]]; [[radon]] hazards; medical x rays; [[epidemiology]] and [[molecular biology]]. Research on non-ionizing radiation included the physics and biology of exposure to [[Ultraviolet radiation|ultraviolet sources]], [[electricity]] supplies, and [[mobile phone]]s.

As well as a full range of technical services - from personnel dosimetry to radiation surveys - NRPB also engaged in projects such as: the safe transport of [[radioactive material]]s; preparedness for nuclear emergencies; exposure to [[cosmic ray]]s; optimization of protection; improved radiation instruments; training courses; a wide selection of publications.

Members of staff contributed to major public inquiries about the [[nuclear industry]] in the UK and supported the UK response to the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. They also participated in the work of the: [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]]; [[International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection]]; [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]]; [[Nuclear Energy Agency]]; various committees of the [[Commission of the European Communities]].

==Transition==

The Health Protection Agency Act 2004 repealed the Radiological Protection Act. On 1 April 2005, NRPB became the Radiation Protection Division of the [[Health Protection Agency]] (HPA). Under the terms of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, the HPA was abolished, and responsibility for radiation protection functions was assigned to appropriate Government authorities in the UK.

'''Oliver Meredith Boone Bulman''' (20 May 1902 &amp;ndash; 18 February 1974) was a [[UK|British]] [[palaeontologist]]. He was [[Woodwardian Professor of Geology]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].

==Early life==
Oliver Bulman was born in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] to artist Henry Herbert Bulman and his wife Beatrice Elizabeth Boone. He was the second of three children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=C. James Stubblefield|title=Bulman, Oliver Meredith Boone (1902‚Äì1974), rev. R. B. Rickards|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2004| url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30874|accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Bulman went to [[Battersea Grammar School]] in 1910, but wishing to study geology, which the school did not teach, he became an evening, and later day, student at [[Chelsea Polytechnic]]. He gained a London University scholarship in 1920 and went to [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] to study geology and zoology. He graduated with a first class BSc in geology in 1923. Bulman went on to a PhD degree jointly with [[Cyril James Stubblefield|James Stubblefield]] on the lower [[Palaeozoic]] of the  [[Wrekin]] district, of [[Shropshire]] in 1926.

Awarded a senior studentship, he worked for a year on [[Permian]] amphibians with [[Walter Frederick Whittard]] and for two years at [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]], where he studied [[Graptolites#Morphology|dendroid graptolites]] under [[Gertrude Lilian Elles]]. Work on the  [[Palaeontographical Society]]'s monograph ''British Dendroid Graptolites'' (1927 and 1928) earned him a Cambridge PhD degree in 1928. He then worked as demonstrator at Imperial College and at Cambridge. He became [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] in [[palaeozoology]] in 1944 and [[Woodwardian Professor of Geology]] in 1955.

==Honours==
Bulman was elected an [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] in 1940&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; and was president of the geology section of the [[British Association]], the [[Palaeontological Association]] (1960‚Äì62), the [[Geological Society of London|Geological Society]] (1962‚Äì4), and the Palaeontographical Society (1971‚Äì4). The Geological Society awarded him the [[Lyell Medal]] in 1953.

==Private life==
In 1938 he married Marguerite Fearnsides, daughter of [[William George Fearnsides|William Fearnsides]], the professor of geology at Sheffield. They had a son and three daughters. He died at home in Cambridge in 1974, and was cremated.

==Applied and basic research==
As shown in the following table, scientific research can be classified by whether it advances human knowledge by seeking a fundamental understanding of nature, or whether it is primarily motivated by the need to solve immediate problems.

The result is three distinct classes of research:

# Pure applied research, exemplified by the work of [[Thomas Edison]], inventor.
# Use-inspired basic research, described here as "Pasteur's Quadrant".

Pasteur's quadrant is useful in distinguishing various perspectives within science, engineering and technology. For example, [[Daniel A. Vallero]] and Trevor M. Letcher in their book ''Unraveling Environmental Disasters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Daniel A. |last1= Vallero |first2= Trevor M. |last2= Letcher |title= Unraveling Environmental Disasters |publisher= [[Elsevier]] Academic Press |date= 2012 |isbn= 9780123970268 |url= http://store.elsevier.com/Unraveling-Environmental-Disasters/isbn-9780123973177/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; applied the device to disaster preparedness and response. University science programs are concerned with knowledge-building, whereas engineering programs at the same university will apply existing and emerging knowledge to address specific technical problems. Governmental agencies employ the knowledge from both to solve societal problems.{{cn|date=May 2017}} Thus, the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] expects its engineers to apply general scientific principles to design and upgrade flood control systems. This entails selecting the best levee designs for the hydrologic conditions. However, the engineer would also be interested in more basic science to enhance designs in terms of water retention and soil strength. The university scientist is much like Bohr, with the major motivation being new knowledge. The governmental engineer is behaving like Edison, with the greatest interest in utility, and considerably less interest in knowledge for knowledge's sake.

The university engineering researcher's interests on the other hand, may fall between Bohr and Edison, looking to enhance both knowledge and utility. It is not likely that many single individuals fall within the Pasteur cell, since both basic and applied science are highly specialized. Thus, modern science and technology employ what might be considered a [[systems engineering]] approach, where the Pasteur cell consists of numerous researchers, professionals and practitioners to optimize solutions.  Note that modifications to the quadrant model to more precisely reflect how research and development interact continue to be suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= John M. |last= Dudley |title= Defending Basic Research |journal= Nature Photonics |volume= 7 |pages= 338‚Äì339 |date= 2013 |doi= 10.1038/nphoton.2013.105 |url= http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v7/n5/full/nphoton.2013.105.html |bibcode= 2013NaPho...7..338D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nano Seed Priming''' in [[botany]] and [[agriculture]] is a form of [[seed]] planting preparation in which the seeds are pre-soaked in nanoparticle solution.Seeds are considered to be an important part of crop life cycle as it influences the propagation of critical phases like germination and dormancy. Seed priming before sowing is considered to be one of the promising ways to provide value-added solutions to maximize the natural potential of seed to set the plant for maximum yield potential with respect to both quality and quantity. Positive effect on the shoot and root growth of seedlings of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) when treated with iron-oxide nanoparticles. This innovative cost-effective and user-friendly method of biofortification has proven to increase grain iron deposition upon harvesting. Hence, the intervention of nanotechnology in terms of seed priming could be an economical and user-friendly smart farming approach to increase the nutritive value of the grains in an eco-friendly manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Priming is not an extremely widely used method. In general, most kinds of seeds experimented with so far have shown an overall advantage over seeds that are not primed.  Many have shown a faster emergence time (the time it takes for seeds to rise above the surface of the soil), a higher emergence rate (the number of seeds that make it to the surface), and better growth, suggesting that the [[head start (positioning)|head-start]] helps them get a good root system down early and grow faster.  This method can be useful to farmers because it saves them the money and time spent for fertilizers, re-seeding, and weak plants.

In process tracing studies, multiple data points are collected in comparison to simple input-output methods, where only one measurement per task is available.

==Thinking aloud==

Thinking aloud protocols are a type of verbal protocols, used for eliciting and analyzing verbal data. Once transcribed, the verbalizations can be categorized into a defined scheme. This makes the data manageable.

A thinking aloud protocol is one way to assess cognitive processes by letting people verbalize aloud what they currently think (concurrent verbal protocol) or what they were thinking (retrospective verbal protocol) while performing a task. Furthermore, depending on the type of the question asked, it can be distinguished structured verbal protocols and unstructured verbal protocols.

It is assumed that the report of this verbal stream can be used as a proxy for the content of working memory and hence reflects the cognitive processes while performing a task. Verbal protocols can be used in any research that focusses on understanding cognitive processes. Specifically, thinking aloud protocols can be helpful to study human decision making.&lt;ref name="Schulte-Mecklenbeck, K√ºhberger, &amp; Ranyard, 2011"/&gt;

===Historical background===

The use of thinking aloud protocols was introduced into decision process analysis in the 1970s by Montgomery and Svenson. Since then, the method has continually developed and has made valuable contributions to decision research.&lt;ref name="Schulte-Mecklenbeck, K√ºhberger, &amp; Ranyard, 2011"/&gt;

===Procedure (Walker, 2004)===
* data collection
1) development of the task, based upon a hypothesis&lt;br /&gt;
2) instruction and training of the participant&lt;br /&gt;
3) recording audio of the performance

* data reduction/content analysis
4) transcription of the verbalizations&lt;br /&gt;
5) definition of units of analysis (components, sequences, or complete models)&lt;br /&gt;
6) definition of exclusive and exhaustive encoding categories&lt;br /&gt;
7) encoding of the units of analysis into this scheme

* analysis and interpretation
8) quantification of the prevalence of components&lt;br /&gt;
9) interpretation, in terms of the theory

===The quality of verbal protocols in decision research===
The quality of thinking aloud protocols depends on characteristics of the decision problem, as complexity, familiarity, importance, or whether singular or repeated. It is recommended to construct a decision problem with a medium level of complexity and importance and a low level of familiarity and little repetition.&lt;ref name="Schulte-Mecklenbeck, K√ºhberger, &amp; Ranyard, 2011"/&gt;

===Measurement criteria using thinking aloud protocols===
One general problem with thinking aloud protocols is their validity (Russo, Johnson &amp; Stephens, 1989). We cannot prove whether the participant really says what he is thinking. Particularly the validity of retrospective verbal protocols is debatable.
Verbal protocols are vulnerable to non-veridicality. A verbal protocol lacks of veridicality if it fails to adequately represent the process that should be described. Errors of omission and errors of commission are typical reasons for a non-veridical measurement. Errors of omission happen if thoughts that are part of the process are not mentioned. Errors of commission happen if the verbal protocol contains statements about thoughts that were not actually part of the process.

Another important problem is the potential reactivity of concurrent verbal protocols . A verbal protocol is reactive if the verbalization process changes the cognitive process (Russo, Johnson &amp; Stephens, 1989). This is particularly problematical when asking the participant why he‚Äôs doing something.

Finally thinking aloud protocols have the problem of reliability because of possibly biased interpretation of the researcher. Statements about the participants ‚Äûthinking steps‚Äù have to be transcribed and coded into a categorization scheme. This requires training in order to overcome the possibly biased interpretation of these verbalizations (Trickett &amp; Trafton, 2009).

How to deal with these problems
It is important to obtain a cross-validation of findings from verbal data, e.g. with physiological or neural correlates.&lt;ref name="Schulte-Mecklenbeck, K√ºhberger, &amp; Ranyard, 2011"/&gt; Furthermore it is recommended to add a silent control condition. Only then can we assess the influence that verbalization has on the primary process. Finally, to establish the interrater reliability, more than one researcher should code and interpret the data.

===Advantages and disadvantages of verbal protocols===
According to (Walker, 2004):
;Disadvantages
* time-consuming
* validity
* reactivity

;Advantages
* rich data source 
* naturalistic settings
* insight into cognitive processes

==Eye tracking==

As eye fixations are ‚Äúthe‚Äù way that humans gather information and every decision requires the acquisition of information it becomes obvious that eye tracking is a way of investigating decision processes with a lot of potential. Yet the method is still underutilized.&lt;ref name="Schulte-Mecklenbeck, K√ºhberger, &amp; Ranyard, 2011"/&gt;

Advantages of eye tracking are that it is possible to trace a lot of information used during a decision task, it can sometimes be applied as a substitute for working memory and because eye movement are not so well controllable and difficult to censor, they can be recorded nonreactively.

However, there are also problems one has to deal with when working with the eye tracking method. Most of times an eye tracker is not part of a standard lab and it is still expensive. Another, more functional problem is the interpretation of eye fixations: The data reveals where participants are looking, but not what they actually are thinking. Yet, this is exactly what we want to find out more about.

In cognitive psychology studies, the mostly concerned movements are saccades. During these movements no information can be acquired, because the vision is suppressed. This makes it very interesting especially for judgment and decision making tasks.

===Objects of regard===
Eye fixation data could be used to test predictions: For example that magic tricks work because of misdirecting the eye gaze and failing to actually see what happens even if it happens right in front of ones eyes. One can also compare eye fixations between two groups: between experts and novices or a healthy and clinical population.
By looking at the distribution of fixations the investigation of display properties becomes possible.  For example varying the size of products‚Äô displays drives fixations‚Äô amount, which is predictive for sales. This design does not enable causal hypothesis testing, however with the suitable design, the distribution of fixations could answer causal questions as well.
Studies show that fixation frequencies are an indicator of relative importance: the more fixations on an alternative the greater the importance of this alternative. It has been shown that the frequency of fixations on an attribute can also be transformed into a rank order of the attributes
The fixation order tells us something about the evaluation of objects. Particularly the first and last fixations can point out important features of the decision making process.
Russo (1994) defined sequences of fixations as different stages. The fixations before any refixations are defined as an initial phase of orientation or screening. The last fixations should reflect the elimination of alternatives as a last checking phase prior to the announcement of ones choice.

===Time Measures===
The total time fixation as well as the total time of a sequence of fixations can reveal important aspects of the decision process.
The mean fixation duration is an indicator of the processing depth or effort, and thus, reveal an important aspect of the decision process too. There is evidence ( Pieters and Warlop, 1999) that fixation duration on a chosen brand is longer than on a nonchosen alternative. There are mostly pair comparison and fixation duration is indicating that there are different checking processes (Russo &amp; Leclerec, 1994).
Open question: Duration of saccade may improve the accuracy of the total duration.
Sequences of fixation
There are within-alternative and between attributes transitions. The definition of by-alternative processing is a fixation transition within an attribute between alternatives. A single transition within an attribute but between alternatives is defined as by-attribute processing. There is evidence that an increase in involvement (heightened by giving participants whichever brand they chose) not only led to longer fixation durations but also to more by-brand and fewer by-attribute transitions. ( Van Raaij, 1977)
There are research that focus on how to distinguish between these two processes, such as Russo &amp; Dosher (1983). They defined by-alternative processing as sequence that all three attributes had to be fixated without interruption. A by-attribute comparisons required contiguous by-attribute evaluations of all three attribute. There is evidence that by-attribute processing is the preferred process for decision making (Arieli et al., 2009), even if it is not possible to decide accurately e.g. between two gambles without by-alternative processing.
Eye fixations as complementary data
Different kinds of verbal protocol and eye fixation as a complementary data were compared (Gog et al., 2005). Such analysis reveals more information than only a single method.
Fixations as a monitor of attention
Some experiments investigate the peripheral process. In such studies, it is essential to ensure that an individual gaze at a fixation point and to identify if the eye has moved. With the gaze-contingent stimulus alteration (McConkie &amp; Rayner, 1975) it can be imposed whererver an individual is currently looking. With this method the impact of emotional words, when presented parafoveally (Calvo &amp; Castillo, 2009) and the left hemisphere advantage for peripherally presented words (Jordan et al., 2009).
Critics:
-	Eye fixation show where people are looking, but not what they are thinking. A clear interpretation is hardly doable as a fixation e.g. can occur to an elimination or to another consideration of other alternatives, or it can be learning or eliminating.
-	There are only a few JDM theories that specify a decision process at the level of fixations on individual alternatives or even smaller units such as individual attributes. (e.g., a theory that propose a more or less continuously developing decision process or another theory that addresses a model of the differentiation of value over time).

History: Eye tracking for information of cognitive activity of decisions. [History of Eye tracking is already described in Wikipedia]
Russo investigated 1978 in different methods of process tracing, such as eye tracking, verbal protocol or  information display boards. They assume that different methods have different advantages and disadvantages. Further, they propose that a combined usage of different methods may reveal more information of process tracing background than a single method. They define eye fixation as a method with high quality but mention the difficulty of a valid interpretation and the difficulty to isolate relevant cognitive parts of behaviour.
A big step forward in process tracing with the method eye tracking is provided from Russo &amp; Leclerc (1994).

Why use eye tracking to measure decision processes?
One potential of the eye tracking method is that new theories, predicting behavior at the level of eye fixation might elicit, thus entail the possibility to find out more about decision processes. At the same time it brings up the question how process based theories should look like in the future

In the eye of eye tracking data, how should process based theories look like?
Why move from simple theories to the complex detail of process-based theories? ‚Äì depends on paradigm
What kind of jdm processes might eye fixation data illuminate?
Example: Identifying heuristics (1. Approximate one attribute to zero, either because its difference was small or its importance was negligible. 2. Count majority of confirming attributes)
Data might prompt the devising of experimental designs and visual displays that could provide a new class of tests
Investigation of already existing heuristics. Preference drives perception: People look more at what they prefer. ‚Äì Will inducing people to look at a stimulus longer or more often increases their preference for it? Will attention drive preference?

Eye fixations are the primary way that humans acquire information. To be able to use this immense amount of data, JDM theories need to be developed that require such detailed information acquisition data.

==Mouselab==
Mouselab is a computer program that records information acquisition. The basic idea behind process techniques is the record of eye movements. Mouselab, as a computer-based technique, models eye movements by mouse movements.
The information is presented in information cells which are ranged in a matrix. They are covered by an overlay, but can be opened by moving the mouse pointer across the information cell. During the time the cursor is in the cell, information can be acquired.
Mouselab is harken back to the information board idea (e.g. Payne 1976). Here, the information is hidden in envelopes attached to a cardboard. To obtain information, a card has to be pulled out.

===Designing===
For setting up a Mouselab study, there are two programs which can be used online and offline (e.g. MouselabWeb; Willemsen &amp; Johnson, 2008). The way information is displayed or labeled can have a huge influence on the decision.
Presenting the information in a certain order can lead to effects which might be a result of display layout (e.g. people tend todward following the natural reading order, which influences the starting box). Counterbalancing the position of different types of information can help to antagonize ordering effects. Exact labeling of the cells can prevent exploratory search - interpretation of information acquisition is easier when the participants focused on  the text in the cells. Information in the cells should not be too simple, because participants might memorize the content and therefore stop acquisition.

===Process Data===
The output of a MouselabStudy consists of hundreds of information pieces. Variables that are measured are: Time per trial, average looking at each box, the number of acquisitions, time between acquisitions.
Unmotivated participants can be identified by unrealistically short trial times and unrealistically long ones or long times between acquisitions. About 5-10% of the observations have to be removed from analysis. Very short acquisitions, due to mouse movements, are filtered out (less than 200ms).

The process data can be presented by icon graphs (Johnson et al. 2002). The height of each icon is proportional to the number of acquisitions for the information cell. Icon size represents a measure of attention. With the help of arrows, transitions between boxes can be displayed.

Additional predictions can be made for reading and choice phases: The size of the boxes represents the amount of attention, participants give to the information cell. Arrows indicate direction and comparisons which are possible during information acquisition.

==Process Tracing in Political Science==
The method works by extracting all of the observable implications of a theory, rather than merely the observable implications regarding the [[dependent variable]]. Once these observable implications are extracted (particularly with reference to the microfoundations of how a theory's [[independent variable]] causes the predicated change in the dependent variable) they are then tested empirically, often through the method of elite interviews but also often through other rigorous forms of [[data analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gary |last=King |first2=Robert O. |last2=Keohane |first3=Sidney |last3=Verba |title=[[Designing Social Inquiry]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often used to complement comparative case study methods. By tracing the causal process from the independent variable of interest to the dependent variable, it may be possible to rule out potentially [[intervening variable]]s in imperfectly matched cases. This can create a stronger basis for attributing causal significance to the remaining independent variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alexander L. |last=George |authorlink=Alexander L. George |last2=Bennett |first2=Andrew |title=Case studies and theory development in the social sciences |location=London |publisher=MIT Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-262-57222-2 |pages=214‚Äì15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11046">'''Quantum finance''' is an interdisciplinary research field, applying theories and methods developed by quantum physicists and economists in order to solve problems in finance.  It is a branch of [[econophysics]].

== Background on instrument pricing ==
Finance theory is heavily based on financial instrument pricing such as [[stock option]] pricing.  Many of the problems facing the finance community have no known analytical solution. As a result, numerical methods and computer simulations for solving these problems have proliferated.  This research area is known as [[computational finance]].  Many computational finance problems have a high degree of computational complexity and are slow to converge to a solution on classical computers. In particular, when it comes to option pricing, there is additional complexity resulting from the need to respond to quickly changing markets. For example, in order to take advantage of inaccurately priced stock options, the computation must complete before the next change in the almost continuously changing stock market. As a result, the finance community is always looking for ways to overcome the resulting performance issues that arise when pricing options. This has led to research that applies alternative computing techniques to finance.

== Background on quantum finance ==
One of these alternatives is [[Quantum computer|quantum computing]]. Just as physics models have evolved from classical to quantum, so has computing. Quantum computers have been shown to outperform classical computers when it comes to simulating
quantum mechanics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/boghosian98simulating.html|author=B. Boghosian |title=Simulating quantum mechanics on a quantum computer|publisher=Physica D|year= 1998|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for
several other algorithms such as [[Shor's algorithm]] for factorization and [[Grover's algorithm]] for quantum search, making them an attractive area to research for solving computational finance problems.

=== Quantum continuous model ===
Most quantum option pricing research typically focuses on the quantization of the classical [[Black‚ÄìScholes equation|Black‚ÄìScholes‚ÄìMerton equation]] from the perspective of continuous equations like the [[Schr√∂dinger equation]]. Haven&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/03784371/2002/00000304/00000003/art00568|author=Haven, Emmanuel |title=A discussion on embedding the Black‚ÄìScholes option pricing model in a quantum physics setting |year= 2002 |work= |doi=10.1016/S0378-4371(01)00568-4|bibcode = 2002PhyA..304..507H |volume=304 |issue=3‚Äì4 |journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications |pages=507‚Äì524}}&lt;/ref&gt; builds on the work of Chen&lt;ref name=CHEN_01&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zeqian Chen |title=Quantum Theory for the Binomial Model in Finance Theory|journal=Journal of Systems Science and Complexity|year= 2004 |arxiv=quant-ph/0112156|bibcode = 2001quant.ph.12156C }}&lt;/ref&gt; and others, but considers the market from the perspective of the [[Schr√∂dinger equation]]. The key message in Haven's work is that the Black‚ÄìScholes‚ÄìMerton equation is really a special case of the Schr√∂dinger equation where markets are assumed to be efficient. The Schr√∂dinger-based equation that Haven derives has a parameter ƒß (not to be confused with the complex conjugate of h) that represents the amount of arbitrage that is present in the market resulting from a variety of sources including non-infinitely fast price changes, non-infinitely fast information dissemination and unequal wealth among traders. Haven argues that by setting this value appropriately, a more accurate option price can be derived, because in reality, markets are not truly efficient.

This is one of the reasons why it is possible that a quantum option pricing model could be more accurate than a classical one.  Baaquie&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year= 2002 |bibcode=2003npte.conf..333B |author1=Baaquie, Belal E. |title = Nonlinear Physics|author2=Coriano, Claudio |author3=Srikant, Marakani |page=8191 |arxiv=cond-mat/0208191 |doi=10.1142/9789812704467_0046|chapter= Quantum Mechanics, Path Integrals and Option Pricing: Reducing the Complexity of Finance |isbn=978-981-238-270-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has published many papers on quantum finance and even written a book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baaquie|first=Belal|title=Quantum Finance: Path Integrals and Hamiltonians for Options and Interest Rates|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84045-3|page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that brings many of them together. Core to Baaquie's research and others like Matacz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/matacz02path.html |title=Path dependent option pricing, The path integral partial averaging method|publisher=Journal of Computational Finance|year= 2002 |arxiv=cond-mat/0005319 |work=|bibcode=2000cond.mat..5319M}}&lt;/ref&gt; are Feynman's path integrals.

Baaquie applies path integrals to several [[exotic option]]s and presents analytical results comparing his results to the results of Black‚ÄìScholes‚ÄìMerton equation showing that they are very similar.  Piotrowski et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Quantum extension of European option pricing based on the Ornstein Uhlenbeck process|year= 2006 |bibcode=2006PhyA..368..176P |author1=Piotrowski, Edward W. |author2=Schroeder, Ma≈Çgorzata |author3=Zambrzycka, Anna |volume=368 |pages=176‚Äì182 |journal=Physica A |doi=10.1016/j.physa.2005.12.021|arxiv = quant-ph/0510121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; take a different approach by changing the Black‚ÄìScholes‚ÄìMerton assumption regarding the behavior of the stock underlying the option.  Instead of assuming it follows a [[Wiener process|Wiener-Bachelier]] process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hull | first = John | title = Options, futures, and other derivatives | publisher = Pearson/Prentice Hall | location = Upper Saddle River, N.J | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-13-149908-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; they assume that it follows an [[Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process|Ornstein-Uhlenbeck]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On the Theory of {B}rownian Motion|publisher=The Journal of Political Economy|year= 1930 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With this new assumption in place, they derive a quantum finance model as well as a European call option formula.

Other models such as Hull-White&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The pricing of options on interest rate caps and floors using the Hull-White model|year= 1990|publisher=Advanced Strategies in Financial Risk Management|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A theory of the term structure of interest rates|year= 1985|publisher=Physica A|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have successfully used the same approach in the classical setting with interest rate
derivatives.  Khrennikov&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |title=Classical and quantum randomness and the financial market|year= 2007 |author1=Khrennikov, Andrei|eprint=0704.2865 |class= q-fin.ST }}&lt;/ref&gt; builds on the work of Haven and others and further bolsters the idea that the market efficiency assumption made by the Black‚ÄìScholes‚ÄìMerton equation may not be appropriate.  To support this idea, Khrennikov builds on a framework of contextual probabilities using agents as a way of overcoming criticism of applying quantum theory to finance. Accardi and Boukas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |title=The Quantum Black-Scholes Equation|author1=Accardi, Luigi |author2=Boukas, Andreas |eprint=0706.1300v1|class=q-fin.PR |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; again quantize the Black‚ÄìScholes‚ÄìMerton equation, but in this case, they also consider the underlying stock to have both Brownian and Poisson processes.

=== Quantum binomial model ===
Chen published a paper in 2001,&lt;ref name=CHEN_01/&gt; where he presents a quantum binomial options pricing model or simply abbreviated as the quantum binomial model.  Metaphorically speaking, Chen's quantum binomial options pricing model (referred to
hereafter as the quantum binomial model) is to existing quantum finance models what the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein [[Binomial options pricing model|classical binomial options pricing model]] was to the Black‚ÄìScholes‚ÄìMerton model: a discretized and simpler version of the same result. These simplifications make the respective theories not only easier to analyze but also easier to implement on a computer.

=== Multi-step quantum binomial model ===
In the multi-step model the quantum pricing formula is:
 &lt;math&gt;
    C_0^N=\mathrm{tr}[(\bigotimes_{j=1}^{N}\rho_j){[S_N-K]}^+]
 &lt;/math&gt;
which is the equivalent of the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein [[binomial options pricing model]] formula as follows:
 &lt;math&gt;
    C_0^N=(1+r)^{-N}\sum_{n=0}^{N}\frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!}q^n{(1-q)}^{N-n}
    {[S_0{(1+b)}^n{(1+a)}^{N-n}-K]}^+
 &lt;/math&gt;

This shows that assuming stocks behave according to Maxwell-Boltzmann classical statistics, the quantum binomial model does indeed collapse to the classical binomial model.

Quantum volatility is as follows as per Meyer:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Extending and simulating the quantum binomial options pricing model|author=Keith Meyer|publisher=The University of Manitoba|url = http://mspace.lib.umanitoba.ca/handle/1993/3154 |year= 2009|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;
    \sigma=\frac{\ln{(1+x_0+\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2})}}{\sqrt{1/t}}
 &lt;/math&gt;

==== Bose‚ÄìEinstein assumption ====
Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann statistics can be replaced by the quantum Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics resulting in the following option price formula:
 &lt;math&gt;
    C_0^N=(1+r)^{-N}\sum_{n=0}^{N}\left(\frac{q^n{(1-q)}^{N-n}}{\sum_{k=0}^{N}q^k{(1-q)}^{N-k}}\right){[S_0{(1+b)}^n{(1+a)}^{N-n}-K]}^+
 &lt;/math&gt;

The Bose-Einstein equation will produce option prices that will differ from those produced by the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein option
pricing formula in certain circumstances.  This is because the stock is being treated like a quantum boson particle instead of a
classical particle.

== Quantum algorithm for the pricing of derivatives ==
Research by Rebentrost&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rebentrost|first=Patrick|last2=Gupt|first2=Brajesh|last3=Bromley|first3=Thomas R.|date=2018-04-30|title=Quantum computational finance: Monte Carlo pricing of financial derivatives|arxiv=1805.00109|bibcode=2018arXiv180500109R}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2018 shows that an algorithm exists for quantum computers capable of pricing financial derivatives with a square root advantage over classical methods. This development marks a shift from using quantum mechanics to gain insight into computational finance, to using quantum systems- quantum computers, to perform those calculations.

The '''Segond fracture''' is a type of [[avulsion fracture]] ([[soft tissue]] structures tearing off bits of their [[bone|bony]] attachment) of the [[Tibia|lateral tibial condyle]] of the [[knee]], immediately beyond the surface which articulates with the [[femur]].

==Clinical significance==

Because of the high rate of associated ligamentous and meniscal injury, the presence of a Segond or reverse Segond fracture requires that these other [[pathology|pathologies]] must be specifically ruled out. Increasingly, reconstruction of the ACL is combined with reconstruction of the ALL when this associated pathology is present. It is often associated with an increased 'pivot shift' on physical exam.

==Diagnosis==
Segond and reverse Segond fractures are characterized by a small avulsion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Campos JC, Chung CB, Lektrakul N, etal |title=Pathogenesis of the Segond fracture: anatomic and MR imaging evidence of an iliotibial tract or anterior oblique band avulsion |journal=Radiology |volume=219 |issue=2 |pages=381‚Äì6 |year=2001 |pmid=11323461 |doi=10.1148/radiology.219.2.r01ma23381}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "chip", fragment of characteristic size that is best seen on plain [[radiography]] in the [[Anatomical terms of location|anterior-posterior]] plane.  The chip of bone may be very difficult to see on the plain [[x-ray]] exam, and may be better seen on [[computed tomography]]. [[MRI]] may be useful for visualization of the associated [[bone marrow]] [[edema]] of the underlying tibial plateau on fat- saturated T2W and STIR images, as well as the associated findings of ligamentous and/or meniscal injury.

==History ==
Originally described by Dr. [[Paul Segond]] in 1879&lt;ref&gt;Segond P. ''Recherches cliniques et exp√©rimentales sur les √©panchements sanguins du genou par entorse''. Progres Med 1879; 7:297-299, 319&amp;ndash;321, 340&amp;ndash;341.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Public Domain from Bnf: Recherches cliniques et exp√©rimentales sur les √©panchements sanguins du genou par entorse, par Paul Segond,"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5712206r | title=Recherches cliniques et exp√©rimentales sur les √©panchements sanguins du genou par entorse, par Paul Segond, | accessdate=November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a series of [[cadaver]]ic experiments, the Segond fracture occurs in association with tears of the [[anterior cruciate ligament]] (ACL) (75‚Äì100%) and injury to the [[medial meniscus]] (66‚Äì75%), lateral capsular ligament (now known as the Anterolateral ligament, or ALL), as well as injury to the structures behind the knee.

A rare, mirror image of the Segond fracture has also been described. The so-called "reverse Segond fracture" can occur after an avulsion fracture of the tibial component of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) in association with posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and medial meniscal tears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Escobedo EM, Mills WJ, Hunter JC |title=The "reverse Segond" fracture: association with a tear of the posterior cruciate ligament and medial meniscus |journal=AJR.  American Journal of Roentgenology |volume=178 |issue=4 |pages=979‚Äì83 |year=2002 |pmid=11906886 |doi=10.2214/ajr.178.4.1780979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Claes, et al.: Anatomy of the anterolateral ligament of the knee.  Journal of Anatomy, 223: 321-328, Oct 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Segond fracture is typically the result of abnormal varus, or "bowing", stress  to the knee, combined with internal rotation of the tibia. Reverse Segond fracture, as its name suggests, is caused by abnormal valgus, or "knock-knee", stress and external rotation.

Originally thought to be a result of avulsion of the medial third of the lateral collateral ligament, the Segond fracture has been shown by more recent research to relate also to the insertion of the iliotibial tract (ITT) and the anterior oblique band (AOB), a [[ligament]]ous attachment of the [[fibular collateral ligament]] (FCL), to the midportion of the lateral tibia and to be associated with avulsion by the anterolateral ligament (ALL). (Roberts CC, Towers JD, Spangehl MJ et-al. Advanced MR imaging of the cruciate ligaments. Radiol. Clin. North Am. 2007;45 (6): 1003-16, vi-vii.)''

The '''sabbath year''' ('''shmita''' {{lang-he-n|◊©◊û◊ô◊ò◊î}}, literally "release") also called the '''sabbatical year''' or ''sh«ùvi'it'' ({{Hebrew|◊©◊ë◊ô◊¢◊ô◊™}}, literally "seventh") is the seventh year of the seven-year agricultural cycle mandated by the [[Torah]] for the [[Land of Israel]],&lt;ref&gt;This article incorporates text from Easton's Bible Dictionary (1897), a publication now in the public domain. Sabbatical year‚Äîevery seventh year, during which the land, according to the law of Moses, had to remain uncultivated (Lev. 25:2‚Äì7; comp. Ex. 23:10, 11, 12; Lev. 26:34, 35). &lt;/ref&gt; and still observed in contemporary [[Judaism]].

During ''shmita'', the land is left to lie [[fallow]] and all agricultural activity, including plowing, planting, pruning and harvesting, is forbidden by ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law). Other cultivation techniques (such as watering, fertilizing, weeding, spraying, trimming and mowing) may be performed as a preventive measure only, not to improve the growth of trees or other plants. Additionally, any fruits or herbs which grow of their own accord and where no watch is kept over them are deemed ''hefker'' (ownerless) and may be picked by anyone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishnah]] ''Shevi'it'' 9:1&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of laws also apply to the sale, consumption and disposal of ''shmita'' produce. All debts, except those of foreigners, were to be remitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Deut|15:1‚Äì11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 25 of the [[Book of Leviticus]] promises bountiful harvests to those who observe the ''shmita'', and describes its observance as a test of religious faith. There is little notice of the observance of this year in Biblical history and it appears to have been much neglected.&lt;ref&gt;From Easton's Bible Dictionary (1897)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biblical references===
A sabbath (shmita) year is mentioned several times in the [[Hebrew Bible]] by name or by its pattern of six years of activity and one of rest: 
* [[Book of Exodus]]: "You may plant your land for six years and gather its crops. But during the seventh year, you must leave it alone and withdraw from it. The needy among you will then be able to eat just as you do, and whatever is left over can be eaten by wild animals. This also applies to your vineyard and your olive grove." (Exodus 23:10‚Äì11&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=23 Exodus 23], the [[World ORT]] website version.&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Book of Leviticus]]: "God spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai, telling him to speak to the Israelites and say to them: When you come to the land that I am giving you, the land must be given a rest period, a sabbath to God. For six years you may plant your fields, prune your vineyards, and harvest your crops, but the seventh year is a sabbath of sabbaths for the land. It is God's sabbath during which you may not plant your fields, nor prune your vineyards. Do not harvest crops that grow on their own and do not gather the grapes on your unpruned vines, since it is a year of rest for the land. [What grows while] the land is resting may be eaten by you, by your male and female slaves, and by the employees and resident hands who live with you. All the crops shall be eaten by the domestic and wild animals that are in your land."

* [[Books of Kings]]: (Isaiah speaking) "... And this is the sign for you: This year you shall eat what grows of itself, and the next year what springs from that, and in the third year, sow and reap and plant vineyards and eat their fruit. And the survivors of the House of Judah that have escaped shall regenerate its stock below and produce boughs above." ([https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09b19.htm#29 2 Kings 19:29]).

The 2 Kings passage (and its parallel in Isaiah 37:30) refers to a sabbath (''shmita'') year followed by a jubilee (''yovel'') year. The text says that in the first year the people were to eat "what grows of itself," which is expressed by one word in the Hebrew, ''saphiah'' (&lt;big&gt;◊°◊§◊ô◊ó&lt;/big&gt;). In Leviticus 25:5, the reaping of the ''saphiah'' is forbidden for a Sabbath year, explained by [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinic commentary]] to mean the prohibition of reaping in the ordinary way (with, for example, a sickle), but permitted to be plucked in a limited way by one's own hands for one's immediate needs during the Sabbath year.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yosef Qafih]] (ed.), ''Rabbi [[Nathan ben Abraham I|Nathan Ben Abraham]]'s Mishnah Commentary'', in: ''Perush Shishah Sidrei Mishnah'' (A Commentary on the Six Orders of the Mishnah), appended at the end of the book: The Six Orders of the Mishnah: with the Commentaries of the Rishonim, El ha-Meqorot: Jerusalem 1955, s.v. ''Shevi'it'' chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is an alternative explanation used to rectify what appears to be a discrepancy in the two biblical sources, taken from [[Adam Clarke]]'s 1837 Bible commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Adam Clarke |title=The Holy Bible, Containing the Old and New Testaments, with a Commentary and Critical Notes |location=New York/Nashville |publisher=Abingdon Press |year=1837}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assyrian siege had lasted until after planting time in the fall of 701 BCE, and although the Assyrians left immediately after the prophecy was given (2 Kings 19:35), they had consumed the harvest of that year before they left, leaving only the ''saphiah'' to be gleaned from the fields. In the next year, the people were to eat "what springs from that", Hebrew ''sahish'' (&lt;big&gt;◊°◊ó◊ô◊©&lt;/big&gt;). Since this word occurs only here and in the parallel passage in Isaiah 37:30, where it is spelled &lt;big&gt;◊©◊ó◊ô◊°&lt;/big&gt;, there is some uncertainty about its exact meaning. If it is the same as the ''shabbat ha-arets'' (&lt;big&gt;◊©◊ë◊™ ◊î◊ê◊®◊•&lt;/big&gt;) that was permitted to be eaten in a Sabbath year in Leviticus 25:6, then there is a ready explanation why there was no harvest: the second year, i.e. the year starting in the fall of 700 BCE, was a Sabbath year, after which normal sowing and reaping resumed in the third year, as stated in the text.

Another interpretation obviates all of the speculation about the Sabbath year entirely, translating the verse as: "And this shall be the sign for you, this year you shall eat what grows by itself, and the next year, what grows from the tree stumps, and in the third year, sow and reap, and plant vineyards and eat their fruit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rabbi A. J. Rosenberg |title=II Kings, A New English Translation |location=New York |publisher=Judaica Press |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Judaica Press]] commentary, it was Sennacherib's invasion that prevented the people of Judah from sowing in the first year and Isaiah was promising that enough plants would grow to feed the population for the rest of the first year and the second year. Therefore, Isaiah was truly providing a sign to Hezekiah that God would save the city of Jerusalem, as explicitly stated, and not an injunction concerning the Sabbath (''shmita'') or jubilee (''yovel'') years, which are not mentioned at all in the passage.

==Rabbinical interpretations==
The rabbis of the Talmud and later times interpreted the Shmita laws in various ways to ease the burden they created for farmers and the agricultural industry. The ''heter mechira'' (leniency of sale), developed for the Shmita year of 1888‚Äì1889, permitted Jewish farmers to sell their land to non-Jews so that they could continue to work the land as usual during Shmita. This temporary solution to the impoverishment of the Jewish settlement in those days was later adopted by the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] as a permanent edict, generating ongoing controversy between [[Zionism|Zionist]] and Haredi leaders to this day.&lt;ref name="Erlanger"&gt;{{cite news |author=Steven Erlanger |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/08/world/middleeast/08shmita.html |title=As Farmers and Fields Rest, a Land Grows Restless |date=October 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a major debate among halakhic authorities as to what is the nature of the obligation of the Sabbatical year nowadays. Some say it is still biblically binding, as it has always been. Others hold that it is rabbinically binding, since the Shmita only biblically applies when the Jubilee year is in effect, but the Sages of the Talmud legislated the observance of the Shmita anyway as a reminder of the biblical statute. And yet others hold that the Shmita has become purely voluntary. An analysis by respected [[posek]] and former [[Sephardic Judaism|Sephardic]] Chief Rabbi [[Ovadiah Yosef]] in his [[Responsum|responsa]] ''[[Yabi'a Omer]]'' (Vol. 10), accorded with the middle option, that the Biblical obligation holds only when a majority of the Jewish people is living in the Biblical Land of Israel and hence the Shmita nowadays is a [[Rabbinic prohibitions|rabbinic obligation]] in nature. This approach potentially admits for some leniencies which would not be possible if the Shemitah were biblical in origin, including the aforementioned sale of the land of Israel. [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] authorities, on the other hand, generally follow the view of the [[Chazon Ish]], that the Shmita continues to be a Biblical obligation.

The Sma, who holds that Shmita nowadays is only a Rabbinic obligation, holds that the Biblical promise of bounty for those who observe the Shmita (Leviticus 25:20‚Äì22&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0325.htm |title=Leviticus 25 / Hebrew Bible in English / Mechon-Mamre |publisher=Mechon-mamre.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;) only applies when the Biblical obligation is in effect, and hence that the Biblical promise of bounty is not in effect today. However, the Chazon Ish, who holds that the Biblical obligation of Shmita observance remains in effect today, holds that the Biblical promise of bounty follows it and Divine bounty is promised to Jews living in the Land of Israel today, just as it was promised in ancient times. However, he holds that Jews should generally not demand miracles from Heaven and hence that one should not rely on this promise for one's sustenance, but should instead make appropriate arrangements and rely on permissible leniencies.&lt;ref name="Kuber" /&gt;

Haredi Jews tell stories of groups of Israeli Jews who kept the Shmita and experienced remarkable agricultural events which they describe as representative of miracles in fulfillment of the Biblical promise of bounty. One famous story is told about the then-two-year-old village of [[Komemiyut]] during the 1952 Shmita. The village was one of the few who refrained from working the land that year. At the end of the Shmita, farmers searching for seed to plant found only wormy, inferior seed that had been rotting for years in an abandoned shed. Rabbi Binyamin Mendelson advised them to sow this seed anyway, saying "The Almighty who causes wheat to sprout from good seed will bless your inferior seed as well," even though it was three months after neighboring villages had planted their fields. They did. That year the fall rains came late, the day after the Komemiyut seed was sown. As a result, the neighboring villages had a meager harvest, while the village of Komemiyut, who sowed from the old store, had a bumper crop.&lt;ref name="Kuber" /&gt;

==Observance in the Land of Israel==
According to the laws of shmita, land owned by Jews in the Land of Israel is left unfarmed. The law does not apply to land in the Diaspora. (Under the Torah of Moses, Leviticus [which may or may not have actually been much followed in ancient Israel], any naturally growing produce was not to be formally harvested, but could have been eaten by its owners,&lt;ref&gt;C. F. Keil and Delitzsch F., Commentary on the Old Testament, 10 vols.; (Peabody: Hendrickson Publishers, 1996), paragraph 1771. Lev 25:6 ASV: "6 And the sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for thee, and for thy servant and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger, who sojourn with thee."&lt;/ref&gt; as well as left to be taken by poor people, passing strangers, and beasts of the field.) While naturally growing produce such as grapes growing on existing vines can be harvested, it cannot be sold or used for commercial purposes; it must be given away or consumed. Personal debts are considered forgiven at sunset on 29 [[Elul]]. Since this aspect of shmita is not dependent on the land, it applies to Jews both in Israel and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youngisraelrabbis.org.il/assets/shmitta.doc]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630035119/http://www.youngisraelrabbis.org.il/assets/shmitta.doc |date=June 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As produce grown on land in Israel owned by Jewish farmers cannot be sold or consumed, fruits and vegetables sold in a shmita year may be derived from five sources:

* Produce grown during the sixth year, to which the laws of the seventh year do not apply.
* Produce grown on land owned by non-Jewish (typically, [[Arab]]) farmers in Israel.
* Produce grown on land outside the halakhic boundaries of Israel (''chutz la'aretz'').
* Produce (mainly fruits) distributed through the ''[[otzar beit din]]''.
* Produce grown in greenhouses.

Halakhic authorities prohibit removing produce with Sabbatical sanctity (''shevi'it'' produce) from the Land of Israel or purchasing such produce outside the land of Israel. Some authorities hold that tourists should be careful not to carry any such produce on an airplane leaving Israel even for consumption mid-air.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

There is a requirement that ''shevi'it'' produce be consumed for personal use and cannot be sold or put in trash. For this reason, there are various special rules regarding the religious use of products that are normally made from agricultural produce. Some authorities hold that [[Menorah (Hanukiah)|Hannukah candles]] cannot be made from ''shevi'it'' oils because the light of Channukah candles is not supposed to be used for personal use, while Shabbat candles can be because their light can be used for personal use. For similar reasons, some authorities hold that if the [[Havdalah]] ceremony is performed using wine made from ''shevi'it'' grapes, the cup should be drunk completely and the candle should not be dipped into the wine to extinguish the flame as is normally done.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The ''otzar beit din'' system is structured in such a way that ''biur'' remains the responsibility of members of individual households and hence warehoused produce does not have to be moved to a public place or reclaimed at the ''biur'' time. Households only have to perform ''biur'' on produce they receive before the ''biur'' time, not on produce they receive after it.&lt;ref name="Kuber" /&gt;

Because the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rules of [[Kashrut]] have strictures requiring certain products, such as wine, to be produced by Jews, the leniency of selling one's land to non-Jews is unavailable for these products, since these strictures would render the wine non-[[Kashrut|Kosher]]. Accordingly, wine made from grapes grown in the land of Israel during the Shmita year is subject to the full strictures of Shmita. New vines cannot be planted. Although grapes from existing vines can be harvested, they and their products cannot be sold.

While obligatory to the Orthodox as a matter of religious observance, observance of the rules of Shmita is voluntary so far as the civil government is concerned in the contemporary [[State of Israel]]. Civil courts do not enforce the rules. A debt would be transferred to a religious court for a document of prosbul only if both parties voluntarily agreed to do so. Many non-religious Israeli Jews do not observe these rules, although some non-religious farmers participate in the symbolic sale of land to non-Jews to permit their produce to be considered kosher and sellable to Orthodox Jews who permit the leniency. Despite this, during Shmita, crop yields in Israel fall short of requirements so importation is employed from abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jean | last=Christou | title=Israel looks to Cyprus as Jewish law orders land to remain fallow | year=2007 | url =http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=34179&amp;cat_id=1 | work =[[Cyprus Mail]] | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-19 | language = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014643/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=34179&amp;cat_id=1 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Talmudic references==
According to the [[Talmud]], observance of the Sabbatical year is of high accord, and one who does not do so may not be allowed to be a witness in an Orthodox [[Beit Din|rabbinical court]]. Nonetheless, [[Rabbinic Judaism]] has developed [[Halakha|Halakhic]] (religious-law) devices to be able to maintain a modern agricultural and commercial system while giving heed to the Biblical injunctions. Such devices represent examples of [[Halakha#Flexibility|flexibility within the Halakhic system]]

[[Hillel the Elder]], in the first century BCE, used the rule that remittance of debts applies only to debts between Jews, to develop a device known as [[Prosbul]] in which the debt is transferred to a Beit Din (religious court). When owed to the court rather than to an individual, the debt survives the Sabbatical year. This device, formulated early in the era of Rabbinic Judaism when the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] was still standing, became a prototype of how Judaism was later to adapt to the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] and maintain a system based on Biblical law under very different conditions.

The rabbis of the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] created rules to impose order on the harvesting process including a rule limiting harvesters working on others' land to taking only enough to feed themselves and their families. They also devised a system, called ''otzar beit din'', under which a rabbinical court supervised a communal harvesting process by hiring workers who harvested the fields, stored it in communal storage facilities, and distributed it to the community.&lt;ref name="Kuber" /&gt;

There exists a major difference of opinion between two [[Acharonim]], the [[Yosef Karo|Beit Yosef]] and the [[Moses ben Joseph di Trani (the Elder)|Mabit]], as to whether produce grown on land in Israel which is owned by non-Jews also has sanctity. According to the Beit Yosef, such produce has no sanctity and may be used and/or discarded in the same way as any produce grown outside of Israel. According to the Mabit, the fact that this produce was grown in Israel, even by non-Jews, gives it sanctity, and it must be treated in the special ways detailed above.

The [[Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz|Chazon Ish]], a noted Haredi halakhic authority who issued key rulings on Jewish agricultural law (''mitzvos tlu'os ba'aretz'')in the 1930s and 1940s, ruled like the Mabit, holding that produce grown on land in Israel owned by non-Jews has sanctity. The Chazon Ish's ruling was adopted first by the religious families of Bnei Brak and is popularly called ''Minhag Chazon Ish'' (the custom of the Chazon Ish).

The rabbis of Jerusalem, on the other hand, embraced the opinion of the Beit Yosef that produce farmed on land owned by non-Jews has no sanctity. This opinion is now called ''Minhag Yerushalayim'' (the custom of Jerusalem), and was adopted by many Haredi families, by [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate Palestine]], and by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel.&lt;ref name="Kuber" /&gt;

These respective opinions are reflected in the way the various kashrut-certifying organizations publicize their Shmita and non-Shmita produce. The [[Edah HaChareidis]], which follows ''Minhag Yerushalayim,'' buys produce from non-Jewish farms in Israel and sells it as "non-Shmita produce." The [[Shearit Yisrael]] certifying organization, which subscribes to ''Minhag Chazon Ish,'' also buys from non-Jewish farmers in Israel, but labels the produce as such so that customers who keep ''Minhag Chazon Ish'' will treat these fruits and vegetables with appropriate sanctity.

==Shevi'it==
In halakha (Jewish law), produce of the seventh year that is subject to the laws of Shmita is called ''[[Shevi'it (Talmud)|sheviit]],'' (''sheviis'' in [[Ashkenazic Hebrew]]). ''Shevi'it'' produce has sanctity requiring special rules for its use:

*It can only be consumed or used (in its ordinary use) for personal enjoyment
*It cannot be bought, sold, or thrown out.
*It must be used in its "best" manner so as to ensure fullest enjoyment (For example, fruits that are normally eaten whole cannot be juiced).
*It can only be stored so long as naturally-growing plants of the given species can be eaten by animals in the fields. Once a particular species is no longer available in the field, one must rid ones house of it through a process known as ''biur''.&lt;ref name="Kuber"&gt;{{cite news |author=Mordechai Kuber |title=Shmittah for the Clueless |work=Jewish Action: The Magazine of the Orthodox Union |volume=68 |issue=2 |year=2007 |page=6875}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By Biblical law, Jews who own land are required to make their land available during the Shmita to anyone who wishes to come in and harvest. If the land is fenced etc., gates must be left open to enable entrance. These rules apply to all outdoor agriculture, including private gardens and even outdoor potted plants. Plants inside a building are exempt. However, the Rabbis of the [[Mishna]] and Jerusalem Talmud imposed [[Mitzva#Rabbinic mitzvah|rabbinic ordinances]] on harvesters to ensure an orderly and equitable process and to prevent a few individuals from taking everything. Harvesters on others' land are permitted to take only enough to feed themselves and their families.&lt;ref name="Kuber" /&gt;

==''Heter mechira''==
[[File:Rav Kook Letter Regarding Shemitah Observance.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of Chief Rabbi, Rav Avraham Yitzchak HaKohen Kook, Regarding The Importance of Shemitah Observance, and collecting for a communal fund to support those who observe shmita without compromise.]]
In the late 19th century, in the early days of Zionism, Rabbi [[Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor]] came up with a halakhic means of allowing agriculture to continue during the Shmita year. After ruling in favor of ''Minhag Yerushalayim'', that the biblical prohibition consists of not cultivating the land owned by Jews ("''your'' land", Exodus 23:10), Rabbi Spektor devised a mechanism by which the land could be sold to a non-Jew for the duration of that year under a trust agreement. Under this plan, the land would belong to the non-Jew temporarily, and revert to Jewish ownership when the year was over. When the land was sold under such an arrangement, Jews could continue to farm it. Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], the first Chief Rabbi of British Mandate Palestine, allowed this principle, not as an ideal, but rather as a limited permit for individuals and times which are considered by Halacha of great need ("b'shas hadchak"), which became known as the ''heter mechira'' (lit. "sale permit"). Rabbi Kook explained in a lengthy responsum that the ideal is not to rely on the leniency of heter mechira, but rather to observe shmita according to all opinions. He noted that he himself did not rely on the leniency, it was intended only in a limited time of great need, for those unable to observe the shmita without the leniency.

The ''heter mechira'' was accepted by [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and is one of the classic examples of the Modern Orthodox approach toward adapting classical Jewish law to the modern world. However, this approach has not been universally accepted in the Orthodox community and has met with opposition, particularly from Haredi ''[[posek|poskim]]'' (authorities of Jewish law).

In contemporary religious circles these rabbinic leniencies have received wide but not universal acceptance. In Israel, the Chief Rabbinate obtains permission from all farmers who wish to have their land sold. The land is then legally sold to a non-Jew for a large sum of money. The payment is made by a cheque post-dated to after the end of the Sabbatical year. When the cheque is returned or not honoured at the end of the year the land reverts to its original owners. Thus, the fields can be farmed with certain restrictions.

Although the [[Orthodox Union]]'s Kashrut Division accepts ''Minhag Yerushalayim'' and hence regards the produce of land owned by non-Jews as ordinary produce, it does not currently rely on the ''heter mechira'' because of doubts about whether the trust arrangement involved effects a valid transfer of ownership.&lt;ref name="Kuber" /&gt;

Some Haredi farmers do not avail themselves of this leniency and seek other pursuits during the Shmita year.&lt;ref name="Erlanger" /&gt;

==Storehouse of the rabbinical court==
&lt;!-- linked from redirects [[otzar beit din]] and [[Otzar Beit Din]] --&gt;
The ancient idea of an ''otzar beit din'' (storehouse of the rabbinical court) is mentioned in the [[Tosefta]] (''[[Sheviit]] 8, 1''). Under an ''otzar beit din'', a community rabbinical court supervises harvesting by hiring workers to harvest, store, and distribute food to the community. Members of the community pay the ''[[beit din]]'', but this payment represents only a contribution for services, and not a purchase or sale of the food. This Talmudic device was revived in modern times as an alternative to the ''[[heter mechira]]''.&lt;ref name="Kuber" /&gt;

Because under this approach land cannot be sown but existing plants can be tended and harvested, the approach is applied to orchards, vineyards, and other [[perennial crop]]s. A ''beit din,'' or rabbinical court supervising the process, hires farmers as its agents to tend and harvest the crops, and appoints the usual distributors and shopkeepers as its agents to distribute them. Individual consumers appoint the court and its designees as their agents and pay monies to court-appointed designees as agents of the court. Thus, under this approach, a legal arrangement is created whereby the crops themselves are never bought or sold, but rather people are merely paid for their labor and expenses in providing certain services. In modern Israel, the ''[[badatz]]'' is notable for adapting and supervising such arrangements.

The Orthodox Union notes that "to some, the modern-day ''otzar'' might seem to be nothing more than a legal sleight of hand. All the regular players are still in place, and distribution rolls along as usual. However, in reality, it is identical only in appearance as prices are controlled, and may correspond only to expenses, with no profit allowed. In addition, the ''otzar beit din'' does not own the produce. Since it is simply a mechanism for open distribution, any individual is still entitled to collect produce from a field or orchard on his own. Furthermore, all agents of the ''beit din'' are appointed only if they commit to distributing the produce in accordance with the restrictions that result from its sanctity."&lt;ref name="Kuber" /&gt;

==''Biur''==
Under the rules of the Shmita, produce with Sabbatical sanctity (''shevi'it'') can only be stored as long as plants of the same species (e.g. plants sprouting by themselves) are available to animals in the fields. Once a species is no longer available in the land, halakha requires that it be removed, made ownerless, and made available to anyone who wishes to take it through a procedure called ''[[biur]]''.

The Orthodox Union describes the contemporary application of the rules of ''biur'' as follows:

:On the appointed day, one must remove all the relevant produce, and all products containing such produce, from his home and take it to a public area such as a sidewalk. Once there, the individual declares the produce in front of three people who do not live with him. He then waits to give the witnesses a chance to claim the produce. Once they have taken what they want, he is permitted to reclaim whatever remains. It is permissible to choose three people whom one knows will not claim the produce for themselves, even though they are legally entitled to.&lt;ref name="Kuber" /&gt;

Thus, while the obligation of making one's produce available to the public and permitted to all takers can be performed in such a way as to minimize the risk that this availability will actually be utilized, this risk cannot be entirely eliminated. The community at large, including members of the poor, must be afforded some opportunity to take the produce.

''Biur'' only applies to produce that has ''shevi'it'' sanctity. For this reason, it does not apply to produce grown under the ''heter mechira'' for those who accept it. (Under the reasoning of the ''heter mechira'' the shmita does not apply to land owned by non-Jews, so its produce does not have ''shevi'it'' sanctity.)&lt;ref name="Kuber" /&gt;

==In modern Israel==
The first Shmita year in the modern State of Israel was 1951-52 (5712 in the Hebrew calendar). Subsequent Shmita years have been 1958‚Äì59 (5719), 1965‚Äì66 (5726), 1972‚Äì73 (5733), 1979‚Äì80 (5740), 1986‚Äì87 (5747), 1993‚Äì94 (5754), 2000‚Äì01 (5761),  2007‚Äì08 (5768), and 2014-15 (5775). The last Shmita year began on Rosh Hashanah in September 2014, corresponding to the Hebrew calendar year 5775. The 50th year of the land, which is also a [[Shabbat]] of the land, is called "Yovel" in Hebrew, which is the origin of the Latin term "Jubilee", also meaning 50th. According to the Torah, observance of Jubilee only applies when the Jewish people live in the land of Israel according to their tribes. Thus, with the exile of the tribes of [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]], and [[Tribe of Manasseh|Menashe]] (about 600 BCE) Jubilee has not been applicable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/196/Q3/ |title=Ask the Rabbi: Jubilee Year |publisher=Ohr Somayach |accessdate=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, [[Sefardic]] Chief Rabbi [[Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron]] [[Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron#Farming controversy|withdrew religious certification]] of the validity of permits for the sale of land to non-Jews during the Shmita year following protests against his endorsement of the leniency by members of the Haredi community.

===Hydroponics===
Authorities who prohibit farming in Israel generally permit [[hydroponics]] farming in greenhouses structured so that the plants are not connected to the soil. As a result, hydroponics use has been increasing in Haredi farming communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shemittah.com/short-guide-to-shmita.html Shemittah | Shmita | Get ready for Shemittah Year 5768&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012213906/http://www.shemittah.com/short-guide-to-shmita.html |date=October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shmita 2007‚Äì08===
During the 2007‚Äì08 Shmita, the Chief Rabbinate of Israel attempted to avoid taking a potentially divisive position on the dispute between Haredi and Modern Orthodox views about the correctness of the ''heter mechira'' leniency by ruling that local rabbis could make their own decisions about whether or not to accept this device as valid. The [[Israel Supreme Court]], however, ordered the Chief Rabbinate to rescind its ruling and to devise a single national ruling. The Israel Supreme Court opined that divergent local rulings would be harmful to farmers and trade and could implicate competition. The issue of secular courts ordering the rabbinate to rule in particular ways on religious matters aroused a debate within the [[Knesset]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Steven Erlanger |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/25/world/middleeast/25mideast.html |title=Israel's Top Court Backs Loophole in Farming Law |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 25, 2007 |accessdate=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Alison Stewart |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=15143103 |title='Shmita' Year Controversy in Israel |publisher=National Public Radio |date=October 10, 2007 |accessdate=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/14388/ |title='Shmita' Battle Creates Showdown Between Zionists, Haredim |newspaper=Jewish Exponent |date=October 25, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426211334/http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/14388 |archivedate=April 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli wineries often address this issue by making separate batches of Shmita wine, labeled as such, and giving away bottles of Shmita wine as a free bonus to purchasers of non-Shmita wine.

}}'''Simon Dinnerstein''' (born February 16, 1943) is an American artist best known for ''The Fulbright Triptych''.

==Early life==
Dinnerstein was born in [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]], [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1943 to pharmacist Louis and homemaker Sarah Dinnerstein. One of two children, his older brother [[Harvey Dinnerstein]] is also an artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Simon and Simone Dinnerstein In Conversation: An Interview with Robin Quivers at the German Consulate of New York|url=http://vimeo.com/37105837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Dinnerstein holds a Bachelor of Arts in History from the [[City College of New York]]. He studied painting and drawing at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] Art School with Louis Grebenak, [[David Levine]], and Richard Mayhew.&lt;ref name=Dantzic&gt;{{cite book|last=Dantzic|first=Cynthia Maris|title=100 New York Painters|date=November 2006|publisher=Schiffer Publishing|isbn=978-0764325434|pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the faculty at the [[New School for Social Research]], [[Parsons School of Design]], and [[New York City Technical College]]. He lectures widely and has lectured at [[Pennsylvania State University]].&lt;ref name=Chronology&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology of Simon Dinnerstein|url=http://www.simondinnerstein.com/chronology.html|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and influences==
Dinnerstein's art is mostly in the [[figurative art|figurative]] style,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mertens|first=Richard|title=Essential Realities: Simon Dinnerstein Draws the Essence of Art from the Commonplace|newspaper=The Concord Monitor|date=October 25, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Folk art|folk]], [[expressionistic]], and [[surrealistic]] influences,&lt;ref name=Messer&gt;{{cite book|last=Messer|first=Thomas M.|title=The Art of Simon Dinnerstein|date=November 1990|publisher=The University of Arkansas Press|location=Foreword|isbn=978-1557281425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Roberta|title=Rediscovered at the Altar of Art|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/12/arts/design/simon-dinnerstein-the-fulbright-triptych-review.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=17 May 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hagler&gt;{{cite web|last=Hagler|first=Elana|title=Pursuing Humanity: An Interview with Simon Dinnerstein|url=http://paintingperceptions.com/contemporary-realism/pursuing-humanity-an-interview-with-simon-dinnerstein|publisher=Painting Perceptions|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; possessing a "[[narrative]]"&lt;ref name=Messer /&gt; and "[[psychological]] edge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Proctor|first=Roy|title=Exploring the Edge: No Slave to Fashion, Artist Draws Us Into Other States of Mind|newspaper=Richmond Times-Dispatch|date=August 20, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He uses a variety of media, [[pencils]], [[charcoal]], and [[oil paint]]s. Dinnerstein renders [[still-life]]'s, but most of his work involves [[portrait painting|portraiture]] or [[human figure]]s. He often "paints the figure in unexpected juxtaposition with [[landscape]] or interior elements,"&lt;ref name=Dantzic /&gt; of which Dinnerstein says,

&lt;blockquote&gt;What interests me is the ability of [[Degas]], [[Balthus]], [[Lucien Freud]] and [[Antonio Lopez Garcia]]‚Ä¶to deal with the figure‚Ä¶to create art‚Ä¶rich in scale, yet abstract adventurous, experimental‚Ä¶deeply human‚Ä¶a combination of modernism and tradition of skill medium and‚Ä¶a fresh, personal response to the human form in art‚Ä¶Hopefully my work speaks to these issues.&lt;ref name=Dantzic /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Often the human figures are portrayed against a background of [[hyperreality]],&lt;ref name=Smith /&gt; or in dreamy surreal landscapes.&lt;ref name=Slager&gt;{{cite book|last=Slager|first=Daniel, editor|title=The Suspension of Time: Reflections on Simon Dinnerstein and The Fulbright Triptych|date=June 14, 2011|publisher=Milkweed Editions|isbn=978-1571313263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Light plays an important role in Dinnerstein's work achieving "an inwardness‚Ä¶in the play of light that radiates from the object and renders it mysterious."&lt;ref name="From Brownsville to Park Slope: An Interview with Simon Dinnerstein"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abramovitch|first=Ilana|title=Jews of Brooklyn|date=2002|publisher=Brandeis University Press|isbn=978-1584650034|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; or makes "Brooklyn sunlight on an ordinary floor seem supernatural."&lt;ref name=Davenport&gt;{{cite book|last=Davenport|first=Guy, essayist|title=The Art of Simon Dinnerstein, Simon Dinnerstein: Paintings and Drawings|date=2000|publisher=Hudson Hills Press|isbn=0965048543}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of light contributes to Dinnerstein's paintings being described as "[[magical realism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnheim|first=Rudolph, essayist|title=Simon Dinnerstein: Painting and Drawing|date=2000|publisher=Hudson Hills Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In early Dinnerstein works, strong left-right symmetry prevails, although later works are noted for their asymmetry.&lt;ref name=Davenport /&gt;
Dinnerstein draws on diverse sources for inspiration: Northern European art ([[Albrecht D√ºrer]], [[Hieronymus Bosch]]&lt;ref name=Hagler /&gt;&lt;ref name="vimeo.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Triptych: An Evening of Painting and Music: Simon Dinnerstein &amp; Robert Sirota|url=http://vimeo.com/92970548|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Mexican art ([[Frida Kahlo]], [[Diego Rivera]]&lt;ref name=Davenport /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McLeod|first=Deborah|title=Bodies of Work: From Visceral Portraits to Romanticized Nymphs, Simon Dinnerstein's Retrospective at the Marsh Gallery Shows a Stylistic Niche through Every Turn of the Artist's Evolution |url=http://www.styleweekly.com/richmond/from-visceral-portraits-to-romanticized-nymphs-simon-dinnersteins-retrospective-at-the-marsh-gallery-shows-a-stylistic-niche-through-every/Content?oid=1386808 |accessdate=17 May 2014|newspaper=Richmond Style Weekly|date=September 1, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as literature ([[D.

Dinnerstein's most notable painting, ''The [[Fulbright]] Triptych'', was started in [[Germany]] in 1971&lt;ref name=Dinnerstein /&gt; while he served as a [[Fulbright Scholar]] in Graphics. It was completed in 1974.&lt;ref name="vimeo.com"/&gt;  A largely autobiographical work,&lt;ref name="Introduction: Simon Dinnerstein's Family Romance"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boime|first=Albert|title=The Art of Simon Dinnerstein|date=November 1990|publisher=The University of Arkansas Press|isbn=978-1557281425}}&lt;/ref&gt; it combines stark realism&lt;ref name=Messer /&gt; with American figurative tradition to produce a secular rendering of the usually religious form, the [[triptych]].

Writer [[Jonathan Lethem]] commented: "Simon Dinnerstein's 'The Fulbright Triptych' is one of those singular and astonishing works of art which seem to imply a description of the whole world merely by insisting on a scrupulous gaze at one perfect instant."&lt;ref name=Slager/&gt; The oil-on-wood painting consists of three panels approximately 14 feet wide, depicting a graphic artist's studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dinnerstein|first=Simon|title=The Fulbright Triptych|url=http://www.simondinnerstein.com/the_fulbright_triptych.html|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three figures, representing the Dinnerstein family, occupy the outer panels. The central panel consists of the artist's desk,  engraving tools, a copper disk of the commissioned Fulbright engraving project, and an outward view in perspective of Hessisch Lichtenau (near to [[Kassel]]).&lt;ref name=Dinnerstein /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Russell|first=John|title=In Dinnerstein's Painting, An Echo Chamber|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 8, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Plants, photographs, old master's paintings,  children's grade school writing, and an exit visa from Russia, appear tacked to the wall of the studio.&lt;ref name=Smith /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dinnerstein /&gt;&lt;ref name="Introduction: Simon Dinnerstein's Family Romance"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andr√©|first=Michael|title=Simon Dinnerstein (Staempfli)|journal=Art News|date=March 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Triptych" is noted for its symmetry, meticulous detail,&lt;ref name=Messer /&gt; mixture of textures, and sense of space.

Widely praised, with each viewer bringing a different sensibility and interpretation of the work, the painting is the subject of numerous essays, articles, and books, including "The Suspension of Time: Reflections of Simon Dinnerstein's The Fulbright Triptych" edited by Daniel Slager, published 2011. Among the many who have commented on the painting are art critic [[John Russell (art critic)|John Russell]], [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] director [[Thomas M. Messer]], art historian [[Albert Boime]], artist [[George Tooker]], writer [[Anthony Doerr]], composer [[George Crumb]], poet [[Dan Beachy-Quick]], actor [[John Turturro]], and [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[Jhumpa Lahiri]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4860">'''Social interface''' is a concept from [[social science]] (particularly, [[media ecology (Marshall McLuhan) and sociology of technology]]). 

It can be approached from a theoretical or a practical perspective.

As a concept of social interface theory, social interface is defined by [[Norman Long (anthropologist) | Norman Long]] (1989, 2001). In 2001 his revised definition was:

{{cquote|"a social interface is a critical point of intersection between different [[lifeworld]]s, [[social field]]s or levels of [[social organization]], where [[social discontinuity|social discontinuities]] based upon discrepancies in values, interests, knowledges and power, are most likely to be located."&lt;ref name=long&gt;For old 1989 definition, see Long, Norman, ed. 1989. Encounters at the Interface: a Perspective in Social Discontinuities in Rural Development, Wageningse Sociologische Studies 27. Wageningen: Wageningen Agricultural University. For new 2001 definition, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y94nwmAgkI4C&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=%22Social+interface%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=9VyGSMHyMI6UiAHnmNDcAw&amp;sig=ACfU3U0JzvkhPV5yukxOcgG7WF8sIlvU0gGoogle Print, p.243] in Norman Long, ''Development Sociology: Actor Perspectives'', Routledge, 2001, {{ISBN|0-415-23535-9}}, &lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, interfaces are the areas in which social friction can be experienced and where [[technology diffusion|diffusion of new technology]] is leading to structural discontinuities (which can be both positive or negative), the interface is where they will occur. Long continues to say that:

{{cquote|" ... the concept implies face-to-face encounters between individuals or social units representing different interests and backed by different resources."&lt;ref name=long/&gt;}}

Identifying these interfaces and analyzing their effects shows how they are changed by everyday life, and how in return everyday life is changed by the interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Long, N. 1992. From paradigm lost to paradigm regained; the case of actor-oriented sociology of development. Pages 16-43 in N. Long and A. Long, editors. Battlefields of knowledge: the interlocking of theory and practice in social research and development. Routledge, New York, New York, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arce, A., and N. Long. 1992. The dynamics of knowledge: interfaces between bureaucrats and peasants. Pages 211-245 in N. Long and A. Long, editors. Battlefields of knowledge: the interlocking of theory and practice in social research and development. Routledge, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douthwaite, B., N. C. de Haan, V. Manyong, and D. Keatinge. 2001. Blending "hard" and "soft" science: the "follow-the-technology" approach to catalyzing and evaluating technology change. Conservation Ecology 5(2): 13. [online] URL: http://www.consecol.org/vol5/iss2/art13/ &lt;/ref&gt;

As practical concept of [[social interface design]], social interface is seen in the studies of [[human-computer interaction]] (in particular, its [[computer interface]] aspect). The basic thesis is that where a computer interface is more akin to another human, it can facilitate correct responses from users during human-to-computer interaction. Software that can provide such humanizing cues often does it by creating interface with human-like quality (such as giving recognizable [[gender]] to a [[software agent]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tourangeau R.; Couper M.P.; Steiger D.M., '' Humanizing self-administered surveys: experiments on social presence in web and IVR surveys'', Computers in Human Behavior, Volume 19, Number 1, January 2003 , pp. 1-24(24), [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/07475632/2003/00000019/00000001/art00032]&lt;/ref&gt; Studies are often concerned with how should such agents (like the [[Microsoft Agent]]) be designed to make them more appealing (is having [[facial expression]]s efficient, should the agent be [[anthropomorphic]], and so on). &lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Cusumano, Richard W. Selby, ''Microsoft Secrets: How the World's Most Powerful Software Company Creates Technology, Shakes Markets and Manages People''.

'''Traveler's Rest''' was a stopping point of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], located about one mile south of [[Lolo, Montana]]. The expedition stopped from September 9 to September 11, 1805, before crossing the [[Bitterroot Mountains]], and again on the return trip from June 30 to July 3, 1806. Traveler's Rest is at the eastern end of the [[Lolo Pass (Idaho‚ÄìMontana)|Lolo Trail]].&lt;ref name=trail&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/lewisandclark/site28.htm|title=Travelers Rest Montana|date=February 22, 2004|accessdate=November 27, 2011|work=Survey of Historic Sites and Buildings|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1960 and added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1966.&lt;ref name=nhlsum/&gt;&lt;ref name=nrhpinv2&gt;{{citation|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Travelers Rest|url={{NHLS url|id=66000437}} |format=pdf|date=June 14, 1976 |author=Blanche Higgins Schroer and Ray M.

Significant archeological findings made in 2002, including latrine sites with traces of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and fire hearths, make this the only site on the [[Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail]] that has yielded physical proof of the explorers' presence.&lt;ref name=arch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.visitmt.com/CMS/MobiRenderContent.aspx?contentGroupID=18963&amp;p=params=&amp;#124;&amp;#124;12373&amp;#124;&amp;#124;|title=Travelers' Rest State Park|accessdate=November 27, 2011|work=Visit Montana|publisher=Montana Office of Tourism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records made by Lewis and Clark often spell "Traveler's" [[American and British English spelling differences#Doubled consonants|as "Traveller's"]].&lt;ref name=nrhpinv2/&gt; This spot is largely unchanged from the days of Lewis and Clark.&lt;ref name=trail/&gt; From this location, Lewis and Clark split up to explore Montana during their return trip, not reuniting until they reached [[New Town, North Dakota|Sanish, North Dakota]].&lt;ref name=split&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/lewisandclark/tra.htm|title=Traveler's Rest|accessdate=November 27, 2011|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of landmark designation in 1960, the exact location of the expedition's campsite was unknown. Boundaries were formalized on December 12, 1983. Subsequent investigations revealed that errors had been made in setting the boundaries of the landmark. Detailed historical and scientific investigations resulted in a 55-page request for boundary corrections, submitted on May 10, 2004, and approved on March 21, 2006.&lt;ref name=redesig/&gt;&lt;ref name=redes2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20060428.HTM|title=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties|date=April 21, 2006|accessdate=November 27, 2011|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new road and bridge were built in 2006.&lt;ref name=nhlsum/&gt;

After departing here in 1806, Lewis' part of the expedition traveled to what is now the [[Alice Creek Historic District]].&lt;ref name="mdf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montanadiscoveryfoundation.org/Alice_Creek.pdf|title=Alice Creek/Lewis &amp; Clark Pass Lewis &amp; Clark History on the Helena National Forest|publisher=Montana Discovery Foundation|format=PDF|accessdate=March 18, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218060201/http://montanadiscoveryfoundation.org/Alice_Creek.pdf|archivedate=December 18, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
