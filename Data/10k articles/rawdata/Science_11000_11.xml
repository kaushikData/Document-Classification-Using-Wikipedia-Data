In the case of an educator, academic specialization pertains to the subject that he specializes in and teaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=To Want to Learn: Insights and Provocations for Engaged Learning, 2nd ed.|last=Kytle|first=Jackson|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2012|isbn=9780230338203|location=New York|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a precondition of objective truth and works by restricting the mind's propensity for [[eclecticism]] through methodological rigor and studious effort.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historics: Why History Dominates Contemporary Society|last=Davies|first=Martin|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=0415261651|location=New York|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also employed as an information-management strategy, which operates by fragmenting an issue into different aspective fields or areas of expertise to obtain truth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

== Development ==
As the volume of knowledge accumulated by humanity became too great, increasing specialization in academia appeared in response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yale Forest School News, Volumes 77-78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7AP0AAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22specialization%22|year=1990|publisher=Yale Forestry Alumni Assn.|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also cases when this concept emerged out of state policy-making to pursue goals such as [[Competition|national competitiveness]]. For instance, there is the case of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] who began coordinating academic specialization - through the founding of the [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] - to catch up to the [[United States]] and [[Germany]], particularly in the fields of scientific and technical education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of Universities: Volume XVIII/1 2003, Volume 18|last=Feingold|first=Mordechai|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=0199262020|location=Oxford|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8933">{{about|the representative body of the social sciences in the United Kingdom}}

The '''Academy of Social Sciences''' is a representative body for [[Social Sciences|social sciences]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. The Academy promotes social science through its sponsorship of the [[Campaign for Social Science]], its links with Government on a variety of matters, and its own policy work in issuing public comment, responding to official consultations, and organising meetings and events about social science. It confers the title of Fellow upon nominated social scientists following a process of peer review. The Academy comprises over 1000 Fellows and 41 [[Learned society|learned societies]] based in the UK and Europe.

== History and structure ==
The Academy’s origins lie in the formation of a representative body for the social science learned societies in 1982, the '''Association of Learned Societies in the Social Sciences''' ('''ALSISS'''). From 1999 to 2007 it was called the Academy of Learned Societies for the Social Sciences before changing to its current name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jordanwatch.co.uk/reports/details/03847936/academyofsocialsciences.html JordanWatch.uk], retrieved on 17 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy is run by a Council of 21 members, with Professor Roger Goodman FAcSS as its current Chair, and Professor Sir [[Ivor Crewe]] FAcSS, Master of [[University College, Oxford]], as its current President. 7 Council members are elected by the Academy’s Fellows, 7 by its Learned Societies and 7 are appointed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://acss.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Academy-of-Social-Sciences-Memorandum-and-Articles-of-Association-amended-March-2013.pdf Academy website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy ==
The Academy advocates social science by interacting with Government and other organisations, and co-ordinates the responses of social scientists to Government consultation documents. Past consultations include:

* Independent Review of Implementation of [[RCUK]] Policy on Open Access.
* [[Public Administration Select Committee]] Enquiry on 'Building Civil service Skills for the Future'
* The [[Office for National Statistics]] consultation on the future of the Census &lt;ref&gt;[http://acss.org.uk/publication-category/consultation-responses/ Academy website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy also puts forward suggestions to the Government about which social scientists should carry out its Foresight research projects,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bis.gov.uk/foresight/ BIS website]&lt;/ref&gt; which look at important issues and how these might change over the next 20 to 80 years.

A developing part of the Academy’s work is to bring researchers and organisations using research closer together to improve the evidence upon which public policy is based and to increase the impact of research.

== Publications and events ==
The Academy has produced a series of [http://acss.org.uk/publication-category/making-the-case/ ‘Making the Case for the Social Sciences’] booklets which give examples of important social science research which has made a difference to policy or practice. These are: Wellbeing; Ageing; Sustainability; the Environment and Climate Change; Crime; Sport and Leisure; Management; Scotland; Longitudinal Studies, Mental Wellbeing, Wales and Dementia. Further titles are in preparation. The Academy also publishes a cross-disciplinary peer-reviewed journal, [http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rsoc21/current#.Uo34U9K9lA0 ''Contemporary Social Science'']. The Academy holds regular events, such as conferences on the ethics of social media research and the future of the [[Research Excellence Framework]]. It holds an Annual Lecture each summer, and its President's Lunch each winter. It also arranges (with the [[British Library]]) a public lecture series Enduring Ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/bldept/socsci/events/socscievents.html | title=Social sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fellows==
{{main|Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences}}
Part of the Academy’s work is to recognise social scientists who are held in esteem by their peer group and whose life and work have had an impact in advancing social science. They are nominated and the nominations are then subject to peer review. Fellows are academics, policy-makers and practitioners, and are entitled to use the letters "FAcSS" after their name. In November 2014 there were 1000 Fellows, just over 1% of the 90,000 total membership of the 41 learned society members of the Academy.

Fellows were previously known as Academicians and used the post-nominal letter "AcSS". This was changed in July 2014 to bring the Academy in line with other British [[learned societies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academicians now 'Fellows of the Academy of Social Sciences'|url=http://acss.org.uk/news/academicians-now-fellows-academy-social-science/|website=News|publisher=Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=4 September 2014|date=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaign for Social Science ==
The Academy launched the [[Campaign for Social Science]] in January 2011 to advocate social science to Government and the general public. The Campaign is self-funded. It has campaigned for the restoration of the post of Government Chief Social Scientific Adviser,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/mar/19/the-case-for-a-chief-social-scientist Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt; promotes social science in the media and on the web, and organises roadshows around the country to emphasise the value and importance of social science.

'''Addgene''' is a non-profit [[plasmid]] repository. Addgene facilitates the exchange of genetic material between laboratories by offering plasmids and their associated cloning data to not-for-profit laboratories around the world. Addgene provides a free online database of plasmid cloning information and references, including lists of commonly used vector backbones, popular [[lentiviral]] plasmids and [[molecular cloning]] protocols.

==History==
Addgene was founded in 2004, by Melina Fan, Kenneth Fan and Benjie Chen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scudellari|first=Megan|title=Sharing Made Easy|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/32532/title/Sharing-Made-Easy/|work=The Scientist|accessdate=21 November 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fan|first=M|author2=Tsai, J|author3= Chen, B|author4= Fan, K|author5= LaBaer, J|title=A central repository for published plasmids.|journal=Science|date=Mar 25, 2005|volume=307|issue=5717|pages=1877|pmid=15790830|doi=10.1126/science.307.5717.1877a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operations ==
Addgene's headquarters are located in [[Watertown, MA|Watertown, Massachusetts]].

Addgene accepts plasmids from researchers for distribution and archival. Addgene obtains revenues and licensing fees using the free depository for commercial sale, and is selective at will in selling acquired depository plasmids to 501 (c) 3 nonprofit organizations at the industrial price for profit gains for its putative non-profit operation. 

The organization covers the operating costs of maintaining and improving the collection by charging a nominal fee to scientists requesting plasmids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kamens|first=J|title=Got any plasmids?|url=http://www.labtimes.org/labtimes/issues/lt2012/lt01/lt_2012_01_58_59.pdf|work=Lab Times|accessdate=21 November 2012|pages=58–59|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plasmid repository ==
As of 2014 Addgene's repository comprised 30,000 plasmids, deposited by 1,700 labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Monya|title=Repositories share key research tools|url=http://www.nature.com/news/repositories-share-key-research-tools-1.14511|publisher=Nature.com|accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its plasmid collection contains plasmids used for functions such as  [[genome engineering]] (including CRISPRS), [[gene expression]], [[shRNA]] knockdown, viral-mediated gene delivery, detection of [[miRNA]] and promoter activity. The plasmid collection includes:

* Genome engineering
** [[CRISPR]]s
** [[Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nuclease]] (TALEN) kits
** [[Zinc finger nuclease]] kits
* Empty backbones
** Species-specific expression
** Epitope tags
** Fusion proteins
** Selectable markers
** [[Fluorescent marker]]
* Viral vectors
** Retroviral/Lentiviral
** [[Adenoviral]]
** [[Adeno-associated virus|AAV]]
* [[cDNA]] expression
* shRNA expression

==Tools and guides==

'''Molecular biology tools'''

[http://www.addgene.org/vector-database/ Vector Database]—A curated list of over 4,000 vector backbones, including relevant cloning information and bacterial growth conditions.

[http://www.addgene.org/analyze-sequence/ Sequence Analyzer]—An Addgene software tool  for creating plasmid maps from sequences with annotated features and restriction sites.

[http://www.addgene.org/mol_bio_reference/ Molecular Biology Reference]—A collection of references for molecular biology reagents, such as primers, restriction enzymes and antibiotic concentrations.

'''Plasmid Cloning Guides'''

[http://www.addgene.org/plasmid_reference/ Molecular Cloning Guides]—References to help scientists design plasmid cloning experiments, including tutorials on restriction enzyme digestion and PCR-based cloning.

[http://www.addgene.org/plasmid_reference/index/ Molecular Cloning Protocols]—Specific protocols for a variety of plasmid cloning techniques, such as isolation of bacterial colonies, DNA purification by [[gel electrophoresis]] and bacterial transformation.

==Collaborations==

Addgene collaborates with institutes and consortia to curate plasmid collections for specific purposes. Examples of these collaborations include special collections from the [[Structural Genomics Consortium]], Zinc Finger Consortium, the Cell Migration Consortium, the [[Krüppel-like factors|KLF]] collection and [[The Michael J. Fox Foundation]].&lt;ref name="MassHighTech"&gt;{{cite web|last=Resende|first=Patricia|title=Addgene partners with Michael J. Fox Foundation|url=http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2012/10/01/daily32-Addgene-partners-with-Michael-J-Fox-Foundation.html|work=Mass High Tech|accessdate=21 November 2012|date=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plasmids are available to both academic and industry labs.

==Depositors==
Noteworthy depositors include:{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}
*12 Nobel Prize winners; [[John Gurdon]], [[Shinya Yamanaka]], [[Bruce Beutler]], [[Mario Capecchi]], [[Andrew Fire]], [[Richard Axel]], [[Eric Wieschaus]], [[Phillip Sharp]], [[Robert Lefkowitz]], [[Martin Chalfie]], [[Roger Tsien]] and [[Johann Deisenhofer]].
*8 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences winners; [[Cori Bargmann]], [[David Botstein]], [[Lewis C. Cantley]], [[Hans Clevers]], [[Titia de Lange]], [[Bert Vogelstein]], [[Robert Weinberg]] and [[Shinya Yamanaka]].

==Electronic Material Transfer Agreements==

Addgene requires [[Material Transfer Agreement]]s (MTAs) for all materials transferred through Addgene to protect the intellectual property of plasmid depositors. Addgene developed one of the first electronic systems for handling MTAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herscovitch|first=Melanie|author2=Perkins, Eric|author3= Baltus, Andy|author4= Fan, Melina|title=Addgene provides an open forum for plasmid sharing|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=10 April 2012|volume=30|issue=4|pages=316–317|doi=10.1038/nbt.2177|pmid=22491276}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By using the standard Universal Biological Material Transfer Agreement (UBMTA) and implementing electronic signatures, Addgene’s electronic MTA (eMTA) system expedites the approval process for plasmid orders.

==Awards==
Addgene won awards for innovation and research including Mass Nonprofit Network Award for excellence in Innovations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=mass nonprofit network nominates addgene for an excellence award|url=http://www.prlog.org/12151032-mass-nonprofit-network-nominates-addgene-for-an-excellence-award.pdf|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=mass non-profit, nonprofit award 2013 excellence in innovation finalists|url=http://www.massnonprofitnet.org/training-and-events/nonprofit-awareness-day/2013-excellence-awards/2013-excellence-in-innovation-finalists/|accessdate=9 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902084152/http://www.massnonprofitnet.org/training-and-events/nonprofit-awareness-day/2013-excellence-awards/2013-excellence-in-innovation-finalists/|archive-date=2013-09-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge award program 2014 Award for Research &amp; Development Laboratories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=cambridge recognition awarding|url=http://cambridge.cambridge.recognitionawarding.com/PressReleaseub.aspx?cc=DC7-EQ7D-W633|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass Technology Leadership Award Finalist 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mass Tech announces finalist|url=http://blog.masstlc.org/2012/07/masstlc-announces-finalist-for-15th_20.html|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Condensed matter physics|expanded=Soft matter}}
In [[condensed matter physics]] and [[materials science]], an '''amorphous''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''a'', without, ''morphé'', shape, form) or '''non-crystalline solid''' is a [[solid]] that lacks the [[long-range order]] that is characteristic of a [[crystal]]. In some older books, the term has been used synonymously with [[glass]]. Nowadays, "glassy solid" or "amorphous solid" is considered to be the overarching concept, and glass the more special case: Glass is an amorphous solid that exhibits a [[glass transition]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Zarzycki: Les verres et l'état vitreux. Paris: Masson 1982. English translation available.&lt;/ref&gt; Polymers are often amorphous. Other types of amorphous solids include [[gel]]s, [[thin film]]s, and nanostructured materials such as glass.
[[File:Bulk Metallic Glass Sample.jpg|thumb|[[Amorphous metal]]s have low [[toughness]], but high strength]]
Amorphous materials have an internal structure made of interconnected structural blocks. These blocks can be similar to the basic structural units found in the corresponding crystalline phase of the same compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = Juraj|last1 = Mavračić|first2 = Felix C.|last2 = Mocanu|first3 = Volker L.|last3 = Deringer|first4 = Gábor|last4 = Csányi|first5 = Stephen R.|last5 = Elliott|title = Similarity Between Amorphous and Crystalline Phases: The Case of TiO₂|journal = [[J.

In pharmaceutical industry, the amorphous drugs were shown to have higher bioavailability than their crystalline counterparts due to the high solubility of amorphous phase. Moreover, certain compounds can undergo precipitation in their amorphous form ''[[In vivo supersaturation|in vivo]]'', and they can decrease each other's bioavailability if administered together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsieh|first=Yi-Ling|last2=Ilevbare|first2=Grace A.|last3=Van Eerdenbrugh|first3=Bernard|last4=Box|first4=Karl J.|last5=Sanchez-Felix|first5=Manuel Vincente|last6=Taylor|first6=Lynne S.|date=2012-05-12|title=pH-Induced Precipitation Behavior of Weakly Basic Compounds: Determination of Extent and Duration of Supersaturation Using Potentiometric Titration and Correlation to Solid State Properties|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s11095-012-0759-8|journal=Pharmaceutical Research|language=en|volume=29|issue=10|pages=2738–2753|doi=10.1007/s11095-012-0759-8|issn=0724-8741}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dengale|first=Swapnil Jayant|last2=Grohganz|first2=Holger|last3=Rades|first3=Thomas|last4=Löbmann|first4=Korbinian|date=May 2016|title=Recent advances in co-amorphous drug formulations|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addr.2015.12.009|journal=Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews|volume=100|pages=116–125|doi=10.1016/j.addr.2015.12.009|issn=0169-409X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nano-structured materials==
Even amorphous materials have some shortrange order at the atomic length scale due to the nature of [[chemical bond]]ing (see [[structure of liquids and glasses]] for more information on non-crystalline material structure). Furthermore, in very small [[crystal]]s a large fraction of the [[atom]]s are the crystal; relaxation of the surface and interfacial effects distort the atomic positions, decreasing the structural order. Even the most advanced structural characterization techniques, such as x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, have difficulty in distinguishing between amorphous and crystalline structures on these length scales.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

== Amorphous thin films ==
{{Context|section|date=January 2014}}
Amorphous phases are important constituents of [[thin film]]s, which are solid layers of a few [[nanometre]]s to some tens of [[micrometre]]s thickness deposited upon a substrate. So-called structure zone models were developed to describe the micro structure and ceramics of thin films as a function of the [[homologous temperature]] ''T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' that is the ratio of deposition temperature over melting temperature.&lt;ref name=MoDe1969&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = B. A.|last1 = Movchan|first2 = A. V.|last2 = Demchishin|title= Study of the structure and properties of thick vacuum condensates of nickel, titanium, tungsten, aluminium oxide and zirconium dioxide|journal = [[Phys. Met. Metallogr.]]|volume = 28|pages = 83–90|year = 1969}}&lt;br /&gt;Russian-language version: ''Fiz. Metal Metalloved'' (1969) '''28''': 653-660.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thor1974&gt;{{cite journal|first = John A.|last = Thornton|title = Influence of apparatus geometry and deposition conditions on the structure and topography of thick sputtered coatings|journal = [[J. Vac. Sci. Technol.]]|volume = 11|issue = 4|pages = 666–670|year = 1974|doi = 10.1116/1.1312732|bibcode = 1974JVST...11..666T}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these models, a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the occurrence of amorphous phases is that ''T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' has to be smaller than 0.3, that is the deposition temperature must be below 30% of the melting temperature. For higher values, the surface diffusion of deposited atomic species would allow for the formation of crystallites with long range atomic order.

Regarding their applications, amorphous metallic layers played an important role in the discussion of a suspected [[superconductivity]] in [[amorphous metal]]s.&lt;ref name=Buck1961&gt;{{cite conference|last=Buckel|first=W.|title=The influence of crystal bonds on film growth|booktitle=Elektrische en Magnetische Eigenschappen van dunne Metallaagies|place=Leuven, Belgium|date=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[optical coating]]s made from [[Titanium dioxide|TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Silicon dioxide|SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Tantalum pentoxide|Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] etc. and combinations of them in most cases consist of amorphous phases of these compounds. Much research is carried out into thin amorphous films as a gas separating [[Biological membrane|membrane]] layer.&lt;ref name=Vos1998&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = Renate M.|last1 = de Vos|first2 = Henk|last2 = Verweij|title = High-Selectivity, High-Flux Silica Membranes for Gas Separation|journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume = 279|issue = 5357|pages = 1710–1711|year = 1998|pmid = 9497287|doi = 10.1126/science.279.5357.1710|bibcode = 1998Sci...279.1710D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technologically most important thin amorphous film is probably represented by few nm thin SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers serving as isolator above the conducting channel of a metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor ([[MOSFET]]). Also, hydrogenated [[amorphous silicon]], a-Si:H in short, is of technical significance for [[thin-film solar cells]]. In case of a-Si:H the missing long-range order between silicon atoms is partly induced by the presence by hydrogen in the percent range.

The occurrence of amorphous phases turned out as a phenomenon of particular interest for studying thin-film growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Electronic structure and chemical bonding of amorphous chromium carbide thin films|first1 = Martin|last1 = Magnuson|first2 = Matilda|last2 = Andersson|first3 = Jun|last3 = Lu|first4 = Lars|last4 = Hultman|first5 = Ulf|last5 = Jansson|year = 2012|journal = [[J.

The most investigated example is represented by thin multicrystalline silicon films, where such as the unoriented molecule. An initial amorphous layer was observed in many studies.&lt;ref name=Birk2001&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = M.|last1 = Birkholz|first2 = B.|last2 = Selle|first3 = W.|last3 = Fuhs|first4 = S.|last4 = Christiansen|first5 = H.

The phenomenon has been interpreted in the framework of [[Polymorphism (materials science)#Ostwald's rule|Ostwald's rule]] of stages&lt;ref name=Ostw1897&gt;{{cite journal|first = Wilhelm|last = Ostwald|authorlink = Wilhelm Ostwald|title = Studien über die Bildung und Umwandlung fester Körper|language = German|journal = [[Z.

Banxing was used to relay images of the Shenzhou 7 spacecraft.&lt;ref name="EA-SZ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/shezhou7.htm|title=Shenzhou 7 |last=Wade|first=Mark|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]]|accessdate=2008-10-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080928194458/http://www.astronautix.com/flights/shezhou7.htm| archivedate= 28 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weighing some 40 kilograms, and containing two cameras and communication equipment, it was maneuvered using an ammonia gas-based propulsion system.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt;  Following the re-entry of Shenzhou 7, Banxing remained in orbit as part of a formation-flying experiment with the discarded Shenzhou orbital module.&lt;ref name="AW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&amp;id=news/Subsat101008.xml&amp;headline=Subsat%20Orbiting%20Empty%20Module|title=Subsat Orbiting Empty Module|last=Covault|first=Craig |date=2008-10-10|publisher=[[Aviation Week]]|accessdate=2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though most of the mass in the universe seems to be in the form of dark matter, Big Bang theory and various observations seem to indicate that it is not made out of conventional [[baryonic matter]] (protons, neutrons, and electrons) but it is unclear exactly what it ''is'' made out of.

Since [[Georges Lemaître]] first noted in 1927 that an expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point, scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion.

American astronomer Edwin Hubble observed that the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their [[redshift]]s. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction.&lt;ref name="hubble"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the [[Copernican principle]] (that the Earth is not the center of the universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others. Since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion of the universe implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past.

Large [[particle accelerator]]s can replicate the conditions that prevailed after the early moments of the universe, resulting in confirmation and refinement of the details of the Big Bang model. However, these accelerators can only probe so far into [[high-energy physics|high energy regimes]]. Consequently, the state of the universe in the earliest instants of the Big Bang expansion is still poorly understood and an area of open investigation and speculation.

The first [[subatomic particle]]s to be formed included [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s, and [[electron]]s. Though simple [[big bang nucleosynthesis|atomic nuclei formed]] within the first three minutes after the Big Bang, thousands of years passed before the first [[Recombination (cosmology)|electrically neutral atoms formed]]. The majority of atoms produced by the Big Bang were [[hydrogen]], along with [[helium]] and traces of [[lithium]]. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through [[gravity]] to form [[star]]s and galaxies, and the heavier elements were synthesized either [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|within stars]] or [[supernova nucleosynthesis|during supernovae]].

The Big Bang theory offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the [[cosmic microwave background|CMB]], [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|large scale structure]], and [[Hubble's Law]].&lt;ref name=Wright2009&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework for the Big Bang model relies on [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] and on simplifying assumptions such as [[homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneity]] and [[isotropy]] of space. The governing equations were formulated by [[Alexander Friedmann]], and similar solutions were worked on by [[Willem de Sitter]]. Since then, astrophysicists have incorporated observational and theoretical additions into the Big Bang model, and its [[parametrization]] as the [[Lambda-CDM model]] serves as the framework for current investigations of theoretical cosmology. The Lambda-CDM model is the current "standard model" of Big Bang cosmology, [[Scientific consensus|consensus]] is that it is the simplest model that can account for the various measurements and [[Observational cosmology|observations relevant to cosmology]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] indicates that [[general relativity]] is not an adequate description of the [[laws of physics]] in this regime. Models based on general relativity alone can not extrapolate toward the singularity beyond the end of the [[Planck epoch]].

This primordial singularity is itself sometimes called "the Big Bang",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roos |first=M. |editor1-first=O. |editor1-last=Engvold |editor2-first=R. |editor2-last=Stabell |editor3-first=B. |editor3-last=Czerny |editor4-first=J. |editor4-last=Lattanzio |title=Astronomy and Astrophysics |chapter=Expansion of the Universe – Standard Big Bang Model |series=Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |date=2008 |arxiv=0802.2005 |quote=This singularity is termed the ''Big Bang''. |ref=harv|bibcode = 2008arXiv0802.2005R }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the term can also refer to a more generic early hot, dense phase&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Drees |first=W.

In either case, "the Big Bang" as an event is also colloquially referred to as the "birth" of our universe since it represents the point in history where the universe can be verified to have entered into a [[Equation of state (cosmology)|regime]] where the laws of physics as we understand them (specifically general relativity and the [[Standard Model|standard model of particle physics]]) work. Based on measurements of the expansion using [[Type Ia supernova]]e and measurements of temperature fluctuations in the [[cosmic microwave background]], the time that has passed since that event — otherwise known as the "[[age of the universe]]" — is 13.799 ± 0.021&amp;nbsp;billion years.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Planck Collaboration |title=Planck 2015 results.

Despite being extremely [[density|dense]] at this time—far denser than is usually required to form a [[black hole]]—the universe did not re-collapse into a black hole. This may be explained by considering that commonly-used calculations and limits for [[gravitational collapse]] are usually based upon objects of relatively constant size, such as [[star]]s, and do not apply to [[metric expansion of space|rapidly expanding space]] such as the Big Bang.

=== Inflation and baryogenesis ===
{{Main| Cosmic inflation|baryogenesis}}
The earliest phases of the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models the universe was filled [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneously]] and [[isotropic]]ally with a very high [[energy density]] and huge temperatures and [[pressure]]s and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−37&lt;/sup&gt; seconds into the expansion, a [[phase transition]] caused a [[cosmic inflation]], during which the universe grew [[exponential growth|exponentially]] during which time [[Quantum fluctuation|density fluctuations]] that occurred because of the [[uncertainty principle]] were amplified into the seeds that would later form the [[Structure formation|large-scale structure]] of the universe.&lt;ref name="guth"&gt;{{cite book

This resulted in the predominance of [[matter]] over [[antimatter]] in the present universe.&lt;ref name="kolb_c6"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The universe continued to decrease in density and fall in temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. [[Explicit symmetry breaking|Symmetry breaking]] phase transitions put the [[fundamental force]]s of physics and the parameters of [[elementary particles]] into their present form.&lt;ref name="kolb_c7"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt; After about 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in [[particle accelerator]]s. At about 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form [[baryon]]s such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was now no longer high enough to create new proton–antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons–antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons. After these annihilations, the remaining protons, neutrons and electrons were no longer moving relativistically and the energy density of the universe was dominated by [[photon]]s (with a minor contribution from [[neutrino]]s).

A few minutes into the expansion, when the temperature was about a billion (one thousand million) [[kelvin]] and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the universe's [[deuterium]] and helium [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] in a process called [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="kolb_c4"/&gt; Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei.&lt;ref name="peacock_c9"/&gt;

As the universe cooled, the [[rest mass]] energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate that of the photon [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]]. After about 379,000 years, the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic radiation is known as the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]].&lt;ref name="peacock_c9"&gt;Peacock (1999), chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Biochemistry|chemistry of life]] may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, [[Age of the universe|13.8 billion years ago]], during a habitable epoch when the universe was only 10–17 million years old.&lt;ref name="Loeb_2014"&gt;{{cite web |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |format=PDF |publisher=Cambridge University Press / Astronomy Department, Harvard University |date=24 September 2014 |url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~loeb/habitable.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |date=October 2014 |journal=[[International Journal of Astrobiology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |doi=10.1017/S1473550414000196 |arxiv=1312.0613 |bibcode=2014IJAsB..13..337L|citeseerx=10.1.1.748.4820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141202"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dreifus |first=Claudia |authorlink=Claudia Dreifus |title=Much-Discussed Views That Go Way Back - Avi Loeb Ponders the Early Universe, Nature and Life |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/science/avi-loeb-ponders-the-early-universe-nature-and-life.html |date=2 December 2014 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cosmic acceleration ===
{{Main|Accelerating expansion of the universe}}
Independent lines of evidence from Type Ia supernovae and the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] imply that the universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as [[dark energy]], which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form. When the universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused the [[Hubble's law|expansion of the universe]] to slowly begin to accelerate.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt;

Dark energy in its simplest formulation takes the form of the [[cosmological constant]] term in [[Einstein's field equation]]s of general relativity, but its composition and mechanism are unknown and, more generally, the details of its [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] and relationship with the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics continue to be investigated both through observation and theoretically.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt;

All of this cosmic evolution after the [[inflationary epoch]] can be rigorously described and modeled by the ΛCDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks of quantum mechanics and Einstein's General Relativity. There is no well-supported model describing the action prior to 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; seconds or so. Apparently a new unified theory of [[quantum gravity|quantum gravitation]] is needed to break this barrier. Understanding this earliest of eras in the history of the universe is currently one of the greatest [[unsolved problems in physics]].

== Features of the model ==
The Big Bang theory depends on two major assumptions: the universality of [[physical law]]s and the [[cosmological principle]]. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the universe is [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]] and [[isotropy|isotropic]].

These ideas were initially taken as postulates, but today there are efforts to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the [[fine structure constant]] over much of the [[age of the universe]] is of order 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

If the large-scale universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth, the cosmological principle can be derived from the simpler [[Copernican principle]], which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point. To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; via observations of the CMB. The universe has been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the 10% level.&lt;ref&gt;

===Expansion of space===
{{Main|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Metric expansion of space}}
General relativity describes spacetime by a [[metric tensor|metric]], which determines the distances that separate nearby points. The points, which can be galaxies, stars, or other objects, are themselves specified using a [[coordinate chart]] or "grid" that is laid down over all [[spacetime]]. The cosmological principle implies that the metric should be [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]] and [[isotropic]] on large scales, which uniquely singles out the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] (FLRW metric). 
This metric contains a [[scale factor]], which describes how the size of the universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a [[coordinate system]] to be made, called [[comoving coordinates]]. In this coordinate system, the grid expands along with the universe, and objects that are moving only because of the expansion of the universe, remain at fixed points on the grid. While their ''coordinate'' distance ([[comoving distance]]) remains constant, the ''physical'' distance between two such co-moving points expands proportionally with the [[scale factor]] of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;

The Big Bang is not an explosion of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe. Instead, [[metric expansion of space|space itself expands]] with time everywhere and increases the physical distance between two comoving points. In other words, the Big Bang is not an explosion ''in space'', but rather an expansion ''of space''.&lt;ref name="HTUW"/&gt; Because the FLRW metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy, it applies to our universe only on large scales—local concentrations of matter such as our galaxy are gravitationally bound and as such do not experience the large-scale expansion of space.&lt;ref&gt;Tamara M. Davis and Charles H. Lineweaver, ''Expanding Confusion: common misconceptions of cosmological horizons and the superluminal expansion of the Universe''. [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0310808 astro-ph/0310808]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horizons===
{{Main|List of cosmological horizons}}
An important feature of the Big Bang spacetime is the presence of [[particle horizon]]s. Since the universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past whose light has not had time to reach us. This places a limit or a ''past horizon'' on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by us today may never "catch up" to very distant objects. This defines a ''future horizon'', which limits the events in the future that we will be able to influence. The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|FLRW]] model that describes our universe.&lt;ref name="kolb_c3"/&gt;

Our understanding of the universe back to very early times [[Big Bang#Horizon problem|suggests]] that there is a past horizon, though in practice our view is also limited by the opacity of the universe at early times. So our view cannot extend further backward in time, though the horizon recedes in space. If the expansion of the universe continues to [[accelerating universe|accelerate]], there is a future horizon as well.&lt;ref name="kolb_c3"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of the Big Bang theory}}
{{See also|Timeline of cosmological theories}}

===Etymology===
English astronomer [[Fred Hoyle]] is credited with coining the term "Big Bang" during a 1949 BBC radio broadcast, saying: "These theories were based on the hypothesis that all the matter in the universe was created in one big bang at a particular time in the remote past."&lt;ref&gt;

It is popularly reported that Hoyle, who favored an alternative "[[steady state universe|steady state]]" cosmological model, intended this to be pejorative,&lt;ref&gt;

The Big Bang theory developed from observations of the structure of the universe and from theoretical considerations. In 1912 [[Vesto Slipher]] measured the first [[Doppler shift]] of a "[[spiral nebula]]" (spiral nebula is the obsolete term for spiral galaxies), and soon discovered that almost all such nebulae were receding from Earth. He did not grasp the cosmological implications of this fact, and indeed at the time it was [[Shapley–Curtis debate|highly controversial]] whether or not these nebulae were "island universes" outside our [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;

Independently deriving Friedmann's equations in 1927, [[Georges Lemaître]], a Belgian physicist, proposed that the inferred recession of the nebulae was due to the expansion of the universe.&lt;ref name=gl1927&gt;

}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 Lemaître went further and suggested that the evident expansion of the universe, if projected back in time, meant that the further in the past the smaller the universe was, until at some finite time in the past all the mass of the universe was concentrated into a single point, a "primeval atom" where and when the fabric of time and space came into existence.&lt;ref&gt;

Starting in 1924, Hubble painstakingly developed a series of distance indicators, the forerunner of the [[cosmic distance ladder]], using the {{convert|100|in|m|adj=on}} [[Hooker telescope]] at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]]. This allowed him to estimate distances to galaxies whose redshifts had already been measured, mostly by Slipher. In 1929 Hubble discovered a correlation between distance and recession velocity—now known as [[Hubble's law]].&lt;ref name="hubble"/&gt;&lt;ref name="christianson"&gt;

In the 1920s and 1930s almost every major cosmologist preferred an eternal [[Steady state theory|steady state]] universe, and several complained that the beginning of time implied by the Big Bang imported religious concepts into physics; this objection was later repeated by supporters of the steady state theory.&lt;ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, observations of certain [[globular cluster]]s appeared to indicate that they were about 15&amp;nbsp;billion years old, which [[cosmic age problem|conflicted]] with most then-current estimates of the age of the universe (and indeed with the age measured today).

The earliest and most direct observational evidence of the validity of the theory are the expansion of the universe according to [[Hubble's law]] (as indicated by the redshifts of galaxies), discovery and measurement of the [[cosmic microwave background]] and the relative abundances of light elements produced by [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]].

===Hubble's law and the expansion of space===
{{Main|Hubble's law|Metric expansion of space}}
{{See also|Distance measures (cosmology)|Scale factor (universe)}}
Observations of distant galaxies and [[quasar]]s show that these objects are redshifted—the [[light]] emitted from them has been shifted to longer wavelengths. This can be seen by taking a [[frequency spectrum]] of an object and matching the [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] pattern of [[emission line]]s or [[absorption line]]s corresponding to [[atom]]s of the [[chemical element]]s interacting with the light. These redshifts are [[Homogeneity (physics)|uniformly]] isotropic, distributed evenly among the observed objects in all directions. If the redshift is interpreted as a Doppler shift, the recessional [[velocity]] of the object can be calculated. For some galaxies, it is possible to estimate distances via the [[cosmic distance ladder]]. When the recessional velocities are plotted against these distances, a linear relationship known as Hubble's law is observed:&lt;ref name="hubble" /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;v = H_0D&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the recessional [[velocity]] of the [[galaxy]] or other distant object,
* &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the [[comoving distance]] to the object, and
* &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is [[Hubble's constant]], measured to be {{val|70.4|+1.3|-1.4}} [[kilometres|km]]/[[second|s]]/[[Megaparsec|Mpc]] by the [[WMAP]] probe.&lt;ref name="wmap7year" /&gt;

[[Hubble's law]] has two possible explanations. Either we are at the center of an explosion of galaxies—which is untenable given the [[Copernican principle]]—or the universe is [[Metric expansion of space|uniformly expanding]] everywhere. This universal expansion was predicted from general relativity by Alexander Friedmann in 1922&lt;ref name=af1922 /&gt; and Georges Lemaître in 1927,&lt;ref name=gl1927 /&gt; well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann, Lemaître, Robertson, and Walker]].

The theory requires the relation &lt;math&gt;v = HD&lt;/math&gt; to hold at all times, where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the [[comoving distance]], ''v'' is the [[recessional velocity]], and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; vary as the universe expands (hence we write &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; to denote the present-day Hubble "constant"). For distances much smaller than the size of the [[observable universe]], the Hubble redshift can be thought of as the Doppler shift corresponding to the recession velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. However, the redshift is not a true Doppler shift, but rather the result of the expansion of the universe between the time the light was emitted and the time that it was detected.&lt;ref name="peacock_c3"&gt;Peacock (1999), chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

That [[Metric expansion of space|space is undergoing metric expansion]] is shown by direct observational evidence of the [[Cosmological principle]] and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical redshifts are extremely [[isotropic]] and [[Homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneous]],&lt;ref name="hubble" /&gt; supporting the Cosmological principle that the universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts were the result of an explosion from a center distant from us, they would not be so similar in different directions.

Measurements of the effects of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the Copernican principle, that, on a cosmological scale, the Earth is not in a central position.&lt;ref&gt;

Uniform cooling of the CMB over billions of years is explainable only if the universe is experiencing a metric expansion, and excludes the possibility that we are near the unique center of an explosion.

In 1964 [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] serendipitously discovered the cosmic background radiation, an omnidirectional signal in the [[microwave]] band.&lt;ref name="penzias" /&gt; Their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the big-bang predictions by Alpher, Herman and Gamow around 1950. Through the 1970s the radiation was found to be approximately consistent with a black body spectrum in all directions; this spectrum has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe, and today corresponds to approximately 2.725&amp;nbsp;K. This tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, and Penzias and Wilson were awarded a [[Nobel Prize]] in 1978.

The ''surface of last scattering'' corresponding to emission of the CMB occurs shortly after ''[[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]]'', the epoch when neutral hydrogen becomes stable. Prior to this, the universe comprised a hot dense photon-baryon plasma sea where photons were quickly [[Thomson scattering|scattered]] from free charged particles. Peaking at around {{val|372|14|u=kyr}},&lt;ref name="WMAP2003Spergel" /&gt; the mean free path for a photon becomes long enough to reach the present day and the universe becomes transparent.

In 1989, [[NASA]] launched the [[Cosmic Background Explorer satellite]] (COBE), which made two major advances: in 1990, high-precision spectrum measurements showed that the &lt;abbr title="cosmic microwave background raditation"&gt;CMB&lt;/abbr&gt; frequency spectrum is an almost perfect [[blackbody]] with no deviations at a level of 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and measured a residual temperature of 2.726&amp;nbsp;K (more recent measurements have revised this figure down slightly to 2.7255&amp;nbsp;K); then in 1992, further COBE measurements discovered tiny fluctuations (anisotropies) in the CMB temperature across the sky, at a level of about one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="cobe" /&gt; [[John C. Mather]] and [[George Smoot]] were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for their leadership in these results.

During the following decade, CMB anisotropies were further investigated by a large number of ground-based and balloon experiments. In 2000–2001 several experiments, most notably [[BOOMERanG experiment|BOOMERanG]], found the [[shape of the universe]] to be spatially almost flat by measuring the typical angular size (the size on the sky) of the anisotropies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Melchiorri |first=A., et. al. |title=A measurement of Omega from the North American test flight of BOOMERANG |volume=536 |issue=2 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |year=1999 |arxiv=astro-ph/9911445|doi=10.1086/312744 |pmid=10859119 |bibcode=2000ApJ...536L..63M |pages=L63–L66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Bernardis |first=P. |display-authors=etal |title=A Flat Universe from High-Resolution Maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation |pages=955–959 |journal=Nature |volume=404 |issue=6781 |year=2000 |arxiv=

In early 2003, the first results of the [[WMAP|Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) were released, yielding what were at the time the most accurate values for some of the cosmological parameters. The results disproved several specific [[cosmic inflation]] models, but are consistent with the [[inflation theory]] in general.&lt;ref name="wmap1year" /&gt; The [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] space probe was launched in May 2009. Other ground and balloon based [[List of cosmic microwave background experiments|cosmic microwave background experiments]] are ongoing.

===Abundance of primordial elements===
{{Main|Big Bang nucleosynthesis}}
Using the Big Bang model it is possible to calculate the concentration of [[helium-4]], [[helium-3]], deuterium, and [[lithium-7]] in the universe as ratios to the amount of ordinary hydrogen.&lt;ref name = "kolb_c4"/&gt; The relative abundances depend on a single parameter, the ratio of [[photon]]s to baryons. This value can be calculated independently from the detailed structure of [[cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] fluctuations. The ratios predicted (by mass, not by number) are about 0.25 for &lt;chem&gt;^4He/H&lt;/chem&gt;, about 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;chem&gt;^2H/H&lt;/chem&gt;, about 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;chem&gt;^3He/H&lt;/chem&gt; and about 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;chem&gt;^7Li/H&lt;/chem&gt;.&lt;ref name="kolb_c4"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The measured abundances all agree at least roughly with those predicted from a single value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. The agreement is excellent for deuterium, close but formally discrepant for &lt;chem&gt;^4He&lt;/chem&gt;, and off by a factor of two for &lt;chem&gt;^7Li&lt;/chem&gt;; in the latter two cases there are substantial [[systematic error|systematic uncertainties]]. Nonetheless, the general consistency with abundances predicted by Big Bang nucleosynthesis is strong evidence for the Big Bang, as the theory is the only known explanation for the relative abundances of light elements, and it is virtually impossible to "tune" the Big Bang to produce much more or less than 20–30% helium.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, there is no obvious reason outside of the Big Bang that, for example, the young universe (i.e., before star formation, as determined by studying matter supposedly free of [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] products) should have more helium than deuterium or more deuterium than &lt;chem&gt;^3He&lt;/chem&gt;, and in constant ratios, too.&lt;ref name="Ryden2003"/&gt;{{rp|182–185}}

===Galactic evolution and distribution===
{{Main|Galaxy formation and evolution|Structure formation}}
Detailed observations of the [[Galaxy morphological classification|morphology]] and [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|distribution]] of galaxies and [[quasars]] are in agreement with the current state of the Big Bang theory. A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the Big Bang, and since then, larger structures have been forming, such as [[galaxy clusters]] and [[supercluster]]s.&lt;ref name="Bertschinger"/&gt;

Populations of stars have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are observed as they were in the early universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently, appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of [[star formation]], galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.&lt;ref name="Bertschinger"&gt;

In 2011, astronomers found what they believe to be pristine clouds of primordial gas by analyzing absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. These two clouds of gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium.&lt;ref&gt;

===Other lines of evidence===
The age of the universe as estimated from the Hubble expansion and the [[cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] is now in good agreement with other estimates using the ages of the oldest stars, both as measured by applying the theory of [[stellar evolution]] to [[globular clusters]] and through [[radiometric dating]] of individual [[Population II]] stars.&lt;ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Problems}}Problems and related issues in physics==
{{See also|List of unsolved problems in physics}}
As with any theory, a number of mysteries and problems have arisen as a result of the development of the Big Bang theory. Some of these mysteries and problems have been resolved while others are still outstanding. Proposed solutions to some of the problems in the Big Bang model have revealed new mysteries of their own. For example, the [[horizon problem]], the [[magnetic monopole problem]], and the [[flatness problem]] are most commonly resolved with [[Cosmic inflation|inflationary theory]], but the details of the inflationary universe are still left unresolved and many, including some founders of the theory, say it has been disproven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Earman |first1=John |last2=Mosterín |first2=Jesús |date=March 1999 |title=A Critical Look at Inflationary Cosmology |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=1–49 |doi=10.1086/392675 |jstor=188736}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Baryon asymmetry===
{{Main|Baryon asymmetry}}
It is not yet understood why the universe has more matter than antimatter.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Kolb and Turner, chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally assumed that when the universe was young and very hot it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the [[Sakharov conditions]] must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that [[C-symmetry]] and [[CP-symmetry]] are violated and that the universe depart from [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].&lt;ref name="sakharov"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;(Translated in ''[[Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics Letters]]'' '''5''', 24 (1967).)
&lt;/ref&gt; All these conditions occur in the [[Standard Model]], but the effects are not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry.

===Dark energy===
{{Main|Dark energy}}
Measurements of the [[redshift]]–[[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] relation for [[type Ia supernova]]e indicate that the expansion of the universe has been [[accelerating universe|accelerating]] since the universe was about half its present age. To explain this acceleration, general relativity requires that much of the energy in the universe consists of a component with large [[equation of state (cosmology)|negative pressure]], dubbed "dark energy".&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt;

Dark energy, though speculative, solves numerous problems. Measurements of the [[cosmic microwave background]] indicate that the universe is very nearly spatially flat, and therefore according to general relativity the universe must have almost exactly the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]] of mass/energy. But the mass density of the universe can be measured from its gravitational clustering, and is found to have only about 30% of the critical density.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt; Since theory suggests that dark energy does not cluster in the usual way it is the best explanation for the "missing" energy density. Dark energy also helps to explain two geometrical measures of the overall curvature of the universe, one using the frequency of [[gravitational lens]]es, and the other using the characteristic pattern of the [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]] as a cosmic ruler.

Negative pressure is believed to be a property of [[vacuum energy]], but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos.&lt;ref name="wmap7year" /&gt; According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the [[far future]] as dark energy becomes even more dominant.

The dark energy component of the universe has been explained by theorists using a variety of competing theories including Einstein's [[cosmological constant]] but also extending to more exotic forms of [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] or other modified gravity schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mortonson |first1=Michael J. |last2=Weinberg |first2=David H.|last3=White |first3=Martin |title=Dark Energy: A Short Review |journal=Particle Data Group 2014 Review of Particle Physics |date=December 2013 |arxiv=1401.0046|bibcode = 2014arXiv1401.0046M }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mortonson |first1=Michael J. |last2=Weinberg |first2=David H.|last3=White |first3=Martin |title=Dark Energy: A Short Review |work=LEVEL 5 — A Knowledgebase for Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology, NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) |publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology |date=2014-06-27 |url=https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March14/Mortonson/Mortonson_contents.html |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cosmological constant problem]], sometimes called the "most embarrassing problem in physics", results from the apparent discrepancy between the measured energy density of dark energy, and the one naively predicted from [[Planck units]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rugh |first1=S.&amp;thinsp;E. |last2=Zinkernagel |first2=H. |title=The quantum vacuum and the cosmological constant problem |pages=663–705 |volume=33 |issue=4 |date=December 2002 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1355219802000333 |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B |doi=10.1016/S1355-2198(02)00033-3 |arxiv=hep-th/0012253|bibcode = 2002SHPMP..33..663R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark matter===
{{Main|Dark matter}}
[[File:Cosmological Composition – Pie Chart.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|[[pie chart|Chart]] shows the proportion of different components of the universe {{spaced ndash}} about 95% is [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]].]]
During the 1970s and the 1980s, various observations showed that there is not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal [[baryon]]ic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, [[galaxy cluster]] velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, [[gravitational lensing]] studies, and [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray measurements]] of galaxy clusters.&lt;ref&gt;

Indirect evidence for dark matter comes from its gravitational influence on other matter, as no dark matter particles have been observed in laboratories. Many [[particle physics]] candidates for dark matter have been proposed, and several projects to detect them directly are underway.&lt;ref name="pdg"&gt;

Additionally, there are outstanding problems associated with the currently favored [[cold dark matter]] model which include the [[dwarf galaxy problem]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bullock |first1=James |title=Notes on the Missing Satellites Problem |journal=XX Canary Islands Winter School of Astrophysics on Local Group Cosmology |arxiv=1009.4505|bibcode = 2010arXiv1009.4505B |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[cuspy halo problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Diemand |first1=Jürg |last2=Zemp |first2=Marcel |last3=Moore |first3=Ben |last4=Stadel |first4=Joachim |last5=Carollo |first5=C.

===Horizon problem===
The [[horizon problem]] results from the premise that information cannot travel [[faster than light]]. In a universe of finite age this sets a limit—the [[particle horizon]]—on the separation of any two regions of space that are in [[causality (physics)|causal]] contact.&lt;ref name="kolb_c8"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt; The observed isotropy of the [[Cosmic microwave background|CMB]] is problematic in this regard: if the universe had been dominated by radiation or matter at all times up to the epoch of last scattering, the particle horizon at that time would correspond to about 2 degrees on the sky. There would then be no mechanism to cause wider regions to have the same temperature.&lt;ref name="Ryden2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Sue Ryden|title=Introduction to cosmology|year=2003|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0-8053-8912-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|191–202}}

A resolution to this apparent inconsistency is offered by [[inflationary theory]] in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently on opposite sides of the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.&lt;ref name="guth"/&gt;{{rp|180–186}}

[[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]] predicts that during the inflationary phase there would be [[primordial fluctuations|quantum thermal fluctuations]], which would be magnified to cosmic scale. These fluctuations serve as the seeds of all current structure in the universe.&lt;ref name="Ryden2003"/&gt;{{rp|207}} Inflation predicts that the [[primordial fluctuations]] are nearly [[Scale invariance|scale invariant]] and [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]], which has been accurately confirmed by measurements of the CMB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spergel |first=D. N. |display-authors=etal |title=Three-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Implications for Cosmology |pages=377–408 |format=PDF |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series |volume=170 |issue=2 |year=2007 |url=

If inflation occurred, exponential expansion would push large regions of space well beyond our observable horizon.&lt;ref name="guth"/&gt;{{rp|180–186}}

A related issue to the classic horizon problem arises because in most standard cosmological inflation models, inflation ceases well before [[electroweak symmetry breaking]] occurs, so inflation should not be able to prevent large-scale discontinuities in the [[electroweak vacuum]] since distant parts of the observable universe were causally separate when the [[electroweak epoch]] ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R. Penrose|title=The Road to Reality|publisher=Vintage books|year=2007|isbn=978-0-679-77631-4|title-link=The Road to Reality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetic monopoles===
The [[magnetic monopole]] objection was raised in the late 1970s. [[Grand unified theory|Grand unified theories]] predicted [[topological defect]]s in space that would manifest as [[magnetic monopole]]s. These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that no monopoles have been found. This problem is also resolved by [[cosmic inflation]], which removes all point defects from the observable universe, in the same way that it drives the geometry to flatness.&lt;ref name="kolb_c8"/&gt;

===Flatness problem===
[[File:End of universe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The overall [[Shape of the universe|geometry of the universe]] is determined by whether the [[Density parameter|Omega cosmological parameter]] is less than, equal to or greater than 1. Shown from top to bottom are a [[Shape of the universe#Spherical universe|closed universe]] with positive curvature, a [[Shape of the universe#Hyperbolic universe|hyperbolic universe]] with negative curvature and a [[flat universe]] with zero curvature.]]

The [[flatness problem]] (also known as the oldness problem) is an observational problem associated with a [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] (FLRW).&lt;ref name="kolb_c8"/&gt; The universe may have positive, negative, or zero spatial [[curvature]] depending on its total energy density. Curvature is negative if its density is less than the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]]; positive if greater; and zero at the critical density, in which case space is said to be ''flat''.

The problem is that any small departure from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat.&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;Strictly, dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant drives the universe towards a flat state; however, our universe remained close to flat for several billion years before the dark energy density became significant.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the [[Planck time]], 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds,&lt;ref name=HTUW/&gt; the fact that the universe has reached neither a [[heat death of the universe|heat death]] nor a [[Big Crunch]] after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.&lt;ref&gt;

== Cause ==
{{Main|Problem of why there is anything at all}}
Physics may conclude that [[time]] did not exist before 'Big Bang', but 'started' with the &lt;!--beginning point--&gt;Big Bang and hence there might be no 'beginning', 'before' or potentially 'cause' and instead always existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Big Bang?

== Ultimate fate of the universe ==
{{Main|Ultimate fate of the universe}}

Before observations of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios for the future of the universe. If the mass [[density]] of the universe were greater than the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]], then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started—a Big Crunch.&lt;ref name="kolb_c3"/&gt;

Alternatively, if the density in the universe were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out, leaving [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s, and [[black hole]]s. Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the universe would asymptotically approach [[absolute zero]]—a [[Big Freeze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Griswold |first=Britt |title=What is the Ultimate Fate of the Universe? |work=Universe 101 Big Bang Theory |publisher=NASA |date=2012 |url=
http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_fate.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, if the proton were [[proton decay|unstable]], then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting [[Hawking radiation]]. The [[entropy]] of the universe would increase to the point where no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as heat death.&lt;ref name=dying&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adams |first1=Fred C. |last2=Laughlin |first2=Gregory |lastauthoramp=yes |title=A dying Universe: the long-term fate and evolution of astrophysical objects |pages=337–372 |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=69 |issue=2 |date=1997 |bibcode=1997RvMP...69..337A |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.69.337| arxiv=astro-ph/9701131}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|sec VI.D}}

Modern observations of accelerating expansion imply that more and more of the currently visible universe will pass beyond our [[event horizon]] and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The ΛCDM model of the universe contains dark energy in the form of a [[cosmological constant]]. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy, called [[phantom energy]] theories, suggest that ultimately galaxy clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, and matter itself will be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called [[Big Rip]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Misconceptions ==
The following is a partial list of misconceptions about the Big Bang model:

''The Big Bang as the origin of the universe:'' One of the common misconceptions about the Big Bang model is the belief that it was the origin of the universe. However, the Big Bang model does not comment about how the universe came into being. Current conception of the Big Bang model assumes the existence of energy, time, and space, and does not comment about their origin or the cause of the dense and high temperature initial state of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/seuforum/faq.htm|title=Brief Answers to Cosmic Questions|website=www.cfa.harvard.edu|access-date=2017-07-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413195349/https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/seuforum/faq.htm|archivedate=13 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Big Bang was "small"'': It is misleading to visualize the Big Bang by comparing its size to everyday objects. When the size of the universe at Big Bang is described, it refers to the size of the observable universe, and not the entire universe.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Tamara M.|last2=Lineweaver|first2=Charles H.|date=January 2004|title=Expanding Confusion: Common Misconceptions of Cosmological Horizons and the Superluminal Expansion of the Universe|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/expanding-confusion-common-misconceptions-of-cosmological-horizons-and-the-superluminal-expansion-of-the-universe/EFEEEFD8D71E59F86DDA82FDF576EFD3|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia|volume=21|issue=1|pages=97–109|doi=10.1071/as03040|arxiv = astro-ph/0310808 |bibcode = 2004PASA...21...97D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Hubble's law]] violates the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]]'': Hubble's law predicts that galaxies that are beyond [[Hubble's law|Hubble Distance]] recede [[Faster-than-light|faster than the speed of light]]. However, special relativity does not apply beyond motion through space. Hubble's law describes velocity that results from expansion ''of'' space, rather than ''through'' space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''[[Doppler effect|Doppler redshift]] vs [[Cosmological redshift|cosmological red-shift]]'': Astronomers&amp;nbsp;often refer to the cosmological red-shift as a normal Doppler shift,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;which is a misconception. Although similar, the cosmological red-shift is not identical to the Doppler redshift. The Doppler redshift is based on special relativity, which does not consider the expansion of space. On the contrary, the cosmological red-shift is based on general relativity, in which the expansion of space is considered. Although they may appear identical for nearby galaxies, it may cause confusion if the behavior of distant galaxies is understood through the Doppler redshift.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Speculations ==
{{Main|Cosmogony}}

While the Big Bang model is well established in cosmology, it is likely to be refined. The Big Bang theory, built upon the equations of classical general relativity, indicates a [[essential singularity|singularity]] at the origin of cosmic time; this [[infinity#Physics|infinite]] [[energy density]] is regarded as impossible in [[experimental physics|physics]].  Still, it is known that the equations are not applicable before the time when the universe cooled down to the [[Planck temperature]], and this conclusion depends on various assumptions, of which some could never be experimentally verified. ''(Also see [[Planck epoch]].)''

One proposed refinement to avoid this would-be singularity is to develop a correct treatment of [[quantum gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;

It is not known what could have preceded the hot dense state of the early universe or how and why it originated, though speculation abounds in the field of [[cosmogony]].

Some proposals, each of which entails untested hypotheses, are:
* Models including the [[Hartle–Hawking state|Hartle–Hawking no-boundary condition]], in which the whole of space-time is finite; the Big Bang does represent the limit of time but without any singularity.&lt;ref&gt;

* Big Bang lattice model, states that the universe at the moment of the Big Bang consists of an infinite lattice of [[fermions]], which is smeared over the [[fundamental domain]] so it has rotational, translational and gauge symmetry. The symmetry is the largest symmetry possible and hence the lowest entropy of any state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* [[Brane cosmology]] models, in which inflation is due to the movement of branes in [[string theory]]; the pre-Big Bang model; the [[ekpyrotic]] model, in which the Big Bang is the result of a collision between branes; and the [[cyclic model]], a variant of the ekpyrotic model in which collisions occur periodically. In the latter model the Big Bang was preceded by a Big Crunch and the universe cycles from one process to the other.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Carl Jakob Sundevall''' (22 October 1801, [[Högestad]] – 2 February 1875) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[zoologist]].
Sundevall studied at [[Lund University]], where he became a Ph.D. in 1823. After traveling to East Asia, he studied medicine, graduating as Doctor of Medicine in 1830.

He was employed at the [[Swedish Museum of Natural History]], [[Stockholm]] from 1833, and was professor and keeper of the [[vertebrate]] section from 1839 to 1871. He wrote ''Svenska Foglarna'' (1856–87) which described 238 species of birds observed in Sweden. He classified a number of birds collected in southern Africa by [[Johan August Wahlberg]]. In 1835, he developed a [[phylogeny]] for the birds based on the muscles of the hip and leg that contributed to later work by [[Thomas Huxley]].  He then went on to examine the arrangement of the deep [[plantar]] [[tendon]]s in the bird's foot. This latter information is still used by avian taxonomists. Sundevall was also an [[entomologist]] and [[arachnologist]] and in 1862 wrote a monograph proposing a universal [[Phonetic transcription|phonetic alphabet]], ''Om phonetiska bokstäver''.

==Legacy==
Sundevall is commemorated in the scientific names of four species of reptiles: ''[[Elapsoidea|Elapsoidea sundevalli]], [[Leptotyphlops sundewalli]], [[Mochlus|Mochlus sundevalli]]'', and ''[[Prosymna|Prosymna sundevalli]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). ''The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. {{ISBN|978-1-4214-0135-5}}. ("Sundevall", p. 258).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charity Engine''' is a free PC app based on Berkeley University's [[BOINC]] software, ran by The Worldwide Computer Company Limited. The project works by selling spare home computing power to universities and corporations, then sharing the profits between eight partner charities and periodic cash [[sweepstakes|prize draws]] for the users; those running the Charity Engine BOINC software on their home computers. When there are no corporations purchasing the computing power, Charity Engine donates it to existing [[volunteer computing]] projects such as [[Rosetta@home]], [[Einstein@Home]] and [[Malaria Control Project|Malaria Control]] and prize draws are funded by donations.&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;{{cite web

'''Chemical stability''' when used in the technical sense in [[chemistry]], means '''thermodynamic stability''' of a chemical system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/S05900.html Definition of Stable in IUPAC Gold Book]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermodynamic stability occurs when a system is in its lowest energy state, or [[chemical equilibrium]] with its environment.  This may be a [[dynamic equilibrium]], where individual atoms or molecules change form, but their overall number in a particular form is conserved.  This type of chemical thermodynamic equilibrium will persist indefinitely unless the system is changed.  Chemical  systems might include changes in the [[phase of matter]] or a set of [[chemical reaction]]s.

State A is said to be more thermodynamically stable than state B if the [[Gibbs energy]] of the change from A to B is positive.

==Versus reactivity==

Thermodynamic stability applies to a particular system. The [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] of a chemical substance is a description of how it might react across a variety of potential chemical systems and, for a given system, how fast such a reaction could proceed.

Chemical substances or states can persist indefinitely even though they are not in their lowest energy state if they experience [[metastability]] - a state which is stable only if not disturbed too much.  A substance (or state) might also be termed "kinetically persistent" if it is changing relatively slowly (and thus is not at thermodynamic equilibrium, but is observed anyway). Metastable and kinetically persistent species or systems are not considered truly stable in chemistry.  Therefore, the term ''chemically stable'' should not be used by chemists as a synonym of ''unreactive'' because it confuses thermodynamic and kinetic concepts. On the other hand, highly chemically unstable species tend to undergo exothermic unimolar decompositions at high rates. Thus, high chemical instability may sometimes parallel unimolar decompositions at high rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/U06569.html Definitions of Unstable in IUPAC Gold Book]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside chemistry==

In everyday language, and often in [[materials science]], a chemical substance is said to be "stable" if it is not particularly [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] in the environment or during normal use, and retains its useful properties on the timescale of its expected usefulness. In particular, the usefulness is retained in the presence of air, moisture or heat, and under the expected conditions of application. In this meaning, the material is said to be unstable if it can corrode, decompose, polymerize, burn or explode under the conditions of anticipated use or normal environmental conditions.

'''Content sniffing''', also known as '''media type sniffing''' or '''MIME sniffing''', is the practice of inspecting the content of a [[byte stream]] to attempt to deduce the [[file format]] of the data within it. Content sniffing is generally used to compensate for a lack of accurate [[metadata]] that would otherwise be required to enable the file to be interpreted correctly. Content sniffing techniques tend to use a mixture of techniques that rely on the [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] found in most file formats: looking for [[file format#Magic number|file signature]]s and [[magic number (programming)|magic number]]s, and [[heuristic]]s including searching for well-known representative substrings, the use of [[letter frequency|byte frequency]] and [[n-gram|''n''-gram]] tables, and [[Bayesian inference]].

MIME sniffing was, and still is, used by some [[web browser]]s, including notably [[Microsoft]]'s [[Internet Explorer]], in an attempt to help web sites which do not correctly signal the [[MIME type]] of web content display correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms775147.aspx|title=MIME Type Detection in Windows Internet Explorer|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, doing this opens up a serious [[security vulnerability]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.adambarth.com/papers/2009/barth-caballero-song.pdf|title = Secure Content Sniffing for Web Browsers, or How to Stop Papers from Reviewing Themselves|last = Barth|first = Adam|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which, by confusing the MIME sniffing algorithm, the browser can be manipulated into interpreting data in a way that allows an attacker to carry out operations that are not expected by either the site operator or user, such as [[cross-site scripting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-online.com/security/features/Risky-MIME-sniffing-in-Internet-Explorer-746229.html|title=Risky sniffing: MIME sniffing in Internet Explorer enables cross-site scripting attacks|author=Henry Sudhof|publisher=The H|date=11 February 2009|accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, by making sites which do not correctly assign MIME types to content appear to work correctly in those browsers, it fails to encourage the correct labeling of material, which in turn makes content sniffing necessary for these sites to work, creating a vicious circle of incompatibility with web standards and security best practices.

A specification exists for media type sniffing in [[HTML5]], which attempts to balance the requirements of security with the need for reverse compatibility with web content with missing or incorrect MIME-type data. It attempts to provide a precise specification that can be used across implementations to implement a single well-defined and deterministic set of behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/|title=Mime Sniffing|author=Adam Barth, Ian Hickson|publisher=WHATWG|accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNIX [[file (command)|&lt;tt&gt;file&lt;/tt&gt; command]] can be viewed as a content sniffing application.

== Charset sniffing ==

{{see also|Charset detection}}
Numerous web browsers use a more limited form of content sniffing to attempt to determine the [[character encoding]] of text files for which the MIME type is already known. This technique is known as charset sniffing or [[codepage]] sniffing and, for certain encodings, may be used to bypass security restrictions too. For instance, [[Internet Explorer 7]] may be tricked to run [[JScript]] in circumvention of its policy by allowing the browser to guess that an [[HTML]]-file was encoded in [[UTF-7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd565635%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
|title=Event 1058 - Codepage Sniffing
|work=Internet Explorer
|publisher=[[MSDN]]
|accessdate=2012-07-14
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This bug is worsened by the feature of the UTF-7 encoding which permits multiple encodings of the same text and, specifically, alternative representations of [[ASCII]] characters.

Most encodings do not allow evasive presentations of ASCII characters, so charset sniffing is less dangerous in general because, due to the historical accident of the ASCII-centric nature of scripting and markup languages, characters outside the ASCII repertoire are more difficult to use to circumvent security boundaries, and mis-interpretations of character sets tend to produce results no worse than the display of [[mojibake]].

His interests beyond research included the development of effective teaching methods and African development; he taught regularly at the [[African Institute for Mathematical Sciences]] in [[Cape Town]] from its foundation in 2003 to 2006. In 2008 he completed a book on energy consumption and energy production without [[fossil fuel]]s called  ''Sustainable Energy – Without the Hot Air''. MacKay used £10,000 of his own money to publish the book, and the initial print run of 5,000 sold within days.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |title=Power to the People |author=[[Leo Hickman]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/30/david-mckay-sustainable-energy |newspaper=The Guardian |date=30 April 2009 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book received praise from ''[[The Economist]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Meltdown |author= |url=http://www.economist.com/node/13437900?story_id=13437900 |newspaper=The Economist |date=8 April 2009|accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt; and [[Bill Gates]], who called it "one of the best books on energy that has been written."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegatesnotes.com/Learning/article.aspx?ID=61|title=Clear Thinking on the Topic of Energy|author=Bill Gates|work=The Gates Notes|publisher=|date=15 January 2010|accessdate=14 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105153412/http://www.thegatesnotes.com/(S(5osgmx55hyed2r55b5ytzr45))/Learning/Article.aspx?ID=61|archivedate=5 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRQB2YXUxvY |title=YouTube – How Many Light Bulbs? with David MacKay From Cambridge Ideas |work= |accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like his textbook on Information theory, MacKay made the book available for free online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.withouthotair.com/ | title=Sustainable energy - Without the Hot Air | publisher=David MacKay FRS | date=August 29, 2015 | accessdate=July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012 he gave a [[TED talk]] on [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref name="tedtalk"&gt;{{cite video |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/david_mackay_a_reality_check_on_renewables.html |author=David MacKay |title=A reality check on renewables |date=March 2012 |accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Books demonicmales large.jpg|Thumb|right|150px|Demonic Males Apes and the Origins of Human Violence]]

==Summary==
''Demonic Males'' begins by explaining that humans, [[chimpanzee]]s, [[bonobo]]s, [[gorilla]]s and [[orangutan]]s are a group of genetically related [[Hominidae|Great Apes]], that humans are genetically closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas, and that chimps and bonobos are most closely genetically related. After speculating about what enabled humans' ancestors to leave the rainforest (the use of roots as sources of water and food), ''Demonic Males'' next provides a catalog of the types of violence practiced by male chimpanzees (intra-group hierarchical violence, violence against females and extra-group murdering raids). The high incidence of rape by non-alpha male orangutans and infanticide by male gorillas are also cited as examples of our mutual genetic heritage.

The authors present chimp society as extremely patriarchal, in that no adult male chimpanzee is subordinate to any female of any rank. They present evidence that most dominant human civilizations have always been likewise behaviorally patriarchal, and that male humans share male chimpanzees' innate propensity for dominance, gratuitous violence, war, rape and murder. They claim that the brain's [[prefrontal cortex]] is also a factor, as humans have been shown experimentally to make decisions based both on logic and prefrontal cortex-mediated emotion.

In the chapter "The Peaceful Ape," the authors contrast chimpanzee behaviors with those of the bonobo, presenting logical biological reasons for the more pacific (although also aggressive and antagonistic) behaviors of the latter.&lt;ref name="ridley" /&gt; Reasons include a bonobo female social organization that doesn't tolerate male aggression, the invisibility of bonobo ovulation (in chimps, ovulation has both olfactory and genital swelling manifestations, leading to ferocious male competition for mating), and overall social organization, whereby male bonobos don't form alliances as male chimps do. (Contested: Heisterman et al (1996) show that female bonobos display sexual swellings which they considered to be a reliable indicator of probability of ovulation).

The authors consider male violence to be evolutionarily undesirable and morally reprehensible (explicitly detailing the [[Hutu]]-[[Tutsi]] cross-genocides in Africa's Great Ape habitats, and citing [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]'s female utopian novel ''[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]'' [1915]), and argue that the advent of modern weapons such as nerve gas and atomic bombs threaten our collective future. Like [[Steven Pinker]]'s ''[[The Better Angels of Our Nature|The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined]]'' (2012), which makes the case that violence has been decreasing in human society over time, ''Demonic Males'' makes the case that human males are genetically predisposed to violence, but that our species also has the intellectual capacity to override this flaw if we recognize that it is in our survival interest to do so.

==Reviews==
In a political interpretation of ''Demonic Males,'' biologist Philip Regal says that the book is partly an attack on the deconstructivist feminist theory that male violence is a purely [[social construct]]. Regal also considers the book to be "a broadside against the old utopian dreams of Atlantis, Eden, Elysium, a Golden Age, Romantic paintings, and the late Margaret Mead" which imagined human beings as naturally peaceful.&lt;ref name="regal"/&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' called it "enjoyable and easy to read" and said it "belongs to the emerging genre of serious scientific books that have something to say about questions of interest to many people, not just to specialists".&lt;ref name="ridley" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7368">The '''Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology''' (1992–2006) was a research institute established at [[MIT]], and housed in a renovated building (E56) on campus at 38 [[Memorial Drive (Cambridge)|Memorial Drive]], overlooking the [[Charles River]].&lt;ref name="MIT_news"&gt;Charles H. Ball, [http://www.mit.edu/newsoffice/1992/dibner-0923.html MIT to House New Dibner Institute], ''[[MIT Tech Talk]]'', September 23, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DibnerDedication&gt;{{cite web|title=Dibner Dedication Is Thursday|url=http://www.mit.edu/newsoffice/1992/dibner-1021.html|work=MIT Tech Talk|publisher=MIT News Office|accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roland2005"&gt;Alex Roland (April 2006), [http://130.102.44.247/journals/technology_and_culture/v047/47.2roland.pdf David Dibner, 1927–2005], ''[[Technology and Culture]]'', '''47'''(2) 472–475&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
At the heart of the Institute was the [[Burndy Library]] on the ground floor, initially containing 37,000 volumes on the [[history of science and technology]]  collected by the Dibner Fund.  The Library also possessed a large collection of antique scientific instruments, such as [[astrolabe]]s, [[telescope]]s, [[microscope]]s, early [[spectrometer]]s, and a [[Wimshurst machine]], which were on public display in a dedicated gallery outside the library.  Also on display was a large collection of antique [[incandescent light]] bulbs, [[gas discharge tube]]s, electronic [[vacuum tube]]s, and other early examples of electrical and electronic technology.  The Library would mount occasional special exhibits, such as ''The Afterlife of Immortality: Obelisks Outside Egypt''.&lt;ref name=Obelisks&gt;{{cite web|title=Burndy Library exhibit examines obelisks over the centuries|url=http://www.mit.edu/newsoffice/2000/obelisk-0315.html|work=MIT Tech Talk|publisher=MIT News Office|accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Above the Library and display space, on the second and third floor were offices and lecture and seminar rooms.  The Institute held regular lectures, seminars, study programs, and an annual symposium in the history of science and technology.  Over the period of its existence, the Institute supported over 340 short- and longer-term fellowships.&lt;ref name="Roland2005" /&gt;

== History and development == 
The Institute was named in honor of [[Bern Dibner]] (1897–1988), who had conceived of it before his death. The Institute was developed and supported by the Dibner Fund he had established in 1957, directed by his son [[David Dibner]].&lt;ref name="Roland2005" /&gt;The institute, from its inception was run by executive director, Evelyn Simha. On the academic side, the Institute was supported by a consortium of MIT, [[Boston University]], [[Brandeis University]] and [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="MIT_news" /&gt;

In 1995, the 600-volume Babson Collection of historical material related to [[Isaac Newton]] was placed on permanent deposit with the Burndy Library.  The collection had been assembled by [[Roger Babson]], founder of [[Babson College]] in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]], and was previously housed at the College.&lt;ref name=Babson&gt;{{cite web|title=Babson collection of Newtonia to be housed at Burndy Library|url=http://www.mit.edu/newsoffice/1995/babson-0301.html|work=MIT Tech Talk|publisher=MIT News Office|accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the addition of the 7,000-volume Volterra Collection from Italy increased the Burndy Library collection by more than a third.&lt;ref name=DibnerVolterra&gt;{{cite web|last=Weiss|first=Benjamin|title=Library marks major acquisition|url=http://www.mit.edu/newsoffice/1999/dibner-1208.html|work=MIT Tech Talk|publisher=MIT News Office|accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2004 MIT decided not to renew its affiliation, and the Dibner family began looking for a new location to house the collection.  David Dibner died unexpectedly in 2005.&lt;ref name=DibnerObit&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Sarah|title=David Dibner, philanthropist, dies at 78|url=http://www.mit.edu/newsoffice/2005/obit-dibner.html|work=MIT Tech Talk|publisher=MIT News Office|accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Dibner Institute closed in 2006,&lt;ref name="Roland2005" /&gt; and the Burndy Library and associated collections were transferred to [[The Huntington Library]] in [[San Marino, California|San Marino]], [[California]], which now offers a Dibner History of Science Program to fund fellowships, a lecture series and annual conference.&lt;ref name=BurndyLibrary_Huntington&gt;[http://huntington.org/huntingtonlibrary.aspx?id=568 Institutes at The Huntington Library]&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition of the Burndy Library (by then numbering 67,000 volumes) transformed the Huntington Library's collections in the history of science and technology into one of the world's largest in that field.&lt;ref name=Huntington&gt;{{cite web|title=The Huntington's History of Science Collections|url=http://huntington.org/uploadedFiles/Files/PDFs/pr_dibner_collections.pdf|work=Huntington Library [website]|publisher=The Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens|accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Huntington houses a permanent exhibition, ''Beautiful Science: Ideas that Changed the World'', in the {{convert|2800|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Dibner Hall of the History of Science that displays approximately 150 books, manuscripts, photographs and objects from both the Burndy Library and the Huntington's non-Burndy holdings in the history of science and medicine.&lt;ref name=BeautifulScience&gt;{{cite web|title=Beautiful Science: Ideas that Changed the World|url=http://huntington.org/uploadedFiles/Files/PDFs/pr_dibner_highlights.pdf|work=Huntington Library [website]|publisher=The Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens|accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Approximately 200 antique light bulbs from the Burndy Collection are on display in the ''Beautiful Science'' exhibition. The light bulbs are not available for reference or research use, except by special arrangement. The status and accessibility of the Burndy collection of [[gas tube]]s, [[vacuum tubes]], and [[electronic components|electronic artifacts]] is not clear from the Huntington website.

The Dibner Institute's former building was demolished in early 2007 to make way for new buildings for the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mit.edu/newsoffice/2006/dibner-trees-1220.html New home for Dibner trees], ''[[MIT Tech Talk]]'', December 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Dibner name remains at MIT, in the endowed Frances and David Dibner Professorship of the History of Engineering and Manufacturing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3686">An '''early adopter''' (sometimes misspelled as ''early adapter'' or ''early adaptor'') or '''lighthouse customer''' is an early customer of a given company, product, or technology. The term originates from [[Everett M. Rogers]]' ''[[Diffusion of Innovations]]'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==History==
Typically this will be a customer who, in addition to using the vendor's product or technology, will also provide considerable and candid feedback to help the vendor refine its future product releases, as well as the associated means of distribution, service, and support.  

[[File:DiffusionOfInnovation.png|thumb|Early adopters as shown in the [[Technology adoption lifecycle|Rogers' bell curve]]|384x237px]]

The relationship is [[synergy|synergistic]], with the customer having early (and sometimes unique, or at least uniquely early) access to an advantageous new product or technology, but he or she also serves as a kind of [[Human subject research|guinea pig]].

In exchange for being an early adopter, and thus being exposed to the problems, risks, and annoyances common to early-stage product testing and deployment, the lighthouse customer is sometimes given especially attentive vendor assistance and support, even to the point of having personnel at the customer's work site to assist with implementation.
The customer is sometimes given preferential pricing, terms, and conditions, although new technology is often very expensive, so the early adopter still often pays quite a lot.

The vendor, on the other hand, benefits from receiving early
revenues, and also from a lighthouse customer's endorsement and assistance in further developing the product and its go-to-market mechanisms. Acquiring lighthouse customers is a common step in new product development and implementation. The real-world focus that this type  of relationship can bring to a vendor can be extremely valuable.

Early adoption does come with pitfalls: early versions of products may be buggy and/or prone to malfunction.  Furthermore, more efficient, and sometimes less expensive, versions of the product usually appear a few months after the initial release ([[Apple iPhone]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.aol.com/top5/general/gadgets AOL Money]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13508_3-9790142-19.html Making sense of the million-dollar iPhone lawsuit]&lt;/ref&gt;  The trend of new technology costing more at release is often referred to as the "early adopter tax".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501465_162-3251293-501465.html | title=The Early Adopter's Gamble}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6390">'''Energo-Chromo-Kinese''', also named '''ECK''', is a [[pseudo-scientific]] and [[esoteric]]-oriented [[new religious movement]] founded in October 1987 in [[Villefranche-sur-Mer]] by '''Patrick Véret''',&lt;ref&gt;Renaud Marhic, Alain Kerlidou, ''Sectes &amp; mouvements initiatiques en Bretagne: (du celtisme au nouvel âge)'', 1996, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; a former [[acupuncturist]] and [[homeopath]], and his wife '''Danielle Drouant, now Danielle Didier'''.

==History and organization==
ECK uses many associations and societies (including Connaissance ontologique universelle et recherche biologique énergétique (COURBE), Energo 8 international, Energo conseils, Jéricho 3000, Association pour la recherche en médecine énergétique and SOS Spasmophilie) and is particularly active in the [[therapeutic]] and [[medical]] fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jean-Marie |last=Abgrall |authorlink=Jean-Marie Abgrall |title=Soul snatchers: the mechanics of cults |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QoFJIJr57b8C&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=energo+chromo+kin%C3%A8se&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |year=1999 |pages=38, 39 |accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Centers and schools were subsequently established to teach the beliefs of the group, which won over business executives and major corporations, but especially doctors, dentists and [[kinesiotherapist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Marie Abgrall, ''La mécanique des sectes'', 2002, p.50&lt;/ref&gt; Customers who attend these four-degree courses become "kinergists". The doctrine is a "[[gnostic]] [[pantheism]]" and is explained in two books written by Patrick Véret: ''La Médecine énergétique'' and ''La spasmophilie enfin vaincue'', respectively written in 1981 and 1985.&lt;ref name="Ref1"&gt;{{cite web |author=Centre Roger Ikor |title=Energo Chromo Kinese (Ordre nouveau des Templiers opératifs — ECK) |url=http://pagesperso-orange.fr/sos.derivesectaire/FICHES/energo_chromo_kinese.htm |work=Les sectes - Etat d'urgence |publisher=SOS Dérive sectaire |language=French |year=1995 |accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to French cult consultant [[Jean-Marie Abgrall]], ECK doctrines "represent an amalgam (or a synthesis, according to its proponents) of various theories referring to human "energy" — mainly Chinese medicine and Vedic medicine. According to ECK, the human body has seven energy centers that vibrate on the same frequencies as certain colors or certain sounds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Healing or stealing?: medical charlatans in the new age |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kel6_1aN5JwC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;dq=energo+chromo+kinese&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=11#v=onepage&amp;q=energo&amp;f=false |last=Abgrall |first=Jean-Marie |year=2000 |language=French |pages=182–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 February 1993, the French branch of the organization was dissolved by a court decision of the [[Tribunal de commerce]] of Paris and the founders split off. '''Véret''' founded the Nutrition énergétique des organes et des méridiens (NEOM), and his former wife '''Danielle Drouant''' led the Ordre du temple de la Jérusalem céleste (OTJC).&lt;ref name="Ref1"/&gt;

==Reception==
ECK was listed as a [[cult]] in the [[List of groups referred to as cults or sects in government documents|1999 parliamentary report]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rapport fait au nom de la Commission d'enquête sur les sectes - ''Les sectes et l'argent'' |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/dossiers/sectes/r1687anx.asp |publisher=''Assemblée Nationale'' |language=French |year=1999 |accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; established by the [[Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France]] and also appeared in the 1997 Belgian parliamentary report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commission d’enquête parlementaire belge sur les pratiques illégales des sectes - Eléments d’information fournis lors des auditions à huis-clos : Energo-chromo-kinèse (ECK) ou Energo 8 international |url=http://www.voltairenet.org/article3212.html |publisher=''Voltaire.net'' |language=French |date=28 March 1997 |accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was considered as dangerous because of its pseudo-medical speech which could be harmful to members' health, exaggerated requests for money, and indoctrination of the members who became dependent to the group. It was also criticized by anti-cult groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Energo-Chromo-Kinese, ECK  |url=http://www.info-sectes.ch/index-eck.htm |publisher=Info-sectes |language=French |accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Energo Chromo Kinese et aussi OTCJ (Temple de la Jérusalem Celeste et SARL NEOM |url=http://www.prevensectes.com/eck.htm |publisher=Prevensectes |language=French |accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and former members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sectes: en sortir, disent-ils |url=http://www.esj-lille.fr/atelier/magan2/teo/explorer/secte.html |publisher=École supérieure de journalisme de Lille |language=French |accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology |methods}}

'''Ethnography''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἔθνος}} ''ethnos'' "folk, people, nation" and {{lang|grc|γράφω}} ''grapho'' "I write") is the systematic study of people and cultures. It is designed to explore [[cultural]] phenomena where the researcher observes society from the point of view of the subject of the study.  An ethnography is a means to represent graphically and in writing the culture of a [[ethnic group|group]].  The word can thus be said to have a double meaning, which partly depends on whether it is used as a [[count noun]] or uncountable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanethnography.com/ethnography.php "Technical definition of ethnography"], ''American Ethnography''&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting field study or a case report reflects the knowledge and the system of meanings in the lives of a cultural group.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, C. (1973). [[Thick description]]: Toward an Interpretive Theory of Culture.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Interpretation of Cultures: Selected Essays'' (pp. 3-30). New York: Basic Books, Inc., Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philipsen, G. (1992). ''Speaking Culturally: Explorations in Social Communication.'' Albany, New York: State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a method of data collection ethnography entails examining the behaviour of the participants in a certain specific social situation and also understanding their interpretation of such behaviour.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;(Dewan M. (2018) Understanding Ethnography: An ‘Exotic’ Ethnographer’s Perspective. In: Mura P., Khoo-Lattimore C. (eds) Asian Qualitative Research in Tourism. Perspectives on Asian Tourism. Springer, Singapore)&lt;/ref&gt; Dewan (2018) further elaborates that this behaviour may be shaped by the constraints the participants feel because of the situations they are in or by the society in which they belong. Ethnography, as the presentation of [[empirical]] data on human [[Society|societies]] and [[culture]]s, was pioneered in the biological, social, and cultural branches of [[anthropology]], but it has also become popular in the [[social sciences]] in general—[[sociology]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ethnology "Ethnology" at ''dictionary.com''].&lt;/ref&gt; communication studies, history—wherever people study ethnic groups, formations, compositions, resettlements, social welfare characteristics, materiality, spirituality, and a people's [[ethnogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Токарев |first=Сергей Александрович |coauthors= |script-title=ru:История зарубежной этнографии |publisher=Наука |year=1978 |url=http://historia-site.narod.ru/library/ethnology/tokarev_main.htm |isbn= |language=Russian |title=Archived copy |access-date=2003-05-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030519225912/http://historia-site.narod.ru/library/ethnology/tokarev_main.htm |archive-date=2003-05-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical ethnography is a [[holistic]] study&lt;ref name="Ember 2006"&gt;Ember, Carol and Melvin Ember, ''Cultural Anthropology'' (Prentice Hall, 2006), chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heider, Karl 2001"&gt;Heider, Karl. ''Seeing Anthropology''. 2001. Prentice Hall, Chapters One and Two.&lt;/ref&gt; and so includes a brief history, and an analysis of the [[Physical geography|terrain]], the [[climate]], and the [[habitat]].  In all cases, it should be reflexive, make a substantial contribution toward the understanding of the social life of humans, have an aesthetic impact on the reader, and express a credible reality. An ethnography records all observed behavior and describes all symbol-meaning relations, using concepts that avoid causal explanations. Traditionally, ethnography was focussed on the western gaze towards the far 'exotic' east, but now researchers are undertaking ethnography in their own social environment. According to Dewan (2018), even if we are the other, the ‘another’ or the ‘native’, we are still ‘another’ because there are many facades of ourselves that connect us to people and other facades that highlight our differences. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==History and meaning==
[[File:Sahagun.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Bernardino de Sahagún]] is known as the first modern ethnographer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/43462|title=Bernardino de Sahagun: First Anthropologist (review)|first=Louise M.|last=Burkhart|date=10 June 2003|publisher=|journal=The Catholic Historical Review|volume=89|issue=2|pages=351–352|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.1353/cat.2003.0100}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{refimprove section|date=April 2015}}
The word 'ethnography' is derived from the Greek ἔθνος (''ethnos''), meaning "a company, later a people, nation" and [[-graphy]], meaning "writing". Ethnographic studies focus on large cultural groups of people who interact over time. Ethnography is a set of qualitative methods that are used in social sciences that focus on the observation of social practices and interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.erialproject.org/for-librarians/what-is-ethnography|title=What is Ethnography? « ERIAL Project|website=www.erialproject.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its aim is to observe a situation without imposing any deductive structure or framework upon it and to view everything as strange or unique.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Preece, J., Sharp, H., &amp; Rogers, Y. (2015). Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction (4th edition). Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of anthropology originated from Europe and England designed in late 19th century. It spread its roots to the United States at the beginning of the 20th century. Some of the main contributors like [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.&amp;nbsp;B. Tylor]] (1832–1917) from Britain and [[Lewis H. Morgan]] (1818–1881), an American scientist were considered as founders of cultural and social dimensions. [[Franz Boas]] (1858–1942), [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] (1884—1942), [[Ruth Benedict]] (1887–1948), and [[Margaret Mead]] (1901–1978), were a group of researchers from the United States who contributed the idea of [[cultural relativism]] to the literature. Boas's approach focused on the use of documents and informants, whereas Malinowski stated that a researcher should be engrossed with the work for long periods in the field and do a participant observation by living with the informant and experiencing their way of life. He gives the viewpoint of the native and this became the origin of field work and field methods.

Since Malinowski was very firm with his approach he applied it practically and traveled to [[Trobriand Islands]] which are located off the eastern coast of [[New Guinea]]. He was interested in learning the language of the islanders and stayed there for a long time doing his field work. The field of ethnography became very popular in the late 19th century, as many social scientists gained an interest in studying modern society.  Again, in the latter part of the 19th century, the field of anthropology became a good support for scientific formation.  Though the field was flourishing, it had a lot of threats to encounter. Postcolonialism, the research climate shifted towards post-modernism and feminism. Therefore, the field of anthropology moved into a discipline of social science.

==Origins==
[[Gerhard Friedrich Müller]] developed the concept of ethnography as a separate discipline whilst participating in the [[Second Kamchatka Expedition]] (1733–43) as a professor of history and geography. Whilst involved in the expedition, he differentiated ''Völker-Beschreibung'' as a distinct area of study. This became known as "ethnography," following the introduction of the Greek neologism ''ethnographia''  by Johann Friedrich Schöpperlin and the German variant by A. F. Thilo in 1767.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[August Ludwig von Schlözer]] and [[Christoph Wilhelm Jacob Gatterer]] of the [[University of Göttingen]] introduced the term into the academic discourse in an attempt to reform the contemporary understanding of world history.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Vermeulen, Han F., 2008, ''Early History of Ethnography and Ethnology in the German Enlightenment'', Leiden, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vermeulen"&gt;{{cite book|last = Vermeulen|first = Hans|title = Early History of Ethnograph and Ethnolog in the German Enlightenment: Anthropological Discourse in Europe and Asia, 1710-1808|year = 2008|publisher = Privately published|location = Leiden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]], known as the Father of History, had significant works on the cultures of various peoples beyond the Hellenic realm such as the [[Scythians]], which earned him the title "philobarbarian", and may be said to have produced the first works of ethnography.

==Forms of ethnography==

There are different forms of ethnography: confessional ethnography; life history; feminist ethnography etc. Two popular forms of ethnography are realist ethnography and critical ethnography. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 93)

Realist ethnography is a traditional approach used by cultural anthropologists. Characterized by Van Maanen (1988), it reflects a particular instance taken by the researcher toward the individual being studied. It's an objective study of the situation. It's composed from a third person's perspective by getting the data from the members on the site. The ethnographer stays as omniscient correspondent of actualities out of sight. The realist reports information in a measured style ostensibly uncontaminated by individual predisposition, political objectives, and judgment. The analyst will give a detailed report of the everyday life of the individuals under study. The ethnographer also uses standard categories for cultural description (e.g., family life, communication network). The ethnographer produces the participant's views through closely edited quotations and has the final work on how the culture is to be interpreted and presented. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 93)

Critical ethnography is a kind of ethnographic research in which the creators advocate for the liberation of groups which are marginalized in society. Critical researchers typically are politically minded people who look to take a stand of opposition to inequality and domination.  For example, a critical ethnographer might study schools that provide privileges to certain types of students, or counseling practices that serve to overlook the needs of underrepresented groups. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94). The important components of a critical ethnographer are to incorporate a value- laden introduction, empower people by giving them more authority, challenging the status quo, and addressing concerns about power and control. A critical ethnographer will study issues of power, empowerment, inequality inequity, dominance, repression, hegemony, and victimization. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94)

==Features of ethnographic research==
According to Dewan (2018) the researcher is not looking for generalizing the findings; rather, they are considering it in reference to the context of the situation. In this regard, the best way to integrate ethnography in a quantitative research would be to use it to discover and uncover relationships and then use the resultant data to test and explain the empirical assumptions &lt;ref&gt;(Dewan M. (2018) Understanding Ethnography: An ‘Exotic’ Ethnographer’s Perspective. In: Mura P., Khoo-Lattimore C. (eds) Asian Qualitative Research in Tourism. Perspectives on Asian Tourism. Springer, Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt;

* Involves investigation of very few cases, maybe just one case, in detail.
* Often involves working with primarily unconstructed data. This data had not been coded at the point of data collection in terms of a closed set of analytic categories.
* Emphasizes on exploring social phenomena rather than testing hypotheses.
* Data analysis involves interpretation of the functions and meanings of human actions. The product of this is mainly verbal explanations, where statistical analysis and quantification play a subordinate role. 
* Methodological discussions focus more on questions about how to report findings in the field than on methods of data collection and interpretation.
* Ethnographies focus on describing the culture of a group in very detailed and complex manner. The ethnography can be of the entire group or a subpart of it. 
* It involves engaging in extensive field work where data collection is mainly by interviews, symbols, artifacts, observations, and many other sources of data. 
* The researcher in ethnography type of research looks for patterns of the group's mental activities, that is their ideas and beliefs expressed through language or other activities, and how they behave in their groups as expressed through their actions that the researcher observed.
* In ethnography, the researcher gathers what is available, what is normal, what it is that people do, what they say, and how they work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Procedures for conducting ethnography==

* Determine if ethnography is the most appropriate design to use to study the research problem. Ethnography is suitable if the needs are to describe how a cultural group works and to explore their beliefs, language, behaviours and also issues faced by the group, such as power, resistance, and dominance. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94)
*  Then identify and locate a culture-sharing group to study.  This group is one whose members have been together for an extended period of time, so that their shared language, patterns of behaviour and attitudes have merged into discernible patterns. This group can also be a group that has been marginalized by society. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94)
* Select cultural themes, issues or theories to study about the group. These themes, issues, and theories provide an orienting framework for the study of the culture-sharing group. As discussed by [[Martyn Hammersley|Hammersley]] and Atkinson (2007), Wolcott (1987, 1994b, 2008-1), and Fetterman (2009). The ethnographer begins the study by examining people in interaction in ordinary settings and discerns pervasive patterns such as life cycles, events, and cultural themes. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94-95)
* For studying cultural concepts, determine which type of ethnography to use. Perhaps how the group works need to be described, or a critical ethnography can expose issues such as power, hegemony, and advocacy for certain groups (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 95)
* Should collect information in the context or setting where the group works or lives. This is called fieldwork. Types of information typically needed in ethnography are collected by going to the research site, respecting the daily lives of individuals at the site and collecting a wide variety of materials. Field issues of respect, reciprocity, deciding who owns the data and others are central to Ethnography (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 95)
*  From the many sources collected, the ethnographer analyzes the data for a description of the culture-sharing group, themes that emerge from the group and an overall interpretation (Wolcott, 1994b). The researcher begins to compile a detailed description of the culture-sharing group, by focusing on a single event, on several activities, or on the group over a prolonged period of time.
*   Forge a working set of rules or generalizations as to how the culture-sharing group works as the final product of this analysis. The final product is a holistic cultural portrait of the group that incorporates the views of the participants (emic) as well as the views of the researcher (etic). It might also advocate for the needs of the group or suggest changes in society. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 96)

==Ethnography as method==
The ethnographic method is different from other ways of conducting social science approach due to the following reasons:
[[File:Rozmowa z twórczyniami tradycyjnych, wołoskich pisanek.jpg|thumb|An ethnographer conducting field interviews, [[Wallachian Open Air Museum|Valašské muzeum v přírodě]]]]
* It is field-based. It is conducted in the settings in which real people actually live, rather than in laboratories where the researcher controls the elements of the behaviors to be observed or measured.
* It is personalized. It is conducted by researchers who are in the day-to-day, face-to-face contact with the people they are studying and who are thus both participants in and observers of the lives under study.
* It is multifactorial. It is conducted through the use of two or more data collection techniques - which may be qualitative or quantitative in nature - in order to get a conclusion.
* It requires a long-term commitment i.e. it is conducted by a researcher who intends to interact with people they are studying for an extended period of time.  The exact time frame can vary from several weeks to a year or more.
* It is inductive. It is conducted in such a way to use an accumulation of descriptive detail to build toward general patterns or explanatory theories rather than structured to test hypotheses derived from existing theories or models.
* It is dialogic.  It is conducted by a researcher whose interpretations and findings may be expounded on by the study’s participants while conclusions are still in the process of formulation.
* It is holistic. It is conducted so as to yield the fullest possible portrait of the group under study.
* It can also be used in other methodological frameworks, for instance, an action research program of study where one of the goals is to change and improve the situation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to the leading social scientist, [[John David Brewer|John Brewer]], data collection methods are meant to capture the "social meanings and ordinary activities"&lt;ref name="brewer"&gt;[Brewer, John D. (2000). ''Ethnography.'' Philadelphia: Open University Press. p.10.]&lt;/ref&gt; of people (informants) in "naturally occurring settings"&lt;ref name="brewer" /&gt; that are commonly referred to as "the field."  The goal is to collect data in such a way that the researcher imposes a minimal amount of personal bias in the data.&lt;ref name="brewer" /&gt;  Multiple methods of data collection may be employed to facilitate a relationship that allows for a more personal and in-depth portrait of the informants and their community.  These can include participant observation, field notes, interviews, and surveys.

Interviews are often taped and later transcribed, allowing the interview to proceed unimpaired of note-taking, but with all information available later for full analysis. Secondary research and document analysis are also used to provide insight into the research topic.  In the past, kinship charts were commonly used to "discover logical patterns and social structure in non-Western societies".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/def/kinship.html]{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, anthropology focuses more on the study of people in urban settings and the use of kinship charts is seldom employed.

In order to make the data collection and interpretation transparent, researchers creating ethnographies often attempt to be "reflexive". Reflexivity refers to the researcher's aim "to explore the ways in which [the] researcher's involvement with a particular study influences, acts upon and informs such research".&lt;ref&gt;[Nightingale, David &amp; Cromby, John. ''Social Constructionist Psychology: A Critical Analysis of Theory and Practice''. Philadelphia: Open University Press. p.228.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite these attempts of reflexivity, no researcher can be totally unbiased. This factor has provided a basis to criticize ethnography.

Traditionally, the ethnographer focuses attention on a community, selecting knowledgeable informants who know the activities of the community well.&lt;ref name="G1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Garson |first=G. David |url=http://faculty.chass.ncsu.edu/garson/PA765/ethno.htm |title=Ethnographic Research: Statnotes, from North Carolina State University, Public Administration Program |publisher=Faculty.chass.ncsu.edu |year=2008 |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; These informants are typically asked to identify other informants who represent the community, often using snowball or chain sampling.&lt;ref name="G1"/&gt; This process is often effective in revealing common cultural denominators connected to the topic being studied.&lt;ref name="G1"/&gt; Ethnography relies greatly on up-close, personal experience. Participation, rather than just observation, is one of the keys to this process.&lt;ref&gt;Genzuk, Michael, PH.D., ''[http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~genzuk/Ethnographic_Research.html A Synthesis of Ethnographic]'', Center for Multilingual, Multicultural Research, University of Southern California&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnography is very useful in social research.

Ybema et al. (2010) examine the ontological and epistemological presuppositions underlying ethnography.  Ethnographic research can range from a realist perspective, in which behavior is observed, to a constructivist perspective where understanding is socially constructed by the researcher and subjects. Research can range from an objectivist account of fixed, observable behaviors to an interpretive narrative describing "the interplay of individual agency and social structure."&lt;ref&gt;S. Ybema, D. Yanow, H. Wels, &amp; F. Kamsteeg (2010). "Ethnography." In A. Mills, G. Durepos, &amp; E. Wiebe (Eds.), ''Encyclopedia of Case Study Research.'' (pp. 348-352). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical theory researchers address "issues of power within the researcher-researched relationships and the links between knowledge and power."

Another form of data collection is that of the "image." The image is the projection that an individual puts on an object or abstract idea. An image can be contained within the physical world through a particular individual's perspective, primarily based on that individual’s past experiences. One example of an image is how an individual views a novel after completing it. The physical entity that is the novel contains a specific image in the perspective of the interpreting individual and can only be expressed by the individual in the terms of "I can tell you what an image is by telling you what it feels like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barry|first1=Lynda|title=Lynda Barry: The answer is in the picture|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmT4wLWksOw|website=YouTube|publisher=INKtalks|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of an image relies on the imagination and has been seen to be utilized by children in a very spontaneous and natural manner. Effectively, the idea of the image is a primary tool for ethnographers to collect data. The image presents the perspective, experiences, and influences of an individual as a single entity and in consequence, the individual will always contain this image in the group under study.

== Differences across disciplines ==
The ethnographic method is used across a range of different disciplines, primarily by anthropologists but also occasionally by sociologists. [[Cultural studies]], (European) [[ethnology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[social work]], [[education]], [[design]], [[psychology]], [[computer science]], [[human factors and ergonomics]], [[ethnomusicology]], [[folkloristics]], [[religious studies]], [[geography]], [[history]], [[linguistics]], [[communication studies]], [[performance studies]], [[advertising]], nursing, [[urban planning]], [[usability]], [[political science]],&lt;ref&gt;Schatz, Edward, ed. ''Political Ethnography: What Immersion Contributes to the Study of Power''. University Of Chicago Press. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[social movement]],&lt;ref&gt;Balsiger, P., Lambelet, A.,  Participant Observation. In D. Della Porta (Ed.), Methodological Practices in Social Movement Research (pp. 144-172). Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and [[criminology]] are other fields which have made use of ethnography.

===Cultural and social anthropology===
[[Cultural anthropology]] and [[social anthropology]] were developed around ethnographic research and their [[canon (basic principle)|canonical]] texts, which are mostly ethnographies: e.g. ''[[Argonauts of the Western Pacific]]'' (1922) by [[Bronisław Malinowski]], ''Ethnologische Excursion in Johore'' (1875) by [[Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay]],  ''[[Coming of Age in Samoa]]'' (1928) by [[Margaret Mead]], ''The Nuer'' (1940) by [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]], ''Naven'' (1936, 1958) by [[Gregory Bateson]], or "[[The Lele of the Kasai]]" (1963) by [[Mary Douglas]]. Cultural and social anthropologists today place a high value on doing ethnographic research. The typical ethnography is a document written about a particular people, almost always based at least in part on [[emic]] views of where the culture begins and ends. Using language or community boundaries to bound the ethnography is common.&lt;ref&gt;Naroll, Raoul. ''Handbook of Methods in Cultural Anthropology.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Ethnographies are also sometimes called "case studies."&lt;ref&gt;Chavez, Leo. ''Shadowed Lives: Undocumented Workers in American Society'' (Case Studies in Cultural Anthropology). 1997, Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ethnographers study and interpret culture, its universalities, and its variations through the ethnographic study based on [[fieldwork]]. An ethnography is a specific kind of written observational science which provides an account of a particular culture, society, or community. The fieldwork usually involves spending a year or more in another society, living with the local people and learning about their ways of life.  Neophyte Ethnographers are strongly encouraged to develop extensive familiarity with their subject prior to entering the field; otherwise, they may find themselves in difficult situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burns |first=Janet M.C. | title=Caught in the Riptide: Female Researcher in a Patricentric Setting.  Pp. 171-182 in Fragile Truths: 25 Years of Sociology and Anthropology in Canada.  D. Harrison, W.K. Carroll, L. Christiansen-Ruffman and Raymond Currie (eds.) | publisher=Carleton University Press | year=1992 | location=Ottawa, Ontario, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnographers are participant observers. They take part in events they study because it helps with understanding local behavior and thought. Classic examples are [[Carol B. Stack]]'s ''All Our Kin'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stack |first=Carol B. | title=All Our Kin:Strategies for Survival in a black community | publisher=Harper and Row | year=1974 | location=New York, New York | isbn=0-06-013974-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Briggs' ''Never in Anger'', [[Richard Borshay Lee|Richard Lee]]'s ''Kalahari Hunter-Gatherers'', [[Victor Turner]]'s ''Forest of Symbols'', David Maybry-Lewis' ''Akew-Shavante Society'', [[E.E. Evans-Pritchard]]'s ''The Nuer,'' and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]' ''[[Tristes Tropiques]]''. Iterations of ethnographic representations in the classic, modernist camp include Joseph W. Bastien's "Drum and Stethoscope" (1992), Bartholomew Dean's recent (2009) contribution, ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07 |title=University Press of Florida: Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia |publisher=Upf.com |date=2009-11-15 |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical ethnography attempts to be [[holistic]]&lt;ref name="Ember 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heider, Karl 2001"/&gt; and typically follows an outline to include a brief history of the culture in question, an analysis of the [[physical geography]] or terrain inhabited by the people under study, including [[climate]], and often including what biological anthropologists call [[habitat]]. Folk notions of botany and zoology are presented as ethnobotany and ethnozoology alongside references from the formal sciences. Material culture, technology, and means of subsistence are usually treated next, as they are typically bound up in physical geography and include descriptions of infrastructure.  Kinship and social structure (including age grading, peer groups, gender, voluntary associations, clans, moieties, and so forth, if they exist) are typically included. Languages spoken, dialects, and the history of language change are another group of standard topics.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Ember and Ember 2006, Heider 2001 op cit.&lt;/ref&gt;  Practices of childrearing, acculturation, and emic views on personality and values usually follow after sections on social structure.&lt;ref&gt;Ember and Ember 2006, op cit., Chapters 7 and 8&lt;/ref&gt; Rites, rituals, and other evidence of religion have long been an interest and are sometimes central to ethnographies, especially when conducted in public where visiting anthropologists can see them.&lt;ref&gt;Truner, Victor. ''The Forest of Symbols''.  remainder of citation forthcoming&lt;/ref&gt;

As ethnography developed, anthropologists grew more interested in less tangible aspects of culture, such as values, worldview and what [[Clifford Geertz]] termed the "ethos" of the culture. In his fieldwork, Geertz used elements of a [[Empirical research|phenomenological]] approach, tracing not just the doings of people, but the cultural elements themselves. For example, if within a group of people, winking was a communicative gesture, he sought to first determine what kinds of things a wink might mean (it might mean several things). Then, he sought to determine in what contexts winks were used, and whether, as one moved about a region, winks remained meaningful in the same way. In this way, cultural boundaries of communication could be explored, as opposed to using linguistic boundaries or notions about the residence. Geertz, while still following something of a traditional ethnographic outline, moved outside that outline to talk about "webs" instead of "outlines"&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Clifford. ''The Interpretation of Culture,'' Chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt; of culture.

Within cultural anthropology, there are several subgenres of ethnography.  Beginning in the 1950s and early 1960s, anthropologists began writing "bio-confessional" ethnographies that intentionally exposed the nature of ethnographic research.  Famous examples include ''[[Tristes Tropiques]]'' (1955) by Lévi-Strauss, ''The High Valley'' by Kenneth Read, and ''The Savage and the Innocent'' by [[David Maybury-Lewis]], as well as the mildly fictionalized ''Return to Laughter'' by Elenore Smith Bowen ([[Laura Bohannan]]).

Later "[[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]]" ethnographies refined the technique to translate cultural differences by representing their effects on the ethnographer.  Famous examples include ''Deep Play:  Notes on a Balinese Cockfight'' by [[Clifford Geertz]],  ''Reflections on Fieldwork in Morocco'' by [[Paul Rabinow]], ''The Headman and I'' by Jean-Paul Dumont, and ''Tuhami'' by Vincent Crapanzano.  In the 1980s, the rhetoric of ethnography was subjected to intense scrutiny within the discipline, under the general influence of [[literary theory]] and [[postcolonial|post-colonial]]/[[post-structuralist]] thought.  "Experimental" ethnographies that reveal the ferment of the discipline include ''Shamanism, Colonialism, and the Wild Man'' by [[Michael Taussig]], ''Debating Muslims'' by Michael F. J. Fischer and Mehdi Abedi, ''A Space on the Side of the Road'' by Kathleen Stewart, and ''Advocacy after Bhopal'' by Kim Fortun.

This critical turn in sociocultural anthropology during the mid-1980s can be traced to the influence of the now classic (and often contested) text, ''Writing Culture: The Poetics and Politics of Ethnography'', (1986) edited by [[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]] and [[George E. Marcus|George Marcus]]. ''Writing Culture'' helped bring changes to both anthropology and ethnography often described in terms of being 'postmodern,' 'reflexive,' 'literary,' 'deconstructive,' or 'poststructural' in nature, in that the text helped to highlight the various epistemic and political predicaments that many practitioners saw as plaguing ethnographic representations and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Olaf Zenker &amp; Karsten Kumoll. ''Beyond Writing Culture: Current Intersections of Epistemologies and Representational Practices.'' (2010). New York: Berghahn Books. {{ISBN|978-1-84545-675-7}}. Pgs. 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Where Geertz's and [[Victor Turner|Turner's]] interpretive anthropology recognized subjects as creative actors who constructed their sociocultural worlds out of symbols, postmodernists attempted to draw attention to the privileged status of the ethnographers themselves. That is, the ethnographer cannot escape the personal viewpoint in creating an ethnographic account, thus making any claims of objective neutrality highly problematic, if not altogether impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Erickson &amp; Liam D. Murphy. ''A History of Anthropological Theory,'' Third Edition. (2008). Toronto: Broadview Press. {{ISBN|978-1-55111-871-0}}. Pg. 190&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to this last point, ''Writing Culture'' became a focal point for looking at how ethnographers could describe different cultures and societies without denying the subjectivity of those individuals and groups being studied while simultaneously doing so without laying claim to absolute knowledge and objective authority.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson &amp; Murphy (2008). A History of Anthropological Theory, Pgs. 190-191&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the development of experimental forms such as 'dialogic anthropology,' 'narrative ethnography,'&lt;ref&gt;Kristen Ghodsee, "Writing Ethnographies that Ordinary People Can Read." {{cite web |url=http://www.anthropology-news.org/index.php/2013/05/24/writing-ethnographies-that-ordinary-people-can-read/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227060610/http://www.anthropology-news.org/index.php/2013/05/24/writing-ethnographies-that-ordinary-people-can-read/ |archivedate=2013-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 'literary ethnography',&lt;ref&gt;Literary Ethnography http://literary-ethnography.tumblr.com/&lt;/ref&gt; ''Writing Culture'' helped to encourage the development of 'collaborative ethnography.'&lt;ref name="ZenkerKumoll"&gt;Olaf Zenker &amp; Karsten Kumoll. Beyond Writing Culture: Current Intersections of Epistemologies and Representational Practices. (2010). New York: Berghahn Books. {{ISBN|978-1-84545-675-7}}. Pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; This exploration of the relationship between writer, audience, and subject has become a central tenet of contemporary anthropological and ethnographic practice. In certain instances, active collaboration between the researcher(s) and subject(s) has helped blend the practice of collaboration in ethnographic fieldwork with the process of creating the ethnographic product resulting from the research.&lt;ref name="ZenkerKumoll"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luke E. Lassiter (2001). "From 'Reading over the Shoulders of Natives' to 'Reading alongside Natives', Literally: Toward a Collaborative and Reciprocal Ethnography", in ''Journal of Anthropologcal Research,'' 57(2):137-149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luke E. Lassiter. "Collaborative Ethnography and Public Anthropology". (2005). ''Current Anthropology,'' 46(1):83-106&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology===
{{Sociology}}
[[Sociology]] is another field which prominently features ethnographies. [[Urban sociology]], Atlanta University (now Clark-Atlanta University), and the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School,]] in particular, are associated with ethnographic research, with some well-known early examples being ''[[The Philadelphia Negro]]'' (1899) by W. E. B. Du Bois, ''[[Street Corner Society]]'' by [[William Foote Whyte]] and ''[[Black Metropolis]]'' by [[St. Clair Drake]] and [[Horace R. Cayton, Jr.]]. Major influences on this development were anthropologist [[Lloyd Warner]], on the Chicago sociology faculty, and to [[Robert E. Park|Robert Park]]'s experience as a journalist. [[Symbolic interactionism]] developed from the same tradition and yielded such sociological ethnographies as ''Shared Fantasy'' by [[Gary Alan Fine]], which documents the early history of fantasy [[role-playing games]].  Other important ethnographies in sociology include [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s work on Algeria and France.

Jaber F. Gubrium's series of organizational ethnographies focused on the everyday practices of illness, care, and recovery are notable.  They include ''Living and Dying at Murray Manor,'' which describes the social worlds of a nursing home; ''Describing Care: Image and Practice in Rehabilitation,'' which documents the social organization of patient subjectivity in a physical rehabilitation hospital; ''Caretakers: Treating Emotionally Disturbed Children,'' which features the social construction of behavioral disorders in children; and ''Oldtimers and Alzheimer's: The Descriptive Organization of Senility,'' which describes how the Alzheimer's disease movement constructed a new subjectivity of senile dementia and how that is organized in a geriatric hospital. Another approach to ethnography in sociology comes in the form of [[institutional ethnography]], developed by [[Dorothy E. Smith]] for studying the social relations which structure people's everyday lives.

Other notable ethnographies include [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]]'s ''Learning to Labour,'' on working class youth; the work of [[Elijah Anderson]], [[Mitchell Duneier]], and [[Loïc Wacquant]] on black America, and Lai Olurode's ''Glimpses of Madrasa From Africa''.  But even though many sub-fields and theoretical perspectives within sociology use ethnographic methods, ethnography is not the ''[[sine qua non]]'' of the discipline, as it is in cultural anthropology.

=== Communication Studies ===
Beginning in the 1960s and 1970s, ethnographic research methods began to be widely used by communication scholars. As the purpose of ethnography is to describe and interpret the shared and learned patterns of values, behaviors, beliefs, and language of a culture-sharing group, Harris, (1968), also Agar (1980) note that ethnography is both a process and an outcome of the research. Studies such as [[Gerry Philipsen|Gerry Philipsen's]] analysis of cultural communication strategies in a [[blue-collar]], working-class neighborhood on the south side of Chicago, ''Speaking 'Like a Man' in Teamsterville'', paved the way for the expansion of ethnographic research in the study of communication.

Scholars of [[communication studies]] use ethnographic research methods to analyze communicative behaviors and phenomena. This is often characterized in the writing as attempts to understand taken-for-granted routines by which working definitions are socially produced. Ethnography as a method is a storied, careful, and systematic examination of the reality-generating mechanisms of everyday life (Coulon, 1995). Ethnographic work in communication studies seeks to explain "how" ordinary methods/practices/performances construct the ordinary actions used by ordinary people in the accomplishments of their identities. This often gives the perception of trying to answer the "why" and "how come" questions of human communication.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, R. B., Rubin, A. M., and Piele, L. J. (2005). ''Communication Research: Strategies and Sources.'' Belmont, California: Thomson Wadworth. pp. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;  Often this type of research results in a [[case study]] or [[field study]] such as an analysis of speech patterns at a protest rally, or the way firemen communicate during "down time" at a fire station.  Like anthropology scholars, communication scholars often immerse themselves, and participate in and/or directly observe the particular [[social group]] being studied.&lt;ref&gt;Bentz, V. M., and Shapiro, J. J. (1998). ''Mindful Inquiry in Social Research.'' Thousand Oaks, California: Sage. pp. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other fields===
The American anthropologist [[George Spindler]] was a pioneer in applying the ethnographic methodology to the classroom.

Anthropologists such as [[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]] and [[Mary Douglas]] have used ethnographic data to answer academic questions about consumers and consumption.  In this sense, Tony Salvador, [[Genevieve Bell]], and Ken Anderson describe design ethnography as being "a way of understanding the particulars of daily life in such a way as to increase the success probability of a new product or service or, more appropriately, to reduce the probability of failure specifically due to a lack of understanding of the basic behaviors and frameworks of consumers."&lt;ref&gt;Salvador, Tony; Genevieve Bell; and Ken Anderson (1999) "Design Ethnography," ''Design Management Journal'' (pp. 35-41). p.37&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Sam Ladner argues in her book,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Ethnography-Guide-Private-Sector/dp/1611323908/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396459593&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sam+ladner] ''Practical Ethnography''&lt;/ref&gt; that understanding consumers and their desires requires a shift in "standpoint," one that only ethnography provides. The results are products and services that respond to consumers' unmet needs.

Businesses, too, have found ethnographers helpful for understanding how people use products and services. Companies make increasing use of ethnographic methods to understand consumers and consumption, or for new product development (such as [[video ethnography]]). The ''Ethnographic Praxis in Industry'' (EPIC) conference is evidence of this. Ethnographers' systematic and holistic approach to real-life experience is valued by product developers, who use the method to understand unstated desires or cultural practices that surround products. Where focus groups fail to inform marketers about what people really do, ethnography links what people say to what they do—avoiding the pitfalls that come from relying only on self-reported, focus-group data. Modern developments in computing power and AI have enabled higher efficiencies in ethnographic data collection via multimedia and computational analysis using machine learning.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon A, Liu Y, Setchi R. [http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=2592105 Computer-Aided Ethnography in Engineering Design]. ASME. International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference, Volume 7: 28th International Conference on Design Theory and Methodology ():V007T06A007. doi:10.1115/DETC2016-59832.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluating ethnography ==
The Ethnographic methodology is not usually evaluated in terms of philosophical standpoint (such as [[positivism]] and [[Appearance emotionalism|emotionalism]]). Ethnographic studies need to be evaluated in some manner.  No consensus has been developed on evaluation standards, but Richardson (2000, p.&amp;nbsp;254)&lt;ref&gt;Richardson,L. (2000). "Evaluating ethnography," in ''Qualitative Inquiry,'' 6(2), 253-255&lt;/ref&gt;  provides five criteria that ethnographers might find helpful. Jaber F. Gubrium and James A. Holstein's (1997) monograph, ''The New Language of Qualitative Method,'' discusses forms of ethnography in terms of their "methods talk."

# ''Substantive contribution'': "Does the piece contribute to our understanding of social life?"
# ''Aesthetic merit'': "Does this piece succeed aesthetically?"
# ''Reflexivity'': "How did the author come to write this text…Is there adequate self-awareness and self-exposure for the reader to make judgments about the point of view?"&lt;ref&gt;For post-colonial critiques of ethnography from various locations, see essays in Prem Poddar et al, ''Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures--Continental Europe and its Empires,'' Edinburgh University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Impact'': "Does this affect me? Emotionally? Intellectually?"  Does it move me?
# ''Expresses a reality'': "Does it seem 'true'—a credible account of a cultural, social, individual, or communal sense of the 'real'?"

==Challenges of ethnography==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2015}}
Ethnography, which is a method dedicated entirely to field work, is aimed at gaining a deeper insight of a certain people's knowledge and social culture.

Ethnography's advantages are:
* It can open up certain experiences during group research that other research methods fail to cover.
* Notions that are taken for granted can be highlighted and confronted.
* It can tap into intuitive and deep human understanding of and interpretations of (by the ethnographer) the accounts of informants (those who are being studied), which goes far beyond what quantitative research can do in terms of extracting meanings.
* Ethnography allows people outside of a culture (whether of a primitive tribe or of a corporation's employees) to learn about its members' practices, motives, understandings, and values.

However, there are certain challenges or limitations for the ethnographic method: 
* Deep expertise is required: Ethnographers must accumulate knowledge about the methods and domains of interest, which can take considerable training and time.
* Sensitivity: The ethnographer is an outsider and must exercise discretion and caution to avoid offending, alienating or harming those being observed.
* Access: Negotiating access to field sites and participants can be time-consuming and difficult. Secretive or guarded organizations may require different approaches in order for researchers to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |last=Monahan |first=Torin, Fisher, Jill A. | year = 2014 | title = Strategies for Obtaining Access to Secretive or Guarded Organizations | journal = Journal of Contemporary Ethnography | doi=10.1177/0891241614549834|pmc=4679148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Duration and cost: Research can involve prolonged time in the field, particularly because building trust with participants is usually necessary for obtaining rich data.
* Bias: Ethnographers bring their own experience to bear in pursuing questions to ask and reviewing data, which can lead to biases in directions of inquiry and analysis.
* Descriptive approach:  Ethnography relies heavily on storytelling and the presentation of critical incidents, which is inevitably selective and viewed as a weakness by those used to the scientific approaches of hypothesis testing, quantification and replication.

Among the dangers of ethnography are that it can become indistinguishable from a kind of [[embedded journalism]] or [[blog]] with academic jargon giving it the veneer of academic legitimacy but without actually meeting the classic requirements for ethnography.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, B. (2013).  "Post-Cold War Anthropology as  Ideological Blog:  Purging Klukhohn and Mead for a Diary Read",  ''Journal of Developing Societies'', Spring, Volume 29, No. 1, 61-87.  &lt;/ref&gt;  A series of tests can be applied to determine whether work is actually ethnography or academic journalism depending on the focus of the study (an "ethnos"), the scientific hypotheses and questions, whether there is model building, whether there are cross-cultural comparisons, and the purpose, uses and forms of the work.

==Ethics==
[[Gary Alan Fine]] argues that the nature of ethnographic inquiry demands that researchers deviate from formal and idealistic rules or ethics that have come to be widely accepted in qualitative and quantitative approaches in research. Many of these ethical assumptions are rooted in positivist and post-positivist [[epistemology|epistemologies]] that have adapted over time but are apparent and must be accounted for in all research paradigms. These ethical dilemmas are evident throughout the entire process of conducting ethnographies, including the design, implementation, and reporting of an ethnographic study. Essentially, Fine maintains that researchers are typically not as ethical as they claim or assume to be — and that "each job includes ways of doing things that would be inappropriate for others to know".&lt;ref&gt;Fine, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

Fine is not necessarily casting blame at ethnographic researchers but tries to show that researchers often make idealized ethical claims and standards which in are inherently based on partial truths and self-deceptions. Fine also acknowledges that many of these partial truths and self-deceptions are unavoidable. He maintains that "illusions" are essential to maintain an occupational reputation and avoid potentially more caustic consequences. He claims, "Ethnographers cannot help but lie, but in lying, we reveal truths that escape those who are not so bold".&lt;ref&gt;Fine, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these assertions, Fine establishes three conceptual clusters in which ethnographic ethical dilemmas can be situated: "Classic Virtues", "Technical Skills", and "Ethnographic Self".

Much debate surrounding the issue of ethics arose following revelations about how the ethnographer [[Napoleon Chagnon]] conducted his ethnographic fieldwork with the [[Yanomani]] people of South America.

While there is no international standard on Ethnographic Ethics, many western anthropologists look to the American Anthropological Association for guidance when conducting ethnographic work.&lt;ref&gt;''American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics'' http://www.aaanet.org/issues/policy-advocacy/upload/AAA-Ethics-Code-2009.pdf, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the Association adopted a code of ethics, stating: Anthropologists have "moral obligations as members of other groups, such as the family, religion, and community, as well as the profession".&lt;ref name="Ethics p.1"&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The code of ethics notes that anthropologists are part of a wider scholarly and political network, as well as human and natural environment, which needs to be reported on respectfully.&lt;ref name="Ethics p.1"/&gt; The code of ethics recognizes that sometimes very close and personal relationship can sometimes develop from doing ethnographic work.&lt;ref name="Ethics p.1"/&gt; The Association acknowledges that the code is limited in scope; ethnographic work can sometimes be multidisciplinary, and anthropologists need to be familiar with ethics and perspectives of other disciplines as well.&lt;ref&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;  The eight-page code of ethics outlines ethical considerations for those conducting Research, Teaching, Application and Dissemination of Results, which are briefly outlined below.&lt;ref&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.1-8&lt;/ref&gt;

* "Conducting Research" - When conducting research Anthropologists need to be aware of the potential impacts of the research on the people and animals they study.&lt;ref name="Ethics p.2-3"&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.2-3&lt;/ref&gt;  If the seeking of new knowledge will negatively impact the people and animals they will be studying they may not undertake the study according to the code of ethics.&lt;ref name="Ethics p.2-3"/&gt;
* "Teaching" - When teaching the discipline of anthropology, instructors are required to inform students of the ethical dilemmas of conducting ethnographies and field work.&lt;ref&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Application" - When conducting an ethnography, Anthropologists must be "open with funders, colleagues, persons studied or providing information, and relevant parties affected by the work about the purpose(s), potential impacts, and source(s) of support for the work."&lt;ref name="Ethics p.5"&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Dissemination of Results" - When disseminating results of an ethnography, "[a]nthropologists have an ethical obligation to consider the potential impact of both their research and the communication or dissemination of the results of their research on all directly or indirectly involved."&lt;ref&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.5-6&lt;/ref&gt;  Research results of ethnographies should not be withheld from participants in the research if that research is being observed by other people.&lt;ref name="Ethics p.5"/&gt;

===Classic virtues===
* "The kindly ethnographer" – Most ethnographers present themselves as being more sympathetic than they are, which aids in the research process, but is also deceptive. The identity that we present to subjects is different from who we are in other circumstances.
* "The friendly ethnographer" – Ethnographers operate under the assumption that they should not dislike anyone. When ethnographers find they intensely dislike individuals encountered in the research, they may crop them out of the findings.&lt;ref name="Fine"&gt;Fine, p. 270-77&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The honest ethnographer" – If research participants know the research goals, their responses will likely be skewed. Therefore, ethnographers often conceal what they know in order to increase the likelihood of acceptance by participants.&lt;ref name="Fine" /&gt;

===Technical skills===
* "The Precise Ethnographer" – Ethnographers often create the illusion that field notes are data and reflect what "really" happened. They engage in the opposite of plagiarism, giving undeserved credit through loose interpretations and paraphrasing. Researchers take near-fictions and turn them into claims of fact. The closest ethnographers can ever really get to reality is an approximate truth.
* "The Observant Ethnographer" – Readers of ethnography are often led to assume the report of a scene is complete – that little of importance was missed. In reality, an ethnographer will always miss some aspect because of lacking omniscience. Everything is open to multiple interpretations and misunderstandings. As ethnographers' skills in observation and collection of data vary by individual, what is depicted in ethnography can never be the whole picture.
* "The Unobtrusive Ethnographer" – As a "participant" in the scene, the researcher will always have an effect on the communication that occurs within the research site. The degree to which one is an "active member" affects the extent to which sympathetic understanding is possible.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, p. 277-81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnographic Self===
The following are commonly misconceived conceptions of ethnographers:

* "The Candid Ethnographer" – Where the researcher personally situates within the ethnography is ethically problematic. There is an illusion that everything reported was observed by the researcher.
* "The Chaste Ethnographer" – When ethnographers participate within the field, they invariably develop relationships with research subjects/participants. These relationships are sometimes not accounted for within the reporting of the ethnography, although they may influence the research findings.
* "The Fair Ethnographer" – Fine claims that objectivity is an illusion and that everything in ethnography is known from a perspective. Therefore, it is unethical for a researcher to report fairness in findings.
* "The Literary Ethnographer" – Representation is a balancing act of determining what to "show" through poetic/prosaic language and style, versus what to "tell" via straightforward, 'factual' reporting. The individual skills of an ethnographer influence what appears to be the value of the research.&lt;ref name="Fine, p. 282-89"&gt;Fine, p. 282-89&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Norman K. Denzin, ethnographers should consider the following eight principles when observing, recording, and sampling data:

# The groups should combine symbolic meanings with patterns of interaction.
# Observe the world from the point of view of the subject, while maintaining the distinction between everyday and scientific perceptions of reality.
# Link the group's symbols and their meanings with the social relationships.
# Record all behavior.
# The methodology should highlight phases of process, change, and stability.
# The act should be a type of symbolic interactionism.
# Use concepts that would avoid casual explanations.

'''''Finding Darwin's God: A Scientist's Search for Common Ground Between God and Evolution''''' is a 2000 book by the American [[cell biologist]] and [[Roman Catholic]] [[Kenneth R. Miller]] wherein he argues that [[evolution]] does not contradict religious faith. Miller argues that evolution occurred, that the earth is not [[young earth creationism|young]], that science must work based on [[methodological naturalism]], and that evolution cannot be construed as an effective argument for [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |author= Henry E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5169">'''Imaging science''' is a multidisciplinary field concerned with the generation, collection, duplication, analysis, modification, and visualization of [[image]]s,&lt;ref name="hornak2002"&gt;Joseph P. Hornak, ''Encyclopedia of Imaging Science and Technology''  ([[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], 2002) {{ISBN|9780471332763}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[image|imaging]] things that the [[human eye]] cannot detect. As an evolving field it includes research and researchers from [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[electrical engineering]], [[computer vision]], [[computer science]], and [[perceptual psychology]]. Currently, the only institution that has imaging science in their program is the Rochester Institute of Technology at the Carlson Center for Imaging science.

==Imaging chain==
The foundation of imaging science as a discipline is the "imaging chain" – a conceptual model describing all of the factors which must be considered when developing a system for creating visual renderings (images).  In general, the links of the imaging chain include:

'''1. The human visual system'''.  Designers must also consider the [[psychophysics|psychophysical]] processes which take place in human beings as they make sense of information received through the visual system.

'''2. The subject of the image'''.  When developing an imaging system, designers must consider the observables associated with the subjects which will be imaged.  These observables generally take the form of emitted or reflected energy, such as [[electromagnetic energy]] or [[mechanical energy]].

'''3. The capture device'''.  Once the observables associated with the subject are characterized, designers can then identify and integrate the technologies needed to capture those observables.  For example, in the case of consumer [[digital cameras]], those technologies include optics for collecting energy in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, and electronic detectors for converting the electromagnetic energy into an electronic signal.

'''4. The processor'''.  For all [[digital imaging]] systems, the electronic signals produced by the capture device must be manipulated by an algorithm which formats the signals so they can be displayed as an image.  In practice, there are often multiple processors involved in the creation of a digital image.

'''5.  The display'''.  The display takes the electronic signals which have been manipulated by the processor and renders them on some visual medium.  Examples include paper (for printed, or "hard copy" images), television, computer monitor, or projector.

Note that some imaging scientists will include additional "links" in their description of the imaging chain.  For example, some will include the "source" of the energy which "illuminates" or interacts with the subject of the image.  Others will include storage and/or transmission systems.

Subfields within imaging science include:  [[image processing]], [[computer vision]], [[3D computer graphics]], [[animations]], [[atmospheric optics]],  [[astronomical imaging]], [[digital image restoration]], [[digital imaging]], [[color|color science]], [[digital photography]], [[holography]], [[magnetic resonance imaging]], [[medical imaging]], [[microdensitometry]], [[optics]], [[photography]], [[remote sensing]],  [[radar imaging]],  [[radiometry]], [[silver halide]], [[ultrasound imaging]], [[photoacoustic imaging in biomedicine|photoacoustic imaging]], [[thermal imaging]], [[visual perception]], and various printing technologies.

A '''lignotuber''' is a woody swelling of the [[root crown]] possessed by some plants as a protection against destruction of the plant stem, such as by fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Paula S. |author2=Naulin P.I. |author3=Arce C. |author4=Galaz C. |author5=Pausas J.G. | year = 2016 | title = Lignotubers in Mediterranean basin plants | doi = 10.1007/s11258-015-0538-9 | journal = Plant Ecology | volume =  | issue = | page =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The crown contains [[bud]]s from which new stems may sprout, as well as stores of [[starch]] that can support a period of growth in the absence of [[photosynthesis]]. The term "lignotuber" was coined in 1924 by Australian botanist Leslie R. Kerr.

Plants possessing lignotubers include ''[[Eucalyptus marginata]]'' (Jarrah), ''[[Eucalyptus brevifolia]]'' (Snappy Gum) and ''[[Eucalyptus ficifolia]]'' (Scarlet Gum) all of which can have lignotubers ten feet (3&amp;nbsp;meters) wide and three feet (one&amp;nbsp;meter) deep as well as most [[mallee (habit)|mallee]]s, and many ''[[Banksia]]'' species. Lignotubers develop from the [[cotyledon]]ary bud in seedlings of several [[Quercus|oak]] species including cork oak ''[[Quercus suber]]'', but do not develop in several other oak species, and are not apparent in mature cork oak trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lignotuber Ontogeny in the Cork-Oak (''Quercus suber''; Fagaceae). I. Late Embryo|author1=M. L. Molinas  |author2=D. Verdaguer|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=80|issue=2|year=1993|pages=172–181|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2445037?uid=3739448&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102534421303|doi=10.2307/2445037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest known lignotubers (also called "root collar burls") are those of the Coast Redwood ''([[Sequoia sempervirens]])'' of central and northern [[California]] and extreme southwestern [[Oregon]].   A lignotuber washed into Big Lagoon (30 miles (48&amp;nbsp;km) north of [[Eureka, California]]) by the full gale storm of 1977 was 41 feet (12.5&amp;nbsp;meters) in diameter and about half as tall and estimated to weigh 525 short tons (476.3 &amp;nbsp;metric tonnes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Del Tredici | first= Peter |date= Fall 1999 | title= Redwood Burls - Immortality Underground |journal= Arnoldia |volume= 59 | issue= 3 | page=photo and caption p. 19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest dicot lignotubers are those of the Chinese Camphor Tree, or Kusu  ''([[Cinnamomum camphora]])'' of [[Japan]], [[China]] and the [[Korea]]s.  Ones at the Vergelegan Estate in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]] which were planted in the late 1600s have muffin-shaped lignotubers up to six feet  (2&amp;nbsp;meters) high and about thirty feet (9&amp;nbsp;meters) in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Esterhuyse |first= Neels et al | title= Remarkable Trees of South Africa | location= Pretoria | publisher= Briza Publications |pages= 102–103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pakenham | first= Thomas | title= Remarkable Trees of the World | location= New York | publisher= W. W. Norton and Co. |pages=  122–123 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the largest lignotuber in Australia would be that of "Old Bottle Butt", a Red Bloodwood Tree (Corymbia gummifera) near Wauchope, New South Wales which has a lignotuber about eight feet (2.5 meters) in height, and seventeen feet thick (16.3 meters circumference) at breast height. &lt;ref&gt; {{ cite web |  url= http://www.nationalregisterofbigtrees.com.au/listing_view.php?listing_id=535 | title= "National Register Of Big Trees" |  last= &lt;not stated&gt; |  access-date= October 27, 2017 | }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

Many plants with lignotubers grow in a shrubby habit, but with multiple stems arising from the lignotuber. The term '''lignotuberous shrub''' is used to describe this habit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2619">3D graphics have become so popular, particularly in [[video game]]s, that specialized [[Application programming interface|API]]s (application programming interfaces) have been created to ease the processes in all stages of computer graphics generation. These APIs have also proved vital to computer graphics hardware manufacturers, as they provide a way for [[programmer]]s to access the hardware in an abstract way, while still taking advantage of the special hardware of any specific [[graphics card]].

The first 3D graphics framework was probably [[3D Core Graphics System|Core]], published by the ACM in 1977.

==Low-level 3D API==
These APIs for 3D computer graphics are particularly popular:
* [[Direct3D]] (a subset of [[DirectX]])
* [[Glide (API)|Glide]]
* [[Mantle (API)|Mantle]] developed by AMD.
* [[Metal (API)|Metal]] developed by Apple.
* [[MonoGame]]
* [[OpenGL]] and the [[OpenGL Shading Language]]
* [[OpenGL ES]] 3D API for embedded devices
* [[QuickDraw 3D]] developed by Apple Computer starting in 1995, abandoned in 1998
* [[RenderMan Interface Specification|RenderMan]]
* [[RenderWare]]
* [[Vulkan (API)|Vulkan]]
* [[PlayStation 3 system software|LibGCM]]

===Web-based API===
* [[WebGL]] is a JavaScript interface for OpenGL-ES-2.x API, promoted by [[Khronos Group|Khronos]]. This is gaining more interest recently, as this enables applications to use native graphics.

==High-level 3D API==
There are also higher-level 3D [[scene graph|scene-graph]] APIs which provide additional functionality on top of the lower-level rendering API. Such libraries under active development include:
* [[ClanLib]]
* [[Crystal Space]]
* [[HOOPS 3D Graphics System]]
* [[Horde3D (game engine)|Horde3D]]
* [[Irrlicht Engine]]
* [[Java 3D]]
* [[Java FX]]
* [[JMonkey Engine]]
* [[JT (visualization format)|JT Open]] from [[Siemens PLM Software]]
* [[Mobile 3D Graphics API]] (M3G; JSR-184)
* [[OGRE]]
* [[OpenGL Performer]]
* [[OpenSceneGraph]]
* [[OpenSG]]
* [[QSDK]]
* [[VTK]]

===JavaScript-based engines===
There is more interest in [[web browser]] based high-level API for 3D graphics engines. Some are:
* [[A-Frame (VR)|A-Frame]]
* [[Blend4Web]]
* [[CopperLicht]]
* [[O3D]]
* [[StormEngineC]]
* [[Three.js]]
* [[Verge3D]]
* [[X3DOM]]

===Flash-based engines===
* [[Stage3D]] in the 3D library in Flash version 11 and later
* [[Papervision3D]] and its fork [[Away3D]] for Flash

A '''long-range locator''' is a class of devices purported to be a type of [[metal detector]], supposedly able to detect a variety of substances, including gold, drugs and explosives; most are said to operate on a principle of resonance with the material being detected.

==Theory of operation==
Skeptics have examined the internals of many such devices and found those that have been examined to be incapable of operating as advertised, and have dismissed them as overpriced [[dowsing]] rods or similarly useless devices. Virtually all such devices claim to operate on a [[resonance|resonant frequency]] principle where the device is said to emit an electromagnetic signal, either through an antenna or a probe, that will respond to a specific substance such as gold, silver, or sometimes even paper money, and that the device will indicate the presence of such material by indicating a change in direction relative to the operator.

This theory of operation is not supported by scientific theory; the devices have not been shown to work in blind testing, and the resonance principle invoked has not been shown to work in laboratories (and is not consistently employed by LRL manufacturers). In addition, the [[Inverse square law|Inverse-Square Law]] limits the effective possible signal strength of any putative LRL; moreover, not only does this attenuation apply to the supposed emissions from the LRL devices, but the return signals from the sought-after targets are further attenuated by the same constraints. Since most of these LRL devices are powered by low voltage, low current AA, AAA or 9v cells, the resultant power available for emissions is quite minuscule at best, and the return signal would suffer even greater attenuation. Examples exist of LRL devices having no internal power source at all, and these are advertised as being self-powered or powered by ambient [[static electricity]]; these are indistinguishable from dowsing rods.

==Scientific evaluation==

Many such devices contain non-functional circuitry or naively constructed approximations of radio transmitters. A few do have functional circuitry, putting out a weak signal with a function generator or a simple timer circuit, but are still largely useless in comparison with a coil-based metal detector; others have been found to contain intentionally obfuscated or completely superfluous components (from individual components such as inductors or ribbon cables up to, in some cases, pocket [[calculator]]s), often indicative of intentional fraud, incompetence, or both, by the designer. Such functioning circuitry as exists in such devices usually has no obvious way (motor, solenoid, etc.) to connect to any rotating joint in the device either, meaning the devices are often entirely dependent on the [[ideomotor effect]] to function.

==Media exposure and controversy==

Author [[Tom Clancy]] came under fire for including the DKL Lifeguard,&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/refuge/dkl.html skepdic.com: DKL Lifeguard]&lt;/ref&gt; a long-range locator purported to be useful for detecting people, in critical passages of his novel ''[[Rainbow Six]]''. A study by [[Sandia National Laboratories]] proved the Lifeguard to be completely useless,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.prod.sandia.gov/cgi-bin/techlib/access-control.pl/1998/980977.pdf |title=Double-Blind Evaluation of the DKL LifeGuard Model 2 |date=April 29, 1998 |publisher=Sandia National Laboratories |last1=Murray |first1=Dale W. |last2=Spencer |first2=Floyd W. |last3=Spencer |first3=Debra D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other designs by the Lifeguard's creator Thomas Afilani have been shown to contain numerous dummy components with no clear function.

Accusing the manufacturers of fraud, the UK [[GT 200#Export ban and police investigation|banned export of the GT 200]], used by the government of Thailand, and [[ADE 651#Investigations and export ban|the ADE 651]], used by the government of Iraq, in January 2010.

'''''On a Piece of Chalk''''' was an 1868 lecture by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] to the working men of [[Norwich]] during a meeting of the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]].&lt;ref name="Wolfle-1967" /&gt; It was published as an essay in ''[[Macmillan's Magazine]]'' in London later that year. The piece reconstructs the geological history of [[Great Britain|Britain]] from a simple piece of [[chalk]] and demonstrates science as "organized common sense".&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krulwich|first1=Robert|authorlink1=Robert Krulwich|title=Thinking Too Much About Chalk|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/krulwich/2012/07/12/156629934/thinking-too-much-about-chalk|website=NPR|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''On a Piece of Chalk'' was republished by [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]] in 1967 with an introduction by [[Loren Eiseley]] and illustrations by Rudolf Freund.&lt;ref name="Wolfle-1967"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolfle|first1=Dael|title=Huxley's Classic of Explanation|journal=Science|date=12 May 1967|volume=156|issue=3776|pages=815–816|jstor=1722013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In 1967, Dael Wolfle of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] gave a favorable review for ''On a Piece of Chalk'', writing:
{{quote|That the lessons of paleontology are now so much more widely appreciated than they were when Huxley drew them from a piece of carpenter's chalk is in good measure a tribute to Huxley's genius. We have much more factual knowledge than he had, but we have no better exemplar of the art of explaining in compelling and understandable terms what science is about, nor a more vigorous example of the scientist's obligation to practice that art.&lt;ref name="Wolfle-1967" /&gt;}}

In April 2015, physicist and Nobel laureate [[Steven Weinberg]] included ''On a Piece of Chalk'' in a personal list of "the 13 best science books for the general reader".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weinberg|first1=Steven|authorlink1=Steven Weinberg|title=Steven Weinberg: the 13 best science books for the general reader|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/03/steven-weinberg-13-best-science-books-general-reader|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=12 June 2015|date=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paprika oleoresin''' (also known as '''paprika extract''' and '''oleoresin paprika''') is an oil-soluble extract from the fruits of ''[[Capsicum annuum]]'' or ''[[Capsicum frutescens]]'', and is primarily used as a colouring and/or flavouring in food products. It is composed of [[vegetable oil]] (often in the range of 97% to 98%), [[capsaicin]], the main flavouring compound giving [[pungency]] in higher concentrations, and capsanthin and [[capsorubin]], the main colouring compounds (among other [[carotenoid]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pérez-Gálvez A, Martin HD, Sies H, Stahl W | title=Incorporation of carotenoids from paprika oleoresin into human chylomicrons | journal=Br. J. Nutr. | volume=89 | issue = 6 | pages= 787–93 | year=2003 |pmid=12828795 | doi=10.1079/BJN2003842}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is much milder than [[capsicum oleoresin]], often containing no capsaicin at all. 

Extraction is performed by percolation with a variety of solvents, primarily [[hexane]], which are removed prior to use. Vegetable oil is then added to ensure a uniform color saturation.&lt;ref name="Jarén-Galán_1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jarén-Galán M, Nienaber U, Schwartz SJ | title=Paprika (Capsicum annuum) Oleoresin Extraction with Supercritical Carbon Dioxide | journal=J.

==Uses==
Foods coloured with paprika oleoresin include cheese, orange juice, spice mixtures, sauces, sweets and emulsified processed meats. In poultry feed, it is used to deepen the colour of egg yolks.

In the United States, paprika oleoresin is listed as a color additive “exempt from certification” ([http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_02/21cfr73_02.html] Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations part 73). In Europe, paprika oleoresin (extract), and the compounds capsanthin and capsorubin are designated by E160c.

Professor '''Philip MacDonald Sheppard''', [[Royal Society|F.R.S.]] (27 July 1921 &amp;ndash; 17 October 1976) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[geneticist]] and [[lepidopterist]]. He made advances in [[ecological genetics|ecological]] and [[population genetics]] in [[lepidoptera]]ns, pulmonate land [[snails]] and humans. In medical genetics, he worked with Sir Cyril Clarke on [[Rh disease]].

He was born on 27 July 1921 in [[Marlborough, Wiltshire]], England and attended [[Marlborough College]] from 1935 to 1939.

*1940 to 1945 - [[Royal Air Force]] Volunteer Reserve (prisoner-of-war from 1942 to 1945).
*1946 to 1948 - Studied [[Zoology]] at [[Worcester College]], [[Oxford University]].
*1956 to 1959 - Lecturer at Liverpool University
*1959 to 1962 - Reader at Liverpool University
*1963 to 1976 - Professor of genetics at [[Liverpool University]]
*18 March 1965 - [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]
*1974 - [[Darwin Medal]] of the [[Royal Society]]
*1975 - [[Linnean Medal]] (Gold Medal) for Zoology from the [[Linnean Society of London]]

[[Cyril Clarke]] answered an advert in an insect magazine for [[swallowtail butterfly]] [[pupa]] that had been placed by Sheppard. They met and began working together in their common interest of lepidoptery.  They also worked on Rh disease.

In 1961 Sheppard started a colony of [[scarlet tiger moth]]s by the [[Wirral Country Park|Wirral Way]], [[West Kirby]], [[Merseyside]], which were rediscovered in 1988 by [[Cyril Clarke]], who continued to observe them in his retirement to study changes in the moth population.

Sheppard married Patricia Beatrice Lee in 1948.  They had three sons. He died of acute [[leukemia]] on 17 October 1976.

'''Political [[forecasting]]''' aims at predicting the outcome of elections.

== History ==
People have long been interested in predicting election outcomes. Quotes of betting odds on [[Pope|papal succession]] appear as early as 1503, when such wagering was already considered “an old practice.”&lt;ref&gt;Frederic J. Baumgartner. ''Behind Locked Doors: A History of Papal Elections''. New York, Palgrave, 2003 (pages 88 and 250).&lt;/ref&gt; Political betting also has a long history in Great Britain. As one prominent example, Charles James Fox, the late-eighteenth-century Whig statesman, was known as an inveterate gambler. His biographer, George Otto Trevelyan, noted that“(f)or ten years, from 1771 onwards, Charles Fox betted frequently, largely, and judiciously, on the social and political occurrences of the time.”&lt;ref&gt;George Otto Trevelyan. ''The Early History of Charles James Fox''. New York, Harper &amp; Brothers, 1880 (page 416).&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the advent of scientific polling in 1936, betting odds in the [[United States]] correlated strongly to vote results.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Erikson and Christopher Wlezien. ''Markets vs. polls as election predictors: An historical assessment''. Electoral Studies 31 (2012) 532–539. Elsevier, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1936, [[opinion poll]]s have been a basic part of political forecasting. More recently, [[prediction market]]s have been formed, starting in 1988 with [[Iowa Electronic Markets]].

With the advent of statistical techniques, electoral data have become increasingly easy to handle. It is no surprise, then, that election forecasting has become a big business, for polling firms, news organizations, and betting markets as well as academic students of politics.&lt;ref name ="ef"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199756223/obo-9780199756223-0023.xml|title= Election forecasting|last1= Stegmaier|first1= Mary|last2= Norpoth|first2= Helmut|date= 2013-09-30|access-date=2016-09-26|doi =10.1093/obo/9780199756223-0023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic scholars have constructed models of voting behavior to forecast the outcomes of elections. These forecasts are derived from theories and empirical evidence about what matters to voters when they make electoral choices. The forecast models typically rely on a few predictors in highly aggregated form, with an emphasis on phenomena that change in the short-run, such as the state of the economy, so as to offer maximum leverage for predicting the result of a specific election.&lt;ref name = "ef"/&gt;

An early successful model which is still being used is [[The Keys to the White House]] by [[Allan Lichtman]]. Election forecasting in the United States was first brought to the attention of the wider public by [[Nate Silver]] and his [[FiveThirtyEight]] website in [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]]. Currently, there are many competing models trying to predict the outcome of elections in the United States, the [[United Kingdom]], and elsewhere.

== Methods ==
===Averaging polls===

Combining poll data lowers the forecasting mistakes of a poll.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred G. Cuzan, J. Scott Armstrong, and Randall Jones, [http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/PollyVote/index.php/pollys-archive/polly-2004.html "Combining Methods to Forecast the 2004 Presidential Election: The PollyVote"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130123102051/http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/PollyVote/index.php/pollys-archive/polly-2004.html |date=2013-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Political forecasting models include averaged poll results, such as the [[RealClearPolitics]] poll average.

===Poll damping===

Poll damping is when incorrect indicators of public opinion are not used in a forecast model. For instance, early in the campaign, polls are poor measures of the future choices of voters. The poll results closer to an election are a more accurate prediction.  Campbell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=James E.|title=Polls and Votes|journal=American Politics Quarterly|date=October 1996|volume=24|issue=4|pages=408–433|doi=10.1177/1532673X9602400402|url=http://apr.sagepub.com/content/24/4/408.abstract|accessdate=11 June 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the power of poll damping in political forecasting.

===Nomenclature===

When discussing the likelihood of a particular electoral outcome, political forecasters tend to use one of a small range of shorthand phrases.&lt;ref name="rollcall"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://media.cq.com/electionguide/|title=Election Guide 2018|publisher=Roll Call Politics|accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cook"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings|title=2018 Senate Race Ratings|date=24 August 2018|publisher=[[Cook Political Report]]|accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/08/17/here-are-the-house-seats-most-likely-to-flip-according-to-election-rating-systems/|title=Here are the House seats most likely to flip, according to election rating systems|last=Bump|first=Philip|date=17 August 2018|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These include:

*'''Solid''' (e.g., "Solid Republican"), also '''Safe'''.  Very unlikely that the party which currently holds the seat will change in the upcoming election.
*'''Likely''' (e.g., "Likely Democrat"), also '''Favored'''.  It is not thought at the moment that the seat will be particularly competitive, and hence the party is likely to remain unchanged, but there is a possibility this may alter. 
*'''Lean''' (e.g., "Leans Independent"). One candidate / party has a slight advantage in polling and forecasting, but other outcomes are possible.
*'''Tilt'''.  Used less widely than the other terms, but indicates a very small advantage to one or another party.&lt;ref name="rollcall"/&gt;
*'''Toss-Up'''. These are the seats that are considered to be the most competitive, with more than one party having a good chance of winning.

== Markets ==
[[Prediction market]]s show very accurate forecasts of an election outcome. One example is the [[Iowa Electronic Markets]]. In a study, 964 election polls were compared with the five US presidential elections from 1988 to 2004. [http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/faculty/trietz/papers/long%20run%20accuracy.pdf Berg et al. (2008)] showed that the Iowa Electronic Markets topped the polls 74% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/faculty/trietz/papers/long%20run%20accuracy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, damped polls have been shown to top prediction markets. Comparing damped polls to forecasts of the Iowa Electronic Markets, [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090725101900/http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/Political/PDFs/EriksonWlezien_Markets_AAPOR_for_POLLY.pdf Erikson and Wlezien (2008)] showed that the damped polls outperform all markets or models.

== Regression models ==
Political scientists and economists oftentimes use [[regression analysis|regression models]] of past elections. This is done to help forecast the votes of the political parties – for example, Democrats and Republicans in the US. The information helps their party’s next presidential candidate forecast the future. Most models include at least one public opinion variable, a trial heat poll, or a presidential approval rating.
Bayesian statistics can also be used to estimate the posterior distributions of the true proportion of voters that will vote for each candidate in each state, given both the polling data available and the previous election results for each state.  Each poll can be weighted based on its age and its size, providing a highly dynamic forecasting mechanism as Election day approaches.   http://electionanalytics.cs.illinois.edu/ is an example of a site that employs such methods.&lt;ref&gt;1.	Rigdon, S., Jacobson, S.H., Cho, W.T., Sewell, E.C., Rigdon, C.J., 2009, “A Bayesian Prediction Model for the United States Presidential Election,” American Politics Research, 37(4), 700-724.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SummaryDiagramVertical.png|frame|right|The transition of [[communication technology]]: [[oral culture]], [[manuscript culture]], print culture, and [[Information Age]]]]
'''Print culture''' embodies all forms of printed text and other printed forms of [[visual communication]]. One prominent scholar in the field is [[Elizabeth Eisenstein]], who contrasted print culture, which appeared in Europe in the centuries after the advent of the Western [[printing-press]] (and much earlier in China where [[woodblock printing]] was used from 594 AD), to ''scribal culture''. [[Walter Ong]], by contrast, has contrasted written culture, including scribal, to [[oral culture]]. Ong is generally considered one of the first scholars to define print culture in contrast to [[oral culture]].  These views are related as the printing press brought a vast rise in literacy, so that one of its effects was simply the great expansion of written culture at the expense of oral culture.  The development of [[printing]], like the development of [[writing]] itself, had profound effects on human societies and knowledge. "Print culture" refers to the cultural products of the printing transformation.

In terms of image-based communication, a similar transformation came in Europe from the fifteenth century on with the introduction of the [[old master print]] and, slightly later, [[popular prints]], both of which were actually much quicker in reaching the mass of the population than printed text.

Print culture is the conglomeration of effects on human society that is created by making printed forms of communication. Print culture encompasses many stages as it has evolved in response to technological advances. Print culture can first be studied from the period of time involving the gradual movement from oration to script as it is the basis for print culture. As the printing became commonplace, script became insufficient and printed documents were [[mass production|mass-produced]]. The era of physical print has had a lasting effect on human culture, but with the advent of digital text, some scholars believe the printed word is becoming obsolete.

The [[electronic media]], including the [[World Wide Web]], can be seen as an outgrowth of print culture.

== The development of print ==

===Prior to print===
[[Oral culture]] was all that existed. Oral culture gradually found the need to store what was said for long periods of time, and slowly developed scribal culture. Scribal culture being inaccurate and tedious at best developed into print culture. Each segment is rich with its own effects on the world. Scribal culture, defined by the written or physical conveying of ideas, is important to understand in achieving a grasp on the unfolding of print culture itself. Scholars disagree over when scribal culture developed. [[Walter Ong]] argues that scribal culture cannot exist until an alphabet is created, and a form of writing standardized. On the other hand, [[D. F. McKenzie]] argues that even communicative notches on a stick, or structure, represent “text”, and therefore scribal culture.

Ong suggests scribal culture is defined by an alphabet. McKenzie says that the key to scribal culture is non-verbal communication, which can be accomplished in more ways than using an alphabet. These two views give rise to the importance of print culture. In scribal culture, procuring documents was a difficult task, and documentation would then be limited to the rich only. Ideas are difficult to spread amongst large groups of people over large distances of land, not allowing for effective dissemination of knowledge.

Scribal culture also deals with large levels of inconsistency. It was always considered that the oldest document was the most accurate, as it had been copied the least. In the process of copying documents, many times the meaning became changed, and the words different. Reliance on the written text of the time was never exceedingly strong. Over time, a greater need for reliable, quickly reproduced, and a relatively inexpensive means of distributing written text arose. Scribal culture, transforming into print culture, was only replicated in manners of written text.

===Development of print===
[[Image:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The intricate frontispiece of the Diamond Sutra from [[Tang Dynasty]] [[China]], 868 AD ([[British Museum]])]] 
The Chinese invention of [[paper]] and [[woodblock printing]], at some point before the first dated [[book]] in 868 (the [[Diamond Sutra]]) produced the world's first print culture.&lt;ref&gt;A Hyatt Mayor, Prints and People, Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, nos 1-4. {{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of thousands of [[books]], on subjects ranging from [[Confucian|Confusion Classics]] to [[science]] and [[mathematics]], were printed using [[woodblock printing]].

[[Paper]] and [[woodblock printing]] were introduced into Europe in the 15th Century, and the first printed [[book]]s began appearing in Europe. Chinese movable type was spread to Korea during the [[Goryeo Dynasty]]. Around 1230, Koreans invented a metal type movable printing which was described by the French scholar Henri-Jean Martin as "extremely similar to Gutenberg's".&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter (2002) A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet, Polity, Cambridge, pp.15-23, 61-73.&lt;/ref&gt; East metal movable type was spread to Europe between the late 14th century and early 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Polenz, Peter von. |title = Deutsche Sprachgeschichte vom Spätmittelalter bis zur Gegenwart: I.

S. Stavrianos]] |title=A Global History: From Prehistory to the 21st Century |edition=7th |year=1998 |origyear=1970 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-13-923897-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of [[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s [[printing press]] (circa 1450) greatly reduced the amount of labor required to produce a book leading to a tremendous increase in the number of books produced. Early printers tried to keep their printed copies of a text as faithful as possible to the original manuscript. Even so, the earliest publications were still often different from the original, for a short time, in some ways [[manuscript]]s still remaining more accurate than printed books.

Hand-copied illustrations were replaced by first [[woodcut]]s, later [[engraving]]s that could be duplicated precisely, revolutionizing technical literature (Eisenstein 155).

== Print culture, the Renaissance, and the Reformation ==
Eisenstein has described how the high costs of copying scribal works often led to their abandonment and eventual destruction.  Furthermore, the cost and time of copying led to the slow propagation of ideas. In contrast, the printing press allowed rapid propagation of ideas, resulting in knowledge and cultural movements that were far harder to destroy.

Eisenstein points to prior renaissances (rebirths) of classical learning prior to the printing press that failed.  In contrast, the Renaissance was a permanent revival of classical learning because the printing of classical works put them into a permanent and widely read form.

Similarly, Eisenstein points to a large number of prior attempts in Western Europe to assert doctrines contrary to the ruling Catholic Church.  In contrast, the [[Protestant Reformation]] spread rapidly and permanently due to the printing of non-conformist works such as the [[95 Theses]].

===Renaissance===
With the shift towards printing presses in the West, after [[Johannes Gutenberg]] developed a method that was cheap, fast, and filling the demand for books, the Renaissance truly came into its own.  Even though the printing press was a paradigm shifting invention, printing had many critics, who were afraid that books could spread lies and subversion or corrupt unsuspecting readers.  Also, they were afraid that the printed texts would spread heresy and sow religious discord.  The [[Gutenberg Bible]] was the first book produced with moveable type in Europe.  Martin Luther's Bible, which was published in German in 1522, started the [[Protestant Reformation]].  Latin's importance as a language started languishing with the rise of texts written in national languages.  The shift from scholarly Latin to everyday languages marked an important turning point in print culture.  The vernacular Bibles were important to other nations, as well.  The [[Authorized King James Version|King James]] Authorized Version was published in 1611, for example.  Along with the religious tracts, the scientific revolution was largely due to the printing press and the new print culture.  Scholarly books were more accessible, and the printing press provided more accurate diagrams and symbols.  Along with scientific texts, like the works of [[Copernicus]],  [[Galileo]], and [[Tycho Brahe]], atlases and cartography started taking off within the new print culture, mostly due to the exploration of different nations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn.  Books: A Living History.  Paul Getty Museum, 2011.  Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enlightenment===
With the rise of literacy, books and other texts became more entrenched in the culture of the West.  Along with literacy and more printed words also came censorship, especially from governments.  In France, [[Voltaire]] and [[Rousseau]] were both imprisoned for their works.  Other authors, like [[Montesquieu]] and [[Diderot]], had to publish outside France.  Censored books became a valuable commodity within this environment, and an underground network of book smugglers started operating within France.  Diderot and Jean d'Alembert created the ''[[Encyclopedie]]'', which was published in 1751 in seventeen folio volumes with eleven volumes of engravings.  This work embodied the essence of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn.  Books: A Living History.  Paul Getty Museum, 2011.  Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Print culture and the American Revolution==

===A profound impact===
Numerous eras throughout history have been defined through the use of print culture. The [[American Revolution]] was a major historical conflict fought after print culture brought the rise of literacy. Furthermore, print culture's ability to shape and guide society was a critical component before, during, and after the Revolution.

===Pre-Revolution===
Many different printed documents influenced the beginning of the revolution. The [[Magna Carta]] was originally a scribal document of 1215, recording an oral transaction restricting the power of English kings and defining rights of subjects. It was revitalized by being printed in the 16th century and widely read by the increasingly literate English and colonial population thereafter.  The Magna Carta was used as a basis for the development of English liberties by [[Sir Edward Coke]] and became a basis for writing the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].

Additionally, during the 18th century, the production of printed newspapers in the colonies greatly increased. In 1775, more copies of newspapers were issued in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] than were printed in all of New England in 1754, showing that the existence of the conflict developed a need for print culture. This onslaught of printed text was brought about by the anonymous writings of men such as [[Benjamin Franklin]], who was noted for his many contributions to the newspapers, including the [[Pennsylvania Gazette]]. This increase was primarily due to the easing of the government's tight control of the press, and without the existence of a relatively free press, the American Revolution may have never taken place. The production of so many newspapers can mostly be attributed to the fact that newspapers had a huge demand; printing presses were writing the newspapers to complain about the policies of the British government, and how the British government was taking advantage of the colonists.

In 1775, [[Thomas Paine]] wrote the pamphlet "[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]," a pamphlet that introduced many ideas of freedom to the Colonial citizens. Allegedly, half a million copies were produced during the pre-revolution era. This number of pamphlets produced is significant as there were only a few million freed men in the colonies. However, "Common Sense" was not the only manuscript that influenced people and the tide of the revolution. Among the most influential were [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]]' "Rights of the British Colonies" and  [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]]'s "Farmer's Letters". Both of these played a key role in persuading the people and igniting the revolution.

===During the Revolution===
Newspapers were printed during the revolution covering battle reports and propaganda. These reports were usually falsified by Washington in order to keep morale up among American citizens and troops. Washington was not the only one to falsify these reports, as other generals (on both sides) used this technique as well. The newspapers also covered some of the battles in great detail, especially the ones that the American forces won, in order to gain support from other countries in hopes that they would join the American forces in the fight against the British.

Before the Revolution, the British placed multiple acts upon the colonies, such as the [[stamp act]]. Many newspaper companies worried that the British would punish them for printing papers without a British seal, so they were forced to temporarily discontinue their work or simply change the title of their paper. However, some patriotic publishers, particularly those in Boston, continued their papers without any alteration of their title.

The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] is a very important written document that was drafted by the original thirteen colonies, as a form of print culture that would declare their independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain and explained the justifications for doing so.  While it was explicitly documented on July 4, 1776, it was not recognized by [[Great Britain]] until September 3, 1783, by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]].

===Post-Revolution===
After the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], a cluster of free states in need of a government was created. The basis for this government was known as the [[Articles of Confederation]], which were put to effect in 1778 and formed the first governing document of the United States of America. This document, however, was found to be unsuitable to outline the structure of the government, and thus showed an ineffectual use of print culture, and since printed texts were the most respected documents of the time, this called for an alteration in the document used to govern the confederation.

It was the job of the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] to reform the document, but they soon discovered that an entirely new text was needed in its place. The result was the [[United States Constitution]]. In the form of written word, the new document was used to grant more power to the central government, by expanding into branches. After it was ratified by all of the states in the union, the Constitution served as a redefinition of the modern government.

[[Thomas Jefferson]] was noted as saying, “The basis of our government being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate for a moment to prefer the latter.” This serves as an excellent example of how newspapers were highly regarded by the colonial people. In fact, much like other forms of 18th century print culture, newspapers played a very important role in the government following the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. Not only were they one of the few methods in the 18th century to voice the opinion of the people, they also allowed for the ideas to be disseminated to a wide audience, a primary goal of printed text. A famous example of the newspaper being used as a medium to convey ideas were the [[Federalist Papers]]. These were first published in New York City newspapers in 1788 and pushed for people to accept the idea of the United States Constitution by enumerating 85 different articles that justified its presence, adding to a series of texts designed to reinforce each other, and ultimately serving as a redefinition of the 18th century.

== The state of print today ==
Today, print has matured to a state where the majority of modern society has come to have certain expectations regarding the printed book:
* The knowledge contained by printed books is believed to be accurate.
* The cited author of a printed book does indeed exist and is actually the person who wrote it.
* Every copy of a printed book is identical (at least in the important aspects) to every other copy, no matter how far apart the locations are in which they are sold.

Copyright laws help to protect these standards. However, a few regions do exist in the world where literary [[Copyright infringement|piracy]] has become a standard commercial practice. In such regions, the preceding expectations are not the norm. (Johns 61)

Currently, there are still approximately 2.3 billion books still sold each year worldwide. However, this number is steadily decreasing due to the ever-growing popularity of the [[Internet]] and other forms of digital media.

== Transition to the digital era ==
As David J. Gunkel states in his article "What's the Matter with Books?", society is currently in the late age of the text; the moment of transition from print to electronic culture where it is too late for printed books and yet too early for electronic texts. Jay David Bolter, author of ''Writing Space'', also discusses our culture in what he calls "the late age of print."  The current debate going on in the literary world is whether or not the computer will replace the printed book as the repository and definition of human knowledge. There is still a very large audience committed to printed texts, who are not interested in moving to a digital representation of the repository for human knowledge. Bolter, in his own scholarship and also along with Richard Grusin in ''Remediation'', explains that despite current fears about the end of print, the format will never be erased but only remediated.  New forms of technology (new media) will be created which utilize features of old media, thus preventing old media's (aka print's) erasure.  At the same time, there are also concerns over whether obsolescence and deterioration make digital media unsuitable for long-term archival purposes. Much of the early paper used for print is highly acidic, and will ultimately destroy itself.

The way that information is transferred has also changed with this new age of digital text and the shift towards electronic media. Gunkel states that information now takes the form of immaterial bits of digital data that are circulated at the speed of light. Consequently, what the printed book states about the exciting new culture and economy of bits is abraded by the fact that this information has been delivered in the slow and outdated form of physical paper.

In the article, [http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/%7Eeleclaw/ylj5.html "The First Amendment, Print Culture, and the Electronic Environment"], the author notes that expectations will change as information becomes less tied to specific locations, and as machines become networked and linked to other machines. This means that in the future certain goods will not be associated with their origins.

The article "The First Amendment, Print Culture, and the Electronic Environment" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20060619192001/http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~eleclaw/ylj4.html]) also mentions how the new electronic age will make print better. Placing information into electronic form not only liberates the information from its pages but removes the need for specialized spaces to hold particular kinds of information. People have become increasingly accustomed to acquiring information from our homes that used to be only accessible from an office or library. Once computers are all [[computer networking|networked]], all information should, at least in theory, be accessible from all places. Print itself contained a set of invisible and inherent censors, which [[electronic media]] is helping to remove from the creation of text. Points of control that are present in print space are no longer present as distribution channels multiply, as copying becomes faster and cheaper, as more information is produced, as economic incentives for working with information increase, and as barriers and boundaries that inhibited working with information are crossed.

== Changes in technology and its effect on print culture ==
There are more online publications, [[Academic journal|journals]], [[newspaper]]s, [[magazines]], and businesses than ever before. While this brings society closer, and makes publications more convenient and accessible, ordering a product online reduces contact with others. Many online articles are anonymous, making the '[[death of the author]]' even more apparent. Anyone can post articles and journals online anonymously. In effect, the individual becomes separated from the rest of society.

The advances of technology in print culture can be separated into three shifts: 
*spoken language to the written word, 
*the written word to Printing press, 
*the printing press to the computer/internet.

The written word has made history recordable and accurate.  The printing press, some may argue, is not a part of print culture, but had a substantial impact upon the development of print culture through the times. The printing press brought uniform copies and efficiency in print. It allowed a person to make a living from writing. Most importantly, it spread print throughout society.

The advances made by technology in print also impact anyone using cell phones, laptops, and personal digital organizers. From novels being delivered via a cell phone, the ability to text message and send letters via e-mail clients, to having entire libraries stored on PDAs, print is being influenced by devices.

== Non-textual forms of print culture ==

Symbols, logos and printed images are forms of printed media that do not rely on text. They are ubiquitous in modern urban life. Analyzing these cultural products is an important part of the field of [[cultural studies]].  Print has given rise to a wider distribution of pictures in society in conjunction with the printed word.  Incorporation of printed pictures in magazines, newspapers, and books gave printed material a wider mass appeal through the ease of [[visual culture|visual communication]].

== Text and Print ==

There is a common miscommunication that occurs when discussing that which is
print and that which is text. In the literary world, notable scholars such as
[[Walter Ong]] and [[D.F. McKenzie]] have disagreed on the meaning of text. The
point of the discussion at hand is to have a word that encompasses all forms
of communication - that which is printed, that which is online media, even a
building or notches on a stick.  According to Walter Ong text did not come
about until the development of the first alphabet, well after humanity existed.
According to Mckenzie primitive humans did have a form of text they used to
communicate with their cave drawings.  This is discussed in [[literary theory]]. Print, however, is a representation of that which is printed, and
does not encompass all forms of communication (e.g. a riot at a football game).

'''Public choice''' or '''public choice theory''' is "the use of [[economic]] tools to deal with traditional problems of [[political science]]".&lt;ref name="Tullock2008"&gt;[[Gordon Tullock]], [[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics|[1987]]] 2008, "public choice," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]''. .&lt;/ref&gt; Its content includes the study of [[political behavior]]. In political science, it is the subset of [[positive political theory]] that studies self-interested [[Agent (economics)|agents]] (voters, politicians, bureaucrats) and their interactions, which can be represented in a number of ways – using (for example) standard constrained [[utility]] maximization, [[game theory]], or [[decision theory]].&lt;ref name="Tullock2008"/&gt; Public-c

Buchanan, 1990. "The Domain of Constitutional Economics," ''Constitutional Political Economy'', 1(1), pp. [http://www.walkerd.people.cofc.edu/400/Sobel/2A-8.%20Buchanan%20-%20Constitutional%20Economics.pdf 1–18].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Compare: [[Dennis C.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and development==
A precursor of modern public choice theory was the work of [[Knut Wicksell]] (1896),&lt;ref&gt;Knut Wicksell (1896 [1958]). "A New Principle of Just Taxation," J.M. Buchanan, trans., in [[Richard A. Musgrave]] and [[Alan T. Peacock]], ed. (1958). ''Classics in the Theory of Public Finance'', Palgrave Macmillan, an essay from Wicksell (1896), ''Finanzthcoretische Untersuchungen'', Jena: Gustav Fischer.&lt;/ref&gt; which treated government as political exchange, a ''[[quid pro quo]]'', in formulating a [[benefit principle]] linking taxes and expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;• [[Dennis C. Mueller]] (1976). "Public Choice: A Survey," ''Journal of Economic Literature'', 14(2), p. 396. [pp. [http://pages.uoregon.edu/cjellis/441/Mueller.pdf 395–433.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019084807/http://pages.uoregon.edu/cjellis/441/Mueller.pdf |date=October 19, 2013 }}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; •  James M. Buchanan(1986). [https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1986/buchanan-lecture.html# "The Constitution of Economic Policy,"] IV. Politics as Exchange &amp; V.

Some subsequent economic analysis has been described as treating government as though it attempted "to maximize some kind sort of welfare function for society" and as distinct from characterizations of [[economic agents]], such as those in business.&lt;ref name="Tullock2008"/&gt; In contrast, public choice theory modeled government as made up of officials who, besides pursuing the public interest, might act to benefit themselves, for example in the [[budget-maximizing model]] of [[bureaucracy]], possibly at the cost of [[Economic efficiency|efficiency.]]&lt;ref name="Tullock2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Niskanen"&gt;William A. Niskanen ([1971] 1994). ''Bureaucracy and Public Economics'', Elgar. Expanded ed.

Modern public-choice theory has been dated from the work of [[Duncan Black]], sometimes called "the founding father of public choice".&lt;ref&gt;Charles K. Rowley (2008). "Duncan Black (1908–1991," ch. 4 in ''Readings in Public Choice and Constitutional Political Economy'', Springer, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3X0HxOHjw8MC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 83.]&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of papers from 1948, which culminated in ''The Theory of Committees and Elections'' (1958),&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Black (1958). ''The Theory of Committees and Elections'', 2nd rev. ed, 1998, Springer. [https://www.springer.com/social+sciences/political+science/book/978-0-7923-8110-5 Description] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=CRdnaPy8oB4C&amp;pg=find&amp;pg=PA1=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; and later, Black outlined a program of unification toward a more general "Theory of Economic and Political Choices" based on common [[Formal logic|formal]] methods,&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Black (1950). "The Unity of Political and Economic Science," ''Economic Journal'', 60(239), pp. 506–14 {{jstor|2226793}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed underlying concepts of what would become [[median voter theory]], and rediscovered earlier works on voting theory.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Black (1948a).

[[Kenneth J. Arrow]]'s ''[[Social Choice and Individual Values]]'' (1951) influenced formulation of the theory. Among other important works are [[Anthony Downs]] (1957)  ''[[An Economic Theory of Democracy]]'' and [[Mancur Olson]] (1965) ''[[The Logic of Collective Action]]''.&lt;ref name="Olson"&gt;Mancur Olson, Jr.  ([1965] 1971). ''The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups'', 2nd ed. Harvard University Press, [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674537514 Description], [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?recid=24500&amp;content=toc Table of Contents], and [https://books.google.com/books?id=jzTeOLtf7_wC&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PA5=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false preview].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James M. Buchanan]] and [[Gordon Tullock]] coauthored ''[[The Calculus of Consent: Logical Foundations of Constitutional Democracy]]'' (1962), considered one of the landmarks in public choice. In particular, the preface describes the book as "about the ''political organization"'' of a free society. But its methodology, conceptual apparatus, and analytics "are derived, essentially, from the discipline that has as its subject the ''economic'' organization of such a society" (1962, p. v). The book focuses on [[positive economics|positive-economic]] analysis as to the development of constitutional democracy but in an ethical context of consent. The consent takes the form of a [[compensation principle]] like [[Pareto efficiency]] for making a policy change and unanimity or at least no opposition as a point of departure for social choice.

Somewhat later, the [[probabilistic voting theory]] started to displace the median voter theory in showing how to find [[Nash equilibria]] in multidimensional space. The theory was later formalized further by Peter Coughlin.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Coughlin (1991). ''Probabilistic Voting Theory'', Cambridge. [http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1136626/?site_locale=en_GB Description] and chapter-preview [https://books.google.com/books?id=eki8mEYLql8C&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PR7=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false links].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision-making processes and the state==
One way to organize the subject matter studied by public choice theorists is to begin with the foundations of the state itself. According to this procedure, the most fundamental subject is the origin of [[government]]. Although some work has been done on [[anarchy]], [[autocracy]], [[revolution]], and even [[war]], the bulk of the study in this area has concerned the fundamental problem of collectively choosing [[constitution|constitutional rules]]. This work assumes a group of individuals who aim to form a government, then it focuses on the problem of hiring the agents required to carry out government functions agreed upon by the members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mueller |first1=D.C. |title=The Encyclopedia of public choice |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |location=Boston, MA |isbn=978-0-306-47828-4 |pages=32–33|date=2008-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Expressive interests" and democratic irrationality==
[[Geoffrey Brennan]] and [[Loren Lomasky]] claim that democratic policy is biased to favor "expressive interests" and neglect practical and [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] considerations. Brennan and Lomasky differentiate between instrumental interests (any kind of practical benefit, both monetary and non-monetary) and expressive interests (forms of expression like applause). According to Brennan and Lomasky, the [[paradox of voting]] can be resolved by differentiating between expressive and instrumental interests.

This argument has led some public choice scholars to claim that politics is plagued by irrationality. In articles published in the ''[[Econ Journal Watch]]'', economist [[Bryan Caplan]] contended that voter choices and government economic decisions are inherently irrational.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econjournalwatch.org/pdf/CaplanCommentApril2005.pdf{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econjournalwatch.org/pdf/CaplanRejoinderAugust2005.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Caplan's ideas are more fully developed in his book ''[[The Myth of the Rational Voter]]'' (Princeton University Press 2007). Countering [[Donald Wittman]]'s arguments in ''The Myth of Democratic Failure'', Caplan claims that politics is biased in favor of irrational beliefs.

According to Caplan, democracy effectively subsidizes irrational beliefs. Anyone who derives utility from potentially irrational policies like [[protectionism]] can receive private benefits while imposing the costs of such beliefs on the general public. Were people to bear the full costs of their "irrational beliefs", they would lobby for them optimally, taking into account both their instrumental consequences and their expressive appeal. Instead, democracy oversupplies policies based on irrational beliefs. Caplan defines rationality mainly in terms of mainstream price theory, pointing out that mainstream economists tend to oppose protectionism and government regulation more than the general population, and that more educated people are closer to economists on this score, even after controlling for confounding factors such as income, wealth or political affiliation. One criticism is that many economists do not share Caplan's views on the nature of public choice. However, Caplan does have data to support his position. Economists have, in fact, often been frustrated by public opposition to economic reasoning. As [[Sam Peltzman]] puts it: &lt;blockquote&gt;Economists know what steps would improve the efficiency of HSE [health, safety, and environmental] regulation, and they have not been bashful advocates of them. These steps include substituting markets in property rights, such as emission rights, for command and control&amp;nbsp;... The real problem lies deeper than any lack of reform proposals or failure to press them. It is our inability to understand their lack of political appeal.&lt;ref&gt;"George Stigler's Contribution to the Economic Analysis of Regulation" 101 J. Pol. Econ. 818, 830 (October 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Public choice's application to government regulation was developed by [[George Stigler]] (1971) and Sam Peltzman (1976).

=={{anchor|interests}}Special interests==
Public choice theory is often used to explain how political decision-making results in outcomes that conflict with the preferences of the general public. For example, many [[advocacy group]] and [[pork barrel]] projects are not the desire of the overall [[democracy]]. However, it makes sense for politicians to support these projects. It may make them feel powerful and important. It can also benefit them financially by opening the door to future wealth as [[lobbyists]]. The project may be of interest to the politician's local [[constituency]], increasing district votes or [[campaign finance|campaign contributions]]. The politician pays little or no cost to gain these benefits, as he is spending public money. Special-interest lobbyists are also behaving rationally. They can gain government favors worth millions or billions for relatively small investments. They face a risk of losing out to their competitors if they don't seek these favors. The taxpayer is also behaving rationally. The cost of defeating any one government give-away is very high, while the benefits to the individual taxpayer are very small. Each citizen pays only a few pennies or a few dollars for any given government favor, while the costs of ending that favor would be many times higher. Everyone involved has rational incentives to do exactly what they are doing, even though the desire of the general constituency is opposite. Costs are diffused, while benefits are concentrated. The voices of vocal minorities with much to gain are heard over those of indifferent majorities with little to individually lose.&lt;ref name="Specialinterests"&gt;• William C.

Something must incite those preyed upon to resist even the best organized concentrated interests. In his article on interest groups Gary Becker identified this countervailing force as being the deadweight loss from predation. His views capped what has come to be known as the [[Chicago school of political economy]] and it has come in sharp conflict with the so-called Virginia faction of public choice due to its assertion that politics will tend towards efficiency due to nonlinear deadweight losses and due to its claim that political efficiency renders policy advice irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;A Better Kind of Violence: The Chicago School of Political Economy, Public Choice, and The Quest for an Ultimate Theory of Power. Cooper-Wolfling Press, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

While good government tends to be a pure [[public good]] for the mass of voters, there may be many [[advocacy groups]] that have strong incentives for [[lobbying]] the government to implement specific policies that would benefit them, potentially at the expense of the general public. For example, lobbying by the sugar manufacturers might result in an inefficient [[subsidy]] for the production of sugar, either direct or by [[protectionist]] measures. The costs of such inefficient policies are dispersed over all citizens, and therefore unnoticeable to each individual. On the other hand, the benefits are shared by a small special-interest group with a strong incentive to perpetuate the policy by further lobbying. Due to [[rational ignorance]], the vast majority of voters will be unaware of the effort; in fact, although voters may be aware of special-interest lobbying efforts, this may merely select for policies which are even harder to evaluate by the general public, rather than improving their overall efficiency. Even if the public were able to evaluate policy proposals effectively, they would find it infeasible to engage in [[collective action]] in order to defend their diffuse interest. Therefore, theorists expect that numerous special interests will be able to successfully lobby for various inefficient policies. In public choice theory, such scenarios of inefficient government policies are referred to as ''[[government failure]]''  – a term akin to ''[[market failure]]'' from earlier theoretical [[welfare economics]].&lt;ref name="Specialinterests"/&gt;

==Rent-seeking==
A field that is closely related to public choice is the study of [[rent-seeking]]. This field combines the study of a market economy with that of government. Thus, one might regard it as a [[new political economy]]. Its basic thesis is that when both a market economy and government are present, government agents provide numerous special market privileges. Both the government agents and self-interested market participants seek these privileges in order to partake in the resulting monopoly rent. Rentiers gain benefits above what the market would have offered, but in the process allocate resources in sub-optimal fashion from a societal point of view.

Rent-seeking is broader than public choice in that it applies to autocracies as well as democracies and, therefore, is not directly concerned with collective decision making. However, the obvious pressures it exerts on legislators, executives, bureaucrats, and even judges are factors that public choice theory must account for in its analysis of collective decision-making rules and institutions. Moreover, the members of a collective who are planning a government would be wise to take prospective rent-seeking into account.&lt;ref name="Rentseeking"/&gt;

Another major claim is that much of political activity is a form of rent-seeking which wastes resources. [[Gordon Tullock]], [[Jagdish Bhagwati]], and [[Anne Osborn Krueger]] have argued that rent-seeking has caused considerable waste.&lt;ref name="Rentseeking"/&gt; In a parallel line of research Fred McChesney claims that rent extraction causes considerable waste, especially in the developing world. As the term implies, rent extraction happens when officials use threats to extort payments from private parties.

==Bureaucracy==
Another major sub-field is the study of [[bureaucracy]]. The usual model depicts the top bureaucrats as being chosen by the chief executive and legislature, depending on whether the democratic system is [[presidential system|presidential]] or [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]]. The typical image of a bureau chief is a person on a fixed salary who is concerned with pleasing those who appointed him or her. The latter have the power to hire and fire him or her more or less at will. The bulk of the [[bureaucrats]], however, are civil servants whose jobs and pay are protected by a civil service system against major changes by their appointed bureau chiefs. This image is often compared with that of a business owner whose profit varies with the success of production and sales, who aims to maximize profit, and who can in an ideal system [[At-will employment|hire and fire employees at will]].&lt;ref name="Niskanen" /&gt; [[William Niskanen]] is generally considered the founder of public choice literature on the [[bureaucracy]].&lt;ref name="Niskanen"/&gt;

==Political stance==
From such results it is sometimes asserted that public choice theory has an anti-state tilt. But there is ideological diversity among public choice theorists. [[Mancur Olson]] for example was an advocate of a strong state and instead opposed political [[interest group]] lobbying.&lt;ref name="Olson"/&gt; More generally, James Buchanan has suggested that public choice theory be interpreted as "politics without romance", a critical approach to a pervasive earlier notion of idealized politics set against market failure.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The British journalist, [[Alistair Cooke]], commenting on the Nobel Prize awarded to [[James M. Buchanan]] in 1986, reportedly summarized the public choice view of politicians by saying, "Public choice embodies the homely but important truth that politicians are, after all, no less selfish than the rest of us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast | url= http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2015/11/michael_munger_2.html | title= Michael Munger on EconTalk's 500th Episode | website= EconTalk.org | publisher= Library of Economics and Liberty | host= Russ Roberts | date= 23 November 2015 | access-date= 22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
Several notable public choice scholars have been awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]], including [[James M. Buchanan]] (1986), [[George Stigler]] (1982), [[Gary Becker]] (1992), [[Vernon L. Smith|Vernon Smith]] (2002) and [[Elinor Ostrom]] (2009). In addition, James Buchanan, Vernon Smith, and Elinor Ostrom were former presidents of the Public Choice Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://publicchoicesociety.org/about | title=About}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==

Buchanan and Tullock themselves outline methodological qualifications of the approach developed in their work ''[[The Calculus of Consent]]'' (1962), p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=skAQQU6Vc6AC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 30]:
:[E]ven if the model [with its rational self-interest assumptions] proves to be useful in explaining an important element of politics, it does not imply that all individuals act in accordance with the behavioral assumption made or that any one individual acts in this way at all times&amp;nbsp;... the theory of collective choice can explain only some undetermined fraction of collective action. However, so long as some part of all individual behavior&amp;nbsp;... is, in fact, motivated by utility maximization, and so long as the identification of the individual with the group does not extend to the point of making all individual utility functions identical, an economic-individualist model of political activity should be of some positive worth.

'''''Science in Action''''' is a long-running weekly radio programme produced by the [[BBC World Service]] and currently hosted by British journalists Roland Pease&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://journalisted.com/roland-pease |title=Roland Pease |publisher=Media Standards Trust|website=journa''listed'' |language=en |access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Marnie Chesterton, and scientist and broadcaster Professor [[Adam Hart]]. It is broadcast on Thursdays at 18.32 [[GMT]] and repeated twice the following day, at 01.32 and 08.32.

A programme with the title ''Science in Action'' is believed to have begun life in 1964, when it replaced an earlier series, dating from the 1950s, called ''Science and Industry''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; From September 1965 a short-lived series called ''Science in Action'' ran on the [[BBC Home Service|Home Service]]; it was broadcast at 19.30 on Thursdays, later 21.30. In December 1965 it was moved to 14.30 on Fridays. The present weekly World Service series, also called ''Science in Action'', began on Saturday 7 July 1979.

'''''Significant Figures: The Lives and Work of Great Mathematicians''''' is a 2017 nonfiction book by British author [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]], published by [[Basic Books]]. In the work, Stewart discusses the lives and contributions of 25 figures who are prominent in the history of mathematics.

==Reception==
In ''Kirkus Reviews'', it was written that "even a popularizer as skilled and prolific as Stewart cannot expect general readers to fully digest his highly distilled explanations of what these significant figures did to resolve ever more complex conundrums as math advanced." However, the reviewer praised Stewart's sketches of the lives and times of the innovators. The book was described as "a text for teachers, precocious students, and intellectually curious readers unafraid to tread unfamiliar territory".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/ian-stewart/significant-figures/|title=SIGNIFICANT FIGURES by Ian Stewart {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sperm precedence''', also known as '''sperm predominance''', is tendency of a female who has been bred by multiple males to give birth to their offspring in unequal proportions. Sperm precedence is an important factor in the [[sperm competition]].

Sperm precedence can be temporal, favoring either the first or last male to breed the female. (The former is known as ''first sperm precedence'' and the latter is known as ''last sperm precedence''); or it can favor the male whose sperm [[sperm motility|are the most motile]]; or the male whose sperm were delivered closest to the female's [[Ovum|ova]].

'''TRIAD Berlin''' is a German [[exhibition design]] firm based in [[Berlin]] with an office in [[Shanghai]]. The agency is best known for the development of two major sports museums: the [[German Football Museum]] in [[Dortmund]] and the [[FIFA World Football Museum]] in [[Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dw.com/en/football-in-museums/av-19083717 |title=Football in museums|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=6 March 2016|accessdate=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
[[File:Expo 2010 Shanghai, Urban Planet Pavilion.jpg|thumb|''Urban Planet'' pavilion, Expo 2010 Shanghai]]
The Berlin agency was founded in 1994 by Lutz Engelke to realize the exhibition ''The Dream of Vision – Age of Televisions'' at [[Gasometer Oberhausen]] in the city of [[Oberhausen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/themen/koepfe/triad-berlin-eine-agentur-mit-der-besonderen-dna/12526828.html|title=Eine Agentur mit der besonderen DNA|publisher=[[Der Tagesspiegel]]|date=1 November 2015|access-date=2018-03-16|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; After designing the theme pavilion ''[[Expo 2010 pavilions#Urban Planet Pavilion|Urban Planet]]'' at [[Expo 2010]], the company also has an additional permanent office in Shanghai, [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2010-11/02/content_11489135.htm |title=How to build cities with character|publisher=[[China Daily]]|date=2 November 2010|accessdate=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency focusses on spatial communication and sees itself as a ''Think &amp; Do Tank''. Its main goal is to turn complex ideas into tangible experiences. Although the content of the projects varies, the method used for their development is always the same: the creation of stories that can be experienced from abstract ideas. A key component of this process is the development of a narrative that structures the messages and guides the visitor through the exhibition. Most of the times, the [[storytelling]] is enhanced by digital media. TRIAD exhibitions rely heavily on digital interactive exhibits with the intention of bridging the gap between the intellectual learning process and the physical experience. In many cases, TRIAD combines education and entertainment in a multimedia space. The result is the so-called [[Educational entertainment|edutainment]], whose goal is to educate through entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Engelke/Osswald, 2017, p. 964.&lt;/ref&gt;

TRIAD has applied edutainment concepts to various projects focused on children's education, such as the 2018 exhibition on the [[MS Wissenschaft]] about working life of the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ms-wissenschaft.de/english/ |title=MS Wissenschaft – The Floating Science Center|accessdate=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, the company has used this approach in the [[Brandenburg Gate Museum]] in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/emotionen-am-tor-the-gate-zeigt-stadtgeschichte-in-einer-multimedia-show/13511474.html|title="The Gate" zeigt Stadtgeschichte in einer Multimedia-Show|access-date=2017-03-01|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is also tackling other challenges that exhibitions face today, like the creation of barrier-free museums. An example of this is the exhibition ''Wilderness Dreams'' in [[Eifel National Park]] which is part of the [[United Nations Decade on Biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.undekade-biologischevielfalt.de/projekte/aktuelle-projekte-beitraege/detail/projekt-details/show/Wettbewerb/1863/?cHash=59202f3f0faf587a430c6400f5b54774&amp;L=0 |title=„Wildnis(t)räume im Nationalpark-Zentrum Eifel|accessdate=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] '''Thomas Hans Orde-Lees''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|AFC]] (23 May 1877 – 1 December 1958) was a member of Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] of 1914&amp;ndash;1917, a pioneer in the field of [[parachuting]], and was one of the first non-Japanese-born men known to have climbed [[Mount Fuji]] during the winter.

==Early life==

Thomas Hans Orde-Lees was born on 23 May 1877, officially during his parents' holiday in [[Aachen]] in what was then [[Prussia]]. In fact he was the illegitimate child of Thomas Orde Hastings Lees, a former [[barrister]] and the [[Chief constable]] of [[Northampton]], and Ada Mary Pattenden (1852–1932), a daughter of the Reverend Canon George Edwin Pattenden, headmaster of Boston Grammar School. Ada was sent off to Thomas' brother's house in Aachen for the birth.

The Lees family was well off; they lived in the Northampton Chief Constable's house with a number of servants. Thomas the Elder's wife, Grace Lees (née Bateman), agreed to bring up young Thomas as her own.  She was made godmother of Ada's nephew Frederick Geoffrey Lees Johnson (1880–1951), an arrangement that provided cover for Grace, Ada and Thomas the Elder to meet up regularly. Ada married Arthur John Coleridge Mackarness, a solicitor, (son of [[John Mackarness|John Fielder Mackarness]], [[Bishop of Oxford]]) in 1890. Following the death of Thomas the Elder in 1924, Grace took up residence with Arthur and Ada Mackarness at Petersfield. Thomas the Younger kept up with his biological mother until her death in 1932.

Orde-Lees was educated at [[Marlborough College]], the [[Burney's Academy|Royal Naval Academy]] at [[Gosport]] (whose headmaster was Ada's brother-in-law, Frederick George Johnson) and the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]]. He joined the [[Royal Marines]], and was commissioned a [[second lieutenant]] in 1895, with promotion to [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] on 1 July 1896,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=26769|page=4694|date=18 August 1896}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] on 16 April 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27444 |date=20 June 1902|page=4050}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900 he was posted to [[China]] and saw action during the [[Boxer Rebellion]].

==Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition==
In 1910 Orde-Lees applied for a place on [[Robert Falcon Scott|Scott]]'s [[Terra Nova Expedition]], but was turned down. When  Shackleton was organizing the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition he decided that he needed a representative from the [[Royal Navy]] in order to get political and military support for the expedition. Orde-Lees as a skier and motor expert fitted the bill, and after Shackleton applied to Churchill for permission, Orde-Lees was released from his military duties and allowed to join the expedition as storekeeper.

On board ship he proved unpopular with the rest of the crew &amp;mdash; he had a surly, condescending manner and was undisguisedly lazy. Nevertheless, he was an efficient storekeeper. He had a keen interest in physical fitness and took his bicycle on the expedition; after the ship became trapped in the ice he frequently took cycling trips on the ice. Shackleton ordered him not to leave the ship unaccompanied after he became lost while searching for food, and encountered a fierce [[leopard seal]]. His cries brought Frank Wild (second in command) out of his tent, who shot the leopard seal at a distance of 10m (30 ft) from Orde-Lees.

When the ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]'' was crushed by pack ice, Shackleton took the three lifeboats and led the men over the ice to open water where they used the boats to travel to [[Elephant Island]]. Orde-Lees was assigned to the ''Dudley Docker'' under the command of [[Frank Worsley]] but failed to pitch in with the other men when a gale threatened to sink the small craft. Despite orders from Worsley, he climbed into his sleeping bag rather than helping with the rowing, although he immediately undertook strenuous and prolonged bailing duty when it looked as if the boat was going to sink.

Once the boats had arrived at Elephant Island, Shackleton and five men set out for [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands#South Georgia group|South Georgia]] in the ''[[Voyage of the James Caird|James Caird]]'' to fetch help. The remaining men, including Orde-Lees, were to spend months living in the remaining two boats, overturned and reinforced with stones and lit by blubber lamps. They were finally rescued on 30 August 1916. For his part in the expedition Orde-Lees received the Silver [[Polar Medal]].

==After the expedition==

===Parachutist===
On Orde-Lees' return to England, World War I was raging. By now an honorary major, Orde-Lees returned to active service with the Royal Marines on 12 November 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29835|page=11409|date=24 November 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://livesofthefirstworldwar.org/lifestory/6904570 "Lifestory of Lieutenant Colonel (Retd.) Thomas Orde Hans Lees at Lives of the First World War"]&lt;/ref&gt; After serving on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in the [[Union Army Balloon Corps|Balloon Corps]], Orde-Lees, with the assistance of Shackleton, secured a place in the [[Royal Flying Corps]] on 1 August 1917 where he became an enthusiastic advocate for the use of [[parachute]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30216|page=7915|date=3 August 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; He jumped from [[Tower Bridge]] into the [[River Thames]] to prove their effectiveness&lt;ref name=ant2005&gt;[http://www.antarctic.org.nz/pdf/Antarctic/Antarctic.V23.4.2005.pdf], page 68, "The Journal of the New Zealand Antarctic Society" Vol 23, No. 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and a Parachute Committee was formed with Orde-Lees as secretary to investigate the use of parachutes for pilots.&lt;ref name=ant2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/documents/Research/RAF-Historical-Society-Journals/Journal-37-Seminar-Flight%20Safety.pdf "ROYAL AIR FORCE HISTORICAL SOCIETY JOURNAL, #37"], 2006, Page 28&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]] in the [[1919 New Year Honours]] list,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31098|supp=y|page=97|date=31 December 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) on 10 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31592|supp=y|page=12526|date=7 October 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, however, Orde-Lees resigned his commission on 25 April 1919&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31327|page=5652|date=6 May 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; (reportedly rather than facing a [[Court-martial|Court Martial]] after his involvement with a parachuting course for women sponsored by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'') and moved to Japan where he taught parachuting techniques to the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force|Japanese Air Force]].

===Japan: Mount Fuji===
In Japan, Orde-Lees is best known for his winter climbs on Mount Fuji.  After an unsuccessful  attempt in January 1922, Orde-Lees and a climbing companion, H.S. Crisp, successfully summitted the iconic stratovolcano on 12 February 1922.&lt;ref name="Mountains"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://onehundredmountains.blogspot.com/2009_11_01_archive.html |title=One Hundred Mountains: On and Around Fukada Kyūya's Nihon Hyakumeizan |work=One Hundred Mountains |accessdate=3 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
After his parachute-training duties ceased, Orde-Lees continued to live in [[Tokyo]].  He worked for a time as a correspondent for ''[[The Times]]'', which led to an appointment at the British Embassy. His first wife having died, he remarried to a local Japanese woman, Hisako Hoya. He spent almost 20 years teaching English and reading the English news on Japanese Radio.

===New Zealand===
When Japan entered [[World War II]] in 1941, Orde-Lees, as a resident alien and citizen of a hostile power, was allowed to leave with his family; they moved to [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]]. There he took a menial job at the New Zealand Correspondence School, although there were rumours that he was working as a [[Espionage|spy]] for the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]]. After the war he wrote a regular children's travel column in the [[Southern Cross Newspaper]] and helped organise the [[Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition]].

He died on 1 December 1958 after being confined to a mental hospital due to his [[dementia]]. He is buried in [[Karori Cemetery]], Wellington, close to fellow ''Endurance'' crew member, [[Harry McNish]].

'''Uhuru''' was the first [[satellite]] launched specifically for the purpose of [[X-ray astronomy]].  It was also known as the '''X-ray Explorer Satellite''', '''SAS-A''' (for "Small Astronomy Satellite" A, being first of the three-spacecraft SAS series), '''SAS 1''', or '''Explorer 42'''. The [[space observatory|observatory]] was launched on December 12, 1970 into an initial orbit of about 560&amp;nbsp;km [[apogee]], 520&amp;nbsp;km [[perigee]], 3 degrees inclination, with a period of 96 minutes. The mission ended in March 1973. Uhuru was a scanning mission, with a spin period of ~12 minutes. It performed the first comprehensive survey of the entire sky for [[X-ray]] sources, with a sensitivity of about 0.001 times the intensity of the Crab nebula.

==Objectives==
The main objectives of the mission were:&lt;ref name=heasarc_about_uhuru&gt;[http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/uhuru/uhuru_about.html  HEASARC "The Uhuru Satellite"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* To survey the sky for cosmic X-ray sources in the 2–20 keV range to a limiting sensitivity of 1.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt; joule/(cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-sec), 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; the flux from the Crab Nebula
* To determine discrete source locations with a precision of a few square minutes of arc for strong sources and a few tenths of a square degree at the sensitivity limit
* To study the structure of extended sources or complex regions with a resolution of about 30 arc minutes
* To determine gross spectral features and variability of X-ray sources
* To perform, wherever possible, coordinated and/or simultaneous observations of X-ray objects with other observers.

==Instrumentation==
The payload consisted of two sets of [[proportional counter]]s, each with ~0.084 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; effective area. 
The counters were sensitive with more than 10% efficiency to X-ray [[photon]]s in the ~2–20 [[keV]] range. 
The lower energy limit was determined by the attenuation of the beryllium windows of the counter plus a thin thermal shroud that was needed to maintain temperature stability of the spacecraft.
The upper energy limit was determined by the transmission properties of the counter filling gas. 
Pulse-shape discrimination and [[Nuclear electronics|anticoincidence]] techniques were used to filter out emissions of particles and undesirable high-energy photons in the background. 
Pulse-height analysis in eight energy channels was used to obtain information on the energy [[Spectroscopy|spectrum]] of the incident photons. 
The two sets of counters were placed back to back and were collimated to 0.52° × 0.52° and 5.2° × 5.2° (full width at half maximum) respectively. 
While the 0.52° detector gave finer angular resolution, the 5.2° detector had higher sensitivity for isolated sources.&lt;ref name=heasarc_about_uhuru/&gt;

==Results==
Uhuru achieved several outstanding scientific advances, including the discovery and detailed study of the pulsing accretion-powered [[X-ray binary|binary X-Ray source]]s such as [[Cen X-3]], [[Vela X-1]], and [[Her X-1]], the identification of [[Cygnus X-1]], the first strong candidate for an astrophysical [[black hole]], and many important extragalactic sources.
The Uhuru Catalog, issued in four successive versions, the last being the 4U catalog, was the first comprehensive X-ray catalog, contains 339 objects and covers the whole sky in the 2—6 keV band.&lt;ref name=4U_catalog&gt;Forman et al. (1978), ApJS, 38, 357.  [http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/uhuru/archive/uhuru_archive.html  HEASARC archive for Uhuru]&lt;/ref&gt;
The final version of the source catalog is known as the 4U Catalog;&lt;ref&gt;[http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/uhuru/uhuru4.html 4U catalog browse version.]&lt;/ref&gt; earlier versions were the 2U and 3U catalogs.  Sources are referenced as, e.g., "[[4U 1700-37]]".

==Naming==
The satellite's name, "Uhuru", is the [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word for "freedom". It was named in recognition of the hospitality of [[Kenya]] from where it was launched, from the  Italian [[San Marco platform|San Marco launch platform]] near Mombasa.

'''''Unus mundus''''', [[Latin]] for "one world", is the concept of an underlying unified reality from which everything emerges and to which everything returns. 

The idea was popularized in the 20th century by the Swiss psychoanalyst [[Carl Gustav Jung]], though the term can be traced back to [[scholastics]] such as [[Duns Scotus]]&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung ed, ''Man and his Symbols'' (1978) p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; and was taken up again in the 16th century by [[Gerhard Dorn]], a student of the famous alchemist [[Paracelsus]].

==Jung and Pauli==
[[File:Unus Mundus according to Jung (en).jpg|Model of unus mundus according to C. G. Jung.|400px|right|thumb]]
Jung, in conjunction with the physicist [[Wolfgang Pauli]], explored the possibility that his concepts of [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]] and [[synchronicity]] might be related to the ''unus mundus'' - the archetype being an expression of ''unus mundus''; synchronicity, or "meaningful coincidence", being made possible by the fact that both the [[Observer (quantum physics)|observer]] and connected [[phenomenon]] ultimately stem from the same source, the ''unus mundus''.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, p. 384-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung was always careful, however, to stress the tentative and provisional nature of such explorations into a unitarian idea of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, p. 384-5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wrinkles in Time''''' is a book on [[cosmology]] by the [[Nobel laureate]] physicist [[George Smoot]] and [[Keay Davidson]], a science writer for the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]''. It was published in 1994 by William Morrow in hardback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Wrinkles-Time-Witness-Birth-Universe/dp/0061344443/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1432367992&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Wrinkles+in+Time|publisher=[[amazon.com]]|title = Wrinkles in Time: Witness to the Birth of the Universe|accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/180.Wrinkles_in_Time?from_search=true&amp;search_version=service_impr|publisher=[[goodreads.com]]|title=Wrinkles in Time|accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
On April 23, 1992, a scientific team led by astrophysicist [[George Smoot]] announced that it had found the primordial "seeds" from which the universe has grown. They analyzed data gathered by NASA's [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] satellite and discovered the oldest known objects in the universe—so called "wrinkles" in time—thus finding a long-anticipated missing piece in the [[Big Bang]] model. In this book, Smoot tells the remarkable tale of his quest for what has been called the cosmologists' Holy Grail. His quest for the seeds of structure in the universe consumed about twenty years. The book traces the obstacle course of discovery. In the book Smoot describes the adventure and along the way he brings the reader up to date in cosmology, giving brief introductions to some important concepts and discoveries in [[physics]] and [[cosmology]].

The research in the book eventually resulted in Smoot winning the 2006 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], and the book was reprinted in 2007 as a result of the new interest generated by the award.  On the cover of the reprint, [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] [[Stephen Hawking]] calls Smoot's observations in the book "the scientific discovery of the century, if not of all time".

The '''yellow-tailed woolly monkey''' (''Oreonax flavicauda'') is a [[New World monkey]] [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Peru]]. It is a rare [[primate]] species found only in the Peruvian [[Andes]], in the departments of [[Amazonas Region|Amazonas]] and [[San Martín Region|San Martin]], as well as bordering areas of [[La Libertad Region|La Libertad]], [[Huánuco]], and [[Loreto Region|Loreto]]. The yellow-tailed woolly monkey was at first classified in the genus ''[[Lagothrix]]'' along with other woolly monkeys, but due to debatable primary sources, they have been placed in ''Oreonax''. ''Oreonax'' has been proposed to be a subgenus of ''Lagothrix'', but others have regarded it as a full genus. A recent extensive study proves that the yellow-tailed woolly monkey may indeed be in ''Lagothrix''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Matthews L, Rosenberger A| last-author-amp = yes| year = 2008 | title = Tavon Combinations, Parsimony Analysis (PAUP*), and the Taxonomy of the Yellow-Tailed Woolly Monkey, Lagothrix flavicauda | journal = American Journal of Physical Anthropology | volume = 137 |pages = 245–255 | doi=10.1002/ajpa.20859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and rediscovery==
The species was first described by [[Alexander von Humboldt]] in 1812 under the name ''Simia flavicauda'', based on a skin found 10 years earlier, used by a local man as a horse saddle. Humboldt had never seen a live animal of this species nor a preserved specimen, and believed it belonged to the genus ''[[Alouatta]]''. For over 100 years, the species was reported on only a few isolated occasions, so was thought to be [[extinct]].

In 1926, three specimens were collected in San Martin, which were then brought to the Museum of Natural History. They were believed to be of a new species, but further evidence made it clear that these specimens were of the yellow-tailed woolly monkey.&lt;ref name="DeLuycer A 2007 41–47"&gt;{{Cite journal| author = DeLuycer A | year = 2007 | title = Notes on the Yellow-tailed Woolly Monkey (''Oreonax flavicauda'') and its Status in the Protected Forest of Alto Mayo, Northern Peru | pages = 41–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, a group of scientists, led by [[Russell Mittermeier]], and funded by [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], found a young yellow-tailed woolly monkey which was kept as a pet in the city of Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Amazonas.&lt;ref&gt;Mittermeier, R.A., Macedo-Ruiz, H. de, Luscombe, B.A.y Cassidy, J. (1977) Rediscovery and conservation of the Peruvian yellow-tailed woolly monkey (Lagothrix flavicauda).&lt;/ref&gt; The rediscovery attracted the attention of national and international press, as well as conservation organizations that saw the need to know quickly the status of this species.

In the summer of 2004, scientists searched for yellow-tailed woolly monkeys in a remote area of San Martin, where the forest is tropical, humid, and quite mountainous. The forest area, threatened due to haphazard tree cutting, was believed to have at least a minor population of the species, and was studied along with two other areas of Peru.&lt;ref name="DeLuycer A 2007 41–47"/&gt;

The loss of habitat due to the tree cutting in the yellow-tailed woolly monkey habitat could prove problematic for the species as a whole. The introduction of farm plots in regions where this organism can be sustained is &lt;!-- drastically --&gt; impacting the yellow-tailed woolly. The farmers of Peru are afraid of losing their farmland to conservation efforts. Farmers said that they did not hunt the monkeys, but that the land is necessary for growing coffee and raising cattle. The balance between avoiding the extinction of the species and maintaining the livelihood of the farmers of Peru is a major issue in the struggle for conservation efforts toward the yellow-tailed woolly monkey.&lt;ref name="DeLuycer A 2007 41–47"/&gt;

==Description==
''Oreonax flavicauda'' is one of the rarest Neotropical primates and is one of Peru's largest endemic mammals. Adult head and body lengths can range from 51.3 to 53.5&amp;nbsp;cm, with tails even longer than the body, up to 63&amp;nbsp;cm (25&amp;nbsp;in). The average weight is 8&amp;nbsp;kg in adults, but some males reach 11.5&amp;nbsp;kg. Peruvian yellow-tailed woolly monkeys are similar in size to the common woolly monkey, also in the genus ''Lagothrix''. They live in large social groups (around 23 individuals) of both male and females. They have low reproductive rates and long interbirth intervals, which adds to their vulnerability for extinction. They are known to express aggressive behaviors upon initial encounters such as branch shaking, “mooning” of the scrotal tuft, and short barking calls. The yellow-tailed woolly monkeys' fur is longer and denser than other woolly monkeys, an adaptation to its cold montane forest habitat.  The monkey's color is deep mahogany and copper with a whitish patch on its snout extending from the chin to between its eyes. Its fur gets darker towards its upper body, making its head seem almost black. It has a powerful prehensile tail, with a hairless patch on its underside and a yellowish pelage on the last third of the tail, giving this species its name. This coloration of the tail is not seen in infants and juveniles. The powerful tail is capable of supporting the animal's entire body weight while feeding or just hanging around; it also uses its tail to help travel through the canopy. The monkey is also known for its long, yellowish, pubic hair tuft. It has the ability to leap 15&amp;nbsp;m (49&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gron|first1=KJ.|date=30 Sep 2010|title=Primate Factsheets: Yellow-tailed woolly monkey (Oreonax flavicauda) Taxonomy, Morphology, &amp; Ecology|url=http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/yellow-tailed_woolly_monkey/taxon|accessdate=15 Apr 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat and distribution==

The yellow-tailed woolly monkey is one of the least known of the primate species.  It is also one of the largest neotropical primates.  They are regularly found in the tropical Andes. Their habitat is characterized as rough terrain consisting of steep mountain sides and deep river gorges, with canopy heights of 20–25 m. Cloud forest, the habitat of this monkey, are in high altitudes and often have cloud coverage near or in them. The last estimated population count was less than 250 individuals.  The current habitat of the yellow-tailed monkey is fragmented due to deforestation, as is the population. This can hinder reproduction, as it limits an already limited population. The Yellow-Tailed monkey has never been subject to a full census so exact numbers vary. A study was done to exam the population however the terrain and fragmented populations made this difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Shanee S, Shanee N, Maldonado A| last-author-amp = yes| year = 2011 | title = Activity budget and behavioural patterns of free-ranging yellow-tailed woolly monkeys Oreonax flavicauda (Mammalia: Primates), at La Esperanza, northeastern Peru | journal = Contributions to Zoology| volume = 1 | pages = 269–277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The yellow-tailed woolly monkey lives in the montane [[cloud forests]] of the Peruvian Andes at elevations of {{convert|1500|-|2700|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level in the departments of Amazonas and San Martin, as well as bordering areas of La Libertad, Huánuco, and Loreto. Its habitat is characterized by steep gorges and ravines. The original extent of its habitat is estimated to be around {{convert|11000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=Leo_thesis&gt;{{cite thesis | author = Leo Luna M | year = 1982 | title = Estudio Preliminar Sobre la Biología y Ecológica del Mono Choro de Cola Amarilla Lagothrix flavicauda (Humboldt, 1812) | degree = Master | publisher = Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina, Lima}}&lt;/ref&gt; but recent estimates put the remaining habitat at between {{convert|6000|and|7000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Buckingham F, Shaneee S | last-author-amp = yes | year = 2009 | url = http://www.primate-sg.org/PDF/PC24_Buckingham.Shanee_O.flavicauda_Peru.pdf | title = Conservation priorities for the Peruvian yellow-tailed woolly monkey (Oreonax flavicauda): a GIS risk assessment and gap análysis | journal = Primate Conservation | issue = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diet and natural history==
Its diet is primarily [[frugivorous]], but leaves, flowers, insects and other invertebrates are also eaten.&lt;ref name="Shanee S, Shanee N &amp; Maldonado AM 2007 115–119"&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Shanee S, Shanee N, Maldonado AM | last-author-amp = yes | year = 2007 | title = Distribution and conservation status of the yellow-tailed woolly monkey Oreonax flavicauda in Amazonas and San Martín, Perú | journal = Neotropical Primates | volume = 14 | pages = 115–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The species is [[arboreal]] and [[diurnality|diurnal]]. It has a multiple-male group social system and a [[polygamous]] mating system. They have a variety of [[Animal communication|vocalisations]], including a loud, "puppy-like" bark which they use as a territorial or alarm call.

Yellow-tailed woolly monkeys participate in geophagy, the consumption of soil. Geophagy is a rare biological behavior, but the species benefits since it results in trace mineral intake of minerals and reduction of intestinal parasites; they tend to suffer from an iron-deficient diet. Their consumption of soil allows them to intake iron that they do not get from their regular diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Ferrari S| author2 = Veiga L| author3 = Urbani Bernardo| last-author-amp = yes | year = 2007 | title = Geophagy in New World Monkeys (Platyrrhini): Ecological and Geographic Patterns | pages = 402–415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
The inaccessibility of its habitat protected the species until the 1950s. However, the construction of new roads, habitat loss and fragmentation from agriculture, logging and cattle ranching, and subsistence hunting, together with the monkey's naturally low population densities, slow maturation, and low reproductive rate, have led to a predicted decline of at least 80% over the next three generations. This and its restricted geographic distribution have led to this species' current critically endangered status.&lt;ref name="Shanee S, Shanee N &amp; Maldonado AM 2007 115–119"/&gt;

Conservation work started soon after the species was rediscovered in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name=Leo_thesis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Leo Luna M | year = 1987 | title = Primate conservation in Peru: a case study of the yellow-tailed woolly monkey | journal = Primate Conservation | issue = 8 | pages = 122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pioneering work by the Peruvian NGO APECO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apeco.org.pe/|title=APECO|work=apeco.org.pe}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to the creation of three protected areas, [[Rio Abiseo National Park]], [[Alto Mayo Protection Forest|Alto Mayo Protected Forest]], and [[Cordillera de Colán National Sanctuary]]. From the mid-1980s until recently, further conservation or research efforts were minimal. Starting in 2007, though, British NGO [[Neotropical Primate Conservation]] has been running conservation initiatives for the species throughout its range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| vauthors = Shanee N, Shanee S | last-author-amp = yes | year = 2010 | url = http://neoprimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/NPC_2nd_year_report.pdf | title = Community Based Conservation for the Yellow Tailed Woolly Monkey, Peru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Shanee N, Shanee S, Maldonado AM | last-author-amp = yes | year = 2007 | url = http://www.socpvs.org/journals/index.php/wbp/article/view/10.2461-wbp.2007.3.9/84 | title = Conservation assessment and planning for the yellow-tailed woolly monkey in Peru | journal = Wildl.

The species is considered one of "[[The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates]]".&lt;ref name="2008-2010Top25"&gt;{{Cite journal| editor1-last = Mittermeier | editor1-first = R.A. | editor2-last = Wallis | editor2-first = J. | editor3-last = Rylands | editor3-first = A.B. | editor4-last = Ganzhorn | editor4-first = J.U. | editor5-last = Oates | editor5-first = J.F. | editor6-last = Williamson | editor6-first = E.A. | editor7-last = Palacios | editor7-first = E. | editor8-last = Heymann | editor8-first = E.W. | editor9-last = Kierulff | editor9-first = M.C.M. | editor10-last = Long | editor10-first = Y. | editor11-last = Supriatna | editor11-first = J. | editor12-last = Roos | editor12-first = C. | editor13-last = Walker | editor13-first = S. | editor14-last = Cortés-Ortiz | editor14-first = L. | editor15-last = Schwitzer | editor15-first = C. | others = Illustrated by S.D.

Habitat loss by deforestation is the biggest threat to the endangerment of yellow-tailed woolly monkeys. The Lima-Tarapoto highway which runs through the regions of San Martin and Amazonas has caused the immigration of people from coastal and high mountain regions leading to overpopulation. Due to the negligence of the regional government of Shipasbamba, Amazonas to the accept requests for conservation efforts, local lands have been the victims of slash-and-burn agriculture by local farmers to support the growing demand of local agricultural crops, as well as to support the increase in population size. With the deforestation and increased population, the monkeys have had their habitat range reduced, which increases their risk of extinction. Conservation efforts led by ASPROCOT have been made recently to help protect the endangered monkeys by turning to alternative forms of agriculture to preserve the remnants of the Amazonas forests. However, a lack of funding has slowed the conservation process.&lt;ref name="Shanee S, Shanee N &amp; Maldonado AM 2007 115–119"/&gt;

Several communities in Peru have made conservation efforts to preserve the yellow-tailed woolly monkeys through various ways. Community-based conservation efforts have been made in preserving the monkeys, such as in Los Chilchos valley, where the project is directed by the Apenheul Primate Conservation Trust. Efforts include preventing further immigration into areas home to the monkeys and beginning ecosystem protection initiatives. Neotropical Primate Conservation has begun using newly constructed roads in La Esperanza to access areas which are now being used to develop ecotourism initiatives to build awareness about the endangered monkey population and its habitat, which has helped local people understand the importance in preserving the monkeys and that the monkeys can be used as a valuable tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Shanee S, Shanee N, Maldonado AM | last-author-amp = yes | year = 2007 | title = Conservation Assessment and Planning for the Yellow-tailed Woolly Money (Oreonax Flavicada) in Peru | journal = Wildl.
