'''Amne Machin''' or '''Anyi Machen''' ({{zh|c=阿尼玛卿|p=Āní Mǎqīng}}, {{bo|t=ཨ་མྱེ་རྨ་ཆེན།|w=a mye rma chen}}, "Grandfather Pomra") is the highest peak of a mountain range of the same name ({{zh|c=阿尼玛卿山|p=Āní Mǎqīng Shān}}) in the province of [[Qinghai]] in west-central [[China]]. It is revered in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] as the home of the chief indigenous deity of [[Amdo]], Machen Pomra.

==Geography==
The entire Amne Machin range is an eastern extension of the [[Kunlun Mountains]], a major mountain system of Asia. The Amne Machin range runs in the general northwest-to-southeast direction in eastern Qinghai ([[Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]] and the adjacent areas of the [[Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]]) and the southwestern corner of [[Gansu]]'s [[Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]].

The existence of the ridge results in one of the great bends of the [[Yellow River]]. The river first flows for several hundreds of kilometers toward the east and southeast, along the south-western side of the Amne Machin Range. In so doing it crosses the entire length of  Golog Prefecture, and reaches the borders of Gansu and Sichuan. Then  the river turns almost 180 degrees to the left, passing to the northeastern side of the Amne Machin, and flows toward the northwest for 200–300&amp;nbsp;km through several prefectures of the northeastern Qinghai.

The Amne Machin Peak (the highest point of the range) is located in [[Maqên County]] of Golog Prefecture. Its elevation is estimated to {{convert|6282|m|ft|0}}. It is ranked number 23 in height among the mountain peaks of China.

A part of the range around its highest peak has been declared a section of the [[Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve|Sanjiangyuan ("Sources of Three Rivers") National Nature Reserve]].

== History ==
[[File:Amnyemachen Gruschke.jpg|thumb|left|The Anye Machin Peak]]
The mountain was known to the [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient Chinese]] as '''Mount Jishi''' ({{lang|zh|積石山}}, {{lang|zh|积石山}}, ''Jīshíshān''). The [[Northern Wei]]-era commentary on the [[Han dynasty|Han]]-era ''River Classic'' stated that the mountain was the site where [[Yu the Great]] tamed the [[Yellow River]] and that it was considered part of [[Longxi Commandery]], located 1740 [[li (unit)|li]] ({{convert|724|km|mi|disp=or|sigfig=3|sp=us|abbr=on}}) from [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Kunlun Mountain]] and 5000 [[li (unit)|li]] ({{convert|2080|km|mi|disp=or|sigfig=3|sp=us|abbr=on}}) from the [[Luo River (Henan)|Luo]].&lt;ref&gt;Theobald, Ulrich. "[http://www.chinaknowledge.de/Literature/Science/shuijingzhu.html ''Shuijingzhu'' {{lang|zh|水經注}} "Commentary to the River Classic"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The massif had long been considered a sacred mountain and a place of pilgrimage, when before the Communist 'liberation' up to 10,000 [[Golok people]] would make the 120-mile [[circumambulation]] of the mountain each year. The first European to describe the mountain was the British explorer Brigadier-General [[George Pereira]] on his expedition on foot from Peking to Lhasa of 1921-2, sometimes reckoned one of the great geographical discoveries of the twentieth century.  Pereira, who saw Amne Machin from about 70 miles away, thought its "height must be at least 25,000 feet [7,600 m], and might be anything; it dwarfed all other mountains near it."

However, the massif remained unclimbed until 1960. The Amne Machin mountains had been overflown by a few American pilots who overestimated the elevation to 30,000 feet (9,100 m). A 1930 article of the [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] estimated the peak elevation to 28,000 feet [8,500 m] according to the report of [[Joseph Rock]], an American botanist and explorer who, despite death threats from the Golog Tibetans, had ventured to within 80&amp;nbsp;km of the mountain. For a while, the mountains were considered as a possible place for a peak higher than [[Mount Everest]]. While Rock only downgraded his estimate publicly in 1956 to "not much more than 21,000 feet", he did give a detailed description of the peaks:{{quote|[T]he Am-nye Ma-Chhen Range has three prominent peaks; the southern pyramid (second highest) is called Spyan-ras-gzigs (Chenrezig), the [[Avalokiteśvara|Avalokitesvara]], of which the [[Dalai Lama]] is believed to be an incarnation; the central ''lower peak'', a smaller pyramid, Am-nye Ma-Chhen; and the northern, which is the highest, a huge, round, broad dome called dGra-hdul-rlung-shog (Dra-dul-lung-shog) ''Victor of enemies wind wing'' ... The dome in the north is the highest part, but it is not so imposing as the large pyramid at the southern end.}} By 1980 Anyi Machen had been resurveyed at {{convert|6282|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref name=town&gt;John Town, [http://www.alpinejournal.org.uk/Contents/Contents_1988-89_files/AJ%201988%2077-83%20Town%20Amne%20Machin.pdf Amne Machin: a closer look]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climbing history==
In 1960, a Chinese expedition climbed the mountain, but it was demonstrated in 1980 that this expedition climbed Amne Machin II (Roche's ''Chenrezig'', 6,268 m), 7&amp;nbsp;km SSE from the highest summit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.americanalpineclub.org/articles/12198533601/Asia-China-Anyemaqen-II Asia, China, Anyemaqen II], American Alpine Journal 27, p. 336 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Amne Machin I (''Dradullunshog'') was reached near-simultaneously by three groups, each of which had been led to believe they were the first and only ones to obtain a permit from the Chinese government. A Japanese expedition approached the summit from the south and put Giichiro Watanabe, Yoshio Yamamoto and Katsumi Miyake on top on May 22, 1981, and five other expedition members 3 days later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.americanalpineclub.org/articles/12198329202/Asia-China-Anyemaqen-First-Ascent-by-Japanese-1981 Anyemaqen, First Ascent by Japanese, 1981], American Alpine Journal 25, p. 292 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; Within three weeks, the American climbers [[Galen Rowell]], Harold Knutsen and Kim Schmitz made an Alpine-style ascent over the East ridge of the NE summit to reach the main summit on June 9. They did not see any evidence of an earlier ascent.&lt;ref name=rowell&gt;Galen Rowell, [http://publications.americanalpineclub.org/articles/12198208800/On-and-Around-Anyemaqen On and Around Anyemaqen], American Alpine Journal 24, p. 88 (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; The very next day Siegfried Hupfauer, Hans Gaschbauer, Franz Lämmerhofer, Gerhard Schmatz and Peter Vogler of an Austro-German expedition reached the summit as well. They had followed the Japanese route and the 3000 feet of fixed rope they encountered en route convinced them that the Japanese had been the first to summit.&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried Hupfauer, [http://publications.americanalpineclub.org/articles/12198329203/Asia-China-Anyemaqen-1981-Third-Ascent Anyemaqen, 1981, Third Ascent], American Alpine Journal 25, p. 292 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; The mountain remained busy that summer, as Kim Schmitz returned to the summit with two Canadian clients on June 12, another Japanese party summited in August, and in September an Australian team climbed the impressive NE face and descended over the 6&amp;nbsp;km long unclimbed NNE ridge.&lt;ref name=town/&gt;

[[Flood basalt]] describes the formation in a series of lava basalt flows.

Basalt commonly features a very fine-grained or [[volcanic glass|glassy]] matrix interspersed with visible mineral grains. The average density is 3.0 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Basalt is defined by its mineral content and [[Igneous textures|texture]], and physical descriptions without mineralogical context may be unreliable in some circumstances. Basalt is usually grey to black in colour, but rapidly weathers to brown or rust-red due to oxidation of its [[mafic]] (iron-rich) minerals into [[hematite]] and other iron oxides and hydroxides. Although usually characterized as "dark", basaltic rocks exhibit a wide range of shading due to regional geochemical processes. Due to weathering or high concentrations of plagioclase, some basalts can be quite light-coloured, superficially resembling [[andesite]] to untrained eyes. Basalt has a [[fine-grained]] mineral texture due to the molten rock cooling too quickly for large mineral crystals to grow; it is often [[porphyritic]], containing larger crystals ([[phenocrysts]]) formed prior to the extrusion that brought the magma to the surface, embedded in a finer-grained [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]].  These phenocrysts usually are of [[olivine]] or a calcium-rich plagioclase, which have the highest melting temperatures of the typical [[mineral]]s that can crystallize from the melt.

Basalt with a [[vesicular texture]] is called vesicular basalt, when the bulk of the rock is mostly solid; when the vesicles are over half the volume of a specimen, it is called [[scoria]].  This texture forms when dissolved gases come out of solution and form bubbles as the magma decompresses as it reaches the surface, yet are trapped as the erupted lava hardens before the gases can escape.

The term basalt is at times applied to shallow [[intrusive rock]]s with a composition typical of basalt, but rocks of this composition with a [[phaneritic]] (coarser) groundmass are generally referred to as [[diabase]] (also called dolerite) or, when more coarse-grained (crystals over 2&amp;nbsp;mm across), as [[gabbro]].  Gabbro is often marketed commercially as "black granite."

[[File:VessicularBasalt1.JPG|thumb|Vesicular basalt at [[Sunset Crater]], Arizona. [[US quarter]] for scale.]]

In the [[Hadean]], [[Archean]], and early [[Proterozoic]] eras of Earth's history, the chemistry of erupted magmas was significantly different from today's, due to immature crustal and [[asthenosphere]] differentiation.  These [[Ultramafic rock|ultramafic]] volcanic rocks, with silica (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) contents below 45% are usually classified as [[komatiite]]s.

=== Etymology ===
The word "basalt" is ultimately derived from [[Late Latin]] ''basaltes'', a misspelling of Latin ''basanites'' "very hard stone", which was imported from [[Ancient Greek]] βασανίτης (''basanites''), from βάσανος (''basanos'', "[[touchstone (assaying tool)|touchstone]]") and perhaps originated in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''bauhun'' "slate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=basalt (n.) |encyclopedia=Online Etymology Dictionary |first=Douglas |last=Harper |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=basalt |accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern petrological term ''basalt'' describing a particular composition of lava-derived rock originates from its use by [[Georgius Agricola]] in 1556 in his famous work of mining and mineralogy ''[[De re metallica]], libri XII''. Agricola applied "basalt" to the volcanic black rock of the [[Schloßberg (Stolpen)|Schloßberg]] (local castle hill) at [[Stolpen]], believing it to be the same as the "very hard stone" described by [[Pliny the Elder]] in [[Natural History (Pliny)|''Naturalis Historiae'']].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], [[Natural History (Pliny)|''Naturalis Historiae'']]. Book 36, section 11 ([http://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL419.45.xml Loeb Classical Library]): "The Egyptians also discovered in Ethiopia what is called ''basanites'', a stone which in colour and hardness resembles iron: hence the name they have given it." This stone is now believed to have been [[greywacke]], a sedimentary rock unrelated to basalt.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Petrology ==

Note white plagioclase "microlites" in cross-polarized light picture, surrounded by very fine grained volcanic glass.]]
The mineralogy of basalt is characterized by a preponderance of calcic [[plagioclase]] [[feldspar]] and [[pyroxene]]. [[Olivine]] can also be a significant constituent. Accessory [[mineral]]s present in relatively minor amounts include [[iron oxide]]s and iron-titanium oxides, such as [[magnetite]], [[ulvospinel]], and [[ilmenite]]. Because of the presence of such [[oxide]] minerals, basalt can acquire strong [[magnetic]] signatures as it cools, and [[paleomagnetism|paleomagnetic]] studies have made extensive use of basalt.

In [[tholeiitic basalt]], pyroxene ([[augite]] and [[orthopyroxene]] or [[pigeonite]]) and [[calcium]]-rich plagioclase are common [[phenocryst]] minerals. Olivine may also be a phenocryst, and when present, may have rims of pigeonite.  The [[groundmass]] contains interstitial [[quartz]] or [[tridymite]] or [[cristobalite]]. ''Olivine tholeiitic basalt'' has augite and orthopyroxene or pigeonite with abundant olivine, but olivine may have rims of pyroxene and is unlikely to be present in the [[matrix (geology)|groundmass]]. Ocean floor basalts, erupted originally at mid-ocean ridges, are known as MORB (mid-ocean ridge basalt) and are characteristically low in incompatible elements.

[[Alkali basalts]] typically have mineral assemblages that lack orthopyroxene but contain olivine. Feldspar phenocrysts typically are [[labradorite]] to [[andesine]] in composition. Augite is rich in titanium compared to augite in tholeiitic basalt. Minerals such as [[feldspar|alkali feldspar]], [[leucite]], [[nepheline]], [[sodalite]], [[phlogopite]] mica, and [[apatite]] may be present in the groundmass.

Basalt has high [[liquidus]] and [[Solidus (chemistry)|solidus]] temperatures—values at the Earth's surface are near or above 1200&amp;nbsp;°C (liquidus) and near or below 1000&amp;nbsp;°C (solidus); these values are higher than those of other common [[igneous rock]]s.

The majority of tholeiitic basalts are formed at approximately 50–100&amp;nbsp;km depth within the mantle. Many alkali basalts may be formed at greater depths, perhaps as deep as 150–200&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780750633864|title=Plate Tectonics and Crustal Evolution|last=Condie|first=Kent C.|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann / Elsevier|year=1997|isbn=978-0-7506-3386-4|location=|pages=69|chapter=Chapter 3: "Tectonic settings"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=KUSHIRO|first=Ikuo|date=2007|title=Origin of magmas in subduction zones: a review of experimental studies|url=http://joi.jlc.jst.go.jp/JST.JSTAGE/pjab/83.1?from=CrossRef|journal=Proceedings of the Japan Academy, Series B|language=en|volume=83|issue=1|pages=1–15|doi=10.2183/pjab.83.1|issn=0386-2208|bibcode=2007PJAB...83....1K}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of high-alumina basalt continues to be controversial, with disagreement over whether it is a [[magma|primary melt]] or derived from other basalt types by fractionation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ozerov|first1=Alexei Y|title=The evolution of high-alumina basalts of the Klyuchevskoy volcano, Kamchatka, Russia, based on microprobe analyses of mineral inclusions|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|date=January 2000|volume=95|issue=1–4|pages=65–79|doi=10.1016/S0377-0273(99)00118-3|bibcode=2000JVGR...95...65O}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|65}}

=== Geochemistry ===
Relative to most common [[igneous rocks]], basalt compositions are rich in [[magnesium oxide|MgO]] and [[calcium oxide|CaO]] and low in [[silicon dioxide|SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and the alkali oxides, i.e., [[sodium oxide|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] + [[potassium oxide|K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]], consistent with the [[TAS classification]].

Basalt generally has a composition of 45–55 wt% SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 2–6 wt% total alkalis, 0.5–2.0 wt% [[titanium dioxide|TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], 5–14 wt% [[iron(II) oxide|FeO]] and 14 wt% or more [[alumina|Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Contents of CaO are commonly near 10 wt%, those of MgO commonly in the range 5 to 12 wt%.

High-alumina basalts have aluminium contents of 17–19 wt% Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; [[boninite]]s have [[magnesium]] (MgO) contents of up to 15 percent. Rare [[feldspathoid]]-rich [[mafic]] rocks, akin to alkali basalts, may have Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O contents of 12% or more.

The abundances of the [[lanthanide]] or [[rare-earth elements]] (REE) can be a useful diagnostic tool to help explain the history of mineral crystallisation as the melt cooled. In particular, the relative abundance of europium compared to the other REE is often markedly higher or lower, and called the [[europium anomaly]]. It arises because Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can substitute for Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in plagioclase feldspar, unlike any of the other lanthanides, which tend to only form 3+ cations.

Mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) and their intrusive equivalents, [[gabbro]]s, are the characteristic igneous rocks formed at [[mid-ocean ridge]]s. They are [[tholeiitic basalt]]s particularly low in total alkalis and in [[Compatibility (geochemistry)|incompatible]] trace elements, and they have relatively flat [[rare earth element]] (REE) patterns normalized to mantle or [[chondrite]] values. In contrast, alkali basalts have normalized patterns highly enriched in the light REE, and with greater abundances of the REE and of other incompatible elements. Because MORB basalt is considered a key to understanding [[plate tectonics]], its compositions have been much studied. Although MORB compositions are distinctive relative to average compositions of basalts erupted in other environments, they are not uniform. For instance, compositions change with position along the [[Mid-Atlantic ridge]], and the compositions also define different ranges in different ocean basins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hofmann|first1=A.

[[Isotope]] ratios of [[chemical element|elements]] such as [[strontium]], [[neodymium]], [[lead]], [[hafnium]], and [[osmium]] in basalts have been much studied to learn about the evolution of the [[Earth's mantle]]. Isotopic ratios of [[noble gases]], such as &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;[[Helium|He]]/&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He, are also of great value: for instance, ratios for basalts range from 6 to 10 for mid-ocean ridge tholeiitic basalt (normalized to atmospheric values), but to 15–24 and more for ocean-island basalts thought to be derived from [[mantle plume]]s.

Source rocks for the partial melts probably include both [[peridotite]] and [[pyroxenite]] (e.g., Sobolev et al., 2007).

=== Morphology and textures ===
[[File:20011005-0039 DAS large.jpg|thumb|An active basalt lava flow]]
The shape, structure and [[rock microstructure|texture]] of a basalt is diagnostic of how and where it erupted—whether into the sea, in an explosive [[cinder]] eruption or as creeping [[pahoehoe|pāhoehoe]] lava flows, the classic image of [[Hawaii]]an basalt eruptions.

==== Subaerial eruptions ====
{{Main|Subaerial eruption}}
Basalt that erupts under open air (that is, [[subaerial]]ly) forms three distinct types of lava or volcanic deposits: [[scoria]]; [[volcanic ash|ash]] or cinder ([[breccia]]); and lava flows.

Basalt in the tops of subaerial lava flows and [[cinder cone]]s will often be highly [[Vesicular texture|vesiculated]], imparting a lightweight "frothy" texture to the rock. Basaltic cinders are often red, coloured by oxidized [[iron]] from weathered iron-rich minerals such as [[pyroxene]].

[[Lava#ʻAʻā|ʻAʻā]] types of blocky, cinder and breccia flows of thick, viscous basaltic [[lava]] are common in Hawaiʻi. [[Lava#Pāhoehoe|Pāhoehoe]] is a highly fluid, hot form of basalt which tends to form thin aprons of molten lava which fill up hollows and sometimes forms [[lava lake]]s. [[Lava tube]]s are common features of pāhoehoe eruptions.

Basaltic [[tuff]] or [[pyroclastic]] rocks are rare but not unknown. Usually basalt is too hot and fluid to build up sufficient pressure to form explosive lava eruptions but occasionally this will happen by trapping of the lava within the volcanic throat and buildup of [[volcanic gas]]es. Hawaiʻi's [[Mauna Loa]] volcano erupted in this way in the 19th century, as did [[Mount Tarawera]], New Zealand in its violent 1886 eruption. [[Maar]] volcanoes are typical of small basalt tuffs, formed by explosive eruption of basalt through the crust, forming an apron of mixed basalt and wall rock breccia and a fan of basalt tuff further out from the volcano.

Amygdaloidal structure is common in relict [[vesicle (geology)|vesicles]] and beautifully [[crystal]]lized species of [[zeolite]]s, [[quartz]] or [[calcite]] are frequently found.

===== Columnar basalt =====
[[File:Boyabat.jpg|thumb|Columnar [[Joint (geology)|jointed]] basalt in [[Turkey]]]]
{{Main|Columnar jointing}}
{{See also|List of places with columnar basalt}}
During the cooling of a thick lava flow, contractional [[Joint (geology)|joints]] or fractures form.&lt;ref&gt;Smalley, I.J. 1966. Contraction crack networks in basalt flows. Geological Magazine 103, 110-114. doi:org/10.1017/S0016756800050482&lt;/ref&gt; If a flow cools relatively rapidly, significant [[Thermal expansion#Contraction effects|contraction]] forces build up. While a flow can shrink in the vertical dimension without fracturing, it can't easily accommodate shrinking in the horizontal direction unless cracks form; the extensive fracture network that develops results in the formation of [[Columnar jointing|column]]s. The topology of the lateral shapes of these columns can broadly be classed as a [[random cellular network]]. These structures are predominantly hexagonal in cross-section, but polygons with three to twelve or more sides can be observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weaire|first1=D.|last2=Rivier|first2=N.|title=Soap, cells and statistics—random patterns in two dimensions|journal=Contemporary Physics|date=20 August 2006|volume=25|issue=1|pages=59–99|doi=10.1080/00107518408210979|bibcode=1984ConPh..25...59W}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the columns depends loosely on the rate of cooling; very rapid cooling may result in very small (&lt;1&amp;nbsp;cm diameter) columns, while slow cooling is more likely to produce large columns.

==== Submarine eruptions ====
{{Main|Submarine eruption}}
[[File:Pillow basalt crop l.jpg|thumb|Pillow basalts on the south Pacific seafloor]]
[[File:ItalyPillowBasalt.jpg|thumb|Outcrop of a pillow basalt, [[Italy]]]]

===== Pillow basalts =====
{{Main|Pillow lava}}
When basalt erupts underwater or flows into the sea, contact with the water quenches the surface and the lava forms a distinctive ''pillow'' shape, through which the hot lava breaks to form another pillow. This "pillow" texture is very common in underwater basaltic flows and is diagnostic of an underwater eruption environment when found in ancient rocks. Pillows typically consist of a fine-grained core with a glassy crust and have radial jointing. The size of individual pillows varies from 10&amp;nbsp;cm up to several meters.

When ''[[pahoehoe|pāhoehoe]]'' lava enters the sea it usually forms pillow basalts. However, when ''ʻaʻā'' enters the ocean it forms a [[littoral cone]], a small cone-shaped accumulation of tuffaceous debris formed when the blocky ''ʻaʻā'' lava enters the water and explodes from built-up steam.

The island of [[Surtsey]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] is a basalt volcano which breached the ocean surface in 1963. The initial phase of Surtsey's eruption was highly explosive, as the magma was quite fluid, causing the rock to be blown apart by the boiling steam to form a tuff and cinder cone. This has subsequently moved to a typical pāhoehoe-type behaviour.

[[Volcanic glass]] may be present, particularly as rinds on rapidly chilled surfaces of lava flows, and is commonly (but not exclusively) associated with underwater eruptions.

Pillow basalt is also produced by some [[Subglacial eruption|subglacial]] volcanic eruptions.

== Life on basaltic rocks ==
The common corrosion features of underwater volcanic basalt suggest that microbial activity may play a significant role in the chemical exchange between basaltic rocks and seawater.  The significant amounts of reduced iron, Fe(II), and manganese, Mn(II), present in basaltic rocks provide potential energy sources for [[bacteria]].  Some Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria cultured from iron-sulfide surfaces are also able to grow with basaltic rock as a source of Fe(II).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Katrina J. |last=Edwards |first2=Wolfgang |last2=Bach |first3=Daniel R. |last3=Rogers |title=Geomicrobiology of the Ocean Crust: A Role for Chemoautotrophic Fe-Bacteria |journal=Biological Bulletin |volume=204 |issue=2 |pages=180–185 |date=April 2003 |url=http://www.biolbull.org/cgi/content/full/204/2/180 |accessdate=4 November 2015 |doi=10.2307/1543555|pmid=12700150 |jstor=1543555 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fe- and Mn- oxidizing bacteria have been cultured from weathered submarine basalts of [[Loihi Seamount]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Templeton|first1=Alexis S.|last2=Staudigel|first2=Hubert|last3=Tebo|first3=Bradley M.|title=Diverse Mn(II)-Oxidizing Bacteria Isolated from Submarine Basalts at Loihi Seamount|journal=Geomicrobiology Journal|date=April 2005|volume=22|issue=3–4|pages=127–139|doi=10.1080/01490450590945951}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of bacteria on altering the chemical composition of basaltic glass (and thus, the [[oceanic crust]]) and seawater suggest that these interactions may lead to an application of [[hydrothermal vents]] to the [[origin of life]].

== Distribution ==
On Earth, most basalt [[magma]]s have formed by [[decompression melting]] of the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]]. Basalt commonly erupts on [[Io (moon)|Io]] (the third largest moon of [[Jupiter]]),&lt;ref name="LopesGregg"&gt;{{cite book | title=Volcanic Worlds: Exploring The Solar System's Volcanoes | publisher=Springer-Praxis | last=Lopes | first=Rosaly M. C. | last2=Gregg | first2=Tracy K. P. | year=2004 | page=135 | isbn=978-3-540-00431-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has also formed on the [[Moon]], [[Mars]], [[Venus]], and the asteroid [[4 Vesta|Vesta]].

The [[crust (geology)|crustal]] portions of [[ocean]]ic [[tectonic plate]]s are composed predominantly of basalt, produced from upwelling mantle below, the [[ocean ridge]]s.

[[File:Parana traps.JPG|thumb|[[Paraná Traps]], [[Brazil]]]]
Basalt is one of the most common rock types in the world.
Basalt is the rock most typical of [[large igneous province]]s. The largest occurrences of basalt are in the [[ocean floor]] that is almost completely made up by basalt. Above sea level basalt is common in [[ocean island basalt|hotspot islands]] and around volcanic arcs, specially those on thin [[crust (geology)|crust]]. However, the largest volumes of basalt on land correspond to [[continental flood basalt]]s. Continental flood basalts are known to exist in the [[Deccan Traps]] in [[India]], the [[Chilcotin Group]] in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], the [[Paraná Traps]] in Brazil, the [[Siberian Traps]] in [[Russia]], the [[Karoo]] [[flood basalt]] province in South Africa, the [[Columbia River Plateau]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]].

Many archipelagoes and [[island nation]]s have an overwhelming majority of their exposed bedrock made up of basalt due to being above hotspots, for example, [[Iceland]] and [[Hawaii|Hawaiʻi]].

Ancient [[Precambrian]] basalts are usually only found in fold and thrust belts, and are often heavily metamorphosed. These are known as [[greenstone belt]]s, because low-grade [[metamorphism]] of basalt produces [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], [[actinolite]], [[epidote]] and other green minerals.

== Lunar and Martian basalt ==
[[File:Lunar Olivine Basalt 15555 from Apollo 15 in National Museum of Natural History.jpg|thumb|Lunar [[olivine]] basalt collected by [[Apollo 15]].]]
The dark areas visible on Earth's [[moon]], the [[lunar mare|lunar maria]], are plains of [[flood basalt]]ic lava flows. These rocks were sampled by the manned American [[Apollo program]], the robotic Russian [[Luna program]], and are represented among the [[lunar meteorites]].

Lunar basalts differ from their Earth counterparts principally in their high iron contents, which typically range from about 17 to 22 wt% FeO. They also possess a wide range of titanium concentrations (present in the mineral [[ilmenite]]),&lt;ref name="NYT-20151228"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bhanoo |first=Sindya N. |title=New Type of Rock Is Discovered on Moon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/29/science/new-type-of-rock-is-discovered-on-moon.html |date=28 December 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=29 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from less than 1 wt% TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to about 13 wt.%. Traditionally, lunar basalts have been classified according to their titanium content, with classes being named high-Ti, low-Ti, and very-low-Ti. Nevertheless, global geochemical maps of titanium obtained from the [[Clementine mission]] demonstrate that the lunar maria possess a continuum of titanium concentrations, and that the highest concentrations are the least abundant.&lt;ref name="GiguereEtAl2000"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The  titanium contents  of  lunar mare basalts | first=Thomas .A. | last= Giguere | first2=G.

Lunar basalts show exotic textures and mineralogy, particularly [[shock metamorphism]], lack of the [[redox|oxidation]] typical of terrestrial basalts, and a complete lack of [[mineral hydration|hydration]]. Most of the [[geology of the Moon|Moon]]'s basalts erupted between about 3 and 3.5 billion years ago, but the oldest samples are 4.2 billion years old, and the youngest flows, based on the age dating method of [[crater counting]], are estimated to have erupted only 1.2 billion years ago.

Basalt is also a common rock on the surface of [[Mars]], as determined by data sent back from the planet's surface,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grotzinger|first1=J.

=== Metamorphism ===
[[File:Basalt structures.jpg|thumb|Basalt structures in Namibia]]
Basalts are important rocks within [[metamorphic rocks|metamorphic]] belts, as they can provide vital information on the conditions of metamorphism within the belt.

Metamorphosed basalts are important hosts for a variety of [[hydrothermal]] [[ore]] deposits, including [[gold]] deposits, [[copper]] deposits, [[volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit]]s and others.

=== Weathering ===
{{Main|Weathering}}
Compared to other rocks found on Earth's surface, basalts weather relatively fast. The typically iron-rich minerals oxidise rapidly in water and air, staining the rock a brown to red colour due to iron oxide (rust). Chemical weathering also releases readily water-soluble [[cation]]s such as [[calcium]], [[sodium]] and [[magnesium]], which give basaltic areas a strong [[Buffer zone|buffer]] capacity against [[Soil acidification|acidification]]. Calcium released by basalts binds up [[carbondioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] from the atmosphere forming [[Calcium carbonate|CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] acting thus as a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; trap. To this it must be added that the eruption of basalt itself is often associated with the release of large quantities of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the atmosphere from [[volcanic gas]]es.

== Uses ==

Basalt is used in construction (e.g. as building blocks or in the groundwork), making [[cobblestone]]s (from columnar basalt) and in making [[statue]]s. Heating and extruding basalt yields [[stone wool]], said to be an excellent [[thermal insulation|thermal insulator]].

[[Carbon sequestration]] in basalt has been studied as a means of removing carbon dioxide, produced by human industrialization, from the atmosphere. Underwater basalt deposits, scattered in seas around the globe, have the added benefit of the water serving as a barrier to the re-release of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hance|first1=Jeremy|title=Underwater rocks could be used for massive carbon storage on America’s East Coast|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2010/0104-hance_ccs.html|accessdate=4 November 2015|publisher=Mongabay|date=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lorenz attractor yb.svg|thumb|200px|right|A plot of Lorenz's [[strange attractor]] for values ρ=28, σ = 10, β = 8/3. The butterfly effect or sensitive dependence on initial conditions is the property of a [[dynamical system]] that, starting from any of various arbitrarily close alternative [[initial condition]]s on the attractor, the [[iteration#mathematics|iterated points]] will become arbitrarily spread out from each other.]]

[[File:Double pendulum simultaneous realisations.ogv|thumb|200px|right|Experimental demonstration of the butterfly effect with different recordings of the same double pendulum. In each recording, the pendulum starts with almost the same initial condition. Over time the differences in the dynamics grow from almost unnoticeable to drastic ones.]]

In [[chaos theory]], the '''butterfly effect''' is the sensitive dependence on [[initial condition]]s in which a small change in one state of a [[deterministic]] [[nonlinear system]] can result in large differences in a later state.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geoffboeing.com/publications/nonlinear-chaos-fractals-prediction/|author=Boeing, G.|title=Visual Analysis of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: Chaos, Fractals, Self-Similarity and the Limits of Prediction|journal=Systems|date=2016|volume=4|issue=4|pages=37|accessdate=2016-12-02|doi=10.3390/systems4040037|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203123841/http://geoffboeing.com/publications/nonlinear-chaos-fractals-prediction/|archivedate=2016-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term, coined by [[Edward Lorenz]], is derived from the metaphorical example of the details of a tornado (the exact time of formation, the exact path taken) being influenced by minor perturbations such as the flapping of the wings of a distant [[butterfly]] several weeks earlier. Lorenz discovered the effect when he observed that runs of his [[Numerical weather prediction|weather model]] with initial condition data that was rounded in a seemingly inconsequential manner would fail to reproduce the results of runs with the unrounded initial condition data. A very small change in initial conditions had created a significantly different outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorenz|first=Edward N.|title=Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|date=March 1963|volume=20|issue=2|pages=130–141|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:dnf&gt;2.0.co;2|bibcode=1963JAtS...20..130L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Lorenz gave a name to the phenomenon, the idea that small causes may have large effects in general and in weather specifically was earlier recognized by French mathematician and engineer [[Henri Poincaré]] and American mathematician and philosopher [[Norbert Wiener]]. [[Edward Norton Lorenz|Edward Lorenz]]'s work placed the concept of ''instability'' of the earth's [[atmosphere]] onto a quantitative base and linked the concept of instability to the properties of large classes of dynamic systems which are undergoing [[nonlinear dynamics]] and [[Chaos theory|deterministic chaos]].&lt;ref name="scholarpedia"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Butterfly effect - Scholarpedia|url = http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Butterfly_effect|website = www.scholarpedia.org|accessdate = 2016-01-02|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160102214427/http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Butterfly_effect|archivedate = 2016-01-02|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The butterfly effect can also be demonstrated by very simple systems.

==History==
In ''[[The Vocation of Man]]'' (1800), [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] says that "you could not remove a single grain of sand from its place without thereby ... changing something throughout all parts of the immeasurable whole".

[[Chaos theory]] and the sensitive dependence on initial conditions were described in the literature in a particular case of the [[three-body problem]] by [[Henri Poincaré]] in 1890.&lt;ref name="wolframscience.com"&gt;[http://www.wolframscience.com/reference/notes/971c Some Historical Notes: History of Chaos Theory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719234031/http://www.wolframscience.com/reference/notes/971c |date=2006-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later proposed that such phenomena could be common, for example, in meteorology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steves |first1=Bonnie |last2=Maciejewski | first2=AJ |date=September 2001 |title=The Restless Universe Applications of Gravitational N-Body Dynamics to Planetary Stellar and Galactic Systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-wa120qRW5wC |location=USA |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=0750308222 |accessdate=January 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, [[Jacques Hadamard]] noted general divergence of trajectories in spaces of negative curvature. [[Pierre Duhem]] discussed the possible general significance of this in 1908.&lt;ref name="wolframscience.com"/&gt;

The idea that one [[butterfly]] could eventually have a far-reaching [[ripple effect]] on subsequent historic events made its earliest known appearance in "[[A Sound of Thunder]]", a 1952 short story by [[Ray Bradbury]] about time travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/evolution/Time-and-The-Physics-of-Ray-Bradbury--.html | title = The Physics of Ray Bradbury's "A Sound of Thunder" | work = [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] | date = 2012-06-15 | accessdate = 2015-09-02 | first = Faye | last = Flam | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924130717/http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/evolution/Time-and-The-Physics-of-Ray-Bradbury--.html | archivedate = 2015-09-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Lorenz was running a numerical computer model to redo a weather prediction from the middle of the previous run as a shortcut. He entered the initial condition 0.506 from the printout instead of entering the full precision 0.506127 value. The result was a completely different weather scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Gleick |title=Chaos: Making a New Science |location= |publisher=Viking |year=1987 |isbn=0-8133-4085-3 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorenz wrote:
{{blockquote|
"At one point I decided to repeat some of the computations in order to examine what was happening in greater detail. I stopped the computer, typed in a line of numbers that it had printed out a while earlier, and set it running again. I went down the hall for a cup of coffee and returned after about an hour, during which time the computer had simulated about two months of weather. The numbers being printed were nothing like the old ones. I immediately suspected a weak vacuum tube or some other computer trouble, which was not uncommon, but before calling for service I decided to see just where the mistake had occurred, knowing that this could speed up the servicing process. Instead of a sudden break, I found that the new values at first repeated the old ones, but soon afterward differed by one and then several units in the last decimal place, and then began to differ in the next to the last place and then in the place before that. In fact, the differences more or less steadily doubled in size every four days or so, until all resemblance with the original output disappeared somewhere in the second month. This was enough to tell me what had happened: the numbers that I had typed in were not the exact original numbers, but were the rounded-off values that had appeared in the original printout. The initial round-off errors were the culprits; they were steadily amplifying until they dominated the solution." (E. N. Lorenz, ''The Essence of Chaos'', U. Washington Press, Seattle (1993), page 134)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chaos at fifty|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/66/5/10.1063/PT.3.1977|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518003926/http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/66/5/10.1063/PT.3.1977|archivedate=2016-05-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
}}

In 1963 Lorenz published a theoretical study of this effect in a highly cited, seminal paper called ''Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorenz|first=Edward N.|title=Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|date=March 1963|volume=20|issue=2|pages=130–141|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281963%29020%3C0130%3ADNF%3E2.0.CO%3B2|accessdate=3 June 2010|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:DNF&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 1963JAtS...20..130L|issn=1520-0469}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Deterministic+non-periodic+flow&amp;author=E.+N.+Lorenz&amp;publication_year=1963 Google Scholar citation record]&lt;/ref&gt; (the calculations were performed on a [[Royal McBee]] [[LGP-30]] computer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~smillie/ComputerAndMe/Part19.html |title=Part19 |publisher=Cs.ualberta.ca |date=1960-11-22 |accessdate=2014-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717061640/http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~smillie/ComputerAndMe/Part19.html |archivedate=2009-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lorenz1963" /&gt; Elsewhere he stated:{{quote| text=One meteorologist remarked that if the theory were correct, one flap of a [[Gull|sea gull]]'s wings would be enough to alter the course of the weather forever.

According to Lorenz, when he failed to provide a title for a talk he was to present at the 139th meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1972, Philip Merilees concocted ''Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?'' as a title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eaps4.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Butterfly_1972.pdf Lorenz: "Predictability", AAAS 139th meeting, 1972] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612164541/http://eaps4.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Butterfly_1972.pdf |date=2013-06-12 }} Retrieved May 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Although a butterfly flapping its wings has remained constant in the expression of this concept, the location of the butterfly, the consequences, and the location of the consequences have varied widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ap42.com/2011/08/03/the-butterfly-effect-variations-on-a-meme/|title=The Butterfly Effects: Variations on a Meme|accessdate=3 August 2011|work=AP42 ...and everything|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111132249/http://blog.ap42.com/2011/08/03/the-butterfly-effect-variations-on-a-meme/|archivedate=11 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase refers to the idea that a butterfly's wings might create tiny changes in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] that may ultimately alter the path of a [[tornado]] or delay, accelerate or even prevent the occurrence of a tornado in another location. The butterfly does not power or directly create the tornado, but the term is intended to imply that the flap of the butterfly's wings can ''cause'' the tornado: in the sense that the flap of the wings is a part of the initial conditions; one set of conditions leads to a tornado while the other set of conditions doesn't. The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which cascades to large-scale alterations of events (compare: [[domino effect]]). Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the system might have been vastly different—but it's also equally possible that the set of conditions without the butterfly flapping its wings is the set that leads to a tornado.

The butterfly effect presents an obvious challenge to prediction, since initial conditions for a system such as the weather can never be known to complete accuracy. This problem motivated the development of [[ensemble forecasting]], in which a number of forecasts are made from perturbed initial conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Woods|first=Austin|title=Medium-range weather prediction: The European approach; The story of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts |page=118 |location=New York |publisher=Springer |year=2005 |isbn=978-0387269283 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientists have since argued that the weather system is not as sensitive to initial conditions as previously believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orrell|first=David| last2=Smith | first2 = Leonard | last3=Barkmeijer | first3 = Jan | last4 = Palmer | first4 = Tim | title=Model error in weather forecasting|journal=Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics | year=2001| volume=9 | pages=357–371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Orrell]] argues that the major contributor to weather forecast error is model error, with sensitivity to initial conditions playing a relatively small role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orrell|first=David| title=Role of the metric in forecast error growth: How chaotic is the weather?|journal=Tellus | year=2002| volume=54A | pages=350–362| doi=10.3402/tellusa.v54i4.12159| bibcode=2002TellA..54..350O}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Orrell |first=David |title=Truth or Beauty: Science and the Quest for Order |page=208 |location=New Haven|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0300186611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Wolfram]] also notes that the Lorenz equations are highly simplified and do not contain terms that represent viscous effects; he believes that these terms would tend to damp out small perturbations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wolfram|first=Stephen |title=A New Kind of Science |page=998 |location= |publisher=Wolfram Media |year=2002 |isbn=978-1579550080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|colspan=3| These figures show two segments of the three-dimensional evolution of two trajectories (one in blue, and the other in yellow) for the same period of time in the [[Lorenz attractor]] starting at two initial points that differ by only 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; in the x-coordinate. Initially, the two trajectories seem coincident, as indicated by the small difference between the ''z'' coordinate of the blue and yellow trajectories, but for ''t''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;23 the difference is as large as the value of the trajectory. The final position of the cones indicates that the two trajectories are no longer coincident at ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;30.

==Theory and mathematical definition==
[[Poincaré recurrence theorem|Recurrence]], the approximate return of a system towards its initial conditions, together with sensitive dependence on initial conditions, are the two main ingredients for chaotic motion. They have the practical consequence of making [[complex system]]s, such as the [[weather]], difficult to predict past a certain time range (approximately a week in the case of weather) since it is impossible to measure the starting atmospheric conditions completely accurately.

A [[dynamical system]] displays sensitive dependence on initial conditions if points arbitrarily close together separate over time at an exponential rate.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems" /&gt; The definition is not topological, but essentially metrical.

If ''M'' is the [[State space (dynamical system)|state space]] for the map &lt;math&gt;f^t&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f^t&lt;/math&gt; displays sensitive dependence to initial conditions if for any x in ''M'' and any δ&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, there are y in ''M'', with distance ''d''(. , .) such that &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; d(x, y) &lt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; and such that

:&lt;math&gt;d(f^\tau(x), f^\tau(y)) &gt; \mathrm{e}^{a\tau} \, d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;

for some positive parameter ''a''. The definition does not require that all points from a neighborhood separate from the base point ''x'', but it requires one positive [[Lyapunov exponent]].

The simplest mathematical framework exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions is provided by a particular parametrization of the [[logistic map]]:

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = 4 x_n (1-x_n) , \quad 0\leq x_0\leq 1,&lt;/math&gt;

which, unlike most chaotic maps, has a [[closed-form solution]]:

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n}=\sin^{2}(2^{n} \theta \pi)&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[initial condition]] parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;\theta = \tfrac{1}{\pi}\sin^{-1}(x_0^{1/2})&lt;/math&gt;. For rational &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, after a finite number of [[iterated function|iterations]] &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; maps into a [[periodic point|periodic sequence]]. But [[almost all]] &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; are irrational, and, for irrational &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; never repeats itself – it is non-periodic. This solution equation clearly demonstrates the two key features of chaos – stretching and folding: the factor 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; shows the exponential growth of stretching, which results in sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect), while the squared sine function keeps &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; folded within the range&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;1].

==In physical systems==

===In weather===

The butterfly effect is most familiar in terms of [[weather]]; it can easily be demonstrated in standard weather prediction models, for example. The climate scientists James Annan and William Connolley explain that chaos is important in the development of weather prediction methods; models are sensitive to initial conditions. They add the caveat: "Of course the existence of an unknown butterfly flapping its wings has no direct bearing on weather forecasts, since it will take far too long for such a small perturbation to grow to a significant size, and we have many more immediate uncertainties to worry about. So the direct impact of this phenomenon on weather prediction is often somewhat overstated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/11/chaos-and-climate/ |title=Chaos and Climate |publisher=RealClimate |date= |accessdate=2014-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702105624/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/11/chaos-and-climate/ |archivedate=2014-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In quantum mechanics===

The potential for sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect) has been studied in a number of cases in [[Semiclassical physics|semiclassical]] and [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]] including atoms in strong fields and the anisotropic [[Kepler problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Postmodern Quantum Mechanics |first=E.

Other authors suggest that the butterfly effect can be observed in quantum systems. Karkuszewski et al. consider the time evolution of quantum systems which have slightly different [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonians]]. They investigate the level of sensitivity of quantum systems to small changes in their given Hamiltonians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Quantum Chaotic Environments, the Butterfly Effect, and Decoherence |first=Zbyszek P. |last=Karkuszewski |first2=Christopher |last2=Jarzynski |first3=Wojciech H. |last3=Zurek |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=89 |issue=17 |year=2002 |page=170405 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.170405 |bibcode=2002PhRvL..89q0405K|arxiv = quant-ph/0111002 |pmid=12398653}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poulin et al. presented a quantum algorithm to measure fidelity decay, which "measures the rate at which identical initial states diverge when subjected to slightly different dynamics".

==In popular culture==
{{main|Butterfly effect in popular culture}}

The journalist Peter Dizikes, writing in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' in 2008, notes that popular culture likes the idea of the butterfly effect, but gets it wrong. Whereas Lorenz suggested correctly with his butterfly metaphor that predictability "is inherently limited", popular culture supposes that each event can be explained by finding the small reasons that caused it. Dizikes explains: "It speaks to our larger expectation that the world should be comprehensible – that everything happens for a reason, and that we can pinpoint all those reasons, however small they may be. But nature itself defies this expectation."&lt;ref name="Globe"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dizikes |first1=Petyer |title=The meaning of the butterfly |url=http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/06/08/the_meaning_of_the_butterfly/?page=full |accessdate=8 June 2016 |agency=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=8 June 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418154015/http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/06/08/the_meaning_of_the_butterfly/?page=full |archivedate=18 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cambrian–Ordovician extinction event''' occurred approximately 488 million years ago ([[Mya (unit)|m.y.a.]]). This early [[Phanerozoic]] [[Eon (geology)|Eon]] [[extinction event]] eliminated many [[brachiopods]] and [[conodont]]s, and severely reduced the number of [[trilobite]] species.

It was preceded by the less-documented (but probably worse) [[End-Botomian extinction event]] around 517 million years ago and the [[Dresbachian]] extinction event about 502 million years ago.

The '''Cambrian–Ordovician event''' ended the [[Cambrian]] [[Geologic period|Period]], and led into the [[Ordovician]] Period in the [[Paleozoic]] [[Geologic era|Era]].

{{Refimprove|date=June 2008}}
The [[carbon cycle]] is the process by which carbon is exchanged between the four reservoirs of carbon: the  [[biosphere]], the earth, the [[air]] and water. Exchanges take place in several ways, including [[Cellular respiration|respiration]], [[transpiration]], [[combustion]], and [[decomposition]]. The carbon balance, or [[carbon budget]],  is the balance of exchange  between the four reservoirs.

Debate about 're-balancing the carbon cycle' arises from a concern that use of [[fossil fuels]], which has accelerated since the start of the [[industrial revolution]], has caused carbon to accumulate in the atmosphere. Levels of  [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in the atmosphere are estimated to have risen from 280 ppm to almost 400 ppm since 1800 and this is linked to [[global warming]]. It is therefore argued that the carbon cycle should be re-balanced by reducing the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere.

'Carbon cycle re-balancing' is a useful name for a group of environmental policies listed below. The name gives a specific reason for adopting these policies. Related names, including pleas for [[sustainable development]] and participation in the [[green movement]] are politics-based rather than science-based.

*[[Carbon offset]] - for example by photosynthesis (e.g. in new forests)
*[[Carbon capture and storage]] - extraction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and placing it underground or underwater
*Carbon capture and transformation - extraction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and reacting it with hydrogen via renewable energy electrolysis to create methane as an energy store/carrier. Low to neutral {{CO2}} cycle
*[[Sustainable energy]] - a shift from fossil fuels energy to [[wind power]] and [[solar power]] 
*[[Nuclear power]] - as an alternative to fossil fuels
*[[Sustainable design]] - to reduce inputs and outputs of energy
*[[Sustainable transport]] - to reduce reliance on fossil fuels

Burning domestic refuse to generate power can be promoted as a [[recycling]], and therefore sustainable, [[policy]]. But from a carbon cycle re-balancing standpoint it is better to [[compost]] as much domestic refuse as possible.

The '''Carboniferous''' is a [[Period (geology)|geologic period]] and [[System (stratigraphy)|system]] that spans 60 million years from the end of the [[Devonian]] Period {{Period end|Devonian}} million years ago ([[annum|Mya]]), to the beginning of the [[Permian]] Period, {{Period start|Permian}} Mya. The name ''Carboniferous'' means "coal-bearing" and derives from the [[Latin]] words ''[[wikt:carbo#Latin|carbō]]'' ("[[coal]]") and ''[[wikt:fero#Latin|ferō]]'' ("I bear, I carry"), and was coined by geologists [[William Conybeare (geologist)|William Conybeare]] and [[William Phillips (geologist)|William Phillips]] in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. W. D. Conybeare and William Phillips, ''Outlines of the Geology of England and Wales'' ..., Part I, (London, England: William Phillips, 1822). On page 323, Conybeare titles the chapter [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZcMQAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA323#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Book III. Medial or Carboniferous Order."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on a study of the British rock succession, it was the first of the modern 'system' names to be employed, and reflects the fact that many coal beds were formed globally during that time.&lt;ref&gt;Cossey, P.J. et al.

Vast swaths of forest covered the land, which would eventually be laid down and become the coal beds characteristic of the Carboniferous [[system (stratigraphy)|stratigraphy]] evident today.

==Subdivisions==
In the [[United States]] the Carboniferous is usually broken into [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]] (earlier) and [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] (later) subperiods. The Mississippian is about twice as long as the Pennsylvanian, but due to the large thickness of coal-bearing deposits with Pennsylvanian ages in Europe and North America, the two subperiods were long thought to have been more or less equal in duration.&lt;ref&gt;Menning ''et al.'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Carboniferous European subdivisions|float=left}}
In Europe the Lower Carboniferous sub-system is known as the [[Dinantian]], comprising the [[Tournaisian]] and [[Visean]] Series, dated at 362.5-332.9 Ma, and the Upper Carboniferous sub-system is known as the [[Silesian (series)|Silesian]], comprising the [[Namurian]], [[Westphalian (stage)|Westphalian]], and [[Stephanian (stage)|Stephanian]] Series, dated at 332.9-298.9 Ma. The Silesian is roughly contemporaneous with the late Mississippian Serpukhovian plus the Pennsylvanian. In Britain the Dinantian is traditionally known as the [[Carboniferous Limestone]], the Namurian as the [[Millstone Grit]], and the Westphalian as the [[Coal Measures]] and [[Pennant Sandstone]].

The [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] (ICS)  [[Stage (stratigraphy)|faunal stage]]s (in bold) from youngest to oldest, together with some of their regional subdivisions, are:

==Palaeogeography==
A global drop in [[sea level]] at the end of the [[Devonian]] reversed early in the Carboniferous; this created the widespread [[Inland sea (geology)|inland seas]] and the [[carbonate]] deposition of the Mississippian.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | author= Stanley, S.M. | year=1999 | title=Earth System History | location=New York | publisher=Freeman and Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a drop in south polar temperatures; southern [[Gondwana]]land was [[glaciation|glaciated]] throughout the period, though it is uncertain if the ice sheets were a holdover from the Devonian or not.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These conditions apparently had little effect in the deep tropics, where lush swamps, later to become coal, flourished to within 30 degrees of the northernmost [[glacier]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[File:US pennsylvanian general USGS.jpg|thumb|270px|left|Generalized geographic map of the [[United States]] in Middle [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] time.]]

Mid-Carboniferous, a drop in sea level precipitated a major marine extinction, one that hit [[crinoids]] and [[ammonites]] especially hard.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This sea level drop and the associated [[unconformity]] in North America separate the Mississippian subperiod from the Pennsylvanian subperiod.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This happened about 323 million years ago, at the onset of the [[Permo-Carboniferous Glaciation]].{{citation needed|reason=A non-image and a college course do not make a cite|date=July 2010}}

The Carboniferous was a time of active [[orogeny|mountain-building]] as the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]] came together. The southern [[continent]]s remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana, which collided with North America–Europe ([[Laurussia]]) along the present line of eastern North America. This continental collision resulted in the [[Variscan orogeny|Hercynian orogeny]] in Europe, and the [[Alleghenian orogeny]] in North America; it also extended the newly uplifted [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] southwestward as the [[Ouachita Mountains]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In the same time frame, much of present eastern [[Eurasian plate]] welded itself to Europe along the line of the [[Ural Mountains]]. Most of the [[Mesozoic]] supercontinent of Pangea was now assembled, although North China (which would collide in the Latest Carboniferous), and [[South China (continent)|South China]] continents were still separated from [[Laurasia]]. The Late Carboniferous Pangaea was shaped like an "O."

There were two major oceans in the Carboniferous—[[Panthalassa]] and [[Paleo-Tethys]], which was inside the "O" in the Carboniferous Pangaea. Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed - [[Rheic Ocean]] (closed by the assembly of [[South America|South]] and [[North America]]), the small, shallow [[Ural Ocean]] (which was closed by the collision of [[Baltica]] and Siberia continents, creating the [[Ural Mountains]]) and [[Proto-Tethys Ocean]] (closed by [[North China (continent)|North China]] collision with [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]]/[[Kazakhstania]]).

==Climate==
Average global temperatures in the Early Carboniferous Period were high: approximately 20&amp;nbsp;°C (68&amp;nbsp;°F). However, cooling during the Middle Carboniferous reduced average global temperatures to about 12&amp;nbsp;°C (54&amp;nbsp;°F). Lack of growth rings of fossilized trees suggest a lack of seasons of a tropical climate. Glaciations in [[Gondwana]], triggered by Gondwana's southward movement, continued into the [[Permian]] and because of the lack of clear markers and breaks, the deposits of this glacial period are often referred to as [[Permo-Carboniferous]] in age.

The cooling and drying of the climate led to the [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]] (CRC) during the late Carboniferous. Tropical rainforests fragmented and then were eventually devastated by climate change.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"/&gt;

==Rocks and coal==
[[File:MississippianMarbleUT.JPG|thumb|right|Lower Carboniferous marble in Big Cottonwood Canyon, [[Wasatch Mountains]], [[Utah]].]]
Carboniferous rocks in Europe and eastern North America largely consist of a repeated sequence of [[limestone]], [[sandstone]], [[shale]] and [[coal]] beds.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley (1999), p 426&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, the early Carboniferous is largely marine limestone, which accounts for the division of the Carboniferous into two periods in North American schemes. The Carboniferous coal beds provided much of the fuel for power generation during the [[Industrial Revolution]] and are still of great economic importance.

The large coal deposits of the Carboniferous may owe their existence primarily to two factors. The first of these is the appearance of [[wood]] tissue and [[bark (botany)|bark]]-bearing trees. The [[evolution]] of the wood fiber [[lignin]] and the bark-sealing, waxy substance [[suberin]] variously opposed decay organisms so effectively that dead materials accumulated long enough to fossilise on a large scale. The second factor was the lower sea levels that occurred during the Carboniferous as compared to the preceding [[Devonian]] period. This promoted the development of extensive lowland [[swamp]]s and [[forest]]s in North America and Europe. Based on a genetic analysis of mushroom fungi, it was proposed that large quantities of [[wood]] were buried during this period because animals and decomposing [[bacteria]] had not yet [[Evolution|evolved]] enzymes that could effectively digest the resistant phenolic lignin polymers and waxy suberin polymers. They suggest that fungi that could break those substances down effectively only became dominant towards the end of the period, making subsequent coal formation much rarer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Floudas|first1=D.|last2=Binder|first2=M.|last3=Riley|first3=R.|last4=Barry|first4=K.|last5=Blanchette|first5=R.

The Carboniferous trees made extensive use of lignin. They had bark to wood ratios of 8 to 1, and even as high as 20 to 1. This compares to modern values less than 1 to 4. This bark, which must have been used as support as well as protection, probably had 38% to 58% lignin. Lignin is insoluble, too large to pass through cell walls, too heterogeneous for specific enzymes, and toxic, so that few organisms other than [[Basidiomycetes]] fungi can degrade it. To oxidize it requires an atmosphere of greater than 5% oxygen, or compounds such as peroxides. It can linger in soil for thousands of years and its toxic breakdown products inhibit decay of other substances.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, JM. 1990 Lignin, land plants, and fungi: Biological evolution affecting Phanerozoic oxygen balance. Geology 18; 607–610, on p608.&lt;/ref&gt; One possible reason for its high percentages in plants at that time was to provide protection from insects in a world containing very effective insect herbivores (but nothing remotely as effective as modern plant eating insects) and probably many fewer protective toxins produced naturally by plants than exist today. As a result, undegraded carbon built up, resulting in the extensive burial of biologically fixed [[carbon]], leading to an increase in [[oxygen]] levels in the atmosphere; estimates place the peak oxygen content as high as 35%, as compared to 21% today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/library/docfree.asp?DOCID=1G1:16907261&amp;ctrlInfo=Round20:Mode20b:DocG:Result&amp;ao=|title=Ancient Animals Got a Rise out of Oxygen|author=|date=13 May 1995|website=highbeam.com|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This oxygen level may have increased [[wildfire]] activity. It also may have promoted [[gigantism]] of [[insect]]s and [[amphibian]]s — creatures that have been constrained in size by [[Respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] systems that are limited in their physiological ability to transport and distribute oxygen at the lower atmospheric concentrations that have since been available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dudley|first=Robert|title=Atmospheric Oxygen, Giant Paleozoic Insects and the Evolution of Aerial Locomotor Performance|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|date=24 March 1998|volume=201|pages=1043–1050|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/201/8/1043.full.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124032600/http://jeb.biologists.org/content/201/8/1043.full.pdf|archivedate=24 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In eastern North America, marine beds are more common in the older part of the period than the later part and are almost entirely absent by the late Carboniferous. More diverse geology existed elsewhere, of course. Marine life is especially rich in [[crinoids]] and other [[echinodermata|echinoderms]]. [[Brachiopoda|Brachiopods]] were abundant. [[Trilobite]]s became quite uncommon. On land, large and diverse [[plant]] populations existed. Land [[vertebrata|vertebrates]] included large amphibians.

==Life==

===Plants===
[[File:Meyers b15 s0272b.jpg|thumb|250 px|Etching depicting some of the most significant plants of the Carboniferous.]]
{{AmCyc Poster|Coal Plants}}
[[Mississippian age|Early Carboniferous]] land plants, some of which were [[permineralisation|preserved]] in [[coal ball]]s, were very similar to those of the preceding Late [[Devonian]], but new groups also appeared at this time.
[[File:Lycopsid joggins mcr1.JPG|thumb|left|Ancient ''in situ'' [[w:lycopsid|lycopsid]], probably ''[[w:Sigillaria|Sigillaria]]'', with attached [[w:stigmaria|stigmarian roots]].]]
[[File:Lycopsid mcr2.jpg|thumb|left|Base of a [[w:lycopsid|lycopsid]] showing connection with bifurcating [[w:Stigmaria|stigmarian]] roots.]]
The main Early Carboniferous plants were the [[Equisetales]] (horse-tails), [[Sphenophyllales]] (scrambling plants), [[Lycopodiales]] (club mosses), [[Lepidodendrales]] (scale trees), [[Filicales]] (ferns), [[Medullosales]] (informally included in the "[[Pteridospermatophyta|seed ferns]]", an artificial assemblage of a number of early [[gymnosperm]] groups) and the [[Cordaitales]]. These continued to dominate throughout the period, but during [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|late Carboniferous]], several other groups, [[Cycadophyta]] (cycads), the [[Callistophytales]] (another group of "seed ferns"), and the [[Voltziales]] (related to and sometimes included under the [[conifers]]), appeared.

The Carboniferous lycophytes of the order Lepidodendrales, which are cousins (but not ancestors) of the tiny club-moss of today, were huge trees with trunks 30 meters high and up to 1.5 meters in diameter. These included ''[[Lepidodendron]]'' (with its cone called [[Lepidostrobus]]), ''[[Anabathra]]'', ''[[Lepidophloios]]'' and ''[[Sigillaria]]''. The roots of several of these forms are known as [[Stigmaria]]. Unlike present-day trees, their [[secondary growth]] took place in the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]], which also provided stability, instead of the [[xylem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-muenster.de/GeoPalaeontologie/Palaeo/Palbot/ewald1.htm A HISTORY OF PALAEOZOIC FORESTS - Part 2 The Carboniferous coal swamp forests] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920012606/http://www.uni-muenster.de/GeoPalaeontologie/Palaeo/Palbot/ewald1.htm |date=2012-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cladoxylopsida|Cladoxylopsids]] were large trees, that were ancestors of ferns, first arising in the Carboniferous.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Fern ''Fern''. Encyclopedia of Earth. National council for Science and the Environment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109071540/http://www.eoearth.org/article/Fern |date=November 9, 2011 }}. Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt;

The fronds of some Carboniferous ferns are almost identical with those of living species. Probably many species were [[epiphytic]]. Fossil ferns and "seed ferns" include ''[[Pecopteris]]'', ''[[Cyclopteris]]'', ''[[Neuropteris]]'', ''[[Alethopteris]]'', and ''[[Sphenopteris]]''; ''[[Megaphyton]]'' and ''[[Caulopteris]]'' were tree ferns.

The Equisetales included the common giant form ''[[Calamites]]'', with a trunk diameter of 30 to {{convert|60|cm|0|abbr=on}} and a height of up to {{convert|20|m|0|abbr=on}}. ''[[Sphenophyllum]]'' was a slender climbing plant with whorls of leaves, which was probably related both to the calamites and the lycopods.

''[[Cordaites]]'', a tall plant (6 to over 30 meters) with strap-like leaves, was related to the cycads and conifers; the [[catkin]]-like reproductive organs, which bore ovules/seeds, is called ''[[Cardiocarpus]]''. These plants were thought to live in swamps. True coniferous trees (''[[Walchia]]'', of the order Voltziales) appear later in the Carboniferous, and preferred higher drier ground.

===Marine invertebrates===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
In the oceans the most important [[marine invertebrate]] groups are the [[Foraminifera]], [[Anthozoa|corals]], [[Bryozoa]], [[Ostracoda]], [[brachiopod]]s, [[Ammonoidea|ammonoids]], [[hederellid|hederelloids]], [[microconchids]] and [[echinoderm]]s (especially [[crinoid]]s). For the first time foraminifera take a prominent part in the marine faunas. The large spindle-shaped genus ''Fusulina'' and its relatives were abundant in what is now Russia, China, Japan, North America; other important genera include ''Valvulina'', ''Endothyra'', ''Archaediscus'', and ''Saccammina'' (the latter common in Britain and Belgium). Some Carboniferous genera are still [[Extant taxon|extant]].

The microscopic shells of [[radiolaria]]ns are found in [[chert]]s of this age in the [[Culm Measures|Culm]] of [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]], and in Russia, Germany and elsewhere. [[Porifera|Sponges]] are known from [[spicule (sponge)|spicule]]s and anchor ropes, and include various forms such as the Calcispongea ''Cotyliscus'' and ''Girtycoelia'', the [[demosponge]] ''Chaetetes'', and the genus of unusual colonial [[Hyalospongea|glass sponges]] ''[[Titusvillia]]''.

Both [[reef]]-building and solitary corals diversify and flourish; these include both [[Rugosa|rugose]] (for example, ''[[Caninia (genus)|Caninia]]'', ''Corwenia'', ''Neozaphrentis''), heterocorals, and [[Tabulata|tabulate]] (for example, ''Chladochonus'', ''Michelinia'') forms. [[Conularids]] were well represented by ''Conularia''

[[Bryozoa]] are abundant in some regions; the fenestellids including ''Fenestella'', ''Polypora'', and ''[[Archimedes (bryozoan)|Archimedes]]'', so named because it is in the shape of an [[Archimedean screw]]. [[Brachiopod]]s are also abundant; they include [[Productida|productids]], some of which (for example, ''[[Gigantoproductus]]'') reached very large (for brachiopods) size and had very thick shells, while others like ''[[Chonetes]]'' were more conservative in form. [[Athyridida|Athyridids]], [[Spiriferida|spiriferids]], [[Rhynchonellida|rhynchonellids]], and [[Terebratulida|terebratulids]] are also very common. Inarticulate forms include ''[[Discina (brachiopod)|Discina]]'' and ''[[Crania (genus)|Crania]]''. Some species and genera had a very wide distribution with only minor variations.

[[Annelid]]s such as ''Serpulites'' are common fossils in some horizons. Among the mollusca, the [[bivalve]]s continue to increase in numbers and importance. Typical genera include ''[[Aviculopecten]]'', ''[[Posidonomya]]'', ''[[Nucula]]'', ''[[Carbonicola]]'', ''Edmondia'', and ''Modiola'' [[Gastropod]]s are also numerous, including the genera ''Murchisonia'', ''[[Euomphalus]]'', ''Naticopsis''. [[Nautiloid]] [[cephalopod]]s are represented by tightly coiled [[Nautilida|nautilids]], with straight-shelled and curved-shelled forms becoming increasingly rare. [[Goniatite]] [[Ammonoidea|ammonoids]] are common.

[[Trilobite]]s are rarer than in previous periods, on a steady trend towards extinction, represented only by the proetid group. [[Ostracod]]a, a class of [[crustacean]]s, were abundant as representatives of the [[meiobenthos]]; genera included ''Amphissites'', ''Bairdia'', ''Beyrichiopsis'', ''Cavellina'', ''Coryellina'', ''Cribroconcha'', ''Hollinella'', ''Kirkbya'', ''Knoxiella'', and ''Libumella''.

Amongst the [[echinoderm]]s, the [[crinoid]]s were the most numerous. Dense submarine thickets of long-stemmed crinoids appear to have flourished in shallow seas, and their remains were consolidated into thick beds of rock. Prominent genera include ''Cyathocrinus'', ''Woodocrinus'', and ''Actinocrinus''. Echinoids such as ''[[Archaeocidaris]]'' and ''Palaeechinus'' were also present. The [[blastoid]]s, which included the Pentreinitidae and Codasteridae and superficially resembled crinoids in the possession of long stalks attached to the seabed, attain their maximum development at this time.

Freshwater Carboniferous invertebrates include various [[bivalve]] [[mollusc]]s that lived in brackish or fresh water, such as ''[[Anthraconaia]]'', ''[[Naiadites]]'', and ''[[Carbonicola]]''; diverse [[crustacean]]s such as ''[[Candona]]'', ''[[Carbonita (genus)|Carbonita]]'', ''[[Darwinula]]'', ''[[Estheria (crustacean)|Estheria]]'', ''[[Acanthocaris]]'', ''[[Dithyrocaris]]'', and ''[[Anthrapalaemon]]''.

[[File:Megarachne BW.jpg|thumb|The upper Carboniferous giant spider-like eurypterid ''[[Megarachne]]'' grew to legspans of {{convert|50|cm|0|abbr=on}}.]]
The [[Eurypterid]]s were also diverse, and are represented by such genera as   ''[[Anthraconectes]]'', ''[[Megarachne]]'' (originally misinterpreted as a giant spider, hence its name) and the specialised very large ''[[Hibbertopterus]]''. Many of these were amphibious.

Frequently a temporary return of marine conditions resulted in marine or brackish water genera such as ''[[Lingula (genus)|Lingula]]'', [[Orbiculoidea]], and ''[[Productus]]'' being found in the thin beds known as marine bands.

Their diversity when they do appear, however, shows that these arthropods were both well developed and numerous. Their large size can be attributed to the moistness of the environment (mostly swampy fern forests) and the fact that the oxygen concentration in the Earth's atmosphere in the Carboniferous was much higher than today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ploscollections.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0022610;jsessionid=B5ED8399160D7F46A7647ADE513F5B9C.ambra01 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409092356/http://www.ploscollections.org/article/info%3Adoi/10.1371/journal.pone.0022610 |archivedate=2014-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This required less effort for respiration and allowed [[Arthropoda|arthropods]] to grow larger with the up to {{convert|2.6|m|ft|sp=us|adj=mid|-long}} millipede-like ''[[Arthropleura]]'' being the largest-known land invertebrate of all time. Among the insect groups are the huge predatory [[Protodonata]] (griffinflies), among which was ''[[Meganeura]]'', a giant [[dragonfly]]-like insect and with a wingspan of ca. {{convert|75|cm|0|abbr=on}}—the largest flying insect ever to roam the planet. Further groups are the [[Syntonopterodea]] (relatives of present-day [[Ephemeroptera|mayflies]]), the abundant and often large sap-sucking [[Palaeodictyopteroidea]], the diverse herbivorous [[Protorthoptera]], and numerous [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] [[Dictyoptera]] (ancestors of [[cockroach]]es).&lt;ref name="Archi" /&gt; Many insects have been obtained from the coalfields of [[Saarbrücken]] and [[Commentry]], and from the hollow trunks of fossil trees in Nova Scotia. Some British coalfields have yielded good specimens: ''[[Archaeoptitus]]'', from the Derbyshire coalfield, had a spread of wing extending to more than {{convert|35|cm|0|abbr=on}}; some specimens (''[[Brodia]]'') still exhibit traces of brilliant wing colors. In the Nova Scotian tree trunks land snails (''[[Archaeozonites]]'', ''[[Dendropupa]]'') have been found.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

===Fish===
Many fish inhabited the Carboniferous seas; predominantly [[Elasmobranch]]s (sharks and their relatives). These included some, like ''[[Psammodus]]'', with crushing pavement-like teeth adapted for grinding the shells of brachiopods, crustaceans, and other marine organisms. Other sharks had piercing teeth, such as the [[Symmoriida]]; some, the [[petalodont]]s, had peculiar cycloid cutting teeth. Most of the sharks were marine, but the [[Xenacanthida]] invaded fresh waters of the coal swamps. Among the [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]], the [[Palaeonisciformes]] found in coastal waters also appear to have migrated to rivers. [[Sarcopterygii|Sarcopterygia]]n fish were also prominent, and one group, the [[Rhizodont]]s, reached very large size.

Most species of Carboniferous marine fish have been described largely from teeth, fin spines and dermal ossicles, with smaller freshwater fish preserved whole.

Freshwater fish were abundant, and include the genera ''[[Ctenodus]]'', ''[[Uronemus]]'', ''[[Acanthodes]]'', ''[[Cheirodus]]'', and ''[[Gyracanthus]]''.

[[Shark]]s (especially the ''Stethacanthids'') underwent a major [[evolutionary radiation]] during the Carboniferous.&lt;ref name=goldsharks/&gt; It is believed that this evolutionary radiation occurred because the decline of the [[Placodermi|placoderms]] at the end of the Devonian period caused many [[Niche (ecology)|environmental niches]] to become unoccupied and allowed new organisms to evolve and fill these niches.&lt;ref name=goldsharks/&gt; As a result of the evolutionary radiation Carboniferous sharks assumed a wide variety of bizarre shapes including ''[[Stethacanthus]]'' which possessed a flat brush-like dorsal fin with a patch of [[Dermal denticle|denticles]] on its top.&lt;ref name=goldsharks/&gt; ''[[Stethacanthus]]''{{'s}} unusual fin may have been used in mating rituals.&lt;ref name=goldsharks&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/evolution/golden_age.htm |title=A Golden Age of Sharks |accessdate=2008-06-23 |work=Biology of Sharks and Rays |author=R.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

===Tetrapods===
Carboniferous [[amphibian]]s were diverse and common by the middle of the period, more so than they are today; some were as long as 6 meters, and those fully terrestrial as adults had scaly skin.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley (1999), p 411-12.&lt;/ref&gt; They included a number of basal tetrapod groups classified in early books under the [[Labyrinthodont]]ia. These had long bodies, a head covered with bony plates and generally weak or undeveloped limbs. The largest were over 2 meters long. They were accompanied by an assemblage of smaller amphibians included under the [[Lepospondyli]], often only about {{convert|15|cm|0|abbr=on}} long. Some Carboniferous amphibians were aquatic and lived in rivers (''[[Loxomma]]'', ''[[Eogyrinus]]'', ''[[Proterogyrinus]]''); others may have been semi-aquatic (''[[Ophiderpeton]]'', ''[[Amphibamus]]'', ''[[Hyloplesion]]'') or terrestrial (''[[Dendrerpeton]]'', ''[[Tuditanus]]'', ''[[Anthracosaurus]]'').

The [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]] slowed the evolution of amphibians who could not survive as well in the cooler, drier conditions. Reptiles, however, prospered due to specific key adaptations.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"/&gt; One of the greatest evolutionary innovations of the Carboniferous was the [[amniote]] egg, which allowed the laying of eggs in a dry environment, allowing for the further exploitation of the land by certain [[tetrapod]]s. These included the earliest [[Sauropsida|sauropsid]] reptiles (''[[Hylonomus]]''), and the earliest known [[synapsid]] (''[[Archaeothyris]]''). These small lizard-like animals quickly gave rise to many descendants, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[mammal]]s.

Reptiles underwent a major evolutionary radiation in response to the drier climate that preceded the rainforest collapse.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kazlev&gt;M. Alan Kazlev (1998) [http://www.palaeos.com/Paleozoic/Carboniferous/Carboniferous.htm The Carboniferous Period of the Paleozoic Era: 299 to 359 million years ago] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621180851/http://www.palaeos.com/Paleozoic/Carboniferous/Carboniferous.htm |date=2008-06-21 }}, [[Palaeos]].org, Retrieved on 2008-06-23&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the Carboniferous period, [[amniote]]s had already diversified into a number of groups, including [[Protorothyrididae|protorothyridids]], [[captorhinidae|captorhinids]], [[Araeoscelidia|araeoscelid]]s, and several [[Family (biology)|families]] of [[pelycosaur]]s.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

===Fungi===
Because plants and animals were growing in size and abundance in this time (for example, ''[[Lepidodendron]]''), land [[fungi]] diversified further. Marine fungi still occupied the oceans. All modern [[class (biology)|classes]] of fungi were present in the Late Carboniferous ([[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] Epoch).&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell, Meredith, Vilgalys, Rytas, James, Timothy Y., and Taylor, John W. 2008.

==Extinction events==

===Romer's gap===
{{Main|Romer's gap}}
The first 15 million years of the Carboniferous had very limited terrestrial fossils. This gap in the fossil record is called [[Romer's gap]] after the American palaentologist [[Alfred Romer]]. While it has long been debated whether the gap is a result of fossilisation or relates to an actual event, recent work indicates the gap period saw a drop in atmospheric oxygen levels, indicating some sort of [[ecological collapse]].&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;Ward, P. et al. (2006): Confirmation of Romer's Gap is a low oxygen interval constraining the timing of initial arthropod and vertebrate terrestrialization. ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' no 103 (45): pp 16818-16822.&lt;/ref&gt; The gap saw the demise of the [[Devonian]] fish-like [[ichthyostegalia]]n labyrinthodonts, and the rise of the more advanced [[Temnospondyli|temnospondyl]] and [[reptiliomorpha]]n amphibians that so typify the Carboniferous terrestrial vertebrate fauna.

===Carboniferous rainforest collapse===
{{Main|Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse}}
Before the end of the Carboniferous Period, an [[extinction event]] occurred. On land this event is referred to as the [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]] (CRC).&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"/&gt; Vast tropical rainforests collapsed suddenly as the [[climate change]]d from hot and humid to cool and arid. This was likely caused by intense [[glaciation]] and a drop in sea levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Heckel, P.H. | year=2008 | title=Pennsylvanian cyclothems in Midcontinent North America as far-field effects of waxing and waning of Gondwana ice sheets | journal=Resolving the late Paleozoic ice age in time and space:Geological Society of America Special Paper | volume =441 | pages = 275–289 | doi= 10.1130/2008.2441(19) | isbn= 978-0-8137-2441-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new climatic conditions were not favorable to the growth of rainforest and the animals within them. Rainforests shrank into isolated islands, surrounded by seasonally dry habitats. Towering [[lycopsid]] forests with a heterogeneous mixture of vegetation were replaced by much less diverse tree-fern dominated flora.
 
Amphibians, the dominant vertebrates at the time, fared poorly through this event with large losses in biodiversity; reptiles continued to diversify due to key adaptations that let them survive in the drier habitat, specifically the hard-shelled egg and scales, both of which retain water better than their amphibian counterparts.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"/&gt;

A '''combined storage tank''' combines hot water storage both for heating support and drinking water heating in a larger tank. As a result, warm water, typically from solar thermal energy, is stored temporarily for both purposes for later consumption. Breaks in sunshine can thus be bridged without any additional heating, depending on the heating requirement and storage size. This generally takes up less space than two individual [[Hot water storage tank|buffer tanks]] and thermal losses are thereby reduced. These storage tanks are mostly insulated on the outside and designed for the lowest possible heat losses. Usually, it is a tank-in-tank system, that is, a two-compartment system arranged one inside the other. It is thus a combined buffer storage tank with a heat exchange plate in between. Above is a smaller interior tank for drinking water, i.e. water for showers, washing etc. and around it on the outside is a much larger storage volume for heating water for room heating.

An alternative is the [[Layered charge storage|layer charge storage tank]], where the warmest storage layer is located at the top of the tank and colder layers below. The advantage of this is that different temperatures cannot be mixed and warm water can be used for longer. The layer storage tank is considered the most modern type of storage in this field. For drinking water heating, a fresh water station is used in the throughflow principle with a heat exchanger, which reduces the risk of [[legionella]] formation and is therefore even more hygienic.

This leads to efficiency optimisation together with an intelligent loading and unloading control. Both are especially useful if combined with what is called a low-temperature heating system and good building insulation, which makes the energy more effective.

A '''deep sea community''' is any [[community (ecology)|community]] of [[organism]]s associated by a shared [[habitat]] in the [[deep sea]]. Deep sea communities remain largely unexplored, due to the technological and logistical challenges and expense involved in visiting this remote [[biome]]. Because of the unique challenges (particularly the high [[Atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]], extremes of temperature and [[aphotic zone|absence of light]]), it was long believed that little life existed in this hostile environment. Since the 19th century however, research has demonstrated that significant [[biodiversity]] exists in the deep sea.

The three main sources of energy and nutrients for deep sea communities are [[marine snow]], [[whale fall]]s, and [[chemosynthesis]] at [[hydrothermal vent]]s and [[cold seep]]s.

==History==
Prior to the 19th century scientists assumed life was sparse in the deep ocean. In the 1870s [[Charles Wyville Thomson|Sir Charles Wyville Thomson]] and colleagues aboard the [[Challenger expedition]] discovered many deep-sea creatures of widely varying types.

The first discovery of any deep-sea [[chemosynthetic]] community including higher animals was unexpectedly made at hydrothermal vents in the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]] during geological explorations (Corliss et al., 1979).&lt;ref name=MMS2006&gt;[[Minerals Management Service]] Gulf of Mexico OCS Region (November 2006).

[http://www.gomr.mms.gov/PDFs/2006/2006-062-Vol1.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Two scientists, J. Corliss and J. van Andel, first witnessed dense chemosynthetic clam beds from the submersible ''[[DSV Alvin]]'' on February 17, 1977, after their unanticipated discovery using a remote camera sled two days before.&lt;ref name=MMS2006/&gt;

The [[Challenger Deep]] is the deepest surveyed point of all of Earth's oceans; it is located at the southern end of the [[Mariana Trench]] near the [[Mariana Islands]] group. The depression is named after HMS ''Challenger'', whose researchers made the first recordings of its depth on 23 March 1875 at [http://www.19thcenturyscience.org/HMSC/HMSC-Reports/1895-Summary/htm/doc878.html station 225]. The reported depth was 4,475 [[fathom]]s (8184 meters) based on two separate soundings. In 1960, [[Don Walsh]] and [[Jacques Piccard]] descended to the bottom of the Challenger Deep in the [[Trieste (bathyscaphe)|''Trieste'']] [[bathyscaphe]]. At this great depth a small flounder-like fish was seen moving away from the spotlight of the bathyscaphe.

The Japanese [[remote operated vehicle]] (ROV) ''[[Kaikō ROV|Kaiko]]'' became the second vessel to reach the bottom of the Challenger Deep in March 1995. ''[[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|Nereus]]'', a hybrid remotely operated vehicle (HROV) of the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]], is the only vehicle capable of exploring ocean depths beyond 7000 meters. ''Nereus'' reached a depth of 10,902 meters at the Challenger Deep on May 31, 2009.&lt;ref name="Nereus Mission"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8080324.stm|title=Robot sub reaches deepest ocean|date=3 June 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moana1&gt;{{cite web|author=University of Hawaii Marine Center|date=4 June 2009|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/UMC/Reports/Archives/KMreportAprilMay2009.html|title=Daily Reports for R/V KILO MOANA June &amp; July 2009|publisher=University of Hawaii|location=Honolulu, Hawaii|accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 June 2009, sonar mapping of the Challenger Deep by the [[Simrad Optronics|Simrad]] EM120 [[Multibeam echosounder|multibeam sonar bathymetry]] system aboard the [[RV Kilo Moana (T-AGOR-26)|R/V ''Kilo Moana'']] indicated a maximum depth of {{convert|10971|m|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}}.

[[File:Pelagiczone.svg|thumb|Pelagic zones]]

The ocean can be conceptualized as being divided into various [[oceanic zone|zones]], depending on depth, and presence or absence of [[sunlight]]. Nearly all [[Organism|life forms]] in the ocean depend on the [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] activities of [[phytoplankton]] and other marine [[plant]]s to convert [[carbon dioxide]] into [[Total organic carbon|organic carbon]], which is the basic building block of [[organic matter]]. Photosynthesis in turn requires energy from sunlight to drive the chemical reactions that produce organic carbon.&lt;ref name=Smith2009&gt;{{cite journal|author1=K.L. Smith, Jr |author2=H.A. Ruhl |author3=B.J. Bett |author4=D.S.M. Billett |author5=R.S. Lampitt |author6=R.S.

The stratum of the [[water column]] up till which sunlight penetrates is referred to as the [[photic zone]]. The photic zone can be subdivided into two different vertical regions. The uppermost portion of the photic zone, where there is adequate light to support photosynthesis by phytoplankton and plants, is referred to as the [[euphotic zone]] (also referred to as the ''[[Pelagic zone#Epipelagic .28sunlit.29|epipelagic zone]]'', or ''surface zone'').&lt;ref name=Peruvian&gt;{{cite book|author=Jorge Csirke|title=El Niño and the Peruvian Anchovy Fishery (series: Global Change Instruction Program)|editor=Edward A.

The euphotic zone is somewhat arbitrarily defined as extending from the surface to the depth where the light intensity is approximately 0.1–1% of surface sunlight [[Insolation|irradiance]], depending on [[season]], [[latitude]] and degree of water [[turbidity]].&lt;ref name=Peruvian/&gt;&lt;ref name=Britann/&gt; In the clearest ocean water, the euphotic zone may extend to a depth of about 150 meters,&lt;ref name=Peruvian/&gt; or rarely, up to 200 meters.&lt;ref name=enchantedlearning/&gt; [[solution|Dissolved substances]] and [[Suspension (chemistry)|solid particles]] absorb and scatter light, and in coastal regions the high concentration of these substances causes light to be attenuated rapidly with depth. In such areas the euphotic zone may be only a few tens of meters deep or less.&lt;ref name=Peruvian/&gt;&lt;ref name=enchantedlearning/&gt; The dysphotic zone, where light intensity is considerably less than 1% of surface irradiance, extends from the base of the euphotic zone to about 1000 meters.&lt;ref name=Buesseler/&gt; Extending from the bottom of the photic zone down to the [[seabed]] is the [[aphotic zone]], a region of perpetual darkness.&lt;ref name=enchantedlearning/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buesseler/&gt;

Since the average depth of the ocean is about 4300 meters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|date=2 December 2008|url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/oceandepth.html|title=How deep is the ocean?|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|location=Washington, DC|accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the photic zone represents only a tiny fraction of the ocean’s total volume. However, due to its capacity for photosynthesis, the photic zone has the greatest biodiversity and [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] of all oceanic zones. Nearly all [[primary production]] in the ocean occurs here. Any life forms present in the aphotic zone must either be capable of [[Diel vertical migration|movement upwards through the water column]] into the photic zone for feeding, or must rely on [[marine snow|material sinking from above]],&lt;ref name=Smith2009/&gt; or must find another source of energy and nutrition, such as occurs in [[chemosynthesis|chemosynthetic]] [[archaea]] found near [[hydrothermal vent]]s and [[cold seep]]s.

===Hyperbaricity===
{{Further information|Barophile}}
[[File:Marianatrenchmap.png|thumb|Location of the [[Challenger Deep]] in the [[Mariana Trench]]]]

These animals have [[natural selection|evolved]] to survive the extreme pressure of the sub-[[photic zone]]s. The pressure increases by about one [[megapascal|atmosphere]] every ten meters. To cope with the pressure, many fish are rather small, usually not exceeding 25&amp;nbsp;cm in length. Also, scientists have discovered that the deeper these creatures live, the more gelatinous their flesh and more minimal their skeletal structure. These creatures have also eliminated all excess cavities that would collapse under the pressure, such as swim bladders.&lt;ref name= "name"&gt;[http://marinebio.com/Oceans/TheDeep/ The Deep Sea at MarineBio.org – Ocean biology, Marine life, Sea creatures, Marine conservation]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pressure]] is the greatest environmental factor acting on deep-sea organisms. In the deep sea, although most of the deep sea is under pressures between 200 and 600 atm, the range of pressure is from 20 to 1,000 atm. Pressure exhibits a great role in the distribution of deep sea organisms. Until recently, people lacked detailed information on the direct effects of pressure on most deep-sea organisms, because virtually all organisms trawled from the deep sea arrived at the surface dead or dying. With the advent of traps that incorporate a special pressure-maintaining chamber, undamaged larger [[metazoan]] animals have been retrieved from the deep sea in good condition. Some of these have been maintained for experimental purposes, and we are obtaining more knowledge of the biological effects of pressure.

===Temperature===
{{Further information|Thermophile}}
The two areas of greatest and most rapid [[temperature]] change in the oceans are the transition zone between the surface waters and the deep waters, the thermocline, and the transition between the deep-sea floor and the hot water flows at the hydrothermal vents. Thermoclines vary in thickness from a few hundred meters to nearly a thousand meters. Below the thermocline, the water mass of the deep ocean is cold and far more homogeneous. Thermoclines are strongest in the tropics, where the temperature of the [[epipelagic zone]] is usually above 20&amp;nbsp;°C. From the base of the epipelagic, the temperature drops over several hundred meters to 5 or 6&amp;nbsp;°C at 1,000 meters. It continues to decrease to the bottom, but the rate is much slower. Below 3,000 to 4,000 m, the water is [[isothermal]]. At any given depth, the temperature is practically unvarying over long periods of time. There are no seasonal temperature changes, nor are there any annual changes. No other habitat on earth has such a constant temperature.

Hydrothermal vents are the direct contrast with constant temperature. In these systems, the temperature of the water as it emerges from the "black smoker" chimneys may be as high as 400&amp;nbsp;°C (it is kept from boiling by the high hydrostatic pressure) while within a few meters it may be back down to 2–4&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Nybakken, James W. Marine Biology: An Ecological Approach. Fifth Edition. Benjamin Cummings, 2001. p. 136–141.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salinity===
{{Further information|Halophile}}
[[File:Brine pool.jpg|thumb|[[NOAA]] rendering of a [[brine pool]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]]]

[[Salinity]] is constant throughout the depths of the deep sea. There are two notable exceptions to this rule:
#In the [[Mediterranean Sea]], water loss through [[evaporation]] greatly exceeds input from [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and river runoff. Because of this, salinity in the Mediterranean is higher than in the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Paul R. Pinet|year=1996|title=Invitation to Oceanography|location=St Paul, MN|publisher=West Publishing Co.|isbn=0-314-06339-0|edition=3rd|page=202|postscript=.&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evaporation is especially high in its eastern half, causing the water level to decrease and salinity to increase in this area.&lt;ref&gt;Pinet 1996, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting pressure gradient pushes relatively cool, low-salinity water from the Atlantic Ocean across the basin. This water warms and becomes saltier as it travels eastward, then sinks in the region of the [[Levant]] and circulates westward, to spill back into the Atlantic over the [[Strait of Gibraltar]].&lt;ref&gt;Pinet 1996, pp. 206–207.&lt;/ref&gt; The net effect of this is that at the Strait of Gibraltar, there is an eastward surface current of cold water of lower salinity from the Atlantic, and a simultaneous westward current of warm saline water from the Mediterranean in the deeper zones. Once back in the Atlantic, this chemically distinct [[Mediterranean Intermediate Water]] can persist for thousands of kilometers away from its source.&lt;ref&gt;Pinet 1996, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Brine pool]]s are large areas of [[brine]] on the [[seabed]]. These pools are bodies of water that have a salinity that is three to five times greater than that of the surrounding ocean. For deep sea brine pools the source of the salt is the dissolution of large [[sodium chloride|salt]] deposits through [[salt tectonics]]. The brine often contains high concentrations of methane, providing [[energy]] to [[chemosynthesis|chemosynthetic]] [[extremophile]]s that live in this specialized [[biome]]. Brine pools are also known to exist on the [[Antarctic continental shelf]] where the source of brine is salt excluded during formation of [[sea ice]]. Deep sea and Antarctic brine pools can be toxic to marine animals. Brine pools are sometimes called ''seafloor lakes'' because the dense brine creates a [[halocline]] which does not easily mix with overlying seawater. The high salinity raises the density of the brine, which creates a distinct surface and shoreline for the pool.&lt;ref name="NOAA"&gt;[http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/02mexico/background/brinepool/brinepool.html NOAA exploration of a brine pool]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[deep sea]], or deep layer, is the lowest layer in the ocean, existing below the thermocline, at a depth of 1000 fathoms (1800 m) or more. The deepest part of the deep sea is [[Mariana Trench]] located in the western North Pacific. It is also the deepest point of the earth's crust. It has a maximum depth of about 10.9&amp;nbsp;km which is deeper than the height of [[Mount Everest]]. In 1960, [[Don Walsh]] and [[Jacques Piccard]] reached the bottom of Mariana Trench in the [[Trieste (bathyscaphe)|''Trieste'' bathyscaphe]]. The pressure is about 11,318 [[kilogram-force|metric tons-force]] per square meter (110.99 [[megapascal|MPa]] or 16100 [[pounds per square inch|psi]]).

{{Main articles|Mesopelagic zone|Mesopelagic fish}}
[[File:Coccorella atrata.png|thumb|Most mesopelagic fish are ambush predators with upward-facing eyes, like this [[sabertooth fish]].]]
The mesopelagic zone is the upper section of the [[midwater zone]], and extends from {{convert|200|to|1000|m|ft}} below [[sea level]]. This is colloquially known as the "twilight zone" as light can still penetrate this layer, but it is too low to support photosynthesis. The limited amount of light, however, can still allow organisms to see, and creatures with a sensitive vision can detect prey, communicate, and orientate themselves using their sight. Organisms in this layer have large eyes to maximize the amount of light in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books|plainurl=yes|id=va1ODFo_tdUC|page=340}}|title=Aquatic Life of the World|volume=6|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|pages=340–341|isbn=978-0-7614-7176-9|chapter=Midwater zone|location=Tarrytown, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most mesopelagic fish make daily [[Diel vertical migration|vertical migration]]s, moving at night into the epipelagic zone, often following similar migrations of zooplankton, and returning to the depths for safety during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bone|first=Quentin|last2=Moore|first2=Richard|year=2008|title=Biology of Fishes|publisher=Garland Science|isbn=978-0-203-88522-2|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moyle&gt;{{cite book|last=Moyle|first=P.

The swimbladder is inflated when the fish wants to move up, and, given the high pressures in the mesopelegic zone, this requires significant energy. As the fish ascends, the pressure in the swimbladder must adjust to prevent it from bursting. When the fish wants to return to the depths, the swimbladder is deflated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1251208| pmid = 1251208| title = Fishes in oxygen-minimum zones: Blood oxygenation characteristics| journal = Science| volume = 191| issue = 4230| pages = 957–9| year = 1976| last1 = Douglas | first1 = E.| last2 = Friedl | first2 = W.| last3 = Pickwell | first3 = G.| bibcode = 1976Sci...191..957D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some mesopelagic fishes make daily migrations through the [[thermocline]], where the temperature changes between {{convert|10|and|20|°C|°F}}, thus displaying considerable tolerances for temperature change.&lt;ref name=moyle/&gt;{{rp|590}}

Mesopelagic fish usually lack defensive spines, and use colour and [[bioluminescence]] to [[Counter-illumination|camouflage]] them from other fish. [[Ambush predator]]s are dark, black or red. Since the longer, red, wavelengths of light do not reach the deep sea, red effectively functions the same as black. Migratory forms use [[Countershading|countershaded]] silvery colours. On their bellies, they often display [[photophore]]s producing low grade light. For a predator from below, looking upwards, this [[bioluminescence]] camouflages the silhouette of the fish. However, some of these predators have yellow lenses that filter the (red deficient) ambient light, leaving the bioluminescence visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0025315400021019| title = On yellow lenses in mesopelagic animals| journal = Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom| volume = 56| issue = 4| pages = 963| year = 2009| last1 = Muntz | first1 = W.

==Energy sources==
[[File:Model of wood fall succession on deep sea floor - journal.pone.0053590.g008.png|thumb|Wood fall as an energy source.]]

===Marine snow===
The upper photic zone of the ocean is filled with particle organic matter (POM) and is quite productive, especially in the coastal areas and the upwelling areas. However, most POM is small and light. It may take hundreds, or even thousands of years for these particles to settle through the water column into the deep ocean. This time delay is long enough for the particles to be remineralized and taken up by organisms in the food webs.

Scientists at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution conducted an experiment three decades ago in deep Sargasso Sea looking at the rate of sinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Marine Snow and Fecal Pellets|url=http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/viewArticle.do?id=2387&amp;archives=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found what became known as [[marine snow]] in which the POM are repackaged into much larger particles which sink at much greater speed, 'falling like snow'.

Because of the sparsity of food, the organisms living on and in the bottom are generally opportunistic. They have special adaptations for this extreme environment: rapid growth, effect larval dispersal mechanism and the ability to use a ‘transient’ food resource. One typical example is wood-boring [[bivalves]], which bore into wood and other plant remains and are fed on the organic matter from the remains.

===Whale falls===
For the deep-sea ecosystem, the death of a [[whale]] is the most important event. A dead whale can bring hundreds of tons of organic matter to the bottom. [[Whale fall]] community progresses through three stages:&lt;ref&gt;Shana Goffredi, Unusual benthic fauna associated with a whale fall in Monterey Canyon, California, Deep-Sea Research, 1295–1304, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
# Mobile scavenger stage: Big and mobile deep-sea animals arrive at the site almost immediately after whales fall on the bottom. [[Amphipods]], [[crab]]s, [[sleeper shark]]s and [[hagfish]] are all scavengers.
# Opportunistic stage:  Organisms arrive which colonize the bones and surrounding sediments that have been contaminated with organic matter from the carcass and any other tissue left by the scavengers. One genus is ''[[Osedax]]''.,&lt;ref&gt;Noah K. Whiteman, Between a whale bone and the deep blue sea: the provenance of dwarf males in whale bone-eating tube worms, Molecular Ecology, 4395–4397, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; a tube worm. The larva is born without sex. The surrounding environment determines the sex of the larva. When a larva settles on a whale bone, it turns into a female; when a larva settles on or in a female, it turns into a dwarf male. One female ''Osedax'' can carry more than 200 of these male individuals in its oviduct.
# [[Sulfophilic]] stage: Further decomposition of bones and seawater sulfate reduction happen at this stage. Bacteria create a sulphide-rich environment analogous to hydrothermal vents. Polynoids, bivalves, [[gastropods]] and other sulphur-loving creatures move in.

===Chemosynthesis===

====Hydrothermal vents====
[[File:Blacksmoker in Atlantic Ocean.jpg|thumb|[[hydrothermal vent]]]]

[[Hydrothermal vents]] were discovered in 1977 by scientists from Scripps Institution of Oceanography. So far, the discovered hydrothermal vents are all located at the boundaries of plates: East Pacific, California, Mid-Atlantic ridge, China and Japan.

New ocean basin material is being made in regions such as the Mid-Atlantic ridge as tectonic plates pull away from each other. The rate of spreading of plates is 1–5&amp;nbsp;cm/yr. Cold sea water circulates down through cracks between two plates and heats up as it passes through hot rock. Minerals and sulfides are dissolved into the water during the interaction with rock. Eventually, the hot solutions emanate from an active sub-seafloor rift, creating a hydrothermal vent.

Chemosynthesis of bacteria provide the energy and organic matter for the whole food web in vent ecosystems. [[Giant tube worm]]s can grow to {{Convert|2.4|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall because of the richness of nutrients. Over 300 new species have been discovered at hydrothermal vents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Botos|first=Sonia|title=Life on a hydrothermal vent |url=http://www.botos.com/marine/vents01.html#body_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrothermal vents are entire ecosystems independent from sunlight, and may be the first evidence that the earth can support life without the sun.

====Cold seeps====
A [[cold seep]] (sometimes called a cold vent) is an area of the [[ocean floor]] where [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[methane]] and other [[hydrocarbon]]-rich fluid seepage occurs, often in the form of a [[brine pool]].

== Ecology ==

Deep sea [[food web]]s are complex, and aspects of the system are poorly understood. Typically, predator-prey interactions within the deep are compiled by direct observation (likely from [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s), analysis of stomach contents, and biochemical analysis. Stomach content analysis is the most common method used, but it is not reliable for some species.&lt;ref name="Choy2017"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Choy |first=C. Anela |last2=Haddock |first2=Steven H.

In deep sea pelagic ecosystems off of California, the trophic web is dominated by [[deep sea fishes]], [[cephalopod]]s, [[gelatinous zooplankton]], and [[crustacean]]s. Between 1991–2016, 242 unique feeding relationships between 166 species of predators and prey demonstrated that gelatinous zooplankton have an ecological impact similar to that of large fishes and squid. [[Narcomedusae]], [[siphonophore]]s (of the family [[Physonectae]]), [[ctenophore]]s, and cephalopods consumed the greatest diversity of prey, in decreasing order.&lt;ref name="Choy2017" /&gt; [[Cannibalism]] has been documented in squid of the genus ''[[Gonatus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/science/deep-sea-food-web.html |title=What Eats What: A Landlubber’s Guide to Deep Sea Dining |last=Klein |first=JoAnna |date=December 19, 2017 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2017-12-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220081001/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/science/deep-sea-food-web.html |archive-date=December 20, 2017 |dead-url=no |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ancient Greek religion}}

In [[ancient Greek religion]] and [[Greek mythology|mythology]], '''Demeter''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ɪ|ˈ|m|iː|t|ər|}}; [[Attic Greek|Attic]]: {{lang|grc|Δημήτηρ}} ''Dēmḗtēr'', {{IPA-el|dɛːmɛ́ːtɛːr|pron}}; [[Doric Greek|Doric]]: {{lang|grc|Δαμάτηρ}} ''Dāmā́tēr'') is the goddess of the grain, agriculture, harvest, growth, and nourishment, who presided over [[grain]]s and the [[fertility (soil)|fertility]] of the earth. Her cult titles include Sito ({{lang|grc|Σιτώ}}), "she of the Grain",&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|*sitw/|Σιτώ}}. [[Cf.]] {{LSJ|si{{=}}tos|σῖτος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as the giver of food or grain,&lt;ref&gt;[[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], scholia on [[Homer]], 265.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thesmophoria|Thesmophoros]] ({{lang|grc|θεσμός}}, ''thesmos'': divine order, unwritten law; {{lang|grc|φόρος}}, ''phoros'': bringer, bearer), "Law-Bringer", as a mark of the civilized existence of agricultural society.&lt;ref name=Finley78&gt;[[Themis]] was an ancient Greek goddess, embodiment of divine order, law. She was the organizer of the communal affairs and she evoked the social order: Finley, ''The World of Odysseus'', rev. ed. Viking Press. (1978:78 note 82)&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Demeter is often described simply as the goddess of the harvest, she presided also over the [[religious law|sacred law]], and the cycle of life and death. She and her daughter [[Persephone]] were the central figures of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] that predated the [[Olympian pantheon]]. In the [[Linear B]] [[Mycenean Greek]] tablets of c. 1400–1200 BC found at [[Pylos]], the "two queens and the king" may be related with Demeter, [[Persephone]] and [[Poseidon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Chadwick]], ''The Mycenean World''. Cambridge University Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mylonas159&gt;"Wa-na-ssoi, wa-na-ka-te, (to the two queens and the king). Wanax is best suited to Poseidon, the special divinity of Pylos. The identity of the two divinities addressed as wanassoi, is uncertain ": George Mylonas (1966) Mycenae and the Mycenean age" p.159 :Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[Interpretatio graeca|Roman equivalent]] is [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]].&lt;ref name="Lar"&gt;''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', [[The Book People]], Haydock, 1995, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
It is possible that Demeter appears in [[Linear A]] as ''da-ma-te'' on three documents ([[Arkalochori|AR]] Zf 1 and 2, and [[Kythera|KY]] Za 2), all three apparently dedicated in religious situations and all three bearing just the name (''i-da-ma-te'' on AR Zf 1 and 2).&lt;ref&gt;Y. Duhoux, "LA &gt; B da-ma-te = Déméter? Sur la langue du linéaire A," Minos
29/30 (1994-1995): 289–294.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unlikely that Demeter appears as ''da-ma-te'' in a [[Linear B]] ([[Mycenean Greek]]) inscription ([[Pylos|PY]] En 609); the word {{lang|gmy|𐀅𐀔𐀳}}, ''da-ma-te'', probably refers to "households".&lt;ref&gt;Y. Duhoux and A. Morpurgo-Davies, Companion to Linear B, vol. 2 (2011), p. 26. But see Ventris/Chadwick,''Documents in Mycenean Greek'' p.242: B.Dietriech (2004):''The origins of the Greek religion'' Bristol Phoenix Press. p.172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=da-ma-te|url=http://minoan.deaditerranean.com/resources/linear-b-sign-groups/da/da-ma-te/|website=Deaditerranean.

Demeter's character as [[mother-goddess]] is identified in the second element of her name ''meter'' ({{lang|grc|μήτηρ}}) derived from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*méh₂tēr'' (mother).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mother Online Etymology Dictionary "mother"]&lt;/ref&gt; In antiquity, different explanations were already proffered for the first element of her name. It is possible that ''Da'' ({{lang|grc|Δᾶ}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|da{{=}}2|Δᾶ|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a word which corresponds to ''Ge'' ({{lang|grc|Γῆ}}) in Attic, is the Doric form of ''De'' ({{lang|grc|Δῆ}}), "earth", the old name of the [[chthonic]] earth-goddess, and that Demeter is "Mother-Earth".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Demeter Online Etymology Dictionary "Demeter"]&lt;/ref&gt; This root also appears in the [[Linear B]] inscription ''E-ne-si-da-o-ne'', "earth-shaker", as an aspect of the god [[Poseidon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/mycen.html Adams, John Paul, ''Mycenean divinities''] – List of handouts for California State University Classics 315. Retrieved 7 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[R. S. P. Beekes]].  ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''dā'' element in the name of Demeter is not so simply equated with "earth" according to [[John Chadwick]].&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, ''The Mycenaean World'', Cambridge University Press, 1976, p. 87) "Every Greek was aware of the maternal functions of Demeter; if her name bore the slightest resemblance to the Greek word for 'mother', it would inevitably have been deformed to emphasize that resemblance. [...] How did it escape transformation into ''*Gāmātēr'', a name transparent to any Greek speaker?" Compare the Latin transformation ''[[Jupiter (mythology)|Iuppiter]]'' and ''Diespiter'' vis-a-vis ''*Deus pater''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|*dhmh/thr|Δημήτηρ|ref|mLSJ}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The element ''De''- may be connected with ''Deo'', an [[epithet]] of Demeter&lt;ref&gt;[[Orphic Hymn]] 40 to Demeter (translated by Thomas Taylor: "O universal mother Deo famed, august, the source of wealth and various names".&lt;/ref&gt; probably derived from the Cretan word ''dea'' ({{lang|grc|δηά}}), Ionic ''zeia'' ({{lang|grc|ζειά}})—variously identified with [[emmer]], [[spelt]], [[rye]], or other grains by modern scholars—so that she is the Mother and the giver of food generally.&lt;ref&gt;Compare sanskr. yava, lit. yavai, Δά is probably derived from δέFα :Martin Nilsson, ''Geschichte der Griechischen Religion'', vol. I (Verlag C.H.Beck) pp 461-462.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/prolegomenatostu00harr#page/272/mode/2up Harisson, ''Prolegomena'', p.272]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anax|Wanax]] (''wa-na-ka'') was her male companion (Greek: Πάρεδρος, ''Paredros'') in [[Mycenaean religion|Mycenaean cult]].&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, p.181&lt;/ref&gt; The Arcadian cult  links her to the god [[Poseidon]], who probably substituted  the male companion of the [[Great Goddess]] ; Demeter may therefore be related to a [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Great Goddess]] ([[Cybele]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson, 1967:444&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative Proto-Indo-European etymology comes through Potnia and [[Despoina]], where ''Des-'' represents a derivative of [[PIE]] ''*dem'' (house, dome), and Demeter is "mother of the house" (from [[PIE]] ''*dems-méh₂tēr'').&lt;ref&gt;Frisk, ''Griechisches Etymological Woerterbuch''. Entry 1271&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agricultural deity ==
[[File:Didrachme de l'île de Paros.jpg|thumb|left|[[Greek drachma|Didrachme]] from Paros island, struck at the [[Cyclades]] and representing Demeter]]
[[File:Склеп Деметры.JPG|thumb|A Greek [[fresco]] depicting the goddess Demeter, from [[Panticapaeum]] in the ancient [[Bosporan Kingdom]] (a [[client state]] of the [[Roman Empire]]), 1st century AD, [[Crimea]].]]
According to the Athenian [[rhetorician]] [[Isocrates]], Demeter's greatest gifts to humankind were agriculture, particularly of cereals, and the Mysteries which give the initiate higher hopes in this life and the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isocrates]], ''Panegyricus'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Isoc.+4+27 4.28]: "When Demeter came to our land, in her wandering after the rape of Kore, and, being moved to kindness towards our ancestors by services which may not be told save to her initiates, gave these two gifts, the greatest in the world — the fruits of the earth, which have enabled us to rise above the life of the beasts, and the holy rite, which inspires in those who partake of it sweeter hopes regarding both the end of life and all eternity".&lt;/ref&gt; These two gifts were intimately connected in Demeter's myths and mystery cults. In Hesiod, prayers to [[Zeus]]-Chthonios ([[chthonic]] Zeus) and Demeter help the crops grow full and strong.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]] ''Works and Days'', 465&lt;/ref&gt; Demeter's emblem is the poppy, a bright red flower that grows among the barley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Graves|first=Robert|title=Greek Gods and Heroes|publisher=Dell Laurel-Leaf|year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hesiod]]'s [[Theogony]], Demeter is the daughter of [[Cronus]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]]. At the marriage of [[Cadmus]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]], Demeter lured [[Iasion]] away from the other revelers. They had intercourse in a [[Ridge and furrow|ploughed furrow]] in [[Crete]], and she gave birth to two sons, [[Philomelus]] and [[Plutus|Ploutos]].&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'' 5.125; [[Theogony]] 969 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Her daughter by Zeus was [[Persephone]], Queen of the Underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+912&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130 912]; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0138%3Ahymn%3D2 ''Homeric Hymn to Demeter'' (2)]; Pausnias, ''Description of Greece'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.%208.37.9&amp;lang=original 8.37.9]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Festivals and cults ==
{{Main article|Eleusinian Mysteries|Thesmophoria}}

Demeter's two major festivals were [[sacred mysteries]]. Her [[Thesmophoria]] festival (11–13 October) was women-only.&lt;ref&gt;Benko, Stephen, ''The virgin goddess: studies in the pagan and Christian roots of mariology,'' BRILL, 2004, note 111 on pp. 63 - 4, and p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[Eleusinian mysteries]] were open to initiates of any gender or social class. At the heart of both festivals were myths concerning Demeter as Mother and [[Persephone]] as her daughter.

==Mythology==
=== Demeter and Persephone ===&lt;!-- link to section heading from article Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle, section 'Regeneration'. --&gt;
[[File:Demeter in horse chariot w daughter kore 83d40m wikiC Tempio Y di Selinunte sec VIa.JPG|thumb|left|Demeter drives her horse-drawn chariot containing her daughter [[Persephone|Persephone-Kore]] at [[Selinunte]], Sicily, 6th century BC.]]
Demeter's virgin daughter Persephone was abducted to the underworld by [[Hades]]. Demeter [[Agelasta|searched for her]] ceaselessly, preoccupied with her loss and her grief. The seasons halted; living things ceased their growth, then began to die.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Kerenyi, ''The Gods of the Greeks,'' 1951, pp.232 - 41 and notes 784 - 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with the extinction of all life on earth, [[Zeus]] sent his messenger [[Hermes]] to the underworld to bring Persephone back. [[Hades]] agreed to release her if she had eaten nothing while in his realm; but Persephone had eaten a small number of [[pomegranate]] [[seed]]s. This bound her to Hades and the underworld for certain months of every year, either the dry Mediterranean summer, when plant life is threatened by drought,&lt;ref&gt;As in Burkert, ''Greek Religion'' (Harvard, 1985) p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; or the autumn and winter.&lt;ref&gt;As in [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]&lt;!--a reference is still missing--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There are several variations on the basic myth. In the [[Homeric hymn]] to Demeter, [[Hecate]] assists in the search and later becomes Persephone's underworld attendant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uh.edu/~cldue/texts/demeter.html Homer Hymn to Demeter, trans. Gregory Nagy, lines 50 - 60, 438 - 440.]&lt;/ref&gt; In another, Persephone willingly and secretly eats the pomegranate seeds, thinking to deceive Hades, but is discovered and made to stay. Contrary to popular perception, Persephone's time in the underworld does not correspond with the unfruitful seasons of the ancient [[Greek calendar]], nor her return to the [[Upper World (Greek)|upper world]] with springtime.&lt;ref&gt;Graf, "Demeter" in ''Brill's New Pauly''&lt;/ref&gt; Demeter's descent to retrieve Persephone from the underworld is connected to the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]].[[File:Demeter rejoiced, for her daughter was by her side.jpg|thumb|Demeter rejoiced, for her daughter was by her side.]]{{Clear|left}}

Demeter and her daughter '''Persephone''' were usually called:&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967) ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion'' pp.463, 477&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The goddesses''', often distinguished as "the older" and "the younger" in [[Eleusis]].
* '''Demeters''', in [[Rhodes]] and [[Sparta]]
* '''The thesmophoroi''', "the legislators" in the [[Thesmophoria]].
* '''The Great Goddesses''', in [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]].
* '''The mistresses''' in [[Arcadia]].&lt;ref name=Pausanias515&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].''Description of Greece'' 5.15.4, 5, 6&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Mycenaean civilization|Mycenaean]] [[Pylos]], Demeter and Persephone were probably called "queens" (wa-na-ssoi).&lt;ref name=Mylonas159/&gt;

The myth of the capture of Persephone seems to be pre-Greek. In the Greek version, Ploutos (πλούτος, wealth) represents the wealth of the corn that was stored in underground silos or ceramic jars (''pithoi''). Similar subterranean ''pithoi'' were used in ancient times for funerary practices. At the beginning of the autumn, when the corn of the old crop is laid on the fields, she ascends and is reunited with her mother Demeter, for at this time the old crop and the new meet each other.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sacred-texts.com/cla/gpr/gpr07.htm#page_48 Martin Nilsson, ''Greek Popular Religion''.] pp 48-50&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the personal mythology of [[Robert Graves]],&lt;ref&gt;Graves' work on Greek myth was often criticized; see [[The White Goddess#Criticism]] and [[The Greek Myths#Reception|The Greek Myths]].&lt;/ref&gt; Persephone is not only the younger self of Demeter,&lt;ref&gt;The idea that Kore (the maiden) is not Demeter's daughter, but Demeter's own younger self, was discussed much earlier than Graves, in [[Lewis Richard Farnell]] (1896), [https://books.google.com/books?id=FKVEsNO6wFYC&amp;pg=PA121 ''The Cults of the Greek States'', volume 3, p.121.]&lt;/ref&gt; she is in turn also one of three guises of the [[Triple deity|Triple Goddess]]&amp;nbsp;– Kore (the youngest, the maiden, signifying green young grain), Persephone (in the middle, the nymph, signifying the ripe grain waiting to be harvested), and Hecate (the eldest of the three, the crone, the harvested grain), which to a certain extent reduces the name and role of Demeter to that of group name. Before her abduction, she is called Kore; and once taken she becomes Persephone ('she who brings destruction').&lt;ref&gt;Graves, Robert. ''The Greek Myths''. Penguin, 1990. {{ISBN|0-14-001026-2}}. 24. pp.94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demeter at Eleusis ===
[[File:Eleusis2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eleusinian mysteries|Eleusinian trio]]: [[Persephone]], [[Triptolemos]], and Demeter, on a marble [[bas-relief]] from [[Eleusis]], 440–430 BC]]
[[File:Demeter MKL1888.png|left|thumb|Relief of Demeter in [[Pompeii]] referencing her ancient status of [[mother goddess]] and goddess of agriculture]]
Demeter's search for her daughter Persephone took her to the palace of [[Celeus]], the King of [[Eleusis]] in [[Attica, Greece|Attica]]. She assumed the form of an old woman, and asked him for shelter. He took her in, to nurse [[Demophon of Eleusis|Demophon]] and [[Triptolemus]], his sons by [[Metanira]]. To reward his kindness, she planned to make Demophon immortal; she secretly anointed the boy with [[ambrosia]] and laid him in the flames of the hearth, to gradually burn away his mortal self. But Metanira walked in, saw her son in the fire and screamed in fright. Demeter abandoned the attempt. Instead, she taught Triptolemus the secrets of agriculture, and he in turn taught them to any who wished to learn them. Thus, humanity learned how to plant, grow and harvest grain. The myth has several versions; some are linked to figures such as [[Eleusis (mythology)|Eleusis]], [[Rarus]] and [[Trochilus (mythology)|Trochilus]]. The Demophon element may be based on an earlier folk tale.&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson (1940), p. 50: "The Demophon&lt;!--Demophoon?--&gt; story in Eleusis is based on an older folk-tale motif which has nothing to do with the Eleusinian Cult. It is introduced in order to let Demeter reveal herself in her divine shape".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Demeter Altemps Inv8596.jpg|thumb|Roman copy after a Greek original from the 4th century BC, from the [[National Roman Museum]]]]
Demeter and [[Poseidon]]'s names appear in the earliest scratched notes in [[Linear B]] found at [[Mycenae]] and Mycenaean [[Pylos]]; ''e-ne-si-da-o-ne'' (earth-shaker) for Poseidon, and ''si-to-po-ti-ni-ja'', who is probably related with Demeter.&lt;ref&gt;George Mylonas (1966), "Mycenae and the Mycenean world ". p.159. Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Poseidon carries frequently the title ''wa-na-ka'' (''[[wanax]]'') in [[Linear B]] inscriptions, as king of the underworld, and his title '' E-ne-si-da-o-ne'' indicates his chthonic nature. In the cave of [[Amnisos]] (Crete) ''Enesidaon'' is related with the cult of [[Eileithyia]], the goddess of childbirth.&lt;ref name= Dietriech181&gt;Dietrich pp. 181-185&lt;/ref&gt; She was related with the annual birth of the divine child.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich pp. 141&lt;/ref&gt; During the Bronze Age, a goddess of nature, dominated both in Minoan and Mycenean cult, and ''Wanax'' (''wa-na-ka'') was her male companion (paredros) in Mycenean cult.&lt;ref name=Dietriech181/&gt; She and her paredros survived in the [[Eleusinian mysteries|Eleusinian cult]], where the following words were uttered : " Mighty Potnia bore a strong son"&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich:166-167&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no evidence that originally the name of [[Potnia]] was Demeter.

Tablets from [[Pylos]] record sacrificial goods destined for "the Two Queens and Poseidon" ("to the Two Queens and the King" :''wa-na-ssoi'', ''wa-na-ka-te''). The "Two Queens" may be related with Demeter and [[Persephone]], or their precursors, goddesses who were not associated with Poseidon in later periods.&lt;ref name=Mylonas159/&gt; An exception is the myth of isolated [[Arcadia]] in southern Greece. [[Despoina]], is daughter of Demeter and [[Poseidon]] ''Hippios'', Horse-Poseidon. These myths seem to be connected with the first Greek-speaking people who came from the north during the [[Bronze age]]. Poseidon represents the river spirit of the underworld and he appears as a horse as it often happens in northern-European folklore. He pursues the mare-Demeter and she bears one daughter who obviously originally had the form or the shape of a mare too. Demeter and Despoina were closely connected with springs and animals, related to Poseidon as a God of waters and especially with [[Artemis]], the mistress of the animals and the goddess of, among others, the Hunt.

Demeter as mare-goddess was pursued by Poseidon, and hid from him among the horses of King [[Onkios]], but could not conceal her divinity. In the form of a stallion, Poseidon caught and covered her. Demeter was furious ([[erinys]]) at Poseidon's assault; in this furious form, she is known as Demeter Erinys. But she washed away her anger in the River [[Ladon (river)|Ladon]], becoming ''Demeter Lousia'', the "bathed Demeter".&lt;ref&gt;Other ritually bathed goddesses were Argive [[Hera]] and [[Cybele]]; [[Aphrodite]] renewed her own powers bathing herself in the sea.&lt;/ref&gt; "In her alliance with Poseidon," [[Karl Kerenyi]] noted,&lt;ref&gt;Kerenyi, ''The Gods of the Greeks'', 1951:185.&lt;/ref&gt; "she was [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth]], who bears plants and beasts, and could therefore assume the shape of an ear of [[grain]] or a mare." She bore a daughter [[Despoina]] ({{lang|grc|Δέσποινα}}: the "Mistress"), whose name should not be uttered outside the Arcadian [[Sacred mysteries|Mysteries]],&lt;ref&gt;"In Arcadia she was also a second goddess in the Mysteries of her daughter, the unnameable, who was invoked only as 'Despoina', the 'Mistress'" ([[Karl Kerenyi]], ''Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter''(Princeton University Press) 1967:31f, instancing Pausanias, viii.37.9.&lt;/ref&gt; and a horse named [[Arion (mythology)|Arion]], with a black mane and tail.

In [[Arcadia]], Demeter's mare-form was worshiped into historical times. Her ''[[xoanon]]'' of Phigaleia shows how the local cult interpreted her: a Medusa type with a horse's head with snaky hair, holding a dove and a dolphin, probably representing her power over air and water.&lt;ref&gt;L. H. Jeffery (1976). ''Archaic Greece: The Greek city states c. 800-500 B.C.'' (Ernest Benn Limited) p 23 {{ISBN|0-510-03271-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The second mountain, Mt. Elaios, is about 30 stades from [[Phigalia|Phigaleia]], and has a cave sacred to Demeter Melaine ["Black"]... the Phigalians say, they accounted the cave sacred to Demeter, and set up a [[Xoanon|wooden image]] in it. The image was made in the following fashion: it was seated on a rock, and was like a woman in all respects save the head. She had the head and hair of a horse, and serpents and other beasts grew out of her head. Her [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]] reached right to her feet, and she held a dolphin in one hand, a dove in the other. Why they made the ''[[xoanon]]'' like this should be clear to any intelligent man who is versed in tradition. They say they named her Black because the goddess wore black clothing. However, they cannot remember who made this xoanon or how it caught fire; but when it was destroyed the Phigalians gave no new image to the goddess and largely neglected her festivals and sacrifices, until finally barrenness fell upon the land.|[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]| Description of Greece 8.42.1ff.}}

&lt;!--much of this is duplicative and uneditable:===Corn-Mother and Mother-Earth===
In epic poetry and [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', Demeter is the Corn-Mother, the goddess of cereals who provides grain for bread and blesses its harvesters. This was her main function at [[Eleusis]], and became panhellenic. In [[Cyprus]], "grain-harvesting" was ''damatrizein''. The main theme in the [[Eleusinian]] mysteries was the reunion of [[Persephone]] with her mother Demeter, when new crops were reunited with the old seed, a form of eternity. However, some cults interpreted Demeter as Mother Earth. At Phigaleia in [[Arcadia]], she was represented as an archaised [[Medusa]] type, horse-headed and snake-haired, holding a dove and dolphin, perhaps to symbolize her power over air and water. In the cult of Flya, she was worshiped as [[Anesidora]] (one who sends up gifts from the underworld) and in Sparta as Demeter-Chthonia ([[chthonic]] Demeter).&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias]] I 31,4- III 14,5&lt;/ref&gt; This can explain the name Demetrioi that the Athenians gave to the dead, and probably reflects an ancient cult of the dead, linked to the agrarian-belief that a new life would sprout from the dead body, as a new plant arises from buried seed. This was probably a belief shared by initiates in Demeter's mysteries, as interpreted by [[Pindar]]: "Happy is he who has seen what exists under the earth, because he knows not only the end of life, but also his beginning that the Gods will give". In antiquity Demeter was also ''zeidoros arοura'', the Homeric "Mother Earth [[arura|arοura]]" who gave the gift of cereals (''zeai'' or ''deai'').&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson, (1967), ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion'', C.F.Beck Verlag Munchen, pp 462, 466, 675-676.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

== Titles and functions ==
[[File:Eleusinian hydria Antikensammlung Berlin 1984.46 n2.jpg|thumb|left|Demeter, enthroned and extending her hand in a benediction toward the kneeling [[Metaneira]], who offers the [[wikt:triune|triune]] wheat ({{circa|340 {{small|BC}}}})]]
Demeter's [[epithet]]s show her many religious functions. She was the "Corn-Mother" who blesses the harvesters. Some cults interpreted her as "Mother-Earth". Demeter may be linked to goddess-cults of [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Crete]], and embody aspects of a pre-Hellenic [[Mother Goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;A [[Linear A]] inscription can tentatively be read as DA-MA-TE (KY Za 2), which is possibly the name of the Mother Goddess. [http://www.teicrete.gr/arkalochori/linear-inscription.php]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Linear A is not deciphered: In the [[Linear A]] ([[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]) inscriptions appears often the word ''asasarame'',"mistress" that seems to accompany the names of some goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;Similar with [[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''išhaššara'',"lady" or "mistress".Palmer sees -me as an [[PI]] possesiv-pronoun and interprets it as "my lady" similar with the Hittite ''išhaššaraŝamiŝ''.The name does not seem to have [[PIE]] origin, compare [[Ishara]]-[[Ishtar]]:F.Schachermeyer (1964).''Die Minoische Kultur des alten Kreta''.W.Kohlhammer Verlag Stuttgart. p 263&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; It is possible that the title "Mistress of the labyrinth", which appears in a [[Linear B]] inscription, belonged originally to ''Sito'' ("[she] of the grain"), the [[Mother goddess|Great Mother Demeter]] and that in the [[Eleusinian mysteries]] this title was kept by her daughter [[Persephone]] (Kore or [[Despoina]]).&lt;ref&gt;R.Wunderlich (1975),''The secret of Creta''.Souvenir Press Ltd.London p 319&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no evidence that the name of [[Potnia]] in [[Eleusis]] was originally Demeter. Her other epithets include:

[[File:Triptolemos Louvre G187.jpg|thumb|left|[[Triptolemus]], Demeter and [[Persephone]] by the Triptolemos-painter, c. 470 BC, [[Louvre]]]]
* [[Aganippe]] ("the Mare who destroys mercifully", "Night-Mare")
* [[Potnia]] ("mistress") in the ''[[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn to Demeter]]''. [[Hera]] especially, but also [[Artemis]] and [[Athena]], are addressed as "potnia" as well.
* [[Despoina]] ("mistress of the house"), a Greek word similar to the [[Mycenaean language|Mycenean]] ''potnia''. This title was also applied to Persephone, [[Aphrodite]] and [[Hecate]].
* [[Thesmophoria|Thesmophoros]] ("giver of customs" or even "legislator"), a role that links her to the even more ancient goddess [[Themis]],&lt;ref name=Finley78 /&gt; derived from ''thesmos'', the unwritten law.&lt;ref&gt;L.

(Ernest Benn Limited) p. 42 {{ISBN|0-510-03271-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This title was connected with the [[Thesmophoria]], a festival of secret women-only rituals in [[History of Athens|Athens]] connected with marriage customs.
* [[Erinyes|Erinys]] ("implacable"),&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 8.25.50&lt;/ref&gt; with a function similar with the function of the avenging [[Dike (mythology)|Dike]] (Justice), goddess of moral justice based on custom rules who represents the divine retribution,&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Bowra (1957), ''The Greek Experience''(1957:87, 169).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Erinyes]], female ancient [[chthonic]] deities of vengeance and implacable agents of retribution.
* [[Chloe]] ("the green shoot"),&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias 1.22.3.&lt;/ref&gt; that invokes her powers of ever-returning fertility, as does Chthonia.
* [[chthonic|Chthonia]] ("in the ground"), [[chthonic]] Demeter in Sparta.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 3.14.5&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anesidora ("sending up gifts from the earth") applied to Demeter in Pausanias 1.31.4, also appears inscribed on an Attic ceramic a name for [[Pandora]] on her jar. There was a temple of Demeter under this name in [[Phlius]] in [[Attica]].&lt;ref&gt;Anesidora: inscribed against her figure on a [[White ground technique|white-ground]] ''[[Kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]]'' in the British Museum, B.M. 1881,0528.1, from Nola, painted by the Tarquinia painter, ''ca'' 470–460 BC ([https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=461511&amp;partid=1&amp;searchText=Anesidora+Nola+Tarquinia&amp;fromADBC=ad&amp;toADBC=ad&amp;numpages=10&amp;orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database.aspx&amp;currentPage=1 British Museum on-line catalogue entry])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesychius of Alexandria]] ''s.v.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholiast]], ''On [[Theocritus]]'' ii. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] ("broad face or eyes") at [[Livadeia]] of [[Boeotia]]. She was the nurse of [[Trophonios]] to whom a [[chthonic]] cult and [[oracle]] was dedicated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].''Guide to Greece''.9.39.2-5&lt;/ref&gt;
*Kidaria in the mysteries of Pheneos in Arcadia&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 8.13.13&lt;/ref&gt;  where the priest put on the mask of Demeter kept in a secret place. It seems that the cult was connected with the underworld and with an agrarian magic.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967).''Die Geschichte der Griechiesche Religion'' Vol. I pp 477-478.&lt;/ref&gt;
Demeter might also be invoked in the guises of:
* Malophoros ("apple-bearer" or "sheep-bearer", Pausanias 1.44.3)
* Lusia ("bathing", Pausanias 8.25.8)
* Thermasia ("warmth", Pausanias 2.34.6)

* [[Poppy goddess]]:

[[Theocritus]], wrote of an earlier role of Demeter as a poppy goddess:
:''For the Greeks Demeter was still a poppy goddess''
:''Bearing sheaves and poppies in both hands.'' — ''Idyll'' vii.157

In a clay statuette from Gazi (Heraklion Museum, Kereny 1976 fig 15), the Minoan [[Papaver somniferum|poppy]] goddess wears the seed capsules, sources of nourishment and narcosis, in her diadem. "It seems probable that the Great [[Mother Goddess]], who bore the names Rhea and Demeter, brought the poppy with her from her Cretan cult to [[Eleusinian mysteries|Eleusis]], and it is certain that in the Cretan cult sphere, [[opium]] was prepared from poppies" (Kerenyi 1976, p 24).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6607">The '''Dole effect''', named after [[Malcolm Dole]], describes an inequality in the ratio of the heavy [[isotope]] [[Oxygen-18|&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]] (a "standard" [[oxygen]] atom with two additional [[neutron]]s) to the lighter &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O, measured in the [[atmosphere]] and seawater. This ratio is usually denoted [[δ18O|δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]].

It was noticed in 1935&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dole |first=[[Malcolm Dole|Malcolm]] |authorlink= |year=1936 |title=The Relative Atomic Weight of Oxygen in Water and in Air |journal=Journal of Chemical Physics |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=268–275 |doi=10.1063/1.1749834 |url= |bibcode=1936JChPh...4..268D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morita |first=N. |authorlink= |year=1935 |title=The increased density of air oxygen relative to water oxygen |journal=J. Chem. Soc. Japan |volume=56 |issue= |pages=1291  |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that air contained more &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O than seawater; this was quantified in 1975 to 23.5‰,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kroopnick |first=P. |authorlink= |author2=Craig, H. |year=1972 |title=Atmospheric Oxygen: Isotopic Composition and Solubility Fractionation |journal=Science |volume=175 |issue=4017 |pages=54–55 |doi=10.1126/science.175.4017.54 |url= |pmid=17833979 |bibcode=1972Sci...175...54K }}&lt;/ref&gt; but later refined as 23.88‰ in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barkan |first=E. |authorlink= |author2=Luz, B. |year=2005 |title=High precision measurements of &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O/&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O/&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O ratios in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O |journal=Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. |volume=19 |pages=3737–3742 |doi=10.1002/rcm.2250 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The imbalance arises mainly as a result of [[Plant respiration|respiration in plant]]s and [[Respiration (physiology)|in animals]]. Due to [[thermodynamics]] of isotope reactions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Urey |first=H.C. |authorlink= |year=1947 |title=The thermodynamic properties of isotopic substances |journal=J. Chem. Soc. |volume= |issue= |pages=562–581 |doi=10.1039/JR9470000562 |url= |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt; respiration removes the lighter — hence more reactive — &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O in preference to &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O, increasing the relative amount of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O in the atmosphere.

The inequality is balanced by [[photosynthesis]]. Photosynthesis emits oxygen with the same isotopic composition (i.e. [[δ18O|the ratio between &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O]]) as the water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) used in the reaction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Guy |first=Robert D. |authorlink= |year=1989 |title=Differential fractionation of oxygen isotopes by cyanide-resistant and cyanide-sensitive respiration in plants |journal=Planta |volume=177 |issue= 4|pages=483–491 |doi=10.1007/BF00392616 |url= |display-authors=etal |pmid=24212490}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is independent of the atmospheric ratio. Thus when atmospheric &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O levels are high enough, photosynthesis will act as a reducing factor. However, as a complicating factor, the degree of fractionation (i.e. change in isotope ratio) occurring due to photosynthesis is not ''entirely'' dependent on the water drawn up by the plant, as fractionation can occur as a result of preferential evaporation of {{clarify span|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O - water bearing lighter oxygen isotopes,|strange punctuation; if it means only O-16, then why ''isotopeS''?|date=March 2014}} and other small but significant processes.

==Use of the Dole effect==
Since evaporation causes oceanic and terrestrial waters to have a different ratio of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O to &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O, the Dole effect will reflect the relevant importances of land-based and marine photosynthesis. The complete removal of land-based productivity would result {{clarify span|in a Dole effect shift of -2-3‰ from the current value of 23.5‰|does it mean ''in a negative 2–3‰ shift from the current Dole effect value of 23.5‰''?|date=March 2014}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bender |first=M. |authorlink= |author2=Sowers, T. |author3=Labeyrie, L.  |year=1994 |title=The Dole effect and its variations during the last 130,000 years as measured in the Vostok ice core |journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles |volume=8 |issue= 3|pages=363–376  |url= |doi=10.1029/94GB00724 |bibcode=1994GBioC...8..363B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stability (to within 0.5‰) of the atmospheric &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O to &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O ratio with respect to sea surface waters since the [[interglacial|last interglacial]] (the last 130 000 years), as derived from ice cores, suggests that terrestrial and marine productivity have varied together during this time period.

Millennial variations of the Dole effect were found to be related to abrupt climate change events in the North Atlantic region during the last 60 kyr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Severinghaus | first = J.P. |author2=Beaudette, R. |author3=Headly, M.A. |author4=Taylor, K. |author5=Brook, E.J. | year = 2009 | title = Oxygen-18 of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; records the impact of abrupt climate change on the terrestrial biosphere | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = 5933 | pages = 1431–1434 | doi = 10.1126/science.1169473|bibcode=2009Sci...324.1431S }}&lt;/ref&gt; High correlations of the Dole effect to [[speleothem]] δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O, an indicator for [[monsoon]] precipitation, suggest that it is subject to changes in low-latitude terrestrial productivity. Orbital scale variations of the Dole effect, characterized by periods of 20-100 kyr, respond strongly to Earth's orbital [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] and [[Axial precession (astronomy) |precession]], but not [[obliquity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Landais | first = A. |author2=Dreyfus, G. |author3=Capron, E. |author4=Masson-Delmotte, V. |author5=Sanchez-Goñi, M.F. |author6=Desprat, S. |author7=Hoffmann, G. |author8=Jouzel, J. |author9=Leuenberger, M. |author10= Johnsen, S.  | year = 2010 | title = What drives the millennial and orbital variations of δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;atm&lt;/sub&gt; | journal = Quaternary Sci.

The Dole effect can also be applied as a [[Flow tracer|tracer]] in sea water, with slight variations in chemistry being used to track a discrete "parcel" of water and determine its age.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10795">[[File:Dry river 2.jpg|thumb|A dried-up river in [[Ehrwald]]]]
An '''endangered river''' is one which has the potential to partly or fully dry up, or one that is thought to have [[ecology|ecological]] issues now or in the near future.&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt; Some such issues are natural while others are the direct result of human development. Organisations including the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) have published lists of rivers at risk. The WWF's 2007 list featured the [[Danube]], the [[Nile]], and the [[Rio Grande]] amongst others, stating that these "once great rivers" are in danger and "can no longer be assured of reaching the sea unhindered".&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt; The US [[National Park Service]] reported in 2015 that part of the Rio Grande "often lies dry".&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; Dangers may be the result of the natural change of conditions in the local environment but many are due to human development projects such as [[dam]]s and [[irrigation]]. Humans have also caused significant [[water pollution]] which endangers life which relies upon the water source.

==Importance==
According to the [[World Resources Institute]] (WRI) [[river basin]]s are "indispensable resources for billions of people, companies, farms, and ecosystems" but many suffer from "water stress". It states that numerous major rivers around the world have become depleted to the point that they can fail to reach their destinations.&lt;ref name="WRI14" /&gt; [[Water scarcity]] is a danger to all the life that depends on the source.

==Dangers to rivers==
[[File:Beaver dam in Tierra del Fuego.jpg|thumb|[[Beaver eradication in Tierra del Fuego|Beavers from North America constitute an invasive species]] in [[Tierra del Fuego]].]]
[[River]]s face many dangers, both natural and manmade. [[Climate change]] can have a significant impact on rivers, both positive and negative. This could be seen itself as an indirect result of human developments. An area which has a reduction in rainfall or an increase in temperature can make a river fully or partially dry out. This often means that the water can no longer reach its [[river mouth|mouth]].&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt;

The [[flora]] and [[fauna]] of an area can face change and can have a substantial impact on landscape and local ecology.&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt; [[Invasive species]] can move into an area or be introduced by humans. One particular example of the latter is the case of beavers being introduced into [[Tierra del Fuego]] in 1946. While only 20 animals were transplanted into the area they quickly reproduced with no natural predator to curb numbers. Their effect on the area, through the damaging gnawing of trees and the building of [[beaver dam|their dams]], has been significant enough that humans continue an attempt to undo their mistake with [[Beaver eradication in Tierra del Fuego|a program of beaver eradication]]. The ponds created by the beavers, which now number in the tens of thousands, have greatly contributed to the amount of organic matter retained by the rivers which then causes more problems downstream.&lt;ref name="SA14" /&gt;

===Specific human factors===
Human interference in the form of [[river engineering]] can redirect the flow of the water using [[dam]]s or channelisation.&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt; The increasing demand from [[irrigation|irrigated]] agriculture, continued industrialisation, and residential use heavily impacts upon the health of river systems. This means that many areas face high levels of "baseline water stress".&lt;ref name="WRI14" /&gt; Rivers can be cut off from their [[floodplain]]s and their normal route can be changed or disrupted significantly. If improperly managed this can have a devastating effect on the surrounding area and endanger the plants and animals that depend on them, including humans. [[Water pollution]] is another artificial danger which can be a serious threat to wildlife and human health.&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt; The [[Colorado River]] runs from the [[Rocky Mountain National Park]] in [[Colorado]] through four other states, parts of [[Mexico]], and then on to the [[Gulf of California]]. Due to the human demands for water very little reaches Mexico and what does is often polluted.&lt;ref name="MNNcol" /&gt; The [[Teesta River]] faces similar issues. The river flows through India and into Bangladesh, but India's water demands led to the part of the river in Bangladesh to dry up in 2018. If the situation continues it could be catastrophic for the local ecosystem.&lt;ref name="DT18" /&gt;

[[Image:Big Bend National Park - Rio Grande riverbed with cracked mud.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Rio Grande]] occasionally runs dry in [[Big Bend National Park]].]]
The [[Rio Grande Project]] was an irrigation, [[hydroelectricity]], [[flood control]], and [[Interbasin transfer|interbasin water transfer]] project serving the upper [[Rio Grande]] basin in the southwestern United States. It was completed in 1952 and has had a significant impact on the surrounding area. In the past, the river was wide, deep and fast-flowing in its section through Texas, where it forms a large part of the [[Mexico – United States border]]. [[Illegal immigration to the United States|Illegal immigrants]] once had to swim across the river at the border, but with the river so low immigrants need only wade across for most of the year. After leaving [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] the Rio Grande often runs dry because so much water has been diverted away for human use.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; Other than extensive diversions, exotic introduced, fast-growing and water-consuming plants, such as [[Eichhornia crassipes|water hyacinth]] and [[hydrilla]], are also leading to reduced flows. The United States government has recently attempted to slow or stop the progress of these weeds by [[Biological pest control|introducing]] insects and fish that feed on the invasive plants.&lt;ref name="bnet" /&gt;

==Reports==
[[File:Citarum River pollution, 2009.jpg|thumb|Pollution on the [[Citarum River]]]]
In 2014 a [[Channel 4]] report suggested that the [[Indonesia]]n [[Citarum River]], forty miles east of [[Jakarta]], may be the most polluted river in the world. Running from [[Wayang-Windu|Mount Wayang]] to the [[Java Sea]], there are over 30 million residents who rely on the river. Rapid [[industrialisation]] has had such a harmful effect that the river's surface cannot be seen for the waste and detritus floating on top of it.&lt;ref name="Teleg14" /&gt;

===World Wildlife Fund report===
The WWF published on their website the "10 Rivers most at Risk", a report from March 2007. They based their criteria on major rivers which already suffer or are particularly likely in the future to suffer from six key threats: dams and infrastructure, excessive water extraction, climate change, invasive species, over-fishing, and pollution. They noted that some of the greatest rivers "can no longer be assured of reaching the sea unhindered". The ten rivers which most concerned them are:&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt;
{{columns-list|

*[[Río de la Plata|La Plata]]
*[[Danube]]
*[[Rio Grande]]
*[[Ganges]]
*[[Murray–Darling basin]]
*[[Indus River]]
*[[Nile]]
*[[Yangtze]]
*[[Mekong]]
}}

===American Rivers reports===
Each year [[American Rivers]] publishes a list containing ten of "America's Most Endangered Rivers". In 2018 its criteria focused on "threats [to rivers] from the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]]" and they selected the [[Sunflower River|Big Sunflower River]] as the one most endangered using their criteria. The river is one of the main [[tributary|tributaries]] of the [[Yazoo River]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Mississippi]] but is threatened by the Yazoo Backwater Area Pumping Plant project which they say has the potential to damage 200,000 acres of important [[wetland]].&lt;ref name="AR2018" /&gt;

===World Resources Institute project===
The World Resources Institute's Aqueduct project evaluated, mapped, and rated the state of the water supplies for 100 river basins in areas of high population. Their list highlighted the dangers to the [[Qom (River)|Qom River]], [[Yongding River]], [[Brantas River]], and [[Hari (Afghanistan)|Heray Rud River]] amongst others.&lt;ref name="WRI14" /&gt;

Despite abundant natural resources and a relatively small population, [[New Zealand]] is a net importer of energy, in the form of [[petroleum]] products. The ratio of non-renewable and [[renewable energy]] sources was fairly consistent from 1975 to 2008, with about 70 percent of primary energy supply coming from [[hydrocarbon]] fuels. This ratio decreased to about 60 percent in 2014.&lt;ref name="Energy2015" /&gt; The proportion of non-renewable energy varies annually, depending on water flows into hydro-electricity lakes and demand for energy.&lt;ref name='enz2007'&gt;{{cite book| publisher = Ministry for the Environment| isbn =  978-0-478-30191-5

{{main|Mining in New Zealand}}
[[File:NZCoalProduction.png|thumb|right|400px|New Zealand Coal Production, 1878 - 2014.&lt;ref name="Energy2015" /&gt;]]
Coal is produced from 18 opencast mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nzpam.govt.nz/our-industry/nz-minerals/minerals-data/coal/operating-mines/| title=Operating coal mine production figures| publisher=New Zealand Petroleum and Minerals| date=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 80% of New Zealand's coal reserves are contained in Southland lignite deposits. Most coal production is of bituminous and sub-bituminous coals, and most of this is exported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/energy/energy-data-modelling/statistics/coal| title=Coal| work=Energy Statistics| publisher=MBIE| date=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oil and gas ===
{{main|Oil and gas industry in New Zealand}}
Oil and gas is produced from 21 petroleum licenses / permits, all in the Taranaki basin.&lt;ref name="CM-p"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crownminerals.govt.nz/cms/petroleum/overview |title=Petroleum Overview |publisher=Crown Minerals, Ministry of Economic Development|date=26 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most important fields are [[Kapuni]], [[Maui gas field|Maui]], [[Pohokura field|Pohokura]] and [[Kupe field|Kupe]]. Exploration for oil and gas reserves includes the [[Great South Basin]] and offshore areas near Canterbury and Gisborne. Reticulated natural gas is available in most major North Island towns and cities.

=== Renewable energy ===
{{main|Renewable energy in New Zealand}}
Approximately 40% of primary energy is from renewable energy sources. Approximately 80% of electricity comes from renewable energy, primarily [[hydroelectric power in New Zealand|hydropower]] and [[geothermal power in New Zealand|geothermal power]].&lt;ref name="Energy2015" /&gt; Studies have shown that it is technically feasible to provide 100% of the electricity demand by renewable power without risking with shortages in energy supply.&lt;ref&gt;Mason et al., ''A 100% renewable electricity generation system for New Zealand utilising hydro, wind, geothermal and biomass resources.''

In terms of [[energy intensity]], New Zealand is just a little lower than the [[list of countries by energy intensity|global average]].

=== Electrical energy ===
{{main|Electricity sector in New Zealand}}
Electrical energy in New Zealand is mainly derived from renewable energy sources such as from hydropower, geothermal power and wind energy. The large share of [[renewable energy]] sources makes New Zealand one of the most sustainable countries in terms of energy generation. Electricity demand increased by an average of 2.1% per year from 1974 to 2008 and since then has been relatively constant overall.&lt;ref name="Energy2015" /&gt;

== Governmental jurisdiction ==
The [[Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment]] is responsible for economic issues surrounding energy use and the [[Ministry for the Environment (New Zealand)|Ministry for the Environment]] addresses the [[Environmental degradation|environmental impact]] of energy use in New Zealand. Exploration and production of fossil fuels comes under Crown Minerals, a division of the Ministry of Economic Development. The [[Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority]] is responsible for preparing a statutory national energy efficiency and conservation strategy for approval by the administering Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2000/0014/latest/DLM54984.html |title=Section 13.

[[File:Sita at ashokavana.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Sita at Ashokavana under Ashoka tree (''[[Saraca asoca]]'') in epic [[Ramayana]]. [[Hanuman]] is seen on the tree.]]
'''Flora of the Indian epic period''' can be a tool to study the [[ancient history|antiquity]] of [[Indian epics]] as these do not record time scales of the incident mentioned in these. The [[flora]] of an area or of time period, refers to all plant life occurring in an area or time period, especially the naturally occurring or [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] plant life.
[[File:Razmnama Bhishma.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Bhishma on his death-bed of arrows with the [[Pandavas]] and [[Krishna]] - Folio from the ''[[Razmnama]]''(1761 - 1763), Persian translation of the Mahabharata, commissioned by Mughal emperor [[Akbar]]. The Pandavas are dressed in Persian armour and robes.{{clarify|date=January 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantcultures.org/pccms/action/showItem?id=340 Plant Cultures - picture details&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113221249/http://www.plantcultures.org/pccms/action/showItem?id=340 |date=2007-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Why does Mughal artistic depiction of mythology make this useful --&gt;]]

The ancient{{clarify|date=January 2015}}&lt;!-- how old --&gt; [[Sanskrit epics]], the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]], also termed Itihāsa (History) or Mahākāvya ("Great Compositions"), refer to forest and plant life at various places. The language of these texts is  the "[[Epic Sanskrit]]". The importance of forests in Indian epics can be understood from the fact that each epic devotes one book to the forests. In [[Mahabharata]] it is the [[Aranyaka Parva]] (also [[Vana Parva]], [[Aranya Parva]]) (The Book of the Forest) which mentions the period of twelve years spent by Pandavas in exile in the forest (aranya). The divisions of [[Ramayana]] into Kandas (Books) also includes one Kanda known as [[Aranya Kanda]] – Book of the Forest. In Ramayana [[Kishkindha Kanda]] – Book of [[Kishkindha]] also discusses the [[geography]] and [[forestry]] of the region.

== Man and environment ==
The evolution of life on earth in geological ages indicates that man evolved only a million years ago when he lived in dense forests along with other denizens. Palaeo-botanists have examined the fossils of plants found in rocks of various ages and deduced what kind of vegetation grew in those particular geological periods. Thus Dr. [[Birbal Sahni]] concluded from the [[fossils]] found in inter-trappean rocks that at that time estuarine conditions prevailed in [[India]], and the [[flora]] belonged to the genera of [[plants]] found in [[London clay]]. These plants must have [[Seed dispersal|migrated]] to [[India]] by way of the [[Tethys Sea]] which stretched along the northern edge of the [[Gondwana]] land before the uplift of the [[Himalayas]]. It has also been proved that [[Kashmir]] and [[Rajasthan]] once had a [[tropical forest]], which later receded as a result of [[glaciation]] and the upthrust of the Himalayas. Prior to this upheaval, the [[Ganges]] drained northwards into the [[Sindhu]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;!-- this is ridiculous, the Ganges was produced only after the Indian plate met the Asian mainland--&gt; By this time man had already been evolved.{{clarify|date=January 2015}}&lt;!-- yes, but where --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K P Sagreiya: Forests and Forestry, National Book Trust, India, 2005, {{ISBN|81-237-1126-3}}, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;{{refimprove|date=January 2015}}

The ancient and [[prehistoric]] man has lived in [[symbiosis]] with the [[Natural environment|environment]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In the neolithic age, [[Archaic humans|primitive man]] lived in [[dense forests]], on [[trees]] or in [[natural caves]], and subsisted on [[leaves]], [[fruits]], and [[root]]s of [[plants]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} He used fire for keeping off the dangerous animals of the [[forest]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;K P Sagreiya: Forests and Forestry, National Book Trust, India, 2005, {{ISBN|81-237-1126-3}}, pp.4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''In [[Geological]] Ages''': [[palaeo-botanical]] evidence testifies to the fact that there were dense [[forests]] in [[India]]{{clarify|date=January 2015}} &lt;!-- India political?? --&gt; in the [[Permian period]], 250 million years ago. A fossilized trunk of a tree found in the [[Raniganj]] coal-field is nearly 30 m long and 75&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter at the butt-end and 35&amp;nbsp;cm at the top-end. It has been named by Dr. [[Birbal Sahni]] as [[Dadoxylon]], an extinct genus of plants. [[Fossil wood]] is found in several places in [[Madhya Pradesh]] and in the [[Siwalik hills]] along the [[Himalayas]].{{clarify|date=January 2015}}&lt;!-- put in the geological epochs here please --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K P Sagreiya: Forests and Forestry, National Book Trust, India, 2005, {{ISBN|81-237-1126-3}}, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

Man was evolved in the beginning of [[Pleistocene Age]], only about a million years ago. At this time India had thick [[forests]] except in [[Rajasthan]] and parts of [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]] which lay buried under a [[swamp]], the remnant of the receding [[Tethys Sea]].

'''In Historical Times''': Man progressed rapidly in historical times, and began to live in organized societies, constructed shelters using wood bark, etc. and soon took to farming and domestication of animals. [[Archaeological]] evidence shows that the [[Rajasthan]] swamps existed till as late as 4000 BC, when [[Mohenjodaro]] culture flourished in the outskirts of [[Lothal]] in [[Gujarat]]. In these marshes grew stout reeds which were used by [[Chalcolithic]] people to cover dead bodies. The adjoining forest contained [[rhinoceros]]es and [[crocodile]]s of which we find replicas on the seals. At this time trees must have been felled by [[axe]]s of flint and [[bronze]], as [[iron]] had not yet been used. After the disappearance of this civilization-the reasons for which are still unknown-the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Aryans]] started coming into [[India]], from 2000 BC. They introduced the use of [[iron]] for making axes, javelins, ploughs, etc.&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"&gt;K P Sagreiya: Forests and Forestry, National Book Trust, India, 2005, {{ISBN|81-237-1126-3}}, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that at this period a [[Dravidian civilization]] of a high order flourished in the country, with its roots in the far south, which apparently lived in consonance with the thick extensive [[forest]] and its [[wildlife]]. The [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Aryans]] were primarily [[pastoral]] people. To construct shelters for themselves and for their domesticated animals they cleared the [[forests]] wherever they went. But even so, being worshippers of [[Nature]], they preferred for their abodes, and even for their educational centres, sylvan surroundings and inspiring landscape. It is in such setting that the [[Vedas]], the [[Upanishads]] and the [[Aranyakas]] were composed which sing the glory of the Creator and lay down recepts of conduct for man to live righteously.&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"/&gt;
[[Image:Burning of Khandava.jpg|right|thumb|300px| The forest of Khandava near [[Yamuna]], being burnt by [[Arjuna]] and [[Krishna]] ]]

Human population at this period was very small, and forests were still plentiful. When the great epic [[Ramayana]] was written there were still dense forests in [[Naimisharanya]], [[Chitrakoot Dham (Karwi)|Chitrakoot]], [[Dandakaranya]], and [[Panchavati]] which abounded in [[wildlife]]. But by the time the [[Mahabharata]] was compiled, onslaughts had been made on [[forests]] and we read of the burning of the [[Khandava Vana]]. To arrest such vandalism, which was adversely affecting the life of the people, some wise ancestor of ours must have declared cutting of trees a sin and planting and protecting them an act of piety. Several useful species of [[plants]] were thus saved from extinction, such as the [[Banyan]], the [[Sacred fig|Pipal]], the [[Bael|Bel]], etc. Even then some disappeared in course of time from particular areas, such as the [[Neolamarckia cadamba|Kadam]], the [[Saraca asoca|Ashok]], and the [[Bamboo]]s from [[Vrindavan]].

The chronicles of [[China|Chinese]] pilgrims mention dense Indian forests in birthplace of [[Lord Krishna]]. Records relating to the invasion of [[Alexander the great]] in 326 BC mention the existence of almost impenetrable forests along the [[Indus]].
Later, in [[Kautilya]]'s times protection of forests, planting Of new species of trees, and preservation of wildlife were considered desirable, and a special officer was appointed for the purpose. By the time of [[Emperor Ashoka]], heavy inroads had already been made into the [[forests]] and their absence begun to be feft. Therefore, as his rock edicts record, this far-sighted monarch ordered that useful trees be planted along the roads and on camping grounds. He also encouraged the cultivation of exotic [[medicinal plants]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;K P Sagreiya: Forests and Forestry, National Book Trust, India, 2005, {{ISBN|81-237-1126-3}}, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shershah Suri]] planted trees along the [[Delhi]]-[[Patna]] Highway. The [[Mughal (tribe)|Mughal]]s were not forest-minded as such, but they created exquisite gardens. [[Emperor Jahangir]] introduced the famous [[Platanus orientalis|Chinar]] tree in the [[valley of Kashmir]] which has now become synonymous with [[Kashmir]]. The Mughals also maintained large ''Shikargahs'' for hunting. The ''[[Ain-e-Akbari]]'' records that elephants roamed in the forests as far west as [[Mhow]] near [[Indore]]. But a century later [[Aurangzeb]] found only [[scrub forests]] near [[Burhanpur]]. The [[Maratha]]s and the [[Gonds]] planted mangoes and other useful trees along their marching routes and halting places, some of which are still surviving.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"/&gt;

The remains of extinct creatures discovered in the upper layers of the [[Sivaliks]] range and in other parts of [[India]] give us a glimpse of the wonderful wealth of animal life that flourished here in the tertiary period. [[Mastodon]]s and great herds of [[elephant]]s of many species trumpeted and tramped through the [[swamps]] and reedy [[forest]]s of this region. With them lived [[hippopotamuses]], [[rhinoceroses]] of various species, and a colossal four-horned ruminants, the [[Sivatherium]]. The one-horned rhinoceros, as born out by the seals of the '''[[Harappan culture]]''', was once found as far west as [[Rajasthan]].&lt;ref&gt;K P Sagreiya: Forests and Forestry, National Book Trust, India, 2005, {{ISBN|81-237-1126-3}}, pp. 98-99&lt;/ref&gt;

The rich heritage of [[wildlife]] came down to us through the ages mainly because of the deep-rooted [[Indian tradition]] of compassion for all life in general. Moreover, animals have been closely associated with our [[folklore]] and legends. [[Kautilya]]'s [[Arthashastra]], written in the 3rd century BC refers to definite administrative arrangements for preservation of [[wildlife]]. Special areas, called [[Abhayaranya]]s, were set aside for their protection. [[Emperor Ashoka]] introduced game laws, ordained the preservation of forests, and prohibited killing of animals.&lt;ref&gt;K P Sagreiya: Forests and Forestry, National Book Trust, India, 2005, {{ISBN|81-237-1126-3}}, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carbon dating'''

[[Carbon dating]] method can be used to determine the age of living trees in the past. This technique will give age of a tree when it became dead wood. It has become thus possible from specimens of wood, charcoal, etc., found in excavations by [[archaeologist]]s to fix period when a particular [[prehistoric]] culture flourished. The [[Indian cultures]] have been dated as under:&lt;ref&gt;K P Sagreiya: Forests and Forestry, National Book Trust, India, 2005, {{ISBN|81-237-1126-3}}, pp. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vedic culture ==

India was one of the foremost developed countries in ancient times. Learned persons of [[vedic culture]] were quite aware regarding unimaginable obligation of plants for the very sustenance of animal life. Though not scientifically proven at that time, they knew that the air we breath remains pleasant by surrounding plants. There are a number of verses in ancient literature depicting this generosity of vegetable kingdom. They have also realised that there is no conduct of life where the [[plant kingdom]] does not make its contribution like [[food]], [[fuel]], [[Structure|shelter]], [[fiber]], [[fodder]] and [[medicine]]. No wonder that many such plants species have been revered as God.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;S G Joshi, Medicinal Plants, Oxford &amp; IBH Publishing Co. Pvt. Ltd. New Delhi, 2004, {{ISBN|81-204-1414-4}}, p.xi&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medicinal plants ==
The ancient scholars in [[Sanskrit language]] studied the plants mainly for medicinal purposes. From time immemorial many medicinal plants are well known in this country. Use of herbal medicine can be traced to the remote past. One of the oldest treaties in the world is [[Rigveda]] (4500 BC-1000 BC)  where healing properties of some herbs are mentioned in the form of sonnets, which were often recited in religious rituals. Later on a special faculty was developed known as [[Ayurveda]], mostly dealing with human philosophy of health including utilization of [[medicinal plants]] for restoring normal physical fitness.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;
[[File:Arrowleaf.jpg|thumb|[[Sida acuta]] Burm]]
[[File:Sida acuta (Jangli-methi) in Hyderabad, AP W2 IMG 0084.jpg|thumb|[[Sida rhombifolia]] Linn]]
There used to be regular rapport between [[Wise old man|sages]] of various communities interested in miraculous effects of [[herbal medicine]]. There are records in ancient scripts regarding periodic conferences, seminars and also workshops in selected areas where exchange of knowledge was often manifested. Even it was mentioned that women scholars like [[Maitrai]], [[Gargi]] contributed some knowledge about [[medicinal plants]] and their maintenance. During the glorious days of [[Buddha]] philosophy (600 BC- 400 AD) there was friendly mingling of therapeutic values of plants, through religious norms were different. Scholars practicing medicine were quite familiar with wild medicinal plants growing in [[jungles]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;

The further advancement of this process was materialization of [[Susruta Samhita]] and [[Charaka Samhita]] (1000 BC)  which incorporates comprehensive chapters on the therapeutic use of various [[plant species]]. These treaties deal with about 700 [[drugs]], some of these are not [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] to [[Indian subcontinent]]. The invaluable knowledge of medicine was composed in lyrical [[sutra]]s (Sonnets) which often reveal valuable information in few words.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;

Later on number of new plant species were added to the then known [[pharmacopoeia]] of [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] [[medicinal plants]]. Attempts were also made to identify the required medicinal plant species by observing their [[exomorphic]] characters. For example, plant species like [[Bala (plant)|Bala]] ([[Sida acuta]] Burm.); [[Atibala]] ([[Sida rhombifolia]] Linn.); [[Nagabala]] ([[Sida spinosa]] Linn.) and [[Bhubala]] ([[Sida veronicaefolia]] Lam.) were named and grouped together under one class. In modern classification all these belong to [[Hibiscus]] ([[Malvaceae]]) family. Indeed, Indian scholars do have realised the importance of correct identity of plants and that the knowledge of diagnostic external [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] characters are essential requirements for that purpose. But they could not imagine the use of [[Binomial system of nomenclature]] of the plants and thereby fixing absolute identity of the concerned plant material. Instead of that they have started giving various names to the same plant species by considering broad features like shape, color of flowers, smell, taste, along with local names based on plant profile and [[mythological]]
folklores in various regional languages. For example, Krisna Tulsi (''[[Ocimum sanctum]]'' L.) have 52 different names in various Indian dialects. Such trend of thinking became prelude to more confusion while undertaking any research project on indigenous Indian plants.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;

== Puranic literature ==
[[Puranic]] [[cosmography]] divides our earth into seven concentric [[dvipa|island]]s. They are separated  by the seven encircling [[samudra|sea]]s.  Seven intermediate oceans consist of salt-water, sugarcane juice, wine, [[ghee]], [[curd]], milk and water respectively.,&lt;ref&gt;Agni Purana 108.1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matsya Purana 121-122&lt;/ref&gt; All these [[dvipa]]s are named after [[tree]]s/[[plant]]s in [[Sanskrit]]. The seven [[dvipa]]s are:
[[File:Syzygium cumini Bra30.png|thumb|Jambu leaves ([[Syzygium cumini]])]]
'''1.[[Jambudvipa|Jambu]] (जम्बुद्वीप)''' - Continent Jambudvipa named after Jambū (जंबू) trees, ''[[Syzygium cumini]]'' (Indian Blackberry), is also known as ''Sudarshanadvipa'', forms the innermost concentric island in the above scheme. The fruits of the Jambu tree are said to be as large as elephants and when they become rotten and fall upon the crest of the mountains, a river of juice is formed from their expressed juice. The river so formed is called Jambunadi (Jambu river) and flows through Jambudvipa, whose inhabitants drink its waters. Insular continent Jambudvipa is said to comprise nine ''varsas'' (zones) and eight significant ''mountains''. The  insular continent Jambudvipa forms the innermost [[concentric]] [[island]] in the scheme of continents. Jambudvipa includes nine countries (varṣa) and nine mountains.  The land of ''Illa-vrta'' lies at the center of Jambudivipa at whose center is located [[Mount Meru]].

[[File:Pipal.jpg|thumb|left|The Plaksha (''[[Ficus religiosa]]'') leafe]]
'''2.[[Plaksa|Plaksha]] (प्लक्षद्वीप)''' -  [[Plaksa]] is a possible Sanskrit term for the sacred fig of which botanical name is ''[[Ficus religiosa]]''. According to Macdonell and Keith (1912), it rather denotes the wavy-leaved Fig tree (Ficus infectoria). The continent Plaksha is said to be along the western border of [[Jambudvipa]]. [[Vishnu Purana]] says that the Plaksha continent encircles Jambudvipa. In Hindu texts, the Plaksa tree is associated with the source of the [[Sarasvati River]]. The [[Skanda Purana]] states that the Sarasvati originates from the water pot of [[Brahma]] and flows from Plaksa on the Himalayas. According to Vamana Purana 32.1-4, the Sarasvati was rising from the Plaksa tree (Pipal tree).&lt;ref&gt;D.S. Chauhan in Radhakrishna, B.P. and Merh, S.S. (editors): Vedic Sarasvati, 1999, p.35-44&lt;/ref&gt; Plaksa Pra-sravana denotes the place where the Sarasvati appears.&lt;ref&gt;Pancavimsa Brahmana, Jaiminiya Upanisad Brahmana, Katyayana Srauta Sutra, Latyayana Srauta; Macdonell and Keith 1912&lt;/ref&gt; In the Rigveda Sutras, Plaksa Pra-sravana refers to the source of the Sarasvati.&lt;ref&gt;Asvalayana Srauta Sutra, Sankhayana Srauta Sutra; Macdonell and Keith 1912, II:55&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Semal (Bombax ceiba) leaves (back side) in Kolkata W IMG 4135.jpg|thumb|Śalmalī (शाल्मली) (''[[Bombax ceiba]]'') tree leaves]]

'''3.[[Salmali]]dvipa (शाल्मलीद्वीप)'''	- The continent derives its name from '''Śalmalī (शाल्मली)''' tree in [[sanskrit]] with Botanical name	''[[Bombax ceiba]]'',  commonly known as cotton tree or tree cotton. This tropical tree has a straight tall trunk and its leaves are deciduous in winter. Red flowers with 5 petals appear in the spring before the new foliage. Salmalidvipa is mentioned in Puranas as ''parvata'' touching the ''Ikshurasoda samudra''.

'''4.[[Desmostachya bipinnata|Kushadvipa]] (कुशद्वीप)''' - The continent derives its name from '''Kusha (कुश)''' grass, which has Botanical name ''[[Desmostachya bipinnata]]''. The author of [[Vayu Purana]] uses the name [[Kumuda]]-dvipa for Kusha-dvipa (Vayu I.48.34-36). '[[Kumuda]]' is also a Puranic name of a mountain forming the northern buttress of the [[Mount Meru]] (i.e. [[Pamirs]]). In anterior [[Epic India|Epic Age]], Kumuda was the name given to high table-land of the [[Tartary]] located to north of the [[Himalaya]] range from which the [[Aryan]] race may have originally pushed their way southwards into Indian peninsula and preserved the name in their traditions as a relic of old mountain worship.&lt;ref&gt;O. Thompson, A History of Ancient Geography, London 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Kumuda-dvipa lay close north to the Pamirs. Lying in the Transoxiana (in Saka-dvipa), this Komuda or Kumuda-dvipa of the Puranic texts is often identified as the ancient [[Kambojas|Kamboja]] land which corresponds to the Parama Kamboja referred to in the [[Sabha Parava]] of [[Mahabharata]].
[[File:Egretta thula1.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The ''Krauncha'' - Snowy Egret, Egretta thula]]

'''5.[[Kraunchadvipa]] (क्रौंचद्वीप)''' - The continent derives its name from  [[Sanskrit]] word '''Krauncha (क्रौंच)''' used for [[Curlew]]-[[heron]]. Krauncha-Vyuha (क्रौंच व्‍युह) has been mentioned in [[Mahabharata war]] as a  military formation on a pattern supposed to resemble a [[heron]]. In the Krauncha island, there is a mountain called Maha-krauncha that is a mine of all kinds of gems. Mahabharata mentions [[Kinnara]]s and [[Vidyadhara]]s living in Krauncha mountain (in Himachal Pradesh ) in the [[Himalaya]]s (9,16).

[[File:Flower, fruit &amp; leaves (Tectona Grandis) I IMG 8818.jpg|thumb|Flower, fruit &amp; leaves of ''[[Tectona grandis]]'' (Shāka) tree]]

'''6.[[Shakadvipa]] (शाकद्वीप)''' - The continent derives its name from '''Shāka (शाक)''' tree, Botanical name ''[[Tectona grandis]]'', a tall deciduous tree with rounded crown. Surrounded by the sea of whey is Shakdvipa  with an extent of thirty-two lakh [[Yojan]]s. It has a huge tree of [[Shaka]], hence its name. With a sweet fragrance of this tree, the whole island emits a pleasant scent. The ruler of this island, Medhatithi was also a son of Priyvrata. He too had seven sons- Purojav, Manojav, Pawamana, Dhumranik, Chitraref, Bahurup and Vishwdhar. They were made the rulers of the seven divisions of the island. People of the island use Pranayama to weaken their [[Rajas|Rajoguna]] and [[Tamas (philosophy)|Tamoguna]], and worship [[Hari]] (Vishnu) in [[Vayu]] (form) through meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Bhagavad Gita (5.20.3-42)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Visnu Purana]]:  "Shakdvipa located inside Chira sea and Shakdwipis are friends"&lt;ref&gt;[http://vishnu-purana.puranas.org/ The Puranas: Vishnu Purana&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mahabharata]] 6.604 = Bhagavad Gita 5.20.3-42: "In [[Shakdvipa]], caste system is same as [[Jambudvipa]].

[[File:Nelumno nucifera open flower - botanic garden adelaide2.jpg|thumb|Pushkara (''[[Nelumbo nucifera]]'') flower]]

'''7.[[Pushkar]]advipa (पुष्करद्वीप)''' - The continent derives its name from plant named '''Pushkara (पुष्कर)''', Botanical name ''[[Nelumbo nucifera]]'', a handsome aquatic herb, Native to Greater India and commonly cultivated in water gardens, the lotus is the national flower of [[India]] and [[Vietnam]]. It is Native of [[China]], [[Japan]] also. Grown throughout warmer parts of India. Pushkaradvipa may probably refer to [[Pushkar]], a town in the state of Rajasthan in India. [[Hindu]]s believe that the gods released a swan with a [[lotus (genus)|lotus]] in its beak and let it fall on earth where [[Brahma]] would perform a grand yagna. The place where the lotus fell was called [[Pushkar]].

==Origin of Saka ==

According to Hukum Singh Pawar (Pauria) Some writers think that [[Saka]] (Scythian) is a Sanskrit word which means Sagwan or [[Teak]] (''Tectona grandis''), generally grown in monsoon region, the shape of which and that of its river deltas was like that of '''teak leaf'''.,&lt;ref&gt;Satya Sharva, Sakas in Ind., New Delhi, 1981, pp. 3f; cf. also Mat. Pur. 123.36. Viswa Prakasa Kosha, p.4, shloka no. 25; p. 5, shloka no. 35, Nanarthasabad Kosha, p.3, st. 35 and 36; p. 87, shloka no. 36&lt;/ref&gt; and the people popularly known as [[Saka]]s used to be the inhabitants of this land. S. M. Ali &lt;ref&gt;Geog. of the Puranas, pp. 39&lt;/ref&gt; identifies [[Shakadvipa]] with land mass in the south-east of [[Meru, Hazaribagh|Meru]] &lt;ref&gt;([[Mahabharata|MBT]], Ch. 14.21-25)&lt;/ref&gt; which falls climatically in the monsoon region and teak is its distinctive tree in its natural and artificial vegetation. The [[Sapta Sindhu]], original home of [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Aryans]], in the south of [[Meru, Hazaribagh|Meru]], we find that the country fulfills all the requisites of [[Shakadvipa]], viz, teak leaf shape of the country or the area abundant in teak vegetation, as well as that of the deltas of [[Sarasvati]] and [[Indus]] river. The [[Mahabharata]]'s reading, alluded to above, that there was [[Sagala|Sakala]]-dvipa, the name of which is attributed to the Sakas, in the Sapta Sindhu, evidently carries much weight. There is every possibility that the people of Sapta Sindhu, as a whole, might have besides their eponymous and ethnoyms, been known as [[Saka]]s also.&lt;ref&gt;Hukum Singh Pawar (Pauria):The Jats, Their Origin, Antiquity and Migrations, pp.207-208&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flora of Ramayana epic ==
The Indian epic [[Ramayana]] discusses the [[Flora and fauna]] of the places visited by [[Rama]]. Ramayana in [[Bala Kanda]] Sarga 24 mentions the crossing over of the River Ganges, sage Vishvamitra sails [[Rama]] and [[Laxmana]] through its confluence with River Sarayu, which flows at their capital Ayodhya. The sage leads them to a deadly forest on the other bank of River Ganges and narrates about the provinces Malada and Karusha. Here shlokas 12-18 mention about the forest trees and plants of the region.

[[Aranya Kanda]] Sarga 11 mentions the Stories of Sages Mandakarani and [[Agastya]]. It depicts the propitious nature of [[Agastya]]’s hermitage. Here shlokas 46, 49, 74-76 mention many trees and plants. [[Aranya Kanda]] Sarga 15 mentions about [[Panchavati]] situated on Godavari River in Nasik district in Maharashtra. Here shlokas 12-18 mention the biodiversity of the area around [[Pampa Lake]]. [[Aranya Kanda]] Sarga 73 writes how Kabandha extols [[Pampa Lake]]  and details [[Rama]] about the course to be adopted to proceed to Mt. [[Rishyamuka]] to befriend [[Sugreeva]]. He details about [[Matanga Jataka|Matanga]] hermitage where shlokas 2-5 describe a large number of trees.

Ramayan-[[Kishkindha Kanda]] Sarga 1 gives a description of [[Pampa Lake]] and writes about many forest trees in shlokas 73-83. In [[Kishkindha Kanda]] Sarga 40, [[Sugreeva]] orders vanara-s to search east under the leadership of Vinata, a mighty vanara. Here Sugreeva commissioning Vinata explains the topography and geography of Eastern side of the [[Jambudvipa]], where trees have been mentioned in shlokas 39, 53 and 56. In [[Kishkindha Kanda]] Sarga 42, [[Sugreeva]] sends troops to '''west side''' to search for Sita. Describing the various provinces like Surashtra, Balhika and Chandrachitra (Mathura), Western Ocean, River Sindhu and magnificent mountains that are situated at the northwest of India, cities like Murachi, Jatapura, Avanti and Angalepa and also the ocean down south to it, namely the present Arabian Sea and almost up to Persian provinces, he orders vanara troops to return within one month's time. Here shlokas 7, 8, 11, 12, 13,46 mention forest trees. In [[Kishkindha Kanda]] Sarga 43, [[Sugreeva]] sends troops '''to north''' in search of Sita. He gives an account of the snowy regions and provinces of northern side and asks them to search in the places of [[Yavana]], [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]], and [[Darada]]s etc., civilisations. Sugreeva specially informs them about a divine province called [[Uttara Kuru Kingdom|Uttara Kuru]] and a heavenly mountain called Mt. Soma on which Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva make sojourn for its sacredness. Here shlokas 13, 17 and 37 describe the forest trees.

The identification of these species may prove to be great tool in identifying those places and writing of history. We produce here the names of plants and trees in [[Sanskrit language]], their botanical names, local Hindi or English names and Sargas (Chapters) in which forests and tree species have been mentioned.

===Legend of the Shami Tree===
[[File:Khejri.jpg|thumb|The Shami Tree (''[[Prosopis cineraria]]'') was used to hide [[Arjuna]]'s [[Gandiva]]]]
There is a little-known legend associated with [[Vijayadashami]] festival, one associated with the [[Mahabharata]]. For reasons impossible to delineate here, the [[Pandava]]s underwent a period of exile, being 12 years of dwelling in the forest followed by a year of exile incognito. Disguise being indispensable during the latter period, the Pandavas found it necessary to lay aside, for the length of that year, the many divine and distinctive weapons that they possessed such as [[Arjuna]]'s [[Gandiva]]. These they secreted in a '[[Prosopis cineraria|Shami]]' tree (''[[Prosopis cineraria]]'') in the vicinity of their chosen place of incognito residence. It is said that the Shami tree chosen by the Pandavas stood inside a cremation ground. It was chosen to render detection that much less likely. The Pandavas wrapped their weapons in a white cloth and concealed this on that shami tree, making the weapons look like a dead body. Mahabharata Book IV [[Virata Parva]] Chapter 5 mentions that on the southerns bank of River Yamuna in Viratanagara hides his bow Gandiva in Shami tree.&lt;ref&gt;iyaṃ kūṭe manuṣyendra gahahā mahatī śamī, bhīma śākhā durārohā śmaśānasya samīpataḥ ([[Mahabharata]]:IV.5.12)&lt;/ref&gt; That Shami tree was in the midst of an out-of-the way forest abounding in beasts and snakes, and was in the vicinity of a dreary cemetery. At the end of a year, they returned to the spot, found their weaponry intact, and worshipped in thanksgiving both the Shami tree and the Goddess Durga, presiding deity of strength and victory. Meanwhile, the [[Kaurava]]s had invaded that area, suspecting the residence of the Pandavas there. Upon finishing their devotions, the Pandavas made straight to battle, and won the contest comprehensively. The day that all these events occurred on has since been known as "Vijayadashami", where "Vijaya" is the Sanskrit word for "Victory".
The fact of the comprehensive success of the Pandavas in their endeavour has been extrapolated to the everyday ventures of the common man today. Even to this day, people exchange Shami leaves and wish each other victory in their own ventures and efforts.

=== Kuru- Jangla region ===
The historian K R Qanungo&lt;ref&gt;History of the Jats, Ed [[Vir Singh (author)|Dr Vir Singh]], 2003, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; mentions incidence from [[Mahabharata]] that there is a town named [[Sagala|Sakala]] and river named [[Apaga (river)|Apaga]] where section of the [[Bahika]]s, known as the [[Jartika]]s, dwell. He mentions about a [[Bahika]] who had to sojourn for a time in [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]]-[[Jangladesh|jungal country]] sang the following song about the women of his country. He also mentions here three important tree species also:

:"Though a [[Bahika]], I am at present an exile in [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]]-[[Jangladesh|jangal country]]; that tall and fair-complexioned wife of mine, dressed in her fine blanket certainly remembers me when she retires to rest. Oh! when shall I go back to my country crossing again the Satadru (the Sutlej) and Iravati and see beautiful females of fair complexion, wearing stout bangles, dressed in blanket and skins, eye-sides coloured with dye of ''Manshila'', forehead, cheek and chin painted wit collyrium (tattooing ?). When shall we eat under the pleasant shade of ''[[Prosopis cineraria|Shami]]'' ([[Prosopis cineraria]]), ''[[Peelu]]'' (''[[Salvadora oleoides]]'') and ''[[Karir]]'' (''[[Capparis decidua]]''), loaves and balls of fried barley powder with waterless churned curd (''kunjik''), and gathering strength, take away the clothes of the wayfarers and beat them?"

[[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] '''George Anson, 1st Baron Anson''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|PC|FRS}} (23 April 1697&amp;nbsp;– 6 June 1762) was a [[Royal Navy]] officer. Anson served as a junior officer during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and then saw active service against Spain at the [[Battle of Cape Passaro]] during the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]]. He then undertook a [[circumnavigation]] of the globe during the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]]. Anson commanded the fleet that defeated the French [[Jacques-Pierre de Taffanel de la Jonquière, Marquis de la Jonquière|Admiral de la Jonquière]] at the [[First Battle of Cape Finisterre (1747)|First Battle of Cape Finisterre]] during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].

Anson went on to be [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] during the [[Seven Years' War]]. Among his reforms were the removal of corrupt defence contractors, improved medical care, submitting a revision of the [[Articles of War (Royal Navy)|Articles of War]] to Parliament to tighten discipline throughout the Navy, [[Military uniform|uniforms]] for commissioned [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]], the transfer of the [[Royal Marines|Marines]] from Army to Navy authority, and a system for rating ships according to their number of guns.

==Family and early career==
Anson was the son of William Anson of [[Shugborough]] in [[Staffordshire]] and Isabella Carrier,&lt;ref name=cokayne&gt;Cokayne, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; whose brother-in-law was the [[Thomas Parker, 1st Earl of Macclesfield|Earl of Macclesfield]] and [[Lord Chancellor]], a relationship that proved very useful to the future admiral.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} He was born on 23 April 1697,{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}{{refn|The 9th edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' gives the 22nd.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}}} at [[Shugborough Hall|Shugborough Manor]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} In February 1712, amid the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], Anson entered the [[British Navy|navy]] at the age of 15.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} He served as a volunteer aboard the [[fourth-rate]] {{HMS|Ruby|1708|6}}, before transferring to the [[third-rate]] {{HMS|Monmouth|1667|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;Anson 1912, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; 

Promoted to [[lieutenant]] on 17 March 1716, he was assigned to the fourth-rate {{HMS|Hampshire|1698|6}} in service as part of a [[Baltic Sea]] fleet commanded by Admiral [[John Norris (Royal Navy officer)|John Norris]].&lt;ref name=heath11&gt;Heathcote, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Anson transferred to the aging fourth-rate {{HMS|Montagu|1654|6}} in March 1718, and saw active service against Spain at the [[Battle of Cape Passaro]] in August 1718 during the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]].&lt;ref name="Anson2"&gt;Anson 1912, pp. 2-3&lt;/ref&gt; He then transferred to the [[second-rate]] {{HMS|Barfleur|1697|6}}, flagship of Admiral [[George Byng, 1st Viscount Torrington|George Byng]], in October 1719.&lt;ref name=heath11/&gt;

Anson was promoted to [[commander]] in June 1722 and given command of the small 8-gun HMS ''Weazel''. Anson's orders were to suppress [[smuggling]] between Britain and Holland, a task he swiftly and effectively performed.&lt;ref name="Anson2"/&gt; In recognition of his efforts he was promoted to the rank of [[post-captain]] in February 1723 and given command of the 32-gun [[sixth-rate]] HMS ''Scarborough'' with orders to escort British merchant convoys from the Carolinas.&lt;ref name="Anson2"/&gt; (The [[Ansonborough]] district of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]], still commemorates his time there.){{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} 

He transferred to the command of the sixth-rate HMS ''Garland'', still on the Carolinas station, in July 1728, then to the command of the fifth-rate HMS ''Diamond'' in the [[Channel Fleet]] in 1730, and to the command of the sixth-rate HMS ''Squirrel'' back on the Carolinas station in 1731.&lt;ref name=heath11/&gt; He was given command of the 60-gun [[third-rate]] {{HMS|Centurion|1732|6}} in the [[West Africa Squadron]] in 1737 and, having been promoted to [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|commodore]] with his [[broad pennant]] in HMS ''Centurion'', he took command of a squadron sent to attack [[Spain|Spanish]] possessions in [[South America]] at the outset of the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]].&lt;ref name=heath12&gt;Heathcote, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voyage around the world==
{{Main article|George Anson's voyage around the world}}
[[File:Samuel_Scott_1.jpg|thumb|left|George Anson's capture of the [[Manila galleon]] by [[Samuel Scott (painter)|Samuel Scott]].]]
After setting off later than planned, Anson's squadron encountered successive disasters.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} Two of his vessels, the fifth-rate {{HMS|Pearl|1726|6}} and the fourth-rate {{HMS|Severn|1695|6}}, failed to round [[Cape Horn]] and returned home. Meanwhile, the sixth-rate {{HMS|Wager|1739|6}} was wrecked off the coast of [[Chile]],{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} where the crew subsequently [[Wager Mutiny|mutinied]]. The lateness of the season forced him to round the Horn in very stormy weather, and the navigating instruments of the time did not allow for exact observations.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} 

By the time Anson reached the [[Juan Fernández Islands]] in June 1741, only three of his six ships remained (HMS ''Centurion'', the fourth-rate {{HMS|Gloucester|1711|6}} and the sloop HMS ''Tryal''), while the strength of his crews had fallen from 961 to 335.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} In the absence of any effective Spanish force on the coast, he was able to harass the enemy and to sack the small port city of [[Paita]] in [[Peru]] in November 1741.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} The steady decrease of his crews by [[scurvy]] and the worn-out state of his remaining consorts compelled him to collect all the remaining survivors in ''Centurion''.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=   Price |first1=Catherine  |title=The Age of Scurvy |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=2 |pages=12-23 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/the-age-of-scurvy|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} He rested at the island of [[Tinian]], and then made his way to [[Macao]] in November 1742.&lt;ref name=heath12/&gt;

After considerable difficulties with the [[Qing Empire|Chinese]], he sailed again with his one remaining vessel to cruise in search of one of the [[Manila galleon]]s that conducted the trade between [[Mexico]] and the Chinese merchants in the [[Philippines]],{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} where he captured the ''Nuestra Señora de Covadonga''{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} with 1,313,843 [[Spanish dollar|pieces of eight]]&lt;ref name=heath12/&gt;on board, which he had encountered off [[Cape Espiritu Santo]] on 20 June 1743. The charts captured with the ship added many islands (and [[phantom island]]s) to the British knowledge of the Pacific, including the [[Anson Archipelago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stommel | first = Henry | title = Lost Islands: The Story of Islands That Have Vanished from Nautical Charts | publisher = University of British Columbia Press | location = Vancouver | year = 1984 | isbn = 0-7748-0210-3 | pages = xvii, 105ff }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FzhjAAAAMAAJ James Hingston Tuckey: Maritime Geography and Statistics.

Anson took his prize back to Macao, sold her cargo to the Chinese, kept the [[Coin|specie]], and sailed for England. Passing a French fleet then patrolling the Channel by means of a thick fog,{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} he reached via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on 15 June 1744.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} The [[prize money]] earned from the capture of the galleon made Anson a rich man for life{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} and bought him considerable political influence.&lt;ref name=heath12/&gt; He initially refused promotion to [[rear-admiral of the blue]],{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} however, out of anger that the admiralty refused to sanction a captain's commission he had given one of his officers.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}

Anson became [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] in the [[Broad Bottom Ministry]] in June 1751 and continued to serve during the [[first Newcastle ministry]].&lt;ref name=sainty/&gt; Among his reforms were the removal of corrupt defence contractors, improved medical care, submitting a revision of the [[Articles of War (Royal Navy)|Articles of War]] to Parliament so tightening discipline throughout the Navy, [[Military uniform|uniforms]] for commissioned [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]], the transfer of the [[Royal Marines|Marines]] from Army to Navy authority and a system for rating ships according to their number of guns.&lt;ref name=heath13/&gt;

Anson oversaw the Navy for much of the [[Seven Years' War]], and established a permanent [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] which could patrol the western approaches to both Britain and France. He was particularly concerned at the prospect of a French invasion of the [[British Isles]]&lt;ref&gt;Lambert p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; which led him to keep a large force in the [[English Channel]]. In 1756 he was criticised for not sending enough ships with [[John Byng|Admiral Byng]] to [[Siege of Fort St Philip (1756)|relieve Minorca]] because he wanted to protect Britain from a threatened invasion, only to see [[Battle of Minorca (1756)|Byng fail to save Minorca]] while no invasion attempt materialised. He left the Admiralty when the Newcastle ministry fell in November 1756 and then served again as First Lord when the [[Pitt–Newcastle ministry]] was created in June 1757.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert pp. 143-45&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1758, after [[Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke|Edward Hawke]] had decided to strike his flag and return to port over a misunderstanding at which he took offence, Anson hoisted his own flag in the [[first-rate]] {{HMS|Royal George|1756|6}} and took over command of the Western Squadron again.&lt;ref name=heath13/&gt; Anson oversaw Britain's naval response to a more serious [[Planned French invasion of Britain (1759)|French invasion attempt]] in 1759. He instituted a close [[blockade]] of the French coast, which proved crippling to the French economy and ensured no invasion fleet could slip out undetected. The British victories at the [[Battle of Lagos]] in August 1759 and the [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]] in November 1759 destroyed any realistic hope of a major invasion of the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson pp. 381-83&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as securing home defense, Anson co-ordinated with [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] a series of British attacks on French colonies around the globe. By 1760 the British had captured [[Canada]], [[Senegal]] and [[Guadeloupe]] from the French, and followed it up by [[Capture of Belle Île|capturing Belle Île]] and Dominica in 1761. In 1762 the entry of Spain into the war offered further chances for British expeditions. Anson was the architect of a plan to [[Battle of Havana (1762)|capture Havana]] and [[Battle of Manila (1762)|seize Manila]] in the Philippines. Anson had been concerned that the combined strength of the French and Spanish navies would overpower Britain, but he still threw himself into the task of directing these expeditions. The British also [[Invasion of Martinique (1762)|captured Martinique]] and Grenada in the [[French West Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;Corbett p. 209-27&lt;/ref&gt; Anson was promoted to [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] on 30 July 1761.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=10126|date=28 July 1761|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last service was to convey [[Queen Charlotte]] to England.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}

He died at [[Moor Park (house)|Moor Park]] in [[Hertfordshire]] on 6 June 1762 and was buried at St Michael and All Angels Church in [[Colwich, Staffordshire]].&lt;ref name=heath13/&gt; Places named after him include [[Anson County, North Carolina]]&lt;ref&gt;Anson 1912, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anson, Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skowheganchamber.com/index.php/our-area/town-information/anson|title=Anson|publisher=Skowhegan Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eight warships of the Royal Navy have also been named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/our-organisation/the-fighting-arms/submarine-service/fleet-submarines/astute-class/hms-anson|title=HMS ''Anson''|publisher=Royal Navy|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1748, Anson married Lady Elizabeth Yorke, daughter of [[Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke]]; they had no children.&lt;ref name=heath13/&gt;

'''Glaciovolcanism''' is [[volcanism]] and related phenomena associated with glacial ice. The ice commonly constrains the erupted material and melts to create [[meltwater]]. Considerable melting of glacial ice can create massive [[lahar]]s and glacial outburst [[flood]]s known as [[jökulhlaup]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evropusamvinna.is/page/I08-SYM3#3-b Volcano-ice-water interaction]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==General==
Three forms of glaciovolcanism are known. [[Subglacial eruption]]s occur when a volcano erupts under ice. Such activity can produce landforms such as [[tuya]]s and [[subglacial mound]]s. Ice-marginal volcanism takes place when material from a [[subaerial eruption]] makes lateral contact with ice. [[Ice-marginal lava flow]]s are a product of this phenomenon. Supraglacial eruptions deposit [[ejecta]] onto the surface of an [[ice sheet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eos.ubc.ca/~krussell/subglacial/pages/terminology.html Terminology commonly used to describe glaciovolcanic deposits]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[Isostatic rebound]] in response to glacier retreat (unloading), increase in local salinity (i.e., δ18Osw), have been attributed to increased volcanic activity at the onset of [[Bølling-Allerød warming|Bølling–Allerød]], are associated with the interval of intense volcanic activity, hinting at a interaction between climate and volcanism - enhanced short-term melting of glaciers, possibly via albedo changes from particle fallout on glacier surfaces.&lt;ref name=Praetorius2016&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306418361_Interaction_between_climate_volcanism_and_isostatic_rebound_in_Southeast_Alaska_during_the_last_deglaciation|title=Interaction between climate, volcanism, and isostatic rebound in Southeast Alaska during the last deglaciation|author=Praetorius et al|year=2016|publisher=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2016.07.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4805">[[Fins]] are extensions on exterior surfaces of objects that increase the rate of [[heat transfer]] to or from the object by increasing [[convection]]. This is achieved by increasing the [[surface area]] of the body, which in turn increases the heat transfer rate by a sufficient degree. This is an efficient way of increasing the rate, since the alternative way of doing so is by increasing either the [[heat transfer coefficient]] (which depends on the nature of materials being used and the conditions of use) or the [[temperature gradient]] (which depends on the conditions of use). Clearly, changing the shape of the bodies is more convenient. Fins are therefore a very popular solution to increase the heat transfer from surfaces and are widely used in a number of objects. The fin material should preferably have high [[thermal conductivity]]. 
In most applications the fin is surrounded by a fluid in motion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node128.html "MIT Thermodynamics"]&lt;/ref&gt; which heats or cools it quickly due to the large surface area, and subsequently the heat gets transferred to or from the body quickly due to the high thermal conductivity of the fin. 
For optimal Heat transfer performance with minimal cost, the dimensions and shape of the fin have to be calculated for specific applications, and this is called [[design]] of a fin. A common way of doing so is by creating a [[Conceptual model|model]] of the fin and then [[simulating]] it under required service conditions.

== Modeling ==
 
Consider a body with fins on its outer surface, with air flowing around it. 
 
The heat transfer rate depends on 
	
* Shape and geometry of the external surface
* Surface area of the body
* [[Velocity]] of the wind (or any fluid in other cases)
* [[Temperature]] of surroundings

Modelling of the fins in this case involves, [[experimenting]] on this physical model and optimizing the number of fins and fin pitch for maximum [[performance]].&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, Shrikhande, and Srinivasan [http://www.iaeng.org/publication/WCE2011/WCE2011_pp2385-2389.pdf "Heat Transfer Simulation by CFD from Fins of an Air Cooled Motorcycle Engine under Varying Climatic Conditions"] WCE 2011, July 6–8, 2011, London, U.K.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the experimentally obtained equations for heat transfer coefficient for the fin surface for low wind velocities is:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;k=2.11  v^{0.71}  \theta^{0.44}   a^{-0.14}&lt;/math&gt;

where

k= Fin surface heat transfer coefficient [W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;K ]

a=fin length [mm]

v=wind velocity [km/hr]

θ=fin pitch [mm]

Another equation for high fluid velocities, obtained from experiments conducted by Gibson, is

&lt;math display="block"&gt;k= 241.7[0.0247-0.00148(a^{0.8}/\theta^{0.4})] v^{0.73}&lt;/math&gt;

where

k=Fin surface heat transfer coefficient[W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;K ]

a=Fin length[mm]

θ=Fin pitch[mm]

v=Wind velocity[km/hr]

A more accurate equation for fin surface heat transfer coefficient is:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;k_{avg} = (2.47-2.55/\theta^{0.4}) v^{0.9} 0.0872 \theta + 4.31&lt;/math&gt;

where

k (avg)= Fin surface heat transfer coefficient[W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;K ]

θ=Fin pitch[mm]

v=Wind velocity[km/hr]

All these equations can be used to evaluate [[average]] heat transfer coefficient for various fin designs.

== Design ==

The momentum conservation equation for this case is given as follows:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;{\partial(\rho v)\over\partial t} + v \nabla . (\rho v) = -\nabla P + \nabla . \tau + F + \rho g&lt;/math&gt;

This is used in combination with the continuity equation.

The energy equation is also needed, which is:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;{\partial (\rho E)\over\partial t} + \nabla.[v(\rho E + p)] =\nabla.[k_{eff}\nabla T- \Sigma_j h_j J_j +(\tau.v)]&lt;/math&gt;.

The above equation, on solving, gives the temperature profile for the fluid region.

When solved as a scalar equation, it can be used to calculate the temperatures at the fin and cylinder surfaces, by reducing to:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;\nabla^2 T + {\overset{.}{q}\over k} = {1 \over \alpha} {\partial T\over\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

q = internal heat generation = 0 (in this case).

Also dT/dt  = 0 due to steady state assumption.

These flow and energy equations can be set up and solved in any [[simulation software]], e.g. [[Ansys|Fluent]]. In order to do so, all parameters of flow and thermal conditions like fluid velocity and temperature of body have to be specified according to the requirement. Also, the [[boundary conditions]] and [[wikt:assumption|assumption]]s if any must be specified.

This results in velocity profiles and temperature profiles for various surfaces and this knowledge can be used to design the fin.

The idea of human artifacts being given life has fascinated humankind for as long as people have been recording their myths and stories.  Whether [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]] or [[Frankenstein]], humanity has been fascinated with the idea of [[artificial life]].

== Pre-computer ==

[[Automaton]]s were quite a novelty.  In the days before computers and electronics, some were very sophisticated, using [[pneumatics]], [[mechanics]], and [[hydraulics]]. The first automata were conceived during the third and second centuries BC and these were demonstrated by the theorems of [[Hero of Alexandria]], which included sophisticated mechanical and hydraulic solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Droz, Edmond. (April 1962), From joined doll to talking robot, New Scientist, vol. 14, no. 282. pp. 37-40.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his notable works were included in the book ''Pneumatics'', which was also used for constructing machines until early modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Synthetic Biology Analysed: Tools for Discussion and Evaluation|last=Engelhard|first=Margret|publisher=Springer|year=2016|isbn=9783319251431|location=Cham|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1490, Leonardo Da Vinci also constructed an armored knight, which is considered the first humanoid robot in Western civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Mobile Robot Control|last=Tzafestas|first=Spyros|publisher=Elsevier|year=2014|isbn=9780124170490|location=Waltham, MA|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early famous examples include [[al-Jazari]]'s [[humanoid robot]]s. This Arabic inventor once constructed a band of automata, which can be commanded to play different pieces of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science Year by Year , Dorling Kindersley, 2013: Science Year by Year|last=Winston|first=Robert|publisher=DK|year=2013|isbn=9781409316138|location=London|pages=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the case of [[Jacques de Vaucanson]]'s [[digesting Duck|artificial duck]] exhibited in 1735, which had thousands of moving parts and one of the first to mimic a biological system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cellular Automaton Modeling of Biological Pattern Formation: Characterization, Examples, and Analysis, 2nd edition|last=Deutsch|first=Andreas|publisher=Birkhäuser|year=2018|isbn=9781489979780|location=New York|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duck could reportedly eat and digest, drink, quack, and splash in a pool.  It was exhibited all over Europe until it fell into disrepair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nyu.edu/pages/linguistics/courses/v610051/gelmanr/ling.html| title=Gallery of Automata| accessdate=2006-03-03| first=Rony| last=Gelman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it wasn't until the invention of cheap computing power that [[artificial life]] as a legitimate science began in earnest, steeped more in the theoretical and computational than the mechanical and mythological.

==1950s&amp;ndash;1970s==
One of the earliest thinkers of the modern age to postulate the potentials of artificial life, separate from [[artificial intelligence]], was math and computer prodigy [[John von Neumann]].  At the [[Hixon Symposium]], hosted by [[Linus Pauling]] in [[Pasadena, California]] in the late 1940s, von Neumann delivered a lecture titled "The General and Logical Theory of Automata."  He defined an "automaton" as any machine whose behavior proceeded logically from step to step by combining information from the environment and its own programming, and said that natural organisms would in the end be found to follow similar simple rules.  He also spoke about the idea of [[self-replicating machine]]s.  He postulated a machine &amp;ndash; a [[kinematic automaton]] &amp;ndash; made up of a control computer, a construction arm, and a long series of instructions, floating in a lake of parts.  By following the instructions that were part of its own body, it could create an identical machine.  He followed this idea by creating (with [[Stanislaw Ulam]]) a purely logic-based automaton, not requiring a physical body but based on the changing states of the cells in an infinite grid &amp;ndash; the first [[cellular automaton]].  It was extraordinarily complicated compared to later CAs, having hundreds of thousands of cells which could each exist in one of twenty-nine states, but von Neumann felt he needed the complexity in order for it to function not just as a self-replicating "machine", but also as a [[universal computer]] as defined by [[Alan Turing]].  This "[[Von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]]" read from a tape of instructions and wrote out a series of cells that could then be made active to leave a fully functional copy of the original machine and its tape. Von Neumann worked on his [[automata theory]] intensively right up to his death, and considered it his most important work.

[[Homer Jacobson]] illustrated basic self-replication in the 1950s with a model train set &amp;ndash; a seed "organism" consisting of a "head" and "tail" boxcar could use the simple rules of the system to consistently create new "organisms" identical to itself, so long as there was a random pool of new boxcars to draw from.
[[Edward F. Moore]] proposed "Artificial Living Plants", which would be floating factories which could create copies of themselves.  They could be programmed to perform some function (extracting fresh water, harvesting minerals from seawater) for an investment that would be relatively small compared to the huge returns from the exponentially growing numbers of factories.  [[Freeman Dyson]] also studied the idea, envisioning self-replicating machines sent to explore and exploit other planets and moons, and a NASA group called the Self-Replicating Systems Concept Team performed a 1980 study on the feasibility of a self-building lunar factory.

University of Cambridge professor [[John Horton Conway]] invented the most famous cellular automaton in the 1960s.  He called it the [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]], and publicized it through [[Martin Gardner]]'s column in ''[[Scientific American]]'' magazine.

==1970s&amp;ndash;1980s==
Philosophy scholar [[Arthur Burks]], who had worked with von Neumann (and indeed, organized his papers after Neumann's death), headed the Logic of Computers Group at the [[University of Michigan]].  He brought the overlooked views of 19th century American thinker [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] into the modern age.  Peirce was a strong believer that all of nature's workings were based on logic (though not always deductive logic).  The Michigan group was one of the few groups still interested in alife and CAs in the early 1970s; one of its students, [[Tommaso Toffoli]] argued in his PhD thesis that the field was important because its results explain the simple rules that underlay complex effects in nature.  Toffoli later provided a key proof that CAs were [[Reversible computing|reversible]], just as the true universe is considered to be.

[[Christopher Langton]] was an unconventional researcher, with an undistinguished academic career that led him to a job programming [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] mainframes for a hospital.  He became enthralled by Conway's Game of Life, and began pursuing the idea that the computer could emulate living creatures.  After years of study (and a near-fatal hang-gliding accident), he began attempting to actualize Von Neumann's CA and the work of [[Edgar F. Codd]], who had simplified Von Neumann's original twenty-nine state monster to one with only eight states.  He succeeded in creating the first self-replicating computer organism in October 1979, using only an [[Apple II]] desktop computer.  He entered Burks' graduate program at the Logic of Computers Group in 1982, at the age of 33, and helped to found a new discipline.

Langton's official conference announcement of Artificial Life I was the earliest description of a field which had previously barely existed:&lt;ref&gt;Langton, C.G. (1989) "Artificial Life", in ''Artificial Life'', Langton (ed), (Addison-Wesley:Reading, MA) page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Artificial life is the study of artificial systems that exhibit behavior characteristic of natural living systems.  It is the quest to explain life in any of its possible manifestations, without restriction to the particular examples that have evolved on earth.  This includes biological and chemical experiments, computer simulations, and purely theoretical endeavors.  Processes occurring on molecular, social, and evolutionary scales are subject to investigation.  The ultimate goal is to extract the logical form of living systems.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Microelectronic technology and genetic engineering will soon give us the capability to create new life forms ''in silico'' as well as ''in vitro''.  This capacity will present humanity with the most far-reaching technical, theoretical and ethical challenges it has ever confronted.  The time seems appropriate for a gathering of those involved in attempts to simulate or synthesize aspects of living systems.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ed Fredkin]] founded the Information Mechanics Group at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], which united Toffoli, [[Norman Margolus]], [[Gerard Vichniac]], and [[Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist)|Charles Bennett]].  This group created a computer especially designed to execute cellular automata, eventually reducing it to the size of a single circuit board.  This "cellular automata machine" allowed an explosion of alife research among scientists who could not otherwise afford sophisticated computers.

In 1982, computer scientist named [[Stephen Wolfram]] turned his attention to cellular automata.  He explored and categorized the types of [[complexity]] displayed by one-dimensional CAs, and showed how they applied to natural phenomena such as the patterns of seashells and the nature of plant growth.
[[Norman Packard]], who worked with Wolfram at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], used CAs to simulate the growth of snowflakes, following very basic rules.

Computer animator [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]] similarly used three simple rules to create recognizable [[Flocking (behavior)|flocking]] behaviour in a [[Boids|computer program]] in 1987 to animate groups of boids.  With no top-down programming at all, the boids produced lifelike solutions to evading obstacles placed in their path.  [[Computer animation]] has continued to be a key commercial driver of alife research as the creators of [[Film|movie]]s attempt to find more realistic and inexpensive ways to animate natural forms such as plant life, animal movement, hair growth, and complicated organic textures.

The Unit of Theoretical Behavioural Ecology at the [[Free University of Brussels]] applied the self-organization theories of [[Ilya Prigogine]] and the work of entomologist [[E.O. Wilson]] to research the behavior of social insects, particularly [[allelomimesis]], in which an individual's actions are dictated by those of a neighbor.  They developed partial differential equations which modeled the shapes created by termites when constructing their nest.  They then compared that to the reaction of real termites to identical changes in laboratory colonies, and refined their theories about the rules which underlay the behavior.

[[J. Doyne Farmer]] was a key figure in tying artificial life research to the emerging field of [[complex adaptive system]]s, working at the [[Center for Nonlinear Studies]] (a basic research section of [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]), just as its star chaos theorist [[Mitchell Feigenbaum]] was leaving.  Farmer and Norman Packard chaired a conference in May 1985 called "Evolution, Games, and Learning", which was to presage many of the topics of later alife conferences.

==2000s==
On the ecological front, research regarding the evolution of animal cooperative behavior (started by [[W. D. Hamilton]] in the 1960s &lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, W. D. The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I and II. J. Theor.
Biol. 7, 1&amp;ndash;52 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod, R. &amp; Hamilton, W. D. The evolution of cooperation. Science 211,
1390&amp;ndash;1396 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in theories of kin selection, reciprocity, multilevel selection and cultural group selection) was re-introduced via artificial life by [[Peter Turchin]] and Mikhail Burtsev in 2006. Previously, [[game theory]] has been utilized in similar investigation, however, that approach was deemed to be rather limiting in its amount of possible strategies and debatable set of payoff rules. The alife model designed here, instead, is based upon [[Conway's Game of Life]] but with much added complexity (there are over 10&lt;sup&gt;1000&lt;/sup&gt; strategies that can potentially emerge). Most significantly, the interacting agents are characterized by external phenotype markers which allows for recognition amongst in-group members. In effect, it is shown that given the capacity to perceive these markers, agents within the system are then able to evolve new group behaviors under minimalistic assumptions. On top of the already known strategies of the bourgeois-[[hawk-dove game]], here two novel modes of cooperative attack and defense arise from the simulation.

For the setup, this two-dimensional artificial world is divided into cells, each empty or containing a resource bundle. An empty cell can acquire a resource bundle with a certain probability per unit of time and lose it when an agent consumes the resource. Each agent is plainly constructed with a set of receptors, effectors (the components that govern the agents' behavior), and neural net which connect the two. In response to the environment, an agent may rest, eat, reproduce by division, move, turn and attack. All actions{{Clarify|date=July 2010}} &lt;!--is this true? (see next comment)--&gt; expend energy taken from its internal energy storage; once that is depleted, the agent dies. Consumption of resource, as well as other agents after defeating them, yields an increase &lt;!--or should this say "a net increase"?--&gt; in the energy storage. Reproduction is modeled as being asexual while the offspring receive half the parental energy. Agents are also equipped with sensory inputs that allow them to detect resources or other members within a parameter{{Clarify|date=July 2010}} in addition to its own level of vitality. As for the phenotype markers, they do not influence behavior but solely function as indicator of 'genetic' similarity. Heredity is achieved by having the relevant information be inherited by the offspring and subjected to a set rate of mutation.

The objective of the investigation is to study how the presence of phenotype markers affects the model's range of evolving cooperative strategies. In addition, as the resource available in this 2D environment is capped, the simulation also serves to determine the effect of environmental carrying capacity on their emergence.

One previously unseen strategy is termed the "raven". These agents leave cells with in-group members, thus avoiding intra-specific competition, and attack out-group members voluntarily. Another strategy, named the 'starling', involves the agent sharing cells with in-group members. Despite individuals having smaller energy storage due to resource partitioning, this strategy permits highly effective defense against large invaders via the advantage in numbers. Ecologically speaking, this resembles the [[mobbing behavior]] that characterizes many species of small birds when they collectively defend against the predator.

In conclusion, the research claims that the simulated results have important implications for the evolution of [[territoriality (ethology)|territoriality]] by showing that within the alife framework it is possible to "model not only how one strategy displaces another, but also the very process by which new strategies emerge from a large quantity of possibilities".&lt;ref&gt;Burtsev M, Turchin P. 2006. Evolution of cooperative strategies from first principles. Nature&lt;/ref&gt;

Work is also underway to create [[computational biomodeling|cellular models of artificial life]].  Initial work on building a complete biochemical model of cellular behavior is underway as part of a number of different research projects, namely [[Blue Gene]] which seeks to understand the mechanisms behind [[protein folding]].

'''Interbol''' ({{lang-ru|Интербол}}) is an international space project under the leadership of the [[Russian Space Agency]] and the Space Research Institute of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. The list of participants includes the Institute of Atmospheric Research of the [[Czech Academy of Sciences]],  [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]],  [[European Space Agency]], [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]], and the [[Canadian Space Agency]]. The goal of the project is to study the correlations between [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] processes in the tail of the [[magnetosphere]] and in the [[Van Allen radiation belt]] ([[aurora (astronomy)|auroral]] particles acceleration region) with a high time-space resolution. Two space probes have been launched into high-altitude elliptical orbits:

*[[aurora (astronomy)|auroral]] probe was launched August 29, 1996 into orbit with  an [[apogee]] of  20 000&amp;nbsp;km. The probe was sent to space in the same month as the [[Fast Auroral Snapshot Explorer|FAST spacecraft]], which studies aurora at both poles;{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}
*tail probe was launched  August 3, 1995 into orbit with  an [[apogee]] of  200 000&amp;nbsp;km;{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Both orbits are almost parallel to the [[ecliptic]]. Each probe consists of a pair [[satellite]]-subsatellite. Subsatellites “Magion-4” ([[aurora (astronomy)|auroral]]) and “Magion-5” (tail) were procured by the Institute of atmospheric Research of the [[Czech Academy of Sciences]].  The communication with “Magion-5” was interrupted August 30, 1996 and was restored May 7, 1998. The life expectancy of space vehicles is 12 years.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2401">'''''Kick The Fossil Fuel Habit: 10 Clean Technologies to Save Our World''''' is a 2010 book by clean energy venture capitalist Tom Rand. The book is about making an [[energy transition]] from [[fossil fuel]]s to clean technologies, by changing to [[100% renewable energy]]. It includes detailed descriptions of the technologies required - [[solar energy]], [[wind power]], [[geothermal energy]] and more. Author Tom Rand says we will "need to deploy resources on a scale not seen since World War II, generate international co-operation, and develop rules to put a price on carbon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julia-moulden/how-to-kick-the-fossil-fu_b_540224.html |title=How To Kick The Fossil Fuel Habit |author=Julia Moulden |date=2010-04-17  |work=Huffington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand says that there are lots of reasons to kick the fossil fuel habit: "[[energy security]]; the moral cost of supporting undemocratic regimes that sit on the oil we use; the military cost, both in blood and cash, to keep the supply lines open; and getting a leg up on the competition in the next industrial revolution. Each of these is reason enough to kick the habit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/time-to-lead/building-innovation-in-canada/clean-technologies-that-could-save-the-world/article2249693/ |title=Book excerpt: Clean technologies that could save the world |author=Tom Rand  |date=Nov 25, 2011   |work=Globe and Mail  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand stresses that we need to act quickly and, equally important, collectively. That means "this generation of government, businesses and individuals all need act together to save the world for the next".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenlivingonline.com/article/kick-fossil-fuels |title=Kick Fossil Fuels: Venture capitalist’s book is the perfect read as gas prices soar |author=Dré Dee |year=2011 |work=Green Living }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leaf peeping''' is an informal term in the United States for the activity in which people travel to view and photograph the [[Autumn leaf color|fall foliage]] in areas where [[Autumn leaf color|leaves change colors]] in [[autumn]], particularly in northern [[New England]] and the upper [[Midwest]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vermont.com/foliage.cfm Vermont.com foliage report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitnh.gov/vacation-ideas/Foliage-Tracker/ NH state Foliage Tracker] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118013856/http://www.visitnh.gov/vacation-ideas/Foliage-Tracker/ |date=2016-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. An organised excursion for leaf peeping is called a '''foliage tour'''.

A similar custom in [[Japan]] is called '''''momijigari'''''.[[File:FallFoliageMap2.PNG|thumb|300px|Fall foliage peak times in the [[United States]]]]

==United States==
The term "leaf peeper" is used both with appreciation (for those businesses that benefit from the millions that pour into the higher elevations of the West, upper Midwest, and northern [[autumn in New England|New England each fall]]) and with disdain (from those who have to use the roads that are popular with leaf peepers).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leafpeepers.com/contents.htm Leafpeepers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Hobbyists who get together for leaf peeping commonly refer to their gatherings as ''leaf peepshows''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pittsburghparks.wordpress.com/2010/11/09/leaf-peep-show/ |title=Leaf-Peep Show |accessdate=9 July 2012}}  {From Jeff Foliage}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Leaf peeping" is considered an autumn activity throughout the United States and Canada.
{{Wide image|Loon Panorama annotated.jpg|1000px|Peaks of the [[Franconia Range]] of the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] as viewed from [[Loon Mountain]] resort after an October snowfall, looking to the north}}

===In popular culture===
The term "leaf peeping" has been used in numerous television shows, including "[[The West Wing (season 2)|And It's Surely To Their Credit]]," an episode of ''[[The West Wing]]'' which originally aired on November 1, 2000 and "[[Live Free or Die (The Sopranos)|Live Free or Die]]," an episode of "[[The Sopranos]]" which originally aired on April 16, 2006. In "[[Lethal Weapons]]", an episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'', obnoxious [[New York City|New York]] tourists visiting [[Rhode Island]] to see fall leaves are pejoratively referred to as "leafers".

==Japan==
[[File:WalkAmidMaples2.jpg|thumb|''Momiji'' at [[Ryōan-ji]] in Kyoto]]

{{nihongo|''Momijigari''|紅葉狩}}, from the Japanese {{nihongo|''momiji''|紅葉}}, "red leaves" or "[[maple]] tree" and {{nihongo|''kari''|狩り}}, "hunting", is the Japanese tradition of going to visit scenic areas where leaves have turned red in the autumn. It is also called {{nihongo|'''''kōyō'''''|紅葉}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2014.html Autumn leaves (koyo) in Japan] at japan-guide.com.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kōyō'' is another [[Kanji#Readings|pronunciation]] of the characters for "momiji" which means "fall colors" or "leaves changing colors".&lt;ref&gt;http://jisho.org/&lt;/ref&gt; It is also called {{nihongo|'''''kanpūkai'''''|観楓会}} in [[Hokkaido|Hokkaidō]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.welcome.city.sapporo.jp/english/info/season.html Sapporo Year-Round: Attractions and Events in Four Seasons] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120820011730/http://www.welcome.city.sapporo.jp/english/info/season.html |date=2012-08-20 }} at the official Sapporo Sightseeing Guide.&lt;/ref&gt; which means "getting together to view the leaves".&lt;ref&gt;http://jisho.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Japanese people take part in this, with the cities of [[Nikkō, Tochigi|Nikkō]] and [[Kyoto]] being particularly famous destinations. The tradition is said to have originated in the [[Heian period|Heian era]] as a cultured pursuit, and is the reason why many [[deciduous]] trees can be found in the Kyoto area.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

There is also a tradition of going to see areas where grasses change colour, such as on the [[Ozegahara|Oze plain]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="67437">The following is a '''list of Superfund sites in New Jersey''' designated as such under the [[Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ]]([[CERCLA]]).

==Background==
For decades it was standard practice to dump waste on the ground, in rivers or to leave it out in the open. As a result, thousands of uncontrolled or abandoned contaminated sites were created. Some common contaminated sites include abandoned warehouses, manufacturing facilities, processing plants and [[landfill]]s. In response to growing concern over health and environmental risks posed by these contaminated sites, the [[96th United States Congress|96th Congress]] established the [[Superfund]] program in 1980 to clean up these sites.

The Superfund program is administered by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) in cooperation with individual states. In [[New Jersey]], the [[New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection|Department of Environmental Protection]]'s (NJDEP) Site Remediation Program oversees the Superfund program.

{{As of|2016|3|10}}, there are 105 Superfund sites listed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL).  Thirty-six additional sites have been cleaned up and deleted from the list.

==National Priorities List==
Sites currently listed on the NPL:

'''List of [[Family (taxonomy)|family]] [[Syrphidae]] [[genus|genera]]''', the [[Hoverfly|Hoverflies]] of the order [[Diptera]].

The family consists of more than 6000 living species. The internal [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the family and the number of genera varies greatly between sources leading to considerable discrepancy across the literature.  This is currently in the process of reorganization on the basis of phylogenetic studies but knowledge is still incomplete, especially in light of recent studies of larval characters suggesting relationships which don't correspond with the phylogeny based solely on adult characters. 

The current classification is therefore still based on the morphology of adults and basically refers to the taxonomic scheme adopted by Thompson &amp; Rotheray in the Manual of Palaearctic [[Diptera]] (1998), which divides the family into three [[subfamily|subfamilies]] and fourteen [[tribe (taxonomy)|tribes]]. 

The nomenclature given here is derived partly from the BioSystematic Database of World Diptera (BDWD), and a working classification created by a group of molecular biologists which no doubt will alter greatly in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Lifedesks: Classification of Syrphidae http://syrphidae.lifedesks.org/node/1476&lt;/ref&gt; 

The distribution of genera in traditional [[ecozones]] is derived from the [[biosystematics]] BDWD.

The location of [[Hong Kong]], adjacent to the coast, is not close to the system of major [[river]]s in southern China, though the water to the west of Hong Kong is influenced by [[Pearl River, China|Pearl River]]. In 1,103 km² of land, the territory is largely hilly with over 200 islands. Because of this, the terrain can nurture relatively shorter and smaller rivers in Hong Kong than in southern China.

Historically, these rivers once sustained [[intensive farming]] for the need of population before the age of developing [[New towns of Hong Kong|new town]]s. Many rivers can be found in the [[New Territories]], especially in the areas north of [[Tai Mo Shan]], where rice growing and fish farming were once everywhere amidst several river systems.

'''Nissum Fjord''' is an [[inlet]] located in West Jutland, west of [[Vemb]] and is demarcated from the [[North Sea]] by a 13&amp;nbsp;km wide isthmus, [[Bøvling Klit]], and passes through a [[Lock (water transport)|lock]] in [[Thorsminde]]. The inlet has a water area of 70&amp;nbsp;km² or 7.000 ha. but the average water depth is only about 1 meter, and the deepest areas in Felsted Kog and the center of the inlet are between 2 and 3 meters. The northern part of the inlet, called Bøvling Fjord, is so shallow that it is sometimes completely drained by strong winds.  Nissum Fjord has several creeks which empty into it, such as Ramme Creek, Flynder Creek, Damhus Creek and the largest creek, [[Storå, Denmark|Storåen]], which has its mouth at the eastern corner of Felsted Kog in the southeastern end of the inlet. Since the 1870s, Thorsminde has regulated the inlet's water level and salinity content at the lock, which facilitates water exchange in the inlet.  The whole inlet as well as some surrounding land is designated as a wildlife sanctuary and [[List of Ramsar wetlands of international importance|Ramsar wetland]], and the inlet and its surrounding reeds and meadows have a rich variety of [[bird]] life.

==Fjandø==
In the southwest part of Nissum Fjord, off of the [[peninsula]] Nørre Fjand, lies a small uninhabited island of 40 hectares called Fjandø.  The island's [[Heath (habitat)|heath]] vegetation is kept in check by a flock of sheep during the summer, giving good conditions for bird life. From 1 April to 31 August there is a total traffic ban on the island and in a 100-meter zone around the island.

==Felsted Kog==
Felsted Kog is the result of a drainage project in the latter half of the 19th century. The "Kog" got its name during the time people attempted to drain the entire inlet; ''"kog"'' means "acquired land." The project succeeded only at Felsted where a 13&amp;nbsp;km long [[Dike (construction)|dike]] was constructed and approximately 1400 ha. were drained. But it was soon found that the soil was not suitable for agricultural usage, and the dike often breached under heavy storms; thus the project was abandoned in 1885.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6646">{{short description|The description of the motion of water in the oceans}}
'''Ocean dynamics''' define and describe the motion of water within the oceans.  Ocean temperature and motion fields can be separated into three distinct layers: mixed (surface) layer, upper ocean (above the [[thermocline]]), and deep ocean.

Ocean dynamics has traditionally been investigated by sampling from instruments in situ.&lt;ref name=NTRS&gt;{{cite web|title=Frontiers of Remote Sensing of the Oceans and Troposphere from Air and Space Platforms|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2060/19840019194|work=Remote Sensing of Oceanography: Past, Present, and Future|publisher=NASA Technical Reports Server|accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[mixed layer]] is nearest to the surface and can vary in thickness from 10 to 500 meters.  This layer has properties such as temperature, [[salinity]] and [[dissolved oxygen]] which are uniform with depth reflecting a history of active turbulence (the atmosphere has an analogous [[planetary boundary layer]]). Turbulence is high in the mixed layer.  However, it becomes zero at the base of the mixed layer. Turbulence again increases below the base of the mixed layer due to shear instabilities. At extratropical latitudes this layer is deepest in late winter as a result of surface cooling and winter storms and quite shallow in summer. Its dynamics is governed by turbulent mixing as well as [[Ekman pumping]], exchanges with the overlying atmosphere, and horizontal [[advection]].&lt;ref name="decaria1"&gt;DeCaria, Alex J., 2007: "Lesson 5 - Oceanic Boundary Layer."  Personal Communication, Millersville University of Pennsylvania, Millersville, Pa. (Not a [[WP:RS]]){{Verify credibility|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The upper ocean, characterized by warm temperatures and active motion, varies in depth from 100&amp;nbsp;m or less in the tropics and eastern oceans to in excess of 800&amp;nbsp;meters in the western subtropical oceans.  This layer exchanges properties such as heat and freshwater with the atmosphere on timescales of a few years.  Below the mixed layer the upper ocean is generally governed by the hydrostatic and [[geostrophic]] relationships.&lt;ref name="decaria1" /&gt;  Exceptions include the deep tropics and coastal regions.

The deep ocean is both cold and dark with generally weak velocities (although limited areas of the deep ocean are known to have significant recirculations).  The deep ocean is supplied with water from the upper ocean in only a few limited geographical regions: the subpolar [[North Atlantic]] and several sinking regions around the [[Antarctic]]. Because of the weak supply of water to the deep ocean the average residence time of water in the deep ocean is measured in hundreds of years.  In this layer as well the hydrostatic and geostrophic relationships are generally valid and mixing is generally quite weak.

==Primitive equations==
Ocean dynamics are governed by [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's equations of motion]] expressed as the [[Navier-Stokes equations]] for a fluid element located at (x,y,z) on the surface of our rotating planet and moving at velocity (u,v,w) relative to that surface:

* the zonal momentum equation:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{Du}{Dt} = -\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + f v + \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \tau_x}{\partial z}&lt;/math&gt;

* the meridional momentum equation:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{Dv}{Dt} = -\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p}{\partial y} - f u + \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \tau_y}{\partial z}&lt;/math&gt;

* the  vertical momentum equation (assumes the ocean is in [[hydrostatic balance]]):
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial p}{\partial z} = -\rho g&lt;/math&gt;

* the [[Continuity equation|continuity]] equation (assumes the ocean is [[incompressible]]):
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

* the [[temperature]] equation:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} + w \frac{\partial T}{\partial z} = Q&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="decaria1" /&gt;

* the [[salinity]] equation:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial S}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial S}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial S}{\partial y} + w \frac{\partial S}{\partial z} = (E-P)S(z=0)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="decaria1" /&gt;

Here "u" is zonal velocity, "v" is meridional velocity, "w" is vertical velocity, "p" is pressure, "ρ" is density, "T" is temperature, "S" is salinity, "g" is acceleration due to gravity, "τ" is wind stress, and "f" is the Coriolis parameter. "Q" is the heat input to the ocean, while "P-E" is the freshwater input to the ocean.

==Mixed layer dynamics==

Mixed layer dynamics are quite complicated; however, in some regions some simplifications are possible.  The wind-driven horizontal transport in the mixed layer is approximately described by [[Ekman Layer]] dynamics in which vertical diffusion of momentum balances the Coriolis effect and wind stress.&lt;ref name="Pickard"&gt;Pickard, G.L. and W.J. Emery, 1990: ''Descriptive Physical Oceanography'', Fifth Edition.  Butterworth-Heinemann, 320 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[Ekman transport]] is superimposed on geostrophic flow associated with horizontal gradients of density.

==Upper ocean dynamics==

Horizontal convergences and divergences within the mixed layer due, for example, to Ekman transport convergence imposes a requirement that ocean below the mixed layer must move fluid particles vertically.  But one of the implications of the geostrophic relationship is that the magnitude of horizontal motion must greatly exceed the magnitude of vertical motion.  Thus the weak vertical velocities associated with Ekman transport convergence (measured in meters per day) cause horizontal motion with speeds of 10 centimeters per second or more.  The mathematical relationship between vertical and horizontal velocities can be derived by expressing the idea of conservation of angular momentum for a fluid on a rotating sphere.  This relationship (with a couple of additional approximations) is known to oceanographers as the [[Sverdrup relation]].&lt;ref name="Pickard" /&gt; Among its implications is the result that the horizontal convergence of Ekman transport observed to occur in the subtropical North Atlantic and Pacific forces southward flow throughout the interior of these two oceans.  Western boundary currents (the [[Gulf Stream]] and [[Kuroshio Current|Kuroshio]]) exist in order to return water to higher latitude.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32477">This is '''a list of fictional races and creatures in the ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' series''' by [[Philip Pullman]].

==Armoured bears (''panserbjørne'')==
The ''panserbjørne'' are [[Sentience|sentient]] [[polar bear]]-like creatures that have [[thumb#Opposition and apposition|opposable thumbs]] on their front paws. Despite their large digits and immense strength they have remarkable [[dexterity]]. This, together with an innate gift for [[metallurgy]], makes them exceptional [[metalsmith]]s, and they are capable of creating and repairing metal items far beyond the capabilities of human smiths.

While they mainly speak English, they are shown to be able to speak other languages.

Bears are very difficult to deceive. One exception is [[List of His Dark Materials characters#Iofur Raknison|Iofur Raknison]], the bear-king emulates humans by drinking spirits, wearing opulent clothes, and wanting a dæmon. His gullibility is attributed to his failing to act like a bear.

Bears' [[livers]] are poisonous &amp;ndash; as in real life &amp;ndash; due to a high concentration of [[retinol]] (Vitamin&amp;nbsp;A).

The word "''panserbjørne''" means "armour-bears" in [[Danish language|Danish]]. The Danish pronunciation of the word "panserbjørn" ''(singular)'' is {{IPA-da|panˀsɐˈbjɶɐ̯n|}}, but the pronunciation used in the radio plays and the audio book readings of the trilogy (by Pullman himself) is {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|n|s|ə|ˌ|b|j|ɜr|n|ə}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bridgetothestars.net/index.php?p=pronunciations|title=Bridge to the Stars - Pronunciation|accessdate=2 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2007 film, ''[[The Golden Compass]]'', they are also known as "ice bears."

===Society===
''Panserbjørne'' are generally solitary creatures, but have a loose society centered on [[Svalbard]]. They are governed by a [[king]]; Iofur Raknison and [[Iorek Byrnison]] are the two kings who appear in the books.

Some bears occasionally hire themselves out to humans as [[mercenaries]] or [[laborers]], but only in the [[Arctic]] regions, and it is implied that bears who do this may be shamed in some way. Lands further to the south have little contact with the bears, though their existence is widely known.

Becoming an outcast is the worst shame to a bear. The outcast is forced to leave his home and if he approaches Svalbard again, he will be shot down from afar with fire hurlers. Bears consider death by fire hurler to be dishonourable. The outcast may not participate in a legal duel, and any other bear may kill him without punishment or censure.

[[Duels]] are ceremonial occasions to bears, and they do not usually end in death. When a bear knows he will be defeated, he is obliged to signal his submission to the victor. On rare occasions however, an issue may be so important that there is no other option than to kill one's rival. One such case is the duel between Iorek Byrnison and Iofur Raknison, which ends with Iofur's death and Iorek reclaiming the throne. Normally, an outcast like Iorek would not have been allowed to participate in a duel, but the then-king Iofur is tricked into making an exception. Ordinarily, a bear who kills another in a duel is made an outcast.

During the books the bears struggle to maintain their own culture and traditions against the intrusive effects of human society. This is most visible during the reign of Iofur Raknison, the [[usurper]] king of Svalbard for most of ''[[Northern Lights (novel)|Northern Lights]]''. Iofur tries to force the bears to become more human-like, to build [[palaces]] and [[universities]], decorate their armour, and even acquire [[demon (His Dark Materials)|dæmons]]. Even the marble used to build the palace is offensive to the bears' way of life. Decorating armour is an even worse affront, because, they think, sky iron, ''(which seems to only be available at [[Svalbard]])'', is the only thing armour should be made of. Iorek Byrnison defeats Iofur towards the end of the first book and returns the bears to their traditions. Later in the series, however, he begins to feel human feelings such as doubt, especially in connection to the Subtle Knife.

===Armour and weapons===
Armour is extremely important to the ''panserbjørne''; they consider it the equivalent of a [[dæmon (His Dark Materials)|dæmon]] or [[soul]], albeit one that they consciously make for themselves.

A bear fashions his own armour using 'sky-iron', a rare metal collected from [[meteorite]]s which the bears discover on, or buried in, the ice. Although the magical metal described in Pullman's works is fictional, the native peoples of the Arctic do value meteorites (particularly the [[Cape York meteorite]]) as a source of iron for toolmaking.

A bear's primary weapons are his immense strength, savage jaws, and razor sharp claws. He uses these in close combat or when fighting duels with other bears. However, bears use fire hurlers, which are a combination of [[flame thrower]]s and [[catapult]]s against human enemies and outcasts.

==Witches==
In Lyra's world, [[witches]] are exclusively female and live in the far north. They worship their own gods and goddesses, who have a particular focus on nature and the earth; they also understand the [[Judeo-Christian]] concept of "[[Eve|Mother Eve]]". Every witch to appear is described as very beautiful, as they stay young for their entire lives, whilst maintaining a mature look of wisdom from their advanced years. No one knows exactly how long a witch can live, but some live to be over 1,000 years old. They dress in ragged black silk and wear no [[shoes]] or warm clothing. Witch [[queen regnant|queens]] usually wear a crown that they have created for themselves. Serafina Pekkala wears a band of everlasting, red Arctic [[flowers]] and Ruta Skadi wears a tiara of [[Siberian tiger]] teeth. Their crowns (like their dæmons which are always birds) reflect the witch queen's personality.

Witches are renowned for their excellent marksmanship, and carry bows with them wherever they go. They lower their bows to the ground as a symbol of friendship when necessary.

Witches occasionally choose human men who are in some way exceptional to be their lovers. All of a witch's sons will be human and all of her daughters will be witches. To a witch, the lives of sons or lovers are mere instants. Although some regret losing those they love, they accept that they cannot change who they are. They are however wholly unable to forgive anyone whom they love, who does not reciprocate their feelings.

Witches have a legendary sense of direction and can remember the way to a distant place that they have been to only once before.

===Powers and abilities===
Witches can feel cold, but are not affected by it. They can endure the lowest temperatures on earth comfortably. Because they are not burdened by heavy clothing, they can feel the beams of the [[Aurora (astronomy)|Aurora]] on their bare skin.

Because there is a wasteland far north where no dæmons may go, witches can learn to stay as far from their dæmons as they wish. Because all witch dæmons are [[birds]], they can easily fly away to carry messages, spy, or do other tasks for their witches &amp;ndash; often to the alarm of anyone who has never seen a person or dæmon separated from one another. When Lyra and Will go to the land of the dead, their dæmons learn to live separately from them in the same way.

If a witch has a branch of a special cloud-pine tree, she can use it to fly. A human cannot fly this way, although a witch can carry another person up on their cloud-pine if they need to, but they usually lift no one bigger than a child. In large numbers, witches and their cloud-pines can tow an airship with no directional engine and can have some control over the winds.

Witches, through intense concentration, have the power to be wholly ignored. In the right state of mind, a witch can make herself so unnoticeable that she is almost invisible. Although she is always completely solid, people will glance at her when they see her and move aside to let her pass, without any comment or objection, as if she were merely a part of the wall (''although Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Coulter is shown to be immune to this form of trickery''). Some witches have the power of prophecy, as they foresee the existence of, and identify Lyra as, the second Eve. They have spells and potions for healing, although seemingly only in the right environment and can also keep flowers fresh and prevent corpses from decaying until after a mourner has approached and seen the body. They are also shown to possess some limited form of [[telepathy]], as demonstrated by Serafina Pekkala's ability to know Lee Scoresby's location by giving him one of her crown's flowers with which to invoke her when he is in danger and by her effect on Mary Malone's dreams to help her wake up gradually and accept her presence. Her dæmon is also shown to have the ability to unfasten padlocks with a combination of snow and his breath.

===Clans===
On his journeys through Lyra's world, John Parry (''alias Stanislaus Grumman'') catalogued 9 witch clans.
The first and farthest north are the witches of Lake Enara, led by Serafina Pekkala.
The Slavic witches of Lake Lubana are the furthest south, and are led by Ruta Skadi, who was one of Lord Asriel's lovers.

The witch clans often warred amongst themselves. Some witches even helped the Magisterium at Bolvangar, though most switched sides when they learned the truth.

In the world Lord Asriel sets his base for war, an altogether separate race of witches is shown to exist, which have males as well as females and live only as long as most humans.

==Angels==
In the trilogy, angels were originally the result of condensing [[Dust (His Dark Materials)|Dust]], although it seems that other conscious beings can also become angels. They appear as nude winged humans with a light of no apparent source shining on them, and, like the witches, appear to be both young and old at the same time. Angels are arranged in a hierarchy, according to their level of power, which also determines how luminous they are; the low ranking angels cannot be seen by the naked eye during the day, and are seen best at half light. The only way for humans to see them clearly is when they are enveloped in smoke. Angels long for the feel of a body, which [[Mrs. Coulter|Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Coulter]] uses to her advantage in the [[Amber Spyglass]].

The first, oldest, and most powerful angel was [[characters of His Dark Materials#The Authority|the Authority]], worshipped as God. As the angel [[Balthamos]] tells [[Will Parry (His Dark Materials)|Will Parry]]:

{{Quote|text="The Authority, God, the Creator, the Lord, Jehovah, Yahweh, El, Adonai, The&amp;nbsp;King, The&amp;nbsp;Father, The&amp;nbsp;Almighty &amp;ndash; those were all names he gave himself. He was never the creator. He was an angel like ourselves &amp;ndash; the first angel, true, the most powerful, but he was formed of Dust as we are, and Dust is only a name for what happens when matter begins to understand itself. Matter loves matter. It seeks to know more about itself, and Dust is formed. The first angels condensed out of Dust, and the Authority was the first of them all. He told those who came after him that he had created them, but it was a lie."|sign=[[Philip Pullman]]|source=''[[The Amber Spyglass]]'', Chapter&amp;nbsp;Two, pages&amp;nbsp;31&amp;ndash;32}}

==Arctic foxes==
Seen in ''[[The Amber Spyglass]]'', [[Arctic foxes]] are partially [[sapience|sapient]] and mischievous creatures. They can only understand the present tense, a trait which leads to much confusion when they eavesdrop on others.

An excerpt of Arctic fox dialogue: "Bear must go south! Swear! Witch is troubled! True! Swear! Promise!" This happened when the fox in question had overheard Iorek Byrnison and Serafina Pekkala's conversation about the migration of the armoured bears because of a situation similar to global warming, and the fox was trying to trade information for its life with a [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Cliff-ghasts and night-ghasts|cliff ghast]] threatening to eat it.

==Gyptians==
'''Gyptians''' are a fictional [[ethnic group]] in the universe inhabited by [[Lyra Belacqua]]; they are roughly analogous to [[Romani people|Gypsies]]. The name 'Gyptian', like 'Gypsy', is derived from '[[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]]'.

Gyptians are water-travellers, they live mainly aboard [[boat]]s traversing the [[canal]]s and rivers of 'Brytain'. The Gyptians' primary source of income appears to be through trading goods as they travel. Lyra describes them as ''"coming and going with the spring and autumn fairs"''. Gyptians are said to pride themselves on their ability at card games. [[List of His Dark Materials characters#John Faa|John Faa's]] group of Gyptians come from &amp;ndash; and have a 'home base' in &amp;ndash; "Eastern Anglia", the counterpart in Lyra's world, of [[East Anglia]] in our world.

They are divided into large [[families]], the heads of which make up the Gyptians' Council, which is ruled by [[List of His Dark Materials characters#John Faa|John Faa]], the King of the Gyptians, the Council also includes [[Farder Coram]]. Gyptians sometimes gather in a "byanroping, a summons or muster of families". Their society, while widely dispersed geographically, is tightly knit. Gyptian children are extravagantly loved and looked after by other members if they stray. Their ethnic group is small enough for all Gyptians to know each other by name, yet large enough to gather 170&amp;nbsp;men to travel north on a rescue mission.

Gyptians have a distinctive physical appearance, which Lyra attempts to assume. They also have a distinctive accent and vocabulary containing "Fens-Dutch" words. The Gyptians' Dutch-ness also shows itself in their preference for drinking ''"jenniver"'' (Dutch [[genever]]), in their Dutch names ''(Dirk Vries, Raymond van Gerrit, Ruud Koopman)'', and their use of Dutch terms such as "landloper". Landloper is an old Dutch word meaning "land-walker", it is also a derogatory term meaning [[Vagrancy (people)|'tramp']], the Gyptians use it disparagingly to refer to someone who is not a Gyptian.

An additional source of inspiration for Pullman's creation of the Gyptians may have been the subculture of cargo [[narrowboat]] operators that grew up in the British isles in the 18th century, in the period between the development of the canals and the emergence of the railways. The families of these operators were constantly on the move and their children were seldom educated outside the home, as a result, narrowboat people tended to be regarded with suspicion by landsmen.

Gyptians are an honourable people, and appear to owe debts to [[Lord Asriel]] for defeating a proposed Watercourse Bill in Parliament, amongst other things. When they are made aware of the excesses of the Church researchers at [[Bolvangar]] they do their best to stop them. Despite their honourable nature, they are sometimes perceived negatively by mainstream society. Although they trade fairly, they are described as partaking in "incessant smuggling and occasional feuds" in which they may kill other Gyptians. Non-gyptian teenagers whom Lyra talks to, insinuate that Gyptians steal horses, and that they are unconcerned by the disappearance of a Gyptian child. At a party held by Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Coulter, Lyra states that Gyptians "''take kids and sell 'em to Turks for slaves''", although this is likely to be one of Lyra's inventions.

The Gyptians believe themselves to be "hit worse off than most" by the spate of child abductions in Northern Lights, and this may be what prompts them to collectively plan a rescue attempt. This could also be a result of Gyptians having little other recourse in society, as they are described as having little standing in the law.

Some Gyptians and half-Gyptians, such as [[List of His Dark Materials characters#Bernie Johansen|Bernie Johansen]], take up employment on land, although it appears that these are a minority. Some hide their gyptian heritage while still reporting information back to the gyptian leaders.

Serafina Pekkala's witch clan, who are based at Lake Enara, share a friendship with the Gyptians. This friendship was born from the relationship between Serafina herself and Farder Coram: Farder Coram once saved Serafina's life, and became her lover and father of her son (''who is already dead at the time of the trilogy'').

==Spectres==
'''Spectres''' are also known as the Spectres of Indifference. They are beings of spirit escaped from the void between universes. Most commonly, a Spectre is created from each new window opened by [[the Subtle Knife]]. They appear in the second and third volumes of the trilogy, ''The Subtle Knife'' and ''[[The Amber Spyglass]]''.

Spectres feed upon the [[Dust (His Dark Materials)|Dust]] that makes up a person's soul: their attack leaves a person in an immobile, [[Zombie|zombie-like]] state. They are invisible to and do not harm pre-adolescents, as Dust has not yet settled upon them. When travelling, all human groups in Cittàgazze are required by law to contain a man and woman on horseback to flee and look after the young in the case of a Spectre attack. They are normally not air-borne, so air travel over Cittàgazze is the only safe means possible for an adult to cross the city. [[Cittàgazze]], a city infested with them, is bereft of adults and filled with gangs of children.

When the effects of a Spectre attack on a human are explained to [[Will Parry (His Dark Materials)|Will]], he hypothesises that they, or similar creatures, may also exist in our universe and may cause mental illness. This opinion is formed by the case of his mother, who seems to be suffering from paranoia and other symptoms of a disorder similar to [[schizophrenia]].

Spectres cannot be killed by any physical means, although numerous methods of countering their attacks exist. Angels can neutralise Spectres, and ghosts are able to hold them in combat. Humans whose dæmons have been removed from them via [[intercision]] can pass them without being attacked, and humans can repel them with the [[Subtle Knife]]. [[Stanislaus Grumman]] uses his skills as a shaman to control one and send it onto a church zeppelin to attack the pilot, causing the craft to crash. Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Coulter convinces a group of Spectres that following her command would give them more access to prey and is thus able to control them, and is able to make them "forget that they were earthbound" (so that they can fly). Consequently, at the end of ''The Subtle Knife'', Will and Lyra's guard of witches is taken by surprise and most have their Dust consumed by Spectres while flying.

During the final battle of ''The Amber Spyglass'', Spectres fight against Lord Asriel's forces, cornering Lyra and Will's dæmons so as to eliminate the children who have been such thorns in Metatron's side, but are held back by ghosts (including [[Lee Scoresby]] and John Parry) while the children and dæmons escape to the Mulefa world.

==Mulefa==
{{anchor|Mulefa}}
'''Mulefa''' are members of a [[fictional]] species of sapient beings who inhabit a parallel [[Earth]] in the novel ''[[The Amber Spyglass]]''. "Mulefa" is plural, the singular is "zalif" (which is pronounced subtly differently for a male or a female).

These elephant-like creatures evolved a distinct [[anatomy]] based on a diamond-framed [[skeleton]] without a spine: they have four legs, short horns, and a [[prehensile]] trunk that functionally takes the place of hands. Signing with the trunk is an integral part of Mulefa language. They form close-knit communities, one of the reasons for the closeness may be that &amp;ndash; lacking hands &amp;ndash; it usually requires two or more Mulefa trunks working together to accomplish complex tasks like tying knots.

A feature of the Mulefa is their use of large, disc-shaped seed pods from their world's enormous "seed-pod trees" in [[Rolling and wheeled creatures in fiction and legend|locomotion]]; the pods fit neatly onto a spur on their front and rear legs when each zalif has grown enough to use it. They propel themselves using their other two legs, like a [[dandy horse|cyclist without pedals]]. In their world, ancient [[lava]] flows, which solidified into smooth rivers of rock running across the land, serve as roads. The Mulefa have a symbiotic relationship with the seedpod trees &amp;ndash; their use of the pods on the "roads" allows the pods' extremely hard exteriors to crack and the seeds to emerge. These are germinated by the Mulefa, allowing the seed-pod trees to reproduce. As the book notes, the three elements of seed-pod, spur, and rock formation enable the continued existence of the Mulefa.

Technologically, the Mulefa's civilization is reminiscent of humanity in the [[stone age]]. Mulefa live in [[wattle and daub|wattle-and-daub]] villages and use simple tools – there is no evidence of any form of mechanisation in their world. They do not use metal for any purpose other than ornaments. Reference is made to their domestication of the grazer herds, their non-intrusive use of trees to make lacquer, and their distilling of acid from rocks. One of their few natural enemies are huge white birds called ''[[tualapi]]'' which regularly destroy settlements with chilling ferocity, and which the Mulefa have no real defense against (save retreating further inland). The Mulefa also appear to lack any sort of organised government; they appear to live in village groups with little or no contact between settlements. The Mulefa's less advanced technology may be due to their limited trunks – the versatility and dexterity of hands giving humans an advantage. The fact that their natural environment supplies them with everything they need may also preclude any need for further development.

By their own admission &amp;ndash; to [[Mary Malone]] &amp;ndash; Mulefa have much slower thought processes than humans, and do not easily visualise abstract concepts such as those in mathematics, or easily establish links and patterns. They do however have an extraordinary race memory, remembering all of their history starting from 33,000&amp;nbsp;years previously, which is when they first interacted with the wheel-pod trees, an event captured in a story that is their [[creation myth]]. The Mulefa see this event in a very positive light. The period of 33,000&amp;nbsp;years coincides with the time frame given in the books for the awakening of human consciousness in other worlds, as evidenced by Mary Malone's anthropological research regarding [[Dust (His Dark Materials)|Dust]]. Mulefa are also able to see Dust directly without the aid of an instrument such as the amber spyglass. The oil from their pods allows them to "grow up", making them more self-aware and able to see Dust.

==Tualapi==
The '''Tualapi''' are the only known enemies of the [[Mulefa]], destroying the Mulefa's villages and causing the loss of many seed-pods. They are described as large, white birds whose wings look like ship sails from a distance. Tualapi are almost always seen in groups. [[List of His Dark Materials characters#Father Gomez|Father Gomez]], a human from Lyra's world who entered the Mulefa world, was able to repulse a Tualapi attack after killing one of them with his rifle.

The Mulefa have no defence against Tualapi other than retreating inland during their attacks. Tualapi attacks generally result in the destruction of Mulefa habitats. Like most animals from the universe of Mulefa, their limbs are in a different position than those of our animals, with a single limb (in the Tualapi's case, a wing) at the front; a pair (legs) at the middle; and a single limb (again in the case of Tualapis, a wing) at the back. Although they are similar to birds, they do not fly. Instead, they use their wings to navigate rivers as sails and rudders, and emerge onto dry land when attacking the Mulefa.

Just after he killed the first Tualapi he met, Father Gomez watches the reaction of the survivors carefully and comes to the conclusion that the creatures know about death, pain and fear, which means they can be controlled and used for greater tasks. Father Gomez manages to get control over the rest of the swarm and starts to use the Tualapi for transport, suggesting he managed to domesticate or enslave them.

==Gallivespians==
'''Gallivespians''' are a humanoid species from another universe that appear in the third volume of the trilogy. They are no taller than the width of a man's hand, so, to make up for their small size, they have poisonous spurs on the backs of their heels. These spurs can kill or cause intense pain and temporary paralysis. Their poison needs time to build up to full potency so it cannot be used frequently.

In the Gallivespian universe, "big people" (humans) serve the [[The Authority (His Dark Materials)|Authority]] and throughout history have been trying to exterminate the "little people", believing they are demonic. Because of this, most Gallivespians join with [[Lord Asriel]] against the Authority, and due to their size and proficiency at using tools capable of instant communication (called "''lodestone resonators''", which are described as using [[quantum entanglement]]), are most useful as spies. Gallivespians are proud and arrogant by nature, compensating for their small size with their massive egos. They seem to possess little subtlety, and they are good spies only due to their size.

Gallivespians use various carefully bred species of [[dragonfly|dragonflies]] for transport. They carry larvae of the species particular to their clan with them, which may be quickly cultivated into a fully grown dragonfly. Once grown and imprinted on their Gallivespian, the dragonflies are entirely obedient until death. Gallivespians themselves also have a very short life, living no more than about ten years, and dying in their prime.

In ''[[The Amber Spyglass]]'', the two Gallivespians who feature prominently are [[List of His Dark Materials characters#Chevalier Tialys|the Chevalier Tialys]] and [[List of His Dark Materials characters#Lady Salmakia|the Lady Salmakia]]. These two are initially sent to protect Lyra and Will and guide them to Lord Asriel. Lyra and Will have their own ideas, and the spies are powerless to force them into action as long as Will controls the Subtle Knife. Tialys and Salmakia eventually befriend and help Will and Lyra on their personal quest. The only two other named Gallivespians are Lord Roke, commander of the spies in Lord Asriel's Adamant Tower, the central fortress for the rebellion, and Madame Oxentiel, who succeeds to Lord Roke's position after his death.

The name ''Gallivespian'' echoes that of the [[gall wasp]]. The word [[gall]] means both an abnormal outgrowth and is a synonym for impudence or bile, whilst ''vespa'' is Latin for ''wasp''. The name also recalls the protagonist of ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', who encounters a world of tiny people.

==Cliff-ghasts and night-ghasts==
'''Cliff-ghasts''' are the more prominent type of ghasts in ''[[His Dark Materials]]''. Since many of the characters grow up in the same world as the cliff ghasts and may have encountered them before the start of the ''[[Northern Lights (novel)|Northern Lights]]'' they know what these creatures are and consequently no character at any point explains them.

Cliff-ghasts can fly, and are mortal. [[Lee Scoresby]], who hates killing sentient creatures, has no apparent qualms about killing ghasts. They are scavengers and enjoy killing and taunting. In the play adaptation they are depicted as hooded and shrouded, though in the ''Northern Lights'' they are described as having flat heads, large, bulging eyes, and wide [[frog]]-like mouths. They give off a horrible stench.

Cliff-ghasts can speak, though they do not converse with any of the characters. They are heard twice: once overheard and once talking amongst themselves as they butcher an [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Arctic foxes|Arctic fox]]. They at first seem to have no clear grasp of honour or respect even for each other, but Ruta Skadi does stumble, whilst invisible, upon the oldest cliff-ghast of all, a blind patriarch referred to as "grandfather" by all the others who take care of him and feed him. They are at first apparently one of the magic elements unique to the world of the ''Northern Lights'', but then appear in other worlds. When the great war begins, they are the only beings known not to take sides, merely waiting to feast on the casualties (although they predict the victory of Lord Asriel's forces). They also, for reasons never explained beyond that of their Grandfather's advanced age and memory, know of the Æsahættr, the Subtle Knife's existence long before any human or witch outside of Cittàgazze does, and recognise that Lord Asriel will need it in order to win the battle.

'''Night-ghasts''' are reminiscent of the [[nightmare]]s of mythology, to whom bad dreams were attributed.

The name "ghast" echoes "ghastly", which comes from an Old English root meaning "deathlike" or "terrifying".

==Deaths==
'''Deaths''' are only featured near the middle of ''The Amber Spyglass''. Much like a [[Dæmon (His Dark Materials)|dæmon]], they accompany a person throughout their life, serving to gently alert the person when it is their time to go to the underworld. Deaths are described as human-like in appearance, yet unnaturally quiet and able to blend into the background with uncanny ease. However, as most people do not wish to see their death, deaths are courteous enough to hide from their humans. Deaths are presented as caring yet stern creatures, showing no pity for a person's dæmon which must vanish upon death. Deaths are present in a physical form in some worlds, much as dæmons can be seen in Lyra's. Deaths can disappear in a similar manner to dæmons. In ''The Amber Spyglass'' a dead girl says that her death "went forever".&lt;ref&gt;The Amber Spyglass Page 301&lt;/ref&gt; Lyra is confronted with her death when she and Will enter the underworld in order to contact the ghost of Lyra's dead friend, Roger.

==Ghosts==
In the trilogy, all people have a '''ghost''' which lives on after they die, ghosts have vague forms resembling the person when alive. Unlike a dæmon, which dissipates upon a person's death, the ghost is led away by their death and becomes trapped indefinitely in the underworld. Will and Lyra remedy this by causing all the ghosts to escape from the underworld. When the ghosts enter the real world, they disintegrate and become disconnected atoms reuniting with the rest of the universe.

==Harpies==
Harpies in ''His Dark Materials'' are portrayed as being similar in form to the [[Harpy|harpies]] of myths and legends, having human heads on birdlike torsos including wings. In ''His Dark Materials'', they are the guardians of the [[Locations in His Dark Materials#The Land of the Dead|Land of the Dead]], harassing the ghosts without mercy. They appear to hunger for information and knowledge in the form of stories, and appear to have the supernatural ability to know when they are being lied to and use their knowledge of this and other wrongful acts committed in life by their victims to torment them. When, in ''The Amber Spyglass'', Lyra and Will open a portal from the Land of the Dead to allow the ghosts to escape, the Harpies are given the new task of guiding arriving ghosts to the portal. The Harpies are also entitled to question the ghosts, requiring them to tell the stories of their lives and any knowledge they have gained. They are entitled to deny ghosts guidance to the portal (potentially trapping them in the Land of the Dead for eternity) if they have "nothing of value" to tell (and are old enough to be expected to) or if they lie.

'''Region of Freshwater Influence''' (ROFI), a term coined by Prof. John Simpson&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.sos.bangor.ac.uk/staff/php/staffdetails1.php?person=0022 |title= Biography |author= John Simpson |work=  |publisher= [[University of Wales, Bangor]] |accessdate= 2009-10-29 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110716205120/http://www.sos.bangor.ac.uk/staff/php/staffdetails1.php?person=0022 |archivedate= 2011-07-16 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[University of Wales, Bangor]], and co-authors, in 1993 in Oceanologica Acta&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simpson |first1= J.H.|last2= Bos|first2= W.G. |author3=F.

The term refers to regions where [[river]]s [[debouch]] into [[estuary|estuaries]] and coastal [[shelf sea]]s where the currents patterns are governed by density differences between salt [[sea water]] and fresh river water. In other words, a ROFI is the region between the shelf sea regime and the estuary where the local input of freshwater buoyancy from the coastal source is comparable with, or exceeds, the seasonal input of buoyancy as heat which occurs all over the shelf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simpson |first1= J.H.|last2= |first2= |year= 1997|title= Physical processes in the ROFI regime|journal= Journal of Marine Systems|volume= |issue= 12|pages= 3–15|url= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Americans usually use the term river plume where Europeans use ROFI.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1736">The [[Bayer designation]] '''Rho Sagittarii''' ('''Rho&amp;nbsp;Sgr''', '''ρ&amp;nbsp;Sagittarii''', '''ρ&amp;nbsp;Sgr''') is shared by two [[star]]s in the [[constellation]] [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]].

* [[Rho2 Sagittarii|ρ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Sagittarii]]&lt;ref name=SIMBAD2/&gt;

The two stars are separated by 0.46° in the sky. Because they are close to the [[ecliptic]], they can be [[occulted]] by the [[Moon]] and, very rarely, by [[planet]]s. The next occultation of ρ¹ Sagittarii by a planet will take place on 23 February 2046, when it will be occulted by [[Venus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3147">The terms '''river morphology''' and its synonym [[stream]] morphology are used to describe the shapes of [[river]] [[channel (geography)|channels]] and how they change in shape and direction over time. The morphology of a river channel is a function of a number of processes and environmental conditions, including the composition and [[erodibility]] of the [[stream bed|bed]] and [[stream bank|banks]] (e.g., sand, clay, bedrock); [[erosion]] comes from the power and consistency of the current, and can effect the formation of the river's path.  Also, [[vegetation]] and the rate of plant growth; the availability of [[sediment]]; the size and composition of the sediment moving through the channel; the rate of [[sediment transport]] through the channel and the rate of deposition on the [[floodplain]], banks, [[bar (river morphology)|bars]], and bed; and regional [[aggradation]] or [[Degradation (geology)|degradation]] due to [[subsidence]] or [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]]. River morphology can also be effected by human interaction, which is a way the river responds to a new factor in how the river can change its course. An example of human induced change in river morphology is dam construction, which alters the ebb flow of fluvial water and sediment, therefore creating or shrinking estuarine channels.&lt;ref&gt;Bo-yuan Zhu,Yi-tian Li,Yao Yue,Yun-ping Yang. Aggravation of north channels' shrinkage and south channels' development in the Yangtze Estuary under dam-induced runoff discharge flattening. Journal Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science. 5 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; A [[river regime]] is a dynamic equilibrium  system, which is a way of classifying rivers into different categories. The four categories of river regimes are Sinuous canali- form rivers, Sinuous point bar rivers, Sinuous braided rivers, and Non-sinuous braided rivers.

The study of river morphology is accomplished in the field of [[fluvial]] [[geomorphology]], the scientific term.

{{Band structure filling diagram}}

A '''semimetal''' is a material with a very small overlap between the bottom of the [[Electrical conduction|conduction]] [[Electronic band structure|band]] and the top of the [[valence band]].
According to [[Band theory|electronic band theory]], solids can be classified as [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]], [[semiconductor]]s, semimetals, or [[metal]]s. In insulators and semiconductors the filled valence band is separated from an empty conduction band by a [[band gap]]. For insulators, the magnitude of the band gap is larger (e.g. &gt; 4 [[Electronvolt|eV]]) than that of a semiconductor (e.g. &lt; 4 eV). [[Metal]]s have a partially filled conduction band. A semimetal is a material with a very small overlap between the bottom of the [[Electrical conduction|conduction]] [[Electronic band structure|band]] and the top of the [[valence band]]. A semimetal thus has no band gap and a negligible  [[density of states]] at the [[Fermi level]]. A metal, by contrast, has an appreciable density of states at the Fermi level because the conduction band is partially filled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|pages=339–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Temperature dependency ==
The insulating/semiconducting states differ from the semimetallic/metallic states in the [[temperature]] dependency of their [[electrical conductivity]]. With a metal (which has only one type of charge carrier – [[electron]]s), the conductivity decreases with increases in temperature (due to increasing interaction of electrons with [[phonon]]s (lattice vibrations)). With an insulator or semiconductor (which have two types of charge carriers – [[Electron hole|holes]] and electrons), both the carrier mobilities and carrier concentrations will contribute to the conductivity and these have different temperature dependencies.  Ultimately, it is observed that the conductivity of insulators and semiconductors increase with initial increases in temperature above [[absolute zero]] (as more electrons are shifted to the conduction band), before decreasing with intermediate temperatures and then, once again, increasing with still higher temperatures.  The semimetallic state is similar to the metallic state but in semimetals both holes and electrons contribute to electrical conduction. With some semimetals, like [[arsenic]] and [[antimony]], there is a temperature-independent carrier density below room temperature (as in metals) while, in [[bismuth]], this is true at very low temperatures but at higher temperatures the carrier density increases with temperature giving rise to a semimetal-semiconductor transition.  A semimetal also differs from an insulator or semiconductor in that a semimetal's conductivity is always non-zero, whereas a semiconductor has zero conductivity at zero temperature and insulators have zero conductivity even at ambient temperatures (due to a wider band gap).

== Classification ==
To classify semiconductors and semimetals, the energies of their filled and empty bands must be plotted against the [[crystal momentum]] of conduction electrons. According to the [[Bloch theorem]] the conduction of electrons depends on the periodicity of the crystal lattice in different directions.

In a semimetal, the bottom of the conduction band is typically situated in a different part of momentum space (at a different [[wave vector|'''k'''-vector]]) than the top of the valence band. One could say that a semimetal is a [[semiconductor]] with a negative [[indirect bandgap]], although they are seldom described in those terms.

== Schematic ==
[[File:Semimetal.PNG|frame|This diagram illustrates a direct semiconductor (A), an indirect semiconductor (B), and a semimetal (C).]]
Schematically, the figure shows
:A) a semiconductor with a direct gap (e.g. [[copper indium selenide]] (CuInSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;))
:B) a semiconductor with an indirect gap (like [[silicon]] (Si))
:C) a semimetal (like [[tin]] (Sn) or [[graphite]] and the [[alkaline earth metal]]s).

The figure is schematic, showing only the lowest-energy conduction band and the highest-energy valence band in one dimension of [[momentum space]] (or k-space). In typical solids, k-space is three-dimensional, and there are an infinite number of bands.

Unlike a regular [[metal]], semimetals have charge carriers of both types (holes and electrons), so that one could also argue that they should be called 'double-metals' rather than semimetals. However, the charge carriers typically occur in much smaller numbers than in a real metal. In this respect they resemble [[degenerate semiconductor]]s more closely. This explains why the electrical properties of semimetals are partway between those of metals and [[semiconductors]].

== Physical properties ==
As semimetals have fewer charge carriers than metals, they typically have lower [[electrical conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity|thermal conductivities]]. They also have small effective masses for both holes and electrons because the overlap in energy is usually the result of the fact that both energy bands are broad. In addition they typically show high [[diamagnetic]] susceptibilities and high lattice [[dielectric constant]]s.

== Classic semimetals ==
The classic semimetallic elements are [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], [[bismuth]], α-[[tin]] (gray tin) and [[graphite]], an [[allotrope]] of [[carbon]]. The first two (As, Sb) are also considered [[metalloids]] but the terms semimetal and metalloid are not synonymous. Semimetals, in contrast to metalloids, can also be [[chemical compound]]s, such as [[mercury telluride]] (HgTe),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6194">The '''sorption pump''' is a [[vacuum pump]] that creates a [[vacuum]] by adsorbing molecules on a very porous material like [[molecular sieve]] which is cooled by a [[cryogen]], typically [[liquid nitrogen]]. The ultimate pressure is about 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; [[mbar]]. With special techniques this can be lowered till 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; mbar. The main advantages are the absence of oil or other contaminants, low cost and vibration free operation because there are no [[moving parts]]. The main disadvantages are that it cannot operate continuously and cannot effectively pump [[hydrogen]], [[helium]] and [[neon]], all gases with lower condensation temperature than liquid nitrogen. The main application is as a [[roughing pump]] for a [[Ion pump (physics)|sputter-ion pump]] in [[ultra-high vacuum]] experiments, for example in [[surface physics]].

==Construction==
A sorption pump is usually constructed in [[stainless steel]], [[aluminium]] or [[borosilicate glass]]. It can be a simple [[Pyrex]] flask filled with molecular sieve or an elaborate metal construction consisting of a metal flask containing perforated tubing and heat-conducting fins. A [[pressure relief valve]] can be installed. The design only influences the pumping speed and not the ultimate pressure that can be reached. The design details are a trade-off between fast cooling using heat conducting fins and high [[gas conductance]] using perforated tubing.

The typical molecular sieve used is a synthetic [[zeolite]] with a pore diameter around 0.4 [[nanometer]] ( Type 4A ) and a surface area of about 500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g. The sorption pump contains between 300 g and 1.2&amp;nbsp;kg of molecular sieve. A 15-liter system will be pumped down to about 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; mbar by 300 g molecular sieve.&lt;ref name="nh"&gt;''Modern Vacuum Practice'', Nigel S. Harris, 3rd ed. 2005, chapter 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
The sorption pump is a cyclic pump and its cycle has 3 phases: sorption, desorption and regeneration.

In the [[sorption]] phase the pump is actually used to create a vacuum. This is achieved by cooling the pump body to low temperatures, typically by immersing it in a [[Vacuum flask|Dewar flask]] filled with liquid nitrogen. Gases will now either [[condense]] or be [[adsorbed]] by the large surface of the molecular sieve.

In the [[desorption]] phase the pump is allowed warm up to room temperature and the gases escape through the pressure relief valve or other opening to the atmosphere. If the pump has been used to pump toxic, flammable or other dangerous gasses one has to be careful to vent safely into the atmosphere as all gases pumped during the sorption phase will be released during the desorption phase.

In the regeneration phase the pump body is heated to 300&amp;nbsp;°C to drive off water vapor that does not desorb at room temperature and accumulates in the molecular sieve. It takes typically 2 hours to fully regenerate a pump.&lt;ref name="nh" /&gt;

The pump can be used in a cycle of sorption and desorption until it loses too much efficiency and is regenerated or in a cycle where sorption and desorption are always followed by regeneration.

After filling a sorption pump with new molecular sieve it should always be regenerated as the new molecular sieve is probably saturated with [[water vapor]]. Also when a pump is not in use it should be closed off from the atmosphere to prevent water vapor saturation.

==Performance improvement==
Pumping capacity can be improved by prepumping the system by another simple and clean vacuum pump like a [[diaphragm pump]] or even a [[water aspirator]] or compressed-air [[venturi pump]].

'''Sequential or multistage pumping''' can be used to attain lower pressures. In this case two or more pumps are connected in parallel to the vacuum vessel. Every pump has a valve to isolate it from the vacuum vessel. At the start of the pump down all valves are open. The first pump is cooled down while the others are still hot. When the first pump has reached its ultimate pressure it is closed off and the next pump is cooled down. Final pressures are in the 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; mbar region. What is left is mainly helium because it is almost not pumped at all.&lt;ref name="vt"&gt;''Vacuum Technology'', A. Roth, 3rd ed. 1990, chapter 5.5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The final pressure almost equals the partial pressure of helium in air.

A sorption pump does pump all gases effectively with the exception of hydrogen, helium and neon which do not condensate at liquid nitrogen temperatures and are not efficiently adsorbed by the molecular sieves because of their small molecular size. This problem can be solved by purging the vacuum system with dry pure nitrogen before pump down. In purged system with aspirator rough pumping ultimate pressures of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; mbar for a single sorption pump and 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; mbar for sequential pumping can be reached.&lt;ref name="bsa"&gt;''Building Scientific Apparatus'', John H. Moore et al., 3rd ed. 2003, chapter 3.6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A typical source of dry pure nitrogen would be a liquid nitrogen Dewar head space.

It has been suggested&lt;ref name="hvt"&gt;''High-Vacuum Technology: A Practical Guide'', Marsbed H. Hablanian, 2nd ed. 1997, chapter 5.8.5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; that by applying a dynamic pumping technique hydrogen, helium and neon can also be pumped without resorting to dry nitrogen purging. This is done by precooling the pump with the valve to the vacuum vessel closed. The valve is opened when the pump is cold and the inrush of adsorbable gases will carry all other gases into the pump. The valve is closed before hydrogen, helium or neon can [[back-migrate]] into the vacuum vessel. Sequential pumping can also be applied. No final pressures are given.

'''Continuous pumping''' may be simulated by using two pumps in parallel and letting one pump pump the system while the other pump, temporally sealed-off from the system, is in the desorption phase and venting to the atmosphere. When the pump is well desorbed it is cooled down and reconnected to the system. The other pump is sealed-off and goes into desorption. This becomes a continuous cycle.&lt;ref name="vt" /&gt;

'''String''' is a long flexible [[structure]] made from [[fiber]]s twisted together into a single strand, or from multiple such strands which are in turn twisted together.  String is used to tie, bind, or hang other objects. It is also used as a material to make things, such as textiles, and in arts and crafts. String is a simple [[tool]], and its use by humans is known to have been developed tens of thousands of years ago.&lt;ref name="Evans and Webster"&gt;Susan Toby Evans, David L. Webster, ''Archaeology of Ancient Mexico and Central America: An Encyclopedia'' (2013), p. 812.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mesoamerica]], for example, string was invented some 20,000 to 30,000 years ago, and was made by twisting plant fibers together.&lt;ref name="Evans and Webster"/&gt; String may also be a component in other tools, and in devices as diverse as weapons, musical instruments, and toys. [[File:Blue+Red String Under Microscope (40x).jpg|thumb|Two pieces of string under a light microscope]]

== History ==

String was used in prehistoric times to make fire, as part of a drilling tool called the [[bow drill]], which makes [[Firelighting#Friction|fire by friction]].&lt;ref name="Hodge2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick Webb Hodge|title=Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico V. 1/4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WmQgh7i-LdQC&amp;pg=PA402|date=1 July 2003|publisher=Digital Scanning Inc|isbn=978-1-58218-748-8|pages=402–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bow drills were used in [[Mehrgarh]] between the 4th and 5th millennium BC. Similar drills were found in other parts of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] and [[Iran]] one millennium later. In Roman times, the same principle also was used widely in drilling for purposes of [[woodworking]]&lt;ref name="Ulrich2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger Bradley Ulrich|title=Roman Woodworking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DDh5yOgfnuoC&amp;pg=PA30|year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-10341-7|pages=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dentistry]].&lt;ref name="GargGarg2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nisha Garg|author2=Amit Garg|title=Textbook of Operative Dentistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WredzxNmeUMC&amp;pg=PA103|date=30 December 2012|publisher=JP Medical Ltd|isbn=978-93-5025-939-9|pages=103–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macramé comes from a 13th-century Arabic weavers’ word migramah meaning “fringe”. This refers to the decorative fringes on camels and horses which help, amongst other things, to keep the flies off the animal in the hot desert regions of northern Africa. One of the earliest recorded uses of macramé style knots as decoration appeared in the carvings of the Babylonians and Assyrians. Fringe-like plaiting and braiding adorned the costumes of the time and were captured in their stone statuary.

== Types ==

There are many types of string, adapted to many uses. Here are some examples:

=== Twine ===
{{Main|Twine}}

[[Twine]] is a light string or strong thread composed of two or more smaller strands or [[yarn]]s twisted, and then twisted together.  More generally, the term can be applied to a cord. [[Natural fibre]]s used for making twine include [[cotton]], [[sisal]], [[jute]], [[hemp]], [[henequen]], and [[coir]].  A variety of [[synthetic fibre]]s are also used.

=== Yarn ===
{{Main|Yarn}}

[[Yarn]] is a long continuous length of interlocked [[fibre]]s, suitable for use in the production of [[textile]]s, [[sewing]], [[crochet]]ing, [[knitting]], [[weaving]], [[embroidery]], and [[rope]]making.&lt;ref name=definition&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/yarn|title=Yarn|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thread (yarn)|Thread]] is a type of yarn intended for sewing by hand or [[sewing machine|machine]]. Modern manufactured sewing threads may be finished with [[wax]] or other lubricants to withstand the stresses involved in sewing.&lt;ref&gt;Kadolph, Sara J., ed.: ''Textiles'', 10th edition, Pearson/Prentice-Hall, 2007, {{ISBN|0-13-118769-4}}, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; [[Embroidery thread]]s are yarns specifically designed for hand or [[machine embroidery]].

==== Thread ====
{{Main|Thread (yarn)}}

[[Thread (yarn)|Thread]] is a type of yarn used for sewing. Thread is made from a wide variety of materials. The following table lists common materials, a general description and what they are supposed to be good for. If your machine will sew with the thread, any thread can used for just about any purpose. This is very useful for someone who is trying to learn sewing. However, it should be remembered that where a thread is stronger than the material that it is being used to join, if seams are placed under strain the material may tear before the thread breaks. Garments are usually sewn with threads of lesser strength than the fabric so that if stressed the seam will break before the garment. Heavy goods that must withstand considerable stresses such as upholstery, car seating, tarpaulins, tents, and saddlery require very strong threads. Attempting repairs with light weight thread will usually result in rapid failure, though again, using a thread that is stronger than the material being sewn can end up causing rips in that material before the thread itself gives way.

=== Bowstring ===
{{Main|Bowstring}}

A [[bowstring]] joins the two ends of the [[Bow and arrow|bow]] stave and launches the [[arrow]]. Desirable properties include light weight, strength, resistance to [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]], and resistance to water. [[Mass]] has most effect at the center of the string; {{convert|1|g|spell=in}} of extra mass in the middle of the string slows the arrow about as much as {{convert|3.5|g}} at the ends.&lt;ref&gt;''Design and Construction of Flight Bows - a supplement to "The Design and Construction of Composite Recurve Bows"'' by John Clark. Ausbow Industries, not dated&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional materials include [[linen]], [[hemp]], other vegetable fibers, [[sinew]], [[silk]], and [[rawhide (textile)|rawhide]]. Almost any fiber may be used in emergency.

=== Drawstring ===
[[File:Felpa.JPG|thumb|right|[[Hoodie]] with drawstring]]
{{Main|Drawstring}}

A [[drawstring]] (draw string, draw-string) is a string, cord, lace, or rope used to "draw" (gather, or shorten) fabric or other material. The ends of the drawstring may be tied to hold it in place (and/or simultaneously close an opening). Alternately, the drawstring may be kept drawn using a cordlock. Typically, the drawstring is loose when not being used, and tightened when needed during use.

=== Pullstring ===
{{Main|Pullstring}}

A [[pullstring]] (pull string, pull-string), pullcord (pull cord, pull-cord), or pullchain (pull-chain, pull chain) is a string, cord, or chain wound on a spring-loaded spindle that engages a mechanism when it is pulled. It is most commonly used in toys and motorized equipment. More generally and commonly, a pullstring can be any type of string, cord, rope, chain, or cable attached to an object in some way used to pull or mechanically manipulate part of it.

=== Shoestrings ===
{{Main|Shoelaces}}

[[Shoelaces]], also called shoestrings (US English) or '''bootlaces''' (UK English), are a system commonly used to secure [[shoes]], [[boot]]s and other [[footwear]].They typically consist of a pair of strings or cords, one for each shoe, finished off at both ends with stiff sections, known as [[aglet]]s. Each shoelace typically passes through a series of holes, eyelets, loops or hooks on either side of the shoe. Loosening the lacing allows the shoe to open wide enough for the foot to be inserted or removed. Tightening the lacing and tying off the ends secures the foot within the shoe.

=== Strings on musical instruments ===
{{Main|String (music)}}

In music, a [[string (music)|string]] is the [[Vibrating string|vibrating element]] that produces [[sound]] in [[string instrument]]s such as the [[guitar]], [[harp]], [[piano]] ([[piano wire]]), and members of the [[violin family]]. Strings are lengths of a flexible material that a [[musical instrument]] holds under [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] so that they can vibrate freely, but controllably. Strings may be "plain" (consisting only of a single material, like [[catgut]], [[nylon]], or [[steel]]). "Wound" strings have a "core" of one material, with an overwinding of other materials. This is to make the string vibrate at the desired pitch, while maintaining a low profile and sufficient flexibility for playability.

The invention of wound strings, such as nylon covered in wound metal, was a crucial step in string instrument technology, because a metal-wound string can produce a lower pitch than a catgut string of similar thickness. This enabled stringed instruments to be made with less thick bass strings. On string instruments that the player plucks or bows directly (e.g., [[double bass]]), this enabled instrument makers to use thinner strings for the lowest-pitched strings, which made the lower-pitch strings easier to play. On stringed instruments in which the player presses a [[keyboard (music)|keyboard]], causing a mechanism to strike the strings, such as a [[piano]], this enabled piano builders to use shorter, thicker strings to produce the lowest-pitched bass notes, enabling the building of smaller [[upright piano]]s designed for small rooms and practice rooms.

=== Tennis strings ===
{{Main|Strings (tennis)}}

In tennis, the strings are the part of a tennis racquet which make contact with the ball. The strings form a woven network inside the head (or "hoop") of the racquet. Strings have been made with a variety of materials and possess varying properties that have been measured, such as dynamic stiffness, tension retention, thickness (gauge), string texture (shape of the string), and rebound efficiency.&lt;ref name="racquetsportsindustry.com"&gt;[http://www.racquetsportsindustry.com/articles/2010/01/string_selector_2010.html String Selector 2010, Racquet Sports Industry Magazine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008023114/http://www.racquetsportsindustry.com/articles/2010/01/string_selector_2010.html |date=2010-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further uses and applications ==

=== Chalk line ===
{{Main|Chalk line}}

A [[chalk line]] or chalk box is a tool for marking long, straight lines on relatively flat surfaces, much farther than is practical by hand or with a straightedge. It is an important tool in construction and carpentry, the working of timber in a rough and unplaned state, as it does not require the timber to have a straight or squared edge formed onto it beforehand. A chalk line draws straight lines by the action of a taut nylon or similar string that has been previously coated with a loose dye, usually chalk. The string is then laid across the surface to be marked and pulled tight. Next, the string is then plucked or snapped sharply, causing the string to strike the surface, which then transfers its chalk to the surface along that straight line where it struck.

=== Cloth ===
{{Main|Textile}}

A [[textile]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/textile|title=Textile|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; or cloth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cloth|title=Cloth|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a flexible material consisting of a network of natural or artificial [[fibre]]s ([[yarn]] or [[Thread (yarn)|thread]]). Yarn is produced by [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] raw fibres of [[wool]], [[flax]], [[cotton]], or other material to produce long strands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=An Introduction to Textile Terms | url=http://www.textilemuseum.org/PDFs/TextileTerms.pdf | accessdate=August 6, 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723073411/http://www.textilemuseum.org/PDFs/TextileTerms.pdf | archivedate=July 23, 2006 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Textiles are formed by [[weaving]], [[knitting]], [[crochet]]ing, [[Macramé|knotting]], or [[felt]]ing.

=== Clothes line ===
{{Main|Clothes line}}

A clothes line or washing line is any type of rope, cord, or twine that has been stretched between two points (e.g. two sticks), outside or indoors, above the level of the ground. Clothing that has recently been washed is hung along the line to dry, using clothes pegs or clothespins. Washing lines are attached either from a post or a wall, and are frequently located in back gardens, or on balconies. Longer washing lines often have props holding up sections in the middle due to the weight of the usually wet clothing.

=== Bead stringing ===
{{Main|Bead stringing}}

[[Bead stringing]] is the putting of [[bead]]s on string. It can range from simply sliding a single bead onto any thread-like medium (string, [[silk]] thread, [[leather]] [[strap|thong]], thin [[wire]], multi-stranded beading wire, or a soft, flexible wire) to complex creations that have multiple strands or interwoven levels.  The choice of stringing medium can be an important point in the overall design, since string-type mediums might be subject to unwanted stretching if the weight of the beads is considerable.  Similarly, certain bead types with sharp edges, such as hollow metal beads or some varieties of stone or glass, might abrade the string and cause the strand to eventually break.

=== Knot tying ===
{{Main|Knot|List of knots}}

A [[knot]] is a method of fastening or securing linear material such as string by tying or interweaving. It may consist of a length of one or several segments of string, twine, cord, strap, rope, or even chain interwoven such that the line can bind to itself or to some other object (the "load").

=== Macramé ===
{{Main|Macramé}}

Macramé or macrame is a form of textile-making using knotting rather than weaving or knitting. Its primary knots are the square knot (a variant of the reef knot) and forms of "hitching": full hitch and double half hitches. It was long crafted by sailors, especially in elaborate or ornamental knotting forms, to decorate anything from knife handles to bottles to parts of ships.

=== Plumb bob ===
{{Main|Plumb bob}}

A [[plumb bob]], or plummet, is a weight, usually with a pointed tip on the bottom, suspended from a string and used as a vertical reference line, or plumb-line. It is essentially the vertical equivalent of a "water level".

=== String art ===
{{Main|String art}}

'''String art''', or '''pin and thread art''', is characterized by an arrangement of colored thread strung between points to form  [[geometric pattern]]s or representational designs such as a ship's [[sail]]s, sometimes with other artist material comprising the remainder of the work. Thread, wire, or string is wound around a grid of nails hammered into a [[velvet]]-covered wooden board. Though straight lines are formed by the string, the slightly different angles and metric positions at which strings intersect gives the appearance of [[Bézier curve]]s (as in the mathematical concept of [[envelope (mathematics)|envelope]] of a family of straight lines). [[Bézier curve#Quadratic curves|Quadratic Bézier curve]] are obtained from strings based on two intersecting segments. Other forms of string art include [[Spirelli]], which is used for [[cardmaking]] and [[scrapbooking]], and curve stitching, in which string is stitched through holes.

==== String figures ====
{{Main|String figure|List of string figures}}

A [[string figure]] is a design formed by manipulating string on, around, and using one's fingers or sometimes between the fingers of multiple people. String figures may also involve the use of the mouth, wrist, and feet. They may consist of singular images or be created and altered as a game, known as a string game, or as part of a story involving various figures made in sequence (string story).

=== String toys ===

==== Astrojax ====
{{Main|Astrojax}}

[[Astrojax]] is a toy consisting of three balls on a string. One ball is fixed at each end of the string, and the center ball is free to slide along the string between the two end balls. Inside each ball is a metal weight. The metal weight lowers the moment of inertia of the center ball so it can rotate rapidly in response to torques applied by the string. This prevents the string from snagging or tangling around the center ball.

==== Yo-yo ====
{{Main|Yo-yo}}

A [[yo-yo]] A '''yo-yo''' (also spelled '''yoyo''') is a [[toy]] which in its simplest form is an object consisting of an [[axle]] connected to two [[cylinder|disks]], and a length of string looped around the axle, similar to a slender [[wikt:spool|spool]]. It is played by holding the free end of the string known as the handle (usually by inserting one finger into a [[slip knot]]) allowing gravity or the force of a throw to spin the yo-yo and unwind the string (similar to how a [[pullstring]] works), then allowing the yo-yo to wind itself back to one's hand, exploiting its spin (and the associated [[rotational energy]]). This is often called "yo-yoing". First made popular in the 1920s, yo-yoing remains a popular pastime of many generations and cultures. It was first invented in [[ancient Greece]].

=== Weaving ===
{{Main|Weaving}}

[[Weaving]] is a method of [[textile]] production &lt;!--[[textile arts|textile craft]]--&gt; in which two distinct sets of [[yarn|yarns or threads]] are interlaced at right angles to form a [[textile|fabric]] or [[cloth]]. Other methods are [[knitting]], [[felt]]ing, and [[braid]]ing or [[Braid|plaiting]]. The longitudinal threads are called the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] and the lateral threads are the [[weft]] or filling. (''Weft'' or ''woof'' is an old [[English (language)|English]] word meaning "that which is woven".{{efn|deriving from an obsolete [[past participle]] of ''weave'' ([[Oxford English Dictionary]], see "weft" and "weave".}}) The method in which these threads are inter woven affects the characteristics of the cloth.&lt;ref name=Collier92&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier|1974|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cloth is usually woven on a [[loom]], a device that holds the warp threads in place while filling threads are woven through them. A fabric band which meets this definition of cloth (warp threads with a weft thread winding between) can also be made using other methods, including [[tablet weaving]], back-strap, or other techniques without looms.&lt;ref name="Dooley"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dooley|1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pangaea continents.svg|thumb|Map of [[Pangaea]] with modern continental outlines.]]

The '''supercontinent cycle''' is the [[Quasiperiodicity|quasi-periodic]] aggregation and dispersal of [[Earth]]'s [[continental crust]]. There are varying opinions as to whether the amount of continental crust is increasing, decreasing, or staying about the same, but it is agreed that the Earth's crust is constantly being reconfigured. One complete [[supercontinent]] cycle is said to take 300 to 500&amp;nbsp;million years. [[Continental collision]] makes fewer and larger continents while [[rifting]] makes more and smaller continents.

==Description==
[[File:Platetechsimple.png|thumb|right|Simplistic representation of the supercontinent cycle to modern day.]]
{{see also|List of supercontinents}}
The most recent supercontinent, [[Pangaea]], formed about 300&amp;nbsp;million years ago (0.3 Ga). There are two different views on the history of earlier supercontinents. The first proposes a series of supercontinents: [[Vaalbara]] ({{circa}} 3.6 to c. 2.8&amp;nbsp;billion years ago); [[Ur (continent)|Ur]] ({{circa}} 3&amp;nbsp;billion years ago); [[Kenorland]] ({{circa}} 2.7 to 2.1&amp;nbsp;billion years ago); [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]] ({{circa}} 1.8 to 1.5&amp;nbsp;billion years ago); [[Rodinia]] ({{circa}} 1.25&amp;nbsp;billion to 750&amp;nbsp;million years ago); and [[Pannotia]] ({{circa}} 600&amp;nbsp;million years ago), whose dispersal produced the fragments that ultimately collided to form Pangaea.&lt;ref name="Zhao1"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0012-8252(02)00073-9 |first=Guochun |last=Zhao |last2 = Cawood |first2=Peter A. |last3=Wilde |first3=Simon A. |last4=Sun |first4=M. |year=2002|title=Review of global 2.1–1.8&amp;nbsp;Ga orogens: implications for a pre-Rodinia supercontinent |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=59 |issue=1–4 |pages=125–162 |bibcode=2002ESRv...59..125Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhao2"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2004.02.003 |first=Guochun |last=Zhao |last2=Sun |first2=M. |last3=Wilde |first3=Simon A. |last4= Li |first4=S.&amp;nbsp;Z. |year=2004|title=A Paleo-Mesoproterozoic supercontinent: assembly, growth and breakup |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=67 |issue=1–2 |pages=91–123 |bibcode=2004ESRv...67...91Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second view (Protopangea-Paleopangea), based on both [[Paleomagnetism|palaeomagnetic]] and geological evidence, is that supercontinent cycles did not occur before about 0.6&amp;nbsp;[[Gigayear#SI prefix multipliers|Ga]] (during the [[Ediacaran]] Period). Instead, the continental crust comprised a single supercontinent from about 2.7&amp;nbsp;Ga (Gigaannum, or "billion years ago") until it broke up for the first time, somewhere around 0.6&amp;nbsp;Ga. This reconstruction&lt;ref name='piper'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piper |first=J.&amp;nbsp;D.&amp;nbsp;A. |title=A planetary perspective on Earth evolution: Lid Tectonics before Plate Tectonics |journal=Tectonophysics |volume=589 |date=2013 |pages=44–56 |doi= 10.1016/j.tecto.2012.12.042|bibcode=2013Tectp.589...44P }}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the observation that if only small peripheral modifications are made to the primary reconstruction, the data show that the palaeomagnetic poles converged to quasi-static positions for long intervals between about 2.7–2.2, 1.5–1.25 and 0.75–0.6&amp;nbsp;Ga.&lt;ref name='piper2'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piper |first=J.&amp;nbsp;D.&amp;nbsp;A. |title=Continental velocity through geological time: the link to magmatism, crustal accretion and episodes of global cooling |journal=Geoscience Frontiers |volume=4 |date=2013 |pages=7–36 |doi= 10.1016/j.gsf.2012.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the intervening periods, the poles appear to have conformed to a unified [[apparent polar wander]] path. Thus the paleomagnetic data are adequately explained by the existence of a single Protopangea–Paleopangea supercontinent with prolonged quasi-integrity. The prolonged duration of this supercontinent could be explained by the operation of [[lid tectonics]] (comparable to the tectonics operating on Mars and Venus) during [[Precambrian]] times, as opposed to the [[plate tectonics]] seen on the contemporary Earth.&lt;ref name=piper /&gt;
  
The kinds of minerals found inside ancient diamonds suggest that the cycle of supercontinental formation and breakup began roughly 3.0&amp;nbsp;billion years ago (3.0 Ga). Before 3.2&amp;nbsp;billion years ago only diamonds with [[peridot]]itic compositions (commonly found in the Earth's mantle) formed, whereas after 3.0&amp;nbsp;billion years ago eclogitic diamonds (rocks from the Earth's surface crust) became prevalent. This change is thought to have come about as subduction and continental collision introduced [[eclogite]] into subcontinental diamond-forming fluids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shirey | first1 = S.&amp;nbsp;B. | last2 = Richardson | first2 = S.&amp;nbsp;H. | doi = 10.1126/science.1206275 | title = Start of the Wilson Cycle at 3&amp;nbsp;Ga Shown by Diamonds from Subcontinental Mantle | journal = Science | volume = 333 | issue = 6041 | pages = 434–436 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21778395| pmc = | bibcode = 2011Sci...333..434S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wilson-cycle hg.svg|thumb|The supercontinent cycle and the Wilson cycle produced the supercontinents Rodinia and Pangaea]]
The hypothesized supercontinent cycle is overlaid by the [[Wilson cycle]] named after [[plate tectonics]] pioneer [[J. Tuzo Wilson]], which describes the periodic opening and closing of [[ocean basin]]s from a single plate rift. The oldest seafloor material found today dates to only 170&amp;nbsp;million years old, whereas the oldest continental crust material found today dates to 4&amp;nbsp;billion years, showing the relative brevity of the regional Wilson cycles compared to the planetary pulse seen in the arrangement of the continents.

==Effects on sea level==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
It is known that [[sea level]] is generally low when the continents are together and high when they are apart. For example, sea level was low at the time of formation of Pangaea ([[Permian]]) and Pannotia (latest [[Neoproterozoic]]), and rose rapidly to maxima during [[Ordovician]] and [[Cretaceous]] times, when the continents were dispersed. This is because the age of the [[oceanic lithosphere]] provides a major control on the depth of the ocean basins, and therefore on global sea level. Oceanic lithosphere forms at [[mid-ocean ridges]] and moves outwards, [[thermal conduction|conductively cooling]] and [[thermal expansion|shrinking]], which decreases the thickness and increases the density of the oceanic lithosphere, and lowers the seafloor away from mid-ocean ridges. For oceanic lithosphere that is less than about 75&amp;nbsp;million years old, a simple cooling [[Half-space (geometry)|half-space]] model of conductive cooling works, in which the depth of the ocean basins ''d'' in areas in which there is no nearby [[subduction]] is a function of the age of the oceanic lithosphere ''t''. In general,

:&lt;math&gt;d(t) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} a_{\rm eff} T_1 \sqrt{\kappa t} + d_{\rm r}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''κ'' is the [[thermal diffusivity]] of the mantle lithosphere ({{circa}} {{val|8|e=-7|u=[[meter|m]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/[[second|s]]}}), ''a''&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; is the effective [[thermal expansion coefficient]] for rock ({{circa}} {{val|5.7|e=-5|u=°C&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}), ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the temperature of ascending magma compared to the temperature at the upper boundary ({{circa}} 1220&amp;nbsp;°C for the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, {{circa}} 1120&amp;nbsp;°C for the eastern Pacific) and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the depth of the ridge below the ocean surface.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"&gt;{{cite journal|last=E.&amp;nbsp;E.|first=Davis|last2=Lister |first2=C.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;B.|title=Fundamentals of Ridge Crest Topography|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|publisher=North-Holland Publishing Company|volume=21|pages=405–413|year=1974|doi=10.1016/0012-821X(74)90180-0|bibcode = 1974E&amp;PSL..21..405D }}&lt;/ref&gt; After plugging in rough numbers for the sea floor, the equation becomes:

:for the eastern Pacific Ocean:
::&lt;math&gt;d(t) = 350 \sqrt{t} + 2500&lt;/math&gt;
::
::and for the Atlantic and Indian Oceans:

::&lt;math&gt;d(t) = 390 \sqrt{t} + 2500&lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'' is in meters and ''t'' is in millions of years, so that just-formed crust at the mid-ocean ridges lies at about 2,500&amp;nbsp;m depth, whereas 50-million-year-old seafloor lies at a depth of about 5,000&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name="analysis"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parsons|first=Barry|last2=Sclater |first2=John G.|title=An analysis of the variation of ocean floor bathymetry and heat flow with age|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|publisher=American Geophysical Union|volume=82|issue=B5|pages=802–827|bibcode=1977JGR....82..802P|year=1977|doi=10.1029/jb082i005p00803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the mean level of the sea floor decreases, the volume of the ocean basins increases, and if other factors that can control sea level remain constant, sea level falls. The converse is also true: younger oceanic lithosphere leads to shallower oceans and higher sea levels if other factors remain constant.

Area ''A'', of the oceans, can change when continents [[rift]] (stretching the continents decreases A and raises sea level) or as a result of [[continental collision]] (compressing the continents leads to an increase ''A'' and lowers sea level). Increasing sea level will flood the continents, while decreasing sea level will expose  continental shelves.

Because the [[continental shelf]] has a very low slope, a small increase in sea level will result in a large change in the percent of continents flooded.

If the world ocean on average is young, the seafloor will be relatively shallow, and sea level will be high: more of the continents are flooded.  If the world ocean is on average old, seafloor will be relatively deep, and sea level will be low: more of the continents will be exposed.

There is thus a relatively simple relationship between the supercontinent cycle and the mean age of the seafloor.
*Supercontinent = lots of old seafloor = low sea level
*Dispersed continents = lots of young seafloor = high sea level

There will also be a climatic effect of the supercontinent cycle that will amplify this further:
*Supercontinent = continental climate dominant = continental glaciation likely = still lower sea level
*Dispersed continents = maritime climate dominant = continental glaciation unlikely = sea level is not lowered by this mechanism

==Relation to global tectonics==
There is a progression of tectonic regimes that accompany the supercontinent cycle:

During break-up of the supercontinent, rifting environments dominate.  This is followed by passive margin environments, while seafloor spreading continues and the oceans grow.  This in turn is followed by the development of collisional environments that become increasingly important with time.  First collisions are between continents and island arcs, but lead ultimately to continent-continent collisions.  This is the situation that was observed during the Paleozoic supercontinent cycle and is being observed for the [[Mesozoic]]–[[Cenozoic]] supercontinent cycle, still in progress.

==Relation to climate==
&lt;!--{{unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}--&gt;{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
{{Main|Greenhouse and icehouse Earth}}
There are two types of global earth climates: icehouse and greenhouse. Icehouse is characterized by frequent continental glaciations and severe desert environments.  Greenhouse is characterized by warm climates. Both reflect the supercontinent cycle.  It is now a short greenhouse phase of an icehouse world.&lt;ref name="Read, PhD"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Record of ancient climates can be a map to riches| first = J. Fred | last = Read | year = 2001 | journal = Science from Virginia Tech| accessdate = 2011-05-04| url = http://www.research.vt.edu/resmag/sciencecol/2001old_weather.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Periods of icehouse climate: much of [[Neoproterozoic]], late [[Paleozoic]], late [[Cenozoic]].

Periods of greenhouse climate: Early [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]]–early [[Cenozoic]].

==Relation to evolution==
The principal mechanism for evolution is natural selection among diverse populations.  As [[genetic drift]] occurs more frequently in small populations, diversity is an observed consequence of isolation. Less isolation, and thus less diversification, occurs when the continents are all together, producing both one continent and one ocean with one coast. In Latest Neoproterozoic to Early Paleozoic times, when the tremendous proliferation of diverse [[Animal|metazoa]] occurred, isolation of marine environments resulted from the breakup of Pannotia.

A north–south arrangement of continents and oceans leads to much more diversity and isolation than east–west arrangements.  North-to-south arrangements give climatically different zones along the communication routes to the north and south, which are separated by water or land from other continental or oceanic zones of similar climate.  Formation of similar tracts of continents and ocean basins oriented east–west would lead to much less isolation, diversification, and slower evolution, since each continent or ocean is in fewer climatic zones.  Through the [[Cenozoic]], isolation has been maximized by a north–south arrangement.

Diversity, as measured by the number of families, follows the supercontinent cycle very well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Benton|first=Michael J.|title=Fossil Record: Quality|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/npg.els.0004144|work=eLS (Encyclopedia of Life Sciences)|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|doi=10.1038/npg.els.0004144|date=23 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Flight of Dragons''''' is a 1979 [[speculative evolution]] book written by [[Peter Dickinson]] and illustrated by Wayne Anderson.

==Thesis==
According to Dickinson's hypothesis, the chief obstacle to admitting the (past) existence of [[dragon]]s is the difficulty of powered flight by so large an organism. To resolve this, he introduces a [[dirigible]]-like structure in which [[hydrochloric acid]] would dissolve large amounts of rapidly growing [[bone]], releasing massive amounts of [[hydrogen]] that, once aloft, would support the body above the ground. The dragon's wings are traced to "modifications of the ribcage" (an anatomical evolutionary path shared by the genus [[Draco (genus)|Draco]]), and the expulsion of fire from the throat, as a means of removal of excess gas. The absence of [[fossil]] evidence is traced again to the internal acids, which (in Dickinson's view) would dissolve the bones soon after death.

Dickinson states he got the idea for his "pseudo-scientific monograph" after looking at one of [[Ursula K. LeGuin]]'s ''[[Earthsea]]'' books: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;This one had a bulky body and rather stubby wings, which obviously would never get it airborne, let alone with the two people it was carrying on its back, and all its own weight of muscle and bone. Obviously any lift had to come from the body itself. Its very shape suggested some kind of gas-bag. I thought about it for the rest of the journey, and on and off for a couple of days after, and at the end of that time had managed to slot everything I knew about dragons – why they laired in caves, around which nothing would grow and where hoards of gold could be found, why they had a preferred diet of princesses, how and why they breathed fire, why they had only one vulnerable spot and their blood melted the blade of the sword that killed them, and so on – into a coherent theory that explained why these things were necessary accompaniments to the evolution of lighter-than-air flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterdickinson.com/books/flightofdragons|website=peterdickinson.com|title=The Flight of Dragons|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Film==
{{main article|The Flight of Dragons}}
In 1982, [[Rankin/Bass Productions]] released a made-for-TV animated film ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]'', aspects of which were based on Dickinson's novel. For example, the character design in the film bears a resemblance to the illustrations in the book, and its lead character takes his name from the author, Peter Dickinson. However, the animated film derives most elements of its story line from the novel ''[[The Dragon and the George]]''.

'''Wadj-wer''' is an [[ancient Egyptian deities|Egyptian god]] [[List of fertility deities|of fertility]] whose name means the "[[swallow (hieroglyph)|Great]] Green".&lt;ref name=Shaw&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shaw|first1=Ian|authorlink1=Ian Shaw (Egyptologist)|last2=Nicholson|first2=Paul|year=1995|title=The British Museum Dictionary of Ancient Egypt|location=|publisher=The American University in Cairo Press|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilkinson&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilkinson|first=Richard H.|authorlink=Richard H. Wilkinson|year=2003|title=The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt|location=New York|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn=978-0-500-05120-7|pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was commonly believed that Wadj-wer was a personification of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]; however, it is apparently more likely that he rather represented the [[lagoon]]s and lakes in the northernmost [[Nile Delta]], as suggested by some texts describing the "great green" as dry lands which could be crossed by foot, possibly a mention of the edge between two or more lakes.&lt;ref name=Shaw/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;

The earliest known attestation of Wadj-wer is dated back to the [[5th Dynasty]], in the mortuary temple of the [[pyramid of Sahure]], at [[Abusir]]; here, he appears similar to the god [[Hapi (Nile god)|Hapi]], but with his body filled by [[N-water ripple (n hieroglyph)|water ripples]]. He also appears on the walls of the much later ([[20th Dynasty]]) tomb [[QV55]] of prince [[Amun-her-khepeshef (20th dynasty)|Amunherkhepeshef]], son of pharaoh [[Ramesses III]].&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;
