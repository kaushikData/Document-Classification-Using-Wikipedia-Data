{{pp-pc1|small=yes}}
In [[biology]] and [[ecology]], '''abiotic components''' or '''abiotic factors''' are non-living chemical and [[Physical property|physical]] parts of the [[Natural environment|environment]] that affect living [[organism]]s and the functioning of [[ecosystem]]s. Abiotic factors and the phenomena associated with them underpin all biology. 

Abiotic components include physical conditions and non-living [[Resource (biology)|resources]] that affect living organisms in terms of [[Developmental biology|growth]], [[Maintenance of an organism|maintenance]], and [[reproduction]].  Resources are distinguished as substances or objects in the environment required by one organism and consumed or otherwise made unavailable for use by other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs, R.E. 2005.

Springer, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Abiotic Factors.tif|thumb|These are different settings on earth that are abiotic factors, which mean they are not living organisms, that contribute to the earth in many different ways.]]
Component degradation of a substance occurs by [[chemical process|chemical]] or [[Physical change|physical process]]es, e.g. [[hydrolysis]].  All non-living components of an ecosystem, such as atmospheric conditions and water resources, are called abiotic components.&lt;ref&gt;Water Quality Vocabulary. ISO 6107-6:1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
In biology, abiotic factors can include water, light, radiation, temperature, [[humidity]], [[atmosphere]], and soil. The macroscopic climate often influences each of the above. Pressure and sound waves may also be considered in the context of marine or sub-terrestrial environments.&lt;ref name=EoEarth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 |title=Abiotic factor |publisher=National Council for Science and the Environment |year=2010 |last=Hogan |first=C.

Consider the differences in the mechanics of [[C3 carbon fixation|C3]], [[C4 carbon fixation|C4]], and [[Crassulacean acid metabolism|CAM]] plants in regulating the influx of [[carbon dioxide]] to the [[Calvin-Benson Cycle]] in relation to their abiotic stressors. C3 plants have no mechanisms to manage [[photorespiration]], whereas C4 and CAM plants utilize a separate [[PEP Carboxylase]] enzyme to prevent photorespiration, thus increasing the yield of photosynthetic processes in certain high energy environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Chuali|last2=Guo|first2=Longyun|last3=Li|first3=Yixue|last4=Wang|first4=Zhuo|title=Systematic Comparison of C3 and C4 Plants Based on Metabolic Network Analysis|journal=BMC Systems Biology|date=2012|volume=6|issue=59|doi=10.1186/1752-0509-6-S2-S9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rubisco and C4 Plants|url=http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/content/filerepository/CMP/00/001/066/Rubisco%20and%20C4%20plants.pdf?v=1353967268963|website=RSC: Advancing the Chemical Sciences|publisher=RSC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Archea]] require very high temperatures, pressures or unusual concentrations of chemical substances such as sulfur; this is due to their specialization into extreme conditions. In addition, fungi have also evolved to survive at the temperature, the humidity, and stability of their environment.&lt;ref name=UWC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botany.uwc.ac.za/sci_ed/grade10/ecology/abiotic/abiot.htm |title=Abiotic Components |publisher=Department of Biodiversity and Conservation Biology, [[University of the Western Cape]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050425160041/http://www.botany.uwc.ac.za/SCI_ED/grade10/ecology/abiotic/abiot.htm |archivedate=2005-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, there is a significant difference in access in both water and humidity between [[temperate rain forest]]s and [[desert]]s. This difference in water availability causes a diversity in the types of plants and animals that survive in these areas. These differences in abiotic components alter the species present both by creating boundaries of what species can survive within the environment, as well as influencing competition between two species. Abiotic factors such as salinity can give one species a competitive advantage over another, creating pressures that lead to speciation and alteration of a species to and from generalist and specialist competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunson|first=William A.|date=November 1991|title=The Role of Abiotic Factors in Community Organization|url=https://www.jstor.org.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/stable/pdf/2462508.pdf|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=138 |issue=5|pages=1067–1091|doi=10.1086/285270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Active Noise Reduction.svg|thumb|300px| Graphical depiction of active noise reduction]]
'''Active noise control''' ('''ANC'''), also known as '''noise cancellation''', or '''active noise reduction''' ('''ANR'''), is a method for reducing unwanted [[sound]] by the addition of a second sound specifically designed to cancel the first.

== Explanation ==
Sound is a [[P-wave|pressure wave]], which consists of alternating periods of [[Compression (physical)|compression]] and [[rarefaction]]. A noise-cancellation speaker emits a sound wave with the same [[amplitude]] but with inverted phase (also known as [[antiphase]]) to the original sound. The waves combine to form a new wave, in a process called [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]], and effectively cancel each other out – an effect which is called [[destructive interference]].

Modern active noise control is generally achieved through the use of analog circuits or [[digital signal processing]]. Adaptive algorithms are designed to analyze the waveform of the background [[Noise (environmental)|aural]] or [[Noise (physics)|nonaural]] noise, then based on the specific algorithm generate a signal that will either phase shift or invert the polarity of the original signal. This inverted signal (in antiphase) is then amplified and a transducer creates a sound wave directly [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the amplitude of the original waveform, creating destructive interference. This effectively reduces the volume of the perceivable noise.

A noise-cancellation speaker may be co-located with the sound source to be [[Attenuation|attenuated]]. In this case it must have the same audio power level as the source of the unwanted sound. Alternatively, the transducer emitting the cancellation signal may be located at the location where sound attenuation is wanted (e.g. the user's ear). This requires a much lower power level for cancellation but is effective only for a single user. Noise cancellation at other locations is more difficult as the three-dimensional wavefronts of the unwanted sound and the cancellation signal could match and create alternating zones of constructive and destructive interference, reducing noise in some spots while doubling noise in others. In small enclosed spaces (e.g. the passenger compartment of a car) global noise reduction can be achieved via multiple speakers and feedback [[microphone]]s, and measurement of the modal responses of the enclosure.

== Applications ==
Applications can be "1-dimensional" or 3-dimensional, depending on the type of zone to protect.  Periodic sounds, even complex ones, are easier to cancel than random sounds due to the repetition in the wave form.

Protection of a "1-dimension zone" is easier and requires only one or two microphones and speakers to be effective. Several commercial applications have been successful: [[noise-cancelling headphones]], active mufflers, and the control of noise in air conditioning ducts. The term "1-dimension" refers to a simple pistonic relationship between the noise and the active speaker (mechanical noise reduction) or between the active speaker and the listener (headphones).

Protection of a 3-dimension zone requires many microphones and speakers, making it more expensive. Noise reduction is more easily achieved with a single listener remaining stationary but if there are multiple listeners or if the single listener turns his head or moves throughout the space then the noise reduction challenge is made much more difficult. High frequency waves are difficult to reduce in three dimensions due to their relatively short audio wavelength in air. The wavelength in air of sinusoidal noise at approximately 800&amp;nbsp;Hz is double the distance of the average person's left ear to the right ear;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgdkVhHUjEMC&amp;pg=PA26 |page=26 |title=Understanding and crafting the mix: the art of recording |last=Moylan |first=William |publisher=Focal Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-240-80755-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; such a noise coming directly from the front will be easily reduced by an active system but coming from the side will tend to cancel at one ear while being reinforced at the other, making the noise louder, not softer.&lt;ref&gt;The average head is about {{convert|21.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} from ear to ear. Assuming the speed of sound is 343 meters per second (1125 feet per second), the full wavelength of a tone of 1600&amp;nbsp;Hz reaches from ear to ear. A tone of half that frequency, 800&amp;nbsp;Hz, has a wavelength twice as long. A single such tone coming from the side will appear at the two ears 180 degrees out of phase—one ear compared to the other. An active noise control tone coming from a different angle will not be able to attenuate the original tone in both ears at once.&lt;/ref&gt; High frequency sounds above 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz tend to cancel and reinforce unpredictably from many directions. In sum, the most effective noise reduction in three-dimensional space involves low frequency sounds. Commercial applications of 3-D noise reduction include the protection of aircraft cabins and car interiors, but in these situations, protection is mainly limited to the cancellation of repetitive (or periodic) noise such as engine-, propeller- or rotor-induced noise. This is because an engine's cyclic nature makes [[fast Fourier transform]] analysis and the noise cancellation easier to apply.

== Active vs. passive noise control ==
''Noise control'' is an active or passive means of reducing sound emissions, often for personal comfort, environmental considerations or legal compliance. ''Active'' noise control is sound reduction using a power source. ''Passive'' noise control is sound reduction by noise-isolating materials such as insulation, sound-absorbing tiles, or a [[muffler]] rather than a power source.

Active noise canceling is best suited for low frequencies. For higher frequencies, the spacing requirements for free space and zone of silence techniques become prohibitive. In acoustic cavity and duct based systems, the number of nodes grows rapidly with increasing frequency, which quickly makes active noise control techniques unmanageable. Passive treatments become more effective at higher frequencies and often provide an adequate solution without the need for active control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| |title=Active Noise Control|website=medialab|date= December 2005| url=http://www.medialab.ch/archiv/pdf_studien_diplomarbeiten/da05/da2005-104_ActiveNoiseControl.pdf| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426050529/http://www.medialab.ch/archiv/pdf_studien_diplomarbeiten/da05/da2005-104_ActiveNoiseControl.pdf| dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
1936 – The first patent for a noise control system was granted to inventor Paul Lueg {{US patent|2043416}}. The patent described how to cancel sinusoidal tones in ducts by phase-advancing the wave and cancelling arbitrary sounds in the region around a loudspeaker by inverting the polarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-04222002-143554/unrestricted/02rudissertation.pdf |title=Evaluation of an Improved Active Noise Reduction Microphone using Speech Intelligibility and Performance-Based Testing, n.d. |access-date=2006-08-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026054112/http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-04222002-143554/unrestricted/02rudissertation.pdf |archive-date=2015-10-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1950s – With {{US patent|2866848}}, {{US patent|2920138}}, {{US patent|2966549}} by [[Lawrence J. Fogel]], systems were created to cancel the noise in helicopter and airplane cockpits.

1957 – Willard Meeker developed a paper design and working model of active noise control applied to a circumaural earmuff. This headset had an active attenuation bandwidth of approximately 50–500&amp;nbsp;Hz, with a maximum attenuation of approximately 20&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-04222002-143554/unrestricted/02rudissertation.pdf |title=Evaluation of an Improved Active Noise Reduction Microphone using Speech Intelligibility and Performance-Based Testing, n.d. |access-date=2006-08-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026054112/http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-04222002-143554/unrestricted/02rudissertation.pdf |archive-date=2015-10-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1986 – [[Dick Rutan]] and [[Jeana Yeager]] used prototype headsets built by [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] in their [[Rutan Voyager|around-the-world flight]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acoustics.org/press/147th/active-noise.htm Special Lay-Language Paper for the 75th Anniversary Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America, May 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509115208/http://www.acoustics.org/press/147th/active-noise.htm |date=May 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bose.co.uk/GB/en/learning-centre/featured-stories/escape-the-noise/ Escape the Noise: Bose Learning Centre] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219205955/http://www.bose.co.uk/GB/en/learning-centre/featured-stories/escape-the-noise/ |date=February 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1992 - The Japanese market [[Nissan Bluebird#U13|Nissan Bluebird]] became the first car in the world to be sold with an ANC system installed. Its effect was limited and it was to be another twenty years before such technology reached wider adoption in automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Active Control of Noise and Vibration, Second Edition | first1 = Colin | last1 = Hansen | first2 = Scott | last2 = Snyder | first3 = Xiaojun | last3 = Qiu | first4 = Laura | last4 = Brooks | first5 = Danielle | last5 = Moreau | publisher = CRC Press | date = 2012 | isbn = 9781482234008 | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics''' ('''ASCA''', formerly named '''ASTRO-D''') was the fourth cosmic X-ray astronomy mission by [[JAXA]], and the second for which the [[United States]] provided part of the scientific payload. The satellite was successfully launched on 20 February 1993. The first eight months of the ASCA mission were devoted to performance verification. Having established the quality of performance of all ASCA's instruments, the spacecraft provided science observations for the remainder of the mission. In this phase the observing program was open to [[astronomer]]s based at Japanese and U.S. institutions, as well as those located in member states of the [[European Space Agency]].&lt;ref name="nasascimis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanaka"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The X-ray astronomy satellite ASCA |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan |first1=Yasuo |last1=Tanaka |first2=Hajime |last2=Inoue |first3=Stephen S. |last3=Holt |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=L37-L41 |date=June 1994 |doi= |bibcode=1994PASJ...46L..37T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==X-ray astronomy mission==

ASCA was the first [[History of X-ray astronomy|X-ray astronomy mission]] to combine imaging capability with a broad [[pass band]], good [[spectral resolution]], and a large effective area. The mission also was the first satellite to use [[Charge-coupled device|CCDs]] for [[X-ray astronomy]]. With these properties, the primary scientific purpose of ASCA is the [[X-ray spectroscopy]] of astrophysical plasmas, especially the analysis of discrete features such as [[emission lines]] and [[absorption spectrum|absorption edges]].

ASCA carried four large-area [[X-ray telescope]]s. At the focus of two of the telescopes is a [[gas imaging spectrometer]] (GIS), while a [[solid-state imaging spectrometer]] (SIS) is at the focus of the other two.&lt;ref name=nasascimis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tanaka/&gt; The GIS is a gas-imaging scintillation proportional counter and is based on the GSPC that flew on the second Japanese X-ray astronomy mission TENMA. The two identical [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) cameras were provided for the two SISs by a hardware team from MIT, Osaka University and ISAS.

==Significant contributions==
The ASCA was launched by ISAS (Institute of Space and Astronautical Sciences), Japan.

The sensitivity of ASCA's instruments allowed for the first detailed, broad-band spectra of distant quasars to be derived. In addition, ASCA's suite of instruments provided the best opportunity at the time for identifying the sources whose combined emission makes up the cosmic X-ray background.&lt;ref name="nasascimis"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/missions/asca |title=ASCA |work=NASA Science Missions |publisher=NASA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007123952/https://science.nasa.gov/missions/asca |archivedate=7 October 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tsusaka"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Characterization of the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics X-ray telescope: Preflight calibration and ray tracing |journal=Applied Optics |first1=Yoshiyuki |last1=Tsusaka |first2=Hisanori |last2=Suzuki |first3=Koujun |last3=Yamashita |first4=Hideyo |last4=Kunieda |first5=Yuzuru |last5=Tawara |first6=Yasushi|last6=Ogasaka|first7=Yasuhiro|last7=Uchibori|first8=Hirohiko|last8=Honda|first9=Masayuki|last9=Itoh|first10=Hisamitsu|last10=Awaki|first11=Hiroshi|last11=Tsunemi|first12=Kiyoshi|last12=Hayashida|first13=Susumu|last13=Nomoto|first14=Mikio|last14=Wada|first15=Emi|last15=Miyata|first16=Peter J.|last16=Serlemitsos|first17=Lalit|last17=Jalota|first18=Yang|last18=Soong|display-authors=5 |volume=34 |issue=22 |pages=4848-4856 |date=August 1995 |doi=10.1364/AO.34.004848 |bibcode=1995ApOpt..34.4848T |pmid=21052325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It performed over 3000 observations, and produced over 1000 publications in refereed journals so far. The ASCA archive contains significant amounts of data for future analyses. Furthermore, the mission is termed highly successful when reflecting on what scientists in many counties have accomplished using ASCA data up to this time.

The U.S. contributed significantly to ASCA's scientific payloads. In return, 40% of ASCA observing time was made available to U.S. scientists. (ISAS also opened up 10% of the time to ESA scientists as a good-will gesture.) In addition, all ASCA data enter the public domain after a suitable period (1 year for U.S. data, 18 months for Japanese data) and become available to scientists worldwide. The design of ASCA was optimized for X-ray spectroscopy; thus it complimented [[ROSAT]] (optimized for X-ray imaging) and [[RXTE]] (optimized for timing studies). Finally, ASCA results cover almost the entire range of objects, from nearby stars to the most distant objects in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/asca/outreach/asca_asca.html |title=ASCA's Significant Contributions to Astrophysics |work=ASCA Guest Observer Facility |publisher=NASA |accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission end==
The mission operated successfully for over 7 years until attitude control was lost on 14 July 2000 during a [[geomagnetic storm]], after which no scientific observations were performed. ASCA reentered the atmosphere on 2 March 2001 after more than 8 years in orbit.

The primary responsibility of the U.S. ASCA GOF was to enable U.S. astronomers to make the best use of the ASCA mission, in close collaboration with the Japanese ASCA team.&lt;ref name="misend"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/asca/ascagof.html |title=The ASCA Mission: (1993-2000) |publisher=NASA |date=20 May 2011 |accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:First usage of the symbol ∈.png|thumb|right|First recorded usage of the symbol ϵ for [[set membership]].]]

The 1889 treatise '''''Arithmetices principia, nova methodo exposita''''' (''The principles of arithmetic, presented by a new method''; 1889) by [[Giuseppe Peano]] is a seminal document in [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]],&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Segre|first=Michael|date=1994-01-01|title=Peano's Axioms in their Historical Context|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Segre/publication/240358753_Peano%27s_axioms_in_their_historical_context/links/54bb8fbe0cf253b50e2d0fa9/Peanos-axioms-in-their-historical-context.pdf|journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences|volume=48|issue=3/4|pages=201–342|doi=10.1007/bf00375085}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=wRWeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT89&amp;lpg=PT89&amp;dq=Arithmetices+principia,+nova+methodo+exposita&amp;ots=T0z8EAS1Pr&amp;sig=87PfhSwT0BxZiVdod5vF_MuMf94&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtzcS61Y_SAhWGPZoKHcDSC2Q4HhDoAQgZMAA&amp;q=Arithmetices%20principia,%20nova%20methodo%20exposita|title=A Brief History of Infinity: The Quest to Think the Unthinkable|last=Clegg|first=Brian|date=2013-02-07|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=9781472107640|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; introducing what is now the standard [[axiomatization]] of the [[natural number]]s, and known as the [[Peano axioms]], as well as some pervasive notations, such as the symbols for the basic set operations [[element (set theory)|∈]], [[subset|⊂]], [[intersection (set theory)|∩]], [[union (set theory)|∪]], and [[set theoretic difference|''A''&amp;minus;''B'']].

The treatise is written in [[Latin]], which was already somewhat unusual at the time of publication, Latin having fallen out of favour as the [[lingua franca]] of scholarly communications by the end of the 19th century. The use of Latin in spite of this reflected Peano's belief in the universal importance of the work – which is now generally regarded as his most important contribution to arithmetic – and in that of universal communication. Peano would publish later works both in Latin and in his own artificial language, [[Latino sine flexione]], which is a grammatically simplified version of Latin.

Peano also continued to publish [[mathematical notation]]s in a series from 1895 to 1908 collectively known as [[Formulario mathematico]].

'''Artificial philosophy''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] branch conceived by author Louis Molnar&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267156955_A_Step_Beyond_AI_Artificial_Philosophy "article: Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications", ResearchGate, (retrieved November 25, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; to consider what a being bestowed with [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) might consider about its own [[existence]] once it reaches a higher state of [[consciousness]]. The author reasons in his dissertation that at some point, either through [[Computer_programming|programming]] or organic [[self-development]], [[robot]]s will not see themselves as extensions of those that created them, and that their saying "Who am I?" will not lead them to think of themselves as one with [[human]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1813">'''Associate Teacher Learning and Skills''' (ATLS) status is a designation awarded to teachers in the [[Further Education]] and Post-Compulsory Education &amp; Training sectors by the Education &amp; Training Foundation (ETF) in the [[United Kingdom]]. ATLS may be earned en route to [[Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills]] (QTLS) status, which is seen as on an equal level to [[Qualified Teacher Status]] (QTS).

ATLS is a professional 'status'.

==Gaining ATLS==

From November 2014, ATLS has been offered by the Education &amp; Training Foundation (ETF) to members of the Society for Education &amp; Training (SET) for a fee of £485. In order to obtain ATLS, the candidate is required to register with SET, undertake Continuing Professional Development (CPD) and complete SET's 'Professional Formation' process.

Prior to November 2014, ATLS was offered by the [[Institute for Learning]] (IfL) which was absorbed into the Education &amp; Training Foundation (ETF) on 31 October 2014.

ATLS can be obtained en route to [[Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills|QTLS]] which is seen as on an equal level to [[Qualified Teacher Status|QTS]].  Should an individual want to work as an Associate Teacher in maintained schools, the same way as any other teacher, then they must have ATLS and be a member of the Society for Education &amp; Training (SET).

The [[Certificate in Education and Training]] qualification and its predecessors (e.g. [[CTLLS]]) qualify a teacher to attain ATLS.

An '''augmented marked graph''' is basically a [[Petri net]] with a specific set of places called resource places. If removing these resource places and their associated arcs, it will become a marked graph where every cycle is marked. For each resource place, there are pairs of outgoing and incoming transitions connected by elementary paths.

== Application ==

Augmented marked graphs are often used for modelling systems with shared resources, such as manufacturing systems. Based on the special properties of augmented marked graphs, the properties of the modelled systems, such as liveness, boundedness and reversibility, can be effectively analyzed.

An '''avoidance response''' is a response that prevents an aversive [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] from occurring. It is a kind of [[negative reinforcement]]. An avoidance response is a behavior based on the concept that animals will avoid performing behaviors that result in an aversive outcome. This can involve learning through operant conditioning when it is used as a training technique. It is a reaction to undesirable sensations or feedback that leads to avoiding the behavior that is followed by this unpleasant or fear-inducing stimulus. 

Whether the aversive stimulus is brought on intentionally by another or is naturally occurring, it is adaptive to learn to avoid situations that have previously yielded negative outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernstein|first=I.L.|title=Taste aversion learning: A contemporary perspective|journal=Nutrition|year=1999|volume=15|issue=3|pages=229–234|doi=10.1016/S0899-9007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simple example of this is food aversions, or the aversion developed to food that has previously resulted in sickness. Food aversions can also be conditioned using [[classical conditioning]], so that an animal learns to avoid a stimulus previously neutral that has been associated with a negative outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garcia|first=J|title=Relation of cue to consequence in avoidance learning. Foundations of animal behavior: Classic papers with commentaries|year=1996|pages=374–375}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is displayed nearly universally in animals since it is a defense against potential poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garcia|first=John|author2=Frank R.

== Experiments ==
An experiment conducted by Solomon and Wynne&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Wynne|first=Solomon|title=TRAUMATIC AVOIDANCE LEARNING: THE OUTCOMES OF SEVERAL EXTINCTION PROCEDURES WITH DOGS|year=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1953 shows the properties of [[negative reinforcement]]. The subjects, dogs, were put in a shuttle box (a chamber containing two rectangular compartments divided by a barrier a few inches high). The dogs had the ability to move freely between compartments by going over the barrier. Both compartments had a metal floor designed to administer an unpleasant electric shock. Each compartment also had a light above each, which would turn on and off. Every few minutes, the light in the room the dog was occupying was turned off, while the other remained on. If after 10 seconds in the dark, the dog did not move to the lit compartment, a shock was delivered to the floor of the room the dog was in. The shock continued until the dog moved into the other compartment. In doing this, the dog was escaping the shock by jumping the barrier into the next room. The dog could avoid the shock completely though by jumping the barrier before the 10 seconds of darkness led to a shock. Each trial worked this way with avoiding the shock as the response. In the first few trials, the dog did not move until the shocks began and then it jumped over the barrier. However, after several trials, the dog began to make avoidance responses and would jump over the barrier when the light turned off, and would not receive the shock. Many dogs never received the shock after the first trial. These results led to questioning in the term avoidance paradox (the question of how the nonoccurrence of an aversive event can be a reinforcer for an avoidance response?)

Because the avoidance response is adaptive, humans have learned to use it in training animals such as dogs and horses. [[B.F. Skinner]] (1938)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skinner|first=B.F.|title=The behavior of Organisms: An Experimental Analysis|year=1938|publisher=Appleton-Century|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; believed that animals learn primarily through rewards and punishments, the basis of [[operant conditioning]]. The avoidance response comes into play here when punishment is administered. An animal will presumably learn to avoid the behavior that preceded this punishment. A naturally occurring example for humans would be that after a child has been burned by a red stove, he or she learns not to touch the stove when it is red. The child avoids that behavior in the future. For a non-human animal, an example would be that of invisible fences which prompt a dog to learn not to cross a certain (invisible) boundary because its collar shocks it when it does.

== Disorders ==
Although the avoidance response is often advantageous and has developed because it is adaptive, it can sometimes be harmful or become obsessive. Such is the case with [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], a disorder involving mental obsessions followed by actions performed often repetitively, to relieve the anxiety of the obsessions, [[panic disorder]], and other psychiatric disorders. In panic disorder, a person learns to avoid certain situations such as being in crowded places because when they enter these situations, a [[panic attack]] (aversive stimulus) ensues. People with obsessive compulsive disorder may learn to avoid using public restrooms because it produces anxiety in them (aversive stimulus). 

== Neuropharmacology ==
The posterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary are necessary for maintenance of the avoidance response once learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wled|first=D.D.|title=The influence of the posterior and inter-mediate lobe of the pituitary and pituitary peptides on the maintenance of a conditioned avoidance response in rats|journal=International Journal of Neuropharmacology|year=1965|volume=4|issue=3|pages=157–167|doi=10.1016/0028-3908(65)90005-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When these areas of the brain are lesioned or removed, animals display difficulty in maintaining a conditioned avoidance response. 
The avoidance response can be extinguished using a procedure called "[[flooding (psychology)|flooding]]" or response prevention. This is a method in which the subject is forced to remain in the fearsome or aversive situation and not allowed the opportunity to avoid it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baum|first=M|title=Extinction of avoidance responding through response prevention (flooding)|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1970|volume=74|issue=4|pages=276–284|doi=10.1037/h0029789|pmid=5479591}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes used in treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder. [[Systematic desensitization]] can also be used to extinguish avoidance response behaviors. 
See for example studies involving avoidance response.&lt;ref&gt;Gannon, Steven. Roche, Bryan. Kanter, Jonathan. Forsyth, John. Linehan, Conor.

The '''Bedford Institute of Oceanography''' ('''BIO''') is a major [[Government of Canada]] [[Oceanography|ocean research]] facility located in [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia|Dartmouth]], [[Nova Scotia]].  BIO is the largest ocean research station in Canada. Established in 1962 as Canada's first, and currently largest, federal centre for [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] research, BIO derives its name from the [[Bedford Basin]], an inland bay comprising the northern part of Halifax Harbour, upon which it is located.

Spread out over 40 [[acre]]s (160,000 m²) of a former [[Royal Canadian Navy]] (RCN) property near [[Shannon Park, Nova Scotia|Shannon Park]] in [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia|Dartmouth]], BIO consists of a series of interconnected buildings housing research labs and offices, as well as docks for [[Canadian Coast Guard]] and RCN research vessels.

As the federal government seeks to concentrate its operations in the [[Halifax Regional Municipality]], BIO is being considered for additional office buildings to house other non-oceanographic and non-research organizations and their employees. As such, new buildings have been built for the [[Canadian Coast Guard]] as well as [[Environment Canada]] in recent years.

==History==
[[File:CCGS Hudson2.gif|thumbnail|The research vessel CCGS ''Hudson'']]
Following World War II, the principal marine research facility of the Government of Canada was the [[St. Andrews Biological Station]]. Dr. W.E. van Steenburgh, Director-General of Scientific Services of the Department of Mines and Technical Surveys, championed the establishment of a modern oceanographic institute on [[Bedford Basin]]. The Bedford Institute of Oceanography and its research vessel, the [[CCGS Hudson|CCGS ''Hudson'']], were both inaugurated in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Brief History of BIO |url=http://www.bio.gc.ca/general-generales/history-historique-en.php |publisher=Bedford Institute of Oceanography |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201071807/http://www.bio.gc.ca/general-generales/history-historique-en.php |archivedate=1 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current operations==
BIO houses several organizations from various federal departments which perform targeted [[research]] mandated by government or in partnership, advise on [[ocean|marine]] environments, provide [[navigation]]al [[chart]]s covering [[Georges Bank]] to the [[Canadian Arctic]], and respond to environmental emergencies.

A team led by Dr. John Smith at BIO published the first paper on the spread of radioactivity across the Pacific Ocean following the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]]. The scientists gathered samples of water as far as {{convert|1500|km|miles}} off the coast of British Columbia to ascertain how long it took traces of cesium 137 and cesium 134 to reach the west coast of North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jes|first1=Burns|title=Fukushima radiation mapping in the Pacific could bolster climate science|url=http://www.opb.org/news/article/fukushima-radiation-mapping-in-the-pacific-could-b/|publisher=Oregon Public Broadcasting|date=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Netburn|first1=Deborah|title=Tracking the Fukushima radioactivity plume across the Pacific|url=http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-fukushima-radiation-plume-20141229-story.html|work=Los Angeles Times|date=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amos|first1=Jonathan|title=North American scientists track incoming Fukushima plume|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-26329323|work=BBC News|date=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Algar|first1=Jim|title=How Quickly Did Fukushima Radiation Reach North America, And When Will It Peak?|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/24309/20150102/how-quickly-did-fukushima-radiation-reach-north-america-and-when-will-it-peak.htm|work=Tech Times|date=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the institute received $3.5 million in federal funding for facilities upgrades. Much of the funding will be used to upgrade the fish lab, to upgrade the facilities of the Geological Survey of Canada, and for general building repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bradshaw|first1=Ray|title=Bedford Institute of Oceanography gets $3.5 million to fund upgrades|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1912114/bedford-institute-of-oceanography-gets-3-5-million-to-fund-upgrades/|work=Global News|date=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
In addition to office and research space, BIO has extensive laboratories, particularly for performing research into aquatic species.  Tours of BIO are offered for visitors during the summer months and a popular tour destination are some of the large aquariums and tanks used for research.  There are also "touch tanks" in a facility called the Sea Pavilion where visitors are permitted to handle North Atlantic Lobster, Snow Crabs, Rock Crabs, [[Clams]] (also known as Pea Clams), Sea Urchins, Sea Cucumbers, and other species.    Some tanks are transparent and allow visitors to view giant [[mackerel]] and [[sturgeon]] as well as other rare and interesting specimens such as a lobster that is half male and half female.   The Sea Pavilion contains information concerning [[Leatherback Sea Turtle]]s, [[Atlantic Whitefish]], [[Northern Right Whale]]s, [[sharks]], [[Lake Whitefish]], [[Largemouth Bass]], [[Brook Trout]], Atlantic Wolffish, and Atlantic Pickerel.   There are also displays featuring protected areas such as [[Sable Island]] and [[The Gully (Atlantic)|The Gully]] and special interest areas such as [[Halifax Harbour]] and the [[Bay of Fundy]].

The '''Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute''' is a [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] research, training, education facility that is affiliated with the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]] and the [[International Psychoanalytic Association]]. There were no psychoanalytic societies devoted to [[Sigmund Freud]] in Boston prior to his visit to [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] in 1909, though after 1909 there were individuals interested in Freud's writings, including [[James Jackson Putnam]], [[L. Eugene Emerson]], [[Isador Coriat]], [[William Healy (physician)|William Healy]], and [[Augusta Bronner]]. The present society and institute (abbreviated BPSI) was founded by psychoanalyst [[Franz Alexander]] only after 1931.  The BPSI is the third oldest psychoanalytic institute in the United States; only the [[New York Psychoanalytic Institute]] and [[Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis]] are older.  

Major psychoanalysts who have been associated with the institute include [[Franz Alexander]], [[Hans Sachs]], [[Helene Deutsch]], [[Felix Deutsch]], Hans and [[Greta Bibring]], [[Ives Hendrix]], and more recently [[Philip Holzman]] and [[Arnold Modell]].  In its early years, the Department of Psychiatry at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] was strongly associated with BPSI, especially through its first chief [[Stanley Cobb]].

'''Cennino &lt;!--NOTE--&gt;d&lt;!--The "d" remains lower-case except when at the start of a sentence ie. "D'Andrea is daring."--&gt;'Andrea Cennini''' (c. 1360 &amp;ndash; before 1427) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Painting|painter]] influenced by [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]]. He was a student of [[Agnolo Gaddi]] in [[Florence]]. Gaddi trained under his father, called Taddeo Gaddi, who trained with Giotto. 

Cennini was born in [[Colle di Val d'Elsa]], [[Tuscany]]. After training as an artist with Agnolo Gaddi in Florence he worked at the court of [[Francesco Novello da Carrara]] in Padua for some years before apparently returning to Colle di Val d'Elsa.

He is remembered mainly for having authored '''''Il libro dell'arte'''''. Thought to have been written around the turn of the 15th century, the book is a "how to" on late Medieval and early Renaissance painting. It contains information on [[pigment]]s, [[brush]]es, drawing, [[panel painting]], the art of [[fresco]], painting on fabrics and casting, amongst other techniques and tricks. Cennini also mentions oil painting in passing, which was important for dispelling the myth, propagated by [[Giorgio Vasari]] and [[Karel Van Mander]], that [[oil painting]] was invented by [[Jan van Eyck]] (although [[Theophilus Presbyter|Theophilus]] (Roger of Helmerhausen) clearly gives instructions for oil-based painting in his treatise, On Divers Arts, written in 1125).

The dates of Cennini's life are highly speculative. It is often falsely assumed that he was alive in 1437 because that date appears on the earliest of the four extant copies of his manuscript. However, an administrative document from Colle di Val d'Elsa dated 1427 probably refers to his son; if this is the case then the document makes it clear that Cennini was dead by this time. The techniques Cennini describes range from ones which were already in use in the 13th century to ones which were innovative in the late fourteenth century. However, there is no evidence in his writing of the exciting developments in oil painting taking place in the early 15th century, suggesting that his book was written not long after the turn of the century.

The extent to which Cennini intended to provide a practical handbook for the apprentice painter is disputed. Some scholars believe that his book was a presentation book or a guild book instead. Along with technical methods, Cennini offered advice on the sort of lifestyle to which a young painter should subscribe. "Your life should be arranged just as if you were studying [[theology]], or [[philosophy]], or other theories, that is to say, eating and drinking moderately, at least twice a day, electing digestible and wholesome dishes, and light wines; saving and sparing your hand, preserving it from such strains as heaving stones, crowbars, and many other things which are bad for your hand, from giving them a chance to weary it. There is another cause which, if you indulge it, can make your hand so unsteady that it will waver more, and flutter far more, than leaves do in the wind, and this is indulging too much in the company of women."

According to [[Victoria Finlay]], in her book ''Colour: Travels Through The Paintbox, the infamous UK forger'', [[Eric Hebborn]] was greatly influenced by Cennino Cennini. The last book Hebborn wrote before he was brutally murdered was ''The Art Forger's Handbook''. Finlay writes that he "used and adapted Cennino's advice extensively - preparing panels, tinting papers different colours, and making brand new works look as if they had been varnished some time before (by beating egg-white, left overnight and then applying it with a brush), just as the master advised."

The two paintings pictured above were added to the corpus at a later date.

[[Image:Cebhomes.jpg|thumb|Building a CEB project in Midland, Texas in August 2006]]
A '''compressed earth block''' ('''CEB'''), also known as a ''pressed earth block'' or a ''compressed soil block'', is a [[building material]] made primarily from damp [[soil]] compressed at high pressure to form blocks. Compressed earth blocks use a mechanical press to form blocks out of an appropriate mix of fairly dry inorganic [[subsoil]], non-expansive [[clay]] and [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]]. If the blocks are stabilized with a chemical binder such as [[Portland cement]] they are called ''compressed stabilized earth block'' (CSEB) or ''stabilized earth block'' (SEB). Typically, around {{convert|3000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} is applied in compression, and the original soil volume is reduced by about half.

Creating CEBs differs from [[rammed earth]] in that the latter uses a larger formwork into which earth is poured and manually tamped down, creating larger forms such as a whole wall or more at one time rather than building blocks. CEBs differ from [[mud brick]]s in that the latter are not compressed and solidify through chemical changes that take place as they air dry. The compression strength of properly made CEB can meet or exceed that of typical cement or mud brick. Building standards have been developed for CEB.

CEBs are assembled onto walls using standard [[bricklaying]] and [[masonry]] techniques. The [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] may be a simple [[slurry]] made of the same soil/clay mix without aggregate, spread or brushed very thinly between the blocks for bonding, or cement mortar may also be used for high strength, or when construction during freeze-thaw cycles causes stability issues. [[Hydraform block]]s are shaped to be interlocking.

==Development==
CEB technology has been developed  for low-cost construction, as an alternative to adobe, and with some advantages.  A commercial industry has been advanced by eco-friendly contractors, manufacturers of the mechanical presses, and by cultural acceptance of the method.  In the [[United States]], most general contractors building with CEB are in the Southwestern states: [[New Mexico]], [[Colorado]], [[Arizona]], [[California]], and to a lesser extent in [[Texas]].  The methods and presses have been used for many years in [[Mexico]], and in [[developing countries]].

The [[South Africa]]n Department of Water Affairs and Forestry considers that CEB, locally called "'''Dutch brick'''" is an appropriate technology for a developing country, as are adobe, rammed earth and cob. All use natural building materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|page=6|url=http://www.dwaf.gov.za/Masibambane/documents/civil/CrossCuttingFeb08.pdf|accessdate=2014-04-14|title=Critical Sustainability Pillars for service delivery in the Water Sector|publisher=Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, South Africa|date=February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2002 the International Institute for Energy Conservation was one of the winners of a [[World Bank Development Marketplace Award]] for a project to make an energy-efficient Dutch brick-making machine for home construction in South Africa. By making cheaper bricks that use earth, the project would reduce housing costs while stimulating the building industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/29725/south-africa-poverty-reduction-winners|accessdate=2014-04-14|title=SOUTH AFRICA: Poverty reduction winners|publisher=IRIN|date=11 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The machine would be mobile, allowing bricks to be made locally from earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbdm/idea/housing-and-jobs-better-future|accessdate=2014-04-14|title=Housing and Jobs for a Better Future|publisher=[[World Bank]]|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various types of CEB production machines exist, from manual to semi-automated and fully automated,  with increasing capital-investment and production rates, and decreased labor.  Automated machines are more common in the developed world, and manual machines in the developing world.

==Advantages==
There are many advantages of the CEB system.   On-site materials can be used, which reduces cost, minimizes shipping costs for materials, and increases efficiency and sustainability.  The wait-time required to obtain materials is minimal, because after the blocks are pressed, materials are available very soon after a short drying period.  The uniformity of the blocks simplifies construction, and minimizes or eliminates the need for mortar, thus reducing both the labor and materials costs.  The blocks are strong, stable, water-resistant and long-lasting.
* CEB can be pressed from damp earth. Because it is not wet, the drying time is much shorter. Some soil conditions permit the blocks to go straight from the press onto the wall. A single mechanical press can produce from 800 to over 5,000 blocks per day, enough to build a {{convert|1200|sqft|m2}} house in one day.   A high performance CEB press, of [[open source]] design, named "The Liberator", can produce from 8,000 to 17,000 or more blocks per day.  The production rate is limited more by the ability to get material into the machine, than the machine itself.
* Shipping cost: Suitable soils are often available at or near the construction site. [[Adobe]] and CEB are of similar weight, but distance from a source supply gives CEB an advantage.  Also, CEB can be made available in places where adobe manufacturing operations are non-existent.
* Uniformity: CEB can be manufactured to a predictable size and has true flat sides and 90-degree angle edges.  This makes design and costing easier.  This also provides the contractor the option of making the exteriors look like conventional [[stucco]] houses. 
* Presses allow blocks to be consistently made of uniform size, while also obtaining strengths that exceed the ASTM standard for concrete blocks (1900 psi).
* Non-toxic:  materials are completely natural, non-toxic, and do not out-gas
* Sound resistant:  an important feature in high-density neighborhoods, residential areas adjacent to industrial zones
* Fire resistant:  earthen walls do not burn
* Insect resistant: Insects are discouraged because the walls are solid and very dense, and have no food value
* [[Mold]] resistant:  there is no cellulose material - such as in wood, [[Oriented Strand Board]] or [[drywall]] - that can host [[mold]] or rot
* In India, CSEB's with cement stabilization have shown to be very beneficial. The observed compressive strength, flexural strength at 28 days of aging with 9% cement stabilization has been observed to be 3.2 MPa and 1 MPa respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267637559|accessdate=2014-11-11|title=Effect Of Varying Cement Proportions On Properties Of Compressed Stabilized Earth Blocks (CSEB) - A Sustainable Low-Cost Housing Material|publisher=DOI: 10.13140/2.1.4966.4963 Conference: International Conference on Sustainable Civil Infrastructure, ASCE India Section 17–18 October 2014, At Hyderabad, India, Volume: pg 1000-1010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presses==
CEB had very limited use prior to the 1980s. It was known in the 1950s in [[South America]], where one of the most well-known presses, the [[Cinva Ram]], was developed by Raul Ramirez in the Inter-American Housing Center (CINVA) in Bogota, Colombia.  The Cinva Ram is a single-block, manual-press that uses a long, hand-operated lever to drive a [[cam]], generating high pressure.

Industrial manufacturers produce much larger machines that run with diesel or gasoline engines and hydraulic presses that receive the soil/aggregate mixture through a hopper. This is fed into a chamber to create a block that is then ejected onto a conveyor.

During the 1980s, soil-pressing technology became widespread. [[France]], [[England]], [[Germany]], [[South Africa]] and [[Switzerland]] began to write standards. The [[Peace Corps]], [[USAID]], [[Habitat for Humanity]] and other programs began to implement it into housing projects.

==Finishing==
Completed walls require either a reinforced bond beam or a ring beam on top or between floors and if the blocks are not stabilized, a plaster finish, usually stucco wire/stucco cement and/or lime plaster. Stabilized blocks can be left exposed with no outer plaster finish. In tropical environments, polycarbonate varnish is often used to provide an additional layer of wet-weather protection.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Foundations==
Standards for foundations are similar to those for brick walls. A CEB wall is heavy. Footings must be at least 10&amp;nbsp;inches thick, with a minimum width that is 33 percent greater than the wall width. If a stem wall is used, it shall extend to an elevation not less than eight inches (203&amp;nbsp;mm)  above the exterior finish grade. Rubble-filled foundation trench designs with a reinforced concrete grade beam above are allowed to support CEB construction.

==Strength==
Using the [[ASTM]] D1633-00 stabilization standard, a pressed and cured block must be submerged in water for four hours. It is then pulled from the water and immediately subjected to a compression test. The blocks must score at least a 300 [[pound-force per square inch]] (p.s.i) (2 MPa) minimum.  This is a higher standard than for adobe, which must score an ''average'' of at least 300 p.s.i. (2 MPa)

Established in 1988, the '''Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes''' serves as a site for the discussion of issues germane to the fostering of [[Crossdisciplinarity|crossdisciplinary activity]] and as a network for the circulation of information and the sharing of resources within the [[humanities]] and [[Interpretive sociology|interpretive social sciences]]. CHCI has a membership of over 200 centers and institutes that are remarkably diverse in size and scope and are located in the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Finland]], [[Taiwan]], [[Ireland]], [[United Kingdom]], and other countries.

==Mission and History==
Established in 1988, the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes (CHCI) serves as an arena for the discussion of issues germane to crossdisciplinary activity in the humanities and as a network for the circulation of information and [[best practice]]s related to the organizational and management dimensions of humanities centers and institutes. CHCI produces a major Annual Meeting of its membership, maintains a content-rich [[website]], produces an annual print directory, and serves as a re-circulator for information about its members via [[LISTSERV|listservs]] and its website. Members of the Consortium also assist one another with ideas, evaluation, and other forms of service. The organization is headed by a President, and is governed by an International Advisory Board of member directors and other leaders in the humanities.

CHCI was established in 1988 as the product of two meetings: ''The Institutional Impact of Institutes'' at the [[University of California Humanities Research Institute]] (UCHRI, now based at the [[University of California, Irvine]]), convened by [[Murray Krieger]], and an organizational meeting at the 1988 meeting of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] (ACLS), convened by E. Ann Kaplan of the Humanities Institute at [[Stony Brook University]]. These gatherings were the first moments at which directors of humanities research organizations had come together to discuss issues of mutual concern, and the major product of the meetings was a unanimous sense that it was essential to establish a [[consortium]] to continue these dialogues. Ralph Cohen of the [[University of Virginia]] served from 1988-1995 as the organization's first Chair, while CHCI administration was based at UCHRI. In its early years, the CHCI membership included over 70 members from the US and four other countries.

In 1995 CHCI operations and leadership moved to the Center for 21st Century Studies at the [[University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;Milwaukee]], at that time directed by Kathleen Woodward, currently Director of [[The Walter Chapin Simpson Center for the Humanities]] at the [[University of Washington]]. During CHCI's term at UW-Milwaukee, the membership grew to over 125 organizations as new centers were opened and existing members began to expand their programs and operations. This period of time also saw the dramatic expansion of CHCI's Annual Meetings, the development of the organization's first [[website]], and two major [[Grant (money)|grants]] from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] for [[organizational development]] and network-building.

In 2001 CHCI moved to the auspices of the Humanities Center at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], where Director [[Marjorie Garber]] served a six-year term as President of CHCI. During Professor Garber's term, membership continued to grow, and CHCI's annual meetings grew markedly in terms of depth, scale and impact.

In 2007, CHCI operations moved to the [[John Hope Franklin Humanities Institute]] at [[Duke University]], under the leadership of ex-CHCI President [[Srinivas Aravamudan]]. At Duke, CHCI began developing new programs for membership, such as a partnership with the American Council of Learned Societies.

In 2016, CHCI moved from Duke University to the Center for the Humanities at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin-Madison]], where Professor Sara Guyer took over as president. In December of the same year, [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation|The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]] announced their decision to fund two new CHCI initiatives: [https://chcinetwork.org/programs/global-humanities-institutes The CHCI Global Humanities Institutes] and [https://chcinetwork.org/programs/africa-humanities-workshops The CHCI Africa Initiative].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chcinetwork.org/news/mellon-foundation-fund-two-new-chci-initiatives|title=Mellon Foundation to Fund Two New CHCI Initiatives {{!}} Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes|website=chcinetwork.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 5, 2018 it was announced that CHCI would serve as a host organization for the [[American Council of Learned Societies|American Council of Learned Societies's]] Public Fellows program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chcinetwork.org/news/chci-selected-as-host-organization-for-american-council-of-learned-societys-public-fellows-program|title=CHCI Selected as Host Organization for American Council of Learned Society's Public Fellows Program {{!}} Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes|website=chcinetwork.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CHCI is an [[affiliated institution|affiliate]] member of the American Council of Learned Societies. The organization has put out statements affirming its support of federal funding for the humanities in general and for the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chcinetwork.org/news/take-action-statement-on-proposed-arts-and-humanities-cuts-in-the-us|title=Take Action: Statement on Proposed Arts and Humanities Cuts in the US {{!}} Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes|website=chcinetwork.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual Meetings==
CHCI's Annual Meetings provide an opportunity for member directors and administrators to engage in stimulating intellectual dialogues about broadly defined, current issues in the humanities. Each Annual Meeting includes useful and lively workshops focused on [[management]] issues, programming ideas and structures, [[fundraising]], facilities, [[Human resources|staffing]], and other operational challenges facing member directors and their staffs. Perhaps most importantly, each CHCI Annual Meeting provides invaluable opportunities to meet, network, and collaborate with peers and counterparts at humanities centers and institutes from around the world. Each CHCI Annual Meeting is each constructed around a broadly defined intellectual theme, and is hosted by a member center or institute. Upcoming and recent Annual Meetings include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2699">The '''Contemporary Physics Education Project''' (CPEP) is an "organization of teachers, educators, and physicists"&lt;ref name="website"&gt;http://www.cpepPhysics.org&lt;/ref&gt; formed in 1987. The group grew out of the [[Academic conference|Conference]] on the Teaching of Modern [[Physics]] held at [[Fermilab]] in 1986, organized by the [[American Association of Physics Teachers]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Aubrecht, ed., ''Quarks, Quasars, and Quandaries: Proceedings of the Conference on the Teaching of Modern Physics'' (College Park, MD: American Association of Physics Teachers, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; The group's first effort aimed to supply a chart for [[particle physics]] teaching that would rival the [[Periodic Table]] of the [[Chemical element|elements]]. The first version of this chart was published in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamental Particles and Interactions — A Wall Chart of Modern Physics'', Fundamental Particle and Interaction Chart Committee (W. Achor et al.), Phys. Teach. 26, 556 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

CPEP has created four charts emphasizing contemporary aspects of physics research: [[Elementary particle|particles]] and interactions; [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] and [[plasma physics]]; [[nuclear science]]; and [[cosmology]]. Almost half a million of these charts and similar products have been distributed.

The group has created website support for teaching for each of the charts.&lt;ref name="website"/&gt;

CPEP received the 2017 "Excellence in Physics Education Award" from the American Physical Society, "for leadership in providing educational materials on contemporary physics topics to students for over 25 years."&lt;ref name="website"/&gt;

Offshoots of CPEP include the book, "The Charm of Strange Quarks: Mysteries and Revolutions of Particle Physics" (2000), by R. Michael Barnett, Henry Muehry, and [[Helen R. Quinn]], three of the founders of CPEP. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barnett |first1=R.

R. Michael Barnett described the formation and early days of CPEP in a Nobel Symposium Lecture in 2002. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_organizations/nobelfoundation/symposia/interdisciplinary/ns120/lectures/barnett.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cycling probe technology''' (CPT) is a [[molecular biology|molecular biological]] technique for detecting specific [[DNA]] sequences. CPT operates under [[isothermal]] conditions.  In some applications, CPT offers an alternative to [[PCR]]. However, unlike PCR, CPT does not generate multiple copies of the target DNA itself, and the amplification of the signal is linear, in contrast to the exponential amplification of the target DNA in PCR. CPT uses a sequence specific chimeric probe which hybridizes to a complementary target DNA sequence and becomes a substrate for [[RNase H]]. Cleavage occurs at the RNA internucleotide linkages and results in dissociation of the probe from the target, thereby making it available for the next probe molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhatt R, Scott B, Whitney S, Bryan RN, Cloney L, Lebedev A | title = Detection of nucleic acids by cycling probe technology on magnetic particles: high sensitivity and ease of separation | journal = Nucleosides &amp; Nucleotides | volume = 18 | issue = 6-7 | pages = 1297–9 | date = 1999 | pmid = 10474219 | doi = 10.1080/07328319908044696 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[microfluidic chip|Integrated electrokinetic systems]] have been developed for use in CPT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tang T, Badal MY, Ocvirk G, Lee WE, Bader DE, Bekkaoui F, Harrison DJ | title = Integrated microfluidic electrophoresis system for analysis of genetic materials using signal amplification methods | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 74 | issue = 4 | pages = 725–33 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11866051 | doi = 10.1021/ac010874j }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Probe ==
Cycling probe technology makes use of a chimeric [[Hybridization probe|nucleic acid probe]] to detect the presence of a particular [[DNA]] sequence. The chimeric probe consists of an [[RNA]] segment sandwiched between two DNA segments. The RNA segment contains 4 contiguous [[purine]] nucleotides. The probes should be less than 30 nucleotides in length and designed to minimize intra-probe and inter-probe interactions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beggs ML, Cave MD, Marlowe C, Cloney L, Duck P, Eisenach KD | title = Characterization of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex direct repeat sequence for use in cycling probe reaction | journal = Journal of Clinical Microbiology | volume = 34 | issue = 12 | pages = 2985–9 | date = December 1996 | pmid = 8940435 | pmc = 229446 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
Cycling probe technology utilizes a cyclic, isothermal process that begins with the [[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridization]] of the chimeric probe with the target DNA. Once hybridized, the probe becomes a suitable substrate for [[Ribonuclease H|RNase H]]. RNase H, an [[endonuclease]], cleaves the RNA portion of the probe, resulting in two chimeric fragments. The [[Nucleic acid thermodynamics|melting temperature]] (T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) of the newly cleaved fragments is lower than the melting temperature of original probe. Because the CPT reaction is isothermally kept just above the melting point of the original probe, the cleaved fragments dissociate from the target DNA. Once dissociated, the target DNA is free to hybridize with a new probe, beginning the cycle again.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fong WK, Modrusan Z, McNevin JP, Marostenmaki J, Zin B, Bekkaoui F | title = Rapid solid-phase immunoassay for detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus using cycling probe technology | journal = Journal of Clinical Microbiology | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 2525–9 | date = July 2000 | pmid = 10878037 | pmc = 86959 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fragments have been cleaved and dissociated, they become detectable. A common strategy for detecting the fragments involves [[Fluorescence in the life sciences|fluorescence]]. With this method, a fluorescent marker is attached to the 5’ end of the probe and a [[Quenching (fluorescence)|quencher]] is attached to the 3’ end of the probe.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buh Gasparic M, Cankar K, Zel J, Gruden K | title = Comparison of different real-time PCR chemistries and their suitability for detection and quantification of genetically modified organisms | journal = BMC Biotechnology | volume = 8 | pages = 26 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18325084 | pmc = 2322970 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6750-8-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When RNase H cleaves the probe, the quencher and fluorescent marker separate, increasing the intensity of the fluorescent marker. Cleaved fragments can alternatively be detected via amplification (e.g., [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]) or further modification to allow for other chemical means of detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolcott MJ | title = Advances in nucleic acid-based detection methods | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 370–86 | date = October 1992 | pmid = 1423216 | pmc = 358255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When working with small concentrations of target DNA, the CPT protocol can be modified to increase specificity and efficiency. Increasing allotted time has been shown to improve probe cleavage efficiency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Both increasing RNase H concentrations and use of a probe that isn’t prone to inter-probe and intra-probe interactions has been show to increase specificity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Advantages ==
Because cycling probe technology does not involve the amplification of target DNA, CPT has a lower risk of [[Polymerase chain reaction optimization|cross contamination]] than PCR.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, CPT is faster than PCR&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and doesn’t require a specialized [[Thermal cycler|thermocycler]]. CPT also does not require running CPT products on a [[Gel electrophoresis|gel]].

== Disadvantages ==
CPT requires specialized chimeric probes, making CPT assays more expensive than PCR.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Because CPT probes are so specific, a new probe must be designed for each unique assay, further increasing cost. Clinical implementation is hampered financially, but it is also limited by the possibility of samples containing nonspecific [[RNAse|RNases]] other than RNase H.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Applications ==
CPT can be used to detect specific DNA sequences and by extension specific [[genotype]]s. For example CPT can be used to distinguish [[Genetically modified organism|GMO]] produce from non-GMO produce.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Clinically, CPT can be used as an alternative to cell culturing in order to detect [[Antimicrobial resistance|antibacterial resistance]] of a pathogen.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

CPT, at its core,  detects whether a specific sequence is present in a sample. But because cleaved probes accumulate following [[Rate equation|linear rate kinetics]], the amount of target DNA can be quantified. Consequently, CPT has been used to quantify the number of non-coding repeats in organisms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

CPT can be used in conjunction with other technologies, like [[molecular beacon]]s and [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|qPCR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jacroux T, Rieck DC, Cui R, Ouyang Y, Dong WJ | title = Enzymatic amplification of DNA/RNA hybrid molecular beacon signaling in nucleic acid detection | journal = Analytical Biochemistry | volume = 432 | issue = 2 | pages = 106–14 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23000602 | pmc = 3522425 | doi = 10.1016/j.ab.2012.09.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Defence Scientific Information &amp; Documentation Centre''' (DESIDOC) is a division of the [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]] (DRDO). Located in [[Delhi]], its main function is the collection, processing and dissemination of relevant technical information for DRDO scientists. The present director of DESIDOC is Ms. Alka Suri.

== History ==

DESIDOC started functioning in 1958 as Scientific Information Bureau (SIB). It was a division of the Defence Science Laboratory (DSL) which is now called Laser Science &amp; Technology Centre. The DRDO library which had its beginning in 1948 became a division of SIB in 1959. In 1967 SIB was reorganised with augmented activities and named Defence Scientific Information and Documentation Centre (DESIDOC). It still continued to function under the administrative control of DSL. DESIDOC became a self-accounting unit and one of the laboratories of DRDO on 29 July 1970.

The Centre was functioning in the main building of Metcalfe House, a landmark in Delhi and a national monument. In August 1988 it moved to its newly built five-storeyed building in the same Metcalfe House complex. Since it became a self-accounting unit, DESIDOC has been functioning as a central information resource for DRDO. It provides S&amp;T information, based on its library and other information resources, to the DRDO headquarters, and its various laboratories at various places in India.

== Functions ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5874">The '''directed listening and thinking activity''' (DLTA) is a strategy that was first identified by Stauffer (1980). It is used with [[early childhood]] students or students who are not yet successful [[independent reading|independent readers]]. Teachers use this strategy to establish a purpose for reading with their students. With the use of this strategy students can become engaged in a text that they could not otherwise read on their own. Students are prepared to listen to a story that will be read by their teacher by being given specific information that they are to focus on as they listen. The strategy utilizes pre-reading, reading, and post-reading questions and discussions. Teachers use this strategy in an attempt to build on the knowledge that students already know and apply it to new information and situations. Students are provided with a framework to organize and recall information from storybooks. The directed reading and thinking activity is a very similar strategy that can be applied once this strategy is mastered and students become more advanced, independent readers.

==Purpose==
Students need to be explicitly taught strategies for the [[reading comprehension|comprehension]] of a story. The purpose of this strategy is to give the students skills so that they can eventually internalize reading skills such as, setting purposes for reading and [[:wikt:summarize|summarizing]] what they have read. As a result of continuously using this strategy in the classroom students should develop [[metacognition]] of their own reading abilities and as a result a better comprehension, understanding, and connections to texts.

==Procedure==
===Preparing for reading===

===Reading the story===
The teacher now begins to read the story. It is important to make sure that students can see all of the [[Book illustration|illustrations]]. The teacher should stop one or two times to discuss the story and to ask the students which previous predictions were correct. Students should also continue to make predictions at a few points in the story as well. It is important not to ask too many questions while reading the story. To help students to focus attention on the story, it is better to wait until after reading it through once to ask most of the questions about the students’ reactions, comments, and questions.

===Discussion after reading===
This is the final part of the directed listening and thinking activity. At this time there should be a discussion between the students and the teacher that is connected to the objectives and purposes for reading that were originally established. For example, if the skill that was established was sequencing the students will need to recall information about the order of the events in the story. The end is a way to tie together the skills that the students were focusing on and to summarize what they have learned as a result of listening to the story. If the students do not respond to particular questions that are asked about the story it is the teacher’s responsibility to model or scaffold their responses. This can be done by asking a question in a different or simpler way or by giving the student more information. This should also be a time to go back to the predictions that were initially listed and revise and discuss them. After the teacher has discussed the story and the objectives as a group an independent activity can be done to assess what the students have learned.

==Reading objectives==
There are a wide range of objectives that you can use with this strategy. Basically any skill that pertains to the text can be employed. Examples of the different types of skills that the directed listening activity can be used to enhance are: literal information such as, sequencing and recalling facts, inferential responses such as, interpreting the feelings of characters, making predictions, relating story events to real-life experiences and visualizing, or critical responses such as, evaluating and problem solving. The strategy can also be used with various genres and story structures. However, it is important to remember that the three steps to using this strategy are always the same:

#preparation for reading
#reading
#discussion after reading.

==Conclusion==
In a study conducted by Morrow (1984) children scored higher on comprehension tests when this strategy was utilized in the classroom because of its focus on many skills that are important to good readers. The study also proved that the modeling and scaffolding used by the teacher during this technique better prepared students to understand unfamiliar texts. When this strategy is used in classrooms it will allow students to better comprehend and connect with the texts that are being read to them. If this strategy is done correctly and frequently it will bring students more independence and [[reading readiness]]. It will lead to the creation of more engaged and skilled readers who possess the ability to [[critical thinking|think critically]] and analyze the texts that they have read.

'''Divine command theory''' (also known as '''theological voluntarism''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voluntarism-theological/ Theological Voluntarism]&amp;nbsp;— [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with [[medieval theological voluntarism]] and [[theological voluntarism as an approach to natural philosophy]].&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] theory which proposes that an action's status as [[Morality|morally]] [[good]] is equivalent to whether it is commanded by [[God]]. The theory asserts that what is moral is determined by what God commands, and that for a person to be moral is to follow his commands. Followers of both monotheistic and polytheistic religions in ancient and modern times have often accepted the importance of God's commands in establishing morality.

Numerous variants of the theory have been presented: historically, figures including [[Saint Augustine]], [[Duns Scotus]], [[William of Ockham]] and [[Søren Kierkegaard]] have presented various versions of divine command theory; more recently, [[Robert Merrihew Adams]] has proposed a "modified divine command theory" based on the [[omnibenevolence]] of God in which morality is linked to human conceptions of right and wrong. [[Paul Copan]] has argued in favour of the theory from a Christian viewpoint, and [[Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski]]'s divine motivation theory proposes that God's motivations, rather than commands, are the source of morality.

Semantic challenges to divine command theory have been proposed; the philosopher William Wainwright argued that to be commanded by God and to be morally obligatory do not have an identical meaning, which he believed would make defining obligation difficult. He also contended that, as knowledge of God is required for morality by divine command theory, [[Atheism|atheists]] and [[Agnosticism|agnostics]] could not be moral; he saw this as a weakness of the theory. Others have challenged the theory on [[Modal logic|modal]] grounds by arguing that, even if God's command and morality correlate in this world, they may not do so in other possible worlds. In addition, the [[Euthyphro dilemma]], first proposed by [[Plato]] (in the context of polytheistic Greek religion), presented a dilemma which threatened either to leave morality subject to the whims of God, or challenge his omnipotence. Divine command theory has also been criticised for its apparent incompatibility with the omnibenevolence of God, moral [[autonomy]] and [[religious pluralism]], although some scholars have attempted to defend the theory from these challenges.

==General form==
Various forms of divine command theory have been presented by philosophers including [[William of Ockham]], [[St Augustine]], [[Duns Scotus]], and [[John Calvin]]. The theory generally teaches that moral truth does not exist independently of [[God]] and that morality is determined by divine commands. Stronger versions of the theory assert that God's command is the only reason that a good action is moral, while weaker variations cast divine command as a vital component within a greater reason.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;Martin 1993, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; The theory asserts that good actions are morally good as a result of their being commanded by God, and many [[religious belief|religious believers]] subscribe to some form of divine command theory.&lt;ref&gt;Geirsson, Holmgren 2010, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these premises, adherents believe that moral obligation is obedience to God's commands; what is morally right is what God desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/ | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=3 April 2012 | author=Austin, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Divine command theory features in the ethics of many modern religions, including [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], the [[Bahá'í Faith]], and [[Christianity]], as well as being a part of numerous older [[polytheism|polytheistic religions]].&lt;ref&gt;Rae 2009, ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Athens]], it was commonly held that moral truth was tied directly to divine commands, and religious piety was almost equivalent to morality.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski 2011, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Although Christianity does not entail divine command theory, it is commonly associated with it. It can be a plausible theory to Christians because the traditional conception of God as the creator of the universe supports the idea that he created moral truths. The theory is supported by the Christian view that God is all-powerful because this implies that God creates moral truths, rather than moral truths existing independently of him, which seems inconsistent with his omnipotence.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;

===Augustine===
[[Saint Augustine]] offered a version of divine command theory that began by casting ethics as the pursuit of the supreme good, which delivers human happiness. He argued that to achieve this happiness, humans must love objects that are worthy of human love in the correct manner; this requires humans to love God, which then allows them to correctly love that which is worthy of being loved. Augustine's ethics proposed that the act of loving God enables humans to properly orient their loves, leading to human happiness and fulfilment.&lt;ref name=IEP-2&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#H2 | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=15 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine supported [[Plato|Plato's]] view that a well-ordered soul is a desirable consequence of morality. However, unlike Plato, he believed that achieving a well-ordered soul had a higher purpose: living in accordance with God's commands. His view of morality was thus heteronomous, as he believed in deference to a higher authority (God), rather than acting [[autonomy#Philosophy|autonomously]].&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, Keller, Leever &amp; White 2009, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Duns Scotus===
[[File:JohnDunsScotus.jpg|thumb|John Duns Scotus, who proposed a variant of divine command theory]]
[[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosopher [[John Duns Scotus]] argued that the only moral obligations that God could not take away from humans are to love God, as God is, definitionally, the most loveable thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Revelation: From Metaphor to Analogy | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Swinburne, Richard | year=2007 | pages=358–359 | isbn=978-0-19-921246-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotus argued that the [[natural law]], in the strictest sense, contains only what is self-evidently [[logical truth|analytically true]] and that God could not make these statements false. This means that the commands of natural law do not depend on God's will, and thus form the first three commandments of the [[Ten Commandments]]. The last seven of the [[Ten Commandments]] do not belong to the natural law in the strictest sense.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite book|last1=Scotus|first1=John Duns|title=Selected Writings on Ethics|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967341-4|pages=Ordinatio III, D. 37, "Do all the precepts of the Decalogue belong to the natural law?"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst our duties to God are [[Self-evidence|self-evident]], [[Analytic proposition|true by definition]], and unchangeable even by God, our duties to others (found on the second tablet) were arbitrarily willed by God and are within his power to revoke and replace (although, the third commandment, to honour the Sabbath and keep it holy, has a little of both, as we are absolutely obliged to render worship to God, but there is no obligation in natural law to do it on this day or that). Scotus does note, however that the last seven commandments "''are highly consonant with [the natural law], though they do not follow necessarily from first practical principles that are known in virtue of their terms and are necessarily known by any intellect [that understands their terms. And it is certain that all the precepts of the second table belong to the natural law in this second way, since their rectitude is highly consonant with first practical principles that are known necessarily''".&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite book|last1=Scotus|first1=John Duns|title=Selected Writings on Ethics|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967341-4|pages=Ordinatio III, D. 37, Q. UN, para. 25, 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Williams|2013|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/duns-scotus/#NatLaw Ethics and Moral Psychology: The natural law]}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=312–316}}&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Cross|1999|p=92}} for the view that our duties to others "hold automatically [i.e., without God's commands] unless God commands otherwise."&lt;/ref&gt; Scotus justifies this position with the example of a peaceful society, noting that the possession of private property is not necessary to have a peaceful society, but that "those of weak character" would be more easily made peaceful with private property than without. Hence, the last seven commandments do belong to the natural law, but not in the strictest sense, as they belong to the natural law by rectitude rather than by definition.

===St. Thomas Aquinas===

Whilst Aquinas, as a natural law theorist, is generally seen as holding that morality is not willed by God,&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/#NatLaw&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly James Clark and Anne Poortenga have presented a defence of divine command theory based on [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas']] moral theory. Aquinas proposed a theory of natural law which asserted that something is moral if it works towards the purpose of human existence, and so human nature can determine what is moral. Clark and Poortenga argued that God created human nature and thus commanded a certain morality; hence he cannot arbitrarily change what is right or wrong for humans.&lt;ref name="IEP Euthyphro responces"/&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
The [[deontological ethics]] of [[Immanuel Kant]] has been cast as rejecting divine command theory by several figures, among whom is ethicist [[R. M. Hare]]. Kant's view that morality should be determined by the [[categorical imperative]]&amp;nbsp;– duty to the moral law, rather than acting for a specific end&amp;nbsp;– has been viewed as incompatible with divine command theory. Philosopher and theologian [[John E. Hare]] has noted that some philosophers see divine command theory as an example of Kant's [[heteronomy|heteronomous will]]&amp;nbsp;– motives besides the moral law, which Kant regarded as non-moral.&lt;ref name=PT263&gt;Phillips &amp; Tessin 2000, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; American philosopher [[Lewis White Beck]] takes Kant's argument to be a refutation of the theory that morality depends of divine authority.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips &amp; Tessin 2000, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; John E. Hare challenges this view, arguing that [[Kantian ethics]] should be seen as compatible with divine command theory.&lt;ref name=PT263/&gt;

===Robert Adams===
[[File:RobertMerrihewAdams20060625.jpg|thumb|Robert Merrihew Adams proposes what he calls a "modified divine command theory"]]
American philosopher [[Robert Merrihew Adams]] proposes what he calls a "modified divine command theory".&lt;ref name=P&amp;R2008&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2008, p. 558&lt;/ref&gt; Adams presents the basic form of his theory by asserting that two statements are equivalent:
#It is wrong to do X.
#It is contrary to God's commands to do X.&lt;ref name=P&amp;R2008/&gt;
He proposes that God's commands precurse moral truths and must be explained in terms of moral truths, not the other way around. Adams writes that his theory is an attempt to define what being ethically 'wrong' consists of and accepts that it is only useful to those within a [[Judeo-Christian]] context. In dealing with the criticism that a seemingly immoral act would be obligatory if God commanded it, he proposes that God does not command cruelty for its own sake. Adams does not propose that it would be logically impossible for God to command cruelty, rather that it would be unthinkable for him to do so because of his nature. Adams emphasises the importance of [[faith]] in God, specifically faith in God's goodness, as well as his existence.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2008, p. 558-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams proposes that an action is morally wrong [[if and only if]] it defies the commands of a loving God. If cruelty was commanded, he would not be loving; Adams argued that, in this instance, God's commands would not have to be obeyed and also that his theory of ethical wrongness would break down. He proposed that divine command morality assumes that human concepts of right and wrong are met by God's commands and that the theory can only be applied if this is the case.&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2003, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; Adams' theory attempts to counter the challenge that morality might be arbitrary, as moral commands are not based solely on the commands of God, but are founded on his [[omnibenevolence]]. It attempts to challenge the claim that an external standard of morality prevents God from being sovereign by making him the source of morality and his character the moral law.&lt;ref name="IEP Adams"/&gt;

Adams proposes that in many Judeo-Christian contexts, the term 'wrong' is used to mean being contrary to God's commands. In ethical contexts, he believes that 'wrong' [[logical consequence|entails]] an [[emotivism|emotional]] attitude against an action and that these two uses of wrongness usually correlate.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2008, p. 561-2&lt;/ref&gt; Adams suggests that a believer's concept of morality is founded in their religious belief and that right and wrong are tied to their belief in God; this works because God always commands what believers accept to be right. If God commanded what a believer perceived as wrong, the believer would not say it is right or wrong to disobey him; rather their concept of morality would break down.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2008, p. 559&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Austin writes that an implication of this modified divine command theory is that God cannot command cruelty for its own sake; this could be argued to be inconsistent with God's omnipotence. Thomas Aquinas argued that God's omnipotence should be understood as the ability to do all things that are possible: he attempted to refute the idea that God's inability to perform illogical actions challenges his omnipotence. Austin contends that commanding cruelty for its own sake is not illogical, so is not covered by Aquinas' defence, although Aquinas had argued that sin is the falling short of a perfect action and thus not compatible with omnipotence.&lt;ref name="IEP Adams"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH7a | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative theories===
[[Paul Copan]] argues from a Christian viewpoint that man, made in God's image, conforms to God's sense of morality. The description of actions as right or wrong are therefore relevant to God; a person's sense of what is right or wrong corresponds to God's.&lt;ref name=Copan&gt;Copan, Paul, and William Lane Craig. ''Passionate Conviction: Contemporary Discourses on Christian Apologetics.'' Nashville, Tennessee: B&amp;H Publishing Group, 2007. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|We would not know goodness without God's endowing us with a moral constitution. We have rights, dignity, freedom, and responsibility because God has designed us this way. In this, we reflect God's moral goodness as His image-bearers.|Paul Copan|Passionate Conviction: Contemporary Discourses on Christian Apologetics&lt;ref name="Copan" /&gt;}}

As an alternative to divine command theory, Linda Zagzebski has proposed divine motivation theory, which still fits into a monotheistic framework. According to this theory, goodness is determined by God's motives, rather than by what he commands. Divine motivation theory is similar to [[virtue ethics]] because it considers the character of an agent, and whether they are in accordance with God's, as the standard for moral value.&lt;ref&gt;Baggett &amp; Walls 2011, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; Zagzebski argues that things in the world have objective moral properties, such as being lovable, which are given to them through God's perception of them. God's attitude towards something is cast as a morally good attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-238093747.html | title=Zagzebski, Linda Trinkaus. Divine Motivation Theory.(Book review) | publisher=The Review of Metaphysics | date=1 September 2010 | accessdate=25 August 2012 | author=Toner, Christopher |via=[[HighBeam]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory casts God as a good example for morality, and humans should imitate his virtues as much as is possible for finite, imperfect beings.&lt;ref&gt;Langermann 2011, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objections==

===Semantic objections===
Philosopher William Wainwright considered a challenge to the theory on semantic grounds, arguing that "being commanded by God" and "being obligatory" do not mean the same thing, contrary to what the theory suggests. He used the example of water not having an identical meaning to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to propose that "being commanded by God" does not have an identical meaning to "being obligatory". This was not an objection to the truth of divine command theory, but Wainwright believed it demonstrated that the theory should not be used to formulate assertions about the meaning of obligation.&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright 2005, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Wainwright also noted that divine command theory might imply that one can only have moral knowledge if one has knowledge of God; Edward Wierenga argued that, if this is the case, the theory seems to deny atheists and agnostics moral knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright 2005, p. 106-107&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh Storer Chandler has challenged the theory based on [[modal logic|modal]] ideas of what might exist in different worlds. He suggested that, even if one accepts that being commanded by God and being morally right are the same, they may not be synonyms because they might be different in other possible worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler 2007, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral motivation===
Michael Austin has noted that divine command theory could be criticised for prompting people to be moral with impure motivations. He writes of the objection that a moral life should be sought because morality is valued, rather than to avoid punishment or receive a reward. This punishment and reward system of motivation could be seen as inadequate.&lt;ref name=IEP-2 /&gt;

===Euthyphro dilemma===
[[File:Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377.jpg|thumb|Plato presents the Euthyphro dilemma in one of his dialogues.]]
{{Main|Euthyphro dilemma}}
The [[Euthyphro dilemma]] was proposed in [[Plato|Plato's]] dialogue between [[Socrates]] and [[Euthyphro]]. In the scene, Socrates and Euthyphro are discussing the nature of piety when Socrates presents the dilemma, which can be presented as the question 'Is X good because God commands it, or does God command X because it is good?'&lt;ref name=IEPPlato&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#H3 | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=3 April 2012 | author=Austin, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?|Plato|Euthyphro&lt;ref name=IEPPlato/&gt;}}
The Euthyphro dilemma can elicit the response that an action is good because God commands the action, or that God commands an action because it is good. If the first is chosen, it would imply that whatever God commands must be good: even if he commanded someone to inflict suffering, then inflicting suffering must be moral. If the latter is chosen, then morality is no longer dependent on God, defeating the divine command theory. Additionally, if God is subject to an external law, he is not sovereign or [[omnipotent]], which would challenge the orthodox conception of God. Proponents of the Euthyphro dilemma might claim that divine command theory is obviously wrong because either answer challenges the ability of God to give moral laws.&lt;ref name=IEPPlato/&gt;

[[William of Ockham]] responded to the Euthyphro Dilemma by '[[bite the bullet|biting the bullet]]'. He argued that, if God did command people to be cruel, then that would be morally obligatory, proposing that the only limitation to what God can make obligatory is the [[principle of non-contradiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Moral Dilemmas in Medieval Thought: From Gratian to Aquinas | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Dougherty, M. V. | year=2011 | pages=163–164 | isbn=978-1-107-00707-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]] defended Ockham's view, noting that it is only a logical possibility that God would command what we consider to be immoral, not an actuality. Even if God could logically command these actions, he would not because that is not his character.&lt;ref name="IEP Euthyphro responces"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH4 | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=3 April 2012 | author=Austin, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleonore Stump and [[Norman Kretzmann]] have responded to the Euthyphro dilemma by appealing to the doctrine of [[divine simplicity]], a concept associated with Aquinas and [[Aristotle]] which suggests that the substance and attributes of God are identical. They propose that God and goodness are identical and that this is what makes his commands good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=God, Goodness and Philosophy | publisher=Ashgate Publishing | author=Harris, Harriet | year=2011 | pages=101 | isbn=978-1-4094-2852-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American philosopher [[William Alston]] responded to the [[Euthyphro dilemma]] by considering what it means for God to be morally good. If divine command theory is accepted, it implies that God is good because he obeys his own commands; Alston argued that this is not the case and that God's goodness is distinct from abiding by moral obligations. He suggested that a moral obligation implies that there is some possibility that the agent may not honour their obligation; Alston argued that this possibility does not exist for God, so his morality must be distinct from simply obeying his own commands. Alston contended that God is the supreme standard of morality and acts according to his character, which is necessarily good. There is no more arbitrariness in this view than accepting another moral standard.&lt;ref name="IEP Euthyphro responces"/&gt;

===Omnibenevolence===
[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], and some more recent philosophers, challenged the theory because it seems to entail that God's goodness consists of his following his own commands. It is argued that, if divine command theory is accepted, God's obligations would be what he commanded himself to do; the concept of God commanding himself is seen as incoherent. Neither could God hold any virtues, as a virtue would be the disposition to follow his own commands&amp;nbsp;– if he cannot logically command himself, then he cannot logically have any virtues. Edward Wierenga counters this by claiming that whatever God chooses to do is good, but that his nature means that his actions would always be praiseworthy. William Wainwright argues that, although God does not act because of his commands, it is still logical to say that God has reasons for his actions. He proposes that God is motivated by what is morally good and, when he commands what is morally good, it becomes morally obligatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH7b | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autonomy===
Michael Austin draws attention to an objection from autonomy, which argues that morality requires an agent to freely choose which principles they live by. This challenges the view of divine command theory that God's will determines what is good because humans are no longer autonomous, but followers of an imposed moral law, making autonomy incompatible with divine command theory. Robert Adams challenges this criticism, arguing that humans must still choose to accept or reject God's commands and rely on their independent judgement about whether or not to follow them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH7c | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pluralism===
Austin considers the view that, in a world of [[religious pluralism]], it is impossible to know which god's or religion's commands should be followed, especially because some religions contradict others, leaving it impossible to accept all of them. Within religions there are also various interpretations of what is commanded. Austin notes that some of the responses to the autonomy objection may be relevant, as an agent must choose whichever [[religion and morality]] they judge to be correct. He argues that divine command theory is also consistent with the view that [[Ethics in religion|moral truths can be found in all religions]] and that moral revelation can be found [[Morality without religion|apart from religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/#SH7d | title=Divine Command Theory | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2012 | author=Austin, Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heimir Geirsson and Margaret Holmgren argue against the view that different religions can lead to the same God because some religions are incompatible with each other (monotheistic and polytheistic religions have contrasting views of divinity, for example, and some Greek or Norse gods magnified human weaknesses). They argue that determining which god should be listened to remains a problem and that, even within a religion, contrasting views of God exist&amp;nbsp;– the commands of God in the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s could seem to contradict each other.&lt;ref&gt;Geirsson &amp; Holmgren 2010, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7063">'''Ecocomposition''' is a way of looking at [[literacy]] using concepts from [[ecology]]. It is a postprocess theory of writing instruction that tries to account for factors beyond hierarchically defined goals within social settings; however, it doesn't dismiss these goals. Rather, it incorporates them within an ecological view that extends the range of factors affecting the writing process beyond the social to include aspects such as "[[Location (geography)|place]]" and "[[nature]]." Its main motto, then, is "Writing Takes Place" (also the title of one of Sidney I. Dobrin's articles on ecocomposition).

The theory for ecocomposition dates back to Marilyn Cooper's 1986 essay "The Ecology of Writing" and Richard Coe's "Eco-Logic for the Composition Classroom" (1975). More recently, Dobrin and Weisser (2002) have assembled a more detailed theory of ecocomposition, placing it in relation to [[ecofeminism]], ecocriticism [https://web.archive.org/web/20050211214042/http://www.asle.umn.edu/archive/intro/estok.html], and [[environmental ethics]]. Other scholars (e.g., Reynolds, 2004) have shown its close proximity to [[social geography]]. According to ecofeminist scholar [[Greta Gaard]] (2001), "at its most inclusive, ecocomposition has the potential to address social issues such as feminism, environmental ethics, multiculturalism, politics, and economics, all by examining matters of form and style, audience and argumentation, and reliable sources and documentation" (p.&amp;nbsp;163).

Ecocomposition is one area of scholarly study discussed at the [[Conference on College Composition and Communication]] (CCCC), a national forum for writing instructors and scholars. As an educational endeavor, it is linked most closely with [[progressive education]] (Dewey, 1915), critical education (Giroux, 1987), and place-based education (Sobel, 2004).

Ecocomposition asks what effects a place has (or different places have) on the writing process. In what ways is our identity influenced by place, and what bearing does this have on our writing? What sets of relationships help us define our place—including  the relationship between writer and reader? How do the sometimes contradictory sets of relationships in which we write allow us to see certain possibilities and foreclose others? How do these relationships define reality for each of us in different ways?

"Ecology", in the wide sense in which it was used by Coe and Cooper, includes both natural and social relations. Hence, ecocomposition instructors emphasize not only the writer's relationship to physical place but also the social relations among writers and readers. In the classroom, this translates into pedagogical practices that "emphasize the value of fostering community and collaboration throughout the writing process" (Gaard, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;166). As a post-process method of writing instruction, ecocomposition attends not only to the process of writing but also what happens to texts after they are written. Thus, ecocomposition instructors focus not only on the process of composition but also on its purpose, encouraging students to write for specific audiences, adapting their style and content to match their purpose and audience.

While a primary concern has been the relationship between the writing process and natural places, concepts of spatiality also apply to cyberspace and online writing—in [[MUD]]s, [[MOO]]s, [[Internet Relay Chat]], [[Instant messages|Instant Messages]], and [[e-mail]] (Syverson, 1999; Yagelski, 2002). Ecocomposition instructors may use [[blogs]] or other means by which to allow students to interact with one another and/or write for a real audience beyond the classroom (see, e.g., Jones, 2008).

Ecocomposition should not be confused or conflated with other systemic approaches to writing such as [[activity theory]], which do not account for the dynamic relationship between writing and place but posit a transcendent "context" that affects writing.

'''Ellen Henrietta Swallow Richards''' (December 3, 1842 &amp;ndash; March 30, 1911) was an [[Industrial engineering|industrial]] and [[Safety engineering|safety engineer]], [[environmental chemist]], and university faculty member in the United States during the 19th century. Her pioneering work in sanitary engineering, and experimental research in domestic science, laid a foundation for the new science of [[home economics]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=2135&amp;ResourceType=Building |title=Richards, Ellen Swallow, Residence |date=April 7, 1991 |accessdate=2013-09-04 |quote= |publisher=[[National Historic Landmarks Program]] |location= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011063112/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=2135&amp;ResourceType=Building |archivedate=October 11, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the founder of the home economics movement characterized by the application of science to the home, and the first to apply chemistry to the study of nutrition.&lt;ref name=mozans&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mozans|first1=H.

== Biography ==

=== Early childhood ===
[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards 1848.jpg|thumb|upright|Daguerreotype of Ellen Henrietta Swallow, c. 1848]]
Richards was born in [[Dunstable, Massachusetts]]. She was the only child of Peter Swallow (b. June 27, 1813, Dunstable; d. March 1871, Littleton, Massachusetts) and Fanny Gould Taylor (b. April 9, 1817, [[New Ipswich, New Hampshire]]), both of whom came from established families of modest means and were believers in the value of education.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

=== Early life and education ===
Swallow was home-schooled in her early years. In 1859 the family moved to Westford and she attended [[Westford Academy]].&lt;ref name="Hunt"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hunt | first = Caroline Louisa | title = The life of Ellen H. Richards | publisher = Whitcomb &amp; Barrows | edition = 1st | location = Boston | year = 1912 | isbn = | url = https://archive.org/details/lifeofellenhrich00huntrich }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies at the academy included mathematics, composition, and Latin, similar to other New England academies of the time.  Swallow's Latin proficiency allowed her to study French and German, a rare language north of New York.&lt;ref name="JuneKennedy"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kennedy | first = June W. | title = Westford Recollections of Days Gone By: Recorded Interviews 1974-1975 A Millennium Update | publisher = Author House | edition = 1st | location = Bloomington, IN | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-4259-2388-7 | lccn = 2006904814 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of her language skills she was much in demand as a tutor, and the income earned doing this made it possible for Swallow to further her studies.

[[File:Old Westford Academy, MA.jpg|thumb|Old Westford Academy]]

In March 1862, she left the academy. Two months later, in May, she developed the [[measles]] which set her back physically and interrupted her preparations to begin teaching.

[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards.jpg|thumb|upright|Miss Ellen Henrietta Swallow, c. 1864]]
In the spring of 1863 the family moved to Littleton, Massachusetts, where Mr. Swallow had just purchased a larger store and expanded his business. In June 1864, Swallow, now twenty-one, took a teaching position.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

She did not teach again in 1865 but spent that year tending the family store and taking care of her ill mother. During the winter of 1865–66, Swallow studied and attended lectures in Worcester.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

=== College education ===
In September 1868 she entered [[Vassar College]] classified as a special student.  Somewhat over a year later she was admitted to the senior class, graduating in 1870 with a bachelor's degree.  She then earned a Master of Art's degree with a thesis on the chemical analysis of iron ore. The strongest personal influences during her college years were [[Maria Mitchell]], the astronomer, and Professor Charles S. Farrar (1826-1908&lt;ref name="FarrarVassar"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/faculty/original-faculty/charles-farrar.html |title= Charles Farrar |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= Vassar Encyclopedia|publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), who was at the head of the Department of Natural Sciences and Mathematics.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;
{{multiple image|header= |direction=vertical|align=right|image1 = Ellen Swallow Richards Vassar 1870.jpg|caption1 = Miss Ellen Henrietta Swallow, Vassar Class Picture, 1870|image2 = EllenSwallowRichardsThesisSignature.svg|caption2 =Signature from 1873 MIT thesis}}
In 1870, she wrote to Merrick and Gray, commercial chemists in Boston, asking if they would take her on as an apprentice.  They replied that they were not in a position to take pupils, and that her best course was to try to enter the Institute of Technology of Boston as a student.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;
On December 10, 1870, after some discussion and a vote, the Faculty of the Institute of Technology recommend to the Corporation the admission of Miss Swallow as a special student in Chemistry.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt; Swallow thus became the first woman admitted to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] where she was able to continue her studies, "it being understood that her admission did not establish a precedent for the general admission of females" according to the records of the meeting of the [[MIT Corporation]] on December 14, 1870.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/esr/esr-mit.html#corp Ellen Swallow Richards &amp; MIT: Institute Archives &amp; Special Collections: MIT]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1873, Swallow received a Bachelor of Science degree from MIT for her thesis, "Notes on Some Sulpharsenites and Sulphantimonites from Colorado".&lt;ref&gt;[http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/esr/esr-swallow.pdf Notes on Some Sulpharsenites and Sulphantimonites from Colorado]&lt;/ref&gt; She continued her studies at MIT and would have been awarded its first advanced degree, but MIT balked at granting this distinction to a woman and did not award its first advanced degree, a Master of Science in Chemistry, until 1886.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

Richards served on the board of trustees of Vassar College for many years and was granted an honorary doctor of science degree in 1910.

=== Marriage and home ===
[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards 1904.jpg|upright|thumb|Robert and Ellen Richards, 1904]]
On June 4, 1875, Miss Swallow married [[Robert Hallowell Richards|Robert H. Richards]] (1844-1945), chairman of the [[Mine Engineering]] Department at MIT, with whom she had worked in the mineralogy laboratory.  They took up residence in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. With her husband's support she remained associated with MIT, volunteering her services and contributing $1,000 annually to the "Woman's Laboratory," a program in which her students were mostly schoolteachers, whose training had lacked laboratory work, and who wanted to perform chemical experiments and learn mineralogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rossiter|first1=Margaret W.|title=Women Scientists in America|date=1982|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0801824435|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Her first post-college career was as an unpaid chemistry lecturer at MIT from 1873 to 1878.&lt;ref name=zierdt /&gt;

[[File:Lawrence Experiment Station - DSC03522.JPG|thumb|right|2011 addition to the [[Lawrence Experiment Station]]]]
From 1884 until her death, Swallow now Richards was an instructor at the newly founded laboratory of sanitary chemistry at the [[Lawrence Experiment Station]], the first in the United States, headed by her former professor [[William R. Nichols]].

In 1884 she was appointed as an instructor in sanitary chemistry at a newly formed MIT laboratory for the study of sanitation.&lt;ref name=ogilvie&gt;{{Cite book

    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. Richards was a consulting chemist for the Massachusetts State Board of Health from 1872 to 1875, and the Commonwealth's official water analyst from 1887 until 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/women-scientists/ellen-h-swallow-richards.html|title=Ellen H. Swallow Richards (1842–1911) - American Chemical Society|website=American Chemical Society|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also served as nutrition expert for the US Department of Agriculture.

== Scientific experiments ==

=== Air and water quality ===

In the 1880s, her interests turned toward issues of sanitation, in particular air and water quality.&lt;ref name=zierdt /&gt; She performed a series of water tests on 40,000 samples of local waters which served as drinking water for their immediate populations.  These led to the so-called "Richards' Normal Chlorine Map" which was predictive of inland water pollution in the state of Massachusetts. This map plotted the chloride concentrations in waters of the state. It illustrated the natural distribution of chlorides from the ocean. (Her survey long preceded the practice of road de-icing with chlorine derivative salts.) Her map plotted greater than 6.5 parts per million (ppm) of chloride near the coast, with Cape Cod concentrations well in excess of 10 ppm and with a near-steady decreasing gradient to less than 1 ppm about the Berkshire Hills in the extreme western end of the state. Thereby waters with chloride concentrations that deviated from the plot could be suspected of human pollution. As a result, Massachusetts established the first water-quality standards in America, and the first modern [[sewage treatment plant]] was created.&lt;ref name=oakes /&gt;

=== Mineralogy ===
Richards' master's thesis at Vassar was an analysis of the amount of [[vanadium]] in iron ore.&lt;ref name=oakes&gt;{{Cite book

        |publication-date = 2002
        }}&lt;/ref&gt;
She performed numerous experiments in mineralogy, including the discovery of an insoluble residue of the rare mineral [[Samarskite-(Y)|samarskite]]. This was later determined by other scientists to yield [[samarium]] and [[gadolinium]]. In 1879 she was recognized by the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers as their first female member.&lt;ref name=zierdt&gt;{{Cite book

        |publication-date = 2000
        }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Home sanitation ===
Richards applied her scientific knowledge to the home. Since women were responsible for the home and family nutrition at the time, Richards felt that all women should be educated in the sciences. She wrote books about science for use in the home, such as ''The Chemistry of Cooking and Cleaning'', published in 1882.&lt;ref name=clarke&gt;{{Cite book
        |publisher = Follett Pub. Co.

        |author = Clarke, Robert
        |publication-date = 1973
        }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her book ''Food Materials and Their Adulterations''(1885) led to the passing of the first Pure Food and Drug Act in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=oakes /&gt;

She used her own home as a kind of experimental laboratory for healthier living through science. Concerned with air quality in her home, she moved from coal heating and cooking oil to gas. She and her husband installed fans to pull air from the home to the outside to create a cleaner air environment within the home. She also determined the water quality of the property's well through chemical testing, and to insure that waste water was not contaminating the drinking water.&lt;ref name=clarke /&gt;

=== Euthenics ===

Richards derived the term [[euthenics]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] verb Eutheneo, Εὐθηνέω (eu, well; the, root of tithemi, to cause). To be in a flourishing state, to abound in, to prosper.—''[[Demosthenes]]''. To be strong or vigorous.—''[[Herodotus]]''. To be vigorous in body.—''[[Aristotle]]''.&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards"&gt;{{cite book | last = Richards | first = Ellen H. Swallow | title = Euthenics: The Science of Controllable Environment : A Plea for Better Conditions As a First Step Toward Higher Human Efficiency | publisher = Whitcomb &amp; Barrows | edition = 2nd | location = Boston | origyear = 1910 | year = 1912 | isbn = 0405098278 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31508 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  And from the Greek [[Euthenia]], Εὐθηνία. Good state of the body: prosperity, good fortune, abundance.—''Herodotus''.&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards" /&gt; The opposite of Euthenia is [[Penia]] - Πενία ("deficiency" or "[[poverty]]") the personification of poverty and need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Penia.html Theoi Project - Penia]&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''Euthenics: the science of controllable environment'' (1910),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
    |publisher = Whitcomb &amp; Barrows
    |publication-place = Boston
    |author = Ellen H. Richards
    |url = https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7171559M/Euthenics_the_science_of_controllable_environment
    |title = Euthenics, the science of controllable environment
    |publication-date = 1910
    }}&lt;/ref&gt; she defined the term as the betterment of living conditions, through conscious endeavor, for the purpose of securing efficient human beings.

Vigorous debate about its exact meaning, confusion with the term [[eugenics]], followed by the [[Great Depression]] and two world wars, were among the many factors which led to the movement never really getting the funding, nor the attention needed to put together a lasting, vastly multidisciplinary curriculum as defined by Richards. Instead, different disciplines such as Child Study became one such curriculum.

Martin Heggestad of the Mann Library notes that:&lt;blockquote&gt; Starting around 1920, however, home economists tended to move into other fields, such as nutrition and textiles, that offered more career opportunities, while health issues were dealt with more in the hard sciences and in the professions of nursing and public health. Also, improvements in public sanitation (for example, the wider availability of sewage systems and of food inspection) led to a decline in infectious diseases and thus a decreasing need for the largely household-based measures taught by home economists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/h/hearth/hygiene.html HEARTH Library-Cornell University]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Richards was the first writer to use the term euthenics, in ''The Cost of Shelter'' (1905), with the meaning "the science of better living".&lt;ref name="JohnKGrandy"&gt;{{cite book | last = Grandy | first = John K. | editor-last = Birx | editor-first = H.J. | title = Euthenics | series = Encyclopedia of Anthropology | publisher = [[SAGE Publications]] | volume = 5 Vols. | location = Thousand Oaks, CA | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781412952453 | doi = 10.4135/9781412952453 | url =http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/anthropology/n312.xml }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laboratory work ===
After her first experience as water analyst under Professor Nichols, Richards began a large, private practice in sanitary chemistry, including testing water, air and food, and the testing wallpapers and fabrics for [[arsenic]]. In 1878 and 1879 she examined a large number of staple groceries for the state. The results of her investigation were published in the first annual report of the Board of Health, Lunacy and Charity, which had succeeded the earlier Board of Health.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

She also served as a consultant to the [[Zachariah Allen|Manufacturers Mutual Fire Insurance Company]] and in 1900 wrote the textbook ''Air, Water, and Food from a Sanitary Standpoint'', with A. G. Woodman. Her interest in the environment led her to introduce the word [[ecology]] into English around 1892. The word had been coined by German biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]] to describe the "household of nature".

Richards' interests also included applying scientific principles to domestic situations, such as [[nutrition]], [[clothing]], [[physical fitness]], [[sanitation]], and efficient home management, creating the field of [[home economics]]. "Perhaps the fact that I am not a radical and that I do not scorn womanly duties but claim it as a privilege to clean up and sort of supervise the room and sew things is winning me stronger allies than anything else," she wrote to her parents. She published ''The Chemistry of Cooking and Cleaning: A Manual for House-keepers'' in 1881, designed and demonstrated model kitchens, devised curricula, and organized conferences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/esr/esr-rumford.html Ellen Swallow Richards: Rumford Kitchen: Institute Archives &amp; Special Collections: MIT&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women's education ==

=== Woman's Laboratory assistant instructor ===
Mrs. Richards appeared before the [[American Association of University Women|Woman's Education Association]] of Boston on November 11, 1875, and in an address, which made a deep impression, set forth the needs of women. She expressed the belief that the governing board of the Institute of Technology would provide space for a woman's laboratory if the Association would supply the necessary money for instruments, apparatus, and books. She said that scholarships would be indispensable.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

The Woman's Education Association appointed a committee to enter into discussions with the Institute of Technology, which led to the creation of the MIT Woman's Laboratory in November 1876. The Institute provided a small building, planned for a gymnasium, as the location of the Laboratory.  Mrs. Richards became an unpaid assistant instructor in 1879 in [[chemical analysis]], [[industrial chemistry]], [[mineralogy]], and [[biology|applied biology]] under Professor John M. Ordway. The Woman's Education Association agreed to raise money to buy equipment for the laboratory.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

A new building, erected by the Institute in 1883, reserved space for all laboratory students' use, women as well as men. The original Woman's Laboratory was closed and the building demolished.

In 1884, Mrs. Richards was appointed Instructor in Sanitary Chemistry in the Institute of Technology itself, a position which she filled until the time of her death. In addition to her faculty duties and instructional work, she was also the "untitled" Dean of Women.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

=== American correspondence school instructor ===
In January 1876, Mrs. Richards began a long association with the first American correspondence school, the [[Society to Encourage Studies at Home]], as an instructor, and developed its science department.&lt;ref name="Hunt"/&gt;

In 1886, a new section promoted by Richards, Sanitary Science, was established by the Society. This was at a time when household conveniences employing water, gas, or electricity were becoming more common, but housekeepers seldom understood the dangers or difficulties inherent in using these new appliances. She saw that instruction was needed and the Society began to provide information on how to organize a house on truly scientific principles.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

=== American Association of University Women ===

[[File:AAUW Headquarters by Matthew Bisanz.JPG|thumb|upright|Headquarters of the AAUW in Washington DC]]
Richards and [[Marion Talbot]] (Boston University class of 1880) became the "founding mothers" of what was to become the [[American Association of University Women]] (AAUW) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://history.aauw.org/|website=AAUW.org|publisher=AAUW|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; when they invited fifteen other women college graduates to a meeting at Talbot's home in Boston, on November 28, 1881. The group envisioned an organization in which women college graduates would band together to open the doors of higher education to other women and to find wider opportunities for their training. The Association of Collegiate Alumnae (ACA), AAUW's predecessor organization, was officially founded on January 14, 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Association of Collegiate Alumnae Records|url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss323.html|publisher=Five College Archives &amp; Manuscript Collections|website=five colleges.edu|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teachers' School of Science ===
[[Lucretia Crocker]], along with women's clubs and other help in the Boston area, created a "[[Teachers' School of Science]]" in Back Bay at the New Museum of the Boston society.  Along with Mrs. Richards, Crocker created a mineralogy course for teachers.  Teacher found such education in the Boston area because of area scientist that would teach their courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Kohlstedt, Sally Gregory. |title = Nature, Not Books: Scientists and the Origins of the Nature-Study Movement in the 1890s. Isis, Vol. 96, No. 3 |date = September 2005 |pages=324–352, p. 328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New England Kitchen of Boston ===
In January 1, 1890, Richards collaborated with [[Mary Abel|Mary Hinman Abel]] (1850–1938) to found the New England Kitchen of Boston, at 142 Pleasant Street.  Using volunteers of modest circumstances, they experimented with ways to prepare the most inexpensive, tasty and nutritious food.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

Years later, Mrs. Richards, herself, wrote in her preface to part one of ''The Rumford kitchen leaflets: No. 17, The Story of the New England Kitchen; Part II; A study in social economics'', by Mary Abel:&lt;ref name="RumfordKitchen" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The story of the New England Kitchen ... is remarkable for two things: the new and valuable information which has been acquired, as the result of the daily work of the Kitchen, and the short time which has sufficed to put the enterprise on a business basis.

It is well to emphasize the causes of this success, that the lessons in social science and practical philanthropy be not lost. A large part of the credit is due ... to Mrs. Abel's hard work[.] [S]tarting the New England Kitchen ... was ... an experiment to determine the successful conditions of preparing, by scientific methods, from the cheaper food materials, nutritious and palatable dishes, which should find a ready demand at paying prices.

Mrs. Abel would doubtless give as the principal secret of her success, that she had everything necessary for the experiments, without giving a thought to the cost. ... In the New England Kitchen, the selection of the apparatus and material and the employment of labor have been without restriction. Without this freedom to carry on the experiments as seemed wise and prudent, the results detailed in the accompanying report could not have been attained.

The philanthropy of the scheme rests in the experimental stage of the development of the New England Kitchen. Whether the business can in the future take care of itself to the profit of those who conduct it remains to be seen ; but, in any event, kitchens of this kind cannot fail to be of great advantage to multitudes in moderate circumstances, who have hitherto been unable to buy good, nutritious, and tasteful cooked food.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Rumford Kitchen ===
[[File:CountRumfordFrontispiece.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Count Rumford]] frontispiece of the Rumford Kitchen leaflets]]
In 1893, when Richards was in charge of the Rumford Kitchen at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|World's Fair in Chicago]], she accepted the added work and responsibility of arranging an exhibition of the work of Studies at Home.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

The opening statement of the ''Guide to the Rumford Kitchen: An Exhibit made by the State of Massachusetts in connection with the Bureau of Hygiene and Sanitation'' ([[World's Columbian Exposition]], Chicago, 1893) by General [[Francis Amasa Walker|Francis A. Walker]] explains:&lt;ref name="RumfordKitchen"&gt;{{cite book | last = Richards | first = Ellen H.  | title = Plain words about food: the Rumford kitchen leaflets, 1899. | publisher = Rockwell and Churchill Press | edition = 1st | location = Boston | year = 1899 | isbn = | lccn = | url = http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/2936825?n=1&amp;imagesize=1200&amp;jp2Res=.5&amp;printThumbnails=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The exhibit known as the Rumford Kitchen is the outgrowth of the work, in the application of the principles of chemistry to the science of cooking, which has for three years been carried on as an educational agency by Mrs. Robert H. Richards and Mrs. Dr. John J. Abel, with pecuniary assistance from certain public-spirited citizens of Boston.

The Massachusetts Board of World's Fair Managers, ... believing that such practical demonstration of the usefulness of domestic science could not fail to be of advantage to multitudes of visitors to the Columbian Exposition, have invited the ladies named to open the Rumford Kitchen as a part of the exhibit of Massachusetts in connection with the Bureau of Hygiene and Sanitation.

In order to reduce, in some degree, the expenses of this exhibit, the food cooked in the Rumford Kitchen will be sold under a concession from the administration of the Exposition ; but it should be understood that this is not a money-making exhibit ; that nothing is cooked for the sake of being sold ; and that the enterprise is to be regarded as absolutely a scientific and educational one.

The purpose of the exhibit in the Rumford Kitchen is two-fold : First, to commemorate the services to the cause of domestic science rendered by [[Count Rumford]] one hundred years ago[;] ... second, to serve as an incentive to further work in the same direction, as he expressed it," to provoke men to investigation," "to cause doubt, that first step toward knowledge."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first commercially available "modern" [[Rumford fireplace|kitchen ranges]] began to appear about 1800, they were the invention of an American named Sir Benjamin Thompson, [[Benjamin Thompson|Count von Rumford]].

=== American Public School Lunch Program ===
A first, major program was started in some Boston high schools in 1894 to provide nutritional meals at low prices to children who would not normally have them. Due in large part to Ellen Richards and [[Edward Atkinson (activist)|Edward Atkinson]], the New England Kitchen ran the program as a 'private enterprise' that paid for itself many times over. The lunches never became effective instruments for teaching the New Nutrition the founders had envisaged. But, because the program provided nutritious meals children would otherwise not have, it became the main justification for similar lunch programs in other cities."&lt;ref name="Levenstein"&gt;{{cite book | last = Levenstein | first = Harvey | title = Revolution at the Table: The Transformation of the American Diet | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | edition = | location = New York | year = 1988 | page = 116 | isbn =  | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed into law the [[National School Lunch Program]] to provide low-cost or free [[School meal|school lunch meals]] to qualified students through subsidies to schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://federaleducationpolicy.wordpress.com/2011/02/19/1946-national-school-lunch-act/ Copy of the School Lunch Act As Enacted in 1946], Federal Education Policy History website&lt;/ref&gt; The program was established as a way to prop up food prices by absorbing farm surpluses, while at the same time providing food to school age children. It was named after Richard Russell, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/Lunch/AboutLunch/ProgramHistory_4.htm The National School Lunch Program Background and Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lake Placid Conference ===
Early in September, 1899, trustees of the [[Lake Placid Club]] (Morningside, New York) thought it was the right time to bring together those most interested in home science, or household economics and sent out many invitations for the Lake Placid Conference scheduled to take place Sept. 19-25, 1899. [[Melvil Dewey]], one of the club's trustees, personally invited Richards to attend.  She gave a lecture on standards of living and was elected chairman of the conference.&lt;ref name="LakePlacidConference"&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Richards | editor-first = Ellen H. | title = Lake Placid Conference proceedings | series = Lake Placid Conference | year = 1901–1908 | pages =  | place = Lake Placid, NY | publisher = American Home Economics Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Home Economics Association ===
In 1908, Richards was chosen as the first president of the newly formed American Home Economics Association, which was renamed the [[American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences]] in 1994. She also founded and funded the Association's periodical, the ''Journal of Home Economics'', which began publication in 1909. It was renamed the ''Journal of Family and Consumer Sciences'' in 1994 when the Association changed its name.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

Her books and writings on this topic include ''Food Materials and their Adulterations'' (1886); ''Conservation by Sanitation''; ''The Chemistry of Cooking and Cleaning''; ''The Cost of Living'' (1899); ''Air, Water, and Food'' (1900); ''The Cost of Food''; ''The Cost of Shelter''; ''The Art of Right Living''; ''The Cost of Cleanness''; ''Sanitation in Daily Life'' (1907); and ''[[Euthenics]], the Science of Controllable Environment'' (1910). Some of these went through several editions.

== Death ==
Richards died on March 30, 1911 at her home in [[Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts]] after suffering with [[angina]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Mrs. Ellen H.

[[File:TreinTramwielprofiel.svg|thumb|Railway wheel [[Train wheel#Flange|flange]] (left)&lt;br /&gt;Tram wheel flange (right)]]
[[File:Flanged wheel.jpg|thumb|[[Train wheel#Flange|Flanged]] [[Train wheel|railway wheel]]]]
A '''flange''' is an   external or internal [[Ridge (disambiguation)|ridge]], or [[Rim (wheel)|rim]] (lip), for [[Shear strength|strength]], as the flange of an [[iron]] [[Beam (structure)|beam]] such as an [[I-beam]] or a [[T-beam]]; or for attachment to another object, as the flange on the end of a pipe, steam cylinder, etc., or on the [[lens mount]] of a [[camera]]; or for a flange of a [[Railroad car|rail car]] or [[tram]] [[train wheel|wheel]]. Thus  flanged wheels are wheels with a flange on one side to keep the wheels from running off the [[Rail profile|rails]]. The term "flange" is also used for a kind of tool used to form flanges.  [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|Pipes]] with flanges can be assembled and disassembled easily.

== Plumbing or piping ==
{{Main|plumbing|piping}}
[[File:SurreyFlange.JPG|thumb|right|Surrey flange]]

A flange can also be a plate or ring to form a rim at the end of a pipe when fastened to the pipe (for example, a [[closet flange]]). A blind flange is a plate for covering or closing the end of a pipe. A flange joint is a connection of pipes, where the connecting pieces have flanges by which the parts are bolted together.

Although the word flange generally refers to the actual raised rim or lip of a fitting, many flanged plumbing fittings are themselves known as 'flanges':

Common flanges used in plumbing are the Surrey flange or Danzey flange, York flange, Sussex flange and Essex flange.
Surrey and York flanges fit to the top of the hot water tank allowing all the water to be taken without disturbance to the tank. They are often used to ensure an even flow of water to showers. An Essex flange requires a hole to be drilled in the side of the tank.

There is also a Warix flange which is the same as a York flange but the shower output is on the top of the flange and the vent on the side. The York and Warix flange have female adapters so that they fit onto a male tank, whereas the Surrey flange connects to a female tank.

A [[closet flange]] provides the mount for a [[toilet]].

== Pipe flanges ==
There are many different flange standards to be found worldwide. To allow easy functionality and interchangeability, these are designed to have standardised dimensions. Common world standards include ASA/ASME (USA), PN/DIN (European), BS10 (British/Australian), and JIS/KS (Japanese/Korean).  In the USA, ANSI stopped publishing B16.5 in 1996, and the standard is ASME B16.5 

In most cases these are interchangeable as most local standards have been aligned to ISO standards, however some local standards still differ (e.g. an ASME flange will not mate against an ISO flange). Further, many of the flanges in each standard are divided into "pressure classes", allowing flanges to be capable of taking different pressure ratings. Again these are not generally interchangeable (e.g. an ASME 150 will not mate with an ASME 300).&lt;ref name=B165&gt;ASME B16.5&lt;/ref&gt;

These pressure classes also have differing [[pressure]] and [[temperature]] ratings for different materials. Unique pressure classes for piping can also  be developed for a process plant or power generating station; these may be specific to the corporation, engineering procurement and construction (EPC) contractor, or the process plant owner.  The ASME pressure classes for Flat-Face flanges are Class 125 and Class 250.  The classes for Ring-Joint, Tongue &amp; Groove, and Raised-Face flanges are Class 150, Class 300, (Class 400 - unusual), Class 600, Class 900, Class 1500, and Class 2500.&lt;ref name=B165 /&gt;

The flange faces are also made to standardized dimensions and are typically "flat face", "raised face", "[[Groove (machining)|tongue and groove]]", or "[[Gland (engineering)|ring joint]]" styles, although other obscure styles are possible.

Flange designs are available as "[[Weld neck flange|weld neck]]", "slip-on", "lap joint", "socket weld", "[[Threaded pipe|threaded]]", and also "blind".&lt;ref name=B165 /&gt;

=== ASME standards (U.S.) ===
[[File:Flanschverbindung Gasleitung.jpg|thumb|300px|right|ASME type flange on a gas pipeline]]

Pipe flanges that are made to standards called out by [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]] B16.5 or ASME B16.47, and MSS SP-44. They are typically made from forged materials and have machined surfaces. ASME B16.5 refers to [[nominal pipe size]]s (NPS) from ½" to 24". B16.47 covers NPSs from 26" to 60". Each specification further delineates flanges into [[pressure]] classes: 150, 300, 400, 600, 900, 1500 and 2500 for B16.5, and  B16.47 delineates its flanges into pressure classes 75, 150, 300, 400, 600, 900.  However these classes do not correspond to maximum pressures in [[Pounds per square inch|psi]].  Instead, the maximum pressure depends on the material of the flange and the temperature.  For example, the maximum pressure for a Class 150 flange is 285 psi, and for a Class 300 Flange it is 740 psi (both are for ASTM A105 Carbon Steel and temperatures below 100F).

The [[gasket]] type and [[Screw|bolt]] type are generally specified by the standard(s); however, sometimes the standards refer to the ASME [[Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code]] (B&amp;PVC) for details (see ASME Code Section VIII Division 1 – Appendix 2). These flanges are recognized by ASME Pipe Codes such as ASME B31.1 Power Piping, and ASME B31.3 Process Piping.

Materials for flanges are usually under ASME designation: SA-105 (Specification for Carbon Steel Forgings for Piping Applications), SA-266 (Specification for Carbon Steel Forgings for Pressure Vessel Components), or SA-182 (Specification for Forged or Rolled Alloy-Steel Pipe Flanges, Forged Fittings, and Valves and Parts for High-Temperature Service). In addition, there are many "industry standard" flanges that in some circumstance may be used on ASME work.

The product range includes SORF, SOFF, BLRF, BLFF, WNRF (XS, XXS, STD &amp; Schedule 20, 40, 80), WNFF (XS, XXS, STD &amp; Schedule 20, 40, 80), SWRF (XS &amp; STD), SWFF (XS &amp; STD), Threaded RF, Threaded FF &amp; LJ, with sizes from 1/2" to 16". The bolting material used for flange connection is [[Threaded rod|stud bolts]] mated with two nut (washer when required). In Petrochemical industries, ASTM A193 B7 STUD &amp; ASTM A193 B16 Stud Bolts are used as these have high tensile strength.

=== European Dimensions EN / DIN ===
Most countries in Europe mainly install flanges according to standard DIN EN 1092-1 (forged Stainless or Steel Flanges). Similar to the ASME flange standard, the EN 1092-1 standard has the basic flange forms, such as weld neck flange, blind flange, lapped flange, threaded Flange (Thread ISO7-1 instead of NPT), weld on collar, pressed collars, and adapter flange such as flange coupling GD pressfittings. The different forms of flanges within the EN 1092-1 (European Norm Euronorm) is indicated within the flange name through the type.

=== Other countries ===
Flanges in the rest of the world are manufactured according to the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards for materials, pressure ratings, etc. to which local standards including [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]], [[British Standards|BS]].... have been aligned.

== Compact flanges ==
As the Compact flange size increase it becomes relatively increasingly heavy and complex resulting in high procurement, installation and maintenance costs.
Large flange diameters in particular are difficult to work with, and inevitably require more space and have a more challenging handling and installation procedure, particularly on remote installations such as oil rigs.

The principal design of the flange face includes two independent seals. The first seal is created by application of seal seating stress at the flange heel, but it is not straight forward to ensure the function of this seal.

Theoretically, the heel contact will be maintained for pressure values up to 1,8 times the flange rating at room temperature.

Theoretically, the flange also remains in contact along its outer circumference at the flange faces for all allowable load levels that it is designed for.

The main seal is the IX seal ring. The seal ring force is provided by the elastic stored energy in the stressed seal ring. Any heel leakage will give internal pressure acting on the seal ring inside intensifying the sealing action. This however requires the IX ring to be retained in the theoretical location in the ring groove which is difficult to ensure and verify during installation.

The design aims at preventing exposure to oxygen and other corrosive agents. Thus, this prevents corrosion of the flange faces, the stressed length of the bolts and the seal ring. This however depends on the outer dust rim to remain in satisfactory contact and that the inside fluid is not corrosive in case of leaking into the bolt circle void.

=== Applications of compact flanges ===
The initial cost of the theoretical higher performance compact flange is inevitably higher than a regular flange due to the closer tolerances and significantly more sophisticated design and installation requirements.
By way of example, compact flanges are often used across the following applications: subsea oil and gas or riser, cold work and [[cryogenics]], gas injection, high temperature, and nuclear applications.

== Train wheels ==
{{Main|train wheel}}

Trains stay on their tracks primarily due to the conical geometry of their wheels. They also have a flange on one side to keep the wheels, and hence the train, running on the rails, when the limits of the geometry based alignment are reached, e.g. due to some emergency or defect.

== Vacuum flanges ==
{{Main|vacuum flange}}
A vacuum flange is a flange at the end of a tube used to connect vacuum chambers, tubing and vacuum pumps to each other.

[[File:pdr-cbr-flange.jpg|thumb|right|Form factor of PDR and CBR flanges.]]

== Microwave ==
{{Main|Waveguide flange}}
In [[microwave]] [[telecommunication]]s, a flange is a type of cable joint which allows different types of [[waveguide]] to connect.

Several different [[waveguide flange|microwave RF flange]] types exist, such as CAR, CBR, OPC, PAR, PBJ, PBR, PDR, UAR, UBR, UDR, icp and UPX.

== Ski boots ==
[[File:Salomon Divine RS CF.JPG|thumb|right|The extensions at the toe and heel of this ski boot produce flanges used to clip into the ski bindings.]]

[[Ski boot]]s use flanges at the toe or heel to connect to the binding of the ski.  The size and shape for flanges on [[alpine skiing]] boots is standardized in ISO 5355. Traditional [[Telemark skiing|telemark]] and [[cross country skiing|cross country]] boots use the 75&amp;nbsp;mm Nordic Norm, but the toe flange is informally known as the "duckbill". New cross country bindings eliminate the flange entirely and use a steel bar embedded within the sole instead.

A '''footprint''' or '''land pattern''' is the arrangement of [[Contact pad|pads]] (in [[surface-mount technology]]) or through-holes (in [[through-hole technology]]) used to physically attach and electrically connect a component to a [[printed circuit board]].&lt;ref name="ipc7351"&gt;{{cite book | title=IPC-7351 - Generic Requirements for Surface Mount Design and Land Pattern Standard | publisher=IPC | year=2005 | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land pattern on a circuit board matches the arrangement of [[Lead (electronics)|leads]] on a component.

Component manufacturers often produce multiple [[Pin compatibility|pin-compatible]] product variants to allow [[Systems integrator|systems integrators]] to change the exact component in use without changing the footprint on the circuit board. This can provide large cost savings for integrators, especially with dense [[Ball Grid Array|BGA]] components where the footprint pads may be connected to multiple [[Printed circuit board#Lamination|layers]] of the circuit board.

'''Forensic toxicology''' is the use of [[toxicology]] and other disciplines such as [[analytical chemistry]], [[pharmacology]] and [[clinical chemistry]] to aid medical or legal investigation of death, poisoning, and drug use. The primary concern for forensic toxicology is not the legal outcome of the toxicological investigation or the technology utilized, but rather the obtainment and interpretation of results. 
A toxicological analysis can be done to various kinds of samples.
A forensic toxicologist must consider the context of an investigation, in particular any physical symptoms recorded, and any evidence collected at a crime scene that may narrow the search, such as pill bottles, powders, trace residue, and any available chemicals. Provided with this information and samples with which to work, the forensic toxicologist must determine which toxic substances are present, in what concentrations, and the probable effect of those chemicals on the person.

Determining the substance ingested is often complicated by the body's natural processes (see [[ADME]]), as it is rare for a chemical to remain in its original form once in the body. For example: [[heroin]] is almost immediately [[metabolism|metabolised]] into another substance and further to [[morphine]], making detailed investigation into factors such as injection marks and chemical purity necessary to confirm diagnosis. The substance may also have been diluted by its dispersal through the body; while a pill or other regulated dose of a drug may have grams or [[milligrams]] of the active constituent, an individual sample under investigation may only contain [[microgram]]s or [[nanogram]]s.

==Examples==

===Urine===
A [[urine]] sample is urine that has come from the bladder and can be provided or taken post-mortem. Urine is less likely to be infected with viruses such as HIV or Hepatitis B than blood samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dinis-Oliveira|first=R|author2=Carvalho, F. F. |author3=Duarte, J. A. |author4=Remião, F. F. |author5=Marques, A. A. |author6=Santos, A. A. |author7=Magalhães, T. T |title=Collection of biological samples in forensic toxicology|journal=Toxicology Mechanisms &amp; Methods|year=2010|volume=20|issue=7|pages=363–414|doi=10.3109/15376516.2010.497976}}&lt;!--|accessdate=4 May 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many drugs have a higher concentration and can remain for much longer in urine than blood. Collection of urine samples can be taken in a noninvasive way which does not require professionals for collection. Urine is used for qualitative analysis as it cannot give any indication of impairment due to the fact that drug presence in urine only indicates prior exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=Barry|title=Forensic Toxicology|journal=Analytical Chemistry|date=1 March 1993|volume=65|issue=5|doi=10.1021/ac00053a003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blood===
A blood sample of approximately {{convert|10|ml|2|abbr=on}} is usually sufficient to screen and confirm most common toxic substances. A blood sample provides the toxicologist with a profile of the substance that the subject was influenced by at the time of collection; for this reason, it is the sample of choice for measuring [[blood alcohol content]] in [[drunk driving]] cases.

===Hair sample===
Hair is capable of recording medium to long-term or high dosage substance abuse. Chemicals in the bloodstream may be transferred to the growing hair and stored in the [[hair follicle|follicle]], providing a rough [[Chronology|timeline]] of drug intake events. Head hair grows at rate of approximately 1 to 1.5&amp;nbsp;cm a month, and so cross sections from different sections of the follicle can give estimates as to when a substance was ingested. Testing for drugs in hair is not standard throughout the population. The darker and coarser the hair the more drug that will be found in the hair. If two people consumed the same amount of drugs, the person with the darker and coarser hair will have more drug in their hair than the lighter haired person when tested. This raises issues of possible racial bias in substance tests with hair samples.&lt;ref name="Mieczkowski"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://criminology.fsu.edu/journal/mismeasure.pdf |title=The Further Mismeasure: The Curious Use of Racial Categorizations in the Interpretation of Hair Analyses |first=Tom |last=Mieczkowski |work=Paper presented at the American Society of Criminology Meetings, November 1999, Toronto, Ontario, Canada |year=1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508045755/http://www.criminology.fsu.edu/journal/mismeasure.pdf |archivedate=2007-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
Other bodily fluids and organs may provide samples, particularly samples collected during an [[autopsy]]. A common autopsy sample is the [[gastric content]]s of the deceased, which can be useful for detecting undigested pills or liquids that were ingested prior to death. In highly decomposed bodies, traditional samples may no longer be available. The [[vitreous humour]] from the eye may be used, as the fibrous layer of the eyeball and the eye socket of the skull protects the sample from trauma and adulteration. Other common organs used for toxicology are the brain, liver, and spleen.

The inspection of the contents of the stomach must be part of every postmortem examination if possible because it may provide qualitative information concerning the nature of the last meal and the presence of abnormal constituents. Using it as a guide to the time of death, however, is theoretically unsound and presents many practical difficulties, although it may have limited applicability in some exceptional instances. Generally, using stomach contents as a guide to time of death involves an unacceptable degree of imprecision and is thus liable to mislead the investigator and the court.
Characteristic cell types from food plants can be used to identify a victim's last meal; knowledge about which can be useful in determining the victim's whereabouts or actions prior to death (Bock and Norris, 1997). Some of these cell types include (Dickison, 2000):
* sclereids (pears)
* starch grains (potatoes and other tubers)
* [[raphide]] crystals (pineapple)
* [[druse (botany)|druse]] crystals (citrus, beets, spinach)
* silica bodies (cereal grasses and bamboos)
In a case where a young woman had been stabbed to death, witnesses reported that she had eaten her last meal at a particular fast food restaurant. However, her stomach contents did not match the limited menu of the restaurant, leading investigators to conclude that she had eaten at some point after being seen in the restaurant. The investigation led to the apprehension of a man whom the victim knew, and with whom she had shared her actual final meal (Dickison, 2000).
Time since death can be approximated by the state of digestion of the stomach contents. It normally takes at least a couple of hours for food to pass from the stomach to the small intestine; a meal still largely in the stomach implies death shortly after eating, while an empty or nearly-empty stomach suggests a longer time period between eating and death (Batten, 1995). However, there are numerous mitigating factors to take into account: the extent to which the food had been chewed, the amount of fat and protein present, physical activity undertaken by the victim prior to death, mood of the victim, physiological variation from person to person. All these factors affect the rate at which food passes through the digestive tract. Pathologists are generally hesitant to base a precise time of death on the evidence of stomach contents alone.

===Other organisms===
Bacteria, [[maggots]] and other organisms that may have ingested some subject matter may have also ingested any toxic substance within it.

==Detection and classification==
Detection of drugs and pharmaceuticals in biological samples is usually done by an initial screening and then a confirmation of the compound(s), which may include a quantitation of the compound(s). The screening and confirmation are usually, but not necessarily, done with different analytical methods. Every analytical method used in forensic toxicology should be carefully tested by performing a validation of the method to ensure correct and indisputable results at all times. A testing laboratory involved in forensic toxicology should adhere to a quality programme to ensure the best possible results and safety of any individual.

The choice of method for testing is highly dependent on what kind of substance one expects to find and the material on which the testing is performed. Biological samples are more complex to analyze because of factors such as the [[matrix effect]] and the metabolism and conjugation of the target compounds.

===Gas chromatography===
[[Gas-liquid chromatography]] is of particular use in examining volatile [[organic compound]]s.

===Detection of metals===
The compounds suspected of containing a metal are traditionally analyzed by the destruction of the organic matrix by chemical or thermal oxidation. This leaves the metal to be identified and quantified in the inorganic residue, and it can be detected using such methods as the [[Reinsch test]], emission [[spectroscopy]] or [[X-ray diffraction]]. Unfortunately, while this identifies the metals present it removes the original compound, and so hinders efforts to determine what may have been ingested. The [[Toxicity|toxic effects]] of various metallic compounds can vary considerably.

===Nonvolatile organic substances===
Drugs, both prescribed and illicit, [[pesticide]]s, natural products, [[pollutant]]s and industrial compounds are some of the most common nonvolatile compounds encountered. Screening methods include [[thin-layer chromatography]], [[gas-liquid chromatography]] and immunoassay. For complete legal identification, a second confirmatory test is usually also required. The trend today is to use liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, preceded with sample workup as liquid-liquid extraction or solid phase extraction. Older methods include:  [[spot test]] (see [[Pill testing]]), typically the [[Marquis reagent|Marquis Reagent]], [[Mecke Reagent]], and [[Froehde's reagent]] for [[opiates]], [[Marquis reagent|Marquis Reagent]] and [[Simon's reagent]] for [[amphetamine]], [[methamphetamine]] and other analogs, like [[MDMA]], the [[Scott's test]] for cocaine, and the modified [[Duquenois-Levine reagent|Duquenois]] reagent for [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and other [[cannabinoids]]. For compounds that don't have a common spot test, like [[benzodiazepines]], another test may be used, typically [[mass spectrometry]], or [[spectrophotometry]].

The '''Fort de Châtillon''' was a fortification located about {{convert|5|km|mi}} south of [[Paris]] in the communes of [[Châtillon (Hauts-de-Seine)|Châtillon-sous-Bagneux]] and [[Fontenay-aux-Roses]]. It was built in 1874 and was razed beginning in 1957, making way for expansion of the French nuclear research facility at Fontenay-aux-Roses.

The fort was named for the town it was designed to protect, Châtillon-sous-Bagneux, but the greater portion of the site is actually within Fontenay-aux-Roses. The main entry and the portions in Châtillon were destroyed at the end of the [[Second World War]].

== History ==
The site was first fortified during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870, when the redoubt of Châtillon was built by the inhabitants of the town. The works allowed the French to slow the Prussian advance on the capital and was the scene of violent combat. After the war the site was selected for further fortification as part of the [[Séré de Rivières system]] ring of fortifications around Paris. Construction on the new pentagonal fort started in 1874, not far from the old redoubt. Unlike other Parisian fortifications, the new fort was designed for action in all directions, as the location commanded much of the surrounding region.  The barracks, believed to have been in three levels, were located at the center, surrounded by walls defended by a ditch and [[caponier]]s. The fort featured a number of internal traverses, mounded dikes intended as shelters against low-angle shellfire from a variety of directions.&lt;ref name="fortiffbe1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortiff.be/iff/index.php?p=1046|title=Châtillon (fort de)|last=Puelinckx|first=Jean |author2=Aublet, Jean-Louis |author3=Mainguin, Sylvie|year=2010|work=Index de la fortification française 1874-1914|publisher=fortiff.be|language=French|accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearby was the ''Coupure de Châtillon'', a fortified ditch about {{convert|150|m|ft}} to the northeast of the Fort de Châtillon, defended by artillery batteries. With the Fort de Châtillon, the defenses denied the use of the Châtillon hill to an enemy who might dominate the nearby Forts de [[Fort de Montrouge|Montrouge]], [[Fort d'Issy|Issy]] and [[Fort de Vanves|Vanves]]. The ''coupure'' consisted of eighteen traverses covered by artillery and defended by [[caponier]]s in the ditch. The entire fortification has vanished with the encroachment of urbanization.&lt;ref name="fortiffbe2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortiff.be/iff/index.php?p=1045|title=Châtillon (coupure de)|last=Puelinckx|first=Jean |author2=Aublet, Jean-Louis |author3=Mainguin, Sylvie|year=2010|work=Index de la fortification française 1874-1914|publisher=fortiff.be|language=French|accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fort saw no particular action during the Second World War. After the [[French Liberation]], convicted collaborators  [[Joseph Darnand]] and [[Jean Hérold-Paquis]] were executed by firing squad at the fort.&lt;ref name="CRD1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clg-doisneau-gonesse.ac-versailles.fr/spip.php?article284|title=Nazis et collaborateurs devant leurs juges|year=2009|publisher=Collège Robert Doisneau de Gonesse|language=French|accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TWAW1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schudak.de/timelines/france-theaftermathofliberation1945-1998.html|title=FRANCE&amp;nbsp;— The Aftermath of Liberation Timeline|publisher=The World at War|accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war the fort changed vocation to serve the [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique]], the French atomic energy agency (CEA), and was the site of [[Zoé (reactor)|Zoé]], the first French nuclear reactor.&lt;ref name="fortiffbe1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cia1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Office of Scientific Intelligence|date=13 November 1959|title=TheFrench Nuclear Weapons Program|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/wizards/osi_pdf/the_french_nu.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Châtillon site was quickly superseded by a new atomic research facility at Saclay, which opened in 1952.

== Centre d'Études Nucléaires de Fontenay-aux-Roses (CEN-FAR) ==
In 1957 the Fort de Châtillon changed its name to the ''Centre d'Études Nucléaires de Fontenay-aux-Roses''. Only the entry and some buildings of the old fort were saved.  The rest was demolished between 1957 and 1970. From 1974 the site housed a [[tokamak]] fusion reactor prototype, the [[Tokamak de Fontenay aux Roses|TFR]]. It became difficult to maintain such activities in the densely populated area, and Zoé was shut down in 1977.  The site became more oriented to other areas of nuclear research, particularly in the areas of radiation protection and nuclear waste management. The site also accommodates administrative services of the CEA. A 1996 fire in the administration building precipitated a change in use. A portion of the building that housed Zoé became the Museum of the Atom, while the remainder was dedicated to research into the life sciences.&lt;ref name="CEA1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-dsv.cea.fr/dsv/le-centre-de-fontenay-aux-roses/actualites/une-cli-pour-accompagner-la-denuclearisation-du-site|title=Une CLI pour accompagner la dénucléarisation du site |publisher=CEA|language=French|accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CEA2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-dsv.cea.fr/dsv/le-centre-de-fontenay-aux-roses/actions-pedagogiques/les-enfants-du-patrimoine-br-venez-visiter-zoe|title=Les Enfants du patrimoine: venez visiter Zoé ! |date=20 August 2009|publisher=CEA|language=French|accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several buildings on the site remain dedicated to the  ''Autorité de Sûreté Nucléaire'' (Nuclear Safety Authority) (ASN) and the ''[[Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire|Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire]]'' (Institute for Protection and Safety against Nuclear Radiation) (IRSN). The site is no longer spoken of as the "Fort" or "Annex", but as CEN-FAR or IRSN Fontenay-aux-Roses.

== Other Forts de Châtillon ==
Other Forts de Châtillon include one at [[Châtillon-le-Duc]] near  [[Besançon]], as well as a Fort de Châtillon at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] built in the 16th century.

In [[mathematics]], a '''higher spin alternating sign matrix''' is a generalisation of the [[alternating sign matrix]] ('''ASM'''), where the columns and rows sum to an integer ''r'' (the ''spin'') rather than simply summing to 1 as in the usual alternating sign matrix definition. HSASMs are square matrices whose elements may be integers in the range &amp;minus;''r'' to +''r''. When traversing any row or column of an ASM or HSASM, the partial sum of its entries must always be non-negative.&lt;ref name="ecomjournal"&gt;[http://www.combinatorics.org/Volume_14/PDF/v14i1r83.pdf R. E. Behrend and V. A. Knight, "Higher Spin Alternating Sign Matrices", ""The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics"", '''14''' (2007), #R83]&lt;/ref&gt;

High spin ASMs have found application in [[statistical mechanics]] and [[physics]], where they have been found to represent [[symmetry group]]s in [[ice crystal]] formation.

Some typical examples of HSASMs are shown below:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 2 &amp;-1 &amp; 1 \\
 2 &amp;-1 &amp; 2 &amp;-1 \\
 0 &amp; 1 &amp;-1 &amp; 2 
\end{pmatrix};\quad
\begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0&amp;0 \\
 0 &amp; 1 &amp;-1 &amp; 2 &amp;0\\
 2 &amp;-1 &amp;-1 &amp; 0 &amp;2\\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp;0\\
0&amp;2&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0
\end{pmatrix};\quad
\begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\
 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 2 &amp;-2 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix};\quad
\begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\
 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 
\end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The set of HSASMs is a [[superset]] of the ASMs. The [[extreme points]] of the [[convex hull]] of the set of ''r''-spin HSASMs are themselves integer multiples of the usual ASMs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5487">[[File:Human Immunodeficency Virus - stylized rendering.jpg |thumb|The human immunodeficiency viruses (both HIV1 and HIV2) exhibited evolutionary switches from non-human primates to humans.]]

In [[parasitology]] and [[epidemiology]], a '''host switch''' (or '''host shift''') is an evolutionary change of host specificity. All [[symbiotic]] species, such as [[parasites]], [[pathogens]] and [[mutualists]] exhibit a certain degree of host specificity. They occur in the body (or on the body surface) of a single host species or – more often – on a limited set of host species. In the latter case, the suitable host species tend to be taxonomically related, sharing similar morphology and physiology.&lt;ref&gt;Poulin, R. (2006) [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8336.html Evolutionary Ecology of Parasites] ''Princeton University Press''&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] used to occur in non-human primates in West-central Africa, and have switched to humans in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=Orgin2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharp PM, Hahn BH | title = Origins of HIV and the AIDS Pandemic | journal = Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = a006841 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22229120 | pmc = 3234451 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a006841 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Faria2014&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Faria NR, Rambaut A, Suchard MA, Baele G, Bedford T, Ward MJ, Tatem AJ, Sousa JD, Arinaminpathy N, Pépin J, Posada D, Peeters M, Pybus OG, Lemey P | title = The early spread and epidemic ignition of HIV-1 in human populations | journal = Science | volume = 346 | issue = 6205 | pages = 56–61 | year = 2014 | doi = 10.1126/science.1256739 | pmid=25278604 | pmc=4254776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Switch&amp;shift.png|thumb|A host area (green) withdrawing in the South and advancing forward in the North. Cylinders represent host populations with a stable or changing population size. Parasite populations are represented by red arrows. Host switch more often occurs targeting host populations of increasing size, such as the pioneer populations of an [[invasive species]] (above). Contrarily, host shift more often occurs to move away from shrinking host populations, such as [[Relict (biology)|relict]] populations left behind by a regressing host area (below).&lt;ref name=chapter2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=FB-EE /&gt;]]

Recent studies proposed to discriminate between two different types of evolutionary changes in host specificity.&lt;ref name=chapter2015&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Rozsa|first1=L|last2=Tryjanowski|first2=P |last3=Vas|first3=Z|year=2015|chapter-url=http://www.zoologia.hu/list/chapter4.pdf|chapter= Under the changing climate: how shifting geographic distributions and sexual selection shape parasite diversification|title=Parasite diversity and diversification: evolutionary ecology meets phylogenetics|editor=Morand S |editor2=Krasnov B |editor3=Littlewood T (eds.) |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781107037656|pages=58–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FB-EE&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Forró B, Eszterbauer E | url=http://folia.paru.cas.cz/pdfs/fol/2016/01/19.pdf | title = Correlation between host specificity and genetic diversity for the muscle-dwelling fish parasite Myxobolus pseudodispar: examples of myxozoan host-shift? | journal = Folia Parasitologica | volume = 63 | pages = 019 | year = 2016 | doi = 10.14411/fp.2016.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this view, host switch is a sudden and accidental colonization of a new host species by a few parasite individuals that are capable to establish a new and viable population there. After the switch, the new population is more-or-less isolated from the parasite population on the donor host species. It does not affect the further fate of the conspecific parasites on the donor host, and it may finally lead to parasite speciation. It is more likely to target an increasing host population that harbours a relatively poor parasite/pathogen fauna, such as the pioneer populations of invasive species.

Contrarily, host-shift is a gradual change of the relative role of a particular host species as primary versus secondary host, in case of a multi-host parasite species. The former primary host slowly becomes a secondary host or even becomes totally abandoned, while the former secondary host becomes a new primary host species. This process is slower and more predictable, and it does not increase parasite diversity. Predictably, it more often occurs in shrinking host populations that harbours a relatively (considering the small host population size) rich parasite/pathogen fauna.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6474">'''IGNITOR''' is the Italian name for a nuclear research project of [[magnetic confinement fusion]], developed by [[ENEA (Italy)|ENEA]] Laboratories in [[Frascati]]. Construction (in Russia) is not complete.

The project theory is based on ignited plasma in [[tokamak]]. Started in 1977 by Prof. [[Bruno Coppi]] of [[MIT]], IGNITOR is based on the 1970s [[Alcator]] machine at MIT which pioneered the high magnetic field approach to plasma magnetic confinement, continued with the [[Alcator C-Mod|Alcator C/C-Mod]] at MIT and the [[FT/FTU]] series of experiments.  

Compared to the [[ITER]] international project, IGNITOR would be much smaller and cheaper: the ITER reactor is 19,000 tons{{vague|which tons?|date=January 2010}} in weight while the IGNITOR is only 500 tons in weight. IGNITOR is designed to produce approximately 100 [[Megawatt|MW]] of fusion power (and ITER to produce ~500 MW fusion power).

==Development==
At a meeting with the scientific attachés of the European embassies in Moscow in early February 2010 [[Mikhail Kovalchuk]], Director of the [[Kurchatov Institute]],  announced that an initiative aimed at developing a fast paced joint research programme in nuclear fusion research was strongly supported by the Governments of Russia and Italy.

The original proposal had been initiated earlier by [[Evgeny Velikhov]] (President of the Kurchatov Institute) and Bruno Coppi (Head of the High Energy Plasmas Undertaking, MIT) during the early developments of the [[Alcator C-Mod]] programme at MIT, where well known scientists of the Kurchatov Institute made key contributions to experiments that identified the unique confinement and purity properties of the high density plasmas produced by the high field Alcator machine. In effects this investigated, for the first time, physical processes leading to attain self-sustained fusion burning plasmas.

The collaboration with the Kurchatov Institute is directed at the construction of the Ignitor machine, the first experiment proposed to achieve ignition conditions by nuclear fusion reactions on the basis of existing knowledge of plasma physics and available technologies. Ignitor is part of the line of research on high magnetic field, experiments producing high density plasmas that began with the Alcator and the Frascati Torus programs at MIT and in Italy, respectively. It remains, at the world level, the only experiment capable of reaching ignition by the magnetic field confinement approach. However, several fusion scientists have contested the claim made for IGNITOR that it is a bigger step towards fusion power than the international [[ITER]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
 | doi = 10.1038/news.2010.214
| title = Fusion reactor aims to rival ITER
| journal = Nature
| date = 2010
| last1 = Feresin | first1 = Emiliano 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to existing plans, Ignitor will be installed at the Triniti site at [[Troitsk, Moscow Oblast|Troitsk]] near Moscow that has facilities which can be upgraded to house and operate the machine. This site will become open and made to be easily accessible to scientists of all nations. The management of the relevant research programme will involve Italy and Russia only to facilitate the success of the enterprise. The proponents have suggested that the [[United States|US]] become an Associate Member of this effort with a similar arrangement to that made with [[CERN]] for its participation in the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] (Large Hadron Collider) Programme.

The goal to produce meaningful fusion reactors in a reasonable time leads to pursuing the achievement of ignition conditions in the near term in order to understand the plasma physical regimes needed for a net power producing reactor. In addition, an objective other than ignition that can be envisioned for the relatively near term is that of high flux neutron sources for material testing involving compact, high density fusion machines. This has been one of the incentives that have led the Ignitor Project to adopt [[magnesium diboride]] (MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) superconducting cables in the machine design, a first in fusion research. Accordingly, the largest coils (about 5 m diameter) of the machine will be made entirely of MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cables.

The ''' Industrial Heritage Association of Ireland''' ('''IHAI''') is an all-Ireland body set up in 1996 to foster a greater understanding and appreciation of sites, monuments and items of machinery that together constitute Ireland's industrial heritage and to encourage its protection by the relevant statutory authorities.&lt;ref name="bed"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ihai.ie/ | title=Industrial Heritage Association of Ireland website | publisher=IHAI | accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IHAI functions as a link between government organisations, NGOs, and individuals working in the field of industrial heritage. By providing opportunities for open discussion and debate the IHAI advances awareness, enjoyment, and conservation of the many facets of industrial heritage.

One of the main objectives of the IHAI is the establishment of a national inventory of industrial sites. To this end, the Heritage Council assisted by publishing ''Recording and Conserving Ireland’s Industrial Heritage: An Introductory Guide to help public bodies, professionals, voluntary organisations and site owners in the identification, recording, conservation and protection of industrial sites''.&lt;ref name="ham"&gt;{{cite book | title=Recording and Conserving Ireland’s Industrial Heritage: An Introductory Guide to help public bodies, professionals, voluntary organisations and site owners in the identification, recording, conservation and protection of industrial sites. | author1=Hammond F |author2= McMahon M| year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IHAI engages with the public through conferences, workshops, field tours, lectures and publications, special-interest societies, as well as government and non-governmental organisations. Their conferences have covered a range of topics and the papers presented have been published by the IHAI, the most recent being ''Archaeology of Irish Industry: Recent Excavations'' (2009). Other titles include ''The Industrial Heritage of North East Ireland'' (2002); ''Power from Steam'' (1998); and ''Taking Stock of Ireland’s Industrial Heritage'' (1998).

The IHAI produces a Newsletter three times a year chronicling the activities of the IHAI and the industrial heritage sector in Ireland generally. Past newsletters are available to the general public on the IHAI website and are a source of information on publications relating to aspects of Ireland’s industrial heritage.

[[File:Galerie Colbert.jpg|thumb|The INHA is located in the Colbert Gallery]]
The '''Institut national d'histoire de l'art''' (INHA; National Institute for Art History) is a French research institute, created and governed by Decree No. 2001-621 (July 12, 2001) and situated in [[Paris]].

The Institute develops scientific activity and contributes to international cooperation in most fields of [[art history]] and heritage by exercising research, training and knowledge-diffusion. It is located in the Galerie Colbert in Paris, which houses the Department of Education and Research and the Richelieu Quadrilateral Area. The latter's Labrouste Room houses the Department of Documentation, which holds collections from the Art and Archeology Library founded by [[Jacques Doucet (fashion designer)|Jacques Doucet]] in 1897 and donated in 1917 to the [[University of Paris]].

The INHA's mission is to promote international art historical research in all fields of the history of art. It pilots a large number of programs by gathering together university researchers and curators. It organises study days, symposiums, conferences and meeting-debates and develops different resources, documentary bases and research programs in art history. Each year, the INHA invites about sixty art historians, among them experienced researchers, academics, curators, art critics and doctoral students. Twice a year, the INHA publishes a scientific review on art history entitled ''Perspective''. Many documentary bases are to be found on the INHA's website.

The institute is located in Paris at 2, Rue Vivienne, in a former 17th century town house converted into a gallery in the 19th century. Its art history library, one of the largest in the world with more than {{formatnum:1700000}} documents, is located in the Labrouste room of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] at 58 rue de Richelieu.

The INHA provides access to external and internal online databases like [https://www.inha.fr/fr/ressources/outils-documentaires/acces-global-et-organise-aux-ressources-en-histoire-de-l-art-agorha.html AGORHA (''Accès global et organisé aux ressources en histoire de l’art'')] which allows several search modes in the different research fields of the INHA: [https://agorha.inha.fr/inhaprod/jsp/portal/index.jsp general search] (or use « ''Rechercher'' » in the bar), [https://www.inha.fr/_contents/ametys-internal%253Asites/inha/ametys-internal%253Acontents/montee-de-version-d-agorha-apercu-des-nouveautes-article/_metadata/content/_data/rBtOsQxW1GywhbJvoKIEvJX4xm3Abz_aOUdCDp3zTWGgSS41vm-XB6J2M1rCTzU33ZVZFIuNerUFNetDEetmaftLiJg7ZKS1Zb0ec2bdC99b9g3gFWlorw-em_EHOCzivIj3CF97 simple search], expert search and search by links, in particular in the RETIF ([https://agorha.inha.fr/inhaprod/ark:/54721/0014 ''répertoire des tableaux italiens dans les collections publiques françaises (XIIIe-XIXe siècles))''] which gives the {{formatnum:13761}} italian paintings held in French public collections.

{{Arab culture}}
The '''''Kitāb al-Hayawān''''' (كتاب الحيوان; English: ''Book of Animals'') is an [[Arabic]] translation in 19 treatises (''maqālāt'') of the following [[Aristotle's biology|zoological texts]] by [[Aristotle]]:

''[[History of Animals|Historia Animalium]]'' : treatises 1-10&lt;br /&gt;
''[[On the Parts of Animals|De Partibus Animalium]]'' : treatises 11-14&lt;br /&gt;
''[[Generation of Animals|De Generatione Animalium]]'' : treatises 15-19

While the book is often attributed to [[Yahya ibn al-Bitriq|Yahyà bin al-Bitrīq]], the translator is unknown. However, from certain oddities in the Arabic, it has been deduced that it is a translation of a lost [[Syriac language|Syriac]] version. The complete text is available only in [[manuscript]] form (in [[Tehran]]), but treatises 11-14 (''De Partibus'') have been edited as ''Ajzā’ al-hayawān (The Parts of Animals)''&lt;ref&gt;Edited by ‘Abd al-Rahmān al-Badawī. Kuwait: Wakālat al-matbū‘āt, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; and 15-19 (''De Generatione'') as ''Fī kawn al-hayawān (On the Being of Animals)''.&lt;ref&gt;''Fī kawn al-hayawān (On the Being of Animals)'' (Ed. J. Brugman and H.J. Drossaart Lulofs. Leiden: Brill, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in philosophy==
The first known mention of the book appears in a text by the [[Arab]] philosopher [[Al-Kindī]] (d. 850). Ibn Sīnā ([[Avicenna]]) seems to have had direct knowledge of the book, as he paraphrased and commented upon the full text in his encyclopedic [[The Book of Healing|Al-Shifā’]]. In Spain, the 12th-century philosopher Ibn Bājja ([[Avempace]]) wrote on ''De Partibus'' and ''De Generatione''. It has been remarked that one usually finds references to the ''Historia'' in the Eastern Islamicate world, while the other two books are generally referred to in the West, and in conformity to this pattern, Ibn Rushd ([[Averroes]]), like Ibn Bājja, wrote commentaries on ''De Partibus'' and ''De Generatione'' (see below), in which he criticizes Ibn Sīnā’s interpretations.

==References in zoography==
[[File:Al-Jahiz - pages from Kitaab al Hayawaan 3.jpg|thumb|Page from the Kitāb al-Hayawān by [[Al-Jahiz]].]]

''Kitāb al-hayawān'' was known at least indirectly to several important zoographers including [[Al-Jahiz|Al-Jāhiz]] (''Kitāb al-hayawān''), Al-Mas‘ūdī (''Murawwaj al-dhahab''), [[Al-Tawhidi|Abū Hayyān al-Tawhīdī]] (''Al-Imtā‘ wa al-mu’ānasa''), Al-Qazwīnī (''‘Ajā’ib al-makhlūqāt''), and Al-Damīrī (''Hayāt al-hayawān''). They may have known the Aristotelian ''Kitāb al-hayawān'' at second hand from Arabic compendiums of selected passages from the book. The only extant compendium is the ''Maqāla tushtamalu ‘à la fusūl min kitāb al-hayawān'', attributed (probably falsely) to Mūsà bin Maymūn ([[Moses Maimonides]]), and the Greek ''Compendium'' of [[Nicolaus Damascenus]] was at least partially available by the 11th century.

==In the Christian West==
Finally, [[Michael Scot]]’s early 13th-century [[Latin]] translation of the ''Kitāb al-hayawān'', ''De Animalibus'', is worthy of mention as the vehicle of transmission into Western Europe. It was alleged by [[Roger Bacon]] that Scot "had appropriated to himself the credit of translations which more properly belonged to one Andreas the Jew." This may mean that he had help with the Arabic manuscript, or that he worked fully or in part from a [[Judaeo-Arabic]] or [[Hebrew]] version. Scot's ''De Animalibus'' is available in a partial edition.&lt;ref&gt;Scot, Michael. ''De Animalibus''. Vols 1-3. Leiden: Brill, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5900">The '''Modern Architectural Research Group''', or '''MARS Group''', was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[architecture|architectural]] think tank founded in 1933 by several prominent architects and architectural critics of the time involved in the British [[International style (architecture)|modernist movement]]. The MARS Group came after several previous but unsuccessful attempts at creating an organization to support modernist architects in Britain such as those that had been formed on continental Europe, like the Union des Artistes Modernes in [[France]].  

The group first formed when [[Sigfried Giedion]] of the [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]] asked [[Morton Shand]] to assemble a group that would represent Britain at their events.  Shand, along with [[Wells Coates]], chose [[Maxwell Fry]] and [[F. R. S. Yorke]] as the founding members.  They were also joined by a few members of [[Tecton]], another architectural group, by [[Ove Arup]] and by [[John Betjeman]], a poet and contributor to ''[[Architectural Review]]''. The group's greatest success came in 1938 with a show at the New Burlington Galleries, but it also unfortunately left them in debt. The MARS group proposed a radical plan for the redevelopment of postwar London, the details of which were published the Architectural Review in 1942.&lt;ref name="odnb01"&gt;http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/60598, accessed 27 Dec 2008. Charlotte Benton. 2004. 'Korn, Arthur (1891–1978)’ in ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; At its height there were about 58 members in the group.The group itself began to lose steam along with the movement and many members left as a result of creative differences.  The group finally disbanded in 1957.

==The MARS Plan for London==

:"The plan for London issued by the Mars Group (the English wing of CIAM) and prepared by their Town Planning Committee was a marked contrast to anything that had gone before and, one might add, anything produced subsequently. It was frankly [[Utopian]] and Socialistic in concept."  Dennis Sharp, 1971.&lt;ref name="sharp01"/&gt;

The plan was devised by what has been described as a 'small and devoted' group, under the town planning sub committee of MARS, chaired by [[Arthur Korn (architect)|Arthur Korn]], and including Arthur Ling, [[Maxwell Fry]], the latter who worked as secretary, and fellow Jewish emigre, engineer [[Felix Samuely]].&lt;ref name="fry01"&gt;Pp 165-6 ''in'' Fry  E. M. 1971, ' The MARS Group plan of London ''in'' Arthur Korn, [[Maxwell Fry]], [[Dennis Sharp]]. 1971. The M.A.R.S. Plan for London. ''Perspecta, Vol. 13 (1971), pp. 163-173''&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur Korn is described as having been 'the main spring of the enterprise'  and as providing an 'infectious enthusiasm' that drove the project forward.&lt;ref name="fry01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gold01"&gt;P.88 ''in'' Gold J.

Medical Geology.&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission on Geological Sciences for Environmental Planning defines medical geology as, "The science dealing with the influence of ordinary environmental factors on the geographical distribution of health problems in man and animals."&lt;ref name="Stones and Health"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dissanayake|first=Chandrasekara|title=Of Stones and Health: Medical Geology in Sri Lanka|journal=Science|date=5 August 2005|volume=309|pages=883–885|doi=10.1126/science.1115174|pmid=16081722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''In its broadest sense, medical geology studies exposure to or deficiency of trace elements and minerals; inhalation of ambient and anthropogenic mineral dusts and volcanic emissions; transportation, modification and concentration of organic compounds; and exposure to radionuclides, microbes and pathogens.''&lt;ref&gt;Finkelman, R.B., Skinner, H. C. W., Plumlee G. S. &amp; Bunnell, J. E. 2001. Medical Geology. Geotimes. http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/nov01/feature_medgeo.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Many have deemed medical geology as a new field when in actuality it is re-emerging. [[Hippocrates]] and [[Aristotle]] first recognized the relationship between human diseases and the earth's elements.&lt;ref name="Emerging Discipline"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bunnell|first=Joseph|title=Medical Geology: Emerging Discipline on the Ecosystem--Human Health Interface|journal=EcoHealth|date=March 2004|volume=1|issue=1|pages=15–18|doi=10.1007/s10393-004-0068-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only now are people becoming aware of the effects the environment has on our health. This field ultimately depends on a number of different fields coming and working together to solve some of the earth's mysteries. The scientific term for this field is "hydrobiogeochemoepidemiopathoecology" however it is more commonly known as medical geology.&lt;ref name="Emerging Discipline" /&gt;  It was established in 1990 by the International Union of Geological Sciences.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; [[Paracelsus]], the father of pharmacology (1493-1541) stated that, "All substances are poisons, there is none which is not a poison. The right dosage differentiates a poison and a remedy."&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; This passage sums up the idea of medical geology perfectly. The goal of this field is to find the right balance and intake of elements/ minerals in order to improve and maintain health.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;

Examples of research in medical geology include:

* Studies on the impact of contaminant mobility as a result of [[extreme weather]] events such as [[flooding]].
*[[Lead]] and other [[Heavy metals|heavy metal]] exposure resulting from [[dust]] and other [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]]
*[[Asbestos]] exposure such as [[amphibole]] asbestos dusts in [[Libby, Montana]]
*[[Fungal]] [[infection]] resulting from airborne dust, such as [[Valley Fever]] or [[coccidioidomycosis]]

Recently a new concept of [[geomedical engineering]] has been introduced in medical geology through a paper titled ''"Geomedical Engineering: A new and captivating prospect".''&lt;ref name="Rehman"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rehman A.|date=June 2009|url=http://www.medicalgeology.org/pages/members/publications/newsletters/Newsletter%2014.pdf|title=Geomedical Engineering: A new and captivating prospect}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides the fundamentals of engineering applications to the medical geology issues.
 
==Environment and human health==
It is widely known that the state of our environment affects us in many ways. [[Minerals]] and [[rocks]] are going to have some impact on [[human]] and [[animal]] populations because that is what the [[earth]] is composed of.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;  Medical geology brings professionals from both the [[medicine]] field and the [[geology]] field to help us understand this relationship.&lt;ref name=IMGA&gt;{{cite web|title=International Medical Geology Association|url=http://www.medicalgeology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two priorities that have been established within the medical geology field, "(1) the study of [[trace elements]], especially their [[bioavailability]] and (2) a need to establish baseline, or background levels of [[contaminants]]/ [[xenobiotics]]/ potentially harmful but naturally occurring materials in [[water]], [[soil]], [[air]], [[food]], and [[animal]] tissue." &lt;ref name="Emerging Discipline" /&gt; The elements and minerals in the land effect people and animals immensely especially when there is a close relationship between the two. Those who depend heavily on the land are faced with one of two problems. First, those who live in places such as [[Maputaland]], [[South Africa]] are exposed to heavily impoverished soils which result in a number of diseases caused by [[mineral]] imbalances.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; Secondly, those in areas such as [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]] are often exposed to an excess of [[Chemical element|element]]s in the land resulting in [[mineral]] [[toxicity]].&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; We{{who|date=February 2017}} do of course need some naturally occurring [[Chemical element|element]]s however most can be extremely detrimental to our{{who|date=February 2017}} [[health]].&lt;ref name=Future&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selinus|first=Olle|title=Medical Geology: An Opportunity for the Future|journal=AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment|date=February 2007|volume=36|issue=1|pages=114–116|doi=10.1579/0044-7447(2007)36[114:mgaoft]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a direct link between [[health]] and the [[earth]] because we{{who|date=February 2017}} ingest and breath in all of these chemicals and for the most part we{{who|date=February 2017}} do it unknowingly.&lt;ref name=Future /&gt;

===Sources of Chemicals===
There are many ways in which [[humans]] come into contact with the earth's [[Chemical element|element]]s and below are only a few ways in which we become exposed to them.
*[[Volcanoes]] are one of the main sources that bring all the [[toxicity]] from inside the [[earth]] to the outside.&lt;ref name=Future /&gt; They bring out [[chemicals]] such as; [[arsenic]], [[beryllium]], [[cadmium]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[lead]], [[radon]], and [[uranium]].&lt;ref name="Future"/&gt;
*[[Rocks]] are also one of the leading sources in exposure to these [[Chemical element|element]]s. "They are essentially the source of all the naturally occurring [[chemical element]]s found on the [[earth]]."&lt;ref name="Future"/&gt;

==Diseases==

===Iodine Deficiency===
One of the biggest [[geochemical]] [[diseases]] is [[iodine deficiency]]. Thirty percent of the world is at risk for it and insufficient intake is the most common cause of [[mental retardation]] and [[brain damage]].&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; The [[sea]] is a major source of [[iodine]] and those who are further from it are at a disadvantage.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; Another source of it is in [[soil]], however [[goitrogens]] such as [[humus]] and [[clay]] trap the [[iodine]] making it hard for people to access it.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; Some [[cultures]] actually consume the earth's [[minerals]] by eating [[soil]] and [[clay]]; this is known as geophagy.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; It is most common in the tropics, especially among pregnant women.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; The Ottomac people of [[South America]] engage in this practice and none have suffered from any [[health]] problems related with mineral/ Iodine deficiency.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;

===Cardiovascular Disease===
[[Cardiovascular disease]] has often been linked to [[water]] hardness as the main cause.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; [[Water]] hardness means that there is [[magnesium]] in the [[water]] with [[calcium]] playing a role.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;  Of course some research has completely discredited this evidence, and have found that the more [[magnesium]] in the [[water]] the less chance of death [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;

===Radiation===
Natural [[radiation]] is found everywhere; it is in the [[air]], [[water]], [[soil]], [[rocks]], [[minerals]] and [[food]].&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; The largest amount of [[radiation]] comes from [[radon]].&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; Certain places are called 'high background radiation areas' (HBRAs), such as [[Guarapari]], Southwest of [[France]], [[Ramsar, Mazandaran|Ramsar]], parts of [[China]], and Kerala Coast.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; People living in these areas however have not shown any [[health]] deficiencies and in some cases are even healthier and live longer than those not in HBRAs.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;

===Other Issues===
Among the problems presented there are also issues with [[fluoride]] in [[Africa]] and [[India]], [[arsenic]] in [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], and [[Taiwan]], [[selenium]] in areas of the [[United States]], [[Venezuela]], [[China]] and [[nitrate]] in [[agricultural]] areas.&lt;ref name=Book&gt;{{cite book|last=Alloway|first=B.J.|title=Essentials of Medical Geology: Impacts of the Natural Environment on Public Health|year=2005|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|location=Amsterdam, Boston|isbn=0126363412}}&lt;/ref&gt; As medical geology grows it may become more important to the [[medical]] field in the issue of [[diseases]].
In addition to deficiencies of particular minerals, dietary excesses of certain elements occurring in specific geographic regions can also be harmful to human health, as per the examples listed below:
*Hyperkalemia: excess amount of potassium&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;
*Hypercalcemia: excess amount of calcium&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;
*Hyperphosphatemia: excess amount of phosphorus&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;

==International Medical Geology Association (IMGA)==
"The International Medical Geology Association aims to provide a network and a forum to bring together the combined expertise of [[geologists]] and earth scientists, environmental scientists, [[toxicologists]], [[epidemiologists]], and [[medical]] specialists, in order to characterize the properties of [[geological]] processes and agents, the dispersal of [[geological]] material and their effects on [[human]] population."&lt;ref name=IMGA /&gt; IMGA was founded in 2006 and manages affairs and funds, plans conferences, elections and publications, and they are also a way of encouraging growth and recognition in the field.&lt;ref name=IMGA /&gt; Although it was founded in 2006, it was a work in progress for ten years when a working group of medical geology was established by the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] (IUGS) in 1996.&lt;ref name=Future /&gt; The goal of the working group was to advertise and make people aware of the harmful effects the environment has on our [[health]].&lt;ref name=Future /&gt;

'''Pro-war rhetoric''' is [[rhetoric]] or [[propaganda]] designed to convince its audience that war is necessary. The two main analytical approaches to pro-war rhetoric were founded by Ronald Reid, a Professor of Communication Studies at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], and [[Robert Ivie]], a Professor of Rhetoric and Public Communication and Culture at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University (Bloomington)]]. Reid's framework originated from inductively studying propaganda. Ivie uses a deductive approach based on the work of [[Kenneth Burke]], claiming that "a people strongly committed to the ideal of peace, but simultaneously faced with the reality of war, must believe that the fault for any such disruption of their ideal lies with others" (Ivie 279).

==Rhetorical framework of Ronald Reid==
According to Reid, pro-war rhetoric uses three appeals: territorial, ethnocentric, and optimistic..

===Territorial appeals===

Territorial appeals threaten the audience's "sense of territoriality" (Reid 260). The audience is more likely to support entering the war on the defensive rather than offensive side because of an actual or threatened invasion.

===Ethnocentric appeals===
Ethnocentric appeals create a dichotomy between the audience and the enemy. [[Ethnocentrism]] should be evoked to a "high level of emotional intensity" in attempt to complete two goals: hate the "inferior alien" and depict threats to cultural values (Reid 267).

The most common method of evoking ethnocentric appeals come in the form of Barbarism vs. Gallantry (Reid 269). It depicts the enemy's cultural values with evil characteristics, and the audience's as angelic.

===Optimistic appeal===
The optimistic appeal assures the audience that victory is inevitable should they enter into war.(Reid 282).

==Rhetorical framework of Robert Ivie==
According to Ivie, pro-war rhetoric identifies three topoi; force vs. freedom, irrational vs. rational, and aggression vs. defense.

===Force vs. freedom===
This tactic portrays to the audience that they are entering war to provide freedom, and the opponent to force their values upon others (Ivie 284). This is accomplished by implying that the opponent is violent, while the audience's nation is willing to negotiate (Ivie 284).

===Irrational vs. rational===
This [[topos]] holds that the enemy is portrayed as irrational, responding "more to animalistic drives than principles of law" (Ivie 288). The enemy has an unenlightened intellect, not based on reason. Rhetors use this argument to prove that when an enemy such as this threatens the well-being of the world, even for a nation committed to neutrality and peace, war is the only choice (Ivie 289).

===Aggression vs. defense===
This idea portrays the enemy as the voluntary aggressor and the nation of the audience as the passive victims of aggression, only entering into war to ensure security (Ivie 290). "While the savage has acted against order, the victim has been forced to respond in its defense" (Ivie 290). Ivie describes the actions as either "voluntary" and "initial" or "involuntary" and "defensive" (Ivie 290). The purpose of this topos is to lay the blame on the enemy and justify reasons for the victimized nation to engage in action.

Professor Joan Vickers is credited as the originator of quiet eye theory,&lt;ref name="atlantic-2015-11-18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ft-2014-06-16"/&gt; and has been working on the topic since the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="cnn-2005-03-21"/&gt;

==Applications and mechanism==

Quiet eye theory can be used both to predict performance,&lt;ref name="cnn-2005-03-21"/&gt; and sometimes, as ''quiet eye training'', as a means to improve performance.&lt;ref name="telegraph-2010-07-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="causer-et-al-2014"/&gt;

The '''relative index of inequality''' (RII) is a regression-based index which summarizes the magnitude of [[socio-economic status]] (SES) as a source of [[Health disparities|inequalities]] in health. RII is useful because it takes into account the size of the population and the relative disadvantage experienced by different groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Measuring the magnitude of socio-economic inequalities in health: An overview of available measures illustrated with two examples from Europe | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | year = 1997 | first = Johan | last = Mackenbach |author2=Anton Kunst  | volume = 44 | issue = 6 | pages = 757–771| doi = 10.1016/S0277-9536(96)00073-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease outcome is regressed on the proportion of the population that has a higher position in the hierarchy.

The RII is particularly valuable when comparing risk factors (independent variables) that are on very different scales (e.g. low SES, low [[IQ]], [[cigarette smoking]]). The RII is calculated in the following way:&lt;ref name="Batty2006"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Does IQ explain socioeconomic inequalities in health? Evidence from a population based cohort study in the west of Scotland | journal = BMJ | year = 2006 | first = David | last = Batty |author2=Geoff Der |author3=Sally Macintyre |author4=Ian Deary  | pmid = 16452104 | volume = 332 | issue = 7541 | pmc = 1397779 | pages = 580–584| doi = 10.1136/bmj.38723.660637.AE }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}

# Rank cases on each of the variables
# For tied ranks and for categorical variables, assign the mean rank
# Divide the ranks by the sample size, creating a value ranging from 0 to 1

== Interpretation of RII ==

The interpretation of RII is similar to the [[relative risk]]. It summarizes the relative risk for the most advantaged group (at the top of the hierarchy) compared to the least advantaged group (at the bottom of the hierarchy). This interpretation assumes that the variables have been scored so that higher scores are consistent with increased risk. For example, an RII of 1.88 (95% [[confidence intervals]] 1.27 to 2.77), an indicator of low SES, on the risk of long term illness, implies that those in the most deprived group are 1.88 times more likely to experience illness than those in the least deprived group.&lt;ref name="Batty2006" /&gt;

== Limitations of RII ==

One disadvantage of the RII is that it may capitalize on skewed data, inflating the apparent relative risk. A second limitation is that a large RII may arise for two reasons. First, it may represent a large effect of SES on disease. Second, it may reflect large differences between those with the most SES and those with the least (i.e. large inequalities in SES itself).

[[file:Edward J Routh.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Edward John Routh]], 1831–1907.]]

In [[analytical mechanics]], a branch of [[theoretical physics]], '''Routhian mechanics''' is a hybrid formulation of [[Lagrangian mechanics]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] developed by [[Edward John Routh]]. Correspondingly, the '''Routhian''' is the [[function (mathematics)|function]] which replaces both the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian function|Hamiltonian]] functions.

The Routhian, like the Hamiltonian, can be obtained from a [[Legendre transform]] of the Lagrangian, and has a similar mathematical form to the Hamiltonian, but is not exactly the same. The difference between the Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, and Routhian functions are their variables. For a given set of [[generalized coordinates]] representing the [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] in the system, the Lagrangian is a function of the coordinates and velocities, while the Hamiltonian is a function of the coordinates and momenta.

The Routhian differs from these functions in that some coordinates are chosen to have corresponding generalized velocities, the rest to have corresponding generalized momenta. This choice is arbitrary, and can be done to simplify the problem. It also has the consequence that the '''Routhian equations''' are exactly the Hamiltonian equations for some coordinates and corresponding momenta, and the Lagrangian equations for the rest of the coordinates and their velocities. In each case the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian functions are replaced by a single function, the Routhian. The full set thus has the advantages of both sets of equations, with the convenience of splitting one set of coordinates to the Hamilton equations, and the rest to the Lagrangian equations.

Often the Routhian approach may offer no advantage, but one notable case where this is useful is when a system has [[cyclic coordinates]] (also called "ignorable coordinates"), by definition those coordinates which do not appear in the original Lagrangian. The Lagrangian equations are powerful results, used frequently in theory and practice, since the equations of motion in the coordinates are easy to set up. However, if cyclic coordinates occur there will still be equations to solve for all the coordinates, including the cyclic coordinates despite their absence in the Lagrangian. The Hamiltonian equations are useful theoretical results, but less useful in practice because coordinates and momenta are related together in the solutions - after solving the equations the coordinates and momenta must be eliminated from each other. Nevertheless, the Hamiltonian equations are perfectly suited to cyclic coordinates because the equations in the cyclic coordinates trivially vanish, leaving only the equations in the non cyclic coordinates.

The Routhian approach has the best of both approaches, because cyclic coordinates can be split off to the Hamiltonian equations and eliminated, leaving behind the non cyclic coordinates to be solved from the Lagrangian equations. Overall fewer equations need to be solved compared to the Lagrangian approach.

As with the rest of analytical mechanics, Routhian mechanics is completely equivalent to Newtonian mechanics, all other formulations of classical mechanics, and introduces no new physics. It offers an alternative way to solve mechanical problems.

==Definitions==

In the case of Lagrangian mechanics, the [[generalized coordinates]] {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, ... and the corresponding velocities {{math|''dq''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'', ''dq''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'', ...}}, and possibly time&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The coordinates are functions of time, so the Lagrangian always has implicit time-dependence via the coordinates. If the Lagrangian changes with time irrespective of the coordinates, usually due to some time-dependent potential, then the Lagrangian is said to have "explicit" time-dependence. Similarly for the Hamiltonian and Routhian functions.&lt;/ref&gt; {{math|''t''}}, enter the Lagrangian,

:&lt;math&gt;L(q_1,q_2,\ldots,\dot{q}_1,\dot{q}_2,\ldots,t)\,, \quad \dot{q}_i = \frac{d q_i}{dt} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

where the overdots denote [[time derivative]]s.

In Hamiltonian mechanics, the generalized coordinates {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...}} and the corresponding generalized momenta {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,}} and possibly time, enter the Hamiltonian,

:&lt;math&gt;H(q_1,q_2,\ldots,p_1,p_2,\ldots,t) = \sum_i \dot{q}_ip_i - L(q_1,q_2,\ldots,\dot{q}_1(p_1),\dot{q}_2(p_2),\ldots,t) \,, \quad p_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the second equation is the definition of the generalized momentum {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} corresponding to the coordinate {{math|''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} ([[partial derivative]]s are denoted using {{math|∂}}). The velocities {{math|''dq&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}} are expressed as functions of their corresponding momenta by inverting their defining relation. In this context, {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is said to be the momentum "canonically conjugate" to {{math|''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

The Routhian is intermediate between {{math|''L''}} and {{math|''H''}}; some coordinates {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are chosen to have corresponding generalized momenta {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the rest of the coordinates {{math|''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''ζ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''}} to have generalized velocities {{math|''dζ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'', ''dζ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'', ..., ''dζ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}}, and time may appear explicitly;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1976|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{equation box 1
|indent = :
|background colour = white

|border = 1
|title = '''Routhian''' ({{math|''n'' + ''s''}} degrees of freedom)
|equation=&lt;math&gt;R(q_1,\ldots,q_n,\zeta_1,\ldots,\zeta_s, p_1, \ldots,p_n , \dot{\zeta}_1 , \ldots,\dot{\zeta}_s,t) = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i\dot{q}_i(p_i) - L(q_1,\ldots,q_n,\zeta_1,\ldots,\zeta_s, \dot{q}_1(p_1), \ldots, \dot{q}_n(p_n) , \dot{\zeta}_1 , \ldots,\dot{\zeta}_s,t) \,, &lt;/math&gt;
}}

where again the generalized velocity {{math|''dq''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt''}} is to be expressed as a function of generalized momentum {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} via its defining relation. The choice of which {{math|''n''}} coordinates are to have corresponding momenta, out of the {{math|''n'' + ''s''}} coordinates, is arbitrary.

The above is used by [[course of theoretical physics|Landau and Lifshitz]], and [[Classical Mechanics (Goldstein book)|Goldstein]]. Some authors may define the Routhian to be the negative of the above definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hand|Finch|2008|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the length of the general definition, a more compact notation is to use boldface for [[tuple]]s (or vectors) of the variables, thus {{math|'''q''' {{=}} (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, {{math|'''ζ''' {{=}} (''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''ζ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, {{math|'''p''' {{=}} (''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, and {{math|''d'' '''ζ'''/''dt'' {{=}} (''dζ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'', ''dζ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'', ..., ''dζ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt'')}}, so that

:&lt;math&gt;R(\mathbf{q},\boldsymbol{\zeta}, \mathbf{p}, \dot{\boldsymbol{\zeta}}, t) = \mathbf{p}\cdot\dot{{\mathbf{q}}} - L(\mathbf{q}, \boldsymbol{\zeta}, \dot{\mathbf{q}}, \dot{\boldsymbol{\zeta}},t) \,, &lt;/math&gt;

where · is the [[dot product]] defined on the tuples, for the specific example appearing here:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}\cdot\dot{{\mathbf{q}}} = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i\dot{q}_i \,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Equations of motion==

For reference, the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian equations]] for {{math|''s''}} degrees of freedom are a set of {{math|''s''}} coupled second order [[ordinary differential equation]]s in the coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_j} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_j} \,,  &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''j'' {{=}} 1, 2, ..., ''s''}}, and the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian equations]] for {{math|''n''}} degrees of freedom are a set of {{math|2''n''}} coupled first order ordinary differential equations in the coordinates and momenta

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{q}_i = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i} \,,\quad \dot{p}_i = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Below, the Routhian equations of motion are obtained in two ways, in the process other useful derivatives are found that can be used elsewhere.

===Two degrees of freedom===

Consider the case of a system with two [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''ζ''}}, with generalized velocities {{math|''dq''/''dt''}} and {{math|''dζ''/''dt''}}, and the Lagrangian is time-dependent. (The generalization to any number of degrees of freedom follows exactly the same procedure as with two).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1976|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lagrangian of the system will have the form

:&lt;math&gt; L(q, \zeta, \dot{q}, \dot{\zeta}, t) &lt;/math&gt;

The [[differential of a function|differential]] of {{math|''L''}} is

:&lt;math&gt; dL = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q}dq + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \zeta}d\zeta + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}}d\dot{q} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}}d\dot{\zeta} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}dt \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Now change variables, from the set ({{math|''q''}}, {{math|''ζ''}}, {{math|''dq''/''dt''}}, {{math|''dζ''/''dt''}}) to ({{math|''q''}}, {{math|''ζ''}}, {{math|''p''}}, {{math|''dζ''/''dt''}}), simply switching the velocity {{math|''dq''/''dt''}} to the momentum {{math|''p''}}. This change of variables in the differentials is the [[Legendre transformation]]. The differential of the new function to replace {{math|''L''}} will be a sum of differentials in {{math|''dq''}}, {{math|''dζ''}}, {{math|''dp''}}, {{math|''d''(''dζ''/''dt'')}}, and {{math|''dt''}}. Using the definition of generalized momentum and Lagrange's equation for the coordinate {{math|''q''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} \,,\quad  \dot{p} = \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q}&lt;/math&gt;

we have

:&lt;math&gt; dL = \dot{p}dq + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \zeta}d\zeta + p d\dot{q} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}}d\dot{\zeta} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}dt &lt;/math&gt;

and to replace {{math|''pd''(''dq''/''dt'')}} by {{math|(''dq''/''dt'')''dp''}}, recall the [[product rule]] for differentials,&lt;ref group=nb&gt;For two functions {{math|''u''}} and {{math|''v''}}, the differential of the product is {{math|''d''(''uv'') {{=}} ''udv'' + ''vdu''}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and substitute

:&lt;math&gt; pd\dot{q} = d(\dot{q} p) - \dot{q}dp &lt;/math&gt;

to obtain the differential of a new function in terms of the new set of variables:

:&lt;math&gt; d(L-p\dot{q}) = \dot{p} dq + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \zeta}d\zeta  - \dot{q} dp + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}}d\dot{\zeta} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}dt \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Introducing the Routhian

:&lt;math&gt; R(q,\zeta,p,\dot{\zeta},t) = p \dot{q}(p) - L &lt;/math&gt;

where again the velocity {{math|''dq''/''dt''}} is a function of the momentum {{math|''p''}}, we have

:&lt;math&gt; dR = -\dot{p} dq - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \zeta}d\zeta  + \dot{q}dp - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}}d\dot{\zeta} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}dt\,, &lt;/math&gt;

but from the above definition, the differential of the Routhian is

:&lt;math&gt; dR = \frac{\partial R }{\partial q}dq + \frac{\partial R }{\partial \zeta}d\zeta + \frac{\partial R }{\partial p}dp + \frac{\partial R }{\partial \dot{\zeta}}d\dot{\zeta} + \frac{\partial R}{\partial t}dt \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Comparing the coefficients of the differentials {{math|''dq''}}, {{math|''dζ''}}, {{math|''dp''}}, {{math|''d''(''dζ''/''dt'')}}, and {{math|''dt''}}, the results are [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's equations]] for the coordinate {{math|''q''}},

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{q} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial p} \,,\quad \dot{p} = -\frac{\partial R}{\partial q} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and [[Lagrange's equation]] for the coordinate {{math|''ζ''}}

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial \zeta}  &lt;/math&gt;

which follow from

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial L}{\partial \zeta} = - \frac{\partial R}{\partial \zeta} \,,\quad \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}} = - \frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and taking the total time derivative of the second equation and equating to the first. Notice the Routhian replaces the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian functions in all the equations of motion.

The remaining equation states the partial time derivatives of {{math|''L''}} and {{math|''R''}} are negatives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial R}{\partial t}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Any number of degrees of freedom===

For {{math|''n'' + ''s''}} coordinates as defined above, with Routhian

:&lt;math&gt;R(q_1,\ldots,q_n,\zeta_1,\ldots,\zeta_s, p_1, \ldots,p_n , \dot{\zeta}_1 , \ldots,\dot{\zeta}_s,t) = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i\dot{q}_i(p_i) - L&lt;/math&gt;

the equations of motion can be derived by a Legendre transformation of this Routhian as in the previous section, but another way is to simply take the partial derivatives of {{math|''R''}} with respect to the coordinates {{math|''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''ζ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, momenta {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and velocities {{math|''dζ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}}, where {{math|''i'' {{=}} 1, 2, ..., ''n''}}, and {{math|''j'' {{=}} 1, 2, ..., ''s''}}. The derivatives are

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial R}{\partial q_i} = -\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} = - \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} = - \dot{p}_i &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial R}{\partial p_i} = \dot{q}_i &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial R}{\partial \zeta_j} = - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \zeta_j} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} = - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial R}{\partial t} = - \frac{\partial L}{\partial t} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The first two are identically the Hamiltonian equations. Equating the total time derivative of the fourth set of equations with the third (for each value of {{math|''j''}}) gives the Lagrangian equations. The fifth is just the same relation between time partial derivatives as before. To summarize&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{equation box 1
|indent = :
|background colour = white
|border colour =black
|border = 1
|title = '''Routhian equations of motion''' (''n'' + ''s'' degrees of freedom)
|equation=&lt;math&gt; \dot{q}_i = \frac{\partial R}{\partial p_i} \,,\quad \dot{p}_i = -\frac{\partial R}{\partial q_i}  \,,  &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial \zeta_j} \,. &lt;/math&gt;
}}

The total number of equations is {{math|2''n'' + ''s''}}, there are {{math|2''n''}} Hamiltonian equations plus {{math|''s''}} Lagrange equations.

==Energy==

Since the Lagrangian has the same units as [[energy]], the units of the Routhian are also energy. In [[SI units]] this is the [[Joule]].

Taking the total time derivative of the Lagrangian leads to the general result

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L}{\partial t} = \frac{d }{d t}\left(\sum_{i=1}^n \dot{q}_i\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} + \sum_{j=1}^s \dot{\zeta}_j\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} - L\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

If the Lagrangian is independent of time, the partial time derivative of the Lagrangian is zero, {{math|∂''L''/∂''t'' {{=}} 0}}, so the quantity under the total time derivative in brackets must be a constant, it is the total energy of the system&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1976|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E = \sum_{i=1}^n \dot{q}_i\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} + \sum_{j=1}^s \dot{\zeta}_j\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} - L\,.&lt;/math&gt;

(If there are external fields interacting with the constituents of the system, they can vary throughout space but not time). This expression requires the partial derivatives of {{math|''L''}} with respect to ''all'' the velocities {{math|''dq&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}} and {{math|''dζ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}}. Under the same condition of {{math|''R''}} being time independent, the energy in terms of the Routhian is a little simpler, substituting the definition of {{math|''R''}} and the partial derivatives of {{math|''R''}} with respect to the velocities {{math|''dζ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}},

:&lt;math&gt;E = R - \sum_{j=1}^s \dot{\zeta}_j\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Notice only the partial derivatives of {{math|''R''}} with respect to the velocities {{math|''dζ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}} are needed. In the case that {{math|''s'' {{=}} 0}} and the Routhian is explicitly time-independent, then {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''R''}}, that is, the Routhian equals the energy of the system. The same expression for {{math|''R''}} in when {{math|''s'' {{=}} 0}} is also the Hamiltonian, so in all {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''R'' {{=}} ''H''}}.

If the Routhian has explicit time dependence, the total energy of the system is not constant. The general result is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial R}{\partial t} = \dfrac{d}{dt}\left(R - \sum_{j=1}^s \dot{\zeta}_j\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} \right)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

which can be derived from the total time derivative of {{math|''R''}} in the same way as for {{math|''L''}}.

==Cyclic coordinates==

The Routhian formulation is useful for systems with [[cyclic coordinates]], because by definition those coordinates do not enter {{math|''L''}}, and hence {{math|''R''}}. The corresponding partial derivatives of {{math|''L''}} and {{math|''R''}} with respect to those coordinates are zero, which equates to the corresponding generalized momenta reducing to constants. To make this concrete, if the {{math|''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are all cyclic coordinates, and the {{math|''ζ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are all non cyclic, then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i}  = \dot{p}_i = - \frac{\partial R}{\partial q_i} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad p_i = \alpha_i \,, &lt;/math&gt;

where the {{math|''α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are constants. With these constants substituted into the Routhian, {{math|''R''}} is a function of only the non cyclic coordinates and velocities (and in general time also)

:&lt;math&gt;R(\zeta_1,\ldots,\zeta_s,\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n,\dot{\zeta}_1,\ldots,\dot{\zeta}_s,t) = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i\dot{q}_i(\alpha_i) - L(\zeta_1,\ldots,\zeta_s,\dot{q}_1(\alpha_1),\ldots,\dot{q}_n(\alpha_n),\dot{\zeta}_1,\ldots,\dot{\zeta}_s,t) \,, &lt;/math&gt;

The {{math|2''n''}} Hamiltonian equation in the cyclic coordinates automatically vanishes,

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{q}_i=\frac{\partial R}{\partial \alpha_i}=f_i( \zeta_1(t),\ldots,\zeta_s(t), \dot{\zeta}_1(t),\ldots,\dot{\zeta}_s(t), \alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n,t) \,,\quad \dot{p}_i=-\frac{\partial R}{\partial q_i}=0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

and the {{math|''s''}} Lagrangian equations are in the non cyclic coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial \zeta_j} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Thus the problem has been reduced to solving the Lagrangian equations in the non cyclic coordinates, with the advantage of the Hamiltonian equations cleanly removing the cyclic coordinates. Using those solutions, the equations for &lt;math&gt;\dot{q}_i&lt;/math&gt;can be integrated to compute &lt;math&gt;q_i(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

If we are interested in how the cyclic coordinates change with time, the equations for the generalized velocities corresponding to the cyclic coordinates can be integrated.

==Examples==

The Routhian method does not guarantee the equations of motion will be simple, however it will lead to fewer equations.

=== Central potential in spherical coordinates ===

One general class of mechanical systems with cyclic coordinates are those with [[central potential]]s, because potentials of this form only have dependence on radial separations and no dependence on angles.

Consider a particle of mass {{math|''m''}} under the influence of a central potential {{math|''V''(''r'')}} in [[spherical polar coordinates]] {{math|(''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}}

:&lt;math&gt;L(r,\dot{r},\theta,\dot{\theta},\dot{\phi}) = \frac{m}{2}(\dot{r}^2 + {r}^2\dot{\theta}^2 + r^2 \sin^2\theta\dot{\phi}^2) - V(r) \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Notice {{math|''φ''}} is cyclic, because it does not appear in the Lagrangian. The momentum conjugate to {{math|''φ''}} is the constant

:&lt;math&gt;p_\phi = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = mr^2\sin^2\theta\dot{\phi}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

in which {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''dφ''/''dt''}} can vary with time, but the angular momentum {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is constant. The Routhian can be taken to be

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
R(r,\dot{r},\theta,\dot{\theta}) &amp; = p_\phi\dot{\phi} - L \\
&amp; = p_\phi\dot{\phi} - \frac{m}{2}\dot{r}^2 - \frac{m}{2}r^2\dot{\theta}^2 - \frac{p_\phi\dot{\phi}}{2} + V(r) \\
&amp; = \frac{p_\phi\dot{\phi}}{2} - \frac{m}{2}\dot{r}^2 - \frac{m}{2}r^2\dot{\theta}^2 + V(r) \\
&amp; = \frac{p_\phi^2 }{2mr^2\sin^2\theta} - \frac{m}{2}\dot{r}^2 - \frac{m}{2}r^2\dot{\theta}^2 + V(r) \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We can solve for {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''θ''}} using Lagrange's equations, and do not need to solve for {{math|''φ''}} since it is eliminated by Hamiltonian's equations. The {{math|''r''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{r}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial r} \quad\Rightarrow\quad-m\ddot{r} = -\frac{p_\phi^2}{mr^3\sin^2\theta} - mr\dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{\partial V}{\partial r} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and the {{math|''θ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial \theta} \quad\Rightarrow\quad -m(2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^2\ddot{\theta}) = -\frac{p_\phi^2\cos\theta}{mr^2\sin^3\theta} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The Routhian approach has obtained two coupled nonlinear equations. By contrast the Lagrangian approach leads to ''three'' nonlinear coupled equations, mixing in the first and second time derivatives of {{math|''φ''}} in all of them, despite its absence from the Lagrangian.

The {{math|''r''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{r}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial r} \quad\Rightarrow\quad m\ddot{r} = mr\dot{\theta}^2 + mr\sin^2\theta\dot{\phi}^2 - \frac{\partial V}{\partial r} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

the {{math|''θ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} \quad\Rightarrow\quad 2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^2\ddot{\theta} = r^2 \sin\theta\cos\theta\dot{\phi}^2\,, &lt;/math&gt;

the {{math|''φ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi} \quad\Rightarrow\quad 2r\dot{r}\sin^2\theta\dot{\phi} + 2r^2 \sin\theta\cos\theta \dot{\theta}\dot{\phi} + r^2\sin^2\theta \ddot{\phi}=0 \,. &lt;/math&gt;

===Symmetric mechanical systems===

====Spherical pendulum====

[[File:Spherical pendulum Lagrangian mechanics.svg|thumb|300px|Spherical pendulum: angles and velocities.]]

Consider the [[spherical pendulum]], a mass {{math|''m''}} (known as a "pendulum bob") attached to a rigid rod of length {{math|''l''}} of negligible mass, subject to a local gravitational field {{math|''g''}}. The system rotates with angular velocity {{math|''dφ''/''dt''}} which is ''not'' constant. The angle between the rod and vertical is {{math|''θ''}} and is ''not'' constant.

The Lagrangian is&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The potential energy is actually
:&lt;math&gt;V=mg\ell(1-\cos\theta)\,,&lt;/math&gt;
but since the first term is constant, it can be ignored in the Lagrangian (and Routhian) which only depend on derivatives of coordinates and velocities. Subtracting this from the kinetic energy means a plus sign in the Lagrangian, not minus.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L(\theta,\dot{\theta},\dot{\phi}) = \frac{m\ell^2}{2}(\dot{\theta}^2 + \sin^2\theta \dot{\phi}^2) + mg\ell\cos\theta \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and {{math|''φ''}} is the cyclic coordinate for the system with constant momentum

:&lt;math&gt;p_\phi = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = m\ell^2\sin^2\theta \dot{\phi} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

which again is physically the angular momentum of the system about the vertical. The angle {{math|''θ''}} and angular velocity {{math|''dφ''/''dt''}} vary with time, but the angular momentum is constant. The Routhian is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
R(\theta,\dot{\theta}) &amp; = p_\phi \dot{\phi} - L \\
&amp; = p_\phi \dot{\phi} - \frac{m\ell^2}{2}\dot{\theta}^2 - \frac{p_\phi \dot{\phi}}{2} - mg\ell\cos\theta \\
&amp; = \frac{p_\phi \dot{\phi}}{2} - \frac{m\ell^2}{2}\dot{\theta}^2  - mg\ell\cos\theta \\
&amp; = \frac{p_\phi^2 }{2m\ell^2\sin^2\theta} - \frac{m\ell^2}{2}\dot{\theta}^2 - mg\ell\cos\theta
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The {{math|''θ''}} equation is found from the Lagrangian equations

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial \theta} \quad \Rightarrow \quad - m\ell^2\ddot{\theta} = -\frac{p_\phi^2 \cos\theta}{m\ell^2\sin^3\theta} + mg\ell\sin\theta \,,&lt;/math&gt;

or simplifying by introducing the constants

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{p_\phi^2}{m^2\ell^4}\,,\quad b = \frac{g}{\ell} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

gives

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{\theta} = a\frac{\cos\theta}{\sin^3\theta} - b \sin\theta \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation resembles the simple nonlinear [[pendulum equation]], because it can swing through the vertical axis, with an additional term to account for the rotation about the vertical axis (the constant {{math|''a''}} is related to the angular momentum {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;''}}).

Applying the Lagrangian approach there are two nonlinear coupled equations to solve.

The {{math|''θ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} \quad\Rightarrow\quad m\ell^2\ddot{\theta} = m\ell^2 \sin\theta\cos\theta\dot{\phi}^2 -mg\ell\sin\theta \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and the {{math|''φ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi} \quad\Rightarrow\quad 2\sin\theta\cos\theta \dot{\theta}\dot{\phi} + \sin^2\theta \ddot{\phi}=0 \,. &lt;/math&gt;

====Heavy symmetrical top====

[[File:Heavy symmetric top euler angles.svg|thumb|Heavy symmetric top in terms of the Euler angles.]]

The heavy [[symmetrical top]] of mass {{math|''M''}} has Lagrangian&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kibble|Berkshire|2004|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L(\theta,\dot{\theta},\dot{\psi},\dot{\phi})=\frac{I_1}{2}(\dot{\theta}^2 + \dot{\phi}^2\sin^2\theta) + \frac{I_3}{2}(\dot{\psi}^2+\dot{\phi}^2\cos^2\theta)+I_3\dot{\psi}\dot{\phi}\cos\theta-Mg\ell\cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''ψ'', ''φ'', ''θ''}} are the [[Euler angles]], {{math|''θ''}} is the angle between the vertical {{math|''z''}}-axis and the top's {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}}-axis, {{math|''ψ''}} is the rotation of the top about its own {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}}-axis, and {{math|''φ''}} the azimuthal of the top's {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}}-axis around the vertical {{math|''z''}}-axis. The principal [[moments of inertia]] are {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} about the top's own {{math|''x''&amp;prime;}} axis, {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} about the top's own {{math|''y''&amp;prime;}} axes, and {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} about the top's own {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}}-axis. Since the top is symmetric about its {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}}-axis, {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Here the simple relation for local [[gravitational potential energy]] {{math|''V'' {{=}} ''Mgl''cos''θ''}} is used where {{math|''g''}} is the acceleration due to gravity, and the centre of mass of the top is a distance {{math|''l''}} from its tip along its {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}}-axis.

The angles {{math|''ψ'', ''φ''}} are cyclic. The constant momenta are the angular momenta of the top about its axis and its precession about the vertical, respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;p_\psi = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\psi}} = I_3\dot{\psi} + I_3\dot{\phi} \cos\theta &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p_\phi = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = \dot{\phi}(I_1\sin^2\theta + I_3\cos^2\theta) + I_3\dot{\psi}\cos\theta &lt;/math&gt;

From these, eliminating {{math|''dψ''/''dt''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;p_\phi - p_\psi\cos\theta = I_1\dot{\phi}\sin^2\theta&lt;/math&gt;

we have

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{\phi} = \frac{p_\phi - p_\psi\cos\theta}{I_1\sin^2\theta}\,, &lt;/math&gt;

and to eliminate {{math|''dφ''/''dt''}}, substitute this result into {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;ψ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and solve for {{math|''dψ''/''dt''}} to find

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\psi} = \frac{p_\psi}{I_3} - \cos\theta \left(\frac{p_\phi - p_\psi\cos\theta}{I_1\sin^2\theta}\right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The Routhian can be taken to be

:&lt;math&gt;R(\theta,\dot{\theta}) = p_\psi\dot{\psi} + p_\phi\dot{\phi} - L = \frac{1}{2}(p_\psi\dot{\psi} + p_\phi\dot{\phi}) - \frac{I_1 \dot{\theta}^2}{2} + Mg\ell \cos\theta &lt;/math&gt;

and since

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{p_\phi\dot{\phi}}{2} = \frac{p_\phi^2}{2I_1\sin^2\theta} - \frac{p_\psi p_\phi\cos\theta}{2I_1\sin^2\theta}\,, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p_\psi \dot{\psi}}{2} = \frac{p_\psi^2}{2I_3} - \frac{p_\psi p_\phi\cos\theta  }{2I_1\sin^2\theta} + \frac{p_\psi^2 \cos^2\theta}{2I_1\sin^2\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

we have

:&lt;math&gt;R =  \frac{p_\psi^2}{2I_3} + \frac{p_\psi^2 \cos^2\theta}{2I_1\sin^2\theta} + \frac{p_\phi^2}{2I_1\sin^2\theta} - \frac{p_\psi p_\phi\cos\theta}{4I_1\sin^2\theta} - \frac{I_1 \dot{\theta}^2}{2} + Mg\ell \cos\theta \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The first term is constant, and can be ignored since only the derivatives of ''R'' will enter the equations of motion. The simplified Routhian, without loss of information, is thus

:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{1}{2I_1\sin^2\theta}\left[p_\psi^2 \cos^2\theta + p_\phi^2 - \frac{p_\psi p_\phi}{2} \cos\theta\right] - \frac{I_1 \dot{\theta}^2}{2} + Mg\ell \cos\theta &lt;/math&gt;

The equation of motion for {{math|''θ''}} is, by direct calculation,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial \theta} \quad \Rightarrow \quad &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-I_1\ddot{\theta} = -\frac{\cos\theta}{I_1\sin^3\theta}\left[p_\psi^2 \cos^2\theta + p_\phi^2 - \frac{p_\psi p_\phi}{2} \cos\theta\right] + \frac{1}{2I_1\sin^2\theta} \left[-2 p_\psi^2 \cos\theta\sin\theta + \frac{p_\psi p_\phi}{2} \sin\theta\right] -Mg\ell\sin\theta \,, &lt;/math&gt;

or by introducing the constants

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{p_\psi^2}{I_1^2} \,,\quad b = \frac{p_\phi^2}{I_1^2}\,,\quad c=\frac{p_\psi p_\phi}{2 I_1^2}\,,\quad k= \frac{Mg\ell}{I_1}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

a simpler form of the equation is obtained

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{\theta} = \frac{\cos\theta}{\sin^3\theta}( a\cos^2\theta +b -c\cos\theta ) + \frac{1}{2\sin\theta} (2 a \cos\theta - c) + k\sin\theta \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Although the equation is highly nonlinear, there is only one equation to solve for, it was obtained directly, and the cyclic coordinates are not involved.

By contrast, the Lagrangian approach leads to ''three'' nonlinear coupled equations to solve, despite the absence of the coordinates {{math|''ψ''}} and {{math|''φ''}} in the Lagrangian.

The {{math|''θ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} \quad\Rightarrow \quad I_1\ddot{\theta} = (I_1- I_3)\dot{\phi}^2\sin\theta\cos\theta -I_3\dot{\psi}\dot{\phi}\sin\theta +Mg\ell\sin\theta\,,&lt;/math&gt;

the {{math|''ψ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\psi}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \psi} \quad\Rightarrow \quad  \ddot{\psi} +  \ddot{\phi}\cos\theta - \dot{\phi}\dot{\theta}\sin\theta= 0 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and the {{math|''φ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi} \quad\Rightarrow \quad \ddot{\phi}(I_1\sin^2\theta + I_3\cos^2\theta) + \dot{\phi}(I_1 - I_3)2\sin\theta\cos\theta\dot{\theta} + I_3\ddot{\psi}\cos\theta - I_3\dot{\psi}\sin\theta\dot{\theta} =0 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

=== Velocity-dependent potentials ===

==== Classical charged particle in a uniform magnetic field ====
[[File:Charged particle in uniform B field.svg|thumb|300px|Classical charged particle in uniform '''B''' field, using cylindrical coordinates. '''Top:''' If the radial coordinate {{math|''r''}} and angular velocity {{math|''dθ''/''dt''}} vary, the trajectory is a helicoid with varying radius but uniform motion in the {{math|''z''}} direction. '''Bottom:''' Constant {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''dθ''/''dt''}} means a helicoid with constant radius.]]

Consider a classical [[charged particle]] of mass {{math|''m''}} and [[electric charge]] {{math|''q''}} in a static (time-independent) uniform (constant throughout space) [[magnetic field]] {{math|'''B'''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kibble|Berkshire|2004|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lagrangian for a charged particle in a general [[electromagnetic field]] given by the [[magnetic potential]] {{math|'''A'''}} and [[electric potential]] {{math|''φ''}} is

:&lt;math&gt;L = \frac{m}{2} \dot{\mathbf{r}}^2 - q \phi + q \dot{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{A} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

It is convenient to use [[cylindrical coordinates]] {{math|(''r'', ''θ'', ''z'')}}, so that

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{r}} = \mathbf{v} = (v_r, v_\theta,v_z) = (\dot{r},r\dot{\theta},\dot{z}) \,, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = (B_r,B_\theta,B_z) = (0,0,B)\,. &lt;/math&gt;

In this case the electric potential is zero, {{math|''φ'' {{=}} 0}}, and we can choose the axial gauge for the magnetic potential

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{B}\times\mathbf{r} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{A} = (A_r,A_\theta,A_z) = (0,Br/2,0)\,, &lt;/math&gt;

and the Lagrangian is

:&lt;math&gt;L(r,\dot{r},\dot{\theta},\dot{z}) = \frac{m}{2} (\dot{r}^2 + r^2\dot{\theta}^2 + \dot{z}^2) + \frac{qB r^2\dot{\theta}}{2} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Notice this potential has an effectively cylindrical symmetry (although it also has angular velocity dependence), since the only spatial dependence is on the radial length from an imaginary cylinder axis.

There are two cyclic coordinates, {{math|''θ''}} and {{math|''z''}}. The canonical momenta conjugate to {{math|''θ''}} and {{math|''z''}} are the constants

:&lt;math&gt;p_{\theta} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot {\theta}} = mr^2\dot {\theta} + \frac{qBr^2}{2}  \,,\quad p_z = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot {z}} = m\dot{z} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

so the velocities are

:&lt;math&gt;\dot {\theta} = \frac{1}{mr^2}\left(p_\theta - \frac{qBr^2}{2}\right) \,,\quad \dot{z} = \frac{p_z}{m}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The angular momentum about the ''z'' axis is ''not'' {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, but the quantity {{math|''mr''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''dθ''/''dt''}}, which is not conserved due to the contribution from the magnetic field. The canonical momentum {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the conserved quantity. It is still the case that {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the linear or translational momentum along the ''z'' axis, which is also conserved.

The radial component {{math|''r''}} and angular velocity {{math|''dθ''/''dt''}} can vary with time, but {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is constant, and since {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is constant it follows {{math|''dz''/''dt''}} is constant. The Routhian can take the form

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
R(r,\dot{r}) &amp; = p_{\theta}\dot{\theta}+p_z\dot{z} - L \\
&amp; = p_{\theta}\dot{\theta}+p_z\dot{z} - \frac{m}{2}\dot r^2 - \frac{p_\theta\dot{\theta}}{2} - \frac{p_z\dot{z}}{2} - \frac{1}{2}qBr^2\dot{\theta} \\ 
&amp; =  (p_\theta - qBr^2 )\frac{\dot{\theta}}{2} - \frac{m}{2}\dot r^2 + \frac{p_z\dot{z}}{2} \\ 
&amp; = \frac{1}{2mr^2} \left(p_\theta - qBr^2 \right)\left(p_\theta - \frac{qBr^2}{2} \right) - \frac{m}{2}\dot{r}^2 + \frac{p_z^2}{2m} \\
&amp; = \frac{1}{2mr^2} \left(p_\theta^2 - \frac{3}{2}qBr^2  + \frac{(qB)^2r^4}{2} \right) - \frac{m}{2}\dot{r}^2  
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where in the last line, the {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''/2''m''}} term is a constant and can be ignored without loss of continuity. The Hamiltonian equations for {{math|''θ''}} and {{math|''z''}} automatically vanish and do not need to be solved for. The Lagrangian equation in {{math|''r''}}

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{r}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial r} &lt;/math&gt;

is by direct calculation

:&lt;math&gt;-m\ddot{r} = \frac{1}{2m}\left[\frac{-2}{r^3} \left(p_\theta^2 - \frac{3}{2}qBr^2  + \frac{(qB)^2 r^4}{2} \right) + \frac{1}{r^2}(- 3qBr + 2(qB)^2r^3)\right] \,, &lt;/math&gt;

which after collecting terms is

:&lt;math&gt;m\ddot{r}=\frac{1}{2m}\left[\frac{2p_{\theta}^2}{r^3}-(qB)^2 r\right] \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and simplifying further by introducing the constants

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{p_{\theta}^2}{m^2} \,,\quad b = - \frac{(qB)^2}{2m^2} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

the differential equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{r} = \frac{a}{r^3} + br  &lt;/math&gt;

To see how {{math|''z''}} changes with time, integrate the momenta expression for {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}} above

:&lt;math&gt; z = \frac{p_z}{m}t + c_z \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''c&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is an arbitrary constant, the initial value of {{math|''z''}} to be specified in the [[initial conditions]].

The motion of the particle in this system is [[helicoid]]al, with the axial motion uniform (constant) but the radial and angular components varying in a spiral according to the equation of motion derived above. The initial conditions on {{math|''r''}}, {{math|''dr''/''dt''}}, {{math|''θ''}}, {{math|''dθ''/''dt''}}, will determine if the trajectory of the particle has a constant {{math|''r''}} or varying {{math|''r''}}. If initially {{math|''r''}} is nonzero but {{math|''dr''/''dt'' {{=}} 0}}, while {{math|''θ''}} and {{math|''dθ''/''dt''}} are arbitrary, then the initial velocity of the particle has no radial component, {{math|''r''}} is constant, so the motion will be in a perfect helix. If ''r'' is constant, the angular velocity is also constant according to the conserved {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

With the Lagrangian approach, the equation for {{math|''r''}} would include {{math|''dθ''/''dt''}} which has to be eliminated, and there would be equations for {{math|''θ''}} and {{math|''z''}} to solve for.

The {{math|''r''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{r}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial r} \quad\Rightarrow\quad m\ddot{r} = mr\dot{\theta}^2 + qBr\dot{\theta} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

the {{math|''θ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} \quad\Rightarrow\quad m(2r\dot{r}\dot {\theta} + r^2\ddot {\theta}) + qBr\dot{r} = 0 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and the {{math|''z''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{z}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial z} \quad\Rightarrow\quad m\ddot{z} = 0 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The {{math|''z''}} equation is trivial to integrate, but the {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''θ''}} equations are not, in any case the time derivatives are mixed in all the equations and must be eliminated.

'''Sketch Engine''' is a corpus manager and [[text analysis]] software developed by Lexical Computing Limited since 2003. Its purpose is to enable people studying language behaviour ([[lexicographers]], researchers in  [[corpus linguistics]], translators or language learners) to search large text collections according to complex and linguistically motivated queries. Sketch Engine gained its name after one of the key features, [[word sketch]]es: one-page, automatic, corpus-derived summaries of a word's grammatical and collocational behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kilgarriff|first1=Adam|last2=Baisa|first2=Vít|last3=Bušta|first3=Jan|last4=Jakubíček|first4=Miloš|last5=Kovář|first5=Vojtěch|last6=Michelfeit|first6=Jan|last7=Rychlý|first7=Pavel|last8=Suchomel|first8=Vít|title=The Sketch Engine: ten years on|journal=Lexicography|date=10 July 2014|volume=1|issue=1|pages=7–36|doi=10.1007/s40607-014-0009-9|issn=2197-4292|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40607-014-0009-9|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it supports and provides corpora in 90+ languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/user-guide/user-manual/corpora/by-language/ |title= Languages in Sketch Engine |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Sketch Engine |publisher=Lexical Computing s.r.o. |access-date=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of development ==
Sketch Engine is a product of Lexical Computing Limited, a company founded in 2003 by the lexicographer and research scientist [[Adam Kilgarriff]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kilgarriff.co.uk Adam Kilgarriff's home page]&lt;/ref&gt; He started collaboration with Pavel Rychlý, a computer scientist working at the Natural Language Processing Centre at [[Masaryk University]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://nlp.fi.muni.cz Natural Language Processing Centre, Masaryk University]&lt;/ref&gt; and the developer of Manatee and Bonito (two major parts of the software suite), and introduced the concept of [[word sketch]]es.

Since then, Sketch Engine has been commercial software, however all the core features of Manatee and Bonito that were developed by 2003 (and extended since then) are freely available under the [[GPL]] license within the NoSketch Engine suite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/trac/noske NoSketch Engine]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
* [[Word sketch]]es – a one-page automatic derived summary of a word’s grammatical and collocational behaviour
* Word sketch difference – compares and contrasts two words by analysing their collocation
* Distributional [[Thesaurus]] – automated thesaurus finding words with similar meaning or appearing in the same/similar context
* [[Concordance (publishing)|Concordance]] search – finds examples of a word form, lemma, phrase, tag or complex structure
* [[Collocation]] search – word co-occurrence analysis displaying the most frequent words (to a search word) which can be regarded as collocation candidates
* Word lists – generates frequency lists which can be filtered with complex criteria
* [[n-gram]]s – generates frequency lists of multi-word expressions
* [[Terminology extraction|Terminology]] / [[Keyword (linguistics)|Keyword]] extraction (both monolingual and bilingual) – automatic extraction key words and multi-word terms from texts (based on frequency count and linguistic criteria)
* Diachronic analysis ([[Trend analysis|Trends]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kilgarriff|first1=Adam|last2=Herman|first2=Ondřej|last3=Bušta|first3=Jan|last4=Rychlý|first4=Pavel|last5=Jakubíček|first5=Miloš|title=DIACRAN: a framework for diachronic analysis|journal=Corpus Linguistics 2015|date=2015|pages=65–70|url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Diacran_CL2015.pdf|publisher=Lancaster: UCREL}}&lt;/ref&gt; – detecting words which undergo changes in the frequency of use in time (show trending words)
* Corpus building and management – create corpora from the Web or uploaded texts including [[part-of-speech tagging]] and [[lemmatization]] which can be used as [[data mining]] software
* [[Parallel corpus]] (bilingual) facilities – looking up translation examples (EUR-Lex corpus, [[Europarl corpus]], OPUS corpus, etc.) or building parallel corpus from own aligned texts

== Architecture ==
[[File:Thesaurus in Sketch Engine.png|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Sketch Engine thesaurus page|Thesaurus cloud of the lemma ''work'' in Sketch Engine]]

Sketch Engine consists of three main components: an underlying [[database management system]] called Manatee, a web interface search front-end called Bonito and a web interface for corpus building and management called Corpus Architect.
&lt;ref name="bonito"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rychlý|first1=Pavel|title=Manatee/bonito–a modular corpus manager|journal=1st Workshop on Recent Advances in Slavonic Natural Language Processing|date=2007|pages=65–70|url=http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/raslan/2007/raslan07.pdf#page=73|publisher=Masaryk University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manatee ===

Manatee is a [[database management system]] specifically devised for effective indexing of large text corpora. It is based on the idea of [[inverted index]]ing (keeping an index of all positions of a given word in the text). It has been used to index text corpora comprising tens of billions of words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pomikálek|first1=Jan|last2=Jakubíček|first2=Miloš|last3=Rychlý|first3=Pavel|title=Building a 70 billion word corpus of English from ClueWeb|journal=Proceedings of the Eight International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC'12)|date=2012|url=http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2012/pdf/1047_Paper.pdf|publisher=European Language Resources Association (ELRA)|location=Istanbul, Turkey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Searching corpora indexed by Manatee is performed by formulating queries in the Corpus Query Language (CQL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/documentation/corpus-querying/ |title=CQL – Corpus Query Language |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Sketch Engine |publisher=Lexical Computing s.r.o. |access-date=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manatee is written in [[C++]] and offers an [[API]] for a number of other programming languages including [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Perl]] and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]. Recently, it was rewritten into [[Go (programming language)|Go]] for faster processing of corpus queries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rychlý|first1=Pavel|last2=Rábara|first2=Radoslav|title=Concurrent Processing of Text Corpus Queries|journal=Workshop on Recent Advances in Slavonic Natural Language Processing|date=2015|pages=49–58|url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Concurrent_Processing_2015.pdf|publisher=Masaryk University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bonito ===

Bonito is a web interface for Manatee providing access to corpus search. In the [[client–server model]], Manatee is the server and Bonito plays the client part. It is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].&lt;ref name="bonito" /&gt;

=== Corpus Architect ===

Corpus Architect is a web interface providing corpus building and management features. It is also written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].

== Applications ==
Sketch Engine has been used by major British or other publishing houses for producing dictionaries such as [[Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners|Macmillan English Dictionary]], [[Dictionnaires Le&amp;nbsp;Robert]], [[Oxford University Press]] or [[Shogakukan]] and four of the UK’s five biggest dictionary publishers use Sketch Engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://impact.ref.ac.uk/CaseStudies/CaseStudy.aspx?Id=39760 |title=Using Computational Lexicography for Dictionary Production with the Sketch Engine

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19901">In [[mathematics]], a '''t-norm''' (also '''T-norm''' or, unabbreviated, '''triangular norm''') is a kind of [[binary operation]] used in the framework of [[probabilistic metric space]]s and in [[multi-valued logic]], specifically in [[fuzzy logic]]. A t-norm generalizes [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] in a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] and [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] in [[logic]]. The name ''triangular norm'' refers to the fact that in the framework of probabilistic metric spaces t-norms are used to generalize [[triangle inequality]] of ordinary [[metric space]]s.

== Definition ==

A t-norm is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] T: [0,&amp;nbsp;1] &amp;times; [0,&amp;nbsp;1] → [0,&amp;nbsp;1] which satisfies the following properties:
* [[Commutativity]]: T(''a'', ''b'') = T(''b'', ''a'')
* [[Monotonicity]]: T(''a'', ''b'') ≤ T(''c'', ''d'') if ''a'' ≤ ''c'' and ''b'' ≤ ''d''
* [[Associativity]]: T(''a'', T(''b'', ''c'')) = T(T(''a'', ''b''), ''c'')
* The number 1 acts as [[identity element]]: T(''a'', 1) = ''a''

Since a t-norm is a [[binary operation|binary algebraic operation]] on the interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1], infix algebraic notation is also common, with the t-norm usually denoted by&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;.

The defining conditions of the t-norm are exactly those of the partially ordered Abelian monoid on the real unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. '' (Cf.&amp;nbsp;[[ordered group]].)'' The monoidal operation of any partially ordered Abelian monoid ''L'' is therefore by some authors called a ''triangular norm on L''.

=== Motivations and applications ===

T-norms are a generalization of the usual two-valued [[logical conjunction]], studied by classical logic, for [[fuzzy logic]]s. Indeed, the classical Boolean conjunction is both commutative and associative. The monotonicity property ensures that the [[degree of truth]] of conjunction does not decrease if the [[truth value]]s of conjuncts increase. The requirement that 1 be an identity element corresponds to the interpretation of 1 as ''true'' (and consequently 0 as ''false''). Continuity, which is often required from fuzzy conjunction as well, expresses the idea that, roughly speaking, very small changes in truth values of conjuncts should not macroscopically affect the truth value of their conjunction.

T-norms are also used to construct the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of [[fuzzy set]]s or as a basis for aggregation operators (see [[fuzzy set operations]]). In [[probabilistic metric space]]s, t-norms are used to generalize [[triangle inequality]] of ordinary metric spaces. Individual t-norms may of course frequently occur in further disciplines of mathematics, since the class contains many familiar functions.

=== Classification of t-norms ===

A t-norm is called ''continuous'' if it is [[continuous function|continuous]] as a function, in the usual interval topology on [0,&amp;nbsp;1]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. (Similarly for ''left-'' and ''right-continuity''.)

A t-norm is called ''strict'' if it is continuous and [[monotonic function|strictly monotone]].

A t-norm is called ''nilpotent'' if it is continuous and each ''x'' in the open interval (0,&amp;nbsp;1) is its [[nilpotent]] element, i.e., there is a natural number ''n'' such that ''x'' &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; ... &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' (''n''&amp;nbsp;times) equals&amp;nbsp;0.

A t-norm &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is called ''Archimedean'' if it has the [[Archimedean property]], i.e., if for each ''x'', ''y'' in the open interval (0,&amp;nbsp;1) there is a natural number ''n'' such that ''x'' &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; ... &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' (''n''&amp;nbsp;times) is less than or equal to ''y''.

The usual partial ordering of t-norms is pointwise, i.e.,
: T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;nbsp; if &amp;nbsp; T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'', ''b'') ≤ T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'', ''b'') for all ''a'', ''b'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].
As functions, pointwise larger t-norms are sometimes called ''stronger'' than those pointwise smaller. In the semantics of fuzzy logic, however, the larger a t-norm, the ''weaker'' (in terms of logical strength) conjunction it represents.

==Prominent examples==

*'''Minimum t-norm''' &lt;math&gt;\top_{\mathrm{min}}(a, b) = \min \{a, b\},&lt;/math&gt; also called the '''Gödel t-norm''', as it is the standard semantics for conjunction in [[Gödel fuzzy logic]]. Besides that, it occurs in most t-norm based fuzzy logics as the standard semantics for weak conjunction. It is the pointwise largest t-norm (see the [[#Properties of t-norms|properties of t-norms]] below).

[[File:ProductTnorm-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the product t-norm]]
*'''Product t-norm''' &lt;math&gt;\top_{\mathrm{prod}}(a, b) = a \cdot b&lt;/math&gt; (the ordinary product of real numbers). Besides other uses, the product t-norm is the standard semantics for strong conjunction in [[product fuzzy logic]]. It is a strict Archimedean t-norm.

[[File:LukasiewiczTnorm-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the Łukasiewicz t-norm]]
*'''Łukasiewicz t-norm''' &lt;math&gt;\top_{\mathrm{Luk}}(a, b) = \max \{0, a+b-1\}.&lt;/math&gt; The name comes from the fact that the t-norm is the standard semantics for strong conjunction in [[Łukasiewicz fuzzy logic]]. It is a nilpotent Archimedean t-norm, pointwise smaller than the product t-norm.

[[File:DrasticTnorm-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the drastic t-norm. The function is discontinuous at the lines 0 &amp;lt; ''x'' = 1 and 0 &amp;lt; ''y'' = 1.]]

\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:The name reflects the fact that the drastic t-norm is the pointwise smallest t-norm (see the [[#Properties of t-norms|properties of t-norms]] below). It is a right-continuous Archimedean t-norm.

    \min(a,b) &amp; \mbox{if }a+b &gt; 1 \\
    0         &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:is a standard example of a t-norm which is left-continuous, but not continuous. Despite its name, the nilpotent minimum is not a nilpotent t-norm.

[[File:HamacherProduct-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the Hamacher product]]
*'''Hamacher product'''
::&lt;math&gt;\top_{\mathrm{H}_0}(a, b) = \begin{cases}
    0                 &amp; \mbox{if } a=b=0 \\
    \frac{ab}{a+b-ab} &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:is a strict Archimedean t-norm, and an important representative of the parametric classes of [[Construction of t-norms#Hamacher t-norms|Hamacher t-norms]] and [[Construction of t-norms#Schweizer–Sklar t-norms|Schweizer–Sklar t-norms]].

==Properties of t-norms==

The drastic t-norm is the pointwise smallest t-norm and the minimum is the pointwise largest t-norm:
:&lt;math&gt;\top_{\mathrm{D}}(a, b)  \le \top(a, b) \le \mathrm{\top_{min}}(a, b),&lt;/math&gt; for any t-norm &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; and all ''a'', ''b'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].

For every t-norm T, the number 0 acts as null element: T(''a'', 0) = 0 for all ''a'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].

A t-norm T has [[zero divisor]]s if and only if it has [[nilpotent element|nilpotent]] elements; each nilpotent element of T is also a zero divisor of T. The set of all nilpotent elements is an interval [0,&amp;nbsp;''a''] or [0,&amp;nbsp;''a''), for some ''a'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].

=== Properties of continuous t-norms ===

Although real functions of two variables can be continuous in each variable without being continuous on [0,&amp;nbsp;1]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, this is not the case with t-norms: a t-norm T is continuous if and only if it is continuous in one variable, i.e., if and only if the functions ''f&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') = T(''x'', ''y'') are continuous for each ''y'' in  [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Analogous theorems hold for left- and right-continuity of a t-norm.

A continuous t-norm is Archimedean if and only if 0 and 1 are its only [[idempotent]]s.

A continuous Archimedean t-norm is strict if 0 is its only [[nilpotent]] element; otherwise it is nilpotent. By definition, moreover, a continuous Archimedean t-norm T is nilpotent if and only if ''each'' ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;1 is a nilpotent element of T. Thus with a continuous Archimedean t-norm T, either all or none of the elements of (0,&amp;nbsp;1) are nilpotent. If it is the case that all elements in (0,&amp;nbsp;1) are nilpotent, then the t-norm is isomorphic to the Łukasiewicz t-norm; i.e., there is a strictly increasing function ''f'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;\top(x,y) = f^{-1}(\top_{\mathrm{Luk}}(f(x), f(y))).&lt;/math&gt;
If on the other hand it is the case that there are no nilpotent elements of T, the t-norm is isomorphic to the product t-norm. In other words, all nilpotent t-norms are isomorphic, the Łukasiewicz t-norm being their prototypical representative; and all strict t-norms are isomorphic, with the product t-norm as their prototypical example. The Łukasiewicz t-norm is itself isomorphic to the product t-norm undercut at 0.25, i.e., to the function ''p''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') = max(0.25, ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;''y'') on [0.25,&amp;nbsp;1]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

For each continuous t-norm, the set of its idempotents is a closed subset of [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Its complement — the set of all elements which are not idempotent — is therefore a union of countably many non-overlapping open intervals. The restriction of the t-norm to any of these intervals (including its endpoints) is Archimedean, and thus isomorphic either to the Łukasiewicz t-norm or the product t-norm. For such ''x'', ''y'' that do not fall into the same open interval of non-idempotents, the t-norm evaluates to the minimum of ''x'' and ''y''. These conditions actually give a characterization of continuous t-norms, called the '''Mostert–Shields theorem''', since every continuous t-norm can in this way be decomposed, and the described construction always yields a continuous t-norm. The theorem can also be formulated as follows:
:A t-norm is continuous if and only if it is isomorphic to an [[Construction of t-norms#Ordinal sums|ordinal sum]] of the minimum, Łukasiewicz, and product t-norm.

A similar characterization theorem for non-continuous t-norms is not known (not even for left-continuous ones), only some non-exhaustive methods for the [[construction of t-norms]] have been found.

== Residuum ==

For any left-continuous t-norm &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt;, there is a unique binary operation &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; on [0,&amp;nbsp;1] such that
:&lt;math&gt;\top(z, x) \le y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;z \le (x \Rightarrow y)&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. This operation is called the ''residuum'' of the t-norm. In prefix notation, the residuum to a t-norm &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; is often denoted by &lt;math&gt;\vec{\top}&lt;/math&gt; or by the letter R.

The interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] equipped with a t-norm and its residuum forms a [[residuated lattice]]. The relation between a t-norm T and its residuum R is an instance of [[adjoint functors#Posets|adjunction]] (specifically, a [[Galois connection]]): the residuum forms a right adjoint R(''x'', –) to the functor T(–, ''x'') for each ''x'' in the lattice [0,&amp;nbsp;1] taken as a [[poset]] category.

In the standard semantics of t-norm based fuzzy logics, where conjunction is interpreted by a t-norm, the residuum plays the role of implication (often called ''R-implication'').

=== Basic properties of residua ===

If &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; is the residuum of a left-continuous t-norm &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;(x \Rightarrow y) = \sup\{z\mid\top(z,x) \le y\}.&lt;/math&gt;
Consequently, for all ''x'', ''y'' in the unit interval,
:&lt;math&gt;(x \Rightarrow y) = 1&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x \le y&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;(1 \Rightarrow y) = y.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is a left-continuous t-norm and &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; its residuum, then
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl}
  \min(x,y)  &amp; \ge &amp; x * (x \Rightarrow y) \\
  \max(x, y) &amp; =   &amp; \min((x \Rightarrow y)\Rightarrow y, (y \Rightarrow x)\Rightarrow x).
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, then equality holds in the former.

=== Residua of prominent left-continuous t-norms ===

If ''x'' ≤ ''y'', then R(''x'', ''y'') = 1 for any residuum R. The following table therefore gives the values of prominent residua only for ''x'' &amp;gt; ''y''.

== T-conorms ==

'''T-conorms''' (also called '''S-norms''') are dual to t-norms under the order-reversing operation which assigns 1&amp;nbsp;– ''x'' to ''x'' on [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Given a t-norm &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt;, the complementary conorm is defined by
: &lt;math&gt;\bot(a,b) = 1-\top(1-a, 1-b).&lt;/math&gt;
This generalizes [[De Morgan's laws]].

It follows that a t-conorm satisfies the following conditions, which can be used for an equivalent axiomatic definition of t-conorms independently of t-norms:
* Commutativity: ⊥(''a'', ''b'') = ⊥(''b'', ''a'')
* Monotonicity: ⊥(''a'', ''b'') ≤ ⊥(''c'', ''d'') if ''a'' ≤ ''c'' and ''b'' ≤ ''d''
* Associativity: ⊥(''a'', ⊥(''b'', ''c'')) = ⊥(⊥(''a'', ''b''), ''c'')
* Identity element: ⊥(''a'', 0) = ''a''

T-conorms are used to represent [[logical disjunction]] in [[fuzzy logic]] and [[union (set theory)|union]] in [[fuzzy set theory]].

===Examples of t-conorms===

Important t-conorms are those dual to prominent t-norms:

[[File:MaximumTconorm-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the maximum t-conorm (3D and contours)]]
*'''Maximum t-conorm''' &lt;math&gt;\bot_{\mathrm{max}}(a, b) = \max \{a, b\}&lt;/math&gt;, dual to the minimum t-norm, is the smallest t-conorm (see the [[#Properties of t-conorms|properties of t-conorms]] below). It is the standard semantics for disjunction in [[Gödel fuzzy logic]] and for weak disjunction in all t-norm based fuzzy logics.

[[File:ProbabilisticSum-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the probabilistic sum]]
*'''Probabilistic sum''' &lt;math&gt;\bot_{\mathrm{sum}}(a, b) = a + b - a \cdot b&lt;/math&gt; is dual to the product t-norm. In [[probability theory]] it expresses the probability of the union of independent [[event (probability theory)|event]]s. It is also the standard semantics for strong disjunction in such extensions of [[product fuzzy logic]] in which it is definable (e.g., those containing involutive negation).

[[File:BoundedSum-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the bounded sum t-conorm]]
*'''Bounded sum''' &lt;math&gt;\bot_{\mathrm{Luk}}(a, b) = \min \{a+b, 1\}&lt;/math&gt; is dual to the Łukasiewicz t-norm. It is the standard semantics for strong disjunction in [[Łukasiewicz fuzzy logic]].

[[File:DrasticTconorm-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the drastic t-conorm. The function is discontinuous at the lines 1 &amp;gt; ''x'' = 0 and 1 &amp;gt; ''y'' = 0.]]
*'''Drastic t-conorm'''
::&lt;math&gt;\bot_{\mathrm{D}}(a, b) = \begin{cases}
  b &amp; \mbox{if }a=0 \\
  a &amp; \mbox{if }b=0 \\
  1 &amp; \mbox{otherwise,}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:dual to the drastic t-norm, is the largest t-conorm (see the [[#Properties of t-conorms|properties of t-conorms]] below).

[[File:NilpotentMaximum-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the nilpotent maximum. The function is discontinuous at the line 0 &amp;lt; ''x'' = 1 – ''y'' &amp;lt; 1.]]
*'''Nilpotent maximum''', dual to the nilpotent minimum:
::&lt;math&gt;\bot_{\mathrm{nM}}(a, b) = \begin{cases}
    \max(a,b) &amp; \mbox{if }a+b &lt; 1 \\
    1         &amp; \mbox{otherwise.}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:EinsteinSum-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the Einstein sum]]
*'''Einstein sum''' (compare the [[velocity-addition formula]] under special relativity)
::&lt;math&gt;\bot_{\mathrm{H}_2}(a, b) = \frac{a+b}{1+ab}&lt;/math&gt;
:is a dual to one of the [[Construction of t-norms#Hamacher t-norms|Hamacher t-norms]].

===Properties of t-conorms===

Many properties of t-conorms can be obtained by dualizing the properties of t-norms, for example:
* For any t-conorm ⊥, the number 1 is an annihilating element: ⊥(''a'', 1) = 1, for any ''a'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].
* Dually to t-norms, all t-conorms are bounded by the maximum and the drastic t-conorm:
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\bot_{max}}(a, b) \le \bot(a, b) \le \bot_{\mathrm{D}}(a, b)&lt;/math&gt;, for any t-conorm &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; and all ''a'', ''b'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].

Further properties result from the relationships between t-norms and t-conorms or their interplay with other operators, e.g.:
* A t-norm T [[distributivity|distributes]] over a t-conorm ⊥, i.e.,
::T(''x'', ⊥(''y'', ''z'')) = ⊥(T(''x'', ''y''), T(''x'', ''z'')) for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1],
:if and only if ⊥ is the maximum t-conorm. Dually, any t-conorm distributes over the minimum, but not over any other t-norm.

===Non-standard negators===

A '''negator''' &lt;math&gt;n:[0,1] \to [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Monotonic function#Monotonicity in functional analysis|monotonous]] falling, i. e. order-reversion mapping with &lt;math&gt;n(0) = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n(1) = 0&lt;/math&gt; (in other notation: &lt;math&gt;0 \mapsto 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1 \mapsto 0&lt;/math&gt;). 
A negator n is called
* '''strict''' in case of strict monotonocity 
* '''strong''' if it is strict and involutive (see: [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]]): [[Universal quantification#notation|&lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;]] &lt;math&gt;x \in [0,1]: n(n(x)) = x&lt;/math&gt;.
The standard (canonical) negator is 
&lt;math&gt;n(x) = 1 - x, x \in [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt;, 
which appears to be strong. As the standard negator is used in the above definition of a t-norm/t-conorm pair, this can be generalized as follows:

A '''De Morgan Triplet''' is a triple (T,⊥,n) [[iff]] (if and only if)
# T is a t-norm
# ⊥ is a t-conorm according to the axiomatic definition of t-conorms as mentioned above
# n is a strong negator
# &lt;math&gt;\forall a,b \in [0, 1]: \,n(\perp(a, b)) = T(n(a), n(b))&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Technology trajectory''' refers to a single branch in the evolution of a technological design of a product/service, with nodes representing separate designs.

Movement along the technology trajectory is associated with research and development. Due to institutionalisation of ideas, markets and professions, a technology development can get 'stuck' within one trajectory, and firms and engineers unable to adopt to ideas and innovation from outside.

The medal is named for [[William Herbert, Dean of Manchester|William Herbert]], a noted 19th-century [[botanist]]. He published many articles in the ''[[Botanical Register]]'' and the ''[[Botanical Magazine]]'' on the subject of bulbous plants, many of which he cultivated in his own gardens. He wrote what became the standard work on the family ''[[Amaryllidaceae]]'' in 1837. He also published extensively on hybridization based on his own experiments,&lt;ref name = DNB&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Herbert, William (1778-1847)}}&lt;/ref&gt; not only on bulbs but also on other groups of plants.

'''''The Rap Year Book: The Most Important Rap Song From Every Year Since 1979, Discussed, Debated, and Deconstructed''''' is a 2015 ''[[New York Times]]'' best-selling book written by [[Shea Serrano]] and illustrated by [[Arturo Torres (artist)|Arturo Torres]].

==Development==
''The Rap Year Book'' followed Serrano's 2013 project with [[Houston]] rapper [[Bun B]], ''Bun B's Rap Coloring and Activity Book''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bacher|first1=Danielle|title=Q&amp;A: Bun B on the 'Incredible Journey' of Creating His Hip-Hop Coloring Book|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/q-a-bun-b-on-the-incredible-journey-of-creating-his-hip-hop-coloring-book-20130618|accessdate=26 August 2016|work=Rolling Stone|date=June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rap Year Book'' took 15 months to develop,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Euse|first1=Erica|title=How 'The Rap Year Book' Breaks Down the Most Important Rap Songs for Each Year Since 1979|url=http://www.complex.com/style/2015/10/a-look-inside-the-rap-year-book|accessdate=27 August 2016|work=Complex|date=October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was still without an illustrator three months before the book's due date. Serrano encountered eventual collaborator Torres via a flyer Torres had designed announcing a performance by [[Dallas]] rap group The Outfit, Texas; Serrano told ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' that on seeing Torres's work, he thought immediately, "This is the exact style that I’m trying to find."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Solomon|first1=Dan|title=Music Monday: Shea Serrano On 'The Rap Yearbook' And His Houston Hip Hop Playlist|url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/music-monday-shea-serrano-on-the-rap-yearbook-and-his-houston-hip-hop-playlist/|accessdate=23 August 2016|work=Texas Monthly|date=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serrano contacted the group's management asking for information about who had made their flyer and eventually tracked Torres down on social media; Torres agreed to work on the book.

==Publication==
''The Rap Year Book'' was published on October 13, 2015, by [[Abrams Image]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schiewe|first1=Jessie|title=Here's How One Writer Spent Way Too Long Deciding the Best Rap Song Every Year from 1979 to 2014 {{!}} NOISEY|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/shea-serrano-interview-rap-yearbook|accessdate=26 August 2016|work=Noisey|publisher=Vice|date=October 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is 240 pages with 150 full-color illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rap Year Book The Most Important Rap Song From Every Year Since 1979, Discussed, Debated, and Deconstructed|url=https://www.abramsbooks.com/product/rap-year-book_9781419718182/|website=Abrams Books|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The book is structured around essays by Serrano selecting the most important rap song for every year from 1979 to 2014.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; His text is accompanied by illustrations by Torres, "bright, colorful, and offbeat cartoons...featuring depictions of [[Kanye]] and [[Jay-Z]] on a movie poster, [[Dr. Dre]] in scrubs, [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] using a pottery wheel, and more."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fitzgerald|first1=Colin|title='The Rap Year Book' Reformats Hip-Hop History|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/the-rap-year-book-by-shea-serrano/|accessdate=23 August 2016|work=PopMatters|date=October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ice-T]] wrote the book's preface,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and critics, including [[Wesley Morris]] and [[Jessica Hopper]], contributed short rebuttals arguing for alternative choices as the most important song of a given year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Reception==

===Sales===
Propelled by Serrano's engagement with his enthusiastic [[Twitter]] following,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Locke|first1=Charley|title=How One Man and His Twitter Army Stormed the Bestseller List|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/10/rap-year-book-best-seller/|accessdate=23 August 2016|work=Wired|date=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rap Year Book'' repeatedly ranked on 2015 ''The New York Times'' best-seller lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tiffany|first1=Kaitlyn|title=The Rap Yearbook author Shea Serrano on building a tiny utopia on Twitter|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/6/12067954/shea-serrano-the-rap-yearbook-twitter-interview|accessdate=23 August 2016|work=The Verge|date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's first pressing of 20,000 copies sold out in pre-orders before ''The Rap Year Book'' even hit shelves;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crucchiola|first1=Jordan|title=The King Of Twitter: Shea Serrano Is Our New Favorite Internet Hero|url=https://www.good.is/articles/shea-serrano-basketball-and-other-things|accessdate=23 August 2016|work=GOOD|date=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a mock "feud" on Twitter between Serrano and [[Books-a-Million]] sold out the retailer's stock of the book in one day, and crashed the company's website in the process.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Reviews===
''[[PopMatters]]'' reviewed the book as "both educationally useful and shamelessly fun...tailor-made to counter every criticism levied against routine, overly generalized music retrospectives."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]'', Oliver Wang said that while Serrano's essays take a position on what constitutes the most important song of each year, "he doesn’t browbeat his reader into agreement; he writes confidently but not condescendingly. More importantly, the main pleasure in reading ''The Rap Year Book'' isn’t in agreeing with Serrano’s choices but rather in following the elliptical paths he takes to explain them."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wang|first1=Oliver|title=Top Five, Dead or Alive|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/top-five-dead-or-alive/|accessdate=26 August 2016|work=Los Angeles Review of Books|date=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptation==
In July 2017, Serrano announced that AMC would produce ''The Rap Year Book'' as a 6-part television documentary series with The Roots as executive producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Darville|first1=Jordan|title=Shea Serrano’s The Rap Yearbook To Be Made Into An AMC Documentary Series|url=http://www.thefader.com/2017/07/31/the-rap-yearbook-documentary|accessdate=29 July 2017|work=The Fader|date=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Young Lives''' is an international research project on childhood poverty that was established in 2000 and is coordinated by a team based at the [[University of Oxford]]'s Department of International Development (Queen Elizabeth House), [[Great Britain]].

Young Lives, by its declaration, is tracing the changing lives of 12,000 children in Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh), Peru and Vietnam over a 15-year period. This is the time frame set by the UN to assess progress towards the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. Through interviews, group work and case studies with the children, their parents, teachers, community representatives and others, the project is collecting information not only about their material and social circumstances, but also their perspectives on their lives and aspirations for the futures, set against the environmental and social realities of their communities.

Young Lives is following two groups of children in each country:
* 2,000 children who were born in 2001-02
* 1,000 children who were born in 1994-95.

These groups provide insights into every phase of childhood. The younger children are being tracked from infancy to their mid-teens and the older children through into adulthood, when some will become parents themselves. When this is matched with information gathered about their parents, it is possible to reveal much about the inter generational transmission of poverty, how families on the margins move in and out of poverty, and the policies that can make a real difference to their lives.

The research concentrates on 4 countries: [[Ethiopia]], [[India]] ([[Andhra Pradesh]]), [[Peru]] and [[Vietnam]], chosen because they reflect a wide range of cultural, political, geographical and social contexts. They face some of the common issues experienced by developing countries, such as high debt burden, post-conflict reconstruction and adverse environmental conditions such as drought and flood. By covering these countries, Young Lives aims to reveal patterns, commonalities and differences in four very different contexts where childhood - especially childhood poverty - is changing.

The project is core-funded by the UK [[Department for International Development]] (DFID), with sub-studies funded by [[International Development Research Center]] (IDRC) (in [[Ethiopia]]), [[UNICEF]] (in [[India]]), [[Irish Aid]] (in Vietnam) and the [[Bernard van Leer Foundation]] (in [[India]] and [[Peru]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/page.aspx?&amp;sitesectionid=904&amp;sitesectiontitle=Young+Lives Centre for Longitudinal Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Declared objectives ==
* provide good-quality information about the lives of children in different contexts;
* identify ways poverty affects children’s lives and their future prospects;
* better understand how poverty is transferred from one generation to another;
* trace linkages between key policy changes and children’s well-being;
* promote effective and sustainable poverty reduction policies;
* build capacity for and understanding of longitudinal research in the four study countries.
