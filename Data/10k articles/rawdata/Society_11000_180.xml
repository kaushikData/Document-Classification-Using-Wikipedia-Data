'''Abdul Salam Azimi''' ([[Pashto language|Pashto]]: عبدالسلام عظیمی, born: 1936) in [[Farah Province]]) was the [[Chief Justice of Afghanistan]] and, as such, the head of the [[Afghan Supreme Court]] from May 2006 to October 2014, when he resigned his position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Acting Chief Justice Abdul Salam Azimi resigns|author=Khaama Press|date=2014-10-23|publisher=[[Khaama Press]]|url=http://www.khaama.com/acting-chief-justice-abdul-salam-azimi-resigns-6867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A former [[professor]] at the [[University of Nebraska at Omaha]] in the [[United States]], Azimi served as legal advisor to [[President of Afghanistan|Afghan President]] [[Hamid Karzai]] and assisted with writing the 2004 [[Constitution of Afghanistan]]. He is an ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] of the [[Alizai (Pashtun tribe)|Alizai]] tribe. Prior to the Soviet Invasion of 1979, Azimi and his family resided in the Kabul province of Afghanistan and were forced to flee the country in 1981 after the fall of the Communist regime and resulting civil war. Azimi has three daughters and three sons, one being Abdul Ghafar Azimi who studied in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] and graduated from the [[University of Nebraska at Omaha]], and another is Hanan Azimi, who also studied at the [[University of Nebraska at Omaha]], and is a well-respected teacher in the Omaha area.
As chief justice, Azimi replaced [[Faisal Ahmad Shinwari]], a conservative Islamic cleric with no higher education. Azimi, in contrast, is reported to have gained a reputation as a fair-minded moderate active in upholding the [[rule of law]] and improving the country's dilapidated legal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=At the Supreme Court, an unlikely new hero|author=Kim Barker|date=2007-01-21|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chi-0701210351jan21,0,7944559.story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4063">'''Al-Mutawakkil Ahmad''' (المتوكل أحمد) (26), (full name Ahmad bin Ali bin Abbas: أحمد بن علي بن عباس) September 1756 - 10 September 1816 was an [[Imam]] of [[Yemen]] who ruled in 1809-1816. He belonged to the [[Qasimid]] family, descendants of the [[Prophet Muhammad]], which dominated the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] [[imamate]] of Yemen from 1597 to 1962.

==Taking power==

Ahmad bin Ali was a son of Imam [[al-Mansur Ali I]]. In the early 19th century, dramatic political events rocked the Zaidi state. The intervention of [[Wahhabi]] forces from the north in 1803 deprived the imam of most of the lowlands, the [[Tihamah]]. That meant the loss of vital revenues. Aggression from tribal groups outside the capital [[San'a]] further eroded the imam's power. As al-Mansur Ali I grew old and weak, intrigues arose around his person. Finally, in 1808, Prince Ahmad took power at court. This was a rather atypical event in Yemeni history, since sons usually did not rose against their fathers in power. Ahmad managed to abate the worst violence from the highland tribesmen. However, the governor of the important trading port [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]] refused to acknowledge the usurpation of power, and received assistance from the Sultan of [[Lahej]] and [[Aden]].&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Playfair, ''A History of Arabia Felix or Yemen''. Bombay 1859, pp. 129-30.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The chief of Abu Arish in the Tihamah, Sharif Hamud (d. 1818), originally a vassal under the imam, had been forced to submit to the Wahhabi movement in 1803. In 1809, however, he fell out with the pro-Wahhabi chief of Upper [[Asir]], Abu Nuqta. Sharif Hamud again proclaimed his allegiance to the Zaidi imam and restored to him the cities Luhayya, [[Hudaydah]] and [[Bayt al-Faqih]]. Abu Nuqta marched into the territory of Sharif Hamud in July 1809 and defeated him, but shortly afterwards he was himself killed in an assault by the Abu Arish warriors on his camp. This event gave Sharif Hamud a powerful position as autonomous chief in the Tihamah. In October 1809 the old imam died. Ahmad was formally elevated to the position under the name al-Mutawakkil Ahmad.

==Ottoman impact==

The new imam took a conciliatory stance to gain support. He remitted taxes, forgave some previous offences, and spent generously on the poor. The governor of Mocha laid down his arms, and died in the following year. At this time the Wahhabi movement of [[Arabia]] was vigorously attacked by the [[Egypt]]ian [[viceroy]] [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]], a formal subject of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultan. Muhammad Ali was intent on gaining power over the potentially rich lands of Yemen. He sent envoys to Sharif Hamud and to al-Mutawakkil Ahmad suggesting mutual assistance against the Wahhabi forces. The sharif gave an evasive reply. The imam was positive to the proposal but had little means to assist Muhammad Ali. The Ottoman forces were temporarily defeated by Shaykh Tami of Asir in 1814. In the next year, however, Sharif Hamud took Shaykh Tami prisoner and delivered him to the Ottomans.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Playfair, pp. 129-34.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Ottoman war against the Wahhabites was in full progress in 1816, al-Mutawakkil Ahmad died and was succeeded by his son [[al-Mahdi Abdallah]]. The latter would, within a few years, win back the Tihamah with Turkish help, at the same time putting himself in dependence of the Ottoman state.

"'''Chef Goes Nanners'''" is the seventh episode of the [[South Park (season 4)|fourth season]] of the animated television series ''[[South Park]]'', and the 55th episode of the series overall. "Chef Goes Nanners" originally aired in the [[United States]] on [[Comedy Central]] on July 5, 2000.

In the episode, Chef's passionate protest declaring the South Park flag racist inflames the entire town. The kids separate into two opposing camps and prepare to debate the issue. Stan and Kyle champion the current flag while Wendy and Cartman head up the side for a new flag. Meanwhile, Wendy Testaburger finds herself strangely attracted to Cartman.

==Plot==
[[Jimbo Kern|Jimbo]] and [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] visit [[List of recurring South Park characters#Mayor McDaniels|Mayor McDaniels']] office, arguing about the South Park town flag: Jimbo wants to keep it, for it has been around since the time of the town's founding; Chef, however, insists it is [[racism|racist]]. The South Park flag depicts four white figures [[Lynching in the United States|hanging a black one on a gallows]]. The blatant racism incites Chef's indignation and leads him to believe that the whole town is [[racist]]. Chef immediately starts to rally support in order to change the flag. Neither he nor Jimbo can gather a lot of support, as very few townspeople have strong opinions either way on the issue. In school, the class is assigned to debate the "Change the Flag" issue. Stan and Kyle lead the team that wants to keep the flag the same, while Wendy and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] lead the side that wants to change it (with Cartman only volunteering presumably to irritate Wendy). During lunch, Stan and Kyle ask Chef for help, not knowing he had just converted to [[Islam]]. Upon hearing that they think that the flag should not be changed, Chef gets agitated and verbally abusive towards the boys, who have no idea why Chef is so upset about the flag. 

Wendy leads her team in the library when Cartman suddenly interrupts the process with his own strategy. He gets the team to dig up some dirt on Stan and Kyle, hoping to win the debate with ''[[ad hominem]]'' attacks on their credibility. Meanwhile, Kyle and Stan are at Kyle's father's law office studying how freedom of speech is an issue with the flag. While this is going on, Kenny eats 60 antacid tablets, believing they were mints, and then takes a drink of water, causing him to explode. The debate team now has one less member. At the City Hall, members of the [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] march up, loudly voicing their support for the current flag as a symbol of "[[White Supremacy|white power]]". This causes discomfort amongst Jimbo, Ned, and a number of the other flag supporters: they don't wish to be sided on any issue with the Klan. To remedy this issue, Jimbo and Ned infiltrate in the clan and suggest that if they want the flag to remain unchanged they should advocate that the flag should be changed, because the majority of the people will always vote against what the Klan wants. The leader embraces the idea, and the Klan switches sides. After Ned and Jimbo escape, they run into Chef while still wearing the Klan robes. Chef believes they are in fact KKK members, and drives off in anger before they can explain. 

The mayor fails to appease Chef by revising the flag so that the man being hanged appears to be smiling, and decides not to make the decision herself. She lets the kids' debate club decide the fate of the flag. This puts a lot of pressure on Wendy, who, in their study sessions, suddenly begins to feel attracted to Cartman. This scares Wendy, because Stan's her boyfriend and she and Cartman actually hate each other. Bebe later explains the concept of [[sexual tension]] to her, advising that she should kiss Cartman just to get it out of her system. During the debate, Wendy is distracted because she is attracted to Cartman and cannot deliver her opening remarks. She walks over and kisses him in front of the whole town, breaking the built-up tension and leaving Stan shocked. After this, she is able to continue her standpoint. When the turn of Stan's team comes, Kyle gives their side of the issue by saying that killing is a natural part of life and is not a big deal. When Chef stands up and demands they address the racist aspect of the flag, he and the rest of the adults discover that the children had not even perceived that there was a racist aspect, seeing the flag as a man being hanged without registering his color, and had instead thought that the issue at hand was [[capital punishment]]. 

Chef is touched by this, and, while still acknowledging that he thinks the flag should be changed, he admits that when he believed the whole town was racist and threw the slur "cracker" around, he was the one being racist. Jimbo also apologizes for being on the KKK's side and tells Chef that he has no problem with black people, Chef in return assuring Jimbo that he recognizes Jimbo as a good man. After Jimbo and Chef decide to come to a [[compromise]], Kyle declares that they do not need to debate anymore, although Stan is still frozen with a shocked expression about Wendy kissing Cartman. In the end, [[ethnic diversity]] is added to the flag: the black man is now being hanged by a group of people of all races, including another black man. Chef delivers the moral of this story: his inclination to anti-racism almost made him a racist himself, perceiving things according to race leads only to further racism. In the final scene, Wendy says that she is glad that everything is over with and that her feelings for Cartman have disappeared. Cartman agrees and laughs nervously. Wendy runs after Stan, calling his name, leaving Cartman completely alone.

After a few moments, Cartman sighs and walks away sadly, implying that he might have started to develop genuine feelings for Wendy.

==Production==
According to the DVD commentary, the episode was based on the initial controversy over the display of the Confederate flag at the [[South Carolina State House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]|date = November 2008|title=South Park: The Complete Fourth Season: "Chef Goes Nanners" |format=Audio commentary |medium= DVD|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures#Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-creator Matt Stone has characterized "Chef Goes Nanners" as "kind of half-baked. I remember we wanted to leave the office early. We were like, 'It's July 4...

In 1978, the [[United States Congress]] made it clear that [[pregnancy discrimination|discrimination on the basis of pregnancy]] was discrimination on the basis of sex.&lt;ref name=PDA&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/pregnancy.cfm |publisher= The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission |title= The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 |date= 1978-10-31 |accessdate= 2014-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] ruled that companies that provided insurance for prescription drugs to their employees but excluded birth control were violating the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].&lt;ref name=EEOC/&gt; [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] signed the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (ACA) on 23 March 2010.

==Birth control and unintended pregnancy==
In the United States, contraceptive use saves about $19 billion in direct medical costs each year.&lt;ref name=Trussell2009&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Contraception |year=2009 |volume=79 |issue=1 |pmid=19041435 |pages=5–14 |title=Cost effectiveness of contraceptives in the United States |author1=James Trussell |author2=Anjana Lalla |author3=Quan Doan |author4=Eileen Reyes |author5=Lionel Pinto |author6=Joseph Gricar |doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2008.08.003 |pmc=3638200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About half of U.S. [[Unintended pregnancy in the United States|pregnancies are unintended]].&lt;ref name=Trussell2009/&gt; Highly effective contraceptives, such as [[intrauterine devices]] (IUDs), are underused in the United States.&lt;ref name=Cleland&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cleland K, Peipert JF, Westhoff C, Spear S, Trussell J |title=Family planning as a cost-saving preventive health service |journal=N.

==Contraceptives in schools==
Some public school districts in the [[United States]] have mandated that programs providing contraception to students be offered. One example of such schools is the [[New London High School (Connecticut)|New London High School]] in [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="Benson"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theday.com/article/20120112/NWS01/301129412/1044|title=Clinic at New London High School to offer students contraceptives|first=Judy|last=Benson|newspaper=The Day|location=New London, Connecticut|date=January 12, 2012|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory behind offering contraceptives in schools is that by offering barrier-free methods of obtaining contraception, students are more likely to use them. These programs also aim to reduce incidence of [[teen pregnancy]], as well as reduce transmission of STDs among teenagers.&lt;ref name="Brakman"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brakman |first1=Anita |last2=Borzutzky |first2=Claudia |last3=Carey |first3=Sasha |last4=Kang |first4=Melissa |last5=Kowalczyk Mullins |first5=Tanya |last6=Peter |first6=Nadja |last7=Shafii |first7=Taraneh |last8=Straub |first8=Diane M. |date=June 2017 |title=Condom Availability in Schools: A Practical Approach to the Prevention of Sexually Transmitted Infection/HIV and Unintended Pregnancy |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X1730160X |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |volume=60 |issue=6 |pages=754–757 |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2017.03.019|pmid=28532649 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandates on contraceptives in school have faced opposition from conservative groups, who believe that providing contraceptives to students will increase sexual activity.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Federal female contraception mandate before ACA==
Certain aspects of the contraception mandate did not start with the ACA. In December 2000, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] ruled that companies that provided prescription drugs to their employees but didn't provide birth control were in violation of [[Title VII|Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act]], which prevents discrimination on the basis of sex. That opinion, which the George W. Bush administration did nothing to alter or withdraw when it took office the next month, is still in effect today{{when|date=August 2016}} – and because it relies on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, it applies to all employers with 15 or more employees.&lt;ref name=EEOC&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/decision-contraception.html |publisher= The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission |title= Commission Decision on Coverage of Contraception |date= 2000-12-14 |accessdate= 2014-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently,{{when|date=August 2016}} employers that do not offer prescription coverage or do not offer insurance at all are exempt, because they treat men and women equally, but the new mandate will require prescription coverage.{{Citation needed|date = December 2013}}

After the EEOC opinion was approved in 2000, reproductive rights groups and employees who wanted birth control access sued employers that refused to comply. The next year, in ''Erickson v. Bartell Drug Co.'', a federal court{{specify|date=August 2016}} agreed with the EEOC's reasoning. Reproductive rights groups and others used that decision as leverage to force other companies to settle lawsuits and agree to change their insurance plans to include birth control. Some subsequent court decisions echoed Erickson, and some went the other way, but the rule (absent a Supreme Court decision) remained, and over the following decade, the percentage of employer-based plans offering contraceptive coverage tripled to 90%.&lt;ref name="Nick Baumann"&gt;{{cite news|title=Most of Obama's "Controversial" Birth Control Rule Was Law During Bush Years|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/02/controversial-obama-birth-control-rule-already-law|accessdate=May 26, 2012|magazine=Mother Jones|date=February 8, 2012|author=Nick Baumann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ACA mandatory coverage for contraceptives==
With the exception of churches and houses of worship, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] mandates female contraceptive coverage for all employers and educational institutions, even though the mandate itself is not included in the wording of the law(s)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcare.gov/law/full/ |title=Read the Law &amp;#124; HHS.gov/healthcare |publisher=Healthcare.gov |date= 2013-06-10|accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; passed by Congress. The mandate applies to all new health insurance plans effective August 2012. It controversially includes Christian hospitals, [[Catholic Charities|Christian charities]], [[List of Roman Catholic universities and colleges in the United States|Catholic universities]], and other enterprises owned or controlled by religious organizations that oppose contraception on doctrinal grounds.

On January 20, 2012, [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] [[Kathleen Sebelius]] announced a (then) final rule of an August 1, 2011 interim final rule on health insurance coverage with no cost sharing for [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]-approved contraceptives and contraceptive services (including female sterilization) for women of reproductive age if prescribed by health care providers, as part of women's preventive health services guidelines adopted by the [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] (HRSA) for the Affordable Care Act.

===Opposition to contraceptive mandate===
In February 2012, a major political controversy erupted with [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012|candidates for the Republican nomination for President]] viewing the regulations as a "direct attack on religious liberty".&lt;ref name=NYTGrady&gt;{{cite news|title=Ruling on Contraception Draws Battle Lines at Catholic Colleges|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/30/health/policy/law-fuels-contraception-controversy-on-catholic-campuses|accessdate=February 12, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 29, 2012|author=Denise Grady}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obama administration opt-out proposal===
In response to the criticism, the Obama administration proposed changes under which birth control medication would be provided by the insurers without direct involvement by the religious organization. Regulations were issued on March 16, 2012 for employees of enterprises controlled by religious institutions which [[self insurance|self insure]]. Further regulations were issued on March 16, 2012 which require coverage for students at institutions controlled by religious organizations which purchase insurance.

===Response to opt-out regulations===
The [[Catholic Health Association of the United States|Catholic Health Association]] (CHA) accepted this compromise.

As of January 2014, at least 28 states in the US have contraceptive mandates; however, 20 of them allow some exceptions; four of those attempt to bridge the gap by letting employees buy coverage at the group rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= State Policies in Brief: Insurance Coverage of Contraceptives |url= http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_ICC.pdf |date= 2014-01-01 |accessdate= 2014-01-25}} "28 states require insurers that cover prescription drugs to provide coverage of the full range of FDA-approved contraceptive drugs and devices; 17 of these states also cover require coverage of related outpatient services."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supreme Court review===
A number of challenges to the contraceptive mandate have been brought to the Supreme Court by different types of organizations.

====Closely held for-profit corporations====
{{main|Burwell v. Hobby Lobby}}
On June 30, 2014, the Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 in ''[[Burwell v. Hobby Lobby]]'' that under the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] (RFRA), closely held for-profit corporations are exempt from the contraceptive mandate, if they object on religious grounds, because the accommodation offered to objecting non-profits would be a less restrictive way to achieve the ACA's interest. Justice Anthony Kennedy, one of the majority justices, wrote in a concurring opinion that the government "makes the case that the mandate serves the Government’s compelling interest in providing insurance coverage that is necessary to protect the health of female employees", but that the RFRA's least-restrictive way requirement was not met because "there is an existing, recognized, workable, and already-implemented framework to provide coverage", the non-profit accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf |format=PDF |title=Supreme Court of the United States : Syllabus : BURWELL, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, ET AL. v.

====Religious institutions====
{{main|Zubik v. Burwell}}
{{anchor|Priests for Life v. HHS}}
On February 15, 2012, ''Priests for Life v. HHS'' was filed in the [[U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York]] challenging the constitutionality of the contraceptive mandate on behalf of [[Priests for Life]], a national, Catholic, pro-life organization based in [[New York City]]. The case was dismissed by U.S. District Court Judge [[Frederic Block]] for lack of ripeness because the new compromise regulations were not yet finalized.&lt;ref name="bloomberg1"&gt;{{cite news | last = Jeffrey | first = Don | title = Priests for Life’s Contraceptive Mandate Suit Dismissed | newspaper = Bloomberg | pages = | year = | date = Apr 15, 2013 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-15/priests-for-life-s-contraceptive-mandate-suit-dismissed.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanfreedomlawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Opening-Brief-Filed.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/supreme.court.to.hear.nuns.complaint.on.obamacare.contraceptive.mandate/69923.htm|title=Supreme Court to hear nuns' complaint on Obamacare contraceptive mandate {{!}} Christian News on Christian Today|website=www.christiantoday.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 6, 2015 the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decided it will review the case combined with 6 other similar challenges to the contraceptive mandate.&lt;ref name="scotusblog.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2015/11/court-to-hear-birth-control-challenges/|title=Court to hear birth-control challenges (UPDATED) - SCOTUSblog|date=2015-11-06|work=SCOTUSblog|access-date=2017-09-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/06/politics/supreme-court-obamacare-contraception-mandate/index.html|title=Supreme Court to hear new challenge to Obamacare - CNNPolitics|first=Ariane de Vogue, CNN Supreme Court|last=Reporter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case is titled ''[[Zubik v.

===Trump administration change===
In 2017, the Trump administration issued a ruling letting insurers and employers refuse to provide birth control if doing so went against their "religious beliefs" or "moral convictions".&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;

===Reactions===
More Democratic politicians favor these mandates than Republican politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Geiger |first=Kim |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2017527777_contraceptives17.html |title=Before now, GOP backed contraceptive mandates &amp;#124; The Seattle Times |publisher=Seattletimes.nwsource.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Boxer]], Democratic Party Senator for California, and [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] favor the Obama policy.&lt;ref name=divides&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/09/obama-birth-control-mandate-divides-congress_n_1266755.html |title=Obama Birth Control Mandate Divides Democrats |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- great place to insert their reasons in favor of it --&gt;

[[Darrell Issa]], a Republican congressman from California, said that Americans are divided on this issue: "While some Americans may not feel that forcing them to pay for contraception are an infringement on their religious beliefs, others consider it to be an assault against their freedom of conscience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oversight.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1598%3A2-16-12-qlines-crossed-separation-of-church-and-state-has-the-obama-administration-trampled-on-freedom-of-religion-and-freedom-of-conscienceq&amp;catid=12&amp;Itemid=20 |title=Home &amp;#124; Committee on Oversight &amp; Government Reform |publisher=Oversight.house.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issa's [[2012 Hearing on religious freedom|February 2012 hearing]] on the matter was criticized for including only men from conservative religious institutions, and no women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/16/contraception-hearing-house-democrats-walk-out_n_1281730.html |title=House Democrats Walk Out Of One-Sided Hearing On Contraception, Calling It An 'Autocratic Regime' |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2012-02-16 |accessdate=2015-03-11|newspaper=Huffington Post |last1=Bassett |first1=Laura |last2=Terkel |first2=Amanda }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Framing the issue====
{{See also|War on Women}}
Some people see the matter as primarily one of [[women's health]], such as the [[National Women's Law Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwlc.org/resource/denying-coverage-contraceptives-harms-women|accessdate=March 10, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314132256/http://www.nwlc.org/resource/denying-coverage-contraceptives-harms-women|archivedate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others see it as a matter of [[religious freedom]].

Certain consumers of mandatory health insurance, such as students matriculated at colleges of further education, have criticized what they perceive to be discrimination in provision or in practice: employer-provided plans that cover University faculty and staff may be subject to legal mandates whereas plans that cover the student body may not. [[Sandra Fluke]] was invited to present oral arguments on behalf of certain female student consumers dissatisfied with restrictions attached to registration for undergraduate and graduate attendance at Georgetown University School of Law.&lt;ref name=wikisource&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Sandra_Fluke_testimony_to_US_Congress_%282012_February_23%29|title=Sandra Fluke testimony to US Congress (2012 February 23)|last=Fluke|first=Sandra Kay|date=2012-02-23|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corruption in Slovenia''' is examined on this page.

== Extent ==
According to Transparency International's Global Corruption Barometer 2013, political parties rank as the most corrupt institution in [[Slovenia]], closely followed by Parliament, the judiciary and public officials. According to the same survey, 77% of the households consider the government's efforts in fighting corruption “ineffective”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Corruption Barometer 2013|url=http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, thousands of Slovenians joined the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption and took to the streets, demanding the resignation of Prime Minister [[Janez Janša]] and opposition leader [[Zoran Janković (politician)|Zoran Janković]] because both had been accused of failing to properly declare their personal assets. The Commission accused both of “systemic, gross and repeated violations of the anti-corruption legislation”. The month after the protest, Janša was ousted in a no-confidence vote. In June 2013, Janša was convicted of corruption in connection with a 2006 defence contract and given a two-year prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slovenia Ex-Premier Janša Gets Two Years in Prison on Bribes|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-05/slovenia-s-ex-premier-jansa-convicted-of-graft-in-military-deal.html|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conviction was unanimously overturned by the [[Constitutional Court]] on 23 April 2015.&lt;ref name="MMC RTV Slovenia"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/news-in-english/constitutional-court-overturned-the-convictions-in-the-patria-case/363556 |title=Constitutional court overturned the convictions in the Patria case |publisher=MMC RTV Slovenia |date=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Zoran Janković (politician)|Zoran Janković]], continued his mandate as mayor of [[Ljubljana]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ljubljana.si/sl/mestna-obcina/zupan/&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, [[Slovenia]] was 34 th on the [[Corruption perceptions index]] with 61 points (which is the same than in 2016) and is on the same place as [[Botswana]]. Slovenia has been stagnating in the field of corruption for at least 5 years. Major systemic measures are needed to lower the level of corruption in [[Slovenia]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.zurnal24.si/slovenija/slovenija-brez-napredka-na-lestvici-indeksa-zaznave-korupcije-305324&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Areas ==

=== Business ===
According to Transparency International's Global Corruption Barometer 2013, the private sector is scored 3.3 on a 5-point scale (1 being 'not at all corrupt' and 5 'extremely corrupt').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Corruption Barometer 2013|url=http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transparency International's 2016 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 31st place out of 176 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016|title=Corruption Perception Index 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the World Economic Forum’s [[Global Competitiveness Report]] 2013-2014, corruption ranks among the top-five most problematic factors for doing business in Slovenia, after access to financing, inefficient government bureaucracy, restrictive labour regulations and tax rates. However, surveyed executives report that public funds are rarely diverted due to corruption, and the ethical behaviour of companies is considered relatively high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014|url=http://www.weforum.org/|publisher=The World Economic Forum|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7546">'''Dacian art''' is the art associated with the peoples known as [[Dacians]] or North Thracians; The Dacians created an art style in which the influences of Scythians and the Greeks can be seen. They were highly skilled in gold and silver working and in pottery making. Pottery was white with red decorations in floral, geometric, and stylized animal motifs. Similar decorations were worked in metal, especially the figure of a horse, which was common on Dacian coins.{{sfn| Waldman| Mason |2006|p=208}}  

==Background ==
[[File:Daci Terra Getarum cf Strabo.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Dacians regions cf. [[Strabo]] (ca. 20 AD) by Muller (1877) {{sfn|Müller|1877|loc=tabulae XV}}]]
[[File:Muzeuldeistorienaturalavienaaurdacic2.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Dacian gold bowl found in Transylvania (Vienna Museum)]]

The Geto-Dacians lived in a very large territory, stretching from the [[Balkans]] to the northern [[Carpathians]] and from the [[Black Sea]] and the river [[Tyras]] to the [[Tisza|Tisa]] plain, sometimes even to the [[Middle Danube]].{{sfn|MacKenzie|1986|p=25}} Between 15th-12th century, the Dacian-Getae culture was influenced by the Bronze Age Tumulus-Urnfield warriors.{{sfn|Mountain|1998|p=59}}



Dacian civilization went through several stages of development, from the Thracian stage in the Bronze Age to the classical period of the Geto-Dacians (the first century BC to the first century AD).{{sfn|Giurescu|Nestorescu|1981|p=47}} In the [[Bronze Age]], proto-Thracian populations emerged from the fusion of the local [[Eneolithic|Eneolithic (Chalcolithic)]] stock with the intruders of the transitional [[Indo-Europeanization Period]]. From these proto-Thracians, in the [[Iron Age]], there were developed the Dacians of the [[Danubian-Carpathian Area]] on the one hand and the Thracians of the eastern [[Balkan Peninsula]] on the other.{{sfn|Dumitrescu|Boardman|1982|p=53}}

==Pre-Dacian periods==
North Thracian population was chiefly an Early Bronze Age mix of the descendants of intrusive stockbreeding people and of survivors of the autochthonous Chalcolithic culture that the newcomers had destroyed. In this ethnic synthesis which gave birth to the Thracian people, the former predominated but, especially in the more mountainous areas, vestiges of Chalcolithic traditions survived through the Early and into the Middle Bronze Age.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=52}}

The local, Daco-Thracian art should not be mistaken for the art of the Thracians south of the Balkans although mutual influences had undoubtedly appeared.{{sfn|Popescu|1971|p=62}}


Thracian art was typically geometric in its decoration, a taste which was a remnant of Late Bronze Age traditions.{{sfn|Farkas|1981|p=37}} While the Thracian tribes adopted-no doubt from the Scythians-some aspects of mounted nomadism in the first millennium B.C., they also preserved many traditions of the European Bronze Age and belonged more to the world of European cultures than to that of the East.{{sfn|Farkas|1981|p=33}}

==Classical Dacian periods==

The 1st century BC silver work from the lower Danube region consists mostly of bracelets and fibulae alongside of a small number of decorative disks, plaques, and bowls. To distinguish it from earlier Thracian silver work, one might label this later silver work as Geto-Dacian or Geto-Thracian depending on whether is found above or below the lower Danube.{{sfn|Olmsted|2001|p=22}}


The design of Geto-Dacian helmets (i.e. Ciumesti, Iron Gate) is sufficiently unusual in ancient art to offer the opportunity to trace it to its origin, and, thereby, provide some insight into the Scythian elements that went into the formation of early Dacian art and the means by which ancient Oriental motifs survived and were transmitted into Europe{{sfn|Goldman|1970|p=904}} Almost identical in decoration and details of craftsmanship are the two silver beakers, now in Bucharest and New York and unquestionably were made in the same metalsmith shop as the helmet.{{sfn|Goldman|1970|p=904}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2094">In the United Kingdom the '''Dangerous Drugs Act 1920''' is an Act which changed to a penal offence [[drug addiction]] which up to then was, within the medical profession, treated as a disease. The former was the view held by the then Assistant Under [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]], [[Malcolm Delevingne]].&lt;ref&gt;Berridge V (1980) The making of the Rolleston Report,1908-1926, Journal of Drug Issues, page 300&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Home Office]] was charged with implementing the Act&lt;ref&gt;Heroin Addiction care and control: The British System, HB Spear, page 33&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1921 the Home Secretary gave 40 days notice of his intention to issue controls over 
*[[raw opium]]
*[[morphine]]
*[[cocaine]] 
*[[ecogonine]] and
*[[heroin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Manchester Guardian]]; ''Sale Of " Dope " Drugs: New Control Regulations''; 8 January 1921&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act also said that the export, import, sale, distribution or possession of [[barbiturates]], had to be licensed or authorised by the [[Home Secretary]]. This proviso also applied to dilutions of [[cocaine]] and [[morphine]], as defined in the lower limits set by the Hague Convention.

The Home Office, in consultation with the [[Ministry of Health (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Health]], as a result of this Act, produced a series of memoranda for doctors and dentists to explain the requirements of the Act. These were known as DD 101's (Memoranda as to the Duties of Doctors and Dentists). These were distributed to doctors, although the memorandi never had any statutory power.&lt;ref&gt;Heroin Addiction care and control: The British System, HB Spear, page 33&lt;/ref&gt; One particular memorandum, in 1938, added, for the first time,  ''that maintenance of addicts if only for the 'gratification of addiction is not regarded as a medical need'''.&lt;ref&gt;Heroin Addiction care and control: The British System, HB Spear, page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5612">'''Deborah Szebeko''' (born 1980) is founding director of the social design agency '''thinkpublic'''.

[[File:Deborah Szebeko .jpg|thumb|Deborah Szebeko (2016)]]

== History ==
After volunteering for nine months at [[Great Ormond Street Hospital|Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital NHS Trust]] in 2003, Szebeko identified opportunities to use design to improve communications and patient experiences in healthcare . To encompass her insight, Szebeko set up '''thinkpublic''' in 2004 after taking part in the [[Nesta (charity)|NESTA]] Creative Pioneer Programme.

Using design to improve health and public services, Szebeko and thinkpublic have worked with organisations across the World in the health and social sector. With an experience in designing services, products and social enterprise.{{Clarify|date=May 2011}}

== Co-design and service design ==
At the heart of thinkpublic and Szebeko's work is '''co-design''', a [[Participatory design]] methodology for involving people in identifying opportunities and needs, then using creative tools to design solutions.

Working across the public, third and private sectors, Szebeko has used design and research methodologies to encourage service innovation and enterprise. Over the past 13 years, she has successfully used her service design approach to inform and develop products, enterprises and service innovations that have been rolled out internationally by the [[NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement]], the [[Department of Health (UK)]], [[NESTA]], [[Alzheimer's Society]], [[Cabinet Office]], [[AstraZeneca]], [[DigitasLBi]] and [[Design Council]].

== Awards ==
In 2012, thinkpublic won [[Design Week]] [https://www.designweek.co.uk/the-2012-design-week-awards-winners/ '''Service Design Award'''], followed by being ranked in the top 50 Agencies of the year.

In 2008, for her dedication to social innovation, Szebeko won the [[British Council|British Council’s]] '''[http://creativeconomy.britishcouncil.org/people/deborah-szebeko/ UK Young Design Entrepreneur Award]''' and was listed in the Top 10 for ‘The Future 500’ in [[The Observer]] and [[New Statesman]].

In 2003, Szebeko won the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England|HEFSC]] Young Volunteer of the Year Award for her design work at Great Ormond St Children's Hospital NHS Trust.

== Public speaking ==
Since setting up thinkpublic, Szebeko has presented her work at international design and health conferences including: Leading Age Services Congress (Australia 2015), [[Design Indaba]] (Cape Town 2011), The European Business Analysts Conference (London 2010), Women in Design (Poland 2011),    [[Designs of the Time]] (Cornwall 2011), [[Designs of the Time|Reinventing]] Design (Hong Kong Design Centre, 2008), [[Designs of the Time]] (Newcastle, 2007), NESTA Young Innovators (London, 2007), The European Forum on Quality Improvement in Healthcare (Prague, 2006), Doors of Perception (New Delhi, 2005) and DOORS Leaders Round Table (Amsterdam, 2004).

== Publications ==

This article is about the [[Demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Japan]] before the [[Meiji Restoration]].

==Population before Edo era==

===Total population===
Before the establishment of the {{nihongo|Shūmon Ninbetsu Aratame Chō|[[:ja:宗門人別改帳|宗門人別改帳]]|religious and population investigation registers}} system by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], several less reliable sources existed upon which an estimate of the population was made. The first record of the population was the Chinese text "[[Records of Three Kingdoms]]" ({{zh|t=三國志|s=三国志|p=Sānguó Zhì}}), where the summated number of houses in eight countries of Wō ({{nihongo|[[Wa (Japan)|Wa]]|倭|Japan, Japanese}}) is given as 159,000.

The household registration system ([[Hukou system|Hukou]] ({{zh|t=戶口|s=户口|p=hùkǒu}}) or Huji ({{zh|s=户籍|t=戶籍|p=hùjí}})), which is called {{nihongo|[[koseki]]|戸籍|family registries}} in Japanese, was introduced from [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]] to Japan during the 7th century. According to "{{nihongo|[[Nihon Shoki]]|日本書記}}", the first ''koseki'' system, called {{nihongo|Kōgo no Nen Jaku|[[:ja:古代日本の戸籍制度|庚午年籍]]}} or {{nihongo|Kōin no Nen Jaku|[[:ja:古代日本の戸籍制度|庚寅年籍]]}}, was established between 670 or 690, and was to be readministered every six years. However, most of the original ''koseki'' texts were lost because they were to be preserved only 30 years. The oldest ''koseki'' fragments - which were reused as reinforcement papers ({{nihongo|Shihai Monjo|[[:ja:紙背文書|紙背文書]]|scroop document}}) in {{nihongo|Shōsōin|正倉院}} - records names, ages and estates of people including slaves (e.g. 1,119 persons were recorded for the village named {{nihongo|Hanyū|[[:ja:半布里戸籍|半布里]]}} (present day {{nihongo|[[Tomika, Gifu|Tomika-chō]]|富加町}}) in 702)). A discarded lacquer-coated paper document ({{nihongo|Urushigami Monjo|[[:ja:漆紙文書|漆紙文書]]|lacquer paper document}}) found in {{nihongo|Kanoko C Ruins|鹿ノ子C遺跡}}, [[Ishioka, Ibaraki]] records the total population of families of taxpayers in {{nihongo|[[Hitachi Province|Hitachi no kuni]]|常陸国}} in 795 was 191,660 (excluding families of officers, families of workers for [[Shinto|Shintō]] shrines and slaves); this is the only reliable remaining census recorded for a whole [[Provinces of Japan|province]] before the [[Edo period]]. The ancient ''koseki'' system later collapsed during the early [[Heian period]], when aristocrats achieved power as landowners of [[Shōen]].

The following estimates by different scholars are based upon the number of houses, villages, [[kokudaka]], areas of rice fields and soldiers which were recorded in "{{nihongo|[[Wamyō Ruijushō]]|和名類聚抄}}" (10th century), "Record of Sung ({{zh|t=宋史|s=宋史|p=Sòng Shǐ}})", "{{nihongo|Shūgaishō|拾芥抄}}" (14th century), "{{nihongo|Tenshōki|天正記}}" (late 16th century), "{{nihongo|Tōdaiki|当代記}}" (early 17th century), or fragments of papers of the Shōsōin (8th century) and others, as well as remnants of specific periods.

===Urban population===
Since [[Kyoto|Kyōto]] (or [[Heian-kyō]]) became the capital of Japan in 794, it has been one of the most important cities in Japan. [[Hiraizumi, Iwate|Hiraizumi]] and [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] flourished under [[Northern Fujiwara]] clans (during 12th century) and [[Kamakura shogunate]] (1192 to 1333), respectively.  The urban area of Kyōto suffered from the [[Ōnin War]] (1467 to 1477) and split into two districts, but coalesced into a great city of more than 400,000 inhabitants after the end of [[Sengoku period]]. The Christian missionaries led by [[Francis Xavier]] reported that the number of houses in [[Kyoto|Kyōto]], [[Yamaguchi, Yamaguchi|Yamaguchi]] or [[Hakata-ku, Fukuoka|Hakata]] was more than 90,000, more than 10,000 or 10,000, respectively, in the late 16th century according to ''History of Japan'' written by [[Luís Fróis]]. After the unification of Japan by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], [[Osaka|Ōsaka]] grew into a populous city with tens of thousands of people.  Several [[castle town]]s also began to grow, where samurai classes were settled.

==Population during the  Edo and early Meiji eras (1600 to 1873)==

===Total population===
After the [[Shimabara Rebellion]], several ''[[daimyō]]s'' adopted certification systems where all the individuals were to be registered to temples and shrines to avoid [[Christianity]].  The [[Danka system]] (or {{nihongo|terauke seido|寺請制度|temple-certification system}}) was officially set by Tokugawa shogunate in 1664, and demographic data of individuals registered to temples and shrines (Shūmon Ninbetsu Aratame Chō) were recorded. After decades, [[Tokugawa Yoshimune]] decided to survey the total population of Japan and ordered to collect demographic data of all the domains ({{nihongo|[[Han (administrative division)|han]]|藩|}}) and shogunate territories ({{nihongo|tenryō|天領}}). The first census was surveyed every six years since 1721 and finished in 1846, because the confusion after the [[Perry Expedition]] and death of [[Tokugawa Ieyoshi]] in 1853 postponed the calculation process of the demographic data collected in 1852, according to {{nihongo|Suijin Roku|吹塵録}} edited by ({{nihongo|[[Katsu Kaishū]]|勝海舟}}.
&lt;!--During this progress the men had a big moderisation have the period of the shogunate Japan era?--&gt;

Some of population censuses during Edo era remain recorded in diaries or official texts as below. The population of [[samurai]] class and their servants as well as imperial families and noblemen was officially excluded from the census. In addition, the demographic data were summarized by individual domains according to their rules, where babies and children, Buddhist monks, nuns and Shintō priests, discriminated classes of [[Burakumin|eta and hinin]] were sometimes excluded from the total population.  Unregistered people were also excluded.

In 1732, Tokugawa Yoshimune also ordered nine big ''[[Tozama daimyō]]s'' whose Domains were not changed since 1664 to report earlier population growths in their Domains. Here, population of [[Morioka Domain]] increased from 245,635 in 1669 to 322,109 in 1732; population of [[Tokushima Domain]] increased from 308,880 in 1665 to 470,512 in 1732; population of [[Tsu Domain]] increased from 252,061 in 1665 to 287,242 in 1732; population of [[Okayama Domain]] increased from 185,043 in 1686 to 396,469 in 1732; population of [[Kagoshima Domain]] increased from 260,961 in 1698 to 339,955 in 1732; population of [[Sendai Domain]] increased from 599,241 in 1690 to 647,427 in 1732; population of [[Tsuruoka Domain]] increased from 126,383 in 1694 to 131,164 in 1732; population of [[Kaga Domain]] increased from 551,754 in 1720 to 576,734 in 1732; while population of [[Nihonmatsu Domain]] only decreased from 73,351 in 1685 to 70,614 in 1732, according to the records written in "Chikkyō Yohitsu Besshū", which supports the rapid population growth in the early Edo era. Thus, the estimated population of Japan in 1600 ranges from 11 to 22 million, then a rapid population growth took place during the early Edo era to bring Japan to a country of about 30 million inhabitants by 1721, though more precise total population estimates remain arguable. The rapid population growth likely ended by early 18th century, then Japan's total population growth became almost zero during mid to late Edo era.&lt;!--Jared Diamond estimates Japan's population as 26,100,000 in 1721 and 27,200,000 in 1828, an increase of just 4.2%. This was a compete reversal of earlier trends. People were marrying and giving birth later and leaving longer intervals between babies. Contraception and abortion were also used.&lt;ref&gt;Jared Diamond, Collapse: How Societies choose to fail or survive, page 300&lt;/ref&gt; The previous rapid population growth had led to high food prices, hence the reduced birth rate--&gt;

After the beginning of the Tokugawa census, population growth fell almost to zero until the end of the [[Sakoku]] policy. On the other hand, regional demographic data suggest that population growth differed depending on area; the population of [[Tōhoku region]] (Mutsu and Dewa), especially in Mutsu decreased drastically, probably because of famines. The population of [[Kansai region]] (Kinai and its surrounding areas), which was the most densely populated and the most cultivated area of that time, as well as that of [[Kantō region]], also slightly decreased, probably because the surplus population in the rural areas moved to the big cities such as [[Kyoto]], [[Osaka]], and [[Edo]], where the life expectancy at birth were much lower than that in rural areas. On the other hand, populations in most of western Japan including [[Chūgoku region]] (San'indō and San'yodō), [[Shikoku]] (Nankaidō except for Kii) and [[Kyūshū]] (Saikaidō) steadily increased, where growth was sustained by the introduction of [[New World crops]] such as [[sweet potato]], [[pumpkin]], or [[corn]].

====Ryūkyū, Amami, Ezo and Karafuto====
The populations of [[Ryukyu Islands|Ryūkyū]] and [[Amami Islands|Amami]] Islands were surveyed by the [[Satsuma Domain]], which had formal possession of Satsuma, Ōsumi and part of Hyūga ({{nihongo|Morokata-gun|諸県郡}}) in southern Kyūshū, and recorded in Satsuma domestic texts, although they were not reported to the Tokugawa shogunate and were thus excluded from the total population of Japan. The populations of Ryūkyū and Amami Islands were included in the total populations of Japan after the Meiji Restoration.

The populations recorded in Satsuma domestic texts include all the classes, from several samurai classes to people who were discriminated against.

On the other hand, the populations of [[Ainu people|Ainu]] in eastern Ezo (including Chishima ([[Kuril Islands]])) and western Ezo (including Karafuto ([[Sakhalin]])) have been recorded since 1798 and 1810, respectively, and were thus included in the total population of Japan.

====Domains (han) and estates of the realm====
Meiji government tried to unify the registered system of Shūmon Ninbetsu Aratame Chō in consonant with that of each other among domains and prefectures into a single registered system of ''koseki''. However population were still surveyed by domains until the [[Abolition of the han system]] in 1871. The total population of Japan on July 28, 1870 (32,773,698) was collected by different systems of domains, but included all the registered people of all classes.&lt;ref name=EarlyMeiji&gt;(a) Naotarō Sekiyama, "Kinsei Nihon jinkō-no kenkyū (Study of the Population of Japan in the Early Modern Period)", Yoshikawa Kōbunkan, Tokyo (1978). (b) Bunzo Kure, "Estate population Table of fu, han and ken", ''Tōkei Shūshi (Statistics Bulletin)'' no. 8 pp. 96–107 (1882). Unfortunately, several unpublished reports upon populations during the early Meiji era preserved at the office of the Ministry of Interior of Japan were burned by a fire after the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The uniformed system of {{nihongo|Jinshin koseki|壬申戸籍}} was finally established in 1872, where the discriminated classes of eta and hinin were assimilated into the citizens class ({{nihongo|heimin|平民|normal people}}), though they kept unofficially called {{nihongo|[[burakumin|shin-heimin]]|新平民|new normal people}}) and discriminated. The honseki population in 1872 (33,110,825) includes 29 imperial members ({{nihongo|kōzoku|皇族|imperial family}}), 2,666 noblemen ({{nihongo|kazoku|華族|noble family}}), 1,282,167 former samurai class members ({{nihongo|shizoku|士族|samurai family}}), 658,074 and 3,316 lower former samurai class members ({{nihongo|sotsuzoku|卒族|soldier family}} and {{nihongo|chishi|地士|squire}}, respectively), 211,846 and 9,621 Buddhist monks and nuns ({{nihongo|sōryo|僧侶|monk}} and {{nihongo|ama|尼|nun}}, respectively), 102,477 former Shintō priests ({{nihongo|kyū-shinkan|旧神官|former Shintō priest}}), 30,837,271 citizens (heimin, which includes ca. 550,000 shin-heimin and 2,358 unclassified people in Sakhalin.)

===Urban population===
After the [[Battle of Sekigahara]], Yamaguchi declined, while Edo (Tōkyō) and Sumpu (Shizuoka) became important under the Tokugawa shougunate.  According to [[Rodrigo de Vivero y Velasco]], the populations of Kyōto, Ōsaka, Edo, Sumpu and Sakai were 300,000–400,000 (or 800,000), 200,000, 150,000, 120,000 and 80,000, respectivel;, while the two towns between Sumpu and Kyōto had 30,000 and 40,000 inhabitants (probably [[Hamamatsu, Shizuoka|Hamamatsu]] and [[Nagoya]] (or [[Kiyosu, Aichi|Kiyosu]]), respectively) in 1609.  After the death of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], Sumpu became less important, while Edo, Ōsaka and Kyōto became the three most important cities and were called the {{nihongo|santo|三都|three capitals}} with tens of thousands of inhabitants.

Below is a list of the estimated population of major Japanese urbans during Edo period. Although [[Hiroshima, Hiroshima|Hiroshima]], [[Wakayama, Wakayama|Wakayama]], [[Tokushima, Tokushima|Tokushima]], [[Hagi, Yamaguchi|Hagi]], [[Takamatsu, Kagawa|Takamatsu]] and Sumpu (Shizuoka) were important castle towns of major domains, estimated populations are not given because of the lack of sufficient demographic records. Population of [[Shuri, Okinawa|Shuri]], the capital of the Kingdom of Ryūkyū, is also not estimated, while [[Yokohama]] was only a small village of less than 100 houses until the opening of the port in 1859.

Estimated populations of castle towns contain considerable errors compared to those of the business towns (Ōsaka, Sakai, Hyōgo, Niigata, Nagasaki, Hakodate and Fushimi) with fewer samurai-class inhabitants, because demographics of samurai classes and their servants (or dwellers of samurai districts) were recorded separately or kept secret, which easily lead to the loss of original data after the abolition of the Han system.  On the other hand, the demography of [[chōnin]] classes (civilian), or dwellers of chōnin districts plus chōnin classes who dwelt in temple/shrine districts (i.e. excluding demographics of Buddhist monks, nuns and Shintō priests which were usually summed separately), rather remain recorded for most of the cases.

Even the peak estimated population of Edo varies from 788,000 to 1,500,000.  For example, Yoshida (1910) estimated the peak population of Edo (shortly before [[Matthew C. Perry|Perry]]'s expeditions) at 1,400,000 based on the average amount of rice carried into Edo (1,400,000 ''koku'' per year).  Chandler (1987) estimated the peak population of Edo at 788,000 by adding samurai population as 3/8 of the recorded chōnin population.  Sekiyama (1958) estimated the peak population of Edo at 1,100,000 by adding samurai and servants population as 500,000 (215,000 [[Hatamoto]], [[Gokenin]], their servants and families, 100,000 ''[[shōgun]]''{{'}}s [[Ashigaru]], other lower servants and their families, 180,000 Daimyo, their servants and their families).  Diaries recorded that the population of Edo was 1,287,800 in 1837, the population of monks and priests was ca. 40,000 or the samurai population of Edo was 700,973.  According to the map of Edo illustrated in 1725, area for samurai occupied 66.4% of the total area of Edo (estimated population density: 13,988 /km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 650,000 individuals), while areas for chōnin and temples-shrines occupied 12.5% (estimated chōnin population density: 68,807 /km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 600,000 individuals) and 15.4% (estimated population density: 4,655 /km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 50,000 individuals), respectively.

The '''Deshwali''' , or sometimes pronounced Deswali, are a [[Tribal Rajput]] community found in the state of [[Rajasthan]] in [[India]]. A small number of Deshwali are found in the city of [[Hyderabad]], [[Jharkhand]] .&lt;ref&gt;People of India Rajasthan Volume XXXXVIII Part One edited by B.K Lavania, D. K Samanta, S K Mandal  &amp; N.N Vyas pages 312 to 315 Popular Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==
The community get their name from word desh, which is the local [[Marwari language|Marwari]] language means land and wali, which is [[Persian language|Persian]] (originally from Arabic) means lord, literally the word Deshwali means a feudal lord. The community are [[Rajput]]. They were soldiers in the army of [[Prithvi Raj Chauhan]]. They were early adopters of the Islam in India. They accepted [[Islam]], via the preaching of  the great [[Sufi]] preacher, [[Moinuddin Chishti]]. Deshwali community live in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh. Deshwali in Madhya Pradesh live in Indore, Barnagar, Ratlam. Deshwali in Rajasthan live in Nagour, Ajmer, Tonk, Bhilwara, Kota, Baran, Jhalawar, Bundi, Udaipur &amp; Jaipur districts. They speak the  [[Marwari language|Marwari]] dialect, with many having knowledge of [[Urdu]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Rajasthan Volume XXXVIII Part One edited by B.K Lavania, D. K Samanta, S K Mandal  &amp; N.N Vyas pages 312 to 315 Popular Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==
The Deshwali are generally an endogamous community, although there are cases of intermarriage with the [[Qaimkhani]] and [[Pathans of Rajasthan|Pathan]] communities. They have no system of [[gotras]], and practice both parallel and cross-cousin marriages.  The community consists of large to medium-sized farmers, and like other [[Rajput]] groups in [[Rajasthan]], have been affected by the abolishment of the [[Jagirdar]]i system. A small number of Deshwali are sharecroppers and landless agricultural labourers. A few are also engaged in petty business, and the community has seen a growth in education and the start of urbanization.  The Deshwali are [[Sunni]] and continue to pay special reverence to [[Moinuddin Chishti]], the [[Sufi]] saint of [[Ajmer]].  They are relatively more orthodox than the [[Merat]] and [[Cheetah (caste)|Cheetah]], neighbouring [[Muslim Rajput]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;''People of India Rajasthan'' Volume XXXVIII Part One edited by B.K Lavania, D. K Samanta, S K Mandal &amp; N.N Vyas pages 312 to 315 Popular Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Deswalis in [[India]], there is also community of Deshwali found in the city of Hyderabad and adjoining rural areas. They maintain close relations with the [[Qaimkhani]] and [[Khanzada]], two neighbouring [[Rajasthani people|Rajasthani]] communities found in [[Sindh]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

'''Dutch Surinamese''' ({{lang-nl|Boeroes}}) are [[Surinamese people]] of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] descent.  

Dutch migrant settlers in search of a better life started arriving in [[Suriname]] (previously known as [[Dutch colonisation of the Guianas|Dutch Guiana]]) in the 19th century with the ''boeroes'', poor farmers arriving from the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|Dutch provinces]] of [[Gelderland]], [[Utrecht]], and [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]].&lt;ref&gt;''America Desde Otra Frontera. La ''Guayana Holandesa'' - Surinam : 1680-1795'', Ana Crespo Solana.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Surinamese ethnic group, the [[Creole peoples|Creoles]], persons of mixed [[Mulatto|African-European]] ancestry, are partially of Dutch descent.

Many Dutch settlers left Suriname after independence in 1975, which diminished the white Dutch population. Currently there are around 1000 boeroes left in Suriname, and 3000 outside Suriname. Inside Suriname, they work in several sectors of society. Some families still work in the agricultural sector.&lt;ref name=mitrasing&gt;{{cite book|title=Suriname, Land of Seven Peoples: Social Mobility in a Plural Society, an Ethno-historical Study|author=F.E.M.

'''''Effacer le tableau''''' ("erasing the board") is the operational name given to the [[genocide|systematic extermination]] of the 
[[Mbuti people|Bambuti pygmies]] by rebel forces in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC).{{sfn|Penketh|2004}}

==History==
The extermination was carried out by soldiers from the [[Movement for the Liberation of Congo]] (MLC), who became known to locals as ''les effaceurs'' ("the erasers"), and troops from the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]] (RCD-N).{{sfn|Deibert|2013|p=98}}

The primary objective of ''Effacer le tableau'' was the territorial conquest of the [[North Kivu]] province of the DRC. The Bambuti were targeted specifically as the rebels considered them "subhuman", and it was believed by the rebels that the [[Murder for body parts|flesh]] of the Bambuti held "[[Kindoki|magical powers]]". There were also been reports of [[cannibalism]] being widespread.{{sfn|Gilbert|2016|p=43}} It is estimated 60,000 to 70,000&lt;ref name=SeshadriICE1&gt;
"Between October 2002 and January 2003, two the rebel groups, the MLC and RCD-N in the East of the Congo launched a premeditated, systematic genocide against the local tribes and Pygmies nicknamed operation "Effacer le Tableau" ("erase the board"). During their offensive against the civilian population of the Ituri region, the rebel groups left more than 60,000 dead and over 100,000 displaced. The rebels even engaged in slavery and cannibalism. Human Rights Reports state that this was due to the fact that rebel groups, often far away from their bases of supply and desperate for food, enslaved the Pygmies on captured farms to grow provisions for their militias or when times get really tough simply slaughter them like animals and devour their flesh which some believe gives them magical powers.

11. Fatality Level of Dispute (military and civilian fatalities): 70,000 estimated"

In March 2016 the [[International Criminal Court]] found [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]] guilty of human rights violations in the Central African Republic. Bemba was the vice president of the DRC, and leader of the MLC during the year long extermination campaign {{sfn|Lattimer|2016}} but was fully acquitted by the ICC's appeal court in June 2018.

Their [[ethnonym]] is derived from the Angles, one of the [[Germanic peoples]] who migrated to [[Great Britain]] around the 5th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=English |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; England is one of the [[countries of the United Kingdom]], and the majority of people living there are [[British nationality law|British citizens]].

Historically, the English population is descended from several peoples{{snd}}  the earlier Celtic [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britons (or Brythons)]] and the [[Germanic tribes]] that settled in Britain following the withdrawal of the [[Romans]], including [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], [[Jutes]] and [[Frisians]].  Collectively known as the [[Anglo-Saxons]], they founded what was to become England (from the Old English ''Englaland'') along with the later [[Danelaw|Danes]], [[Anglo-Normans]] and other groups.  In the [[Acts of Union 1707]], the [[Kingdom of England]] was succeeded by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/|publisher=parliament.uk|title=Act of Union 1707|accessdate=26 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921194331/http://collections.europarchive.org/ukparliament/20090701100701/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/|archivedate=21 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, [[Culture of England|English customs and identity]] have become fairly closely aligned with [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British customs and identity]] in general.

Today many English people have recent forebears from other parts of the [[United Kingdom]], while some are also descended from more recent immigrants from other European countries and from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].

The English people are the source of the [[English language]], the [[Westminster system]], the [[common law]] system and numerous major sports such as [[cricket]], [[Association football|football]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/about-football-association/fa150|title=The FA: 1863 - 2013|website =The Football Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[rugby union]], [[rugby league]] and [[tennis]]. These and other English cultural characteristics have spread worldwide, in part as a result of the former [[British Empire]].

==English nationality==
The concept of an 'English nation' (as opposed to a British one) has become increasingly popular after the [[devolution]] process in [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] resulted in the four nations having semi-independent political and legal systems. Although England itself has no devolved government, the 1990s witnessed a rise in English self-consciousness.&lt;ref name="KK-262-290"&gt;{{harvnb|Kumar|2003|pp=262–290}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is linked to the expressions of national self-awareness of the other British nations of [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]]{{snd}}  which take their most solid form in the new [[devolution|devolved]] political arrangements within the United Kingdom{{snd}} and the waning of a shared British national identity with the growing distance between the end of the [[British Empire]] and the present.{{sfn|Kumar|2003|pp=[http://assets.cambridge.org/97805217/71887/sample/9780521771887ws.pdf 1–18]}}&lt;!--includes a link to the first 18 pages--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/596703.stm English nationalism 'threat to UK'], [[BBC]], Sunday, 9 January 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10064563 The English question Handle with care], [[the Economist]] 1 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Many recent immigrants to England have assumed a solely British identity, while others have developed dual or mixed identities.{{sfn|Condor|Gibson|Abell|2006}}&lt;ref&gt;"Ethnic minorities feel strong sense of identity with Britain, report reveals" Maxine Frith ''[[The Independent]]'' 8 January 2004.

In their 2004 Annual Population Survey, the [[Office for National Statistics]] compared the ''ethnic'' identities of British people with their perceived [[national identity]]. They found that while 58% of [[white people]] in England described their nationality as "English", the vast majority of non-white people called themselves "British".&lt;ref&gt;"78 per cent of [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshis]] said they were British, while only 5 per cent said they were English, Scottish or Welsh", and the largest percentage of non-whites to identify as English were the people who described their ethnicity as "[[mixed race|Mixed]]" (37%).[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=459 'Identity', ''National Statistics'', 21 February 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to Britishness===
It is unclear how many British people consider themselves English. In the [[2001 UK census]], respondents were invited to state their ethnicity, but while there were [[Tick (checkmark)|tick boxes]] for '[[Irish people|Irish']] and for '[[Scottish people|Scottish']], there were none for 'English', or '[[Welsh people|Welsh']], who were subsumed into the general heading 'White British'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/grosweb/grosweb.nsf/pages/file5/$file/supporting_information.pdf Scotland's Census 2001: Supporting Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217074049/http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/grosweb/grosweb.nsf/pages/file5/$file/supporting_information.pdf |date=17 December 2008 }} ([[PDF]]; see p. 43)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/04/23/ncen23.xml Philip Johnston, "Tory MP leads English protest over census", ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London) 15 June 2006].&lt;/ref&gt; Following complaints about this, the 2011 census was changed to "allow respondents to record their English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish, Irish or other identity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census/2011Census/CollectingtheInfo/questionnairedevelopment.asp 'Developing the Questionnaires', ''National Statistics Office''].&lt;/ref&gt;  Another complication in defining the English is a common tendency for the words "English" and "British" to be used interchangeably, especially overseas. In his study of English identity, [[Krishan Kumar (sociologist)|Krishan Kumar]] describes a common slip of the tongue in which people say "English, I mean British". He notes that this slip is normally made only by the English themselves and by foreigners: "Non-English members of the United Kingdom rarely say 'British' when they mean 'English'". Kumar suggests that although this blurring is a sign of England's dominant position with the UK, it is also "problematic for the English [...] when it comes to conceiving of their national identity. It tells of the difficulty that most English people have of distinguishing themselves, in a collective way, from the other inhabitants of the British Isles".{{sfn|Kumar|2003|pp=1–2}}

In 1965, the historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]] wrote,
:"When the ''[[Oxford History of England]]'' was launched a generation ago, "England" was still an all-embracing word. It meant indiscriminately England and Wales; Great Britain; the United Kingdom; and even the British Empire. Foreigners used it as the name of a [[Great Power]] and indeed continue to do so. [[Bonar Law]], by origin a [[Scottish Canadian|Scotch Canadian]],&lt;!-- This is a verbatim quote, PLEASE DO NOT ALTER IT, even if you have are unfamiliar with or dislike this usage of the term "Scotch" --&gt; was not ashamed to describe himself as "Prime Minister of England" [...] Now terms have become more rigorous. The use of "England" except for a geographic area brings protests, especially from the [[Scottish people|Scotch]]."&lt;ref&gt;A. J. P. Taylor, ''English History, 1914–1945'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1965), p. v&lt;/ref&gt;
However, although Taylor believed this blurring effect was dying out, in his book ''The Isles'' (1999), [[Norman Davies]] lists numerous examples in history books of "British" still being used to mean "English" and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, ''The Isles'' (1999){{Page needed|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, [[Matthew Parris]] in ''[[The Spectator]]'', analysing the use of "English" over "British", argued that English identity, rather than growing, had existed all along but has recently been unmasked from behind a veneer of Britishness.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Parris, in ''The Spectator'' dated 18 December 2010: "With a shrug of the shoulders, England is becoming a nation once again".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical origins and identity===
{{Main|Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain}}
There is a debate between historians, [[geneticist]]s and others about the extent to which historical changes in the culture of the British Isles corresponds to historical migration events of [[Germanic tribes]], and to the extent of these migrations. The traditional view of historians, based on contemporary accounts and linguistic evidence, was that the English are primarily descended from the [[Anglo-Saxons]], the term used to describe the various [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes that migrated to the island of [[Great Britain]] following the end of the [[Roman occupation of Britain]], with assimilation of later migrants such as the Norse [[Vikings]] and [[Normans]].

This belief is now regarded by many historians as incorrect, on the basis of more recent [[Genetics|genetic]] and archaeological research. Based on a re-estimation of the number of settlers, some have taken the view that it is highly unlikely that the British Celtic-speaking population was substantially displaced by the Anglo-Saxons and that instead a process of acculturation took place, with an Anglo-Saxon ruling elite imposing their culture on the local populations.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Jones, ''The End of Roman Britain'', pp.8–38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also "Britain AD: a quest for Arthur, England and the Anglo-Saxons" by [[Francis Pryor]]&lt;/ref&gt; Research into the [[genetic history of the British Isles]], conducted by [[Stephen Oppenheimer]] in 2007 appears to support this theory, not showing a clear dividing line between the English and their 'Celtic' neighbours but a gradual [[cline (population genetics)|clinal]] change from west coast Britain to east coast Britain, originating from upper palaeolithic and Mesolithic era variations in a pre-Indo-European population, which Oppenheimer argues form the basis of the modern population of the British Isles rather than Germanic tribes or Celts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html|title=A United Kingdom? Maybe|first=Nicholas|last=Wade|date=6 March 2007|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="opp"/&gt; More recent genetic studies of ancient British DNA have refuted the hypothesis that the Anglo-Saxon invaders formed an elite class largely separate from the indigenous population, finding that samples from culturally Anglo-Saxon graveyards contained individuals who were more Celtic, suggesting a high level of intermingling between the Anglo-Saxons and the native Britons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2016/0120/Where-did-the-British-come-from-Ancient-DNA-holds-clues|title=Where did the British come from?

The 2016 study authored by Stephan Schiffels et al. found the Anglo-Saxons to have significantly impacted the genetic composition of the British Isles, so that on average the contemporary East English population derives 38 percent of its ancestry from Anglo-Saxon migrations, with this proportion varying in other parts of Britain that saw less of the migration or the migration of different Germanic tribes.&lt;ref name="Schiffels nature"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10408|title=Iron Age and Anglo-Saxon genomes from East England reveal British migration history|first1=Stephan|last1=Schiffels|first2=Wolfgang|last2=Haak|first3=Pirita|last3=Paajanen|first4=Bastien|last4=Llamas|first5=Elizabeth|last5=Popescu|first6=Louise|last6=Loe|first7=Rachel|last7=Clarke|first8=Alice|last8=Lyons|first9=Richard|last9=Mortimer|first10=Duncan|last10=Sayer|first11=Chris|last11=Tyler-Smith|first12=Alan|last12=Cooper|first13=Richard|last13=Durbin|date=19 January 2016|journal=Nature Communications|volume=7|pages=ncomms10408|via=www.nature.com|doi=10.1038/ncomms10408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory that the English people are primarily descended from Anglo-Saxons is based largely on the dramatic cultural changes in Britain following their migration. The Celtic language was almost totally displaced by [[Old English]] and there was a complete shift towards North-West German farming methods and pottery styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/mar/18/genetic-study-30-percent-white-british-dna-german-ancestry|title=Genetic study reveals 30% of white British DNA has German ancestry|first=Hannah Devlin science|last=correspondent|date=18 March 2015|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Brythonic languages]] such as [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]], held on for several centuries in parts of western England such as [[Cornwall]], [[Devon]], [[Cumbria]] and a part of [[Lancashire]].&lt;ref&gt;''Chamber's cyclopædia of English literature: a history, critical and biographical, of authors in the English tongue from the earliest times till the present day, with specimens of their writings, Volume 1'' Robert Chambers, John Liddell Geddie, David Patrick, 1922.

Many historians, while making allowance for the limited survival of the Britons in England, hold to the view that there was significant displacement of the indigenous population after the Germanic migrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|format=PDF |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mace-lab/macepdf/Thomas-PRSB-06-Apartheid.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tuuRYPDE?url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mace-lab/macepdf/Thomas-PRSB-06-Apartheid.pdf |archivedate=1 November 2010 |title=Evidence for an apartheid-like social structure in early Anglo-Saxon England |author=Mark G.

[[File:Hengest and Horsa Verstegan.jpg|thumb|right|"The Arrival of the First Ancestors of Englishmen out of Germany into Britain": a fanciful image of the Anglo-Saxon migration, an event central to the English [[national myth]]. From ''A Restitution of Decayed Intelligence'' by [[Richard Verstegan]] (1605)]]

The first people to be called 'English' were the [[Anglo-Saxons]], a group of closely related [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes that began migrating to eastern and southern Great Britain, from southern [[Denmark]] and northern [[Germany]], in the 5th century AD, after the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Romans had withdrawn from Britain]]. The Anglo-Saxons gave their name to England (''Engla land'', meaning "Land of the Angles") and to the English.

[[File:Sutton Hoo Burial Chamber Replica.jpg|thumb|right|A reconstruction of an [[Anglo-Saxon burial chamber]] at [[Sutton Hoo]], [[East Anglia]].]]
The Anglo-Saxons arrived in a land that was already populated by people commonly referred to as the '[[Romano-British]]'—the descendants of the native Brythonic-speaking population that lived in the area of Britain under Roman rule during the 1st–5th centuries AD. The multi-ethnic nature of the [[Roman Empire]] meant that small numbers of other peoples may have also been present in England before the Anglo-Saxons arrived. There is archaeological evidence, for example, of an early North African presence in a Roman garrison at [[Aballava]], now [[Burgh-by-Sands]], in Cumbria: a 4th-century inscription says that the Roman military unit ''Numerus Maurorum Aurelianorum'' ("unit of Aurelian Moors") from Mauretania (Morocco) was stationed there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/B/blackhistorymap/arch.html The archaeology of black Britain], Channel 4. Retrieved 21 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Roman Empire incorporated peoples from far and wide, genetic studies suggest the Romans did not significantly mix into the British population.&lt;ref&gt;	Eva Botkin-Kowacki, '[https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2016/0120/Where-did-the-British-come-from-Ancient-DNA-holds-clues Where did the British come from?

The exact nature of [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons]] and their relationship with the Romano-British is a matter of debate. Traditionally, it was believed that a mass invasion by various Anglo-Saxon tribes largely displaced the indigenous British population in southern and eastern Great Britain (modern-day England with the exception of [[Cornwall]]). This was supported by the writings of [[Gildas]], the only contemporary historical account of the period, describing slaughter and starvation of native Britons by invading tribes (''[[Anglo-Saxon invasion|aduentus Saxonum]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/gildas_02_ruin_of_britain.htm|title=Gildas, The Ruin of Britain &amp;c.|date=1899|pages=4–252|first=Gildas the|last=Wise|website=Tertullian.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the English language contains no more than a handful of words borrowed from [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorksj.ac.uk/dialect/celtpn.htm celtpn&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;] However the names of some towns, cities, rivers etc. do have Brythonic or pre-Brythonic origins, becoming more frequent towards the west of Britain&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this view has been re-evaluated by some archaeologists and historians since the 1960s; and more recently supported by genetic studies,&lt;ref name="opp"&gt;{{cite book|last=Oppenheimer|first=S.|title=The Origins of the British: A Genetic Detective Story|year=2006|publisher=Constable and Robinson|location=London|isbn=978-1-84529-158-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; which see only minimal evidence for mass displacement. Archaeologist [[Francis Pryor]] has stated that he "can't see any evidence for ''bona fide'' mass migrations after the [[Neolithic]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Britain BC: Life in Britain and Ireland before the Romans'' by [[Francis Pryor]], p. 122. Harper Perennial. {{ISBN|0-00-712693-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the historian Malcolm Todd writes "It is much more likely that a large proportion of the British population remained in place and was progressively dominated by a Germanic aristocracy, in some cases marrying into it and leaving Celtic names in the, admittedly very dubious, early lists of Anglo-Saxon dynasties. But how we identify the surviving Britons in areas of predominantly Anglo-Saxon settlement, either archaeologically or linguistically, is still one of the deepest problems of early English history."&lt;ref&gt;[[Malcolm Todd|Todd, Malcolm]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=D3GPUqysfoAC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Anglo-Saxon+Origins:+The+Reality+of+the+Myth&amp;num=100&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Anglo-Saxon%20Origins%3A%20The%20Reality%20of%20the%20Myth&amp;f=false "Anglo-Saxon Origins: The Reality of the Myth"], in Cameron, Keith.

In a survey of the genes of British and Irish men, even those British regions that were most genetically similar to (Germanic speaking) continental regions were still more genetically British than continental: "When included in the PC analysis, the Frisians were more 'Continental' than any of the British samples, although they were somewhat closer to the British ones than the North German/Denmark sample. For example, the part of mainland Britain that has the most Continental input is Central England, but even here the [[Atlantic Modal Haplotype|AMH+1]] frequency, not below 44% (Southwell), is higher than the 35% observed in the Frisians. These results demonstrate that even with the choice of Frisians as a source for the Anglo-Saxons, there is a clear indication of a continuing indigenous component in the English paternal genetic makeup."&lt;ref name="y-chrom"&gt;Capelli, C., N.

In 2016, through the investigation of burials using ancient DNA techniques, researchers found evidence of intermarriage in the earliest phase of Anglo-Saxon settlement. By studying rare mutations and employing whole genome sequencing, it was claimed that the continental and insular origins of the ancient remains could be discriminated, and it was calculated that 25–40% of the ancestry of the modern English is attributable to continental 'Anglo-Saxon' origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = English DNA 'one-third' Anglo-Saxon - BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35344663|website = BBC News|access-date = 2016-02-17|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schiffels nature" /&gt;

===Vikings and the Danelaw===
{{Further|Vikings|Danelaw}}
From about 800 AD waves of [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danish]] Viking assaults on the coastlines of the [[British Isles]] were gradually followed by a succession of Danish settlers in England. At first, the Vikings were very much considered a separate people from the English. This separation was enshrined when [[Alfred the Great]] signed the [[Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum]] to establish the Danelaw, a division of England between English and Danish rule, with the Danes occupying northern and eastern England.&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Athelstan'' by Paul Hill (2004), Tempus Publishing. {{ISBN|0-7524-2566-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Alfred's successors subsequently won military victories against the Danes, incorporating much of the Danelaw into the nascent kingdom of England. Danish invasions continued into the 11th century, and there were both English and Danish kings in the period following the unification of England (for example, [[Ethelred the Unready|Æthelred II]] (978–1013 and 1014–1016) was English but [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] (1016–1035) was Danish).

Gradually, the Danes in England came to be seen as 'English'. They had a noticeable impact on the English language: many English words, such as ''anger'', ''ball'', ''egg'', ''got'', ''knife'', ''take'', and ''they'', are [[List of English words of Old Norse origin|of Old Norse origin]],&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=d&amp;p=18 Online Etymology Dictionary]'' by Douglas Harper (2001), [http://www.etymonline.com/sources.php List of sources used].

The English population was not politically unified until the 10th century. Before then, it consisted of a number of [[petty kingdom]]s which gradually coalesced into a [[Heptarchy]] of seven powerful states, the most powerful of which were [[Mercia]] and [[Wessex]]. The English [[nation state]] began to form when the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms united against Danish Viking invasions, which began around 800 AD. Over the following century and a half England was for the most part a politically unified entity, and remained permanently so after 959.

The nation of England was formed in 937 by [[Æthelstan]] of Wessex after the [[Battle of Brunanburh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/athelstan.shtml|title= Athelstan (c.895–939) : Historic Figures|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=30 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3483029 The Battle of Brunanburh, 937AD]'' by [[h2g2]], [[BBC]] website.

===Norman and Angevin rule===
{{further|Normans}}
[[File:Haroldoath.jpg|thumb|left|[[King Harold II]] of England (right) at the Norman court, from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]]]

The [[Norman conquest of England]] during 1066 brought Anglo-Saxon and Danish rule of England to an end, as the new [[French language|French speaking]] [[Normans|Norman]] elite almost universally replaced the Anglo-Saxon aristocracy and church leaders. After the conquest, "English" normally included all natives of England, whether they were of Anglo-Saxon, Scandinavian or Celtic ancestry, to distinguish them from the Norman invaders, who were regarded as "Norman" even if born in England, for a generation or two after the Conquest.&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'', 2nd edition, s.v. 'English'.&lt;/ref&gt; The Norman dynasty ruled England for 87 years until the death of [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] in 1154, when the succession passed to [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], [[House of Plantagenet]] (based in France), and England became part of the [[Angevin Empire]] until 1399.

Various contemporary sources suggest that within 50 years of the invasion most of the Normans outside the royal court had switched to English, with [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] remaining the prestige language of government and law largely out of social inertia. For example, Orderic Vitalis, a historian born in 1075 and the son of a Norman knight, said that he learned French only as a second language. Anglo-Norman continued to be used by the Plantagenet kings until [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] came to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heritage-history.com/www/heritage.php?Dir=eras&amp;FileName=britain_3.php|website=Heritage History&lt;!-- — Putting the "Story" back into History--&gt; |title =England—Plantagenet Kings|accessdate=|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216064812/http://heritage-history.com/www/heritage.php?Dir=eras&amp;FileName=britain_3.php |archivedate=16 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time the English language became more important even in the court, and the Normans were gradually assimilated, until, by the 14th century, both rulers and subjects regarded themselves as English and spoke the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/lang_gallery_04.shtml|title=BBC - History - British History in depth: The Ages of English|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the assimilation of the Normans, the distinction between 'English' and 'French' survived in official documents long after it had fallen out of common use, in particular in the legal phrase ''[[Presentment of Englishry]]'' (a rule by which a [[Hundred (country subdivision)|hundred]] had to prove an unidentified murdered body found on their soil to be that of an Englishman, rather than a Norman, if they wanted to avoid a fine). This law was abolished in 1340.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], s.v. 'Englishry'.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 18th century, England has been one part of a wider political entity covering all or part of the British Isles, which today is called the United Kingdom. [[Wales]] was [[Annexation|annexed]] by England by the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542]], which incorporated Wales into the English state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.ie/~dluby/history.htm|title=Liberation of Ireland|website=Iol.ie|accessdate=23 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new British identity was subsequently developed when [[James VI of Scotland]] became [[James I of England]] as well, and expressed the desire to be known as the monarch of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Britain: The British Wars 1603–1776'' by [[Simon Schama]], BBC Worldwide. {{ISBN|0-563-53747-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1707, England formed a union with [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] by passing an [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]] in March 1707 that ratified the [[Treaty of Union]]. The [[Parliament of Scotland]] had previously passed its own Act of Union, so the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] was born on 1 May 1707. In 1801, another [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] formed a union between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], creating the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. In 1922, about two-thirds of the Irish population (those who lived in 26 of the 32 counties of Ireland), left the United Kingdom to form the [[Irish Free State]]. The remainder became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, although this name was not introduced until 1927, after some years in which the term "United Kingdom" had been little used.

Throughout the history of the UK, the English have been dominant in population and in political weight. As a consequence, notions of 'Englishness' and 'Britishness' are often very similar. At the same time, after the Union of 1707, the English, along with the other peoples of the British Isles, have been encouraged to think of themselves as British rather than to identify themselves with the constituent nations.&lt;ref&gt;''The English'', [[Jeremy Paxman]] 1998{{Page needed|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration and assimilation===
{{See also|Historical immigration to Great Britain|Immigration to the United Kingdom (1922-present day)}}

England has been the destination of varied numbers of migrants at different periods from the 17th century onwards. While some members of these groups seek to practise a form of pluralism, attempting to maintain a separate ethnic identity, others have [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]] and [[Interracial marriage|intermarried]] with the English. Since [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s [[Resettlement of the Jews in England|resettlement of the Jews]] in 1656, there have been waves of [[Jews|Jewish]] immigration from [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in the 19th century and from Germany in the 20th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/digest/in_depth/on_anglo_jewry/|title=EJP - In Depth - On Anglo Jewry|date=14 July 2006|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=21 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714100957/http://www.ejpress.org/digest/in_depth/on_anglo_jewry/|archivedate=14 July 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the French king [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] declared [[Protestantism]] illegal in 1685 in the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]], an estimated 50,000 Protestant [[Huguenot]]s fled to England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walden.org/Institute/thoreau/life/Geneology/Guillet-Thoreau.htm Meredith on the Guillet-Thoreau Genealogy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221059/http://www.walden.org/Institute/thoreau/life/Geneology/Guillet-Thoreau.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to sustained and sometimes mass emigration of the [[Irish people|Irish]], current estimates indicate that around 6 million people in the UK have at least one grandparent born in the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.theguardian.com/britain/article/0,,1871753,00.html More Britons applying for Irish passports]'', Owen Bowcott, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 13 September 2006.

However, these groups are often still considered to be ethnic minorities and research has shown that black and Asian people in the UK are more likely to identify as British rather than with one of the state's four constituent nations, including England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23386024-ethnic-minorities-more-likely-to-feel-british-than-white-people-says-research.do |title=Ethnic minorities more likely to feel British than white people, says research |work=Evening Standard |date=18 February 2007 |accessdate=18 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211152221/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23386024-ethnic-minorities-more-likely-to-feel-british-than-white-people-says-research.do |archivedate=11 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current national and political identity===

This perceived rise in English self-consciousness has generally been attributed to the [[devolution]] in the late 1990s of some powers to the [[Scottish Parliament]] and [[National Assembly for Wales]].&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt; In policy areas for which the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and [[Northern Ireland]] have responsibility, the UK Parliament votes on laws that consequently only apply to England. Because the Westminster Parliament is composed of MPs from throughout the United Kingdom, this has given rise to the "[[West Lothian question]]", a reference to the situation in which MPs representing constituencies outside England can vote on matters affecting only England, but MPs cannot vote on the same matters in relation to the other parts of the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/82358.stm|title=The West Lothian Question|publisher=BBC News |date=1 June 1998|accessdate=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, groups such as the CEP have called for the creation of a [[Devolved English parliament|devolved English Parliament]], claiming that there is now a discriminatory democratic deficit against the English. The establishment of an English parliament has also been backed by a number of Scottish and Welsh nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6081130.stm|title=Fresh call for English Parliament|publisher=BBC News |date=24 October 2006|accessdate=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6197143.stm|title=Welsh nod for English Parliament|publisher=BBC News |date=20 December 2006|accessdate=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] has suggested that like most dominant groups, the English have only demonstrated interest in their ethnic self-definition when they were feeling oppressed.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson is quoted by Kumar {{harv|Kumar|2003|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Curtice]] argues that "In the early years of devolution...there was little sign" of an English backlash against devolution for Scotland and Wales, but that more recently survey data shows tentative signs of "a form of English nationalism...beginning to emerge among the general public".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ippr.org/files/images/media/files/publication/2011/05/Is_An_English_Backlash_Emerging_1753.pdf|title=Is an English backlash emerging? Reactions to devolution ten years on|first=John|last=Curtice|publisher=Institute for Public Policy Research|date=February 2010|accessdate=|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Kenny, [[Richard English]] and Richard Hayton, meanwhile, argue that the resurgence in English nationalism predates devolution, being observable in the early 1990s, but that this resurgence does not necessarily have negative implications for the perception of the UK as a political union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ippr.org/publications/beyond-the-constitution-englishness-in-a-post-devolved-britain|title=Beyond the constitution?

Recent surveys of public opinion on the establishment of an English parliament have given widely varying conclusions. In the first five years of devolution for Scotland and Wales, support in England for the establishment of an English parliament was low at between 16 and 19%, according to successive [[British Social Attitudes Survey]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Robert|last=Hazell|year=2006|title=The English Question|journal=Publius|volume=36|issue=1|pages=37–56|doi=10.1093/publius/pjj012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report, also based on the British Social Attitudes Survey, published in December 2010 suggests that only 29% of people in England support the establishment of an English parliament, though this figure had risen from 17% in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natcen.ac.uk/media/606961/nat%20british%20social%20attitudes%20survey%20summary%207.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y3azRno5?url=http://www.natcen.ac.uk/media/606961/nat%20british%20social%20attitudes%20survey%20summary%207.pdf |archivedate=19 April 2011 |first1=Rachel |last1=Ormston |first2=John |last2=Curtice |title=Resentment or contentment?

One 2007 poll carried out for [[BBC TV|BBC]] ''[[Newsnight]]'', however, found that 61 per cent would support such a parliament being established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6264823.stm|title='Most' support English parliament|publisher=BBC |date=16 January 2007|accessdate=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krishan Kumar notes that support for measures to ensure that only English MPs can vote on legislation that applies only to England is generally higher than that for the establishment of an English parliament, although support for both varies depending on the timing of the opinion poll and the wording of the question.{{sfn|Kumar|2010|p=484}} Electoral support for English nationalist parties is also low, even though there is public support for many of the policies they espouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Colin|last=Copus|title=English national parties in post-devolution UK|journal=British Politics|volume=4|issue=3|year=2009|pages=363–385|doi=10.1057/bp.2009.12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[English Democrats]] gained just 64,826 votes in the [[Results of the United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 UK general election]], accounting for 0.3 per cent of all votes cast in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/election2010/results/region/48.stm|title=Full England scoreboard|work=Election 2010|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kumar argued in 2010 that "despite devolution and occasional bursts of English nationalism – more an expression of exasperation with the Scots or Northern Irish – the English remain on the whole satisfied with current constitutional arrangements".{{sfn|Kumar|2010|p=478}}

In addition, 1,035,133 recorded British ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/tablist.html US Census 2000 data], table PHC-T-43.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a numerical decrease from the census in [[1990 United States Census|1990]] where 32,651,788 people or 13.1% of the population self-identified with English ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1990 Census of Population Detailed Ancestry Groups for States|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cp-s/cp-s-1-2.pdf|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=30 November 2012|date=18 September 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[1980 United States Census|1980 census]], over 49 million (49,598,035) Americans claimed English ancestry, at the time around 26.34% of the total population and largest reported group which, even today, would make them the largest ethnic group in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/censusdata/pc80-s1-10/tab02.pdf|work=1980 United States Census|title = Table 2: Persons Who Reported at Least One Specific Ancestry Group for the United States: 1980|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish Americans]] are descendants of [[Lowland Scotland|Lowland Scots]] and [[Northern England English|Northern English]] (specifically: [[County Durham]], [[Cumberland]], [[Northumberland]] and [[Westmorland]]) settlers who colonised Ireland during the [[Plantation of Ulster]] in the 17th century.

[[Americans]] of English heritage are often seen, and identify, as simply "American" due to the many historic cultural ties between England and the U.S. and their influence on the country's population. Relative to ethnic groups of other European origins, this may be due to the early establishment of English settlements; as well as to non-English groups having emigrated in order to establish significant communities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SoOXrMVp5BsC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=english+ancestry+united+states&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=english%20ancestry%20united%20states&amp;f=false From many strands: ethnic and racial groups in contemporary América] by Stanley Lieberson&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{Main|English Canadians}}
In the [[Canada 2016 Census]], 'English' was the most common ethnic origin (ethnic origin refers to the ethnic or cultural group(s) to which the respondent's ancestors belong&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/Products/Reference/dict/pop040.htm|title=Ethnic Origin|website = 2001 Census|publisher = Statistics Canada|date = 4 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;) recorded by respondents; 6,320,085 people or 18.3% of the population self-identified themselves as wholly or partly English.&lt;ref name="Census Profile, 2016 Census"&gt;[http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=PR&amp;Code1=01&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=01&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Canada&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;B1=Ethnic%20origin&amp;TABID=1&amp;wbdisable=true Census Profile, 2016 Census] - Ethnic origin population&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/as-sa/fogs-spg/Facts-csd-eng.cfm?LANG=Eng&amp;GK=CSD&amp;GC=5933015&amp;TOPIC=7 Focus on Geography Series] - 2016 Census&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, people identifying as Canadian but not English may have previously identified as English before the option of identifying as Canadian was available.&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/analysis/ethnicorigin/pdf/97-562-XIE2006001.pdf ''Canada's Ethnocultural Mosaic, 2006 Census''], (p.7) "...the presence of the Canadian example has led to an increase in Canadian being reported and has had an impact on the counts of other groups, especially for French, English, Irish and Scottish. People who previously reported these origins in the census had the tendency to now report Canadian."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
[[File:EBarton2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|[[Edmund Barton]] and [[Alfred Deakin]], 1st and 2nd [[Prime Minister of Australia]] both had English parents.]]
{{main|English Australians}}
From the beginning of the [[History of Australia (1788-1850)|colonial era]] until the mid-20th century, the vast majority of settlers to Australia were from the [[British Isles]], with the English being the dominant group. Among the leading ancestries, increases in Australian, Irish and German ancestries and decreases in English, Scottish and Welsh ancestries appear to reflect such shifts in perception or reporting. These reporting shifts at least partly resulted from changes in the design of the census question, in particular the introduction of a tick box format in 2001.&lt;ref name="abs.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/7d12b0f6763c78caca257061001cc588/af5129cb50e07099ca2570eb0082e462!OpenDocument|title=Chapter - Population characteristics: Ancestry of Australia's population|first=c=AU; o=Commonwealth of Australia; ou=Australian Bureau of|last=Statistics|website=Abs.gov.au|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
English Australians have more often come from the [[Southern England|south]] than the [[Northern England|north of England]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Jupp, The English in Australia, Cambridge University Press, 2004, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Australians]] of English descent, are both the single largest ethnic group in [[Australia]] and the largest 'ancestry' identity in the Australian census.&lt;ref name="Census2016-036"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/036 |title=Census 2016: Summary of result – Population by states and territories, 2011 and 2016 Census |work=Australian Bureau of Statistics |publisher=Australian Government |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[2016 Australian census|2016 census]], 7.8 million or 36.1% of the population identified as "English" or a combination including English, a numerical increase from 7.2 million over the 2011 census figure. The census also documented 907,572 residents or 3.9% of Australia as being born in [[England]], and are the largest overseas-born population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/2071.0~2016~Main%20Features~Cultural%20Diversity%20Data%20Summary~30 Census of Population and Housing: Reflecting Australia] - Ancestry 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other communities===
Since the 1980s there have been increasingly large numbers of English people, estimated at over 3 million, permanently or semi-permanently living in Spain and France, drawn there by the climate and cheaper house prices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/24/spain-expats "End of the dream for British expats in Spain"] by Giles Tremlett.

Significant numbers of people with at least some English [[Ancestor|ancestry]] also live in [[European New Zealanders#British and Irish New Zealanders|New Zealand]], [[Ethnic groups in South Africa#Whites|South Africa]] and [[South America]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015|reason=for South America -- see [[Y Wladfa]] for example British but not English}}

==Culture==

{{Main|Culture of England}}
The culture of England is sometimes difficult to separate clearly from the [[culture of the United Kingdom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carr|first=Raymond|title=invention of Great Britain, The |work=The Spectator |location=UK|year=2003}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20111111145323/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200304/ai_n9229004/ A review of ''The Making of English Identity'' by Krishnan Kumar]&lt;/ref&gt; so influential has English culture been on the cultures of the British Isles and, on the other hand, given the extent to which other cultures have influenced life in England.

The  '''family planning policy''', which is based on the [[Two-child policy#China|two-child policy]] and the [[one-child policy]], is a [[Human population planning|population planning]] policy of [[China]]. It was introduced from the 1950s "recommendation", and evolved to the one-child policy introduced between 1978 and 1980 and began to be formally phased out in 2015. The policy allowed many exceptions and [[ethnic minorities in China|ethnic minorities]] were exempt. In 2007, 36% of China's population was subject to a strict one-child restriction, with an additional 53% being allowed to have a second child if the first child was a girl. Provincial governments imposed fines for violations, and the local and national governments created commissions to raise awareness and carry out registration and inspection work.

According to the Chinese government, 400 million births were prevented, this claim has been called "bogus", "three-quarters of the decline in fertility since 1970 occurred before the launching of the one-child policy; and most of the further decline in fertility since 1980 can be attributed to economic development" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/martinwhyte/files/challenging_myths_published_version.pdf?m=1435870726|title=Challenging Myths about China's One-Child Policy|website=scholar.harvard.edu|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thailand, Iran, Indian states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu have had similar declines of fertility without one child policy. Although 76% of Chinese supported the policy in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Chinese Celebrate Their Roaring Economy, As They Struggle With Its Costs|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2008/07/22/the-chinese-celebrate-their-roaring-economy-as-they-struggle-with-its-costs/|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is controversial outside of China.

On 29 October 2015, it was reported that the existing law would be changed to a [[two-child policy#China|two-child policy]], citing a statement from the [[Communist Party of China]]. The new law became effective from 1 January 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/world/china-1-child-policy-ends-officially-bill-allowing-2nd-child-signed/story-GjHa860HH8tgdeNWSlIR5N.html|title=China officially ends one-child policy as its workforce shrinks|last=~~~~|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, following its passage in the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|standing committee of the National People's Congress]] on 27 December 2015.

'''Gustavo Antonio Gelpí, Jr.''' (born 1965) is the [[United States federal judge|Chief Judge]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico]]. At age 40, he was the youngest judge at the time of  his appointment.

==Early life and career==
Born in 1965, in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]], Gelpí received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Brandeis University]] in 1987 and a [[Juris Doctor]] from [[Suffolk University Law School]] in 1991 (from which he also received an Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree in 2006). He was a [[law clerk]] to [[Juan M. Perez-Gimenez]] of the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico from 1991 to 1993.&lt;ref name="usdoj.gov"&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/olp/gelpiresume.htm U.S. Department of Justice Biography (accessed Jun 19, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; Gelpí was then an assistant federal [[public defender]] in the Office of the Federal Public Defender from 1993 to 1997. He worked in Puerto Rico's Department of Justice from 1997 to 1999, first as an assistant to the attorney general, and then as assistant attorney general for the office of legal counsel. During Puerto Rico Governor [[Pedro Rosselló]]'s second term, Gelpí served as Puerto Rico's Solicitor General from 1999-2000, and in said capacity argued several landmark cases on behalf of the Government of Puerto Rico before the United States Courts of Appeal for the First, Second and DC Circuits, as well as the Puerto Rico Supreme Court. He was a special litigation counsel in the [[law firm]] of McConnell Valdes in 2001, but left that position to become a [[United States Magistrate Judge]], an office that he held for five years, from 2001 to 2006.

==Federal judicial service==
On April 24, 2006, Gelpí was nominated by President [[George W. Bush]] to a seat on the District of Puerto Rico vacated by [[Hector M. Laffitte]]. He was endorsed by the Hispanic National Bar Association and the Puerto Rico Chapter of the Federal Bar Association.&lt;ref name="usdoj.gov"/&gt; Gelpí was unanimously confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on July 20, 2006, and received his commission on August 1, 2006. He has been serving as Chief Judge since April 13, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/tribunales/nota/gustavogelpijuramentacomojuezpresidentedeltribunalfederal-2414438/ |title=Gustavo Gelpí juramenta como juez presidente del Tribunal Federal |date=April 13, 2018 |website=elnuevodia.com |language=Spanish |access-date=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013 Judge Gelpi became National President of the Federal Bar Association, becoming only the second Hispanic and first federal judge to achieve this milestone.  He is also a Sustaining Life Fellow of the Foundation of the [[Federal Bar Association]].&lt;ref name="usdoj.gov"/&gt;

He is the author of a court opinion in the case of Consejo de Salud de la Playa de Ponce vs. Rullan, that holds that [[Puerto Rico]] is no longer an [[unincorporated territory]] of the United States, and has thus become an [[incorporated territory]]. In his opinion, Judge Gelpi notes that his ruling doesn't override the United Supreme Court's [[Insular Cases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Honors and recognitions==

Judge Gelpi has participated in Hawaii, Alaska, Chicago, Puerto Rico, District of Columbia, New York  and Boston in a series of scholarly historical lectures sponsored by the Federal Bar Association about the racist underpinnings of the Insular Cases, and how the Supreme Court and the US Congress have disparately treated the US citizens residing in the former and current US territories.  On August 14, 2014, Judge Gelpi presented at the Interamerican University former Governor Rafael Hernandez-Colon's book about the nature and development of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  Acknowledging that he did not agree with all of the former governor's pronouncements, he nonetheless urged all students to read the same because it is important for understanding the constitutional history of Puerto Rico.  In April of the following year, Judge Gelpi presented former Governor Pedro Rossello's book El Ultimo Enclave del Colonialismo (The Last Enclave of Colonialism) at the Puerto Rico Art Museum.  Both governors, in turn, wrote preambles to Judge Gelpi's book The Constitutional Evolution of Puerto Rico and Other U.S. Territories 1898–Present, published by Interamerican University in 2017.

The words '''homophile''' and '''homophilia''' are dated terms for [[homosexuality]]. The use of the word began to disappear with the emergence of the [[gay liberation]] movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s, replaced by a new set of terminology that provides a much clearer identity such as [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[transgender]].

==Etymology==
[[File:The Ladder, October 1957.jpg|thumb|right|The October 1957 edition of ''[[The Ladder (magazine)|The Ladder]]'', mailed to hundreds of women in the San Francisco area, urged women to take off their masks. The motif of masks and unmasking was prevalent in the homophile era, prefiguring the political strategy of coming out and giving the [[Mattachine Society]] its name.]]

The term ''homophile'' is favoured by some because it emphasizes love ("[[-phil-|-phile]]" from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] φιλία) rather than sex.{{efn| ''homo-'' is from Ancient Greek [[wikt:homo-#English|ὁμός]] (''homós'', “same”). }} The first element of the word, the Greek root "[[homo-]]", means "same"; it is unrelated to Latin ''homo'', "person". Coined by the German astrologist, author and psychoanalyst [[Karl-Günther Heimsoth]] in his 1924 doctoral dissertation ''Hetero- und Homophilie'', the term was in common use in the 1950s and 1960s by homosexual organizations and publications; the groups of this period are now known collectively as the homophile movement.

The [[Church of England]] has used the term "homophile" in certain contexts since at least 1991 – e.g., "homophile orientation," and "sexually active homophile relationship."&lt;ref name="btinternet1991"&gt;''Issues in Human Sexuality: A Statement by the House of Bishops of the General Synod of the Church of England'', December 1991 (London: Church House Publishing, 1991). {{cite web|url=http://www.btinternet.com/~j.p.richardson/issues.html|title=Annotated Notes on ''Issues in Human Sexuality''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990203165821/http://www.btinternet.com/~j.p.richardson/issues.html|archivedate=3 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In almost all languages where the words "homophile" and "homosexual" were both in use (i.e., their [[cognate]] equivalents: German ''Homophil'' and ''Homosexuell'', Italian ''omofilo'' and ''omosessuale'', etc.), "homosexual" won out as the modern conventional neutral term.  One exception is Norwegian, where the opposite happened, and "homofil[i]" is the modern conventional neutral term for "homosexual[ity]" in Norwegian.  Quoting and translating from the Norwegian (Nynorsk) Wikipedia article [[:nn:Homofili|"Homofili"]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] In British English and American English, "homophilia" was used to some extent; but by the end of the 1960s, it was replaced [in those languages] by "homosexual", "gay", and "lesbian".  "Homofili" was first used in Norwegian in a 1951 brochure from the Norwegian branch of the Danish "[[LGBT Danmark|League of 1948]]". Norway is one of the few countries where this trend [to use words based on "homophil-" instead of "homosexual-"] is still widespread.&lt;ref&gt;[[:nn:Homofili|"Homofili"]], from [http://nn.wikipedia.org Norsk (nynorsk) Wikipedia], entry retrieved 2012-06-19.

Noreg er eit av dei få (det einaste?) landet der dette omgrepet framleis har stor utbreiing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Homophile movement (1940–1970)==
After the gains made by the homosexual rights movements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the vibrant homosexual subcultures of the 1920s and '30s became silent as war engulfed Europe. Germany was the traditional home of such movements ([[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]]) and activists ([[Magnus Hirschfeld]], [[Ernst Burchard]], [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] or [[Max Spohr]]), but in [[Nazi Germany]] gay literature was burned, gay organizations were dissolved, and many gay men imprisoned in [[Nazi concentration camp|concentration camp]]s. The Swiss journal ''[[Der Kreis]]'' ("the circle") was the only homosexual publication in Europe to publish during the Nazi era. ''Der Kreis'' was edited by [[Anna Vock]], and later [[Karl Meier]]; the group gradually shifted from being female-dominated to male-dominated through the 1930s, as the tone of the magazine simultaneously became less militant.

After the war, organizations began to re-form, such as the Dutch [[COC Nederland|COC]] in 1946. Other, new organizations arose, including [[Forbundet af 1948]] ("League of 1948"), founded by [[Axel Axgil]] in Denmark, with [[Helmer Fogedgaard]] publishing an associated magazine called ''Vennen'' (The Friend) from January 1949 until 1953. Fogedgaard used the pseudonym "Homophilos," introducing the concept of "homophile" in May 1950, unaware that the word had been presented as an alternative term a few months previously by {{ill|Jaap van Leeuwen|es||nl}}, one of the founders of the Dutch COC. The word soon spread among members of the emerging post-war movement who were happy to emphasize the respectable romantic side of their relationships over genital sexuality.

A Swedish branch of Forbundet af 1948 was formed in 1949 and a Norwegian branch in 1950. The Swedish organization became independent under the name ''[[Swedish Federation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights|Riksförbundet för sexuellt likaberättigande]]'' (RFSL, "Federation for Sexual Equality") in 1950, led by [[Allan Hellman]]. The same year in the United States, the [[Mattachine Society]] was formed, and other organizations such as [[ONE, Inc.]] (1952) and the [[Daughters of Bilitis]] (1955) soon followed. By 1954, the monthly sales of ONE's magazine peaked at 16,000. Homophile organizations elsewhere include [[Arcadie (French homophile organization)|Arcadie]] (1954) in France and the British [[Homosexual Law Reform Society]] (founded 1958).

These groups are generally considered to have been politically cautious, in comparison to the LGBT movements that both preceded and followed them. Historian Michael Sibalis describes the belief of the French homophile group Arcadie, "that public hostility to homosexuals resulted largely from their outrageous and promiscuous behaviour; homophiles would win the good opinion of the public and the authorities by showing themselves to be discreet, dignified, virtuous and respectable."&lt;ref name=Sibalis&gt;Sibalis, Michael, 2005. ''Gay Liberation Comes to France: The Front Homosexuel d’Action Révolutionnaire (FHAR)'', French History and Civilization. Papers from the George Rudé Seminar. Volume 1 [http://www.h-france.net/rude/2005conference/Sibalis2.pdf  PDF link]&lt;/ref&gt; However, while few were prepared to [[Coming out|come out]], they did risk severe persecution, and some figures within the Homophile movement such as the American communist [[Harry Hay]] were more radical.

In 1951, the president and vice-president of the Dutch COC initiated an International Congress of European homophile groups, which resulted in the formation of the [[International Committee for Sexual Equality]] (ICSE).  The ICSE brought together, among other groups, the Forbundet of 1948 (Scandinavia), the Riksförbundet för Sexuellt Likaberättigande (Sweden), Arcadie (France), Der Kreis (Swiss), and, later, ONE (U.S.A.).  Historian Leila Rupp describes the ICSE as a classic example of transnational organizing; "It created a network across national borders, nurtured a transnational homophile identity, and engaged in activism designed to change both laws and minds."  However, the ICSE failed to last beyond the early 1960s due to poor attendance at meetings, lack of active leaders, and failure of members to pay dues.&lt;ref&gt;Rupp, Leila (2011). "The Persistence of Transnational Organizing: The Case of the Homophile Movement." ''The American Historical Review'' 116:4 (Oct. 2011): 1014-1039.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1960s, gays, lesbians and [[transgender]] people in the United States were forming more visible communities, and this was reflected in the political strategies of American homophile groups. From the mid-1960s, they engaged in [[List of pre-Stonewall LGBT actions in the United States|picketing and sit-ins]], identifying themselves in public space for the first time. Formed in 1964, the [[San Francisco|San Franciscan]] [[Society for Individual Rights]] (SIR) had a new openness and a more participatory democratic structure. SIR was focused on building community, and sponsored drag shows, dinners, bridge clubs, bowling leagues, softball games, field trips, art classes and meditation groups. In 1966, SIR opened the nation's first gay and lesbian community center, and by 1968 they had over 1000 members, making them the largest homophile organization in the country. The world's first gay bookstore had opened in New York the year before. A [[Annual Reminder|1965 gay picket held in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia]], according to some historians, marked the beginning of the modern gay rights movement. Meanwhile, in San Francisco in 1966, transgender street prostitutes in the poor neighborhood of [[Tenderloin, San Francisco, California|Tenderloin]] rioted against police harassment at a popular all-night restaurant, [[Compton's Cafeteria riot|Gene Compton's Cafeteria.]] These and other activities of public resistance to oppression lead to  a feeling of [[Gay Liberation]] that was soon to give a name to a new movement.

[[File:Stonewall Inn, West Village (6445656765).jpg|thumb|[[Stonewall Inn]], [[Greenwich Village]] is now a [[National Historical Landmark]]]]
In 1963, homophile organizations in New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. joined together to form [[East Coast Homophile Organizations]] (ECHO) to more closely coordinate their activities. The success of ECHO inspired other homophile groups across the country to explore the idea of forming a national homophile umbrella group. This was done with the formation in 1966 of the [[North American Conference of Homophile Organizations]] (NACHO, rhymes with Waco).&lt;ref&gt;Bianco, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; NACHO held annual conferences, helped start dozens of local gay groups across the country and issued position papers on a variety of LGBT-related issues. It organized national demonstrations, including a May 1966 action against military discrimination that included the country's first gay motorcade.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Through its legal defense fund, NACHO challenged anti-gay laws and regulations ranging from immigration issues and military service to the legality of serving alcohol to homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;Bianco, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; NACHO disbanded after a contentious 1970 conference at which older members and younger members, radicalized in the wake of the 1969 [[Stonewall riots]], clashed.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Gay Sunshine'' magazine declared the convention "the battle that ended the homophile movement".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Armstrong, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FranjoTudman.JPG|thumbnail|[[Franjo Tuđman]], 1st  democratically elected and 1st president of modern independent [[Republic of Croatia]]]]
The '''independence of [[Croatia]]''' was a process started with the changes in the political system and the constitutional changes in 1990 that transformed the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]] into the [[Republic of Croatia]], which in turn proclaimed the [[Christmas Constitution]], and held the [[Croatian independence referendum, 1991]].

After the country formally declared independence in June 1991, and the dissolution of its association with [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]], it introduced a [[Brioni Agreement|three-month moratorium on the decision]] when urged to do so by the [[European Community]] and the [[Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe]]. During that time the [[Croatian War of Independence]] started.

On 8 October 1991, the [[Croatian Parliament]] severed all remaining ties with Yugoslavia. The [[Badinter Arbitration Committee]] had to rule on the matter. Finally, the Croatian independence was internationally recognized in January 1992, when both the [[European Economic Community]] and the [[United Nations]] granted Croatia [[diplomatic recognition]], and the country was accepted into the United Nations shortly thereafter.

==Background==
[[File:Hrvatski sabor (2).jpg|left|thumb|[[Croatian Parliament]] building]]
During the [[World War II]] period from 1941 to 1945, Croatia was established as a [[puppet state]] called the [[Independent State of Croatia]], governed by the [[ultranationalism|ultranationalist]], [[fascism|fascist]] [[Ustaše]], backed by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]] within the territory of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. From 1945 it became a [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|Socialist federal unit]] of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], a [[one-party state]] run by the [[League of Communists of Croatia]] created at the end of [[World War II in Yugoslavia]]. Croatia enjoyed a degree of autonomy within the Yugoslav federation. At the turn of the 1970s, a Croatian national protest movement called the [[Croatian Spring]] was suppressed by Yugoslav leadership.&lt;ref name="JL-Savka"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Jutarnji list]] |language=Croatian |url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/heroina-hrvatskog-proljeca/305499/ |title=Heroina Hrvatskog proljeća |trans-title=Heroine of the Croatian Spring |date=6 August 2009 |author=Vlado Vurušić |accessdate=14 October 2011 |archivedate=25 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69QmExEdP?url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/heroina-hrvatskog-proljeca/305499/ |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]] gave increased autonomy to federal units, essentially fulfilling a goal of the Croatian Spring and providing a legal basis for independence of the federative constituents.&lt;ref name="Rich"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Roland |last=Rich |title=Recognition of States: The Collapse of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union |journal=European Journal of International Law |year=1993 |issue=1 |volume=4 |pages=36–65 |url=http://www.ejil.org/article.php?article=1207&amp;issue=67 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the political situation in Yugoslavia deteriorated, with national tension fanned by the 1986 Serbian [[Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts|SANU Memorandum]] and the [[Anti-bureaucratic revolution|1989 coups in Vojvodina, Kosovo and Montenegro]].&lt;ref name="frucht433"&gt;Frucht 2005, p. 433&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Reuters]] |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7D9123FF931A25752C0A96F948260&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=Titograd&amp;st=nyt |title=Leaders of a Republic In Yugoslavia Resign |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=12 January 1989 |accessdate=7 February 2010 |archivedate=25 July 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69QmSYE7N?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/12/world/leaders-of-a-republic-in-yugoslavia-resign.html |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As Slovenia and Croatia began to seek greater autonomy within the federation, including [[confederation|confederate]] status and even full independence, the nationalist ideas started to grow within the ranks of the still-ruling League of Communists. As [[Slobodan Milošević]] rose to power in Serbia, his speeches favored continuation of a unified Yugoslav state—one in which all power would be centralized in [[Belgrade]].&lt;ref name="Annex IV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Final report of the United Nations Commission of Experts established pursuant to security council resolution 780 (1992), Annex IV – The policy of ethnic cleansing; Prepared by: M.

Up until that time, a number of political decisions were legislated from within these provinces, and they had a vote on the [[List of heads of state of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav federal presidency]] level (six members from the republics and two members from the autonomous provinces).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Country Study: Yugoslavia (Former): Political Innovation and the 1974 Constitution (chapter 4) | url= http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/yutoc.html#yu0130 | publisher= The Library of Congress| accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the [[Gazimestan speech]], delivered on June 28, 1989, Milošević remarked on the current "battles and quarrels", saying that even though there were currently no armed battles, the possibility could not be excluded yet.&lt;ref name="Guardian-Gazimestan"&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/01/balkans.warcrimes | title = Tyrant's defeat marks Serbs' day of destiny | author= Tim Judah | authorlink= Tim Judah | date= July 1, 2001 | accessdate=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general political situation grew more tense when in 1989 [[Vojislav Šešelj]] publicly consorted with [[Momčilo Đujić]], a World War II [[Chetniks|Chetnik]] leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.icty.org/x/cases/seselj/ind/en/ses-ii030115e.pdf | format = PDF | title = Vojislav Seselj indictment | date = January 15, 2003 | publisher = The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] | accessdate =October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Croatian Serb leader [[Milan Babić]] testified that Momčilo Đujić had financially supported the Serbs in Croatia in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="ICTY-Milosevic-Transcript"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.icty.org/x/cases/slobodan_milosevic/trans/en/021204IT.htm | title= Slobodan Milosevic Transcript, case NO.

==Transition to democracy and political crisis==

In mid-1989, political parties other than the Communist Party were first allowed, starting a transition from the [[one-party system]]. A number of new parties were founded in Croatia, including the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] ({{lang-hr|Hrvatska demokratska zajednica}}) (HDZ), led by Franjo Tuđman.&lt;ref name="Independent-Tuđman-Obituary"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-franjo-tudjman-1132142.html |title=Obituary: Franjo Tudjman |author=Branka Magas |date=13 December 1999 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |archivedate=25 July 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69Qmjvz7e?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-franjo-tudjman-1132142.html |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1990, the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Communist Party]] fragmented along national lines, with the Croatian [[Political faction|faction]] demanding a looser federation. At the 14th Extraordinary Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, on 20 January 1990, the delegations of the republics could not agree on the main issues in the Yugoslav federation. The Croatian and Slovenian delegations demanded a looser federation, while the Serbian delegation, headed by Milošević, opposed this. As a result, the Slovenian and Croatian delegates left the Congress.&lt;ref name="Brown116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LondonTimes-Račan-Obituary"&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = [[The Times]] | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article1722946.ece | title = Ivica Racan | date = April 30, 2007 | accessdate=December 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pauković-14Congress-2009"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Davor Pauković |publisher=Centar za politološka istraživanja |url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=55640 |language=Croatian |title=Posljednji kongres Saveza komunista Jugoslavije: uzroci, tijek i posljedice raspada |trans-title=Last Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia: Causes, Consequences and Course of Dissolution |date=1 June 2008 |journal=Časopis za suvremenu povijest |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=21–33 |format=PDF |issn=1847-2397 |accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having completed the [[anti-bureaucratic revolution]] in Vojvodina, Kosovo, and Montenegro, Serbia secured four out of eight federal presidency votes in 1991,&lt;ref name="Brown116"/&gt; and it was able to heavily influence decision-making at the federal level, because unfavorable decisions could be blocked; this rendered the governing body ineffective. This situation led to objections from other republics and calls for reform of the Yugoslav Federation.&lt;ref name="Frucht433"&gt;[[#Frucht|Frucht (2005)]], p. 433&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1990, [[Jovan Rašković]] founded the [[Serb Democratic Party (Croatia)|Serb Democratic Party]] (SDS) in [[Knin]]. Its program stated that the "regional division of Croatia is outdated" and that it "does not correspond with the interest of Serb people".&lt;ref name="g214"&gt;[[#Goldstein|Goldstein (1999)]], p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; The party program endorsed redrawing regional and municipal lines to reflect the ethnic composition of the areas, and asserted the right of territories with a "special ethnic composition" to become autonomous.

==Political moves and civil unrest==

In late April and early May 1990, the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|first multi-party elections]] were held in Croatia, with [[Franjo Tuđman]]'s win resulting in further [[Nationalism|nationalist]] tensions.&lt;ref name="Independent-Tuđman-Obituary"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-franjo-tudjman-1132142.html |title=Obituary: Franjo Tudjman |author=Branka Magas |date=13 December 1999 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |archivedate=25 July 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69Qmjvz7e?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-franjo-tudjman-1132142.html |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tense atmosphere prevailed in 1990: on May 13, 1990, a [[Dinamo Zagreb-Red Star Belgrade riot|football game was held in Zagreb]] between [[Zagreb]]'s [[Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo]] team and Belgrade's [[Red Star Belgrade|Crvena Zvezda]] team.

On May 30, 1990, the new [[Croatian Parliament]] held its first session. President Tuđman announced his manifesto for a new Constitution and a multitude of political, economic, and social changes, including a plan for Yugoslavia as a confederation of sovereign states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?art=1765&amp;sec=444 | language = Croatian | work = Znameniti govori iz povijesti saborovanja | title = Govor Franje Tuđmana u Saboru 30. svibnja 1990. | publisher = Croatian Parliament | accessdate = 2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 1990, Croatia made constitutional amendments that asserted and effected its sovereignty – the "Socialist" prefix was dropped from the country's name, the [[President of Croatia]] replaced the President of the Presidency, in addition to other changes.&lt;ref name="End_of_SRH"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/1990_07_31_610.html | journal = [[Narodne novine]] | issue = 31/1990 | language = Croatian | title = Odluka o proglašenju Amandmana LXIV. do LXXV. na Ustav Socijalističke Republike Hrvatske | date = July 25, 1990 | accessdate = July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The changes in the July 1990 Croatian Constitution did not relate to the status of the Serbs, which remained identical to the one granted by the 1974 Croatian Constitution (based on the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]]).{{sfn|Bonacci Skenderović|Jareb|2004|pp=737–739}}{{not in citation|date=November 2017}}

The political crisis escalated when the Serb-populated areas attempted to form an enclave called [[Serbian Krajina]] which intended to separate from Croatia if Croatia itself attempted to separate from Yugoslavia. The Serb leadership in Krajina refused to recognize the government of the Republic of Croatia as having sovereignty over them.

Such was the case with Serbs in Croatia, constituting 12 percent of the republic’s population in 1991.

==General recognition==
{{see also|International recognition of Croatia}}

[[Germany]] advocated quick recognition of Croatia, in order to stop ongoing violence in Serb-inhabited areas, with [[Helmut Kohl]] requesting recognition in the [[Bundestag]] on 4 September. Kohl's position was opposed by [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;Lukač, Morana (2013). [https://books.google.com/books?id=YUfgnAEACAAJ Germany's Recognition of Croatia and Slovenia: Portrayal of the events in the British and the US press.] Saarbrücken: AV Akademikerverlag. {{ISBN|978-3639468175}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}, and the [[Netherlands]], but the countries agreed to pursue a common approach by following Germany's unilateral action. On 10 October, two days after the Croatian Parliament confirmed the declaration of independence, the EEC decided to postpone any decision to recognize Croatia for two months. German foreign minister [[Hans Dietrich Genscher]] later wrote that the EEC decided to recognize Croatian independence in two months if the war had not ended by then. With the war still ongoing when the deadline expired, Germany presented its decision to recognize Croatia as its policy and duty. Germany's position was supported by [[Italy]] and [[Denmark]]. France and the UK attempted to prevent German recognition by drafting a [[United Nations]] resolution requesting that no country take unilateral actions which could worsen the situation in Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="Lucarelli-2000"/&gt;

[[File:Robert Badinter.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Robert Badinter]] presided over the [[Arbitration Commission of the Conference on Yugoslavia]]]]

Starting in late November 1991, the Badinter Commission rendered a series of ten opinions. The Commission stated, among other things, that Yugoslavia was in the process of dissolution, and that the internal boundaries of Yugoslav republics could not be altered unless freely agreed upon.&lt;ref name="pellet"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Allain |last=Pellet |title=The Opinions of the Badinter Arbitration Committee: A Second Breath for the Self-Determination of Peoples |journal=European Journal of International Law |year=1992 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=178–185 |format=PDF |url=http://207.57.19.226/journal/Vol3/No1/art12-13.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529223410/http://207.57.19.226/journal/Vol3/No1/art12-13.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors in the preservation of Croatia's pre-war borders were the Yugoslav federal constitutional amendments of 1971 and 1974, granting that sovereign rights were exercised by the federal units, and that the federation had only the authority specifically transferred to it by the constitution.&lt;ref name="Rich" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PravST-Ustav-1974"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Čobanov |first1=Saša |last2=Rudolf |first2=Davorin |publisher=[[University of Split]] Faculty of Law |url=http://www.pravst.hr/zbornik.php?p=25&amp;s=170 |language=Croatian |title=Jugoslavija: unitarna država ili federacija povijesne težnje srpskoga i hrvatskog naroda&amp;nbsp;– jedan od uzroka raspada Jugoslavije |trans-title=Yugoslavia: a unitary state or federation of historic efforts of Serbian and Croatian nations—one of the causes of the breakup of Yugoslavia |year=2009 |journal=Zbornik radova Pravnog fakulteta u Splitu |volume=46 |issue=2 |issn= 1847-0459 |accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The borders had been defined by demarcation commissions in 1947.&lt;ref name="Kraljević-Razgraničenje-1947"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Egon |last=Kraljević |publisher=[[Croatian State Archives]] |url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=41791|pages=121–130 |language=Croatian |title=Prilog za povijest uprave: Komisija za razgraničenje pri Predsjedništvu Vlade Narodne Republike Hrvatske 1945.-1946 |trans-title=Contribution to the history of public administration: commission for the boundary demarcation at the government's presidency of the People's Republic of Croatia, 1945–1946 |date=November 2007 |journal= Arhivski vjesnik |volume=50 |issue=50 |format=PDF |issn= 0570-9008 |accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, France and the UK backed down during the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] debate on the matter on 14 December, when Germany appeared determined to defy the UN resolution. On 17 December, the EEC formally agreed to grant Croatia diplomatic recognition on 15 January 1992, on the basis of its request and a positive opinion of the Badinter Arbitration Commission.&lt;ref name="Lucarelli-2000"&gt;{{cite book|title=Europe and the breakup of Yugoslavia: a political failure in search of a scholarly explanation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bcxv1eVCyhIC |isbn=978-90-411-1439-6 |first=Sonia |last=Lucarelli |publisher=[[Martinus Nijhoff Publishers]] |year=2000 |accessdate=27 December 2011 |pages=125–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its Opinion No. 5 on the specific matter of Croatian independence, the Commission ruled that Croatia's independence should not yet be recognized, because the new [[Constitution of Croatia|Croatian Constitution]] did not incorporate protections for minorities required by European Community. In response to this decision, the President of Croatia [[Franjo Tuđman]] wrote to Robert Badinter, giving assurances that this deficit would be remedied.&lt;ref name="Rich-48-49"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Roland Rich |title=Recognition of States: The Collapse of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union |journal=European Journal of International Law |year=1993 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=48–49 |url=http://www.ejil.org/pdfs/4/1/1207.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=November 30, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421143955/http://www.ejil.org/pdfs/4/1/1207.pdf |archivedate=April 21, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ukraine]] and [[Latvia]] were the first to react by recognizing Croatian independence in the second week of December.&lt;ref name="Recognition"/&gt; The following week, [[Iceland]] and Germany recognized it, on 19 December 1991, as the first western European countries to do so.&lt;ref name="Recognition"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration (Croatia)]] |url=http://www.mvep.hr/en/foreign-politics/bilateral-relations1/date-of-recognition-and-establishment-of-diplomatic-relations/ |title=Date of Recognition and Establishment of Diplomatic Relation |accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the decisions of the Badinter Commission, the RSK formally declared its separation from Croatia on 19 December, but its statehood and independence were not recognized internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L7UOyPGYBkwC |title=Statehood and the law of self-determination |isbn=978-90-411-1890-5 |publisher=[[Martinus Nijhoff Publishers]] |year=2002 |pages=79–81 |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 December, Yugoslavia announced plans for a smaller state, which could include the territory captured from Croatia during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/27/world/serb-led-presidency-drafts-plan-for-new-and-smaller-yugoslavia.html?ref=croatia |title=Serb-Led Presidency Drafts Plan For New and Smaller Yugoslavia |date=27 December 1991 |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan was rejected by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United Nations |url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N95/766/51/PDF/N9576651.pdf?OpenElement |format=PDF |title=A/RES/49/43 The situation in the occupied territories of Croatia |date=9 February 1995 |accessdate=28 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519235642/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N95/766/51/PDF/N9576651.pdf?OpenElement |archivedate=19 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three more countries decided to recognize Croatia before the EEC-scheduled date of January 15: [[Estonia]], the [[Holy See]], and [[San Marino]].&lt;ref name="Recognition"/&gt;
The European Economic Community finally granted Croatia [[diplomatic recognition]] on 15 January 1992, and the United Nations did so in May 1992.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Germany-23Dec91"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/24/world/slovenia-and-croatia-get-bonn-s-nod.html |title=Slovenia and Croatia Get Bonn's Nod |author=[[Stephen Kinzer]] |date=24 December 1991 |accessdate=29 July 2012 |archivedate=29 July 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69WmZTuSS?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/24/world/slovenia-and-croatia-get-bonn-s-nod.html |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-UN-membership"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/23/world/3-ex-yugoslav-republics-are-accepted-into-un.html |title=3 Ex-Yugoslav Republics Are Accepted Into U.N. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |author=[[Paul L.

==Aftermath==

In the period following the declaration of independence, the war escalated, with the [[Battle of Vukovar|sieges of Vukovar]]&lt;ref name="NYT-Vukovar-Captured"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/18/world/croats-concede-danube-town-s-loss.html?ref=croatia |title=Croats Concede Danube Town's Loss |first=Chuck |last=Sudetic |authorlink=Chuck Sudetic |date=18 November 1991 |accessdate=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Siege of Dubrovnik|Dubrovnik]],&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Dubrovnik-9Nov1991"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/09/world/old-city-totters-in-yugoslav-siege.html?ref=croatia |first=David |last=Binder |title=Old City Totters in Yugoslav Siege |date=9 November 1991 |accessdate=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fighting elsewhere, until a [[Sarajevo Agreement|ceasefire of 3 January 1992]] led to stabilization and a significant reduction of violence.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Jan3-Ceasefire"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/03/world/yugoslav-factions-agree-to-un-plan-to-halt-civil-war.html?ref=croatia |title=Yugoslav Factions Agree to U.N.

With the end of 1991, the second Yugoslavia [[Dissolution of Yugoslavia|effectively ceased to exist as a state]], with the prime minister [[Ante Marković]] and president of the presidency [[Stjepan Mesić]] resigning in December 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=174|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4CrpzRJCbckC|title=Central and South-Eastern Europe 2003|publisher= Routledge|year=2002|isbn= 9781857431360|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[caretaker government]] representing it until the country's formal dissolution in April 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=422|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mButzsYUurkC|title=The Demise of Yugoslavia: A Political Memoir|author=[[Stjepan Mesić]]|publisher=Central European University Press|year=2004|isbn= 9789639241817|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war effectively ended in August 1995 with a decisive victory for Croatia as a result of [[Operation Storm]].&lt;ref name="LATimes-Storm-Complete" /&gt; Present day borders of Croatia were established when the remaining [[Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia (1995-1998)|Serb-held areas of eastern Slavonia]] were restored to Croatia pursuant to the [[Erdut Agreement]] of November 1995, with the process concluded in January 1998.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-UNTAES-16Jan98"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/16/world/an-ethnic-morass-is-returned-to-croatia.html |title=An Ethnic Morass Is Returned to Croatia |author=[[Chris Hedges]] |date=16 January 1998 |accessdate=18 December 2010 |archivedate=4 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69fNS26LX?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/16/world/an-ethnic-morass-is-returned-to-croatia.html?ref=croatia |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indigenous rights''' are those [[rights]] that exist in recognition of the specific condition of the [[indigenous peoples]]. This includes not only the most basic human rights of physical survival and integrity, but also the [[Indigenous land rights|preservation of their land]], [[Indigenous language|language]], [[Ethnic religion|religion]], and other elements of cultural heritage that are a part of their existence as a people. This can be used as an expression for advocacy of social organizations or form a part of the national law in establishing the relation between a government and the right of [[self-determination]] among the indigenous people living within its borders, or in international law as a protection against violation by actions of governments or groups of private interests.

== Definition and historical background ==

The indigenous rights belong to those who, being indigenous peoples, are defined by being the original people of a land that has been conquested and [[colonialism|colonized]] by outsiders.&lt;ref name="Lindholt 6666"&gt;{{cite book |title=Human Rights in Development Yearbook 2003: Human Rights and Local/living Law |last=Lindholt |first=Lone |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |year=2005 |isbn=90-04-13876-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gray 2003"&gt;{{cite book |title=Indigenous Rights and Development: Self-Determination in an Amazonian Community |last=Gray |first=Andrew | authorlink = Andrew Gray (anthropologist)|publisher=Berghahn Books |year=2003 |isbn=1-57181-837-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Keal 2003"&gt;{{cite book |title=European Conquest and the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: The Moral Backwardness of International Society |last=Keal |first=Paul |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-521-82471-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lawandanthropology&gt;{{cite book |title=Law &amp; Anthropology: "Indigenous Peoples, Constitutional States And Treaties Of Other Constructive Arrangements Between Indigenous Peoples And States" |last=Kuppe |first=Rene |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |year=2005 |isbn=90-04-14244-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exactly who is a part of the indigenous peoples is disputed, but can broadly be understood in relation to colonialism. When we speak of indigenous peoples we speak of those pre-colonial societies that face a specific threat from this phenomenon of occupation, and the relation that these societies have with the colonial powers. The exact definition of who are the indigenous people, and the consequent state of rightsholders, varies. It is considered both to be bad to be too inclusive as it is to be non-inclusive.&lt;ref name=Lawandanthropology/&gt;&lt;ref name="culturalsurvival.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/ourpublications/voices/article/recognizing-indigenous-peoples-human-rights|title=RECOGNIZING INDIGENOUS PEOPLES' HUMAN RIGHTS|work=[[Cultural Survival]]|accessdate=20 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111014153/http://www.culturalsurvival.org/ourpublications/voices/article/recognizing-indigenous-peoples-human-rights|archivedate=11 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of modern indigenous people of European colonial powers, the recognition of indigenous rights can be traced to at least the period of [[Renaissance]]. Along with the justification of colonialism with a higher purpose for both the colonists and colonized, some voices expressed concern over the way indigenous peoples were treated and the effect it had on their societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Indigenous Peoples in International Law |last=Anaya |first=S. James | authorlink = James Anaya |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-19-517350-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Spanish Empire]], the crown established the General Indian Court in [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Mexico]] and in [[Indigenous peoples in Peru|Peru]], with jurisdiction over cases involving the indigenous and aimed at protecting Indians from ill-treatment. Indians' access to the court was enabled by a small tax which paid for legal aides.&lt;ref&gt;[[Woodrow Borah]], ''The General Indian Court of Mexico and the Legal Aides of the Half-Real''. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodrow Borah, "Juzgado General de Indios del Perú o juzgado particular de indios de El Cercado de Lima." ''[[Revista chilena de historia del derecho]]'', no. 6 (1970): 129-142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of indigenous rights is also associated with other levels of human struggle. Due to the close relationship between indigenous peoples' cultural and economic situations and their environmental settings, indigenous rights issues are linked with concerns over environmental change and [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/TG/PI/RIGHTS/indig.html|title=Rights of Indigenous Peoples|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923203406/http://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/TG/PI/RIGHTS/indig.html|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/v2i3/suagee23.htm|title=Indigenous Rights and Responsibilities for the Natural World|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125213107/https://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/v2i3/suagee23.htm|archivedate=25 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.uoregon.edu/org/jell/docs/211/OEL105.pdf|title=University of Oregon School of Law|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303183105/https://law.uoregon.edu/org/jell/docs/211/OEL105.pdf|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to scientists and organizations like the [[Rainforest Foundation Fund|Rainforest Foundation]], the struggle for indigenous peoples is essential for solving the problem of reducing carbon emission, and approaching the threat on both cultural and biological diversity in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/10/indigenous-rights-reduced-emissions-deforestation.php|title=Indigenous Rights Crucial To Reducing Carbon Emissions from Deforestation|work=[[TreeHugger]]|accessdate=20 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820193616/http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/10/indigenous-rights-reduced-emissions-deforestation.php|archivedate=20 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conservation through cultural survival: indigenous peoples and protected areas |last=Stevens |first=Stanley |publisher=Island Press |year=1997 |isbn=1-55963-449-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SOWIP&gt;United Nations, [https://web.archive.org/web/20100215113446/http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/SOWIP_web.pdf State of The World's Indigenous Peoples] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215113446/http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/SOWIP_web.pdf |date=February 15, 2010 }} – [[UNPFII]] report, First Issue, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation==
The [[Human rights|rights]], claims and even identity of indigenous peoples are apprehended, acknowledged and observed quite differently from government to government. Various organizations exist with charters to in one way or another promote (or at least acknowledge) indigenous aspirations, and indigenous societies have often banded together to form bodies which jointly seek to further their communal interests.

=== International organizations ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Indigenous rights organizations.PNG|right|thumb|Organizations that struggle for indigenous rights {{ifdc|Indigenous rights organizations.PNG|log=2013 December 27}}]] --&gt;
There are several non-governmental civil society movements, networks, indigenous and non-indigenous organizations whose founding mission is to protect [[Indigenous rights to land along rivers|indigenous rights, including land rights]].&lt;ref name=earthpeoples&gt;[http://earthpeoples.org/missionstatement/missionenglish.html/About Earth Peoples]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations, networks and groups underline that the problems that indigenous peoples are facing is the lack of recognition that they are entitled to live the way they choose, and lack of the right to their lands and territories. Their mission is to protect the rights of indigenous peoples without states imposing their ideas of "development".&lt;ref name=survivalinternational&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.survival-international.org/info|title=About us|author=Survival International|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917124100/http://www.survival-international.org/info|archivedate=17 September 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups say that each indigenous culture is differentiated,  rich of religious believe systems, way of life, substenance and arts, and that the root of  problem would be the interference with their way of living by state's disrespect to their rights,  as well as the invasion of traditional lands by multinational cooperations and small businesses for exploitation of natural resources.
&lt;ref name="International Indian Treaty Council"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treatycouncil.org//info|title=International Indian Treaty Council|work=iitc.org|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations===

Indigenous peoples and their interests are represented in the United Nations primarily through the mechanisms of the [[Working Group on Indigenous Populations]] (WGIP). In April 2000 the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] adopted a resolution to establish the [[United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]] (PFII) as an advisory body to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] with a mandate to review indigenous issues.

In late December 2004, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] proclaimed 2005–2014 to be the ''Second International Decade of the World's Indigenous People''. The main goal of the new decade will be to strengthen international cooperation around resolving the problems faced by indigenous peoples in areas such as culture, education, health, human rights, the environment, and social and economic development.

In September 2007, after a process of preparations, discussions and negotiations stretching back to 1982, the General Assembly adopted the [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]]. The non-binding declaration outlines the individual and collective rights of indigenous peoples, as well as their rights to identity, culture, language, employment, health, education and other issues. Four nations with significant indigenous populations voted against the declaration: the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. All four have since then changed their vote in favour. Eleven nations abstained: [[Azerbaijan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[Burundi]], [[Colombia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]], Russia, [[Samoa]] and [[Ukraine]]. Thirty-four nations did not vote, while the remaining 143 nations voted for it.

===ILO 169===
{{main|ILO 169}}

ILO 169 is a convention of the [[International Labour Organization]]. Once ratified by a state, it is meant to work as a law protecting tribal people's rights. There are twenty-two physical survival and integrity, but also the [[Indigenous land rights|preservation of their land]], [[Indigenous language|language]] [[Ethnic religion|and religion]] rights. The ILO is represents indigenous rights as they are the organisation that enforced instruments the deal with indigenous rights exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/equality-and-discrimination/indigenous-and-tribal-peoples/lang--en/index.htm|title=Indigenous and tribal peoples|website=www.ilo.org|language=en|access-date=2016-05-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508035237/http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/equality-and-discrimination/indigenous-and-tribal-peoples/lang--en/index.htm|archivedate=2016-05-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organization of American States===
Since 1997, the nations of the Organization of American States have been discussing draft versions of a proposed American Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Website of the [http://www.cidh.oas.org/indigenas/chap.2g.htm Proposed American Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525222059/http://www.cidh.oas.org/indigenas/chap.2g.htm |date=2013-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The draft declaration is currently one of the most important processes underway with regard to indigenous rights in the Americas"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iwgia.org/human-rights/regional-bodies-and-mechanisms/organisation-of-american-states|title=Organisation of American States|last=Hansen|first=Jens Søgaard|website=www.iwgia.org|access-date=2016-05-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604093032/http://www.iwgia.org/human-rights/regional-bodies-and-mechanisms/organisation-of-american-states|archivedate=2016-06-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as mentioned by the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs.

===Individual states===
====Canada====
In Canada "Aboriginal rights" ({{lang-fr|droits ancestraux}}) are those rights that indigenous peoples enjoy as a result of their ancestors' long occupancy of the land, for example the right to hunt and fish a particular territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100028605/1100100028606|title=Aboriginal Rights|first=Government of Canada; Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada; Communications|last=Branch|date=|website=www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180417130624/http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100028605/1100100028606|archivedate=17 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are distinct from "[[treaty rights]]" which are enumerated in specific agreements between indigenous groups and the state.  Both treaty rights and Aboriginal rights are protected by [[Section 35]] of the [[Canadian constitution of 1982]].

'''Institute for International Research''', Inc. ('''IIR''') is a subsidiary of [[Informa]] Plc. It grew from its founding to 1973 to become one of the world's largest [[Convention (meeting)|conference]] providers. It has been part of the Informa Group since 2005.

==Overview==
The company was started by [[Irvine Laidlaw, Baron Laidlaw]] in 1973 and sold to [[Informa]] for a reported GBP 768 million in 2005.&lt;ref name="Times1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article3822710.ece|title=Tory peer Lord Laidlaw seeks treatment for sex addiction|publisher=The Sunday Times|date=27 April 2008|accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ind2005-1"&gt;Reece, Damian (2 June 2005).

==Operations==
In 1989, IIR Inc. in the United States acquired institutions in order to enter the seminar and training business. Acquisitions included training organisers such as [[ESI International]], [[Achieve Global]] Huthwaite followed by Omega Performance and Communispond. Debra Chipman is the current{{When|date=February 2012}} president and chief executive officer of the Institute for International Research, Inc, which operates as a subsidiary of IIR Ltd.

Many IIR conferences, workshops and training courses are conducted in Europe each year. These cover many topics including general management, finance, banking and energy. IIR has been active in Austria since 1992. Annual congresses held in Austria include ''Epcon"''(energy), ''tel.con'' (telecommunications industry), ''Pulse'' (health), ''Course'' (banking sector) and the ''ÖVT'' (insurance industry). IIR has been operating in Germany since 1989 with 200 employees, 14 divisions and about 2000 events.

The '''Kasur child sexual abuse scandal''' is a series of [[child sexual abuse]]s that occurred in Hussain Khanwala village in [[Kasur District]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]] from 2006 to 2014, culminating in a major [[political scandal]] in 2015. After the discovery of hundreds of [[video clips]] showing children performing [[Forced sex|forced sex acts]], various [[Media in Pakistan|Pakistani media organizations]] estimated that 280 to 300 children, most of them male, were victims of sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="The Nation 1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Javed|first1=Ashraf|title=Country's biggest child abuse scandal jolts Punjab|url=http://nation.com.pk/national/08-Aug-2015/country-s-biggest-child-abuse-scandal-jolts-punjab|accessdate=11 August 2015|work=The Nation|date=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal involved an [[organized crime]] ring that sold [[child pornographer|child pornography]] to [[porn sites]], and [[blackmailed]] and [[extorted]] relatives of the victims.&lt;ref name=Tribune&gt;{{cite news|title=Kasur child porn case: Amid nationwide outrage, PM vows to punish culprits|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/935123/kasur-child-porn-scandal-amid-nationwide-outrage-pm-vows-to-punish-culprits/|accessdate=11 August 2015|work=The Express Tribune|agency=PPI|date=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scandal caused nationwide outrage,&lt;ref name=Tribune /&gt; among allegations that the [[Punjab Police (Pakistan)|Punjab police]] and [[Malik Ahmad Saeed Khan]], Kasur's [[Member of the Provincial Assembly]] from the ruling [[Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz)]], were involved in an attempted cover-up of the abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Out on streets: ‘Kasur DPO, RPO and lawmakers must be sacked’|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/935812/out-on-streets-kasur-dpo-rpo-and-lawmakers-must-be-sacked/|accessdate=11 August 2015|work=The Express Tribune|date=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is cited by both [[news agencies]] and [[government departments]] as the largest child abuse scandal in [[History of Pakistan|Pakistan's history]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/935471/kasur-child-pornography-ring-lawyer-accuses-police-of-protecting-culprits/ ''The Express Tribune'': Kasur child pornography ring: Lawyer accuses police of protecting culprits]&lt;/ref&gt; Besides large-scale public condemnation, 50 [[Ulama|Pakistani clergy]] and religious scholars issued a [[fatwa]] (religious decree) for capital punishment of the culprits, and demanded that the government console the victims and their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Ulema decree to ‘hang’ Kasur child molesters |url=http://arynews.tv/en/ulema-decree-to-hang-kasur-child-molesters |accessdate=11 August 2015|work=ARY News|date=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abuse==
Ashraf Javed, a [[Reporter|staff reporter]] for [[The Nation (Pakistan)|''The Nation'']], broke the news that a gang of 20 to 25 men had allegedly filmed up to 400 videos of [[child sexual abuse]], involving at least 280 children of Hussain Khanwala village in [[Kasur]].&lt;ref name="The Nation 1"/&gt; In one instance, the father of one of the victims was blackmailed into paying [[Pakistani rupee|PKR]] 1.2 million to the abusers, who had threatened to release a video of his son being raped.&lt;ref name="aa_tr"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aa.com.tr/en/world/572735--growing-child-abuse-scandal-in-pakistani-village | title=Growing child abuse scandal in Pakistani village | accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police involvement==

===Clash between police and protesters===
On 8 August 2015, villagers from Hussain Khanwala and adjacent villages clashed with policemen in Dolaywala village along Deepalpur Road, after protesting the police's failure to stop the abuse ring. Police cordoned off the roads leading to the village to stop the protesters; As a police contingent tried to halt the mob led by Mobeen Ahmed, the latter pelted stones. Police [[teargas]]sed and [[baton charge]]d the crowd, which then damaged official vehicles on Deepalpur Road. DSPs Hassan Farooq Ghumman and Arif Rasheed; Ganda Singh SHO Akmal Kausar; policemen Akbar, Sajid, Riaz, Naeem, Ahmed Ali, Akbar Ghani and Muhammad Akmal; and 15 protesters were injured in the clash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ansari|first1=Afzal|title=Two DSPs among 25 injured as mob takes on police|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1198473|accessdate=11 August 2015|work=Dawn|date=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government reaction==

===Rana Sanaullah controversy===
The [[Government of Punjab, Pakistan|Government of Punjab]]'s initial statement came from Punjab Minister of Law [[Rana Sanaullah]] on 8 August 2015, who stated that a government inquiry committee concluded that no instance of child sex abuse had been reported. Sanaullah said that "reports to this effect surfaced after two parties involved in a [[land dispute]] registered 'fake cases' against each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kasur child molestation scandal baseless, says inquiry report|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1199249|accessdate=11 August 2015|work=Dawn|date=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chief Minister's reaction===
On 9 August 2015, the [[Chief Minister of Punjab (Pakistan)|Chief Minister of Punjab]] [[Shehbaz Sharif]] ordered the Punjab Home Department to request Chief Justice of the [[Lahore High Court]] Manzoor Ahmed Malik to constitute a [[judicial inquiry]] into the sex abuse case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shahbaz promises judicial inquiry into Kasur incident|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-5-333334-Shahbaz-promises-judicial-inquiry-into-|accessdate=11 August 2015|work=The News International|date=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the next day, the Chief Justice rejected the request, observing that the Punjab police was already investigating the case hence there was no need of a separate judicial commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=LHC rejects govt's application to form judicial commission over Kasur child porn case|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/935629/lhc-rejects-govts-application-to-form-judicial-commission-over-kasur-child-porn-case/|accessdate=18 January 2018|work=Express Tribune|date=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meyer Guggenheim''' (February 1, 1828 – March 15, 1905)&lt;ref name=britannica /&gt; was the [[patriarch]] of what became known as the [[Guggenheim family]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Lengnau, Aargau|Lengnau]], [[Aargau]], Switzerland on February 1, 1828. He was of [[Ashkenazi Jew]]ish ancestry and emigrated to the United States in 1847.&lt;ref name=britannica /&gt;  He started out in the importing business, but made his and his family's fortune (which was one of the largest fortunes of the 19th century) in [[mining]] and [[smelting]].

Guggenheim invested in silver mines of the [[Leadville mining district]] of [[Colorado]]. From mining he expanded into ore smelting, also in Colorado, then built a number of smelters across the US and in northern Mexico. As his sons grew up, they took leading roles in the family mining and smelting business.&lt;ref&gt;National Mining Hall of Fame, [http://www.mininghalloffame.org/inductee.asp?i=32&amp;b=inductees%2Easp&amp;t=n&amp;p=G&amp;s= Meyer Guggenheim], accessed 13 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mochajombies.jpg|thumb|Moko jumbie dancers in [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands]].]]
A '''moko jumbie''' (also known as "moko jumbi" or "mocko jumbie") is a [[Stilt walking|stilts walker]] or dancer. "Moko" means healer in Central Africa and "[[jumbee|jumbi]]", a [[West Indian]] term for a ghost or spirit that may have been derived from the [[Kongo language]] word ''zumbi''. The Moko Jumbies are thought to originate from [[West African]] tradition brought to the Caribbean.

A Moko Jumbie character may wear colorful garb and carnival masks. They also frequent festivals and celebrations such as [[Trinidad and Tobago Carnival]].

While the god Moko is from the [[Kongo people|Kongo]] (or Congo) and [[Nigeria]], from the [[Maasai people]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] has added their own touch to him. Moko, in the traditional sense, is a god.  He watches over his village, and due to his towering height, he is able to foresee danger and evil. His name, Moko, literally means the “diviner” and he would be represented by men on towering stilts and performs acts that were unexplainable to the human eye.  In one remote tribe, the Moko rises from a regular man's height to the skies fluidly with no help and descends similarly to leave others to wonder how he performed such an act.

The Moko arrived in Trinidad by “walking all the way across the Atlantic Ocean from the West coast of Africa, laden with many, many centuries of experience, and, in spite of all inhuman attacks and encounters, yet still walks tall, tall, tall. (John Cupid, Caribbean Beat)” The idea of the Moko survived by living in the hearts of African descendants during slavery and colonial life to eventually walk the streets of Trinidad in a celebration of freedom, [[Carnival]].  While this figure was rooted in African heritage, Trinidad adapted the figure, notably by adding on Jumbie or ghost to the name.  By the early 1900s Moko Jumbies had become an element of Trinidad’s Carnival.  This figure would walk the streets of [[Port of Spain]] and other cities protecting the city and revelers from evil.  As part of his role in Carnival the Moko Jumbie would accept donations from onlookers in upper floors of buildings. However, his notable figure of Carnival slowly faded until a drastic revival.

By the early 1990s, Moko Jumbies were essentially non-existent in Carnival, until two men brought this tradition back. These men, namely Moose and Dragon, have brought the Moko Jumbie back to a place of prominence in Carnival and created a new kind of Moko Jumbie.  One man originally brought the idea to them as well as the knowledge of how to make stilts.  The style of stilts they walked was very similar to the modern day ones but with one main difference, they had no front leg brace.  This changed when a man named Ben Block from [[Canada]], a random traveler, came to Trinidad with a pair of stilts.  He had a frontal brace on the upper leg and the Trinidadians took inspiration from this design and used it in their own.  Now there are two main Moko Jumbie bands in Trinidad, Watusi and Kilimanjaro, as well as several smaller ones.  So while the idea of the Moko came from Africa, Trinidad has made it its own.

==In popular culture==
In 2009 the U.S. Department of Tourism of the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] adopted the moko jumbie as a symbol for the islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usvipressroom.com/documents/p74.pdf Mocko Jumbie logo press release]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Association of Colored Women Clubs''' ('''NACWC''') is an American organization that was formed in July 1896 at the First Annual Convention of the National Federation of Afro-American Women in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States, by a merger of the [[The First National Conference of the Colored Women of America#The National Federation of Afro-American Women|National Federation of African-American Women]], the [[Woman's Era Club]] of Boston, and the [[National League of Colored Women]] of Washington, DC, at the call of [[Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nacwc.org/aboutus/index.html "Who Are We"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223030153/http://www.nacwc.org/aboutus/index.html |date=2015-02-23 }}, NACW.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1896 to 1904 it was known as the '''National Association of Colored Women''' ('''NACW'''). It adopted the motto "Lifting as we climb", to demonstrate to "an ignorant and suspicious world that our aims and interests are identical with those of all good aspiring women." When incorporated in 1904, NACW became known as the '''National Association of Colored Women's Clubs (NACWC)'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/404462/National-Association-of-Colored-Womens-Clubs-NACWC "National Association of Colored Women’s Clubs (NACWC)"], Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See The Records of the National Association of Colored Women’s Clubs, 1895-1992, Part 1:  Minutes of National Conventions, and President’s Correspondence [microfilm] © National Association of Colored Women’s Clubs, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

“In 1895 an obscure man in an obscure Missouri town sent a letter broad-cast over this country and England, reflecting upon the character and morals of our Women.  So utterly false were the vile statement, that the women were aroused as never before and when Mrs. Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin, President of the New Era Club of Boston, called a meeting of protest in July 1895, the indignant women from North, South, East and West flocked to the “Classic Hub”, and in no uncertain terms vindicated the honor of the Race.  The National Federation of Colored Women’s Club was the result of that meeting, with Mrs. Booker T. Washington at its head.  However, another National organization, the Women’s Loyal Union, with Mrs. Cooke (née Helen Appo Cook) as President existed at Washington and the women soon realized that two organizations so identically similar could not work harmoniously as separate units.  Therefore, the two organizations met in July 1896, and each appointed a committee to arrange for a consolidation, which was effected and the National Association of C.W.C came into existence with Mrs. Mary Church Terrell, of international fame, as President.  This joint session was attended by some of the most notable women of our Race, among whom were Harriet Tubman. Francis E.W. Harper, poet and writer, Victoria E. Matthews, founder of the White Rose Mission of New York, Josephine S. Yates, teacher and writer, an others.  Mrs. Ida B. Wells Barnett and Elizabeth Lindsay Davis were the delegates from Illinois.”  Elizabeth Lindsay Davis, N.A.C.W.C. Historian, 1933 &lt;ref&gt;Davis, Elizabeth Lindsay National Association of Colored Women:  Lifting As They Climb, © National Association of Colored Women, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Association of Colored Women (later National Association of Colored Women's Clubs) was established in [[Washington, D.C.]], on July 21, 1896. This first of what would later become biennial convention meetings of the association was held at the [[Nineteenth Street Baptist Church (Washington, D.C.)|Nineteenth Street Baptist Church]]. The organizations attending this convention included the [[National Federation of Afro-American Women]], the [[Woman's Era Club]] of Boston, and the [[National League of Colored Women]] of Washington, DC, the Women's Loyal Union as well as smaller organizations that had arisen from the [[African-American]] [[Woman's club movement|women's club movement]]. These organizations and later others across the country merged to form the National Association of Colored Women. The organization helped all African-American women by working on issues of civil rights and injustice, such as women’s suffrage, lynching, and Jim Crow laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://decolonizingourhistory.com/club-movement/|title=The Black Women's Club Movement|last=|first=|date=|website=DeColonizing Our History|publisher=|access-date=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founders of the NACWC included [[Harriet Tubman]], [[Margaret Murray Washington]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.illinoisstate.edu/kalmbach/351/hypertext98/hankins/african/Washington.html |title=Margaret Murray Washington |publisher=English.illinoisstate.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frances E.W. Harper]], [[Ida B. Wells|Ida Bell Wells-Barnett]], and [[Mary Church Terrell]]. Its two leading members were [[Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin]] and [[Mary Church Terrell]]. Their original intention was "to furnish evidence of the moral, mental and material progress made by people of color through the efforts of our women". They organized to refute a letter written by James Jacks, the president of the Missouri Press Association, challenging the respectability of African-American women, and referring to them as thieves and prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Gray White, [https://books.google.com/books?id=v6-fS190xuIC&amp;dq=white+too+heavy+a+load&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=aZApS6-NIM-LlAfNga2jBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=jacks&amp;f=false ''Too Heavy a Load: Black Women in Defense of Themselves, 1894-1994''], W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the next ten years, the NACWC became involved in campaigns in favor of women's suffrage and against [[lynching]] and [[Jim Crow laws]]. They also led efforts to improve education, and care for both children and the elderly.  By 1918, when the United States entered the [[World War I|First World War]], membership in the NACWC had grown to an extraordinary 300,000 nationwide.

===Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin and Mary Church Terrell===
That the National Association of Colored Women was the most prominent organization formed during the [[African-American Woman Suffrage Movement]] was due chiefly to the efforts of Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin and Mary Church Terrell. Both women were educated and had economically successful parents.

Born on August 31, 1842, in Boston, Josephine St. Pierre was the daughter of John St. Pierre, a successful clothes dealer from [[Martinique]] and Elizabeth Matilda Menhenick from [[Cornwall, England]]. Her parents supported her going to school in Salem for its integrated schools, rather than attend segregated ones in Boston.  There Josephine St. Pierre flourished. At the age of 16, she married [[George Lewis Ruffin]], who became the first African-American graduate of [[Harvard Law School]]. Among their early activities was recruiting black soldiers for the Union Army during the Civil War. 
[[Image:National Association of Colored Women headquarters.JPG|thumb|right|200px|National Association of Colored Women headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
After her husband died in 1886, Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin used part of her estate to fund ''Woman’s Era'', the first journal published by and for African-American women. She was a vice-president of the National Association of Colored Women. In 1910 Ruffin enlarged her social activism by helping form the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP). She died in March 1924.

[[Mary Church Terrell]] was the daughter of Robert Church, Sr., a former slave and reputed son of a white master. Church, Sr. built a business and became one of the wealthiest black men in the South. He was able to send Mary to [[Oberlin College]], where she earned both bachelor's and master's degrees. Years later Mary Church Terrell spoke at the [[Berlin International Congress of Women]], giving her speech in fluent German and French, as well as English. She was the only black woman at the conference.

Terrell was elected as the first president of the National Association of Colored Women in 1896. She led the struggle in Washington, DC against [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in public eating places and succeeded in winning a court decision for integration there. Terrell died in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], on July 24, 1954.

'''Noolaham Foundation''' is a non-profit, charitable organization founded to provide enhanced access to information sources and foster knowledge-based development in [[Sri Lanka]]. It is a registered organization (GA 2390) based in Sri Lanka with volunteer participation from all over the world.&lt;ref name="noolahamfaq"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://noolahamfoundation.org/wiki/index.php?title=FAQ|title=Noolaham FAQ|accessdate=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noolaham Foundation was initiated as Project Noolaham in 2005. In 2010, it was formally incorporated in Sri Lanka.

Noolaham Foundation was created with a view to documenting, preserving and disseminating texts and sources that speak about the social, economic, cultural and political discourses related to the [[Sri Lankan Tamil]] speaking communities. In the post-independence Sri Lanka, sites of knowledge production and knowledge preservation of the Tamil speaking communities such as the [[Jaffna Public Library]] has been lost. Therefore, it is important that we create alternative, virtual platforms where this knowledge could be preserved. Such platforms can also cater to the needs of local and international researchers who are interested in studying the various aspects of the Sri Lankan Tamil speaking communities. Noolaham Foundation is one such platform.

==Programs==
The Foundation runs programs and projects including
* Research based documentation projects
* [[Digital preservation]] initiatives
* [[Digital library]], Virtual Learning Support and other [[Information Services]]
* Awareness raising related to [[information literacy]], [[knowledge management]], digital preservation, open access etc.

==Achievements==
* Digitized over 55,000 documents related to Sri Lankan Tamil communities.&lt;ref name="Roar"&gt;{{cite web | url= https://roar.media/english/life/in-the-know/this-digital-library-is-preserving-sri-lankas-tamil-literary-heritage/|title=This Digital Library Is Preserving Sri Lanka's Tamil Literary Heritage|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Created a vast digital library (www.noolaham.org) with special collections such as Muslim Archive and Malaiyaham Archive
* Digitized collections of various individuals and institutions such as [[Jaffna Hindu College]], [[Royal College, Colombo|Colombo Royal College]] and [[Vembadi Girls’ High School]]
* Digitized 24 sets of rare palm leaf manuscripts.&lt;ref name="Scroll"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://scroll.in/article/802923/sri-lankan-tamils-around-the-world-have-built-an-online-library-to-replace-one-torched-in-1981|title=Sri Lankan Tamils around the world have built an online library to replace one torched in 1981|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Created a virtual learning platform for school students with thousands of resources (www.epallikoodam.org)
* Conducted the first Tamil Documentation Conference and many other seminars and workshops on documentation, digitization etc.
* Collected data-sets about people, places and institutions (3,000+ entries)

The '''Pilgrims of Arès''' is the name of a [[new religious movement]] founded in 1974 and whose founder was Michel Potay. It was named after the town of [[Arès]], Gironde, where Michel Potay received revelations. Beliefs and practices are based on the ''Revelation of Arès'', written by Potay.

==Structure and practices==

===Members and geographical area===
The Pilgrims of Arès are organized in a decentralized manner. According to a critic of the group, the movement has about "500 to 2,000 followers".&lt;ref name="Report"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rapport fait au nom de la Commission d'enquête sur les sectes — ''Les sectes en France'' |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-enq/r2468.asp |publisher=Assemblée Nationale |language=French |year=1995 |accessdate=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to another critic of the movement, the Pilgrims of Arès live sometimes isolated, sometimes in groups or missions. Legally, they form regional assemblies as the "Workers of the Harvest" ("Les Ouvriers de la Moisson"), "The Eye Opens" ("L'Œil s'Ouvre," created in Bordeaux on 4 March 1987, dissolved in 2001), "The Brothers of the Dawn" ("Frères de l'Aube"), "The Torrents" (created in Paris in 1989), or larger associations, such as "The Work of the Pilgrimage of Arès." Also according to the same association, the Pilgrims of Arès would develop missions in Germany, Belgium (Liège), France, United Kingdom, Hungary, Ireland, Poland, Russia and Switzerland (Geneva, Neuchâtel, Zurich). The movement begins to expand outside Europe, with members in Africa, Australia, New Zealand and America (U.S. and Canada).&lt;ref name="Vigi"&gt;{{cite web |title=Les Pèlerins d'Arès |url=http://www.vigi-sectes.org/visage_decouvert/pelerins_ares.html |publisher=Vigi-sectes |language=French |accessdate=26 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406094332/http://www.vigi-sectes.org/visage_decouvert/pelerins_ares.html |archivedate=6 April 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organization and meetings===
The believer has a spiritual and individual freedom. The Pilgrims may be defined as any person who accepts the word of the ''Revelation of Arès''. Two essential elements provide yet cohesive movement, otherwise very disparate and that reject any idea of centralized organization: ''The Revelation of Arès'' and their prophet, Michel Potay. Publishing and disseminating the message of this book is one of the main purposes of the movement. The House of Revelation, in Arès, publishes ''The Revelation of Arès'', and provides bookstores and libraries. Periodicals ''The Pilgrim of Arès'', ''Brothers of the Dawn'' (''Frères de l'Aube''), ''The Egala'h'', ''The Bul'fda'' and pamphlets are also published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Que sait-on de... Arès |url=http://www.prevensectes.com/ares1.htm |publisher=Prevensectes |author=[[UNADFI]] |work=BULLES |language=French |year=2000 |accessdate=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The associative structure then responds to these needs.&lt;ref name="Chantin"&gt;{{cite book | first=Jean-Pierre |last=Chantin |title=Des sectes dans la France contemporaine : 1905–2000, contestations ou innovations religieuses |place=Toulouse |year=2004 |isbn=2-7089-6855-6 |pages=94–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[prophet]] who claims that God spoke to him directly, Potay is the founder of the movement, and is the coordinator between the various associations. Sociologist [[Jean-François Mayer]] thinks there is a tendency in sanctifying Michel Potay, but after having invested heavily in conferences and meetings, he is more discreet now. The continuation of the movement is mainly done by believers themselves.&lt;ref name="Chantin"/&gt;

The Pilgrims of Arès believers are free&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Religions &gt; Mouvements divers &gt; Mouvements divers – 1 |url=http://www.quid.fr/2007/Religions/Mouvements_Divers/1 |publisher=Quid |language=French |year=2007 |accessdate=26 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130121512/http://www.quid.fr/2007/Religions/Mouvements_Divers/1 |archivedate=30 November 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are grouped into associations of local mission, called "Assemblies of God." Legally and for practical purposes, they are formed as [[voluntary association]]s. The first assembly was founded in Bordeaux in 1976, followed by a second in Paris in 1978.&lt;ref name="Chantin"/&gt; It was created sixty associations linked to the faith in France, in twenty French cities. These associations publish periodicals, pamphlets, organize conferences and meetings. However, no association represents Pilgrims of Arès in full. One of them, named The Work of the Pilgrimage of Arès, organizes the pilgrimage to the House of the Holy Word.

===Pilgrimage===
A [[pilgrimage]] in Arès was founded in 1974. Followers go to the House of the Holy Word (Maison de la Sainte Parole), the place of supposed [[theophanies]] received by Potay, to pray and receive the Fire, a strengthening of his faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Michel Potay et la Révélation d'Arès |first=Jean-François |last=Mayer |url=http://htba.free.fr/integral/Mayer.pdf |publisher=Les Trois Nornes |place=Fribourg |year=1990 |language=French |isbn=2-88210-004-3 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilgrims practice "free" prayer, which is to chant softly extracts of sacred books: the Bible, the Quran and ''The Revelation of Arès''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Michel Potay et la Révélation d'Arès |first=Jean-François |last=Mayer |url=http://htba.free.fr/integral/Mayer.pdf |publisher=Les Trois Nornes |place=Fribourg |year=1990 |language=French |isbn=2-88210-004-3 |pages=19–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton"&gt;{{cite book |first1=J. Gordon |last1=Melton |first2=Martin |last2=Baumann |first3=David B. |last3=Barrett |first4=Donald |last4=Wiebe |first5=Diana |last5=Eck |title=Religions of the world : a comprehensive encyclopedia of beliefs and practices |volume=1 / 4 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |place=Santa Barbara, California |date=September 2002 |isbn=1-57607-223-1 |pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; To access the House of the Holy Word, each pilgrim must answer three questions:
* "Do you believe that the Bible, the Quran and the Revelation of Arès are from God?"
* "Do you love all humans?"
* "Do you forgive the sins?"

However, what is important is mainly the pilgrim's motives. The pilgrim is then allowed to enter the House of the Holy Word, but he must remove his shoes and wear a white tunic. He then puts his hand down the front, and prostrates himself to kiss the ground.&lt;ref name="Chantin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton"/&gt;

The House of Revelation (Maison de la Révélation) is the place where Jesus allegedly appeared in 1974. During the pilgrimage, seminars, public missions and film screenings are organized.&lt;ref name="Vigi"/&gt;

==The Revelation of Ares==
''The Revelation of Ares'' is made of two parts:
* ''The Gospel Given at Ares'', which Michel Potay claims to have received from Jesus in 1974, physically present during 39 or 40 nights in Michel Potay's home at Ares;
* ''The Book'', which Michel Potay received in 1977 from God himself, manifesting himself during five nights in another part of Michel Potay's home at Ares, now named ''The House of the Holy Word''.
''The Revelation of Ares'' is supposed to be the continuation of the Bible and the Quran, as expressed in chapter 2 of ''The Revelation of Ares''. To distinguish ''The Gospel Given at Ares'' from ''The Book'', Potay's references to chapters are given in Arabic numeral for ''The Gospel Given at Ares'', and in Roman numerals for ''The Book''. In both cases, Michel Potay said he wrote on paper the message he was hearing. ''The Gospel Given at Ares'' is written in classical French, but ''The Book'' is written in a non-grammatical manner using mostly French words but also words from other languages. Michel Potay claims that God put in his mind the meaning of ''The Book'', so that he could explain it to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;The Revelation of Ares, Bilingual Edition (English &amp; French), published in 1996, 777 pages, {{ISBN|2901821073}}, {{ISBN|978-2901821076}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Revelation of Ares''' core message is to practice and develop, within oneself and with everyone: love, forgiveness, freedom, creativity and spiritual intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Frère Michel Potay, Et ce que tu auras écrit, Arès, France, Maison de la Révélation, coll. « Le pèlerin d'Arès », 1991-1992, broché ({{ISBN|2-901821-06-5}}), p.74-76&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Revelation of Ares'' also puts forward a social message that both religion and politics should disappear, since religion is against freedom and does not come from God but should be replaced by spirituality,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freesoulblog.net/jDD/jDDuv.html&lt;/ref&gt; and since political leadership is against freedom, it should be replaced by competent management.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freesoulblog.net/jME/jMEuv.html&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, pilgrims of Arès have the spiritual and social mission to spread around them the good Word of God to free humankind&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freesoulblog.net/jM9/jM9uv.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finances==
The movement is financed by donations from pilgrims of Arès who pay a tithe of 5% of their income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Vernette |first2=Claire |last2=Moncelon |url=http://pagesperso-orange.fr/sos.derivesectaire/FICHES/ares.htm |title=Dictionnaire des groupes religieux aujourd'hui (religions – églises – sectes – nouveaux mouvements religieux – mouvements spiritualistes) |publisher=SOS Dérives sectaires |language=French |year=1995 |accessdate=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As recommended in ''The Revelation of Arès'' (34 / 6), they pay their donations to Potay himself. However, the group says these donations are discretionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revelation-ares-limoges.info/pelerins-ares.php|title=les pèlerins d'Arès|publisher=revelation-ares-limoges.info|accessdate=21 January 2014|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult allegations==
One of the group's organizations, The Eye Opens, founded in 1987 in Bordeaux, was listed as [[cult]] in the 1995 French parliamentary report established by the [[Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France]], in the category "Cultic movements with 500 to 2,000 followers." The report considered the association as an "apocalyptic" and "healer" cult.&lt;ref name="Report"/&gt;

In 2005, a [[MIVILUDES]] report cited Pilgrims of Arès in the chapter on healing through prayer.

'''Plato's Retreat''' was a [[swingers' club]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City|New York]], NY, USA,  operating from 1977 until 1985 and catering to [[heterosexual]] couples and [[bisexual]] women.
&lt;ref name=pecker&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedman |first=Josh Alan|author-link=Josh Alan Friedman |editor-last=|editor-first= |title=Tales of Times Square|publisher=[[Feral House]]|date=1993|orig-year=1986 |pages=98–124 |chapter=Pecker Full of Miracles|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment==
In 1976, Larry Levenson, a high school friend of [[Al Goldstein]] and a former fast-food manager who was selling ice cream at [[Coney Island]], was introduced  to the [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinging lifestyle]] by a woman he met at a bar.&lt;ref name=observed/&gt; After organizing swinging parties himself for a time, he opened a club "for swingers" in 1977&lt;ref name=wild&gt;{{cite book |last= Heidenry |first=Jean|author-link=Josh Alan Friedman |editor-last=|editor-first= |title=What Wild Ecstasy: The Rise and Fall of the Sexual Revolution|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|date=2002|orig-year=|page=221 |chapter=|isbn=0743241843}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in the basement of the Kenmore Hotel on East 23rd Street between Lexington and Third Avenue, and called it "Plato's Retreat." The same year, he moved it to the basement of the [[Ansonia Hotel]], a 19th-century building on 2109 [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] between West 73rd and [[West 74th Street]]s on the [[Upper West Side]] of [[Manhattan]]. The hotel used to house [[Continental Baths]], a [[gay bathhouse]] where [[Bette Midler]], often accompanied by [[Barry Manilow]] on piano, provided musical entertainment early in her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cooperator.com/articles/1200/1/Inside-the-Ansonia/Page1.html |title=Inside the Ansonia |first=Mary K. |last=Fons |work=The Cooperator |date=September 2005 |accessdate=2 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules and premises==
Plato's Retreat was a "members-only" establishment that required everyone to follow the club's rules. Levenson barred male [[homosexual]]s, and accepted only straight couples &amp;ndash; and women, escorted or otherwise &amp;ndash; in the premises. Once a woman left a room after a sexual encounter, her male companion had to accompany her within two minutes. This rule was intended to ensure that women nearly always outnumbered men. Levenson strictly prohibited sexual activity between males but welcomed [[lesbian]]s. [[Recreational drug use|Drugs]], including [[alcohol]], and [[prostitution]] services were forbidden,&lt;ref name=pecker/&gt; though, by subsequent accounts, prostitutes did frequent the premises&lt;ref name=back&gt;{{cite news |last1=Abele|first1=Robert|last2= Goldstein|first2=Gary|last3=Thomas|first3= Kevin|last4=Linden|first4=Sheri|date=3 April 2009 |title='American Swing' looks back at sex club Plato's Retreat |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/apr/03/entertainment/et-capsules3|dead-url=no |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there was "rampant" use of drugs (most often [[quaaludes]]) by patrons.&lt;ref name=observed/&gt;

According to a 1979 advertisement in ''[[SCREW (magazine)|SCREW]]'' magazine, the club offered, besides a heated swimming pool, a [[sauna]] steam, [[whirlpool bath]]s, disco dancing, free bar and buffet, "cozy living rooms and lounging areas", a "variety of swing areas", and a [[backgammon]] lounge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work= [[SCREW (magazine)|SCREW]] |page=47 |date=June 18, 1979|title=Plato's Retreat |url=http://40.media.tumblr.com/9222b013b59d4ea1830c10bff900f81b/tumblr_n9uk3hEmQC1sbtct0o1_1280.jpg |accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fame==
During its heyday, Plato's Retreat was considered the world's most infamous sex club,&lt;ref name=observed&gt;{{cite news |last=Hart |first=Jon|date=22 September 2002 |title=Fantasy Island |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/22/nyregion/new-york-observed-fantasy-island.html|dead-url=no |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; popular with celebrities, [[porn star]]s, and well-to-do couples. The clientele was described as "an assortment of kinky types from the [[suburbs]]: dry cleaners and their wives, or fat men in [[toupee]]s with their heavily made-up girlfriends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gaines |first=Steven |title=The Sky's the Limit: Passion and Property in Manhattan |year=2005 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York |isbn=0-316-60851-3 |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owner Levenson often partook in sexual activity on the premises, once winning a bet against Al Goldstein and 'Butch' Katz, owner of 42nd Street's Roxy Burlesk theater, that he could [[Ejaculation|ejaculate]] fifteen times within a twenty-four-hour day.&lt;ref name=pecker/&gt;

In 1980, Plato's relocated to 509 West 34th Street.&lt;ref name="clubs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.disco-disco.com/clubs/other-clubs.shtml |title=Other Legendary Clubs |publisher=Disco-Disco.com |accessdate=2 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline and closure==
In 1985, New York City Mayor [[Ed Koch]] backed the [[New York City Health Department]]'s decision to shut down the city's gay bathhouses, in response to concerns over the spread of [[HIV/AIDS]]. In closing the gay bathhouses while allowing the heterosexual swingers' clubs &amp;ndash; most notably Plato's Retreat &amp;ndash; to remain open, the city found itself in violation of the newly adopted anti-discrimination law. The Health Department, with Koch's approval, reacted by ordering the heterosexual clubs, including Plato's Retreat, to close as well. The club's Manhattan location was shut down on New Year's Eve 1985, ostensibly for violating public-health ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Golubski|first=Suzanne|author2=Kappstatter, Bob|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|title=Swinging doors shut: City probe KO's Plato's|date=|url=http://www.wmob.com/artpages/platos1.html|accessdate=21 September 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927043031/http://www.wmob.com/artpages/platos1.html|archivedate=27 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Levenson and his by-then two partners along with Plato’s [[accountant]] were tried and convicted for [[tax evasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

After serving his sentence, Levenson worked in various jobs, such as [[cab driver]]. He died in 1999 after a [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|quadruple bypass heart surgery]].&lt;ref name=beast&gt;{{cite news |last=Hart |first=Jon |date=7 April 2009 |title=The Studio 54 of Sex|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-studio-54-of-sex |dead-url=no |work=[[The Daily Beast]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=2013-10-18 |access-date=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Florida==
Plato's Retreat relocated to [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], [[Florida]], where it reopened under the name "Plato's Retreat 2." Located at 321 West Sunrise, the new location was in operation as an on-premises heterosexual [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swingers' club]], open Monday through Sunday from eight p.m. until the last person left. Saturday night was for couples only. Plato's Retreat in Fort Lauderdale was a [[BYOB (acronym)#Bottle club|bring-your-own-bottle]] club, since no liquor was sold on the premises; however, it provided complimentary mixers, soft drinks, juices, and ice.

In 2006, Plato's Retreat 2 closed, and then reopened as a sex club "for men only," keeping the same location and bring-your-own format. The club at the Fort Lauderdale location currently operates under the business name "321 Slammer."&lt;ref&gt;[http://321slammer.com 321 Slammer] website&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s, there are reportedly numerous on-premises swingers' clubs operating in [[South Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mooney |first=Michael J.|date=3 March 2011 |title=South Florida sex clubs revealed|url=https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/south-florida-sex-clubs-revealed-6379994|dead-url=no |work=[[Miami New Times]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=2013-10-18 |access-date=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Press Freedom Index''' is an annual compiled and published by [[Reporters Without Borders]] based upon the organisation's own assessment of the countries' [[Freedom of the press|press freedom]] records in the previous year. It intends to reflect the degree of freedom that journalists, news organisations, and [[netizens]] have in each country, and the efforts made by authorities to respect this freedom. Reporters Without Borders is careful to note that the index only deals with press freedom and does not measure the quality of journalism nor does it look at human rights violations in general.&lt;ref name=RWBPFIHow&gt;[http://en.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/2013_wpfi_methodology.pdf How the index was compiled] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819031406/http://en.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/2013_wpfi_methodology.pdf |date=19 August 2013 }}, Reporters Without Border, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The report is partly based on a questionnaire&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsf.org/index/qEN.html 2013 World Press Freedom Index Questionnaire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213160017/http://rsf.org/index/qEN.html |date=13 February 2013 }}, Reporters Without Borders, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; which asks questions about pluralism, [[media independence]], environment and [[self-censorship]], legislative framework, transparency, and infrastructure. The questionnaire takes account of the legal framework for the media (including penalties for press offences, the existence of a state monopoly for certain kinds of media and how the media are regulated) and the level of independence of the public media. It also includes violations of the free flow of information on the [[Internet]]. Violence against journalists, netizens, and media assistants, including abuses attributable to the state, armed militias, clandestine organisations or pressure groups, are monitored by RSF staff during the year and are also part of the final score. A smaller score on the report corresponds to greater freedom of the press as reported by the organisation. The questionnaire is sent to Reporters Without Borders's partner organisations: 18 freedom of expression non-governmental organisations located in five continents, its 150 correspondents around the world and journalists, researchers, jurists and human rights activists.&lt;ref name=RWBPFIHow/&gt;

Based on the data collected, a score and a position or rank, complementary indicators that together assess the state of media freedom are assigned to each country in the final report. Some countries are excluded from the report because of a lack of reliable or confirmed information. Because the questions and calculations upon which the scores are based have changed over the years, scores are only used to compare countries within a given year. To follow a country’s evolution from year to year its rank in the index is compared rather than its score.

Each report intends to reflect the situation during a specific period. The year of the report is the year the report was released and intends to reflect events in the prior year.  No report was released in 2011. The 2011–2012 report, labelled 2012 in the table below, was published on 20 January, 2012, and intends to reflect events between 1 December, 2010, and 30 November, 2011. The 2013 World Press Freedom Index was published on 30 January, 2013, and intends to reflect events between 1 December, 2011, and 30 November, 2012.

==Rankings and scores by country==
Data for each year are presented as a country's rank, giving its position relative to other countries over its score. A smaller score on the report corresponds to greater freedom of the press as reported by the organisation. In 2012 the smallest scores could be negative.

Although the map above uses five colours the table below uses seven, and so some countries (e.g. Canada) will be coloured differently.

The '''Priority Development Assistance Fund scam''', also called the '''PDAF scam''' or the '''pork barrel scam''', is a [[political scandal]] involving the alleged misuse by several members of the [[Congress of the Philippines]] of their [[Priority Development Assistance Fund]] (PDAF, popularly called "[[pork barrel]]"), a lump-sum discretionary fund granted to each member of Congress for spending on priority development projects of the Philippine government, mostly on the national level.

The scam was first exposed in the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'' on July 12, 2013,&lt;ref name="expose" /&gt; with the six-part exposé of the ''Inquirer'' on the scam pointing to businesswoman [[Janet Lim-Napoles]] as the scam's mastermind after Benhur K. Luy, her second cousin and former personal assistant, was rescued by agents of the [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)|National Bureau of Investigation]] on March 22, 2013, four months after he was detained by Napoles at her unit at the [[Pacific Plaza Towers]] in [[Fort Bonifacio]].&lt;ref name="abduction" /&gt;  Initially centering on Napoles' involvement in the 2004 [[Fertilizer Fund scam]], the government investigation on Luy's testimony has since expanded to cover Napoles' involvement in a wider scam involving the misuse of PDAF funds from 2003 to 2013.

It is estimated that the Philippine government was defrauded of some [[Philippine peso|₱]]10 billion in the course of the scam,&lt;ref name="expose" /&gt; having been diverted to Napoles, participating members of Congress and other government officials.  Aside from the PDAF and the fertilizer fund maintained by the [[Department of Agriculture (Philippines)|Department of Agriculture]], around ₱900 million in royalties earned from the [[Malampaya gas field]] were also lost to the scam.&lt;ref name="malampaya" /&gt;  The scam has provoked public outrage, with calls being made on the Internet for popular protests to demand the abolition of the PDAF,&lt;ref name="protests" /&gt; and the order for Napoles' arrest sparking serious discussion online.&lt;ref name="socialmedia" /&gt;

{{main|Priority Development Assistance Fund}}
Although the history of pork barrel-like discretionary funds in the Philippines dates back to 1922,&lt;ref name="bworld-pork" /&gt; during the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American colonial period]], the PDAF in its current form was only established during the administration of [[Corazon Aquino]] with the creation of the Countrywide Development Fund (CDF) in 1990.  With ₱2.3 billion in initial funding, the CDF was designed to allow legislators to fund small-scale infrastructure or community projects which fell outside the scope of the national infrastructure program, which was often restricted to large infrastructure items.  The CDF was later renamed the PDAF in 2000, during the administration of [[Joseph Estrada]].&lt;ref name="whitepaper" /&gt;

Since 2008, every member of the House of Representatives usually receives an annual PDAF allocation of ₱70 million, while every senator receives an annual allocation of ₱200 million.&lt;ref name="pcij-pork" /&gt;  The President also benefits from a PDAF-like allocation, the President's Social Fund (PSF), worth around ₱1 billion.&lt;ref name="collegian" /&gt;  Contrary to public belief, however, PDAF allocations are not actually released to members of Congress.  Rather, disbursements under the PDAF are coursed via implementing agencies of the Philippine government, and are limited to "soft" and "hard" projects: the former largely referring to non-infrastructure projects (such as scholarships and financial assistance programs, although small infrastructure projects are also considered "soft" projects), and the latter referring to infrastructure projects which would be coursed via the [[Department of Public Works and Highways (Philippines)|Department of Public Works and Highways]].&lt;ref name="whitepaper" /&gt;

Because [[presidential system]]s are often prone to [[Presidential system#Political gridlock|political gridlock]], the PDAF is often used as a means to generate majority legislative support for the programs of the executive.&lt;ref name="abao" /&gt; Furthermore, because PDAF allocations are released by the [[Department of Budget and Management (Philippines)|Department of Budget and Management]] (DBM), PDAF allocations are often dependent on the relationship a legislator has with the sitting President.&lt;ref name="abao" /&gt; For example, during the latter years of the [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] administration, she was more generous in allocating PDAF funds in the annual national budget in order to win the favor of legislators.&lt;ref name="pcij-pork" /&gt; PDAF allocation has gradually increased over the years.&lt;ref name="abao" /&gt; For example, before Arroyo stepped down, the last PDAF allocated was for the year 2010 at ₱10.86 billion, but when the [[Benigno Aquino III]] administration passed its first budget for 2011, the allocation more than doubled to ₱24.62 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/budget-watch/featured/37226-pork-barrel-arroyo-vs-aquino PDAF more than doubled under Aquino&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The PDAF has proven to be very unpopular, with numerous calls for its abolition.  In 1996, the ''Philippine Daily Inquirer'' published an exposé on systematic corruption in the CDF, with an anonymous congressman (since identified as Romeo D. Candazo of [[Legislative districts of Marikina#Lone District (defunct)|Marikina]]) elaborating how legislators and other government officials earned from overpricing projects in order to receive large commissions.  Public outrage over the misuse of the CDF was instrumental in the enactment of reforms which led to the formation of the PDAF.&lt;ref name="candazo" /&gt;  The constitutionality of the PDAF has also been challenged in the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]].  In 1994, the constitutionality of the CDF was challenged by the Philippine Constitution Association, arguing that the CDF's mechanisms encroach on the executive's power of implementing the budget passed by the legislature, but the Court ruled the CDF constitutional under the legislative's "[[power of the purse]]".&lt;ref name="philconsa" /&gt;  This ruling was reaffirmed in 2001, when the PDAF was challenged again in the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="whitepaper" /&gt;  Legislators themselves are torn on the abolition of the PDAF, with some supporting total abolition, others supporting increased regulation to minimize abuse of PDAF disbursements, and others opposed to it.&lt;ref name="house-pdaf" /&gt;

==Modus operandi==
[[File:PDAF 3.png|thumb|left|A graphic representation of the PDAF scam's ''modus operandi'' produced by the Assembly.]]
The PDAF or pork barrel scam involved the funding of "ghost projects" that were funded using the PDAF funds of participating lawmakers.&lt;ref name="tv5-modus" /&gt;  These projects were in turn "implemented" through Napoles' companies, with the projects producing no tangible output.  According to testimony provided by Benhur Luy's brother, Arthur, funds would be processed through fake foundations and [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) established under the wing of the JLN Group of Companies, the holding company of Janet Lim-Napoles, with Napoles' employees—even a nanny—named as incorporators or directors.&lt;ref name="modus" /&gt;  Each foundation or NGO served as an official recipient of a particular legislator's PDAF funds, and each organization had a number of bank accounts where PDAF funds would be deposited for the implementation of these projects.&lt;ref name="tv5-modus" /&gt;

Napoles, who specialized in trading agricultural products, frequently used the procurement of agricultural inputs in the propagation of the scam.  Either her employees would write to legislators requesting for funds for the implementation of a particular project (e.g. farm inputs), or a legislator would indicate to the DBM a particular recipient agency for his or her PDAF funds that would be pre-selected by Napoles.&lt;ref name="gma-modus" /&gt;  Once received, this is forwarded to the DBM, which would then issue a Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) indicating the amount deducted from the legislator's PDAF allocation, and later a Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) given to the recipient agency.  The NCA would then be deposited in one of the foundation's accounts, and the funds withdrawn in favor of the JLN Group of Companies.&lt;ref name="modus" /&gt;  The funds would then be split between Napoles, the lawmaker, the official of the DA responsible for facilitating the transfer of funds and, for good measure, the local mayor or governor.&lt;ref name="tv5-modus" /&gt;  The JLN Group of Companies offered a commission of 10-15% against funds released to local government units and recipient agencies of PDAF funds, while a legislator would receive a commission of between 40-50% against the total value of his/her PDAF.&lt;ref name="gma-modus" /&gt;

Letters sent by Napoles' employees to participating legislators would also include a letter from a local government unit requesting for funding, bearing the forged signature of the local mayor or governor.  All documents involving local government units were prepared by Napoles' staff, and Benhur Luy would forge the signature of the local mayor or governor.  Local government officials who were used by Napoles were often unaware that they were participating in the scam.&lt;ref name="modus" /&gt;  In other instances, however, Napoles would use emissaries to establish contact with local mayors in exchange for commissions that would come from the implementation of these projects.&lt;ref name="tv5-modus" /&gt;

Every recipient agency participating in the scam had employees or officials that maintained contact with Napoles, allowing for the smooth processing of transactions and the expedient release of PDAF funds to her organizations.  Most importantly, Napoles was in regular contact with the DBM through Undersecretary for Operations Mario L. Relampagos,&lt;ref name="dbm-directory" /&gt; who had three employees (identified as Leah, Malou and Lalaine) responsible for the processing of SAROs destined for Napoles' organizations.&lt;ref name="gma-modus" /&gt;

==Accused parties==
{{see also|List of implicated parties to the Priority Development Assistance Fund scam}}
In the initial report published by the ''Philippine Daily Inquirer'', 28 members of Congress (five senators and 23 representatives) were named as participants in the PDAF scam.  Twelve of these legislators were identified by the newspaper, and close to ₱3 billion in PDAF funds coming from these legislators alone were exposed to the scam.  Notably, the ''Inquirer'' named [[Bong Revilla]], [[Juan Ponce Enrile]], [[Jinggoy Estrada]], [[Bongbong Marcos ]] and [[Gregorio Honasan]] as the five senators who participated in the scam. Revilla was the largest contributor among the 28 legislators, with around ₱1.015 billion of his PDAF funds being transferred to organizations identified with the JLN Group of Companies, although the extent to which legislators participated in the scam varied widely.&lt;ref name="solons" /&gt;

Other legislators identified by the ''Inquirer'' as participating in the scam include [[Legislative districts of La Union|La Union]] Representative Victor Ortega and former Representative Arthur Pingoy.  Early reports had also identified Senator [[Loren Legarda]] as one of the participants in the scam,&lt;ref name="legarda" /&gt; but Luy later denied her participation.&lt;ref name="solons" /&gt;

Legislators identified by the ''Inquirer'' as participants in the PDAF scam—Bong Revilla in particular—have denied their participation in the scam.  All senators except Jinggoy Estrada denied any knowledge of the scheme (Estrada refused to comment), and Marcos denied being acquaintances with Janet Lim-Napoles.&lt;ref name="rappler-2016" /&gt;  Revilla and Marcos have also claimed that the investigation into the scam is politically motivated, saying that [[Malacañang Palace|Malacañang]] is out to discredit potential candidates for the [[Philippine presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]] who are not allied with President Aquino: a charge that the administration denies.&lt;ref name="denial" /&gt;  However, both Revilla and Marcos, as well as Honasan,&lt;ref name="rappler-2016" /&gt; have indicated their willingness to participate in any investigation, saying that they have nothing to hide.&lt;ref name="demolition" /&gt;

On August 16, 2013, the [[Commission on Audit (Philippines)|Commission on Audit]] released the results of a three-year investigation into the use of legislators' PDAF and other discretionary funds during the last three years of the Arroyo administration.  The report not only affirmed the ''Inquirer'' s findings, but also pointed to more legislators being privy to misuse of their PDAF funds.  According to the report, between 2007 and 2009, ₱6.156 billion in PDAF funds coming from 12 senators and 180 representatives were disbursed to fund 772 projects found to be implemented in ways that were "not proper and highly irregular".&lt;ref name="gma-audit" /&gt;  Of the 82 NGOs implementing those projects, ten are linked to Napoles.&lt;ref name="houses" /&gt;  The report also elaborates on "questionable" transactions made using the PDAF: ₱1.054 billion went to NGOs which were either unregistered, used multiple Tax Identification Numbers (TIN), or issued questionable receipts; while ₱1.289 billion in PDAF disbursements spent were not compliant with the Government Procurement Reform Act of 2003.  Lawmakers from across the political spectrum, both past and present, were cited in the report, some of whom (such as [[Edgardo Angara]], [[Ruffy Biazon]], [[Neptali Gonzales II]] and [[Niel Tupas, Jr.]]) are closely related to President Aquino.&lt;ref name="coa-report" /&gt;  Some legislators also donated PDAF funds to NGOs they themselves are affiliated with: these include Angara, [[Victoria Sy-Alvarado]] and [[Matias Defensor, Jr.]].&lt;ref name="ngo-web" /&gt;

Other government officials have been implicated as well in the PDAF scam.  Agriculture Secretary [[Proceso Alcala]], for example, was accused by Merlina Suñas, Luy's fellow whistleblower, of being complicit in the scam, as his department was responsible for transferring at least ₱16 million in PDAF funds to livelihood projects managed by an NGO linked to Napoles.&lt;ref name="alcala" /&gt;  97 mayors were also implicated in the scam in connection with the allocation of Malampaya gas field royalties as reconstruction aid for areas affected by Typhoons [[Typhoon Ketsana|Ondoy]] and [[Typhoon Parma|Pepeng]] which instead went to Napoles, after it was discovered that employees of the JLN Group of Companies forged their signatures to make it appear that they were requesting for aid.&lt;ref name="mayors" /&gt;  44 other mayors were likewise implicated in the scam when Napoles, through fashion designer Eddie Baddeo, reportedly facilitated requests for disbursements from the Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Competitiveness Enhancement Fund (ACEF) on behalf of their municipalities.&lt;ref name="miriam-mayors" /&gt;  A number of mayors have denied involvement in the scam, including three mayors from [[Bataan]],&lt;ref name="bataan" /&gt; seven from [[Ilocos Norte]],&lt;ref name="ilocos" /&gt; one from [[Pangasinan]],&lt;ref name="pangasinan" /&gt; and one from [[Iloilo]].&lt;ref name="iloilo" /&gt;

A second batch of criminal charges was filed by the [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)|National Bureau of Investigation]] on 33 individuals, including Bureau of Customs Commissioner [[Ruffy Biazon]], who is the first political ally and party-mate of President Benigno Aquino III who has been charge in relation to the scam.

Another batch of names were extracted during Janet Lim-Napoles's stay in [[Ospital ng Makati]] for surgical removal of her ovarian cyst. Over 100 Representatives, 2 Cabinet officials and more than 20 current and former Senators are being investigated. Panfilo Lacson claimed he also has another list. The [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] claims it received a hard drive containing all transactions of Napoles, Luy and other JLN Corporation agents from the accused politicians.

==Investigation==
A number of investigations are currently ongoing or will be organized to determine the extent of the PDAF scam.  On July 16, 2013, the [[Ombudsman of the Philippines|Office of the Ombudsman]] announced that it was forming a special six-person panel initially to investigate the projects bankrolled by the 23 legislators originally named in the ''Philippine Daily Inquirer'', in parallel with the NBI investigation against Napoles.&lt;ref name="ombudsman" /&gt;  The next day, President Aquino ordered the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]] to conduct and "extensive and fair probe" of the scam,&lt;ref name="doj-probe" /&gt; which Napoles also asked for on July 27.&lt;ref name="napoles-probe" /&gt;  Despite calls for the investigation to be made open to the public, Justice Secretary [[Leila de Lima]] refused, stating at the time that it was too early for the DOJ investigation to be made public when the NBI was still gathering data on the scam.&lt;ref name="refusal" /&gt;

Members of Congress have also called for parallel investigations in both the Senate and the House of Representatives as to the extent of the scam.  Despite calls by Senator [[Francis Escudero]] to have the scam investigated,&lt;ref name="escudero" /&gt; the Senate initially agreed not to investigate the scam on August 5, instead opting to wait for the results of the investigations being conducted by the DOJ, the Ombudsman, the NBI and the Commission on Audit before launching its own investigation.&lt;ref name="rappler-investigation" /&gt;  However, following the release of the CoA report which implicated more legislators in the scam, the Senate eventually agreed to conduct its own investigation, which would be led by its [[Philippine Senate Blue Ribbon Committee|Blue Ribbon Committee]].&lt;ref name="senate-yes" /&gt;

The House of Representatives, meanwhile, has refused to conduct a probe, with Speaker [[Feliciano Belmonte, Jr.]] claiming that the House investigating its own members would be "messy", instead preferring to wait for the results of the DOJ investigation.&lt;ref name="belmonte-probe" /&gt;  This is despite the clamor from a number of representatives, mostly from the minority bloc not allied with President Aquino, that the House should conduct its own investigation into the matter.&lt;ref name="minority" /&gt;

Following the release of the CoA report, the DOJ is expected to expand its investigation beyond the evidence originally provided by Luy and the other Napoles whistleblowers.  It is also looking at forming either a joint or a parallel investigation with the Ombudsman and the NBI, although its main focus for the time being is on Napoles' involvement in the scam.&lt;ref name="joint-team" /&gt;

Napoles surrendered to President Benigno Aquino III at 9:37 pm on August 28. The president gave the DILG secretary Mar Roxas and PNP director Gen. Alan Purisima custody over Napoles for booking and processing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/476623/napoles-surrenders-to-aquino-sources Napoles surrenders to Aquino | Inquirer News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The NBI and Justice Secretary, Leila De Lima filed the cases of [[plunder]] and malversation of public funds against businesswoman Janet Lim-Napoles, senators Ramon Revilla Jr., Juan Ponce Enrile, Jinggoy Estrada and five former representatives on September 16.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2013/09/16/1217341/plunder-raps-filed-vs-napoles-3-pork-senators Plunder raps filed vs Napoles, 3 'pork' senators |The Philippine Star&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 19, 2013, The Supreme Court declared PDAF as [[unconstitutional]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2013/11/19/1258492/sc-declares-pdaf-unconstitutional SC declares PDAF unconstitutional | The Philippine Star &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
*[[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Luis Antonio Tagle]], [[Archbishop of Manila]] – during a press conference at the [[University of Santo Tomas]], Cardinal Tagle described the scandal as part of an "intricate web of corruption", and said that it is right that the issue be investigated. He added that those involved in the scam have "lost touch with the poor" and should visit a community of [[Squatter|informal settlers]] to understand the issues poor Filipinos face on a daily basis. "We have heard many other big scandals in the past but these were buried and forgotten when a new issue came up", the cardinal added.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/465001/pork-scam-moves-tagle-to-tears Pork scam moves Tagle to tears | Inquirer News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Renato Reyes Jr., Secretary-General of [[BAYAN]] coalition – Reyes described the scandal as a "bigger test for the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]]". He also said that the coalition remains doubtful if those involve in the alleged scam will be held liable, including those perceived to be allied with the Aquino administration. Reyes also accused the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] and [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] for covering up the scam and refusing to open an investigation. BAYAN also re-iterated its call for the complete abolition of the PDAF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2013/08/15/1093821/bayan-doubts-doj-probe-pork-barrel-scam Bayan doubts DOJ probe on pork barrel scam |The Philippine Star&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Race (human categorization)|Race]] and [[ethnicity]] in [[Colombia]]''' descends mainly from three racial groups—[[Indigenous peoples in Colombia|Amerindians]], [[Afro-Colombian|Africans]], and [[White Colombian|
Caucasians]]—that have mingled throughout the last 500 years of the country's history. Some demographers describe Colombia as one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the Western Hemisphere and in the World, with 85 different ethnic groups. Most Colombians identify themselves and others according to ancestry, physical appearance, and sociocultural status. Social relations reflect the importance attached to certain characteristics associated with a given racial group. Although these characteristics no longer accurately differentiate social categories, they still contribute to one's rank in the social hierarchy.&lt;ref name=bh86&gt;Bushnell &amp; Hudson, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic research with over 60,000 blood tests and 25 variables, determined that the average Colombian (of all races) has  an admixture of 70% European, 20% native Amerindian and 10% African ancestry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-13474795|title=Los  colombianos tienen un componente europeo mayor que el pensado|first=Casa Editorial El|last=Tiempo|website=El Tiempo|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz-Linares, Andrés, et al. "Admixture in Latin America: geographic structure, phenotypic diversity and self-perception of ancestry based on 7,342 individuals." PLoS Genetics 10.9 (2014): e1004572.&lt;/ref&gt; however these proportions vary widely from one region to another. These proportions also vary widely among ethnicities.

Colombia officially acknowledges three ethnic minority groups: the Afro-Colombian, indigenous, and [[Romani people|Romani]] populations. The Afro-Colombian population consists mainly of blacks, [[mulattoes]], [[raizal]]es, palenqueros, and [[zambos]] (a term used since colonial times for individuals of mixed Amerindian and black ancestry). A 1999 resolution of the [[Ministry of the Interior and Justice (Colombia)|Ministry of the Interior and Justice]] acknowledged the Romani population as a Colombian ethnic group, although Romani people were not recognized in the [[Colombian Constitution of 1991|1991 constitution]] (unlike the Afro-Colombian and indigenous populations). Estimates vary widely, but the 2005 census found that the ethnic minority populations had increased significantly since the 1993 census, possibly owing to the methodology used. Specifically, it reported that the Afro-Colombian population accounted for 10.5 percent of the national population (4.3 million people); the Amerindian population, for 3.4 percent (1.4 million people); and the Romani population, for 0.01 percent (5,000 people).&lt;ref name=bh86/&gt;

The 2005 census reported that the "non-ethnic population", consisting of [[White Colombian|whites]], [[Mestizo Colombians|mestizos]] and [[castizos]], constituted 86 percent of the national population. The 86 percent figure is subdivided into 49 percent mestizo and 37 percent white.&lt;ref&gt;Bushnell &amp; Hudson, p. 86-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

A minute percentage of the insular population originated in [[Scotland]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref name=bh88&gt;Bushnell &amp; Hudson, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution of racial/ethnic groups geographically==
The various groups exist in differing concentrations throughout the nation, in a pattern that to some extent goes back to colonial origins. The [[White Colombian|Whites]] tend to live mainly in the urban centers, particularly like [[Bogotá]] or [[Medellín]], and the burgeoning highland cities. The populations of the major cities are primarily white and mestizo. The large [[Mestizo Colombian|Mestizo]] population includes most ''campesinos'' (people living in rural areas) of the Andean highlands where some Spanish conquerors had mixed with the women of Amerindian [[chiefdoms]]. Mestizos had always lived in the cities as well, as artisans and small tradesmen, and they have played a major part in the urban expansion of recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;Bushnell &amp; Hudson, pp. 87-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2005 census, the heaviest concentration of the indigenous population (22 to 61 percent) is located in the departments of [[Amazonas Department|Amazonas]], [[La Guajira Department|La Guajira]], [[Guainía Department|Guainía]], [[Vaupés Department|Vaupés]], and [[Vichada Department|Vichada]]. The secondary concentrations of 6 to 21 percent are located in the departments of [[Sucre Department|Sucre]], [[Córdoba Department|Córdoba]], [[Chocó Department|Chocó]], [[Cauca Department|Cauca]], [[Nariño Department|Nariño]], and [[Putumayo Department|Putumayo]]. Amerindian communities have legal autonomy to enforce their own traditional laws and customs. Despite its small percentage of the national population, the indigenous population has managed to obtain nearly a quarter of the country's land titles under the 1991 constitution.&lt;ref name="bh88"/&gt;

The 1991 National Constitution of Colombia defined Territorial Entities (''Entidades Territoriales'') as departments, districts, municipalities and indigenous territories.
Within an [[Indigenous territory (Colombia)|Indigenous Territory Entity]] (ETI) the people have autonomy in managing their interests, and within the limits of the constitution have the right to manage resources and define taxes required to perform their duties. ETIs are to be defined by the government in conformance with the Organic Law on Land Management.
However, this law has yet to be sanctioned so in practice the territories are unregulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|ref={{harvid|Entidades Territoriales Indigenas – TIG}}|language=Spanish |title=Entidades Territoriales Indigenas|work=TIG: Territorio Indigena y Gobernanza |url=http://www.territorioindigenaygobernanza.com/col_06.html|accessdate=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black, Zambo and Mulatto populations have largely remained in the lowland areas on the [[Caribbean Region of Colombia|Caribbean]] and [[Pacific Region of Colombia|Pacific]] coasts, its [[Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina|islands]], and along the [[Cauca River|Cauca]] and [[Magdalena River]]s. The Afro-Colombian population is concentrated primarily (21% to 80% of their departments) in the departments of Chocó, [[San Andrés (island)|San Andrés]], [[Bolívar Department|department of Bolívar]] and in the lowland parts of Cauca (communities such as Lopez de Micay, Guapi, and Timbiqui), and [[Valle del Cauca department]]s (in areas like the largest city on the Pacific coast Buenaventura and large concentration in Cali), with secondary concentrations (10 to 18 percent of the departments) in [[Atlántico Department|Atlántico]], Córdoba, [[Magdalena Department|Magdalena]], Nariño (communities like El Charco, Tumaco and Barbacoas), Antioquia (mostly in La Uraba region), La Guajira, Cesar, and Sucre departments. Chocó is the department with the largest concentration of African-descendants in Colombia. &lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.mincultura.gov.co/areas/poblaciones/comunidades-negras-afrocolombianas-raizales-y-palenqueras/Documents/Caracterizaci%C3%B3n%20comunidades%20negras%20y%20afrocolombianas.pdf |title= Afrocolombianos, población con huellas de africanía|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; | language=Spanish | date= | website= Comunidades Negras, Afrocolombianas, Raizales y Palenqueras |publisher= Mincultura Gobierno de Colombia |access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of the [[Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina]], which Colombia inherited from Spain after the Spanish had overcome an initial British settlement, is mostly Afro-Colombian, including several thousand ''[[raizal]]'' (those with roots) blacks. Despite the length of time during which Colombia has had jurisdiction over them, most ''raizales'' on these Caribbean islands have retained their [[Protestant]] religion, have continued to speak an [[English-based creole languages|English-based]] [[creole language]] as well as English, and have regarded themselves as a group distinct from mainland residents. A minute percentage of the insular population originated in [[Scotland]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref name=bh88&gt;Bushnell &amp; Hudson, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social status of racial/ethnic minorities==
Since independence both Amerindians and blacks have continued to reside on the outskirts of national life. As a group, however, blacks have become more integrated into the national society and have left a greater mark on it for several reasons. Amerindians were new to Spanish|British social structures. The Spanish and the British had long possessed Africans as slaves and did not find them as alien as the Amerindians they encountered in the New World. Moreover, it was more difficult for the blacks to maintain their original culture because, unlike the indigenous people, they could not remain within their own communities and did not initially have the option of retreating into isolated areas. Moreover, the blacks came from different areas of [[Africa]], often did not share the same language or culture, and were not grouped into organized social units on arrival in the [[New World]]. Despite slave revolts, no large community of escaped slaves survived in isolation to preserve its African heritage, as did the [[Jamaican Maroons|maroons in Jamaica]],&lt;ref&gt;Bushnell &amp; Hudson, pp. 88-89.&lt;/ref&gt; except for the village of Palenque de San Basilio, located southeast of Cartagena, which was one of the walled communities called 'palenques', founded by escaped slaves as a refuge in the seventeenth century. Of the many palenques that existed in former times, only the one of San Basilio has survived until the present day and developed into a unique cultural space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/intangible-heritage/11lac_uk.htm|title=The Cultural Space of Palenque de San Basilio|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Afro Colombianos by Maria Claudia.jpg|thumb|Afro-Colombian people at an amphitheater in [[Cali]]. Nearly a quarter of Cali's population is Afro-Colombian.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.foro.org.co/docum/documentos/forodebates5.pdf "Foro debates no. 5: Pobreza y exclusión social en Bogotá, Medellín y Cali"] (PDF). Fundación Foro Nacional por Colombia (October 2006), p. 87. Accessed April 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Finally, despite their position on the bottom rung of the social ladder, black slaves often had close relations—as domestic servants—with Spaniards and British and were therefore exposed to Spanish|British culture much more than were the Amerindians. Thus, blacks became a part—albeit a peripheral one—of Colombian society from the beginning, adopting the ways of the Spanish|British that were permitted them and learning their language. By the end of the colonial period, the blacks thought of themselves as Colombians and felt superior to the Amerindians, who officially occupied higher status, were nominally free, and were closer in skin color, facial features, and hair texture to the emerging mestizo mix.&lt;ref name=bh89&gt;Bushnell &amp; Hudson, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many blacks left slave status early in Colombian history, becoming part of the free population. Their owners awarded freedom to some, others purchased their liberty, but probably the greatest number achieved freedom by escape. Many slaves were liberated as a result of revolts, particularly in the Cauca valley and along the Caribbean coast. The elimination of slavery began with a [[Freedom of wombs|free-birth law]] in 1821, but total emancipation was enacted only in 1851, becoming effective on January 1, 1852.&lt;ref name=bh89/&gt;

Those blacks who achieved freedom sometimes moved into Amerindian communities, but blacks and zambos remained at the bottom of the social scale and were important only as a source of labor. Others founded their own settlements, mainly in unsettled lands of the Pacific basin where they were called ''[[Maroon (people)|cimarrones]]'' (maroons). Those regions were very unhealthy, inhospitable, and dangerous. A number of towns, such as [[San Basilio de Palenque]] in the present department of Bolívar, and [[San José de Uré]] in southern Córdoba, kept the history of revolt alive in their [[oral history|oral traditions]]. In the Chocó area, along the Pacific, many of the black communities remained relatively unmixed, probably because there were few whites in the area, and the Amerindians became increasingly resistant to assimilation.&lt;ref name=bh89/&gt;

In other regions, such as [[Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina|San Andrés y Providencia]], or the [[Magdalena valley]], black communities had considerable white and/or Amerindian [[Miscegenation|admixture]]. Descendants of slaves have preserved relatively little of their African heritage or identification. Some placenames are derived from African languages, and some traditional musical instruments brought into the country by slaves are used throughout the country. Religion in the black communities remains the most durable link with the African past. Wholly black communities have been disappearing, not only because their residents have been moving to the cities but also because the surrounding mestizo and white populations have been moving into black communities. Eventual absorption into the mixed milieu appears inevitable. Moreover, as blacks have moved into the mainstream of society from its peripheries, they have perceived the advantages of better education and jobs. Rather than forming organizations to promote their advancement as a group, blacks have for the most part concentrated on achieving mobility through individual effort and adaptation to the prevailing system.&lt;ref name=bh90&gt;Bushnell &amp; Hudson, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Afro-Colombians are entitled to all constitutional rights and protections, but they continue to face significant economic and social discrimination. According to the 2005 census, an estimated 74 percent of Afro-Colombians earned less than the [[minimum wage]]. Chocó, the department with the highest percentage of Afro-Colombian residents, had the lowest level of social investment per capita and ranked last in terms of education, health, and infrastructure. It also continued to experience some of the country's worst political violence, as [[paramilitaries]] and [[guerrillas]] struggled for control of the department's key drug- and weapons-smuggling corridors.&lt;ref name=bh90/&gt;

==Immigrants in Colombia==
Colombia has received across its history different groups of immigrants.

[[White Colombian]]s are mainly of [[Spanish Colombian|Spanish]] descent, who arrived in the beginning of the 16th century when Colombia was part of the [[Spanish Empire]]. During the 19th and 20th centuries, other European and [[Arab Colombians|Middle Eastern]] peoples migrated to Colombia, notably [[Lebanese Colombians|Lebanese people]] but also Palestinians, [[Syrian Colombian|Syrians]], [[German Colombian|Germans]], [[Italian Colombian|Italians]], [[French Colombian|French]], Lithuanians, and British among others.

Colombia was one of early focus of [[Basque Colombians|Basque]] and [[Sephardi]] immigration.&lt;ref name = "jews"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.npr.org/2012/12/20/167714541/lost-jews-of-colombia-say-theyve-found-their-roots|title= 'Lost Jews' Of Colombia Say They've Found Their Roots|publisher= npr.org|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1540 and 1559, 8.9% of the residents of Colombia were of Basque origin. Basque priests introduced handball into Colombia.&lt;ref name=Pastor&gt;Possible paradises: Basque emigration to Latin America by José Manuel Azcona Pastor, P.203&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish converts to Christianity and some crypto-Jews also sailed with the early conquistadors.&lt;ref name = "Migraciones Internacionales"/&gt;

Many immigrant communities have settled on the Caribbean coast, in particular recent immigrants from the [[Ethnic groups in West Asia|Middle East]]. [[Barranquilla]] (the largest city of the Colombian Caribbean) and other Caribbean cities have the largest populations of [[Lebanese Colombian|Lebanese]], [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]], and other [[Arab Colombians|Arabs]].&lt;ref name = "arab colombians"&gt;Vargas Arana, Pilar, and Luz Marina Suaza Vargas. "Los árabes en Colombia: Del rechazo a la integración."

There are also important communities of [[Chinese Colombians|Chinese]], [[Japanese Colombian|Japanese]], [[Romani Colombians|Romanis]] and [[History of the Jews in Colombia|Jews]].&lt;ref name = "Colombia is ethnically diverse"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pedagogica.edu.co/storage/ps/articulos/pedysab15_09arti.pdf |title= The ethnic and cultural diversity of Colombia |publisher= pedagogica.edu.co |language = Spanish|accessdate= 26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[British people|British]] and [[Jamaicans]] migrated mainly to the islands of San Andres and Providencia.&lt;ref name = "Migraciones Internacionales"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://rcientificas.uninorte.edu.co/index.php/investigacion/article/view/2116/2827 |title= Las migraciones internacionales en Colombia.

Since 2010 there is a major migration trend of [[Venezuelans]], due to the political and economic situation in Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/c80f3a_d2e0a0b4821e4238ae021904026a4459.pdf |title=Características de los migrantes de Venezuela a Colombia |date=2017-08-14 |website=labourosario.com|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Reich Labour Service''' (''Reichsarbeitsdienst''; RAD) was a major organisation established in [[Nazi Germany]] as an agency to help mitigate the effects of [[unemployment]] on the [[Economy of Nazi Germany|German economy]], militarise the workforce and indoctrinate it with [[Nazism|Nazi]] ideology. It was the official state labour service, divided into separate sections for men and women.

From June 1935 onward, men aged between 18 and 25 may have served six months before their military service. During [[World War II]] compulsory service also included young women and the RAD developed to an [[Auxiliaries|auxiliary]] [[Military organization#Formation|formation]] which provided support for the [[Wehrmacht]] armed forces.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1987-085-19, Ostpreußen, RAD-Erntehelfer.jpg|thumb|RAD members working in the field, East Prussia, 1938]]

==Foundation==
In the course of the [[Great Depression]], the German government of the [[Weimar Republic]] under Chancellor [[Heinrich Brüning]] by [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|emergency decree]] had established the ''Freiwilliger Arbeitsdienst'' ('Voluntary Labour Service', FAD) on 5 June 1931, two years before the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) ascended to national power. The state sponsored employment organisation provided services to civic and [[land improvement]] projects, from 16 July 1932 it was headed by [[Friedrich Syrup]] in the official rank of a ''[[Reichskommissar]]''. The idea of a national compulsory service was quite popular, especially in right-wing circles{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}, but it had little effect on the economic situation.

The concept was adopted by [[Adolf Hitler]], who upon the [[Nazi seizure of power]] in 1933 appointed [[Konstantin Hierl]] state secretary in the Reich Ministry of Labour, responsible for FAD matters. Hierl was already a high-ranking member of the NSDAP and head of the party's labour organisation, the ''Nationalsozialistischer Arbeitsdienst'' or NSAD. Hierl developed the concept of a state labour service organisation similar to the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' army, with a view to implementing a compulsory service. Meant as an evasion of the regulations set by the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]], voluntariness initially was maintained after protests by the Geneva [[World Disarmament Conference]].

Hierl's rivalry with Labour Minister [[Franz Seldte]] led to the affiliation of his office as a FAD ''Reichskommissar'' with the Interior Ministry under his party fellow [[Wilhelm Frick]]. On 11 July 1934, the NSAD was renamed ''Reichsarbeitsdienst'' or RAD with Hierl as its director until the end of World War II. By law issued on 26 June 1935, the RAD was re-established as an amalgamation of the many prior labour organisations formed in Germany during the Weimar Republic,&lt;ref&gt;Hartmut Heyck, [http://jch.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/38/2/221 "Labour Services in the Weimar Republic and their Ideological Godparents"], ''[[Journal of Contemporary History]]'', 2003; 38: 221-236&lt;/ref&gt; with Hierl appointed as Reich Labour Leader (''Reichsarbeitsführer'') according to the ''[[Führerprinzip]]''. With massive financial support by the German government, RAD members were to provide service for mainly military and to a lesser extent civic and agricultural construction projects. Per Reich Labor Service Act of June 26, 1935&lt;ref&gt;http://www.documentarchiv.de/ns/1935/rad_ges.html&lt;/ref&gt; "(1) The Reich Labor Service is an honorary service to the German people.(2) All young Germans of both sexes are obliged to serve their people in the Reich Labor Service.(3) The Reich Labor Service is to educate the German youth in the spirit of National Socialism to the national community and to the true working attitude, above all to the due respect of manual labor.(4) The Reich Labor Service is intended for the performance of charitable work.[. . .]

==Organisation==
[[File:RAD Weibliche Jugend.svg|thumb|RAD flag, Female Section]]
The RAD was divided into two major sections, one for men (''Reichsarbeitsdienst Männer - RAD/M'') and the voluntary, from 1939 compulsory, section for young women (''Reichsarbeitsdienst der weiblichen Jugend - RAD/wJ'').

The RAD was composed of 33 districts each called an ''Arbeitsgau'' (lit. Work District) similar to the ''[[Administrative divisions of Nazi Germany|Gaue]]'' subdivisions of the Nazi Party. Each of these districts was headed by an ''Arbeitsgauführer'' officer with headquarters staff and a ''Wachkompanie'' (Guard Company). Under each district were between six and eight ''Arbeitsgruppen'' (Work Groups), battalion-sized formations of 1200–1800 men. These groups were divided into six [[company (military unit)|company]]-sized RAD-Abteilung units.

Conscripted personnel had to move into labour barracks. Each rank and file RAD man was supplied with a spade and a [[Military bicycle|bicycle]]. A paramilitary uniform was implemented in 1934; beside the [[swastika]] brassard, the RAD symbol, an arm badge in the shape of an upward pointing shovel blade, was displayed on the upper left shoulder of all uniforms and great-coats worn by all personnel. Men and women had to work up to 76 hours a week.

==War==
{{see also|Bicycle infantry#World Wars}}
The RAD was classed as ''Wehrmachtgefolge'' (lit. Defence Force Following). Auxiliary forces with this status, while not a part of the Armed Forces themselves, provided such vital support that they were given protection by the [[Geneva Convention]]. Some, including the RAD, were militarised.

Just prior to the outbreak of World War II, nearly all the RAD/M's extant RAD-Abteilung units were either incorporated into the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'s ''Bautruppen'' (Construction troops) as an expedient to rapidly increase their numbers or else in a few cases transferred to the [[Luftwaffe]] to form the basis of [[Luftwaffe construction units|new wartime construction units]] for that service. New units were quickly formed to replace them. 

During the early war Norwegian and Western campaigns, hundreds of RAD units were engaged in supplying frontline troops with food and ammunition, repairing damaged roads and constructing and repairing airstrips. Throughout the course of the war, the RAD were involved in many projects.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=55}} The RAD units constructed coastal fortifications (many RAD men worked on the [[Atlantic Wall]]), laid minefields, manned fortifications, and even helped guard vital locations and prisoners.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H28335, RAD-Flak, Ausheben eines Schützengrabens.jpg|thumb|RAD members digging a trench for a RAD [[flak]] battery in March 1945]]

The role of the RAD was not limited to combat support functions. Hundreds of RAD units received training as anti-aircraft units and were deployed as RAD [[Flak]] Batteries.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=55}} Several RAD units also performed combat on the eastern front as infantry. As the German defences were devastated, more and more RAD men were committed to combat. During the final months of the war RAD men formed 6 major frontline units, which were involved with serious fighting. On the western front RAD troops were used as reinforcements to the 9th SS Engineer Abt (SS-Captain Moeller) in the fighting to retake the northern end of the Arnhem bridge from British Paratroopers under Col. Frost. This action was during [[Operation Market-Garden]] in September 1944. It was noted that the RAD troops had no combat experience. SS-Captain Moeller's report concluded: "These men were rather skeptical and reluctant at the beginning, which was hardly surprising. But when they were put in the right place they helped us a lot; and in time they integrated completely, becoming good and reliable comrades." Losses for these troops were in the hundreds.&lt;ref&gt;Moeller 'Die Schlacht um Arnheim-Oosterbeek. Der Einsatz des Pionier Battalion 9 Hohenstaufen vom 17. bis 26. September 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Relationship education''' promotes practices and principles of premarital education, [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] resources, relationship restoration, relationship maintenance, and evidence-based marriage education.

==History==
The formal organization of relationship education in the [[United States]] began in the late 1970s by a diverse group of professionals concerned that the results of conventional methods and means of [[marriage therapy]] resulted in no appreciable reduction in the elevated rate of [[divorce]] and [[out-of-wedlock birth]]s. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The motivation for relationship education was found in numerous studied observations of the elevated rates of marital and family breakdown, school [[dropping out|drop-out]]s, [[incarceration]], [[drug addiction]], [[unemployment]], [[suicide]], [[homicide]], [[domestic abuse]] and other negative social factors when divorce and/or out-of-wedlock pregnancy were noted. In all of the negative categories noted above, statistical over-representation of adults whose childhood did not involve both of their parents was present.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Initial planning for the field of relationship education involved the participation of [[psychologists]], [[Mental Health Counselor|counselor]]s, [[family life educators]], [[social workers]], [[marriage and family therapists]], [[psychiatrists]], [[clergy]] from various faith traditions, policy makers, academicians in the fields of [[social science]], attorneys, judges, and lay persons.  The goal was to seek the broadest possible dispersal of research and marriage education skills courses which could improve interpersonal relationship functioning, especially with married and pre-marital couples.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Early contributors to the field of relationship education included David and Vera Mace, who founded The Association for Couples in Marriage Enrichment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2008.bettermarriages.org/Home/tabid/36/Default.aspx] Building Better Marriages: The Association for Couples in Marriage Enrichment&lt;/ref&gt; The Maces conducted their first couples retreat in 1962. Bernard and Louise Guerney launched the "Institute for the Development of Emotional and Life Skills," later known as "Relationship Enhancement," in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nire.org/] National Institute of Relationship Enhancement website.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Lori Heyman Gordon developed a semester-long, 120-hour relationship education course for American University graduate students, which she called "PAIRS," an acronym for the "Practical Application of Intimate Relationship Skills."&lt;ref&gt;DeMaria, Rita. ''Building Intimate Relationships'', "The Saga of PAIRS." Routledge, December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virginia Satir]], considered the "Mother of Family Therapy," began training therapists as relationship educators in 1984.&lt;ref name="satir" /&gt;

Two large scientific studies published in 2011 provided evidence that marriage and relationship education helps reduce divorce among military and distressed couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2011/07/13/marriage-education-and-relationship-skills-classes-gaining-traction-713] "Marriage Education and Relationship Skills Classes Gaining Traction," Fatherhood Channel, July 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Another showed evidence of significant gains for singles, couples and as a potential strategy to reduce rates of teen pregnancy.&lt;ref name="peluso"&gt;Peluso, Paul; Eisenberg Seth; Schindler, Rachel. "Marriage Education Impact Report," [[PAIRS Foundation]] for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, September 2011.[http://evaluation.pairs.com/reports/impact2011.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies, notably the [[Building Strong Families Program]], have shown that relationship education does not "improve relationship quality/satisfaction" for low-income, unwed couples, while another&lt;ref name="hawkins" /&gt; provided evidence of statistically significant benefits for low-income married couples.&lt;ref name="impact" /&gt;

==Rationale==

In 1984, [[Virginia Satir|Satir]] encouraged marriage and family therapists to shift their focus to relationship education:

{{Quotation|"We’re at a crossroads, an important crossroads of how we view people. That’s why it’s possible now for all the different kind of therapies to go into education, education for being more fully human, using what we know as a pathology is only something that tells us that something is wrong and then allows us to move towards how we can we use this to develop round people. I’m fortunate in being one of the people who pushed my way through to know that people are really round. That’s what it means to me to look at people as people who have potential that can be realized, as people who can have dreams and have their dreams work out. What people bring to me in the guise of problems are their ways of living that keep them hampered and pathologically oriented. What we’re doing now is seeing how education allows us to move toward more joy, more reality, more connectedness, more accomplishment and more opportunities for people to grow."&lt;ref name="satir"&gt;Eisenberg, Seth. "Revolutions of a Lifetime at Home and Abroad," Fatherhood Channel, February 21, 2011.[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2011/02/21/revolutions-of-a-lifetime-at-home-and-abroad-084/]&lt;/ref&gt;|Virginia Satir}}

===Impact of women's liberation===

Satir said the need for relationship education emerged from shifting gender roles as [[Feminist movement|women gained greater rights and freedoms]] during the 20th century:

{{Quotation|"As we moved into the 20th century, we arrived with a very clearly prescribed way that males and females in marriage were to behave with one another ... The pattern of the relationship between husband and wife was that of the dominant male and submissive female ... A new era has since dawned ... the climate of relationships had changed, and women were no longer willing to be submissive ... The end of the dominant/submissive model in relationships was in sight. However, there was very little that had developed to replace the old pattern; couples floundered ... Retrospectively, one could have expected that there would be a lot of chaos and a lot of fall-out. The change from the dominant/submissive model to one of equality is a monumental shift. We are learning how a relationship based on genuine feelings of equality can operate practically."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Satir | first = Virginia | author-link = Virginia Satir | contribution = Introduction to for our future, for our family | editor-last = PAIRS Foundation | editor-link = PAIRS Foundation | title = For our future, for our family: participant handbook | url = http://www.pairsusa.com/p-42-for-our-future-for-our-family-participant-handbook.aspx | location = Broward County, Florida | page = 6 | publisher = [[PAIRS Foundation]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305044746/http://www.pairsusa.com/p-42-for-our-future-for-our-family-participant-handbook.aspx | archivedate = 2016-03-05 | df =  }} (Participant handbook for PAIRS 30-hour curriculum for Supporting Healthy Marriages.)

==Examples==

The National Council on Family Relations&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncfr.org] - National Council on Family Relations website.&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on preparing professionals in [[family life education]], a prominent approach to relationship education.

In 2006, the U.S. [[Department of Health and Human Services]] began funding significant multi-year demonstration projects through the [[Administration for Children and Families]] to expand the availability of marriage education classes in more than 100 communities nationwide. This project, known as the "[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/healthymarriage/ Healthy Marriage Initiative]," was designed to improve the well-being of children by providing tools and education to strengthen marriages and families.

[[Jeffry H. Larson]] conducted several studies on marriage and relationship education, including a review of three widely used premarital inventories - Focus, Prepare, and Relate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-115465399.html] Larson, Jeffrey. "A review of three comprehensive premarital assessment questionnaires," Journal of Marital and Family Therapy, April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==

===Relationship education for premarital couples===

A multi-year federal study, known as the [[Building Strong Families Program]], and 2010 meta-analysis&lt;ref name="hawkins" /&gt; of 47 studies found that relationship education "does not improve relationship quality/satisfaction" for unmarried couples.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Previous studies have asserted that premarital education programs have a positive effect on program participants. Using meta-analytic methods of current best practices to look across the entire body of published and unpublished evaluation research on premarital education, we found a more complex pattern of results. We coded 47 studies and found that premarital education programs do not improve relationship quality/satisfaction when unpublished studies are included in the analysis, although studies that follow couples past the honeymoon stage to detect prevention effects are rare. In contrast, premarital education programs appear to be effective at improving couple communication, with studies that employed observational measures rather than self-report measures producing large effects. Still, given the mixed, modest results, there is ample room and a real need to improve the practice of premarital education."&lt;ref name="hawkins"&gt;Hawkins, Alan J.; Fawcett Elizabeth B.; Blanchard, Victoria L.; Carroll, Jason. "Do Premarital Education Programs Really Work? A Meta-analytic Study," Volume 59, Issue 3, pages 232–239, July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Building Strong Families Program====

Between 2002 and 2011, Mathematica Policy Research conducted the [[Building Strong Families Program]] study for the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], [[Administration for Children and Families]], "to learn whether well-designed interventions can help couples fulfill their aspirations for a healthy relationship, marriage, and a strong family."&lt;ref name="opre"/&gt;

The study specifically evaluated the impact of relationship education classes delivered to more than 5,000 low-income, unwed couples at 12 locations in seven states. "The intervention featured up to 42 hours of multi-couple group sessions led by trained facilitators, focusing on skills that, according to earlier research, are associated with relationship and marital stability and satisfaction."&lt;ref name=opre&gt;[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/opre/resource/the-building-strong-families-project-implementation-of-eight-programs-to] U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Mathematica reported findings from a 15-month follow-up of program and control group participants:

* BSF had no effect on whether couples were still together 15 months after they had applied for the program, when data from the eight BSF programs are combined. At this point, 76 percent of BSF couples were still romantically involved, compared with 77 percent of control group couples. Similarly, BSF and control group couples were equally likely to be married to each other at that time (17 and 18 percent respectively) and to be living together, whether married or unmarried (62 percent for both research groups)."&lt;ref name=impact&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/PDFs/Family_Support/BSF_impact_finalrpt.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720101532/http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/pdfs/family_support/BSF_impact_finalrpt.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-20 |df= }} Administration for Children and Families, Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation, Wood, Robert G., et al., "The Building Strong Families Project," May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fifteen months after they applied for the program, BSF and control group couples reported being equally happy in their romantic relationships, with average ratings of 8.4 and 8.3 respectively on a 0-to-10 relationship happiness scale. Similarly, BSF and control group couples gave very similar ratings of supportiveness and affection in their relationships, with average support and affection scale values of 3.5 on a 1-to-4 scale for couples in both research groups. In addition, BSF had no overall effect on how faithful couples were to each other.&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt;
* When results are averaged across all eight programs, BSF did not improve couples’ ability to manage their conflict. Couples in both research groups reported similar levels of use of constructive conflict behaviors, such as keeping a sense of humor and listening to the other partner’s perspective during disagreements. Similarly, there was no difference between the research groups in the avoidance of destructive conflict behaviors, such as withdrawing when there is a disagreement or allowing small disagreements to escalate. In addition, when results are averaged across all programs, BSF had no effect on how likely couples were to experience [[intimate partner violence]].  Similarly, when results are averaged across all programs, BSF did not improve co-parenting or increase father involvement. BSF and control group couples reported that their co-parenting relationships were of equally high quality. In addition, at the 15-month follow-up, couples in both research groups were equally likely to report that fathers were living with their children, spending substantial time with them, and providing them with substantial financial support.&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt;
*The Baltimore BSF program [Loving Couples, Loving Children] had negative effects on couples’ relationships. BSF couples were less likely than control group couples to remain romantically involved, 59 percent versus 70 percent. Baltimore BSF couples reported being less supportive and affectionate toward each other than control group couples did. In addition, women in the Baltimore BSF program were more likely than women in the control group to report having been severely physically assaulted by a romantic partner in the past year, 15 percent compared with 9 percent. Baltimore BSF couples also rated the quality of their co-parenting relationship lower than control group couples did and reported that BSF fathers spent less time with their children and were less likely to provide them financial support than control group fathers were.&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt;

===Relationship education for married couples===

Several studies, notably the [[Supporting Healthy Marriage Project]] funded by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], [[Administration for Children and Families]], a meta-analysis by Hawkins and Ooms&lt;ref name="works" /&gt; and a five-year impact report by Peluso, Eisenberg and Schindler&lt;ref name="peluso" /&gt; found that relationship education provided statistically significant benefits for married couples.&lt;ref name="impact" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The emerging evidence suggests that MRE [marriage and relationship education] programs can work for low-income populations as well as for those who are economically better off. The evidence from a new meta-analysis of 15 program evaluations (including three randomized control trials) shows that MRE programs can have positive, moderate size effects on low-income couples’ relationship outcomes, at least in the short run. However, the largest and most rigorous study of low-income, unmarried couples produced mixed results and shows there is still much to learn ... Across nearly all the studies reviewed for this Report, MRE improves communication—a core, essential relationship skill—as well as other measures of relationship quality. There is also some initial evidence that MRE for low-income couples can decrease divorce rates, reduce aggression, and improve children’s problem behaviors.&lt;ref name="works"&gt;Hawkins, Alan; Ooms, Theodora. "What Works in Marriage and Relationship Education," National Healthy Marriage Resource Center, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Washington, D.C.[http://www.healthymarriageinfo.org/resource-detail/index.aspx?rid=2861]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Supporting Healthy Marriage Study====

In August 2012, Manpower Development Research Corporation (MDRC),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdrc.org] MDRC website&lt;/ref&gt; a nonprofit, nonpartisan social policy research organization, reported that a federally funded, multi-year, random assignment, control group study known as the [[Supporting Healthy Marriage Project]] found high levels of consumer satisfaction among 4,989 adults participating in relationship education courses based on the work of PREP Inc., [[PAIRS Foundation]] and [[John Gottman]] at sites in Florida (Orlando), Kansas (Wichita), Pennsylvania (Reading and Bethlehem), Texas (El Paso and San Antonio), New York (Bronx), Oklahoma (Oklahoma City), and Washington (Shoreline and Seattle).&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2012/10/17/national-marriage-education-study-117] "National Study Shows Strong Consumer Satisfaction with Marriage and Relationship Education Classes," Fatherhood Channel, October 17, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A 12-month report on the program's impact found:&lt;ref name=knox&gt;Knox, Virginia, et al. "Early Impacts from the Supporting Healthy Marriage Evaluation," MDRC, New York, NY, March 2012.[http://www.mdrc.org/early-impacts-supporting-healthy-marriage-evaluation]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SHM PAIRS Couple.jpg|thumb|Couple practices communication skills during [[PAIRS Foundation]] relationship education class in Florida.]]

* The SHM program produced a consistent pattern of small positive effects on multiple aspects of couples’ relationships. Relative to the control group, the program group showed higher levels of marital happiness, lower levels of marital distress, greater warmth and support, more positive communication, and fewer negative behaviors and emotions in their interactions with their spouses. The consistency of results across outcomes and data sources (surveys and independent observations of couple interactions) is noteworthy.
* Compared with individuals in the control group, program group members reported experiencing slightly less psychological and physical abuse from their spouses. Men and women in the program group reported less psychological abuse in their relationships, and men in the program group reported that their spouses physically assaulted them less often, compared with their control group counterparts.
* Men and women in the program group reported slightly lower levels of adult psychological distress (such as feelings of sadness or anxiety) than their control group counterparts.
* The program did not significantly affect whether couples stayed married at the 12-month follow-up point.

The '''Rifian people''', in Tarifit: '''Irifiyen''', by others also known as '''Riff''', '''Riyefa''' or '''Ruafa''', are a Berber speaking people of Northwestern [[Africa]], who derive their name from the [[Rif]] region in the northern edge of [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name="Minahan2016p352"&gt;{{cite book|author=James B.

Their native settlements were Arabized and Islamized in and after the 7th-century, during the early expansion of [[Islam]].&lt;ref name="Oso2013p450"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5fUBAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA450|title=The International Handbook on Gender, Migration and Transnationalism|author=Irina Casado i Aijon|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1-78195-147-7|editor1=Laura Oso|pages=450 with notes 2-8|editor2=Natalia Ribas-Mateos}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are overwhelmingly [[marabout]]ic [[Sunni]] Muslims, but retain their pre-Islamic traditions such as high status for Rifian women.&lt;ref name="Minahan2016p352"/&gt;

According to Irina Casado i Aijon, Rifian people have traditionally organized themselves under "patrilineality and patrilocality principles".&lt;ref name="Oso2013p450"/&gt; The oldest man in the household commands authority and responsibility for decisions, while women jointly care for the young and sick without any discrimination. The Rifian people have retained some of their traditional occupations, such as working in pig meat industry, despite being Muslims and "pig meat" being [[haram]] in Islam.&lt;ref name="Oso2013p450"/&gt; Like other Berbers, temporary migration is an accepted tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Irina Casado i Aijon|editor1=Laura Oso|editor2=Natalia Ribas-Mateos|title=The International Handbook on Gender, Migration and Transnationalism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5fUBAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA450 |year=2013|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |isbn=978-1-78195-147-7|pages=439-449}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rifians have been a significant source of Morocco emigrants into some European countries such as the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Malcolm Klein|author2=Hans-Jürgen Kerner|author3=Cheryl Maxson et al|title=The Eurogang Paradox: Street Gangs and Youth Groups in the U.S. and Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ccTcBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT166 |year= 2012|publisher= Springer Science|isbn= 978-94-010-0882-2|pages=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maurice Crul|author2=Flip Lindo|author3=Ching Lin Pang|title=Culture, Structure and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lKHEO7um2nQC |year= 1999|publisher= Het Spinhuis|isbn= 978-90-5589-173-3|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=minahan1590/&gt;

The Rifian people speak the Tamazight group of Berber languages, specifically Tarifit or Zenatiya.&lt;ref name="Minahan2016p352"/&gt; The languages spoken depend on the region, with many Rifian who speak a Berber language also speaking Arabic or Spanish. Nineteen groups or social units of Rifians are known: 5 in the west along the Mediterranean coast which speak Arabic, 7 in the centre of which one speaks mainly Arabic and rest Rif language, 5 in the east and 2 in the southeastern desert area also speak the Rif-Berber language.&lt;ref name=britrif&gt;The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Rif-people Rif people], Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

They have inhabited an impoverished and an eroded, deforested, poorly irrigated region. Poverty rate and infant mortality rates among the Rifian people has been high, according to a study published in 1980 by Terri Joseph.&lt;ref name="Josephp418"/&gt; The Rifians have lived a largely settled, agricultural lifestyle, using hand tools, oxen and cattle to plow the steeply terraced land in their valleys. Horticultural produce along with sheep and goat meat, cheese, and milk provide the traditional sustenance.&lt;ref name="Josephp418"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Joseph | first=Terri Brint | title=Poetry as a Strategy of Power: The Case of Rifian Berber Women | journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society | publisher=University of Chicago Press | volume=5 | issue=3 | year=1980 | doi=10.1086/493728 | pages=418–434}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some practice sardine-seining along the Mediterranean coast.&lt;ref name=britrif/&gt;

[[File:Rif War map.png|thumb|left|''Le Rif'', a 1926 regional French map during the [[Rif War]].]]
The Rifian people have experienced numerous wars over their history. Some of their cultural traditions reflects and remembers this history, such as the singing and dancing of ''Ayara Liyara, Ayara Labuya'', which literally means "Oh Lady oh Lady, oh Lady Buya" and is accompanied by ''izran'' (couplets) and ''addjun'' (tambourine tapping).&lt;ref name="Ilahiane2017p44"/&gt; This tradition, states Hsain Ilahiane, is linked to the 11th-century destruction and deaths of the Rifian fathers during the raid by the Almoravid leader [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]].&lt;ref name="Ilahiane2017p44"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hsain Ilahiane|title=Historical Dictionary of the Berbers (Imazighen)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aRYuDgAAQBAJ |year=2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-1-4422-8182-0|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more modern times, the [[Rif War]] caused numerous deaths of Rifian people and of Spanish as well as French soldiers.

In 1958, some Rifian communities launched a modern nationalist movement.&lt;ref name="Minahan2016p352"/&gt; In the decades that followed, the Rif region has witnessed Rifian demonstrations and demands for recognition of Rifian language, culture and Berber studies at schools and universities.&lt;ref name=minahan1590&gt;{{cite book|author=James Minahan|title=Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: L-R|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9Lq_8Ozf5cC |year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing |isbn=978-0-313-32111-5|pages=1590–1592}}&lt;/ref&gt; A resurgent Rifian nationalism in 2010, their protests in 2013 and protests in 2017 for ''hogra'' – a humiliating treatment by an abusive state, has drawn public attention, as well as claims of brutal suppression by Moroccan authorities.&lt;ref name="Minahan2016p352"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David S.

Fikri was trying to retrieve fish that had been confiscated by the authorities. To locals, his death was a striking example of hogra—humiliating treatment by an abusive state. (...) The government has since exacerbated the situation with yet more hogra. In May it called the protesters separatists, though most are not, and suggested that they were foreign agents. (...) The unrest not only increased, but spread to other parts of the country, including Rabat, the capital, where on June 11th thousands of people rallied in support of the Rifians. All told, it is the largest display of public anger in Morocco since the Arab spring in 2011."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tribes and tribal groups==
The Rifians are divided into these tribes and tribal groups:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SpiOAwAAQBAJ|title=Tribe and Society in Rural Morocco|last=Hart|first=David M.|date=|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9781135302542|location=|pages=105|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Roundabout Appreciation Society''' ('''UKRAS''') is a group of people in the [[United Kingdom]] that discuss [[traffic]] [[roundabout]]s. The main topic of discussion is the [[architecture]] of the roundabouts, including their design and safety features. Other topics have included the approaches people take when driving towards and around a roundabout, and the [[wildlife]] present on some of the larger junctions. Their aim is to promote safe driving and consideration towards other road users.

The society was formed by Kevin Beresford after the success of a [[wall calendar|calendar]] that showed photographs of 12 roundabouts in [[Redditch]] &amp;ndash; it sold 100,000 worldwide. As of 2013, the association is reportedly trying to attract more women members, by putting a windmill on the front cover of its calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Roundabout Society 'sex-up' 2013 cult calendar by putting a windmill on the front cover|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4594256/roundabout-society-sex-up-calendar-windmill-on-front.html|accessdate=30 January 2013|newspaper=The Sun|date=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Estrela_Santo_Daime.jpg|thumb|right|Six pointed star with eagle and crescent, a common Santo Daime symbol worn by its religious practitioners.]]
{{Spiritualism sidebar}}
'''Santo Daime''' is a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] religion founded in the 1930s in the [[Brazil]]ian [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonian]] [[States of Brazil|state]] of [[Acre State|Acre]] by Raimundo Irineu Serra,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mestreirineu.org/galeriamestre.htm Mestre Irineu photos]&lt;/ref&gt; known as [[Mestre Irineu]]. Santo Daime incorporates elements of several religious or spiritual traditions including [[Folk Catholicism]], [[Kardecist Spiritism]], African [[animism]] and [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous]] South American [[shamanism]], including ''[[vegetalismo]]''.

Ceremonies&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; ''trabalhos'' (Brazilian Portuguese for "works")&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; are typically several hours long and are undertaken sitting in silent "concentration", or sung collectively, dancing according to simple steps in geometrical formation. [[Ayahuasca]], referred to as [[Daime]] within the practice, which contains several psychoactive compounds, is drunk as part of the ceremony. The drinking of Daime can induce a strong [[vomiting|emetic]] effect which is embraced as both emotional and physical purging.

Santo Daime churches promote a wholesome lifestyle in conformity with Irineu's motto of "harmony, love, truth and justice", as well as other key doctrinal values such as strength, humility, fraternity and purity of heart. The practice became a worldwide movement in the 1990s.

==History==
Santo Daime, sometimes called simply the 'Doctrine of Mestre Irineu',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santodaime.org/doctrine/whatis.htm Paragraph 5, "What is our religion?"] Cefluris, 2000, accessdate 2010-03-07&lt;/ref&gt; is the name given to the religious practice begun in the 1920s&lt;ref&gt;[http://libertedusantodaime.free.fr/shamansdrumtext/index.php?page=ro8 The history of Santo Daime] in 'The Santo Daime Doctrine', an interview with Alex Polari de Alverga - Shaman's Drum #22 - Winter 1990-91&lt;/ref&gt; in the far western Brazilian state (then-territory) of Acre by Raimundo Irineu Serra, a migrant from [[Maranhão]] in Brazil's northeast region.

Irineu Serra was born in Brazil in 1892 to African parents and migrated to the Western Amazon region in 1912, attracted to a boom in the rubber tapping industry. He first drank ayahuasca in the border region between Brazil, Bolivia, and Peru. As a result of experiencing a series of visions whilst spending eight days in solitude in the forest, he began to conduct spiritual ceremonies using ayahuasca. Many people came to him sick, seeking healing they could not afford or failed to find in standard medical practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afamiliajuramidam.org/english/personal_accounts/contemporary.htm Personal Accounts] Contemporary of Irineu Serra.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, Santo Daime teachings had no basis in written text, as early practitioners were illiterate,&lt;ref&gt;"Occasionally hymns were written down by hand; it is worth recalling that the majority of followers&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; including the 'owners' of hymnals&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; were illiterate or nearly so. People learned the hymns during the spiritual works, by ear,"... {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zpKfHtr_Ka4C&amp;pg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q=illiterate&amp;f=true |title=Opening The Portals of Haven |year=2010 |accessdate=2011-11-24| author = Beatriz Caiuby Labate, Gustavo Pacheco | ISBN = 978-3-643-10802-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"the use of ayahuasca potions, more so than any other entheogenic drug we know, has survived the onslaught of literacy and acculturation, to make a place for itself in the New Order" {{cite web |url=http://www.neip.info/downloads/Fotiou_Ayahuasca_2010.pdf |title=From medicine men to day trippers: shamanic tourism in Iquitos, Peru |publisher= The University of Wisconsin-Madison |year=2010 |accessdate=2011-11-24|author = Evgenia Fotiou|page = 10}}, who is in turn referring to Jonathan Ott (1993:242)&lt;/ref&gt; learning being experiential, through singing of inspired [[Santo Daime Hymns|hymns]] exploring the perennial values of love, harmony and strength through poetic and metaphorical imagery. The hymn collections of early practitioners have since become the sacred works of the doctrine.

==Ritual==
&lt;!-- {{Quote box3|quote='All who drink this holy beverage must not only try to see beautiful things while correcting their faults, but give shape to perfection of their own personality to take their place in this battalion and follow this line. If they would act this way, they could say, I am a brother.'| source='''Mestre Irineu'''|width=240px|align=right}}  --&gt;

Devotional in context, the songs praise divine principles. The Cross of Caravacca (named after the [[eponym]]ous town, [[Caravaca]]), with its double horizontal beam, stands on the altar. Each session begins and ends with Christian prayers. Santo Daime practice features several kinds of rituals. Two of these are ''concentrações'' ("concentrations") and ''bailados'' ("dances"), also known as ''hinários'' ("hymnals"). Other rituals focus on the saying of the rosary or on healing. Participants drink Daime in all types of rituals; but the format and focus will differ; concentrations are silent, seated meditations, while hymnals involve dancing and singing hymns while playing maracas.

The Christian core is combined with other elements, such as an emphasis on personal [[gnosis]] and responsibility, an animist appreciation of nature, such as the Sun, Moon and Stars, as well as the totemic symbol of the ''beija-flor'' ([[hummingbird]]). Spiritual beings from indigenous Amazonian shamanism and deities from the African pantheon such as Ogum and Iemanjá are also incorporated into the doctrine. The nature of the work is sometimes personified and addressed as ''Juramidam'', a name disclosed to Irineu in his visionary experience, which means literally, "God (jura) and his soldiers (midam)".

Ayahuasca, consumed by Daimistas in ceremonies, has many different traditional names, but is known within the Santo Daime as Santo Daime, meaning Holy Daime, or simply, Daime, as originally named by Irineu. ''Dai-me'' (with a hyphen) means "give me" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. A phrase, ''Dai-me força, dai-me amor'' ("give me strength, give me love"), recurs in the doctrine's hymns.

Participants in the ritual come to submit themselves to a process through which they may learn. This may include various wonders&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; ayahuasca is known for the visions it generates, and the sense of communion with nature and spiritual reality&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; as well as more mundane, less pleasant lessons about the self. The Daime is thought to reveal both positive and various negative or unresolved aspects of the individual, resulting in difficult "passages" involving the integration of this dissociated psychological content.

Ceremonies are referred to as "works". The effects of Daime combined with dancing, singing and concentration for up to twelve hours require and develop stamina or ''firmeza'' (firmness).

==Santo Daime hymns==
{{Main|Santo Daime hymns}}

The teachings of Santo Daime are transmitted through its hymns which, when sung, are intended to facilitate first hand experience of the divine. Musical accompaniment often includes the unison rhythmic playing of maracas, in strict 4:4 or 3:4 time, along with typical folk instruments such as guitars, accordion or flute. Irineu's hymn book contains 129 songs, and chronicles his spiritual journey and evolution from when he began drinking the Daime until his death. Through the singing of his hymns, the participant may connect with the spirit, teachings, and experience of Irineu and, in many ways, begin walking the same spiritual path.

The singing of the hinarios of early and senior members of the church coincides with official dates on the Santo Daime calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Céu do Mapiá [http://www.santodaime.org/doctrine/calendar.htm calendar of Works]&lt;/ref&gt; A significant proportion of members of the Santo Daime community also make collections of unique songs that they experience internally in connection with their practise. The process of experiencing such new songs in this context is referred to as "receiving".

==Denominational diversification==
The death of Mestre Irineu in 1971 resulted in a diversification within the Santo Daime community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afamiliajuramidam.org/english/the_children_of_juramidam/genealogy.htm#genealogia Genealogy of the Santo Daime doctrine]&lt;/ref&gt; From a global perspective, the most significant of these occurred when Sebastião Mota de Melo, commonly called [[Padrinho Sebastião]] ("Godfather Sebastião"), left the original center with a group of his followers, and formed a distinct group known as CEFLURIS (now{{when?|date=August 2018}} called ICEFLU). Many of Padrinho Sebastião's followers were Brazilians from the country's affluent south or citizens of other South American countries who were interested in Daime because of their experience with middle-class counterculture.

According to church documents, this split also entailed disagreement over the use of cannabis. Followers of Sebastião Mota de Melo believed cannabis to be a healing plant teacher, and referred to it as Santa Maria,&lt;ref&gt;[http://libertedusantodaime.free.fr/alfredoEN/pdf.php]  access date 2010-03-21 Section "The Angel of Santa Maria", Interview with Padrinho Alfredo, April 1996&lt;/ref&gt; using it in ceremony to help their mediumship (embodying of spirits for the purpose of healing). Subsequently, CEFLURIS formally addressed the issue of the ceremonial use of cannabis, and its use is now officially prohibited in and around the spiritual works.  Followers of Mestre Irineu's original church have always regarded the use of cannabis, as well as mediumship generally, as outside the doctrine. 

In the early 1980s Padrinho Sebastião moved the church headquarters to the village of [[Céu do Mapiá]], in the Brazilian [[States of Brazil|state]] of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]]. Control of CEFLURIS was increasingly shared with the its members who joined the movement in the 1970s, and in the 1980s CEFLURIS established centers in southern Brazil. The group now has affiliates in North America, Europe, and Japan, as well as throughout Brazil.

==Ayahuasca==
{{Main|Ayahuasca}}
[[File:Daime Encontro.JPG|thumb|right|Ayahuasca (called "Santo Daime" in Santo Daime religion) waiting for the beginning of the ceremonial work. Photo is digitally processed to protect anonymity of participants.]]
Ayahuasca, which contains the psychoactive compound [[dimethyltryptamine]] (DMT), has been the subject of increasing legal scrutiny in the last few decades as Santo Daime has expanded. The decoction has been explicitly legal for religious use in Brazil since 1986, while recent{{when?|date=August 2018}} legal battles in Europe have legalized its use in the Netherlands and Spain. In the United States, the Supreme Court in 2006 upheld a [[preliminary injunction]] permitting another Brazilian church, the [[União do Vegetal]] ([[UDV]]), to use ayahuasca ritually. This decision, as the result of specific litigation involving the UDV, applies only to that group, so the legal status of ayahuasca generally remains in a gray area in that country.

Santo Daime's [[entheogen]]ic sacrament, ayahuasca, has been used for millennia{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} in South American indigenous cultures.  It is one of the traditional tools of the [[Shamanism|shaman]] in South America, and in many regions is to this day a common medicine used for finding and treating various ailments as well as for its vision-inducing effects, which are said to be profound and life-changing.

The tea has had many names including Santo Daime (or simply Daime), Hoasca, Ayahuasca, Yage, and Caapi. It is made from two or more plants, one a woody vine (Ayahuasca vine or Jagube; generally ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi]]''), and the others known as admixtures. While various plants are used throughout South America, most of which have high concentrations of [[dimethyltryptamine]], the preferred admixture in the case of Santo Daime is ''[[Psychotria viridis]]'', known to church members as the "Queen of the Forest," after the figure who is said to have appeared to the church's founder in a vision, prompting him to start the religion. DMT occurs naturally in the human body and is speculated to be released at the time of death, but it is normally digested in the stomach if consumed and an [[MAOI]] (monoamine oxidase inhibitor), in this case tetrahydroharmine, harmine and harmaline, is needed to allow it to reach the brain in this way, thus the use of the vine. The Santo Daime Church uses only the Jagube vine and the Viridis leaf, not adding any other plants to the mixture. The tea is prepared ceremoniously over a week by members of the church in a festival called a 'feitio'. Hymns are sung, and Daime is drunk while the men hammer the vine into powder and the women clean and sort the leaves. Because of the very specific manner in which they prepare their sacrament, and the very specific way in which they use it, the beverage is not called 'Ayahuasca', but 'Santo Daime'. In some communities there are very clear distinctions.

==Legal status==
Due to their usage of ayahuasca as a sacrament and the spread of the religion, Santo Daime has found itself the center of Court battles and legal wrangling in various countries.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, CONFEN (the Federal Drug Council) has consistently upheld the right of the Daime Church to practice its religion and healing practices using the Daime. A study was made of the Daime by the CONFEN in 1987&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bialabate.net/pdf/texts/Resolu%c3%a7%c3%a3o%20n%c2%ba04%20de%201985.htm Resolução Nº 4] CONFEN, 30 de julho de 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bialabate.net/pdf/texts/resolucao_06.pdf Resolução Nº 06] CONFEN – 04 de fevereiro de 1986&lt;/ref&gt; which included visits to the various churches and observation of the making of the Daime. It also included study of another group of Ayahuasca users, who call the drink ''vegetal'' ([[União do Vegetal]] - UDV). The work group&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bialabate.net/pdf/texts/gmt_conad_english.pdf CONAD Multidisciplinary Working Group] MWG Ayahuasca – Brazil (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; which made the study included representatives not only of the CONFEN but also of several other government agencies. The conclusion&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bialabate.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/Resolu%C3%A7%C3%A3o-Conad-_1_25_01_2010.pdf Resolução N. 1 ] CONAD – 25 de Janeiro de 2010&lt;/ref&gt; of the study was that the Daime was a very positive influence in the community, encouraging social harmony and personal integration. The study noted that, rather than simply considering the pharmacological analysis of the plants, it was essential to consider the whole context of the use of the tea—religious, social, and cultural.

===United States===
In the [[United States]], court battles over ritual use of ayahuasca have mostly been fought by the [[União do Vegetal|UDV]], and practitioners of the Santo Daime doctrine are watching these events closely. So far, UDV has been able to continue practicing legally thanks to Supreme Court decisions that soundly rejected attempts by the government to prohibit it. As of September 2008, UDV is in negotiations with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] regarding regulation of their use of ayahuasca.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bialabate.net/pdf/udv_usa/govt%20petition%20for%20writ%20certiorari%20o%20centro.pdf Government’s request] to the Supreme Court to review the case&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bialabate.net/pdf/udv_usa/SCOTUS%20decision%2021%20feb%202006.pdf Supreme Court decision] in the UDV case&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, the three [[Oregon]] Santo Daime churches filed suit in federal court to gain legal status.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bialabate.net/texts/oregon-daime-case-documents Oregon Daime case documents]&lt;/ref&gt; Their trial ended January 23, 2009. The case, ''[[Church of the Holy Light of the Queen v. Mukasey]]'', presided over by Judge [[Owen M. Panner]], is ruled in favor of the Santo Daime church. 

In March 2009, Panner found that the use of hallucinogenic tea by members of such churches was legal, issuing an injunction barring the government from penalizing them for its consumption.

===Europe===
In the [[Netherlands]], Santo Daime won a court case in 2001&lt;ref name="holland"&gt;[http://www.santodaime.org/community/news/2105_holland.htm Court Case in Holland against the use of ayahuasca by the Dutch Santo Daime Church.] By Arno Adelaars&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed them to continue their ceremonial usage of ayahuasca.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mestreirineu.org/law_texts/2001%20Dutch%20Santo%20Daime%20Case%20-%20Abridged%20Judgment.pdf Dutch Santo Daime Case 2001]  – Abridged Judgment&lt;/ref&gt; One factor in this decision was a [[fax]] from the Secretary of the International Narcotics Control Board&lt;ref name="fax"&gt;[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/show_image.php?i=ayahuasca/images/archive/ayahuasca_law_undcp_fax1.jpg Letter of Herbert Schaepe] Secretary of the United Nations International Narcotics Control Board&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Netherlands]] Ministry of Public Health, stating that ''[P]reparations (e.g. decoctions) made of these plants, including ayahuasca are not under international control and, therefore, not subject to any of the articles of the 1971 Convention''.

In [[France]], Santo Daime won a court case allowing them to use the [[decoction]] in early 2005; however, they were not allowed an exception for religious purposes, but rather for the simple reason that they did not perform chemical extractions to end up with pure DMT and harmala and the plants used were not scheduled. Four months after the court victory, the common ingredients of ayahuasca as well as harmala were declared ''stupéfiants'', or narcotic scheduled substances, making the Daime and its ingredients illegal to use or possess.

The most recent decision came in [[Italy]] in 2006;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bialabate.net/news/italian-santo-daime-juridical-case-resume-and-comment Italian Santo Daime] juridical case resume and comment&lt;/ref&gt; an eight-month-long investigation had led to the arrest of 24 Italian Santo Daime members in early 2005, but the May 2006 ruling found that no sufficient evidence had been presented to demonstrate that the church members had broken Italian law.

==Academic research==
Two particularly important research projects are worth highlighting. The first is the official investigation made by the Brazilian government at the end of the 1980s, which resulted in the legalization of the religious use of [[ayahuasca]] in Brazil in 1992. The second is 'The Hoasca Project' developed by a collective of international scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neip.info/index.php/content/view/90.html Theses and texts of NEIP researchers, developers and corresponding] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110095334/http://www.neip.info/index.php/content/view/90.html |date=2010-01-10 }} (Interdisciplinary Group for Psychoactive Studies)&lt;/ref&gt; The Hoasca Project presented important findings regarding the use of ayahuasca as an agent of healing, something it is famous for in its indigenous context.

Another longitudinal research using a control group, but also controlling for rural vs. urban area, was conducted by a team of Spanish researchers and looked at church members that have used ayahuasca for 15 years and at least 2 times per month. The study was led by José Carlos Bouso and funded by MAPS. The study "found no evidence of psychological maladjustment, mental health deterioration or cognitive impairment in the ayahuasca-using group." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0042421| pmid=22905130| pmc=3414465|title = Personality, Psychopathology, Life Attitudes and Neuropsychological Performance among Ritual Users of Ayahuasca: A Longitudinal Study| journal=PLOS ONE| volume=7| issue=8| pages=e42421|year = 2012|last1 = Bouso|first1 = José Carlos| last2=González| first2=Débora| last3=Fondevila| first3=Sabela| last4=Cutchet| first4=Marta| last5=Fernández| first5=Xavier| last6=Ribeiro Barbosa| first6=Paulo César| last7=Alcázar-Córcoles| first7=Miguel Ángel| last8=Araújo| first8=Wladimyr Sena| last9=Barbanoj| first9=Manel J.| last10=Fábregas| first10=Josep Maria| last11=Riba| first11=Jordi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:SardusPaterBabai.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Depiction of Sardus Pater in a Roman coin (59 B.C.)]]
The ethnonym "S(a)rd" belongs to the [[Pre-Indo-European languages|Pre-Indo-European]] linguistic substratum. The oldest written attestation of the ethnonym is on the [[Nora stone]], where the word ''Šrdn'' bears witness to its original existence by the time the [[Phoenicians|Phoenician]] merchants first arrived to the Sardinian shores.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archeologianuragica.blogspot.com/2010/08/sul-nome-sardigna.html La stele di Nora contiene la lingua sarda delle origini, Salvatore Dedola]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], one of [[Plato]]'s dialogues, Sardinia and its people as well, the "Sardonioi" or "Sardianoi" (''Σαρδονιοί'' or ''Σαρδιανοί''), might have been named after "Sardò" (''Σαρδώ''), a legendary woman from [[Sardis]] (''Σάρδεις''), capital of the ancient Kingdom of [[Lydia]] in [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Platonis dialogi, scholia in Timaeum'' (edit. C. F. Hermann, Lipsia 1877), 25 B, pag. 368&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Pittau, ''La Lingua dei Sardi Nuragici e degli Etruschi'', Sassari 1981, pag. 57&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] and [[Sallust]] reported instead that Sardinians traced their descent back to a mythical ancestor, a [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] son of [[Hercules]] or [[Melqart]] revered as [[Sardus Pater|Sardus Pater ''Babai'']] ("Sardinian Father"), who gave the island its name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aristeo.org/sardegnaemiti/personaggi/sardo.html Personaggi: Sardo]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been claimed that the ancient [[Nuragic civilization|Nuragic]] Sards were associated with the [[Sherden]] (''šrdn'' in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]), one of the [[Sea Peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/sardi_%28Dizionario-di-Storia%29/ Sardi in ''Dizionario di Storia'' (2011), Treccani]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/sardi_res-c8fc02e8-8bb6-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_%28Enciclopedia-Italiana%29/ Sardi in ''Enciclopedia Italiana'' (1936), Giacomo Devoto, Treccani]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sardiniapost.it/culture/nuovo-studio-dellarcheologo-ugas-e-certo-i-nuragici-erano-gli-shardana/ Nuovo studio dell’archeologo Ugas: “È certo, i nuragici erano gli Shardana”]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sardiniapoint.it/5085.html ''Shardana, sardi nuragici: erano lo stesso popolo?'', Interview with Giovanni Ugas (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnonym was then [[Romanization|romanised]], with regard for the singular masculine and feminine form, as ''sardus'' and ''sarda''.

===Prehistory===
{{See also|Pre-Nuragic Sardinia}}
[[File:Neolitico, cultura di ozieri, frammento di vaso con figurette umane, 3500-2700 ac ca. 02.JPG|thumb|Fragment of pottery with human figures, [[Ozieri culture]]]]
Sardinia was first colonized in a stable manner during the [[Upper Paleolithic]] and the [[Mesolithic]] by people from the [[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]] and the [[Italian peninsula]]. During the [[Neolithic]] period and the Early Eneolithic, people from Italy, Spain and the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] area settled in Sardinia. In the Late [[Eneolithic]]-Early [[Bronze age]] the "[[Beaker folk]]" from [[Southern France]], Northeastern Spain and then from [[Central Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;Manlio Brigaglia –  Storia della Sardegna, pg. 48-49-50&lt;/ref&gt; settled on the island, bringing new metallurgical techniques and ceramic styles and probably some kind of [[Indoeuropean languages|Indo-European]] speech.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Ugas – L'alba dei Nuraghi , pg.22-23-24&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Etnie_Nuragiche-2.svg|150px|thumbnail|left|Composition of Nuragic tribes according to the Greek geographer [[Ptolemy]]]]

====Nuragic civilization====
{{See also|Nuragic civilization}}
The Nuragic civilization arose in the Middle Bronze Age, during the Late [[Bonnanaro culture]], which showed connections with the previous Beaker culture and the [[Polada culture]] of [[northern Italy]]. At that time, the grand tribal identities of Nuragic Sardinia were said to be three (roughly from the South to the North): the ''Iolei/[[Ilienses]]'', inhabiting the area from the southernmost plains to the mountainous zone of eastern Sardinia (later part of what would be called by the Romans ''Barbaria''); the ''[[Balares]]'', living in the North-West corner; and finally the ''[[Corsi people|Corsi]]'' stationed in [[Gallura]] (and [[Corsica]], to which they gave the name).&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Ugas – L'alba dei Nuraghi, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; Nuragic Sardinians have been connected by some scholars to the [[Sherden]], a tribe of the so-called [[Sea Peoples]], whose presence is registered several times in ancient Egyptian records.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sardiniapoint.it/5085.html SardiniaPoint.it – Interview with Giovanni Ugas, archaeologist and professor of the University of Cagliari] {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language (or languages) spoken in Sardinia during the Bronze Age is unknown, since there are no written records of such period. According to [[Eduardo Blasco Ferrer]], the [[Paleo-Sardinian language|Proto-Sardinian language]] was akin to [[Proto-Basque language|Proto-Basque]] and the [[Iberian language|ancient Iberian]], while others believe it was related to [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]]. Other scholars theorize that there were actually various linguistic areas (two or more) in Nuragic Sardinia, possibly [[Pre-Indo-European languages|Pre-Indoeuropeans]] and [[Indo-European languages|Indoeuropeans]].&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Ugas - L'Alba dei Nuraghi pg.241,254 - Cagliari, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiquity===
{{See also|Corsica and Sardinia}}
[[File:Limes Sardegna Punica.png|150px|thumbnail|left|In yellow the territories occupied by [[Carthage]] with the most important cities]]
In the 9th century BC, the [[Phoenicians]] founded cities and ports along the south-west coast, such as [[Cagliari|''Karalis'']], [[Bithia, Italy|''Bithia'']], [[Sulci|''Sulki'']] and ''[[Tharros]]''.

The south and west part of Sardinia was annexed by the [[Carthaginians]] in the late 6th century BC and later the whole island was conquered by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] in the 3rd century BC, after the [[First Punic War]]. Sardinia and Corsica were then made into a [[Corsica and Sardinia|single province]]. [[File:Sardegna Barbaria.png|thumbnail|150px|The Barbaria (in blue) and the Roman controlled regions of Sardinia (in yellow)]] Sardinia, with the exception of the innerlands and especially the central mountainous area called [[Barbagia]] (''Barbaria'' in Latin), was heavily [[Latinization (historical)|Latinized]] during the Roman period, and the modern [[Sardinian language]] is considered one of the most conservative [[Romance languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Contini &amp; Tuttle, 1982: 171; Blasco Ferrer, 1989: 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Story of Language, Mario Pei, 1949&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Romance Languages: A Historical Introduction, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, during the Roman rule there was a considerable immigration flow from the Italian peninsula into the island; ancient sources mention several populations of likely [[Italic peoples|Italic]] origin settling down in Sardinia, like the ''Patulcenses Campani'' (from [[Campania]]), the ''[[Falisci]]'' (from southern [[Etruria]]), the ''Buduntini'' (from [[Apulia]]) and the ''Siculenses'' (from [[Sicily]]). [[Roman colonies]] were also established in [[Porto Torres]] (''Turris Libisonis'') and ''[[Usellus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Mastino, ''Storia della Sardegna antica'', p.173&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]] gave a brief summary about the Mountaineer tribes, living in what would be called ''civitates Barbariae'', who refused assimilation during Roman rule, ''[[Geographica]]'' V ch.2:&lt;blockquote&gt;There are four nations of mountaineers, the Parati, Sossinati, Balari, and the Aconites. These people dwell in caverns. Although they have some arable land, they neglect its cultivation, preferring rather to plunder what they find cultivated by others, whether on the island or on the continent, where they make descents, especially upon the Pisatæ. The prefects sent [into Sardinia] sometimes resist them, but at other times leave them alone, since it would cost too dear to maintain an army always on foot in an unhealthy place.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Middle Ages===
After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], Sardinia was ruled in rapid succession by the [[Vandals]], the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], the [[Ostrogoths]]&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Cesare Casula – La Storia di Sardegna, pg.141&lt;/ref&gt; and again by the Byzantines.

During the [[Middle Ages]], the island was divided into [[Giudicati|four independent Kingdoms]] (known individually in [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] as ''Judicadu'', ''Giudicau'' or simply ''Logu'', that is "place"; in {{lang-it|Giudicato}}); all of them, with the exception of that of [[Giudicato of Arborea|Arborea]], fell under the influence of the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]]n [[maritime republics]], as well as some noble families of the two cities, like the [[Doria (family)|Doria]] and the [[Della Gherardesca]]. The Doria founded the cities of [[Alghero]] and ''Castelgenovese'' (today [[Castelsardo]]), while the Pisans founded ''Castel di Castro'' (today [[Cagliari]]) and ''Terranova'' (today [[Olbia]]); the famous [[count]] [[Ugolino della Gherardesca]], quoted by [[Dante Alighieri]] in his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', favored the birth of the mining town of ''Villa di Chiesa'' (today [[Iglesias, Sardinia|Iglesias]]), which became an Italian [[medieval commune]] along with [[Sassari]] and Castel di Castro.

Following the [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]] [[Aragonese conquest of Sardinia|conquest of the Sardinian territories belonging to Pisa]], which took place between 1323 and 1326, and then the long conflict between the Aragonese Kingdom and the [[Giudicato of Arborea]] (1353–1420), the newborn [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] became one of the states of the [[Crown of Aragon]]. The Aragonese repopulated the cities of Castel di Castro and Alghero with Iberian colonists, mainly [[Catalan people|Catalans]].&lt;ref&gt;Manlio Brigaglia – Storia della Sardegna , pg.158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/docid/49749d0028.html Minority Rights Group International – Sardinians]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Algherese|local dialect]] of Catalan is still spoken by a minority of people in the city of Alghero.

===Modern and contemporary history===

In the 16th and 17th centuries, the main Sardinian cities of Cagliari (the capital of the Kingdom), Alghero and Sassari appear well placed in the trades of the time. The cosmopolitan composition of its people provides evidence of it: the population was not only indigenous, but also hailing from Spain, Liguria, France and the island of [[Corsica]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Stranieri nella Cagliari del XVI e XVII secolo da "Los Otros: genti, culture e religioni diverse nella Sardegna spagnola”, Cagliari, 23 aprile 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Budruni, Da vila a ciutat: aspetti di vita sociale in Alghero, nei secoli XVI e XVII&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Max&gt;Carlo Maxia, Studi Sardo-Corsi, Dialettologia e storia della lingua fra le due isole&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in Sassari and across the strip of territory that goes from [[Anglona]] to [[Gallura]], the [[Corsicans]] became the majority of the population at least since the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Max"/&gt; This migration from the neighboring island, which is likely to have led to the birth of the [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]]-sounding [[Sassarese language|Sassarese]] and [[Gallurese dialect]]s,&lt;ref name="Max"/&gt; went on continuously until the 19th century.

The Spanish era ended in 1713, when the whole island was ceded to the Austrian [[House of Habsburg]], followed with another cession in 1718 to the [[Dukes of Savoy]], who assumed the title of "Kings of Sardinia". During this period, [[Liguria]]n colonists, escaped from [[Tabarka]], settled on the little islands of [[San Pietro Island|San Pietro]] and [[Sant'Antioco]] (at [[Carloforte]] and [[Calasetta]]), in the south-west area of Sardinia, bringing with them a [[Gallo-Italic languages|Gallo-Italic]] dialect called "Tabarchino", still widely spoken there. Then, the Piedmontese [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] annexed the whole Italian peninsula and [[Sicily]] in 1861 after the [[Risorgimento]], becoming the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]].

{{See also|History of mining in Sardinia}}
Since 1850, with the reorganization of the Sardinian mines, there had been a considerable migration flow from the Italian peninsula towards the Sardinian mining areas; these mainland miners came mostly from [[Lombardy]], Piedmont, [[Tuscany]] and [[Romagna]].&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Musso, Tra fabbrica e società: mondi operai nell'Italia del Novecento, Volume 33, p.316&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://notedarchivio.myblog.it/archive/2009/01/23/quando-i-bergamaschi-occuparono-le-case.html Quando i bergamaschi occuparono le case] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112124531/http://notedarchivio.myblog.it/archive/2009/01/23/quando-i-bergamaschi-occuparono-le-case.html |date=12 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an 1882 census realised by the French engineer Leon Goüine, in the south-western Sardinian mines worked 10.000 miners, one third of which coming from the Italian mainland;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sardegnaminiere.it/il_progresso_sociale.htm Il progresso sociale della Sardegna e lo sfruttamento industriale delle miniere – Sardegnaminiere.it]&lt;/ref&gt; most of them settled in Iglesias and ''[[Frazione|frazioni]]'' .

At the end of the 19th century, communities of fishermen from [[Sicily]], [[Torre del Greco]] (Campania) and [[Ponza]] (Lazio) migrated on the east coasts of the island, in the towns of [[Arbatax]]/[[Tortolì]], [[Siniscola]] and [[La Maddalena]].

In the 20th century, a large immigration flow from the Italian peninsula during the [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascist period]] occurred, as a result of a government policy: a number of people hailing from [[Veneto]] but also from [[Marche]], Abruzzo and [[Sicily]] came to Sardinia to populate the island, especially the new mining town of [[Carbonia, Sardinia|Carbonia]] and the villages of ''Mussolinia di Sardegna'' (now [[Arborea]]) and [[Fertilia]]; besides, after [[World War II]], [[Istrian Italians|Istrian Italian]] [[Istrian exodus|refugees]] were relocated in the [[Nurra]] region, along the north-west coastline. Today [[Istriot language|Istriot]], [[Venetian Language|Venetian]] and [[Friulan language|Friulan]] are spoken by the elderly in [[Fertilia]], [[Tanca Marchese]] and [[Arborea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.regione.veneto.it/videoinf/periodic/precedenti/99/1/celebrazioni.htm Veneti nel Mondo (Venetians in the World) – Anno III – numero 1 – Gennaio 1999] {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, few [[Italian Tunisian]] families settled in the sparsely populated area of [[Castiadas]], east of Cagliari.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lanuovasardegna.gelocal.it/regione/2011/04/23/news/e-al-ritorno-conquistarono-le-terre-abbandonate-1.3420885 E al ritorno conquistarono le terre abbandonate – La Nuova Sardegna]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Italian economic miracle]], a historic migratory movement from the inland to the coastal and urban areas of [[Cagliari]], Sassari-Alghero-[[Porto Torres]] and [[Olbia]], which today collect most of the people, took place.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Sardinia#Demographics}}

With a population density of 69/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="eupedia"&gt;[https://eupedia.com/italy/sardinia.shtml Sardinia Travel Guide, Eupedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt;, slightly more than a third of the national average, Sardinia is the fourth least populated region in Italy. The population distribution is anomalous compared to that of other Italian regions lying on the sea. In fact, contrary to the general trend, urban settlement has not taken place primarily along the coast but towards the centre of the island. Historical reasons for this include repeated [[Moors|Moorish]] raids during the [[Middle Ages]] (making the coast unsafe), widespread pastoral activities inland, and the swampy nature of the coastal plains (reclaimed only in the 20th century). The situation has been reversed with the expansion of seaside tourism; today all Sardinia's major urban centres are located near the coasts, while the island's interior is very sparsely populated.

It is the region of Italy with the lowest [[total fertility rate]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]] [http://demo.istat.it/altridati/indicatori/2005/Tab_4.pdf Numero medio di figli per donna per regione 2002–2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lanuovasardegna.gelocal.it/regione/2016/04/17/news/solo-1-1-figli-per-madre-la-sardegna-ultima-in-italia-1.13317171 Solo 1,1 figli per madre, la Sardegna ultima in Italia - La Nuova Sardegna]&lt;/ref&gt; (1.087 births per woman), and the region with the second-lowest [[birth rate]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]] [http://demo.istat.it/altridati/indicatori/2005/Tab_1.pdf Tassi generici di natalità, mortalità e nuzialità per regione 2002–2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The Sardinian fertility rate is actually the lowest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://seosardinia.wordpress.com/2016/09/02/fertilita-sardegna-ultima-al-mondo/ Fertilità, Sardegna ultima al mondo - Sardinian socio-economic Observatory]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the population in Sardinia has increased in recent years because of massive immigration, mainly from the Italian mainland, but also from Eastern Europe (esp. [[Romania]]), Africa and China.

As of 2013, there were 42.159 foreign (that is, any people who have not applied for Italian citizenship) national residents, forming 2.5% of the total population.&lt;ref name = Istat &gt;[http://demo.istat.it/str2013/index.html Rapporto Istat – La popolazione straniera residente in Italia al 31º dicembre 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age expectancy and Longevity===

[[File:Vendiagram.gif|thumb|Diagram of longevity clues in the main [[Blue Zones]]]]

Average [[life expectancy]] is slightly over 82 years (85 for women and 79.7 for men&lt;ref&gt;ISTAT - INDICATORI DEMOGRAFICI anno 2015-  page 6&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Geographical distribution===
Most Sardinians are native to the island but a sizable number of people have settled outside Sardinia: it had been estimated that, between 1955 and 1971, 308,000 Sardinians have emigrated to the Italian mainland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asei.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=42:lemigrazione-della-sardegna&amp;catid=65:articoli&amp;Itemid=250 Giuseppe Sanna – L'emigrazione della Sardegna (Emigration of Sardinia)] {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sizable Sardinian communities are located in [[Piedmont]], Liguria, [[Lombardy]], Tuscany and [[Lazio|Latium]].
&lt;br /&gt; Sardinians and their descendants are also numerous in Germany, France, [[Belgium]], Switzerland. Almost all the Sardinians migrating to the [[Americas]] settled down in the [[South America|Southern part]] of the continent, especially in [[Argentina]] (between 1900 and 1913 about 12,000 Sardinians lived in [[Buenos Aires]] and neighbourhoods)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scuolebolotana.it/CD%20AMBASSADORES/emigraz_sarda_900.htm L'emigrazione sarda tra la fine dell' 800 e i primi del 900]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Uruguay]] (in [[Montevideo]] in the 1870s lived 12,500 Sardinians).

The Region of Sardinia keeps a register of overseas Sardinians that managed to set up, in the Italian mainland and the rest of the world, a number of cultural associations: these are meant to provide the people of Sardinian descent, or those with an interest on Sardinian culture, an opportunity to enjoy a wide range of activities. As of 2012, there are 145 clubs registered on it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sardegnamigranti.it/documenti/25_410_20121011104934.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surnames and given names===
The most common Sardinian surnames, like ''Sanna'' (fang), ''Piras'' (pears), ''Pinna'' (feather, pen) and ''Melis'' (honey),&lt;ref&gt;[http://lanuovasardegna.gelocal.it/regione/2016/03/22/news/i-sanna-battono-i-piras-e-loro-il-cognome-piu-diffuso-in-sardegna-ecco-la-classifica-1.13172814 I Sanna battono i Piras: è loro il cognome più diffuso in Sardegna.

As to what pertains to given names, the most widespread on the island are now the Italian ones. Nevertheless, a [[:it:Prenomi sardi|number of Sardinian-specific personal names]] is historically attested and they were prevalent among the islanders up until the contemporary era.

[[File:Sardinia Language Map.png|thumb|right|220px|Geographic distribution of traditional languages and dialects spoken in Sardinia]]
Alongside Italian (''Italiano'') that, once first introduced in the island by law in July 1760,&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Bolognesi, ''The phonology of Campidanian Sardinian : a unitary account of a self-organizing structure'', The Hague : Holland Academic Graphics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amos Cardia, ''S'italianu in Sardìnnia'', Iskra&lt;/ref&gt; became the official language of the Piedmontese Kingdom at the expense of Spanish and Catalan, [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] (''su sardu'')&lt;ref name="Sardinians"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sardinian is generally considered to be the most conservative [[Romance languages|Romance language]], and was also the first language to split off genetically from the rest of the others, possibly as early as the 1st century BC. Sardinian is traditionally subdivided into two groups: the first one would be [[Logudorese dialect|Logudorese]] (''su sardu logudoresu'') and the second one would be [[Campidanese dialect|Campidanese]] (''su sardu campidanesu'').&lt;/ref&gt; is the other most widely spoken language of the island and has also been the historical language of indigenous Sards,&lt;ref&gt;Danver, Steven.

De Gruyter Mouton&lt;/ref&gt; ever since [[Latin language|Latin]] supplanted the old [[Paleo-Sardinian language|Paleo-Sardinian]]. However, because of a rather rigid model of Italian education system that strongly discouraged the Sardinian youth from learning and speaking their language,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.degruyter.com/view/product/180542 ''Manuale di linguistica sarda'' (Manual of Sardinian linguistics)], 2017, Ed. by Eduardo Blasco Ferrer, Peter Koch, Daniela Marzo. Manuals of Romance Linguistics, De Gruyter Mouton, pp.208&lt;/ref&gt; the numbers of people retaining Sardinian have gradually become a minority in their own island, giving way to a [[Regional Italian#Sardinia|regional variety of Italian]] instead. As a result of that, Sardinian is currently facing challenges analogue to other [[minority language]]s across Europe,&lt;ref&gt;''Sardinia'', Lonely Planet, Damien Simonis, pg. 44&lt;/ref&gt; and both the Logudorese and Campidanese dialects (the main varieties of Sardinian) have been designated as definitely [[Endangered language|endangered]] by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/ UNESCO Interactive Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger]&lt;/ref&gt; The other languages spoken on Sardinia, all also endangered but with much fewer speakers than Sardinian, are not indigenous to the island but developed after the settlement of certain ethnic communities, namely [[Corsicans]], [[Catalans]] and [[Genoa|Genoese]], in different regions of the island over recent centuries; these include [[Sassarese language|Sassarese]] (''Sassaresu''),&lt;ref&gt;It's a language born as a [[lingua franca]] of [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]]-[[Corsican language|Corsican]] origin, with minor [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and Spanish influences and major [[Logudorese dialect|Logudorese Sardinian]] influence.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gallurese]] (''Gadduresu''),&lt;ref&gt;It's a [[Corsican language|Corsican]] dialect with [[Logudorese dialect|Logudorese Sardinian]] influence.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Algherese Catalan]] (''Alguerés''),&lt;ref&gt;It's a [[Catalan language|Catalan]] dialect spoken in [[Alghero]] by the time Catalan invaders repopulated the town and expelled the indigenous population.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian Tabarchino]] (''Tabarchin'').&lt;ref&gt;It's a [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]] dialect spoken in [[Carloforte]] and [[Calasetta]].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flag of Sardinia, Italy.svg|250px|thumb|left|The Sardinian flag]]

===Flag===
{{Main|Flag of Sardinia}}
The so-called [[Sardinian flag|flag of the Four Moors]] is the historical and official flag of Sardinia. The flag is composed of the [[St George's Cross]] and four [[Maure|Moor]]'s heads wearing a white bandana in each quarter. Its origins are basically shrouded in mystery, but it is presumed it originated in [[Aragon]] to symbolize the defeat of the [[Saracen]] invaders in the [[battle of Alcoraz]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Fois, ''The crest of the four Moors, brief history of the Sardinian emblem'', Carlo Delfino, Sassari 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sardinia's Day===
Sardinia's Say (''[[Sa die de sa Sardigna]]'' in Sardinian) is a holiday celebrated each 28 April to commemorate the [[Giovanni Maria Angioy#Anti-Feudal revolts|revolt]] occurring from 1794 to 1796 against the feudal privileges, and the execution or expulsion of the [[House of Savoy|Savoyard]] officials (including the Piedmontese viceroy, Balbiano) from Sardinia on 28 April 1794. The rebellion was spurred by the King's refusal to grant the island the autonomy the locals demanded in exchange for defeating the French.&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Loni e Giuliano Carta.

Le ragioni, la storia, i protagonisti, Cagliari, Condaghes, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The holiday has been formally recognised by the Sardinian Council since 14 September 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sardegnacultura.it/j/v/258?s=23536&amp;v=2&amp;c=2772&amp;t=1 Sa die de sa Sardigna, Sardegna Cultura]&lt;/ref&gt; Some public events are annually held to commemorate the episode, while the schools are closed.

===Religion===
[[File:Scalinata N.S. di Bonaria - Cagliari.jpg|Basilica of Our Lady of Bonaria in Cagliari|thumb]]
The vast majority of the Sardinians are baptized as [[Roman Catholic]], however [[church attendance]] is one of the lowest in Italy (21.9%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://dati.istat.it/index.aspx?lang=en&amp;SubSessionId=2da4a73f-72e4-46b4-a3dc-1b66e6c78dc7&amp;themetreeid=-200 ISTAT]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Shrine of Our Lady of Bonaria|Our Lady of Bonaria]] is the Patroness Saint of Sardinia.

===Traditional clothes===
Colourful and of various and original forms, the Sardinian traditional clothes are a clear symbol of belonging to specific collective identities. Although the basic model is homogeneous and common throughout the island, each town or village has its own traditional clothing which differentiates it from the others.

In the past, the clothes diversified themselves even within the communities, performing a specific function of communication as it made it immediately clear the marital status and the role of each member in the social area. Until the mid-20th century the traditional costume represented the everyday clothing in most of Sardinia, but even today in various parts of the island it is possible to meet elderly people dressed in costume.

The materials used for their packaging are among the most varied, ranging from the typical Sardinian woollen fabric (''orbace'') to silk and from [[linen]] to leather. The various components of the feminine apparel are: the headgear (''mucadore''), the shirt (''camisa''), the bodice (''palas'', ''cossu''), the jacket (''coritu'', ''gipone''), the skirt (''unnedda'', ''sauciu''), the apron (''farda'', ''antalena'', ''defentale''). Those of the male are: the headdress (''berritta''), the shirt (''bentone'' or ''camisa''), the jacket (''gipone''), the trousers (''cartzones'' or ''bragas''), the skirt (''ragas'' or ''bragotis''), the overcoat (''gabbanu'', ''colletu'') and the ''mastruca'', a sort of sheep or lamb leather jacket without sleeves ("''mastrucati latrones''" or "thieves with rough wool cloaks" was the name by which [[Cicero]] denigrated the Sardinians who rebelled against the Roman power).

==Genetics==
{{Main|Genetic history of Europe}}
Sardinians, while being part of the European [[gene pool]], are outliers in the European genetic landscape&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=5400395 | pmid=28177087 | doi=10.1093/molbev/msx082 | volume=34 | title=Mitogenome Diversity in Sardinians: A Genetic Window onto an Island's Past | journal=Mol Biol Evol | pages=1230–1239 | last1 = Olivieri | first1 = A | last2 = Sidore | first2 = C | last3 = Achilli | first3 = A | last4 = Angius | first4 = A | last5 = Posth | first5 = C | last6 = Furtwängler | first6 = A | last7 = Brandini | first7 = S | last8 = Capodiferro | first8 = MR | last9 = Gandini | first9 = F | last10 = Zoledziewska | first10 = M | last11 = Pitzalis | first11 = M | last12 = Maschio | first12 = A | last13 = Busonero | first13 = F | last14 = Lai | first14 = L | last15 = Skeates | first15 = R | last16 = Gradoli | first16 = MG | last17 = Beckett | first17 = J | last18 = Marongiu | first18 = M | last19 = Mazzarello | first19 = V | last20 = Marongiu | first20 = P | last21 = Rubino | first21 = S | last22 = Rito | first22 = T | last23 = Macaulay | first23 = V | last24 = Semino | first24 = O | last25 = Pala | first25 = M | last26 = Abecasis | first26 = GR | last27 = Schlessinger | first27 = D | last28 = Conde-Sousa | first28 = E | last29 = Soares | first29 = P | last30 = Richards | first30 = MB | last31 = Cucca | first31 = F | last32 = Torroni | first32 = A | year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (together with the [[Basque people|Basques]], the [[Sami people|Sami]] and the [[Icelanders]]&lt;ref&gt;Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, Paolo Menozzi, Alberto Piazza - ''The History and Geography of Human Genes'', 1994, Princeton University Press, pp.272&lt;/ref&gt;) in part because of particular phenomena that are often found in isolated populations, such as the [[founder effect]] and the [[genetic drift]]. The data seem to suggest that the current population is derived in large part from the [[Stone age]] settlers,&lt;ref name="Cucca" /&gt;  with some other minor contributions in the [[Chalcolithic]] and the early [[Bronze age]]; the contribution, in terms of [[gene flow]], of the historical colonizers appears in fact to be very scarce.&lt;ref&gt;Franco Germanà, L'uomo in Sardegna dal paleolitico all'età nuragica p.202-206&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CuccaFrancesco"&gt;[http://www.sardegnaricerche.it/index.php?xsl=370&amp;s=37041&amp;v=2&amp;c=3280&amp;nc=1&amp;sc=&amp;archivio=2&amp;qr=1&amp;qp=3&amp;vd= ''Genetica, malattie e caratteri dei sardi'', Francesco Cucca - Sardegna Ricerche]&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers found the Basques to be the genetically closest population to the Sardinians, and that such similarity is not mediated by the influence of other Spaniards in modern times.&lt;ref name="Naturegen" /&gt;

Recent comparisons between the Sardinians' genome and that of some individuals from the Neolithic and the early Chalcolithic, who lived in the [[Alps|Alpine]] ([[Oetzi]]), German, and Hungarian regions, showed considerable similarities between the two populations, while at the same time consistent differences between the prehistoric samples and the present inhabitants of the same geographical areas were noted.&lt;ref name=Gamba&gt;[http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/141021/ncomms6257/full/ncomms6257.html Genome flux and stasis in a five millennium transect of European prehistory]&lt;/ref&gt; From this it can be deduced that, while [[central Europe|central]] and northern Europe have undergone significant demographic changes due to post-Neolithic migrations, presumably from the eastern periphery of Europe ([[Pontic-Caspian steppe]]) and possibly from [[Scandinavia]],&lt;ref&gt;Lazaridis et al., Ancient human genomes suggest three ancestral populations for present-day Europeans p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Southern Europe and Sardinia in particular were affected less; Sardinians appear to be the population that has best preserved the [[Neolithic]] legacy of Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Keller at al 2011, Nature"&gt;[http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v3/n2/full/ncomms1701.html Keller at al 2011, Nature]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mathieson et al 2015, Nature"&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v528/n7583/full/nature16152.html Mathieson et al 2015, Nature]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="supp. info p.16"&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v528/n7583/extref/nature16152-s1.pdf supp. info (p.16)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mbe.oxfordjournals.org"&gt;[http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/12/3132.full.pdf+html ''A Common Genetic Origin for Early Farmers from Mediterranean Cardial and Central European LBK Cultures'', Olalde et al 2015, Molecular Biology and Evolution]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;[http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/141021/ncomms6257/full/ncomms6257.html Gamba et al 2014, ''Genome flux and stasis in a five millennium transect of European prehistory'', Nature]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cell.com"&gt;[http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2815%2901516-X Omrak et al 2016, ''Genomic Evidence Establishes Anatolia as the Source of the European Neolithic Gene Pool'', Current Biology, Volume 26, Issue 2, p270–275, 25 January 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haak&gt;[http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/02/10/013433 Haak et al 2015, ''Massive migration from the steppe was a source for Indo-European languages in Europe'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="supp. info p.120"&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v522/n7555/extref/nature14317-s1.pdf supp. info (p.120)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gamba"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/reference-populations-next-gen/ ''Reference Populations Genographic Project''.

However, Sardinians as a whole are not a homogeneous population genetically: some studies have found some differences among the various villages of the island;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004654 High Differentiation among Eight Villages in a Secluded Area of Sardinia Revealed by Genome-Wide High Density SNPs Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt; in this regard, the mountainous area of [[Province of Ogliastra|Ogliastra]] (part of the wider region of [[Barbagia]]) is more distant from the rest of Europe and the Mediterranean than other Sardinian sub-regions located in the plains and in the coastal areas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v20/n11/full/ejhg201265a.html Genome-wide scan with nearly 700 000 SNPs in two Sardinian sub-populations suggests some regions as candidate targets for positive selection]&lt;/ref&gt; in part because these more accessible areas show, like the rest of much of Europe, a moderate genetic influx from the [[Yamna culture]] pastoralists, thought to be the carriers of [[Indo-European languages]] into Europe, while Ogliastra has retained unaltered Mesolithic/Neolithic roots.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ep70.eventpilot.us/web/page.php?page=IntHtml&amp;project=ASHG16&amp;id=160122402 Chiang et al., Using whole-genome sequencing to shed insight on the complex prehistory of Sardinia]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study released in 2014, the [[genetic diversity]] among some Sardinian individuals from different regions of the island is between 7 and 30 times higher than the one found among other [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European ethnicities]] living thousands kilometers away from each other, like [[Spaniards]] and [[Romanians]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unionesarda.it/articolo/cronaca_sardegna/2014/01/09/il_dna_sardo_il_pi_vario_d_europa_ricerca_sugli_abitanti_di_benetutti-6-348952.html Il Dna sardo è il più vario d'Europa Ricerca sugli abitanti di Benetutti – Unione Sarda]&lt;/ref&gt; A similar phenomenon is common to some other isolated populations, like the [[Ladin people|Ladin]] groups living in [[Veneto]] and the [[Alps|Alpine]] area,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniroma1.it/sites/default/files/allegati_news/segnalazione%20media_0.pdf Italiani, i più ricchi in Europa … di diversità genetica – Uniroma]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/scienze/2014/01/09/news/italiani_popolo_pi_ricco_di_diversit_genetica_in_europa-75495329/ Gli italiani sono il popolo con la varietà genetica più ricca d'Europa – La Repubblica]&lt;/ref&gt; where the regional orography negatively affected the amount of interactions among each other.

However, while a very high degree of interindividual genetic differentiation has been detected on multiple occasions, other studies have also stated that such variability does not occur among the main macro-regions of the island: a Sardinian region like the [[Barbagia]] has been proven not to be significantly different from the regions on the coast, like the area of [[Cagliari]] and [[Oristano]].&lt;ref name="CuccaFrancesco" /&gt; Another study, based on the multinomial logistic regression model, suggested again a high degree of homogeneity within the Sardinian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=3961211 | pmid=24651212 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0091237 | volume=9 | title=Sardinians genetic background explained by runs of homozygosity and genomic regions under positive selection | year=2014 | journal=PLoS One | page=e91237 | last1 = Di Gaetano | first1 = C | last2 = Fiorito | first2 = G | last3 = Ortu | first3 = MF | last4 = Rosa | first4 = F | last5 = Guarrera | first5 = S | last6 = Pardini | first6 = B | last7 = Cusi | first7 = D | last8 = Frau | first8 = F | last9 = Barlassina | first9 = C | last10 = Troffa | first10 = C | last11 = Argiolas | first11 = G | last12 = Zaninello | first12 = R | last13 = Fresu | first13 = G | last14 = Glorioso | first14 = N | last15 = Piazza | first15 = A | last16 = Matullo | first16 = G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SardiNIA study in 2015 showed, by using the [[Fixation index|''F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;'']] differentiation statistic, a clear genetic differentiation between Sardinians (whole genome sequence of 2120 individuals from across the island and especially the [[Lanusei]] valley) and mainland Italian populations (1000 genomes), and reported an even greater difference between Sardinians from the Lanusei valley and other European populations. This pattern of differentiation is also evident in the lengths for [[haplotypes]] surrounding rare variants [[Locus (genetics)|loci]], with a similar haplotype length for Sardinian populations and shorter length for populations with low grade of common ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sidore, C., y colaboradores |title=Genome sequencing elucidates Sardinian genetic architecture and augments association analyses for lipid and blood inflammatory markers |year=2015 |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=47 |pages=1272–1281 |doi=10.1038/ng.3368 |pmid=26366554 |pmc=4627508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sindhi Bhagat''' is a [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] [[folk art]] incorporating song, dance, story and drama.  It is the most popular Sindhi folk form of entertainment.

==History==
Bhagat developed through the years. Its origin could be traced to the ancient [[bard]]s who wandered through the countryside singing and narrating the old heroic [[ballad]]s of the lovers and warriors of the olden times.  The Sindhi Bhagat acquired its distinct form over a century ago, gradually developing into the current popular source of cultural entertainment.  Its performances became more professional and it became a collectively created folk-art form.

==Performance==
The pivotal character in the performance is the "Bhagat", after whom the art form is named. He is the prime dancer, the [[storytelling|storyteller]], and the soul of the performance.  The others are the "Boldias" (supporting players) and also the players of musical instruments such as [[Pump organ|harmonium]], [[tabla]], [[dholak]], [[khanjri]], etc., simple rhythmical instruments.

The Bhagat combines the finer qualities of different performing arts in such an effective and appealing order that the audience are kept spellbound for hours together, because the Bhagat is supposed to start late in the evening, when the village or town folk have taken their night meal and are ready to sit till the early hours of the next morning.  Men, women and children partake of the bewitching pleasure of the performance, often sitting through the night.

The Bhagat with his melodious voice, the delicate rhythm of his steps, body movements and very effective dramatised storytelling, keeps the audience glued to their seats without even blinking their eyes throughout the show.  He has a variegated voice, creating different moods – be it pathos, agony, humour, melody, glory, or tragedy as required for the narration.  He moves the hearts of his audience, bringing laughter or tears as the situation demands.

==Sindhi Bhagat today==
Bhagat is the most important and integral part of Sindhi folk-art, a rich cultural heritage of the Sindhi community and widely acclaimed.  There were once scores of these versatile artists in the countryside as well as in the urban pockets of Sind.  However, after partition of the country this folk art is on the decline due to a variety of reasons, including the influence of electronic [[mass media]] and socio-economic compulsion.  However, there are still a few prominent Bhagats who are dedicated and perform occasionally.

The '''Touring club de France''' (1890-1983) was a French [[social club]] devoted to travel, founded by enthusiasts of the [[velocipede]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Patrick Young|title=Enacting Brittany: Tourism and Culture in Provincial France, 1871–1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XrUovnBf-VEC|year= 2012|publisher=Ashgate |isbn=978-1-4094-8381-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swenson2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Astrid Swenson|title=The Rise of Heritage: Preserving the Past in France, Germany and England, 1789–1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R4DBAgAAQBAJ|year= 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-46911-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its headquarters sat on the [[Avenue de la Grande Armée]] in [[Paris]]. {{sfn|The Automobile|1907}}

==History==
The idea of the Touring club de France was inspired by the british [[CTC (cycling)|Cyclists' Touring Club]], founded in 1873 and also devoted to [[cyclism]], and promoted in France under the impulse of [[Paul de Vivie]].

The archives of the Touring club de France were given in 1984 to the [[Archives nationales (France)|French National Archives]] (number 53 AS).&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [https://www.siv.archives-nationales.culture.gouv.fr/siv/rechercheconsultation/consultation/pog/consultationPogN3.action?nopId=p-3nlhemy8f-evpa6c4fdyz4&amp;pogId=FRAN_POG_06&amp;search= Description of the TCF archives at the French National Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prize==
The Touring club de France used to award several prizes to support [[mountain guide]]s fathers of large families. The Jean S. Barès Prize was awarded to mountain guides from the [[Pyrénées]], living above an altitude of 500 meters and raising at least seven children, all born at that altitude or above. The recipient of that prize in 1928 was Pierre Mayneris, a mountain guide from [[Baillestavy]], near the [[Canigou]], who received 2400 francs as a support to raise his nine children. The Brunier Prize was the equivalent for mountain guides living in the [[French Alps]] above an altitude of 1000 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{66 PHPC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===Colonial===

In [[Colonial history of the United States|Colonial America]] elementary education was widespread in New England, but limited elsewhere. New England Puritans believed it was necessary to study the Bible, so boys and girls were taught to read at an early age. It was also required that each town pay for a primary school. About 10 percent enjoyed secondary schooling. Few girls attended formal schools, but most were able to get some education at home or at so-called "Dame schools" where women taught basic reading and writing skills in their own houses. By 1750, nearly 90% of New England's women and almost all of its men could read and write. There was no higher education for women.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Cremin, ''American Education: The Colonial Experience, 1607–1783'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

Tax-supported schooling for girls began as early as 1767 in New England. It was optional and some towns proved reluctant. Northampton, Massachusetts, for example, was a late adopter because it had many rich families who dominated the political and social structures and they did not want to pay taxes to aid poor families. Northampton assessed taxes on all households, rather than only on those with children, and used the funds to support a grammar school to prepare boys for college. Not until after 1800 did Northampton educate girls with public money. In contrast, the town of Sutton, Massachusetts, was diverse in terms of social leadership and religion at an early point in its history. Sutton paid for its schools by means of taxes on households with children only, thereby creating an active constituency in favor of universal education for both boys and girls.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Kish Sklar, "The Schooling of Girls and Changing Community Values in Massachusetts Towns, 1750–1820,"  ''History of Education Quarterly'' 1993 33(4): 511–542&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:hollischoolhouse.jpg|thumb|Colonial schoolhouse in [[Hollis, New Hampshire]]]]

Historians point out that reading and writing were different skills in the colonial era.  School taught both, but in places without schools reading was mainly taught to boys and also a few privileged girls. Men handled worldly affairs and needed to read and write. Girls only needed to read (especially religious materials). This educational disparity between reading and writing explains why the colonial women often could read, but could not write and could not sign their names—they used an "X".&lt;ref&gt;E. Jennifer Monaghan, "Literacy Instruction and Gender in Colonial New England," ''American Quarterly'' 1988 40(1): 18–41 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2713140 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
Coinciding with the beginnings of the [[First-wave feminism|first wave]] of [[feminism]] in the 20th century came the attempt by women to gain equal rights to education in the United States.  Women's rights organizations focused on adjusting and increasing women's place in the public arena by arguing that the only fundamental differences between women and men were socially constructed ones, and thus women should be offered the same extensive and practical education that were offered to men. After long battles against gender oppression women finally obtained the right to be educated through several government acts/conventions, the opening of facilities willing to educate them, and the opportunity to continue into higher education.&lt;ref name="Wood, J T. 2009"&gt;Wood, J T. (2009). Gendered Lives. Boston: Lyn Uhl.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s===
Education was a controversial topic in the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rury|first=John|title=Vocationalism for Home and Work: Women's Education in the United States, 1880–1930|journal=History of Education Quarterly|date=Spring 1984|volume=24|issue=1|page=37|doi=10.2307/367991}}&lt;/ref&gt;“ and sex-segregated school systems protected “the virtue of female high school students.”  .”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rury|first=John|title=Vocationalism for Home and Work: Women's Education in the United States, 1880–1930|journal=History of Education Quarterly|date=Spring 1984|volume=24|issue=1|page=39|doi=10.2307/367991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Home economics and industrial education were new elements of the high school curriculum designed for unmistakably women's occupations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rury|first=John|title=Vocationalism for Home and Work: Women's Education in the United States, 1880–1930|journal=History of Education Quarterly|date=Spring 1984|volume=24|issue=1|page=40|doi=10.2307/367991}}&lt;/ref&gt; These classes taught women practical skills such as sewing, cooking, and using the new domestic inventions of the era; unfortunately, this “formal training offered women little advantage in the struggle for stable work at a liveable wage.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rury|first=John|title=Vocationalism for Home and Work: Women's Education in the United States, 1880–1930|journal=History of Education Quarterly|date=Spring 1984|volume=24|issue=1|page=36|doi=10.2307/367991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1930s also saw tremendous changes in women’s education at the college level. In 1900, there were 85,338 female college students in the United States and 5,237 earned their bachelor's degrees; by 1940, there were 600,953 female college students and 77,000 earned bachelor's degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nash|first=Margaret|author2=Romero, Lisa|title="Citizenship for the College Girl": Challenges and Opportunities in Higher Education for Women in the United States in the 1930s|journal=Teachers College Record|year=2012|volume=114|issue=2|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increase was partially explained by the “contemporary discourse that reinforced the need for higher education for women in their positions as wives, mothers, citizens, and professionals.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nash|first=Margaret|author2=Romero, Lisa|title="Citizenship for the College Girl": Challenges and Opportunities in Higher Education for Women in the United States in the 1930s|journal=Teachers College Record|year=2012|volume=114|issue=2|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the proper role for a white, middle class woman in 1930s American society was that of wife and mother,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nash|first=Margaret|author2=Romero, Lisa|title="Citizenship for the College Girl": Challenges and Opportunities in Higher Education for Women in the United States in the 1930s|journal=Teachers College Record|year=2012|volume=114|issue=2|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguments in favor of women's education emphasized concepts of eugenics and citizenship. Education showed women how to exercise their civic responsibilities, and it showed them the importance of the vote. Participation in student government trained women “early to become leaders later.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nash|first=Margaret|author2=Romero, Lisa|title="Citizenship for the College Girl": Challenges and Opportunities in Higher Education for Women in the United States in the 1930s|journal=Teachers College Record|year=2012|volume=114|issue=2|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study showed that in 1935, 62 percent of women college graduates voted compared to only 50 percent of women who did not attend college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nash|first=Margaret|author2=Romero, Lisa|title="Citizenship for the College Girl": Challenges and Opportunities in Higher Education for Women in the United States in the 1930s|journal=Teachers College Record|year=2012|volume=114|issue=2|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic assumption in the 1930s was that women should marry. There was also the perception that college educated women were less likely to marry, either because they “waited too long” or because the college experience which broadened their minds deluded them into believing “marriage should be between equals.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nash|first=Margaret|author2=Romero, Lisa|title="Citizenship for the College Girl": Challenges and Opportunities in Higher Education for Women in the United States in the 1930s|journal=Teachers College Record|year=2012|volume=114|issue=2|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argued college made women better wives and mothers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nash|first=Margaret|author2=Romero, Lisa|title="Citizenship for the College Girl": Challenges and Opportunities in Higher Education for Women in the United States in the 1930s|journal=Teachers College Record|year=2012|volume=114|issue=2|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it “imparted practical skills.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nash|first=Margaret|author2=Romero, Lisa|title="Citizenship for the College Girl": Challenges and Opportunities in Higher Education for Women in the United States in the 1930s|journal=Teachers College Record|year=2012|volume=114|issue=2|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the 1930s marked great economic hardship in the United States with the start of the [[Great Depression]]. At this point in history, a college major was expected to be a practical one. As difficult financial times neared, needing to justify college expenses became very real for women and their families. A study in 1924 that surveyed nearly sixteen-hundred woman PhD recipients concluded that seventy percent required grants, scholarships, and fellowships in order to cover the expense associated with earning a higher degree. Despite the financial support, the majority of these women were required to save money for years before pursuing their degrees because the aid was never enough. Despite these disadvantages, the 1930s marked the peak of woman PhD earners. These degrees varied in fields and began to legitimize fields for women that were once off-limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solomon|first1=Barabara|title=In the Company of Educated Women|date=1985|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven &amp; London|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "self-support" that these women engaged in to help finance their education became a widely accepted necessity. Both men and women were forced to find ways of supporting their education at this period of time. To help lessen the financial burden faced by families trying to educate their children, the [[National Youth Administration]] was created by the [[United States Government]]. Between 1935 and 1943, the NYA spent nearly 93 million dollars providing financial assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solomon|first1=Barbara|title=In the Company of Educated Women|date=195|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven &amp; London|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the growing increasing opportunities for women in education, there was a constant need to justify the expense. As the number of college graduates increased, those who were displaced during the [[Great Depression]] had to compete with a younger and more-educated group of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horowitz|first1=Helen|title=Alma Mater: Design and Experience in the Women's Colleges from Their Nineteenth-Century Beginnings to the 1930's|date=1984|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|location=Amherst, MA|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1930s also marked the 10th anniversary of [[Women's suffrage in the United States]]. Despite earning the right to vote, women were still largely refused any role in positions of political power that allow them to make political change for their gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deckard|first1=Barbara|title=The Women's Movement: Political, Socioeconomic. and Psychological Issues|date=1983|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=New York|page=228|edition= Third}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite growing numbers of women graduates, many were denied positions that they were qualified for in favor of men. This struggle sparked new examples of [[political activism]] and increased support for an [[Equal Rights Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGowan|first1=Josephine|title=A Decade of Women's Rights|journal=Commonwealth|date=February 11, 1931|page=403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Areas of study====

=== Women's colleges ===
{{main|Women's colleges in the United States}}

Prior to the [[American Civil War]] few colleges admitted women. Founded in 1772 as a primary school, [[Salem College]] is the oldest female educational establishment.

Some were founded as co-educational institutions; [[Oberlin College]], founded in 1833, was the first college to accept women and [[African American]]s as students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Faustine Childress Jones-Wilson|title=Encyclopedia of African-American Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ni2qhq1n1d4C&amp;pg=PA339|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood|pages=339–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early coeducational schools included Hillsdale College founded as Michigan Central College in Spring Arbor, Michigan in 1844,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = About/History - Hillsdale College|url = http://www.hillsdale.edu/about/history|website = www.hillsdale.edu|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Antioch College founded by noted educator Horace Mann in 1852 in Yellow Springs, Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Mission &amp; History {{!}} Antioch College|url = http://www.antiochcollege.org/about/mission_and_history.html|website = www.antiochcollege.org|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollins University, founded as Valley Union Seminary in Roanoke, Virginia, in 1842 as a co-educational institution but became all-female in 1952;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = History &amp; Mission {{!}} Hollins University|url = https://www.hollins.edu/who-we-are/history/|website = Hollins|access-date = 2016-02-07|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of colleges were founded before the Civil War with all-female student bodies, including (among others, in addition to Salem): Mount Holyoke College of South Hadley, Massachusetts, founded in 1837 by [[Mary Lyon]] as Mount Holyoke Female Seminary;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = History|url = https://www.mtholyoke.edu/about/history|website = Mount Holyoke College|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wesleyan College of Macon, Georgia, founded in 1839 as Georgia Female College, which claims to be "the first college in the world chartered to grant degrees to women";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = About Wesleyan|url = http://www.wesleyancollege.edu/about/index.cfm|website = www.wesleyancollege.edu|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Queens College (now Queens University) of Charlotte, North Carolina, founded in 1857 as Charlotte Female Institute;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = History of Queens {{!}} Queens University of Charlotte|url = http://www.queens.edu/About-Queens/Get-to-Know-Queens/History-of-Queens.html|website = www.queens.edu|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Averett College (now Averett University) of Danville, Virginia, founded in 1859 as Union women's College;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = History|url = http://www.averett.edu/about-us/office-of-the-president/history/|website = www.averett.edu|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Vassar College, founded in Poughkeepsie, New York in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maryann Bruno|author2=Elizabeth A. Daniels|title=Vassar College|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8bEfDUaq8HEC&amp;pg=PA7|year=2001|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the start of the war many males were in uniform so more opportunities arose for women to fill the empty space in schools and the universities became more willing to admit the women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/PLLI/webreprt.html Women's Colleges in the United States: History, Issues, and Challenges.] Irene Harwarth &amp; Mindi Maline. 5 Apr. 2009. U.S. Department of Education, Washington, D.C.. 5 Apr. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Slowly more educational institutions opened their doors to women; today, there are 60 women's colleges in the United States offering educational programs that parallel co-educational universities both in subject matter and in quality.

=== Government action===
In 1848 the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] was held in New York to gain support for education and suffrage  but it had little immediate impact. This convention is significant because it created a foundation for efforts toward equal education for women, even though it was not actually achieved until much later.&lt;ref name="Wood, J T. 2009" /&gt;

The [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]] of 1862 founded universities to educate both men and women in practical fields of study, though women's courses were still centered around home economics. By 1870 30% of colleges were co-educational, later in the 1930s women-only colleges were established that expanded opportunities for courses of study to include more intellectual development as opposed to domestic instruction.&lt;ref name="Wood, J T. 2009" /&gt;

In July 1975 “[[Title IX]] regulations became effective as law” (Margaret Fund of NWLC, 2012).  The law provided one year for compliance to elementary schools and three years for compliance to high schools and post secondary institutions.   Through the 1970s the law’s enactment, opposition towards the legislation, and initial compliance for the law were the focus.  According to the Margaret Fund (2012), in 1982 a court case was won upholding the nondiscriminatory acts in employment, the case title is as follows, 1982 North Haven Bd. of Ed. v. Bell, 456 U.S. 512 (1982).  In 1984, the case Grove City v. Bell, 465 U.S. 555 (1984) a, “U.S. Supreme Court decision held that federal spending clause statutes only apply to those programs or activities that receive direct federal financial assistance, effectively ending Title IX applicability to athletics” (Margaret Fund of NWLC).  This decision is later remedied in the late 80’s by the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987.  In 1988, this act was passed by Congress and reversed the damage from the Grove City v. Bell decision.  The Margaret Fund (2012) states, “It over-rode the Grove City v. Bell decision by expanding the definition of program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance” (Margaret Fund of NWLC, para.5).  During the 1990s three significant changes or continuations to the law were made in the course of the decade.  First, a Supreme Court decision allowed an individual to sue for monetary retributions by citing the Title IX Act.  Second, the disclosure act in 1994 stated that all institutions under Title IX were to report publicly on their operations, with an effective implementation date set for 1996.  Third, the ORC distributed requirements to institutions and schools which are explained and outlined more clearly the regulations for Title IX.  The significant events in the 2000s allow schools to use e-mail surveys, and due to a Supreme Court case in 2009, lawsuits on the basis of sexual discrimination under Title IX can be brought by parents.

Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 19 Nov. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The case reached the Supreme Court when [[Grove City College]] disagreed with the Department of Education's assertion that it was required to comply with Title&amp;nbsp;IX. Grove City College was not a federally funded institution; however, they did accept students who were receiving [[Basic Educational Opportunity Grant]]s through a Department of Education program.&lt;ref name="oyez"/&gt; The Department of Education's stance was that, because some of its students were receiving federal grants, the school was receiving federal assistance and Title&amp;nbsp;IX applied to it. The Court decided that since Grove City College was only receiving federal funding through the grant program, only that program had to be in compliance. The ruling was a major victory for those opposed to Title&amp;nbsp;IX, as it made many institutions' sports programs outside of the rule of Title&amp;nbsp;IX and, thus, reduced the scope of Title&amp;nbsp;IX.&lt;ref name="Suggs"&gt;Suggs, Welsh.

== Education ==
{{Main|Education in Chad}}
Despite the government's efforts, overall educational levels remained low at the end of the first decade of independence. In 1971 about 99 percent of women over the age of fifteen could not read, write, or speak French, which at the time was the only official national language; [[literacy]] in Arabic stood at 7.8 percent. In 1982 the overall literacy rate stood at about 15 percent.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/tdtoc.html Chad country study]. ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Major problems have hindered the development of Chadian education since independence. Financing for education has been very limited. Limited facilities and personnel also have made it difficult for the education system to provide adequate instruction. Overcrowding is a major problem; some classes have up 100 students, many of whom are repeaters. In the years just after independence, many primary-school teachers had only marginal qualifications. On the secondary level, the situation was even worse.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/tdtoc.html Chad country study]. ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, 39.6 percent of children ages 5 to 14 years were attending school. Educational opportunities for girls are limited, mainly due to cultural traditions. Fewer girls enroll in secondary school than boys, primarily due to early marriage. In 1999, 54.0 percent of children starting primary school reached grade 5.&lt;ref name=ilab&gt;"Chad".

=== Human trafficking ===
{{Main|Human trafficking in Chad}}
Chad is a source and destination country for children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically conditions of forced labor and forced [[prostitution]]. The country’s trafficking problem is primarily internal and frequently involves parents entrusting children to relatives or intermediaries in return for promises of education, apprenticeship, goods, or money; selling or bartering children into involuntary domestic servitude or herding is used as a means of survival by families seeking to reduce the number of mouths to feed.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Chad". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142759.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underage Chadian girls travel to larger towns in search of work, where some are subsequently subjected to prostitution. Some girls are compelled to marry against their will, only to be forced by their husbands into involuntary domestic servitude or agricultural labor. In past reporting periods, traffickers transported children from Cameroon and the CAR to Chad’s oil producing regions for commercial sexual exploitation; it is unknown whether this practice persisted in 2009.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Chad".

===Female genital mutilation===
{{See|Prevalence of female genital mutilation by country}}

60 percent of Chadian women had been subject to [[female genital mutilation]] in 1995. The procedure is a traditional rite of passage as a girl moves into adulthood and it is followed regardless of religious orientation. It is equally common amongst Muslims, Christians and [[animist]]s. Those who attain adulthood without being mutilated generally avoid it for life.&lt;ref name="USDoS-20010601"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asylumlaw.org/docs/chad/usdos01_fgm_Chad.pdf|title=Chad: Report on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) or Female Genital Cutting (FGC)|date=1 June 2001|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 80 percent of the girls in Chad who suffered genital mutilation had been cut between the age of 5 and 14.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013pp47,183&gt;{{cite book|title=Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: A statistical overview and exploration of the dynamics of change|url=http://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FGMC_Lo_res_Final_26.pdf|publisher=UNICEF|location=New York|date=2013|ref=harv}}, 47, 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polygamy]] is legal in Chad, and it is estimated that over a third of women live in polygamous [[marriages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genderindex.org/country/chad|title=Chad|publisher=Social Institutions and Gender Index}}&lt;/ref&gt;
