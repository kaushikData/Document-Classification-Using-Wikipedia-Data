      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2780">'''Ate-u-Tiv''' (sometimes written as  "Ate u Tiv" and less popularly known as "Tsun") is a traditional architectural masterpiece of the [[Tiv people|Tiv People]] of the Middle-belt Region of [[Nigeria]] in [[West Africa]].

The word "Atē" stands for the round, open hut; while "Átē-ŭ-Tiv" attributes it to the [[Tiv people]]. The Ate-u-Tiv  serves as a relaxation and reception point for "vanya" (guests) and allows "mbamaren, ônov man angbianev" (family members) to "tema imiôngo" (chat), sharing ideas and telling stories. The "Orya" (family head) receives guests and attend to family issues (discussions) from the "Ate".

To construct a traditional Ate-u-Tiv, you will require a minimum of six poles called "mtôm" which are y-shaped at the top; these serve as the pillars. The total number of poles required will however depend on the diameter of the Ate to be constructed. These are erected upright into the ground in a circle with equal spacing between poles.  Next is "ukyaver" which comprise stems of slim climbing plants.  These are used in constructing a sort of lintel to hold the roof.

The roof of an "Ate-u-Tiv" comprise "ihyange" (paulins) and "ihila" (grass).  The ihyange are woven together in a cone-shape with ukyaver holding together the rafters.  The completed structure is then hoisted unto the [[Column|pillars]]/[[lintel]] with the coned-top upright. Ihila, having been woven together, is then used to provide a thick-layered roofing. This roof filters incoming air making it cool and clean and at the same time stopping the rains.

The [[Tiv people]] are well known for their hospitality and the "Ate-u-Tiv" is an important component of this hospitality. In order to readily receive visitors, each compound builds an "Ate" which is furnished with chairs made from wood, canes, etc.  In modern days, the components of the "Ate" may vary. Some roofs are now a combination of iron roofing sheets covered by grass that may not necessarily be "ihila"; paulins are regularly made of [[plywood]], etc. The "Ate" design now adorns public places such as hotel gardens, public amusement parks, zoos, museums, etc. New usage of the term "Ate-u-Tiv" may refer to a meeting place, social network or forum.

Like [[Tiv people|Tiv]] [[music]], modernization has not changed Tiv [[architecture]], particularly the design and usage of the "Ate-u-Tiv". Ate-u-Tiv has remained a symbol of Tiv hospitality.

The '''Australian Labor Party split of 1955''' was a split within the [[Australian Labor Party]] along [[ethnocultural]] lines and about the position towards [[communism]]. 
Key players in the split were the federal [[opposition leader]] [[H. V. Evatt|H. V. "Doc" Evatt]] and [[B. A. Santamaria]], the dominant force behind the "Catholic Social Studies Movement" or "the Movement".

The first split occurred in 1916 over conscription in World War I; the second in 1931 over the Premiers' Plan for economic recovery in the Great Depression; and the third in 1955 over alleged communist infiltration of the trade union movement. The last was the worst of the three, because the party has not yet healed the wounds that resulted from it. [[File:cquote2.png|20px]]

Evatt denounced the influence of Santamaria's Movement on 5 October 1954, about 4 months after the [[Australian federal election, 1954|1954 federal election]]. The Victorian ALP state executive was officially dissolved, but both factions sent delegates to the 1955 Labor Party conference in Hobart. Movement delegates were excluded from the conference. They withdrew from the Labor party, going on to form the [[Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist)]] which in 1957 became the [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]]. The split then moved from federal level to states, predominantly [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Queensland]].

Historians, journalists, and political scientists have observed that the split was not a single event but a process that occurred over the early 1950s in state and federal Labor parties. The conservative [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] and staunchly anti-Labor Democratic Labor Party has used Australia's full-preference [[instant-runoff voting]] system to direct its preferences to benefit the Coalition [[two-party-preferred vote]] and was successful until 1972 in preventing the election of an Australian Labor Party federal government.

==Background==
In the late 1930s and early 1940s, there was an effort by the [[Communist Party of Australia]] to infiltrate [[trade union]]s in Australia.&lt;ref name="FWCheshire_1970_RobertMurray_TheSplit"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Robert|title=The Split: Australian labor in the fifties|edition=First|year=1970|publisher=[[F.

In [[Melbourne]] in the 1930s, a group of the city's Catholics, predominantly lawyers, formed "The Campion Society" and published "[[The Catholic Worker]]". [[B. A.

&lt;/ref&gt; became its editor. Australian Catholic bishops in 1937 established a National Secretariat for Catholic Action, and in 1939, Santamaria set up the National Catholic Rural Movement to promote conservative Catholic values among Catholic farmers.&lt;ref&gt;http://newsweekly.com.au/article.php?id=411&lt;/ref&gt; The NCRM claimed by the mid-1940s branches in all states except Tasmania, and a membership of over 5000. The NCRM promoted its objectives through and within other rural organisations and also politically. By 1941 Santamaria had also set up the "Catholic Social Studies Movement", commonly known as the "Movement".&lt;ref name=ANU_AustralianDictionaryofBiographyOnline_JohnCain&gt;

==Showdown==
At the [[Australian federal election, 1954|1954 federal election]], held in May, Labor received over 50% of the popular vote and won 57 seats (up 5) to the Coalition's 64. In September 1954, journalist [[Alan Reid (journalist)|Alan Reid]] published an [[exposé (journalism)|exposé]] in ''The Sydney Sun'' about Santamaria. He wrote of him that: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"In the tense melodrama of politics there are mysterious figures who stand virtually unnoticed in the wings, invisible to all but a few of the audience, as they cue, Svengali-like, among the actors out on the stage."&lt;ref name="nla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/pub/nlanews/2006/jul06/story-3.pdf|title=The Ultimate Insider|first=Stephen|last=Holt|publisher=National Library Australia News|date=July 2006|volume=16|issue=10|accessdate=3 November 2010|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bcarr"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/australia/6163653/sleeping-with-the-enemy/|title=Sleeping with the Enemy|first=Bob|last=Carr|authorlink=Bob Carr|work=[[The Spectator]]|date=17 July 2010|accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 5 October 1954 in a [[Press release]], [[H.V. Evatt|Dr H. V. Evatt]] blamed Labor's loss of seats and defeat in the 1954 federal election on "a small minority of members, located particularly in the State of Victoria", which were in conspiracy to undermine him.&lt;ref name="A&amp;U_2001_TrueBelieivers_ch7"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scalmer|first=Sean|editor=[[John Faulkner]] and [[Stuart Macintyre]]|title=True Believers: The Story of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party|year=2001|publisher=[[Allen &amp; Unwin]]|location=[[Crows Nest, New South Wales]]|isbn=1-86508-609-6|pages=90–91|chapter=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OPH_Exhibitions_PetrovAffair_TheSplit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moadoph.gov.au/exhibitions/online/petrov/content-44328.html|title=Old Parliament House – The Split|publisher=[[Museum of Australian Democracy]]|accessdate=14 October 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903182314/http://moadoph.gov.au/exhibitions/online/petrov/content-44328.html|archivedate=3 September 2010|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evatt blamed Santamaria and his supporters in the Victorian Labor Party, called "the Groupers" . Santamaria exercised strong influence in the Cain government through "Movement" linked ministers such as [[Bill Barry (politician)|Bill Barry]], [[Frank Scully (politician)|Frank Scully]] and [[Les Coleman (politician)|Les Coleman]]. Protestant and left-wing ministers strongly opposed the Movement faction.

On 31 October 1954, the ''[[The Sun-Herald|Sydney Sun-Herald]]'' reported on a letter sent by the Victorian Minister for Lands, [[Robert Holt]], to the federal secretary of the Australian Labor Party, J. Schmella, which the paper described as 'probably as explosive, politically, as any document in Australia'.&lt;ref name="SunHerOct1954"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12643283|title=EXPLOSIVE LETTER ON SANTAMARIA LABOUR MOVEMENT ABUSED. SAYS M.L.A.|newspaper=[[The Sun-Herald]]|location=Sydney|date=31 October 1954|accessdate=13 August 2013|page=5|publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holt stated -
:"My charge is that the Victorian branch is controlled and directed in the main by one group or section through Mr. B. Santamaria ... My criticism is not personal. It is leveled against those ideas which are contrary to what I believe Labor policy to be. Moreover, I have been requested by my numerous and trusted friends, who happen to be Catholic, to fight against the influence of Mr. Santamaria and those he represents, when he seeks to implement his ideas through an abuse of a political movement, designed to serve a truly political purpose."&lt;ref name="SunHerOct1954"/&gt;

Holt spoke of events the previous year and describes attending a meeting of Santamaria's National Catholic Rural Movement Convention, following which he was, as Minister of Lands, approached by Santamaria and [[Frank Scully (politician)|Frank Scully]], where he was asked to use his position to make Crown land available to "Italians with foreign capital". When he refused, "Santamaria stated that I might not be in the next parliament", and Scully agreed. Holt considered this 'a direct threat' which was confirmed when another M.L.A. confided that there was 'pressure' to oppose him for party selection for his seat. He added that "subsequent events which happened during the selection ballot' had convinced him that the ALP's 'Victorian branch is not free to implement Labor policy and connives with this method."&lt;ref name="SunHerOct1954"/&gt; He concluded by stating his belief in:&lt;blockquote&gt;'a party machine which permits the true expression of opinion of its members, regardless of who or what they may be. The only requirement is loyalty to Labor ideals and principles. This is not possible in the present circumstances...'&lt;ref name="SunHerOct1954"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Holt introduced the Land Bill without Santamaria's desired advantage and it was at first amended by another ALP member, then defeated, amended again and passed – with what Santamaria wanted – after two Liberal party members "switched sides".&lt;ref name="SunHerOct1954"/&gt; In December 1954, Santamaria launched a suit again Holt for [[libel]], citing the letter published in-full by the ''Sun-Herald''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article96382404|title=SANTAMARIA SEEKS LIBEL DAMAGES.|newspaper=[[The Examiner (Tasmania)|The Examiner]]|location=Launceston, Tas.|date=14 December 1954|accessdate=13 August 2013|page=1|publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The libel action was withdrawn, without explanation, in April 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71879889|title=Santamaria ends action.|newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]|location=Melbourne|date=1 April 1955|page=9|publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Victoria, Dr Mannix strongly supported Santamaria, but in [[New South Wales]], [[Norman Cardinal Gilroy]], the first Australian-born Roman Catholic prelate, opposed him, favouring the traditional alliance between the Church and Labor. Gilroy's influence in Rome helped to end official Church support for the Groupers. In January 1955, Santamaria used Dr Mannix as his witness to the statement, "There is no Catholic organisation seeking to dominate the Labor Party or any other political party ... So that there will be no equivocation, Catholics are not associated with any other secular body seeking to dominate the Labor Party or any other political party."&lt;ref name="ArgusJan1955"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71692302|title=A.W.U. chief's 'movement' charge "UNTRUE", REPLIES Mr. SANTAMARIA.|newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]|location=Melbourne|date=29 January 1955|accessdate=13 August 2013|page=5|publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santamaria made this statement when he denied charges from the general secretary of the Australian Workers' Union (Mr T Dougherty) that the "No. 2 man in the Victorian ALP" (Frank McManus), the "No. 2 man in the NSW Labor Party" (J. Kane) and the "secretary of the Australian Rules Football Association of Queensland" (Mr Polgrain) were Santamaria's "top lieutenants in ''The Movement''". For his part, McManus suggested that Dougherty "appeared to have contracted an ailment from one of his political colleagues ... the chief symptom of this ailment was that the sufferer believed he was always detecting conspiracy theories".&lt;ref name="ArgusJan1955"/&gt;

In early 1955 the Labor Party's [[Australian Labor Party National Executive|Federal executive]] dissolved the Victorian state executive and appointed a new executive in its place. Both executives sent delegates to the 1955 National Conference in [[Hobart]], where the delegates from the old executive were excluded from the conference. The Victorian branch then split between pro-Evatt and pro-Santamaria factions, and in March the pro-Evatt state executive suspended 24 members of state Parliament suspected of being Santamaria supporters. (Santamaria was not a party member.) Four ministers were forced to resign from [[John Cain (senior)|John Cain]]'s Labor government. Four unions were also disaffiliated from the ALP after the split.&lt;ref name="ALP83"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article127004771|title=Bitter debate ALP vote keeps union out. |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=24 June 1984 |accessdate=21 September 2013|page=1|publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unions were the 'right-wing' [[Federated Clerks Union]], the [[Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association]], the [[Federated Ironworkers' Association of Australia]] and the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners.

On the night of 19 April 1955, [[Henry Bolte]] raised a [[motion of no-confidence]] against Cain's government in the Legislative Assembly. After twelve hours of debate on the motion, in the early hours of 20 April, 11 of the expelled Labor members  [[Crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] to support Bolte's motion. With his government defeated, Cain sought and received a dissolution of parliament later that day.&lt;ref name=noconf&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article75437726 |title=Victorian Govt. Defeated; Election On May 28. |newspaper=[[The Central Queensland Herald]] |location=Rockhampton, Qld. |date=21 April 1955 |accessdate=10 April 2012 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainsley Symons (2012), 'Democratic Labor Party members in the Victorian Parliament of 1955-1958,' in ''Recorder'' (Australian Society for the Study of Labour History, Melbourne Branch) No. 275, November, Pages 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral repercussions==
At the ensuing [[Victorian state election, 1955|May 1955 Victorian state election]], the expelled members and others stood as the [[Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist)]]. It drew 12.6% of the vote, mainly from the ALP, but because its vote was widely spread only one of its candidates, the expelled Labor member Frank Scully, was re-elected. The party directed its 12.6% vote to the Coalition, and most of its supporters followed the party's preferences. Labor won 37.6% of the vote and 20 seats to the Liberals' 34 and the Country Party's ten.

The Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist) went on in 1957 to be the nucleus of the [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]].&lt;ref name="OPH_Exhibitions_PetrovAffair_TheSplit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Wendy Lewis]], Simon Balderstone and John Bowan | title=Events That Shaped Australia | pages=201–206 | publisher=New Holland | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-74110-492-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Victorian state election, 1958|1958 Victorian state election]], similar tactics were used. The DLP won 14.4% of the vote but even Scully lost his seat, and most of the preferences went to the Coalition. The ALP received 37.7% of the vote.

In [[New South Wales]], Labor leader and premier [[Joseph Cahill]] decisively won the [[New South Wales state election, 1953|1953 NSW election]]. He was desperate to keep the New South Wales branch united during the split. He achieved this by controlling the anti-DLP faction in his party. The DLP did not contest the [[New South Wales state election, 1956|1956 NSW election]] and Cahill was returned in the [[New South Wales state election, 1959|1959 NSW election]], but died in office later that year. He was succeeded as leader and premier by [[Robert Heffron]]. Heffron continued the Labor reign in New South Wales winning the [[New South Wales state election, 1962|1962 NSW election]]. Heffron resigned the leadership and premiership in 1964, and was succeeded by [[Jack Renshaw]], who lost the premiership at the [[New South Wales state election, 1965|1965 NSW election]] ending 24 years of Labor power in the state.

In [[Queensland]], Labor leader and premier [[Vince Gair]] since 1952 was expelled from the Labor party in 1957 because of his support of the Groupers.&lt;ref name="ANU_AustralianDictionaryofBiographyOnline_VincentGair"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A140269b.html|title=Gair, Vincent Clare (Vince)  (1901–1980) | work=Australian Dictionary of Biography Online|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gair had previously attempted to mobilise the [[Industrial Groups]] to counteract a perceived communist influence of the [[Australian Workers' Union]] in the [[Queensland Trades and Labor Council]].  With other Queensland caucus members, Gair went on to form the [[Queensland Labor Party]].  As happened two years earlier in Victoria, the split destroyed the Labor government; Gair was defeated on a no-confidence motion, and in the resulting election the two wings of Labor were reduced to only 31 seats between them.  Labor would remain in opposition until 1989.  Gair's QLP was absorbed into the [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|DLP]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="ANU_AustralianDictionaryofBiographyOnline_VincentGair"/&gt;

==Long-term consequences==

===Directing preferences to the Liberals===
From the 1955 election until the demise of the party, the DLP directed its supporters to give their electoral preferences to the Liberals, ahead of the ALP. Santamaria intended to keep Labor from winning government until it accepted his terms for reunification. On two occasions—[[Australian federal election, 1961|1961]] and [[Australian federal election, 1969|1969]]—Labor actually won a majority of the two-party vote, but DLP preferences resulted in Labor coming up just short of ending the Coalition's hold on government.

==Re-affiliation of unions==
The first of four unions disaffiliated after the split of 1955, attempted to return at the ALP Victorian State Conference in 1983.&lt;ref name="ALP83"/&gt; The Federated Clerks and three others similarly aligned 'right-wing' unions – the [[Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association]], the [[Federated Ironworkers' Association of Australia]] and the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners – had their re-affiliation cases considered by a special Victorian ALP committee of ten which split on the decision 5 against 5 and had submitted separate reports to the State Conference. The Federated Clerks' case, 'after a bitter and at times acrimonious 3 and a 1/2 hour debate', which was 'centered on alleged links' with Santamaria, the National Civic Council, and the Industrial Action Fund, was defeated at the State Conference by 289 votes to 189.&lt;ref name="ALP83"/&gt; It was noted in a news report of the time that all four were likely to appeal to the federal ALP executive and that they had the support of then [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Bob Hawke]].&lt;ref name="ALP83"/&gt; The ALP federal executive supported the re-affiliation before the 1985 Victorian State Conference &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article122504280|title=The Canberra Times.|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=20 March 1985|accessdate=21 September 2013|page=2|publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; while two of the unions were refused re-affiliation in the Northern Territory later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article127007434|title=Unions refused affiliation.|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=5 May 1985|accessdate=21 September 2013|page=1|publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, all four returned as ALP affiliated unions in some form; the Federated Clerks' Union amalgamated into the affiliated [[Australian Services Union]] in 1993, the [[Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association]] is a current ALP affiliated union, while the [[Federated Ironworkers' Association of Australia]] and the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners amalgamated with the affiliated [[Australian Workers' Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfmeuvic.com.au/your-union/our-proud-past |title=Our Proud Past – A Brief History |accessdate=20 September 2013 |publisher=CFMEU Construction |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055154/http://www.cfmeuvic.com.au/your-union/our-proud-past |archivedate=21 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles André Joseph Marie de Gaulle''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃaʁl də ɡol|lang|fr-Charles de Gaulle.ogg}};&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wells|first=John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|isbn=9781405881180}}&lt;/ref&gt; 22 November 1890 – 9 November 1970) was a French army officer and statesman who led the [[French Resistance]] against [[Nazi Germany]] in [[World War II]] and chaired the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] from 1944 to 1946 in order to reestablish democracy in [[France]]. In 1958, he came out of retirement when appointed President of the Council of Ministers by President [[René Coty]]. He was asked to rewrite the [[Constitution of France]] and founded the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] after approval by referendum. He was elected [[President of France]] later that year, a position he was reelected to in 1965 and held until his resignation in 1969. &lt;!-- He twice served as ''[[ex officio]]'' [[Co-Prince of Andorra]]. --&gt; He was the dominant figure of France during the [[Cold War]] era, and his memory continues to influence French politics.

Born in [[Lille]], he graduated from [[École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]] in 1912. He was a decorated officer of the [[World War I|First World War]], wounded several times, and later taken prisoner at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]]. During the interwar period, he advocated mobile armoured divisions. During the German invasion of May 1940, he led an armoured division which counterattacked the invaders; he was then appointed Undersecretary for War. Refusing to accept his government's [[Second Armistice at Compiègne|armistice with Germany]], De Gaulle exhorted the French population to resist occupation and to continue the fight in his [[Appeal of 18 June]]. He led a [[French Committee of National Liberation|government in exile]] and the [[Free French Forces]] against the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. Despite frosty relations with the United Kingdom and especially the United States, he emerged as the undisputed leader of the [[French Resistance]]. He became head of the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] in June 1944, the interim government of France following [[Liberation of France|its Liberation]]. As early as 1944, De Gaulle introduced a [[Dirigisme|dirigiste]] economic policy, which included substantial state-directed control over a capitalist economy which was followed by 30 years of unprecedented growth, known as the [[Trente Glorieuses]].

Frustrated by the return of petty partisanship in the new [[Fourth French Republic|Fourth Republic]], he resigned in early 1946 but continued to be politically active as founder of the [[Rassemblement du Peuple Français]] (RPF; "Rally of the French People"). He retired in the early 1950s and wrote a book about his experience in the war titled ''War Memoirs'', which quickly became a staple of modern French literature. When the [[Algerian War]] was ripping apart the unstable [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]], the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] brought him back to power during the [[May 1958 crisis (France)|May 1958 crisis]]. He founded the Fifth Republic with a strong presidency, and he was [[French presidential election, 1958|elected]] to continue in that role. He managed to keep France together while taking steps to end the war, much to the anger of the [[Pied-Noir|''Pieds-Noirs'']] (ethnic French born in Algeria) and the military; both previously had supported his return to power to maintain colonial rule. He granted independence to [[Algeria]] and progressively to other French colonies.

In the context of the Cold War, De Gaulle initiated his "politics of grandeur" asserting that France as a major power should not rely on other countries, such as the United States, for its national security and prosperity. To this end, he pursued a policy of "national independence" which led him to withdraw from [[NATO]]'s military integrated command and to launch an independent [[Force de dissuasion|nuclear development program]] that made France the [[France and weapons of mass destruction|fourth nuclear power]]. He restored cordial [[Franco-German relations]] to create a European counterweight between the Anglo-American and Soviet spheres of influence through the signing of the [[Élysée Treaty]] on 22 January 1963. However, he opposed any development of a [[Supranational union|supranational Europe]], favouring a Europe of [[Sovereign nation|sovereign nations]]. De Gaulle openly criticised the [[Vietnam War|United States intervention in Vietnam]] and the "[[exorbitant privilege]]" of the United States dollar. In his later years, his support for the slogan "''[[Vive le Québec libre]]''" and his two vetoes of Britain's entry into the [[European Economic Community]] generated considerable controversy.
 
Although [[French presidential election, 1965|reelected President in 1965]], he appeared likely to lose power amid widespread protests by students and workers in [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968]], but survived the crisis and won an [[French legislative election, 1968|election]] with an increased majority in the National Assembly. De Gaulle resigned in 1969 after losing a [[French constitutional referendum, 1969|referendum]] in which he proposed more decentralisation. He died a year later at his residence in [[Colombey-les-Deux-Églises]], leaving his presidential memoirs unfinished. Many French political parties and figures claim a [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] legacy; several streets and monuments in France were dedicated to his memory after his death.

==Early life==
===Childhood and origins===
[[File:Maison natale de Charles de Gaulle, Lille.jpg|thumb|right|De Gaulle's birth house in [[Lille]], now a national museum]]
De Gaulle was born in the industrial region of [[Lille]] in the [[Nord (French department)|Nord department]], the third of five children. He was raised in a devoutly Catholic and traditional family. His father, [[Henri de Gaulle]], was a professor of history and literature at a [[Jesuit]] college who eventually founded his own school.&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fenby|first1=Jonathan|title=The General: Charles De Gaulle And The France He Saved|date=2010|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=1847373925|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8467526-the-general|accessdate=19 November 2017}}{{RP|42-47}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Henri de Gaulle came from a long line of parliamentary gentry from [[Normandy]] and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]].&lt;ref name="Crawley-1969"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crawley|first1=Aidan|title=De Gaulle: A Biography|date=1969|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill Co.|url=https://books.google.co.th/books/about/De_Gaulle.html?id=WBogAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|isbn=0002111616|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|13-16}}&lt;ref name="Ledwidge p. 6"&gt;Ledwidge p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The name is thought to be [[Flemish]] in origin, and may well derive from ''van der Waulle'' ("from the rampart").&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010"/&gt;{{RP|42}} De Gaulle's mother, Jeanne (née Maillot), descended from a family of wealthy entrepreneurs from Lille. She had French, Irish, Scottish, Flemish, and German ancestry.&lt;ref name="Crawley-1969"/&gt;{{RP|13–16}}&lt;ref name="Ledwidge p. 6"/&gt;

As part of the French nobility, the de Gaulle family had lost most of its land in the [[French Revolution]], which it opposed.&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010"/&gt;{{RP|41}} 

De Gaulle's father encouraged historical and philosophical debate between his children at mealtimes, and through his encouragement, de Gaulle grew familiar with French history from an early age. Struck by his mother's tale of how she cried as a child when she heard of the French capitulation to the Germans at [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Sedan in 1870]], he developed a keen interest in military strategy. He was also influenced by his uncle, also named [[Charles de Gaulle (poet)|Charles de Gaulle]], who was a historian and passionate [[Celticist]] who wrote books and pamphlets advocating the union of the Welsh, Scots, Irish, and [[Bretons]] into one people. His grandfather Julien-Philippe was also a historian, and his grandmother Josephine-Marie wrote poems which impassioned his Christian faith.&lt;ref name="Schoenbrun"&gt;David Schoenbrun, ''The Three Lives of Charles de Gaulle'' (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010"/&gt;{{RP|42–47}}

===Education and intellectual influences===
By the time he was ten he was reading medieval history. De Gaulle began writing in his early teens, especially poetry, and later his family paid for a composition, a one-act play in verse about a traveller, to be privately published.&lt;ref name="Pedley"/&gt; A voracious reader, he favored philosophical tomes by such writers as [[Henri Bergson|Bergson]], [[Charles Péguy|Péguy]], and [[Maurice Barrès|Barrès]]. In addition to the German philosophers [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], he read the works of the ancient Greeks (especially [[Plato]]) and the prose of the romanticist poet [[François-René de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]].&lt;ref name="Pedley"&gt;Alan Pedley (1996) ''As Mighty as the Sword: A Study of the Writings of Charles de Gaulle''. pp. 170–72. Intellect Books; {{ISBN|978-0950259536}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle was educated in Paris at the [[Collège Stanislas de Paris|Collège Stanislas]] and studied briefly in Belgium where he continued to display his interest in reading and studying history and shared the great pride many of his countrymen felt in their nation's achievements.&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;{{RP|51–53}} At the age of fifteen he wrote an essay imagining "General de Gaulle" leading the French Army to victory over Germany in 1930; he later wrote that in his youth he had looked forward with somewhat naive anticipation to the inevitable future war with Germany to avenge the French defeat of 1870.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p13"&gt;Lacouture 1991, p13&lt;/ref&gt;

France during de Gaulle's teenage years was a divided society, with many developments which were unwelcome to the de Gaulle family: the growth of socialism and syndicalism, the legal separation of Church and State in 1905, and the reduction in the term of military service to two years in the same year. Equally unwelcome were the ''[[Entente Cordiale]]'' with Britain, the [[First Moroccan Crisis]], and above all the [[Dreyfus Affair]]. Henri de Gaulle came to be a supporter of Dreyfus, but was less concerned with his innocence ''per se'' than with the disgrace which the army had brought onto itself. The same period also saw a resurgence in evangelical Catholicism, the dedication of the [[Sacré-Cœur, Paris]] and the rise of the cult of [[Joan of Arc]].&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;{{RP|50–51}}&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p13"/&gt;

De Gaulle was not an outstanding pupil until his mid-teens, but from July 1906 he worked harder at school as he focused on winning a place to train as an army officer at the military academy, [[École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]].&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, pp9-10"&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp9-10&lt;/ref&gt; Lacouture suggests that de Gaulle joined the army, despite being by inclination more suited to a career as a writer and historian, partly to please his father and partly because it was one of the few unifying forces which represented the whole of French society.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, pp14-15"&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp14-15&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote that "when I entered the Army, it was one of the greatest things in the world",&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;{{RP|51}} a claim which Lacouture points out needs to be treated with caution: the army's reputation was at a low ebb in the early 1900s after the Dreyfus Affair. It was used extensively for strike-breaking and there were fewer than 700 applicants for St Cyr in 1908, down from 2,000 at the turn of the century.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, pp14-15"/&gt;

==Early career==
===Officer cadet and lieutenant===
De Gaulle won a place at St Cyr in 1909. His class ranking was mediocre (119th out of 221 entrants), but he was relatively young and this was his first attempt at the exam.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, pp9-10"/&gt; Under a law of 21 March 1905, aspiring army officers were required to serve a year in the ranks, including time both as a private and as an [[non-commissioned officer|NCO]], before attending the academy. Accordingly, in October 1909, de Gaulle enlisted (for four years, as required, rather than the normal two year term for [[Conscription in France|conscripts]]) in the 33rd Infantry Regiment of the [[French Army]], based at Arras.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p16-17"&gt;Lacouture 1991, p16-17&lt;/ref&gt; This was a historic regiment with [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]], and [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]] amongst its battle honours.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p16&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1910 he was promoted to corporal. His company commander declined to promote him to sergeant, the usual rank for a potential officer, commenting that the young man clearly felt that nothing less than [[Constable of France]] would be good enough for him.&lt;ref&gt;Fenby writes that he did promote him to sergeant at this point, which does not tally with Lacouture and other more detailed accounts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p16-17"/&gt; He was eventually promoted to sergeant in September 1910.&lt;ref name="charles-de-gaulle.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/dossiers-thematiques/1890-1940-la-genese/la-grande-guerre/reperes/chronologie-1909-1918.php|title=Chronologie 1909–1918|publisher=charles-de-gaulle.org|accessdate=14 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307082919/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/dossiers-thematiques/1890-1940-la-genese/la-grande-guerre/reperes/chronologie-1909-1918.php|archivedate=7 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle took up his place at St Cyr in October 1910. By the end of his first year he had risen to 45th place.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p19&lt;/ref&gt; At St Cyr, de Gaulle acquired the nickname of "the great asparagus" because of his height (196&amp;nbsp;cm, 6'5"), high forehead, and nose.&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;{{RP|301}} He did well at the academy and received praise for his conduct, manners, intelligence, character, military spirit, and resistance to fatigue. In 1912, he graduated 13th in his class&lt;ref&gt;http://spartacus-educational.com/2WWdegaulle.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and his passing-out report noted that he was a gifted cadet who would undoubtedly make an excellent officer. The future Marshal [[Alphonse Juin]] passed out first in the class, although the two do not appear to have been close friends at the time.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p21"&gt;Lacouture 1991, p21&lt;/ref&gt;

Preferring to serve in France rather than the distant overseas colonies, in October 1912 he rejoined the 33rd Infantry Regiment as a ''[[Ranks in the French Army#Sous-lieutenant|sous-lieutenant]]'' (second lieutenant). The regiment was now commanded by Colonel (and future Marshal) [[Philippe Pétain]], whom de Gaulle would follow for the next 15 years. He later wrote in his memoirs: "My first colonel, Pétain, taught me the art of command".{{r|time19590105}}&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p21"/&gt;

It has been claimed that in the build-up to [[World War I]], de Gaulle agreed with Pétain about the obsolescence of cavalry and of traditional tactics in the age of machine guns and barbed wire, and often debated great battles and the likely outcome of any coming war with his superior.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun/&gt; Lacouture is sceptical, pointing out that although Pétain wrote glowing appraisals of de Gaulle in the first two quarters of 1913, it is unlikely that he stood out among the 19 captains and 32 lieutenants under his command. De Gaulle would have been present at the 1913 Arras maneouvres, at which Pétain criticised General Le Gallet to his face, but there is no evidence in his notebooks that he accepted Pétain's unfashionable ideas about the importance of firepower. De Gaulle stressed how [[Maurice de Saxe]] had banned volley fire, how French armies of the Napoleonic period had relied on infantry column attack, and how French military power had declined in the nineteenth century because of – supposedly – excessive concentration on firepower (e.g. the [[Chassepot rifle]]) rather than ''élan''. He also appears to have accepted the then fashionable lesson drawn from the recent [[Russo-Japanese War]], of how bayonet charges by Japanese infantry with high morale had succeeded in the face of enemy firepower.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p21-5&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle was promoted to first lieutenant in October 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p24-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===First World War===
====Combat====
[[File:CDG Pont Dinant.JPG|thumb|right|A plaque in [[Dinant]] commemorating the place where Charles de Gaulle, then an infantry lieutenant, was wounded  in 1914]]

When war finally broke out in France in early August 1914, the 33rd Regiment, considered one of the best fighting units in France, was immediately thrown into checking the German advance at [[Dinant]]. However, the [[French Fifth Army]] commander, General [[Charles Lanrezac]], remained wed to 19th-century battle tactics, throwing his units into pointless bayonet charges with bugles and full colours flying against the German artillery, incurring heavy losses.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;

As a platoon commander, de Gaulle was involved in fierce fighting from the outset. He received his baptism of fire 15 August and was among the first to be wounded, receiving a bullet in the knee at the [[Battle of Dinant (1914)|Battle of Dinant]].&lt;ref name="charles-de-gaulle.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;{{RP|58}} It is sometimes claimed that in hospital, he grew bitter at the tactics used, and spoke with other injured officers against the outdated methods of the French army. However, there is no contemporary evidence that he understood the importance of artillery in modern warfare. Instead, in his writing at the time, he criticised the "overrapid" offensive, the inadequacy of French generals, and the "slowness of the English troops".&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p31&lt;/ref&gt;

He rejoined his regiment in October, as commander of the 7th [[Company (military unit)|company]]. Many of his former comrades were already dead. In December he became regimental [[adjutant]].&lt;ref name="charles-de-gaulle.org"/&gt;

De Gaulle's unit gained recognition for repeatedly crawling out into [[no man's land]] to listen to the conversations of the enemy in their trenches, and the information brought back was so valuable that on 18 January 1915 he received the [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]]. On 10 February he was promoted to captain, initially on probation.&lt;ref name="charles-de-gaulle.org"/&gt; On 10 March 1915, de Gaulle received a bullet in the left hand, which initially seemed trivial but became infected.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p34&lt;/ref&gt; The wound incapacitated him for four months and later forced him to wear his wedding ring on the right hand.&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;{{RP|61}}&lt;ref name="charles-de-gaulle.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wIi-48RIaQC&amp;pg=PT71&amp;lpg=PT71&amp;dq=de+gaulle+alliance+main+droite&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7Pp84jzvbo&amp;sig=UU2cNkJHr6vIWgD3GY8TBpc3Bps&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_G7bVO3NJM_jao33gpgD&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=de%20gaulle%20alliance%20main%20droite&amp;f=false|title=Yvonne de Gaulle|work=google.fr|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August he commanded the 10th company before returning to duty as regimental adjutant. On 3 September 1915 his rank of captain became permanent. In late October, returning from leave, he returned to command of 10th company again.&lt;ref name="charles-de-gaulle.org"/&gt;

As a company commander at [[Douaumont]] (during the [[Battle of Verdun]]) on 2 March 1916, while leading a charge to try to break out of a position which had become surrounded by the enemy, he received a bayonet wound to the left thigh after being stunned by a shell and was captured after passing out from the effects of poison gas. He was one of the few survivors of his battalion.&lt;ref name="Jean Lacouture 1990 pp 42"&gt;Jean Lacouture, ''De Gaulle: The Rebel, 1890–1944'' (1990) pp 42–54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="charles-de-gaulle.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;{{RP|63}} He was pulled out of an empty shell crater by German soldiers and taken prisoner. The circumstances of his capture would later become a subject of debate as anti-Gaullists rumored that he had actually surrendered, a claim de Gaulle nonchalantly dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;The General: Charles de Gaulle and the France He Saved (Pg. 64)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prisoner====
De Gaulle spent 32 months in a German prisoner of war camp, where his treatment was satisfactory.&lt;ref name="Jean Lacouture 1990 pp 42"/&gt;

In captivity, de Gaulle read German newspapers (he had learned German at school and spent a summer vacation in Germany) and gave talks on his view of the course of the conflict to fellow prisoners. His patriotic fervor and confidence in victory earned him yet another nickname, ''Le Connétable'' ("[[Constable of France|The Constable]]"), the title of the mediaeval commander-in-chief of the French army.&lt;ref name="Ledwidge"&gt;Ledwidge p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; During his time as a POW, de Gaulle got to know well [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], the future commander of the [[Red Army]], whose [[deep operations|theories]] about a fast-moving, mechanized army closely resembled his. While a prisoner of war, de Gaulle wrote his first book, ''Discorde chez l'ennemi (The Enemy's House Divided)'', analysing the issues and divisions within the German forces. The book was published in 1924.&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;{{RP|83}}

De Gaulle made five unsuccessful escape attempts,&lt;ref name="charles-de-gaulle.org"/&gt; and was moved to a higher-security facility and punished on his return with long periods of solitary confinement and with the withdrawal of privileges such as newspapers and tobacco. He attempted escape by hiding in a laundry basket, digging a tunnel, digging a hole through a wall, and even posing as a nurse to fool his guards.&lt;ref&gt;The General: Charles de Gaulle and the France He Saved (Pg. 62–67)&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|time19590105}} In his letters to his parents, he constantly spoke of his frustration that the war was continuing without him, calling the situation "a shameful misfortune" and compared it to being [[cuckold]]ed. As the war neared its end, he grew depressed that he was playing no part in the victory, but despite his efforts, he remained in captivity until the [[Armistice with Germany|armistice]]. On 1 December 1918, three weeks later, he returned to his father's house in the [[Dordogne]] to be reunited with his three brothers, who had all served in the army and survived the war.

===Between the wars===
====Early 1920s: Poland and staff college====
After the armistice, de Gaulle served with the staff of the [[French Military Mission to Poland]] as an instructor of Poland's infantry during its [[Polish-Soviet War|war with communist Russia]] (1919–1921). He distinguished himself in operations near the [[Zbrucz|River Zbrucz]], with the rank of major in the Polish army, and won Poland's highest military decoration, the [[Virtuti Militari]].&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;{{RP|71–74}}

De Gaulle returned to France, where he became a lecturer in military history at St Cyr. He was already a powerful speaker, after practice as a prisoner of war.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p64&lt;/ref&gt; He then studied at the ''[[École de Guerre]]'' (staff college) from November 1922 to October 1924. Here he clashed with his instructor Colonel Moyrand by arguing for tactics based on circumstances rather than doctrine, and after an exercise in which he had played the role of commander, he refused to answer a question about supplies, replying ''"de minimis non curat praetor"'' ("a leader does not concern himself with trivia") before ordering the responsible officer to answer Moyrand. He obtained respectable, but not outstanding grades – 15 or so out of 20 – on many of his assessments. Moyrand wrote in his final report that he was "an intelligent, cultured and serious-minded officer; has brilliance and talent" but criticised him for not deriving as much benefit from the course as he should have done, and for his arrogance: his "excessive self-confidence", his harsh dismissal of the views of others "and his attitude of a King in exile". Having entered 33rd out of 129, he graduated in 52nd place, with a grade of ''assez bien'' ("good enough"). He was posted to [[Mainz]] to help supervise supplies of food and equipment for the [[Occupation of the Rhineland|French Army of Occupation]].&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp66-71, 213–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;{{RP|82}}

De Gaulle's book ''La Discorde chez l'ennemi'' had appeared in March 1924. In March 1925 he published an essay on the use of tactics according to circumstances, a deliberate gesture in defiance of Moyrand.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p71-2&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mid-1920s: ghostwriter for Pétain====
De Gaulle's career was saved by Marshal Pétain, who arranged for his staff college grade to be amended to ''bien'' ("good"—but not the "excellent" which would have been needed for a general staff posting).&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;{{RP|82–83}} From 1 July 1925 he worked for Pétain (as part of the ''Maison Pétain''), largely as a "pen officer" (ghostwriter).&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p77-86"&gt;Lacouture 1991, p77-86&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle disapproved of Pétain’s decision to take command in Morocco in 1925 (he was later known to remark that "Marshal Pétain was a great man. He died in 1925, but he did not know it") and of what he saw as the lust for public adulation of Pétain and his wife. In 1925 de Gaulle began to cultivate [[Joseph Paul-Boncour]], his first political patron.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p80&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 December 1925 he published an essay on the "Historical Role of French Fortresses". This was a popular topic because of the [[Maginot Line]] which was then being planned, but his argument was quite nuanced: he argued that the aim of fortresses should be to weaken the enemy, not to economise on defence.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p77-86"/&gt;

Friction arose between de Gaulle and Pétain over ''Le Soldat'', a history of the French soldier which he had ghost-written and for which he wanted greater writing credit. He had written mainly historical material, but Pétain wanted to add a final chapter of his own thoughts. There was at least one stormy meeting late in 1926 after which de Gaulle was seen to emerge, white with anger, from Pétain’s office.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p84-7"&gt;Lacouture 1991, p84-7&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1926 he returned to his duties with the Headquarters of the Army of the Rhine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/dossiers-thematiques/1890-1940-la-genese/un-officier-non-conformiste/reperes/chronologie-1921-1939.php|title=Chronologie 1921–1939|publisher=charles-de-gaulle.org|accessdate=14 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234832/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/dossiers-thematiques/1890-1940-la-genese/un-officier-non-conformiste/reperes/chronologie-1921-1939.php|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle had sworn that he would never return to the ''École de Guerre'' except as commandant, but at Pétain's invitation, and introduced to the stage by his patron, he delivered three lectures there in April 1927: "Leadership in Wartime", "Character", and "Prestige". These later formed the basis for his book ''The Edge of the Sword'' (1932). Many of the officers in the audience were his seniors, who had taught and examined him only a few years earlier.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p88"&gt;Lacouture 1991, p88&lt;/ref&gt;

====Late-1920s: Trier and Beirut====
After spending twelve years as a captain, a normal period, de Gaulle was promoted to ''[[Ranks in the French Army#Commandant|commandant]]'' (major) on 25 September 1927.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p88"/&gt; In November 1927 he began a two-year posting as commanding officer of the 19th ''[[Chasseur#Chasseurs à pied|chasseurs à pied]]'' (a [[battalion]] of élite light infantry) with the occupation forces at [[Trier]] (Treves).&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;{{RP|94}}

De Gaulle trained his men hard (a river crossing exercise of the freezing [[Moselle River]] at night was vetoed by his commanding general). He imprisoned a soldier for appealing to his deputy ([[member of parliament]]) for a transfer to a cushier unit, and when investigated initially tried to invoke his status as a member of the ''Maison Pétain'', eventually appealing to Pétain to protect himself from a reprimand for interfering with the soldier's political rights. An observer wrote of de Gaulle at this time that although he encouraged young officers, "his ego...glowed from far off". In the winter of 1928–1929, thirty soldiers ("not counting [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annamese]]") died from so-called "German flu", seven of them from de Gaulle's battalion. After an investigation, he was singled out for praise in the ensuing parliamentary debate as an exceptionally capable commanding officer, and mention of how he had worn a mourning band for a private soldier who was an orphan earned an exclamation of praise from the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Raymond Poincaré]].&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp90-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The breach between de Gaulle and Pétain over the ghost-writing of ''Le Soldat'' had deepened in 1928. Pétain brought in a new ghostwriter, Colonel Audet, who was unwilling to take on the job and wrote to de Gaulle in some embarrassment to take over the project. Pétain was quite friendly about the matter but did not publish the book.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp84-7, 213–5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929 Pétain did not use de Gaulle's draft text for his eulogy for the late [[Ferdinand Foch]], whose seat at the ''[[Academie Francaise]]'' he was assuming.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p84-7"/&gt;

The Allied occupation of the Rhineland was coming to an end, and de Gaulle's battalion was due to be disbanded, although the decision was later rescinded after he had moved to his next posting. De Gaulle wanted a teaching post at the ''École de Guerre'' in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p92-3&lt;/ref&gt; There was apparently a threat of mass resignation of the faculty were he appointed to a position there. There was talk of a posting to Corsica or North Africa, but on Pétain’s advice he accepted a two-year posting to [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|Lebanon and Syria]].&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;{{RP|93–94}} In Beirut he was chief of the 3rd Bureau (military operations) of General Louis-Paul-Gaston de Bigault du Granrut, who wrote him a glowing reference recommending him for high command in the future.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, pp99-100"&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp99-100&lt;/ref&gt;

====1930s: staff officer====
In the spring of 1931, as his posting in Beirut drew to a close, de Gaulle once again asked Pétain for a posting to the ''École de Guerre''. Pétain tried to obtain an appointment for him as Professor of History there, but once again the faculty would not have him. Instead de Gaulle, drawing on plans he had drawn up in 1928 for reform of that institution, asked Pétain to create a special post for him which would enable him to lecture on "the Conduct of War" both to the ''École de Guerre'' and to the ''Centre des Hautes Études Militaires'' (CHEM – a senior staff college for generals, known as the "school for marshals"), and also to civilians at the ''[[Ecole Normal Superieure]]'', and to civil servants.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p99, p118&lt;/ref&gt;

Pétain instead advised him to apply for a posting to the ''Secrétariat Général du Conseil Supérieur de la Défense Nationale'' (SGDN – General Secretariat of the Supreme War Council, reporting to the Under-Secretary to the Prime Minister, although later moved to the Ministry of War in 1936) in Paris. Pétain promised to lobby for the appointment, which he thought would be good experience for him. De Gaulle was posted to SGDN in November 1931, initially as a "drafting officer".&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p99, p118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;{{RP|94}}

He was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in December 1932 and appointed Head of the Third Section (operations). His service at SGDN gave him six years' experience of the interface between army planning and government, enabling him to take on ministerial responsibilities in 1940.&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;{{RP|97}}&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p105, p119 – Lacouture gives the date of this promotion both as December 1932 (the date favoured by most accounts) and December 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

After studying arrangements in the US, Italy, and Belgium, de Gaulle drafted a bill for the organisation of the country in time of war. He made a presentation about his bill to the CHEM. The bill passed the Chamber of Deputies but failed in the Senate.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p125"&gt;Lacouture 1991, p125&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early 1930s: proponent of armoured warfare====
Unlike Pétain, de Gaulle believed in the use of tanks and rapid maneuvers rather than trench warfare.&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;{{RP|108}} De Gaulle became a disciple of Émile Mayer (1851–1938), a retired lieutenant-colonel (his career had been damaged by the [[Dreyfus Affair]]) and military thinker. Mayer thought that although wars were still bound to happen, it was "obsolete" for civilised countries to threaten or wage war on one another as they had in previous centuries. He had a low opinion of the quality of French generals, and was a critic of the [[Maginot Line]] and a proponent of mechanised warfare. Lacouture suggests that Mayer focused de Gaulle's thoughts away from his obsession with the mystique of the strong leader (''Le Fil d'Epée'': 1932) and back to loyalty to Republican institutions and military reform.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp. 114–7, 131, 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 de Gaulle wrote ''Vers l'Armée de Métier'' (''Toward a Professional Army''). He proposed mechanization of the infantry, with stress on an élite force of 100,000 men and 3,000 tanks. The book imagined tanks driving around the country like cavalry. De Gaulle's mentor Emile Mayer was somewhat more prophetic than he was about the future importance of air power on the battlefield. Such an army would both compensate for France's population shortage, and be an efficient tool to enforce international law, particularly the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which forbade Germany from rearming. He also thought it would be a precursor to a deeper national reorganisation, and wrote that "a master has to make his appearance [...] whose orders cannot be challenged – a man upheld by public opinion".&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp. 133–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only 700 copies were sold in France; the claim that thousands of copies were sold in Germany&lt;ref name="time19590105"&gt;''See, e.g.,'' {{cite news|title=Charles de Gaulle|url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/personoftheyear/archive/stories/1958.html|newspaper=Time|date=5 January 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; is thought to be an exaggeration. De Gaulle used the book to widen his contacts among journalists, notably with André Pironneau, editor of ''[[L'Écho de Paris]]''. The book attracted praise across the political spectrum, apart from the hard left who were committed to the Republican ideal of a citizen army.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle's views attracted the attention of the maverick politician [[Paul Reynaud]], to whom he wrote frequently, sometimes in obsequious terms. Reynaud first invited him to meet him on 5 December 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p. 139-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The de Gaulle family were very private.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle was deeply focused on his career at this time. There is no evidence that he was tempted by fascism, and there is little evidence of his views either on domestic upheavals in [[6 February 1934 crisis|1934]] and [[French legislative election, 1936|1936]] or the many foreign policy crises of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp. 127–8, 143–4.&lt;/ref&gt; He approved of the rearmament drive which the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] government began in 1936, although French military doctrine remained that tanks should be used in penny packets for infantry support (ironically, in 1940 it would be German panzer units that would be used in a manner similar to what de Gaulle had advocated).&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; A rare insight into de Gaulle's political views is a letter to his mother warning her that war with Germany was sooner or later inevitable and reassuring her that [[Pierre Laval]]'s [[Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance|pact with the USSR in 1935]] was for the best, likening it to [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]'s [[Franco-Ottoman alliance|alliance with the Turks]] against the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]].&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Late-1930s: tank regiment====
From April 1936, whilst still in his staff position at SGDN, de Gaulle was also a lecturer to generals at CHEM.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p125"/&gt; De Gaulle's superiors disapproved of his views about tanks, and he was passed over for promotion to full colonel in 1936, supposedly because his service record was not good enough. He interceded with his political patron Reynaud, who showed his record to the Minister of War [[Edouard Daladier]]. Daladier, who was an enthusiast for rearmament with modern weapons, ensured that his name was entered onto the promotion list for the following year.&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;{{RP|109}}&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp147-8&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 General Bineau, who had taught him at St Cyr, wrote on his report on his lectureship at CHEM that he was highly able and suitable for high command in the future, but that he hid his attributes under "a cold and lofty attitude".&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p125"/&gt; He was put in command of the 507th Tank Regiment (consisting of a battalion of medium [[Char D2]]s and a battalion of [[Renault R35|R35 light tanks]]) at [[Metz]] on 13 July 1937, and his promotion to full colonel took effect on 24 December that year. De Gaulle attracted public attention by leading a parade of 80 tanks into the Place d'Armes at Metz, in his command tank "[[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp149-50, 169&lt;/ref&gt;

By now de Gaulle was beginning to be a well-known figure, known as "Colonel Motor(s)".&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;{{RP|117}} At the invitation of the publisher [[Plon (publisher)|Plon]], he produced another book, ''La France et son Armée (France and Her Army)'' in 1938. De Gaulle incorporated much of the text he had written for Pétain a decade earlier for the uncompleted book ''Le Soldat'', to Pétain's displeasure. In the end, de Gaulle agreed to include a dedication to Pétain (although he wrote his own rather than using the draft Pétain sent him), which was later dropped from postwar editions. Until 1938 Pétain had treated de Gaulle, as Lacouture puts it, "with unbounded good will", but by October 1938 he privately thought his former protégé "an ambitious man, and very ill-bred".&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp157-65, 213–5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War: the Fall of France==
===Early war===
At the outbreak of World War II, de Gaulle was put in command of the French [[Fifth Army (France)|Fifth Army]]'s tanks (five scattered battalions, largely equipped with [[Renault R35|R35 light tanks]]) in Alsace. On 12 September 1939 he attacked at [[Bitche]], simultaneously with the [[Saar Offensive]].&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p149, 169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;{{RP|118}}

At the start of October 1939 Reynaud asked for a staff posting under de Gaulle, but in the event remained at his post as Minister of Finance. De Gaulle's tanks were inspected by [[Albert Lebrun|President Lebrun]], who was impressed, but regretted that it was too late to implement his ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p170&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a paper ''L'Avènement de la force mécanique (The coming of the Armoured Force)'' which he sent to [[Alphonse Joseph Georges|General Georges]] (commander-in-chief on the northeast front – who was not especially impressed) and the politician [[Leon Blum]]. Daladier, Prime Minister at the time, was too busy to read it.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p171&lt;/ref&gt;

In late-February 1940, Reynaud told de Gaulle that he had been earmarked for command of an armoured division as soon as one became available.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp174-5&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 1940 (the exact date is uncertain) de Gaulle proposed to Reynaud that he be appointed Secretary-General of the War Council, which would in effect have made him the government's military adviser. When Reynaud became prime minister in March he was reliant on Daladier's backing, so the job went instead to the politician [[Paul Baudouin]].&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p175&lt;/ref&gt;

In late-March de Gaulle was told by Reynaud that he would be given command of the [[4e Division cuirassée|4th Armoured Division]], due to form by 15 May.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p177&lt;/ref&gt; The government appeared likely to be restructured, as Daladier and [[Maurice Gamelin]] (commander-in-chief) were under attack in the aftermath of the [[Norwegian Campaign|Allied defeat in Norway]], and had this happened de Gaulle, who on 3 May was still lobbying Reynaud for a restructuring of the control of the war, might well have joined the government.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p178"&gt;Lacouture 1991, p178&lt;/ref&gt; By 7 May he was assembling the staff of his new division.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, pp180-1"&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp180-1&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Battle of France: division commander===
{{Main article|Battle of France}}
[[File:De Gaulle-OWI.jpg|thumb|De Gaulle during World War II, wearing the two stars of a ''[[Brigade general#France|général de brigade]]'' on his sleeve]]

The Germans [[Manstein Plan|attacked the West on 10 May]].&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p178"/&gt; De Gaulle activated his new division on 12 May.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, pp180-1"/&gt; The Germans broke through at [[Battle of Sedan (1940)|Sedan]] on 15 May 1940.&lt;ref name="CDG"&gt;{{cite web|author=Brad DeLong|title=Charles de Gaulle|url=http://econ161.berkeley.edu/TCEH/charlesdegaulle.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060107012026/http://econ161.berkeley.edu/TCEH/charlesdegaulle.html|archivedate=7 January 2006|publisher=University of California at Berkeley|date=29 May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; That day, with three tank battalions assembled, less than a third of his paper strength, he was summoned to headquarters and told to attack to gain time for General Robert Touchon's [[Sixth Army (France)|Sixth Army]] to redeploy from the Maginot Line to the Aisne. General Georges told him it was his chance to implement his ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p180-2&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|time19590105}}

De Gaulle commandeered some retreating cavalry and artillery units and also received an extra half-brigade, one of whose battalions included some heavy [[Char B1#Char B1 bis|B1 bis]] tanks. The attack at [[Battle of Montcornet|Montcornet]], a key road junction near Laon, began around 04:30 on 17 May. Outnumbered and without air support, he lost 23 of his 90 vehicles to mines, anti-tank weapons, or [[Stuka]]s. On 18 May he was reinforced by two fresh regiments of armoured cavalry, bringing his strength up to 150 vehicles. He attacked again on 19 May and his forces were once again devastated by German Stukas and artillery. He ignored orders from General Georges to withdraw, and in the early afternoon demanded two more divisions from Touchon, who refused his request.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p180-3 On pp213-5, in a list of acts of insubordination committed by de Gaulle prior to 18 June 1940, Lacouture mentions a demand on 25 May 1940 that he be given command of an extra two or three divisions to mount a stronger attack. This does not appear in the more detailed narrative and it is not clear whether it is a confusion of the events on 19 May.&lt;/ref&gt; Although de Gaulle's tanks forced the German infantry to retreat to [[Caumont-sur-Durance|Caumont]], the action brought only temporary relief and did little to slow the spearhead of the German advance. Nevertheless, it was one of the few successes the French enjoyed while suffering defeats elsewhere across the country.&lt;ref name="Ledwidge p. 50-52"&gt;Ledwidge pp. 50–52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p180-3"&gt;Lacouture 1991, p180-3&lt;/ref&gt;

He delayed his retreat until 20 May. On 21 May, at the request of propaganda officers, he gave a talk on French radio about his recent attack.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p183&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition for his efforts de Gaulle was promoted to the rank of temporary ([[Acting (rank)|acting]], in Anglophone parlance) [[Brigade general#France|brigadier-general]] on 23 May 1940. Despite being compulsorily retired as a colonel on 22 June (see below) he would wear the uniform of a brigadier-general for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture writes that after the war he was “mythically a general to all eternity, but legally a retired colonel”. Early in 1946, just after his departure from office, War Minister [[Edmond Michelet]] wrote to him that Prime Minister [[Félix Gouin]] wanted his rank to be as high as possible (which Lacouture takes to mean Marshal of France). De Gaulle wrote back that it was “impossible to regulate a situation absolutely without precedent,” that the situation had continued for 5 years 7 months and 3 days and that it would be “strange, even ridiculous” to rectify his rank for administrative reasons now. As the royalties for his War Memoirs were paid to the Anne-de-Gaulle foundation, he and his wife had to live off his pension as a retired colonel in the 1950s. His wife was reduced to selling family silverware to help make ends meet.[Lacouture Vol 2, p128, pp156-7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p180-3"/&gt;

On 28–29 May, de Gaulle attacked the German bridgehead south of the Somme at [[Battle of Abbeville|Abbeville]], taking around 400 German prisoners in the last attempt to cut an escape route for the Allied forces falling back on Dunkirk.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;{{RP|127}}

The future General Paul Huard, who served under de Gaulle at this time, recorded how he would often stand on a piece of high ground, keeping other officers literally at six yards' distance, subjecting his subordinates to harsh criticism and taking all decisions autocratically himself, behaviour consistent with his later conduct as a political leader. Lacouture points out that for all his undoubted energy and physical courage there is no evidence in his brief period of command that he possessed the "hunter's eye" of the great battlefield commander, and that not a single one of his officers joined him in London, although some joined the Resistance in France.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p186&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle's rank of brigadier-general became effective on 1 June 1940.&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;{{RP|127}} That day he was in Paris. After a visit to his tailor to be fitted for his general's uniform, he visited Reynaud, who appears to have offered him a government job for the first time, then the commander-in-chief [[Maxime Weygand]], who congratulated him on saving France's honour and asked him for his advice.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p187"&gt;Lacouture 1991, p187&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 June he sent a memo to Weygand vainly urging that the French armoured divisions be consolidated from four weak divisions into three stronger ones and concentrated into an armoured [[corps]] under his command. He made the same suggestion to Reynaud.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p187"/&gt;

===The Battle of France: government minister===
On 5 June, the day the Germans began the second phase of their offensive ''([[Fall Rot]])'', Prime Minister Paul Reynaud appointed de Gaulle a government minister, as Under-Secretary of State for [[Minister of Defence (France)|National Defence and War]], with particular responsibility for coordination with the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cabinet Paul Reynaud|publisher=Assemblée Nationale Française|year=2008|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/gvt3rep.asp#paulreynaud}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weygand objected to the appointment, thinking him "a mere child".&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p190"&gt;Lacouture 1991, p190&lt;/ref&gt; Pétain (Deputy Prime Minister) was also displeased at his appointment and told Reynaud the story of the ghost-writing of ''Le Soldat''.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p190"/&gt; His appointment received a good deal of press attention, both in France and in the UK. He asked for an English-speaking aide and [[Geoffroy Chodron de Courcel]] was given the job.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p191&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 June de Gaulle visited Weygand, who believed it was "the end" and that after France was defeated Britain would also soon sue for peace. He hoped that after an armistice the Germans would allow him to retain enough of a French Army to "maintain order" in France. He gave a "despairing laugh" when de Gaulle suggested fighting on.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p193. Weygand later disputed the accuracy of de Gaulle's account of this conversation, and remarked on its similarity to a dialogue by [[Pierre Corneille]]. Lacouture suggests that de Gaulle's account is consistent with other evidence of Weygand's beliefs at the time and is therefore, allowing perhaps for a little literary embellishment, broadly plausible.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 June de Gaulle flew to London and met British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] for the first time. It was thought that half a million men could be evacuated to [[French North Africa]], provided the British and French navies and air forces coordinated their efforts. Either at this meeting or on 16 June he urged Churchill in vain to throw more [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) aircraft into the Battle of France, but conceded there and then that Churchill was right to refuse.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p194&lt;/ref&gt;

In his memoirs de Gaulle mentioned his support for the proposal to continue the war from French North Africa, but at the time he was more in favour of the plan to form a "[[National redoubt|redoubt]]" in Brittany than he later admitted.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p189&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy entered the war on 10 June. That day de Gaulle was present at two meetings with Weygand (he only mentions one in his memoirs), one at the defence committee and a second where Weygand barged into Reynaud's office and demanded an armistice. When Weygand asked de Gaulle, who wanted to carry on fighting, if he had "anything to suggest", de Gaulle replied that it was the government's job to give orders, not to make suggestions. De Gaulle wanted Paris to be stubbornly defended by [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny|de Lattre]], but instead it was declared an [[open city]]. At around 23:00 Reynaud and de Gaulle left Paris for Tours; the rest of the government left Paris on 11 June.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, pp195-6"&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp195-6&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Battle of France: Briare and Tours===
On 11 June de Gaulle drove to Arcis-sur-Aube and offered General [[Charles Huntziger|Hunziger]] (Commander of the Central Army Group) Weygand's job as Commander-in-Chief. Hunziger accepted in principle (although according to Henri Massis he was merely amused at the prospect of forming a Breton redoubt – Hunziger would sign the armistice on behalf of Pétain a few weeks later) but de Gaulle was unable to persuade Reynaud to sack Weygand.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, pp195-6"/&gt;

Later on 11 June de Gaulle attended the meeting of the [[Anglo-French Supreme War Council]] at the Chateau du Muguet at [[Briare]]. The British were represented by Churchill, [[Anthony Eden]], [[John Dill]], [[Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay|General Ismay]] and [[Edward Spears]], and the French by Reynaud, Pétain, Weygand, and Georges. Churchill demanded that the French take to guerrilla warfare, and reminded Pétain of how he had come to the aid of the British with forty divisions in [[Spring Offensive|March 1918]], receiving a dusty answer in each case. De Gaulle's fighting spirit made a strong impression on the British. At the meeting de Gaulle met Pétain for the first time in two years. Pétain noted his recent promotion to general, adding that he did not congratulate him, as ranks were of no use in defeat. When de Gaulle protested that Pétain himself had been promoted to brigadier-general and division commander at the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] in 1914, he replied that there was "no comparison" with the present situation. De Gaulle later conceded that Pétain was right about that much at least.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p197&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle missed the second day of the conference as he was in [[Rennes]] for a meeting (not mentioned in his memoirs) to discuss the plans for the Breton redoubt with General [[René Altmayer]]. He then returned to attend a cabinet meeting, at which it was clear that there was a growing movement for an armistice, and which decided that the government should move to [[Bordeaux]] rather than de Gaulle's preference for [[Quimper]] in Brittany.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p198&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 June de Gaulle attended another Anglo-French conference at Tours with Churchill, [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], Spears, Ismay, and [[Alexander Cadogan]]. This time few other major French figures were present apart from Reynaud and Baudoin. He was an hour late, and his account is not reliable. Reynaud demanded that France be released from the agreement which he had made with Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] in March 1940, so that France could seek an armistice. De Gaulle wrote that Churchill was sympathetic to France seeking an armistice, provided that an agreement was reached about what was to happen to the French fleet. This claim was later made by apologists for the Vichy Regime, e.g., General Georges, who claimed that Churchill had supported the armistice as a means of keeping the Germans out of French North Africa. However, is not supported by other eyewitnesses (Churchill himself, [[Roland de Margerie]], Spears) who agree that Churchill said that he "understood" the French action but that he did ''not'' agree with it. He murmured at de Gaulle that he was ''"l’homme du destin (the man of destiny)"'', although it is unclear whether de Gaulle actually heard him.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp198-200, 238&lt;/ref&gt; At the cabinet meeting that evening Pétain strongly supported Weygand's demand for an armistice, and said that he himself would remain in France to share the suffering of the French people and to begin the national rebirth. De Gaulle was dissuaded from resigning by the Interior Minister [[Georges Mandel]], who argued that the war was only just beginning, and that de Gaulle needed to keep his reputation unsullied.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p201"&gt;Lacouture 1991, p201&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Battle of France: Franco-British Union===
De Gaulle arrived at Bordeaux on 14 June, and was given a new mission to go to London to discuss the potential evacuation to North Africa. He had a brief meeting with [[Francois Darlan|Admiral Darlan]] about the potential role of the French Navy. That evening, by coincidence, he dined in the same restaurant as Pétain: he went over to shake his hand in silence, the last time they ever met. Next morning no aircraft could be found so he had to drive to Brittany, where he visited his wife and daughters, and his aged mother (whom he never saw again, as she died in July), before taking a boat to Plymouth (he asked the skipper if he would be willing to carry on the war under British flag), where he arrived on 16 June. He ordered the boat ''Pasteur'', with a cargo of munitions, to be diverted to a British port, which caused some members of the French Government to call for him to be put on trial.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p201"/&gt;

On the afternoon of Sunday 16 June de Gaulle was at [[10 Downing Street]] for talks about [[Jean Monnet]]'s mooted [[Franco-British Union#World War II (1940)|Anglo-French political union]]. He telephoned Reynaud – they were cut off during the conversation and had to resume later – with the news that the British had agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp203-4&lt;/ref&gt; He took off from London on a British aircraft at 18:30 on 16 June (it is unclear whether, as was later claimed, he and Churchill agreed that he would be returning soon), landing at Bordeaux at around 22:00 to be told that he was no longer a minister, as Reynaud had resigned as prime minister after the Franco-British Union had been rejected by his cabinet. Pétain had become prime minister with a remit of seeking an [[armistice]] with [[Nazi Germany]]. De Gaulle was now in imminent danger of arrest.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp202-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flight with Edward Spears===
De Gaulle visited Reynaud, who still hoped to escape to French North Africa and declined to come to London. Reynaud still had control of secret government funds until the handover of power the next day. It has been suggested that he ordered de Gaulle to go to London, but no written evidence has ever been found to confirm this. Georges Mandel also refused to come.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p209-11&lt;/ref&gt;

At around 09:00 on the morning of 17 June he flew to London on a British aircraft with [[Edward Spears]]. The escape was hair-raising, with Spears' aide having to run to the hangar at the last minute to fetch a rope to tie on the luggage. Spears claimed that de Gaulle had been reluctant to come, and that he had pulled him into the aircraft at the last minute, although de Gaulle’s biographer does not accept this. Jean Laurent brought 100,000 gold francs in secret funds provided to him by Reynaud.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p211-6&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle later told [[André Malraux]] of the mental anguish which his flight to London – a break with the French Army and with the recognised government, which would inevitably be seen as treason by many – had caused him.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p212&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeal from London===

[[File:De Gaulle speech plaque in Arc de Triomphe.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.9|De Gaulle speech plaque in Arc de Triomphe]]

De Gaulle landed at [[Heston Airport]] soon after 12:30 on 17 June. He saw Churchill at around 15:00 and Churchill offered him broadcast time on BBC. They both knew about Pétain's broadcast earlier that day that stated that "the fighting must end" and that he had approached the Germans for terms. That evening de Gaulle dined with Jean Monnet and denounced Pétain’s "treason".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, 2019, p 125-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The next day the British Cabinet (Churchill was not present, as it was the day of his [[This was their finest hour|"Finest Hour" speech]]) were reluctant to agree to de Gaulle giving a radio address, as Britain was still in communication with the Pétain government about the fate of the French fleet. [[Duff Cooper]] (Minister of Information) had an advance copy of the text of the address, to which there were no objections. The cabinet eventually agreed after individual lobbying, as indicated by a handwritten amendment to the cabinet minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp221-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDG"/&gt;

De Gaulle's ''[[Appeal of 18 June]]'' exhorted the French people not to be demoralized and to continue to resist the occupation of France. He also – apparently on his own initiative – declared that he would broadcast again the next day.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p208"&gt;Lacouture 1991, p208&lt;/ref&gt; No recording survives of the 18 June speech. Few listened to it, although it was published in some newspapers in metropolitan (mainland) France. The speech was largely aimed at French soldiers who were then in Britain after being evacuated from [[Norwegian campaign|Norway]] and [[Dunkirk evacuation|Dunkirk]]; most showed no interest in fighting for de Gaulle's [[Free French Forces]] and were repatriated back to France to become German prisoners of war.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p226&lt;/ref&gt;

In his next broadcast on 19 June de Gaulle denied the legitimacy of the government at Bordeaux.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p208"/&gt; He called on the North African troops to live up to the tradition of [[Bertrand Clausel]], [[Thomas Robert Bugeaud]], and [[Hubert Lyautey]] by defying orders from Bordeaux. The British Foreign Office protested to Churchill.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p228&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle also tried, largely in vain, to attract the support of French forces in the French Empire. He telegraphed to General [[Charles Noguès]] (Resident-General in Morocco and Commander-in-Chief of French forces in North Africa), offering to serve under him or to cooperate in any way. Noguès, who was dismayed by the armistice but agreed to go along with it, refused to cooperate and forbade the press in French North Africa to publish de Gaulle's appeal. Noguès told the British liaison officer that de Gaulle's attitude was "unseemly".&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp229-30&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle also sent a telegram to Weygand offering to serve under his orders, receiving a dismissive reply.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p230&lt;/ref&gt;

After the armistice was signed on 21 June 1940, de Gaulle spoke at 20:00 on 22 June to denounce it.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p236"&gt;Lacouture 1991, p236&lt;/ref&gt; The Bordeaux government declared him compulsorily retired from the French Army (with the rank of colonel) on 23 June 1940.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1:243-4"&gt;Lacouture 1:243-4&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 June the British Government denounced the armistice as a breach of the Anglo-French treaty signed in March, and stated that they no longer regarded the Bordeaux Government as a fully independent state. They also "took note" of the plan to establish a French National Committee ''(FNC)'' in exile, but did not mention de Gaulle by name. Jean Monnet broke with de Gaulle on 23 June, as he thought his appeal was "too personal" and went too far, and that French opinion would not rally to a man who was seen to be operating from British soil. He said he had warned the Foreign Office officials Alexander Cadogan and [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Robert Vansittart]], as well as Edward Spears, of his concerns about de Gaulle. Monnet soon resigned as head of the Inter-Allied Commission and departed for the US. De Gaulle broadcast again on 24 June.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, pp236-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leader of the Free French===
The armistice took effect from 00:35 on 25 June.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p236"/&gt; Alexander Cadogan of the foreign office sent [[Gladwyn Jebb]], then a fairly junior official, to ask de Gaulle to tone down his next broadcast on 26 June; de Gaulle backed down under protest when Jebb told him that he would otherwise be banned from broadcasting. He claimed erroneously that the French fleet was to be handed over to the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p248-51&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 June de Gaulle wrote to Churchill demanding recognition of his French Committee.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p208"/&gt; On 28 June, after Churchill's envoys had failed to establish contact with the French leaders in North Africa, the British Government recognised de Gaulle as leader of the Free French, despite the reservations of Halifax and Cadogan at the foreign office.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p243&lt;/ref&gt; Cadogan later wrote that de Gaulle was "that c*** of a fellow", but other foreign office figures [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Robert Vansittart]] and [[Oliver Harvey, 1st Baron Harvey of Tasburgh|Oliver Harvey]] were quite sympathetic, as was ''The Times'' which gave de Gaulle plenty of coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p249-50&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle had little success in attracting the support of major figures. Ambassador [[Charles Corbin]], who had strongly supported the mooted Anglo-French Union on 16 June, resigned from the French Foreign Office but retired to South America. [[Alexis Leger]], Secretary-General at the [[Quai d'Orsay]] (who hated Reynaud for sacking him) came to London but went on to the US. Roland de Margerie stayed in France despite his opposition to the armistice. De Gaulle received support from Captain Tissier and [[André Dewavrin]] (both of whom had been fighting in Norway prior to joining the Free French), [[Gaston Palewski]], [[Maurice Schumann]], and the jurist [[René Cassin]].&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p239&lt;/ref&gt;

Pétain's government was recognised by the US, the USSR, and the Papacy, and controlled the French fleet and the forces in almost all her colonies. At this time de Gaulle's followers consisted of a secretary of limited competence, three colonels, a dozen captains, a famous law professor (Cassin), and three battalions of [[French Foreign Legion|legionnaires]] who had agreed to stay in Britain and fight for him. For a time the [[New Hebrides]] were the only French colony to back de Gaulle.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p244&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 June 1940 [[Émile Muselier|Admiral Muselier]] joined the Free French.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p263"&gt;Lacouture 1991, p263&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle initially reacted angrily to news of the Royal Navy's [[Attack on Mers-el-Kébir|attack on the French fleet]] (3 July); Pétain and others wrongly blamed him for provoking it by his 26 June speech (in fact it had been planned at least as early as 16 June). He considered withdrawing to Canada to live as a private citizen and waited five days before broadcasting. Spears called on de Gaulle on 5 July and found him "astonishingly objective" and acknowledging that it was the right thing from the British point of view. Spears reported to Churchill that de Gaulle had shown "a splendid dignity". In his broadcast of 8 July he spoke of the "pain and anger" caused by the attack and that it was a "hateful tragedy not a glorious battle", but that one day the enemy would have used the ships against England  or the French Empire, and that the defeat of England would mean "bondage forever" for France. "Our two ancient nations...remain bound to one another. They will either go down both together or both together they will win".&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p248-9&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Bastille Day]] (14 July) 1940 de Gaulle led a group of between 200 and 300 sailors to lay a wreath at the statue of [[Ferdinand Foch]] at Grosvenor Gardens.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p260&lt;/ref&gt; A mass of anonymous flowers were left on his mother’s grave on 16 July 1940, suggesting he was not without admirers in France.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p256"&gt;Lacouture 1991, p256&lt;/ref&gt;

From 22 July 1940 de Gaulle used [[Carlton House Terrace|4 Carlton Gardens]] in [[central London]] as his London headquarters. His family had left Brittany (the other ship which left at the same time was sunk) and lived for a time at [[Petts Wood]]. As his daughter Anne was terrified by the [[The Blitz|Blitz]] they moved to [[Ellesmere, Shropshire|Ellesmere]] in Shropshire, a four-hour journey from London and where de Gaulle was only able to visit them once a month. His wife and daughter also lived for a time in the country at Rodinghead House, [[Little Gaddesden]], in Hertfordshire, 45 kilometres (28 miles) from central London. De Gaulle lived at the [[Connaught Hotel]] in London, then from 1942–1944 he lived in [[Hampstead]], North London.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1:257–58&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vichy regime had already sentenced de Gaulle to four years' imprisonment; on 2 August 1940 he was condemned to death by court martial ''in absentia'', although Pétain commented that he would ensure that the sentence was never carried out.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1:243-4"/&gt; De Gaulle said of the sentence, "I consider the act of the Vichy men as void; I shall have an explanation with them after the victory".&lt;ref name="sptimes19400803"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Dk8wAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XE0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3148%2C219080 | title=French Take Part In Air Raids | work=St. Petersburg Times | date=1940-08-03 | accessdate=2018-08-09 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and Churchill reached agreement on 7 August 1940, that Britain would fund the Free French, with the bill to be settled after the war (the financial agreement was finalised in March 1941). A separate letter guaranteed the territorial integrity of the French Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p261-1&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[Georges Catroux]], Governor of [[French Indo-China]] (which was increasingly coming under Japan's thumb), disapproved of the armistice and congratulated de Gaulle, whom he had known for many years. He was sacked by Vichy and arrived in London on 31 August; de Gaulle had gone to Dakar, but they met in [[Chad]] four weeks later. He was the most senior military figure to defect to the Free French.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p263"/&gt;

In October 1940, after talks between the foreign office and [[Louis Rougier]], de Gaulle was asked to tone down his attacks on Pétain. On average he spoke on BBC radio three times a month.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p250-1"&gt;Lacouture 1991, p250-1&lt;/ref&gt;

===De Gaulle and Pétain: rival visions of France===
Prime Minister Pétain moved the government to Vichy (2 July) and had the National Assembly (10 July) vote to dissolve itself and give him dictatorial powers, making the beginning of his ''Révolution nationale'' (National Revolution) intended to "reorient" French society. This was the dawn of the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]].&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1:243-4"/&gt;

De Gaulle's subsequent speeches reached many parts of the territories under the Vichy regime, helping to rally the French resistance movement and earning him much popularity amongst the French people and soldiers. The British historian Christopher Flood noted that there were major differences between the speeches of de Gaulle and Pétain, which reflected their views on themselves and of France. Pétain always used the personal pronoun ''je'', portrayed himself as both a Christ-like figure sacrificing himself for France while also assuming a God-like tone of a semi-omniscient narrator who knew truths about the world that the rest of the French did not.&lt;ref name="HolmanKelly-2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flood|first1=Christopher|editor1-last=Holman|editor1-first=Valerie|editor2-last=Kelly|editor2-first=Debra|title=France at War in the Twentieth Century; Propaganda, Myth, and Metaphor|date=2000|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|isbn=9781571817013|pages=88-110|url=http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title/HolmanFrance|accessdate=19 November 2017|chapter=Pétain and de Gaulle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle began by making frequent use of "I" and "me" in his war-time speeches, but over time, their use declined. Unlike Pétain, de Gaulle never invoked quasi-religious imagery to enhance his prestige.&lt;ref name="HolmanKelly-2000" /&gt;

De Gaulle always mentioned Pétain by name whereas Pétain never mentioned de Gaulle directly, referring to him as the "''faux ami''" ("false friend").&lt;ref name="HolmanKelly-2000" /&gt;

Pétain exonerated the French military of responsibility for the defeat of 1940 which he blamed on the moral decline of French society (thus making his ''Révolution nationale'' necessary) while de Gaulle blamed the military chiefs while exonerating French society for the defeat (thus suggesting that French society was nowhere near as rotten as Pétain claimed, making the ''Révolution nationale'' unnecessary).&lt;ref name="HolmanKelly-2000" /&gt; Pétain claimed that France had "stupidly" declared war on Germany in 1939 at British prompting while de Gaulle spoke of the entire era since 1914 as "''la guerre de trente ans''" ("the thirty years' war"), arguing the two world wars were really one with a long truce in between.&lt;ref name="HolmanKelly-2000" /&gt; The only historical figure Pétain invoked was [[Joan of Arc]] as a model of self-sacrificing French patriotism in the "eternal struggle" against England whereas de Gaulle invoked virtually every major French historical figure from the ancient Gauls to World War I.&lt;ref name="HolmanKelly-2000" /&gt; De Gaulle's willingness to invoke historical figures from before and after 1789 was meant to suggest that his France was an inclusive France where there was room for both left and right, in contrast to Pétain's demand for national unity under his leadership.&lt;ref name="HolmanKelly-2000" /&gt; Most significantly, Pétain's speeches always stressed the need for France to withdraw from a hostile and threatening world to find unity.&lt;ref name="HolmanKelly-2000" /&gt; By contrast, de Gaulle's speeches, while praising the greatness of France, lacked Pétain's implicit xenophobia; the fight for a free, democratic and inclusive France was always portrayed as part of a wider worldwide struggle for world freedom, where France would be an anchor for a new democratic order.&lt;ref name="HolmanKelly-2000" /&gt;

De Gaulle spoke more of "the Republic" than of "democracy"; before his death René Cassin claimed that he had "succeeded in turning de Gaulle towards democracy". However, claims that de Gaulle was surrounded by [[Cagoulards]], Royalists and other right-wing extremists are untrue. Some of André Dewavrin’s closest colleagues were Cagoulards, although Dewavrin always denied that he himself was. Many leading figures of the Free French and the Resistance, e.g., [[Jean Moulin]] and [[Pierre Brossolette]], were on the political left.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p254-5&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1940 de Gaulle was beginning to be recognised as the leader of the Resistance, a position cemented after Jean Moulin's visit to London in autumn 1941.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p256"/&gt; In the summer of 1941 the BBC set aside five minutes per day (later increased to ten) for the Free French, with Maurice Schumann as the main spokesman, and eventually there was a programme "Les Francais parlent aux Francais". A newspaper ''France'' was also soon set up.&lt;ref name="Lacouture 1991, p250-1"/&gt;

De Gaulle organised the Free French Forces and the Allies gave increasing support and recognition to de Gaulle's efforts. In London in September 1941 de Gaulle formed the Free French National Council, with himself as president. It was an all-encompassing coalition of resistance forces, ranging from conservative Catholics like himself to communists. By early 1942, the "Fighting French" movement, as it was now called, gained rapidly in power and influence; it overcame Vichy in Syria and Lebanon, adding to its base. Dealing with the French communists was a delicate issue, for they were under Moscow's control and the USSR was friendly with Germany in 1940–41 as a result of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. They came into the Free French movement only when [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany invaded Russia]] in June 1941. De Gaulle's policy then became one of friendship directly with Moscow, but [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] showed little interest.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1:373, 462&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, de Gaulle created the [[Normandie-Niemen]] squadron, a [[Free French Air Force]] regiment, in order to fight on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. It is the only Western allied formation to have fought until the end of the war in the East.&lt;ref&gt;Sean M. Mcateer, "500 Days: The War in Eastern Europe, 1944–1945", p.361 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Bg8drRyDGhEC&amp;pg=PA361&amp;lpg=PA361&amp;dq=normandie+niemen+eastern+front+only+western&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9s7P1zMBSM&amp;sig=eDwaUOQ0pmDNTppqGtvFULnIoVw&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=myXFVJSNNsLqUorgg-AO&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=normandie%20niemen%20eastern%20front%20only%20western&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

===De Gaulle's relations with the ''Anglo-Saxons''===
[[File:Sikorski McNaughton Churchill de Gaulle C064027.jpg|thumb|right|Charles de Gaulle (far right) with [[Andrew McNaughton]], [[Władysław Sikorski]], and [[Winston Churchill]]]]
In his dealings with the British and Americans (both referred to as the "Anglo-Saxons", in de Gaulle's parlance), he always insisted on retaining full freedom of action on behalf of France and was constantly on the verge of losing the Allies' support. Some writers have sought to deny that there was deep and mutual antipathy between de Gaulle and British and American political leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, F. Patrick [http://www.cavortingwithstrangers.com/bookVIII-Gaulle.php ''Cavorting with Strangers'': Book VIII- Charles de Gaulle arrogant autocrat, Chapter 1: Feet of Clay]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article995545.ece|place=London|work=The Times|first=Charles|last=Bremner|title=Did De Gaulle really hate the British Mais non|date=18 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle personally had ambivalent feelings about Britain, possibly in part because of childhood memories of the [[Fashoda Incident]]. As an adult he spoke German much better than he spoke English; he had thought little of the British Army’s contribution to the First World War, and even less of that of 1939–40, and in the 1930s he had been a reader of the journal ''[[Action Française]]'' which blamed Britain for German foreign policy gains at France’s expense.&lt;ref&gt;Lacouture 1991, p220&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle explained his position:{{quote|Never did the Anglo-Saxons really treat us as real allies. They never consulted us, government to government, on any of their provisions. For political purpose or by convenience, they sought to use the French forces for their own goals, as if these forces belonged to them, alleging that they had provided weapons to them [...] I considered that I had to play the French game, since the others were playing theirs ... I deliberately adopted a stiffened and hardened attitude ....&lt;ref&gt;[[Le Monde diplomatique]], "Les relations entre Roosevelt et Charles de Gaulle", 1956 [http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1956/08/JULIEN/21868]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition, de Gaulle harboured a suspicion of the British in particular, believing that they were seeking to seize France's colonial possessions in the [[Levant]]. Winston Churchill was often frustrated at what he perceived as de Gaulle's patriotic arrogance, but also wrote of his "immense admiration" for him during the early days of his British exile. Although their relationship later became strained, Churchill tried to explain the reasons for de Gaulle's behaviour in the second volume of [[The Second World War (book series)|his history of World War II]]:{{quote|He felt it was essential to his position before the French people that he should maintain a proud and haughty demeanour towards "[[perfidious Albion]]", although in exile, dependent upon our protection and dwelling in our midst. He had to be rude to the British to prove to French eyes that he was not a British puppet. He certainly carried out this policy with perseverance.}}

De Gaulle described his adversarial relationship with Churchill in these words: "When I am right, I get angry. Churchill gets angry when he is wrong. We are angry at each other much of the time."&lt;ref name="Telushkin1987"&gt;{{cite book|last=Telushkin|first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph Telushkin|title=Uncommon Sense: The World's Fullest Compendium of Wisdom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mJFKnxzlG0C&amp;pg=PA55|year=1987|publisher=Shapolsky Publishers|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-933503-48-9|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion in 1941 Churchill spoke to him on the telephone. De Gaulle said that the French people thought he was a reincarnation of Joan of Arc, to which Churchill replied that the English had had to burn the last one.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Geoffrey. ''Military Anecdotes'' (1992) p. 34, Guinness Publishing {{ISBN|0-85112-519-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clementine Churchill]], who admired de Gaulle, once cautioned him, "General, you must not hate your friends more than you hate your enemies." De Gaulle himself stated famously, "No Nation has friends, only interests."&lt;ref name="TDQ"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Travellers' Dictionary of Quotation: Who Said What, About Where?|editor=Peter Yapp|year=1983|publisher=Routledge Kegan &amp; Paul|place=London|isbn=0-7100-0992-5|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his initial support, Churchill, emboldened by American antipathy to the French general, urged his [[War Cabinet]] to remove de Gaulle as leader of the French resistance. But the War Cabinet warned Churchill that a precipitate break with de Gaulle would have a disastrous effect on the whole resistance movement. By autumn 1943, Churchill had to acknowledge that de Gaulle had won the struggle for leadership of Free France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/06/world/churchill-and-roosevelt-wanted-de-gaulle-out-britain-discloses.html "Churchill and Roosevelt Wanted de Gaulle Out, Britain Discloses"], ''New York Times'', 6 January 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle's relations with Washington were even more strained. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] for a long time refused to recognize de Gaulle as the representative of France, insisting on negotiations with the Vichy government. Roosevelt in particular hoped that it would be possible to wean Pétain away from Germany.&lt;ref name="Berthon"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Allies at War: Churchill V Roosevelt V De Gaulle|last=Berthon|first=Simo|date=4 June 2001|publisher=Collins|place=London|isbn=0-00-711622-5|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt maintained recognition of the Vichy regime until late 1942, and saw de Gaulle as an impudent representative of a minority interest.&lt;ref&gt;Julius W. Pratt, "De Gaulle and the United States: How the Rift Began," ''History Teacher'' (1968) 1#4 pp 5–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1942, Roosevelt championed General [[Henri Giraud]], more compliant with US interests than de Gaulle, as the leader of the French Resistance. At the [[Casablanca Conference]] (1943), Roosevelt forced de Gaulle to cooperate with Giraud, but de Gaulle was considered as the undisputed leader of the Resistance by the French people and Giraud was progressively deprived of his political and military roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QN9k6DW5uN0C&amp;pg=PA68|title=When Roosevelt Planned to Govern France|work=google.fr|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British and Soviet governments urged Roosevelt to recognise [[French Committee of National Liberation|de Gaulle's provisional government]], but Roosevelt delayed doing so as long as possible and even recognised the Italian provisional government before the French one. British and Soviet allies were outraged that the  US president unilaterally recognised the new government of a former enemy before de Gaulle's one and both recognised the French government in retaliation, forcing Roosevelt to recognise de Gaulle in late 1944,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/dossiers-thematiques/1940-1944-la-seconde-guerre-mondiale/la-france-libre-et-les-allies/les-etats-unis/les-etats-unis-face-a-la-france-libre.php|title=Les Etats-Unis face à la France Libre|publisher=charles-de-gaulle.org|accessdate=14 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304055320/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/dossiers-thematiques/1940-1944-la-seconde-guerre-mondiale/la-france-libre-et-les-allies/les-etats-unis/les-etats-unis-face-a-la-france-libre.php|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Roosevelt managed to exclude de Gaulle from the [[Yalta Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, "De Gaulle Rallied France in War and Strove to Lead Her to Greatness", 1970 [https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1122.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt eventually abandoned his plans to [[Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories|rule France as an occupied territory]] and to transfer [[French Indochina]] to the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Atwood Lawrence,Fredrik Logevall, "The First Vietnam War: Colonial Conflict and Cold War Crisis", pp.57–58 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYX4Cmi0gwgC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=roosevelt+de+gaulle+indochin&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IDLCVMS8G4b5UqTmg9AG&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=roosevelt%20de%20gaulle%20indochin&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kim Munholland,"Rock of Contention: Free French and Americans at War in New Caledonia, 1940–1945", p.185 [https://books.google.com/books?id=XEimktLz-lAC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=amgot+france+roosevelt&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0jTCVK3LGYKuU5-NgYgO&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=amgot%20france%20roosevelt&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plane sabotage===
On 21 April 1943, de Gaulle was scheduled to fly in a [[Vickers Wellington|Wellington bomber]] to Scotland to inspect the [[Free French Navy]]. On take-off, the bomber's tail dropped, and the plane nearly crashed into the airfield's embankment. Only the skill of the pilot, who became aware of sabotage on takeoff, saved them. On inspection, it was found that aeroplane's separator rod had been sabotaged, using acid.&lt;ref name="Picknett-Prince-Prior p. 301"&gt;{{harvnb|Picknett|Prince|Prior|2005| p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Breuer p. 143-145"&gt;{{harvnb|Breuer|2008|pp=143–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Secret Intelligence Service|Britain's MI6]] investigated the incident, but no one was ever apprehended.

===Algiers===
[[File:Gen De Gaulle &amp; Catroux - North Africa.jpg|thumb|Generals de Gaulle and [[Georges Catroux|Catroux]], North Africa]]

Working with the [[French Resistance]] and other supporters in France's colonial African possessions after the [[Operation Torch|Anglo–US invasion of North Africa]] in November 1942, de Gaulle moved his headquarters to [[Algiers]] in May 1943, leaving Britain to be on French territory. He became first joint head (with the less resolutely independent General [[Henri Giraud]], the candidate preferred by the  US who wrongly suspected de Gaulle of being a British puppet) and then—after squeezing out Giraud by force of personality—sole chairman of the [[French Committee of National Liberation]].&lt;ref name="CDG"/&gt;

De Gaulle was held in high regard by Allied commander General [[Dwight Eisenhower]].&lt;ref name="Keegan298"&gt;Keegan p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; In Algiers in 1943, Eisenhower gave de Gaulle the assurance in person that a French force would liberate Paris and arranged that the army division of French General [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque]] would be transferred from North Africa to the UK to carry out that liberation.&lt;ref name="Keegan298"/&gt; Eisenhower was impressed by the combativeness of units of the [[Free French Forces]] and "grateful for the part they had played in mopping up the remnants of German resistance"; he also detected how strongly devoted many were to de Gaulle and how ready they were to accept him as the national leader.&lt;ref name="Keegan298"/&gt;

===Preparations for D-Day===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2016}}
As preparations for the liberation of Europe gathered pace, the US in particular found de Gaulle's tendency to view everything from the French perspective to be extremely tiresome. Roosevelt, who refused to recognize any provisional authority in France until elections had been held, referred to de Gaulle as "an apprentice dictator", a view backed by a number of leading Frenchmen in Washington, including [[Jean Monnet]], who later became an instrumental figure in the setting up of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] that led to the modern [[European Union]]. Roosevelt directed Churchill to not provide de Gaulle with strategic details of the imminent invasion because he did not trust him to keep the information to himself. French codes were considered weak, posing a risk since the Free French refused to use British or American codes.&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt; De Gaulle refused to share coded information with the British, who were then obliged secretly to break the codes to read French messages.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Simon (2000).

Nevertheless, a few days before D-Day, Churchill, whose relationship with the General had deteriorated since he arrived in Britain, decided he needed to keep him informed of developments, and on 2 June he sent two passenger aircraft and his representative, [[Duff Cooper]] to Algiers to bring de Gaulle back to Britain. De Gaulle refused because of Roosevelt's intention to install a provisional Allied military government in the former occupied territories pending elections, but he eventually relented and flew to Britain the next day.

TR1505.jpg|thumb|left|Winston Churchill and General de Gaulle at [[Marrakesh]], January 1944]]
Upon his arrival at [[RAF Northolt]] on 4 June 1944 he received an official welcome, and a letter reading "My dear general! Welcome to these shores, very great military events are about to take place!"&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt; Later, on his personal train, Churchill informed him that he wanted him to make a radio address, but when informed that the Americans continued to refuse to recognise his right to power in France, and after Churchill suggested he request a meeting with Roosevelt to improve his relationship with the president, de Gaulle became angry, demanding to know why he should "lodge my candidacy for power in France with Roosevelt; the French government exists".&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;

De Gaulle became worried that the German withdrawal from France might lead to a breakdown of law and order in the country and even a possible communist takeover.&lt;ref name=Beevor&gt;Beevor, Antony (2009) ''D-Day: The Battle for Normandy'', Penguin Group, {{ISBN|1101148721}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the general conversation which followed with those present, de Gaulle was involved in an angry exchange with the Labour minister, [[Ernest Bevin]], and, raising his concerns about the validity of the new currency to be circulated by the Allies after the liberation, de Gaulle commented scornfully, "go and wage war with your false money". De Gaulle was very concerned that an American takeover of the French administration would just provoke a communist uprising.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Churchill then lost his temper, saying that Britain would always be an ally to the United States, and that under the circumstances, if they had to choose between France and the US, Britain would always choose the latter. De Gaulle replied that he realised this would always be the case. The next day, de Gaulle refused to address the French nation as the script again made no mention of his being the legitimate interim ruler of France. It instructed the French people to obey Allied military authorities until elections could be held, and so the row continued, with de Gaulle calling Churchill a "gangster". Churchill accused de Gaulle of treason in the height of battle, and demanded that he be flown back to Algiers "in chains if necessary".&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;

De Gaulle and Churchill had a complex relationship during the wartime period. De Gaulle did show respect and admiration for Churchill, and even some light humorous interactions between the two have been noted by observers such as Duff Cooper, the British Ambassador to the French Committee of Liberation.&lt;ref name="winstonchurchill.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour/issues-109-to-144/no-138/894-lion-of-britain-cross-of-lorraine-churchill-and-de-gaulle|title=Lion of Britain, Cross of Lorraine: Churchill and de Gaulle|publisher=winstonchurchill.org|accessdate=14 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521023613/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour/issues-109-to-144/no-138/894-lion-of-britain-cross-of-lorraine-churchill-and-de-gaulle|archivedate=21 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill explained his support for de Gaulle during the darkest hours, calling him "L'homme du destin".&lt;ref name="winstonchurchill.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/take-a-frenchman-an-englishman-and-then/207280.article|title=Take a Frenchman, an Englishman and then...|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Casablanca in 1943, Churchill supported de Gaulle as the embodiment of a French Army that was otherwise defeated, stating that "De Gaulle is the spirit of that Army. Perhaps the last survivor of a warrior race."&lt;ref name="winstonchurchill.org"/&gt; Churchill supported de Gaulle as he had been one of the first major French leaders to reject Nazi German rule outright, stating in August 1944 that "I have never forgotten, and can never forget, that he [de Gaulle] stood forth as the first eminent Frenchman to face the common foe in what seemed to be the hour of ruin of his country and possibly, of ours."&lt;ref name="winstonchurchill.org"/&gt;

In the years to come, the sometimes hostile, sometimes friendly dependent wartime relationship of de Gaulle and his future political peers reenacted the historical national and colonial rivalry and lasting enmity between the French and the British,&lt;ref&gt;Bohlen, Avis (2007) {{cite web |url=http://www.europeaninstitute.org/Summer/Fall-2007/europes-most-influential-love-hate-relationship.html |title=Europe's Most Influential Love-Hate Relationship |accessdate=2010-12-28 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606230257/http://www.europeaninstitute.org/Summer/Fall-2007/europes-most-influential-love-hate-relationship.html |archivedate=6 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}.

===Return to France===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2016}}
De Gaulle ignored ''les Anglo-Saxons'', and proclaimed the authority of [[Free France]] over the metropolitan territory the next day.{{when|date=December 2014}} Under the leadership of [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny|General de Lattre de Tassigny]], France fielded an entire army – a joint force of Free French together with French colonial troops from North Africa – on the Western Front. Initially landing as part of [[Operation Dragoon]], in the south of France, the [[French First Army]] helped to liberate almost one third of the country and participated in the invasion and occupation of Germany. As the invasion slowly progressed and the Germans were pushed back, de Gaulle made preparations to return to France.

[[File:HD-SN-99-02715.JPEG|thumb|left|General de Gaulle delivering a speech in liberated [[Cherbourg]] from the hôtel de ville (town hall)]]

On 14 June 1944, he left Britain for France for what was supposed to be a one-day trip. Despite an agreement that he would take only two staff, he was accompanied by a large entourage with extensive luggage, and although many rural Normans remained mistrustful of him, he was warmly greeted by the inhabitants of the towns he visited, such as the badly damaged [[Isigny-sur-Mer|Isigny]]. Finally he arrived at the city of [[Bayeux]], which he now proclaimed as the capital of Free France. Appointing his Aide-de-Camp Francois Coulet as head of the civil administration, de Gaulle returned to the UK that same night on a French destroyer, and although the official position of the supreme military command remained unchanged, local Allied officers found it more practical to deal with the fledgling administration in Bayeux in everyday matters.&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt; De Gaulle flew to Algiers on 16 June and then went on to Rome to meet the Pope and the new Italian government. At the beginning of July he at last visited Roosevelt in Washington, where he received the 17-gun salute of a senior military leader rather than the 21 guns of a visiting head of state. The visit was 'devoid of trust on both sides' according to the French representative,&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt; however, Roosevelt did make some concessions towards recognising the legitimacy of the Bayeux administration.

Meanwhile, with the Germans retreating in the face of the Allied onslaught, harried all the way by the resistance, there were widespread instances of revenge attacks on those accused of collaboration. A number of prominent officials and members of the feared [[Milice]] were murdered, often by exceptionally brutal means, provoking the Germans into appalling reprisals, such as in the destruction of the village of [[Oradour-sur-Glane]] and the killing of its 642 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=Macksey&gt;Macksey, Kenneth (1966) ''[[Purnell's History of the Second World War]]'': No. 123. "The Liberation of Paris"&lt;/ref&gt; 

Liberation of the French capital was not high on the Allies' list of priorities as it had comparatively little strategic value, but both de Gaulle and the commander of the French 2nd Armored Division, General [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque|Philippe Leclerc]] were still extremely concerned about a communist takeover. De Gaulle successfully lobbied for Paris to be made a priority for liberation on humanitarian grounds and obtained from Allied Supreme Commander General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] an agreement that French troops would be allowed to enter the capital first. A few days later, General Leclerc's division entered the outskirts of the city, and after [[Liberation of Paris|six days of fighting]] in which the resistance played a major part, the German garrison of 5000 men surrendered on 25 August, although some sporadic outbreaks of fighting continued for several days. General [[Dietrich von Choltitz]], the commander of the garrison, was instructed by Hitler to raze the city to the ground, however, he simply ignored the order and surrendered his forces.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

It was fortunate for de Gaulle that the Germans had forcibly removed members of the Vichy government and taken them to Germany a few days earlier on 20 August; it allowed him to enter Paris as a liberator in the midst of the general euphoria,&lt;ref name="Second World War 1966"&gt;Mondal, Jacques (1966) ''[[Purnell's History of the Second World War]]'': No. 72 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; but there were serious concerns that communist elements of the resistance, which had done so much to clear the way for the military, would try to seize the opportunity to proclaim their own 'Peoples' Government' in the capital. De Gaulle made contact with Leclerc and demanded the presence of the 2nd Armoured Division to accompany him on a massed parade down the [[Champs Elysees]], "as much for prestige as for security".&lt;ref name="Second World War 1966"/&gt; This was in spite of the fact that Leclerc's unit was fighting as part of the American 1st Army and were under strict orders to continue their next objective without obeying orders from anyone else. In the event, the American General [[Omar Bradley]] decided that Leclerc's division would be indispensable for the maintenance of order and the liquidation of the last pockets of resistance in the French capital. Earlier, on 21 August, de Gaulle had appointed his military advisor General [[Marie-Pierre Koenig]] as Governor of Paris.

As his procession came along the Place de la Concorde on Saturday 26 August, it came under machine gun fire by Vichy militia and [[fifth column]]ists who were unable to give themselves up. Later, on entering the [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] to be received as head of the provisional government by the Committee of Liberation, loud shots broke out again, and Leclerc and Koenig tried to hustle him through the door, but de Gaulle shook off their hands and never faltered. While the battle began outside, he walked slowly down the aisle. Before he had gone far a machine pistol fired down from above, at least two more joined in, and from below the [[Forces Françaises de l'Intérieur|FFI]] and police fired back. A BBC correspondent who was present reported;

{{quote|... the General is being presented to the people. He is being received...they have opened fire! ... firing started all over the place ... that was one of the most dramatic scenes I have ever seen. ... General de Gaulle walked straight ahead into what appeared to me to be a hail of fire ... but he went straight ahead without hesitation, his shoulders flung back, and walked right down the centre aisle, even while the bullets were pouring about him. It was the most extraordinary example of courage I have ever seen ... there were bangs, flashes all about him, yet he seemed to have an absolutely charmed life.&lt;ref&gt;''TIME'', 4 September 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later, in the great hall of the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]], de Gaulle was greeted by a jubilant crowd and, proclaiming the continuity of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]], delivered a famous proclamation;

{{quote|Paris! Paris outraged, Paris broken, Paris martyred, but Paris liberated! Liberated by itself, liberated by its people with the assistance of the armies of France, with the support and assistance of the whole of France! ... The enemy is faltering but he is not yet beaten. He is still on our soil. It will not suffice that we, with the assistance of our dear and admirable allies, will have chased him from our home in order to be satisfied after what has happened. We want to enter his territory, as is fitting, as conquerors. ... It is for this revenge, this vengeance and this justice, that we will continue to fight until the last day, until the day of the total and complete victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/accueil/discours/pendant-la-guerre-1940-1946/discours-de-l-hotel-de-ville-de-paris-25-aout-1944.php|title=Discours de l'Hôtel de Ville de Paris, 25 août 1944|publisher=charles-de-gaulle.org|accessdate=14 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127174456/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/accueil/discours/pendant-la-guerre-1940-1946/discours-de-l-hotel-de-ville-de-paris-25-aout-1944.php|archivedate=27 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

That evening, the Wehrmacht launched a massive aerial and artillery barrage of Paris in revenge, leaving several thousand dead or injured.&lt;ref name="Second World War 1966"/&gt; The situation in Paris remained tense, and a few days later de Gaulle, still unsure of the trend of events asked General Eisenhower to send some American troops into Paris as a show of strength. This he did 'not without some satisfaction',&lt;ref name="Second World War 1966"/&gt; and so, on 29 August, the US 28th Infantry Division was rerouted from its journey to the front line and paraded down the Champs Elysees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech made by General de Gaulle at the Hotel de Ville in Paris on August&amp;nbsp;25th 1944|publisher=Fondation Charles de Gaulle|year=2008|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=514|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216141748/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=514|archivedate=16 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same day, Washington and London agreed to accept the position of the Free French. The following day General Eisenhower gave his de facto blessing with a visit to the General in Paris.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==1944–1946: Provisional Government of Liberated France==
Roosevelt insisted that an [[Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories]] (AMGOT) should be implemented in France, but this was opposed by both the Secretary of War and the Under-Secretary for War, as well as by Eisenhower, who had been strongly opposed to the imposition of AMGOT in North Africa. Eisenhower, unlike Roosevelt, wanted to cooperate with de Gaulle, and he secured a last-minute promise from the President on the eve of D-Day that the Allied officers would not act as military governors and would instead cooperate with the local authorities as the Allied forces liberated French Territory. De Gaulle would later claim in his memoirs that he blocked AMGOT.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Munholland, ''Rock of Contention, Free French and Americans at War in New Caledonia 1940–1945'', Berghahn Books, New York, Oxford, 2005, p. 190.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Campaign in North-west Europe 1944-45 BU158.jpg|thumb|left|General de Gaulle with General Leclerc and other French officers at Montparnasse railway station in Paris, 25 August 1944]]

With the prewar parties and most of their leaders discredited, there was little opposition to de Gaulle and his associates forming an interim administration. In order not to be seen as presuming on his position in such austere times, de Gaulle did not use one of the grand official residences such as [[Hotel de Matignon]] or the presidential palace on the Elysee, but resided briefly in his old office at the War Ministry. When he was joined by his wife and daughters a short while later, they moved into a small state-owned villa on edge of [[Bois de Boulogne]] which had once been set aside for [[Hermann Göring]].&lt;ref name="Werth"&gt;De Gaulle. Alexander Werth (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

Living conditions immediately after the liberation were even worse than under German rule. About 25% of the city was in ruins and public services and fuel were almost nonexistent. Large-scale public demonstrations erupted all over France, protesting the apparent lack of action at improving the supply of food, while in Normandy, bakeries were pillaged. The problem was not French agriculture, which had largely continued operating without problems, but the near-total breakdown of the country's infrastructure. Large areas of track had been destroyed by bombing, most modern equipment, rolling stock, lorries and farm animals had been taken to Germany and all the bridges over the [[Seine]], the [[Loire]] and the [[Rhone]] between Paris and the sea had been destroyed. The black market pushed real prices to four times the level of 1939, causing the government to print money to try to improve the money supply, which only added to inflation.&lt;ref name=Werth/&gt;

On 10 November 1944, Churchill flew to Paris to a reception by de Gaulle and the two together were greeted by thousands of cheering Parisians on the next day.&lt;ref name="winstonchurchill.org"/&gt; [[Harold Nicolson]] stated that [[Anthony Eden]] told him that "not for one moment did Winston stop crying, and that he could have filled buckets by the time he received the Freedom of Paris."&lt;ref name="winstonchurchill.org"/&gt; He said "they yelled for Churchill in a way that he has never heard any crowd yell before. At an official luncheon de Gaulle said, "It is true that we would not have seen [the liberation] if our old and gallant ally England, and all the British dominions under precisely the impulsion and inspiration of those we are honouring today, had not deployed the extraordinary determination to win, and that magnificent courage which saved the freedom of the world. There is no French man or woman who is not touched to the depths of their hearts and souls by this."&lt;ref name="winstonchurchill.org"/&gt;

===Curbing the Communist Resistance===
After the celebrations had died down, de Gaulle began conferring with leading Resistance figures who, with the Germans gone, intended to continue as a political and military force, and asked to be given a government building to serve as their headquarters. The Resistance, in which the Communists were competing with other trends for leadership, had developed its own manifesto for social and political change known as the [[National Council of the Resistance]] (CNR) Charter, and wanted special status to enter the army under their own flags, ranks and honours. Despite their decisive support in backing him against Giraud, de Gaulle disappointed some of the Resistance leaders by telling them that although their efforts and sacrifices had been recognised, they had no further role to play and, that unless they joined the regular army, they should lay down their arms and return to civilian life.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;

Believing them to be a dangerous revolutionary force, de Gaulle moved to break up the liberation committees and other militias. The communists were not only extremely active, but they received a level of popular support that disturbed de Gaulle. As early as May 1943, the  US Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] had written to Roosevelt urging him to take action to attempt to curb the rise of communism in France.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun/&gt;

===The Provisional Government of the French Republic===
On 10 September 1944 the Provisional Government of the French Republic, or Government of National Unanimity formed. It included many of de Gaulle's Free French associates such as [[Gaston Palewski]], Claude Guy, [[Claude Mauriac]] and [[Jacques Soustelle]], together with members of the main parties, which included the [[French Section of the Workers' International|Socialists]] and a new Christian Democratic Party, the MRP under the leadership of Georges Bidault, who served as Foreign Minister. The president of the prewar Senate [[Jules Jeanneney]] was brought back as second-ranking member, but because of their links with Russia, de Gaulle allowed the Communists only two minor positions in his government. While they were now a major political force with over a million members, of the full cabinet of 22 men, only Augustin Laurent and [[Charles Tillon]]—who as head of [[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans]] had been one of the most active members of the resistance—were given ministries. However, de Gaulle did pardon the Communists' leader [[Maurice Thorez]], who had been sentenced to death ''in absentia'' by the French government for desertion. On his return home from Russia, Thorez delivered a speech supporting de Gaulle in which he said that for the present, the war against Germany was the only task that mattered.

There were also a number of new faces in the government, including a literary academic, [[Georges Pompidou]], who had written to one of de Gaulle's recruiting agents offering his services, and Jean Monnet, who in spite of his past opposition to the General now recognized the need for unity and served as Commissioner for Economic Planning. Of equal rank to ministers and answerable only to the prime minister, a number of Commissioners of the Republic (Commissaires de la République) were appointed to re-establish the democratic institutions of France and to extend the legitimacy of the provisional government. A number of former Free French associates served as commissioners, including [[Henri Fréville]], [[Raymond Aubrac]] and [[Michel Debré]], who was charged with reforming the civil service. Controversially, de Gaulle also appointed [[Maurice Papon]] as Commissioner for Aquitaine in spite of his involvement in the deportation of Jews while serving as a senior police official in the Vichy regime during the occupation. (Over the years, Papon remained in high official positions but continued to be implicated in controversial events such as the [[Paris massacre of 1961]],&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Mail'', 22 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; eventually being convicted of crimes against humanity in 1998.)

In social policy, legislation was introduced{{by whom|date=January 2016}} in February 1945 that provided for the establishment of works committees in all private industrial establishments employing more than 50 (originally more than 100) people.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers Encyclopaedia new edition, Volume V: Edward-Franks, George Newnes Ltd. 1959, supplementary information 1961, printed and bound in England by Hazel Watson and Viney Ltd., Aylesbury and Slough.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tour of major cities===
De Gaulle's policy was to postpone elections as long as 2.6 million French were in Germany as prisoners of war and forced laborers. In mid-September, he embarked upon a tour of major provincial cities to increase his public profile and to help cement his position. Although he received a largely positive reception from the crowds who came out to see him, he reflected that only a few months previously the very same people had come out to cheer Marshal Pétain when he was serving the Vichy regime. Raymond Aubrac said that the General showed himself to be ill-at-ease at social functions; in [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]] he became irate when he had to sit next to former Resistance leaders and also voiced his distaste for the rowdy, libidinous behavior of French youths during the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquisard]] parades which preceded his speech.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt; When he reached [[Toulouse]], de Gaulle also had to confront the leaders of a group which had proclaimed themselves to be the provincial government of the city.&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;

During the tour, de Gaulle showed his customary lack of concern for his own safety by mixing with the crowds and thus making himself an easy target for an assassin. Although he was naturally shy, the good use of amplification and patriotic music enabled him to deliver his message that though all of France was fragmented and suffering, together they would rise again. During every speech he would stop halfway through to invite the crowd to join him in singing ''La Marseillaise'', before continuing and finishing by raising his hands in the air and crying "Vive la France!"&lt;ref name=Werth/&gt;

===The legal purges (Épuration légale)===
As the war entered the final stages, the nation was forced to confront the reality of how many of its people had behaved under German rule. In France, collaborators were more severely punished than in most other occupied countries.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Perry, K. (1976) ''Modern European History'', W.H. Allen; {{ISBN|0750604824}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the liberation, countless women accused of aiding, abetting, and taking German soldiers as lovers were subjected to public humiliations such as being shaved bald and paraded through the streets in their underwear. Women who got this treatment were lucky as many others were simply attacked by lynch mobs. With so many of their former members having been hunted down and killed by the Nazis and paramilitary Milice, the Partisans had already summarily executed an estimated 4,500 people,&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; and the Communists in particular continued to press for severe action against collaborators. In Paris alone, over 150,000 people were at some time detained on suspicion of collaboration, although most were later released. Famous figures accused included the industrialist [[Louis Renault (industrialist)|Louis Renault]], the actress [[Arletty]], who had lived openly with a German officer in [[Hôtel Ritz Paris|the Ritz]], the opera star [[Tino Rossi]], the chanteuse [[Édith Piaf]], the stage actor [[Sacha Guitry]] and [[Coco Chanel]], who was briefly detained but fled to Switzerland.&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;

Keenly aware of the need to seize the initiative and to get the process under firm judicial control, de Gaulle appointed Justice Minister [[François de Menthon]] to lead the Legal Purge ([[Épuration légale]]) to punish traitors and to clear away the traces of the Vichy regime. Knowing that he would need to reprieve many of the 'economic collaborators'—such as police and civil servants who held minor roles under Vichy in order to keep the country running as normally as possible—he assumed, as head of state, the right to commute death sentences.&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt; Of the near 2,000 people who received the death sentence from the courts, fewer than 800 were executed. De Gaulle commuted 998 of the 1,554 capital sentences submitted before him, including all those involving women. Many others were given jail terms or had their voting rights and other legal privileges taken away. It is generally agreed that the purges were conducted arbitrarily, with often absurdly severe or overly lenient punishments being handed down.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt; It was also notable that the less well-off people who were unable to pay for lawyers were more harshly treated. As time went by and feelings grew less intense, a number of people who had held fairly senior positions under the Vichy government—such as Maurice Papon and [[René Bousquet]]—escaped consequences by claiming to have worked secretly for the resistance or to have played a double game, working for the good of France by serving the established order.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;

Later, there was the question of what to do with the former Vichy leaders when they were finally returned to France. Marshal Pétain and [[Maxime Weygand]] were war heroes from World War I and were now extremely old; convicted of treason, Pétain received a death sentence which his old protégé de Gaulle commuted to life imprisonment, while Weygand was eventually acquitted. Three Vichy leaders were executed. [[Joseph Darnand]], who became an SS officer and led the Milice paramilitaries who hunted down members of the Resistance, was executed in October 1945. [[Fernand de Brinon]], the third-ranking Vichy official, was found guilty of war crimes and executed in April 1947. The two trials of the most infamous collaborator of all, [[Pierre Laval]], who was heavily implicated in the murder of Jews, were widely criticised as being unfair for depriving him of the opportunity to properly defend himself, although Laval antagonized the court throughout with his bizarre behavior. He was found guilty of treason in May 1945 and de Gaulle was adamant that there would be no commuting the death sentence, saying that Laval's execution was "an indispensable symbolic gesture required for reasons of state". There was a widespread belief, particularly in the years that followed, that de Gaulle was trying to appease both the Third Republic politicians and the former Vichy leaders who had made Laval their scapegoat.&lt;ref name=Werth/&gt;

===Winter of 1944===
The winter of 1944{{ndash}}45 was especially difficult for most of the population. Inflation showed no sign of slowing down and food shortages were severe. The prime minister and the other Gaullists were forced to try to balance the desires of ordinary people and public servants for a return to normal life with pressure from Bidault's MRP and the Communists for the large scale nationalisation programme and other social changes that formed the main tenets of the CNR Charter. At the end of 1944 the coal industry and other energy companies were nationalised, followed shortly afterwards by major banks and finance houses, the merchant navy, the main aircraft manufacturers, airlines and a number of major private enterprises such as the [[Renault]] car company at [[Boulogne-Billancourt]], whose owner had been implicated as a collaborator and accused of having made huge profits working for the Nazis.&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt; In some cases, unions, feeling that things were not progressing quickly enough, took matters into their own hands, occupying premises and setting up workers' committees to run the companies.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt; Women were also allowed the vote for the first time, a new social security system was introduced to cover most medical costs, unions were expanded and price controls introduced to try to curb inflation. At de Gaulle's request, the newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' was founded in December 1944 to provide France with a quality daily journal similar to those in other countries. ''Le Monde'' took over the premises and facilities of the older ''[[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]]'', whose independence and reputation had been badly compromised during the Vichy years.&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;

During this period there were a number of minor disagreements between the French and the other Allies. The British ambassador to France [[Duff Cooper, 1st Viscount Norwich|Duff Cooper]] said that de Gaulle seemed to seek out real or imagined insults to take offence at whatever possible.&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt; De Gaulle believed Britain and the US were intending to keep their armies in France after the war and were secretly working to take over its overseas possessions and to prevent it from regaining its political and economic strength. In late October he complained that the Allies were failing to adequately arm and equip the new French army and instructed Bidault to use the French veto at the European Council.&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;

On Armistice Day in 1945, Winston Churchill made his first visit to France since the liberation and received a good reception in Paris where he laid a wreath to [[Georges Clemenceau]]. The occasion also marked the first official appearance of de Gaulle's wife Yvonne, but the visit was less friendly than it appeared. De Gaulle had instructed that there be no excessive displays of public affection towards Churchill and no official awards without his prior agreement. When crowds cheered Churchill during a parade down the Elysee, de Gaulle was heard to remark, "Fools and cretins! Look at the rabble cheering the old bandit".&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;

===Visit to the Soviet Union===
With the Russian forces making more rapid advances into German-held territory than the Allies, there was a sudden public realisation that the Soviet Union was about to dominate large parts of eastern Europe. In fact, at the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo]] and [[Tehran Conference]]s in 1943 Britain and America had already agreed to allow Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary to fall under the Soviet sphere of influence after the war, with shared influence in Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="Robottom"&gt;Robottom, John (1972) ''Modern Russia'', McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; The UK was to retain hegemony over Greece, although there had been no agreement over Poland, whose eastern territories were already in Soviet  hands under the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] with Germany, and which retained a government in exile in London.&lt;ref name=Robottom/&gt; De Gaulle had not been invited to any of the '[[Allies of World War II|Big Three]]' Conferences, although the decisions made by Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt in dividing up Europe were of huge importance to France.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

De Gaulle and his Foreign Minister Bidault stated that they were not in favour of a 'Western Bloc' that would be separate from the rest of Europe, and hoped that a resurgent France might be able to act as a 'third force' in Europe to temper the ambitions of the two emerging superpowers, America and Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun/&gt; He began seeking an audience with Stalin to press his 'facing both ways' policy, and finally received an invitation in late 1944. In his memoirs, de Gaulle devoted 24 pages to his visit to the Soviet Union, but a number of writers make the point that his version of events differs significantly from that of the Soviets, of foreign news correspondents, and with their own eye-witness accounts.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun/&gt;&lt;ref name=Werth/&gt;

De Gaulle wanted access to German coal in the [[Ruhr]] as reparations after the war, the left bank of the Rhine to be incorporated into French territory, and for the [[Oder-Neisse line]] in Poland to become Germany's official eastern border. De Gaulle began by requesting that France enter into a treaty with the Soviet Union on this basis, but Stalin, who remained in constant contact with Churchill throughout the visit, said that it would be impossible to make such an agreement without the consent of Britain and America. He suggested that it might be possible to add France's name to the existing [[Anglo-Soviet Agreement]] if they agreed to recognise the Soviet-backed provisional Polish government known as the [[Lublin Committee]] as rightful rulers of Poland, but de Gaulle refused on the grounds that this would be 'un-French', as it would mean it being a junior partner in an alliance.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt; During the visit, de Gaulle accompanied the deputy Soviet leader [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] on a tour of the former battleground at [[Stalingrad]], where he was deeply moved at the scene of carnage he witnessed and surprised Molotov by referring to "our joint sacrifice".&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;

Though the treaty which was eventually signed by Bidault and Molotov carried symbolic importance in that it enabled de Gaulle to demonstrate that he was recognised as the official head of state and show that France's voice was being heard abroad, it was of little relevance to Stalin due to France's lack of real political and military power; it did not affect the outcome of the post-war settlement. Stalin later commented that like Churchill and Roosevelt, he found de Gaulle to be awkward and stubborn and believed that he was 'not a complicated person' (by which he meant that he was an old-style nationalist).&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt; Stalin also felt that he lacked realism in claiming the same rights as the major powers and did not object to Roosevelt's refusal to allow de Gaulle to attend the 'Big Three' conferences that were to come at Yalta and Potsdam.

===Strasbourg===
At the end of 1944 French forces continued to advance as part of the American armies, but during the [[Ardennes Offensive]] there was a dispute over Eisenhower's order to French troops to evacuate [[Strasbourg]], which had just been liberated so as to straighten the defensive line against the German counterattack.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt; Strasbourg was an important political and psychological symbol of French sovereignty in [[Alsace and Lorraine]], and de Gaulle, saying that its loss would bring down the government, refused to allow a retreat, predicting that "Strasbourg will be our Stalingrad".&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt; 

By early 1945 it was clear that the price controls which had been introduced to control inflation had only served to boost the black market and prices continued to move ever upwards. By this time the army had swelled to over 1.2 million men and almost half of state expenditure was going to military spending.&lt;ref name=Werth/&gt; De Gaulle was faced with his first major ministerial dispute when the very able but tough-minded economics minister [[Pierre Mendès France]] demanded a programme of severe monetary reform which was opposed by the Finance Ministry headed by [[Aimé Lepercq|Aime Lepercq]], who favoured a programme of heavy borrowing to stimulate the economy.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt; When de Gaulle, knowing there would be little appetite for further austerity measures sided with Lepercq, Mendès France tendered his resignation, which was rejected because de Gaulle knew he needed him. Lepercq was killed in a road accident a short time afterwards and was succeeded by Pleven, but when in March, Mendès France asked unsuccessfully for taxes on capital earnings and for the blocking of certain bank accounts, he again offered his resignation and it was accepted.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;

===The Yalta Conference===

De Gaulle was never invited to the summit conferences of Allied leaders such as [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]] and [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam]]. He never forgave the Big Three leaders (Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin) for their neglect and continued to rage against it as having been a negative factor in European politics for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;

After the [[Operation Plunder|Rhine crossings]], the French First Army captured a large section of territory in southern Germany, but although this later allowed France to play a part in the signing of the German surrender, Roosevelt in particular refused to allow any discussion about de Gaulle participating in the Big Three conferences that would shape Europe in the post-war world. Churchill pressed hard for France to be included 'at the inter-allied table', but on 6 December 1944 the American president wired both Stalin and Churchill to say that de Gaulle's presence would "merely introduce a complicating and undesirable factor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Winston S. Churchill|title=Triumph and Tragedy: The Second World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VArC_rYqimoC&amp;pg=PA259|year=1950|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Yalta Conference in February 1945, despite Stalin's opposition, Churchill and Roosevelt insisted that France be allowed a post-war occupation zone in Germany, and also made sure that it was included among the five nations that invited others to the conference to establish the United Nations.&lt;ref name=Robottom /&gt; This was important because it guaranteed France a permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council]], a prestigious position that despite pressure from emerging nations it still holds today.

===President Truman===
On his way back from Yalta, Roosevelt asked de Gaulle to meet him in Algiers for talks. The General refused, believing that there was nothing more to be said, and for this he received a rebuke from [[Georges Bidault]] and from the French press, and a severely angered Roosevelt criticised de Gaulle to Congress. Soon after, on 12 April 1945, Roosevelt died, and despite their uneasy relationship de Gaulle declared a week of mourning in France and forwarded an emotional and conciliatory letter to the new American president, [[Harry S. Truman]], in which he said of Roosevelt, "all of France loved him".&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;

De Gaulle's relationship with Truman was to prove just as difficult as it had been with Roosevelt. With Allied forces advancing deep into Germany, another serious situation developed between American and French forces in [[Stuttgart]] and [[Karlsruhe]], when French soldiers were ordered to transfer the occupation zones to  US troops. Wishing to retain as much German territory in French hands as possible, de Gaulle ordered his troops, who were using American weapons and ammunition, to resist, and an armed confrontation seemed imminent.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt; Truman threatened to cut off supplies to the French army and to take the zones by force, leaving de Gaulle with little choice but to back down. De Gaulle never forgave Truman and hinted he would work closely with Stalin, leading Truman to tell his staff, "I don't like the son of a bitch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Offner|first=Arnold A.|title=Another Such Victory: President Truman and the Cold War, 1945–1953|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P5tbHSsBS-AC&amp;pg=PA51|year=2002|publisher=Stanford University Press|pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first visit by de Gaulle to Truman in the U.S. was not a success. Truman told his visitor that it was time that the French got rid of the Communist influence from its government, to which de Gaulle replied that this was France's own business.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt; But Truman, who admitted that his feelings towards the French were becoming 'less and less friendly', went on to say that under the circumstances, the French could not expect much economic aid and refused to accept de Gaulle's request for control of the west bank of the Rhine. During the argument which followed, de Gaulle reminded Truman that the US was using the French port of [[Nouméa]] in [[New Caledonia]] as a base against the Japanese.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;

===Victory in Europe===

In May 1945 the German armies surrendered to the Americans and British at Rheims, and a separate armistice was signed with France in Berlin.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; De Gaulle refused to allow any British participation in the victory parade in Paris. However, among the vehicles that took part was an ambulance from the [[Hadfield-Spears Ambulance Unit]], staffed by French doctors and British nurses. One of the nurses was Mary Spears, who had set up the unit and had worked almost continuously since the [[Battle of France]] with Free French forces in the Middle East, North Africa and Italy. Mary's husband was General [[Edward Spears]], the British liaison to the Free French who had personally spirited de Gaulle to safety in Britain in 1940. When de Gaulle saw the [[Union Flag]]s and [[Flag of France|Tricolours]] side by side on the ambulance, and heard French soldiers cheering, "Voilà Spears! Vive Spears!", he ordered that the unit be closed down immediately and its British staff sent home. A number of French troops returned their medals in protest and Mary wrote, "it is a pitiful business when a great man suddenly becomes small."&lt;ref&gt;''The Day the War Ended''. London. Martin Gilbert (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another confrontation with the Americans broke out soon after the armistice when the French sent troops to occupy the French-speaking Italian border region of [[Val d'Aoste]]. The French commander threatened to open fire on American troops if they tried to stop them, and an irate Truman ordered the immediate end to all arms shipments to France. Truman sent de Gaulle an angry letter saying that he found it unbelievable that the French could threaten to attack American troops after they had done so much to liberate France.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun/&gt;

However, de Gaulle was generally well received in the United States immediately after World War II and supported the United States in public comments. He visited New York City on 27 August 1945 to great welcome by thousands of people of the city and its mayor [[Fiorello LaGuardia]].&lt;ref name="wnyc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/charles-de-gaulle-city-hall-reception/|title=Charles de Gaulle City Hall Reception|publisher=WNYC|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gettyimages.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/french-general-charles-de-gaulle-flanked-by-new-york-mayor-news-photo/102263730 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140814192955/http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/french-general-charles-de-gaulle-flanked-by-new-york-mayor-news-photo/102263730 |archivedate=14 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On that day, de Gaulle wished "Long live the United States of America". He visited [[New York City Hall]] and Idlewild Airport (now [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]), and presented LaGuardia with the Grand Croix of the [[Legion of Honour]] award.&lt;ref name="wnyc.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gettyimages.com"/&gt;

===Confrontation in Syria and Lebanon===
{{further|Levant Crisis}}
On [[VE Day]], there were also serious riots in French Tunisia. A dispute with Britain over control of Syria and Lebanon quickly developed into an unpleasant diplomatic incident that demonstrated France's weaknesses. In May, de Gaulle sent General Beynet to establish an air base in Syria and a naval base in Lebanon, provoking an outbreak of nationalism in which some French nationals were attacked and killed. On 20 May, French artillery and warplanes fired on demonstrators in [[Damascus]]. After several days, upwards of 800 Syrians lay dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Meir Zamir|title=The Secret Anglo-French War in the Middle East: Intelligence and Decolonization, 1940–1948|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TE6cBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|pages=126–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Churchill's relationship with de Gaulle was now at rock bottom. In January he told a colleague that he believed that de Gaulle was "a great danger to peace and for Great Britain. After five years of experience, I am convinced that he is the worst enemy of France in her troubles ... he is one of the greatest dangers to European peace.... I am sure that in the long run no understanding will be reached with General de Gaulle".&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;{{RP|287}}

On 31 May, Churchill told de Gaulle "immediately to order French troops to cease fire and withdraw to their barracks". British forces moved in and forced the French to withdraw from the city; they were then escorted and confined to barracks.&lt;ref name="Wall"&gt;Wall p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; With this political pressure added, the French ordered a ceasefire; De Gaulle raged but France was isolated and suffering a diplomatic humiliation. The secretary of the [[Arab League]] [[Edward Atiyah]] said, "France put all her cards and two rusty pistols on the table".&lt;ref&gt;''TIME'' 25 June 1945&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle saw it as a heinous [[Anglo-Saxon]] conspiracy: he told the British ambassador [[Duff Cooper]], "I recognise that we are not in a position to wage war against you, but you have betrayed France and betrayed the West. That cannot be forgotten".&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010" /&gt;{{RP|42–47}}

===The Potsdam Conference===
At the [[Potsdam Conference]] in July, to which de Gaulle was not invited, a decision was made to divide Vietnam, which had been a French colony for over a hundred years, into British and Chinese spheres of influence.&lt;ref name=Robottom /&gt; Soon after the surrender of Japan in August 1945, de Gaulle sent the [[French Far East Expeditionary Corps]] to re-establish French sovereignty in [[French Indochina]].  However, the resistance leaders in Indo-China proclaimed the freedom and independence of Vietnam, and [[First Indochina War|a civil war]] broke out that lasted until France was defeated in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Stein Tønnesson, ''The Vietnamese revolution of 1945: Roosevelt, Ho Chi Minh, and De Gaulle in a world at war'' (Sage, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

===New elections and resignation===
Since the liberation, the only parliament in France had been an enlarged version of the Algiers Consultative Assembly, and at last, in October 1945, elections were held for a new Constituent Assembly whose main task was to provide a new constitution for the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]. De Gaulle favoured a strong executive for the nation,{{r|time19590105}} but all three of the main parties wished to severely restrict the powers of the president. The Communists wanted an assembly with full constitutional powers and no time limit, whereas de Gaulle, the Socialists and the [[Popular Republican Movement]] (MRP) advocated one with a term limited to only seven months, after which the draft constitution would be submitted for another referendum.&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Footitt and John Simmonds. ''France, 1943–1945'' (1988) pp 228–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[French legislative election, 1945|election]],  the second option was approved by 13 million of the 21 million voters. The big three parties won 75% of the vote, with the Communists winning 158 seats, the MRP 152 seats, the Socialists 142 seats and the remaining seats going to the various far right parties.

On 13 November 1945, the new assembly unanimously elected Charles de Gaulle head of the government, but problems immediately arose when it came to selecting the cabinet, due to his unwillingness once more to allow the Communists any important ministries. The Communists, now the largest party and with their charismatic leader Maurice Thorez back at the helm, were not prepared to accept this for a second time, and a furious row ensued, during which de Gaulle sent a letter of resignation to the speaker of the Assembly and declared that he was unwilling to trust a party that he considered to be an agent of a foreign power (Russia) with authority over the police and armed forces of France.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun/&gt;

Eventually, the new cabinet was finalised on 21 November, with the Communists receiving five out of the twenty-two ministries, and although they still did not get any of the key portfolios. De Gaulle believed that the draft constitution placed too much power in the hands of parliament with its shifting party alliances. One of his ministers said he was "a man equally incapable of monopolizing power as of sharing it".&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Matthews, ''The death of the Fourth Republic'' (1954)p 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle outlined a programme of further nationalisations and a new economic plan which were passed, but a further row came when the Communists demanded a 20 percent reduction in the military budget. Refusing to "rule by compromise", de Gaulle once more threatened to resign. There was a general feeling that he was trying to blackmail the assembly into complete subservience by threatening to withdraw his personal prestige which he insisted was what alone kept the ruling coalition together.&lt;ref name=Werth/&gt; Although the MRP managed to broker a compromise which saw the budget approved with amendments, it was little more than a stop-gap measure.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun/&gt;

Barely two months after forming the new government, de Gaulle abruptly resigned on 20 January 1946. The move was called "a bold and ultimately foolish political ploy", with de Gaulle hoping that as a war hero, he would be soon brought back as a more powerful executive by the French people.&lt;ref name="Hitchcock 2004 112"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Europe: The Turbulent History of a Divided Continent 1945 to the Present|first=William I.|last=Hitchcock|publisher=Random House|year=2004|isbn=0-385-49799-7|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fFfhnC4mYccC&amp;pg=PT112}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that did not turn out to be the case. With the war finally over, the initial period of crisis had passed. Although there were still shortages, particularly of bread, France was now on the road to recovery, and de Gaulle suddenly did not seem so indispensable. The Communist publication ''Combat'' wrote, "There was no cataclysm, and the empty plate didn't crack".&lt;ref name=Werth/&gt;

==1946–1958: Out of power==
[[File:Charles de Gaulle Quotation 2011.jpg|thumb|The statement of Charles de Gaulle in reference to World War II]]
After monopolizing French politics for six years, Charles de Gaulle suddenly dropped out of sight, and returned to his home to write his war memoirs. De Gaulle had told [[Pierre Bertaux]] in 1944 that he planned to retire because "France may still one day need an image that is pure ... If [[Joan of Arc]] had married, she would no longer have been Joan of Arc".&lt;ref name="cate196011"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1960/11/charles-de-gaulle-the-last-romantic/306916/ | title=Charles de Gaulle: The Last Romantic | work=The Atlantic | date=November 1960 | accessdate=2 August 2016 | author=Cate, Curtis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famous opening paragraph of ''Mémoires de guerre'' begins by declaring, "All my life, I have had a certain idea of France (''une certaine idée de la France'')",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fenby|first1=Jonathan|title=The General: Charles De Gaulle And The France He Saved|date=2010|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=1847373925|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8467526-the-general|accessdate=19 November 2017|quote=De Gaulle did not invent the phrase; it was used by the writer [[Maurice Barrès]] in ''Mes Cahiers'' (1920)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|2}} comparing his country to an old painting of a Madonna, and ends by declaring that, given the divisive nature of French politics, France cannot truly live up to this ideal without a policy of "grandeur". During this period of formal retirement, however, de Gaulle maintained regular contact with past political lieutenants from wartime and ''RPF'' days, including sympathizers involved in political developments in French Algeria, becoming "perhaps the best-informed man in France".{{r|time19590105}}

In April 1947, de Gaulle made a renewed attempt to transform the political scene by creating a ''[[Rassemblement du Peuple Français]]'' (Rally of the French People, or ''RPF''), which he hoped would be able to move above the familiar party squabbles of the parliamentary system. Despite the new party's taking 40 percent of the vote in local elections and 121 seats in 1951, lacking its own press and access to television, its support ebbed away. In May 1953, he withdrew again from active politics,{{r|time19590105}} though the ''RPF'' lingered until September 1955.&lt;ref name="Grolier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grolier.com/wwii/wwii_degaulle.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050223083920/http://www.grolier.com/wwii/wwii_degaulle.html|archivedate=23 February 2005|title=Charles de Gaulle|work=Grolier Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with all colonial powers France began to lose its overseas possessions amid the surge of nationalism.  [[French Indochina]] (now Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia), colonised by France during the mid-19th century, had been lost to the Japanese after the defeat of 1940. De Gaulle had intended to hold on to France's Indochina colony, ordering the parachuting of French agents and arms into Indochina in late 1944 and early 1945 with orders to attack the Japanese as American troops hit the beaches.&lt;ref&gt;Karnow pp. 143–4&lt;/ref&gt; Although de Gaulle had moved quickly to consolidate French control of the territory during his brief first tenure as president in the 1940s, the communist [[Vietminh]] under [[Ho Chi Minh]] began a determined campaign for independence from 1946 onwards. The French fought a bitter seven year war (the [[First Indochina War]]) to hold on to Indochina. It was largely funded by the United States and grew increasingly unpopular, especially after the stunning defeat at the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]]. France pulled out that summer under Prime Minister [[Pierre Mendès France]].

The independence of Morocco and Tunisia was arranged by Mendès France and proclaimed in March 1956. Meanwhile, in Algeria some 350,000 French troops were fighting 150,000 combatants of the Algerian Liberation Movement (FLN). Within a few years, the Algerian war of independence reached a summit in terms of savagery and bloodshed and threatened to spill into metropolitan France itself.

Between 1946 and 1958 the Fourth Republic had 24 separate ministries. Frustrated by the endless divisiveness, de Gaulle famously asked "How can you govern a country which has 246 varieties of cheese?"&lt;ref&gt;''Time'', 16 March 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

===1958: Collapse of the Fourth Republic===
{{Further information|May 1958 crisis}}

The [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] was wracked by political instability, failures in [[French Indochina|Indochina]], and inability to resolve the [[Algerian War of Independence|Algerian question]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Sowerwine, France since 1870: Culture, Society and the Making of the Republic (2009) ch 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin S. Alexander and John FV Keiger, eds. ''France and the Algerian War, 1954–1962: Strategy, Operations and Diplomacy'' (Routledge, 2013)&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 May 1958, the [[Pied-Noir]] settlers seized the government buildings in Algiers, attacking what they saw as French government weakness in the face of demands among the Arab majority for Algerian independence. A "Committee of Civil and Army Public Security" was created under the presidency of General [[Jacques Massu]], a Gaullist sympathiser. General [[Raoul Salan]], Commander-in-Chief in Algeria, announced on radio that he was assuming provisional power, and appealed for confidence in himself.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, and Keiger, eds. ''France and the Algerian War, 1954–1962: Strategy, Operations and Diplomacy'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

At a 19 May press conference, de Gaulle asserted again that he was at the disposal of the country. As a journalist expressed the concerns of some who feared that he would violate civil liberties, de Gaulle retorted vehemently: "Have I ever done that? On the contrary, I have re-established them when they had disappeared. Who honestly believes that, at age 67, I would start a career as a dictator?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alice L. Conklin|title=France and Its Empire Since 1870|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sFXwAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA281|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=281|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A constitutionalist by conviction, he maintained throughout the crisis that he would accept power only from the lawfully constituted authorities. De Gaulle did not wish to repeat the difficulty the Free French movement experienced in establishing legitimacy as the rightful government. He told an aide that the rebel generals "will not find de Gaulle in their baggage".{{r|time19590105}}

The crisis deepened as French paratroops from Algeria seized [[Corsica]] and a landing near Paris was discussed ([[Operation Resurrection]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=General Massu – Obituary|newspaper=The Times|date=29 October 2002|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article818845.ece|place=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political leaders on many sides agreed to support the General's return to power, except [[François Mitterrand]], [[Pierre Mendès France]], [[Alain Savary]], the [[Communist Party (France)|Communist Party]], and certain other leftists.

On 29 May the French President, [[René Coty]] told parliament that the nation was on the brink of civil war, so he was 'turning towards the most illustrious of Frenchmen, towards the man who, in the darkest years of our history, was our chief for the reconquest of freedom and who refused dictatorship in order to re-establish the Republic. I ask General de Gaulle to confer with the head of state and to examine with him what, in the framework of Republican legality, is necessary for the immediate formation of a government of national safety and what can be done, in a fairly short time, for a deep reform of our institutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Fenby|title=The General: Charles De Gaulle and the France He Saved |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qzVrCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA396|year=2013|page=396}}&lt;/ref&gt;  De Gaulle accepted Coty's proposal under the precondition that a new constitution would be introduced creating a powerful presidency in which a sole executive, the first of which was to be himself, ruled for seven-year periods. Another condition was that he be granted [[state of emergency|extraordinary powers]] for a period of six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W.

De Gaulle remained intent on replacing the weak constitution of the Fourth Republic. He is sometimes described as the author of the [[Constitution of France|new constitution]], as he commissioned it and was responsible for its overall framework. The actual drafter of the text was [[Michel Debré]] who wrote up de Gaulle's political ideas and guided the text through the enactment process. On 1 June 1958, de Gaulle became Prime Minister and was given emergency powers for six months by the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gen de Gaulle given a majority of 105 – Full powers demanded for six months|newspaper=The Times|date=2 June 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; fulfilling his desire for parliamentary legitimacy.{{r|time19590105}}

On 28 September 1958, a [[French constitutional referendum, 1958|referendum]] took place and 79.2 percent of those who voted supported the new constitution and the creation of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]]. The [[French Colonial Empire|colonies]] (Algeria was officially a part of France, not a colony) were given the choice between immediate independence and the new constitution. All African colonies voted for the new constitution and the replacement of the [[French Union]] by the [[French Community]], except [[Guinea]], which thus became the first French African colony to gain independence and immediately lost all French assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sweeping Vote for General de Gaulle – 4:1 Majority says "Yes" to new Constitution|newspaper=The Times|date=29 September 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1958–1962: Founding of the Fifth Republic==
In the [[French legislative election, 1958|November 1958 elections]], de Gaulle and his supporters (initially organised in the ''Union pour la Nouvelle République-Union Démocratique du Travail'', then the ''Union des Démocrates pour la Vème République'', and later still the ''[[Union des Démocrates pour la République]]'', UDR) won a comfortable majority. In December, de Gaulle was [[French presidential election, 1958|elected President by the electoral college]] with 78% of the vote, and inaugurated in January 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Landslide Vote Repeated for de Gaulle – President of Fifth Republic – Sweeping Powers|newspaper=The Times|date=22 December 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle oversaw tough economic measures to revitalise the country, including the issuing of a new [[franc]] (worth 100 old francs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Year Brings in New Franc|newspaper=The Times|date=2 January 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, he rebuffed both the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], pushing for an independent France with its own [[nuclear weapon]]s, and strongly encouraged a "Free Europe", believing that a confederation of all European nations would restore the past glories of the great European empires.&lt;ref name="Crawley-1969" /&gt;{{RP|411,428}}

He set about building [[Franco-German cooperation]] as the cornerstone of the [[European Community|European Economic Community]] (EEC), paying the first [[state visit]] to [[West Germany|Germany]] by a French head of state since [[Napoleon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Germans Give General de Gaulle a Hero's Welcome|newspaper=The Times|date=6 September 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1963, Germany and France signed a treaty of friendship, the [[Élysée Treaty]].&lt;ref name="Crawley-1969" /&gt;{{RP|422}} France also reduced its dollar reserves, trading them for gold from the US government, thereby reducing American economic influence abroad.&lt;ref name="Crawley-1969" /&gt;{{RP|439}}

On 23 November 1959, in a speech in [[Strasbourg]], de Gaulle announced his vision for Europe:
{{quote|Oui, c'est l'Europe, depuis l'Atlantique jusqu'à l'Oural, c'est toute l'Europe, qui décidera du destin du monde.

''("Yes, it is Europe, from the [[Atlantic]] to the [[Urals]], it is the whole of Europe, that will decide the destiny of the world.")''}}
His expression, "Europe, from the Atlantic to the Urals", has often been cited throughout the history of [[European integration]]. It became, for the next ten years, a favourite political rallying cry of de Gaulle's. His vision stood in contrast to the [[Atlanticism]] of the United States and Britain, preferring instead a Europe that would act as a third [[polarity (power)|pole]] between the United States and the Soviet Union. By including in his ideal of Europe all the territory up to the Urals, de Gaulle was implicitly offering [[détente]] to the Soviets.
As the last chief of government of the Fourth Republic, de Gaulle made sure that the [[Treaty of Rome]] creating the [[European Economic Community]] was fully implemented, and that the British project of Free Trade Area was rejected, to the extent that he was sometimes considered as a "Father of Europe" &lt;ref&gt; Warlouzet, 'De Gaulle as a Father of Europe' in ''Contemporary European History'', 2011 [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/contemporary-european-history/article/de-gaulle-as-a-father-of-europe-the-unpredictability-of-the-ftas-failure-and-the-eecs-success-195658/A2D1FB241EA0C9675E326029F1C8BFC0] &lt;/ref&gt;

===Algeria===
{{further information|Algerian War}}
Upon becoming president, de Gaulle was faced with the urgent task of finding a way to bring to an end the bloody and divisive war in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Sowerwine, ''France since 1870: Culture, Society and the Making of the Republic'' (2009) pp 296–316&lt;/ref&gt;  His intentions were obscure. He had immediately visited Algeria and declared, ''Je vous ai compris''—'I have understood you', and each competing interest had wished to believe it was them that he had understood. The settlers assumed he supported them, and would be stunned when he did not. In Paris, the left wanted independence for Algeria. Although the military's near-coup had contributed to his return to power, de Gaulle soon ordered all officers to quit the rebellious Committees of Public Safety. Such actions greatly angered the pieds-noirs and their military supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Harrison, ''Challenging De Gaulle: The OAS and the Counterrevolution in Algeria, 1954–1962'' (Praeger, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

He faced uprisings in Algeria by the pied-noirs and the French armed forces. On assuming the prime minister role in June 1958 he immediately went to Algeria, and neutralised the army there, with its 600,000 soldiers. The Algiers Committee of Public Safety was loud in its demands on behalf of the settlers, but de Gaulle made more visits and sidestepped them. For the long term he devised a plan to modernize Algeria's traditional economy, deescalated the war, and offered Algeria self-determination in 1959. A [[Algerian War#The week of barricades|pied-noir revolt in 1960]] failed, while another [[Algiers putsch of 1961|attempted coup]] failed in April 1961. French voters approved his course in [[French referendum on Algerian self-determination, 1961|a 1961 referendum on Algerian self-determination]]. De Gaulle arranged a cease-fire in Algeria with the March 1962 [[Evian Accords]], legitimated by another [[French Évian Accords referendum, 1962|referendum]] a month later. It gave victory to the FLN, which came to power and declared independence. The long crisis was over.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Evans, ''Algeria: France's Undeclared War'' (2012) [https://www.amazon.com/Algeria-Frances-Undeclared-Making-Modern/dp/0192803506/ excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Algerian issue was settled, Prime Minister Michel Debré resigned over the final settlement and was replaced with [[Georges Pompidou]] on 14 April 1962. France recognised Algerian independence on 3 July 1962, while a blanket amnesty law was belatedly voted in 1968, covering all crimes committed by the French army during the war. In just a few months in 1962, 900,000 ''[[Pied-Noir]]s'' left the country. After 5 July, the exodus accelerated in the wake of the French deaths during the [[Oran massacre of 1962]].

===Assassination attempts===
[[File:General charles de gaulle visite isles sur suippe 1963.jpg|thumb|Charles de Gaulle's motorcade passes through [[Isles-sur-Suippe]] ([[Marne]]), the president salutes the crowd from his famous [[Citroën DS]]]]

De Gaulle was targeted for death by the [[Organisation armée secrète]] (OAS), in retaliation for his Algerian initiatives. Several assassination attempts were made on him; the most famous took place on 22 August 1962, when he and his wife narrowly escaped from an organized machine gun [[ambush]] on their [[Citroën DS#In popular culture|Citroën DS limousine]]. De Gaulle commented "Ils tirent comme des cochons" ("They shoot like pigs").&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mould. [https://books.google.com/books?id=x-FNTmUwfpEC&amp;pg=PA331&amp;lpg=PA331&amp;dq=ils+tirent+comme+des+cochons&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hT_OirPa2S&amp;sig=9Q4Q7k2XUYHBCC3XKFcrGWVB6GI&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwismar2qeLOAhWFDxoKHbUcDTcQ6AEISDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=ils%20tirent%20comme%20des%20cochons&amp;f=false ''The Routledge Dictionary of Cultural References in Modern French''], p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; The attack was arranged by Colonel [[Jean Bastien-Thiry#Assassination attempt|Jean-Marie Bastien-Thiry]] at [[Clamart|Petit-Clamart]].&lt;ref name="Crawley-1969" /&gt;{{RP|381}} [[Frederick Forsyth]] used this incident as a basis for his novel ''[[The Day of the Jackal]]''.

===Direct presidential elections===

In September 1962, de Gaulle sought a constitutional amendment to allow the president to be directly elected by the people and issued another [[French presidential election referendum, 1962|referendum to this end]]. After a [[motion of censure]] voted by the parliament on 4 October 1962, de Gaulle dissolved the National Assembly and held [[French legislative election, 1962|new elections]]. Although the left progressed, the Gaullists won an increased majority—this despite opposition from the Christian democratic [[Popular Republican Movement]] (MRP) and the [[National Centre of Independents and Peasants]] (CNIP) who criticised de Gaulle's [[euroscepticism]] and [[presidentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=De Gaulle Challenge to Parliament – To Retire if Referendum not Approved – Call to Nation before Debate on Censure Motion|newspaper=The Times|date=5 October 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=De Gaulle against the Politicians – Clear Issue for October Referendum – Assembly Election Likely after Solid Censure Vote|newspaper=The Times|date=6 October 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle's proposal to change the election procedure for the French presidency was approved at the referendum on 28 October 1962 by more than three-fifths of voters despite a broad "coalition of no" formed by most of the parties, opposed to a presidential regime. Thereafter the president was to be elected by direct universal suffrage for the first time since Louis Napoleon in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Yes" Reply for Gen. De Gaulle – Over 60 p.c. of Valid Votes – President Likely to Keep Office|newspaper=The Times|date=29 October 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1962–1968: Politics of grandeur==
With the Algerian conflict behind him, de Gaulle was able to achieve his two main objectives, the reform and development of the French economy, and the promotion of an independent foreign policy and a strong presence on the international stage. This was named by foreign observers the "politics of grandeur" (''politique de grandeur'').&lt;ref name="Kolodziej"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kolodziej|first=Edward A|title=French International Policy under de Gaulle and Pompidou: The Politics of Grandeur|year=1974|page=618}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Gaullism]].

==="Thirty glorious years"===
{{refimprove section|date=June 2016}}
In the immediate post-war years France was in poor shape;&lt;ref name=Macksey/&gt; wages remained at around half prewar levels, the winter of 1946–1947 did extensive damage to crops, leading to a reduction in the bread ration, hunger and disease remained rife and the black market continued to flourish. Germany was in an even worse position, but after 1948 things began to improve dramatically with the introduction of [[Marshall Aid]]—large scale American financial assistance given to help rebuild European economies and infrastructure. This laid the foundations of a meticulously planned program of investments in energy, transport and heavy industry, overseen by the government of Prime Minister [[Georges Pompidou]].

In the context of a population boom unseen in France since the 18th century, the government intervened heavily in the economy, using ''[[dirigisme]]''—a unique combination of free-market and state-directed economy—with indicative five-year plans as its main tool. This was followed by a rapid transformation and expansion of the French economy.

High-profile projects, mostly but not always financially successful, were launched: the extension of [[Marseille]]'s harbour (soon ranking third in Europe and first in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]); the promotion of the [[Sud Aviation Caravelle|Caravelle]] passenger jetliner (a predecessor of [[Airbus]]); the decision to start building the supersonic Franco-British [[Concorde]] airliner in [[Toulouse]]; the expansion of the French auto industry with state-owned [[Renault]] at its centre; and the building of the first motorways between Paris and the provinces.

Aided by these projects, the French economy recorded growth rates unrivalled since the 19th century. In 1964, for the first time in nearly 100 years&lt;ref&gt;France's GDP was slightly higher than the UK's at the beginning of the 19th century, with the UK surpassing France around 1870. See e.g., {{cite book|last=Maddison|first=Angus|title=L'économie mondiale 1820–1992: analyse et statistiques|year=1995|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=92-64-24549-9|page=248|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A5BFpqBqQ_gC&amp;lpg=PA248}}&lt;/ref&gt; France's GDP overtook that of the United Kingdom. This period is still remembered in France with some nostalgia as the peak of the ''[[Trente Glorieuses]]'' ("Thirty Glorious Years" of economic growth between 1945 and 1974).&lt;ref name="Haine"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haine|first=W. Scott|title=Culture and Customs of France|year=1974|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006|place=Westport CT|isbn=0-313-32892-7|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, de Gaulle decreed a law that obliged all firms over certain sizes to distribute a small portion of their profits to their employees. By 1974, as a result of this measure, French employees received an average of 700 francs per head, equivalent to 3.2% of their salary.&lt;ref&gt;The New France: A Society in Transition 1945–1977 (Third Edition) by John Ardagh&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth nuclear power===

During his first tenure as president, de Gaulle became enthusiastic about the possibilities of nuclear power. France had carried out important work in the early development of atomic energy and in October 1945 he established the French Atomic Energy Commission [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique]], (CEA) responsible for all scientific, commercial, and military uses of nuclear energy. However, partly due to communist influences in government opposed to proliferation, research stalled and France was excluded from American, British and Canadian nuclear efforts.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

By October 1952, the United Kingdom had become the third country—after the United States and the Soviet Union—to independently test and develop nuclear weapons. This gave Britain the capability to launch a nuclear strike via its [[Vulcan bomber]] force and they began developing a ballistic missile program known as [[Blue Streak (missile)|Blue Streak]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

As early as April 1954 while out of power, de Gaulle argued that France must have its own nuclear arsenal; at the time nuclear weapons were seen as a national status symbol and a way of maintaining international prestige with a place at the 'top table' of the United Nations. Full-scale research began again in late 1954 when Prime Minister Pierre Mendès France authorized a plan to develop the atomic bomb; large deposits of [[uranium]] had been discovered near [[Limoges]] in central France, providing the researchers with an unrestricted supply of nuclear fuel. France's independent [[Force de Frappe]] (strike force) came into being soon after de Gaulle's election with his authorization for the first nuclear test.

With the cancellation of Blue Streak, the  US agreed to supply Britain with its [[GAM-87 Skybolt|Skybolt]] and later [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] weapons systems, and in 1958 the two nations signed the Mutual Defence Agreement forging close links which have seen the  US and UK cooperate on nuclear security matters ever since. Although at the time it was still a full member of NATO, France proceeded to develop its own independent nuclear technologies—this would enable it to become a partner in any reprisals and would give it a voice in matters of atomic control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marshal Juin Defended – General de Gaulle on Moral Issue|newspaper=The Times|date=8 April 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FS Redoutable.jpg|thumb|The ''[[FS Redoutable|Redoutable]]'', the first French nuclear missile submarine.]]

After six years of effort, on 13 February 1960 France became the [[France and nuclear weapons|world's fourth nuclear power]] when a high-powered [[Gerboise Bleue|nuclear device]] was exploded in the [[Sahara]] some 700 miles south-south-west of Algiers.&lt;ref name="Weekend of Rejoicing in France"&gt;{{cite news|title=Weekend of Rejoicing in France|newspaper=The Times|date=15 February 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1963 France decided against signing the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] designed to slow the arms race because it would have prohibited it from testing nuclear weapons above ground. France continued to carry out tests at the Algerian site until 1966, under an agreement with the newly independent Algeria. France's testing program then moved to the Mururoa and Fangataufa Atolls in the South Pacific.

In November 1967, an article by the French Chief of the General Staff (but inspired by de Gaulle) in the ''Revue de la Défense Nationale'' caused international consternation. It was stated that French nuclear force should be capable of firing "in all directions"—thus including even America as a potential target. This surprising statement was intended as a declaration of French national independence, and was in retaliation to a warning issued long ago by [[Dean Rusk]] that  US missiles would be aimed at France if it attempted to employ atomic weapons outside an agreed plan. However, criticism of de Gaulle was growing over his tendency to act alone with little regard for the views of others.&lt;ref&gt;Ledwidge p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; In August, concern over de Gaulle's policies had been voiced by [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] when he queried 'the solitary exercise of power'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Independents Fear for France's Future – Gaullist Policy Queried|newspaper=The Times|date=18 August 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NATO===

With the onset of the Cold War and the perceived threat of invasion from the [[Soviet Union]] and the countries of the [[eastern bloc]], the United States, Canada and a number of western European countries set up the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) to co-ordinate a military response to any possible attack. France played a key role during the early days of the organisation, providing a large military contingent and agreeing—after much soul-searching—to the participation of West German forces. But after his election in 1958 Charles de Gaulle took the view that the organisation was too dominated by the  US and UK, and that America would not fulfill its promise to defend Europe in the event of a Soviet invasion.

De Gaulle demanded political parity with Britain and America in NATO, and for its geographic coverage to be extended to include French territories abroad, including Algeria, then experiencing civil war. This was not forthcoming, and so in March 1959 France, citing the need for it to maintain its own independent military strategy, withdrew its Mediterranean Fleet (ALESCMED) from NATO, and a few months later de Gaulle demanded the removal of all  US nuclear weapons from French territory.

De Gaulle hosted a superpower summit on 17 May 1960 for arms limitation talks and détente efforts in the wake of the [[1960 U-2 incident]] between United States President [[Dwight Eisenhower]], Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]], and United Kingdom Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]].&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; De Gaulle's warm relations with Eisenhower were noticed by United States military observers at that time. De Gaulle told Eisenhower: "Obviously you cannot apologize but you must decide how you wish to handle this. I will do everything I can to be helpful without being openly partisan." When Khrushchev condemned the United States U-2 flights, de Gaulle expressed to Khrushchev his disapproval of 18 near-simultaneous secret Soviet satellite overflights of French territory; Khrushchev denied knowledge of the satellite overflights. Lieutenant General Vernon A. Walters wrote that after Khrushchev left, "De Gaulle came over to Eisenhower and took him by the arm. He took me also by the elbow and, taking us a little apart, he said to Eisenhower, 'I do not know what Khrushchev is going to do, nor what is going to happen, but whatever he does, I want you to know that I am with you to the end.' I was astounded at this statement, and Eisenhower was clearly moved by his unexpected expression of unconditional support". General Walters was struck by de Gaulle's "unconditional support" of the United States during that "crucial time".&lt;ref name=j1&gt;{{cite journal|author=Walter, Vernon A.|year=2007|origyear=1974|title=General De Gaulle in Action: 1960 Summit Conference|journal=Studies in Intelligence|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|volume=38|issue=5|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/95unclass/Walters.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle then tried to revive the talks by inviting all the delegates to another conference at the [[Élysée Palace]] to discuss the situation, but the summit ultimately dissolved in the wake of the U-2 incident.&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/17/newsid_2512000/2512335.stm 1960: East-West summit in tatters after spy plane row]. BBC.co.uk; accessed 7 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, de Gaulle visited the Soviet Union, where he hoped to establish France as an alternative influence in the Cold War. De Gaulle always viewed Communism as a passing phenomenon, and never used the term 'Soviet Union', always calling it Russia. In his view, Russian national interests rather than Communist ideology determined the decision-making in the Kremlin. Later, he proclaimed a new alliance between the nations, but although Soviet premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] later visited Paris, the Soviets clearly did not consider France a superpower and knew that they would remain dependent on the NATO alliance in the event of a war. In 1965, de Gaulle pulled France out of [[SEATO]], the southeast Asian equivalent of NATO, and refused to participate in any future NATO maneuvers.

In February 1966, France withdrew from the [[NATO Military Command Structure]], but remained within the organisation. De Gaulle, haunted by the memories of 1940, wanted France to remain the master of the decisions affecting it, unlike in the 1930s when it had to follow in step with its British ally. He also ordered all foreign military personnel to leave France within a year.&lt;ref name="Crawley-1969" /&gt;{{RP|431}} This latter action was particularly badly received in the US, prompting [[Dean Rusk]], the US Secretary of State, to ask de Gaulle whether the removal of American military personnel was to include exhumation of the 50,000 American war dead buried in French cemeteries.&lt;ref name="FontanaHistory"&gt;Holland, Robert (1991) ''Fontana History of England – Britain &amp; the World Role''&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Economic Community (EEC)===
{{refimprove section|date=June 2016}}

France, experiencing the disintegration of its [[French colonial Empire|colonial empire]] and severe problems in Algeria, turned towards Europe after [[Suez Crisis]], and to West Germany in particular.&lt;ref name="FontanaHistory" /&gt; In the years after, the economies of both nations integrated and they led the drive towards European unity.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

One of the conditions of Marshall Aid was that the nations' leaders must co-ordinate economic efforts and pool the supply of raw materials. By far the most critical commodities in driving growth were coal and steel. France assumed it would receive large amounts of high-quality German coal from the Ruhr as reparations for the war, but the US refused to allow this, fearing a repetition of the bitterness after the Treaty of Versailles which partly caused World War II.&lt;ref name=Macksey/&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F011021-0002, Köln, Staatsbesuch de Gaulle, Begrüßung Adenauer.jpg|thumb|upright|left|De Gaulle and [[Konrad Adenauer]] in 1961]]

Under the inspiration of the French statesmen [[Jean Monnet]] and [[Robert Schuman]], together with the German leader [[Konrad Adenauer]], the rift between the two nations had begun to heal and along with Italy and the [[Benelux]] countries, they formed the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which following the [[Treaty of Rome]] of 1957 became the [[European Economic Community]], also known as the Common Market, launched soon before de Gaulle's return to power.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

De Gaulle had not been instrumental in setting up the new organization and, from the start, he opposed efforts by fellow EEC member countries to move toward some form of political integration that, in de Gaulle's thinking, would impinge on the sovereignty of France, both internally and externally. To counter those supranational tendencies that he disparaged,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw3U4Tbp7fQ&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=De Gaulle avait compris avant tout le monde que l'UE était une arnaque|date=23 March 2014|accessdate=14 January 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; he put forward in 1961 the so-called [[Fouchet Plan]] that maintained all decision-making powers in the hands of governments, reducing the projected European parliamentary assembly to a mere consultative assembly. As expected, the plan was rejected by France's partners. In July 1965 de Gaulle provoked a major six-month crisis when he ordered the boycott of EEC institutions (see ''Empty chair crisis'' below) until his demands – the withdrawal of a European Commission proposal to reinforce the community institutions to the detriment of national sovereignty, and the acceptance of France's proposal regarding the financing of the newly established Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) – were met with the [[Luxembourg compromise]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

[[File:Charles de Gaulle con Arturo Frondizi.jpg|thumb|Charles de Gaulle and Argentine president [[Arturo Frondizi]]]]

De Gaulle, who in spite of recent history admired Germany and spoke excellent German,&lt;ref name="Debray"&gt;[[Régis Debray]] (1994) ''Charles de Gaulle: Futurist of the Nation'' translated by John Howe, Verso, New York, {{ISBN|0-86091-622-7}}; a translation of Debray, Régis (1990) ''A demain de Gaulle'' Gallimard, Paris, {{ISBN|2-07-072021-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ihZkpI3n5hIC&amp;pg=PA38|title=Charles de Gaulle's Legacy of Ideas|work=google.fr|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; established a good relationship with the aging West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer—culminating in the [[Elysee Treaty]] in 1963—and in the first few years of the Common Market, France's industrial exports to the other five members tripled and its farm export almost quadrupled. The franc became a solid, stable currency for the first time in half a century, and the economy mostly boomed. Adenauer however, all too aware of the importance of American support in Europe, gently distanced himself from the general's more extreme ideas, wanting no suggestion that any new European community would in any sense challenge or set itself at odds with the  US In Adenauer's eyes, the support of the  US was more important than any question of European prestige.&lt;ref name="TIME-8 August 1960"&gt;''Time'', 8 August 1960&lt;/ref&gt; Adenauer was also anxious to reassure Britain that nothing was being done behind its back and was quick to inform British Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] of any new developments.

Great Britain initially declined to join the Common Market, preferring to remain with another organisation known as the [[European Free Trade Area]], mostly consisting of the northern European countries and Portugal. By the late 1950s German and French living standards began to exceed those in Britain, and the government of Harold Macmillan, realising that the EEC was a stronger trading bloc than EFTA, began negotiations to join.

De Gaulle vetoed the British application to join the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) in 1963, famously uttering the single word 'non' into the television cameras at the critical moment, a statement used to sum up French opposition towards Britain for many years afterwards.&lt;ref name="R+Q"&gt;Richards, Denis &amp; Quick, Antony (1974) ''Twentieth Century Britain''&lt;/ref&gt; Macmillan said afterwards that he always believed that de Gaulle would prevent Britain joining, but thought he would do it quietly, behind the scenes. He later complained privately that "all our plans are in tatters".&lt;ref name="FontanaHistory" /&gt;

[[File:Fpdegaulle.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Iranian Empress [[Farah Pahlavi]] meeting with Charles de Gaulle in France, 1961]]

American President [[John F. Kennedy]] urged de Gaulle to accept the United Kingdom in the EEC, stating that a Europe without Great Britain would create a situation in which the United States were bearing the enormous costs of Europe's protection without any voice. He threatened de Gaulle to withdraw American troops from European soil, but de Gaulle knew that the United States would lose the [[Cold War]] if they were to leave Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yltz0aCPaM4C&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=de+gaulle+germany+counterweight+kennedy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-myVxdMbgd&amp;sig=SvaCrNxeTMETsB1hmmuJHHtoJU8&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAmoVChMI1sy5homjxwIVZv9yCh0uMwGx#v=onepage&amp;q=de%20gaulle%20germany%20counterweight%20kennedy&amp;f=false|title=Between Empire and Alliance|work=google.be|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It encouraged de Gaulle to see Great Britain as America's "[[Trojan Horse]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biographie 1962–1968: la consolidation du régime|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=375|work=Fondation Charles de Gaulle|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522001018/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=375|archivedate=22 May 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Prime Minister Churchill once said to him that if he had the choice between France and the United States, he would always choose the United States. As it appears that Churchill's successor, [[Harold Macmillan]], prioritised the rebuilding of the Anglo-American "[[Special Relationship]]", with the recent American agreement to supply Britain with the Skybolt nuclear missile, it persuaded de Gaulle that the United Kingdom lacked the necessary political will to adhere to his bid for a West European strategic independence from the United States.&lt;ref name="ECC"&gt;{{Cite news|title=How the EU was built|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1055729.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=5 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Capet, Aïssatou Sy-Wonyu, ''The "Special Relationship"'', p. 218 [https://books.google.com/books?id=QpHzjq-KqnkC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=relationship+de+gaulle+churchill&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zBbZVM7IE4P4UubKg5gN&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=relationship%20de%20gaulle%20churchill&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained there were incompatibilities between continental European and British economic interests. In addition, he demanded that the United Kingdom accept all the conditions laid down by the six existing members of the EEC (Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands) and revoke its commitments to countries within its own free trade area (which France had not done with its own). He supported a deepening and an acceleration of Common Market integration rather than an expansion.&lt;ref name="veto"&gt;{{cite web|title=European NAvigator (ENA) – General de Gaulle's first veto|url=http://www.ena.lu/general_gaulle_veto-020100862.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in this latter respect, a detailed study of the formative years of the EEC argues that the defence of French economic interests, especially in agriculture, in fact played a more dominant role in determining de Gaulle's stance towards British entry than the various political and foreign policy considerations that have often been cited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moravscik|first=Andrew|title=The Choice for Europe: Social Purpose and State Power from Messina to Maastricht|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2008|isbn=0-8014-3509-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dean Acheson believed that Britain made a grave error in not signing up to the European idea right from the start, and that they continued to suffer the political consequences for at least two decades afterwards. However he also stated his belief that de Gaulle used the 'Common Market' (as it was then termed) as an "exclusionary device to direct European trade towards the interest of France and against that of the United States, Britain and other countries."&lt;ref name="Presentat"&gt;''Present at the Creation: My Years in the State Department'' – Dean Acheson 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

Claiming continental European solidarity, de Gaulle again rejected British entry when they next applied to join the community in December 1967 under the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] leadership of [[Harold Wilson]]. During negotiations, de Gaulle chided Britain for relying too much on the Americans, saying that sooner or later they would always do what was in their best interests. Wilson said he then gently raised the spectre of the threat of a newly powerful Germany as a result of the EEC, which de Gaulle agreed was a risk.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Wilson Autobiography&lt;/ref&gt; After de Gaulle left office the United Kingdom applied again and finally became a member of the EEC in January 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Just a Normal Winter's Day in Dover|newspaper=The Times|date=2 January 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition of the People's Republic of China===

In January 1964, France was the first among the Western powers to open diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC), which was established in 1949 and which was isolated on the international scene.&lt;ref name="atimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/KA08Ad01.html|title=Asia Times Online :: China News, China Business News, Taiwan and Hong KongNews and Business.|work=Asia Times|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By recognizing [[Mao Zedong]]'s government, de Gaulle signaled to both Washington and Moscow that France intended to deploy an independent foreign policy.&lt;ref name="atimes.com"/&gt; The move was criticized in the United States as it seemed to seriously damage  US policy of [[containment]] in Asia.&lt;ref name="atimes.com"/&gt; De Gaulle justified this action by "the weight of evidence and reason", considering that China's demographic weight and geographic extent put it in a position to have a global leading role.&lt;ref name="atimes.com"/&gt; De Gaulle also used this opportunity to arouse rivalry between the USSR and China, a policy that was followed several years later by [[Henry Kissinger]]'s "triangular diplomacy" which also aimed to create a Sino-Soviet split.&lt;ref name="atimes.com"/&gt;

France established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China – the first step towards formal recognition without first severing links with the Republic of China (Taiwan), led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Hitherto the PRC had insisted that all nations abide by a "one China" condition, and at first it was unclear how the matter would be settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Recognition of Peking by France – Relations with two regimes – Chiang protest but no break|newspaper=The Times|date=28 January 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the agreement to exchange ambassadors was subject to a delay of three months, and in February, Chiang Kai-shek resolved the problem by cutting off diplomatic relations with France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chiang Breaks with France|newspaper=The Times|date=11 February 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight years later,  US President [[Richard Nixon]] [[Nixon visit to China 1972|visited the PRC]] and began normalising relations—a policy which was confirmed in the [[Shanghai Communiqué]] of 28 February 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nixon's China's Visit and "Sino-U.S. Joint Communiqué|url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/ziliao/3602/3604/t18006.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of a European tour, Nixon visited France in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=De Gaulle's Warm Welcome to Nixon|newspaper=The Times|date=1 March 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and de Gaulle both shared the same non-Wilsonian approach to world affairs, believing in nations and their relative strengths, rather than in ideologies, international organisations, or multilateral agreements. De Gaulle is famously known for calling the UN the [[pejorative]] "[[:fr:Machin|le Machin]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citations et petites phrases du général de Gaulle – de A à Z|work=Fondation Charles de Gaulle|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=497|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118165817/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=497|archivedate=18 November 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("the thingamajig").

===Visit to Latin America===
[[File:Illiadegaulle.jpg|thumb|De Gaulle and Argentine president [[Arturo Illia]] in 1964]]

During the autumn of 1964, de Gaulle embarked on a grueling 20,000-mile trek across Latin America despite being a month away from his 75th birthday, a recent operation for [[prostate cancer]], and concerns over security. He had visited Mexico the previous year and spoke, in Spanish, to the Mexican people on the eve of their celebrations of their independence at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|Palacio Nacional]] in Mexico City. During his new 26-day visit, he was again keen to gain both cultural and economic influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gen. De Gaulle Takes His Legend To S. America – 40 Speeches To Be Made During 20,000-Mile Tour|newspaper=The Times|date=18 September 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke constantly of his resentment of  US influence in Latin America—"that some states should establish a power of political or economic direction outside their own borders". Yet France could provide no investment or aid to match that from Washington.&lt;ref name="Crawley-1969" /&gt;{{RP|427}}

===US dollar crisis===

In the [[Bretton Woods system]] put in place in 1944,  US dollars were convertible to gold. In France, it was called "[[Exorbitant privilege|America's exorbitant privilege]]"&lt;ref name="books.google.fr"&gt;Barry Eichengreen, ''Exorbitant Privilege: The Rise and Fall of the Dollar and the Future of the International monetary system''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TIlpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=america%27s+exorbitant+privilege&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vgCGVJejH4OUas7ngqAI&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=america's%20exorbitant%20privilege&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; as it resulted in an "asymmetric financial system" where foreigners "see themselves supporting American living standards and subsidizing American multinationals". As American economist [[Barry Eichengreen]] summarized: "It costs only a few cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce a $100 bill, but other countries had to pony up $100 of actual goods in order to obtain one".&lt;ref name="books.google.fr"/&gt; In February 1965 President Charles de Gaulle announced his intention to exchange its  US dollar reserves for gold at the official exchange rate. He sent the French Navy across the Atlantic to pick up the French reserve of gold and was followed by several countries. As it resulted in considerably reducing  US gold stock and  US economic influence, it led  US President [[Richard Nixon]] to unilaterally end the convertibility of the dollar to gold on 15 August 1971 (the "[[Nixon Shock]]"). This was meant to be a temporary measure but the dollar became permanently a floating [[fiat money]] and in October 1976, the  US government officially changed the definition of the dollar; references to gold were removed from statutes.&lt;ref&gt;Eugène White, Dominique Simard, Michael Bordo, ''La France et le système monétaire de Bretton Woods '' [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/ecofi_0987-3368_1993_num_26_3_2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Garritsen de Vries, ''The International Monetary Fund, 1966–1971'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=5oUS9M1kzOEC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=de+gaulle+french+gold+1965&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WQCGVO2xOcvtasyigagO&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=de%20gaulle%20french%20gold%201965&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second term==
In December 1965, de Gaulle [[French presidential election, 1965|returned as president for a second seven-year term]]. In the first round he did not win the expected majority, only receiving 45% of the vote. Both of his main rivals did better than expected; the leftist [[François Mitterrand]] received 32% and [[Jean Lecanuet]], who advocated for what ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' described as "Gaullism without de Gaulle", received 16%.&lt;ref name="life19651217"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HUwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;pg=PA4|title=De Gaulle Has an Opposition|work=Life|date=17 December 1965|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won a majority in the second round, with Mitterrand receiving 45%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=France Again Elects Gen. De Gaulle – M. Mitterrand Concedes Within 80 Minutes – Centre Votes Evenly Divided|newspaper=The Times|date=20 December 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1966, in a famous speech in [[Phnom Penh]] in Cambodia, he expressed France's disapproval of the  US involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], calling for a  US withdrawal from Vietnam as the only way to ensure peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Allocution prononcée à la réunion populaire de Phnom-Penh, 1er septembre 1966|trans-title=Address by the President of the French Republic (General de Gaulle), Phnom Penh, Cambodia, 1 September 1966|publisher=Fondation Charles de Gaulle|year=2008|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=530|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118225154/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=530|archivedate=18 November 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, de Gaulle conversed frequently with [[George Ball (diplomat)|George Ball]], United States President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s [[Under Secretary of State]], and told Ball that he feared that the United States risked repeating France's tragic experience in Vietnam, which de Gaulle called "''ce pays pourri''" ("the rotten country"). Ball later sent a 76-page memorandum to Johnson critiquing Johnson's current Vietnam policy in October 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Karnow p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle later visited [[Guadeloupe]] for two days, in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Inez]], bringing aid which totaled billions of [[francs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legendshub.com/politics/gaulle/second.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316025030/http://www.legendshub.com/politics/gaulle/second.html |archivedate=16 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Empty Chair Crisis===

During the establishment of the [[European Community]], de Gaulle helped precipitate the Empty Chair Crisis, one of the greatest crises in the history of the EEC. It involved the financing of the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], but almost more importantly the use of [[qualified majority voting]] in the EC (as opposed to unanimity). In June 1965, after France and the other five members could not agree, de Gaulle withdrew France's representatives from the EC. Their absence left the organisation essentially unable to run its affairs until the [[Luxembourg compromise]] was reached in January 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=France Ends Boycott of Common Market – No Winners or Losers after Midnight Agreement|newspaper=The Times|date=31 January 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle succeeded in influencing the decision-making mechanism written into the Treaty of Rome by insisting on solidarity founded on mutual understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=De Gaulle and Europe|work=Fondation Charles de Gaulle|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=178|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118185240/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=178|archivedate=18 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He vetoed Britain's entry into the EEC a second time, in June 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European NAvigator (ENA) – General de Gaulle's second veto|url=http://www.ena.lu/general_gaulles_second_veto-020102622.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Six-Day War===
With tension rising in the Middle East in 1967, de Gaulle on 2 June declared an arms embargo against Israel, just three days before the outbreak of the [[Six-Day War]]. This, however, did not affect spare parts for the French military hardware with which the Israeli armed forces were equipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=French Emphasis on Long-Term Issues|newspaper=The Times|date=7 June 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was an abrupt change in policy. In 1956 France, Britain and Israel had cooperated in an elaborate effort to retake the [[Suez Canal]] from Egypt. Israel's air force operated French [[Mirage (aircraft)|Mirage]] and [[Dassault Mystère|Mystère]] jets in the Six-Day War, and its navy was building its new missile boats in [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]]. Though paid for, their transfer to Israel was now blocked by de Gaulle's government. But they were smuggled out in an operation that drew further denunciations from the French government. The last boats took to the sea in December 1969, directly after a major deal between France and now-independent Algeria exchanging French armaments for Algerian oil.&lt;ref&gt;Geller, Doron {{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/Cherbourg.html |title=The Cherbourg Boats |accessdate=2015-05-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509103831/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/Cherbourg.html |archivedate=9 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under de Gaulle, following the independence of Algeria, France embarked on foreign policy more favorable to the [[Arab]] side. President de Gaulle's position in 1967 at the time of the Six-Day War played a part in France's new-found popularity in the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=De Gaulle and the Third World|work=Fondation Charles de Gaulle|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=180|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118185135/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=180|archivedate=18 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel turned towards the United States for arms, and toward its own industry. In a televised news conference on 27 November 1967, de Gaulle described the Jewish people as "this elite people, sure of themselves and domineering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/28101|title=France-Israel: from De Gaulle's arms embargo to Sarkozy's election|publisher=Ejpress.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902234843/http://www.ejpress.org/article/28101 |archivedate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his letter to [[David Ben-Gurion]] dated 9 January 1968, he explained that he was convinced that Israel had ignored his warnings and overstepped the bounds of moderation by taking possession of Jerusalem, and Jordanian, Egyptian, and Syrian territory by force of arms. He felt Israel had exercised repression and expulsions during the occupation and that it amounted to annexation. He said that provided Israel withdrew its forces, it appeared that it might be possible to reach a solution through the UN framework which could include assurances of a dignified and fair future for refugees and minorities in the Middle East, recognition from Israel's neighbours, and freedom of navigation through the Gulf of Aqaba and the Suez Canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/01/10/archives/text-of-de-gaulles-answer-to-letter-from-bengurion.html?sq=de+Gaulle+dignified+minorities&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p|title=Text of de Gaulle's Answer to Letter From Ben-Gurion|work=The New York Times|date=10 January 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigerian Civil War===
The Eastern Region of Nigeria declared itself independent under the name of the Independent Republic of [[Biafra]] on 30 May 1967. On 6 July the first shots in the [[Nigerian Civil War]] were fired, marking the start of a conflict that lasted until January 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=920 Days of Fighting, Death and Hunger|newspaper=The Times|date=12 January 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UK|Britain]] provided military aid to the Federal Republic of Nigeria—yet more was made available by the [[Soviet Union]]. Under de Gaulle's leadership, France embarked on a period of interference outside the traditional French zone of influence. A policy geared toward the break-up of Nigeria put Britain and France into opposing camps. Relations between France and Nigeria had been under strain since the third French nuclear explosion in the [[Sahara]] in December 1960. From August 1968, when its embargo was lifted, France provided limited and covert support to the breakaway province. Although French arms helped to keep Biafra in action for the final 15 months of the civil war, its involvement was seen as insufficient and counterproductive. The Biafran chief of staff stated that the French "did more harm than good by raising false hopes and by providing the British with an excuse to reinforce Nigeria."&lt;ref name="Saha"&gt;{{cite book|last=Saha|first=Santosh C.|title=Perspectives on Contemporary Ethnic Conflict: Primal Violence Or the Politics of Conviction?|year=2006|publisher=Lexington Books|place=Lanham MD|isbn=0-7391-1085-3|pages=184, 344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Vive le Québec libre!''===
{{Main article|Vive le Québec libre}}
In July 1967, de Gaulle visited Canada, which was celebrating its centenary with a [[world's fair|world fair]] in Montreal, [[Expo 67]]. On 24 July, speaking to a large crowd from a balcony at [[Montreal]]'s city hall, de Gaulle shouted "Vive le Québec libre! Vive le Canada français! Et vive la France!" (Long live free Quebec! Long live French Canada, and long live France!).&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite news|last=Depoe |first=Norman |title=Vive le Québec libre! |work=On This Day |publisher=CBC News |date=24 July 1967 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/language-culture/language-culture-general/vive-le-quebec-ibre.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69Oj6PyT2?url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/language-culture/language-culture-general/vive-le-quebec-libre.html |archivedate=24 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian media harshly criticized the statement, and the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Lester B. Pearson]], stated that "Canadians do not need to be liberated".&lt;ref name="Pearson rebukes De Gaulle"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gillan|first=Michael|title=Words unacceptable to Canadians: De Gaulle Rebuked by Pearson|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=26 July 1967|place=Toronto|pages=1, 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle left Canada abruptly two days later, without proceeding to [[Ottawa]] as scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;George Sherman, "De Gaulle Ends Visit in Canadian Dispute," ''[[The_Washington_Star|The Evening Star]]'', July 26, 1967, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He never returned to Canada.

The event however was seen as a watershed moment by the [[Quebec sovereignty movement]],&lt;ref name="10-years later, Lévesque"&gt;{{cite news|title=Levesque pays tribute to Charles de Gaulle|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=d1RVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gT4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=charles%20de%20gaulle%20vive%20le%20quebec%20libre%20speech%201967&amp;pg=3782%2C11903|newspaper=The Leader-Post|date=1 November 1977|agency=Reuters|place=Regina, Saskatchewan|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is still a significant milestone of Quebec's history to the eyes of most Quebecers.&lt;ref name=ce&gt;{{cite web|title=De Gaulle and "Vive le Québec Libre" |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia |year=2012 |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/de-gaulle-and-vive-le-quebec-libre-feature/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119182931/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Params=A1ARTFET_E53 |archivedate=19 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following year, de Gaulle visited [[Brittany]], where he declaimed a poem written by his uncle (also called [[Charles de Gaulle (poet)|Charles de Gaulle]]) in the [[Breton language]]. The speech followed a series of crackdowns on [[Breton nationalism]]. De Gaulle was accused of hypocrisy, on the one hand supporting a "free" Quebec because of linguistic and ethnic differences from other Canadians, while on the other hand suppressing a regional and ethnic nationalist movement in Brittany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Peter Berresford|authorlink=Peter Berresford Ellis|title=The Celtic Dawn: A History of Pan Celticism|publisher=Constable|year=1993|place=London|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official visit to Poland===
General de Gaulle paid an official visit to Poland on 6 September 1967 and spent an entire week there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polskieradio.pl/39/156/Artykul/678704,Polska-wiwatuje-na-czesc-Charles%E2%80%99a-de-Gaulle%E2%80%99a|title=Polska wiwatuje na cześć Charles’a de Gaulle’a|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle described it as his "pilgrimage to Poland" and visited Warsaw, Gdańsk, [[Kraków]] and German death camp [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]]. He met with crowds of people on the streets and shouted (in Polish) "Long live Poland! Our dear, noble and brave Poland!". Without discussion, de Gaulle announced that France officially recognized the [[Oder-Neisse territory|new Polish western border]] established in 1945.

===May 1968===
{{Main article|May 1968 in France}}

De Gaulle's government was criticized within France, particularly for its heavy-handed style. While the written press and elections were free, and private stations such as [[Europe 1]] were able to broadcast in French from abroad, the state's [[Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française|ORTF]] had a monopoly on television and radio. This monopoly meant that the government was in a position to directly influence broadcast news. In many respects, Gaullist France was conservative, Catholic, and there were few women in high-level political posts (in May 1968, the government's ministers were 100% male).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Les femmes et le pouvoir|url=http://www.histoire-politique.fr/index.php?numero=01&amp;rub=dossier&amp;item=7|quote=of the first eleven governments of the Fifth Republic, four contained no women whatsoever.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many factors contributed to a general weariness of sections of the public, particularly the student youth, which led to the events of May 1968.

The mass demonstrations and strikes in France in May 1968 severely challenged De Gaulle's legitimacy. He and other government leaders feared that the country was on the brink of revolution or civil war. On 29 May, De Gaulle disappeared without notifying Prime Minister Pompidou or anyone else in the government, stunning the country. He fled to [[Baden-Baden]] in Germany to meet with General Massu, then head of the French military there, to discuss possible army intervention against the protesters. De Gaulle returned to France after being assured of the military's support, in return for which De Gaulle agreed to amnesty for the 1961 coup plotters and OAS members.&lt;ref name="dogan1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dogan|first=Mattei|title=How Civil War Was Avoided in France|journal=International Political Science Review / Revue internationale de science politique|year=1984|volume=5|issue=3|pages=245–277|jstor=1600894|doi=10.1177/019251218400500304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Autocrat of the Grand Manner|newspaper=The Times|date=28 April 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a private meeting discussing the students' and workers' demands for direct participation in business and government he coined the phrase "La réforme oui, la [[chienlit]] non", which can be politely translated as 'reform yes, masquerade/chaos no.' It was a [[vernacular]] [[scatological]] [[pun]] meaning '[[chienlit|chie-en-lit]], no' (crap-in-bed, no). The term is now common parlance in French political commentary, used both critically and ironically referring back to de Gaulle.&lt;ref&gt;Crawley (p. 454) also writes that de Gaulle was undoubtedly using the term in his barrack-room style to mean 'shit in the bed'. De Gaulle had said it first in Bucharest while on an official visit from which he returned on 19 May 1968. Pompidou told the press that de Gaulle used the phrase after the cabinet meeting on 19 May.&lt;/ref&gt;

But de Gaulle offered to accept some of the reforms the demonstrators sought. He again considered a referendum to support his moves, but on 30 May, Pompidou persuaded him to dissolve parliament (in which the government had all but lost its majority in the March 1967 elections) and hold new elections instead. The June 1968 elections were a major success for the Gaullists and their allies; when shown the spectre of revolution or civil war, the majority of the country rallied to him. His party won 352 of 487 seats,&lt;ref name="Dropping the Pilot"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dropping the Pilot|newspaper=The Times|date=11 July 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; but de Gaulle remained personally unpopular; a survey conducted immediately after the crisis showed that a majority of the country saw him as too old, too self-centered, too authoritarian, too conservative, and too [[anti-American]].{{r|dogan1984}}

De Gaulle resigned the presidency at noon, 28 April 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release re Resignation|work=Fondation Charles de Gaulle|year=2008|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=532|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118225651/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=532|archivedate=18 November 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the rejection of his proposed reform of the Senate and local governments [[French constitutional referendum, 1969|in a nationwide referendum]]. In an eight-minute televised speech two days before the referendum,  De Gaulle warned that if he was "disavowed" by a majority of the voters, he would resign his office immediately. This ultimatum, coupled with increased de Gaulle fatigue among the French,  convinced many that this was an opportunity to be rid of the 78-year-old general and the reform package was rejected. Two months later [[Georges Pompidou]] was elected as his successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Serge Berstein|author2=Jean-Pierre Rioux|title=The Pompidou Years, 1969–1974|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_GyhQAJeOZoC&amp;pg=PA5|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge UP|pages=4–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle retired once again to his beloved nine-acre country estate, La Boisserie (the woodland glade), in [[Colombey-les-Deux-Églises]], 120 miles southeast of Paris. There the General, who often described old age as a "shipwreck,"&lt;ref name="TIME-23 November 1970"&gt;''TIME'', 23 November 1970&lt;/ref&gt; continued his memoirs, dictated to his secretary from notes. To visitors, de Gaulle said, "I will finish three books, if God grants me life." ''The Renewal'', the first of three planned volumes to be called ''Memoirs of Hope'', was quickly finished and immediately became the fastest seller in French publishing history.

===Personal life===
[[File:La Boisserie 04.jpg|thumb|De Gaulle's home, La Boisserie, in [[Colombey-les-Deux-Églises]]]]

Charles de Gaulle married [[Yvonne de Gaulle|Yvonne Vendroux]] on 7 April 1921 in [[Église Notre-Dame de Calais]]. They had three children: [[Philippe de Gaulle|Philippe]] (born 1921), Élisabeth (1924–2013), who married General [[Alain de Boissieu]], and [[Anne de Gaulle|Anne]] (1928–1948). Anne had [[Down syndrome|Down's syndrome]] and died of pneumonia at the age of 20. De Gaulle always had a particular love for Anne; one Colombey resident recalled how he used to walk with her hand-in-hand around the property, caressing her and talking quietly about the things she understood.&lt;ref name="TIME-23 November 1970"/&gt;

Charles de Gaulle had an older brother Xavier (1887–1955) and sister Marie-Agnes (1889–1983), and two younger brothers, Jacques (1893–1946) and Pierre (1897–1959). He was particularly close to the youngest, Pierre, who so resembled him that presidential bodyguards often saluted him by mistake when he visited his famous brother or accompanied him on official visits.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

One of Charles de Gaulle's grandsons, also named [[Charles de Gaulle (born 1948)|Charles de Gaulle]], was a [[member of the European Parliament]] from 1994 to 2004, his last tenure being for the [[National Front (France)|National Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Listes de Gaulle|work=Parti socialiste français|url=http://www.psinfo.net/elections/municipales/2001/pariscopie/listes/fn.php3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061119070209/http://www.psinfo.net/elections/municipales/2001/pariscopie/listes/fn.php3|archivedate=19 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The younger Charles de Gaulle's move to the anti-Gaullist Front National was widely condemned by other family members, in open letters and newspaper interviews. "It was like hearing the pope had converted to Islam", one said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-politique/2007-01-23/la-famille-qui-a-dit-non/917/0/71275 La famille qui a dit non].

===Death===
On 9 November 1970, less than two weeks short of what would have been his 80th birthday, Charles de Gaulle died suddenly, despite enjoying very robust health his entire life (except for a [[prostate]] operation a few years earlier). He had been watching the evening news on television and playing [[Solitaire]] around 7:40&amp;nbsp;p.m. when he suddenly pointed to his neck and said, "I feel a pain right here", and then collapsed. His wife called the doctor and the local priest, but by the time they arrived he had died from a [[aneurysm|ruptured blood vessel]].&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news|title=World Leaders to Gather in Paris to Honour General de Gaulle|newspaper=The Times|date=11 November 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife asked that she be allowed to inform her family before the news was released. She was able to contact her daughter in Paris quickly, but their son, who was in the [[French Navy|navy]], was difficult to track down, so President [[Georges Pompidou]] was not informed until 4&amp;nbsp;am the next day and announced the general's death on television some 18 hours after the event. He simply said, "''Le général de Gaulle est mort; la France est veuve.''" ("General de Gaulle is dead. France is a widow.")

[[File:TombeauChdG.JPG|thumb|Grave of Charles de Gaulle at [[Colombey-les-Deux-Églises]]]]

De Gaulle had made arrangements that insisted his funeral be held at Colombey, and that no presidents or ministers attend his funeral—only his ''[[Compagnons de la Libération]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Testament de Charles de Gaulle, 16&amp;nbsp;janvier 1952|publisher=Histoire de France et d'ailleurs|url=http://www.histoire-de-france-et-d-ailleurs.com/articles/Testaments/TestamentdeGaulle.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213234131/http://www.histoire-de-france-et-d-ailleurs.com/articles/Testaments/TestamentdeGaulle.htm|archivedate=13 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his wishes, such were the number of foreign dignitaries who wanted to honor de Gaulle that Pompidou was forced to arrange a separate memorial service at the [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame Cathedral]], to be held at the same time as his actual funeral. The only notable absentee was Canadian PM [[Pierre Trudeau]], possibly because he was still angry over de Gaulle's cry of "''Vive le Quebec libre''" during his 1967 visit.&lt;ref name="TIME-23 November 1970"/&gt;

The funeral on 12 November 1970 was the biggest such event in French history, with hundreds of thousands of French people—many carrying blankets and picnic baskets—and thousands of cars parked in the roads and fields along the routes to the two venues. Special trains were laid on to bring extra mourners to the region and the crowd was packed so tightly that those who fainted had to be passed overhead toward first-aid stations at the rear.&lt;ref name="TIME-23 November 1970"/&gt; The General was conveyed to the church on an armoured reconnaissance vehicle and carried to his grave, next to his daughter Anne, by eight young men of Colombey. As he was lowered into the ground, the bells of all the churches in France tolled, starting from Notre Dame and spreading out from there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1970/DeGaulle-and-Nasser-Die/12303235577467-8 |title=1970 – Year in Review.

De Gaulle specified that his tombstone bear the simple inscription of his name and his years of birth and death. Therefore, it simply states, "Charles de Gaulle, 1890–1970".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retirement|work=Fondation Charles de Gaulle|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=377|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118171038/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=377|archivedate=18 November 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the service, President Pompidou said, "de Gaulle gave France her governing institutions, her independence and her place in the world."{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} [[André Malraux]], the writer and intellectual who served as his Minister of Culture, called him "a man of the day before yesterday and the day after tomorrow."{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} De Gaulle's family turned the La Boisserie residence into a foundation.

==Legacy==
===Reputation===
[[File:De Gaulle.jpg|thumb|Portrait by Donald Sheridan]]

Historians have accorded Napoleon and de Gaulle the top-ranking status of French leaders in the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Thody|title=French Caesarism from Napoleon I to Charles de Gaulle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jDiwCwAAQBAJ|year=1989|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2005 survey, carried out in the context of the tenth anniversary of the death of Socialist President [[François Mitterrand]], 35 percent of respondents said Mitterrand was the best French president ever, followed by Charles de Gaulle (30 percent) and then [[Jacques Chirac]] (12 percent).&lt;ref&gt;Mitterrand, le préféré des Français [archive], site de TF1-LCI, 2 janvier 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Another poll by BVA four years later showed that 87% of French people regarded his presidency positively.&lt;ref&gt;"Charles de Gaulle, ex-président préféré des Français" [archive], ''Le Nouvel Observateur'', 4 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Statues honoring de Gaulle have been erected in Warsaw, Moscow, Bucharest and Quebec. The first Algerian president, [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], said that de Gaulle was the "military leader who brought us the hardest blows" prior to Algerian independence, but "saw further" than other politicians, and had a "universal dimension that is too often lacking in current leaders."&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Ben Bella, ''De Gaulle voyait plus loin'', in ''L'Express'', 26 October 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]], the first president of Senegal, said that few Western leaders could boast of having risked their lives to grant a colony independence.

In 1990 President Mitterrand, de Gaulle's old political rival, presided over the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of his birth. Mitterrand, who once wrote a vitriolic critique of him called the "Permanent Coup d'État", quoted a then recent opinion poll, saying, "As General de Gaulle, he has entered the pantheon of great national heroes, where he ranks ahead of [[Napoleon]] and behind only [[Charlemagne]]."&lt;ref name="DeGaulle"&gt;Mahoney, Daniel (2000) ''De Gaulle: Statesmanship, Grandeur and Modern Democracy'', Transaction Publishers, {{ISBN|1412821274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of [[Jean-Pierre Chevènement]], the leader of CERES, the left-wing and [[Souverainism|souverainist]] faction of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]], Mitterrand had, except on certain economic and social policies, rallied to much of Gaullism. Between the mid-1970s and mid-1990s there developed a left-right consensus, dubbed "Gaullo-Mitterrandism", behind the "French status" in NATO: i.e. outside the integrated military command.

===Relationships with other political leaders===
Although he initially enjoyed good relations with US President [[John F. Kennedy]], who admired his stance against the Soviet Union—particularly when the [[Berlin Wall]] was being built—and who called him "a great captain of the Western world", their relationship later cooled.&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010"/&gt; He was Kennedy's most loyal ally during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and supported the right that the  US claimed to defend its interests in the western hemisphere, in contrast to then German Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] who doubted Kennedy's commitment to Europe and thought the crisis could have been avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds D. (2000) ''One World Divisible: A Global History Since 1945''. New York: W W Norton and Company, pg. 182; {{ISBN|0393321088}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle accepted that it might be necessary for the United States to take preemptive military action against Cuba, unlike many other European leaders of his time.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; De Gaulle was a prominent figure at Kennedy's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corbisimages.com/images/Corbis-U1403096.jpg?size=67&amp;uid=706e2e9a-f414-452f-a79b-1210f326cfac JPG image]. corbisimages.com&lt;/ref&gt; 

De Gaulle was admired by the later President Nixon. After a meeting at the [[Palace of Versailles]] just before the general left office, Nixon declared that "He did not try to put on airs but an aura of majesty seemed to envelop him ... his performance—and I do not use that word disparagingly—was breathtaking."&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010"/&gt; On arriving for his funeral several months later, Nixon said of him, "greatness knows no national boundaries".&lt;ref&gt;''Time'', 23 November 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

Lt. General [[Vernon A. Walters]], a military attaché of [[Dwight Eisenhower]] and later military attaché in France from 1967–1973, noted the strong relationship between de Gaulle and Eisenhower, de Gaulle's unconditional support of Eisenhower during the U-2 incident, and de Gaulle's strong support of [[John F. Kennedy]] during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Thus Walters was intensely curious as to the great contrast between de Gaulle's close relations with two United States presidents during notable [[Cold War]] crises and de Gaulle's later decision to withdraw France from NATO's military command, and Walters spoke with many close military and political aides of de Gaulle.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; 

Walters' conclusion, based upon de Gaulle's comments to many of his aides (and to Eisenhower during a meeting at Ramboullet Castle in 1959), is that de Gaulle feared that later United States presidents after Eisenhower would not have Eisenhower's special ties to Europe and would not risk nuclear war over Europe.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; Also, de Gaulle interpreted the peaceful resolution of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] without fighting to take back Cuba from communism a mere 90 miles from the United States as an indication that the United States might not fight for Europe's defense 3,500 miles away following Soviet aggression in Europe, but would only go to war following a nuclear strike against the United States itself.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; De Gaulle told Eisenhower that France did not seek to compete with the Strategic Air Command or army of the United States, but believed that France needed a way to strike the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt;

A number of commentators have been critical of de Gaulle for his failure to prevent the massacres after Algerian independence&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; while others take the view that the struggle had been so long and savage that it was perhaps inevitable.&lt;ref name="Fenby-2010"/&gt; The Australian historian [[Brian Crozier]] wrote, "that he was able to part with Algeria without civil war was a great though negative achievement which in all probability would have been beyond the capacity of any other leader France possessed."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''De Gaulle: The Statesman''. Brian Crozier (Methuen). 1974&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1961, when four rebel generals seized power in Algeria, he "did not flinch in the face of this daunting challenge", but appeared on television in his general's uniform to forbid Frenchmen to obey the rebels' orders in an "inflexible display of personal authority".{{cn|date=March 2018}}

De Gaulle was an excellent manipulator of the media, as seen in his shrewd use of television to persuade around 80% of [[Metropolitan France]] to approve the new constitution for the Fifth Republic. In so doing, he refused to yield to the reasoning of his opponents who said that, if he succeeded in Algeria, he would no longer be necessary. He afterwards enjoyed massive approval ratings, and once said that "every Frenchman is, has been or will be Gaullist".&lt;ref name="Debray"/&gt;

That de Gaulle did not necessarily reflect mainstream French public opinion with his veto was suggested by the decisive majority of French people who voted in favour of British membership when the much more conciliatory Pompidou called a referendum on the matter in 1972. His early influence in setting the parameters of the EEC can still be seen today, most notably with the controversial Common Agricultural Policy.

Some writers take the view that Pompidou was a more progressive and influential leader than de Gaulle because, though also a Gaullist, he was less autocratic and more interested in social reforms.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Denis and Quick, Anthony (1974) ''20th Century Britain''&lt;/ref&gt; Although he followed the main tenets of de Gaulle's foreign policy, he was keen to work towards warmer relations with the United States. A banker by profession, Pompidou is also widely credited, as de Gaulle's prime minister from 1962–1968, with putting in place the reforms which provided the impetus for the economic growth which followed.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

In 1968, shortly before leaving office, de Gaulle refused to devalue the Franc on grounds of national prestige, but upon taking over Pompidou reversed the decision almost straight away. It was ironic, that during the financial crisis of 1968, France had to rely on American (and West German) financial aid to help shore up the economy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; 

Perry has written that the "events of 1968 illustrated the brittleness of de Gaulle's rule. That he was taken by surprise is an indictment of his rule; he was too remote from real life and had no interest in the conditions under which ordinary French people lived. Problems like inadequate housing and social services had been ignored. The French greeted the news of his departure with some relief as the feeling had grown that he had outlived his usefulness. Perhaps he clung onto power too long, perhaps he should have retired in 1965 when he was still popular."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

[[Brian Crozier]] said "the fame of de Gaulle outstrips his achievements, he chose to make repeated gestures of petulance and defiance that weakened the west without compensating advantages to France"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

[[Régis Debray]] called de Gaulle "super-lucide"&lt;ref name="Debray"/&gt; and pointed out that virtually all of his predictions, such as the fall of communism, the reunification of Germany and the resurrection of 'old' Russia, came true after his death.&lt;ref&gt;In fact, several of de Gaulle's predictions, such as his often-repeated belief during the early cold war period that a Third World War, with its "nuclear bombardments, famine, deportations" was not only ineluctable, but imminent, have not yet materialized. Jean Lacouture, ''De Gaulle'', Seuil, vol. II, p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Debray compared him with [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] ('the great political myth of the 19th century'), calling de Gaulle his 20th century equivalent. "The sublime, it seems, appears in France only once a century ... Napoleon left two generations dead on battlefield. De Gaulle was more sparing with other people's blood; even so, he left us, as it were, stranded, alive but dazed... A delusion, perhaps, but one that turns the world upside down: causes events and movements; divides people into supporters and adversaries; leaves traces in the form of civil and penal codes and railways, factories and institutions (the Fifth Republic has already lasted three times as long as the Empire). A statesman who gets something going, who has followers, escapes the reality of the reports and statistics and become part of imagination. Napoleon and de Gaulle modified the state of things because they modified souls".&lt;ref name="Debray"/&gt; 

However, Debray pointed out that there is a difference between Napoleon and de Gaulle: "How can the exterminator be compared with the liberator? ... The former ran the whole enterprise into the ground, while the latter managed to save it. So that to measure the rebel against the despot, the challenger against the leader, is just glaringly idiotic. You simply do not put an adventurer who worked for himself or his family on the same level as a commander-in-chief serving his country. ... Regrettably, Gaullism and Bonapartism have a number of features in common, but Napoleon and de Gaulle do not have the same moral value. ... the first wanted a Holy French Empire without the faith, a Europe under French occupation. The second wanted to rescue the nation from the emperors and establish a free France in a free Europe".&lt;ref name="Debray"/&gt;

While de Gaulle had many admirers, he was at the same time one of the most hated and reviled men in modern French history.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Jackson, "General de Gaulle and His Enemies: Anti-Gaullism in France Since 1940," ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' 6th Ser., Vol. 9 (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;43–65 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3679392 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Stark personally negotiates each consulting agreement to ensure that only work for which she has personal expertise will be contracted.

Once an agreement is in place and a statement of, the implementation is outsourced to one of its many independent experts, CDG's so-called "Network Staff". The Network Staff experts are scattered all over the States and Europe. The expert with the best background for the project (i.e. technological experience) is assigned to implement the statement of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=  | title=Clinical Device Group:  A Medical Device Consultancy Brochure |last1= Stark|first1= Nancy J. | website= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ContractorUK''' is a news and community website for [[independent contractors]] in the UK. It has been online since 1999, since the early days of [[IR35]] and the initial inflation of the [[dot-com bubble]].

== Overview ==
The website claims that it is home to the UK's IT contracting community, with over 420,000 visits per month. It provides independent editorial on contracting as well as calculators, market rates, and contract jobs.

== Tax and legislation issues ==
ContractorUK reports on a wide range of issues that face contractors. This includes changes made by [[HM Revenue and Customs|HMRC]] as well as the introduction of new and changes to existing tax legislation. 
It has covered the most pressing issues in the contracting industry such as [[IR35]], EBTs and [[BN66]]. It has also reported on the [[United Kingdom budget|Budget]], [[Autumn Statement]] and the Finance Bill, and how they will affect contractors. This includes the new legislation which will restrict tax relief for [[travel and subsistence]] for workers engaged through an employment intermediary, such as an umbrella company or a personal service company.
ContractorUK has covered news on the Personal Service Companies Committee,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.uk/personal-service-companies&lt;/ref&gt; including a speech made by [[Baroness Noakes]] in the [[House of Lords]] in which she referenced ContractorUK.

== Campaigns ==
The ContractorUK Forum provides space in the forums, for the No To Retro Tax (NTRT)&lt;ref&gt;http://notoretrotax.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; campaign group, who aim to overturn the retrospective tax legislation introduced in Section 58 of the UK [[Finance Act 2008]].

== Forum ==
The site has a [[internet forum|forum]], with over 2 million posts, to discuss matters related to contracting (including umbrella companies, recruitment agencies, contracts, tax etc.), as well as areas for general chat. Here contractors are able to receive unbiased advice from other contractors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13909">'''Dennis S. Karjala''' (December 19, 1939 – April 26, 2017) was an [[intellectual property]] law professor at Arizona State University. His major interests in teaching and research were primarily in the area of intellectual property, specifically in copyright and its applications in digital technologies.&lt;ref name="curriculum"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://apps.law.asu.edu/files/faculty/cvs/karjaladennis.pdf |title= Dennis S. Karjala - Curriculum Vita|last=Karjala |first=Dennis |date= |website=School of Law faculty CVs |publisher=Arizona State University |access-date=December 9, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work in the field of intellectual property was internationally recognized and complemented by his ease in speaking and writing in Japanese.&lt;ref name="asu-principal"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://apps.law.asu.edu/Apps/Faculty/Faculty.aspx |id= id: 47 |title= Dennis S. Karjala - Page Arizona State University |accessdate= December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karjala, who began working at Arizona State University in 1978, taught international copyright and intellectual property in cyberspace. However, for a long time he worked and wrote articles in the areas of security, corporate rights, federal (personal and corporate) taxation and business planning.&lt;ref name = "curriculum" /&gt;

He was a visiting professor at numerous universities including the University of Minnesota and UCLA leading classes in the areas of security and copyright. He also worked as a lawyer early in his career at [[McCutchen, Doyle, Brown &amp; Enersen]] in California.&lt;ref name = "asu-principal" /&gt;

== Karjala on copyright ==
Karjala has been very involved with causes related to the laws of [[copyright]] and is cited in several cases related to this subject.

In 1992, he was involved with the ''[[Sega v. Accolade]]'' case, in which [[Sega]] was suing [[Accolade]] with allegations of infringement of copyrights, [[trademarks]], and [[unfair competition]].

=== Copyright extension ===
Karjala has written and testified regarding copyright term extension, first with the 1998 [[Copyright Term Extension Act]] (CTEA).  He testified in front of the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]], arguing that the proposal would generate great costs to the general public without bringing any benefit. In addition, Karjala also wrote several letters directed to members of Congress, arguing that the proposed extension would not benefit the public. However, despite these efforts, the law was passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://homepages.law.asu.edu/~dkarjala/OpposingCopyrightExtension/legmats/1998statement.html | title = Dennis S. Karjala - Declaration on the CTEA | accessdate = December 9, 2015 | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "website"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://homepages.law.asu.edu/~Dkarjala/OpposingCopyrightExtension/ | title = "Opposing Copyright Extension" | accessdate = December 9, 2015 | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karjala owns a website called "Opposing Copyright Extension" where he talks about the CTEA, expresses his opinion on the subject and disseminates materials on the law and copyright terms policies. On the website itself, he mentions that it was created in the hope that when this topic comes up again, those who seek to defend the public interest have more ammunition for it. Karjala also thanks Harvard University professor [[Lawrence Lessig]] for his dedicated efforts. According to Karjala, Lessig provided an immeasurable amount of his time, money and talent in favor of the cause and that, no matter how they did not succeed, the struggle was important to present the problem to the public.&lt;ref name = "website" /&gt;

In 2013, Karjala was quoted in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in a story about the extension of [[copyright]], discussing the [[CTEA]], and the possible extension of extension of the copyrights protection of several classics, including [[Mickey Mouse]] and even [[Superman]], for another 20 years.&lt;ref name="15years"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lee |first=Timothy B. |date=2013-10-25 |title=15 years ago, Congress kept Mickey Mouse out of the public domain. Will they do it again? |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2013/10/25/15-years-ago-congress-kept-mickey-mouse-out-of-the-public-domain-will-they-do-it-again/ |work=Washington Post |access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Referring to the CTEA, Karjala said that "there was not a single argument that could be maintained after any kind of reasonable analysis." In another citation of the article, he mentions that the people who support the law are precisely those who would benefit directly if it were approved, i.e., copyrights of old works that were about to expire.&lt;ref name="15years" /&gt;

In 2015, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reviewed the copyright problems with ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank]]'', which is still under copyright. Karjala, quoted, said there is nothing that would make a 95-year copyright term an incentive for anyone to create anything and that the law is not meant to influence artistic expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hiltzik  |first=Michael |date=2015-11-16 |title=The Squabble Over Anne Frank's Diary Shows the Absurdity of Copyright Law

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8392">'''Depreciation recapture''' is the USA Internal Revenue Service ([[IRS]]) procedure for collecting income tax on a gain realized by a taxpayer when the taxpayer disposes of an asset that had previously provided an offset to ordinary income for the taxpayer through [[depreciation]].  In other words, because the IRS allows a taxpayer to deduct the depreciation of an asset from the taxpayer’s ordinary income, the taxpayer has to report any gain from the disposal of the asset (up to the recomputed basis) as ordinary income, not as a [[capital gain]].

Depreciation recapture most commonly applies when dealing with the sale of improved [[real estate]] (such as rental property), as the value of real estate generally increases over time while the improvements are subject to depreciation.

Depreciation recapture in the USA is governed by sections 1245 and 1250 of the [[Internal Revenue Code]] (IRC).  Any gain over the recomputed basis will be taxed as a capital gain in accordance with section 1231 of the IRC.

This article is about the system used in the USA and Canada, but other countries have similar procedures.  In the UK, [[HM Revenue and Customs|HMRC]] uses "negative depreciation".

== Basis ==

The starting point for determining when a depreciation recapture will occur is to determine the [[Cost basis|basis]] of the asset.  There are three different types of basis: original, adjusted, and recomputed basis.  

The original basis of an asset is usually the value of a taxpayer’s investment in the asset.  (''See'' IRC § 1012).  When a taxpayer purchases an asset, the original basis is the purchase price, or cost, of the asset.  Different factors, including tax deductions for depreciation, can lead to an adjusted or recomputed basis for the asset.  (''See'' IRC § 1016 and IRC § 1245(a)(2)(A)).   

An adjusted basis under IRC 1016 is the original basis of a piece of property plus any increases for improvements to the property or any decreases for depreciation deductions allowed or allowable with respect to such property.  So, if a taxpayer buys something for $100,000, and allowable deductions under IRC 167 for the next 3 years are $5000 per year, his adjusted basis is $85,000.  

Recomputed basis under IRC 1245(a)(2) basically means, with respect to any property, its adjusted basis recomputed by adding all adjustments reflected on account of deductions allowed or allowable to the taxpayer for depreciation.  In the previous example, the taxpayer’s recomputed basis would be $100,000 because you add to the adjusted basis the amounts the taxpayer depreciated.  

If a taxpayer sells an asset for less than its basis, then the taxpayer has taken a loss.  If the taxpayer sells the asset for more than its basis, the taxpayer has experienced a gain.  For example, if a taxpayer purchased a widget for $1,000, the original basis of the widget would be $1,000.  If the taxpayer sold the widget for $1,500, the taxpayer would experience a capital gain of $500.

== Depreciation ==

When a taxpayer purchases a [[tax deduction|tax-deductible]] asset for use over several years, the taxpayer can deduct a percentage of the asset’s value from his or her yearly taxable income over the life of the asset. (''See'' IRC § 167, 168 and the IRS tables of class lives and recovery periods). The IRS publishes specific depreciation schedules for different classes of assets.  The schedules tell a taxpayer what percentage of an asset’s value may be deducted each year and the number of years in which the deductions may be taken.  The values of these deductions are used to determine the asset’s recomputed basis at the time the taxpayer sells the asset.  (''See'' IRC § 1245(a)(2)(A)).  

For example, if a taxpayer purchased a widget with a $1,000 basis, then deducted $100 from his ordinary income each year for the widget’s depreciation, after four years the widget’s adjusted basis would be $600.  The accumulated depreciation on the widget during that time is $400.

== Computing depreciation recapture ==

When a taxpayer sells an asset for a gain after taking deductions for depreciation, depreciation recapture is used to tax the gain.  Because the taxpayer received a deduction from ordinary income for the depreciation of the asset, any gain the taxpayer receives, up to the depreciation amount, must be included as ordinary income to offset the earlier deduction.  Any gain above that is a capital gain subject to capital gains tax rates (usually more favorable).

For example, the widget discussed above had an original basis of $1,000.  The taxpayer took $400 worth of depreciation deductions from his ordinary income over the course of four years.  At the end of those four years, the taxpayer’s adjusted basis in the asset had changed to $600.  If the taxpayer then sells the asset for $700, then they would realize a gain of $100.  Because they received depreciation deductions, they would be required to include the $100 gain as part of his ordinary income.  This is a depreciation recapture.

However, if taxpayer instead sells the widget for $1300, because their adjusted basis is $600, the result is a $700 gain.  Of that amount, $400 of the gain (equivalent to the total amount of depreciation taken during the time owned) is taxed as ordinary income, and the remaining $300 is taxed at the more favorable capital gains tax rate.

-------
While this section is correct for Section 1245 property (in the U.S.A), it is not correct for Section 1250 property.  For Section 1250 assets (real estate), Recaptured Depreciation is defined as "Additional Depreciation" in [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p544.pdf IRS Publication 544] (see column 3 on page 30 of the 2016 version of this publication).  Additional Depreciation is the portion of Accumulated Depreciation in excess of straight line.  It is taxed at ordinary income tax rates, which have a maximum rate of 39.6% or 37% after 2018(to the extent of any gain realized).  The portion of Accumulated Depreciation which corresponds to straight line depreciation is called "Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain" (though sometimes informally called "Unrecaptured Depreciation", and it is taxed at a maximum rate of 25% (also to the extent of any gain realized).  The remainder of any gain realized is considered long-term capital gain, provided the property was held over a year, and is taxed at a maximum rate of 15% for 2010-2012, and 20% for 2013 and thereafter.

If Section 1245 or Section 1250 property is held one year or less, any gain on its sale or exchange is taxed as ordinary income.

Though this article is about Recaptured Depreciation, it would probably be a good place to explain Unrecaptured 1250 Gain as well as Long-Term and Short-Term Capital Gain.  There should not be any differences between the treatment of Section 1245 property and Section 1250 property.

== Loss ==

When a taxpayer takes a loss on the sale of an asset, there is no depreciation recapture.  However, the taxpayer may qualify for ordinary loss treatment under IRC § 1231.

== Property affected ==

IRC § 1245(a)(3) lists the property for which depreciation recapture rules apply.  Under IRC § 1245(a)(3)(A), all personal property that can provide a depreciation offset to ordinary income is subject to depreciation recapture.  Under rules contained in the current Internal Revenue Code, real property is not subject to depreciation recapture.  However, under IRC § 1(h)(1)(D), real property that has experienced a gain after providing a taxpayer with a depreciation deduction is subject to a 25% tax rate--10% higher than the usual rate for a capital gain.  This higher tax rate serves as a rough surrogate for depreciation recapture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3291">The '''Development Loan Fund''' (DLF) was the [[loan|lending]] arm of the [[United States]] [[International Cooperation Administration]]. It was established in 1957 as part of a revision of the [[Mutual Security Act]]. Its main purpose was extending loans to foreign nations, mostly for capital projects, repayable in the local [[currency]] of the borrower. In 1961, it merged into the [[United States Agency for International Development]].&lt;ref name="encyc-un-agreements-2546-2547"&gt;{{cite book|last=Osmańczyk|first=Edmund Jan|author2=Anthony Mango|title=Encyclopedia of the United Nations and International Agreements: T to Z|editor=Anthony Mango|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2003|edition=3|pages=2546–2547|isbn=978-0-415-93924-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6AB2CadyN7QC&amp;pg=PA2547&amp;dq=%22development+loan+fund%22+international&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=X-N5S82fI4_OlQSw-8HgBA&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22development%20loan%20fund%22%20international&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its creation, its legislative mandate ordered that it not "compete" with "private [[financial capital|investment capital]]", the [[Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]] or the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]].&lt;ref name="wood-120"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wood, Robert Everett|title=From Marshall Plan to debt crisis: foreign aid and development choices in the world economy|publisher=University of California Press|year=1986|series=Studies in international political economy|volume=15|isbn=978-0-520-05868-2|page=120|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AxahJZ0ZrwMC&amp;pg=PR120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DLF was dominated by the Department of State because the chair of the Board for the Fund was the [[United States Under Secretary of State|Under Secretary of State]]. This interfered with the ability of the DLF to impartially and independently evaluate and accept loan proposals. The 1960 report on the Operations of the DLF insisted that there was ongoing pressure on the Fund from the Department of State to dole out funds for political purposes. Furthermore, to keep it as an independent agency costed taxpayers around $2 million a year.

Approximately one quarter of all DLF funds in 1958 and 1959 went to India, about $195 million. Of this sum, $175 was earmarked, meaning that it was not restricted to use in any identifiable planned project and instead being used as a line of credit to India.

{{Politics of Malaysia}}

'''Election Commission of Malaysia''' ({{lang-ms|Suruhanjaya Pilihan Raya Malaysia}}), abbreviated '''SPR''' or '''EC''', is a commission set up by virtue of Article 114 of the [[Constitution of Malaysia|Federal Constitution]] for the purpose of ensuring fair and equitable operations in undertaking parliamentary and state elections in [[Malaysia]].

== History ==
EC was formed on 4 September 1957, under Article 114 of the [[Constitution of Malaysia]], which empowers it to conduct elections for the [[Dewan Rakyat]] and [[State legislative assemblies of Malaysia|state legislative assemblies]].

At its establishment, EC only consisted of a chairman and two members – Dr Mustafa Albakri Hassan together with Lee Ewe Boon and Ditt Singh. After the formation of [[Malaysia]] in 1963 and the inclusion of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]], another member was added to represent the two states on a rotation basis. Datuk Abang Marzuki Nor from Sarawak was the first such member appointed.

A secretariat was also set up to fulfil the commission's functions and carry out its decisions, with a secretary made the chief executive officer. The first EC secretary was H. Cassidy.

An amendment to Article 114 made in 1981 provided for the new post of a deputy chairman, and Abdul Rahman Abdul Hassan was the first to hold this position.

Today, the EC has a chairman, a deputy chairman and five members, all appointed by the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] after consulting the [[Conference of Rulers]].

==Constitutional mandate==
Under Article 114, EC is empowered to "conduct elections to the House of Representatives (''[[Dewan Rakyat]]'', the lower house of [[Parliament of Malaysia|Parliament]]) and the Legislative Assemblies of the States". Under the Constitution of the independent [[Federation of Malaya]], EC comprised one Chairman and two members, but after Malaya merged with [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]], [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]] and [[Singapore]] to form Malaysia, the membership was expanded by constitutional amendment to provide for an additional member from Sabah or Sarawak. A 1981 amendment to the Constitution added another member and created the post of Deputy Chairman.&lt;ref name="rachagan 28-29"&gt;Rachagan, S. Sothi (1993). ''Law and the Electoral Process in Malaysia'', pp. 28&amp;ndash;29. Kuala Lumpur: University of Malaya Press. {{ISBN|967-9940-45-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

EC has the power to delimit [[constituency|constituencies]], revise the electoral roll of registered voters, and regulate the manner in which elections are conducted. Although the Constitution does not refer to EC as being a body independent from influence by the government or otherwise, constitutional scholars have generally considered the Constitution as intending to protect the independence of EC.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Among other things, commissioners are protected by [[tenure]], and may only be removed through the same procedure as a judge of the [[Courts of Malaysia|Supreme Court]]. The terms of remuneration of a commissioner cannot be altered to his disadvantage after he has been appointed.&lt;ref name="rachagan 28-29"/&gt;

Members of EC are appointed by the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]], who must consult with the [[Conference of Rulers]] and appoint an EC which has the confidence of the public. Although the Constitution does not expressly require consultation with the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] in this regard, it has been argued that under Article 40 of the Constitution, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong cannot act on his own discretion unless explicitly stated; in all other cases, he must acquiesce to the advice of the Prime Minister, and as such the appointments to EC are made with the advice of the Prime Minister. Members of the Commission retire at the age of 65.&lt;ref&gt;Rachagan, pp. 28&amp;ndash;30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
Apart from regulating elections, the EC's duties include reviewing the boundaries of parliamentary and state constituencies, holding by-elections and carrying out registration exercises.

It also collects information on newly developed areas to ensure a fair representation of voters in each constituency, promotes awareness on how important it is to vote and revises the electoral roll by deleting the names of those who are dead or have been disqualified.

On polling day, EC members and officers will be stationed at polling centre nationwide to oversee the process.

==Controversies==
{{See also|Bersih|Bersih 3.0 rally|Malaysian general election, 2018}}
The EC has been accused of being half-hearted in electoral reforms and in 2012, the chairperson and the deputy chairperson was accused to be members of the ruling party. Both individuals admitted to may have been members at some point, but the deputy chairperson later retracted the admission and denounced it as an attempt to besmirch the EC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Shazwan |last=Mustafa Kamal |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/ec-no-2-denies-he-is-umno-member/ |title=EC No 2 denies he is Umno member |publisher=The Malaysian Insider |date=2 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504200704/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/ec-no-2-denies-he-is-umno-member |archivedate=2012-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Malaysian general election, 2018|14th general election]], EC was accused of allowing gross gerrymandering and malapportionment practices by the incumbent government. It was also reprimanded as the ballot counting process was the longest in Malaysia's history{{Citation needed|date=September 2018|reason=Unproven and undocumented claim}}, with the results still being streamed in after 4 a.m. [[Time in Malaysia|MYT]] of the following day (10 May). EC has also been accused of making the election day on a weekday rather a weekend. It currently denies that it tried to stop overseas Malaysians to vote.

The '''Federal Administrative Court''' (''Bundesverwaltungsgericht'') is one of the five federal [[supreme court]]s of [[Germany]]. It is the court of the last resort for generally all cases of [[administrative law]], mainly disputes between citizens and the state. It hears appeals from the  ''Oberverwaltungsgerichte'', or Superior Administrative Courts, which, in turn, are the courts of appeals for decisions of the ''Verwaltungsgerichte'' (Administrative Courts).

However, cases concerning social security law belong to the jurisdiction of the ''Sozialgerichte'' (Social Courts) with the  [[Bundessozialgericht]] as federal court of appeals, and cases of tax and customs law are decided by the ''Finanzgerichte'' (Finance Courts), and, ultimately, by the [[Bundesfinanzhof]].

The ''Bundesverwaltungsgericht'' has its seat at the former [[Reichsgericht]] (Imperial Court of Justice) building in [[Leipzig]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6738">'''Fruit salt''' or '''fruit salts''' is a term for [[effervescent]] compounds made up of organic acids such as [[citric acid]] or [[tartaric acid]] and salts such as [[sodium bicarbonate]], [[sodium carbonate]], or [[sodium bitartrate]] in combination with added flavoring and sugar. Historically, fruit salts were sold for a wide range of ailments, and today they are used primarily as [[antacids]].

==History==
In the 17th and 18th centuries, scientists began uncovering the chemical  make-up and physiological benefits of various salts such as [[Glauber's salt]] and [[Epsom salts]].&lt;ref name=RiseFruitSalt/&gt; The fact that these were found in mineral springs led to the rise of [[spa]]s, where people would go to bathe in and drink mineral-rich waters for their health.&lt;ref name=RiseFruitSalt/&gt; These developments led to attempts to replicate the salt mixtures found in these naturally occurring [[mineral waters]] using off-the-shelf ingredients.&lt;ref name=RiseFruitSalt/&gt; Mixing these kinds of salts — especially [[carbonates]] and [[tartrates]] — with flavorings like lemon into an effervescent compound with citric or tartaric acid proved especially popular and set off a craze for the new "fruit salts".&lt;ref name=RiseFruitSalt/&gt;

The name comes not from the popular fruit flavorings but from the fact that the acid in the mixture — which was then sourced from either citrus fruit (citric acid) or grapes (tartaric acid) — forms further salts such [[monosodium citrate]] in solution with the carbonates or tartrates.&lt;ref name=cm/&gt; "Fruit salt" thus refers both to the fruit-derived salts formed in solution and metonymically to the mixture as a whole.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt;

[[File:Eno's 'Fruit Salt' advertisement 001.jpg|thumb|ad for Eno's 'Fruit Salt']]
In 1852, the British pharmacist [[James Crossley Eno]] started selling such a fruit salt mixture from his pharmacy in the port city of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].&lt;ref name=RiseFruitSalt/&gt;&lt;ref name=jce/&gt; Eno gave away his mixture to seafarers at the port, and in this way the name Eno became associated with fruit salts around the world.&lt;ref name=RiseFruitSalt/&gt; In 1868, he formally founded the company Eno's 'Fruit Salt' Works.&lt;ref name=RiseFruitSalt/&gt;&lt;ref name=russell/&gt;&lt;ref name=HistoryInvest/&gt;{{rp|253}}

Eno's success spawned many competitors in both Great Britain and the United States, including Abbey's Effervescent  Salts,&lt;ref name=cm/&gt; Dunn's Fruit Salt,&lt;ref name=patent/&gt; Slaven's California Fruit Salt,&lt;ref name=mission/&gt; and Dr. Edison Obesity Fruit Salts, for which in 1897 performer [[Alice J. Shaw]] became one of the earliest celebrity spokespersons for a weight loss product.&lt;ref name=pi1897/&gt; In the style of [[patent medicines]] and [[quackery]], they were advertised hyperbolically for an enormous range of diseases and ailments, only some of which they could ameliorate (e.g. indigestion). The range spanned from cholera&lt;ref name=kotar/&gt; to [[gout]], [[rheumatism]], colds, fevers, [[biliousness]], indigestion, diarrhea, pimples, and  headaches.&lt;ref name=ad/&gt;

As the pharmaceutical industry moved away from cure-all patent medicines in the mid 20th century, Eno Fruit Salt became one of the only surviving products of its kind.&lt;ref name=crellin/&gt;{{rp|154}} Currently owned by [[GlaxoSmithKline]], Eno Fruit Salt is today sold as an antacid, and its main ingredients are now [[sodium bicarbonate]], [[sodium carbonate]], and [[citric acid]].&lt;ref name=qd/&gt;&lt;ref name=emc/&gt; Its main market is in India.&lt;ref name=bl/&gt;

A '''gavel''' is a small [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] [[mallet]] commonly made of [[hardwood]], typically fashioned with a handle. It is used almost exclusively in the [[United States]] in [[Legislature|legislatures]] and [[Court|courts]] of law{{Efn|name="CommonwealthEU"|The gavel has never been used in any [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] or [[European Union member state]].}}, but is used worldwide for auctions.

A gavel can be used to call for attention or to punctuate rulings and [[proclamation]]s. It is a symbol of the authority and right to act officially in the capacity of a [[Chair (official)|chair]] or presiding officer.&lt;ref name="thirtynine" /&gt; It is often struck against a [[sound block]], a striking surface typically also made of hardwood, to enhance its sounding qualities. According to tradition, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President of the United States of America]] [[John Adams]] used a gavel to call the very first [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] to order in New York in the spring of 1789. Since then, it has remained customary to tap the gavel against a lectern or desk to indicate the opening (call to order) and the closing (adjournment) of proceedings, giving rise to the phrase ''gavel-to-gavel'' to describe the entirety of a meeting or session. It is also used to keep the meeting itself calm and orderly.

The sound of the gavel strike, being abrupt to start and stop, and clearly audible by all present, serves to sharply define an action in time in a manner clearly perceivable by all, and to endow the action with practical as well as symbolic finality.

==Etymology==
In Medieval England, the word ''gavel'' could refer to a tribute or rent payment made with something other than cash.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;See dictionary definitions of "gavel" at [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gavel Merriam-Webster], [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/gavel Oxford Dictionaries], and [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/gavel thefreedictionary.com].&lt;/ref&gt; These agreements were set in English land-court with the sound of a ''gavel'', a word which may come from the {{lang-ang|[[wikt:gafol|gafol]]}} (meaning "tribute").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Gavel'' would be prefixed to any non-monetary payment given to a lord (for example: ''gavel-malt'') and can be found as a prefix to other terms such as ''[[gavelkind]]'', a system of [[partible inheritance]] formerly found in parts of the UK and Ireland.  A ''gavel'' may also have referred to a kind of mason's tool, a setting maul that came into use as a way to maintain order in meetings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Use in meetings==
A gavel may be used in [[Meeting (parliamentary procedure)|meetings]] of a [[deliberative assembly]]. According to ''[[Robert's Rules of Order|Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised]]'', the gavel may be used to signify a [[Recess (break)|recess]] or an [[adjournment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 232|edition = 11th|ref = harv|display-authors = et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 242}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be used to signify when a member makes a slight breach of the rules.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''[[Demeter's Manual of Parliamentary Law and Procedure]]'' states that, in addition to an optional light tap after a vote, there are three other uses of a gavel:&lt;ref name=thirtynine&gt;{{cite parl|title=DEM|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*To attract attention and call a meeting to order. In most organisations, two taps raise and one tap seats the assembly; in others, two taps raise and three taps seat it.
*To maintain order and restore it when breached in the course of the proceedings. (Tap the gavel once, but vigorously).
*To be handed over to successors in office or to officiating officers as ceremonials, etc. (Always extend the holding end).
Improper uses include banging the gavel in an attempt to drown out a disorderly member.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 645}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this situation, the chair should give one vigorous tap at a time at intervals.&lt;ref name="thirtynine" /&gt; Also, the chair should not lean on the gavel, juggle or toy with it, or use it to challenge or threaten or to emphasize remarks.&lt;ref name="thirtynine" /&gt;

The chair should not be "gaveling through" a measure by cutting off members and quickly putting a question to a vote before any member can get the floor (in this connection, the chair should not use the gavel to improperly signify the end of consideration of a question).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 387}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expression ''passing the gavel'' signifies an orderly succession from one [[Chairman|chair]] to another.

In addition to the use above during business meetings, organizations may use the gavel during their ceremonies and may specify the number of raps of the gavel corresponding to different actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.elks.org/lodges/LodgePages.cfm?LodgeNumber=2364&amp;ID=5840 |title=The Gavel |work=B.P.O.E. |accessdate=2015-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Illustrations of Masonry: Illustrations of Masonry: Opening the Lodge|url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/mas/morgan/morg03.htm|website = www.sacred-texts.com|access-date = 2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gavel is used in [[court of law|courts of law]] in the United States and, by [[metonymy]], is used there to represent the entire [[judiciary]] system, especially of [[judge]]ship. On the other hand, in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], gavels have never been used by judges, despite many American-influenced TV programmes depicting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/nov/23/writ-large-courtroom-drama-bbc|title=Knock it on the head, BBC.

==United States Congress gavels==
[[Image:US Senate gavels.jpg|thumb|right|[[United States Senate]] gavels.]]
The [[Traditions of the United States Senate|unique gavel]] of the [[United States Senate]] has an [[hourglass]] shape and no handle. In 1954, the gavel that had been in use since at least 1780 broke when [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Nixon]] used it during a heated debate on [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], despite silver plates having been added in 1952 to strengthen it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/The_Senates_New_Gavel.htm |title=Historical Minute Essays: 1941-1963: November 17, 1954: The Senate's New Gavel |work=senate.gov |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to obtain a piece of ivory large enough to replace the gavel, the Senate appealed to the [[Embassy of India in Washington|Indian embassy]]. Later that year [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], vice president of India, visited the Senate and presented a replica of the original gavel to Nixon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=India's gift to Nixon |url=http://www.thehindu.com/2004/11/19/stories/2004111901350902.htm |accessdate=3 June 2018 |work=The Hindu |publisher=The Hindu |date=1954-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replica is still in use as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Senate Gavel |url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/art/artifact/Other_71_00002.htm |website=senate.gov |accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the Senate's, the gavel of the [[United States House of Representatives]] is plain [[wood]] with a handle. Used more often and more forcefully in the House, it has been broken and replaced many times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Passing One Of Many, Many Gavels|url = https://www.npr.org/2011/01/05/132641490/passing-one-of-many-many-gavels|website = NPR.org|access-date = 2016-02-10|first = Travis|last = Larchuk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both houses, the gavel is generally sounded, that is, struck, once to mark the opening of the session, the adjournment, and to punctuate announcements of decisions by the body (that is, when the presiding officer announces that a resolution or motion is passed, the gavel is generally tapped once to declare the issue finished and to move on). Rather than shouting for order like in most Westminster style parliaments, the gavel, particularly in the House of Representatives, is often tapped repeatedly by the presiding officer to call the assembly to order or to restore order when cross-conversation has made it too noisy to proceed.

==United Nations==

In 1955 Icelandic sculptor [[Ríkarður Jónsson]] carved the Icelandic birch gavel and striking board used at the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt; Baal-Teshuva, Jacob, Art Treasures of the United Nations, Thomas Yoseloff, New York, 1964 p.71 and Plate 34&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hiberna''' in [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was also known as "chleb zimowy" (winters bread) and it was an obligation to guarantee accommodation for troops during winter time. It was an obligation of  ''Królewszczyzna'' ([[crown lands]]) and church estates. Initially it was paid-in-kind, in 1649-1652 it was a targeted tax to support the troops collected by [[Grand Crown Hetlam]]. Over time ''hiberna'' absorbed some other taxes (e.g. [[Jewish poll tax]] and ''[[kwarta]]'') and extended to other population categories.&lt;ref&gt;''Scepter of Judah: The Jewish Autonomy in the Eighteenth-Century Crown Poland'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=1fGQfpMdp84C&amp;pg=PA16 pp. 16-17]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is borrowed from [[ancient Rome]], where the ''[[castra hiberna]]'' were a winter camps for [[Roman legions]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10922">'''''Iura novit curia''''' is a [[Latin language|Latin]] [[legal maxim]] expressing the principle that "the court knows the law", i.e., that the parties to a legal dispute do not need to [[pleading|plead]] or prove the law that applies to their case.&lt;ref name="Derlén 314"&gt;{{cite book|last=Derlén|first=Mattias|title=Multilingual interpretation of European Union law|editor=[[Kluwer Law]] International|isbn=978-90-411-2853-9|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKuCJ4fBwX4C&amp;pg=PA314|series=European monographs|volume=67|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The maxim is applied principally in [[civil law system]]s and is part of the investigative ("[[inquisitorial]]") aspect of that legal tradition, as distinguished from the more pronouncedly [[adversarial]] approach of [[common law]] legal systems. The maxim is first found in the writings of the medieval [[glossator]]s about ancient [[Roman law]].&lt;ref name="Geeroms 30"&gt;{{cite book|last=Geeroms|first=Sofie|title=Foreign law in civil litigation: a comparative and functional analysis|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|page=30|isbn=978-0-19-926476-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xl1PKc0lf8oC&amp;pg=PA30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==
''Iura novit curia'' means that the [[court]] alone is responsible for determining which law applies to a particular case, and how. The court applies the law ''[[ex officio]]'', that is, without being limited to the legal arguments advanced by the parties (although the court is normally limited to granting the [[relief (law)|relief]] sought by the parties). The same principle is also expressed in the related maxim '''''da mihi factum, dabo tibi ius''''' ("give me the facts and I shall give you the law"), sometimes also given as ''narra mihi factum, narro tibi ius'': it is incumbent on the parties to furnish the facts of a case and the responsibility of the judge to establish the applicable law.&lt;ref name="Derlén 314" /&gt; The maxim also means the parties cannot limit the court's legal [[cognition (law)|cognition]] (that is, the authority to determine the applicable law).&lt;ref name="van Rhee 303"&gt;{{cite book|last=van Rhee|first=C. H.|title=European traditions in civil procedure|page=303|publisher=Intersentia nv|year=2005|series=Ius commune europaeum|volume=54|isbn=978-90-5095-491-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cbB_ykTvMA0C&amp;pg=PA303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its most wide-reaching form, the principle of ''iura novit curia'' allows the court to base its decision on a legal theory that has not been the subject of argument by the parties.&lt;ref name="Brooker 8
"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brooker|first=Douglas|date=30 October 2005|title=Va Savoir! – The Adage "Jura Novit Curia" in Contemporary France|journal=[[bepress]] Legal Series |issue=Working Paper 845|page=8|url=http://law.bepress.com/expresso/eps/845}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in view of the parties' right to be heard (''[[audiatur et altera pars]]'') and the adversarial principle, both also recognized in civil law systems, this freedom is not unlimited. Many jurisdictions require the court to allow the parties to address any points of law first raised by the court itself.&lt;ref name="Brooker 8" /&gt; 

Because a wide application of ''iura novit curia'' may conflict with the parties' authority (in [[private law]]) to decide what is to be the subject of litigation, courts in most jurisdictions normally stay within the bounds established by the pleadings and arguments of the parties.&lt;ref name="Brooker 11
"&gt;See {{cite journal|last=Brooker|first=Douglas|date=30 October 2005|title=Va Savoir! – The Adage "Jura Novit Curia" in Contemporary France|journal=[[bepress]] Legal Series |issue=Working Paper 845|page=11|url=http://law.bepress.com/expresso/eps/845}} concerning the situation in France.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[criminal law]], the court's freedom to apply the law is generally constrained at least to some extent by the legal characterization of the alleged facts in the [[indictment]].

==Exceptions==
The principle of ''iura novit curia'' may be subject to exceptions. For instance, courts may be required by law to submit certain questions of law (such as the [[constitutionality]] of a statute, or the application of [[European law]]) to the review of a specialized other court (such as a [[constitutional court]] or the [[European Court of Justice]]). 

The codes of procedure may also provide that the court may call upon the parties or experts to prove or determine any applicable ''foreign'' law.&lt;ref name="van Rhee 303" /&gt; In common law countries in particular, the rule is ''iura aliena non novit curia'', i.e., judges may not rely on their own knowledge of foreign law, but the party who relies on it must prove it. In civil law systems, the same rule generally applies in attenuated forms: judges may (or should to the extent possible) make their own investigations of foreign law.&lt;ref name="Kahn-Freund 306"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahn-Freund|first=Otto|title=General problems of private international law|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|year=1975|series=Recueil des Cours|volume=143|page=306|isbn=978-90-286-0605-0|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=a-B4Um9nKpUC&amp;pg=PA306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applicability==
===In civil and common law legal systems===
According to [[Mattias Derlén]], "it has traditionally been claimed that ''jura novit curia'' applies in [[civil law system]]s but not in [[common law system]]s".&lt;ref name="Derlén 315"&gt;{{cite book|last=Derlén|first=Mattias|title=Multilingual interpretation of European Union law|editor=[[Kluwer Law]] International|isbn=978-90-411-2853-9|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKuCJ4fBwX4C&amp;pg=PA315|series=European monographs|volume=67|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Jacobs]] described this view as follows:

{{quote|1=It might be tempting to suggest that there is a basic distinction between two fundamentally different types of procedure within the [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]]: a distinction between, broadly speaking, the continental systems on the one hand and the English, Irish and Scottish systems on the other. On that view, the court in the continental systems is deemed to know the law ('jura novit curia' or 'curia novit legem'); it must apply the appropriate legal rules to the facts as they are presented to the court by the parties ('da mihi factum, dabo tibi jus'); and if necessary it will engage for that purpose in its own legal research. In the English, Irish and Scottish systems, on the other hand, the court has a less active, or even a passive, role: the procedure is generally based on the assumption that the court has no independent knowledge of the law, that it is dependent upon the submissions advanced by counsel for the parties, and that its function essentially is to adjudicate on the exclusive basis of their submissions. According to one commentator, 'perhaps the most spectacular feature of English procedure is that the rule ''curia novit legem'' has never been and is not part of English law'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61993C0430:EN:NOT Opinion] of [[Advocate General]] Jacobs in the [[European Court of Justice]] cases C-430/93 and C-431/93, Jeroen van Schijndel and Johannes Nicolaas Cornelis van Veen v Stichting Pensioenfonds voor Fysiotherapeuten, European Court reports 1995 Page I-04705, par. 33. The commentator to which Jacobs refers is [[F. A. Mann]], ''Fusion of the Legal Professions?'' Law Quarterly Review 1977, 367 at p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jacobs explains, however, that this distinction is exaggerated on closer examination: Civil law courts, ''iura novit curia'' notwithstanding, may not exceed the limits of the case as defined by the claims of the parties and may not generally raise a new point involving new issues of fact. A common law court, too, will  ''[[sua sponte]]'' take a point which is a matter of [[public policy]]; it will, for instance, refuse to enforce an illegal contract even if no party raises this point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61993C0430:EN:NOT Opinion] of [[Advocate General]] Jacobs in the cases C-430/93 and C-431/93, Jeroen van Schijndel and Johannes Nicolaas Cornelis van Veen v Stichting Pensioenfonds voor Fysiotherapeuten, European Court reports 1995 Page I-04705, par. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; The common law's lack of the rule of ''iura novit curia'' therefore has some relevance in civil proceedings, but matters little in criminal proceedings or in administrative courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61993C0430:EN:NOT Opinion] of [[Advocate General]] Jacobs in the cases C-430/93 and C-431/93, Jeroen van Schijndel and Johannes Nicolaas Cornelis van Veen v Stichting Pensioenfonds voor Fysiotherapeuten, European Court reports 1995 Page I-04705, par. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In international law===
''Iura novit curia'' is widely applied by [[international court]]s as a general principle of law. While the [[ICTY]] declined to do so in one case, the regulations of the [[International Criminal Court]] now provide for it.&lt;ref name="Cryer 377"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cryer|first=Robert Cryer|title=An introduction to international criminal law and procedure|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|pages=377|isbn=978-0-521-87609-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p0-jFTnSy7kC&amp;pg=PA377}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has also been recognized by the  [[International Court of Justice]] as generally applicable in international proceedings,&lt;ref name="Oesch 50"&gt;{{cite book|last=Oesch|first=Matthias|title=Standards of review in WTO dispute resolution|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|page=50|isbn=978-0-19-926892-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWioIqABjy4C&amp;pg=PA50}}, where reference is made to the Court's invocation of the principle in the ''[[Fisheries Jurisdiction]]'' and ''[[Nicaragua v. United States]]'' cases.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]]&lt;ref name="Pasqualucci 154"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pasqualucci|first=Jo M.|title=The practice and procedure of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|page=154|isbn=978-0-521-53335-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4VKb1FpSodMC&amp;pg=PA154}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Trade Organization]]'s adjudicating bodies.&lt;ref name="Ortino 167"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ortino|first=Federico|author2=Petersmann, Ernst-Ulrich|title=The WTO dispute settlement system, 1995-2003|publisher=Kluwer Law International|year=2004|page=167|isbn=978-90-411-2232-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e2TVn9sdOsUC&amp;pg=PA167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
The maxim is sometimes quoted as ''jura novit curia'', ''iura noscit curia'', ''curia iura novit'', ''curia novit legem'' or variants thereof.&lt;ref name="Derlén 314" /&gt; It is sometimes misspelled as ''iuris novit curia'' or ''iura novat curia''.

The '''Jersey Competition Regulatory Authority''' (JCRA) is the general [[Competition regulator|competition]], postal and telecommunications [[regulatory authority]] for [[Jersey]], a British [[Crown Dependency]] off the coast of [[Normandy]], [[France]].

==History==

The Jersey Competition Regulatory Authority was set up by the [[States of Jersey]] in 2001 under the Competition Regulatory Authority (Jersey) Law 2001. It is an independent body, accountable to the Minister for Economic Development, with responsibility for promoting competition and consumer interests through economic regulation and competition law. The JCRA is responsible for the regulation of [[telecommunications]] under the sector-specific Telecommunications (Jersey) Law 2002, and is responsible for regulating postal operators under the Postal Services (Jersey) Law 2004. As regards competition law, it is responsible for administering and enforcing the Competition (Jersey) Law 2005. The JCRA also advises the Minister and other States Departments from time to time on issues relating to competition and economic regulation.

Decisions of the authority are determined by the JCRA Board that consists of a Chairman, three non-executive directors and the Executive Director. Since September 2010 the JCRA  shares its Executive Director with the [[Guernsey]] Office of Utility Regulation.

==CICRA==

In December 2010 JCRA working with the Guernsey Competition and Regulatory Authority created [[CICRA|CICRA, the Channel Islands Competition and Regulatory Authorities]].&lt;ref name="CICRA2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cicra.gg/_files/Annual%20Report%202012.pdf |title=Annual Report 2012 |publisher=CICRA}}&lt;/ref&gt; CICRA taking over the majority of work previously undertaken by JCRA.

'''John R. McConathy''' (April 9, 1930 &amp;ndash; April 19, 2016) was an American professional [[basketball]] player and educator, originally from [[Bienville Parish, Louisiana|Bienville Parish]] in [[North Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=bbr&gt;[https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mcconjo01.html John McConathy]. basketball-reference.com. Retrieved on February 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; McConathy was selected in the [[1951 NBA Draft]] by the [[Syracuse Nationals]] after a collegiate career at [[Northwestern State Demons basketball|Northwestern State]] in [[Natchitoches, Louisiana]], in which he was an [[All-America]]n player.&lt;ref name=bbr/&gt; He played for the [[Milwaukee Hawks]] in [[1951–52 NBA season|1951–52]] and averaged 1.3 points, 1.8 rebounds and 0.7 assists per contest in 11 games.&lt;ref name=bbr/&gt;

==Background==

McConathy was born in [[rural]] Sailes near [[Gibsland, Louisiana|Gibsland]] in Bienville Parish, one of three sons, one still living, of Oliver Leslie McConathy (1904-1982) and the former Marie Cole (1907-1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/42489765|title=Oliver Leslie McConathy|publisher=Findagrave.com|accessdate=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, he maintained a farm in Sailes.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Career==

After graduation from Northwestern State University and his brief professional basketball career, McConathy was employed  by the [[Bienville Parish School Board]] at Gibsland and [[Ringgold, Louisiana|Ringgold]] and then the [[Bossier Parish School Board]]. His Bossier High School basketball team won a state championship in 1960. He was the Bossier superintendent from 1972 to 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktbs.com/story/31767260/nsu-basketball-legend-passes-away|title=NSU basketball legend passes away|date=April 19, 2016|author=Tiffany Flournoy|publisher=[[KTBS-TV]]|accessdate=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity, he was a driving force behind the establishment of [[Bossier Parish Community College]], at which his oldest son, [[Mike McConathy]], was the basketball coach from 1983 to 1999. Mike McConathy then became basketball coach at Northwestern State University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/sports/college/2016/04/19/nsu-hoops-legend-john-mcconathy-dies/83229914/|title=NSU hoops legend John McConathy dies at 86|author=Scott Ferrell|publisher=''The Shreveport Times''|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latechsports.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/092811aaa.html LA Tech Hall of Famer: Mike McConathy]. Retrieved on February 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; a position which he still fills.

After he retired as school superintendent, McConathy worked for two decades as an agent for the [[New York Life Insurance Company]]. He was a founding member of Citizens National Bank, of which he was a former board chairman for twenty-five years and remained a bank director at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Family==

McConathy was married to the former Corene Floyd (born March 1933). There are four McConathy children, Coach Mike McConathy and wife, Connie, of Natchitoches, Bill McConathy and wife, Anne, of [[Haughton, Louisiana|Haughton]] in south Bossier Parish, Pat McConathy and wife, Suanne, of Bossier City, and Melinda McConathy Guest and husband, Greg, of Bossier City, and eleven grandchildren.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/shreveporttimes/obituary.aspx?n=john-mcconathy&amp;pid=179692385&amp;fhid=10218#sthash.IJzLoewR.dpuf|title=John McConathy|publisher=''[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Shreveport Times]]''|accessdate=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; McConathy was an active member of the First [[Southern Baptist|Baptist Church]] of Bossier City. McConathy died in his sleep at the age of eighty-six. Pastors Brad Jurkovich of First Baptist and Justin Haigler of The Simple Church officiated on April 23 at his funeral at First Baptist Bossier. Former pastor [[Fred L. Lowery]] officiated thereafter graveside at Williamson Cemetery in Sailes, at which his parents are also interred.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

A '''jury''' is a sworn body of people convened to render an [[impartiality|impartial]] [[verdict]] (a [[Question of fact|finding of fact]] on a question) officially submitted to them by a [[court]], or to set a [[sentence (law)|penalty]] or [[Judgment (law)|judgment]]. Modern juries tend to be found in courts to ascertain the guilt, or lack thereof, in a crime.  In Anglophone jurisdictions, the verdict may be ''guilty'' or ''not guilty'' (''[[not proven]]''; a verdict of acquittal, based on the state's failure to prove guilt rather than any proof of innocence, is also available in [[Scotland]]). The old institution of [[grand jury|grand juries]] still exists in some places, particularly the [[United States]], to investigate whether enough evidence of a crime exists to bring someone to trial.

The modern criminal court jury arrangement has evolved out of the medieval juries in England. Members were supposed to inform themselves of crimes and then of the details of the crimes. Their function was therefore closer to that of a grand jury than that of a [[trial by jury|jury in a trial]].

==Etymology==
The word ''jury'' derives from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] ''juré'' ("sworn"). Juries are most common in [[common law]] [[Adversarial system|adversarial-system]] [[jurisdiction]]s. In the modern system, juries act as [[Trier of fact|triers of fact]], while judges act as triers of law (but see [[Jury#Jury nullification|nullification]]). A trial without a jury (in which both questions of fact and [[Question of law|questions of law]] are decided by a judge) is known as a [[bench trial]].

==Types of jury==

===Petit jury===
{{main|Petit jury}}
The "petit jury" (or "trial jury", sometimes "petty jury") hears the [[evidence]] in a [[trial]] as presented by both the [[plaintiff]] (petitioner) and the [[defendant]] (respondent). After hearing the evidence and often [[jury instructions]] from the [[judge]], the group retires for [[deliberation]], to consider a verdict. The majority required for a verdict varies. In some cases it must be unanimous, while in other jurisdictions it may be a majority or [[supermajority]]. A jury that is unable to come to a verdict is referred to as a [[hung jury]]. The size of the jury varies; in [[Criminal law|criminal cases]] involving serious felonies there are usually 12 jurors.

In [[Civil law (common law)|civil cases]] many trials require fewer than twelve jurors.

===Grand jury===
{{main|Grand jury}}
A grand jury, a type of jury now confined almost exclusively to federal courts and some state jurisdictions in the United States, determines whether there is enough evidence for a [[Criminal procedure|criminal trial]] to go forward. Grand juries carry out this duty by examining evidence presented to them by a [[prosecutor]] and issuing [[indictment]]s, or by investigating alleged [[crime]]s and issuing [[Wiktionary:presentment|presentments]]. A grand jury is traditionally larger than and distinguishable from the petit jury used during a trial, usually with 12 jurors. It is not required that a suspect be notified of grand jury proceedings.  Grand juries can also be used for filing charges in the form of a [[sealed indictment]] against unaware suspects who are arrested later by a surprise police visit.

In addition to their primary role in screening criminal prosecutions and assisting in the investigation of crimes, grand juries in California, Florida,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamisao.com/publications/grandjuryreports.htm |title=CURRENT GRAND JURY REPORTS - Miami Dade Office of the State Attorney |publisher=Miamisao.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some other U.S. states are sometimes utilized to perform an investigative and policy audit function similar to that filled by the [[Government Accountability Office]] in the United States federal government and legislative state auditors in many U.S. states.

===Coroner's jury===
{{main|Coroner's jury}}
A third kind of jury, known as a coroner's jury can be convened in some common law jurisdiction in connection with an [[inquest]] by a [[coroner]].  A coroner is a public official (often an elected local government official in the United States), who is charged with determining the circumstances leading to a death in ambiguous or suspicious cases.  A coroner's jury is generally a body that a coroner can convene on an optional basis in order to increase public confidence in the coroner's finding where there might otherwise be a controversy.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Section 1245.1 of Pennsylvania's codified laws regarding coroners. http://www.pacoroners.org/Laws.php&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, coroner's juries are most often convened in order to avoid the appearance of impropriety by one governmental official in the criminal justice system toward another if no charges are filed against the person causing the death, when a governmental party such as a law enforcement officer is involved in the death.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Inquest Schedule, Jury Findings and Vedicts (2013) of British Columbia. http://www.pssg.gov.bc.ca/coroners/schedule/index.htm (retrieved March 8, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
Serving on a jury is normally compulsory for individuals who are qualified for jury service. A jury is intended to be an impartial panel capable of reaching a verdict. Procedures and requirements may include a fluent understanding of the language and the opportunity to test jurors' neutrality or otherwise exclude jurors who are perceived as likely to be less than neutral or partial to one side. Juries are initially chosen randomly, usually from the eligible population of adult citizens residing in the court's jurisdictional area. [[Jury selection]] in the United States usually includes organized questioning of the prospective jurors (jury pool) by the lawyers for the plaintiff and the defendant and by the judge&amp;mdash;[[voir dire]]&amp;mdash;as well as rejecting some jurors because of bias or inability to properly serve ("challenge for cause"), and the discretionary right of each side to reject a specified number of jurors without having to prove a proper cause for the rejection ("peremptory challenge"), before the jury is [[wikt:impanel|impaneled]].

A head juror is called the "foreperson", "foreman" or "presiding juror". The foreperson may be chosen before the trial begins, or at the beginning of the jury's deliberations. The foreperson may be selected by the judge or by vote of the jurors, depending on the jurisdiction. The foreperson's role may include asking questions (usually to the judge) on behalf of the jury, [[Facilitator|facilitating]] jury discussions, and announcing the verdict of the jury.

Since there is always the possibility of jurors not completing a trial for health or other reasons, often one or more alternate jurors are selected. Alternates are present for the entire trial but do not take part in deliberating the case and deciding the verdict unless one or more of the impaneled jurors are removed from the jury.  In Connecticut, alternate jurors are dismissed before the panel of sworn jurors begin deliberation.  Connecticut General Statutes 51-243(e) and 54-82h do not allow alternate jurors to be segregated from the regular sworn jurors. In civil cases in Connecticut, C.G.S. 51-243(e) provides that alternate jurors "shall be dismissed." This differs from the power given to the court in criminal trials under C.G.S. 54-82h, permitting the court not to dismiss the alternate jurors, and to have the regular jury panel begin deliberations.

When an insufficient number of summoned jurors appear in court to handle a matter, the law in many jurisdictions empowers the jury commissioner or other official convening the jury to involuntarily impress bystanders in the vicinity of the place where the jury is to be convened to serve on the jury.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Sections 13-71-112 and 30-10-607, Colorado Revised Statutes&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical roots==
[[File:The Jury by John Morgan.jpg|thumb|''The Jury'', an 1861 painting of a British jury]]

The modern jury evolved out of the ancient custom of many ancient [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes whereby a group of men of good character was used to investigate crimes and judge the accused. The same custom evolved into the [[vehmic court]] system in medieval Germany. In Anglo-Saxon England, juries investigated crimes. After the [[Norman Conquest]], some parts of the country preserved juries as the means of investigating crimes. The use of ordinary members of the community to consider crimes was unusual in ancient cultures, but was nonetheless also found in ancient Greece.

The modern [[jury trial]] evolved out of this custom in the mid-12th century during the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]].&lt;ref&gt;W.L. Warren, "Henry II" University of California Press,(1973)&lt;/ref&gt;  Juries, usually 6 or 12 men, were an "ancient institution" even then in some parts of England, at the same time as Members consisted of representatives of the basic units of local government—[[hundred (county subdivision)|hundred]]s (an administrative sub-division of the [[shire]], embracing several vills) and villages. Called juries of presentment, these men testified under oath to crimes committed in their neighbourhood.  The [[Assize of Clarendon]] in 1166 caused these juries to be adopted systematically throughout the country.  The jury in this period was "self-informing," meaning it heard very little evidence or testimony in court. Instead, jurors were recruited from the locality of the dispute and were expected to know the facts before coming to court.  The source of juror knowledge could include first-hand knowledge, investigation, and less reliable sources such as rumour and hearsay.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Klerman, [http://lawweb.usc.edu/users/dklerman/documents/Klerman.Self-informing.pdf "Was the Jury Every Self-Informing"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719013900/http://lawweb.usc.edu/users/dklerman/documents/Klerman.Self-informing.pdf |date=2011-07-19 }} Southern California Law Review 77: (2003), 123.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between 1166 and 1179 new procedures including a division of functions between the sheriff, the jury of local men, and the royal justices ushered in the era of the [[English Common Law]].  Sheriffs prepared cases for trial and found jurors with relevant knowledge and testimony.  Jurors 'found' a verdict by witnessing as to fact, even assessing and applying information from their own and community memory—little was written at this time and what was, such as deeds and writs, were subject to fraud.  Royal justices supervised trials, answered questions as to law, and announced the court's decision which was then subject to appeal.  Sheriffs executed the decision of the court. These procedures enabled Henry II to delegate authority without endowing his subordinates with too much power. ("Henry II" 293)

In 1215 the [[Catholic Church]] removed its sanction from all forms of ordeal—procedures by which suspects up to that time were 'tested' as to guilt (e.g., in the ordeal of hot metal, molten metal was sometimes poured into a suspected thief's hand.  If the wound healed rapidly and well, it was believed God found the suspect innocent, and if not then the suspect was found guilty).  With trial by ordeal banned, establishing guilt would have been problematic had England not had forty years of judicial experience.  Justices were by then accustomed to asking jurors of presentment about points of fact in assessing indictments; it was a short step to ask jurors if they concluded the accused was guilty as charged. ("Henry II" 358)

An early reference to a jury type group in England is in a decree issued by Aethelred at Wantage (997), which provided that in every Hundred "the twelve leading [[thegn]]s together with the [[Reeve (England)|reeve]] shall go out and swear on the [[relic]]s which are given into their hands, that they will not accuse any innocent man nor shield a guilty one."&lt;ref&gt;Oxford History of England, 2nd ed 1955, vol III Domesday Book to Magna Carta, A l Poole, pp.397–398.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting [[Æthelred the Unready#Did Æthelred invent the jury?|Wantage Code]] formally recognized legal customs that were part of the [[Danelaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wantage.com/museum/Local_History/Wantage%20Church%20History.pdf|title=Wantage Church History|last=Garnish|first=Lis|year=1995|work=Local History Series|publisher=[[Vale and Downland Museum]]|accessdate=2009-09-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925045004/http://www.wantage.com/museum/Local_History/Wantage%20Church%20History.pdf|archivedate=2007-09-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The testimonial concept can also be traced to [[Normandy]] before 1066, when a jury of nobles was established to decide land disputes. In this manner, the Duke, being the largest land owner, could not act as a judge in his own case.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, discussions of the Brunner theory of testimonial, rather than judicial participation as jury origin, explored in MacNair, [http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/17.3/macnair.html ''Vicinage and the Antecedents of the Jury - I. Theories''], in Law and History Review, Vol. 17 No 3, 1999, pp. 6–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest antecedents of modern jury systems is the jury in [[ancient Greece]], including the [[Polis|city-state]] of [[Athens]], where records of jury courts date back to 500 [[BCE]]. These juries voted by [[secret ballot]] and were eventually granted the power to annul [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] laws, thus introducing the practice of [[judicial review]]. In modern justice systems, law is considered "self-contained" and "distinct from other coercive forces, and perceived as separate from the political life of the community," but "all these barriers are absent in the context of classical Athens. In practice and in conception the law and its administration are in some important respects indistinguishable from the life of the community in general."&lt;ref&gt;Carey, Christopher. "Legal Space in Classical Athens." ''Greece &amp; Rome'' 41(2): October  1994, pp. 172–186.&lt;/ref&gt;

In juries of the [[Justice in Eyre|Justices in Eyre]], the [[bailiff]] of the hundred would choose 4 electors who in turn chose 12 others from their hundred, and from these were selected 12 jurors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= A History of English Law | volume= 1 | first= William Searle | last= Holdsworth | authorlink= William Searle Holdsworth | pages= 268–269 | year= 1922 | publisher= [[Little, Brown and Company|Little, Brown]] | edition= 3 | oclc= 48555551 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DQF-ASQE7xAC&amp;pg=PA268 | ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century England===
In 1730, the British Parliament passed the Bill for Better Regulation of Juries.&lt;ref&gt;Dowlen, Oliver. Sorted: Civic Lotteries and the Future of Public Participation. (MASS LBP: Toronto, 2008) pp 38&lt;/ref&gt; The Act stipulated that the list of all those liable for jury service was to be posted in each parish and that jury panels would be selected by lot, also known as [[sortition]], from these lists. Its aim was to prevent middle-class citizens from evading their responsibilities by financially putting into question the neutrality of the under-sheriff, the official entrusted with impanelling juries.

Prior to the Act, the main means of ensuring impartiality was by allowing legal challenges to the sheriff's choices. The new provisions did not specifically aim at establishing impartiality, but had the effect of reinforcing the authority of the jury by guaranteeing impartiality at the point of selection.

The example of early 18th century England legal reform shows how civic lotteries can be used to organize the duties and responsibilities of the citizen body in relation to the state. It established the impartiality and neutrality of juries as well as reiterating the dual nature of the citizen-state relationship. The need for a leader/organizer in a jury is very important, in order to get a proper and agreed verdict.

==Trial jury size==
[[File:Jury duty.jpg|300px|thumb|right|About 50 prospective jurors awaiting jury selection]]

The size of the jury is to provide a "cross-section" of the public. In ''[[Williams v. Florida]]'', {{ussc|399|78|1970}}, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that a [[Florida]] [[State law|state]] jury of six was sufficient, that "the 12-man panel is not a necessary ingredient of "trial by jury," and that respondent's refusal to impanel more than the six members provided for by Florida law "did not violate petitioner's [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] rights as [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|applied]] to the States through the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Williams'', at 86&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Ballew v. Georgia]]'', {{ussc|435|223|1978}}, the Supreme Court ruled that the number of jurors could not be reduced below six.

In ''Brownlee v The Queen'' (2001) 207 CLR 278, the [[High Court of Australia]] unanimously held that a jury of 12 members was not an essential feature of "trial by jury" in section 80 of the [[Australian Constitution]].

In [[Scotland]], a jury in a criminal trial consists of 15 jurors, which is thought to be the largest in the world. In 2009 a review by the [[Scottish Government]] regarding the possibility of reduction&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7368294.stm Review could reduce jury numbers] BBC News, 26 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; led to the decision to retain 15 jurors, with the [[Cabinet Secretary for Justice]] stating that after extensive consultation, he had decided that Scotland had got it "uniquely right".&lt;ref&gt;[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/latestnews/Scotland39s-unique-15strong--juries.5252536.jp Scotland's unique 15-strong juries will not be abolished] The Scotsman, 11 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Trials in the [[Republic of Ireland]] which are scheduled to last over 2 months can, but do not have to, have 15 jurors.

A study by the [[University of Glasgow]] suggested that a civil jury of 12 people was ineffective because a few jurors ended up dominating the discussion, and that seven was a better number because more people feel comfortable speaking, and they have an easier time reaching a unanimous decision.&lt;ref&gt;''Is "The More the Merrier?"'', [[Mental Floss]], November–December 2011, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Verkaik|first1=Robert|title=Juries 'swayed by dominant speakers'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/juries-swayed-by-dominant-speakers-9167289.html|accessdate=May 22, 2018|work=Independent|date=September 3, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Uhlig|first1=Robert|title=Juries are 'too large for correct verdicts'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1339399/Juries-are-too-large-for-correct-verdicts.html|accessdate=May 22, 2018|work=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|date=September 4, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integrity==
For juries to fulfil their role of analyzing the facts of the case, there are strict rules about their use of information during the trial. Juries are often instructed to avoid learning about the case from any source other than the trial (for example from [[Mass media|media]] or the internet) and not to conduct their own investigations (such as independently visiting a [[crime scene]]). Parties to the case, lawyers, and witnesses are not allowed to speak with a member of the jury. Doing these things may constitute [[reversible error]]. Rarely, such as in very high-profile cases, the court may order a jury [[Jury sequestration|sequestered]] for the deliberation phase or for the entire trial.

Jurors are generally required to keep their deliberations in [[Confidentiality|strict confidence]] during the trial and deliberations, and in some jurisdictions even after a verdict is rendered. In [[English law]], the jury's deliberations must never be disclosed outside the jury, even years after the case; to repeat parts of the trial or verdict is considered to be [[contempt of court]], a criminal offense. In the United States, confidentiality is usually only required until a verdict has been reached, and jurors have sometimes made remarks that called into question whether a verdict was properly reached. In Australia, academics are permitted to scrutinize the jury process only after obtaining a certificate or approval from the Attorney-General.

Because of the importance of preventing [[undue influence]] on a jury, [[jury tampering]] (like [[witness tampering]]) is a serious crime, whether attempted through [[bribery]], [[Assault (tort)|threat of violence]], or other means. Jurors themselves can also be held liable if they deliberately compromise their impartiality.

==Role==
The role  of the jury is described as that of a [[finder of fact]], while the judge is seen as having the sole responsibility of interpreting the appropriate law and instructing the jury accordingly. The jury determines the truth or falsity of factual allegations and renders a verdict on whether a criminal defendant is guilty, or a civil defendant is civilly liable.  Sometimes a jury makes specific findings of fact in what is called a "special verdict."  A verdict without specific findings of fact that includes only findings of guilt, or civil liability and an overall amount of civil damages, if awarded, is called a "general verdict."

Juries are often justified because they leaven the law with community norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Norms Approach to Jury "Nullification:" Interests, Values, and Scripts|author=Sanders, Joseph|publisher=Law &amp; Policy|volume=30|issue=1|pages=12–45|date=16 January 2008|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119400701/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9930.2008.00268.x|journal=Law &amp; Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt; A jury trial verdict in a case is binding only in that case, and is not a legally binding precedent in other cases.  For example, it would be possible for one jury to find that particular conduct is negligent, and another jury to find that the conduct is not negligent, without either verdict being legally invalid, on precisely the same factual evidence.  Of course, no two witnesses are exactly the same, and even the same witness will not express testimony in exactly the same way twice, so this would be difficult to prove.  It is the role of the judge, not the jury, to determine what law applies to a particular set of facts.  However, occasionally jurors find the law to be invalid or unfair, and on that basis acquit the defendant, regardless of the evidence presented that the defendant violated the law. This is commonly referred to as "jury nullification of law" or simply [[jury nullification]]. When there is no jury ("bench trial"), the judge makes rulings on both questions of law and of fact. In most continental European jurisdictions, judges have more power in a trial and the role and powers of a jury are often restricted. Actual jury law and trial procedures differ significantly between countries.

The collective knowledge and deliberate nature of juries are also given as reasons in their favor:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Detailed interviews with jurors after they rendered verdicts in trials involving complex expert testimony have demonstrated careful and critical analysis. The interviewed jurors clearly recognized that the experts were selected within an adversary process. They employed sensible techniques to evaluate the experts’ testimony, such as assessing the completeness and consistency of the testimony, comparing it with other evidence at the trial, and evaluating it against their own knowledge and life experience. Moreover, the research shows that in deliberations jurors combine their individual perspectives on the evidence and debate its relative merits before arriving at a verdict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.america.gov/st/usg-english/2009/July/20090706164826ebyessedo0.4126551.html Jury Trials: In Favor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128052243/http://www.america.gov/st/usg-english/2009/July/20090706164826ebyessedo0.4126551.html |date=2010-11-28 }} eJournal USA, Anatomy of a Jury Trial, 1 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the United States, juries are sometimes called on, when asked to do so by a judge in the jury instructions, to make factual findings on particular issues.  This may include, for example, aggravating circumstances which will be used to elevate the defendant's sentence if the defendant is convicted.  This practice was required in all [[death penalty]] cases in ''[[Blakely v. Washington]]'', {{ussc|542|296|2004}}, where the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] ruled that allowing judges to make such findings unilaterally violates the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. A similar Sixth Amendment argument in ''[[Apprendi v. New Jersey]]'', {{ussc|530|466|2000}} resulted in the Supreme Court's expansion of the requirement to all criminal cases, holding that "any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt".&lt;ref&gt;''Apprendi'', at 490&lt;/ref&gt;

Many U.S. jurisdictions permit the seating of an [[advisory jury]] in a civil case in which there is no right to trial by jury to provide non-binding advice to the trial judge,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52 (2011); Colorado Rule of Civil Procedure 52 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; although this procedural tool is rarely used.  For example, a judge might seat an advisory jury to guide the judge in awarding non-economic damages (such as "pain and suffering" damages) in a case where there is no right to a jury trial, such as (depending on state law) a case involving "equitable" rather than "legal" claims.

In Canada, juries are also allowed to make suggestions for sentencing periods at the time of sentencing.  The suggestions of the jury are presented before the judge by the Crown prosecutor(s) before the sentence is handed down.  In a small number of U.S. jurisdictions, including the states of Tennessee&lt;ref&gt;Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 40-20-104, 40-20-107&lt;/ref&gt; and Texas,&lt;ref&gt;Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 37.07 Sec. 1(b)&lt;/ref&gt; juries are charged both with the task of finding guilt or innocence as well assessing and fixing sentences.

However, this is not the practice in most other legal systems based on the English tradition, in which judges retain sole responsibility for deciding sentences according to law.  The exception is the award of [[damages]] in English law [[Slander and libel|libel]] cases, although a judge is now obliged to make a recommendation to the jury as to the appropriate amount.

In legal systems based on English tradition, findings of fact by a jury, and jury conclusions that could be supported by jury findings of fact even if the specific factual basis for the verdict is not known, are entitled to great deference on appeal.  In other legal systems, it is generally possible for an appellate court to reconsider both findings of fact and conclusions of law made in the trial court, and in those systems evidence may be presented to appellate courts in what amounts to a trial de novo (new trial) of appealed findings of fact.  The finality of trial court findings of fact in legal systems based on the English tradition has major impact on court procedure in these systems.  This makes it imperative that lawyers be highly prepared for trial because errors and misjudgments related to the presentation of evidence at trial to a jury cannot generally be corrected later on appeal, particularly in court systems based on the English tradition.  The higher the stakes, the more this is true.  Surprises at trial are much more consequential in court systems based on the English tradition than they are in other legal systems{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.

==Jury nullification==
{{Main|Jury nullification}}

''Jury nullification'' means deciding not to apply the law to the facts in a particular case by jury decision.  In other words, it is "the process whereby a jury in a criminal case effectively nullifies a law by acquitting a defendant regardless of the weight of evidence against him or her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=jury nullification definition - Dictionary - MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861695062 |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kws7zVbQ?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861695062 |archivedate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th and 18th centuries there was a series of such cases, starting in 1670 with the trial of the Quaker [[William Penn]] which asserted the (de facto) right, or at least power, of a jury to render a verdict contrary to the facts or law. A good example is the case of one [[Carnegie of Finhaven]] who in 1728 accidentally killed the Scottish [[Charles Lyon, 6th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Earl of Strathmore]].  As the defendant had undoubtedly killed the Earl, the law (as it stood) required the jury to render the verdict that the case had been "proven" and cause Carnegie of Finhaven to die for an accidental killing.  Instead the jury asserted what it believed to be their "ancient right" to judge the whole case and not just the facts and brought in the verdict of "not guilty". This led to the development of the not proven verdict in ''[[Scots law]].''

Today in the United States, juries are instructed by the judge to follow the judge's instructions concerning what is the law, and to render a verdict solely on the evidence presented in court.  Important past exercises of nullification include cases involving [[slavery]] (see [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]]), [[freedom of the press]] (see [[John Peter Zenger]]), and [[freedom of religion]] (see [[William Penn#Persecutions|William Penn]]).

In ''[[United States v. Moylan]]'', {{West|F|417|2|1002|4th. Cir.|1969|}}, [[Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal]] unanimously ruled: "If the jury feels that the law under which the defendant is accused is unjust, or exigent circumstances justified the actions of the accused, or for any reason which appeals to their logic or passion, the jury has the right to acquit, and the courts must abide that decision."  The [[Fully Informed Jury Association]] is a non-profit educational organization dedicated to informing jurors of their rights and seeking the passage of laws to require judges to inform jurors that they can and should judge the law.  In ''[[Sparf v. United States]]'', {{ussc|156|51|1895}}, the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, held that a trial judge has no responsibility to inform the jury of the right to nullify laws.

Modern American jurisprudence is generally intolerant of the practice, and a juror can be removed from a case if the judge believes that the juror is aware of the power of nullification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washburnlaw.edu/wlj/46-2/articles/parmenter-andrew.pdf Nullifying the Jury: "The Judicial Oligarchy" Declares War on Jury Nullification] [[Washburn Law Journal]] May 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jury equity===
In the United Kingdom, a similar power exists, often called "jury equity". This enables a jury to reach a decision in direct contradiction with the law if they feel the law is unjust. This can create a persuasive precedent for future cases, or render prosecutors reluctant to bring a charge &amp;ndash; thus a jury has the power to influence the law.

The standard justification of jury equity is taken from the final few pages of Lord Devlin's book "Trial by Jury". Devlin explained jury equity through two now-famous metaphors: that the jury is "the lamp that shows that freedom lives" and that it is a "little parliament".&lt;ref&gt;[https://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/schoolofhumanitiesandsocialsciences/law/pdfs/Trial_by_Jury.pdf Patrick Devlin, 'Trial by Jury'] (Stevens &amp; Sons 1956)&lt;/ref&gt; The second metaphor emphasises that, just as members of parliament are generally dominated by government but can occasionally assert their independence, juries are usually dominated by judges but can, in extraordinary circumstances, throw off this control.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/13538022/Controlling_Devlins_Jury_what_the_jury_thinks_and_what_the_jury_sees_online_published_2012_ Kevin Crosby, 'Controlling Devlin's Jury: what the jury thinks, and what the jury sees online'] [2012] Criminal Law Review 15&lt;/ref&gt; Devlin thereby sought to emphasise that neither jury equity nor judicial control are set in stone.

Perhaps the best example of modern-day jury equity in [[England and Wales]] was the acquittal of [[Clive Ponting]], on a charge of revealing secret information, under section 2 of the [[Official Secrets Act 1911]] in 1985. Mr Ponting's defence was that the revelation was in the public interest. The trial judge directed the jury that "the public interest is what the government of the day says it is" &amp;ndash; effectively a direction to the jury to convict. Nevertheless, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty.

Another example is the acquittal in 1989 of [[Michael Randle]] and [[Pat Pottle]], who confessed in open court to charges of springing the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Espionage|spy]] [[George Blake]] from [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)|Wormwood Scrubs Prison]] and smuggling him to [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]] in 1966. Pottle successfully appealed to the jury to disregard the judge's instruction that they consider only whether the defendants were guilty in law, and assert a jury's ancient right to throw out a politically motivated prosecution, in this case compounded by its cynical untimeliness.&lt;ref name = "New Statesman"&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/200010090010  New Statesman], 2000-10-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland (with a separate legal system from that of England and Wales) although technically the "not guilty" verdict was originally a form of jury nullification, over time the interpretation has changed so that now the "not guilty" verdict has become the normal one when a jury is not persuaded of guilt and the "not proven" verdict is only used when the jury is not certain of innocence or guilt.&lt;ref name="Luckhurst"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article431121.ece|title=The case for keeping 'not proven' verdict|last=Luckhurst|first=Tim|date=March 20, 2005|publisher=The Sunday Times, TimesOnline|accessdate=2009-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is absolutely central to Scottish and English law that there is a presumption of innocence. It is not a trivial distinction since any shift in the burden of proof is a significant change which undermines the safeguard for the citizen.&lt;ref name="Broadbridge"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:1q0AwgiEK4YJ:www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/briefing-papers/SN02710.pdf+The+%22not+proven%22+verdict+in+Scotland&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShYUAfa5QQmYXpiKsnYiY_Y4cf1V24unl8WXlxeqkGGq2TGLMWEzWYzUOwVXXcmWEbuiU889AIav_5NfHv5azs4JehpGcDQM6rDZvx1QQo9-ZK0UW48FSB6dbv23RneDtOcm8n6&amp;sig=AHIEtbRUslG1qVXFv22gEAIoQUnV3ZQoGw&amp;pli=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117151822/https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:1q0AwgiEK4YJ:www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/briefing-papers/SN02710.pdf+The+%22not+proven%22+verdict+in+Scotland&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShYUAfa5QQmYXpiKsnYiY_Y4cf1V24unl8WXlxeqkGGq2TGLMWEzWYzUOwVXXcmWEbuiU889AIav_5NfHv5azs4JehpGcDQM6rDZvx1QQo9-ZK0UW48FSB6dbv23RneDtOcm8n6&amp;sig=AHIEtbRUslG1qVXFv22gEAIoQUnV3ZQoGw&amp;pli=1|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 January 2012|title=The "not proven" verdict in Scotland|last=Broadbridge|first=Sally|date=15 May 2009|work=Standard Note SN/HA/2710|publisher=U.K. Parliament, House of Commons, Home Affairs Section|accessdate=2009-09-24}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-trial juries==
[[File:Wine jury.jpg|thumb|A wine jury]]
Besides petit juries for jury trials and grand juries for issuing indictments, juries are sometimes used in non-legal or quasi-legal contexts. Blue ribbon juries attend to civic matters as an ad-hoc body in the executive branch of a government. Outside government, a jury or panel of judges may make determinations in [[competition]], such as at a [[wine tasting]], [[art exhibition]], talent contest, or [[Reality television|reality game show]]. These types of contests are [[Juried (competition)|juried competitions]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Blue ribbon juries are juries selected from prominent, well-educated citizens, sometimes to investigate a particular problem such as civic corruption. Blue ribbon juries cannot be used in real trials, which require constitutional safeguards to produce a jury of one's peers. The blue-ribbon jury is intended to overcome the problems of ordinary juries in interpreting complex technical or commercial questions.  In the United States blue-ribbon juries were provided for by statutes, the terms varying by jurisdiction.

==Trial procedures==

===Australia===

====States====
Each [[Australian States|state]] may determine the extent to which the use of a jury is used. The use of a jury is optional for [[Lawsuit|civil]] trials in any Australian state.{{Citation needed|reason=untrue, used in Victoria|date=September 2011}} The use of a jury in criminal trials is generally by unanimous verdict of 12 lay members of the public. Some States provide exceptions such as majority (11-to-1 or 10-to-2) verdicts where a jury cannot otherwise reach a verdict.&lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;Smith v The Queen [2015] HCA 27 [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2015/27.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a state law may allow an accused person to elect to use a judge-only trial rather than the default jury provision.

====Commonwealth (Federal)====
The [[Constitution of Australia]] provides in section 80 that 'the trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury'. The Commonwealth can determine which offences are 'on indictment'.&lt;ref&gt;''Cheng v The Queen'' (2000) 203 CLR 248 (McHugh and Callinan JJ, Kirby J dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt; It would be entirely consistent with the Constitution that a [[homicide]] offence could be tried not 'on indictment,' or conversely that a simple [[Assault]] could be tried 'on indictment.' This interpretation has been criticised a 'mockery' of the section, rendering it useless.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Federal Court of Bankruptcy; Ex parte Lowenstein'' (1939) 59 CLR 556 (Dixon and Evatt JJ dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a trial 'on indictment' has been prescribed, it is an essential element that it be found by a unanimous verdict of guilty by 12 lay members of the public. This requirement stems from the (historical) meaning of 'jury' at the time that the Constitution was written and is (in principle) thus an integral element of trial by jury.&lt;ref&gt;''Cheatle v The Queen'' (1993) 177 CLR 541 (per curiam)&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike States, an accused person cannot elect a Judge-only trial, even where both the accused and the prosecutor seek such a trial.&lt;ref&gt;Alqudsi v The Queen [2016] HCA 24 (French CJ dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
The Belgian Constitution provides that all cases involving the most serious crimes be judged by juries. As a safeguard against libel cases, press crimes can also only be tried by jury. Racism is excluded from this safeguard.

Twelve jurors decide by a qualified majority of two-thirds whether the defendant is guilty or not. A tied vote results in 'not guilty'; a '7 guilty - 5 not guilty' vote is transferred to the 3 professional judges who can, by unanimity, reverse the majority to 'not guilty'. The sentence is delivered by a majority of the 12 jurors and the 3 professional judges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int////tkp197/viewhbkm.asp?action=open&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649&amp;key=75587&amp;sessionId=18652243&amp;skin=hudoc-en&amp;attachment=true ''Taxquet v Belgium'', 13-01-2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531215646/http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int////tkp197/viewhbkm.asp?action=open&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649&amp;key=75587&amp;sessionId=18652243&amp;skin=hudoc-en&amp;attachment=true |date=2012-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the ''Taxquet'' ruling the juries give nowadays the most important motives that lead them to their verdict. The procedural codification has been altered to meet the demands formulated by the European Court of Human Rights.

===Brazil===
The [[Constitution of Brazil]] provides that only willful crimes against life, namely full or [[attempted murder|attempted]] [[murder]], [[abortion]], [[infanticide]] and suicide instigation, be judged by juries. Seven jurors vote in secret to decide whether the defendant is guilty or not, and decisions are taken by majority.

[[Manslaughter]] and other crimes in which the killing was committed without intent, however, are judged by a professional judge instead.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], juries are used for some criminal trials but not others. For [[summary conviction offences]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_XXVII/20090812/en#anchorbo-ga:l_XXVII ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985 c C-46, s 785, "summary conviction court"]&lt;/ref&gt; or offences found under  section 553 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] (theft and fraud up to the value of $5,000 and certain nuisance offences), the trial is before a judge alone. For most [[indictable offence]]s, the accused person can elect to be tried by either a judge alone or a judge and jury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_XVIII/20090812/en#anchorbo-ga:l_XVIII ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 536]&lt;/ref&gt; In the most serious offences, found in [http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_XIV/20090812/en#anchorbo-ga:l_XIV section 469] of the Criminal Code (such as murder or [[treason]]), a judge and a jury are always used, unless both the accused and the prosecutor agree that the trial should not be in front of a jury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_XIV/20090812/en#anchorbo-ga:l_XIV ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, ss 471-473.]&lt;/ref&gt; The jury's verdict on the ultimate disposition of guilt or innocence must be unanimous,&lt;ref name="CanadaJury"&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_XXIII/20090812/en#anchorbo-ga:l_XXIII ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, Part XX: Jury Trials]&lt;/ref&gt; but can disagree on the evidentiary route that leads to that disposition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120801075614/http://www.canlii.ca/en/ca/scc/doc/1987/1987canlii53/1987canlii53.html ''R. v.

Robinson''] (2004), 189 C.C.C. (3d) 152 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Juries do not make a recommendation as to the length of sentence, except for parole ineligibility for [[Murder (Canadian law)|second-degree murder]] (but the judge is not bound by the jury's recommendation, and the jury is not required to make a recommendation).&lt;ref name="CanadaJury"/&gt;

[[Jury selection#Canada|Jury selection]] is in accordance with specific criteria. Prospective jurors may only be asked certain questions, selected for direct pertinence to impartiality or other relevant matters. Any other questions must be approved by the judge.

A jury in a criminal trial is initially composed of 12 jurors. The trial judge has the discretion to direct that one or two alternate jurors also be appointed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-360.html#docCont ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 631(2.1)].&lt;/ref&gt; If a juror is discharged during the course of the trial, the trial will continue with an alternate juror, unless the number of jurors goes below 10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-365.html#docCont ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c c-46, s 644.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'']] guarantees that anyone tried for an offence that has a maximum sentence of five or more years has the right to be tried by a jury (except for an offence under [[military law]]).

The names of jurors are protected by a [[publication ban]]. There is a specific criminal offence for disclosing anything that takes place during jury deliberations.&lt;ref name="CanadaJury" /&gt;

Juries are infrequently used in civil trials in Canada.  There are no civil juries in the courts of the Province of Quebec, nor in the [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]].

===France===

====In the Cour d'assises====

Three professional judges sit alongside six jurors in first instance proceedings or nine in appeal proceedings. Before 2012, there were nine or twelve jurors, but this was reduced to cut spending. A two-thirds majority is needed in order to convict the defendant. During these procedures, judges and jurors have equal positions on questions of fact, while judges decide on questions of procedure. Judges and jurors also have equal positions on sentencing.

===Germany===
Trial by jury was introduced in most German states after the revolutionary events of 1848. However, it remained controversial; and, early in the 20th century, there were moves to abolish it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Lay Judges in the German Criminal Courts | first1 = Gerhard | last1= Casper | first2= Hans | last2= Zeisel | journal= Journal of Legal Studies | volume= 1 | issue= 1 | date= January 1972 | jstor= 724014 | pages= 135–191 [139] | doi= 10.1086/467481 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Emminger Reform]] of January 4, 1924, during an [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] state of emergency, abolished the jury system and replaced it with a mixed system including bench trials and [[lay judge]]s.

In 1925, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] called for the reinstitution of the jury; a special meeting of the German Bar demanded revocation of the decrees, but "on the whole the abolition of the jury caused little commotion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Lay Judges in the German Criminal Courts | first1 = Gerhard | last1= Casper | first2= Hans | last2= Zeisel | journal= Journal of Legal Studies | volume= 1 | issue= 1 | date= January 1972 | jstor= 724014 | pages= 135–191 [140] | doi=10.1086/467481}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their verdicts were widely perceived as [[Justice|unjust]] and inconsistent.

Today, most misdemeanors are tried by a ''Strafrichter'', meaning a single judge at an ''Amtsgericht''; felonies and more severe misdemeanors are tried by a ''Schöffengericht'', also located at the ''Amtsgericht'', composed of 1 judge and 2 lay judges; some felonies are heard by ''Erweitertes Schöffengericht'', or extended ''Schöffengericht'', composed of 2 judges and 2 lay judges; severe felonies and other "special" crimes are tried by the ''große Strafkammer'', composed of 3 judges and 2 lay judges at the ''Landgericht'', with specially assigned courts for some crimes called ''Sonderstrafkammer'';  felonies resulting in the death of a human being are tried by the ''Schwurgericht'', composed of 3 judges and 2 lay judges, located at the ''Landgericht''; and serious crimes against the state are tried by the ''Strafsenat'', composed of 5 judges, at an ''Oberlandesgericht''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Lay Judges in the German Criminal Courts | first1 = Gerhard | last1= Casper | first2= Hans | last2= Zeisel | journal= Journal of Legal Studies | volume= 1 | issue= 1 | date= January 1972 | jstor= 724014 | pages= 135–191 [142] | doi=10.1086/467481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some civil cases, such as commercial law or patent law, there are also lay judges, who have to meet certain criteria (e.g., being a merchant).

===Hong Kong===
{{main|Jury system in Hong Kong}}
Article 86 of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] assures the practice of jury trials. Criminal cases in the High Court and some civil cases are tried by jury in [[Hong Kong]]. There is no jury in the District Court. In addition, from time to time, the Coroner's Court may summon a jury to decide the cause of death in an inquest.  Criminal cases are normally tried by a 7-person jury and sometimes, at the discretion of the court, a 9-person jury. Nevertheless, the Jury Ordinance requires that a jury in any proceedings should be composed of at least 5 jurors.

Although article 86 of the basic law states that ‘the principle of trial by jury previously practised in Hong Kong shall be maintained’, it does not guarantee that every case is to be tried by jury. In the case ''Chiang Lily v. Secretary for Justice'' (2010), the Court of Final Appeal agreed that ‘there is no right to trial by jury in Hong Kong.’

===India===
Parsis in India can LEGALLY use Jury System to decide divorces wherein randomly selected members called `delegates` from the community decide the fact of the matrimonial disputes of Parsis. Jury system for Parsi Matrimonial dispute cases is a mix of Panchayat system and Jury system found in US etc. countries. The law which governs this is `The Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936` as amended in 1988 &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fb.com/notes/1302292416456423|title=Jury system in Parsi Matrimonial Disputes|last=|first=|date=August 30, 2016|website=RIGHT TO RECALL AGAINST CORRUPTION - Facebook|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury found no place in the 1950 Indian Constitution, and it was ignored in many Indian states.   The Law Commission recommended its abolition in 1958 in its 14th Report. Jury trials were abolished in India in most courts after the infamous ''[[KM Nanavati v State of Maharashtra]]'' (1959) except for Matrimonial Disputes of Parsis by a very discrete process during the 1960s, finishing with the [[Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973|1973 Code of Criminal Procedure]], which is still in force today.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.droit.ens.fr/IMG/pdf/Lay_Justice_in_India_1.pdf|title=Lay Justice in India|last=Jean-Louis Halpérin|first=|authorlink=:fr:Jean-Louis Halpérin|date=25 March 2011|website=|publisher=[[École Normale Supérieure]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503122852/http://www.droit.ens.fr/IMG/pdf/Lay_Justice_in_India_1.pdf|archive-date=2014-05-03|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Nanavati'' case, Kawas Manekshaw Nanavati was tried for the murder of his wife Sylvia's paramour, Prem Ahuja. Nanavati surrendered himself to the police after killing Ahuja.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mansworldindia.com/cinema/love-death-and-scandal-in-bombay-nanavati-case-inspired-film-rustom-the-real-story/|title=Love/Death and Scandal in Bombay|date=2016-08-12|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident shocked the nation, got unprecedented media coverage, and inspired several books and movies. The case was the last jury trial held in India.
The central question of the case was whether the gun went off accidentally or whether it was a premeditated murder.

In the former scenario, Nanavati would be charged under the Indian penal code 302, for culpable homicide, with a maximum punishment of 10 years. In the latter, he would be charged with murder, with the sentence being death or life imprisonment. Nanavati pleaded not guilty. His defence team argued it was a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, while the prosecution argued it was premeditated murder.

The jury in the Greater Bombay sessions court pronounced Nanavati '''not guilty under 302''' with an 8–1 verdict. The sessions judge considered the acquittal as perverse and referred the case to the high court. The prosecution argued that the jury had been misled by the presiding judge on four crucial points. One, the onus of proving that it was an accident and not premeditated murder was on Nanavati. Two, was Sylvia's confession of the grave provocation for Nanavati, or any specific incident in Ahuja's bedroom or both. Three, the judge wrongly told the jury that the provocation can also come from a third person. And four, the jury was not instructed that Nanavati's defence had to be proved, to the extent that there is no reasonable doubt in the mind of a reasonable person. The court accepted the arguments, dismissed the jury's verdict and the case was freshly heard in the high court. Since the jury was alleged to have been influenced by media and public support for Nanavati, the Indian government abolished jury trials after the case.

Nanavati was finally pardoned by Vijayalakshmi Pandit, newly appointed Governor of Bombay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-km-nanavati-case-how-an-affair-turned-friends-into-foes-255957.html|title=Before You Watch Akshay Kumar's Rustom, Here's Everything You Need To Know About The Real Case|access-date=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===

The [[law of the Republic of Ireland]] is historically based on English common law and had a similar jury system.  Article 38 of the 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]] mandates trial by jury for criminal offences, with exceptions for [[summary offence|minor offences]], military tribunals, and where "the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice, and the preservation of public peace and order".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/en/constitution/index.html#part12 |title=CONSTITUTION OF IRELAND: TRIAL OF OFFENCES |date=August 2012|work=[[Irish Statute Book]] |accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[DPP v McNally]]''{{Full citation needed|date=February 2014}} sets out that a jury has the right to reach a not guilty verdict even in direct contradiction of the evidence.

===Italy===
In [[Italy]], a [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] jurisdiction, untrained judges are present only in the [[Corte d'Assise]], where two career magistrates are supported by six so-called ''Lay Judges'', who are raffled from the registrar of voters. Any Italian citizen, with no distinction of sex or religion, between 30 and 65 years of age, can be appointed as a lay judge; in order to be eligible as a lay judge for the ''Corte d'Assise'', however, there is a minimum educational requirement, as the lay judge must have completed his/her education at the ''Scuola Media'' (junior high school) level, while said level is raised for the ''Corte d'Assise d'Appello'' (appeal level of the Corte d'Assise) to the ''Scuola Superiore'' (senior high school) degree. In the Corte d'Assise, decisions concerning both fact and law matters are taken by the [[stipend]]iary judges and "Lay Judges" together at a special meeting behind closed doors, named ''Camera di Consiglio'' ("Counsel Chamber"), and the Court is subsequently required to publish written explanations of its decisions within 90 days from the verdict. Errors of law or inconsistencies in the explanation of a decision can and usually will lead to the annulment of the decision. A Court d'Assise and a Court d' Assise d'Appello decides on a majority of votes, and therefore predominantly on the votes of the lay judges, who are a majority of six to two, but in fact  lay judges, who are not trained to write such explanation and must rely on one or the other stipendiary judge to do it, are effectively prevented from overruling both of them.  The ''Corte d'Assise'' has jurisdiction to try crimes carrying a maximum penalty of 24 years in prison or life imprisonment, and other serious crimes; felonies that fall under its jurisdiction include [[terrorism]], murder, manslaughter, severe attempts against State personalities, as well as some matters of law requiring ethical and professional evaluations (ex. [[assisted suicide]]), while it generally has no jurisdiction over cases whose evaluation requires knowledge of Law which the "Lay Judges" generally don't have. Penalties imposed by the court can include [[life sentences]].

===New Zealand===
Juries are used in trials for all trials involving Category 4 offences such as treason, murder and manslaughter, although in exceptional circumstances a judge-alone trial may be ordered. At the option of the defendant, juries may be used in trials involving Category 3 offences, that is offences where the maximum penalty available is two years imprisonment or greater. In civil cases, juries are only used in cases of defamation, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution. Juries must initially try to reach a unanimous verdict, but if one cannot be reached in a reasonable timeframe, the judge may accept a majority verdict of all-but-one (i.e. 11–1 or 10–1) in criminal cases and three-quarters (i.e. 9–3 or 9–2) in civil cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NZ's first majority guilty verdict|publisher=Stuff|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/2563945/NZs-first-majority-guilty-verdict|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
Juries existed in Norway as early as the year 800, and perhaps even earlier.
They brought the jury system to [[England]] and Scotland. Juries were phased out as late as the 17th century, when Norway´s central government was in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].
Though Norway and Denmark had different legal systems throughout their personal union (1387-1536), and later under the governmental union (1536-1814), there was attempt to harmonize the legal systems of the two countries. Even if juries were abolished, the layman continued to play an important role in the legal system throughout in Norway.

The jury was reintroduced in 1887, and is solely used in criminal cases on the second tier of the three-tier Norwegian court system ("[[Court of appeal (Norway)|Lagmannsretten]]"). The jury consists of 10 people, and has to reach a majority verdict consisting of seven or more of the jurors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lov om rettergangsmåten i straffesaker (Straffeprosessloven)|publisher=Lovdata|url=http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-19810522-025-039.html|accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury never gives a reason for its verdict, rather it simply gives a "guilty" or "non-guilty" verdict.

In a sense, the concept of being judged by one's peers exists on both the first and second tier of the Norwegian court system: In [[Tingretten]], one judge and two lay judges preside, and in Lagmannsretten three judges and four lay judges preside (if a jury is not used). The lay judges do not hold any legal qualification, and represent the peers of the person on trial, as members of the general public. As a guarantee against any abuse of power by the educated elite, the number of lay judges always exceeds the number of appointed judges. In the [[Supreme Court of Norway|Supreme Court]], only [[Candidate of Law|trained lawyers]] are seated.

===Spain===
Spain had no established tradition of using juries in trials, but the [[Constitution of Spain|Constitution of 1978]], legislates the right to a trial by jury, called "popular jury" as opposed to a "magistrates jury".  The provision is arguably somewhat vague: ''"Section 125 - Citizens may engage in popular action and take part in the administration of justice through the institution of the jury, in the manner and with respect to those criminal trials as may be determined by law, as well as in customary and traditional courts."''

One of the first jury trial cases was that of Mikel Otegi who was tried in 1997 for the murder of two police officers. After a confused{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} trial, five jury members of a total of nine voted to acquit and the judge ordered the accused set free. This verdict shocked the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/1997/03/07/espana/07N0018.html ESPAÑA | Juicio a Mikel Otegi por asesinar a dos ertzainas. Un jurado popular adsuelve al joven de Jarrai&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Another alleged miscarriage of justice by jury trial was the [[Wanninkhof case|Wanninkhof murder case]].

===Sweden===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
{{further|Judiciary of Sweden#Juries}}
In press [[libel]] cases and other cases concerning offenses against freedom of the press, the question of whether or not the printed material falls outside permissible limits is submitted to a jury of 9 members which provides a pre-screening before the case is ruled on by normal courts. In these cases 6 out of 9 jurors must find against the defendant, and may not be overruled in cases of acquittal.

Sweden has no tradition of using juries in most types of criminal or civil trial. The sole exception, since 1815, is in cases involving freedom of the press, prosecuted under Chapter 7 of the Freedom of the Press Act, part of Sweden's constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riksdagen.se/templates/R_PageExtended____6337.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222143058/http://www.riksdagen.se/templates/R_PageExtended____6337.aspx |date=December 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most frequently prosecuted offence under this act is defamation, although in total eighteen offences, including high treason and espionage, are covered. These cases are tried in district courts (first tier courts) by a jury of nine laymen.

The jury in press freedom cases rules only on the facts of the case and the question of guilt or innocence. The trial judge may overrule a jury's guilty verdict, but may not overrule an acquittal. A conviction requires a majority verdict of 6-3. Sentencing is the sole prerogative of judges.

Jury members must be Swedish citizens and resident in the county in which the case is being heard. They must be of sound judgement and known for their independence and integrity. Combined, they should represent a range of social groups and opinions, as well as all parts of the county. It is the county council that have the responsibility to appoints juries for a tenure of four years under which they may serve in multiple cases. The appointed jurymen are divided into two groups, in most counties the first with sixteen members and the second with eight. From this pool of available jurymen the court hears and excludes those with conflicts of interest in the case, after which the defendants and plaintiffs have the right to exclude a number of members, varying by county and group. The final jury is then randomly selected by drawing of lots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Tryckfrihetsforordning-19491_sfs-1949-105/ Tryckfrihetsförordning (1949:105-SFS 2010:1409)] ''Riksdagen'' {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/sw03000_.html The Freedom of the Press Act/Sweden] ''The International Constitutional Law Project''&lt;/ref&gt;

Juries are not used in other criminal and civil cases. For most other cases in the first and second tier courts lay judges sit alongside professional judges. Lay judges participate in deciding both the facts of the case and sentencing. Lay judges are appointed by local authorities, or in practice by the political parties represented on the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-internationale-de-droit-penal-2001-1-page-355.htm |title=The advantages and disadvantages of lay judges from a Swedish perspective |publisher=Cairn.info |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lay judges are therefore usually selected from among nominees of ruling political parties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blinamndeman.se/Bli-namndeman/Sa-blir-du-vald/&lt;/ref&gt;

====England and Wales====
{{main|Juries in England and Wales}}
In England and Wales jury trials are used for criminal cases, requiring 12 jurors (between the ages of 18 and 75), although the trial may continue with as few as 9. The right to a jury trial has been enshrined in English law since [[Magna Carta]] in 1215, and is most common in serious cases, although the defendant can insist on a jury trial for most criminal cases. Jury trials in complex fraud cases have been described by some members and appointees of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] as expensive and time-consuming.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd-Bostock S, Thomas C. (1999).  [https://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?62+Law+&amp;+Contemp.+Probs.+7+(Spring+1999) DECLINE OF THE "LITTLE PARLIAMENT": JURIES AND JURY REFORM IN ENGLAND AND WALES].''Law and Contemporary Problems''.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the [[Bar Council]], [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]] and other political parties have supported the idea that trial by jury is at the heart of the judicial system and placed the blame for a few complicated jury trials failing on inadequate preparation by the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Sunday Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article535745.ece |title=Jury trials 'intolerable' in major fraud cases |date=June 21, 2005 |first=Simon |last=Freeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 June 2009 the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], [[Lord Judge]], sitting in the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], made English legal history by ruling that a criminal trial in the [[Crown Court of England and Wales|Crown Court]] could take place without a jury, under the provisions of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8106590.stm |title=First trial without jury approved |publisher=BBC News |date=18 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jury trials are also available for some few areas of civil law (for example defamation cases and those involving police conduct); these also require 12 jurors (9 in the County Court). However less than 1% of civil trials involve juries.&lt;ref&gt;Glendon MA, Carozza PG, Picker CB. (2008) ''Comparative Legal Traditions'', p. 251. Thomson-West.&lt;/ref&gt; At the new [[Manchester Civil Justice Centre]], constructed in 2008, fewer than 10 of the 48 courtrooms had jury facilities.

====Northern Ireland====
During [[the Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], jury trials were suspended and trials took place before [[Diplock Courts]]. These were essentially trials before judges only. This was to combat the intimidation of juries.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

====Scotland====
{{main|Trial by jury in Scotland}}
Scottish trials are based on an adversarial approach.  First the prosecution leads evidence from witnesses and after each witness the defence has an opportunity to cross examine.  Following the Prosecution case, the defence may move a motion of [[no case to answer]] if the worst the prosecution has been able to lead in evidence would be insufficient to convict of any crime.  If there remains a case to answer, the defence leads evidence from witnesses in an attempt to refute previous evidence led by the prosecution, with cross examination being permitted after each witness. Once both prosecution and defence have concluded leading evidence, the case goes to summing up where firstly the prosecution and then the defence get to sum up their case based on the evidence that has been heard.  The jury is given guidance on points of law and then sent out to consider its verdict. Juries are composed of fifteen residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Was I Picked For Jury Service? |publisher=Courtroom Advice|url=http://www.courtroomadvice.co.uk/why-was-I-picked-for-jury-service.html|accessdate=2010-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|Juries in the United States}}
In criminal law in federal courts and a minority of state court systems of the United States, a grand jury is convened to hear only [[testimony]] and [[evidence (law)|evidence]] to determine whether there is a sufficient basis for deciding to indict the defendant and proceed toward trial.  In each court district where a grand jury is required, a group of 16–23 citizens holds an inquiry on criminal complaints brought by the prosecutor to decide whether a trial is warranted (based on the standard that probable cause exists that a crime was committed), in which case an indictment is issued. In jurisdictions where the size of a jury varies, in general the size of juries tends to be larger if the crime alleged is more serious.  If a grand jury rejects a proposed indictment the grand jury's action is known as a "no bill."  If they accept a proposed indictment, the grand jury's action is known as a "true bill."  Grand jury proceedings are ''ex parte'': only the prosecutor and witnesses who the prosecutor calls may present evidence to the grand jury and defendants are not allowed to present mitigating evidence or even to know the testimony that was presented to the grand jury, and hearsay evidence is permitted.  This is so because a grand jury cannot convict a defendant.  It can only decide to indict the defendant and proceed forward toward trial.  Grand juries vote to indict in the overwhelming majority of cases, and prosecutors are not prohibited from presenting the same case to a new grand jury if a "no bill" was returned by a previous grand jury.  A typical grand jury considers a new criminal case every fifteen minutes.  In some jurisdictions, in addition to indicting persons for crimes, a grand jury may also issue reports on matters that they investigate apart from the criminal indictments, particularly when the grand jury investigation involves a public scandal.  Historically, grand juries were sometimes used in American law to serve a purpose similar to an investigatory commission.

Both [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III of the U.S. Constitution]] and the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] require that criminal cases be tried by a jury.&lt;ref name="King1999"&gt;{{cite journal | author = King NJ | title = The American Criminal Jury |  journal = Law and Contemporary Problems | url = https://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?62+Law+&amp;+Contemp.+Probs.+41+(Spring+1999) | year = 1999 | pages = 41–67 | volume = 62 | accessdate = 2009-06-04 | doi = 10.2307/1192252 | issue = 2 | jstor = 1192252}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally this applied only to federal courts.  However, the Fourteenth Amendment extended this mandate to the states.  Although the Constitution originally did not require a jury for civil cases, this led to an uproar which was followed by adoption of the [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]], which requires a civil jury in cases where the value in dispute is greater than twenty dollars.&lt;ref name="Landsman1999"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Landsman S. | year = 1999 | title = The Civil Jury in America |  journal = Law and Contemporary Problems | url = https://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?62+Law+&amp;+Contemp.+Probs.+285+(Spring+1999) | pages = 285–304 | volume = 62 | accessdate = 2009-06-04 | doi = 10.2307/1192260 | issue = 2 | jstor = 1192260}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Seventh Amendment right to a civil jury trial does not apply in [[State court (United States)|state courts]], where the right to a jury is strictly a matter of state law.&lt;ref&gt;Amar, A.R. (1998). ''The Bill of Rights''. New Haven, CT: Yale University. pp. 81–118.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in practice, all states except Louisiana preserve the right to a jury trial in almost all civil cases where the sole remedy sought is money damages to the same extent as jury trials are permitted by the Seventh Amendment.  Under the law of many states, jury trials are not allowed in small claims cases.  The civil jury in the United States is a defining element of the process by which personal injury trials are handled.

In practice, even though the defendant in a criminal action is entitled to a trial by jury, most criminal actions in the U.S. are resolved by [[plea bargain]].&lt;ref name="plea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acslaw.org/node/6789 |title=Plea Bargains and the Role of Judges |work=2008 National Convention Breakout Session |publisher=The American Constitution Society for Law and Policy (ACS) |accessdate=2009-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007220413/http://www.acslaw.org/node/6789 |archivedate=2009-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Only about 2% of civil cases go to trial, with only about half of those trials being conducted before juries.

In 1898 the Supreme Court held that the jury must be composed of at least twelve persons, although this was not necessarily extended to state civil jury trials.&lt;ref name=Landsman1999/&gt; In 1970, however, the Supreme Court held that the twelve person requirement was a "historical accident", and upheld six-person juries if provided for under state law in both criminal and civil state court cases. There is controversy over smaller juries, with proponents arguing that they are more efficient and opponents arguing that they lead to fluctuating verdicts.&lt;ref name=Landsman1999/&gt; In a later case, however, the court rejected the use of five-person juries in criminal cases.&lt;ref name=Landsman1999/&gt; Juries go through a selection process called ''voir dire'' in which the lawyers question the jurors and then make "challenges for cause" and "peremptory challenges" to remove jurors.  Traditionally the removal of jurors based on a peremptory challenge required no justification or explanation, but the tradition has been changed by the Supreme Court where the reason for the peremptory challenge was the race of the potential juror.  Since the 1970s "[[scientific jury selection]]" has become popular.&lt;ref name=Landsman1999/&gt;

Unanimous jury verdicts have been standard in US American law. This requirement was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1897, but the standard was relaxed in 1972 in two criminal cases. As of 1999 over thirty states had laws allowing less than unanimity in civil cases, but Oregon and Louisiana are the only states which have laws allowing less than unanimous jury verdicts for criminal cases.&lt;ref name=Landsman1999/&gt; When the required number of jurors cannot agree on a verdict (a situation sometimes referred to as a ''hung jury''), a [[Mistrials|mistrial]] is declared, and the case may be retried with a newly constituted jury. The practice generally was that the jury rules only on questions of fact and guilt; setting the penalty was reserved for the judge. This practice was confirmed by rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court such as in ''[[Ring v. Arizona]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Ring v. Arizona'', {{ussc|536|284|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; which found Arizona's practice of having the judge decide whether aggravating factors exist to make a defendant eligible for the death penalty, to be unconstitutional, and reserving the determination of whether the aggravating factors exist to be decided by the jury. However, in some states (such as Alabama and Florida), the ultimate decision on the punishment is made by the judge, and the jury gives only a non-binding recommendation. The judge can impose the death penalty even if the jury recommends life without parole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/342 Unanimous Jury Votes for Life Sentence, but Alabama Judge Imposes Death] Death Penalty Information Center&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no set format for jury deliberations, and the jury takes a period of time to settle into discussing the evidence and deciding on guilt and any other facts the judge instructs them to determine.  Deliberation is done by the jury only, with none of the lawyers, the judge, or the defendant present.  The first step will typically be to find out the initial feeling or reaction of the jurors to the case, which may be by a show of hands, or via secret ballot. The jury will then attempt to arrive at a consensus verdict. The discussion usually helps to identify jurors' views to see whether a consensus will emerge as well as areas that bear further discussion.  Points often arise that were not specifically discussed during the trial.  The result of these discussions is that in most cases the jury comes to a unanimous decision and a verdict is thus achieved.  In some states and under circumstances, the decision need not be unanimous.

In a few states and in death penalty cases, depending upon the law, the trial jury, or sometimes a separate jury, may determine whether the death penalty is appropriate in "capital" murder cases.  Usually, sentencing is handled by the judge at a separate hearing.  The judge may but does not always follow the recommendations of the jury when deciding on a sentence.&lt;ref&gt;This power is often used in drug cases "''to impose an enhanced sentence ... based on the sentencing judge's determination of a fact that was not found by the jury or admitted by the defendant''". In April 2008, the U.S. District Court, in a [http://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/pub/rulings/cr/2006/6cr22moj040108.pdf 236 page opinion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518065947/http://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/pub/rulings/cr/2006/6cr22moj040108.pdf |date=2008-05-18 }} to address this ruled that juries should be told before they deliberate if a defendant is facing a mandatory minimum sentence and also called it "inappropriate" to ignore the juries power to refuse to convict (jury nullification).&lt;/ref&gt;

When used alone the term ''jury'' usually refers to a petit jury, rather than a grand jury.

==Jury selection==
{{Main|Jury selection}}

Jurors are selected from a jury pool formed for a specified period of time—usually from one day to two weeks—from lists of citizens living in the jurisdiction of the court. The lists may be electoral rolls (i.e., a list of registered voters in the locale), people who have driver's licenses or other relevant data bases.  When selected, being a member of a jury pool is, in principle, compulsory. Prospective jurors are sent a  [[summons]] and are obligated to appear in a specified jury pool room on a specified date.

However, jurors can be released from the pool for several reasons including illness, prior commitments that can't be abandoned without hardship, change of address to outside the court's jurisdiction, travel or employment outside the jurisdiction at the time of duty, and others. Often jurisdictions pay token amounts for jury duty and many issue stipends to cover transportation expenses for jurors.  Work places cannot penalize employees who serve jury duty. Payments to jurors varies by jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsconline.org/WC/CourTopics/StateLinks.asp?id=47&amp;topic=JurMan ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427204517/http://www.ncsconline.org/WC/CourTopics/StateLinks.asp?id=47&amp;topic=JurMan |date=April 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States jurors for [[grand juries]] are selected from jury pools.

Selection of jurors from a jury pool occurs when a trial is announced and juror names are randomly selected and called out by the jury pool clerk.  Depending on the type of trial—whether a 6-person or 12 person jury is needed, in the United States—anywhere from 15 to 30 prospective jurors are sent to the courtroom to participate in voir dire, pronounced {{IPA-fr|vwaʁ diʁ|}} in French, and defined as the oath to speak the truth in the examination testing competence of a juror, or in another application, a witness. Once the list of prospective jurors has assembled in the courtroom the court clerk assigns them seats in the order their names were originally drawn.  At this point the judge often will ask each prospective juror to answer a list of general questions such as name, occupation, education, family relationships, time conflicts for the anticipated length of the trial.  The list is usually written up and clearly visible to assist nervous prospective jurors and may include several questions uniquely pertinent to the particular trial.  These questions are to familiarize the judge and attorneys with the jurors and glean biases, experiences, or relationships that could jeopardize the proper course of the trial.

After each prospective juror has answered the general slate of questions the attorneys may ask follow-up questions of some or all prospective jurors.  Each side in the trial is allotted a certain number of challenges to remove prospective jurors from consideration. Some challenges are issued during voir dire while others are presented to the judge at the end of voir dire.  The judge calls out the names of the anonymously challenged prospective jurors and those return to the pool for consideration in other trials.  A jury is formed, then, of the remaining prospective jurors in the order that their names were originally chosen.  Any prospective jurors not thus impaneled return to the jury pool room.

==Jury behavior==

Scholarly research on jury behavior in American non-capital criminal felony trials reveals that juror outcomes appear to track the opinions of the median juror, rather than the opinions of the extreme juror on the panel, although juries were required to render unanimous verdicts in the jurisdictions studied.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick J. Bayer, Randi Hjalmarsson, Shamena Anwar, "Jury Discrimination in Criminal Trials" (September 2010) Economic Research Initiatives at Duke (ERID) Working Papers Series No. 55 http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1673994&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, although juries must render unanimous verdicts, in run-of-the-mill criminal trials they behave in practice as if they were operating using a majority rules voting system.

==Jury effectiveness==

As much of the research on social [[conformity]] suggests, individuals tend to lose their sense of individuality when faced with powerful group forces (i.e., [[Normative social influence|normative influence]]; [[Social proof|informational influence]]; interpersonal influence).&lt;ref name=Forsyth&gt;Forsyth, D.R. 2010. Group Dynamics, 5th Edition. Belmont, CA: Thomson Wadsworth. {{ISBN|0-534-36822-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This seemingly stark realization raises the question: Is the effectiveness of jury decision-making compromised by individuals’ tendencies to conform to the normative transmissions of a group?

Since a clear [[archetype]] for determining guilt does not exist, the criminal justice system must rely on rulings handed down by juries. Even after a decision has been made, it is virtually impossible to know whether a jury has been correct or incorrect in freeing or accusing a defendant of a crime. Although establishing the effectiveness of juries is an arduous task, contemporary research has provided partial support for the proficiency of juries as decision makers.&lt;ref name="Forsyth" /&gt;

===The role of a juror===

Evidence has shown that jurors typically take their roles very seriously.&lt;ref name=Simon&gt;Simon, R. J. (1980). The jury: Its role in American society. Lexington, MA: Heath&lt;/ref&gt; According to Simon (1980), jurors approach their responsibilities as decision makers much in the same way as a court judge – with great seriousness, a lawful mind, and a concern for consistency that is evidence-based. By actively processing evidence, making inferences, using common sense and personal experiences to inform their decision-making, research has indicated that jurors are effective decision makers that seek thorough understanding, rather than passive, apathetic participants unfit to serve on a jury.&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/publicat/judicature/article10.html |title=Human Genome Project Information Site Has Been Updated |publisher=Ornl.gov |date=2013-07-23 |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judge-jury agreement===

Evidence supporting jury effectiveness has also been illustrated in studies that investigate the parallels between judge and jury decision-making.&lt;ref name=Kalven&gt;Kalven, H. &amp; Zeisel, H. (1966). The American Jury. Boston: Little, Brown.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Kalven and Zeisel (1966), it is not uncommon to find that the verdicts passed down by juries following a trial match the verdicts held by the appointed judges. Upon surveying judges and jurors of approximately 8000 criminal and civil trials, it was discovered that the verdicts handed down by both parties were in agreement 80% of the time.&lt;ref name="Kalven" /&gt;

===Buffering effects===

Jurors, like most individuals, are not free from holding social and cognitive [[List of cognitive biases|biases]]. People may negatively judge individuals who do not adhere to established [[Norm (social)|social norms]] (e.g., an individual's dress sense) or do not meet societal standards of success. Although these biases tend to influence jurors’ individual decisions during a trial,&lt;ref name=Wrightsman&gt;Wrightsman, L., Nietzel, M. T., &amp; Fortune, W. H. (1998). Psychology and the legal system (4th edition). Monterey, California: Brooks/Cole.&lt;/ref&gt; while working as part of a group (i.e., jury), these biases are typically controlled.&lt;ref name=Kerr&gt;Kerr, N. L., &amp; Huang, J. Y. (1986). How much difference does one juror make in jury deliberation. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 12, 325-343.&lt;/ref&gt; Groups tend to exert buffering effects that allow jurors to disregard their initial personal biases when forming a credible group decision.

The '''Kellogg–Briand Pact''' (or '''Pact of Paris''', officially '''General Treaty for Renunciation of War as an Instrument of National Policy'''&lt;ref&gt;See certified true copy of the text of the treaty in [http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/LON/Volume%2094/v94.pdf League of Nations, ''Treaty Series'', vol. 94], p. 57 (No. 2137)&lt;/ref&gt;) is a 1928 [[international agreement]] in which signatory states promised not to use [[war]] to resolve "disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise among them".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/kbpact.asp |title=Kellogg–Briand Pact 1928 |publisher=[[Yale University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parties failing to abide by this promise "should be denied of the benefits furnished by [the] treaty". It was signed by [[Germany]], [[France]], and the [[United States]] on 27 August 1928, and by most other states soon after. Sponsored by France and the U.S., the Pact renounces the use of war and calls for the peaceful settlement of disputes. Eleven years after the Paris signing, World War II had begun. Similar provisions were incorporated into the [[Charter of the United Nations]] and other treaties and it became a stepping-stone to a more activist American policy.&lt;ref name="Josephson1979"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Josephson |first1=Harold |title=Outlawing War: Internationalism and the Pact of Paris |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7709.1979.tb00323.x |journal=Diplomatic History |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=377–390 |year=1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is named after its authors, [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Frank B.

Moreover, it erased the legal distinction between war and peace because the signatories began to wage wars without declaring them.&lt;ref name="Quigley1966"/&gt; 

The pact's central provisions renouncing the use of war, and promoting peaceful settlement of disputes and the use of collective force to prevent aggression, were incorporated into the [[United Nations Charter]] and other treaties. Although civil wars continued, wars between established states have been rare since 1945, with a few exceptions in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Josephson1979"/&gt; One legal consequence is that it is unlawful to annex territory by force, although other forms of annexation have not been prevented. More broadly, some authors claim there is now a strong presumption against the legality of using, or threatening, military force against another country.&lt;ref name=Christiansen2016/&gt; The pact also served as the legal basis for the concept of a [[crime against peace]], for which the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg Tribunal]] and [[Tokyo Trials|Tokyo Tribunal]] tried and [[execution|executed]] the top leaders responsible for starting World War II.&lt;ref name="Askin1997"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kelly Dawn Askin |title=War Crimes Against Women: Prosecution in International War Crimes Tribunals |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ThfzGvSvQ2UC&amp;pg=PA46 |year=1997 |page=46 |isbn=978-9041104861 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many historians and political scientists see the pact as mostly irrelevant and ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/09/29/theres-still-no-reason-to-think-the-kellogg-briand-pact-accomplished-anything/|title=There's Still No Reason to Think the Kellogg-Briand Pact Accomplished Anything|website=Foreign Policy|access-date=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After negotiations, the pact was signed in [[Paris]] at the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)|French Foreign Ministry]] by the representatives from [[Australia]], [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Czechoslovak Republic (1918–1938)|Czechoslovakia]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[British Raj|British India]], the [[Irish Free State]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], the [[United Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/31317/response/93990/attach/html/3/MOP%205312%2010%20BOvens%20Kellogg%20Briand.doc.html | title = Kellogg–Briand | publisher = What do they know}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States. It was provided that it would come into effect on 24 July 1929.

By that date, the following nations had deposited instruments of definitive adherence to the pact: [[Kingdom of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[Albanian Republic|Albania]], [[Austria]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Republic of China|China]], [[Cuba]], [[Denmark]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Estonia]], [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]], [[Finland]], [[Guatemala]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Iceland|Iceland]], [[Latvia]], [[Liberia]], [[Lithuania]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Norway]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]], [[Ditadura Nacional|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]], [[Thailand|Siam]], [[Spain under the Restoration|Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Turkey]].

==Effect and legacy==

[[File:Mi-Carême 1929 Briand Kellogg.jpg|thumb|Mockery of the Pact during the [[Paris Carnival|Paris Carnaval]] in 1929]]
The 1928 Kellogg–Briand Pact was concluded outside the [[League of Nations]], and remains in effect.&lt;ref name="UKHOC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/text/131216w0004.htm#131216w0004.htm_wqn20|title=House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 16 Dec 2013  (pt 0004)|first=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons,|last=Westminster|date=|website=publications.parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; One month following its conclusion, a similar agreement, [[General Act for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes]], was concluded in Geneva, which obliged its signatory parties to establish [[conciliation|conciliation commissions]] in any case of dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Text in [http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/LON/Volume%2093/v93.pdf ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 93], pp. 344–363.&lt;/ref&gt; The pact's central provisions renouncing the use of war, and promoting peaceful settlement of disputes and the use of collective force to prevent aggression, were incorporated into the [[United Nations Charter]] and other treaties. Although civil wars continued, wars between established states have been rare since 1945, with a few exceptions in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=Josephson1979/&gt;

As a practical matter, the Kellogg–Briand Pact did not live up to all of its aims, but has arguably had some considerable success. It did not end war or stop the rise of [[militarism]], and was unable to keep the international peace in succeeding years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1921-1936/kellogg|title=Milestones: 1921–1936 - Office of the Historian|author=|date=|website=history.state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, it erased the legal distinction between war and peace because the signatories, having renounced the use of war, began to wage wars without declaring them as in the [[Mukden incident|Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] in 1931, the [[second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italian invasion of Abyssinia]] in 1935, the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936, the [[Soviet invasion of Finland]] in 1939, and the [[Invasion of Poland|German and Soviet invasions of Poland]].&lt;ref name="Quigley1966"&gt;{{cite book|last=Quigley|first=Carroll|title=Tragedy And Hope|year=1966|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|pages=294–295|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KQZxAAAAIAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the pact is associated with a marked decline in territorial conquest of one nation by another in the periods before and after its signing: the period from 1816 to 1928 saw on average one conquest every 10 months and 114,088 square miles of territory taken per year, while the period since World War Two has seen one conquest every four years and 5,772 square miles of territory taken per year. After WWII, territories that had been conquered between 1928 and WWII, with some exceptions, were mostly returned to the countries that had originally held them.&lt;ref name=Hathaway2017&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/02/opinion/sunday/outlawing-war-kellogg-briand.html|title=Outlawing War? It Actually Worked|last=Hathaway|first=Oona A.|date=2 September 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=4 September 2017|last2=Shapiro|first2=Scott J.|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While the Pact has been ridiculed for its moralism and legalism and lack of influence on foreign policy, it instead led to a more activist American foreign policy.&lt;ref name="Josephson1979"/&gt; According to [[Yale]] law professors [[Scott J. Shapiro]] and [[Oona A. Hathaway]], one reason for the historical insignificance of the pact was the absence of an enforcement mechanism to compel compliance from signatories. They also said that the Pact appealed to the West because it promised to secure and protect previous conquests, thus securing their place at the head of the international legal order indefinitely.&lt;ref name="Menand2017"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Menand |first=Louis |date=18 September 2017 |title=Drop Your Weapons |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |quote=Hathaway and Shaprio acknowledge that one reason the Kellogg–Briand Pact is regarded as historically insignificant is that it provided no enforcement mechanism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pact, in addition to binding the particular nations that signed it, has also served as one of the legal bases establishing the international norms that the threat&lt;ref&gt;Article 2, [http://www.roberthjackson.org/Man/theman2-7-6-2/ Budapest Articles of Interpretation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225020156/http://www.roberthjackson.org/Man/theman2-7-6-2/ |date=25 February 2007 }} (see under footnotes), 1934&lt;/ref&gt; or use of military force in contravention of international law, as well as the territorial acquisitions resulting from it,&lt;ref&gt;Article 5, [http://www.roberthjackson.org/Man/theman2-7-6-2/ Budapest Articles of Interpretation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225020156/http://www.roberthjackson.org/Man/theman2-7-6-2/ |date=25 February 2007 }} (see under footnotes), 1934&lt;/ref&gt; are unlawful.

Notably, the pact served as the legal basis for the concept of a [[crime against peace]].

One legal consequence is that it is unlawful to annex territory by force, although other forms of annexation have not been prevented. More broadly, there is now a strong presumption against the legality of using, or threatening, military force against another country.

While licensed production provides stimulus to the production and technical capabilities of local industry, in many cases it remains at least partly dependent on foreign support.&lt;ref name=Bitzinger/&gt;

During the 1920s, European economists began advocating licensed production of foreign goods as the cure for "industrial particularism"&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt;&amp;mdash;it allowed countries to bypass the costly [[research and development]] stage of acquiring products with which their own industries were unfamiliar, and refocus on the domestic manufacture of preexisting overseas designs.&lt;ref name="UKArms"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Croft|first1=Stuart|last2=Dorman|first2=Andrew|last3=Rees|first3=Wyn|last4=Uttley|first4=Matthew|title=Britain and Defence 1945-2000: A Policy Re-evaluation|date=2001|pages=118-120|publisher=Routledge Books|location=Abingdon-on-Thames|isbn=978-0582303775}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed for a much higher rate of production,&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt; and was considerably cheaper than national sourcing and off-the-shelf acquisition.&lt;ref name="UKArms"/&gt; European automobile manufacturers were the first to adopt this practice, producing a number of specialized American components for their passenger cars under license.&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt; The United States not only supplied European factories with the necessary blueprints and licenses, but also sourced American-made tooling equipment accordingly, which allowed the automobile companies to optimize their production lines.&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt; By the 1960s it was not uncommon for an entire specialized industry&amp;mdash;such as the manufacture of helicopters in the [[United Kingdom]]&amp;mdash;to be dependent wholly on licensed components.&lt;ref name="UKArms"/&gt; 

A number of countries began improving products manufactured under license, and were even able to re-export them successfully.&lt;ref name="Landgren"&gt;{{cite book | first = Signe | last = Landgren| authorlink = | title = Embargo Disimplemented: South Africa's Military Industry|edition= 1989|pages= 83–88 | publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn= 978-0-19-829127-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend resulted in some technology suppliers imposing additional conditions on the licensee.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; The United States began inserting ''pro forma'' statements into licensing agreements known as ''"side letters"'', which required the free sharing of any improvements made to American technology.&lt;ref name=Lorell&gt;{{cite book|last=Lorell|first=Mark|title=Troubled Partnership: A History of U.S.-Japan Collaboration on the Fs-X Fighter|date=2009|pages=27-28|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick|isbn=1-56000-891-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other attempts were also made to control the destination of licensed products, particularly with regards to the [[arms industry]].&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt;  For instance, [[France]] stipulated that [[Eland Mk7|Eland]] armoured vehicles manufactured in [[South Africa]] under a French license were not to be exported to other foreign powers without its express approval.&lt;ref name="Portugal-ZA"&gt;{{cite paper

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another form of common licensing restriction related solely to the licensing activity, regulating whether the specified product was fully produced or partly assembled, and whether entire products or their individual components were manufactured.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt;

In some cases, the original technology supplier did not need to manufacture the product itself&amp;mdash;it merely patented a specific design, then sold the actual production rights to multiple overseas clients.&lt;ref name="Landgren"/&gt; This resulted in some countries producing separate but nearly identical products under different licenses.&lt;ref name="Landgren"/&gt; 

[[Developing nations]] began accounting for a significant percentage of licensed production during the late twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; Governments of developing nations often sought to encourage rapid industrialization, reduce dependence on foreign imports, and combat high levels of unemployment by creating and retaining local jobs.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; However, indigenous companies were often too small and their research capacity too limited to meet these goals alone, compelling them to adopt licensing agreements.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; Manufacturing non-national products under license generated employment and empowered the industry while reducing dependence on imports.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; It also avoided the risks inherent in the development of new products without adequate research infrastructure by taking advantage of consumer goods already proven in foreign markets.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; Several developing nations such as [[Pakistan]] and [[Singapore]] which built important segments of their industry on licensed production have now become licensors themselves to less developed states.&lt;ref name=Bourne&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourne|first=Mike|title=Arming Conflict: The Proliferation of Small Arms|date=2007|pages=66-67|publisher=Palgrave-Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-0230019331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical basis==
[[File:MHV Polski-Fiat 508 1933 01.JPG|thumb|left|220px|1933 [[Fiat 508]] manufactured under license in [[Poland]] by [[Polski Fiat]].]]
Licensed production is defined as an overseas production arrangement, usually as a direct result of inter-state trade agreements, that permits a foreign government or entity to acquire the technical information to manufacture all or part of an equipment or component patented in the exporting country.&lt;ref name=Seyoum/&gt; According to the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), it must constitute a partnership between an [[intellectual property]] owner and a licensee who is authorized to use such rights under certain conditions.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; The licensee is manufacturing a product for which it has been granted production rights under specific conditions, while the licensor retains ownership of the intellectual property thereof.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; In some cases the licensor will supply the necessary technical data, prototypes, and/or machine tools to the licensee.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt;

While licensed production is often dependent on the appropriate [[technology transfers]], it does not necessarily entail ownership and management of the overseas production by the technology supplier.&lt;ref name=Seyoum/&gt; However, the licensor does retain the right to continue to use the licensed property, and to attribute further licenses to third parties.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; Occasionally, licensees may themselves sub-license a third party with or without the agreement of the intellectual property owner.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt;  

Licensing agreements determine the form and scope of compensation to the intellectual property owner, which usually takes the form of a flat ''licensing fee'' or a running [[royalty payment]] derived from a share of the licensee's revenue.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; The licenses can be terminated by the licensor, or may expire after a set date; however, the technology and knowledge, once transferred, cannot be rescinded, so even if the licensing agreement expires they remain in the licensee's possession.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt;

Two related commercial practices are foreign subcontractor production and the proliferation of [[knock-down kits]]. Foreign subcontracting occurs when a product's original manufacturer contracts the production of its individual parts and components to a second party overseas.&lt;ref name=Seyoum/&gt; Such arrangements are not considered examples of licensed production because they do not involve the explicit licensing of technological information.&lt;ref name=Seyoum/&gt; Knock-down kits are regarded as a prerequisite to licensed production; they consist of products assembled locally from imported, pre-manufactured parts.&lt;ref name=Bitzinger2&gt;{{cite book|last=Bitzinger|first=Richard|title=Towards a Brave New Arms Industry?|date=2003|pages=17-21|publisher=Routledge Books|location=Abingdon-on-Thames|isbn=978-0198528357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality control and unlicensed production==
{{see also|Counterfeit consumer goods}}
Some licensors find it difficult to regulate the quality of their products manufactured under license.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; It is not always made clear to consumers where exactly a particular good originated, and a poor quality licensed product may damage the reputation of the original licensor.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; However, this is not considered a form of consumer fraud unless the product is unlicensed or [[counterfeit]].&lt;ref name="Ersatz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Counterfeit products|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|url=https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/tocta/8.Counterfeit_products.pdf|location=New York
|publisher=[[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]]|date=2010|accessdate=20 December 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223230500/https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/tocta/8.Counterfeit_products.pdf|archivedate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlicensed production is the utilization of foreign manufacturing technology without a license, achieved through [[industrial espionage]] or [[reverse engineering]].&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; Products in high demand on the international market can be reproduced, based on the same or similar design, and branded in ways to make them indistinguishable from the original.&lt;ref name="Ersatz"/&gt; When copied and reproduced without a license, certain items are sometimes recopied in a similar manner by a third party.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; The manufacturers responsible may also grant legitimately registered sub-licenses for their unlicensed products, profiting at the expense of the real intellectual property owner.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; The quality of unlicensed goods varies greatly; the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] has noted that while licensing companies often provide quality control measures, and there is some incentive for licensees to comply or risk legal action and the ensuing damage to their own profit, manufacturers who engage in unlicensed production are under no such obligations.&lt;ref name="Ersatz"/&gt;

Another method of circumventing the need for a license involves a manufacturer making slight modifications in the design or function of an existing product, before reproducing it.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; The manufacturer could then argue that the resulting product is not an unlicensed copy, but a new product not subject to license.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt;

'''''Linda R. S. v. Richard D.''''', 410 U.S. 614 (1973),&lt;ref name="findlaw.com"&gt;{{ussc|name=Linda R. S. v. Richard D.|volume=410|page=614|year=1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case resulting in a ruling that a particular section of a Texas Penal Code did not apply to mothers with out of wedlock children. The case was argued on December 6, 1972 and decided on March 5, 1973. Linda R. S., the [[petitioner]] and [[appellant]], was the mother of the out of wedlock child. Richard D., the [[respondent]] and [[appellee]], was the father of the out of wedlock child.

== Facts ==

Linda R. S., the mother of an out of wedlock child, brought an action to enjoin the "discriminatory application" of Art. 602 of the Texas Penal Code providing that any "parent" who fails to support his "children" is subject to prosecution, but which by state judicial construction applies only to married parents. Linda R. S. sought to enjoin the local district attorney from refraining to prosecute the father of her child for not providing child support. The three-judge District Court dismissed the action for [[Standing (law)|lack of standing]].

==Opinion of the Court==

The Supreme Court affirmed the District Court's holding in a 5-4 decision.  Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] wrote the majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice [[Warren E. Burger]] and Justices [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.]], [[Potter Stewart]], and [[William Rehnquist]]. The Court held that "although appellant has an interest in her child's support, application of Art. 602 would not result in support but only in the father's incarceration, and a private citizen lacks a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of another."&lt;ref name="findlaw.com"/&gt; In December 1981, under ''Leeke v. Timmerman'', the Supreme Court affirmed the precedent in ''Linda R. S. v. Richard D.'', removing the right to [[private prosecution]] in federal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isthatlegal.org/private-prosecution|title=Question: Is it possible for a private citizen to bring a criminal case against a person or other entity?|work=isthatlegal.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Justice White's Dissent ==

Justice White, with Justice Douglas joining, wrote that "children born out of wedlock ... have been excluded intentionally from the class of persons protected by a particular criminal law. They do not get the protection of the laws that other women and children get. Under Art. 602, they are rendered nonpersons; a father may ignore them with full knowledge that he will be subjected to no penal sanctions."&lt;ref name="findlaw.com"/&gt;

== Justice Blackmun's Dissent ==
Justice Blackmun, with Justice Brennan joining, saw "no reason to decide that question in the absence of a live, ongoing controversy because of ''[[Gomez v. Perez]]'', 409 U.S. 535 (1973)."&lt;ref name="findlaw.com"/&gt;

{{Politics of Mexico}}
Since declaring independence in 1821, [[Mexico]] has adopted a number of constitutions or other documents of basic law with constitutional effects. Not all these can be considered constitutions, and not all of them enjoyed universal application. Those  enacted in  1824, 1857, and 1917 are generally considered full-fledged, operational constitutions.  The Constitution of 1824 established the framework of a federated republic, following the [[First Mexican Empire|short-lived monarchy]] of [[Agustín de Iturbide]] (in 1821–22). The Constitution of 1857 was the framework set by Mexican liberals that incorporated particular laws into the constitution. The Constitution of 1917 was drafted by the faction that won the [[Mexican Revolution]], known as the [[Constitutionalists]] for their adherence to the Constitution of 1857. It strengthened the [[Persecution of Christians in Mexico|anticlerical framework]] of the 1857 constitution, empowered the state to expropriate private property, and set protections for organized labor. The 1917 Constitution was significantly revised in 1992 under [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]], [[Persecution of Christians in Mexico#Removal of many anticlerical provisions from the constitution|eliminating anticlerical restrictions]] and strengthening [[Property rights (economics)|private property rights]] against the State.

The '''Office for Judicial Complaints''' (OJC) was an office within the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] which, between 2004 and 2013, managed the handling of complaints against the [[judiciary of England and Wales]]. On 1 October 2013 it was replaced by the [[Judicial Conduct Investigations Office]].

The OJC also assisted in the handling of complaints against the [[judiciary of Scotland]] between 2004 and 2011, when the [[Judicial Complaints Reviewer]] was introduced.

== Origin ==
The OJC was created in 2004 as part of the [[Labour Government 1997-2007|Labour government's]] programme of [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitutional]] reform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.judicialcomplaints.gov.uk/docs/Memorandum_of_Understanding.pdf Memorandum of Understanding between the OJC, the MoJ and the DJO]&lt;/ref&gt; It existed to support the [[Lord Chancellor]] and [[Lord Chief Justice]] (and the [[Lord President of the Court of Session]] in respect of Scotland) consider and decide upon complaints against members of the judiciary. The current judicial discipline arrangements, under which the Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice/Lord President handle complaints and disciplinary action, were established by Part 4 the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/2005/4/part/4|title=Part 4 of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005|noprefix=yes}}. See also the [http://www.judicialcomplaints.gov.uk/docs/Judicial_discipline_regs_-_consolidated_version.pdf Judicial Discipline (Prescribed Procedures) Regulations 2006 (consolidated version)].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation of complaints ==
Complaints about the conduct of judges or magistrates are not investigated by the [[civil servant]]s who make up the Office for Judicial Complaints. Once the OJC has determined that the complaint needs investigation, a preliminary investigation is conducted by a 'nominated judge' who reports to the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice. If a further, more detailed, investigation is required, this is carried out by an 'investigating judge'. Any disciplinary action required is taken by the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice.&lt;ref&gt;See the Judicial Discipline (Prescribed Procedures) Regulations 2006 (above)&lt;/ref&gt;

== High-profile cases ==

=== Cherie Booth QC ===
On 23 January 2010 [[Cherie Booth]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], wife of [[Tony Blair]] (who until recently had been [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]), was sitting as a [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]] in a case where a man was found guilty  violent [[assault]] in which he broke another man's jaw in a queue in a bank. Mrs Booth  prevented the man from going to prison. "Mrs Blair said he was a 'religious person' who had not been in trouble before."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/secular-society-upset-by-judge-cherie-decision-1889792.html 'Secular Society upset by Judge Cherie decision'], ''The Independent'', 4 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A number of complaints were made to the Office for Judicial Complaints&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101015125209/http://www.judicialcomplaints.gov.uk/docs/Recorder_Cherie_Booth_QC_-_OJC_Investigation_Statement_-_0210.pdf OJC Investigation Statement - Cherie Booth QC], Office for Judicial Complaints, 4 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out that under [[English law]] everyone is equal under the law and individual religious beliefs cannot be reasons for the guilty to be given privileged treatment. On 10 June 2010 the OJC issued a statement saying that the investigation had found that "Recorder Booth’s observations did not constitute judicial misconduct".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101015125110/http://www.judicialcomplaints.gov.uk/docs/Recorder_Cherie_Booth_QC_-_OJC_Investigation_Statement_-_1010.pdf Investigation Statement - Cherie Booth QC], Office for Judicial Complaints, 10 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== His Honour Judge Trigger ===
On 18 May 2010, the OJC issued a statement reporting that, following investigation, the Lord Chief Justice had given His Honour Judge Trigger 'formal advice'&lt;ref name="Trigger"&gt;[http://www.judicialcomplaints.gov.uk/docs/HH_Judge_Trigger_-_OJC_Investigation_Statement_-_0910.pdf OJC Investigation Statement - HH Judge Trigger], Office for Judicial Complaints, 18 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; following comments he made whilst passing sentence in a case in July 2009. He had said to the defendant that "your case illustrates all too clearly the completely lax immigration policy that exists and has existed over recent years in this country. People like you, and there are literally hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people like you, come to these shores from foreign countries to avail themselves of the generous welfare benefits that exist here."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8689326.stm Judge told off for migrant remarks], BBC News, 18 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The comments were found to be an "inappropriate judicial intervention in the political process".&lt;ref name="Trigger"/&gt;

=== Mr Justice Peter Smith ===
[[High Court judge (England and Wales)|Mr Justice]] [[Peter Smith (judge)|Peter Smith]] was given a formal reprimand by the Lord Chief Justice&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.judicialcomplaints.gov.uk/docs/Mr_Justice_Peter_Smith_-_OJC_Investigation_Statement_0108.pdf OJC Investigation Statement - Mr Justice Peter Smith], Office for Judicial Complaints, April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; following behaviour which the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] strongly criticised as "extraordinary", "intemperate" and "regrettable".&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2007/720.html Howell &amp; Ors v Lees Millais &amp; Ors] (2007) EWCA Civ 720 (4 July 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The judge, who had failed to gain a position with the law firm [[Addleshaw Goddard]], refused to stand down from hearing a case in which a partner in the firm was a party. The Court of Appeal had concluded that "the approach adopted by the judge ... provides strong support for [counsel]'s submissions that the fair-minded and informed observer, having considered the facts, would conclude that there was a real possibility that the judge was biased against Addleshaw Goddard and its partners, one of whom is the first claimant".&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

'''Pan-Slavism''', a movement which crystallized in the mid-19th century, is the [[political ideology]] concerned with the advancement of integrity and unity for the [[Slavic people|Slavic-speaking people]]s. Its main impact occurred in the [[Balkans]], where non-Slavic empires had ruled the [[South Slav]]s for centuries. These were mainly the [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (both as separate entities for most of the period), the [[Ottoman Empire]], and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]].

== Origins ==
Extensive pan-Slavism began much like [[Pan-Germanism]], both of which grew from the sense of unity and [[nationalism]] experienced within [[ethnic group]]s after the [[French Revolution]] and the consequent [[Napoleonic Wars]] against European monarchies. Like other [[Romantic nationalism|Romantic nationalist]] movements, Slavic intellectuals and scholars in the developing fields of [[history]], [[philology]], and [[folklore]] actively encouraged the passion of their shared identity and ancestry. Pan-Slavism also co-existed with the [[South Slavs|Southern Slavic]] independence.

Commonly used symbols of the Pan-Slavic movement were the [[Pan-Slavic colours]] (blue, white and red) and the Pan-Slavic anthem, ''[[Hey, Slavs]]''.

The first pan-Slavists were the 16th-century Croatian writer [[Vinko Pribojević]] and the 17th-century [[Aleksandar Komulović]], [[Bartol Kašić]], [[Ivan Gundulić]] and [[Croats|Croatian]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] missionary [[Juraj Križanić]].&lt;ref&gt;John M. Letiche and Basil Dmytryshyn: "Russian Statecraft: The Politika of Iurii Krizhanich", Oxford and New York, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivo Banac]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KfqbujXqQBkC&amp;pg=PA71 "The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics"], Cornell University Press, 1988, pp. 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Eighteenth Century: A Current Bibliography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GBtVAAAAYAAJ|year=1992|publisher=American Society for Eighteenth Century Studies|page=162|quote=... the work of some early "Panslavic" ideologues in the sixteenth (Pribojevic) and seventeenth (Gundulic, Komulovic, Kasic,...)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest manifestations of Pan-Slavic thought within the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] have been attributed to [[Adam František Kollár|Adam Franz Kollár]] and [[Pavel Jozef Šafárik]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert John Weston Evans, Chapter "Nationality in East-Central Europe: Perception and Definition before 1848." ''Austria, Hungary, and the Habsburgs: Essays on Central Europe, c.1683-1867.'' 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement began following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. In the aftermath, the leaders of Europe sought to restore the pre-war [[status quo]]. At the [[Congress of Vienna]], Austria's representative, [[Metternich|Prince von Metternich]], felt the threat to this status quo in Austria was the nationalists demanding independence from the empire. While their subjects were composed of numerous ethnic groups (such as [[Italians]], [[Romanians]], [[Hungarians]], etc.), most of the subjects were Slavs.

== First Pan-Slav Congress, Prague, 1848 ==
The [[Prague Slavic Congress, 1848|First Pan-Slav congress]] was held in [[Prague]], [[Bohemia]] in June, 1848, during the [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary movement of 1848]]. The Czechs had refused to send representatives to the [[Frankfurt Assembly]] feeling that Slavs had a distinct interest from the Germans. The [[Austroslavism|Austroslav]], [[František Palacký]], presided over the event. Most of the delegates were Czech and Slovak. Palacký called for the co-operation of the [[Habsburg]]s and had also endorsed the Habsburg monarchy as the political formation most likely to protect the peoples of [[central Europe]]. When the Germans asked him to declare himself in favour of their desire for national unity, he replied that he would not as this would weaken the Habsburg state: “Truly, if it were not that [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] had long existed, it would be necessary, in the interest of [[Europe]], in the interest of [[All humanity|humanity]] itself, to create it.”

The Pan-Slav congress met during the revolutionary turmoil of 1848. Young inhabitants of Prague had taken to the streets and in the confrontation, a stray bullet had killed the wife of [[Field Marshal]] [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz]], the commander of the Austrian forces in Prague. Enraged, Windischgrätz seized the city, disbanded the congress, and established [[martial law]] throughout Bohemia.

The first Pan-Slavic convention was held in Prague on June 2 through 16, 1848.&lt;ref&gt;See Note 134 on page 725 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 14'' (International Publishers: New York, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;  The delegates at the Congress were specifically both [[Austria-hungary#Ethnic relations|anti-Austrian]] and [[Russification#Poland and Lithuania|anti-Russian]]. Still "the Right"—the moderately liberal wing of the Congress—under the leadership of [[František Palacký]] (1798–1876), a Czech historian and politician,&lt;ref&gt;See the biographical note on page 784 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 14''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pavol Jozef Šafárik]] (1795–1861), a Slovak philologist, historian and archaeologist,&lt;ref&gt;See the biographical note at page 787 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 14''&lt;/ref&gt; favored autonomy of the Slav lands within the framework of Austrian (Habsburg) monarchy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;See Note 134 on page 725 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 14''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast "the Left"—the radical wing of the Congress—under the leadership of [[Karel Sabina]] (1813–1877), a Czech writer and journalist, [[Josef Václav Frič]], a Czech nationalist, [[Karol Libelt]] (1817–1861), a Polish writer and politician, and others, pressed for a close alliance with the revolutionary-democratic movement going on in Germany and Hungary in 1848.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A national rebirth in the Hungarian "Upper Land" (now [[Slovakia]]) awoken in a completely new light, both before the Slovak Uprising in 1848 and after. The driving force of this rebirth movement were Slovak writers and politicians who called themselves Štúrovci, the followers of [[Ľudovít Štúr]]. As the Slovak nobility was [[Magyarization|Magyarized]] and most of Slovaks were merely farmers or priests, this movement failed to attract much attention. Nonetheless, the campaign was successful as a brotherly cooperation between the Croats and the Slovaks brought its fruit throughout the war. Most of the battles between Slovaks and Hungarians however, did not turn out in favor for the Slovaks who were logistically supported by the Austrians, but not sufficiently. The shortage of manpower proved to be decisive as well.

During the war, the [[Slovak National Council]] brought its demands to the young Austrian emperor, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]], who seemed to take a note of it and promised support for the Slovaks against the revolutionary radical Hungarians. However the moment the revolution was over, Slovak demands were forgotten. These demands included an autonomous land within the Austrian Empire called "Slovenský kraj" which would be eventually led by a Serbian prince. This act of ignorance from the Emperor convinced the Slovak and the Czech elite who proclaimed the concept of Austroslavism as dead. 

Disgusted by the Emperor's policy, in the year of 1849, Ľudovít Štúr, the person who codified the first official [[Slovak language]], wrote a book he would name ''Slavdom and the World of the Future''. This book served him as a manifesto where he noted that Austroslavism was not the way to go anymore. He also wrote a sentence that often serves as a quote until this day: "Every nation has its time under God's sun, and the [[tilia|linden]] [a symbol of the Slavs] is blossoming, while the [[Oak#National_symbol|oak]] [a symbol of the Teutons] bloomed long ago."&lt;ref&gt;({{lang-sk|Každý národ má svoj čas pod Božím slnkom, a lipa kvitne až dub už dávno odkvitol.}}) {{Cite book|title=Slovanstvo a svet budúcnosti. Bratislava 1993, s. 59|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He expressed confidence in the [[Russian Empire]] however, as it was the only country of Slavs that was not dominated by anybody else, yet it was one of the most powerful nations in the world. He often symbolized Slavs as being a tree, with "minor" Slavic nations being branches while the trunk of the tree was Russian. His Pan-Slavic views were unleashed in this book, where he stated that the land of Slovaks should be annexed by the Tsar's empire and that eventually the population could be not only [[Russification|Russified]], but also converted into the rite of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]], religion originally spread by [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Cyril and Methodius]] during the times of [[Great Moravia]], which served as an opposition to the [[Catholic church|Catholic]] missionaries from the [[Franks]]. After the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|Hungarian invasion of Pannonia]], Hungarians converted into Catholicism, which effectively influenced the Slavs living in [[Pannonia]] and in the land south of the Lechs.

However, the Russian Empire often claimed Pan-Slavism as a justification for its aggressive moves in the Balkan Peninsula of Europe against the Ottoman Empire, which conquered and held the land of Slavs for centuries. This eventually led to the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Balkan campaign]] of the Russian Empire, which resulted in the entire Balkan being liberated from the Ottoman Empire, with the help and the initiative of the Russian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Engels, "Germany and Pan-Slavism" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 14'', pp. 156-158.&lt;/ref&gt; Pan-Slavism has some supporters among Czech and Slovak politicians, especially among the nationalistic and far-right ones, such as People's Party - Our Slovakia.

During [[World War I]], captured Slavic soldiers were asked to fight against "oppression in the Austrian Empire". Consequently, some did. (see [[Czechoslovak Legions]])

The creation of an independent [[Czechoslovakia]] made the old ideals of Pan-Slavism anachronistic. Relations with other Slavic states varied, sometimes being so tense it escalated into an armed conflict, such as with the [[Second Polish Republic]] where border clashes over [[Silesia]] resulted in a short hostile conflict, the [[Polish–Czechoslovak War]]. Even tensions between Czechs and Slovaks had appeared before and during the World War II.

The capital city of Slovakia is [[Bratislava]], a name that is a conjunction of the word Brother (Brat) and Glory (Slava), a name which is generally considered as a symbol of Slavic identity, brotherhood and values.

== Pan-Slavism among South Slavs ==
{{Refimprove|section|date=July 2017}}
{{main article|Yugoslavism}}
Pan-Slavism in the south would often turn to Russia for support. The Southern Slavic movement advocated the independence of the Slavic peoples in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Some Serbian intellectuals sought to unite all of the Southern, Balkan Slavs, whether [[Catholicism|Catholic]] ([[Croats]], [[Slovenes]]), [[Islam|Muslim]] ([[Bosniaks]]), or [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] ([[Serbs]], [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], [[Bulgarians]]) as a "Southern-Slavic nation of three faiths".

Austria feared that Pan-Slavists would endanger the empire. In Austria-Hungary Southern Slavs were distributed among several entities: [[Slovenes]] in the Austrian part ([[Carniola]], [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]], [[Gorizia and Gradisca]], [[Trieste]], [[Istria]] (also [[Croats]])), Croats and [[Serbs]] in the Hungarian part within the autonomous [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] and in the Austrian part within the autonomous [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]], and in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], under direct control from Vienna. Due to a different position within Austria-Hungary several different goals were prominent among the Southern Slavs of Austria-Hungary. A strong alternative to Pan-Slavism was [[Austroslavism]],&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{Citation

Because the Serbs were dispersed among several regions, and the fact that they had ties to the independent [[Nation-state|nation state]] of [[Kingdom of Serbia]], they were among the strongest supporters of independence of South-Slavs from Austria-Hungary and uniting into a common state under Serbian monarchy.

In 1863, the [[Association of Serbian Philology]] commemorated the death of [[Cyril]] a thousand years earlier, its president [[Dimitrije Matić]], talked of the creation of an ethnically "pure" Slavonic people: "with God’s help, there should be a whole Slavonic people with purely Slavonic faces and of purely Slavonic character"&lt;ref&gt;Association of Serbian Philology: Hiljadugodišnja 1863:4&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War I the creation of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], under Serbian royalty of the [[Karađorđević dynasty]], united most Southern [[Slavic languages|Slavic-speaking nations]] regardless of religion and cultural background. The only ones they did not unite with were the Bulgarians. Still, in the years after the [[Second World War]], there were proposals to incorporate Bulgaria into a [[Greater Yugoslavia]] thus uniting all south [[Slavic languages|Slavic-speaking nations]] into one state.&lt;ref&gt;Ramet, Sabrina P.; ''The three Yugoslavias: state-building and legitimation, 1918-2005''; [[Indiana University Press]], 2006 {{ISBN|0-253-34656-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was abandoned after the split between [[Josip Broz Tito]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1948. This led to some bitter sentiment between the people of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria in the aftermath.

At the end of Second World War, the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] leader [[Josip Broz Tito]], a Croat, became Yugoslav president, and the country become a socialist republic. Tito advocated [[Brotherhood and unity]] which meant equality among the ethnic groups, including non-Slav minorities. This led to relatively peaceful co-existence and prosperity until the breakup of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|federation]].

== Pan-Slavism in Poland ==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=July 2017}}
Although early Pan-Slavism had found support among some Poles, it soon lost its appeal as the movement became dominated by [[Russia]]. While Russian Pan-Slavists spoke of liberation of other Slavs through Russian actions, parts of [[Poland]] had been ruled by the [[Russian Empire]] since the [[Partitions of Poland]]. At different points in history, Poland often saw itself in partnership with non-Slavic nations, such as [[Hungary-Poland relations|Hungary]], [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Polish–Swedish union|Sweden]] and [[Lithuania]] under the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Especially after 1795, [[First French Republic|Revolutionary]] and [[First French Empire|Napoleonic]] France was held in high regard by most Poles, and seen as the main champion of [[Duchy of Warsaw|reconstitution of their country]], particularly since it was a mutual enemy of Austria, Prussia and Russia. The influence of 19th century Pan-Slavism had little impact in Poland except for creating sympathy towards the other oppressed Slavic nations and their aspirations to independence. At the same time while Pan-Slavism worked against Austro-Hungary with South Slavs, Poles enjoyed a wide autonomy within the state and assumed a loyalist position towards the Hapsburgs. Within the Austro-Hungarian polity, they were able to develop their national culture and preserve [[Polish language]], both of which were under threat in both [[Germany|German]] and [[Russia]]n Empires. A Pan-Slavic federation was proposed, but on the condition that the [[Russian Empire]] would be excluded from such an entity. After Poland regained its independence (from Germany, Austria and Russia) in 1918 no major force considered Pan-Slavism as a serious alternative, viewing Pan-Slavism as little more than a code word for [[Russification]]. During Poland's communist era, the [[USSR]] used Pan-Slavism as propaganda tool to justify its control over the country. The issue of the Pan-Slavism was not part of current mainstream politics, and is widely seen as an ideology of Russian [[imperialism]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Joseph Conrad]] in Notes on Life and Letters.:
&lt;br/&gt;''"... between Polonism and Slavonism there is not so much hatred as a complete and ineradicable incompatibility."'' ... Conrad argues that "nothing is more foreign than what in the literary world is called Slavonism to his ''individual'' sensibility and ''the whole Polish mentality"''&lt;ref&gt;''Notes on Life and Letters''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Pan-Slavism in Russia ==

Pan-Slavism is popular in the large [[immigration]] from the former [[USSR]] to Slavic countries of the [[European Union]]. It expresses fierce populism, nostalgia for the Soviet era, and strong anti-Western [[Feeling|sentiments]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lenta.ru/articles/2015/05/22/slavesobor/ Report about the XII. Pan-slavic congress in Moscow, May 2015 (in Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13277505/RusV_16-17_15_p.pdf |title=Slavic Unity.

During the time of the Soviet Union, Bolshevik teachings viewed Pan-Slavism as a reactionary element formerly used by the [[Russian Empire]].{{cn|date=August 2018}} As a result, Bolsheviks viewed it as contrary to their Marxist ideology. However, with the emergence of [[World War II]], the Stalinist government saw fit to utilize Pan-Slavic politics, resulting in the Pan-Slavic congress being held in Moscow in 1942.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

== Modern-day developments ==
{{Refimprove|section|date=July 2017}}
The authentic idea of unity of the Slavic people was all but gone after [[World War I]] when the maxim "[[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] and [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]] have put an end to all Slavisms"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN3110106051&amp;id=AsO_M5SaxDgC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=%22west+slavs%22&amp;sig=EmpK-yEW2OHxlLLqb7pZ1GvOOws Comparative Slavic Studies] Volume 6, by [[Roman Jakobson]]&lt;/ref&gt; and was finally put to rest with the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]] in Central and Eastern Europe in late 1980s. With the breakup of federal states such as [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]] and the problem of Russian and Serbian dominance in any proposed all-Slavic organisation, the idea of Pan-Slavic unity is mostly considered dead in the western world. Varying relations between the Slavic countries exist nowadays; they range from mutual respect on equal footing and sympathy towards one another through traditional dislike and enmity, to indifference. None, other than culture and heritage oriented organizations, are currently considered as a form of rapprochement among the countries with Slavic origins. The political parties which include panslavism as part of their program usually live on the fringe of the political spectrum (e.g. in Poland candidates from Związek Słowiański got no more than few thousands votes). In modern times, the appeals to Pan-Slavism are often made in [[Belarus]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]] and [[Slovakia]].&lt;ref name="Duleba"&gt;"In other words, the Pan-Slavic resentment is not strange to the Russian Eurasianists, however, this is prevailingly limited to the post-Soviet space. Therein lies the difference between the Eurasians and the Russian radical nationalists in their contemporary attitude to Pan-Slavism. Radical nationalists are the only ones who follow up with the tradition and ideational message of the Central- and South-European Pan-Slavism of the tsarist Russia. Pan-Slavism serves as their tool for demonstrating decisive anti-Western attitudes and as an "historical" folklore employed in domestic-political battles, which sound so sweet to the Russian ear. The ideas of Pan-Slavism only find some echo with the part of some Serbian and partly Slovak nationalists" Alexander Duleba, "From Domination to Partnership - The perspectives of Russian-Central-East European Relations", Final Report to the [[NATO]] Research Fellowship Program, 1996-1998 [http://www.nato.int/acad/fellow/96-98/duleba.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creation of Pan-Slavic languages ==
The similarity of Slavic languages inspired many people to create [[Pan-Slavic language]]s, i.e., [[zonal constructed language]]s for all Slavic people to communicate with one another. Several of these languages were created in the past, but due to the Internet, many more Pan-Slavic languages were created in the [[Digital Age]]. The most popular modern Pan-Slavic language is [[Interslavic language|Interslavic]].{{cn|date=July 2017}}

The '''Pragmatic Sanction of 1830''' ({{Lang-es|Pragmática Sanción}}), issued on 29 March 1830 by King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]], ratified a [[Spanish succession issue of 1789|Decree of 1789]] by [[Charles IV of Spain]], which had replaced the semi-Salic system established by [[Philip V of Spain]] with the mixed succession system that predated the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy (see also [[Carlism]]).

When  [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], from the French [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] acceded to the Spanish throne in the [[Spanish War of Succession]], he brought with him the [[Salic Law]], which restricted succession to the throne to the direct male line. However, King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]] had fathered only two daughters, [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella]] and [[Infanta Luisa Fernanda, Duchess of Montpensier|Luisa Ferdinand of Bourbon]].  Ferdinand's father, [[Charles IV of Spain]] made a weak attempt to eliminate the Salic Law, and Ferdinand brought forth the [[Pragmatic Sanction]] of 1830, so that his oldest daughter would inherit the throne and be declared queen upon his death, as was the Spanish custom.

This removed his brother, [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina]], as the next in the line of succession under Salic Law.  Charles' supporters, among whom was [[Francisco Tadeo Calomarde y Arría|Francisco Calomarde]], pressured Ferdinand VII to repeal the Pragmatic Sanction.  However, a severe attack of [[gout]] incapacitated Ferdinand and when he died on 29 September 1833, Isabella was proclaimed Queen.  Since she was still a minor, the kingdom fell under the regency of her mother [[Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies]].

A '''preliminary ruling''' is a decision of the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) on the interpretation of [[European Union law]], given in response to a request from a court or tribunal of a [[Member state of the European Union|European Union Member State]]. A preliminary ruling is a final determinations of EU law, with no scope for appeal. The ECJ hands down its decision to the referring court, which is then obliged to implement the ruling. 

If, as in ''[[Factortame]]'', the ECJ holds that a Member State's legislation conflicts with EU law, the Member State will be required to "disapply" such law, but the ECJ may not itself amend the Member State's legislation.

Preliminary rulings have traditionally been issued by the ECJ. The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] provides that jurisdiction may be delegated the [[General Court (European Union)|General Court]], but this provision has yet to be put into effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Craig |first1=Paul |last2=de Búrca |first2=Gráinne |title=EU law: text, cases, and materials |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199576999 |pages=482 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preliminary Rulings make up the bulk of [[CJEU]] business, as few persons have ''[[locus standi]]'' to litigate in the Luxembourg court. "Privileged parties" that do have standing include all Member States and EU Institutions, but normally a private person or ''"undertaking"''&lt;ref&gt;An "undertaking" is EU-speak for a company, partnership or business firm. See TFEU Arts 101 &amp; 102.&lt;/ref&gt; will have standing only if they are the addressee of an [[Decision (European Union)|EU Decision]].

==Procedure==
If a court or tribunal of a Member State finds a provision of EU law to be ambiguous, equivocal or unclear, it MAY seek a preliminary ruling; and if that court or tribunal is one from which there is no appeal, the court MUST make an application. In either case, the domestic court be be adjourned until the ECJ ruling is issued. The question to the ECJ must be short and succinct, but may be accompanied by documents explaining the context and circumstances of the issue. The ECJ may decline to give judgement in the absence of a genuine dispute, on the basis that it will not consider "moot points".&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61980J0244:EN:NOT Case 244/80, Pasquale Foglia v. Mariella Novello paragraph 18.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 267 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] provides:

{{quote|
The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings concerning:
{{plainlist|
*(a) the interpretation of the [[Treaties of the European Union|Treaties]];
*(b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union;}}
Where such a question is raised before any court or tribunal of a Member State, that court or tribunal may, if it considers that a decision on the question is necessary to enable it to give judgment, request the Court to give a ruling thereon.

Where any such question is raised in a case pending before a court or tribunal of a Member State against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law, that court or tribunal shall bring the matter before the Court.

If such a question is raised in a case pending before a court or tribunal of a Member State with regard to a person in custody, the Court of Justice of the European Union shall act with the minimum of delay.&lt;ref&gt;Otherwise, an application to the ECJ may take a year or so before the question is answered.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Courts that may ask questions==
What constitutes a "court or tribunal" is a matter of Union law and it is not to be determined by reference to national law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61992J0024:EN:NOT Case C-24/92, ''Corbiau v Administration des Contributions'' at paragraph 15.]&lt;/ref&gt; In determining whether or not a body is a "court or tribunal of Member State" the European Courts will take a number of issues into account, namely whether—

# it is established by law,
# it is permanent,
# its jurisdiction is compulsory,
# it has an inter partes procedure,
# it applies rules of law, and
# it is independent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61996J0054:EN:NOT Case C-54/96 ''Dorsch Consult Ingenieurgesellschaft v Bundesbaugesellschaft Berlin'' at paragraph 23.]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these criteria are not absolute. In ''Broekmeulen v Huisarts Registratie Commissie''&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61980J0246:EN:NOT Case 246/80, ''C. Broekmeulen v Huisarts Registratie Commissie'']&lt;/ref&gt; the ECJ ruled that a body established under the auspices of the Royal Medical Society for the Promotion of Medicine was a "court or tribunal" within the meaning of the treaty, even though that society was a private association. Also the [[Benelux Court of Justice]] was considered a court within this context, as a court common to several (Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg) Member States. Also the [[Unified Patent Court]], as a court common to several Member States is expected to be able to ask prejudicial questions.

==Right and duty to refer for a preliminary ruling==
Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) establishing the preliminary reference procedure differentiates between the right and the duty of national courts to seek a preliminary ruling. Under the discretionary reference stipulated in Article 267(2) TFEU, a national "court or tribunal" may ask the CJEU to give a preliminary ruling if it considers that a decision on the question is "necessary" to enable it to give a judgment in a particular case. The obligatory reference (duty to refer) is established in two cases: with respect to national courts adjudicating at last instance (Article 267(3) TFEU ) and with respect of all courts faced with a question of the validity of EU law. 
The obligation of national courts of last instance to refer for a preliminary ruling when a question of the interpretation of EU law arises is subject to certain exceptions. In accordance with the jurisprudence of the Court, a national court is relieved from the duty to refer (i) when EU law questions are not relevant to the decision in the main proceedings, (ii) in a situation before a national court is “materially identical with a question which has already been subject of a preliminary ruling in a similar case” (‘acte éclairé’), or (iii) when the proper interpretation of EU law is “so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt” (‘acte clair’).&lt;ref&gt;Limante, Agne. Recent Developments in the Acte Clair Case Law of the EU Court of Justice: Towards a more Flexible Approach. JCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies, 2016, DOI: 10.1111/jcms.12434&lt;/ref&gt;

== General scope of preliminary rulings ==
The Court of Justice Decision has the force of '''''res judicata'''''. It is binding not only on the national court on whose initiative the reference for a preliminary ruling was made but also on all of the national courts of the Member States.

In the context of a reference for a preliminary ruling concerning validity, if the European instrument is declared invalid all of the instruments adopted based on it are also invalid. It then falls to the competent European institutions to adopt a new instrument to rectify the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV%3Al14552|title=EUR-Lex|last=|first=|date=|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruling on non-EU cases==
The European Court of Justice is competent to give rulings regarding the interpretation of treaties to which the European Union is a party, as those treaties are considered to be part of EU law. ECJ is however also competent regarding the application of certain treaties between EU member states, although the procedure may be subject to different procedures. Two such treaties are the [[1968 Brussels Convention]] on jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters and the 1980 Rome convention on applicable law (now mostly replaced by the Brussels I and Rome I regulations respectively).

==Similar systems==
The possibility to ask for a preliminary ruling is also embedded in other legal systems. 
*The courts of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg may ask "questions regarding the interpretation of the law" to the [[Benelux Court of Justice]] regarding certain Benelux conventions and regulations. 
*Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway may request the [[EFTA Court of Justice]] for an "advisory opinion" regarding the interpretation of the European Economic Area Agreement, as well as EU regulations that apply to those states.

Opponents stressed particularly the effects on public availability of biomedical research results, such as those funded by [[NIH]] grants, submitting that under the bill "taxpayers who already paid for the research would have to pay again to read the results".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Research Bought, Then Paid For|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/11/opinion/research-bought-then-paid-for.html|accessdate=January 11, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 10, 2012|first=Michael |last=Eisen|authorlink=Michael Eisen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Taylor from the [[University of Bristol]] said that the bill's denial of access to scientific research would cause "preventable deaths in developing countries" and "an incalculable loss to science", and said Representatives Issa and Maloney were motivated by multiple donations they had received from the academic publisher [[Elsevier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jan/16/academic-publishers-enemies-science|title=Academic publishers have become the enemies of science|date=16 January 2011|first=Mike|last=Taylor|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An online petition – ''[[The Cost of Knowledge]]'' – inspired by [[UK|British]] mathematician and [[Fields Medal|Fields medalist]] [[Timothy Gowers]] to raise awareness of the bill, to call for lower prices for journals and to promote increased open access to information, was signed by more than 10,000 scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cost of Knowledge|url=http://thecostofknowledge.com/|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signatories vowed to withhold their support from Elsevier journals as editors, [[Peer review|reviewers]] or authors "unless they radically change how they operate". On February 27, 2012, Elsevier announced its withdrawal of support for the bill, citing concerns from journal authors, editors, and reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elsevier withdraws support for the Research Works Act|url=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/intro.cws_home/newmessagerwa|publisher=Elsevier|date=February 27, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229220817/http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/intro.cws_home/newmessagerwa|archivedate=February 29, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While participants in the boycott celebrated the dropping of support for the Research Works Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doctorow|first=Cory|title=Elsevier withdraws support from Research Works Act, bill collapses|url=http://boingboing.net/2012/02/28/elsevier-withdraws-support-fro.html|work=BoingBoing|accessdate=2 March 2012|authorlink=Cory Doctorow|date=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsevier denied that their action was a result of the boycott and stated that they took this action at the request of those researchers who did not participate in the boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronicle.com/article/Legislation-to-Bar/130949/ |title=Legislation to Bar Public-Access Requirement on Federal Research Is Dead |first=Jennifer |last=Howard |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=27 February 2012 |accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related legislation and executive action==
The Research Works Act followed other attempts to challenge institutional open-access mandates in the US.  On September 9, 2008, an earlier bill aimed at reversing the NIH's Public Access Policy – the [[Fair Copyright in Research Works Act]], or Conyers Bill – was introduced as 110 H. R. 6845 in the House of Representatives at the [[110th United States Congress]] by U.S Representative [[John Conyers]] (D-MI), with three cosponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Text 110th Congress (2007–2008) H.R.6845.IH|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:HR06845:|publisher=The Library of Congress|accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was referred to the [[House Committee on the Judiciary]], to which Conyers delivered an introduction on September 10, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech of John Conyers in the House of Representatives, September 10, 2008|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?r110:2:./temp/~r110kLvpzy:|publisher=The Library of Congress|accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the start of the [[111th United States Congress]], Conyers and six-cosponsors reintroduced the bill to the House of Representatives as 111 H. R. 801 on February 3, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Text 111th Congress (2009–2010) H.R.801.IH|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.801:|publisher=The Library of Congress|accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was on the same day referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary and on March 16 to the [[Subcommittee on Courts and Competition Policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill summary and status, H.R.801|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR00801:@@@X|publisher=The Library of Congress|accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the [[Federal Research Public Access Act]] proposed to expand the open public access mandate to research funded by eleven U.S. federal agencies. Originally introduced to the Senate in 2006 by [[John Cornyn]] (R-TX) with two cosponsors,&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|109|S.|2695}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was reintroduced in 2009 by Lieberman, co-sponsored by Cornyn,&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|S.|1373}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaiser|first=Jocelyn|title=Lawmakers Reintroduce Public Access Bill|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/02/lawmakers-reintroduce-public-access.html|work=ScienceInsider|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|accessdate=10 February 2012|date=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These bills proposed requiring that those eleven agencies with research expenditures over $100 million create online repositories of journal articles of the research completed by that agency and make them publicly available without charge within six months after it has been published in a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Research Public Access Act 2006|url=http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/issues/frpaa2006/index.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 22, 2013 the [[Barack Obama|Obama]] administration issued a similar policy memorandum, directing Federal agencies with more than $100 million in annual research and development expenditures to develop plans to make research freely available to the public within one year of publication in most cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/copyright/article/56076-in-historic-act-obama-administration-issues-public-access-directive.html White House Issues Public Access Directive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Stand Down Order''' was the title of a [[general order]] issued by Field Marshall [[Claude Auchinleck]], the Supreme Commander of the [[Dominion of India|Indian]] and [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistani]] military forces, in 1947. It directed that, in the event of a war between the newly independent [[dominion]]s of India and Pakistan, all the British officers on both sides should immediately stand down. The order was never invoked. However, it was raised when the Pakistani Governor General, [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]], ordered Pakistani Army to march into Kashmir following the Indian air lift of troops for its defence. At Auchinleck's instance, Jinnah was forced to rescind his order. In subsequent months, the British government watered down the strength of the order, and General [[Douglas Gracey]], the Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistani Army, defied it. Three brigades of the Pakistani Army were fighting in Kashmir in May 1948, as reported by Pakistan's foreign minister, Sir [[Zafrullah Khan]], to the [[United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan]].

{{italic title}}
'''''The Reporters''''' is a book on the subject of [[law report]]ers, written by [[John William Wallace]].

==Nineteenth-century reviews==
In 1847, [[J. G. Marvin]] said of the second edition, revised, of this book:

{{Blockquote|Mr. Wallace has embodied, in one hundred pages, more useful information respecting the Reporters, than can be found in any single publication whatever. Mr. Sumner contributed two articles in the 8th and 12th volumes of the American Jurist, upon Legal Bibliography, and Mr. Ram, in his work entitled ''The Science of Legal Judgement'', collects many judicial criticisms upon the Reports and elementary law book, but in point of fulness of illustration, and appropriateness of comment, Mr. Wallace's volume, as to the Reporters, surpasses all that had previously been done. He confines his illustrations chiefly to the Reports, from the earliest period of reporting in England, to the close of the reign of Geo. II. Prefixed to the more immediate subject matter of the work, are some remarks upon the value to be placed upon the incidental observations of the Bench upon the merits of the Reporters, the original language in which the Reports were taken, the sources from whence the MSS. of the published volumes were obtained, and a general survey of the laborers in the "old fields, out of which the new corn must come." The work is written in a peculiar, and happy style, and impresses the reader favourably with the author's abundant reading, and aptness for communicating this species of information. The volume lacks only one thing, an Index. 6 L. R. 425.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin, J.G. [[Marvin's Legal Bibliography|Legal Bibliography, or a thesaurus of American, English, Irish and Scotch law books:together with some continental treatises]]. T &amp; J W Johnson. 1847. Page 715. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DSNEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA715#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Digitised copy] from [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1882, the New Jersey Law Journal said of the fourth edition, revised and enlarged, of this book:

{{Blockquote|A new edition of ''The Reporters'' is of real importance as a means of keeping alive a knowledge of the old reports. In the multiplication of law reports, made almost by machinery, there is a danger that the younger Bar will overlook the old ''Reporters'' and miss the treasures which they contain, and so have no acquaintance with the sources of the law.

''The Reporters'' is a delightful book - the last edition is even more entertaining than the others - and if it is only to be easily obtained it cannot fail of being generally read.&lt;ref&gt;The [[New Jersey Law Journal]]. Volume 5. Honeyman &amp; Rowe. 1882. Page 128.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Twentieth-century reviews==
In 1988, Bookman's Yearbook said that this book was "well worth using".&lt;ref&gt;Bookman's Yearbook. Bookman's Weekly. 1988. Page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Glanville Williams described this book as a "detailed monograph".&lt;ref&gt;[[Glanville Williams]]. [[Learning the Law]]. Eleventh Edition. Stevens. 1982. Page 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harvard Law Review said, in relation to [[Year Books|Year-Book]] bibliography, that this book discloses little that is valuable and its accuracy does not stand the test of verification.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harvard Law Review]]. 1900. Volume 14. Page 558.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thio was educated at the [[Singapore Chinese Girls' School]] (1975–1984) and [[Hwa Chong Junior College]] (1984–1986), at the latter on a Humanities Award from the [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|Ministry of Education]]. She took a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A. (Hons.)) in [[Jurisprudence]] at [[Keble College, Oxford]]&lt;ref name="NUS CV"&gt;{{citation|title=Curriculum vitae: Professor (Dr.) THIO Li-ann |url=http://law.nus.edu.sg/faculty/staff/staffcv/ThioLi_annCV05Feb07.pdf |publisher=[[National University of Singapore Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]], [[National University of Singapore]] |date=5 February 2007 |accessdate=18 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070720210334/http://law.nus.edu.sg/faculty/staff/staffcv/ThioLi_annCV05Feb07.pdf |archivedate=20 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}.&lt;/ref&gt; between 1987 and 1990.&lt;ref name="Parliament"/&gt; At Oxford she was awarded the Law Moderations Book Prize (Constitutional Law, Criminal Law and
Roman Law) in 1988. She was called to the Bar as a [[Barristers in England and Wales|barrister]] at [[Gray's Inn]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="NUS CV"/&gt;

==Career as law academic==
Thio joined the Faculty of Law of the NUS as a Senior Tutor in 1991, and was appointed Lecturer in 1992. That same year she embarked on postgraduate law studies at [[Harvard Law School]] on a National University of Singapore Overseas Graduate Scholarship, and obtained a [[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.) in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Her LL.M. thesis was entitled ''Constitutional Interpretation: Lost Lessons from the Fundamental Principles of the U.S. Constitution'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to NUS, where in 1997 she was appointed an Assistant Professor. Between 1997 and 2000 she carried out [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] research at the [[University of Cambridge]] on another NUS Overseas Graduate Scholarship, and was duly conferred this degree in 2000. Her Ph.D. dissertation, entitled ''Managing Babel: The International Legal Protection of Minorities in the Twentieth Century'', was subsequently published by [[Martinus Nijhoff]] Publishers in 2005. In June 2000 she was appointed an Associate Professor, and achieved the rank of full Professor in July 2006.&lt;ref name="Parliament"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NUS CV"/&gt; Her research interests are the following:

*Constitutionalism and human rights in Asia.
*Domestic and comparative perspectives of constitutional law and administrative law.
*International human rights law and the rights of peoples.
*Law and religion.
*Public international law, its history and theory.&lt;ref name="NUS"&gt;{{citation|title=Academic profiles: THIO Li-ann |url=http://law.nus.edu.sg/faculty/staff/profileview.asp?UserID=lawtla |publisher=Faculty of Law, National University of Singapore |date=25 June 2004 |accessdate=16 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015140755/http://law.nus.edu.sg/faculty/staff/profileview.asp?UserID=lawtla |archivedate=15 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thio was Young Asian Scholar at the [[Melbourne University Law School]] in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;Thio's ''curriculum vitae'' states that this took place in 1998: {{citation|title=Curriculum vitae: Professor (Dr.) THIO Li-ann |url=http://law.nus.edu.sg/faculty/staff/staffcv/ThioLi_annCV05Feb07.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Faculty of Law, National University of Singapore |date=5 February 2007 |accessdate=18 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070720210334/http://law.nus.edu.sg/faculty/staff/staffcv/ThioLi_annCV05Feb07.pdf |archivedate=20 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}.&lt;/ref&gt; was ranked as an NUS Excellent Teacher in 2001–2002 and 2002–2003, and was given a Young Researcher Award by NUS in 2004. In March 2006, she was a Visiting Lecturer at the Faculty of Law of the [[University of Hong Kong]], where she was one of the academics teaching a course on "National Protection of Human Rights". In September of that year she returned to the [[University of Melbourne]] as a Senior Fellow of its Graduate Law Programme to teach a course entitled "Constitutionalism in Asian Societies".&lt;ref name="NUS CV"/&gt;

Thio appeared as an expert witness before the [[Federal Court of Australia]] in the [[extradition]] of Michael McCrea to Singapore to stand trial for murder (2003), and as a consultant to a delegation of the [[House of Representatives of Japan]] (30 September 2002) and to the [[University of Warwick]] on academic freedom issues (2005).&lt;ref name="NUS CV"/&gt;

==Term as Nominated Member of Parliament==
{{Original research|date=November 2007}}
{{Weasel|date=March 2009}}
From 18 January 2007, Thio was appointed a [[Nominated Member of Parliament]] of the 11th Session of the [[Parliament of Singapore]] for a two-and-a-half-year term.&lt;ref name="NUS CV"/&gt;

In October 2007, the [[Parliament of Singapore]] reviewed the [[Penal Code (Singapore)|Penal Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Penal Code|cap=224|ed=1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of doing so, it decided not to repeal [[Sections 377 and 377A of the Penal Code (Singapore)|section 377A of the Code]] and thus continued to criminalise sexual activity between males. In the course of the debate in Parliament, Thio gave a speech to support the continued criminalisation of sexual activity between males, and likened gay sex to "shoving a straw up your nose to drink."&lt;ref name="nyt-nyu"/&gt; She claimed to have support from a majority of Singaporeans, and stated she spoke "at the risk of being burned at the stake by militant activists."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Thio Li-ann |title=Speech, Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Penal Code Revisions, 22–23 October 2007 (Professor Dr. Thio Li-ann, Nominated Member) |url=http://keep377a.com/Media/ThioLi-AnnSpeech.pdf |publisher=Keep377A.com |date=23 October 2007 |accessdate=19 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228003248/http://keep377a.com/Media/ThioLi-AnnSpeech.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Thio mentioned the existence of an active gay agenda that seeks to lobby the government and radically change sexual norms.&lt;ref name="nyt-nyu"/&gt;

The Internet subsequently saw a flood of websites heavily rebutting Thio's speech, most of which focused on her lurid straw-up-the-nose analogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/23/education/23nyu.html|title=Opposition Causes Thio Li-ann to Skip N.Y.U.

In it, Chua acknowledged Thio's position in her speech that secularism could challenge religion. However, Chua disagreed that religion has been antagonised in Singapore, and encouraged that specific explanation be given as to how the repeal of a law would in reality harm the Singaporean society.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Chua Mui Hong|title=Rules of engagement for God and politics|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=16 November 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thio's speech also drew the criticism of [[Michael Kirby (judge)|Michael Kirby]], then a judge of the [[High Court of Australia]], who referenced it in a speech he delivered in [[Brisbane]] on 16 November 2007. The content of his speech was subsequently published in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' on 19 November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Michael Kirby (judge)|Michael Kirby]]|title=Selective tolerance is not tolerance at all|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/selective-tolerance-is-not-tolerance-at-all/2007/11/18/1195321603784.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=19 November 2007|access-date=26 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120235251/http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/selective-tolerance-is-not-tolerance-at-all/2007/11/18/1195321603784.html|archive-date=20 November 2007|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the debate, Thio revealed that playwright [[Alfian Sa'at]] had sent her a short email saying, among other things, that "I hope I outlive you long enough to see the repeal of 377A and on that day I will piss on your grave."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alfian Sa’at Vs Thio Li-Ann|url=http://pseudonymity.wordpress.com/2007/10/27/alfian-saat-vs-thio-li-ann/|website=Pseudonymity|accessdate=21 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222053745/http://pseudonymity.wordpress.com/2007/10/27/alfian-saat-vs-thio-li-ann/|archive-date=22 December 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sa'at later took responsibility for the email, saying it was sent in a moment of folly in response to the rumour that Thio had called the police to complain about a "Pink Picnic" some members of the gay community were organising in the [[Singapore Botanic Gardens|Botanic Gardens]]. Thio later denied the allegation, and Sa'at apologised. Subsequently, in November 2007, Thio was alerted by the media to an anonymous threatening letter addressed to her stating: "We know where you work, we'll send people there to hunt you down". Thio made a police report the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Li Xueying|title=NMP Thio files 2nd police report after getting threat|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=8 November 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Question regarding support from the majority===
Thio's strong position towards retaining the code drew much protest from some Singaporeans. Two issues were constantly raised. The first issue was the question of the real existence of a majority against repeal of the code. The second issue was the question of whether a stance against homosexual behavior would equate to wanting a code to criminalize the act of sodomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trevvy.com/sgboyx/index.php?showforum=5|title=Trevvy - Forums - Crying OUT Loud Singapore!|first=Trevvy Trevvy.com SGBOY Sgboy.com Gay Singapore Malaysia Hong Kong Thailand Australia News Lifestyle Personals Events Forums|last=Resources|website=www.trevvy.com|access-date=25 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121064041/http://www.trevvy.com/sgboyx/index.php?showforum=5|archive-date=21 November 2007|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns were also raised by a law professor on whether it was realistically possible to enforce such a code, whether it would lead to dangers of entrapment, and whether the informal position of the government not to enforce the code would reverse overnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=K.C. Vijayan|title=NUS don warns of 377A fallout|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=30 October 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, an alleged email also surfaced during the course of discussion, in which Senior Pastor Derek Hong of [[Church of Our Saviour, Singapore]], supposedly encouraged acquaintances to lobby the government to decide against repealing the code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psa91.com/pdf/derek_hong.htm|title=Elim Sanctuary - Gays &amp; Christianity - Email from Derek Hong|website=www.psa91.com|access-date=25 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028113654/http://www.psa91.com/pdf/derek_hong.htm|archive-date=28 October 2007|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The email contains a suggested format of writing, which could be found repeated heavily in actual letters to ''The Straits Times'' and [http://www.reach.gov.sg reach.gov.sg], the Singaporean government online feedback website. The content of the alleged email is strongly similar to an earlier one sent in 2003 by [[Cornerstone Community Church]]. Neither Hong nor his church has issued any statement on this matter.

==NYU Law School controversy==
Thio was to be a visiting human rights professor at [[New York University School of Law]] in the fall of 2009 until she withdrew her acceptance in July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Richard Revesz|Richard L.

==Personal life==

===Daughter of Thio Su Mien===
Thio's father is Thio Gim Hock and her brother is senior counsel Thio Shen Yi. Her maternal grandfather is Reverend Huang Yang Ying, first principal of [[Anglican High School, Singapore|Anglican High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/printheritage/image.aspx?id=00e7500e-8be4-477d-9842-f7904c82d358 | title=Dr. Thio Su Mien with her young children, 1971 | website=BooksSG | access-date=29 July 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803122110/http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/printheritage/image.aspx?id=00e7500e-8be4-477d-9842-f7904c82d358 | archive-date=3 August 2017 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother is Dr. (Mrs.) [[Thio Su Mien]], who was formerly the Dean of the Faculty of Law of the National University of Singapore, and is now in private practice. Dr. Thio Su Mien came to the attention of the Singaporean public in 2003 when she sent a letter to ''The Straits Times'' stating her strong disagreement with homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Thio Su Mien|title=No to homosexuality|newspaper=[[Streats]]|date=22 July 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter, signed by eight persons, was in response to a speech by the then [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] [[Goh Chok Tong]] in which he mentioned that the [[Civil service|Civil Service]] would not discriminate against employing homosexual individuals. On 9 February 2006, Dr Thio Su Mien also wrote another letter to ''The Straits Times'' which, amongst other things, stated her belief that the [[American Psychiatric Association]] had ceased to regard homosexuality as a [[mental disorder]] due to "[[American Psychiatric Association#History|pressure tactics from homosexual activists]] — including riots and disruptions of APA meetings".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=M. Nirmala|title=Gay backlash|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]]|date=23 July 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====[[Association of Women for Action and Research|AWARE]] Takeover by Thio Su Mien====

In 2009, a group of conservative Christian women from the [[Church of Our Saviour, Singapore|Church of Our Savior]], under the leadership of Josie Lau and orchestrated by Dr Thio Su Mien, took over the executive council of the group alleging [[Association of Women for Action and Research|AWARE]], a non-governmental organization in Singapore concerned with promoting gender equality. 6 of the 11 newly elected executive committee were church members who had only joined the group 3 months prior to the election, and 80 of the 120 attendees of the meeting were similarly new members from the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Kalinga Seneviratne|title=SINGAPORE: Evangelical Christians Take on Civil Society|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2009/04/singapore-evangelical-christians-take-on-civil-society/|date=30 April 2009|access-date=19 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120023303/http://www.ipsnews.net/2009/04/singapore-evangelical-christians-take-on-civil-society/|archive-date=20 January 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old guard called for a no-confidence vote and the new council was voted out of office on 2 May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;"Taken unawares; Singapore's NGO furore," in: ''The Economist'', 9 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 2,175 people who voted at the meeting, 1,414 voted for the no-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;Yong, Debbie. 2009. "Getting to know Aware's new exco; Members talk about EGM, its sex education programme and plans for future over dinner," in: ''The Straits Times'', 10 May.&lt;/ref&gt; Deputy Prime minister [[Wong Kan Seng]] commented that "a group of conservative Christians, all attending the same church, which held strong views on homosexuality, had moved in and taken over AWARE because they disapproved of what AWARE had been doing", and called for tolerance, cautioning that religion and politics must be kept separate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mha.gov.sg/news_details.aspx?nid=MTQ0MA%3D%3D-H1aIkdI4Ksw%3D Comments by DPM and Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng in response to media queries related to AWARE ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517040507/http://www.mha.gov.sg/news_details.aspx?nid=MTQ0MA%3D%3D-H1aIkdI4Ksw%3D |date=17 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, 2009, during Thio Li Ann's first speech in parliament since the event, Thio Li-Ann accused the local press of biased reporting on the events surrounding the attempted takeover. Han Fook Kwang, then editor of the Straits Times, responded in an editorial and expressed his sadness at the vindictiveness of "critics and the length to which they are prepared to go to attack our professionalism" and integrity, detailing the sequence of events and how their journalists had investigated and reported on the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Han Fook Kwang|title=How ST covered the story|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=30 May 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious affiliation===
Thio is a Christian. In an interview with the local daily ''[[The Straits Times]]'' on 2 November 2007, Thio shared her personal story of how she converted from a "very, very arrogant" atheist to a Christian in 1987.&lt;ref name="nyt-nyu"/&gt; Having entered Oxford University to read jurisprudence, she attended a Christian Union talk then and claimed to be "stopped" by a voice.

"I basically had a sense that God was talking to me. I had stood up to walk out and I heard someone say, 'Stop'. And no one was around me. Everybody was busy doing their own thing. I was one of only one or two Chinese girls in this whole room of [[ang moh]]s. And then I just had the sense that I had encountered God, that he knew my name and I was shocked." Thio was quoted as saying in the interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Li Xueying|title=A fiery NMP gets her baptism of fire|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=2 November 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

She added, "'I don't know what [[right wing]] is. This is funny because I was always considered a political leftie and now I'm a rightie."

The '''Treaty of Kiel''' ({{lang-no|Kieltraktaten}}) or '''Peace of Kiel''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]] and {{lang-no|Kielfreden}} or ''{{lang|sv|freden i Kiel}}'') was concluded between the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and the [[Kingdom of Sweden]] on one side and the [[Denmark–Norway|Kingdoms of Denmark and Norway]] on the other side on 14 January 1814 in [[Kiel]].&lt;ref name=Schaefer137&gt;Schäfer (2002), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; It ended the hostilities between the parties in the ongoing [[Napoleonic Wars]], where the United Kingdom and Sweden were part of the anti-French camp (the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]]) while Denmark–Norway was allied to [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].&lt;ref name=Schaefer137/&gt;

[[Frederick VI of Denmark]] joined the anti-French alliance, ceded [[Heligoland]] to [[George III of the United Kingdom]], and further ceded the [[Kingdom of Norway]] to [[Charles XIII of Sweden]] in return for [[Swedish Pomerania]].&lt;ref name=Schaefer137/&gt; Specifically excluded from the exchange were the Norwegian dependencies of [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]], which remained in the union with Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;Dörr (2004), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; (Norway would unsuccessfully contest the Danish claim to all of Greenland in the [[Eastern Greenland Case]] of 1931–33.&lt;ref name=Cavell433&gt;Cavell (2008), pp. 433ff&lt;/ref&gt;)

However, not all provisions of the treaty would come into force. Norway declared its independence, adopted a [[Constitution of Norway|constitution]] and elected Crown [[Christian VIII of Denmark|Prince Christian Frederik]] as its own king. Sweden therefore refused to hand over [[Swedish Pomerania]], which instead passed to [[Prussia]] after the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815. After a short [[Swedish-Norwegian War (1814)|war with Sweden]], Norway accepted entering into a [[Union between Sweden and Norway|personal union with Sweden]] at the [[Convention of Moss]]. King Christian Frederik abdicated after convening an extraordinary [[Parliament|Storting]], which revised the Constitution to allow for the Union. It was formally established when the Storting elected Charles XIII as king of Norway on 4 November 1814.

==Background==
{{see also|War of the Sixth Coalition}}

In the beginning of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], [[Denmark-Norway]] and the [[Kingdom of Sweden]] tried to maintain neutrality&lt;ref name=Olesen285&gt;Olesen (2008), p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; but soon became involved in the fighting, joining opposite camps. Swedish king [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|Gustav IV Adolf]] entered an alliance with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and the [[Russian Empire]] against [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1804, and declared war on [[Napoleonic France]] in 1805.&lt;ref name=Olesen285/&gt; The United Kingdom, which had declared war on France in 1803, paid subsidies to Sweden.&lt;ref name=Olesen285/&gt; Before Gustav IV Adolf marched his forces out of [[Swedish Pomerania]], [[Brandenburg-Pomeranian conflict|a province long coveted by Prussia]], he negotiated an agreement that Prussia would not attack it.&lt;ref name=Olesen285/&gt; Denmark remained neutral.&lt;ref name=Olesen285/&gt;

In 1807, Napoleonic forces [[Siege of Stralsund (1807)|seized Swedish Pomerania]] and forced Prussia and Russia to sign the [[Treaty of Tilsit]].&lt;ref name=Olesen287&gt;Olesen (2008), p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; Russia was therein obliged to attack Napoleon's enemies, and since Gustav IV Adolf refused to break his alliance with the United Kingdom, the tsar invaded [[Finland]] and [[Treaty of Fredrikshamn|severed it from Sweden]] in the [[Finnish War]], 1808/1809.&lt;ref name=Olesen287/&gt; [[Anglo-Swedish War (1810–1812)|Sweden could no longer uphold her anti-French foreign policy]], and French Marshal [[Jean Baptiste Bernadotte]] was elected heir to the Swedish throne in 1810.&lt;ref name=Olesen287/&gt; Denmark-Norway entered an alliance with France after the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|second British bombardment of Copenhagen]] in 1807.&lt;ref name=Olesen289&gt;Olesen (2008), p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dano-British treaty==

The treaty between the [[Kingdom of Denmark]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] was negotiated by Danish diplomat [[Edmund Bourke (1761-1821)|Edmund Bourke]] and the British envoy at the Swedish court, [[Edward Thornton (1766–1852)|Edward Thornton]].&lt;ref name=Jenssen168/&gt; It consisted of 14 articles, to which two articles were added in [[Brussels]] on 7 April.&lt;ref name=Jenssen168/&gt;

{{multiple image|image1=Fiedrichvidenmark.jpg|image2=George III of the United Kingdom.jpg|footer=[[Frederick VI of Denmark]] (left) and [[George III of the United Kingdom]]|width1=150|width2=167}}

In article III, the United Kingdom was obliged to return all occupied Danish possessions to the Danish king.&lt;ref name=Jenssen168/&gt; Excepted was the island of [[Heligoland]], where the British king was granted "full and unlimited sovereignty".&lt;ref name=Jenssen168/&gt;

In article VI, the Danish king joined the anti-[[Napoleonic France|Napoleonic]] alliance, and obliged himself to maintain an army of 10,000 men that was to be joined to the Allied forces in Northern Germany and likewise be commanded by the Swedish crown prince.&lt;ref name=Jenssen169&gt;Jenssen-Tusch (1852), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; This Danish contingent was to be treated the same way the Swedish contingent was treated, and the Danish king was to receive an annual 400,000 pounds of British subsidies for maintenance and pay of the army, to be paid in monthly installments as soon as the army entered Allied service.&lt;ref name=Jenssen169/&gt;

Article VIII was concerned with the abolishment of [[slave trade]].&lt;ref name=Jenssen169/&gt; In article X, the British king promised the Danish king to negotiate further compensation for Denmark's territorial cessions to Sweden in a pending final peace.&lt;ref name=Jenssen169/&gt; In article XIII, older Dano-British treaties were confirmed.&lt;ref name=Jenssen169/&gt;

The articles added in Brussels were concerned with the property of Danish subjects in the colonies or in ceded territories, which was to remain untouched by the British for the next three years, and equal treatment of Danish, British and Hanoveranian subjects, who were not to be prosecuted because of their participation in the war on different sides, nor because of their political or religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=Jenssen169/&gt;

==Dano-Swedish treaty==
[[File:Gustaf af Wetterstedt (from Hildebrand, Sveriges historia).jpg|thumb|150px|[[Gustaf af Wetterstedt|Wetterstedt]]]]

The treaty between the [[Kingdom of Denmark]] and the [[Kingdom of Sweden]] was negotiated by Danish diplomat [[Edmund Bourke (1761-1821)|Edmund Bourke]] (Burke) and Swedish envoy Baron [[Gustaf af Wetterstedt]] with British mediation.&lt;ref name=Jenssen165&gt;Jenssen-Tusch (1852), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of 28 articles and one separate article.&lt;ref name=Jenssen165/&gt; In article III, the Danish king promised to join the alliance against [[Napoleonic France]],&lt;ref&gt;Jenssen-Tusch (1852), pp. 165–166&lt;/ref&gt; and with reference to the Dano-British treaty confirms his obligation to put part of his army under Swedish command.&lt;ref name=Jenssen166&gt;Jenssen-Tusch (1852), p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

In article IV, the Danish king in his and his successors' name "irrevocably and forever" renounced claims to the [[Kingdom of Norway]] in favor of the Swedish king.&lt;ref name=Jenssen166/&gt; The Norwegian kingdom was defined as consisting of the bishoprics of [[Christiansand]], [[Bergen]], [[Akershus]] and [[Trondheim]], as well as the coastal islands and the northern regions of [[Nordland]] and [[Finnmark]] to the Russian border.&lt;ref name=Jenssen166/&gt; Excepted were [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]].&lt;ref name=Jenssen166/&gt; The Norwegian subjects were freed of their obligations to the Danish king.&lt;ref name=Jenssen166/&gt; In article VI, the Swedish crown took over the debts and financial obligations of Norway, which was to be determined by a joint Dano-Swedish commission.&lt;ref name=Jenssen166/&gt;

Article VII ruled that [[Swedish Pomerania]] was to be handed over to Denmark.&lt;ref name=Jenssen166/&gt; In article XV, it was ruled that the Swedish forces were to take over the Norwegian fortresses as soon as the treaty was ratified, and that they were to abandon Swedish Pomerania as soon as the Norwegian fortresses [[Fredriksten]], [[Fredrikstad Fortress|Fredrikstad]], [[Kongsvinger]] and [[Akershus Fortress|Akershus]] were handed over.&lt;ref name=Jenssen167&gt;Jenssen-Tusch (1852), p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; In article XIII,&lt;ref name=Jenssen166/&gt; the Swedish king promised the Danish king to negotiate full compensation for the cession of Norway in a pending final peace, and the cession of Swedish Pomerania is described as a "proof" of this intention.&lt;ref name=Jenssen167/&gt;

[[File:Charles XIII of Sweden.jpg|thumb|175px|left|[[Charles XIII of Sweden]]]]

In article XII, the king of Sweden promised to maintain the Norwegian [[University of Oslo|University]] of Christiania, and the Pomeranian [[University of Greifswald]], which was to pass to Denmark according to article VII, and confirmed donations made before the exchange.&lt;ref name=Jenssen166/&gt; Also, it was agreed in article XX that subjects of the Danish king could choose within the next six years whether they would finally settle in Norway or Denmark, whereby property in the realm which would not become the permanent residence was to be sold only to inhabitants of this realm.&lt;ref name=Jenssen167/&gt; This provision was also enacted with respect to Swedish Pomerania.&lt;ref name=Jenssen167/&gt; In article XVI, it was agreed that the governors general and all foreign-born officials of the exchanged territories, as long as they did not decide to remain, were removed from their offices.&lt;ref name=Jenssen167/&gt; Article XXI obliged the Danish administration to hand over all civilian and military administrative documents and archives concerning Norway.&lt;ref name=Jenssen168&gt;Jenssen-Tusch (1852), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

===The personal union of Sweden and Norway===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
{{main|Union between Sweden and Norway}}
[[File:Eidsvoll riksraad 1814.jpeg|300px|thumb|[[Constitution of Norway|Norwegian Constituent Assembly]] at [[Eidsvoll]], 1814.]]

On hearing news of the treaty, which became known through proclamation at the end of January, and published in Norwegian newspapers soon after, Norwegians were in disarray, and many called for arms, having beaten the Swedes only five years prior, in the 1809 campaign. A virtual independence movement had been established as early as 1810, and this movement gained momentum in the brooding situation. The Crown Prince of [[Denmark-Norway|Denmark and Norway]], [[Christian Frederik|Christian Frederick]], the resident viceroy in Norway, used this opportunity to intervene. He took the helm in the [[Norway in 1814|Norwegian independence movement]], most likely with the surreptitious goal of re-unification with Denmark. This was not in the interest of all Norwegians. In fact, the founders of the 1810 movement lobbied for an independent Norway. The initiative of Christian Frederick was successful, partly due to clandestine support from the Danish [[The Crown|Crown]], but also because it was supported by prominent and influential Norwegians. They convinced the Prince that it would be unwise to claim the throne as his inheritance. Instead they advised him to assume the regency and call an election of representatives to a constituent assembly.

On 10 April the national assembly met at [[Eidsvoll]] to decide on a [[Constitution of Norway|Constitution]]. Norway eventually declared independence on 17 May 1814, electing Christian Frederick as King. (The seventeenth of May is "Syttende mai" or [[Norwegian Constitution Day]] that is celebrated by Norwegians at home and abroad.)  This triggered [[Swedish-Norwegian War (1814)|a short war with Sweden]] in which Sweden's financial advantage proved too much to overcome.  Nevertheless, when cease-fire talks began, Bernadotte made an important concession—he accepted the newly adopted Norwegian constitution, thus giving up any claim that Norway was to be treated as merely a Swedish province.  In accordance with the [[Convention of Moss]], Norway agreed to enter [[union between Sweden and Norway|a personal union with Sweden]].  After having made the necessary amendments to the constitution, the Norwegian [[Storting]] on 4 November elected [[Charles XIII of Sweden]] as King of Norway, creating the [[union between Sweden and Norway]].

===Swedish Pomerania===
{{further|Congress of Vienna}}
[[File:Hardenberg.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Karl August von Hardenberg|Hardenberg]]]]

Due to the refusal of Norway to subordinate itself to the Swedish king, [[Charles XIII of Sweden]] did not hand over [[Swedish Pomerania]] to [[Frederick VI of Denmark]].&lt;ref name=Buesch104&gt;Büsch (1992), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was solved at the [[Congress of Vienna]], when the Great Powers followed a plan worked out by [[Karl August von Hardenberg]], [[Minister President of Prussia|prime minister of]] the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], who proposed a ring exchange of territories and payments between the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] (ruled in personal union with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]]), the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[Kingdom of Sweden]].&lt;ref name=Buesch104/&gt;

According to Hardenberg's plan, Prussia ceded [[East Frisia]] with [[Emden]] to Hanover, and in exchange received from Hanover the [[Duchy of Lauenburg]].&lt;ref name=Buesch104/&gt; This duchy was then handed over from Prussia to Denmark, along with an additional payment of 3.5 million [[Thaler|taler]]s.&lt;ref name=Buesch104/&gt; Prussia also took over a Danish debt to Sweden of 600,000 talers, and agreed on an additional payment of 2 million talers to Sweden.&lt;ref name=Buesch104/&gt; Denmark and Sweden in turn relinquished their claims to Swedish Pomerania in favour of Prussia.&lt;ref name=Buesch104/&gt; Charles XIII of Sweden then released his Pomeranian subjects from their obligations towards Sweden on 1 October 1815, and on 23 October the province was handed over to von Ingersleben, president of [[Province of Pomerania (1653–1815)|Prussian Pomerania]].&lt;ref name=Buesch104/&gt;

===East Greenland case===
[[File:EricTheRedsLand-no.PNG|thumb|150px|[[Eirik Raudes Land|Eirik Raudes (Erik the Red's) Land]] (blue)]]

Between 1931 and 1933, Norway contested the Danish possession of all of Greenland at the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] in [[The Hague]].&lt;ref name=Cavell433 /&gt; {{As of|2008|12}}, this was the only case where possession of a polar territory was ever decided by an international court.&lt;ref name=Cavell433 /&gt;

The Norwegian side argued that Denmark did not hold rights to any part of the island where she did not exact actual sovereignty, and accordingly proclaimed a Norwegian [[Eirik Raudes Land]] in eastern Greenland on 10 July 1931, which had been occupied in the previous month.&lt;ref name=Cavell434&gt;Cavell (2008), p. 434&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 April 1933 however, the court ruled that on the basis of the Treaty of Kiel and subsequent treaties, Denmark was the sovereign over the whole of Greenland.&lt;ref name=Cavell434/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dörr (2004), pp. 103ff&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tyrer v. the United Kingdom''''' (application No. 5856/72) was a case decided by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 1978.

==Facts==

Mr Tyrer, then aged 15, was given [[birching|three strokes of the birch]] in 1972 in the [[Isle of Man]], according to the local juvenile court's sentence for unlawful assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Birching was conducted by policemen in private, in the presence of Tyrer's father and a doctor; Tyrer was made to take down his trousers and underpants and bend over a table.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=695464&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR Judgment in case Tyrer v. the United Kingdom, Para. 9-10]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==

By a majority of six votes to one, the Court held Tyrer's birching to constitute degrading treatment contrary to the Article 3 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. Significant conclusions of the case included that "the Convention is a living instrument which, as the Commission rightly stressed, must be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions. In the case now before it the Court cannot but be influenced by the developments and commonly accepted standards in the penal policy of the member States of the [[Council of Europe]] in this field".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=695464&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR Judgment in case Tyrer v. the United Kingdom, Para. 31]&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge [[Gerald Fitzmaurice]] has [[Dissenting opinion|dissented]], finding no violation of Article 3 and concerning that the Court's conclusion "amounts to a finding that all corporal punishment, in all circumstances, inherently involves, as such, an unacceptable level of degradation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=695464&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR Judgment in case Tyrer v. the United Kingdom, separate opinion of Sir Gerard Fitzmaurice, Para. 7]&lt;/ref&gt; and that "assuming that corporal punishment does involve some degree of degradation, it has never been seen as doing so for a juvenile to anything approaching the same manner or extent as for an adult" &lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=695464&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR Judgment in case Tyrer v. the United Kingdom, separate opinion of Sir Gerard Fitzmaurice, Para. 11]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

The judgment was considered 'landmark' by [[Manfred Nowak]], UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/10session/A.HRC.10.44AEV.pdf Report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment A/HRC/10/44 Para. 35]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Uniting American Families Act''' ('''UAFA''', {{USBill|113|H.R.|519}}, {{USBill|113|S.|296}}) is a [[United States|U.S.]] bill to amend the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] to eliminate [[discrimination]] in immigration by permitting [[#Definitions of Permanent Partner and Permanent Partnership|permanent partners]] of United States citizens and of lawful [[permanent resident]]s to obtain lawful permanent resident status in the same manner as spouses of citizens and of lawful permanent residents and to penalize immigration fraud in connection with [[#Definitions of Permanent Partner and Permanent Partnership|permanent partnerships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|113|H.R.|519}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|113|S.|296}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the partnership ends within two years, the sponsored partner's immigrant status would be subject to review.&lt;ref name="gaylesbiantimes1"/&gt;

Beginning in the 111th Congress, the full text of UAFA, further expanded to provide rights to the children or stepchildren of the foreign-born partner, has been included as Title II of the [[Reuniting Families Act]] ({{USBill|113|H.R.|717}}), an immigration reform bill, last introduced in the United States House of Representatives on February 14, 2013, by [[California]] Congressman [[Michael Honda]] (D-CA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://honda.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=90&amp;Itemid=76], Title II - Uniting American Families Act.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|113|H.R.|717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UAFA was introduced on February 13, 2013, in the [[United States Senate]] by [[Vermont]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Patrick Leahy]] (D-VT)&lt;ref&gt;Senator Patrick Leahy (February 13, 2013).[http://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/leahy-and-collins-introduce-bipartisan-uniting-american-families-act] Press Release.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[United States House of Representatives]] by [[New York (state)|New York]] [[United States Congress|Congressman]] [[Jerrold Nadler]] (D-NY).&lt;ref&gt;Representative Jerrold Nadler (February 5, 2013). [http://nadler.house.gov/press-release/momentum-comprehensive-immigration-reform-grows-nadler-and-bipartisan-coalition] Press Release.&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate version has 29 cosponsors.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Senate. 113th Congress, 1st Session. op. cit., see Cosponsors.&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate legislation has been referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s113-296&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the cosponsors are Democrats and there is little Republican support for the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;''National Journal'': [http://www.nationaljournal.com/njonline/no_20100113_1390.php David Gauvey Herbert, "Uniting American Families Act," October 27, 2010], accessed March 5, 2012
&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 bill was cosponsored by Republican Congressmen [[Charlie Dent]] and [[Richard L. Hanna]].

There are an estimated 36,000 same-sex binational couples in 2000, according to the Census, who could benefit from this act.&lt;ref name="gaylesbiantimes1"&gt;http://www.gaylesbiantimes.com/?id=5331&amp;issue=915&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions of Permanent Partner and Permanent Partnership ==
UAFA includes the following definitions:&lt;ref&gt;U.S. House. 113th Congress, 1st Session. op. cit., see Text of Legislation, Sec. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The term "permanent partner" means an individual 18 years of age or older who--

:(A) is in a committed, intimate relationship with another individual 18 years of age or older in which both parties intend a lifelong commitment;

:(B) is financially interdependent with that other individual;

:(C) is not married to or in a permanent partnership with anyone other than that other individual;

:(D) is unable to contract with that other individual a marriage cognizable under this Act; and

:(E) is not a first, second, or third degree blood relation of that other individual.

The term "permanent partnership" means the relationship that exists between two permanent partners.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the House of Representatives the bill was referred to the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-1024&lt;/ref&gt; This subcommittee has sixteen members including the Chairman [[Zoe Lofgren]] (D-CA) and ranking member Representative [[Steve King]] (R-IA). The subcommittee consists of representatives from the states of California, Texas, Illinois, Utah, Iowa, Mississippi, New York and Resident Commissioner [[Pedro Pierluisi]] (D) from Puerto Rico. The subcommittee has six Republicans and ten Democrats on board.&lt;ref&gt;http://judiciary.house.gov/about/subimmigration.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Senate the bill was referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary which consists of nineteen members which includes Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT) who re-introduced the bill and Ranking Member Senator [[Jefferson Sessions]] (R-AL). The committee consists of seven Republican Senators and twelve Democratic Senators. The Representatives on the committee come from seventeen different states; this differs vastly from the subcommittee to which the House of Representatives bill has been referred to.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.govtrack.us/congress/committee.xpd?id=SSJU&lt;/ref&gt; Senator Patrick Leahy held a hearing on the bill on June 3, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=3876&lt;/ref&gt; The hearing was the first-ever hearing on the Uniting American Families Act. In the opinion of the national organization, Immigration Equality, the hearing was a fundamental and important first step for bringing UAFA into comprehensive immigration reform.&lt;ref&gt;http://immigrationequality.org/blog/?p=904&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, 2009, Congressman [[Luis Gutiérrez]] (D-IL) introduced his comprehensive immigration reform bill, H.R. 4321, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform for America's Security and Prosperity Act of 2009 (CIR ASAP Act). Initially, it did not include UAFA, which upset many gay rights activists.&lt;ref name="lawrence1"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/apr/16/us-immigration-gay-rights | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=US immigration's gay rights divide | first=Stewart J | last=Lawrence | date=April 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on July 15, 2010, Congressman Gutiérrez announced, "provisions of UAFA must be part of any comprehensive immigration reform bill."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gutierrez.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=600:rep-gutierrez-uafa-provisions-must-be-part-of-any-comprehensive-immigration-reform-bill&amp;catid=43:2010-press-releases&lt;/ref&gt; Senator Charles Schumer wrote a letter to his LGBT constituency in March 2010 indicating that he is currently working with colleagues of both parties to work on comprehensive immigration reform. This comprehensive immigration reform, which in Senator Schumer's mind is more effective than "piecemeal legislation", will address the issue in the Uniting American Families Act.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/03/18/Schumer_Signals_UAFA_Inclusion/&lt;/ref&gt; An important political issue with UAFA revolves around the principle of family reunification; many conservatives do not want to be seen as anti-family reunification, especially with the growing Latino voter base.&lt;ref name="lawrence1"/&gt; Of note, is the fact that forty percent of LGBT binational couples in the United States include a Latino family member.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/04/29/Arizona_Law_Bad_for_Gay_Binational_Couples/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of [[Obergefell v. Hodges]] Supreme Court decision==

In response to [[Obergefell v. Hodges]] Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano issued a statement on July 1, 2013 clarifying that LGBT spouses and fiancés would henceforth be treated the same as heterosexual couples for immigration purposes.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uscis.gov/family/same-sex-marriages&lt;/ref&gt; This eliminated the need for a stand alone bill.

==Support for Uniting American Families Act==

The support for the Uniting American Families Act has increased in the House of Representatives, but much less so in the Senate.&lt;ref name="gaylesbiantimes1"/&gt; Organizations such as the [[Human Rights Campaign]] (HRC) and Immigration Equality, both supporters of LGBT rights legislation, support the bill. The HRC points out that the process for sponsoring a partner will have the same requirements that opposite-sex couples face. HRC also reports that 22 countries recognize same-sex couples under immigration law, including France, Germany, Israel, and the United Kingdom, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Campaign: [http://www.hrc.org/files/images/blog/2009/06/uafa_talking_points.pdf "Talking Points: The Uniting American Families Act"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725101446/http://www.hrc.org/files/images/blog/2009/06/uafa_talking_points.pdf |date=July 25, 2012 }}, accessed March 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] wrote in a letter of support for UAFA to senators that the bill does not provide special benefits for same-sex couples, but provides equal sponsorship. The ACLU also mentions that the bill follows traditional family reunification principles in immigration law that are already commonplace in various countries.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights_hiv-aids/aclu-letter-senate-united-american-families-act&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund]] (MALDEF) supports UAFA and asks that comprehensive immigration reform include lesbian and gay immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sdgln.com/causes/2010/02/05/thomas-saenz-president-maldef-creating-change&lt;/ref&gt;

Several corporations and organizations, such as [[Intel Corporation]] and the [[Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union]], have expressed support for the bill.&lt;ref name="gaylesbiantimes1"/&gt; The Immigration Equality website has a list of organizations, labor unions, civil rights groups, religious institutions, and businesses that support the bill including Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, League of United Latin American Citizens, American Bar Association, American Airlines and the American Jewish Committee.&lt;ref&gt;http://immigrationequalityactionfund.org/legislation/endorsements/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to Uniting American Families Act==

Opponents believe that UAFA could open up the doors for [[immigration fraud|Illegal immigration]] even though it would penalize those who attempt to evade immigration law. They believe that it will be hard for immigration officers to actually determine whether the partnership is long-term and permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/03/us/politics/03immig.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Bill Proposes Immigration Rights for Gay Couples | first=Julia | last=Preston | date=June 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Center for Immigration Studies]] does not support the bill because, in their opinion, it does not provide a reliable measure for indicating who is in a long-term committed partnership.&lt;ref name="edgeboston1"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.edgeboston.com/index.php?ch=news&amp;sc=&amp;sc2=news&amp;sc3=&amp;id=92059 | work=Edge Boston| title=Effort to Include Gay Partners Threatens Immigration Bill | first=Kilian | last=Melloy | date=June 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While previously supporting family reunification legislation, such as H.R. 6638, the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] does not support the inclusion of the Uniting American Families Act in a larger bill or standing on its own.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usccb.org/comm/archives/2009/09-122.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference's (NHCLC) leader Reverend Samuel Rodriguez predicts that the wide and strong support that the NHCLC has garnered for comprehensive immigration reform will be lost if same-sex couples are to benefit from the reform.&lt;ref name="edgeboston1"/&gt;

[[Roy Beck]], the founder and CEO of [[NumbersUSA]], an which works for lower immigration levels, opposed the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.numbersusa.com/content/nusablog/beckr/june-2-2009/my-testimony-today-senate-judiciary-committee-asks-decisions-be-made-nati | work=Numbers USA | title=My Testimony Today to Senate Judiciary Committee Asks Decisions Be Made In National Interest -- Not For Special Interests | first=Roy | last=Beck | date=June 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coverage of different-sex couples==
The bill's language applies only to applicable LGBT individuals and excludes different-sex couples from becoming permanent partners under its provisions.&lt;ref name="carraher"&gt;Timothy R. Carraher, "Some Suggestions for the UAFA: A Bill for Same-Sex Binational Couples," ''Northwestern Journal of Law and Social Policy'', vol. 4 (Winter 2009), [http://www.law.northwestern.edu/journals/NJLSP/v4/n1/9/9Carraher.pdf available online], accessed March 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex couples with valid marriage certificates are prohibited from being considered "married" under this act and can only apply for visas as permanent partners. Due to the inability to be recognized as married partners under this act, the act then allows individuals who have had the opportunity in other states and countries to be married, but have chosen not to, the same immigration rights as those who have pursued marriage.&lt;ref name="carraher"/&gt;

Although the bill is designed to align the rights of same-sex couples with those of different-sex couples, binational same-sex couples are unlikely to resemble different-sex couples. This could be due to international immigration law, especially in the case of financial interdependence if certain countries require finances to be kept separate in these cases, thus already excluding some couples and asking more than what different-sex couples must prove.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In 1985, a raid took place at a laboratory belonging to the [[University of California, Riverside]] (UCR) that resulted in the removal of a monkey by the [[Animal Liberation Front]]. This monkey, called '''Britches''' (born March 1985), was a [[stump-tailed macaque]] who was born into a breeding colony at UCR. He was removed from his mother at birth, had his eyelids sewn shut, and had an electronic [[sonar]] device attached to his head—a Trisensor Aid, an experimental version of a blind travel aid, the Sonicguide—as part of a three-year sensory-deprivation study involving 24 infant monkeys.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Ingrid Newkirk|Newkirk, Ingrid]].

Three animals were born in the dark and raised without vision for 1 to 3 months while wearing either the Binaural Sensory Aid (Animal 1; Kay, 1974) or the Trisensor (Animals 2 and 3; Easton &amp; Jackson, 1983) airborne sonars. Each animal demonstrated alertness to information transmitted by the devices in spontaneous reaching or reinforced discrimination tasks, and more device-related, perceptual-motor activities were observed when the sensors were switched on than when they were switched off. The results show that neonate monkeys can learn effective use of information obtained from sensory substitution devices through unstructured interaction with the environment.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071109171930/http://nzsm.webcentre.co.nz/article1154.htm ''Seeing with Sound'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Acting on a tip-off from a student, the ALF removed Britches from the laboratory on April 20, 1985, when he was five weeks old.&lt;ref name=video/&gt; The raid also saw the release of 467 mice, cats, opossums, pigeons, rabbits, and rats, and a reported $700,000-worth of damage to equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Ben A.

The ALF handed the video of their raid over to [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA), which released it.&lt;!--As a result of the ensuing publicity, eight of the 17 studies interrupted by the raid were not restarted, and the university stopped allowing infant monkeys' eyes to be sewn shut, according to reports filed by the university with the government.&lt;ref&gt;Newkirk, Ingrid.

The study was conducted by psychologist David H. Warren.&lt;ref name=abstract&gt;[http://crisp.cit.nih.gov/crisp/CRISP_LIB.getdoc?textkey=4115929&amp;p_grant_num=1R01EY005224-01&amp;p_query=&amp;ticket=41457670&amp;p_audit_session_id=253657531&amp;p_keywords= "Abstract: Trisensor rearing with infant macaques"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206182035/http://crisp.cit.nih.gov/crisp/CRISP_LIB.getdoc?textkey=4115929&amp;p_grant_num=1R01EY005224-01&amp;p_query=&amp;ticket=41457670&amp;p_audit_session_id=253657531&amp;p_keywords= |date=2008-12-06 }}, Crisp.&lt;/ref&gt; Five groups of four macaques were to be raised from birth to three months, and one group to six months, blinded while wearing a Trisensor Aid. Other control groups were to wear the device with normal vision, or wear a dummy device with no vision. At the end of the experiment, the monkeys were to be euthanized, and the visual, auditory and motor areas in their brains would be studied.&lt;ref name=abstract/&gt;

According to PETA's president [[Ingrid Newkirk]], based on papers found in the lab by the ALF, the UCR researchers wrote that performing the study by artificially blinding the monkeys was necessary because there were insufficient numbers of blind human infants within driving distance of Riverside. The researchers did not want to conduct the study in the homes of blind children because of the difficulty of carrying out the research amid routine household chores, according to Newkirk.&lt;ref name="Newkirk, Ingrid 2000, p. 288"&gt;Newkirk, Ingrid. ''Free the Animals'', Lantern Books, 2000, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The raid ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Britches.jpg|left|thumb|120px|After the bandages were removed]] --&gt;
Newkirk writes that the ALF was alerted to the laboratory's work by a student who had reported the Britches' situation to [[Last Chance for Animals]]. An ALF contact volunteering there heard the complaint, and approached the student for more information.&lt;ref&gt;Newkirk, Ingrid. ''Free the Animals'', Lantern Books, 2000, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 21, 1985, ALF activists, including Sally S, a businesswoman in her mid-30s,&lt;ref&gt;Steinbach, Alice. "Whose Life is more Important: An Animal's or a Child's," ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour magazine]]'', 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; broke into the laboratory and removed Britches along with around 467 other animals, taking footage of the raid, which they handed anonymously to PETA.&lt;ref&gt;
*"NIH reauthorization and protection of health facilities;: Hearings before the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment of the Committee on Energy and Commerce," Washington 1991, reported that 468 were taken: one monkey, nine opossums, 24 cats, 31 pigeons, 41 rabbits, 56 rats, and 306 mice.
*The ''Chicago Tribune'' initially reported that 260 animals had been taken (April 21, 1985, p. 20.), later reporting 467 (April 28, 1985).
*''The New York Times'' reported 460 (Franklin, Ben A. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DD1138F933A0575BC0A961948260 " Going to Extremes for 'Animal Rights'"], ''The New York Times'', August 30, 1987).
*[[Deborah Blum]] reported 460 (Blum, Deborah. ''The Monkey Wars'', Oxford University Press, 1994, p. 116).&lt;/ref&gt;

Activists say they found Britches, who was given his name by the researchers, alone in a cage with bandages around his eyes and a sonar device attached to his head. The device emitted a high-pitched noise every few minutes. He was clinging to a device covered in towelling that had two fake nipples attached, apparently intended to serve as a [[surrogate mother]]. He was handed to an ALF volunteer, a woman, who drove him from California to Utah, where he was examined by a retired pediatrician. According to UCR officials, the ALF also smashed equipment resulting in nearly $700,000-worth of damage. Theodore Hullar, UCR's executive vice chancellor, said the researchers' work had been set back years.&lt;ref&gt;"Raid on animal lab 'sets back' research", ''Chicago Tribune'', Apr 22, 1985, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical report===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Britches after suture removal.jpg|right|120px|thumb|After the sutures were removed]] --&gt;
Veterinarian [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] [[Ned Buyukmihci]] of the [[University of California, Davis]], and founder of Veterinarians for Animal Rights, said after he examined Britches that the sutures used were too large, the monkey's eye pads were dirty, and that, in his view, there was no justification for what he called a sloppy, painful experiment.&lt;ref name=video/&gt; Bettina Flavioli, a retired pediatrician, also examined the monkey and recorded a report:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Attached to infant's head by means of bandage and tape is an apparatus of some sort with what appears to be some sort of electrical cord extending from it. It has been cut. Bilaterally are short lengths of tubing emerging from the bandage. Tape is in direct contact with the face and neck. Bandage lifted rostrally from right eye due to excessive moisture and right eye partially visible.

&lt;p&gt;Beneath the bandages are two cotton pads, one for each eye ... Both pads are filthy and soaked with moisture. Bilaterally upper eyelids are sutured to lower eyelids. The sutures are grossly oversized for the purpose intended. Many of these sutures have torn through lid tissue resulting in multiple lacerations of the lids. There is an open space between upper and lower lids of both eyes of about one quarter inch, and sutures are contacting [[cornea]]l tissue resulting in excessive tearing ...&lt;/p&gt;

Infant demonstrates [[photophobia]]. Penis of infant is [[edema]]tous and inflamed. There are [[smegma]] accumulations. Generalized muscle development poor. Skin dry. Body odor foul."&lt;ref name=video/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reaction==

PETA released a film called ''Britches'' that included footage from the raid and the ALF's treatment of the monkey afterwards.&lt;ref name=video&gt;"The Story of Britches", film produced by PETA using the ALF footage, Google video, accessed 11 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Norm Phelps|Phelps, Norm]]. ''The Longest Struggle: Animal Advocacy from Pythagoras to PETA''.  Lantern Books, 2007, p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; The film prompted criticism of the experiments from other scientists and the [[American Council of the Blind]], with Dr. Grant Mack, president of the Council, calling it "one of the most repugnant and ill-conceived [[Boondoggle (project)|boondoggles]] that I've heard about for a long time."&lt;ref&gt;Newkirk, Ingrid. ''Free the Animals'', Lantern Books, 2000, p. 288, 294. Also see Best, Steven &amp; Nocella, Anthony J. ''Terrorist or Freedom Fighters? Reflections on the Liberation of Animals''. Lantern Books, 2004, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

A UCR spokesman said allegations of animal mistreatment were "absolutely false," and that there would be long-term damage to some of the research projects.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; Researchers alleged that activists had applied black paint or mascara to the monkey's eyelids to make the [[Surgical suture|sutures]] look larger than they were, and that damage reported by an ALF veterinarian to the eyelids had been caused by the veterinarian himself. The researchers also said that the Trisensor Aid had been removed and reattached by the ALF.&lt;ref name="Newkirk, Ingrid 2000, p. 288" /&gt;

The raid prompted the head of the [[National Institutes of Health]] to say that thefts of laboratory animals by animal rights groups could be considered acts of terrorism, and may require enactment of federal laws.&lt;ref&gt;"Crackdown urged in animal thefts", ''Chicago Tribune'', April 26, 1985, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Sally Sperling, a psychologist working in the lab that was raided, told the [[American Psychological Association]]'s ''Monitor on Psychology'': "I can't describe in detail how [the lab] looked when I first saw it after the crime—the images are etched into my mind with acid ... My lab was my haven and refuge for eighteen years. Even when my experiment wasn't going well or the equipment was acting up, I wanted to be in my lab and missed it badly when I wasn't there. Now, I barely can make myself open the door."&lt;ref&gt;Sperling, Sally. ''Monitor on Psychology'' cited in Newkirk 2000, pp. 290–291.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the ensuing publicity, eight of the 17 studies interrupted by the raid were not restarted, and the university stopped allowing infant monkeys' eyes to be sewn shut, according to reports filed by the university with the government.&lt;ref&gt;Newkirk, Ingrid. ''Free the Animals'', Lantern Books, 2000, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Best22&gt;[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]] &amp; Nocella, Anthony J. ''Terrorist or Freedom Fighters?

Several '''[[Native American tribe]]s''' within the [[United States]] register [[motor vehicle]]s and issue '''[[Vehicle registration plate|license plates]]''' to those vehicles.

The legal status of these plates varies by tribe, with some being recognized by the federal government and others not. Some nations issue plates for both tribal and personal vehicles, while others issue plates only for official tribal vehicles.

Some nations' plates indicate the [[U.S. state]] with which they are most closely associated, while others do not. This variation may even exist among the nations associated with one particular state.

Federally recognized tribes may also lease vehicles through the United States [[General Services Administration]] under certain circumstances. Such vehicles carry U.S. Government license plates.
