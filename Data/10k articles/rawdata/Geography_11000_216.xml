'''Abu Zayd Ahmed ibn Sahl Balkhi''' ({{lang-fa|ابو زید احمد بن سهل بلخی}}) was a [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Muslim]] [[polymath]]: a [[Islamic geography|geographer]], [[Islamic mathematics|mathematician]], [[Islamic medicine|physician]], [[Islamic psychological thought|psychologist]] and [[Islamic science|scientist]]. Born in 850 CE in Shamistiyan, in the province of [[Balkh]], [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] (in modern-day [[Afghanistan]]), he was a disciple of [[al-Kindi]]. He was also the founder the "Balkhī school" of terrestrial mapping in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name = E61-3/&gt;

==Works==
Of the many books ascribed to him in the ''al-Fihrist'' by [[Ibn al-Nadim]], one can note ''the excellency of mathematics''; ''on certitude in astrology''. His ''Figures of the Climates'' (''Suwar al-aqalim'') consisted chiefly of geographical maps. He also wrote the medical and psychological work, ''Masalih al-Abdan wa al-Anfus'' (''Sustenance for Body and Soul'').

A modern scholar describes the bulk of his works as "more than sixty books and manuscripts, meticulously researching disciplines as varied in scope as geography, medicine, theology, politics, philosophy, poetry, literature, Arabic grammar, astrology, astronomy, mathematics, biography, ethics, sociology as well as others."&lt;ref&gt;Malik Badri, ''Abu Zayd al-Balkhi’s Sustenance of the Soul: The Cognitive Behavior Therapy of a Ninth Century Physician'', International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT) (2013), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Figures of the Regions''==
His ''Figures of the Regions'' (''Suwar al-aqalim'') consisted chiefly of [[Islamic geography|geographical]] maps. It led to him founding the "Balkhī school" of terrestrial mapping in [[Baghdad]]. The geographers of this school also wrote extensively of the peoples, products, and customs of areas in the [[Muslim world]], with little interest in the non-Muslim realms.&lt;ref name = E61-3&gt;E. Edson and Emilie Savage-Smith, ''Medieval Views of the Cosmos'', pp. 61&amp;ndash;3, Bodleian Library, [[University of Oxford]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Sustenance for Body and Soul''==

===Mental health and mental illness===
In [[Islamic psychological thought|Islamic psychology]], the concepts of [[mental health]] and "mental hygiene" were introduced by Abu Zayd al-Balkhi, who often related it to [[spirit]]ual health. In his ''Masalih al-Abdan wa al-Anfus'' (''Sustenance for Body and Soul''), he was the first to successfully discuss diseases related to both the body and the soul. He used the term ''al-Tibb al-Ruhani'' to describe spiritual and psychological health, and the term ''Tibb al-Qalb'' to describe mental medicine. He criticized many medical doctors in his time for placing too much emphasis on physical [[illness]]es and neglecting the psychological or [[Mental disorder|mental illnesses]] of patients, and argued that "since man’s construction
is from both his soul and his body, therefore, human existence cannot be healthy without the ''ishtibak'' [interweaving or entangling] of soul and body." He further argued that "if the body gets sick, the
''nafs'' [psyche] loses much of its [[cognitive]] and comprehensive ability and fails to enjoy the desirous aspects of life" and that "if the ''nafs'' gets sick, the body may also find no joy in life and may eventually
develop a physical illness." Al-Balkhi traced back his ideas on mental health to verses of the [[Qur'an]] and [[hadith]]s attributed to [[Muhammad]], such as:&lt;ref name=Talib&gt;Nurdeen Deuraseh and Mansor Abu Talib (2005), "Mental health in Islamic medical tradition", ''The International Medical Journal'' '''4''' (2), p. 76&amp;ndash;79.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"In their hearts is a disease." | [[Qur'an]] 2:10}}

{{quote|"Truly, in the body there is a morsel of flesh, and when it is corrupt the body is corrupt, and when it
is sound the body is sound. Truly, it is the ''qalb'' [heart]." | ''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]'', Kitab al-Iman}}

{{quote|"Verily Allah does not consider your appearances or your wealth in (appraising you) but He considers your hearts and your deeds." | ''[[Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal]]'', no. 8707}}

===Cognitive and medical psychology and cognitive therapy===
Abu Zayd al-Balkhi was the first to differentiate between [[neurosis]] and [[psychosis]], and the first to classify neurotic disorders and pioneer [[cognitive therapy]] in order to treat each of these classified disorders. He classified neurosis into four [[emotion]]al disorders: [[fear]] and [[anxiety]], [[anger]] and [[aggression]], [[sadness]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and [[Fixation (psychology)|obsession]]. He further classified three types of depression: [[Depression (mood)|normal depression]] or [[sadness]] (''huzn''), [[Endogeny|endogenous]] depression originating from within the body, and reactive [[clinical depression]] originating from outside the body. He also wrote that a healthy individual should always keep healthy [[thoughts]] and feelings in his mind in the case of unexpected emotional outbursts in the same way [[drug]]s and [[First Aid]] medicine are kept nearby for unexpected physical [[Emergency|emergencies]]. He stated that a balance between the [[mind]] and [[Human body|body]] is required for good health and that an imbalance between the two can cause sickness. Al-Balkhi also introduced the concept of [[reciprocal inhibition]] (''al-ilaj bi al-did''), which was re-introduced over a thousand years later by [[Joseph Wolpe]] in 1969.&lt;ref name=Amber&gt;Amber Haque (2004), "Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists", ''Journal of Religion and Health'' '''43''' (4): 357&amp;ndash;377 [362]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychophysiology and psychosomatic medicine===
The Muslim physician Abu Zayd al-Balkhi was a pioneer of psychotherapy, [[psychophysiology]] and [[psychosomatic medicine]]. He recognized that the [[Human body|body]] and the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] can be healthy or sick, or "balanced or imbalanced", and that mental illness can have both [[psychological]] and/or [[physiological]] causes. He wrote that imbalance of the body can result in [[fever]], [[headache]]s and other physical illnesses, while imbalance of the soul can result in [[anger]], [[anxiety]], [[sadness]] and other mental symptoms. He recognized two types of [[Depression (mood)|depression]]: one caused by known reasons such as [[Grief|loss]] or [[failure]], which can be treated psychologically through both external methods (such as persuasive talking, preaching and advising) and internal methods (such as the "development of inner thoughts and cognitions which help the person get rid of his depressive condition"); and the other caused by unknown reasons such as a "sudden affliction of sorrow and distress, which persists all the time, preventing the afflicted person from any physical activity or from showing any happiness or enjoying any of the pleasures" which may be caused by physiological reasons (such as impurity of the blood) and can be treated through physical medicine.&lt;ref name=Talib/&gt; He also wrote comparisons between [[physical disorder]]s with [[mental disorder]]s, and showed how psychosomatic disorders can be caused by certain interactions between them.&lt;ref name=Amber/&gt;

'''Al-Mas‘udi''' ({{lang-ar|أبو الحسن علي بن الحسين بن علي المسعودي}}, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Abu al-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn al-Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī al-Masʿūdī}}''; {{circa|lk=no|896}}–956) was an [[Historiography of early Islam|Arab historian]], [[geographer]] and [[traveler]]. He is sometimes referred to as the "[[Herodotus]] of the Arabs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historyofislam.com/contents/the-classical-period/al-masudi/|title=Al Masudi|work=History of Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ter-Ghevondyan | first = Aram N. | authorlink = Aram Ter-Ghevondyan | title = Արաբական Ամիրայությունները Բագրատունյաց Հայաստանում (The Arab Emirates in Bagratuni Armenia) | publisher = [[Armenian Academy of Sciences]] | location= Yerevan, Armenian SSR | year = 1965 | page = 15 | isbn = |language=hy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Mas‘udi was one of the first to combine [[history]] and scientific [[geography]] in a large-scale work, ''[[The Meadows of Gold|The Meadows of Gold and Mines of Gems]]'' ({{lang-ar|مروج الذهب و معادن الجوهر}}, ''Muruj adh-dhahab wa ma'adin al-jawhar''), a world history. More generally, described as prolific and as a [[polymath]], he was the author of "over twenty" works, which dealt with "a wide variety of religious and secular subjects, including [[history]] (both Islamic and universal), [[geography]], the [[natural sciences]], [[philosophy]], and [[theology]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[John L. Esposito]] (ed.), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Islam'', Oxford University Press (2004), p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth, travels and literary output==
{{further|The Meadows of Gold}}
Apart from what Al-Mas‘udi's writes of himself little is known.  He had been born in [[Baghdad]] and was descended from [[Abd Allah ibn Mas'ud|Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud]], a companion of the Prophet [[Muhammad]].  He mentions the names of many scholar associates he met along his travels through many lands. The true extent of al-Mas‘udi's travels has met some skepticism, yet even conservative estimates hold it was considerable:

{{quotation|Al-Mas‘udi's travels actually occupied most of his life from at least 903/915 CE to very near the end of his life. His journeys took him to most of the [[Persia]]n provinces, [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and other regions of the [[Caspian Sea]]; as well as to [[Arabia]], [[Syria]] and Egypt. He also travelled to the [[Indus Valley]], and other parts of India, especially the western coast; and he voyaged more than once to East Africa. He also sailed on the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, the Mediterranean and the Caspian.&lt;ref&gt;Shboul, Ahmad A. M. ''Al-Mas'udi and His World''. London: Ithaca Press, 1979, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some biographies include [[Sri Lanka]] and [[China]] among his travels, but we also know that he received information on [[China]] from [[Abu Zaid al-Sirafi]] whom he met on the coast of the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref name="MG"&gt;[Mas‘udi. ''The Meadows of Gold, The Abbasids''. Transl. Paul Lunde and Caroline Stone, Kegan Paul. London and New York, 1989, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In Syria al-Mas‘udi met the Byzantine admiral convert-to-Islam, [[Leo of Tripoli]], from whom he presumably learned much about Byzantium. He spent his last years in [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]]. In Egypt he found a copy of a Frankish king list from [[Clovis I|Clovis]] to [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]] that had been written by an [[Andalusia]]n bishop.

Little is known of his means and funding of his extensive travels within and beyond the lands of Islam, and it has been speculated that like many travelers he may have been involved in trade.&lt;ref name="MG" /&gt;

Towards the end of ''The Meadows of Gold,'' al-Mas‘udi wrote:

{{quotation|The information we have gathered here is the fruit of long years of research and painful efforts of our voyages and journeys across the East and the West, and of the various nations that lie beyond the regions of [[Islam]]. The author of this work compares himself to a man who, having found pearls of all kinds and colours, gathers them together into a necklace and makes them into an ornament that its possessor guards with great care. My aim has been to trace the lands and the histories of many peoples, and I have no other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200502/the.model.of.the.historians.htm|title=Saudi Aramco World :         The Model of the Historians|work=saudiaramcoworld.com|access-date=2011-08-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103151420/http://saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200502/the.model.of.the.historians.htm|archive-date=2010-01-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

We know that al-Mas‘udi wrote a revised edition of ''Muruj adh-dhahab'' in 956 CE;&lt;ref&gt;Shboul. ''Al-Mas'udi and His World'', pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; however, only a draft version from 947 is extant.  Al-Mas‘udi in his ''Tanbih'' states that the revised edition of ''Muruj adh-dhahab'' contained 365 chapters.&lt;ref name="MG" /&gt;

==Al-Mas‘udi's intellectual environment==
Lunde and Stone provide a detailed reminder of the intellectual environment in which al-Mas‘udi lived:

{{quotation|He lived at a time when books were readily available and relatively cheap. Aside from large public libraries in major towns like Baghdad, many individuals, like Mas‘udi's friend al-Suli, had private libraries, often containing thousands of volumes. The prevalence of books and their low price was the result of the introduction of paper to the Islamic world by Chinese papermakers captured at the [[Battle of Talas]] in 751. Very soon afterwards there were paper mills in most large towns and cities. The introduction of paper coincided with the coming to power of the Abbasid dynasty, and there is no doubt that the availability of cheap writing material contributed to the growth of the Abbasid bureaucracy, postal system, and lively intellectual life.&lt;ref&gt;Mas'udi. ''The Meadows of Gold, The Abbasids'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

They note that Mas‘udi often encourages his readers to consult other books he has written, expecting these to be accessible to his readership. They also note the stark contrast between contemporary European conditions confronting say the author of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' and this highly literate Islamic world.

Ahmad Shboul mentions the rich blend of Greek philosophy, Persian literature, Indian mathematics and the rich heritage of the ancient cultures that went into the vigorous life of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Shboul. ''Al-Mas'udi and His World'', pp. 29ff.&lt;/ref&gt; This enabled the society of the day to manifest a knowledge seeking, perceptive and analytical attitude. There was a natural association of scholarly minded people in this highly civilized atmosphere, and al-Mas‘udi very much took part in this energizing activity.

Al-Mas‘udi was a pupil or junior colleague of a number of prominent intellectuals, including the philologists al-Zajjaj, [[ibn Duraid]], [[Niftawayh]] and ibn Anbari. He was acquainted with famous poets, including Kashajim, whom he probably met in [[Aleppo]]. He was well read in philosophy, knowing the works of [[al-Kindi]] and [[al-Razi]], the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] thought of [[al-Farabi]] and the [[Plato]]nic writings. Al-Mas‘udi's extant writings do not confirm his meeting with his contemporaries al-Razi and al-Farabi, however such meetings were highly likely. He does record his meeting with al-Farabi's pupil Yahya ibn Adi, of whom he spoke highly.

In addition he was familiar with the medical work of [[Galen]], with [[Ptolemaic astronomy]], with the geographical work of Marinus and with the studies of Islamic geographers and astronomers.

He indicates training in jurisprudence. He met a number of influential jurists and was aware of the work of others. Subki states that al-Mas‘udi was a student of ibn Surayj, the leading scholar of the [[Shafi'ite]] school. Al-Subki claimed he found al-Mas‘udi's notes of ibn Surayj's lectures. Al-Mas‘udi also met Shafi'ites during his stay in Egypt. He met [[Zahiri]]tes in Baghdad and [[Aleppo]] such as Ibn Jabir and Niftawayh; modern scholarship leans toward the view that Al-Mas‘udi was an adherent of the latter school.&lt;ref&gt;[[Devin J. Stewart]], "Muhammad b. Jarir al-Tabari's ''al-Bayan 'an Usul al-Ahkam'' and the Genre of Usul al-Fiqh in Ninth Century Baghdad," pg. 333. Taken from ''Abbasid Studies: Occasional Papers of the School of Abbasid Studies, Cambridge, 6–10 January 2002''. Edited by James Montgomery. [[Leuven]]: Peeters Publishers and the Department of Oriental Studies, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Mas‘udi knew leading [[Mu'tazili]]tes, including al-Jubba, al-Nawbakhti, ibn Abdak al-Jurjani and Abu'l Qasim al-Balkhi al-Ka'bi. He was also well acquainted with previous Mu'tazilite literature. His reasoning, his phraseology, his expressed high esteem for Mu'tazilities could suggest that he was one of their number. However, Shboul points out that his extant works do not specifically state that he was.

Al-Mas‘udi included the history of the ancient civilizations that had occupied the land upon which Islam later spread. He mentions the [[ancient Assyrians|Assyrians]], [[Babylonians]], Egyptians and Persians among others. He is also the only Arab historian to refer (albeit indirectly) to the kingdom of [[Urartu]], when he speaks about the wars between the Assyrians (led by the legendary Queen [[Semiramis]]) and [[Armenians]] (led by [[Ara the Beautiful]]).&lt;ref&gt;See {{hy icon}} Ter-Ghevondyan, Aram N. ""Արա և Շամիրամ" առասպելի մի արձագանքը արաբ պատմիչ Մասուդի մոտ" ("An Echo of the Legend of '[[Ara the Beautiful|Ara]] and [[Semiramis|Shamiram]]' Found with Arab Historian Masudi"). ''[[Patma-Banasirakan Handes]]''. № 4 (31), 1965, pp. 249–253. With Russian abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;

Persia was a vast empire with a history that was already ancient before the arrival of Islam. Al-Mas‘udi was aware of the influence of ancient Babylon on Persia. He had access to a wealth of translations by scholars such as [[Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa|ibn al-Muqaffa]] from [[Middle Persian]] into Arabic. In his travels he also personally consulted Persian scholars and [[Zoroastrian]] priests. He thus had access to much material, factual and mythical. Like all other Arabic historians he was unclear on the [[Achaemenid dynasty]], though he knew of Kurush ([[Cyrus the Great]]). He was much clearer on the more recent dynasties and his estimation of the time between [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Ardashir I|Ardashir]] is much more accurately depicted than it is in [[al-Tabari]].

His wide-ranging interests included the Greeks and the Romans. Again, like all other Arabic historians, he was unclear on Greece before the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] dynasty that produced [[Alexander the Great]]. He is aware that there were kings before this, but is unclear on their names and reigns. He also seems unfamiliar with such additional aspects of Greek political life as Athenian democratic institutions. The same holds for Rome prior to [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]. He is, though, the earliest extant Arabic author to mention the Roman founding myth of [[Romulus and Remus]].

In al-Mas‘udi's view the greatest contribution of the Greeks was philosophy. He was aware of the progression of Greek philosophy from the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratics]] onward.

He also was keenly interested in the earlier events of the Arabian peninsula. He knew this area had a long history. He was well-aware of the mixture of interesting facts in pre-Islamic times, in myths and controversial details from competing tribes and even referred to the similarity between some of this material and the legendary and story telling contributions of some [[Middle Persian]] and Indian books to the ''[[Thousand and One Nights]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Travels in lands beyond Islam==
[[File:Al Masudi's Map of the World.JPG|thumb|Al-Mas‘udi's atlas of the world (reversed on the N–S axis to compare with modern geographical maps).]]

[[Image:Vanilla plantation in wood dsc00190.jpg|thumb|upright|In the year 933 Al-Masudi mentions [[Muslim]] sailors, who call the [[Comoros]] islands: "The Perfume Islands" and sing of waves that break rhythmically along broad, pearl-sand beaches, the light breezes scented with [[vanilla]] and [[ylang-ylang]], a component in many perfumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199604/the.islands.of.the.moon.htm|title=Saudi Aramco World :         The Islands of the Moon|work=saudiaramcoworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Ahmad Shboul notes that al-Mas‘udi is distinguished above his contemporaries for the extent of his interest in and coverage of the non-Islamic lands and peoples of his day. Other authors, even Christians writing in Arabic in the Caliphate, had less to say about the [[Byzantine Empire]] than al-Mas‘udi. He also described the geography of many lands beyond the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], as well as the customs and religious beliefs of many peoples.

His normal inquiries of travelers and extensive reading of previous writers were supplemented in the case of [[History of India|India]] with his personal experiences in the western part of the subcontinent. He demonstrates a deep understanding of historical change, tracing current conditions to the unfolding of events over generations and centuries. He perceived the significance of interstate relations and of the interaction of [[Hindu–Islamic relations|Muslims and Hindus]] in the various states of the subcontinent.

He described previous [[List of rulers of China|rulers in China]], underlined the importance of the revolt by [[Huang Chao]] in the late [[Tang dynasty]], and mentioned, though less detailed than for India, Chinese beliefs. His brief portrayal of Southeast Asia stands out for its degree of accuracy and clarity. He surveyed the vast areas inhabited by [[Turkic peoples]], commenting on what had been the extensive authority of the [[Khaqan]], though this was no longer the case by al-Mas‘udi's time. He conveyed the great diversity of Turkic peoples, including the distinction between sedentary and nomadic Turks. He spoke of the significance of the [[Khazars]] and provided much fresh material on them.

His account of the [[Rus' (people)|Rus]] is an important early source for the study of [[History of Russia|Russian history]] and the [[history of Ukraine]]. Again, while he may have read such earlier Arabic authors as [[Ibn Khordadbeh]], [[Ibn al-Faqih]], [[ibn Rustah]] and [[Ibn Fadlan]], al-Mas‘udi presented most of his material based on his personal observations and contacts made while traveling. He informed the Arabic reader that the Rus were more than just a few traders. They were a diverse and varied collection of peoples. He noted their independent attitude, the absence of a strong central authority among them and [[Historical Slavic religion|their paganism]]. He was very well informed on Rus trade with the Byzantines and on the competence of the Rus in sailing merchant vessels and warships. He was aware that the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Caspian Sea]] are two separate bodies of water.

His ''Kuhsabin'' were probably [[Kashubians]].

Al-Mas'udi was also very well informed about [[Byzantine diplomacy|Byzantine affairs]], even internal political events and the unfolding of palace coups. He recorded the effect of the westward migration of various tribes upon the Byzantines, especially the invading [[Bulgars]]. He spoke of Byzantine relations with western Europe. And, of course, he was attentively interested in Byzantine-Islamic relations.

One example of Al-Mas‘udi's influence on Muslim knowledge of the [[History of the Byzantine Empire|Byzantine world]] is that the use of the name [[Istanbul]] (in place of [[Constantinople]]) can be traced to his writings during the year 947, centuries before the eventual Ottoman use of this term. He writes that the [[Greeks]] (i.e. the Byzantines of the tenth century) call it "the City" (''bulin'' in the [[Arabic script]], which lacks the letter p: so [[Medieval Greek|Greek]] ''polin''); "and when they wish to express that it is the capital of the Empire because of its greatness they say Istan Bulin. They do not call it Constantinople. It is only Arabs who so designate it".&lt;ref&gt;Companion to Historiography, ed Michael Bentley. Chapter 1; The Evolution of Two Asian Historiographical Traditions. Routledge Publishing. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; A present-day analogy would be the use of the phrases "I am going Downtown" or "I am going into the City" by those who live near say Chicago or London respectively.

He has some knowledge of other peoples of eastern and western Europe, even far away [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon England]]. He names it, though he is sketchy about it. He knows [[Paris]] as the [[Frankish Empire|Frankish]] capital. He obtained a copy of a [[list of Frankish rulers]] from [[Clovis I|Clovis]] to his own time.

Al-Mas‘udi's global interest included Africa. He was well aware of peoples in the eastern portion of the continent (mentioning interesting details of the [[Zanj]], for example). He knows less of West Africa, though he names such contemporary states as [[Zagawa]], Kawkaw and [[Ghana Empire|Ghana]]. He described the relations of African states with each other and with Islam. He provided material on the cultures and beliefs of non-Islamic Africans.

In general his surviving works reveal an intensely curious mind, a universalist eagerly acquiring as extensive a background of the entire world as possible. The geographical range of his material and the reach of his ever inquiring spirit is truly impressive.

==Al-Mas‘udi and the Abbasids==
Lunde and Stone have provided the English reader with a fluent translation of some three-quarters of al-Mas‘udi's material on the Abbasids from the ''Muruj al-dhahab''. This is in the form of more than two hundred passages, many of these containing amusing and informative anecdotes. The very first one recounts the meeting of al-Mansur and a blind poet unaware of the identity of his distinguished interlocutor. The poet on two separate occasions recites praise poems for the defeated [[Umayyads]] to the Abbasid caliph; al-Mansur good naturedly rewards him.

There is the tale (p.&amp;nbsp;28 ff.) of the arrow that landed at al-Mansur's feet with verses inscribed in each of the three feathers and along the shaft causing him to investigate the unjust imprisonment of a distinguished notable from Hamadan. There is the story of the singer Harun al-Rashid asks to keep singing until the caliph falls asleep. Then a handsome young man arrives, snatches the lute from the singer's hand and shows him how it really should be done. On awakening Harun is told of this and suggests his singer had a supernatural visitation. Al-Mas‘udi quotes the lines (five in English) of this remarkable song.

These anecdotes provide glimpses of other aspects of these prominent people, sharing, actually, greater realization of their humanity and the human concerns of their officials and ordinary subjects. One of the more interesting passages is the account of the symposium held at the home of [[Harun al-Rashid]]'s famous vizier [[Yahya the Barmakid]] on the topic of love. A dozen leading thinkers provide their definition of love and then a thirteenth, a Magian judge, speaks at greater length on that theme.

==''At-Tanbih wa-l-'Ishraf''==
Al-Mas‘udi also wrote the ''Kitab at-Tanbih wa-l-'Ishraf'' ({{lang|ar| كتاب التنبیه والأشراف}}), whose title translates to ''The Book of Admonition and Revision''. This work is an abridgment of the ''Muruj adh-Dhahab'' about one-fifth its length, though containing new material on the Byzantines. It was finished shortly before his death.

==Editions, translations and influence==
A complete French translation of ''The Meadows of Gold'' was published along with the Arabic text in Paris by the [[Societe Asiatique]] in nine volumes between 1861 and 1877. [[Barbier de Meynard]] and Pavet de Courteille were the French translators for this edition. A century later, between 1966 and 1974, [[Charles Pellat]] revised the Arabic text for a more accurate edition published in five volumes by the Universite Libanaise in Beirut. Pellat also began revising the French translation. Lunde and Stone's English translation of material on the Abbasids appeared in 1989.

Ahmad Shboul notes some of the impact the French translation had on European intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;Shboul.'' Al-Mas'udi and His World'', p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernest Renan]] compared al-Masudi to the second century A.D. Greek writer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]. Others compared the Arab author to the Roman writer [[Pliny the Elder]]. Even before al-Masudi's work was available in a European language, orientalists had compared him to [[Herodotus]], the ancient Greek historian called "The Father of History." Shboul finds such comparisons to the very best in Europe's Classical past very interesting.

== Reputation ==
Sunnis do not rely upon al-Mas‘udi due to his Shi‘i and Mu'tazili influences. For example, Ibn Hajar writes about al-Mas‘udi that "His books are imprecise because he was a Shi‘a, a Mu'tazili.".&lt;ref&gt;Lisan al-Mizan [258-256/4]&lt;/ref&gt; Adh-Dhahabi&lt;ref&gt;Siyar A'alam al-Nubala [Tabaqa al-'Ishroon / al-Mas'oodi]&lt;/ref&gt; and Taj al-Din as-Subki also confirmed that he was a Mu'tazili.&lt;ref&gt;Tabaqat al-Shafi'iyyah al-Kubra [Biography: 226]&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, he is considered to be of Shi‘i thought by the following:

* Aga Buzurg al-Tehrani in ''Mawsu'a al-Dhari'a ila Tasanif al-Shi'a''
* Isma'il al-Baghdadi in ''Hadya al-'Arifeen''
* Bahr al-'Uloom in ''al-Fawa'id al-Rijalia''
* Al-Hilli in ''Khulasa al-Aqwal''
* Al-Najashi in his book on Rijal
* Al-Tafrashi in ''Naqd al-Rijal''
* Al-'Amli in ''Amal al-Aamal''
* Al-Barujardi in ''Tara'if al-Maqal'' &lt;ref&gt;http://209.85.122.83/2505/29/0/p1006798/Tashreeh.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== His description of Sistan (Iran) ==
" ... is the land of winds and sand. There the wind drives mills and raises water from the streams, whereby gardens are irrigated. There is in the world, and God alone knows it, no place where more frequent use is made of the winds (947 AD.)".&lt;ref&gt;RJ Forbes. Studies in ancient technology. Vol. 9. Brill, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand Hungarian|Kaptárkő|date=August 2011}}
'''Beehive stones''' (''kaptárkő'') are eroded [[rhyolite]] cones up to 13&amp;nbsp;m high with rectangular "windows" carved into them, mainly found in the [[Bükk]] region of [[Hungary]]. The stones were originally formed by [[volcanic activity]] in the [[Miocene]] era. There are over 100 of these stones in Hungary and similar objects have been found in [[Iran]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Turkey]]. The origin or purpose of the carved windows is unclear, but the most widely supported view is that the carved compartments were used for [[beekeeping]].

'''British Cemetery Montevideo Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen''' contains information about servicemen of different nationalities whose tombs can be found within the Cemetery. 
A few of the ships mentioned are well known to the general public, such as {{ship|STV|Royston Grange}} or {{HMNZS|Achilles}}, which fought in the [[Battle of the River Plate]].

[[The British Cemetery Montevideo]] is included in the Roll of Honour and contains eight graves maintained by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]].

The '''Center for International Environmental Law''' ('''CIEL''') is a [[public interest]], [[not-for-profit]] environmental [[law firm]] founded in 1989 in the United States to strengthen [[international environmental law|international and comparative environmental law and policy]] around the world. With offices in [[Washington, DC]] and [[Geneva, Switzerland]], CIEL’s staff of international attorneys provide legal counsel and advocacy, policy research and capacity building in the areas of [[biodiversity]], [[chemicals]], [[climate change]], [[human rights]] and the environment, [[international financial institutions]], law and communities, and trade and sustainable development.

[[Carroll Muffett]] is the current president.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

==Mission statement==
The Center for International Environmental Law's (CIEL) mission is to use the power of law to protect the environment, promote human rights, and ensure a just and sustainable society.

==About CIEL==
CIEL is incorporated as a U.S. nonprofit organization designated by the IRS as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt charity.  CIEL meets the rigorous public accountability standards of the federal government’s Combined Federal Campaign, including by conducting an annual audit; completing a Form 990; and publishing an Annual Report made available to the public.  CIEL is governed by a nine person Board of Trustees that oversees the general policies, finances and operation of CIEL.

Since 1989, CIEL has worked not only to support communities and defend the environment in the face of looming threats, but to change the very system that gives rise to those threats. CIEL works creatively to build the legal levers for change that will be effective not only for CIEL and its partners, but for others far beyond CIEL’s reach.

==Goals==
CIEL's vision for the world is one where the law reflects the interconnection between humans and the environment, respects the limits of the planet, protects the dignity and equality of each person, and encourages all of earth’s inhabitants to live in balance with each other.  In every aspect of its work, CIEL promotes the rule of law; transparent, just and sustainable processes; balanced economic and political power that protects the rights of communities and the environment; democratic inclusion; intra and inter-generational equity; the interconnectedness of life on the planet; and the intrinsic value of nature and the inherent rights of species and ecosystems.

== Program areas ==
* Climate &amp; Energy
* Environmental Health
* People, Land, and Resources

==Internships and fellowships==
CIEL's intern/extern/fellowship program offers lawyers, law students and other exceptionally motivated students and graduates excellent opportunities to gain experience in the field of international environmental law.

Over its 20 years, CIEL has trained more than [http://ciel.org/Education_Training/Training_Statistics.html 350 interns from 53 countries], providing an important educational opportunity for lawyers in training. CIEL’s Intern Program trains new lawyers and law students by giving them the opportunity to work on cutting-edge international environmental issues in Washington and Geneva alongside and under the mentorship of CIEL’s experienced staff attorneys.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3986">'''Christian Sommerfeldt''' (6 January 1746 – 30 May 1811) was a Norwegian geographer and civil servant.

==Personal life==
He was born at Sukkestad in [[Østre Toten|Toten]] as a son of district stipendiary magistrate and chancellor councillor David Christian Sommerfelt (1717–1773) and Benedicte "Bente" Christine Hoff.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Christian Sommerfelt|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Arnfinn|last=Engen|volume=|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Christian_Sommerfelt/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather Christian Sommerfelt was also district stipendiary magistrate. His great-grandfather and uncle were both named Hans, and became priests. The latter worked in Denmark and became ancestor for a Danish family line. Christian Sommerfeldt became ancestor of a Norwegian branch of Sommerfeldts, and so did his brother [[Ole Hannibal Sommerfeldt|Ole Hannibal]].&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Sommerfeldt|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=|publisher=|location=|url=http://www.snl.no/Sommerfeldt|language=Norwegian|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through his sister Maria he was an uncle of [[Lauritz Weidemann]].&lt;ref name=nbl-lw&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Lauritz Weidemann |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Gustav |last=Sætra |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Lauritz_Weidemann/utdypning |language=Norwegian|accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Sommerfeldt was married twice. First he married vicar's daughter Karen Magdalena Mandahl (1764–1791) in March 1784 in [[Land, Norway|Land]]. After her death, in May 1793 in [[Oslo|Christiania]] he married stipendiary magistrate's daughter Anna Sophia Hagerup (1775–1821).&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; Their son [[Søren Christian Sommerfelt]] was a priest and botanist.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

==Career==
Sommerfeldt grew up at Sukkestad, and enrolled at the [[University of Copenhagen]] at the age of thirteen. He finished his theological studies at the age of twenty before studying geography and history at [[Sorø Academy]]. In 1776 he published the two textbooks ''Geographie til Ungdommens Brug'' and ''Kort Udtog af Geographien til Begynderes Bedste'', which both came in six editions. He was offered to succeed [[Gerhard Schøning]] as professor in these subjects, but instead shifted his academic field again, to practical agriculture and national economy.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

In 1776 he entered the Danish civil service. In 1779 he was promoted to chamber councillor ({{lang-da|Kammerråd}}). In 1781 he was appointed as [[List of County Governors of Oppland|County Governor of Christians Amt]], which he remained until his death in 1811.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He resided at Sukkestad. In his position, he continued his endeavor for improving practical agriculture, forestry, and other rural enterprise in [[Oppland|Christians Amt]]. He collected data from his county, and based on this data he published ''Efterretninger angaaende Christians amt'' in 1790. After the [[topography|topographical]] society ''Topographisk Selskab for Norge''  was published in 1791 and started the journal ''Topographisk Journal for Norge'', his text was reprinted there.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

'''EgyptSat 2''' also called (MisrSat 2) is [[Egypt]]'s second [[remote sensing]] [[satellite|Earth observation satellite]] built by the Russian ''[[S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia|RSC Energia]]'' and the Egyptian ''[[National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences|NARSS]]'' while the incorporated cameras and payload was developed by ''OAO Peleng'' and ''NIRUP Geoinformatsionnye Sistemy'' in Belarus.&lt;ref name="gunter" /&gt;&lt;ref name=rsw /&gt;

A frameless spacecraft had been utilized in EgyptSat 2, as it is an innovative technology being first time used in Russia.&lt;ref name=rostec&gt;{{cite web|title=Technology has helped reduce satellite assembly time|url=http://rostec.ru/en/news/4513234|website=Rostec|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rt&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:«РТ-Химкомпозит» сократил срок сборки космических аппаратов|url=http://rt-chemcomposite.ru/novosti/2185/?sphrase_id=2057|website=РТ-Химкомпозит|accessdate=29 September 2014|date=18 April 2014|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EgyptSat 2 was launched on board a [[Soyuz-U]] rocket on 16 April 2014 from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]]&lt;ref name=a2&gt;{{cite web|title=Egyptian reconnaissance satellite launched by Soyuz|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1404/16egyptsat2/#.U1qwGFWSyT5|work=spaceflightnow|accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was a milestone toward establishing the Egyptian Space Agency.&lt;ref name=a3&gt;{{cite web|title=Egyptsat-2 a Step Towards Egyptian Space Agency|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201404181348.html|work=allafrica|accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
EgyptSat 2 was planned to be launched in October 1, 2013 but the launch was put on hold on 2011&lt;ref name="zarya" /&gt; following all contact being lost with [[EgyptSat 1]] due to a failure of its S-Band communication system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EgyptSat 1 (MisrSat 1)|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/egyptsat-1.htm|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In 2007, [[Egypt]] made its first attempt to launch a high-resolution surveillance satellite launching the Ukrainian-made [[EgyptSat 1]], but the satellite failed prematurely after 3 years, However, Egypt continued working with [[Yuzhnoye Design Bureau]] for the next project, until it received a bid from [[Russia]] to supply a state-of-the-art "eye in the sky". Negotiations lasted for more than four years until Egypt awarded the contract to [[Russia]] for the development of a high-resolution imaging satellite.

The project was handled by [[RKK Energia]] based on [[Korolyov, Moscow Oblast|Korolev]] on the behalf of [[Russia]], codenamed "E-Star".&lt;ref name=aag /&gt; 60 percent of the satellite's hardware was made by [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=aa2g&gt;{{cite web|title=EgyptSat-2 Ready to Launch Wednesday Atop Soyuz-U Booster 
|url=http://www.americaspace.com/?p=57844|work=America Space}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia also trained Egyptian engineers to control the satellite from a ground station near [[Cairo]]. The cost of the project is rumored to be around 40 million dollar fully funded by the [[Egyptian Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name=aag /&gt;

The spacecraft was shipped to [[Baikonur]] on February 2014 and was launched on April 16, 2014.

==Description==
EgyptSat 2 is a hexagonal satellite, equipped with three deployable, fixed solar arrays and nickel-hydrogen batteries, and Its optical imaging payload will cover the visible and infrared spectral bands, providing a ground resolution of 13.1 feet (four meters) for multispectral imagery and 3.3 feet (one meter) for panchromatic imagery. It includes total coverage of Egypt’s land and maritime territory and their environs.&lt;ref name=aa2g /&gt;

A new and revolutionary technology had been demonstrated first time, as EgyptSat 2 became the first frameless spacecraft created in Russia and the first satellite created by such technology in the history of Russian cosmonautics. The frameless base technology reduces the final assembly of the satellite from six months with several trained professionals and special equipment, to 10 minutes with only two experts, which in turn minimizes effort, time and costs while not compromising the quality of the final product.&lt;ref name=rostec /&gt;&lt;ref name=rt /&gt;

==Mission==
The satellite is supposed to supply the Egyptian government with high-resolution views of Earth for environmental, scientific and military applications.&lt;ref name=a2 /&gt; Data will be transmitted through an X-band communications terminal at a rate of 300-600 Mbit/s to ground stations located near [[Cairo]] and [[Aswan]].&lt;ref name=aa2g /&gt;

According to Tal Dekel, a research fellow at [[Tel Aviv University]]’s Yuval Ne’eman Workshop for Science, Technology and Security, few were aware of the extent of Egypt’s satellite program and the satellite is disguised as scientific research but the truth it would be used by the [[Egyptian Armed Forces]] as a spying satellite.&lt;ref name=aag&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt struggles for spy satellite program progress|url=http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Egypt-struggles-for-spy-satellite-program-progress|work=[[Jeursalem Post]]|author=YAAKOV LAPPIN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EgyptSat 2 acquired its first images on April 30, that released by RSC Energia showing Taylor Bay and [[Melbourne]], Australia.&lt;ref name=spaceflight /&gt;

EgyptSat 2 is circularising its orbit at about 720 kilometers height using an electric propulsion system, planned to complete in August 2014.&lt;ref name=rsw /&gt;

The total cost of the mission was about $40 million.&lt;ref name=rsw /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barensky|first1=Stefan|title=Un satellite d'observation russe pour l'Egypte|url=http://www.air-cosmos.com/2014/04/18/21824-un-satellite-d-observation-russe-pour-l-egypte|website=Air et Cosmos|accessdate=29 September 2014|date=17 April 2014|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assumed lost and end of mission==
On April 14, 2015, the EgyptSat 2 was unresponsive to commands from the Earth and control over the satellite was lost due to a human factor as the main possible cause according to the Russian [[Izvestiya]] newspaper, citing a source in the [[S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia|RSC Energia]].&lt;ref name=lost&gt;{{cite news|title=Communication with EgyptSat 2 satellite lost: Russian newspaper|url=http://www.thecairopost.com/news/147495/news/communication-with-egyptsat-2-satellite-lost-russian-newspaper|accessdate=15 May 2015|work=[[Youm7#The Cairo Post|The Cairo Post]]|agency=[[Youm7]]|date=24 April 2015|location=Cairo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sputnik&gt;{{cite news|title=Egyptian Space Authority Denies Losing Control of EgyptSat Two Satellite|url=http://sputniknews.com/science/20150425/1021383871.html|accessdate=15 May 2015|work=Sputnik news|agency=[[Sputnik (news agency)|Sputnik]]|date=25 April 2015|location=Moscow}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences]] (NARSS) insisted that EgyptSat 2 is still recoverable,&lt;ref name=recover&gt;{{cite web|last1=Todd|first1=David|title=Egyptsat 2 still not recovered after "loss of control"|url=http://seradata.com/SSI/2015/04/egyptsat-2-still-not-recovered-after-loss-of-control/|website=Seradata|accessdate=15 May 2015|location=Russia|date=28 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117025916/http://seradata.com/SSI/2015/04/egyptsat-2-still-not-recovered-after-loss-of-control/|archivedate=17 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the head of NARSS Medhat Mokhtar said, "What was reported about is in fact a regular technical failure. It happens every now and then to all the satellites. The problem will be fixed in the next few hours," explaining that, "any failure in control of satellite begins with absence of response to commands from Earth, and the low battery could be the problem, but it will be fixed and control will be fully restored."&lt;ref name=sputnik /&gt;

EgyptSat 2 has experienced few problems since December 2014, as it lost some of the battery capacity,&lt;ref name=recover /&gt; also on mid-April 2015, EgyptSat 2 had an attitude control issues, then a failure of the primary and backup computer of the satellite had occurred within 15 seconds of each other and no official information was released by the satellite’s operator or manufacturer.&lt;ref name=spacelost&gt;{{cite web|title=EgyptSat-2 Earth Observation Satellite faces potentially Fatal Problems|url=http://www.spaceflight101.com/soyuz-u---egyptsat-2-launch-updates.html|work=spaceflight101|accessdate=15 May 2015|date=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''environmental organization''' is an [[organization]] coming out of the [[Conservation movement|conservation]] or [[environmental movement]]s
that seeks to protect, analyse or monitor the environment against misuse or [[environmental degradation|degradation]] [[Human impact on the environment|from human forces]].

In this sense the environment may refer to the [[environment (biophysical)|biophysical environment]], the [[natural environment]] or the [[built environment]]. The organization may be a [[Charitable organization|charity]], a [[trust law|trust]], a [[non-governmental organization]] or a government organization. Environmental organizations can be global, [[Country|national]], [[Subregion|regional]] or local.

== History ==
Founded on 28 May 1892 in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[Sierra Club]] was one of the first large-scale environmental preservation organizations in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/about|title=About the Sierra Club|work=[[Sierra Club]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
Most organizations exert more influence through their involvement in [[policy making]]. [[Green politics]] is a political ideology which emphasizes the importance of achieving environmental goals. The [[Green party|Green parties]] have formed to implement [[environmental policies]] at a government level.

== Issues in focus ==
[[File:Audubon Center at Bent of the River III.JPG|thumb|Audubon Center at Bent of the River. The Audubon Society is an environmental organization dedicated to the protection of birds.]]
Some [[environmental issue]]s that environmental organizations focus on include [[pollution]], [[waste]], [[resource depletion]], [[human overpopulation]] and [[climate change]].

{{Main article|List of environmental organizations}}
{{further information|List of anti-nuclear groups||Sustainability organizations|:Category:Environmental organizations}}

Notable global environmental organizations are the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), [[World Wide Fund for Nature]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/project/|title=WWF conservation projects around the world|publisher=[[World Wide Fund for Nature]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), [[Greenpeace]] and [[Friends of the Earth]].

== Counter-movements ==
Many [[interest group]]s and associations have been formed, often industry supported, to counter the progressive - [[Criticism of capitalism|capitalism-]] and [[Criticism of libertarianism|economy-skeptic]] attitude and influence of environmental organizations. However, these interest groups are rarely pure in [[ideological]] nature.

'''Eyalets''' ({{lang-ota|ایالت}}, {{IPA-tr|ejaːˈlet|pron}}, English: State), also known as '''beylerbeyliks''' or '''pashaliks''', were a primary [[administrative division]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

From 1453 to the beginning of the nineteenth century the Ottoman local government was loosely structured.&lt;ref name="rm39"/&gt; The Empire was at first divided into provinces called eyalets, presided over by a [[Pasha]] of three tails (feathers borne on a state officer's ceremonial staff).&lt;ref name="rm39"/&gt; The [[Grand Vizier]] was responsible for nominating all the high officers of State, both in the capital and the provinces.&lt;ref name="rm39"/&gt; Between 1861 and 1866, these Eyalets were abolished, and the territory was divided for administrative purposes into [[Vilayet]]s.&lt;ref name="rm39"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/handbookofasiami01greauoft#page/203 |title=A handbook of Asia Minor |year=1919 |publisher=Naval Staff. Intelligence Department |page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eyalets were subdivided into districts called [[liva (sanjak)|liva]]s or [[sanjak]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Raymond Detrez|author2=Barbara Segaert|title=Europe and the historical legacies in the Balkans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=htMUx8qlWCMC&amp;pg=PA167|accessdate=2013-06-01|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-90-5201-374-9|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; each of which was under the charge of a Pasha of one tail, with the title of Mira-lira, or [[Sanjak-bey]].&lt;ref name="pires"/&gt; These provinces were usually called pashaliks by Europeans.&lt;ref name="pires"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/empirescitiesofa00forb#page/188 The empires and cities of Asia (1873)] by [[Forbes, A. Gruar]]. Page 188&lt;/ref&gt; The pasha was invested with powers of absolute government within his province, being the chief of both the military and financial departments, as well as police and criminal justice.&lt;ref name="pires"/&gt;

At official functions, the order of precedence was [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]], [[Baghdad Eyalet|Baghdad]], [[Habesh Eyalet|Abyssinia]], [[Budin Eyalet, Ottoman Empire|Buda]], [[Anatolia Eyalet|Anatolia]], "Mera'ish", and the [[Capitan Pasha]] in Asia and Buda, Egypt, Abyssinia, Baghdad, and [[Rumelia Eyalet|Rumelia]] in Europe, with the remainder arranged according to the chronological order of their conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Çelebi, Evliya. Trans. by von Hammer, Joseph.

Parbury, Allen, &amp; Co. (London), 1834.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==

The term ''eyalet'' is sometimes translated '''province''' or '''governorate'''. Depending on the rank of the governor, they were also sometimes known as ''[[pashalik]]s'' (governed by a ''[[pasha]]''), ''beylerbeyliks'' (governed by a ''bey'' or ''[[beylerbey]]''), and ''kapudanliks'' (governed by a ''kapudan'').

'''Pashaluk''' or '''Pashalik''' ({{lang-tr|paşalık}}) is the abstract word derived from [[pasha]], denoting the quality, office or jurisdiction of a [[pasha]] or the territory administered by him. In European sources, the word "pashalic" generally referred to the eyalets.&lt;ref name="pires"/&gt;

The term 'eyalet' began to be applied to the largest administrative unit of the Ottoman Empire instead of beglerbegilik from the 1590s onward, and it continued to be used until 1867.&lt;ref name="Somel2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Selcuk Aksin Somel|title=The A to Z of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UU8iCY0OZmcC&amp;pg=PA88|accessdate=2013-06-03|date=2010-03-23|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-1-4617-3176-4|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[Murad I]] instituted the great division of the sultanate into two beylerbeyiliks of [[Rumelia Eyalet|Rumelia]] and [[Anatolia Eyalet|Anatolia]], in circa 1365.&lt;ref name="Pitcher1972p125"&gt;{{cite book|author=D.

This became the seat of government of Bayezid’s youngest son, [[Mehmed I]], and was to remain a residence of princely governors until the 16th century.&lt;ref name=Imber&gt;{{cite web|last=Imber|first=Colin|title=The Ottoman Empire,  1300-1650: The Structure of Power|url=http://www.fatih.edu.tr/~ayasar/HIST236/Colin%20_Imber.pdf|year=2002|pages=177–200|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726115700/http://www.fatih.edu.tr/~ayasar/HIST236/Colin%20_Imber.pdf|archivedate=2014-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1395, Bayezid I executed the last [[Shishmanid]] Tsar of [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], and annexed his realm to [[Rumelia Eyalet]]. In 1461, Mehmed II expelled the last of the [[Isfendyarid]] dynasty from [[Sinop Province|Sinop]], awarding him lands near [[Bursa]] in exchange for his hereditary territory. The Isfendyarid principality became a district of [[Anatolia Eyalet]].&lt;ref name=Imber /&gt; In 1468, [[Karaman Eyalet]] was established, following the annexation of the formerly independent [[principality of Karaman]]; [[Mehmed II]] appointed his son [[Mustafa]] as governor of the new eyalet, with his seat at [[Konya]].&lt;ref name=Imber /&gt;

The 16th century saw the greatest increase in the number of eyalets, largely through the conquests of [[Selim I]] and [[Süleyman I]], which created the need to incorporate the new territory into the structure of the Empire, and partly through the reorganisation of existing territory.&lt;ref name=Imber /&gt; A list dated 1527 shows eight eyalets, with [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]], [[Damascus Eyalet|Damascus]], [[Diyarbekir Eyalet|Diyarbekir]] and [[Eyalet of Kurdistan|Kurdistan]] added to the original four. The last eyalet, however, did not survive as an administrative entity. Süleyman’s conquests in eastern Turkey, Iraq and Hungary also resulted in the creation of new eyalets.&lt;ref name=Imber /&gt;

The former [[principality of Dulkadir]] became the [[Dulkadir Eyalet]] at some time after its annexation in 1522. After the Iranian campaign of 1533–6, the new eyalets of [[Erzurum Eyalet|Erzurum]], [[Van Eyalet|Van]], [[Sharazor Eyalet|Sharazor]] and [[Baghdad Eyalet|Baghdad]] guarded the frontier with Iran.&lt;ref name=Imber /&gt; In 1541 came the creation of [[Budin Eyalet]] from part of the old [[Kingdom of Hungary]].&lt;ref name=Imber /&gt; The [[Eyalet of the Archipelago]] was created by Süleyman I especially for [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] in 1533, by detaching districts from the shores and islands of the Aegean which had previously been part of the eyalets of [[Rumelia Eyalet|Rumelia]] and [[Anatolia Eyalet|Anatolia]], and uniting them as an independent eyalet.&lt;ref name=Imber /&gt;

In 1580, Bosnia, previously a district of Rumelia, became an eyalet in its own right, presumably in view of its strategically important position on the border with the Habsburgs. Similar considerations led to the creation of the [[Kanije Eyalet]] from the districts adjoining this border fortress, which had fallen to the Ottomans in 1600. In the same period, the annexation of the Rumelian districts on the lower Danube and the Black Sea coast, and their addition to territories between the Danube and the [[Dniepr River|Dniepr]] along the Black Sea, created the [[Silistra Eyalet]]. At the same time, on the south-eastern shore of the Black Sea, [[Trebizond Eyalet]] came into being. The purpose of this reorganisation, and especially the creation of the eyalet of Özi was presumably to improve the defences of the Black Sea ports against the Cossacks.&lt;ref name=Imber /&gt;

By 1609, according to the list of [[Ayn Ali]], there were 32 eyalets. Some of these, such as Tripoli, Cyprus or Tunis, were the spoils of conquest. Others, however, were the products of administrative division.&lt;ref name=Imber /&gt;

[[File:Ottoman Empire (1795).png|thumb|Eyalets in 1795]]
In 1795, the government launched a major reorganization of the provincial administration, with a law decreeing that there would be 28 provinces, each to be governed by a vizer. These were [[Adana Eyalet|Adana]], [[Aleppo Eyalet|Aleppo]], [[Anatolia Eyalet|Anatolia]], [[Baghdad Eyalet|Baghdad]], [[Basra Eyalet|Basra]], [[Bosnia Eyalet|Bosnia]], [[Eyalet of Childir|Childir]], [[Crete Eyalet|Crete]], [[Damascus Eyalet|Damascus]], [[Diyarbekir Eyalet|Diyarbekir]], [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]], [[Erzurum Eyalet|Erzurum]], [[Habesh Eyalet|Habesh]], [[Karaman Eyalet|Karaman]], [[Kars Eyalet|Kars]], [[Dulkadir Eyalet|Dulkadir]], the [[Eyalet of the Archipelago|Archipelago]], [[Morea Eyalet|Morea]], [[Mosul Eyalet|Mosul]], [[Rakka Eyalet|Rakka]], [[Rumelia Eyalet|Rumelia]], [[Sayda Eyalet|Sayda]], [[Sharazor Eyalet|Sharazor]], [[Silistra Eyalet|Silistra]], [[Sivas Eyalet|Sivas]], [[Trebizond Eyalet|Trebizond]], [[Tripoli Eyalet|Tripoli]], [[Van Eyalet|Van]]. In practice, however, central control remained weak, and beylerbeyis continued to rule some provinces, instead of vizers.&lt;ref name="Hanioglu2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Sükrü Hanioglu|title=A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nK5ZDKf3JgkC&amp;pg=PA50|accessdate=2013-06-01|date=2010-03-08|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2968-2|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
The beglerbegiliks where the [[timar]] system was not applied, such as [[Habesh Eyalet|Abyssinia]], Algiers, Egypt, Baghdad, Basra and [[Lahsa Eyalet|Lahsa]], were more autonomous than the others. Instead of collecting provincial revenues through [[sipahi]]s, the beglerbegi transferred fixed annuals sums to Istanbul, known as the [[salyane]].&lt;ref name="Somel2010"/&gt;

By 1500, the four central eyalets of the Empire, Rumelia, Anatolia, Rum and Karaman, were under direct rule. [[Wallachia]], [[Moldavia]] and the [[Khanate of the Crimea]], territories which Mehmed II had brought under his suzerainty, remained in the control of native dynasties tributary to the Sultan. So, too, did the Kingdom of Hungary after the [[battle of Mohács]] in 1526.&lt;ref name=Imber /&gt;

===Eyalets in 1609===
Conquests of [[Selim I]] and [[Suleyman I]] in the 16th century required an increase in administrative units.  By the end of the latter half of the century there were as many as 42 ''eyalets'', as the beylerbeyliks came to be known.  The chart below shows the administrative situation as of 1609.

[[File:SplitRockFogSignal.jpg|thumb|right|Building housing the two diaphone foghorns at [[Split Rock Light]].]]
A '''foghorn''' is a fog signal that uses sound to warn vehicles of navigational hazards like rocky coastlines, or boats of the presence of other vessels, in [[fog]]gy conditions. The term is most often used in relation to marine transport. When visual [[navigation]] aids such as [[lighthouse]]s are obscured, foghorns provide an audible warning of [[rock outcrop]]s, [[shoal]]s, [[headlands and bays|headlands]], or other dangers to shipping.

==Description==
All foghorns use a vibrating column of air to create an audible tone, but the method of setting up this vibration differs. Some horns, like the Daboll trumpet, used vibrating plates or metal [[reed (music)|reeds]], a similar principle to a modern electric [[Vehicle horn|car horn]]. Others used air forced through holes in a revolving cylinder or disk, in the same manner as a [[siren (noisemaker)|siren]]. Semi-automatic operation of foghorns was achieved by using a [[clockwork]] mechanism (or "coder") to sequentially open the valves admitting air to the horns; each horn was given its own timing characteristics to help mariners identify them.&lt;ref name=ayre&gt;See for example Fox, F. [http://homepages.manx.net/fredd/siren.html Siren, Point of Ayre Lighthouse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709040136/http://homepages.manx.net/fredd/siren.html |date=2008-07-09 }}, accessed 08-09-2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early fog signals===
[[File:Fort point light station bell.jpg|thumb|right|An early form of fog signal. The fog bell at [[Fort Point Light Station]], [[Maine]].]]
Audible fog signals have been used in one form or another for hundreds of years, initially simply [[Bell (instrument)|bells]] or [[gong]]s struck manually.

At some [[lighthouse]]s, a small [[cannon]] was let off periodically to warn away ships, but this had the obvious disadvantage of having to be fired manually throughout the whole period the fog persisted (which could be for several days). Lighthouse windows and lighting apparatus were susceptible to damage depending on the proximity of the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Oke |first=Robert |date=15 May 1863|title= Letter to J. H. Warren Esq. Chairman, Board of Works (St. John’s); Letters by Robert Oke (1794-1870) |location= PANL GN 1/3/A file 1/1864 |publisher=The Rooms Archives (St. John’s, NL) }}&lt;/ref&gt; One incident of lax handling of explosives nearby resulted in a concussion that propelled the lighthouse keeper at [http://lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=1312/ Fort Amherst], who was seated, to the other end of the room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Oke |first=Robert |date=5 Jan 1863|title= Letter to J. H. Warren Esq. Chairman Board of Works (St. John’s); Letters by Robert Oke (1794-1870) |location= PANL File 1/1864 |publisher=The Rooms Archives (St. John’s, NL) }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], [[whistle]]s were also used where a source of steam power was available, though [[Trinity House]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[lighthouse authority]], did not employ them, preferring an explosive signal.

Throughout the 19th century efforts were made to automate the signalling process. Trinity House eventually developed a system (the "[[Signal, Fog, Mk I]]") for firing a [[nitrocellulose|gun-cotton]] charge electrically.  However, the charge had to be manually replaced after each signal. At [[Portland Bill]], for example, which had a five-minute interval between fog-signals, this meant the horns had to be lowered, the two new charges inserted, and the horns raised again every five minutes during foggy periods.
Clockwork systems were also developed for striking bells.&lt;ref name=pepper&gt;Pepper, T. ''[http://www.terrypepper.com/lights/closeups/fogsignal/stevens/stevens.htm Stevens Fog Bell Apparatus]'', Seeing the Light&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain [[James William Newton]] claimed to have been the inventor of the fog signalling technique using loud and low notes.&lt;ref name=jesmond&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Jesmond Old Cemetery]] |url=http://www.jesmondoldcemetery.co.uk/newton_50.html |title=James William Newton |quote=[[James William Newton|Captain Newton]] also claimed to be the inventor of fog signalling by the interchange and repetition [sic] of loud and low notes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanization===
[[File:Foghorns.jpg|thumb|right|Foghorns near [[Lizard Point, Cornwall|Lizard Point]], [[Cornwall]]. This installation uses a [[siren (noisemaker)|siren]] to produce sound.]]
[[File:Foghorn building on Flat Holm Island.jpg|thumb|right|Another Trinity House fog siren installation on [[Flat Holm]], now restored by the Flat Holm Project]][[File:SumburgLighthouseFoghorn.jpg|thumb|right|Bearing mechanism of [[Sumburgh Head|Sumburgh]] lighthouse Foghorn ([[Shetland]])]]

The first [[Automation|automated]] [[steam]]-powered foghorn was invented by [[Robert Foulis (inventor)|Robert Foulis]], a Scotsman who emigrated to [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], [[New Brunswick]], Canada. Foulis is said to have heard his daughter playing the [[piano]] in the distance on a foggy night, and noticed the low notes were more audible than the higher notes: he then designed a device to produce a low-frequency sound, as well as a code system for use with it. Foulis repeatedly presented his concept to the Commissioners of Light Houses for the [[Bay of Fundy]] for installation on [[Partridge Island, New Brunswick|Partridge Island]]. While the Commissioners initially rejected Foulis's plan, one commissioner eventually encouraged Foulis to submit detailed plans to the Commission.  For reasons unknown, the plans were given to another Canadian engineer, [[T. T. Vernon Smith]], who officially submitted them to the Commissioners as his own.  The foghorn was constructed at [[Partridge Island, New Brunswick|Partridge Island]] in 1859 as the Vernon-Smith horn.  After protest by Foulis and a legislative inquiry, Foulis was credited as the true inventor, but he never patented or profited from his invention.&lt;ref name=foulis&gt;[http://www.glasgowguide.co.uk/info-fame_Robert_Foulis_Jr.html Famous Glaswegians - Robert Foulis, JR], accessed 05-09-08&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of fog signal technology continued apace at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terrypepper.com/lights/closeups/fogsignal/diaphone/diaphone.htm Terry Pepper, ''Seeing the Light'', "Diaphones".]&lt;/ref&gt;  During the same period an inventor, [[Celadon Leeds Daboll]], developed a coal-powered foghorn called the [[Daboll trumpet]] for the American lighthouse service, though it was not universally adopted.&lt;ref name=holland&gt;Holland, F. R. ''America's Lighthouses'', Dover, 1988, {{ISBN|0-486-25576-X}}, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; A few Daboll trumpets remained in use until the mid-20th century.

In the [[United Kingdom]], experiments to develop more effective foghorns were carried out by [[John Tyndall]] and [[Lord Rayleigh]], amongst others. The latter's ongoing research for Trinity House culminated in a design for a siren with a large trumpet designed to achieve maximum sound propagation (see reference for details of the Trials of Fog Signals&lt;ref name="Renton 1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Renton|first=Alan|title=Lost Sounds: The Story of Coast Fog Signals|year=2001|publisher=Whittles Publishing|isbn=978-1870325837}}&lt;/ref&gt;), installed in [[Trevose Head Lighthouse]], [[Cornwall]] in 1913.

One of the first automated fog bells was the Stevens Automatic Bell Striker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terrypepper.com/lights/closeups/fogsignal/stevens/stevens.htm Terry Pepper, Seeing the Light, Stevens Automated Bell Striker.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some later fog bells were placed under water, particularly in especially dangerous areas, so that their sound (which would be a predictable code, such as the number "23") would be carried further and reverberate through the ship's hull.  For example, this technique was used at [[White Shoal Light (Michigan)]].&lt;ref name = "National Geographic"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Putnam |first= George R. |date=January 1913 |title= Beacons of the Seas: Lighting the Coasts of the United States |journal=National Geographic Magazine |volume=XXIV |issue=1 |pages=19 |id= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LNQKAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA19,M1 |accessdate=June 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terrypepper.com/lights/michigan/whiteshoal/whiteshoal.htm Terry Pepper, ''Seeing The Light'', White Shoal Light.]&lt;/ref&gt;  This was an earlier precursor to [[RACON]].

===Diaphone===
{{Main|Diaphone}}
From the early 20th century an improved device called the [[diaphone]], originally invented as an [[organ stop]] by [[Robert Hope-Jones]],&lt;ref name="Renton 1"/&gt; and developed as a fog signal by John Northey of [[Toronto]], became the standard foghorn apparatus for new installations.{{where|date=April 2015}} Diaphones were powered by [[compressed air]] and could emit extremely powerful low-frequency notes.

In 1982, the Dutch broadcaster [[VPRO]] aired a live foghorn concert on national radio, relaying the sound of the foghorns in [[Emden]], [[Calais]], [[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuwpoort]], [[Scheveningen]], [[Den Helder]], [[Lelystad]], [[Urk]], [[Marken]] and [[Kornwerderzand]], mixed with studio music by sound artist [[Alvin Curran]].  &lt;ref&gt;[http://weblogs.vpro.nl/radioarchief/2010/07/22/ovt-serie-gouden-jaren-afl-4-bijzondere-experimenten/#more-4146], retrieved July 26, 2010. Contains an audio file of the complete broadcast. [https://www.nporadio1.nl/ovt/onderwerpen/2483-vpro-radioarchief-experimenten-het-misthoornconcert], retrieved September 6, 2018.  Diaphone foghorns are currently still active on Low Head, Souter, whitefish, and Portland Bill, and Whitby Lighouses, for example.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obsolescence===
[[File:Foghorn On Ailsa Craig.jpg|thumb|right|Foghorn on [[Ailsa Craig]], where the fog signal was discontinued in 1966.]]
Since automation of lighthouses became common in the 1960s and 1970s, most older foghorn installations have been removed to avoid the need to run the complex machinery associated with them, and have been replaced with electrically powered diaphragm or [[air horn|compressed air horn]]s. Activation is completely automated: a laser or photo beam is shot out to sea, and if the beam reflects back to the source (i.e. the laser beam is visible due to the fog), the sensor sends a signal to activate the foghorn. In many cases, modern navigational aids have rendered large, long-range foghorns completely unnecessary, according to the [[International Association of Lighthouse Authorities]].&lt;ref name=iala&gt;Noble, D. L. ''Lighthouses and Keepers'', Naval Institute Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-1-59114-626-1}}, p.169&lt;/ref&gt;

==Railway fog signals==
{{Main|Detonator (railway)}}
Fog signals have also been used on railway lines since the middle of the 19th century to indicate to the driver of a moving train that a broken down train, a work party, or some other unforeseen hazard is on the line ahead. Small [[explosive]] [[detonator]]s or torpedoes are placed on the track, and detonated by the pressure of the wheels of the oncoming train.  The loud report of the explosion provides the indication to the driver, that in most cases requires the train to be stopped immediately. During [[World War II]], these devices were modified to detonate [[demolition charge]]s during railroad [[sabotage]] operations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1927">The '''gross reproduction rate''' ('''GRR''') is the average number of daughters a woman would have if she survived all of her childbearing years, which is roughly to the age of 45, subject to the age-specific fertility rate and sex ratio at birth throughout that period. This rate is a measure of replacement fertility if mortality is not in the equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/gross+reproduction+rate|title=gross reproduction rate|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often regarded as the extent to which the generation of daughters replaces the preceding generation of women and so on and so forth. If the value is equal to one that indicates that women will replace themselves. If the value is more than one that indicates that the next generation of women will outnumber the current one. If the value is less than one that indicates that the next generation of women will be less numerous than the current one.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Population: An introduction to Concepts and Issues|last=Weeks|first=John R.|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2014|isbn=978-1-305-09450-5|location=Boston, MA|pages=227-228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gross reproduction rate is similar to the [[net reproduction rate]] (NRR), the average number of daughters a woman would have if she survived her lifetime subject to the age-specific fertility rate and mortality rate throughout that period.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors''' ('''HKIS'''; {{zh|first=t|t=香港測量師學會}}) is a surveying organization in [[Hong Kong]].

It was formally established in April 1984 with 85 founding members. It is the only professional surveying body incorporated by ordinance in Hong Kong. As of February 2017, membership exceeds 9,776, with more than 6,288 corporate members. The first president of the institute was Sr Kan Fook-Yee ({{zh|first=t|t=簡福飴|s=简福饴|j=gaan2 fuk1 ji4|p=Jiǎn Fúyí|labels=no}}).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpjobs.com/hk/article/founding-president-the-hkis-kan-fook-yee-played-key-role-helping-hong-kong%E2%80%99s-surveyors&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Chinese name from http://www.hkis.org.hk/ufiles/HKIS_past.pdf--&gt;

Members holding HKIS qualifications may use the following designations after their name: MHKIS (Member), FHKIS (Fellow), AMHKIS (Associate Member). Those with the designation MHKIS or FHKIS are also known as professional surveyors.

== History ==

Sr Kan Fook-Yee and a number of his colleagues saw the value of a professional body for local surveyors, and the need to stimulate the development of the industry.

Prior to the establishment of the HKIS in 1984, the Britain-based [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]] (RICS) represented the industry in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=Langdonp106&gt;Langdon, Davis. ''Spon's Asia-Pacific Construction Costs Handbook, Fourth Edition''. [[CRC Press]], March 30, 2010. {{ISBN|0203855345}}, 9780203855348. p. [https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=fiLcnAhinBMC&amp;pg=PA106 106].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute was statutorily incorporated by virtue of the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors Ordinance in January 1990 (Cap. 1148). In July 1991, the Surveyors Registration Ordinance (Cap. 417) was passed and a Registration Board was set up to administer the registration of surveyors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_pdf.nsf/6799165D2FEE3FA94825755E0033E532/3FE760D395AE8F70482575EF0026CB9B?OpenDocument&amp;bt=0&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors Ordinance of 1990 incorporated the HKIS.&lt;ref name="SiuKup287"&gt;Siu, Helen F. and Agnes S. Ku. ''Hong Kong Mobile: Making a Global Population''. [[Hong Kong University Press]], February 1, 2009. {{ISBN|9622099181}}, 9789622099180. p. [https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=LTr9AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA287 287].&lt;/ref&gt;

The head office was previously at the Swire House (now the [[Chater House]]) in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19980206010101/http://www.hkis.org.hk/ Home page]. Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors. February 6, 1998. "1934 Swire House, Chater Road, Central, HONG KONG."&lt;/ref&gt; but it later moved to the [[Jardine House]] in Central in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19980703214156/http://www.hkis.org.hk/ Home page]. Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors. July 3, 1998. "Suite 510, Jardine House, 1 Connaught Place, Central, Hong Kong."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the HKIS stated that the Hong Kong government ought to establish an authority that oversees renovations of older buildings to prevent corruption and wrongful conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Yvonne. "[http://www.scmp.com/property/hong-kong-china/article/1520046/clean-buildings-renovation-sector-hong-kong-institute Clean up buildings renovation sector, Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors says]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6j3NCptlk?url=http://www.scmp.com/property/hong-kong-china/article/1520046/clean-buildings-renovation-sector-hong-kong-institute Archive]). ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Wednesday 28 May 2014. Retrieved on 17 July 2016. Print title: "Stop rot in repairs trade, say surveyors"&lt;/ref&gt;

A member of either the HKIS or the RCIS may join the other organization after one year of working in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=Langdonp106/&gt;

== Organisation  ==

The General Council governs the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors and oversees the functions and activities of the Divisions, Young Surveyors Group, Board of Membership, Board of Education, Board of Professional Development, Surveyors Times Editorial Board, Surveying and Built Environment Editorial Board, and the appointed Committees including the Executive Committee and Standing Committees. The General Council and all boards and divisions are operated by volunteers from the profession and are supported by the HKIS Secretariat.

The HKIS has six divisions by reference to respective professional practices; they are:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hkis.org.hk/en/pdf/org-201506.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISO 3166-2:LT''' is the entry for [[Lithuania]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Lithuania, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[Counties of Lithuania|10 counties]], [[Municipalities of Lithuania|7 city municipalities, 44 district municipalities, and 9 municipalities]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|LT}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Lithuania. The second part is two letters.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

Edmund | title=EBN KORDADBEH  | encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]] | accessdate=2008-02-07|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ebn-kordadbeh}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a Persian [[geographer]] and bureaucrat of the 9th century. He was the son of [[Abdallah ibn Khordadbeh]], a prominent Abbasid general, who was the son of a [[Zoroastrian]] convert to [[Islam]]. Ibn Khordadbeh was appointed "Director of Posts and Intelligence" for the province of [[Jibal]] in northwestern Iran under the [[Abbasid]] Caliph [[Al-Mu'tamid|al-Mutammid]] (ruled 869&amp;ndash;885 CE). In this capacity ibn Khordadbeh served as both postmaster general and the [[Caliph]]'s personal spymaster in that vital province.

Around 846-847CE ibn Khordadbeh wrote ''[[Book of Roads and Kingdoms (ibn Khordadbeh)|Kitāb al Masālik w’al Mamālik]]'' (''The Book of Roads and Kingdoms'') (with the second edition of the book being published in 885CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hee-Soo|first=Lee|work=Early Korea-Arabic Maritime Relations Based on Muslim Sources|publisher=Korea Journal 31(2) (1991), p26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this work, ibn Khordadbeh described the various peoples and provinces of the [[Abbasid|Abbasid Caliphate]]. Along with maps, the book also includes descriptions of the land, people and culture of the Southern [[Asia]]n coast as far as Brahamputra, The [[Andaman Islands]], [[peninsular Malaysia]] and [[Java (island)|Java]].&lt;ref name=Coedes&gt;{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F. Vella|others= trans.Susan Brown Cowing|title= The Indianized States of Southeast Asia|year= 1968|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|isbn= 978-0-8248-0368-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|108}} The lands of [[Tang Dynasty|Tang China]], [[Unified Silla]] (Korea) and [[Japan]] are referenced within his work.&lt;ref name="Bird2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Isabella Bird|title=Korea and Her Neighbours.: A Narrative of Travel, with an Account of the Recent Vicissitudes and Present Position of the Country.

Ibn Khordadbeh clearly mentions [[Wāḳwāḳ|Waqwaq]] twice: ''East of China are the lands of Waqwaq, which are so rich in gold that the inhabitants make the chains for their dogs and the collars for their monkeys of this metal. They manufacture tunics woven with gold. Excellent ebony wood is found there.'' And again: ''Gold and ebony are exported from Waqwaq.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200504/the.seas.of.sindbad.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The book does not reflect a strong influence from Greek earlier works such as Ptolemy's. The work uses heavily Persian administrative terms, gives considerable weight to Pre-Islamic Iranian history, uses native Iranian cosmological division system of the world. These reflect the existence of Iranian sources at the heart of the work.&lt;ref name=mic&gt;{{cite book|title=Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia|first1=Josef W.|last1=Meri|first2=Jere|last2=Bacharach|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=0-415-96690-6}} pp. 359–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of the few surviving sources that describes [[Jewish]] merchants known as [[Radhanites]].

Khordadbeh wrote other books. He wrote around 8–9 other books on many subjects such as "descriptive geography" (the book ''Kitāb al Masālik w’al Mamālik''), "etiquettes of listening to music", "Persian genealogy", cooking", "drinking", "astral patterns", "boon-companions", "world history", "music and musical instruments". The book on music had the title ''Kitāb al-lahw wa-l-malahi'' which is on musical matters of Pre-Islamic Persia.&lt;ref name=ei-khordadbeh/&gt;&lt;ref name=mic/&gt;

He is known as a pioneer of study of [[karst topography|karst studies]]. Together with his other writings, until the late 19th century his best-known work—the 1689 ''[[The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola|Glory of the Duchy of Carniola]]'', published in 15 books in four volumes—was the main source for older [[History of Slovenia|Slovenian history]], making him one of the precursors of modern Slovenian historiography.&lt;ref&gt;Reisp, Branko et al. (1987): ''Korespondenca Janeza Vajkarda Valvasorja z Royal Society''. Ljubljana: SAZU, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Valvasor was born in the town of [[Ljubljana]], then [[Duchy of Carniola]], now the capital of Slovenia. In the 16th century, It was Johann Baptist Valvasor who established the family Valvasor in the Duchy of Carniola in central Europe in a part of Austria that is now the Republic of Slovenia. In medieval Latin "[[Vavasour|Valvasor]]" or "Valvasore" held the meaning "the carrier of the feud". In western Europe its use can be traced back to the 11th century.

Neither the exact day nor the actual place of Valvasor's birth are known, but his baptism was registered at [[Ljubljana Cathedral]]. He was the twelfth child born to Bartholomäus and Anna Maria Freiin von Rauber, who did not only live at their [[Medija Castle]] in [[Izlake]] but also had a town residence in Ljubljana at [[Old Square (Ljubljana)|Old Square]]. His godparents were Freiherr (Baron) Konrad Ruess von Ruessenstein from the [[Strmol Castle]] and Regina Dorothea Rasp from the [[Krumperk Castle]].

Valvasor's father died when the boy was ten years old. His mother died when he was 16. At the time he was attending the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] school in Ljubljana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KvMTCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA215 |chapter=Janez Vajkard / Johann Weikhard Valvasor |page=215 |title=Slovenski književniki v Ljubljani |trans-title=Slovene Literates in Ljubljana |language=Slovenian|publisher=ZRC |first=Marjan |last=Dolgan |first2=Jerneja |last2=Fridl |first3=Manca |last3=Volk |year=2014 |isbn=9789612547110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1659 at the age of seventeen, he did not choose to continue his studies at a university but decided to broaden his horizons by meeting learned men on a journey across Europe. This journey lasted fourteen years and it even took him to northern Africa. During this period, he joined the army in the [[Austrian-Turkish War]], where he became closely acquainted with the conditions on the [[Croatian Military Frontier]].

Shortly after marrying Anna Rosina Grafenweger in 1672, Valvasor acquired the [[Bogenšperk Castle]] near [[Litija]], where he arranged a writing, drawing and printing workshop. Valvasor spent a fortune on the publishing of his books; towards the end of his life, his debts forced him to sell Bogenšperk Castle, his vast library and his collection of prints. In 1690, Aleksandar Ignacije Mikulić, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zagreb|Bishop of Zagreb]], bought his library, along with some 7,300 graphics, and moved it to Slavonia, where the collection became part of the library of the Zagreb Archbishopric, now part of the [[Croatian State Archives]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arhiv.hr/hr/hda/fs-ovi/metropolitana.htm Croatian State Archives], Division of the Zagreb Archbishopy. Retrieved 3 April 2009 {{hr icon}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019040253/http://www.arhiv.hr/hr/hda/fs-ovi/metropolitana.htm |date=19 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Valvasor died in September 1693 in [[Krško]]. He is believed to have been buried in the family crypt at [[Medija Castle]],&lt;ref name="SBL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Valvasor, Janez Vajkard, baron|url=http://www.slovenska-biografija.si/oseba/sbi759993/|website=Slovenski biografski leksikon|accessdate=April 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is uncertain.&lt;ref name="Golec"/&gt; The [[Yugoslav Partisans]] dynamited the castle in 1944&lt;ref&gt;Information sign posted at Medija Castle.&lt;/ref&gt; and no trace of his putative grave remains today.&lt;ref name="SBL"/&gt;

==Legacy==
===The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola===
Valvasor's most important work remains ''[[The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola]]'' (original title: {{lang|de|Die Ehre deß Herzogthums Crain}},&lt;ref&gt;Johann Weichard von Valvasor: {{lang|de|Die Ehre Deß Hertzogthums Crain, Das ist, Wahre, gründliche, und recht eigendliche Gelegen- und Beschaffenheit dieses, in manchen alten und neuen Geschicht-Büchern zwar rühmlich berührten, doch bishero nie annoch recht beschriebenen Römisch-Keyserlichen herrlichen Erblandes : Anjetzo, Vermittelst einer vollkommenen und ausführlichen Erzehlung aller seiner Landschafften, Felder ... alter und neuer Denckwürdigkeiten ...

===Karst research===
Valvasor was a pioneer of study of [[karst topography|karst phenomena]]. Upon the proposal of [[Edmond Halley]], who was not only an astronomer but also a geophysicist, and in 1687 his extensive treatise on the [[hydrology]] of the intermittent [[Lake Cerknica]] won him a Fellowship of the Royal Society.&lt;ref&gt;Reisp, Branko et al. 1987.

This is a list of [[flag]]s which are entirely or largely [[black (color)|black]].

==In history==
&lt;!--Dated references here, in order--&gt;
[[File:Flag of Afghanistan (1880–1901).svg|thumb|Solid black flag; flag of the [[Emirate of Afghanistan]] from 1880-1901.]]
[[File:Flag_of_the_National_Fascist_Party_(PNF).svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Fascist National Party]] (Partito Nazionale Fascista) from 1926 to 1943. There were variations of the flag with different styles of fasces, this image shows one of those styles.]]
* A black flag ([[Black Standard]]) was used by [[Muhammad]] to represent his religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fotw.net/flags/islam.html ''Islamic Flags''] at Flags of the World&lt;/ref&gt; It was used as the standard of the Abbasid Caliphate. It has also been stated that it will be the flag of the army that will fight the ''[[Dajjal]]''.
* During the [[German Peasants' War]] in the 16th century the black flag was used by the revolting farmers.
*[[Afghanistan]] flew a solid black flag from 1709–38 and from 1880–1901 (see [[Flag of Afghanistan]]).
* The black flag with the motto ''Viurem lliures o morirem'' (We live free or die) was flown by  Catalan army and militia corps during the final stages of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], when the Allies had already abandoned Catalonia that fought alone against the Spanish and French armies during 1713-1714. This black flag was packaged in 2012 with the historical novel  [http://www.lliuresomorts.cat ''Lliures o Morts''] (Live Free or Die) authored by Jaume Clotet and David de Montserrat.
* The Black Flag was flown by  certain irregular [[Confederate Army]] units in the [[American Civil War]] of 1861-1865 to symbolize that they would neither give, nor accept [[No quarter|quarter]]; symbolizing the opposite of the [[white flag]] of [[Surrender (military)|surrender]].
* The [[Anarchist symbolism#Black flag|Anarchist black flag]] has been an anarchist symbol since the 1880s. Anarchists use either a plain black flag or a black flag with an "A" and an "O" around it, this symbol is a reference to a [[Proudhon]] quote "'''A'''narchy is '''O'''rder Without Power".&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Peter. [[Demanding the Impossible]]. Fontana, London. 1993. p. 558&lt;/ref&gt;
* The color black was famous as the flag of [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]'s [[National Fascist Party]], designed after the party's paramilitary [[Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale|Blackshirts]].
* Upon the surrender of Nazi Germany in [[World War II]] German [[U-boat]]s were ordered to fly a black flag and sail to an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] port and surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SPECIAL ORDERS BY THE SUPREME COMMANDER, ALLIED EXPEDITIONARY FORCE TO THE GERMAN HIGH COMMAND RELATING TO NAVAL FORCES|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/gs5.asp|accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flag_of_Edward_England.svg|thumb|The traditional "[[Jolly Roger]]" of [[piracy]].]]
[[File:Liwa-e-Ahmadiyya 1-2.svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Ahmadiyya]] Muslim Community, first designed in the 1930s. For Ahmadi Muslims, it symbolizes the advent of the [[Mahdi]].]]
[[File:Chetniks_Flag.svg|thumb|[[Chetniks|Chetnik]] flag inscription reads: "For king and fatherland; freedom or death".]]
* The [[Jolly Roger]], or '''skull and crossbones''', is flown to identify a ship's crew as pirates about to attack. The flag most commonly identified as the Jolly Roger today is the skull and crossbones (although swords are also common), a flag consisting of a human skull above two long bones (probably tibias) set in an x-mark arrangement, most usually depicted crossing each other directly under the skull, on a black field. This design was used by several pirates, including Captains "Black Sam" Bellamy, Edward England, and John Taylor. Some Jolly Roger flags also include an hourglass, another common symbol representing death in 17th- and 18th-century Europe. Despite the prominence of flags with art in popular culture, plain black flags with no art were often employed by most pirates in the 17th–18th century. Historically, the flag was flown to frighten the pirates' victims into surrendering without a fight, since it conveyed the message that the attackers were outlaws who would not consider themselves bound by the usual rules of engagement—and might, therefore, slaughter those they defeated (since captured pirates were usually hanged, they did not have much to gain by asking quarter if defeated). Since the decline of piracy, various military units have used the Jolly Roger, usually in skull-and-crossbones design, as a unit identification insignia or a victory flag to ascribe to themselves the proverbial ferocity and toughness of pirates. In a non-naval context the skull and crossbones motif has additional meanings, for example, to signify a hazard such as poison
* The [[Ahmadiyya]] flag, first designed in the 1930s during the second [[Khalifatul Masih|Caliphate]]. Just as the black colour absorbs visible light, similarly the black colour symbolizes the absorption of spiritual light.
* The flag of the [[Chetniks|Chetnik]] movement in [[Serbia]] and former [[Yugoslavia]] during the 20th century, with the words "''Sloboda ili smrt'' ('liberty or death') inscribed in white under a skull.

===Jihadism in the 20th/21st century===
[[File:Flag_of_Jihad.svg|thumb|The "[[black flag of jihad]]" as used by jihadist militants since around the late 1990s.]]
In [[Ali Soufan]]'s book ''The Black Banners'', he explains the title by noting that quotes from various [[Hadith]]s regarding "Black Banners" of a "new army" taking over Khorasan have some kind of prophetic significance with many modern adherents of [[Islamic extremism|extremist]] [[jihadism]]. He notes that it is "not a coincidence" that [[Osama bin Laden]] made [[al-Qaeda]]'s flag black. Soufan also notes that there is debate about whether the prophet Mohammed actually spoke some of the quoted Hadiths (such as one attributed to [[Abu Hurairah]]). He also notes that Sheikh [[Salman al-Ouda]] has said the Black Banner hadiths are not able to be authenticated.&lt;ref&gt;The Black Banners, [[Ali Soufan]], 2011, [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In society==

[[File:United States POW-MIA flag.svg|thumb|Flag of the [[National League of POW/MIA Families]].]]
[[File:Rozlouceni s vaclavem havlem vladislavsky sal 443.jpg|thumb|right|Flag of mourning in Prague Castle.]]
&lt;!--Non-dated references--&gt;
* Black flags are often associated with funerals in the West, particularly state funerals and public [[mourning]].
* In the former [[Yugoslavia]], a plain black flag is the flag of mourning. It is displayed for 40 days after death on the deceased person's house.
* The black flag is the symbol of the Jewish ultra-Orthodox, anti-Zionist group, [[Neturei Karta]]. It is flown as a sign of mourning over the creation of the [[State of Israel]], most commonly on [[Israeli Independence Day]].
* The [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Pirate Party]] have a black flag as a symbol, shaped like the letter P.
* In the German and Finnish militaries, black has been the traditional color of armored troops, which carries over to the flags of armored units. In Finland, also combat engineers have a black flag. The Armoured Brigade has a black flag defaced with a helmet, and engineer battalions have the black flags defaced with various symbols.
* The New Zealand Rugby Union team, commonly known as the All Blacks, have a predominantly black flag with a white fern superimposed [[List of New Zealand flags]].

==In competition, as a signal==
* The black flag is a [[racing flag]] used to summon a driver to the pits.
* In [[Racing Rules of Sailing|sail racing]], when the black flag is displayed with the [[Racing Rules of Sailing#Preparatory signal|preparatory signal]], a boat that is over the starting line in the minute prior to the starting signal is immediately disqualified without a hearing. 
* In some forms of racing, &lt;!--including most small boat races (especially [[sailing]] races)--&gt; a black flag is used to disqualify competitors or indicate some other penalty (such as a forced pit stop in [[NASCAR]]).

==Fictional black flags==
* In ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and other [[Middle-earth]] writings of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], the banner of the evil overlord [[Morgoth]] is described as being entirely black with no insignia.

For a list of cities proper, see [[List of European cities by population within city limits]]. For a list of European cities by country, see [[List of cities in Europe]].}}
[[File:Europa-bei-nacht 1-1024x768.jpg|thumb|300px|Satellite picture of Europe by night. Lights reveal the urbanized areas of Europe. It also shows the [[Blue Banana]] megalopolis from north-west England to northern Italy, and [[Golden Banana]] urbanized area between Genua and Valencia.]]

This list ranks [[metropolitan area]]s in [[Europe]] by their population according to three different sources; it includes metropolitan areas that have a population of over 1 million.

{{TOC right}}

==Sources==
List includes metropolitan areas according only studies of [[ESPON]], [[Eurostat]], and [[OECD]]. For this reason some metropolitan areas, like Italian [[Genoa|Genoa Metropolitan Area]] (population is over 1.510.000 as of 2012 according ''"CityRailway" Official Report''), aren't included in this list, with data by other statistic survey institutes.

Figures in the first column come from the [[ESPON]] project, "Study on Urban Functions", which defines cities according to the concept of a functional urban area (core urban area defined morphologically on the basis of population density, plus the surrounding labour pool defined on the basis of commuting). Figures in the second column come from [[Eurostat]]'s Urban Audit and correspond to [[Larger Urban Zone]]s (LUZ). Figures in the fourth column come from the [[OECD]] Territorial Reviews and correspond to "metropolitan regions". Further information on how the areas are defined can be found in the source documents. These figures should be seen as an interpretation, not as conclusive fact.

}}
'''Långsjön''' ({{lang-en|The Long Lake}}) is a [[lake]] in southern [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].
The lake is situated in an old residential neighbourhood located between the municipalities of [[Stockholm]] and [[Huddinge]] and most of the shoreline is private property.  Water level is controlled by a [[sluice]] in the north-western end of the lake where the lake empties into Lake [[Mälaren]] through a system of dikes and culverts.  Polluted waste water was poured directly into the lake during the early 20th century which caused up to two third of the lake to be choked-up until the 1940s.  It was subsequently one of the first lakes in Stockholm to be subject for various attempts to restorations.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-15.1" /&gt;  The northern shores are waterlogged whilst the bedrock surfaces along the southern.  The lake has no major feeders, the inflow instead coming from local [[stormwater]] and [[surface runoff]].&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-15.3"&gt;Vattenprogram, p 15.3-15.4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catchment area ==
Some 60 per cent of the lake catchment area is occupied by settlements, mostly one-family houses but several minor green spaces are scattered around the lake.  South-wester of the lake is a small area forming part of the [[Gömmaren]] nature reserve.  The lake has two bathes.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-15.3" /&gt;

=== Environmental influence ===
The number of polluting operations in the catchment area is limited to a petrol station and an engineering workshop.  In the end of the 1930s sewers were built in the area and the waste water fed into the lake during the 1920s and 1930s is today brought to the wastewater treatment works at [[Henriksdal]], but old sewers still leak into the lake and the water was considered unfit for bathing at several occasions during the 1990s.  Långsjön is one of few lakes in Stockholm where spillway overflow adds appreciable amounts of [[phosphorus]].  [[Surface runoff]] adds some 70&amp;nbsp;kg of phosphorus and 1,000&amp;nbsp;kg of nitrogen annually and more than half of phosphorus added through surface water is produced by the surrounding one-family houses and their gardens.
&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-15.3" /&gt;

== Flora and fauna ==
In August, the stock of [[phytoplankton]] is dominated by [[cyanobacteria]] and [[green algae]], of which several are potentially poisonous and caused major [[algae bloom]]s during the 1990s.  The community of [[zooplankton]] is representative for lakes rich in nutrients with medium-sized [[taxon|taxa]] dominating in late spring and June, while minor taxa are otherwise prevailing.  Larger zooplankton, such as [[Cyclopoida|Cyclopoid]] [[Copepod]]s, are rare and reaches about 40 per cent in July and August.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-15.5"&gt;Vattenprogram, p 15.5-15.7&lt;/ref&gt;

No inventory of [[aquatic plant]]s has been done since the mid-1970s, but [[Nymphaea alba|white waterlily]] is common in the minor bays.  [[Nuphar lutea|yellow water-lily]] occur in minor numbers but [[reed bed]]s are missing.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-15.5" /&gt;

Lake bed fauna includes more than 50 species dominated by freshwater [[Gastropoda|gastropods]] (''[[Hippeutis complanatus]]''), [[Trichoptera|Caddisflies]] (''[[Somatochlora metallica]]''), [[beetle]]s, and [[leech]]es (''[[Alboglossiphonia heteroclita]]'').  Additionally, in 1969 a freshwater [[jellyfish]] (''[[Craspedacusta sowerbii]]'') was documented in the lake, a continental species then new to Sweden but not found in the lake since.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-15.5" /&gt;

Fishes natural to Långsjön include [[perch]], [[northern pike]], [[Rutilus|roach]], [[rudd]], [[carp bream]], [[crucian carp]], [[tench]], and [[ruffe]]; extraneous species are [[common carp]] and [[mirror carp]].  Pike and [[zander]] are planted-out carnivorous species while roach and crucian carp have been decimated by trawling.  Sample catches in 1999 showed the number of perch, roach, and carp had increased far beyond expected levels.  [[Crayfish plague]] hit the lake in 1984, but the [[signal crayfish]] was reintroduced within a few years.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-15.5" /&gt;

The lake is a breeding ground for most birds common to the Stockholm-area — such as [[mute swan]], [[mallard]], and [[Eurasian coot]] — and some less common — such as [[common moorhen]] and [[great crested grebe]].  Other bird sightings include [[Ardea (genus)|heron]], [[tufted duck]], [[common tern]], [[common pochard|pochard]], and [[spotted crake]].&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-15.5" /&gt;

The lake is one of the most important breeding grounds for [[amphibians]], with a documented presence of [[common frog]], [[common toad]] and [[smooth newt]].&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-15.5" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5540">'''MSAT''', short for '''''Mobile Satellite''''', is a [[satellite]]-based [[mobile telephony]] service developed by the [[National Research Council of Canada]]. Supported by a number of companies in the [[United States|US]] and Canada, MSAT hosts a number of services, including the broadcast of [[CDGPS]] signals. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20110604025340/http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/bss/factsheets/601/msat/msat.html MSAT satellites] were built by Hughes (now owned by [[Boeing]]) with a 3 kilowatt solar array power capacity and sufficient fuel for a design life of twelve years. TMI Communications of Canada referred to its MSAT satellite as MSAT-1, while American Mobile Satellite Consortium (now [[Ligado Networks]]) referred to its MSAT as AMSC-1, with each satellite providing backup for the other.

* May 15, 1996 - Reported failures of two solid state power amplifiers (SSPAs) and one L-band receiver on separate occasions aboard MSAT-2.&lt;ref name="q1-1996" /&gt;
* May 4, 2003 - MSAT-1 loses two power amplifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdgps.com/e/cdgps_documents/Service%20Outage-2003-11-30.pdf |title=Service Outage - November 30, 2003 |accessdate=2006-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928143518/http://www.cdgps.com/e/cdgps_documents/Service%20Outage-2003-11-30.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phaseout==
MSAT-1 and MSAT-2 have had their share of problems. Mobile Satellite Ventures placed the AMSC-1 satellite into a 2.5 degree [[inclined orbit]] operations mode in November 2004, reducing station-keeping fuel usage and extending the satellite's useful life.&lt;ref name="MOTIENT-CORP-Nov-2005-S-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1313/121465905001601/filing-main.htm |title=MOTIENT CORP, Form S-1, Filing Date Nov 3, 2005 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 11, 2006, Mobile Satellite Ventures (MSVLP) (now [[LightSquared]]) announced plans to launch a new generation of satellites (in a 3 satellite configuration) to replace the MSAT satellites by 2010. MSV has said that all old MSAT gear would be compatible with the new satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msvlp.com/media/press-releases-view.cfm?id=84&amp;yr=2006 |title=Mobile Satellite Ventures Engages Boeing To Develop Next Generation Satellites |accessdate=2006-11-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114162533/http://www.msvlp.com/media/press-releases-view.cfm?id=84&amp;yr=2006 |archivedate=2006-11-14 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msvlp.com/investor/fact-sheet.cfm |title=Company Fact Sheet: Investor/Financial |accessdate=2006-11-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114162616/http://www.msvlp.com/investor/fact-sheet.cfm |archivedate=2006-11-14 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Main rivers''' ({{Lang-cy|prif afonydd}}&lt;ref&gt;https://naturalresources.wales/flooding/managing-flood-risk/flood-risk-map-guidance/main-rivers/&lt;/ref&gt;) are a statutory type of watercourse in [[England]] and [[Wales]], usually larger streams and rivers, but also include some smaller watercourses. A main river is defined as a watercourse marked as such on a main river map, and can include any structure or appliance for controlling or regulating the flow of water in, into or out of a main river. The [[Environment Agency|Environment Agency's]] powers to carry out flood defence works apply to main rivers only. In [[England]] main rivers are designated by [[Defra]]. The [[Welsh Government]] performs this function in [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmbc.gov.uk/cgi-bin/buildpage.pl?mysql=551 Tonbridge and Malling District Council's Main Rivers definition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217131427/http://www.tmbc.gov.uk/cgi-bin/buildpage.pl?mysql=551 |date=2007-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/cy/gartrefahamdden/llifogydd/38291.aspx Definition of terms on the Environment Agency's website] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20091003115405/http%3A//www.environment%2Dagency.gov.uk/cy/gartrefahamdden/llifogydd/38291.aspx |date=2009-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Every other open watercourse in England and Wales is determined by statute as an '[[ordinary watercourse]]'.

[[File:LS-Mokhotlong.png|thumb|right|250px|Location of Mokhotlong in Lesotho]]
'''Mokhotlong''' is a city and seat of [[Mokhotlong District]] in the mountainous northeastern part of [[Lesotho]]. It is the first major city with an airport along the road from South Africa across the [[Sani Pass]], near the Maloti ([[Drakensberg]] in [[South Africa]]) Mountains. The name of the city is a word in [[Sesotho]], the language of the people of Lesotho, meaning "Place of the Bald Ibis." [[Thabana Ntlenyana]], the highest point in southern Africa is found in Mokhotlong.

== History ==
Mokhotlong’s role as a police post first brought people to this part of Lesotho in 1905. It developed into a trading center for the people of the Highlands region. However, it was preserved from major development by its separation from the rest of the country. Not until 1947 was radio contact established with [[Maseru]], the capital city.

In the next few years an air strip was built and a road cleared through town to link Mokhotlong to the rest of Lesotho. Even so, Mokhotlong continued to be outfitted with provisions and supplies by pony trek from [[Natal Province|Natal, South Africa]], via Sani Pass.&lt;ref name="The Rough Guide South Africa, Lesotho, &amp; Swaziland"&gt;{{cite book|last=McCrea, Mthembu-Salter, Pinchuck, Reid|title=South Africa, Lesotho, &amp; Swaziland: The Rough Guide|year=1999|publisher=Penguin Books Ltd.|location=London|isbn=1-85828-460-0|pages=644–646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography and climate==
An hour and a half drive north of Sani Pass, Mokhotlong is located 270&amp;nbsp;km from Maseru and 200&amp;nbsp;km from 
[[Butha-Buthe]]. The source of the [[Senqu River]], Lesotho’s largest river, is near Mokhotlong, impacting the landscape throughout the town and surrounding district.&lt;ref name="Lonely Planet South Africa, Lesotho, &amp; Swaziland 3rd Ed"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray, Williams, Everist|title=South Africa, Lesotho, &amp; Swaziland|year=1998|publisher=Lonely Planet|location=Hawthorn, Australia|isbn=0-86442-508-2|pages=609–610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mokhotlong experiences a [[subtropical highland climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cwb'') with warm summers and cool, dry winters.

== Events and activities ==
The mountain range is host to activities including hiking trails, horse trails, rock climbing, white water rafting, fly and trout fishing, golfing, bird and game watching, safaris, and much more.&lt;ref name="South Africa: Discover Our Drakensberg"&gt;{{cite web|title=South Africa: Discover Our Drakensberg|url=http://www.drakensberg-tourism.com/|accessdate=7/6/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to regular activities, Mokhotlong hosts the annual High Altitude Summer Marathon at the end of the year. The route runs through the Maloti Mountains and is characterized by great views of both mountains and villages. At 3000 meters above sea level, if the scenery does not take the runner’s breath away, the steep ascents and descents will. There are also half marathon and 10k events, in addition to the full marathon.

Mokhotlong is also on the route of the annual Roof of Africa Rally, an off-road motorcycle rally. Finally, Mokhotlong is home to the highest-elevated diamond mine in the world, [[Letseng diamond mine]], which can be toured, and is often frequented by local students as part of their course of study. Its diamonds have the highest per carat price of any [[kimberlite]] mine, and with the capacity to process more than 5 million tonnes a year and recover about 100,000 carats, it is the seventh largest in the world. Three of their diamonds are among the world’s top twenty rough diamonds.

== Socio-economy ==

Mokhotlong's economy is primarily driven by livestock rearing and subsistence [[agriculture]], though neither of these fully supports most families. Arable land in this mountainous region is a scarce resource. Agricultural production only sustains families from 3 to 9 months of the year. Families cover the gap largely through livestock and remittances from employed family members. However, livestock distribution is skewed with 60% of the livestock owned by 10% of the population; approximately 35% of the community have no livestock. General income is small, given both poor educational opportunities and the high unemployment rate in Lesotho and in South Africa. Consequently, a large segment of the population is seriously poor.&lt;ref name="GROW Annual Reports:  1997-98, 1999-2000, 2000-2001"&gt;GROW Annual Reports:  1997-98, 1999-2000, 2000-2001&lt;/ref&gt; This is exacerbated by HIV/AIDS, which ravages the region. Despite its poverty, few aid organizations work in Mokhotlong. Touching Tiny Lives provides nutritional and medical support to vulnerable children. GROW works with villages to increase agricultural production, support OVC households to improve livelihoods, capacity building, climate change adaptation strategies, etc.

In Mokhotlong City, the Mokhotlong district capital, formal employment is boosted by the presence of government offices.

'''Pieniny National Park''' ({{lang-sk|Pieninský národný park}}; abbr. PIENAP) is a [[national park]] in northern [[Slovakia]]. The park is located in the eastern [[Pieniny|Pieniny Mountains]] on the border with [[Poland]]. It is the smallest national park in Slovakia with an area of 37.49&amp;nbsp;km² (14.48&amp;nbsp;mi²)&lt;ref name="NP2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lacika|first1=Ján|last2=Ondrejka|first2=Kliment|editor1-last=Kollár|editor1-first=Daniel|title=National Parks|date=2009|publisher=DAJAMA|location=Bratislava|isbn=978-80-89226-28-3|pages=26-33}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a buffer zone of 224.44&amp;nbsp;km² (86.66&amp;nbsp;mi²). The park is located in the Slovak districts of [[Kežmarok]] and [[Stará Ľubovňa]] in the [[Prešov Region]].

==History==
The [[Zamagurie]] region was already declared as a protected territory in 1932, making it the first protected international nature park in Europe. On the Polish side it was called [[Pieniny National Park (Poland)|Pieniński Park Narodowy]], while the Slovak part of the Pieniny Mountains was a national nature reserve. The National Park itself was founded on 16 January 1967, which makes it the second oldest national park in Slovakia&lt;ref name="NP2009"/&gt; after the [[Tatra National Park, Slovakia|Tatra National Park]]&lt;ref name="NP2009-tatra"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lacika|first1=Ján|last2=Ondrejka|first2=Kliment|editor1-last=Kollár|editor1-first=Daniel|title=National Parks|date=2009|publisher=DAJAMA|location=Bratislava|isbn=978-80-89226-28-3|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;. By the 1994 act of the Slovak parliament regarding nature and landscape protection, the name of the park was changed to the Pieniny National Park.&lt;ref name="NP2009" /&gt; Its borders were adjusted in 1997.

==Location==
The park is located in north-eastern Slovakia. It covers the eastern [[Pieniny|Pieniny Mountains]] on the border with [[Poland]]. The Pieniny Mountains as a whole, cover an area of more than 100km2. The eastern part of it is situated on the territory of Slovakia, the western half belongs to Poland. The valley of the Dunajec river marks the border between Slovakia and Poland. The Pieniny Mountains are not particularly high, especially in the western part of the range. Though this is somewhat disguised by the extreme dissection of the landscape, especially around the [[Dunajec River Gorge|Dunajec river gorge]]. Along this canyon, the highest point on the Slovak side is the [[Holica]] mountain with 828m. The highest point in the national park is [[Vysoké skalky]] at 1050m. Vysoké skalky is located in the [[Lesser Pieniny range]], which forms a boundary ridge between Slovakia an Poland, consisting of several smaller cliffs. In the south and southwest, bordering the Tatra National Park, the protective belt reaches the [[Popradská kotlina basin]] and the [[Ždiarska brázda furrow]].&lt;ref name="NP2009" /&gt;

==Geology==
The geological foundation of the territory of the Pieniny national park is composed of two basic structures. The western part of the Pieniny mountain range consists of a complex chain of rugged mountains through which the Dunajec river cut out a rocky canyon. Near to the spot where the Dunajec river leaves Slovakia, the [[Lesnicky Potok brook]] flows into the gorge from the right side. The [[Prielom Lesnickeho potoka chasm]] carved its path through the hard [[limestone]] cliffs. It is a gorge, nearly 300m deep squeezed between vertical dark gray limestone cliffs. Above the gorge, the valley of the Lesnicky potok brook is wider and oval-shaped.&lt;ref name="NP2009" /&gt;

==Flora==
The Pieniny national park is characterised by the distribution of the vegatation over several altitude vegetation tiers. The natrue of the whole Zamagurie region has been heavily changed by humans, e.g. the basins have been deforested. Before the deforestation, the basins and furrows were covered by beech forests, which no longer grow in the Tatras with a small exception of the Belianske Tatry reforestation project. The Pieniny national park is rich in rare varieties of plants, including endemnities and subspecies, e.g. [[Chrysanthemum zawadzkii]], [[Taraxacum pieninicum]] and [[Libanotis montana sibirica]].&lt;ref name="NP2009" /&gt; 

==Tourism==
The national park is known for its natural environment, including the [[Dunajec River Gorge]], which is a rafting and hiking location.{{fact|date=July 2017}} The park offers traditional folklore and architecture, especially the village of [[Červený Kláštor]] with the Museum of National Culture.{{fact|date=July 2017}}

The '''Surveying and Spatial Sciences Institute (SSSI)''' is the [[professional association]] for [[surveyors]] and [[spatial science]] workers, including [[cartography]], [[hydrography]], [[remote sensing]], engineering and mining surveying, photogrammetry and [[spatial information]] in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to SSSI|url=http://www.sssi.org.au/|website=SSSI|publisher=Surveying and Spatial Sciences Institute|accessdate=14 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723100826/http://www.sssi.org.au/|archive-date=23 July 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute's members are involved in communities of practice such as land administration, land development, natural resource management, forestry, agriculture, defence, marine environment, local government, health, education, transport, tourism, and many more. The institute deals with policy, administration, collection, measurement, analysis, interpretation, portrayal and dissemination of spatially- related land and sea information, together with associated planning, design and management.

Surveying and Spatial Sciences Institute is located in eight different regions across Australia, providing services in the six states and two territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sssi.org.au/sssi-community/regions|title=Regions|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180814040053/https://sssi.org.au/sssi-community/regions|archive-date=14 August 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=14 August 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute's headquarters are located at National Surveyors House in Canberra, Australia.

==Predecessors==
{{cleanup merge|Spatial Sciences Institute|date=July 2016}}
The Spatial Sciences Institute (SSI) represents the interests of the [[spatial information]] community within the Asia-Pacific region. The Spatial Sciences Institute (SSI) is a not-for-profit professional body  with headquarters in [[Canberra, Australia]]. Its membership spans the disciplines of surveying, information technology, town planning, cartography, archeology, spatial information ([[GPS]], [[remote sensing]] and [[Geographic information system|GIS]]) professions and others. The Institute publishes a bi-annual Spatial Science Journal and numerous other Regional/State based publications and newsletters for both its members and others involved in the spatial industry.

In 1952, six State Institutes combined to form Institute of Surveyors Australia (ISA), the result of more than seventy years of intermittent effort.

Institute of Surveyors Australia (ISA), Australian Urban and Regional Information Systems Association (AURISA) and Remote Sensing and Photogrammetry Association of Australia (RSPAA) amalgamated to form SSI in 2003.

The SSI merged with the [[Institute of Surveyors Australia]] (ISA) to form the Surveying and Spatial Sciences Institute (SSSI) in 2009. ISA provides a strong history while SSI comprises a large youth base, a strong driving factor for ISA with the merger. The primary reason for the merger is to create a strong, unified voice for the surveying and spatial profession with an ability to better serve its members.

==History==
[[File:Q150 surveying memorial, Calliope River Historical Village, 2014 01.jpg|thumb|Q150 survey marker placed at Calliope River Historical Village in 2009 |alt=|245x245px]]
In 2009, SSSI participated in [[Q150]] (the 150th anniversary of the [[Separation of Queensland|founding of Queensland]]) by placing permanent memorials to early explorer/surveyors of Queensland at significant locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sssiq150.com.au/About-SSSI-Q150-Project.aspx|title=About SSSI Q150 Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Surveying and Spatial Science Institute|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227213440/http://www.sssiq150.com.au/About-SSSI-Q150-Project.aspx|archive-date=27 February 2015|dead-url=yes|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include a memorial to surveyor to [[Francis Peter MacCabe]] at the [[Calliope River Historical Village]] ({{Coord|23|57|34.71|S|151|09|06.26|E|type:landmark_region:AU-QLD|name=Calliope River Historical Village Q150 survey mark}}) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sssiq150.com.au/Survey-Mark-Locations.aspx|title=About the marker locations – Some interesting information|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Surveying and Spatial Sciences Institute|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227213448/http://www.sssiq150.com.au/Survey-Mark-Locations.aspx|archive-date=27 February 2015|dead-url=yes|access-date=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== The Name ===

The name 'Surveying and Spatial Sciences Institute' has been chosen by a democratic process which gave all members of both SSI and ISA a vote in choosing the name.  Initially, a call for suggested names was distributed with over 200 names proposed. A two stage vote was held with a short list of four names offered after the first round of voting and a substantial majority selecting the final name. Over 1200 members participated in both stages of the vote evenly spread across both SSI and ISA memberships.

==Background==
The spatial sciences range from the traditional practices of [[surveying]] and [[cartography]] to the more recent practices using [[GPS]], [[remote sensing]] and [[Geographic information system|GIS]]. The spatial sciences involve the skills and understanding to capture, store, manage, manipulate, analyse, model, visualise, set-out and govern information that can be referenced to location. 

Information that can be related to a location is termed spatial information. Though predominantly perceived as geo (earth) related, spatial information can range from the anatomic to astronomic scale, from the real to the [[abstract entity]], over any time period.

SSSI acquire, integrate, manage, analyse, interpret, map or distribute information about a location in space and time. They develop, design, and provide related equipment, software and value-added services; undertake applied research, knowledge management and technology development; and manage, educate and train others.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The spatial information industry is new, emerging, growing and a major player in the development of the nation's economy. The spatial information industry brings sophisticated skills and technology to major challenges facing the nation. It is the recognition of the strategic importance of the industry for policy, planning and operational activities which touch on all aspects of the way people and communities live, that is driving governments around the world to invest in the skilling of the workforce and the development of policies that will ensure the viability and growth of the industry (Cane Report).

=== Principle Objectives ===
Post merger, the institute's purpose &amp; objectives are to empower members to strive for excellence in both, application and practice of surveying and spatial science. This is supported by promoting and representing professional interests of members that work in the discipline of surveying &amp; spatial science. Additionally, the institute also facilitates the exchange of ideas and knowledge between members of the institute via lectures and conferences. 

In short, the institute provides with the following benefits to its members: 

# Advocacy 
# Events 
# Professional Development 
# Certification 
# Migration Skill Assessment 

=== Board Members ===
The Board of management of the Institute are responsible for the governance, strategic planning, fiduciary oversight and monitoring against the strategic plan.

[[File:Swedish Empire (1560-1815) en2.png|thumb|[[Sweden]] at the height of its territorial expansion, following the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] in 1658. The map shows ''Sweden proper'' in dark green, represented in the [[Riksdag of the Estates]], while the other shades of green stand for different [[Dominions of Sweden|dominions]] and [[Possessions of Sweden|possessions]].]]
'''Sweden proper''' ({{lang-sv|Egentliga Sverige}}) is a term used to distinguish those territories that were [[Lands of Sweden|fully integrated]] into the Kingdom of [[Sweden]], as opposed to the [[Dominions of Sweden|dominions]] and [[Possessions of Sweden|possessions]] of, or [[Political unions involving Sweden|states in union]] with, Sweden.

Specifically this means that from approximately 1155–1156 up to the [[Treaty of Fredrikshamn]] in 1809, Sweden proper did also include the bulk of present-day [[Finland]] as a fully integrated part of the realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jouko Vahtola|title=''History of Finland''|publisher=?|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After 1809 however the use of the term has been to distinguish the western part from former ''eastern half'' of the realm, or Sweden from Finland.

[[Skåne]], [[Halland]], [[Blekinge]] and [[Bohuslän]] formerly parts of [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]], came under the [[Swedish Crown]] by the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] in 1658, but it was not until 1719 that it was fully integrated and became part of Sweden proper.

Only the [[estates of the realm]] of Sweden proper were represented in the [[Riksdag of the Estates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Communities in European history: representations, jurisdictions, conflicts | author = Juan Pan-Montojo, Frederik Pedersen | publisher = Edizioni Plus | year = 2007 | isbn = 88-8492-462-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=T7aH-tU3x3UC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;dq=estonia+governorate&amp;q=estonia%20governorate | page = 227 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sweden this included the fourth estate, the Peasants.

Sweden proper is, as opposed to [[Finland Proper (historical province)|Finland Proper]], a geographical reference that has changed over time, whereas the latter was a province in southwestern Finland that gave its name to all of Finland.

The '''Enchanted Woods''' is a fictional place in [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Dream Cycle]], in [[The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath|''Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath'']] novella. Its main inhabitants are the [[Dreamlands#Zoog|zoogs]]. Located in the [[Dreamlands]], it contains a unique, haunted tree whose seed originally came from the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joshi, Schultz|first=S.T &amp; D.E|title=A HP Lovecraft Encyclopedia|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=097487891X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tree's sap can be [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] to create a potent drink. A stone trapdoor in these woods leads to the top of the [[Tower of Koth]] and from there into the kingdom of the [[Underworld (Dreamlands)#Gugs|Gugs]] in the [[Underworld (Dreamlands)|Underworld]]. However, because of a curse of the [[Great Ones]], no Gug may exit through this portal.

'''The Polar Geospatial Center''' is a research center at the [[University of Minnesota]]'s [[University of Minnesota College of Science and Engineering|College of Science and Engineering]] funded by the [[National Science Foundation|National Science Foundation's]] Office of Polar Programs. Founded in 2007, the Polar Geospatial Center "provides geospatial support, mapping, and GIS/remote sensing solutions to researchers and logistics groups in the polar science community." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pgc.umn.edu/about/|title=About the PGC|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently directed by Paul Morin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pgc.umn.edu/about/people/paul-morin/|title=Paul Morin|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Polar Geospatial Center (PGC) was founded in 2007 and was originally called the Antarctic Geospatial Information Center (AGIC). In its early days, the AGIC's goal was to provide basic mapping and [[Geographic Information System|GIS]] services for the [[United States Antarctic Program]] (USAP), and was only a two-man project. As time went on, the program's credibility and size expanded. By 2010, the program had over a half dozen team members. In March 2011, the program was "classified as a National Science Foundation cooperative agreement" and adapted to take responsibility for [[Arctic]] as well as [[Antarctic]] operations, hence the name change to PGC.

==Services==
The PGC's current goal is to support federally funded researchers in the Arctic and Antarctic. The PGC utilizes [[Geospatial technology|geospatial]] and [[remote sensing]] technology to work with research teams and solve problems. Some specific examples of services are listed below.

===Image delivery &amp; analysis===
The PGC has a large collection of both satellite imagery as well as aerial photography at various resolutions. The PGC provides commercial satellite imagery for United States federally-funded polar researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pgc.umn.edu/data/|title=Data + Services|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital Elevation Models===
The PGC provides high-resolution [[digital elevation model]]s (DEMs) derived from stereoscopic optical imagery. The ArcticDEM project, an 8-meter posting pan-Arctic DEM, was announced by [[Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]] on September 3, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4549841/arctic-dem|title=President Obama on Climate Change in Alaska|last=|first=|date=Sep 3, 2015|work=C-SPAN|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Custom map requests===
The PGC employs individuals skilled in [[cartography]] and [[Geographic information system|GIS]] to create custom maps of areas for researchers preparing to head into the field.

===Map collection===
The PGC Map Catalog hosts thousands of Antarctic and Arctic maps in digital form. These maps are from many different organizations and periods in time. Many of these maps are publicly available, some are not and may be provided upon request.

[[Image:Wessex.png|thumb|400px|Locations in Wessex, from ''The Wessex of Thomas Hardy'' by Bertram Windle, 1902, based on correspondence with Hardy.]]
The English author [[Thomas Hardy]] set all of his major novels in the south and [[South West England|southwest]] of England. He named the area "'''Wessex'''" after [[Wessex|the medieval Anglo-Saxon kingdom]] that existed in this part of that country prior to the unification of England by [[Æthelstan]].  Although the places that appear in his novels actually exist, in many cases he gave the place a fictional name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Map of Thomas Hardy's Wessex|url=http://www.bl.uk/collection-items/map-of-thomas-hardys-wessex|publisher=British Library|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Hardy's home town of [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] is called Casterbridge in his books, notably in ''[[The Mayor of Casterbridge]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Birchall|first1=Eugene|title=Wessex Place Names|url=http://www.eugenebirchall.co.uk/page80.html|publisher=Wessex Photos|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Introduction To Hardy's Wessex|url=http://south-coast-central.co.uk/hardy.htm|publisher=South Coast Central|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an 1895 preface to the novel ''[[Far From the Madding Crowd]]'' he described Wessex as ''"a merely realistic dream country"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploring Thomas Hardy's West Dorset|url=http://www.visit-dorset.com/dbimgs/Hardy%20Country%20leaflet%2005%2006%20-%20web.pdf|publisher=Visit Dorset|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual definition of "Hardy's Wessex" varied widely throughout Hardy's career, and was not definitively settled until after he retired from writing novels. When he created the concept of a fictional Wessex, it consisted merely of the small area of Dorset in which Hardy grew up; by the time he wrote ''[[Jude the Obscure]]'', the boundaries had extended to include all of [[Dorset]], [[Wiltshire]], [[Somerset]], [[Devon]], [[Hampshire]], much of [[Berkshire]], and some of [[Oxfordshire]], with its most north-easterly point being [[Oxford]] (renamed "Christminster" in the novel). [[Cornwall]] was also referred to but named "Off Wessex". Similarly, the nature and significance of ideas of "Wessex" were developed over a long series of novels through a lengthy period of time. The idea of Wessex plays an important artistic role in Hardy's works (particularly his later novels), assisting the presentation of themes of progress, primitivism, sexuality, religion, nature and naturalism; however, this is complicated by the economic role Wessex played in Hardy's career. Considering himself primarily to be a poet, Hardy wrote novels mostly to earn money. Books that could be marketed under the Hardy brand of "Wessex novels" were particularly lucrative, which gave rise to a tendency to sentimentalised, picturesque, populist descriptions of Wessex – which, as a glance through most tourist giftshops in the south-west will reveal, remain popular with consumers today.

Hardy's resurrection of the name "Wessex" is largely responsible for the popular modern use of the term to describe the south-west region of England (with the exception of Cornwall and arguably Devon); today, a panoply of organisations take their name from Hardy to describe their relationship to the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Hardy's Wessex?|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~bp10/wessex/introduction/|publisher=University of St Andrews|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardy's conception of [[Wessex]] as a separate, cohesive geographical and political identity has proved powerful, despite the fact it was originally created purely as an artistic conceit, and has spawned a lucrative tourist trade, and even a devolutionist [[Wessex Regionalist Party]].

(Note: The [[Isle of Wight]], although today a separate administrative county, was considered to be a part of the county of Hampshire – and thus Upper Wessex – during Thomas Hardy's lifetime. Likewise, Alfredston ([[Wantage]]) and the surrounding area in North Wessex was part of Berkshire prior to the 1974 boundary changes but now lies in [[Oxfordshire]].)

Outer Wessex is sometimes referred to as Nether Wessex.

'''Tibet''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Tibet.ogg|t|ɪ|ˈ|b|ɛ|t}}; {{bo|t=བོད་|l=/pʰøː˨˧˩/|p=Bod}}; {{zh|s=西藏||p=Xīzàng}}) is a [[historical region]] covering much of the [[Tibetan Plateau]] in [[Inner Asia]]. It is the traditional homeland of the [[Tibetan people]] as well as some other [[ethnic group]]s such as [[Monpa people|Monpa]], [[Tamang]], [[Qiang people|Qiang]], [[Sherpa people|sherpa]], and [[Lhoba people]]s and is now also inhabited by considerable numbers of [[Han Chinese]] and [[Hui people]]. Tibet is the highest region on Earth, with an average elevation of {{convert|4900|m|sigfig=2}}.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The highest elevation in Tibet is [[Mount Everest]], Earth's highest mountain, rising 8,848 m (29,029&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level.

The [[Tibetan Empire]] emerged in the 7th century, but with the fall of the empire the region soon divided into a variety of [[Territory (geographic region)|territories]]. The bulk of western and central Tibet ([[Ü-Tsang]]) was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in [[Lhasa (prefecture-level city)|Lhasa]], [[Shigatse]], or nearby locations; these governments were at various times under [[Mongols|Mongol]] and [[China|Chinese]] overlordship. Thus Tibet remained a [[suzerainty]] of the Mongol and later Chinese rulers in Nanjing and Beijing, with reasonable autonomy given to the Tibetan leaders.&lt;ref name="frontline"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ram|first1=N|title=TIBET - A REALITY CHECK|url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/ceun/eng/gyzg/xizang/t425651.htm|accessdate=15 September 2017|issue=18|publisher=Frontline|date=2 September 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915161131/http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/ceun/eng/gyzg/xizang/t425651.htm#|archive-date=September 15, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eastern regions of [[Kham]] and [[Amdo]] often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure, being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups, while also often falling more directly under Chinese rule after the [[Battle of Chamdo]]; most of this area was eventually incorporated into the Chinese provinces of [[Sichuan]] and [[Qinghai]]. The current borders of Tibet were generally established in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Melvyn, C.,''Change, Conflict and Continuity among a Community of Nomadic Pastoralist: A Case Study from Western Tibet, 1950–1990'', 1994: "What is Tibet? – Fact and Fancy", pp. 76-87&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Xinhai Revolution]] against the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1912, Qing soldiers were disarmed and escorted out of [[Tibet Area (administrative division)|Tibet Area]] (Ü-Tsang). The region subsequently [[:wikisource:Proclamation of Independence of Tibet|declared its independence]] in 1913 without recognition by the subsequent [[Government of the Republic of China|Chinese Republican government]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Gregory, "''In fear of China''", 1969, saying: ' ''Tibet, although enjoying independence at certain periods of its history, had never been recognised by any single foreign power as an independent state. The closest it has ever come to such recognition was the British formula of 1943: [[suzerainty]], combined with [[autonomy]] and the right to enter into diplomatic relations.'' '&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Lhasa took control of the western part of [[Xikang]], China. The region maintained its autonomy until 1951 when, following the [[Battle of Chamdo]], Tibet became [[Incorporation of Tibet into the People's Republic of China|incorporated into the People's Republic of China]], and the previous Tibetan government was abolished in 1959 after a failed uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-14533879|title=Q&amp;A: China and the Tibetans|date=2011-08-15|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-05-17|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180716034707/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-14533879#|archive-date=July 16, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, China governs western and central Tibet as the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] while the eastern areas are now mostly [[autonomous prefectures of China|ethnic autonomous prefectures]] within [[Sichuan]], [[Qinghai]] and other neighbouring provinces.

The economy of Tibet is dominated by [[subsistence agriculture]], though [[tourism]] has become a growing industry in recent decades.

Tibetan Buddhism is a primary influence on the [[Tibetan art|art]], [[Music of Tibet|music]], and [[Tibetan festivals|festivals]] of the region. Tibetan architecture reflects [[Chinese architecture|Chinese]] and [[Architecture of India|Indian]] influences. Staple foods in Tibet are roasted [[barley]], [[yak]] meat, and [[butter tea]].

== Names ==
{{Main|Definitions of Tibet}}

The [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] name for their land,  ''Bod'' {{Bo-textonly|བོད་}}, means "Tibet" or "[[Tibetan Plateau]]", although it originally meant the central region{{Citation needed|reason=Please, provide a source for this statement|date=June 2017}} around [[Lhasa (prefecture-level city)|Lhasa]], now known in Tibetan as [[Ü (region)|Ü]]. The [[Standard Tibetan]] pronunciation of ''Bod'', {{IPA-bo|pʰøʔ˨˧˨|}}, is transcribed ''Bhö'' in [[Tournadre Phonetic Transcription]], ''Bö'' in the [[THL Simplified Phonetic Transcription]] and ''Poi'' in [[Tibetan pinyin]]. Some scholars believe the first written reference to ''Bod'' "Tibet" was the ancient ''Bautai'' people recorded in the Egyptian Greek works ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' (1st century CE) and ''[[Geographia]]'' ([[Ptolemy]], 2nd century CE),&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith (1987), pg. 7&lt;/ref&gt; itself from the [[Sanskrit]] form ''Bhauṭṭa'' of the Indian geographical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Étienne de la Vaissière, "The Triple System of Orography in Ptolemy's Xinjiang", ''Exegisti Monumenta: Festschrif in Honour of Nicholas Sims-Williams'', eds. Werner Sundermann, Almut Hintze &amp; François de Blois (Wiesbaden, Germany: Harrassowitz, 2009), 532.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern [[Standard Chinese]] [[exonym]] for the ethnic Tibetan region is ''Zangqu'' ({{zh|s=[[Wikt:藏区|藏区]]|hp=Zàngqū|links=no}}), which derives by [[metonymy]] from the [[Ü-Tsang|Tsang]] region around [[Shigatse]] plus the addition of a Chinese suffix, 区 ''qū'', which means "area, district, region, ward". Tibetan people, language, and culture, regardless of where they are from, are referred to as ''Zang'' ({{zh|s=[[Wikt:藏|藏]]|hp=Zàng|links=no}}) although the geographical term ''Xīzàng'' is often limited to the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]]. The term ''Xīzàng'' was coined during the [[Qing dynasty]] in the reign of the [[Jiaqing Emperor]] (1796–1820) through the addition of a prefix meaning "west" (西 ''xī'') to ''Zang''.

The best-known medieval Chinese name for Tibet is ''Tubo'' ({{zh|s=[[Wikt:吐蕃|吐蕃]]|links=no}} also written as {{lang|zh-hans-CN|[[Wikt:土蕃|土蕃]]}} or {{lang|zh-hans-CN|[[Wikt:土番|土番]]}}; {{zh|hp=Tǔbō|links=no}} or {{lang|zh|Tǔfān}}). This name first appears [[Transliteration into Chinese characters|in Chinese characters]] as {{lang|zh-hans-CN|土番}} in the 7th century ([[Li Tai]]) and as {{lang|zh-hans-CN|吐蕃}} in the 10th-century (''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' describing 608–609 emissaries from Tibetan King [[Namri Songtsen]] to [[Emperor Yang of Sui]]). In the [[Middle Chinese]] spoken during that period, as reconstructed by [[William H. Baxter]], {{lang|zh-hans-CN|土番}} was pronounced ''thu{{Smallcaps|x}}-phjon'' and {{lang|zh-hans-CN|吐蕃}} was pronounced ''thu{{Smallcaps|x}}-pjon'' (with the {{Smallcaps|x}} representing [[phonemic tone|tone]]).&lt;ref name="Baxter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wbaxter/etymdict.html |title=An Etymological Dictionary of Common Chinese Characters |last1=Baxter |first1=William H. |date=2001-03-30 |accessdate=2011-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411153909/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wbaxter/etymdict.html |archivedate=April 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other pre-modern Chinese names for Tibet include ''Wusiguo'' ({{zh|s=烏斯國|hp=Wūsīguó|links=no}}; cf. Tibetan ''dbus'', [[Ü (region)|Ü]], {{IPA-bo|wyʔ˨˧˨|}}), ''Wusizang'' ({{zh|s=烏斯藏|hp=wūsīzàng|links=no}}, cf. Tibetan ''dbus-gtsang'', [[Ü-Tsang]]), ''Tubote'' ({{zh|s=圖伯特|hp=Túbótè|links=no}}), and ''Tanggute'' ({{zh|s=唐古忒|hp=Tánggǔtè|links=no}}, cf. [[Tangut people|Tangut]]). American Tibetologist [[Elliot Sperling]] has argued in favor of a recent tendency by some authors writing in Chinese to revive the term ''Tubote'' ({{zh|s=图伯特|t=圖伯特|hp=Túbótè|links=no}}) for modern use in place of ''Xizang'', on the grounds that ''Tubote'' more clearly includes the entire Tibetan plateau rather than simply the Tibet Autonomous Region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://sites.google.com/site/tibetanpoliticalreview/articles/tubotetibetandthepowerofnaming | title=Tubote, Tibet, and the Power of Naming | website=Tibetan Political Review | author=Dr. Elliot Sperling | access-date=July 31, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328133904/https://sites.google.com/site/tibetanpoliticalreview/articles/tubotetibetandthepowerofnaming# | archive-date=March 28, 2016 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English word ''Tibet'' or ''Thibet'' dates back to the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;The word "Tibet" was used in the context of the first British mission to this country under George Bogle in 1774. See Clements R. Markham (ede.): ''Narratives of the Mission of George Bogle to Tibet and the Journey of Thomas Manning to Lhasa'', reprinted by Manjushri Publishing House, New Delhi, 1971 (first published in 1876)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Historical linguistics|Historical linguists]] generally agree that "Tibet" names in European languages are [[loanword]]s from [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Ṭībat}}'' or''{{transl|ar|ALA|Tūbātt}}'' ({{lang|ar|طيبة، توبات}}) ({{lang|he|טובּה, טובּת}}), itself deriving from [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] ''{{lang|trk|Töbäd}}'', literally: "The Heights" (plural of ''{{lang|trk|töbän}}'').&lt;ref&gt;Behr, Wolfgang, (1994). "Stephan V. Beyer ''The Classical Tibetan Language'' (book review)", ''Oriens'' 34, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NHN6KTAVR28C&amp;pg=PA559&amp;dq=t%C3%B6p%C3%BCt&amp;lr=&amp;hl=tr&amp;sig=x1RLRVdRn9zBxkX84i5X45GZh84 pp. 558–559]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==
{{Main|Standard Tibetan}}

Linguists generally classify the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]] as a [[Tibeto-Burman]] language of the [[Sino-Tibetan language]] family although the boundaries between 'Tibetan' and certain other [[Himalaya]]n languages can be unclear. According to [[Matthew Kapstein]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;
From the perspective of historical linguistics, Tibetan most closely resembles [[Burmese language|Burmese]] among the major languages of Asia. Grouping these two together with other apparently related languages spoken in the [[Himalaya]]n lands, as well as in the highlands of Southeast Asia and the Sino-Tibetan frontier regions, linguists have generally concluded that there exists a Tibeto-Burman family of languages. More controversial is the theory that the Tibeto-Burman family is itself part of a larger language family, called [[Sino-Tibetan language family|Sino-Tibetan]], and that through it Tibetan and Burmese are distant cousins of Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein 2006, pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:People of Tibet46.jpg|thumb|Tibetan family in [[Kham]] attending a horse festival]]
The language has numerous regional dialects which are generally not mutually intelligible. It is employed throughout the Tibetan plateau and [[Bhutan]] and is also spoken in parts of [[Nepal]] and northern India, such as [[Sikkim]]. In general, the dialects of central Tibet (including Lhasa), [[Kham]], [[Amdo]] and some smaller nearby areas are considered Tibetan dialects. Other forms, particularly [[Dzongkha]], [[Sikkimese language|Sikkimese]], [[Sherpa language|Sherpa]], and [[Ladakhi language|Ladakhi]], are considered by their speakers, largely for political reasons, to be separate languages. However, if the latter group of Tibetan-type languages are included in the calculation, then 'greater Tibetan' is spoken by approximately 6&amp;nbsp;million people across the Tibetan Plateau. Tibetan is also spoken by approximately 150,000 exile speakers who have fled from modern-day Tibet to India and other countries.

Although spoken Tibetan varies according to the region, the written language, based on [[Classical Tibetan]], is consistent throughout. This is probably due to the long-standing influence of the Tibetan empire, whose rule embraced (and extended at times far beyond) the present Tibetan linguistic area, which runs from northern [[Pakistan]] in the west to [[Yunnan]] and [[Sichuan]] in the east, and from north of [[Qinghai Lake]] south as far as Bhutan. The Tibetan language has its [[Tibetan script|own script]] which it shares with [[Ladakhi language|Ladakhi]] and [[Dzongkha language|Dzongkha]], and which is derived from the ancient Indian [[Brāhmī script]].&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein 2006, pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2001, the local [[deaf sign language]]s of Tibet were standardized, and [[Tibetan Sign Language]] is now being promoted across the country.

The first Tibetan-English dictionary and grammar book was written by [[Sándor Kőrösi Csoma|Alexander Csoma de Kőrös]] in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a78IAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=csoma&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=csoma&amp;f=false Essay towards a Dictionary, Tibetan and English.

=== Early history ===
{{Main|Neolithic Tibet|Zhangzhung|Pre-Imperial Tibet}}
Humans inhabited the Tibetan Plateau at least 21,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Zhao"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhao | first1 = M | last2 = Kong | first2 = QP | last3 = Wang | first3 = HW | last4 = Peng | first4 = MS | last5 = Xie | first5 = XD | last6 = Wang | first6 = WZ | last7 = Jiayang | first7 = Duan JG | last8 = Cai | first8 = MC | last9 = Zhao | first9 = SN | last10 = Cidanpingcuo | first10 = Tu YQ | last11 = Wu | first11 = SF | last12 = Yao | first12 = YG | last13 = Bandelt | first13 = HJ | last14 = Zhang | first14 = YP | year = 2009 | title = Mitochondrial genome evidence reveals successful Late Paleolithic settlement on the Tibetan Plateau | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 106 | issue = 50| pages = 21230–21235 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0907844106 | pmid = 19955425 | pmc=2795552}}&lt;/ref&gt; This population was largely replaced around 3,000 [[Before Present|BP]] by [[Neolithic]] immigrants from northern China, but there is a partial genetic continuity between the Paleolithic inhabitants and contemporary Tibetan populations.&lt;ref name="Zhao"/&gt;

The earliest Tibetan historical texts identify the [[Zhang Zhung culture]] as a people who migrated from the Amdo region into what is now the region of [[Guge]] in western Tibet.&lt;ref name="Norbu"&gt;Norbu 1989, pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang Zhung is considered to be the original home of the [[Bön]] religion.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;Helmut Hoffman in McKay 2003 vol. 1, pp. 45–68&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1st century BCE, a neighboring kingdom arose in the [[Yarlung Valley|Yarlung valley]], and the Yarlung king, [[Drigum Tsenpo]], attempted to remove the influence of the Zhang Zhung by expelling the Zhang's Bön priests from Yarlung.&lt;ref name="Karmay"&gt;Karmey 2001, p. 66ff&lt;/ref&gt; He was assassinated and Zhang Zhung continued its dominance of the region until it was annexed by Songtsen Gampo in the 7th century. Prior to [[Songtsen Gampo]], the kings of Tibet were more mythological than factual, and there is insufficient evidence of their existence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erik Haarh|Haarh, Erik]]: ''Extract from "The Yar Lun Dynasty"'', in: ''The History of Tibet'', ed.

=== Tibetan Empire ===
{{main|Tibetan Empire}}
[[File:Tibetan empire greatest extent 780s-790s CE.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the Tibetan Empire at its greatest extent between the 780s and the 790s CE]]
The history of a unified Tibet begins with the rule of [[Songtsen Gampo]] (604–650{{nbsp}}CE), who united parts of the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River (Tibet)|Yarlung River]] Valley and founded the Tibetan Empire. He also brought in many reforms, and Tibetan power spread rapidly, creating a large and powerful empire. It is traditionally considered that his first wife was the Princess of Nepal, [[Bhrikuti]], and that she played a great role in the establishment of Buddhism in Tibet. In 640 he married [[Princess Wencheng]], the niece of the powerful Chinese emperor [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Taizong of Tang China]].&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Andrew ; Henley, David (2011). 'The First Tibetan Empire' in: ''China's Ancient Tea Horse Road''. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. ASIN: B005DQV7Q2&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the next few Tibetan kings, Buddhism became established as the state religion and Tibetan power increased even further over large areas of [[Central Asia]], while major inroads were made into Chinese territory, even reaching the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]]'s capital [[Chang'an]] (modern [[Xi'an]]) in late 763.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith 1987, pg. 146&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Tibetan occupation of Chang'an only lasted for fifteen days, after which they were defeated by Tang and its ally, the Turkic [[Uyghur Khaganate]].

[[File:Miran Fort BLP466 PHOTO1187 2 60.jpg|thumb|left|[[Miran fort]]]]

The [[Kingdom of Nanzhao]] (in [[Yunnan]] and neighbouring regions) remained under Tibetan control from 750 to 794, when they turned on their Tibetan overlords and helped the Chinese inflict a serious defeat on the Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, Thomas A. (1978). "Nanchao and Tibet in South-western China and Central Asia." ''The Tibet Journal''. Vol. 3, No. 4. Winter 1978, pp. 13–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 747, the hold of Tibet was loosened by the campaign of general [[Gao Xianzhi]], who tried to re-open the direct communications between Central Asia and [[Kashmir]]. By 750, the Tibetans had lost almost all of their central Asian possessions to the [[Tang dynasty|Chinese]]. However, after Gao Xianzhi's defeat by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Arabs]] and [[Karluks|Qarluqs]] at the [[Battle of Talas]] (751) and the subsequent [[civil war]] known as the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] (755), Chinese influence decreased rapidly and Tibetan influence resumed.

At its height in the 780's to 790's the Tibetan Empire reached its highest glory when it ruled and controlled a territory stretching from modern day Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma, China, India,  Nepal, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan.

In 821/822{{nbsp}}CE Tibet and China signed a peace treaty. A bilingual account of this treaty, including details of the borders between the two countries, is inscribed on a stone pillar which stands outside the [[Jokhang]] temple in Lhasa.&lt;ref&gt;'A Corpus of Early Tibetan Inscriptions''. H. E. Richardson. Royal Asiatic Society (1985), pp. 106–43. {{ISBN|0-947593-00-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tibet continued as a Central Asian empire until the mid-9th century, when a civil war over succession led to the collapse of imperial Tibet. The period that followed is known traditionally as the ''[[Era of Fragmentation]]'', when political control over Tibet became divided between regional warlords and tribes with no dominant centralized authority. An [[Tibetan Expedition of Islamic Bengal|Islamic invasion]] from Bengal took place in 1206.

=== Yuan dynasty ===
{{main|Mongol conquest of Tibet|Tibet under Yuan rule}}
[[File:Yuen Dynasty 1294 - Goryeo as vassal.png|thumb|upright=1.35|The Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]], c. 1294.]]
The Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]], through the [[Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs]], or Xuanzheng Yuan, ruled Tibet through a top-level administrative department. One of the department's purposes was to select a ''[[dpon-chen]]'' ('great administrator'), usually appointed by the lama and confirmed by the Mongol emperor in Beijing.&lt;ref name="China's Tibet Policy"&gt;Dawa Norbu. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kD8gTL6IIDYC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=Xuanzheng+Yuan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wMA6Te6OLcGBlAf4kOCFBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Xuanzheng%20Yuan&amp;f=false China's Tibet Policy]'', pp. 139. Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sakya]] lama retained a degree of autonomy, acting as the political authority of the region, while the ''dpon-chen'' held administrative and military power. Mongol rule of Tibet remained separate from the main provinces of China, but the region existed [[Tibet under Yuan rule|under the administration of the Yuan dynasty]]. If the Sakya lama ever came into conflict with the ''dpon-chen'', the ''dpon-chen'' had the authority to send Chinese troops into the region.&lt;ref name="China's Tibet Policy"/&gt;

Tibet retained nominal power over religious and regional political affairs, while the Mongols managed a structural and administrative&lt;ref&gt;Wylie. p.104: 'To counterbalance the political power of the lama, Khubilai appointed civil administrators at the Sa-skya to supervise the mongol regency.'&lt;/ref&gt; rule over the region, reinforced by the rare military intervention. This existed as a "[[diarchy|diarchic]] structure" under the Yuan emperor, with power primarily in favor of the Mongols.&lt;ref name="China's Tibet Policy"/&gt; Mongolian prince [[Khuden]] gained temporal power in Tibet in the 1240s and sponsored [[Sakya Pandita]], whose seat became the capital of Tibet. [[Drogön Chögyal Phagpa]], Sakya Pandita's nephew became [[Imperial Preceptor]] of [[Kublai Khan]], founder of the Yuan dynasty.

Yuan control over the region ended with the Ming overthrow of the Yuan and [[Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen]]'s revolt against the Mongols.&lt;ref name="Rossabi194"&gt;Rossabi 1983, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Following the uprising, Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen founded the [[Phagmodrupa Dynasty]], and sought to reduce Yuan influences over Tibetan culture and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Norbu, Dawa (2001) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phagmodrupa, Rinpungpa and Tsangpa Dynasties ===
{{main|Phagmodrupa Dynasty|Rinpungpa|Tsangpa}}
{{further|Sino-Tibetan relations during the Ming dynasty}}

[[File:Gyantse Dzong4.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Gyantse Fortress]]]]

Between 1346 and 1354, Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen toppled the Sakya and founded the Phagmodrupa Dynasty. The following 80 years saw the founding of the [[Gelug]] school (also known as Yellow Hats) by the disciples of [[Je Tsongkhapa]], and the founding of the important [[Ganden Monastery|Ganden]], [[Drepung Monastery|Drepung]] and [[Sera Monastery|Sera]] monasteries near Lhasa. However, internal strife within the dynasty and the strong localism of the various fiefs and political-religious factions led to a long series of internal conflicts. The minister family [[Rinpungpa]], based in [[Ü-Tsang|Tsang]] (West Central Tibet), dominated politics after 1435. In 1565 they were overthrown by the [[Tsangpa]] Dynasty of [[Shigatse]] which expanded its power in different directions of Tibet in the following decades and favoured the [[Karma Kagyu]] sect.

{{Main|Ganden Phodrang}}
In 1578, [[Altan Khan]] of the [[Tümed]] Mongols gave [[3rd Dalai Lama|Sonam Gyatso]], a high lama of the Gelugpa school, the name ''[[Dalai Lama]]'', ''Dalai'' being the Mongolian translation of the Tibetan name ''Gyatso'' "Ocean".&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2006, pp. 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[5th Dalai Lama]] is known for unifying the Tibetan heartland under the control of the [[Gelug]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], after defeating the rival [[Kagyu]] and [[Jonang]] sects and the secular ruler, the [[Tsangpa]] prince, in a prolonged civil war. His efforts were successful in part because of aid from [[Güshi Khan]], the [[Oirats|Oirat]] leader of the [[Khoshut Khanate]]. With Güshi Khan as a largely uninvolved overlord, the 5th Dalai Lama and his intimates established a civil administration which is referred to by historians as the ''Lhasa state''. This Tibetan regime or government is also referred to as the [[Ganden Phodrang]].

=== Qing dynasty ===
{{main|Chinese expedition to Tibet (1720)|Tibet under Qing rule}}

[[File:布达拉宫.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Potala Palace]]

[[Qing dynasty]] rule in Tibet began with their [[Chinese expedition to Tibet (1720)|1720 expedition to the country]] when they expelled the invading [[Dzungar Khanate|Dzungars]]. [[Amdo]] came under Qing control in 1724, and eastern [[Kham]] was incorporated into neighbouring Chinese provinces in 1728.&lt;ref name="Wang 162-6"&gt;Wang Jiawei, "[[The Historical Status of China's Tibet]]", 2000, pp. 162–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Qing government sent resident commissioners called ''[[Amban]]s'' to Lhasa. In 1750 the Ambans and the majority of the [[Han Chinese]] and [[Manchus]] living in Lhasa were killed in [[Lhasa riot of 1750|a riot]], and Qing troops arrived quickly and suppressed the rebels in the next year. Like the preceding Yuan dynasty, the Manchus of the Qing dynasty exerted military and administrative control of the region, while granting it a degree of political autonomy. The Qing commander publicly executed a number of supporters of the rebels and, as in 1723 and 1728, made changes in the political structure and drew up a formal organization plan. The Qing now restored the Dalai Lama as ruler, leading the governing council called ''[[Kashag]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Kychanov, E.I. and Melnichenko, B.I. Istoriya Tibeta s drevneishikh vremen do nashikh dnei [History of Tibet since Ancient Times to Present]. Moscow: Russian Acad. Sci. Publ., p.89-92&lt;/ref&gt; but elevated the role of ''Ambans'' to include more direct involvement in Tibetan internal affairs. At the same time the Qing took steps to counterbalance the power of the aristocracy by adding officials recruited from the clergy to key posts.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein 1997, pg. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

For several decades, peace reigned in Tibet, but in 1792 the Qing [[Qianlong Emperor]] sent [[Sino-Nepalese War|a large Chinese army into Tibet]] to push the invading [[Nepal]]ese out. This prompted yet another Qing reorganization of the Tibetan government, this time through a written plan called the "Twenty-Nine Regulations for Better Government in Tibet". Qing military garrisons staffed with Qing troops were now also established near the Nepalese border.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein 1997, pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Tibet was dominated by the Manchus in various stages in the 18th century, and the years immediately following the 1792 regulations were the peak of the Qing imperial commissioners' authority; but there was no attempt to make Tibet a Chinese province.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein 1997, pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834 the [[Sikh Empire]] invaded and annexed [[Ladakh]], a culturally Tibetan region that was an independent kingdom at the time. Seven years later a Sikh army led by [[General Zorawar Singh]] invaded western Tibet from Ladakh, starting the [[Sino-Sikh War]]. A Qing-Tibetan army repelled the invaders but was in turn defeated when it chased the Sikhs into Ladakh. The war ended with the signing of the [[Treaty of Chushul]] between the Chinese and Sikh empires.&lt;ref&gt;The Sino-Indian Border Disputes, by Alfred P. Rubin, The International and Comparative Law Quarterly, Vol. 9, No. 1. (Jan., 1960), pp. 96–125.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Qing dynasty weakened, its authority over Tibet also gradually declined, and by the mid-19th century its influence was minuscule. Qing authority over Tibet had become more symbolic than real by the late 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein 1989, pg. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein 1997, pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brunnert, H.

This period also saw some contacts with [[Jesuits]] and [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]] from Europe, and in 1774 a Scottish nobleman, [[George Bogle (diplomat)|George Bogle]], came to [[Shigatse]] to investigate prospects of trade for the [[British East India Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Teltscher 2006, pg. 57&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 19th century the situation of foreigners in Tibet grew more tenuous. The [[British Empire]] was encroaching from northern [[India]] into the [[Himalayas]], the [[Emirate of Afghanistan]] and the [[Russian Empire]] were expanding into Central Asia and each power became suspicious of the others' intentions in Tibet.

In 1904, a [[British expedition to Tibet]], spurred in part by a fear that [[Russia]] was extending its power into Tibet as part of [[The Great Game]], invaded the country, hoping that negotiations with the [[13th Dalai Lama]] would be more effective than with Chinese representatives.&lt;ref name="smith154-6"&gt;Smith 1996, pp. 154–6&lt;/ref&gt; When the British-led invasion reached Tibet on December 12, 1903, an armed confrontation with the ethnic Tibetans resulted in the [[British expedition to Tibet#The massacre of Chumik Shenko|Massacre of Chumik Shenko]], which resulted in 600 fatalities amongst the Tibetan forces, compared to only 12 on the British side.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-04/06/content_7929882.htm Interview: British invasions probed as root cause of Tibetan separatism_English_Xinhua] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716055704/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-04/06/content_7929882.htm |date=July 16, 2012 }}.

In 1910, the Qing government sent [[Chinese expedition to Tibet (1910)|a military expedition of its own]] under [[Zhao Erfeng]] to establish direct Manchu-Chinese rule and, in an imperial edict, deposed the Dalai Lama, who fled to British India. Zhao Erfeng defeated the Tibetan military conclusively and expelled the Dalai Lama's forces from the province. His actions were unpopular, and there was much animosity against him for his mistreatment of civilians and disregard for local culture.

The Indus and Brahmaputra rivers originate from a lake (Tib: Tso Mapham) in Western Tibet, near [[Mount Kailash]]. The mountain is a holy pilgrimage site for both [[Hindu]]s and Tibetans. The Hindus consider the mountain to be the abode of [[Lord Shiva]]. The Tibetan name for Mt. Kailash is Khang Rinpoche. Tibet has numerous high-altitude lakes referred to in Tibetan as ''tso'' or ''co''. These include [[Qinghai Lake]], [[Lake Manasarovar]], [[Namtso]], [[Pangong Tso]], [[Yamdrok Lake]], [[Siling Co]], [[Lhamo La-tso]], [[Lumajangdong Co]], [[Lake Puma Yumco]], [[Lake Paiku]], [[Como Chamling]], [[Lake Rakshastal]], [[Dagze Co]] and [[Dong Co]]. The Qinghai Lake (Koko Nor) is the largest lake in the People's Republic of China.

The atmosphere is severely dry nine months of the year, and average annual snowfall is only {{convert|18|inch|cm}}, due to the [[rain shadow|rain shadow effect]]. Western passes receive small amounts of fresh snow each year but remain traversible all year round. Low temperatures are prevalent throughout these western regions, where bleak desolation is unrelieved by any vegetation bigger than a low bush, and where wind sweeps unchecked across vast expanses of arid plain. The Indian [[monsoon]] exerts some influence on eastern Tibet. Northern Tibet is subject to high temperatures in the summer and intense cold in the winter.

Cultural Tibet consists of several regions. These include Amdo (''A mdo'') in the northeast, which is administratively part of the provinces of Qinghai, Gansu and Sichuan. Kham (''Khams'') in the southeast encompasses parts of western Sichuan, northern [[Yunnan]], southern Qinghai and the eastern part of the Tibet Autonomous Region. [[Ü-Tsang]] (''dBus gTsang'') (Ü in the center, Tsang in the center-west, and Ngari (''mNga' ris'') in the far west) covered the central and western portion of Tibet Autonomous Region.&lt;ref&gt;Petech, L., [https://books.google.com/books?id=V1GkmBOQLkAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;sig=6eAnf2zWcz7L113XKhOc8cCv8MI ''China and Tibet in the Early XVIIIth Century: History of the Establishment of Chinese Protectorate in Tibet''], p51 &amp; p98&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibetan cultural influences extend to the neighboring states of [[Bhutan]], Nepal, regions of India such as [[Sikkim]], [[Ladakh]], [[Lahaul]], and [[Spiti]], Northern Pakistan [[Baltistan]] or [[Balti-yul]] in addition to designated Tibetan [[autonomous area]]s in adjacent Chinese provinces.

There are over 800 settlements in Tibet. [[Lhasa]] is Tibet's traditional capital and the capital of Tibet Autonomous Region. It contains two world heritage sites&amp;nbsp;– the [[Potala Palace]] and [[Norbulingka]], which were the residences of the Dalai Lama. Lhasa contains a number of significant temples and monasteries, including [[Jokhang]] and [[Ramoche Temple]].

[[Shigatse]] is the second largest city in the Tibet AR, west of Lhasa. [[Gyantse]] and [[Qamdo]] are also amongst the largest.

The central region of Tibet is an [[Autonomous areas of China|autonomous region]] within China, the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]]. The Tibet Autonomous Region is a province-level entity of the People's Republic of China. It is governed by a People's Government, led by a Chairman.

From January 18–20, 2010 a national conference on Tibet and areas inhabited by Tibetans in Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu and Qinghai was held in China and a substantial plan to improve development of the areas was announced.

Historically, the population of Tibet consisted of primarily ethnic [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] and some other ethnic groups. According to tradition the original ancestors of the Tibetan people, as represented by the six red bands in the [[Tibetan flag]], are: the Se, Mu, Dong, Tong, Dru and Ra. Other traditional ethnic groups with significant population or with the majority of the ethnic group residing in Tibet (excluding a [[Sino-Indian War|disputed area with India]]) include [[Bai people]], [[Blang people|Blang]], [[Bonans|Bonan]], [[Dongxiang people|Dongxiang]], [[Han Chinese|Han]], [[Hui people]], [[Lhoba]], [[Lisu people]], [[Miao people|Miao]], [[Mongols]], [[Monguor|Monguor (Tu people)]], [[Monpa people|Menba (Monpa)]], [[Mosuo]], [[Nakhi]], [[Qiang people|Qiang]], [[Nu people]], [[Pumi people|Pumi]], [[Salar people|Salar]], and [[Yi people]].

The proportion of the non-Tibetan population in Tibet is disputed.

Religion is extremely important to the Tibetans and has a strong influence over all aspects of their lives. [[Bön]] is the indigenous religion of Tibet, but has been almost eclipsed by Tibetan Buddhism, a distinctive form of [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]], which was introduced into Tibet from the Sanskrit Buddhist tradition of northern India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Conze |first= Edward |authorlink= Edward Conze |editor= |others= |title= A Short History of Buddhism |origyear= |month= |url= |edition= |series= |year=1993 |publisher=Oneworld |isbn=1-85168-066-7 |oclc= |id= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetan Buddhism is practiced not only in Tibet but also in [[Mongolia]], parts of northern India, the [[Buryat Republic]], the [[Tuva Republic]], and in the [[Republic of Kalmykia]] and some other parts of China.

Tibetan Buddhism has five main traditions (the suffix ''pa'' is comparable to "er" in English):

* '''[[Gelug|Gelug(pa)]]''', ''Way of Virtue'', also known casually as ''Yellow Hat'', whose spiritual head is the [[Ganden Tripa]] and whose temporal head is the [[Dalai Lama]]. Successive Dalai Lamas ruled Tibet from the mid-17th to mid-20th centuries. This order was founded in the 14th to 15th centuries by [[Je Tsongkhapa]], based on the foundations of the [[Kadampa]] tradition. Tsongkhapa was renowned for both his scholasticism and his virtue. The Dalai Lama belongs to the Gelugpa school, and is regarded as the embodiment of the Bodhisattva of Compassion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Avalokitesvara]], [[Chenrezig]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Kagyu|Kagyu(pa)]]''', ''Oral Lineage''. This contains one major subsect and one minor subsect. The first, the Dagpo Kagyu, encompasses those Kagyu schools that trace back to [[Gampopa]]. In turn, the Dagpo Kagyu consists of four major sub-sects: the [[Karma Kagyu]], headed by a [[Karmapa]], the Tsalpa Kagyu, the Barom Kagyu, and Pagtru Kagyu. The once-obscure [[Shangpa Kagyu]], which was famously represented by the 20th-century teacher [[Kalu Rinpoche]], traces its history back to the Indian master Niguma, sister of Kagyu lineage holder [[Naropa]]. This is an oral tradition which is very much concerned with the experiential dimension of meditation. Its most famous exponent was Milarepa, an 11th-century mystic.
* '''[[Nyingma|Nyingma(pa)]]''', ''The Ancient Ones''. This is the oldest, the original order founded by [[Padmasambhava]].
* '''[[Sakya|Sakya(pa)]]''', ''Grey Earth'', headed by the [[Sakya Trizin]], founded by Khon Konchog Gyalpo, a disciple of the great translator Drokmi Lotsawa. [[Sakya Pandita]] 1182–1251 CE was the great grandson of Khon Konchog Gyalpo. This school emphasizes scholarship.
* '''[[Jonang|Jonang(pa)]]''' Its origins in Tibet can be traced to early 12th century master [[Yumo Mikyo Dorje]], but became much wider known with the help of [[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen]], a monk originally trained in the [[Sakya]] school. The Jonang school was widely thought to have become extinct in the late 17th century at the hands of the [[5th Dalai Lama]], who forcibly annexed the Jonang monasteries to his [[Gelug]] school, declaring them heretical. Thus, [[Tibetology|Tibetologists]] were astonished when fieldwork turned up several active Jonangpa monasteries, including the main monastery, Tsangwa, located in Zamtang County, Sichuan. Almost 40 monasteries, comprising about 5000 monks, have subsequently been found, including some in the [[Amdo Tibetan]] and [[Qiang people|rGyalgrong]] areas of [[Qinghai]], Sichuan and Tibet. One of the primary supporters of the Jonang lineage in exile has been the [[14th Dalai Lama]] of the Gelugpa lineage. The Jonang tradition has recently officially registered with the [[Central Tibetan Administration|Tibetan Government]] in exile to be recognized as the fifth living Buddhist tradition of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. The 14th Dalai Lama assigned [[Jebtsundamba Khutuktu]] of Mongolia (who is considered to be an incarnation of Taranatha) as the leader of the Jonang tradition.

==== Christianity ====
The first Christians documented to have reached Tibet were the [[Nestorian Christians|Nestorians]], of whom various remains and inscriptions have been found in Tibet. They were also present at the imperial camp of [[Möngke Khan]] at Shira Ordo, where they debated in 1256 with [[Karma Pakshi]] (1204/6-83), head of the [[Karma Kagyu]] order.&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein 2006, pp. 31, 71, 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein 1972, pp. 36, 77–78&lt;/ref&gt; Desideri, who reached Lhasa in 1716, encountered Armenian and Russian merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Pommaret, Françoise Pommaret-Imaeda (2003).

Roman Catholic [[Jesuits]] and [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]] arrived from Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. Portuguese missionaries Jesuit Father [[António de Andrade]] and Brother Manuel Marques first reached the kingdom of [[Gelu, Nepal|Gelu]] in western Tibet in 1624 and was welcomed by the royal family who allowed them to build a church later on.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Sanderg, The Exploration of Tibet: History and Particulars (Delhi: Cosmo Publications, 1973), pp. 23–26; Thomas Holdich, Tibet, The Mysterious (London: [[Alston Rivers]], 1906), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sir Edward Maclagan, The Jesuits and The Great Mogul (London: Burns, Oates &amp; Washbourne Ltd., 1932), pp. 344–345.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1627, there were about a hundred local converts in the Guge kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Lettera del P. Alano Dos Anjos al Provinciale di Goa, 10 Novembre 1627, quoted from Wu Kunming, Zaoqi Chuanjiaoshi jin Zang Huodongshi (Beijing: Zhongguo Zangxue chubanshe, 1992), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, Christianity was introduced to [[Rudok]], [[Ladakh]] and Tsang and was welcomed by the ruler of the [[Ü-Tsang|Tsang kingdom]], where Andrade and his fellows established a Jesuit outpost at Shigatse in 1626.&lt;ref&gt;Extensively using Italian and Portuguese archival materials, Wu's work gives a detailed account of Cacella's activities in Tsang. See Zaoqi Chuanjiaoshi jin Zang Huodongshi, esp. chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1661 another Jesuit, [[Johann Grueber]], crossed Tibet from [[Sining]] to Lhasa (where he spent a month), before heading on to Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;''Narratives of the Mission of George Bogle to Tibet, and of the Journey of Thomas Manning to Lhasa'', pp. 295–302. Clements R. Markham. (1876). Reprint Cosmo Publications, New Delhi. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; He was followed by others who actually built a church in Lhasa. These included the Jesuit Father [[Ippolito Desideri]], 1716–1721, who gained a deep knowledge of Tibetan culture, language and Buddhism, and various Capuchins in 1707–1711, 1716–1733 and 1741–1745,&lt;ref name="Stein 1972, p. 85"&gt;Stein 1972, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Christianity was used by some Tibetan monarchs and their courts and the [[Karmapa]] sect lamas to counterbalance the influence of the [[Gelugpa]] sect in the 17th century until in 1745 when all the missionaries were expelled at the lama's insistence.&lt;ref name="pacificrim.usfca.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacificrim.usfca.edu/research/pacrimreport/pacrimreport36.html |title=When Christianity and Lamaism Met: The Changing Fortunes of Early Western Missionaries in Tibet by Lin Hsiao-ting of Stanford University |publisher=Pacificrim.usfca.edu |accessdate=2010-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626095547/http://www.pacificrim.usfca.edu/research/pacrimreport/pacrimreport36.html |archivedate=June 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/6299565.stm|title=BBC News Country Profiles Timeline: Tibet|accessdate=2009-03-11|date=2009-11-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311184520/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/6299565.stm#|archive-date=March 11, 2009|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lettera del P.

In 1877, the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[James Cameron (China Inland Mission)|James Cameron]] from the [[China Inland Mission]] walked from [[Chongqing]] to [[Batang County|Batang]] in [[Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]], Sichuan province, and "brought the Gospel to the Tibetan people."  Beginning in the 20th century, in [[Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]] in Yunnan, a large number of Lisu people and some Yi and Nu people converted to Christianity. Famous earlier missionaries include [[James O. Fraser]], [[Alfred James Broomhall]] and [[Isobel Kuhn]] of the China Inland Mission, among others who were active in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Yunnan Province of China Government Web | url=http://www.eng.yn.gov.cn/yunnanEnglish/145529160029175808/20050623/378813.html | accessdate=2008-02-15 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312021316/http://www.eng.yn.gov.cn/yunnanEnglish/145529160029175808/20050623/378813.html | archivedate=March 12, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein 2006, pp. 31, 206&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Proselytising]] has been illegal in China since 1949. But {{As of|2013|lc=y}}, many Christian missionaries were reported to be active in Tibet with the tacit approval of Chinese authorities, who view the missionaries as a counterforce to Tibetan Buddhism or as a boon to the local economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/21/going-undercover-christian-evangelists-tibet | title=Going undercover, the evangelists taking Jesus to Tibet | publisher=The Guardian | date=21 February 2013 | accessdate=February 21, 2013 | author=Kaiman, Jonathan | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826064439/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/21/going-undercover-christian-evangelists-tibet# | archive-date=August 26, 2013 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Islam ====
{{Main|Islam in Tibet}}

Muslims have been living in Tibet since as early as the 8th or 9th century. In Tibetan cities, there are small communities of [[Tibetan Muslim|Muslims]], known as Kachee (Kache), who trace their origin to immigrants from three main regions: [[Kashmir]] (Kachee Yul in ancient Tibetan), Ladakh and the Central Asian Turkic countries. Islamic influence in Tibet also came from Persia. A Muslim Sufi [[Syed Ali Hamdani]]  preached to the people of [[Baltistan]], then known as little Tibet. Which became main cause of the cultural separation of the people of Baltistan from the mainstream Tibet . After 1959 a group of Tibetan Muslims made a case for Indian nationality based on their historic roots to Kashmir and the Indian government declared all Tibetan Muslims Indian citizens later on that year.&lt;ref&gt;Masood Butt, [http://www.tibet.com/Muslim/tibetan-muslim.html 'Muslims of Tibet'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910081317/http://www.tibet.com/Muslim/tibetan-muslim.html |date=September 10, 2006 }}, The Office of Tibet, January/February 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Other Muslim ethnic groups who have long inhabited Tibet include [[Hui people|Hui]], [[Salar people|Salar]], [[Dongxiang people|Dongxiang]] and [[Bonans|Bonan]]. There is also a well established Chinese Muslim community (gya kachee), which traces its ancestry back to the [[Hui people|Hui]] ethnic group of China.

[[File:thanka.jpg|thumb|A [[thangka]] painting in [[Sikkim]]]]
[[File:Tibetan - A Ritual Box - Walters 572299 - Reverse.jpg|thumb|A [[ritual box]]]]

Tibetan representations of art are intrinsically bound with [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and commonly depict [[deities]] or variations of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] in various forms from bronze Buddhist statues and shrines, to highly colorful [[thangka]] paintings and [[mandala]]s.

=== Architecture ===
{{Main|Tibetan culture#Architecture}}

Tibetan architecture contains Chinese and Indian influences, and reflects a deeply [[Buddhist]] approach. The [[Dharmacakra|Buddhist wheel]], along with two dragons, can be seen on nearly every [[Gompa]] in Tibet. The design of the Tibetan [[Chörten]]s can vary, from roundish walls in [[Kham]] to squarish, four-sided walls in [[Ladakh]].

The most distinctive feature of Tibetan architecture is that many of the houses and monasteries are built on elevated, sunny sites facing the south, and are often made out of a mixture of rocks, wood, cement and earth. Little fuel is available for heat or lighting, so flat roofs are built to conserve heat, and multiple windows are constructed to let in sunlight. Walls are usually sloped inwards at 10 degrees as a precaution against the frequent earthquakes in this mountainous area.

Standing at {{convert|117|m|ft|abbr=off}} in height and {{convert|360|m|ft|abbr=off}} in width, the [[Potala Palace]] is the most important example of Tibetan architecture. Formerly the residence of the [[Dalai Lama]], it contains over one thousand rooms within thirteen stories, and houses portraits of the past Dalai Lamas and statues of the Buddha. It is divided between the outer White Palace, which serves as the administrative quarters, and the inner Red Quarters, which houses the assembly hall of the Lamas, chapels, 10,000 shrines, and a vast library of Buddhist scriptures. The Potala Palace is a [[World Heritage Site]], as is [[Norbulingka]], the former summer residence of the Dalai Lama.

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of Tibet}}

The music of Tibet reflects the cultural heritage of the trans-Himalayan region, centered in Tibet but also known wherever ethnic [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] groups are found in India, [[Bhutan]], Nepal and further abroad. First and foremost Tibetan music is [[religious music]], reflecting the profound influence of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] on the culture.

Tibetan music often involves [[chanting]] in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] or [[Sanskrit]], as an integral part of the religion. These chants are complex, often recitations of [[sacred text]]s or in celebration of various festivals. [[Yin and yang|Yang]] chanting, performed without metrical timing, is accompanied by resonant drums and low, sustained syllables. Other styles include those unique to the various schools of Tibetan Buddhism, such as the classical music of the popular [[Gelugpa]] school, and the romantic music of the [[Nyingmapa]], [[Sakyapa]] and [[Kagyupa]] schools.&lt;ref&gt;Crossley-Holland, Peter. (1976). "The Ritual Music of Tibet." ''The Tibet Journal''. Vol. 1, Nos. 3 &amp; 4, Autumn 1976, pp. 47–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nangma]] dance music is especially popular in the [[karaoke]] bars of the urban center of Tibet, [[Lhasa (prefecture-level city)|Lhasa]]. Another form of popular music is the classical [[gar (music)|gar]] style, which is performed at rituals and ceremonies. [[Lu (music)|Lu]] are a type of songs that feature glottal vibrations and high pitches. There are also epic bards who sing of [[Gesar]], who is a hero to ethnic Tibetans.

=== Festivals ===
{{Main|Tibetan festivals}}

[[File:IMG 1016 Lhasa Barkhor.jpg|thumb|The [[Monlam Prayer Festival]]]]

Tibet has various festivals that are commonly performed to worship the Buddha{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} throughout the year. [[Losar]] is the Tibetan New Year Festival. Preparations for the festive event are manifested by special offerings to family shrine deities, painted doors with religious symbols, and other painstaking jobs done to prepare for the event. Tibetans eat ''[[Guthuk]]'' (barley noodle soup with filling) on New Year's Eve with their families. The [[Monlam Prayer Festival]] follows it in the first month of the [[Tibetan calendar]], falling between the fourth and the eleventh days of the first Tibetan month. It involves dancing and participating in sports events, as well as sharing picnics. The event was established in 1049 by Tsong Khapa, the founder of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama's order.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Tibetan cuisine}}
{{see also|List of Tibetan dishes}}
[[File:Thupka with Momo - Tibetan Sytle.JPG|thumb|Thupka with Momo – Tibetan Style]]
The most important crop in Tibet is [[barley]], and dough made from barley flour—called [[tsampa]]—is the [[staple food]] of Tibet. This is either rolled into noodles or made into steamed dumplings called [[momo (food)|momos]]. Meat dishes are likely to be [[yak]], goat, or [[Lamb (food)|mutton]], often dried, or cooked into a spicy [[stew]] with potatoes. [[Mustard seed]] is cultivated in Tibet, and therefore features heavily in its cuisine. Yak [[yogurt]], butter and cheese are frequently eaten, and well-prepared yogurt is considered something of a prestige item. [[Butter tea]] is very popular to drink.

In order to carry out the planned [[V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1 "flying bomb"]] attacks on the United Kingdom, Germany built a number of military installations including launching sites and depots. Some of the installations were huge concrete fortifications.

The Allies became aware of the sites at an early stage and carried out numerous bombing raids to destroy them before they came into use.

In addition to the storage and launching sites listed below, operational facilities included the airfields for [[Heinkel He 111]] H-22 bombers which air-launched the V-1 from low altitude over the [[North Sea]]. The ten-day-long aircrew training was at [[Peenemünde]], and the bases were in [[Gilze Rijen]], Holland for launches through 15 September 1944, and in [[Venlo]] for launches after the 1st week in December. Aircrews were billeted five miles away at [[Grossenkneten]] for secrecy.&lt;ref name=Cooksley/&gt;{{Rp|126}}

==Storage depots==
To supply the V-1 flying bomb launch sites in the [[Calais]] region, construction began on several storage depots in August 1943. Sites at [[Biennais]], [[Neuville-au-Bois|Oisemont Neuville-au-Bois]], and [[Saint-Martin-l'Hortier]] were not completed.{{Why?|date=June 2011}}&lt;ref name=Henshall&gt;{{cite book |last=Henshall|first=|title=Hitler’s Rocket Sites|year=1985|publisher=St Martin's Press|location=|isbn= |pages=143, 152, 187, 209}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An RCAF Halifax pilot's logbook describes the target of his raids on "flying-bomb sites" on July 1, 4, and 5, 1944, as "Biennais #1", "Biennais #2," and "Biennais #3".  This suggests that these storage sites were perhaps not completed because they were destroyed prior to completion.

The completed sites were:

To the right of the missile, the ''Anlaßgerät'' (launch device) carries electrical connections, including safe and arm connections to the missile. Part of the starter trolley, which chemically produces steam for the catapult, can also be seen.]]
# '''Final Assembly''': After moving the V-1 from the storage area, the wings were slid/bolted over/to the tubular spar.&lt;ref name=Cooksley/&gt;{{Rp|35}}
# '''Final Checkout''': In the non-magnetic building, "compass swinging" was completed by hanging the V-1 and pointing it toward the target.  The missile's external casing of 16-gauge sheet steel was beaten with a mallet until its magnetic field was suitably aligned. The automatic pilot was set with the flight altitude input (300–2500 metres) to the barometric (aneroid) height control and with the range set within the air log (journey computer).&lt;ref name=Cooksley/&gt;{{Rp|29,35}}
# '''Hoisting''': The V-1 was delivered to the launching ramp via a wooden handling trolley on rails.&lt;ref name=Cooksley/&gt;{{Rp|34}}  A wooden lifting gantry on rails was connected to the V-1 lifting lug to hoist and move it onto the launching spot at the lower end of the launching ramp.&lt;ref name=Cooksley/&gt;{{Rp|30,34,35}}
#'''Fueling and Charging''':{{Verify source|Cooksley doesn't indicate when fueling and charging were completed - one source claims the V-1 was transported to the site fully fueled|date=December 2008}}  Via the tank filler cap, 1,133&amp;nbsp;lbs (140 gallons) of petrol ({{lang-de|[[B-Stoff]]}}) were added (later longer-range models held more).  The twin spherical iron air bottles were charged with 900 psi air to power the automatic pilot (''Steuergerät'').  Air at 90 psi powered the pneumatic servo-motors for the elevators and rudder.&lt;ref name=Cooksley/&gt;{{Rp|31,37}}
# '''Catapult setup''':  The starter trolley with the hydrogen peroxide ({{lang-de|[[T-Stoff]]}}) and catalyst (potassium permanganate granules, ''[[List of stoffs|Z-stoff]]'') was connected to provide steam to the ramp's firing tube, and the steam piston was placed into the firing tube with the piston's launching lug connected to the V-1.&lt;ref name=Cooksley/&gt;{{Rp|30,33,35,64d}}
# '''V-1 startup''':  While the steam-generating trolley was being connected, the Argus As 109-014 ''Ofenrohr'' pulsejet engine was started.&lt;ref name=Cooksley/&gt;{{Rp|32,35}}
# '''Launch'''
# '''Post-launch''':  The steam piston, having separated from the V-1 at the end of the ramp during launch, was collected for re-use (the site nominally had only two pistons).  Personnel in rubber boots and protective clothing used a catwalk along the ramp and washed the launching rail with brooms.&lt;ref name=Cooksley/&gt;{{Rp|32,35}}

==V-1 launching sites==
V-1 launching sites in France were located in nine general areas - four of which had the ramps aligned toward London, and the remainder toward [[Brighton]], [[Dover]], [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]], [[Hastings]], [[Southampton]], [[Manchester]], [[Portsmouth]], [[Bristol]], and [[Plymouth]]. The sites on the Cherbourg peninsula targeting Bristol and Plymouth were captured before being used, and eventually launching ramps were moved to Holland to target Antwerp (first launched on 3 March 1945 from Delft).&lt;ref name=Cooksley/&gt;{{Rp|48,80,82,100}}

Initially the V-1 launching sites had storage buildings that were curved at the end to protect the contents against damage from air attacks. On aerial reconnaissance pictures these storage from above looked like snow skis ("ski sites"). An October 28, 1943 intelligence report regarding construction at Bois Carré near Yvrench&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt;{{Rp|300e}}&lt;!--The pg 300e photo is incorrectly captioned as "1940") --&gt; prompted [[No. 170 Squadron RAF]] reconnaissance sortie E/463 on November 3 which detected "ski-shaped buildings 240-270 feet long."&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=R.

Nazi Germany subsequently began constructing modified sites with limited structures that could be completed quickly, as necessary. This also allowed the modified sites to be quickly repaired after bombing. However, the work to complete a modified site before launching allowed the allied photographic interpreters to predict on June 11, 1944 that the V-1 attacks would begin within 48 hours, and the first attacks began on June 13.&lt;ref name=Gurney/&gt;

==Allied attacks==
&lt;!--FORMAT: keep this table alphabetical by site (so readers can easily look for a particular site), but with a separate listing (row) for each bombing date so sorting can be used for studying the bombing sequence.--&gt;&lt;!--NOTE: this table and the subsequent lists include citable listings for V-1 sites which are not stated as storage depots nor on the V-1 storage depot list.  However, some may be storage depots with different names, but just not yet with citable information that they are storage depots. Likewise, if two names were used for the same launching site, both names are listed until a reference is provided to link the two names as one site.  In particular, the Biennais and Beauvais storage sites have similar spellings, and there were three sites near Ligercourt/Ligescourt (one may have two names: "Forêt de Croc" and "forest of Crécy near Abbeville".)--&gt;

{{Expand Finnish|Jedoma|date=March 2012}}

'''Yedoma''' is an organic-rich (about 2% carbon by mass) [[Pleistocene]]-age [[permafrost]] with ice content of 50–90% by volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walter KM, Zimov SA, Chanton JP, Verbyla D, Chapin FS |title=Methane bubbling from Siberian thaw lakes as a positive feedback to climate warming |journal=Nature |volume=443 |issue=7107 |pages=71–5 |date=September 2006 |pmid=16957728 |doi=10.1038/nature05040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of [[carbon]] trapped in this type of permafrost is much more prevalent than originally thought and may be about 210 to 450 [[Gigatonne|Gt]], that is a multiple of the amount of carbon released into the air each year by the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Seth Borenstein |title=Scientists Find New Global Warming "Time Bomb" |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=7 September 2006 |url=http://www.thewe.cc/weplanet/news/arctic/permafrost_melting.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thawing yedoma is a significant source of [[atmospheric methane]] (about 4 [[Teragram|Tg]] of {{chem|CH|4}} per year).

The Yedoma region currently occupies an area of more than one million square kilometers from northeast [[Siberia]] to [[Alaska]] and [[Canada]], and in many regions is tens of meters thick. During the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], when the global sea level was 120 m lower than that of today, similar deposits covered substantial areas of the exposed northeast Eurasian
continental shelves. At the end of last [[ice age]], at the [[Pleistocene]] — [[Holocene]] transition, thawing yedoma and the resulting [[thermokarst]] lakes may have produced 33 to 87% of the high-latitude increase in atmospheric [[methane]] concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walter KM, Edwards ME, Grosse G, Zimov SA, Chapin FS |title=Thermokarst lakes as a source of atmospheric {{chem|CH|4}} during the last deglaciation |journal=Science |volume=318 |issue=5850 |pages=633–6 | date=October  2007 |pmid=17962561 |doi=10.1126/science.1142924 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&amp;pmid=17962561}}&lt;/ref&gt;
