      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3830">In computing, '''56-bit encryption''' refers to a [[key size]] of fifty-six [[bit]]s, or seven [[byte]]s, for [[symmetric encryption]].  While stronger than [[40-bit encryption]], this still represents a relatively low [[level of security]] in the context of a [[brute force attack]].

==Description==
The US government traditionally regulated encryption for reasons of national security, law enforcement and foreign policy.  Encryption was regulated from 1976 by the [[Arms Export Control Act]] until control was transferred to the [[Department of Commerce]] in 1996.

56-bit refers to the size of a symmetric key used to encrypt data, with the number of unique possible permutations being &lt;math&gt;2^{56}&lt;/math&gt; (72,057,594,037,927,936).  56-bit encryption has its roots in [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]], which was the official standard of the US [[National Bureau of Standards]] from 1976, and later also the [[RC5]] algorithm.  US government regulations required any users of stronger 56-bit symmetric keys to submit to key recovery through algorithms like [[CDMF]] or key escrow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yjsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA77|page=77|title=Hackers Prove 56-bit DES is not Enough|journal=InfoWorld|date=30 June 1997|author1=Infoworld Media Group|first1=Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; effectively reducing the key strength to 40-bit, and thereby allowing organisations such as the [[NSA]] to brute-force this encryption.  Furthermore, from 1996 software products [[export of cryptography|exported]] from the United States were not permitted to use stronger than 56-bit encryption, requiring different software editions for the US and export markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc722908.aspx|title=Microsoft Strong Encryption Downloads|publisher=Microsoft|year=2011|accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, US allowed 56-bit encryption to be exported without key escrow or any other key recovery requirements.

The advent of [[electronic commerce|commerce on the Internet]] and faster computers raised concerns about the security of [[Electronic commerce|electronic transactions]] initially with 40-bit, and subsequently also with 56-bit encryption.  In February 1997, [[RSA Data Security]] ran a brute force competition with a $10,000 prize to demonstrate the weakness of 56-bit encryption; the contest was won four months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/Group-cracks-56-bit-encryption/2100-1023_3-200705.html|title=Group Cracks 56-bit Encryption|publisher=[[CNET]]|date=18 June 1997|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 1998, a successful brute-force attack was demonstrated against 56-bit encryption with [[EFF DES cracker|Deep Crack]] in just 56 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m5wLgC546hMC&amp;pg=PA25124|page=25124|title=Congressional Record|volume=144|series=17|publisher=United States Senate|date=October 7–9, 1998|isbn=9780160680830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, all restrictions on key length were lifted, except for exports to embargoed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/crs/rl30273.pdf|title=CRS Report for Congress|date=11 January 2001|author=Jeanne J. Grimmett|publisher=Legislative Attorney, American Law Division}}&lt;/ref&gt;

56-bit DES encryption is now obsolete, having been replaced as a standard in 2002 by the 128-bit (and stronger) [[Advanced Encryption Standard]]. DES continues to be used as a symmetric cipher in combination with [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] because older products do not support newer ciphers like [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]].&lt;ref&gt;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3057154&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''airspeed indicator''' (ASI) or '''airspeed gauge''' is a [[flight instrument]] indicating the [[airspeed]] of an [[aircraft]] in [[miles per hour]] (MPH), [[knot (unit)|knots]], or both.  The ASI measures the pressure differential between [[pitot-static system|static pressure]] from the static port, and [[total pressure]] from the [[pitot tube]].  This difference in pressure is registered with the ASI pointer on the face of the instrument.&lt;ref name="ASI"&gt;{{cite book |title=Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge |date=2016 |publisher=U.S. Dept. of Transportation, FAA |at=8-8 |url=https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak/media/10_phak_ch8.pdf |accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
The ASI has standard color coded markings for the safe operation within the limitations of the aircraft.  At a glance, the pilot can determine a recommended speed  (V speeds) or if he needs to make any speed adjustments.  Single and multi-engine aircraft have common markings.  For instance, the green arc indicates the normal operating range of the aircraft, from ''V''&lt;sub&gt;S1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''V''&lt;sub&gt;NO&lt;/sub&gt;.  The white arc indicates the [[flap (aeronautics)|flap]] operating range, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;SO&lt;/sub&gt; to ''V''&lt;sub&gt;FE&lt;/sub&gt;, used for approaches and landings.  The yellow arc cautions that flight should be conducted in this range only in smooth air, while the red line (''V''&lt;sub&gt;NE&lt;/sub&gt;) at the top of the yellow arc indicates damage or structural failure may result at higher speeds.&lt;ref name=ASI /&gt;{{rp|8-9}}

The ASI in multi-engine aircraft include two additional radial markings, one red and one blue, associated with potential engine failure.  The radial red line near the bottom of green arc indicates ''V''&lt;sub&gt;mc&lt;/sub&gt;, the minimum indicated airspeed at which the aircraft can be controlled with the [[critical engine]] inoperative.  The radial blue line indicates ''V''&lt;sub&gt;YSE&lt;/sub&gt;, the speed for best rate of climb with the [[critical engine]] inoperative.&lt;ref name=FAA2&gt;{{cite book |title=Airplane Flying Handbook, FAA-H-8083-3B |date=2016 |publisher=U.S. Dept. of Transportation, FAA |at=12-2 |url=https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/airplane_handbook/media/14_afh_ch12.pdf |accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
{{multiple image

}}
The ASI is only flight instrument that uses both the static system and the pitot system.  Static pressure enters the ASI case, while total pressure flexes the diaphragm, which is connected to the ASI pointer via mechanical linkage. The pressures are equal when the aircraft is stationary on the ground, and hence shows a reading of zero.  When the aircraft is moving forward, air entering the pitot tube is at a greater pressure than the static line, which flexes the diaphragm, moving the pointer.  The ASI is checked before takeoff for a zero reading, and during takeoff that it is increasing appropriately.&lt;ref name=ASI /&gt;{{rp|8-10}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0SkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=Popular+Science+The+lads+who+fly+Britain%27s+1944&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UHyfT6aEIYOs9ATwh8C1AQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |title=How Aircraft Instruments Work|magazine=Popular Science|date=March 1944|at= pp. 117, mid page}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0SkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=Popular+Science+The+lads+who+fly+Britain%27s+1944&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UHyfT6aEIYOs9ATwh8C1AQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |title=How Aircraft Instruments Work|magazine=Popular Science|date=March 1944|at=pp. 116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pitot tube may become blocked, because of insects, dirt or failure to remove the pitot cover.  Blockage will prevent ram air from entering the system.  If the pitot opening is blocked, but the drain hole is open, the system pressure will drop to [[ambient pressure]], and the ASI pointer will drop to a zero reading.  If both the opening and drain hole are blocked, the ASI will not indicate any change in airspeed.  However, the ASI pointer will show altitude changes, as the associated static pressure changes.  If both the pitot tube and the static system are blocked, the ASI pointer will read zero.  If the static ports are blocked but the pitot tube remains open, the ASI will operate, but
inaccurately.&lt;ref name=ASI /&gt;{{rp|8-10, 8-11}}

== Types of Airspeeds ==
{{multiple image

Indicated airspeed ('''IAS'''}, is read directly off the ASI.  It has no correction for air density variations, installation or instrument errors.  Calibrated airspeed ('''CAS''') is corrected for installation and instrument errors. An airspeed calibration chart is available for any remaining errors.  True airspeed ('''TAS''') is CAS corrected for altitude and nonstandard temperature.  TAS is used for [[flight planning]].  TAS increases as altitude increases, as air density decreases.  TAS may be determined via a flight computer, such as the [[E6B]].  Some ASIs have a TAS ring.  Alternatively, a [[rule of thumb]] is to add 2 per cent to the CAS for each 1000 feet of altitude gained.&lt;ref name=ASI /&gt;{{rp|8-8,8-9}}

== Jet Aircraft ==
[[Jet aircraft]] do not have ''V&lt;sub&gt;NO&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''V&lt;sub&gt;NE&lt;/sub&gt;'' like piston-engined aircraft, but instead have a maximum operating speed expressed in knots, ''V&lt;sub&gt;MO&lt;/sub&gt;'' and [[Mach number]], ''M&lt;sub&gt;MO&lt;/sub&gt;''.  Thus, a pilot of a jet airplane needs both an airspeed indicator and a [[Machmeter]], with appropriate red lines.  An ASI will include a red-and-white striped pointer, or "[[barber's pole]]", that automatically moves to indicate the applicable speed limit at any given time.&lt;ref name=FAA2 /&gt;{{rp|15-7}}

== Angle of Attack and Lift Reserve Indicators ==
{{multiple image
|footer = LRI (left) and AOA Indicators (right)
|image1 = LRI Meter.jpg
|image2 = AOA Indicators.png
|total_width = 400
}}
An airplane can stall at any speed, so monitoring the ASI alone will not prevent a stall.  The critical [[angle of attack]] (AOA) determines when an aircraft will stall.  For a particular configuration, it is a constant independent of weight, bank angle, temperature, [[density altitude]], and the [[center of gravity of an aircraft]].  An AOA indicator provides stall [[situational awareness]] as a means for monitoring the onset of the critical AOA.  The AOA indicator will show the current AOA and its proximity to the critical AOA.&lt;ref name=ASI /&gt;{{rp|5-26,5-27}}

Similarly, the Lift Reserve Indicator (LRI) provides a measure of the amount of lift being generated.  It uses a pressure differential system to provide the pilot with a visual representation of reserve lift available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lift Reserve Indicator |url=http://www.sonexfoundation.com/Lift_Reserve_Indicator.html |website=Sondex Builders &amp; Pilots Foundation |publisher=Sonex Foundation |accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7044">'''Analysis &amp; Policy Observatory''' (also known as APO) is a not-for-profit [[open access]] [[Disciplinary repository|subject repository]] or [[digital library]], specialising in public policy and practice [[grey literature]] and journal articles, mainly from Australia and New Zealand, with some coverage of other countries. Formerly known as Australian Policy Online, the organisation underwent a name change to Analysis &amp; Policy Observatory (APO) in 2017.

== Background ==

APO was established in 2002 by the Swinburne Institute for Social Research, at [[Swinburne University]] in [[Melbourne]]. It was intended as a way to collate and disseminate academic research reports and other [[grey literature]] that was increasingly proliferating online. It has since established itself as a notable resource for people involved in policy research in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="broadband.unimelb"&gt;Bellamy, C., Gibbs, M., Williamson, A., Sean Cubit, S. (December 2011).  [http://broadband.unimelb.edu.au/engage/pubs/wp/IBES-political-issue-analysis-system.pdf "Political Issue Analysis System: Policy deliberation in the age of information abundance"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204050628/http://broadband.unimelb.edu.au/engage/pubs/wp/IBES-political-issue-analysis-system.pdf |date=2014-02-04 }}. Retrieved 17 October 2013 from [http://broadband.unimelb.edu.au/ "Institute for a Broadband-Enabled Society"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918084602/http://www.broadband.unimelb.edu.au/ |date=2010-09-18 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It now sits as part of the Centre of Urban Transitions within Swinburne University of Technology.

APO is a not-for-profit organisation supported by partnerships with academic institutions and government agencies, grants donations and advertising revenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apo.org.au/funding-and-support "Funding and support"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313112458/http://apo.org.au/funding-and-support |date=2014-03-13 }}. Retrieved 13 March 2014 from [http://apo.org.au/ "Policy Online"].&lt;/ref&gt; Partners include the [[Australian National Data Service]], [[Australia and New Zealand School of Government|ANZSOG]], the [[University of Canberra]], the [[Henry Halloran]] Trust at the [[University of Sydney]], and the [[University of South Australia]]. APO has also been an awarded a number of [[Australian Research Council]] grants.

== Purpose ==

APO was established to address the transformation of the means of production for publications brought about by the internet. Frustrations with the limitations of the [[academic publishing]] system – long delays, lack of access or audience – were causing producers of academic and other content to move online and increasingly produce [[grey literature]] (informally published written material, such as reports, that may be difficult to trace via conventional channels). The informal channels used to disseminate digital grey literature have meant that libraries and other services have only been able to collect it in an ad hoc manner. APO aims to make digital research content that is relevant to Australian policy debates more easily discoverable, accessible and able to be managed.&lt;ref&gt;Mackey, M.,  Magnifico, C., Tyler, K. (August 2013). [https://www.scribd.com/doc/163740640/The-Effects-of-the-Internet-and-Open-Access-on-the-Usage-of-Grey-Literature-A-Review-of-the-Literature-Group-Project#download "The Effects of the Internet and Open Access on the Usage of Grey Literature: a review of the literature"]. Retrieved 18 November 2013 from  [https://www.scribd.com "Scribd"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

APO specialises in collecting public policy reports and articles from academic research centres, think tanks, government and non-government organisations. As well as research, the site includes a smaller collection of opinion and commentary pieces, video, audio and web resources focused on policy issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediaaccess.org.au/research-policy/research/useful-research-and-policy-databases "Useful research and policy databases"]. Retrieved 17 October 2013 from [http://mediaaccess.org.au/ "Media Access Australia"].&lt;/ref&gt; Most content is produced by other organisations and collected and catalogued on the site, although some commentary is original to APO.

== Reception ==

In 2011, the then Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet described APO as providing “some of the most valuable and constructive contributions to Australia’s policy debate”.&lt;ref&gt;Moran, T. (28 July 2011).[http://www.dpmc.gov.au/media/speech_2011_07_28.cfm "The John Paterson Oration 2011"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019235357/http://www.dpmc.gov.au/media/speech_2011_07_28.cfm |date=2011-10-19 }}. Retrieved 17 October 2013 from  [http://www.dpmc.gov.au/ "The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet"].&lt;/ref&gt; However, APO has also been criticised on the grounds that it “could perhaps do more to engage with the formal political workings of government through providing access to formal government policy information.”&lt;ref name="broadband.unimelb" /&gt;

In 2012, the report of the Independent Inquiry into Media and Media Regulation by the Hon Raymond Antony Finkelstein QC stated that: "While the start-up costs for new print publications have been prohibitive and inhibited new enterprises emerging, the streamlining of the relationship between content producers and consumers has led to many new websites and web-based services. Among the most important such websites that have grown up in Australia over the last decade are Inside Story, Australian Policy Online, Online Opinion, The Drum, The Conversation, and New Matilda."&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein, R. (March 2012).

In August 2014, APO won the "Information" category at the Australia &amp; New Zealand Internet Awards (ANZIA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internetawards.org.au/winners "Winners"].

A piece of ''' antique furniture''' is a [[collectible]] interior furnishing of considerable age. Often the age, rarity, condition, utility, or other unique features make a piece of [[furniture]] desirable as a collectors' item, and thus termed an [[antique]]. The antique furniture pieces reflect the style and features of the time they were made; this can be called the antique's "period" (Eduardian, Tudor, Colonial, etc.).

Antique furniture may support the human body (such as seating or beds), provide storage, or hold objects on horizontal surfaces above the ground. Storage furniture (which often makes use of doors, drawers, and shelves) is used to hold or contain smaller objects such as clothes, tools, books, and household goods. Furniture can be a product of artistic design and is considered a form of [[decorative art]]. In addition to furniture's functional role, it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose. Domestic furniture works to create, in conjunction with furnishings such as clocks and lighting, comfortable and convenient interior spaces. Furniture can be made from many materials, including metal, plastic, and wood. [[Cabinetry]] and cabinet making are terms for the skill set used in the building of furniture.

The earliest furniture was simple and practical, but as furniture became crafted and decorated it became an early [[status symbol]]. Wealthy homeowners demanded that their furnishings reflect their status and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]s.

An '''aquatic weed harvester''', also known as a '''water mower''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktbs.com/story/22502823/arklatex-in-depth-salvinia-fight|title=ArkLaTex In-Depth: Salvinia fight|author=Neil Shaw|date=4 June 2013|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyinterlake.com/members/this-county-planner-handles-the-tough-conflicts/article_8f362db2-6b0d-11e5-a810-6f9aeced6f14.html|title=This county planner handles the tough conflicts|work=Daily Inter Lake|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''mowing boat''' and '''weed cutting boat''',&lt;ref name="Mills 2015"/&gt; is an aquatic machine specifically designed for inland watercourse management to cut and harvest underwater weeds, reeds and other aquatic plant life.&lt;ref name="TBO.com 2013"/&gt; The action of removing aquatic plant life in such a manner has been referred to as "aquatic harvesting".&lt;ref name="Satayut 2012"/&gt; 

==Overview==
Water is an important resource and in many countries, waterways are increasingly clogged by aquatic plant growth. This is particularly so in tropical countries where warmer water means the plants grow more quickly, and increasing run-off of [[fertiliser]]s and effluent has exacerbated the problem. Irrigation ditches and pumps can become overgrown with vegetation, power station and factory water intakes can get blocked, boats can get hindered, fish stocks can be disrupted, and water moves more slowly, resulting in greater [[evapotranspiration]] and a greater risk of flooding. In some large irrigation projects in India, canals have become so overgrown with vegetation that water flow has been reduced to a fifth of its previous amount. In Bangladesh, floodwater has washed mats of [[Eichhornia crassipes|water hyacinth]] onto paddy fields, overwhelming the emerging rice crops.&lt;ref name=Council&gt;{{cite book|author1=National Research Council|title=Making Aquatic Weeds Useful: Some Perspectives for Developing Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pG-8h6JufaEC&amp;pg=PA1 |year=2002|publisher=The Minerva Group |isbn=978-0-89499-180-6 |pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small fish can become entangled in excessive algal growth.&lt;ref name="Satayut 2012"/&gt;

[[File:Pond covered by Pistia, Odessa.JPG|thumb|left|A pond in [[Odessa]], Ukraine covered with water lettuce (''[[Pistia stratiotes]]'')]]
[[Rice]] is the main aquatic plant grown for human food, but smaller areas of [[watercress]] and [[water chestnut]] are also cultivated. In their native environments, aquatic weeds are part of a balanced ecosystem, and it is mainly introduced species of water plant that become [[invasive species|invasive]] and cause problems by congesting water bodies. The worst culprits, found in both temperate and tropical waterways, are floating plants such as [[water hyacinth]], [[Pistia|water lettuce]] and ''[[Salvinia]]'', fully submerged rooting plants such as ''[[Hydrilla]]'' and [[Myriophyllum spicatum|water milfoil]] and rooting plants that reach the surface such as [[Typha|cattail]], [[papyrus]], [[bulrush]] and [[Phragmites|reed]].&lt;ref name=Council/&gt;

==Weed harvesting equipment==
Weed cutting boats are developed to enable the maintenance of canals, lakes and rivers&lt;ref name="TBO.com 2013"/&gt; and to remove excessive aquatic life such as [[algae]] and other plants that may negatively affect a waterway's [[ecology]]. Mechanical harvesters are large floating machines that have underwater cutting blades that sever the stems of underwater plants, gather the weeds and raise them on conveyor belts, storing the vegetation on board in a hold. Periodically this is discharged to a barge or an onshore facility. The harvested product can be [[compost]]ed, sent to a [[landfill]] site or used in [[land reclamation]].&lt;ref name=Washington&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/wq/plants/management/aqua026.html |title=Aquatic Plant Management: Mechanical Harvesting |publisher=Washington State Department of Ecology |accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In developing countries aquatic vegetation may be harvested by hand or by net from the shore, cut and harvested by boat and lifted ashore by hand, crane, pump or conveyor system. The harvested vegetation may be used for the feeding of livestock. To reduce the high moisture content and to make it easier to transport, the weed can be chopped and pressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=National Research Council|title=Making Aquatic Weeds Useful: Some Perspectives for Developing Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pG-8h6JufaEC&amp;pg=PA67 |year=2002|publisher=The Minerva Group |isbn=978-0-89499-180-6 |pages=67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other uses to which the harvested vegetation can be put include [[Silage|ensiling]] the material for livestock fodder, adding it to the soil as a bulky organic fertilizer, manufacturing the raw material into pulp, paper or fibre, and [[Fermentation|fermenting]] it to produce [[methane]] for energy production.&lt;ref name=Council/&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==

Mechanical harvesters can be effective at clearing aquatic weeds but the machines are expensive and the process may need to be repeated several times in a growing season. Small fragments of weed remain in the water and may spread to other locations thereby aiding in the dispersal of invasive species. Some areas may be too shallow for the mechanical harvester and it may be unable to access restricted locations.&lt;ref name=Washington/&gt; Submerged tree stumps can damage the machine.&lt;ref name="Satayut 2012"/&gt; Aquatic weeds can also be utilized as a source of [[biofuel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Making Aquatic Weeds Useful: Some Perspectives for Developing Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n2krAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=aquatic+weeds+as+fuel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X_uFdz1Ee1&amp;sig=iH814vVlXc2p8YInpYCg_-8i3iI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp0c6BypLZAhUGDZAKHf_eAVMQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=harvester&amp;f=false|year=1976|publisher=National Academies|pages=108–|id=NAP:14402}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative to mechanical harvesting is the use of herbicides, which are easy to apply and less expensive, but may have unwanted impacts on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/wq/plants/management/aqua028.html |title=Aquatic Plant Management: Aquatic Herbicides |publisher=Washington State Department of Ecology |accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By region==

===Africa===
[[File:Kenya Kisumu Harbour Hyacinths 1997ke09b21.jpg|thumb|Water hyacinth growing in Lake Victoria at [[Kisumu]]]]

In June 2015 in Uganda, use of the aquatic weed harvester was recommended by the country's [[Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (Uganda)|Ministry of Agriculture]] to reduce [[water hyacinth]] growth in [[Lake Victoria]], which has caused a scarcity of fish in the lake.&lt;ref name="www.newvision.co.ug 2016"/&gt; The scarcity of fish has negatively-affected the livelihood of locals who live in the lake's region.&lt;ref name="www.newvision.co.ug 2016"/&gt; Additional types of machines were recommended to address the problem, which were the hydraulic harvester, take out elevator and [[Dredging|dredger]].&lt;ref name="www.newvision.co.ug 2016"/&gt;

===India===
[[File:Zoetermeer De Leyens Broekwegwetering Mowing boat (2).JPG|thumb|A mowing boat]]

In August 2015 in [[Hyderabad]], India, an aquatic weed harvester was used to remove algal weeds and trash from Hussainsagar Lake.&lt;ref name="Singh 2016"/&gt; An amphibious hydraulic excavator was also used.&lt;ref name="Singh 2016"/&gt; The work was performed to address pollution problems at the lake, which had accumulated significant algae and rubbish such as plastic bags and [[plastic pollution|plastic waste]], food wrappers, and various garbage, some of which was floating atop the lake.&lt;ref name="Singh 2016"/&gt;

===United States===
Some U.S. companies manufacture aquatic weed harvesters.&lt;ref name="TBO.com 2013"/&gt; One such machine manufactured by a U.S. company can cut around one-half an [[acre]] of weeds a day, and costs over $100,000.&lt;ref name="TBO.com 2013"/&gt;

[[Tampa, Florida]] used an aquatic weed harvester in 2013 to clear aquatic plant life from lakes in the area.&lt;ref name="TBO.com 2013"/&gt;

In 2012 in [[Leoni, Michigan]], an aquatic weed harvester was used to remove [[algae]] from Center Lake.&lt;ref name="Satayut 2012"/&gt; The algae appeared to have roots, and other techniques such as attempting to kill it with chemicals were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Satayut 2012"/&gt; The machine used collects algae and weeds that live at the bottom of the lake, removing them from the waterway.&lt;ref name="Satayut 2012"/&gt;

The '''Bloomberg Terminal''' is a computer software system provided by the [[financial data vendor]] [[Bloomberg L.P.]] that enables professionals in the financial service sector and other industries to access the ''Bloomberg Professional'' service through which users can monitor and analyze real-time financial [[market data]] and place trades on the [[electronic trading platform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/ | work=Bloomberg | title=Bloomberg Professional}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system also provides news, price quotes, and messaging across its proprietary secure network. It is well-known among the financial community for its black interface, which is not optimized for user experience but has become a recognizable trait of the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uxmag.com/articles/the-impossible-bloomberg-makeover|title=The Impossible Bloomberg Makeover|last=Leca|first=Dominique|date=|website=UX|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most large financial firms have subscriptions to the Bloomberg Professional service. Many exchanges charge their own additional fees for access to real time price feeds across the terminal. The same applies to various news organizations.

All Bloomberg Terminals are leased in two-year cycles (in the late 1990s and early 2000s, three-year contracts were an option), with leases originally based on how many displays were connected to each terminal (this predated the move to Windows-based application). Most Bloomberg setups have between two and six displays. It is available for an annual fee of $20,000 per user ($25,080 per year for the small number of firms that use only one terminal).&lt;ref&gt;[http://qz.com/84961/this-is-how-much-a-bloomberg-terminal-costs/ This is how much a Bloomberg terminal costs]&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2016, there were 325,000 Bloomberg Terminal subscribers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/company/|title=Bloomberg company information|last=|first=|date=|work=Bloomberg|via=|accessdate=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pricing ==
Sales from the Bloomberg terminal account for more than 85 percent of Bloomberg L.P.'s annual revenue.&lt;ref name="Inside the Bloomberg Machine"&gt;{{cite web |title=Inside the Bloomberg Machine |accessdate=October 27, 2011 |url=http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/trading-technology/229400082 |publisher=Wall Street and Technology |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105091916/http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/trading-technology/229400082# |archive-date=January 5, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[financial data vendor]]'s proprietary computer system starts at $22,500 per user per year.

== Architecture ==
[[File:2012 Bloomberg Terminal by jm3 - Creative Commons licensed.jpg|thumb|A Bloomberg terminal with a [[multi-monitor]] set-up composed of six screens.]]
The terminal implements a client-server architecture with the server running on a multiprocessor [[Unix]] platform. The client, used by end users to interact with the system, is a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] application that typically connects directly through a router provided by Bloomberg and installed on-site. End users can also make use of an extra service (''Bloomberg Anywhere'') to allow the Windows application to connect via internet/IP, or Web access via a [[Citrix]] client. There are also applications that allow mobile access via [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[BlackBerry]], and [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]]. The server side of the terminal was originally developed using mostly the [[programming language]]s [[Fortran]] and [[C (programming language)|C]]. Recent years have seen a transition towards [[C++]] and embedded [[JavaScript]] on the clients and servers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Each server machine runs multiple instances of the server process. Using a proprietary form of context-switching, the servers keep track of the state of each end user, allowing consecutive interactions from a single user to be handled by different server processes. The [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) code is also proprietary.

== Keyboard ==
[[Michael Bloomberg]]'s 1997 autobiography contains a chapter entitled ''Computers for Virgins'', which explains the differences in the design of the terminal and its keyboard from the standard IBM [[PC keyboard]] layout that was popular at that time. The terminal's keyboard layout was designed for traders and market makers who had no prior computer experience. While the look and feel of the Bloomberg keyboard is very similar to the standard computer keyboard, there are several enhancements that help users navigate through the system, from the idea for a user-friendly system when originally designed in the early 1980s.

Keyboard keys are commonly referred to inside angle brackets with full commands being contained in curly brackets  e.g., {VOD LN Equity &lt;GO&gt;}. The function keys names were replaced (from the technical name, e.g., F10) and the then standard beige color, opting for a memorable color and user-friendly name, ''Yellow''. The F10 key is thus a ''Yellow'' key named &lt;Index&gt;. The ''Esc'' is coloured red and named &lt;CANCEL&gt; in the Bloomberg system, with the red to catch one's eye to stop a task. The ''Enter'' key is referred to as &lt;GO&gt; with a green color, deriving from the ''Monopoly'' game board, by passing ''Go'' and collecting $200 in a hope that the user could make money on the information he would find.&lt;ref&gt;''Bloomberg by Bloomberg'', Michael R. Bloomberg 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bloomberg keyboard includes a unique &lt;MENU&gt; key which navigates back to the previous function used.  If no previous commands are found, &lt;MENU&gt; displays a list of related functions.  Similarly, the ''History'' key will populate the command-line with previously used functions in reverse chronological order, as the ''Up'' arrow key function does in certain command prompts.

The yellow hotkeys along the top of the keyboard are used to enter market sectors, and are generally used as suffixes to allow the terminal to correctly identify a security.
[[File:Bloomberg terminal keyboard.jpg|thumb|An early 2000s Bloomberg terminal keyboard]]

* F2 GOVT – government securities (U.S. treasury and non-U.S.)
* F3 CORP – corporate debt
* F4 MTGE – mortgage securities
* F5 M-Mkt – money market
* F6 MUNI – municipal debt
* F7 PFD – preferred shares
* F8 EQUITY – equity shares
* F9 COMDTY – commodity markets
* F10 INDEX – indexes
* F11 CURNCY – currency markets
* F12 CLIENT/ALPHA – Portfolio functionality

For example, if someone is interested in the Vodafone stock listed in the London market, one enters {VOD LN &lt;Equity&gt; &lt;GO&gt;} where VOD is the company's [[ticker symbol]], LN is the venue code for London, and &lt;Equity&gt; is the market sector. A detailed option list related to Vodafone UK stock will pop up, the person can then choose different options by pressing related keys or using the mouse to select the option.

Similarly, {USDEUR &lt;Curncy&gt; &lt;GO&gt;} displays the U.S. dollar–[[Euro]] [[exchange rate|exchange]] [[spot rate]].

Other common Bloomberg commands for Equity include:

* {HP &lt;GO&gt;}- Historical Price – Display the detailed historical price of the currently loaded stock
* {DVD &lt;GO&gt;} – Dividend / Split Summary of the currently loaded stock
* {CACS &lt;GO&gt;} – Corporate Actions related to the currently loaded stock
* {CN &lt;GO&gt;} – Company News – News related to the currently loaded stock

Thus, if someone interested in the Vodafone UK stock price, they can directly type in {VOD LN &lt;Equity&gt; HP &lt;GO&gt;}.

The Bloomberg keyboard has traditionally been heavier and sturdier than standard keyboards (a previous version, the SEA100 Bloomberg keyboard weighed around 3&amp;nbsp;kg) with 3mm key travel and 19mm key pitch; it also comes with built-in speakers for multimedia features. The SEA100 version has a built-in, 500 PPI, 0.26 sq inch biometric sensor for user login verification.  The current Starboard (Keyboard 4) version is 1.08&amp;nbsp;kg and uses flatter, chiclet-style keys which are quieter and have less key travel than Freeboard (Keyboard 3) and prior.

== Terminal and related products ==
Self-contained operating system running on custom hardware—commonly referred to as a ''Bloomberg Box''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Lowry |first=Tom |author2= |title=The Bloomberg Machine |newspaper=[[BusinessWeek]] |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |date=April 23, 2001 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_17/b3729001.htm |accessdate=October 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022082539/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_17/b3729001.htm |archivedate=October 22, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;—the Bloomberg Terminal now functions as an application within the Windows environment.  From a user's perspective, there are essentially 3 distinct levels to the system:

=== Core Terminal ===
''Core Terminal'' refers to the original Bloomberg system; typically consisting of four windows, or ''Panels'', each Panel contains a separate instance of the terminal command line. As the user enters tickers and functions, they can call up and display the real-time data of the market, with each different screen simultaneously running a program to analyze other tickers, functions, values and markets in real time.  This use of multiple screens with user-demanded, specific pieces of differing data—across all relevant markets—allows the user to view diverse and countless volumes of information in real-time.  Accessing market data, as it develops, allows the user to make trades and investments in all markets across the world, without having any lag in information.  Users can run all four windows on a single monitor or spread them out amongst many monitors, maximizing the information shown on each, to effectually create up to four terminals.

In February 2012, Bloomberg LP publicly announced an upgrade to the Terminal called ''Bloomberg NEXT''. The stated goals of this multi-year, $100 million project were to improve the discoverability and usability of the Core Terminal's functionality, making it easier and more intuitive to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Edgecliffe-Johnson|first=Andrew|title=Bloomberg to reveal data service redesign|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8f429986-6093-11e1-af75-00144feabdc0.html|accessdate=April 15, 2012|newspaper=Financial Times|date=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Launchpad ===
Launchpad is a customizable display consisting of a number of smaller windows, called ''components'', each dedicated to permanently displaying one set of data. A typical user would be a stockbroker who wishes to keep a list of 30 stocks visible at all times: Launchpad allows the user to create a small component which will show these prices constantly, saving the user from having to check each stock independently in the 4 terminal windows. To turn on Launchpad the command {BLP &lt;GO&gt;} is used, {PDFB&lt;GO&gt;} allows users to set Lpad to open automatically on login. Older keyboards had an &lt;Lpad&gt; key which replicated the {BLP&lt;GO&gt;} command. Other functions, such as email inboxes, calculation tools and news tickers can be similarly displayed. The Instant Bloomberg messaging/chat tool is a Launchpad component, as are the chat windows it creates. To launch a normal function from the Bloomberg Terminal's 4 Screens into launchpad type {LLP&lt;GO&gt;} from the target screen you wish to turn into a launchpad item.

=== Application programming interface ===
The Bloomberg Open API (BLPAPI) [[application programming interface]] (API) allows [[Third-party software component|third-party]] applications, such as [[Microsoft Excel]], to access Bloomberg data via the Terminal and Bloomberg's market data products. A user might wish to use Bloomberg data from the Terminal to create their own calculations; by accessing streaming, historical, and reference market data from another program, they can build these formulae. The Bloomberg Terminal installation ships with Excel add-ins which facilitate building spreadsheets which consume market data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bloomberg Software Support|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/software_support/|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Bloomberg offers free BLPAPI SDKs allowing Bloomberg subscribers to build their own software which accesses market data in [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[.NET Framework|.NET]], [[Perl]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]], on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], [[macOS]], and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]].&lt;ref name=open_api&gt;{{cite web |title=Open API |url=http://www.openbloomberg.com/open-api/ |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |accessdate=May 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512182932/http://www.openbloomberg.com/open-api/ |archivedate=May 12, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competitors ==
{{Details|Financial data vendor}}
The largest competitor to the Bloomberg terminal is [[Thomson Reuters]] with its [[Reuters 3000 Xtra]] system, which was replaced by [[Eikon]] platform in 2010, with Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters splitting 30% each of the market share in 2011. This was a major improvement for Bloomberg as the share in 2007 was Bloomberg's 26% to Reuters' 36%.

Other major competitors include LevelTradingField.com, [[Money.Net]], the [https://www.infrontfinance.com/ Infront Professional Terminal], [[SIX Financial Information]], Morningstar Direct, [[Markit Group|Markit]], Zacks Investment Research, Research Exchange, [[FactSet Research Systems]], [[Capital IQ]], PrivateRaise.com, [https://www.advantagedata.com/ Advantage Data Inc], [[Fidessa]], Cogencis and [[Dow Jones and Company|Dow Jones]]. According to Burton-Taylor International Consulting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flamm|first=Matthew|title=Bloomberg LP beats Thomson Reuters|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20120223/MEDIA_ENTERTAINMENT/120229958|accessdate=April 15, 2012|newspaper=Crain's New York Business|date=February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the market for financial data and analytics was worth almost $25&amp;nbsp;billion as of 2011.

The medal is presented in a public lecture, usually at the annual Electrochem conference, which is organised by the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] (RSC) Electrochemistry Interest Group and the SCI Electrochemical Technology Group. When this is not possible, the medal presentation and lecture takes place at SCI's headquarters.

The medal's design was conceived by [[Humphrey Paget]] by commission of SCI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Editorial|journal=The Analyst|volume=78|issue=926|page=261|date=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least until 1958, the award was called Castner Gold Medal.&lt;ref name=RSC1958&gt;{{cite journal|title=News and Notes|journal=Journal of the Royal Institute of Chemistry|date=1958|volume=82|issue=January|page=61|doi=10.1039/JI9588200001|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticlePDF/1958/JI/JI9588200001|language=en|issn=0368-3958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''company store''' is a retail store selling a limited  range of food, clothing and daily necessities to employees of a company. It is typical of a [[company town]] in a remote area where virtually everyone is employed by one firm, such as a [[coal mine]]. In a company town, the housing is owned by the company but there may be independent stores there or nearby.

The store typically accepts [[scrip]] or non-cash vouchers issued by the company in advance of weekly cash paychecks, and gives credit to employees before payday.  Except in very remote areas, company stores became scarcer after the miners bought automobiles and could travel to a range of stores.  Even so, the stores could survive because they provided convenience and easy credit.

Company stores have had a reputation as [[monopoly|monopolistic]] institutions, funnelling workers' incomes back to the owners of the company. Company stores often faced little or no competition and prices were therefore uncompetitive. Allowing purchases on credit enforced a kind of [[debt slavery]], obligating employees to remain with the company until the debt was cleared.

Regarding this reputation, economic historian [[Price V. Fishback]] wrote that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The company store is one of the most reviled and misunderstood of economic institutions. In song, folktale, and union rhetoric the company store was often cast as a villain, a collector of souls through perpetual debt peonage. Nicknames, like the "pluck me" and more obscene versions that cannot appear in a family newspaper, seem to point to exploitation. The attitudes carry over into the scholarly literature, which emphasizes that the company store was a monopoly.&lt;ref&gt;Price V. Fishback, ''Soft Coal, Hard Choices: The Economic Welfare of Bituminous Coal Miners, 1890-1930'' (1992) p 131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
(The songs Fishback mentions include the popular folk song "[[Sixteen Tons|Sixteen Tons,"]] which includes such lines as "Saint Peter, don't you call me, 'cuz I can't go. I owe my soul to the company store.")

Company stores existed elsewhere than the United States, in particular in the early 1900s in Mexico, textile workers at the largest cotton mill were paid in scrip.  [[Río Blanco strike|In 1907 workers attacked]] and looted the [[Río Blanco, Veracruz]] textile company's store. The workers were gunned down by the Mexican military, but in the aftermath of the violence, more retail outlets were opened in Rio Blanco.&lt;ref&gt;John Kenneth Turner, ''Barbarous Mexico'' (1910) reissued by University of Texas Press, 1969, pp. 169-174.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stores served numerous functions, such as a locus for the government post office,  and as the cultural and community center where people could freely gather.&lt;ref&gt;Lou Athey, "The Company Store in Coal Town Culture," ''Labor's Heritage'' (1990) 2#1 pp 6-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dallas Semiconductor''', acquired by [[Maxim Integrated|Maxim Integrated Products]] in 2001, designed and manufactured analog, digital, and mixed-signal [[semiconductor]]s ([[integrated circuit]]s, or ICs).  Its specialties included communications products (including T/E and [[Ethernet]] products), [[microcontroller]]s, battery management, thermal sensing and thermal management, [[non-volatile random-access memory]], microprocessor supervisors, delay lines, silicon oscillators, digital [[potentiometer]]s, real-time clocks, temperature-compensated [[crystal oscillator]]s (TCXOs), [[1-Wire|iButton]], and [[1-Wire]] products.  The [[Dallas]], [[Texas]]-based company was founded in 1984 and purchased by Maxim Integrated Products in 2001.  Both the Maxim and Dallas Semiconductor brands were actively used until 2007.  Since then, the Maxim name has been used for all new products, though the Dallas Semiconductor brand has been retained for some older products, which can be identified by "DS" at the beginning of their part numbers.

[[File:Underwater Explosion with a Blue Water Navy Ship.jpg|200px|right|thumb|All mission-essential equipment on board naval ships and submarines must be qualified for shock loads caused by underwater explosions.]]

The '''dynamic design analysis method (DDAM)''' is a [[US Navy]]-developed analytical procedure for evaluating the design of equipment subject to [[structural load|dynamic loading]] caused by [[underwater explosion]]s (UNDEX). The analysis uses a form of [[shock response spectrum|shock spectrum analysis]] that estimates the dynamic response of a component to shock loading caused by the sudden movement of a naval vessel. The analytical process simulates the interaction between the shock-loaded component and its fixed structure, and it is a standard [[Naval architecture|naval engineering]] procedure for shipboard [[structural dynamics]].

== Background and rationale  ==

All mission-essential equipment on board military surface ships and submarines must be qualified for underwater shock loads caused by [[depth charge]]s, [[naval mine]]s, missiles, and [[torpedo]]es. An [[underwater explosion]] nearby a ship or submarine can be devastating to the combat readiness of the vessel. Damage may occur in the form of dished hull plating or even more serious holing of the hull. Moreover, some damage may not be obvious and can occur as a result of shock-wave loading of equipment and systems aboard the vessel. Equipment damage may incapacitate a vessel. Much research effort has been expended in the study of underwater shock, especially during the period after World War II where it became obvious that navy vessels could be disabled by a non-contact underwater explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mscsoftware.com/support/library/conf/wuc94/p03194.pdf |title=Dynamic Design Analysis Method (DDAM) Using MSC/NASTRAN |last1=Barber |first1=Pam |last2=Arden |first2=Kevin |date= |work= |publisher=Newport News Shipbuilding, Newport News, VA |accessdate=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a concerted effort was made to try to make shipboard equipment more resistant to shock. This was achieved through laboratory shock testing of equipment prior to its installation aboard vessels. With the advances in [[computer simulation]] and modeling capabilities, it is now possible to simulate a vessel's response to an [[underwater explosion]] and to identify potential problems or failures without extensive field testing. By using DDAM analytical techniques, money and time are saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyspec.com/USN/NAVY-General/DSTO-GD-0109_42397/ |title=''DSTO-GD-0109, The Response of Surface Ships to Underwater Explosions'' |publisher=Defense Science and Technology Organization – Commonwealth of Australia |date=September 1996 |accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis methodology ==

The DDAM simulates the interaction between the shock-loaded component and its fixed structure as the free motion of a naval vessel in water produces a higher shock spectrum than a heavy structure would when mounted to a terrestrial surface. The DDAM takes interaction into account in relation to the mass of the equipment, its mounting location, and the orientation of the equipment on the vessel.

Engineers use [[finite element method]] analysis software to verify designs using DDAM computer simulations that model the known characteristics of underwater explosion phenomena as well as the surface ship or submarine body responses to shock loading and application of a [[shock response spectrum|shock spectra]] in order to apply the appropriate shock responses at the mountings of shipboard equipment (e.g., masts, propulsion shafts, rudders, rudderstocks, bearings, exhaust uptakes and other critical structures) due to underwater explosions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyspec.com/USN/NAVY-General/TECH-RPT_SUPSHIP_280-2_42396/ |title=''SUPSHIP 280-2, Guide for Mathematical Modeling and Dynamic Shock Analysis of Rudders, Rudder Stocks, and Bearings'' |publisher=Supervisor of Shipbuilding, U.S. Navy |date=December 1970 |accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analytical process is described in ''NAVSEA 0908-LP-000-3010, Shock Design Criteria for Surface Ships''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyspec.com/USN/NAVY-General/NAVSEA_0908-LP-000-3010_REV-1_42398/ |title=''NAVSEA 0908-LP-000-3010 (Revision 1), Shock Design Criteria for Surface Ships'' |publisher=Naval Sea Systems Command  |date=September 1995 |accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides technical criteria for shock design calculations, and provides general background and educational material concerning application of the DDAM.

A number of commercially available computer modeling and simulation programs are available to assist in this task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nenastran.com/fea/ddam.php |title=''Nastran Finite Element Analysis and Simulation Software'' |publisher=NEi Software |date= |accessdate=2012-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130130074832/http://www.nenastran.com/fea/ddam.php |archivedate=January 30, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

After the analyst performs a natural frequency analysis to determine the mode shapes and natural frequencies, the DDAM process then uses an input spectrum of shock design values (i.e., displacements or accelerations) based on data from a series of unclassified [[United States Naval Research Laboratory|Naval Research Laboratory]] reports (primarily ''MR-1396, Design Values for Shock Design of Shipboard Equipment''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyspec.com/USN/NAVY-General/NRL_MEMO_RPT_1396_42392/ |title=''MR-1396, Design Values for Shock Design of Shipboard Equipment'' |publisher=Naval Research Laboratory  |date=January 1965 |accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''FR-6267, Background for Mechanical Shock Design of Ships''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyspec.com/USN/NAVY-General/NRL_Report__6267_42394/ |title=''FR-6267, Background for Mechanical Shock Design of Ship's Systems'' |publisher=Naval Research Laboratory  |date=March 12, 1975 |accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Compliance standards for DDAM simulation and analysis software are maintained by the [[Naval Sea Systems Command]] (NAVSEA).

== Reporting formats ==

The [[Naval Sea Systems Command]] (NAVSEA) established a standardized format to describe the content and formats for publishing results of the DDAM analyses and technical reports. These templates are called [[Data Item Descriptions]] (DID); once these are specified or tailored for a specific contract, they become [[Contract Data Requirements List]] items (CDRLs) that represent the deliverable items of a contract. Exactly which data items are required for delivery depends on the nature of the project. The DIDs for DDAM activities are the Analysis Report, Dynamic Shock'', ''Mathematical Model Report, Dynamic Shock Analysis'', and ''Dynamic Shock Analysis Extension Request''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyspec.com/DATA-ITEM-DESC-DIDs/DI-ENVR/DI-ENVR-81030_42435/ |title=''DI-ENVR-81030, Data Item Description: Analysis Report, Dynamic Shock'' |publisher=Naval Sea Systems Command  |date=September 26, 1990 |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyspec.com/DATA-ITEM-DESC-DIDs/DI-ENVR/DI-ENVR-81031_42437/ |title=''DI-ENVR-81031, Data Item Description: Mathematical Model Report, Dynamic Shock Analysis'' |publisher=Naval Sea Systems Command  |date=September 26, 1990 |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyspec.com/DATA-ITEM-DESC-DIDs/DI-ENVR/DI-ENVR-81279_42436/ |title=''DI-ENVR-81279, Data Item Description: Dynamic Shock Analysis Extension Request'' |publisher=Naval Sea Systems Command  |date=July 28, 1992 |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1695">The '''EEG DIN connector''' (also referred to as '''DIN 42802''' or '''EEG safety DIN connector''') is an [[electrical connector]] used to connect [[medical]] and [[biomedical]] recording systems, such as [[electrode]]s to [[electroencephalograph]] (EEG) as used in [[neurology]]. This type of connector is the ''de facto'' standard for electromedical instruments as it was adopted by the industry under pressure from regulatory bodies (including the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]) to impose insulated connectors in clinical settings for safety reasons through the [[IEC 60601]]-1 (subclause 56.3(c)) norm.

In 1989, the [[Deutsches Institut für Normung]] has issued the 42802 standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DKE Deutsche Kommission Elektrotechnik Elektronik Informationstechnik in DIN und VDE |url=https://www.din.de/de/mitwirken/normenausschuesse/dke?level=tpl-art-detailansicht&amp;committeeid=54738887&amp;artid=1441533&amp;languageid=en&amp;bcrumblevel=3 |website=www.din.de |accessdate=1 November 2018|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; which specified a "touch-proof connector for electromedical application".

The EEG DIN connector mainly exist  in two types both featuring touch-proof sockets around in-line rigid plugs :
* The DIN 42802-1 connector with a 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm diameter pin
* And the E-DIN 42802-2 with a 2&amp;nbsp;mm diameter pin.

'''Electronic counter-countermeasures''' ('''ECCM''') is a part of [[electronic warfare]] which includes a variety of practices which attempt to reduce or eliminate the effect of [[electronic countermeasure]]s (ECM) on electronic [[sensor]]s aboard vehicles, ships and aircraft and weapons such as [[missile]]s. ECCM is also known as '''electronic protective measures''' (EPM), chiefly in [[Europe]]. In practice, EPM often means resistance to [[radio jamming|jamming]].

==History==
Ever since electronics have been used in battle in an attempt to gain superiority over the enemy, effort has been spent on techniques to reduce the effectiveness of those electronics. More recently, sensors and weapons are being modified to deal with this threat. One of the most common types of [[Electronic countermeasures|ECM]] is [[radar jamming]] or [[Spoofing attack|spoofing]]. This originated with the [[Royal Air Force|Royal Air Force's]] use of what they codenamed ''window'' during [[World War II]], which is now often referred to as ''[[Chaff (radar countermeasure)|chaff]]''. Jamming also may have originated with the British during World War II, when they began jamming [[History of Germany during World War II|German]] [[radio]] communications.

In perhaps the first example of ECCM, the Germans increased their radio transmitter power in an attempt to 'burn through' or override the British jamming, which by necessity of the [[Radio jamming|jammer]] being airborne or further away produced weaker signals. This is still one of the primary methods of ECCM today. For example, modern airborne jammers are able to identify incoming [[radar]] signals from other aircraft and send them back with random delays and other modifications in an attempt to confuse the opponent's radar set, making the 'blip' jump around wildly and be impossible to range. More powerful airborne radars means that it is possible to 'burn through' the jamming at much greater ranges by overpowering the jamming energy with the actual radar returns. The Germans were not really able to overcome the chaff spoofing very successfully and had to work around it (by guiding the aircraft to the target area and then having them visually acquire the targets).

Today, more powerful electronics with smarter [[software]] for operation of the radar might be able to better discriminate between a moving target like an aircraft and an almost stationary target like a chaff bundle.

With the technology going into modern sensors and seekers, it is inevitable that all successful systems have to have ECCM designed into them, lest they become useless on the battlefield. In fact, the 'electronic battlefield' is often used to refer to ECM, ECCM and [[signals intelligence#ELINT|ELINT]] activities, indicating that this has become a secondary battle in itself.

==Specific ECCM techniques==
The following are some examples of EPM (other than simply increasing the [[fidelity]] of sensors through techniques such as increasing power or improving discrimination):

===ECM detection===
Sensor logic may be programmed to be able to recognize attempts at spoofing (e.g., aircraft dropping chaff during terminal homing phase) and ignore them. Even more sophisticated applications of ECCM might be to recognize the type of ECM being used, and be able to cancel out the signal.

===Pulse compression by "chirping", or linear frequency modulation===
One of the effects of the [[pulse compression]] technique, is boosting the apparent signal strength as perceived by the radar receiver.  The outgoing radar pulses are [[chirp]]ed, that is, the frequency of the carrier is varied within the pulse, much like the sound of a cricket chirping.  When the pulse reflects off a target and returns to the receiver, the signal is processed to add a delay as a function of the frequency.  This has the effect of 'stacking' the pulse so it seems stronger, but shorter in duration, to further processors.  The effect can increase the received signal strength to above that of noise jamming.  Similarly, jamming pulses (used in deception jamming) will not typically have the same chirp, so will not benefit from the increase in signal strength.

===Frequency hopping===
[[Frequency]] agility ('[[frequency hopping]]') may be used to rapidly switch the frequency of the transmitted energy, and receiving only that frequency during the receiving time window. This foils jammers which cannot detect this frequency switch quickly enough nor predict the next hop frequency, and switch their own jamming frequency accordingly during the receiving time window. The most advanced jamming techniques have a very wide and fast frequency range, and might possibly jam out also an antijammer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.rbth.com/economics/2014/05/15/russia_surges_ahead_in_radio-electronic_warfare_35247]&lt;/ref&gt;

This method is also useful against [[barrage jamming]], in that it forces the jammer to spread its jamming power across multiple frequencies in the jammed system's frequency range, reducing its power in the actual frequency used by the equipment at any one time. The use of [[spread-spectrum]] techniques allow signals to be spread over a wide enough spectrum to make jamming of such a wideband signal difficult.

===Sidelobe blanking===
[[Radar jamming]] can be effective from directions other than the direction the radar antenna is currently aimed.  When jamming is strong enough, the radar receiver can detect it from a relatively low gain sidelobe.  The radar, however, will process signals as if they were received in the main lobe.  Therefore, jamming can be seen in directions other than where the jammer is located.  To combat this, an [[omnidirectional antenna|omnidirectional]] antenna is used for a comparison signal.  By comparing the signal strength as received by both the omnidirectional and the (directional) main antenna, signals can be identified that are not from the direction of interest.  These signals are then ignored.

===Polarization===
[[Polarization (waves)|Polarization]] can be used to filter out unwanted signals, such as jamming. If a jammer and receiver do not have the same polarization, the jamming signal will incur a loss that reduces its effectiveness. The four Basic polarizations are linear horizontal, linear vertical, right-hand circular, and left-hand circular.  The signal loss inherent in a cross polarized (transmitter different from receiver) pair is 3 [[decibels|dB]] for dissimilar types, and 17&amp;nbsp;dB for opposites.

Aside from power loss to the jammer, radar receivers can also benefit from using two or more antennas of differing polarization and comparing the signals received on each.  This effect can effectively eliminate all jamming of the wrong polarization, although enough jamming may still obscure the actual signal.

===Radiation homing===
The other main aspect of ECCM, is to program sensors or seekers to detect attempts at ECM and possible even to take advantage of it. For example, some modern [[fire-and-forget]] missiles like the [[Vympel R-77]] and the [[AMRAAM]] are able to home in directly on sources of radar jamming if the jamming is too powerful to allow them to find and track the target normally. This mode, called 'home-on-jam', actually makes the missile's job easier. Some missile seekers actually target the enemy's radiation sources, and are therefore called "[[anti-radiation missile]]s" (ARM). The jamming in this case effectively becomes a beacon announcing the presence and location of the [[transmitter]]. This makes the use of such ECM a difficult decision; it may serve to obscure an exact location from a non-ARM missile, but in doing so it must put the jamming vehicle at risk of being targeted and hit by ARMs.

'''The Federation Against Software Theft''' (FAST) is a [[not-for-profit organisation]], formed in 1984 with the aim of eliminating [[copyright infringement of software]] in the UK. FAST was the world's first [[Copy protection#Anti-piracy|Anti-piracy]] [[organisation]] to work on protecting the [[copyright]]s of [[software publisher]]s. Initially concentrating on lobbying parliament to revise [[Copyright law]], FAST also prosecutes organisations and individuals for copyright infringement on behalf of its members and publicises the [[legal penalties]] and [[security]] risks.

Prior to the agreement with FAST, Investors in Software were a [[not-for-profit organisation]] limited by guarantee with a mission to support and advance professionalism in [[Software Asset Management]] and related IT asset management, to enable individuals and organisations to improve effectiveness and efficiency. As a direct result of their work the ISO SAM [[ISO 19770]] standard was successfully launched in May 2006.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

==History==
In September 2008 FAST and Investors in Software signed an exclusive agreement to operate under the Federation name{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} to strengthen and clarify the advice given to the end user community relating to best practice for [[Software Asset Management]] (SAM) and achieving cost efficient licence [[compliance (regulation)|compliance]]. The new organisation will operate under the name FAST IiS.

In May 2008 FAST IiS launched an initiative with the aim of making it easier for end users to manage their [[software licensing]] requirements to contain costs and ensure effective ''[[Software Asset Management]] / software licence management'' encompassing [[compliance (regulation)|compliance]], the Software Industry Research Board (SIRB), was formed in consultation with five of the tier one software vendors.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

FAST IiS remains a [[not-for-profit organisation]] limited by guarantee and wholly owned by its members who include [[software publisher]]s, [[resellers]], distributors, SAM practitioners and [[law firms]]. FAST IiS works to champion the professional management of software and protect members’ rights.

Since its inception FAST has successfully lobbied for changes in the software [[Intellectual property|IP]] system in the UK and EU through its dealings with the [[UK Intellectual Property Office]]. FAST's lobbying efforts brought about amendments to the Copyright Act 1956, culminating in software being recognised as a literary work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawyerslegalaid.co.uk/faqs.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220010211/http://www.lawyerslegalaid.co.uk/faqs.cfm |archivedate=2008-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 FAST, with the [[Alliance Against IP Theft]], was successful in pushing for the implementation of Section 107A Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 and having IP crime as a measurement on the National Policing Safety Plan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2007/02/20/221930/government-gets-tough-on-software-compliance.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''flaming sword''' is a [[sword]] that has been coated with some type of [[combustion|combustible]] [[fuel]], with the fuel being set on [[fire]]. This is most widely done for entertainment purposes in [[circuses]], [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] performances and other forms of display as a side act of [[sword swallowers]], [[fire eating]], etc.

The [[six factor formula]] defines each of these terms in much more detail.

==Multiplication==
The multiplication factor, {{mvar|k}}, is defined as (see [[Nuclear chain reaction]]): 
:&lt;math&gt;k =  \frac{\mbox{neutron population following nth generation}}{\mbox{neutron population during nth generation}}&lt;/math&gt;

* If {{mvar|k}} is greater than 1, the chain reaction is ''supercritical,'' and the neutron population will grow exponentially. 
* If {{mvar|k}} is less than 1, the chain reaction is ''subcritical,'' and the neutron population will exponentially decay. 
* If {{math|1= ''k'' = 1}}, the chain reaction is ''critical'' and the neutron population will remain constant.

In an infinite medium, neutrons cannot leak out of the system and the multiplication factor becomes the infinite multiplication factor, &lt;math&gt;k = k_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;, which is approximated by the four-factor formula.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13193">'''G. Norris Glasoe''' (29 October 1902 &amp;ndash; May 1987) was an [[United States|American]] [[nuclear physicist]]. He was a member of the [[Columbia University]] team which was the first in the United States to verify the European discovery of the [[nuclear fission]] of [[uranium]] via neutron bombardment. During [[World War II]], he worked at the [[MIT Radiation Laboratory]]. He was a physicist and administrator at the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]].

==Background==
Gynther Norris Glasoe was born in [[Northfield, MN]] to Dr. Paul M. Glasoe and Gena (Kirkwold) Glasoe, both children of Norwegian immigrants. He had two younger brothers: Paul K. Glasoe (1913–2008) and Alf M. Glasoe (1909–2006)&lt;ref&gt;1920 Federal Census State of Minnesota, County of Rice&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Glasoe completed his undergraduate degree in 1924 at [[St. Olaf College]] in [[Northfield, Minnesota]].  He received his advanced degrees, including his doctorate, from the [[University of Wisconsin]]; a degree was awarded in 1926. After earning his doctorate, Glasoe did research at the [[University of Wisconsin]] and then joined the physics faculty at the [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name="digicoll.library.wisc.edu"&gt;George Richard (ed.)

==Career==
[[John R. Dunning]], professor of physics at Columbia, closely followed the work of [[Ernest Lawrence]] on the [[cyclotron]]. Dunning wanted a more powerful neutron source and the cyclotron appeared as an attractive tool to achieve this end. During 1935 and 1936, he was able construct a cyclotron using many salvaged parts to reduce costs and funding from industrial and private donations. Glasoe, Dana P. Mitchell, and Hugh Paxton, junior members of the physics faculty at Columbia, worked on the cyclotron part-time. At the suggestion of Mitchell, Dunning offered [[Herbert L. Anderson]] a teaching assistant position if he would also help with the design and building of the cyclotron during work on his doctorate in physics, which he did. Others assisting in the construction of the cyclotron were [[Eugene T. Booth]] and Hugh Glassford. The cyclotron would in a few years be used by Dunning, Glasoe, and Anderson in a historic experiment based on the discovery of nuclear fission in Europe in December 1938 and January 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Broad, William J.

In December 1938, the German chemists [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]] sent a manuscript to ''[[Die Naturwissenschaften|Naturwissenschaften]]'' reporting they had detected the element [[barium]] after bombarding [[uranium]] with [[neutrons]];&lt;ref&gt;O. Hahn and F. Strassmann ''Über den Nachweis und das Verhalten der bei der Bestrahlung des Urans mittels Neutronen entstehenden Erdalkalimetalle'' (''On the detection and characteristics of the alkaline earth metals formed by irradiation of uranium with neutrons''), ''Naturwissenschaften'' Volume 27, Number 1, 11-15 (1939). The authors were identified as being at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Chemie, Berlin-Dahlem. Received 22 December 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; simultaneously, they communicated these results to [[Lise Meitner]]. Meitner, and her nephew [[Otto Robert Frisch]], correctly interpreted these results as being [[nuclear fission]].&lt;ref&gt;Lise Meitner and O. R. Frisch ''Disintegration of Uranium by Neutrons: a New Type of Nuclear Reaction'', ''Nature'', Volume 143, Number 3615, 239-240 [http://www.nature.com/physics/looking-back/meitner/index.html (11 February 1939)]. The paper is dated 16 January 1939. Meitner is identified as being at the Physical Institute, Academy of Sciences, Stockholm. Frisch is identified as being at the Institute of Theoretical Physics, University of Copenhagen.&lt;/ref&gt; Frisch confirmed this experimentally on 13 January 1939.&lt;ref&gt;O. R. Frisch ''Physical Evidence for the Division of Heavy Nuclei under Neutron Bombardment'', ''Nature'', Volume 143, Number 3616, 276-276 [http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/Chem-History/Frisch-Fission-1939.html (18 February 1939)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123165907/http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/Chem-History/Frisch-Fission-1939.html |date=January 23, 2009 }}. The paper is dated 17 January 1939. [The experiment for this letter to the editor was conducted on 13 January 1939; see Richard Rhodes ''The Making of the Atomic Bomb'' 263 and 268 (Simon and Schuster, 1986).]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, Hahn  received the [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]] for the discovery of nuclear fission. Some historians have documented the history of the discovery of nuclear fission and believe Meitner should have been awarded the Nobel Prize with Hahn.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Lewin Sime]] ''From Exceptional Prominence to Prominent Exception: Lise Meitner at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry'' [http://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/KWG/Ergebnisse/Ergebnisse24.pdf Ergebnisse 24] Forschungsprogramm ''Geschichte der Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft im Nationalsozialismus'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Lewin Sime ''Lise Meitner: A Life in Physics'' (University of California, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Crawford, Ruth Lewin Sime, and Mark Walker ''A Nobel Tale of Postwar Injustice'', ''Physics Today'' Volume 50, Issue 9, 26-32 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before it was published, Meitner's and Frisch's interpretation of the work of Hahn and Strassmann crossed the Atlantic Ocean with [[Niels Bohr]], who was to lecture at [[Princeton University]]. [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]] and [[Willis Lamb]], two [[Columbia University]] physicists working at Princeton, heard the news and carried it back to Columbia. Rabi said he told Fermi; Fermi gave credit to Lamb. Bohr soon thereafter went from Princeton to Columbia to see Fermi. Not finding Fermi in his office, Bohr went down to the cyclotron area and found Anderson. Bohr grabbed him by the shoulder and said: "Young man, let me explain to you about something new and exciting in physics."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rhodes ''The Making of the Atomic Bomb'' 268 (Simon and Schuster, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; It was clear to a number of scientists at Columbia that they should try to detect the energy released in the nuclear fission of uranium from neutron bombardment. On 25 January 1939, Glasoe was a member of the experimental team at Columbia University which conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;H. L. Anderson, E. T. Booth, J. R. Dunning, E. Fermi, G. N. Glasoe, and F. G. Slack ''The Fission of Uranium'', ''Phys. Rev.'' Volume 55, Number 5,  511 - 512 (1939). Institutional citation: Pupin Physics Laboratories, Columbia University, New York, New York. Received 16 February 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; which was done in the basement of [[Pupin Hall]]; the other members of the team were [[Herbert L. Anderson]], [[Eugene T. Booth]], [[John R. Dunning]], [[Enrico Fermi]], and [[Francis G. Slack]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rhodes ''The Making of the Atomic Bomb'' 267-270 (Simon and Schuster, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Glasoe was a staff member and associate group leader at the [[Radiation Laboratory]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name="9 June 1965"/&gt;

No later than 1948, and as late as 1965, Glasoe was at the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] (BNL), [[Upton, New York|Upton]], [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. He was associate chairman of the BNL physics department no later than 1952 and associate director of BNL no later than 1965.&lt;ref name="digicoll.library.wisc.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="9 June 1965"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liz Seubert ''50 Years of Service to BNL: Irving Feigenbaum, Alternating Gradient Synchrotron Department'', ''Brookhaven Bulletin'' [http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/pubaf/bulletin/1999/bb081399.pdf 13 August 1999].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:US-IL-Chicagoland-GoldenCorridor.PNG|200px|thumb|right|The Golden Corridor in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]]]]
The '''Golden Corridor''' is the area around the [[Jane Addams Memorial Tollway]] ([[Interstate 90 (Illinois)|Interstate 90]]), formerly known as the Northwest Tollway, in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hanoverparkillinois.org/EconomicDevelopment/Demographics.htm Demographics, Hanover Park, Illinois (IL)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401065948/http://www.hanoverparkillinois.org/EconomicDevelopment/Demographics.htm |date=April 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is coined as such since the corridor generates a "gold" mine of economic profit for communities in the area.  Several [[Fortune 500]] company headquarters, [[office park]]s, [[industrial park]]s, exhibition and entertainment centers, medical facilities, hotels, shopping centers, and restaurants are located along the Golden Corridor. With the exception of the O'Hare area of Chicago, all of the communities located in this region are part of a larger region known as the "Northwest Suburbs".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41207">'''[[Green building]] on college campuses''' is the purposeful [[construction]] of buildings on [[college]] campuses that decreases resource usage in both the building process and also the future use of the building.  The goal is to reduce {{CO2}} emissions, energy use, and water use, while creating an atmosphere where students can be healthy and learn. Universities across the country are building to green standards set forth by the USGBC, [[United States Green Building Council]].  The USGBC is a non-profit organization that promotes [[sustainability]] in how buildings are designed and built.  This organization created the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) rating system, which is a certification process that provides verification that a building is environmentally sustainable. In the United States, commercial and residential buildings account for 70 percent of the electricity use and over 38 percent of [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions|{{CO2}} emissions]].&lt;ref name="Plan B 3.0"&gt;{{cite book|title= Plan B 3.0|year= 2008|author=Lester Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these huge statistics regarding resource usage and emissions, the room for more efficient building practices is dramatic.  Since college campuses are where the world’s future leaders are being taught, colleges are choosing to construct new buildings to green standards in order to promote environmental stewardship to their students.  Colleges across the United States have taken leading roles in the construction of green building in order to reduce [[resource consumption]], save money in the long run, and instill the importance on environmental sustainability on their students.It is a better way to motivate new generation to live a sustainable life.

==Benefits of Green Building on Campuses==
Green buildings on college campuses provide benefits to the campus in several different ways.  Campuses can benefit from the short and long term economic benefits.  Initially, federal and state governments will sometimes provide tax incentives for buildings constructed that surpass the standards set by the government.  There are also long term savings. According to the USGBC, with an upfront investment of 2% in green building design, the resulting life savings is 20% of the total construction costs. With many universities lacking funding, this kind of savings could dramatically help the yearly budget.  Along with this increase in monetary savings, [[green building]] and [[architecture]] has been proven to make the occupants more productive.  Studies have shown a link between improved lighting design and a 27% reduction in the incidence of headaches.  Also, students with the most daylighting in their classrooms progressed 20% faster on math tests and 26% faster on reading tests in one year than those with less daylighting.  Both of these studies show that better lighting conditions, which are one of the main features of green buildings, can increase the productivity of its occupants.  Students at colleges where green buildings are being used will benefit by increasing their potential to gain knowledge.&lt;ref name="USGBC: Green Building Research"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1718|title=USGBC: Green Building Research|accessdate=2009-11-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004164457/http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?cmspageID=1718|archivedate=2009-10-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last important benefit of green buildings on college campuses is having the university seen as environmentally sustainable.  Students are becoming increasingly aware of the issues the Earth faces with carbon emissions and increased consumption.  These students want to attend universities that are striving to reduce their environmental impact.  Universities participating in sustainable initiatives, like constructing green buildings, will attract more highly qualified students.  Green buildings on campuses benefit both the school as well as the students.

==LEED Rating System==
Many institutions in the United States are administering the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Green Building Rating System. The development of the LEED Rating System has been nationally recognized as the leading method to construct green buildings. The rating system incorporates the design, construction, and maintenance of the building. LEED promotes a cradle-to-cradle approach in regards to construction and design materials. The rating system is composed of six sections: Site Planning, Water Management, Energy Management, Material Use, Indoor Air Quality, and the Innovation &amp; Design Process. Each section is composed of credits and points, which ultimately determine how "green" the building is constructed, designed, and maintained.

===LEED Certification Levels===
LEED has four different levels of certification. All depending on how many credits and points were obtained through the LEED Rating System. There are 100 possible base points plus an additional 6 points for Innovation in Design and 4 points for Regional Priority.

Buildings can qualify for 4 types of certification:
*'''Certified''': 40-49 Points
*'''Silver''': 50-59 Points
*'''Gold''': 60-79 Points
*'''Platinum''': 80 points and above

===LEED - NC Application Guide for Multiple Buildings and On-Campus Building Projects (AGMBC)===
The USGBC has issued an application guide for administration of LEED Rating System on college, corporate, or government installations that include multiple buildings. This application is designed for projects where several buildings will be constructed at once, in phases, or a single building is constructed in a setting of existing buildings with common ownership. Note, however, that the AGMBC applies to LEED Rating System Versions 2.1 and 2.2. The methods described still apply to new construction on campuses.

====Issues with AGMBC====
The sustainable sites category is the most challenging category, and it is the most detailed section in the AGMBC.&lt;ref name="Real Life LEED: Certifying Multiple Buildings Together? Part 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reallifeleed.com/2008/04/certifying-multiple-leed-buildings-part.html|title=Real Life LEED: Certifying Multiple Buildings Together? Part2|accessdate=2009-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Campus settings sometimes have established property lines through campus, but share a common infrastructure between areas. (Examples include street lighting may encroach on another building, storm water routes may go into same retention areas)
*One overall sign for LEED certification, may not appeal to college trying to market LEED dedication.

====Multi-Building Certification Methods====
#Certifying a new building within a setting of existing buildings that are considered a campus, i.e. there is one owner or common property management and control. Use of a [[retention pond]] not on "site" but on campus, would still qualify for LEED credit.
#Certifying a group of new buildings as a package where the entire building set will be rated as a package and only one rating received. These buildings may constitute the entire campus or be a subset of an existing campus.
#Certifying new buildings where each new building is constructed to a set of standards but will receive an independent rating based on achievement of credits beyond the standards specific to that building. These buildings may constitute the entire campus or be subset of an existing campus.

===Required LEED Levels for Select Colleges===
These are 10 colleges all around the US determined to build for a sustainable future. Each college outlines their commitment in Campus Sustainability Initiatives and Mission statements.&lt;ref name="USGBC: Green Building Links"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=76#5|title=USGBC: Green Building Links|accessdate=2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Usgbc.jpg|thumb|United States Green Building Council LEED Rating System]]

==Campus Green Building Techniques==
The following methods are becoming more prevalent on campuses around the nation. Because of the large scale of college campuses, the impact of these methods are truly praise for energy savings and enhanced occupants' comfort.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
*[[Green roofs]] - Living, vegetative roofing alternatives; a solution to the heat island effect associated with buildings.
*Low VOC paints - Drastically limits any odorous, harmful, or irritating emissions and enhance the occupants' comfort.
*[[Compact fluorescent]] bulbs - Uses less energy and give off less heat; will save energy used to cool the building.
*Using recycled content
*Buying and using local materials - Local materials have lower transportation costs because of the lower amount of energy needed to move materials.
*Tree preservation and relocation
*Low flow plumbing fixtures - Uses less water per flush.
*Alternative transportation - Campuses utilize bike transportation, rapid bus transit, and safe pedestrian walkways. [[Zipcar]] is also becoming popular on many college campuses.

==Sustainable Materials used in Green Building==
The following are some examples&lt;ref name="University of Florida FP&amp;C Student Presentations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facilities.ufl.edu/sustain/student_presentations.htm|title=University of Florida FP&amp;C Student Presentations|author=Lianne Jepson &amp; Heather Shandloff|accessdate=2009-11-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018120507/http://www.facilities.ufl.edu/sustain/student_presentations.htm|archivedate=2009-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of sustainable products used in green building. These materials are less harmful to the environment. Now-a-days many materials have a "green" substitute.

====International Sustainable Campus Network====
Universities have a leadership role in advancing knowledge, technology and tools to create a sustainable future. To fulfill this role effectively and with high credibility, they need to include a focus on sustainability also in their own operations and facilities. Campus projects, be they educational or corporate campus developments, present interesting sustainability challenges and opportunities. Firstly, their size is at the borderline between single building projects and small towns, a fruitful scale for innovative energy and transport solutions. And secondly, they are to a certain degree one-purpose neighborhoods focused on education, research, development or distribution of new ideas, products or services.
* Goal 1: sustainable construction, renovation, and operation
* Goal 2. sustainable master planning and development, mobility, and community integration
* Goal 3. linking facilities, research and education for sustainable development

====University of California at Santa Barbara: Donald Bren School of Environmental Science &amp; Management====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:11 bren1.jpg|thumb|Building Bren Hall with sustainable materials and methods is estimated to have added only 2% to the building cost, which will easily be offset over time by energy savings]] --&gt;The Donald Bren School of Environmental Science &amp; Management is located at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], California.  The academic laboratory and classroom facility demonstrates cost-effective, energy-efficient technologies and operations.  The concrete and steel frame structure was complete in 2002 and cost approximately $27,500,000.  Donald Bren Hall was the first laboratory to receive LEED Platinum accreditation, the highest rating achievable through the US Green Building Council’s national rating system, with the following building design features:
*'''Site Protection''': Since Donald Bren Hall is located adjacent to the ocean, a strict site protection plan was developed and implemented to ensure all storm water is retained onsite to prevent contamination of local waterways.
*'''[[Water Efficiency]]''': A separate [[reclaimed water]] system was installed to furnish [[greywater]] to flush toilets and irrigate the landscape. Waterless urinals were also installed and it is estimated that each waterless urinal will save approximately 45,000 gallons of water per year.
*'''Energy Efficiency''': Design includes a 40 KW rooftop photovoltaic system, natural ventilation linked with a window interlock system for heating, daylighting controls, energy-efficient lighting, high efficiency boiler, and chiller integrated into a virtual chilled water loop. These energy efficiency measures assisted the building to exceed Title 24 (1998 Standards) by 31%.
*'''Materials Efficiency''': 93% of the construction waste generated onsite was diverted from the landfill. Recycled-content products include 12-20% flyash in the concrete, glass tiles and countertops, 100% postconsumer recycled content carpet, and tire-derived rubber flooring. Other environmentally preferable products for the interior surface materials included linoleum and natural cork flooring, bamboo cabinetry, and stained concrete flooring.&lt;ref name="Sustainable Building"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/GREENBUILDING/CaseStudies/Educational/DonaldBren.htm|author=Gregory Dick|date=2009-10-05|accessdate=2009-11-16|title=Donald Bren School of Environmental Science &amp; Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Great Buildings, "The Donald Bren School at the University of California, Santa Barbara takes advantage of a beautiful setting near the [[Pacific Ocean]] to become a green building that embraces its environment not only for efficiency, but for experience. With a striking open courtyard, it provides ample opportunity for social interaction that makes the transition between indoors and outdoors much smoother and ephemeral than most buildings.  Building Bren Hall with sustainable materials and methods is estimated to have added only 2% to the building cost, which will easily be offset over time by energy savings."&lt;ref name="Donald Bren School of Environmental Science &amp; Management"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/UCSB_Bren_School.html|title=Donald Bren School of Environmental Science &amp; Management|accessdate=2009-11-16|author=Great Buildings Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Site Selection and Design''': The Education center was located with an efficient solar orientation.  Also, during the construction process, there was minimal disturbance to grade, and existing vegetation was well protected.
*'''Water Efficiency''': The building uses water-efficient native landscaping and low-flow plumbing.  Stormwater is conserved and re-used.  Rainwater cisterns, gardens, and retention swales are also methods being used.
*'''Energy Efficiency''': [[Geothermal]] wells for efficient heating and air-conditioning are used. [[Photovoltaic]] and solar cells have been installed on the building, and natural lighting is used very effectively along with day sensors that automatically dim lights when daylight is too strong.
*'''Materials Efficiency''': To minimize transportation costs and carbon dioxide emissions, and to stimulate local economies, all materials were locally and sustainably produced.  No wood came from old-growth trees; all the wood came from certified sustainable forests.  At least 75% of the construction waste was recycled, and there was no non-toxic or off-gassing.&lt;ref name="An Environmentally Sustainable Education Center for the North Carolina Botanical Garden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbg.unc.edu/pages/4|title=An Environmentally Sustainable Education Center for the North Carolina Botanical Garden|author=Laura Cotterman|accessdate=2009-11-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904005508/http://ncbg.unc.edu/pages/4/|archive-date=2009-09-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hancock 4700 air whistle.jpg|thumb|200px|Hancock model 4700 air whistle intended for use on diesel locomotives]]
The '''Hancock air whistle''' was a [[railroad]] [[whistle]] intended for use on [[North America]]n [[diesel locomotive]]s in place of the standard [[Train horn|air horn]].

== History ==

===Steam era===
Hancock was a familiar name to railroads during the days of [[steam locomotive|steam]]. The company produced many appliances, one of which was the popular long-bell three-chime [[steam whistle]]. When railroads began [[dieselisation|dieselising]], Hancock, along with other manufacturers of railroad equipment, adjusted their offerings in order to remain competitive. And so Hancock modified their whistle design so they could be used on diesel locomotives.

===Diesel era===
Hancock already had vast experience with whistles, and practically none with horns. Also, diesel locomotives were an emerging technology, and most early models were equipped with single-note 'honkers'. These horns were anything but appealing to the general public. Therefore, Hancock developed their line of air whistles in an attempt to [[Romanticism|romanticize]] the diesel locomotives. Production of these air whistles spanned from the late 1950s until the late 1960s.

===Users===
The [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] was the largest user of these whistles, and every [[EMD FL9|FL9]] purchased by the New Haven came from the factory equipped with a Hancock 4700 air whistle on the roof in the front, and an H4700 whistle (no reflector dish) on the rear.  Additionally, the NH's 40 Budd RDCs had two Hancock 4700 whistles, plus their Mack FCD-1 &amp; FCD-2 railbuses, 30 GP9s, 15 RS-11s, 15 H-16-44s, 20 SW1200s &amp; their fleet of Pullman-Westinghouse stainless steel MUs.  One DL-109 was also retrofitted with a pair.  Other railroads occasionally used them, notably the New York Central on some RS-3s, the Seaboard Air Line on their SDP-35s, the Cambria &amp; Indiana on its SW9s, and the Minneapolis, Northfield &amp; Southern.  Unfortunately, it was found that at high speeds, the whistles were difficult to hear.  Class I railroads eventually replaced their Hancock whistles with horns, namely for safety reasons. Short line users were generally steel mill railroads, where it was found that the whistle was easier to hear than a horn within the mill.

== Types of air whistles ==

Hancock offered three different models of their air whistle. The most common was the 4700, which consisted of the whistle along with a large, rectangular bowl in the same plane as the languid plate. This bowl, or [[wikt:reflector|reflector]], is used to project the sound of the whistle ahead of the locomotive, instead of [[wikt:omnidirectional|omnidirectional]] as in the case of most whistles. The second model was the 4700-2. This whistle is basically the same as the 4700 except that it has an electric heating element installed in the bowl to keep it from freezing. The final offering was the H4700, which did not include the reflector bowl. Aside from this difference, it is basically identical to the 4700.

The Hancock air whistles were all designed so that the bell of the whistle is horizontal when mounted on a standard horn mount. All the whistles are a single-bell chime, playing the notes E A C{{music|sharp}} (A major triad) when blown on air. However, over time, many of the whistles got off-key and produced some variants. One common [[chord (music)|chord]] was E A C#.

[[DVD]] (initially an initialism abbreviation of "Digital Video Disc," then modified to "Digital Versatile Disc," then officially just "DVD") was the mass-market successor to CD.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=backronym&amp;i=56302,00.asp backronym Definition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; DVD was rolled out in 1996, again initially for video and audio. [[DVD recordable]] formats developed some time later: [[DVD-R]] in late 1997 and [[DVD+R]] in 2002. Although DVD was initially intended to prevent a [[format war]] in fact one did arise between these two formats. It was resolved with both surviving however: DVD-R predominating for stand-alone DVD recorders and players, and (for computers) most DVD devices being engineered as [[dual format]], to be compatible with both.

With the development of [[high-definition television]], and the popularization of [[broadband]] and digital storage of movies, a further format development took place, again giving rise to two camps: [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]], based upon a switch from red to blue-violet laser and tighter engineering tolerances. After suffering a number of significant losses to Blu-ray, Toshiba announced their withdrawal from HD DVD on 19 February 2008.

{{As of|2007}}, future development beyond Blu-ray Disc appear to be based upon one or more of the following technologies, all in varying stages of development:
* [[Holographic data storage]].
* [[3D optical data storage]].
* [[Near-field optics]]
* Solid immersion optics (allowing an extremely high [[numerical aperture]]).
* Discs utilizing very short wavelengths such as [[ultraviolet|UV]] or [[X-ray]]s.
* Layer selection discs ([[LS-R]]).
* [[MultiLevel|Multi-level]] technology.
* Complex pit shapes allowing multiple channels to be stored on one track.

According to Stanford Sustainable Systems Lab, home idle load constitutes an average of 32% of household electricity consumption in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kwac |first= J. |last2= Flora |first2= J.|date= 2014 |title= Household Energy Consumption Segmentation Using Hourly Data |url= |journal= IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid |volume= 5|issue= 1|pages= 420–430|doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Meier |first= Alan |last2= |first2=  |date= 2015 |title= Standby Power|url= |journal=  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Type of devices==
 
The primary categories of devices that contribute to Home Idle Load include:
 
* [[Electronic device]]s that consume [[electricity]] while not being actively used (including [[televisions]], [[game console]]s, [[digital picture frame]]s, etc.)
* [[Home]] [[infrastructure]] devices (including analog [[thermostats]], [[doorbell]]s, [[telephone]]s, [[clock]]s, [[GFCI]] [[Electrical outlet|outlet]]s, [[smoke alarm]]s, continuous hot water recirculation pumps, etc.).
* Any type of device used to maintain a continuous temperature differential (including [[freezer]]s, [[icemaker]]s, [[refrigerator]]s, [[wine cooler]]s, [[terrarium]] [[heater]]s, heated floors, [[instant hot water dispenser]]s, etc.). Although such devices may need to stay on continuously, more recent models have proven to be more efficient and can result in considerably lower home idle loads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work = NRDC |title =Home Idle Load Action Guide |url =  https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/home-idle-load-action-guide.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work = Unplug Stuff |title =Home Idle Load|url =  http://www.unplugstuff.com/learn.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reducing home idle load==
 
Approaches to reduce home idle loads include:
 
* Disabling electronic devices with [[standby power]] loads either manually (unplugging) or by managing [[power strip]]s (including smart [[power socket]] types)
 
* Using a [[timer]] switch that stops electric consumption from devices when not in use
 
* Using a smart power strip with a master outlet that manages electricity for multiple devices
 
* Replacing older (or malfunctioning) devices with more efficient options&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Bensch |first= I. |last2= Pigg |first2= S. |date= 2010 |title= Electricity Savings Opportunities for Home Electronics and Other Plug-In Devices in Minnesota Homes: A Technical and Behavioral Field Assessment |journal= Energy Center of Wisconsin |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Chetty |first= M. |last2= Tran |first2= D |date= 2008 |title= Getting to green: understanding resource consumption in the home.” Green: Understanding Resource Consumption in the Home |journal= Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring home idle load==
 
Home idle load may be measured differently depending on the [[electric meter]] and local utility used. A smart meter with a local utility that supports “green button” data is the most accurate option to measure home idle load. Another option involves using the user’s utility website to access consumption charts showing hourly electric use.  If green button data is not available, the user may measure home idle load by analysing the home’s [[electric meter]] while all home electronic devices are in innactive mode. This may involve using a timer to track the time for a single revolution of the spinning dial of an [[analog device|analog]] electric meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/home-idle-load-IP.pdf |title= Home Idle Load |website=NRDC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''In-circuit emulation''' ('''ICE''') is the use of a hardware device or '''in-circuit emulator''' used to [[Debugging|debug]] the [[software]] of an [[embedded system]]. It operates by using a processor with the additional ability to support debugging operations, as well as to carry out the main function of the system. Particularly for older systems, with limited processors, this usually involved replacing the processor temporarily with a hardware emulator: a more powerful although more expensive version. It was historically in the form of [[bond-out processor]] which has many internal signals brought out for the purpose of debugging. These signals provide information about the state of the processor.

More recently the term also covers [[Joint Test Action Group]] (JTAG) based hardware debuggers which provide equivalent access using [[on-chip debugging]] hardware with standard production chips.  Using standard chips instead of custom bond-out versions makes the technology ubiquitous and low cost, and eliminates most differences between the development and runtime environments. In this common case, the ''in-circuit emulator'' term is a [[misnomer]], sometimes confusingly so, because emulation is no longer involved.

Embedded systems present special problems for programmers because they usually lack [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboards]], [[computer monitor|monitors]], [[disk drive]]s and other user interfaces that are present on computers. These shortcomings make in-circuit software debugging tools essential for many common development tasks.

==Function==
An in-circuit emulator (ICE) provides a window into the embedded system. The programmer uses the emulator to load programs into the embedded system, run them, [[Stepping (debugging)|step through them]] slowly, and view and change data used by the system's software.

An ''emulator'' gets its name because it emulates (imitates) the [[central processing unit]] (CPU) of the embedded system's computer. Traditionally it had a plug that inserts into the socket where the CPU [[integrated circuit]] chip would normally be placed. Most modern systems use the target system's CPU directly, with special JTAG-based debug access. Emulating the processor, or direct JTAG access to it, lets the ICE do anything that the processor can do, but under the control of a software developer.

ICEs attach a [[computer terminal]] or [[personal computer]] (PC) to the embedded system. The terminal or PC provides an interactive [[user interface]] for the programmer to investigate and control the embedded system. For example, it is routine to have a source code level [[debugger]] with a graphical windowing interface that communicates through a JTAG adapter (emulator) to an embedded target system which has no graphical user interface.

Notably, when their program fails, most embedded systems simply become [[Brick (electronics)|inert lumps of nonfunctioning electronics]]. Embedded systems often lack basic functions to detect signs of [[Software bug|software failure]], such as a [[memory management unit]] (MMU) to catch memory access errors. Without an ICE, the development of embedded systems can be extremely difficult, because there is usually no way to tell what went wrong. With an ICE, the programmer can usually test pieces of code, then isolate the fault to a particular section of code, and then inspect the failing code and rewrite it to solve the problem.

In usage, an ICE provides the programmer with execution [[breakpoint]]s, memory display and monitoring, and input/output control. Beyond this, the ICE can be programmed to look for any range of matching criteria to pause at, in an attempt to identify the origin of a failure.

Most modern [[microcontroller]]s use resources provided on the manufactured version of the microcontroller for device programming, emulating, and debugging features, instead of needing another special emulation-version (that is, bond-out) of the target microcontroller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keil|first=Reinhard|title=Debugging with Cortex-M3 Microcontrollers|url=http://www.embedded.com/design/mcus-processors-and-socs/4007634/PRODUCT-HOW-TO-Debugging-with-Cortex-M3-Microcontrollers|publisher=www.embedded.com|accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though it is a cost-effective method, since the ICE unit only manages the emulation instead of actually emulating the target microcontroller, trade-offs must be made to keep prices low at manufacture time, yet provide enough emulation features for the (relatively few) emulation applications.

==Advantages==
Virtually all embedded systems have a hardware element and a software element, which are separate but tightly interdependent. The ICE allows the software element to be run and tested on the hardware on which it is to run, but still allows programmer conveniences to help isolate faulty code, such as ''source-level debugging'' (which shows a program as it was originally written) and ''single-stepping'' (which lets programmers run programs step-by-step to find errors).

Most ICEs consist of an adaptor unit that sits between the ICE host computer and the system to be tested. A [[pin header]] and cable assembly connects the adaptor to a socket where the actual [[central processing unit]] (CPU) or [[microcontroller]] mounts within the embedded system. Recent ICEs enable programmers to access the on-chip debug circuit that is integrated into the CPU via JTAG or [[background debug mode interface]] (BDM) to debug the software of an embedded system. These systems often use a standard version of the CPU chip, and can simply attach to a debug port on a production system. They are sometimes called in-circuit debuggers or ICDs, to distinguish the fact that they do not replicate the functionality of the CPU, but instead control an already existing, standard CPU. Since the CPU need not be replaced, they can operate on production units where the CPU is soldered in and cannot be replaced. On x86 Pentiums, a special 'probe mode' is used by ICEs to aid in debugging.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rcollins.org/articles/probemd/ProbeMode.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of embedded systems, the ICE is not emulating hardware. Rather, it is providing direct debug access to the actual CPU. The system under test is under full control, allowing the developer to load, debug and test code directly.

Most host systems are ordinary commercial computers unrelated to the CPU used for development. For example, a [[Linux]] PC might be used to develop software for a system using a [[Freescale 68HC11]] chip, a processor that cannot run Linux.

The programmer usually edits and compiles the embedded system's code on the host system, as well. The host system will have special compilers that produce executable code for the embedded system, termed [[cross compiler]]s or cross [[Assembler (computing)|assemblers]].

== On-chip debugging ==
''On-chip debugging'' is an alternative to in-circuit emulation. It uses a different approach to address a similar goal.

On-chip debugging, often loosely termed as ''Joint Test Action Group'' (JTAG), uses the provision of an additional debugging interface to the live hardware, in the production system. It provides the same features as in-circuit debugging, such as inspection of internal state or variables and may have the ability to set checkpoints, breakpoints and watchpoints. The difference is that this is provided by additional silicon within the production processor, rather than swapping the processor for an off-board debugging emulator.  For this reason, some of the functions of the ICE is changed by the specifications of the processor. An additional JTAG interface is added to the controller board, and this is required on every production system, but as this only requires a few signal pins the extra cost is minimal.  JTAG interfaces were originally developed for, and are still useful for, end of production testing.

The '''interconnect bottleneck''' comprises limits on [[integrated circuit]] (IC) performance due to connections between components instead of their internal speed.
In 2006 it was predicted to  be a "looming crisis" by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/04/060417124542.htm |title= Quantum Paint-on Laser Could Rescue Computer Chip Industry |work= Science Daily |date= April 17, 2006 |accessdate= May 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improved performance of computer systems has been achieved, in large part, by downscaling the IC minimum feature size. This allows the basic IC building block, the [[transistor]], to operate at a higher frequency, performing more computations per second. However, downscaling of the minimum feature size also results in tighter packing of the wires on a [[microprocessor]], which increases [[parasitic capacitance]] and signal propagation delay. Consequently, the delay due to the communication between the parts of a chip becomes comparable to the computation delay itself. This phenomenon, known as an “interconnect bottleneck”, is becoming a major problem in high-performance computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ece.rochester.edu/~weiss/SMW%20papers/MH_SPIE2004.pdf Dynamically tunable 1D and 2D photonic bandgap structures for optical interconnect applications]&lt;/ref&gt;

This interconnect bottleneck can be solved by utilizing optical interconnects to replace the long metallic interconnects.&lt;ref name="iptronics"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iptronics.com/36209/Optical%20interconnects.html|title=Parallel Optical Interconnects|last=Bek|first=Jesper|date=2008-06-09|publisher=[[IPtronics]]|accessdate=2010-04-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305124306/http://www.iptronics.com/36209/Optical%20interconnects.html|archivedate=2011-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such hybrid optical/electronic interconnects promises better performance even with larger designs. Optics has widespread use in long-distance communications; still it has not yet been widely used in chip-to-chip or on-chip interconnections because they (in centimeter or micrometer range) are not yet industry-manufacturable owing to costlier technology and lack of fully mature technologies. As optical interconnections move from computer network applications to chip level interconnections, new requirements for high connection density and alignment reliability have become as critical for the effective utilization of these links. There are still many materials, fabrication, and packaging challenges in integrating optic and electronic technologies.

'''Jet Ski Fishing''' is the practice of rigging a [[personal watercraft]] with fishing rods and accessories in order to travel to an area for fishing.

Jet ski fishing is one of the fastest growing categories in the personal watercraft and [[fishing]] industries.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} There are four  types of fishing rigs for jet ski fishing:

*'''JETWINGS Fishing pontoons''':
Pontoons(manufactured from fibre glass) that is attached to any jetski or PWC,adding stability you jetski as it's always in the water.There is ample storage space to organize your jetski.
Jetwings has live well, luna tubes,bait boards,trolling  rod holders,storage rod holders .It has built in buoyancy witch make it impossible  for the jetski to sink

* '''PWC Bracket System''': The safest and easiest method, this consists for a bracket coming out of the ski hook at the back of the Jet Ski typically just under the seat and above the transom. Another bracket is installed on the steering column. This method is clean, as in there is no damage to the machine, it is easy and fast to install and is the most economical of the three systems.
*'''Rear Basket system''': This method has been around for a while{{clarify|date=December 2015}} and allows the user to attach a tray to the back of their PWC on the landing ramp. The basket is held on by bungee clamps, straps and clips. This basket allows the attachment of steel tubes for rods and the basket allows a cooler to be installed onto the back of the machine. The basket and cooler can be an obstacle when re-boarding the jet ski.
*'''Chrome Tube''': This method is the most elaborate of the three methods, and involves drilling holes into the PWC to attach large chrome tubing over the midsection and aft areas of the PWC. It is also the most time consuming and damaging of the three methods. The costs are also to be considered, installing the mid and aft structures can cost several thousands and also obstructs the passenger egress from the water back onto the machine.

This sport is said to have originated in South Africa and has become popular in Australia and New Zealand, and in 2015 the sport has started to get traction in North America. A personal watercraft can support two fishermen on the water. There are several methods of fishing from a PWC: trolling, casting and drift jigging, all of which are productive and are used regularly.  When trolling there are two positions where the rods can be installed, off the aft and off the steering column.

There are several obstacles to overcome when taking a stock [[Personal water craft|PWC]] and converting it to a fishing platform. Firstly the fisherman needs to have a place to store and mount fishing gear such as rods and reels, nets and gaffs. All three methods above address that problem. Storage space is required, and the most popular method is to use saddle bags or a catch bag and a console bag, giving extra storage area for touring and fishing. In addition there are three compartments on a Jet Ski, the front compartment, the console hatch and there is generally a bucket under the rear seat. The final hurdle is where to store the catch, either in a catch bag (the easiest and most economical method) or a more costly cooler and basket.

Personal watercrafts are regularly used for touring, they are used by groups of people to travel from port to port. Many of these machines are being used for overnight camping in combination with fishing.

The majority of jet ski fishing is done off three or four seat PWCs, the larger area allowing for the movement required to handle a fish whether there are one or two fishermen on board.

'''Keck Graduate Institute''' ('''KGI''') is a [[Private university|private]] [[graduate school]] in [[Claremont, California|Claremont]], [[California]]. Founded by [[Henry E. Riggs|Henry Riggs]] in 1997, it is the seventh and newest member of the [[Claremont Consortium]].

==History==
[[Henry E. Riggs|Henry Riggs]], then president of [[Harvey Mudd College]], established the institute in 1997 to address what he perceived as a lack of scientists trained to convert new scientific discoveries into practical uses. He also became the institute's first president, serving until 2003.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.claremont-courier.com/pages/Topstory050907.3.html |title=Keck Graduate Institute To Celebrate 10th Year At Weekend Commencement |last=Rigsby |first=Landus |date=May 9, 2007 |work=Claremont Courier |access-date=April 13, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927141934/http://www.claremont-courier.com/pages/Topstory050907.3.html |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to establish Keck Graduate Institute as a seventh [[Claremont Colleges|Claremont College]] met with some opposition, particularly from faculty of the other Claremont Colleges who objected to its lack of [[Academic tenure|tenure]], and environmentalists who opposed its plans to build a campus next to the [[Robert J. Bernard Field Station|Bernard Field Station]], an area of undeveloped [[Coastal sage scrub|scrubland]]. The environmental issue was largely settled when KGI decided to establish its campus at a different location, and other opposition gradually faded.{{Verify source|date=November 2015}}&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Keck foes persist in fight | work = Los Angeles Times (Claremont supplement) | date = November 23, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute received a $50 million endowment from the [[W. M. Keck Foundation]], after which it was named. It awarded its first Master of [[Biotechnology|Bioscience]] degree in 2002.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2003, [[Sheldon Schuster]] became the second president in the institute's history. He took over from Riggs, who became chairman of the school's board of trustees. Schuster is a biochemist who previously served as director of the [[University of Florida]]'s biotechnology research program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/12/local/me-keck12|title=Scientist Named Keck Graduate Institute President|last=Hong|first=Peter Y.|date=2003-06-12|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Latency''' is a time interval between the stimulation and response, or, from a more general point of view, a time delay between the cause and the effect of some physical change in the system being observed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/L/latency.html "What is Latency?" / "Latency"] Retrieved 2015-02-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Latency is physically a consequence of the limited velocity with which any physical interaction can propagate. The magnitude of this velocity is always less than or equal to the [[speed of light]]. Therefore, every physical system will experience some sort of latency, regardless of the nature of stimulation that it has been exposed to.

The precise definition of latency depends on the system being observed and the nature of stimulation.  In communications, the lower limit of latency is determined by the medium being used for communications.  In reliable two-way communication systems, latency limits the maximum rate that information can be transmitted, as there is often a limit on the amount of information that is "in-flight" at any one moment.  In the field of human–machine interaction, perceptible latency has a strong effect on user satisfaction and usability.

==Communication latency==

[[Online game]]s are sensitive to latency since fast response times to new events occurring during a game session are rewarded while slow response times may carry penalties. [[Lag]] is the term used to describe latency in gaming. Due to a delay in transmission of game events, a player with a high latency internet connection may show slow responses in spite of appropriate [[reaction time]].  This gives players with low latency connections a technical advantage.

Minimizing latency is of interest in the [[Low latency (capital markets)|capital markets]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=TABB|title=High Frequency Trading Technology: a TABB Anthology|year=2009|url=http://www.tabbgroup.com/PublicationDetail.aspx?PublicationID=498}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly where [[algorithmic trading]] is used to process market updates and turn around orders within milliseconds. Low-latency trading occurs on the networks used by financial institutions to connect to stock exchanges and electronic communication networks (ECNs) to execute financial transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mackenzie|first=Michael|title=The dash to flash|url=http://www.themistrading.com/article_files/0000/0493/8-6-09Financial_Times.pdf|accessdate=18 July 2011|newspaper=Financial Times|year=2009|author2=Grant, Jeremy|quote=extracting tiny slices of profit from trading small numbers of shares  in companies, often between different trading platforms, with success relying on minimal variations in speed - or  "latency", in the trading vernacular.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Joel Hasbrouck and Gideon Saar (2011) measure latency based on three components: the time it takes for information to reach the trader, execution of the trader’s algorithms to analyze the information and decide a course of action, and the generated action to reach the exchange and get implemented. Hasbrouck and Saar contrast this with the way in which latencies are measured by many trading venues who use much more narrow definitions, such as, the processing delay measured from the entry of the order (at the vendor’s computer) to the transmission of an acknowledgement (from the vendor’s computer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hasbrouck |first=Joel |title=Low-Latency Trading |author2=Saar, Gideon |url=http://www2.binghamton.edu/som/files/GideonSaar.pdf |accessdate=18 July 2011 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Electronic trading now makes up 60% to 70% of the daily volume on the [[NYSE]] and algorithmic trading close to 35%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heires|first=Katherine|title=Code Green: Goldman Sachs &amp; UBS Cases Heighten Need to Keep Valuable Digital Assets From Walking Out The Door.

==={{Anchor|PACKET-SWITCHED}}Packet-switched networks===
{{See also|Bandwidth-delay product|Network delay}}

'''Network latency''' in a [[packet-switched]] network is measured as either [[One-way delay|one-way]] (the time from the source sending a packet to the destination receiving it), or [[round-trip delay time]] (the one-way latency from source to destination plus the one-way latency from the destination back to the source). Round-trip latency is more often quoted, because it can be measured from a single point. Note that round trip latency excludes the amount of time that a destination system spends processing the packet.{{cn|reason=Not supported by [[Round-trip delay time]]. The reality is, some measures include this and some don't|date=June 2018}} Many software platforms provide a service called [[Ping (networking utility)|ping]] that can be used to measure round-trip latency. Ping uses the [[Internet Control Message Protocol]] (ICMP) ''echo request'' which causes the recipient to send the received packet as an immediate response, thus it provides a rough way of measuring round-trip delay time. Ping cannot perform accurate measurements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c0t0d0s0.org/archives/7479-Dont-misuse-ping!.html|title=Don't misuse ping!|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; principally because ICMP is intended only for diagnostic or control purposes, and differs from real communication protocols such as [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]. Furthermore, [[Router (computing)|routers]] and [[internet service provider]]s might apply different [[traffic shaping]] policies to different protocols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However, in a non-trivial network, a typical packet will be forwarded over multiple links and gateways, each of which will not begin to forward the packet until it has been completely received.  In such a network, the minimal latency is the sum of the transmission delay of each link, plus the forwarding latency of each gateway. In practice, minimal latency also includes queuing and processing delays. [[Queuing delay]] occurs when a gateway receives multiple packets from different sources heading towards the same destination. Since typically only one packet can be transmitted at a time, some of the packets must queue for transmission, incurring additional delay. [[Processing delay]]s  are incurred while a gateway determines what to do with a newly received packet. [[Bufferbloat]] can also cause increased latency that is an order of magnitude or more. The combination of propagation, serialization, queuing, and processing delays often produces a complex and variable network latency profile.

Latency limits total throughput in reliable two-way communication systems as described by the [[bandwidth-delay product]].

===Fiber optics===
Latency in fiber optics is largely a function of the [[speed of light]], which is 299,792,458 meters/second in vacuum.  This would equate to a latency of 3.33&amp;nbsp;[[Microsecond|µs]] for every kilometer of path length.  The [[index of refraction]] of most fibre optic cables is about 1.5, meaning that light travels about 1.5 times as fast in a vacuum as it does in the cable.  This works out to about 5.0&amp;nbsp;µs of latency for every kilometer.  In shorter metro networks, higher latency can be experienced due to extra distance in building risers and cross-connects. To calculate latency of a connection, one has to know the distance traveled by the fibre, which is rarely a straight line, since it has to traverse geographic contours and obstacles, such as roads and railway tracks, as well as other rights-of-way. 

Due to imperfections in the fibre, light degrades as it is transmitted through it. For distances of greater than 100 kilometers, [[Optical amplifier|amplifiers]] or [[Regenerator (telecommunication)|regenerators]] are deployed. Latency introduced by these components needs to be taken into account.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

===Satellite transmission===
This is illustrated when a [[news presenter]] in a studio talks with a reporter in a distant place via a geostationary [[communication satellite]]. The signal travels from the newsreader up to and down from the satellite to the reporter and then the reply from the reporter does the same, resulting in four satellite hops incurring a [[Geostationary_orbit#Communications|latency]] on the order of a half second, not including the typically smaller latencies inside the communications equipment.

[[Low Earth orbit]] is sometimes used to cut this delay, at the expense of more complicated satellite tracking on the ground and requiring more satellites in the [[satellite constellation]] to ensure continuous coverage.

==Audio latency==
{{main|Latency (audio)}}

Audio latency is the delay between when an audio signal enters and when it emerges from a system. Potential contributors to latency in an audio system include [[analog-to-digital conversion]], [[Buffer (telecommunication)|buffering]], [[digital signal processing]], [[transmission time]], [[digital-to-analog conversion]] and the [[speed of sound]] in air.

==Operational latency==
Any individual [[workflow]] within a system of workflows can be subject to some type of operational latency.  It may even be the case that an individual system may have more than one type of latency, depending on the type of participant or goal-seeking behavior.  This is best illustrated by the following two examples involving [[air travel]].

===Consumer view===
From the point of view of a passenger, latency can be described as follows.  Suppose John Doe flies from [[London]] to [[New York City|New York]].  The latency of his trip is the time it takes him to go from his house in England to the hotel he is staying at in New York.  This is independent of the throughput of the London-New York air link &amp;ndash; whether there were 100 passengers a day making the trip or 10000, the latency of the trip would remain the same.

===Producer view===
From the point of view of flight operations personnel, latency can be entirely different.  Consider the staff at the London and New York airports.  Only a limited number of planes are able to make the transatlantic journey, so when one lands they must prepare it for the return trip as quickly as possible.  It might take, for example:
*35 minutes to clean a plane
*15 minutes to refuel a plane
*10 minutes to load the passengers
*30 minutes to load the cargo

Assuming the above are done one after another, minimum plane [[turnaround time]] is:
:35 + 15 + 10 + 30 = '''90'''

However, cleaning, refueling and loading the cargo can be done at the same time. Passengers can be loaded after cleaning is complete. The reduced latency, then, is:
:35 + 10 = 45
:15
:30
:Minimum latency = '''45'''

The people involved in the turnaround are interested only in the time it takes for their individual tasks.  When all of the tasks are done at the same time, however, it is possible to reduce the latency to the length of the longest task. If some steps have prerequisites, it becomes more difficult to perform all steps in parallel. In the example above, the requirement to clean the plane before loading passengers results in a minimum latency longer than any single task.

==Mechanical latency==
Any mechanical process encounters limitations modeled by [[Newtonian physics]].  The behavior of [[disk drive]]s provides an example of mechanical latency.  Here, it is the time needed for the data encoded on a platter to rotate from its current position to a position adjacent to the read-write head as well as the seek time required for the actuator arm for the read-write head to be positioned above the appropriate track.  This is also known as [[rotational latency]] and [[seek time]] since the basic term '''latency''' is also applied to the time required by a computer's [[electronics]] and [[software]] to perform [[polling (computer science)|polling]], [[interrupt]]s, and [[direct memory access]].

==Computer hardware and operating system latency==
{{Further|Access time}}

Computers run sets of instructions called a [[Process (computing)|process]].  In [[operating system]]s, the execution of the process can be postponed if other processes are also executing.  In addition, the operating system can schedule when to perform the action that the process is commanding.  For example, suppose a process commands that a computer card's voltage output be set high-low-high-low and so on at a rate of 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz.  The operating system may choose to adjust the scheduling of each transition (high-low or low-high) based on an internal clock.  The latency is the delay between the process instruction commanding the transition and the hardware actually transitioning the voltage from high to low or low to high.

On [[List of Microsoft operating systems|Microsoft Windows]], it appears{{or|date=March 2011}} that the timing of commands to hardware is not exact.  Empirical data suggest that Windows (using the Windows sleep timer which accepts millisecond sleep times) will schedule on a 1024&amp;nbsp;Hz clock and will delay 24 of 1024 transitions per second to make an average of 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz for the update rate.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}  This can have serious ramifications for discrete-time algorithms that rely on fairly consistent timing between updates such as those found in control theory. The sleep function or similar windows API were at no point designed for accurate timing purposes. Certain multimedia-oriented API routines like &lt;code&gt;timeGetTime()&lt;/code&gt; and its siblings provide better timing consistency.  However, consumer- and server-grade Windows ({{as of | 2011 | lc = on}} those based on [[Ntoskrnl.exe|NT kernel]]) were not to be [[real-time operating system]]s. Drastically more accurate timings could be achieved by using dedicated hardware extensions and control-loop cards.

[[Linux]] may have the same problems with scheduling of hardware I/O.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The problem in Linux is mitigated by support for posix real-time extensions, and the possibility of using a kernel with the [[PREEMPT_RT|PREEMPT_RT patch]] applied.

On embedded systems, the real-time execution of instructions is often supported by the low-level embedded operating system.

==In simulators and simulation==
In simulation applications, 'latency' refers to the time delay, normally measured in [[millisecond]]s (1/1,000 sec), between initial input and an output clearly discernible to the simulator trainee or simulator subject.  Latency is sometimes also called transport delay.

* Some authorities distinguish between latency and transport delay by using the term 'latency' in the sense of the extra time delay of a system over and above the reaction time of the vehicle being simulated, but this requires a detailed knowledge of the [[vehicle dynamics]] and can be controversial.
* Importance of Motion and Visual Latencies.  In simulators with both visual and motion systems, it is particularly important that the latency of the motion system not be greater than of the visual system, or symptoms of [[simulator sickness]] may result.  This is because in the real world, motion cues are those of acceleration and are quickly transmitted to the brain, typically in less than 50 milliseconds; this is followed some milliseconds later by a perception of change in the visual scene.  The visual scene change is essentially one of change of perspective and/or displacement of objects such as the horizon, which takes some time to build up to discernible amounts after the initial acceleration which caused the displacement.  A simulator should therefore reflect the real-world situation by ensuring that the motion latency is equal to or less than that of the visual system and not the other way round.

'''MSC Malaysia''', formerly the Multimedia Super Corridor and known as the '''MSC''' in Malaysia, is a [[Special Economic Zone]] and [[high-technology business district]] in central-southern [[Selangor]], [[Malaysia]].

==Geographical definition==
The MSC's northern end is at the [[Petronas Towers]] in downtown [[Kuala Lumpur]], extending through [[Cyberjaya]], [[Putrajaya]], the [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]] and most of [[Sepang]] constituency, as well as parts of [[Bandar Tun Razak (federal constituency)|Bandar Tun Razak]], [[Puchong]] and [[Serdang, Selangor|Serdang]] constituencies, before terminating at [[Nilai]], [[Negeri Sembilan]].

==History==
The Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) program was officially inaugurated by the fourth [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Malaysian Prime Minister]] [[Mahathir Mohamad]] on 12 February 1996. The establishment of the MSC program was crucial to accelerate the objectives of Vision 2020 and to transform Malaysia into a modern state by 2020, with the adoption of a knowledge-based society framework.&lt;ref&gt;Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim, &amp; Nor Fadzlina Nawi. (2007). ''Principles of Public Administration: An Introduction.'' Kuala Lumpur: Karisma Publications. {{ISBN|978-983-195-253-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim. (2007). ''Fundamental of Development Administration.'' Selangor: Scholar Press. {{ISBN|978-967-5-04508-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The MSC flagship applications were launched to boost the MSC Malaysia initiatives and to create a hub for innovative producers and users of multimedia technology. Consortia comprising local and foreign companies (MNCs) collaborated with government agencies, departments and ministries to enhance the socio-economic development of Malaysia in the information age. The vision and mission of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) as expressed by Dr Mahathir Mohammad, the Prime Minister of Malaysia at the time (1981–2003), is essentially this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“MSC is paramount to leapfrog (Malaysia) into the 21st century and to achieve Malaysia’s Vision 2020, the MSC was created to endeavour the best environment to harness the full potential of the multimedia without any artificial limits. MSC is a global test bed (hub), where the limits of the possible can be explored, and new ways of living, working, and playing in the new area of the Information Age.”&lt;ref&gt;Ibrahim Ariff &amp; Goh Chen Chuan, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim, &amp; Nor Fadzlina Nawi. (2007). ''Principles of Public Administration: An Introduction.'' Kuala Lumpur: Karisma Publications. {{ISBN|978-983-195-253-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim. (2007). ''Fundamental of Development Administration.'' Selangor: Scholar Press. {{ISBN|978-967-5-04508-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Multimedia Super Corridor is a government-designated zone in designed to [[Leapfrogging|leapfrog]] [[Malaysia]] into the [[Information Age|information and knowledge age]]. It aims to attract companies with temporary tax breaks and facilities such as high-speed Internet access and proximity to the [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]].

MSC Malaysia covers an area of approximately {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} &amp;times; {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} (that is, {{convert|750|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}) stretching from the [[Petronas Towers|Petronas Twin Towers]] to the [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]], and including the towns of [[Putrajaya]] and [[Cyberjaya]].

It was announced by former Prime Minister [[Mahathir bin Mohamad|Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir]] at the Multimedia Asia Conference on 1 August 1996. Mahathir's visit to the [[United States of America]] in January 1997 to promote the MSC to companies succeeded in attracting the interest of many large [[information technology]] companies. During the visit, an international advisory panel comprising 30 information technology experts were formed to exchange ideas toward the success of the MSC.

The [[Multimedia Development Corporation]] (MDeC, formerly MDC) was created to oversee development of the MSC. It was later renamed to Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Effects on press freedom==
Though Malaysian law had provided for strict government controls on print media since 1984, a founding principle of MSC Malaysia was that government censorship of the Internet would not be permitted. Seeing a loophole, journalist [[Steven Gan]] and colleague Premesh Chandran started an online news resource that would be free of the controls that they felt stifled print media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/media/ipf/gan.html |title=Steven Gan, editor Malaysiakini |author= |year=2000 |work= |publisher=''[[PBS NewsHour]]'' |accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1999, the pair founded Malaysiakini, an online, independent news source that would become one of Malaysia's most popular websites.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1028657.stm |title=Malaysia's first online paper |author= |date=20 November 2000 |work= |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was awarded a Free Media Pioneer award from the [[International Press Institute]] in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publicintegrity.org/investigations/icij/journalists/profile/791/ |title=ICIJ Journalists: Steven Gan |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] |accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gan was awarded one of the 2000 [[CPJ International Press Freedom Awards]] for his work with the site.&lt;ref name=CPJ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpj.org/awards/2000/awards00.php |title=IPF Awards 2000 - Announcement |author= |year=2000 |work= |publisher=[[Committee to Protect Journalists]] |accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''magnetic chip detector''' is an [[electronic instrumentation|electronic instrument]] that attracts [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] particles (mostly iron chips). It is mainly used in [[aircraft engine]] oil chip detection systems. Chip detectors can provide an early warning of an impending [[engine failure]] and thus greatly reduce the cost of an [[engine overhaul]].

==Operation==
Chip Detectors consist of small plugs which can be installed in an engine [[oil filter]],oil sump or aircraft drivetrain gear boxes. Over a period of time, engine [[wear and tear]] causes small metal chips to break loose from engine parts and circulate in the engine oil.

The detector houses magnets incorporated into an electric circuit. Magnetic lines of force attract ferrous particles. Collection of these particles continues until the insulated air gap between the magnets (two magnet configuration) or between the magnet and housing (one magnet configuration) is bridged, effectively closing the circuit. The result is an electronic signal for remote indication. Thus, warning light on the [[Flight instruments|instrument panel]] illuminates, indicating the presence of metal chips.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allenaircraft.com/products/chip_detectors.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Chip detectors may be positioned in the application with a self-closing valve/adapter through either a bayonet or threaded interface. As the chip detector is disengaged from the valve, the valve closes minimizing any fluid loss from the system.

The chip detectors used on aircraft are inspected in every 'A check' and higher. They may also be specified intervals such as every 30–40 hours for an engine unit and 100 hours for an [[Auxiliary Power Unit|APU]] unit.

'''MegaTransect''' was the name for a project conducted in Africa in 1999 by [[J. Michael Fay]] to spend 455 days on the expedition hike of 2000 miles across the [[Congo Basin]] of [[Africa]] to survey the ecological and environmental status of the region.

A transect is a term in ecology that denotes a survey of the natural vegetation through a particular area. The concept of a megatransect was conceived as a vegetation transect on a large scale that could be used to take an ecological census of the natural vegetation and ecosystems.

Shortly after the hike, Fay successfully lobbied alongside the President of [[Gabon]] to create 13 new [[national park]]s.  In 2002, US Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] and other Bush Administration members gave 53 million dollars to help preserve the Congo Basin.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Mike Fay later went on to carry out the [[MegaFlyover]] in 2004.

==[[Madagascar]] megatransect==

Also in 2004, an international team conducted a "Megatransect" of the island of [[Madagascar]].  Dubbed "Hike Madagascar", the journey covered the entire island.  Members met with rural farmers to help them improve their agricultural techniques and discuss their impact on the environment.

==History of USA megatransects==
One of the first megatransects in the [[United States]], was conducted by Dr. Robert R. Humphrey when he rephotographed 535 miles of the natural vegetation along the United States and Mexico border at the 1890s permanent border monument locations, spaced about five miles apart, and published the work in "90 Years and 535 miles: Vegetation Changes along the Mexican Border" (1987, pub. Univ. of NM Press, 448 pages).

Craig C. Dremann, in 1997, conducted a megatransect surveying over 3,000 miles and at each mile-marker, noting the roadside vegetation, the perennial native [[grass]], and [[Invasive species|exotic grass]] status, through the [[Great Basin]] ecosystem.  The route was from [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], Nevada eastward to [[Hot Springs, South Dakota|Hot Springs]], South Dakota, and from South Dakota, through Wyoming, Idaho, Nevada and returning westward to [[Bishop, California|Bishop]], California, and then north to Reno.

In 2005, Dremann conducted another vegetation megatransect, this time of the California portion of the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave desert]], mapping over 1,000 miles on a mile-by-mile basis, for a fast-spreading exotic [[Mustard plant|mustard]] species, [[Brassica]] [[Brassica tournefortii|tournefortii]], noting the locations and density of the [[Mojave desert Mustard infestation in California]].

Dremann suggests that a method of remotely conducting a large-scale vegetation megatransect, is with photographs. Photographs that have been taken at ground-level at intervals from known locations, can be stitched together, to create large-scale to Continent-scale megatransect pictures of the ecosystems.

In 2006, Dr. Michael C. McGrann, and his wife Amy M. McGrann, hiked the length of the California section of Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail (PCT) in the western United States from Mexico to the Oregon border (2,736&amp;nbsp;km) while systematically collecting avian-habitat data on 3,578 survey plots separated by 10-minute hiking intervals. This work was completed in a single field season from 2 April to 8 September. From this data, Dr. McGrann and his collaborators described the elevation and latitudinal distributions of birds along the PCT&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGrann|first1=Michael|last2=Thorne|first2=James|title=Elevational ranges of birds along California's Pacific Crest Trail|journal=Western Birds|date=2014|volume=45|pages=18–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and statistically modeled avian species richness relationships with elevation, climate, and environmental factors, including temperature, precipitation, and primary productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGrann|first1=Michael|last2=Tingley|first2=Morgan|last3=Elliott-Fisk|first3=Deborah|last4=Thorne|first4=James|last5=McGrann|first5=Amy|title=Heterogeneity in avian richness-environment relationships along the Pacific Crest Trail|journal=Avian Conservation and Ecology|date=2014|volume=9|issue=2|page=8|url=http://www.ace-eco.org/vol9/iss2/art8/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results from this work show that birds can exhibit heterogeneous relationships to temperature, precipitation, and productivity, depending on the distinct environmental and climate conditions of each of the ecological regions traversed by the PCT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGrann|first1=Michael|last2=Thorne|first2=James|title=Elevational ranges of birds along California's Pacific Crest Trail|journal=Western Birds|date=2014|volume=45|pages=18–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PCT Mega-transect is an ongoing research project for Dr. McGrann in collaboration with several other researchers. He has continued his biodiversity surveys along sections of the PCT in 2007, 2010, and 2015, and he is working to expand taxa surveyed along the PCT and to involve his undergraduate students at William Jessup University in the [http://www.jessup.edu/academics/environmental-science/#tab_research PCT Mega-Transect].

In 2007-2008 J. Michael Fay and Lindsey Holm completed a 1300 mile [http://www.redwoodtransect.org Redwood Transect] of 333 days.  This was a transect that spanned from the southernmost to the northernmost redwood tree in California and Oregon.  They walked extensively on private timberland and public land recording data on historical exploitation, current forest stand characteristics, silviculture and many other aspects of the redwood ecosystem.  The results will be published in National Geographic in 2009.

The [[Appalachian Trail Conservancy]] and the [[National Park Service]] are adapting the idea of a megatransect for the [[Appalachian Trail]] (A.T.) Like other megatransects, the [http://www.appalachiantrail.org/megatransect A.T. MEGA-Transect] aims to monitor the natural resources along the trail, understand the status and trends of these resources, and inform and engage the public and stakeholders. The 2,178 mile long trail crosses 14 states, from Georgia to Maine, and is visited by one to two million people, and completed by about 400 people each year. Volunteer citizen scientists are beginning to implement monitoring protocols to track natural resources such as wildlife presence, water quality, forest health, invasive plants, endangered species, mountain birds, phenology, and air quality. Professional scientists are also using the transect for independent research. Because the A.T. is oriented along the predicted migratory direction of species responding to climate change, it is a particularly important megatransect to establish and maintain.

==MegaTransect future==
For a rapidly changing planet, megatransects establish baseline [[data]] from which to draw future trends, and they can focus attention on particular ecosystems which are disappearing faster than others.

Establishing standard megatransects on specific [[region]]s or through various ecosystems of each continent, and periodic re&amp;ndash;measurement of the ecological conditions along routes, every five to ten years, would provide very valuable measured data on environmental trends.

'''Mower blades''' are the cutting components of [[lawn mower]]s. They are usually made of sturdy metals as they must be able to withstand high-speed contact with a variety of objects in addition to grass. The materials used (as well as size, thickness, and design of the blades) vary by manufacturer.

==History==
The first known lawn mower sported a cylinder cutting gear made of [[iron]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} It was used to mow sporting grounds and wide-ranging gardens. As manufacturers changed the design and structure of mowers, the cutting mechanism also developed and evolved into several varieties, including cylinder/reel blades, deck blades, [[mulching]] blades, and lifting blades.

== Types of mower blades ==

===Reel or cylinder blades===
Used in [[Reel mower#Cylinder mowers|reel or cylinder mowers]], cylinder blades are composed of three to seven [[helix|helical]] blades welded in a horizontally rotating cylindrical reel, creating a scissor-like cutting action. Unlike other types of mower blades, reel/cylinder blades cannot be replaced; therefore, a broken blade requires replacement of the entire mower. For dull or rusty blades, cleaning and sharpening kits are available.

===Deck blades===
Also known as the standard or straight mower blade, this is the most commonly used blade on [[Reel mower#Rotary mowers 2|rotary mower]]s.

===Mulching blades===
A mulching blade, also known as an all-purpose blade, features a curved surface which allows it to work in three ways: lifting, mowing, and mulching. First, the blade pulls the grass up and cuts it. Then, clippings are sucked inside the deck and are chopped into tinier pieces. Finally, the blade’s innermost curve produces air pressure to blow the small clippings out, where they are used to feed the soil.

===Lifting blades===
The lifting blade features a slightly curved surface which creates a vertical upward [[airflow]] that lifts the grass up and is assumed to provide a cleaner result than the other types of blades.

====Low-lift blade====
Low [[suction power]]; recommended for mowing terrain with sandy soil.

====Medium-lift blade====
Medium suction power; uses less horsepower than high-lift blades.

====High-lift blade====
Provides the greatest suction power among the three lifting blades, but also requires the most [[horsepower]]. This is the best blade for cutting tall, compact grass.

The '''Order of Railroad Telegraphers (ORT)''' was a [[Labor unions in the United States|United States labor union]] established in the late nineteenth century to promote the interests of [[telegraph operator]]s working for the railroads.

==Organizational history==
===Background and early years===

While early [[telegraph]] lines often ran alongside railroad tracks in the United States, it was not until 1851 that the telegraph was first used for [[Train order operation|train routing]] by [[Charles Minot (railroad executive)|Charles Minot]], Superintendent of the [[Erie Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Trains Across the Continent: North American Railroad History |last=Daniels |first=Rudolph |year=2000 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0-253-21411-4 |page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the practice gained wider acceptance in the 1860s and 1870s, telegraphers would be stationed in individual depots along the railroad line in order to receive train orders from a centrally located [[Train dispatcher|dispatcher]] and report back on train movements; telegraphed train orders would be written out on paper and "handed up" to the crews of passing trains. 

This practice greatly increased the efficiency of single-track railroads by enabling two trains traveling in opposite directions to use the track at the same time. The dispatcher would designate one of the trains as the "superior" train and give it right of way over the "inferior" train, which would be required to pull into a siding until the superior train had passed. Local depot telegraph operators would keep track of train arrival times at each station (referred to as "OSing" the train) and pass the information on to other operators and the dispatcher. The local depot operator would also set the [[track switch]]es to enable the inferior train to pull into the siding upon the approach of the superior train. 

The ability of the local depot operators to keep track of the actual time of train movements was particularly important in the era before the establishment of [[time zones]], when local "sun time" might be different at each station; a miscalculation of the "meet time" of two trains running on a single track could result in disaster. Thus railroad telegraphers played a role in the operation of the railroads that was not unlike the role of [[air traffic controller]]s in the modern airline industry; they enabled the trains to run safely and on time.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Robert L., ''Wiring A Continent: The History of the Telegraph Industry in the United States, 1832-1866'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1947), 204-209.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s, U.S. telegraphers began to form labor organizations, including the National Telegraphic Union and the Telegraphers' Protective League, in order to promote professionalism, negotiate for higher wages, and demand better working conditions.  However, following an unsuccessful strike by the Brotherhood of Telegraphers, an affiliate of the [[Knights of Labor]], in 1883, the railroad operators began to see themselves as occupationally distinct from the commercial telegraph operators, who worked in telegraph offices and primarily handled commodities reports, news reports, and personal messages.&lt;ref name="Jepsen"&gt;

[[File:Ambrose D. Thurston, Order of Railroad Telegraphers 1913.jpg|thumb|right|Ambrose D. Thurston, Founder, Order of Railroad Telegraphers. Source: ''Railroad Telegrapher'', May 1913, 706.]]
A meeting of telegraphers representing the major U.S. railroads met in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], on June 9, 1886. Organized by Ambrose D. Thurston (1852–1913), publisher of the trade journal ''Railroad Telegrapher'', in [[Vinton, Iowa]], the group formed the Order of Railway Telegraphers of North America, with membership limited to telegraphers who were or who had been employed in railroad service.  The Order of Railway Telegraphers was initially intended to be more of a fraternal organization than a trade union; it was ideologically closer to the conservative railroad unions than the more militant commercial telegraphers. Initially, its constitution forbade members to strike except in extreme conditions. By March 1887, the union had attracted 2250 members, the number of members grew to 9000 by March 1889.&lt;ref name="McIsaac"&gt;{{cite book |last=McIsaac |first=Archibald M. |authorlink= |title=The Order of Railroad Telegraphers: A Study in Trade Unionism and Collective Bargaining |url=https://archive.org/details/33McisaacOrderofrailroadtelegraphers |accessdate= |year=1933 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}

===Increased militancy in the 1890s===

In the early 1890s, members began to demand that the union take a more assertive role in negotiating wages and working conditions with the railroads. In 1891, the constitution was changed to explicitly make the ORT a "protective" organization, with the right to call strikes if negotiations with the railroads were unsuccessful; at the same time, the name was changed from "Order of ''Railway'' Telegraphers" to "Order of ''Railroad'' Telegraphers."  

One unintended consequence of this was a relatively disorganized period in which operators would stage "wildcat" strikes without consulting ORT leadership, who would then be forced into the position of sanctioning strikes that were already in progress. During the relatively prosperous years of 1890-92, the railroads were inclined to recognize the union and negotiate agreements with the ORT to guarantee wages and working hours.  As a result, agreements were signed during this period with the [[Atlantic &amp; Pacific Railroad]], the [[Denver &amp; Rio Grande]], the [[Union Pacific]], the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]], the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]], and the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad]]. 

A.D. Thurston, who had served as Grand Chief of the ORT since its founding, was replaced by D.G. Ramsay in 1892, who promised to take a more aggressive stance in dealing with the railroads.

===The Panic of 1893===

The [[Panic of 1893]] had a severe impact on the railroad industry; major lines that had overexpanded during the prosperous years, including the [[Reading Railroad]], the Union Pacific, the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe]], and the [[Northern Pacific]] all went into [[receivership]]. The economic hard times led to more confrontations between the ORT and the railroads. A strike was declared against the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] on November 18, 1893 after the railroad refused to bargain with a joint commission composed of the ORT and the "Big Four" railroad unions, the [[Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers]], the [[Order of Railway Conductors]], the [[Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen]], and the [[Brotherhood of Railroad Brakemen]]. 

The state Boards of Mediation and Arbitration of [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]] intervened and settled the dispute through [[mediation]], a tactic that would be increasingly used by the ORT in later years. The strike was ended on December 6, 1893, and was considered to be a significant victory for the ORT when the railroad agreed to reemploy all those who had gone out on strike.&lt;ref&gt;"The Lehigh Valley Strike," ''Railroad Telegrapher'', vol. 9, no. 25, December 15, 1893, 518.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Panic of 1893 also had a negative effect on ORT membership, dropping from 18,000 in 1893 to only 5000 in 1895.  When the ORT leadership refused to sanction a sympathy strike with the workers involved in the [[Pullman Strike]] of 1894, many members left the ORT to join the [[American Railway Union]], formed by [[Eugene V. Debs]] in June 1893. Walker V. Powell was elected Grand Chief in 1894.&lt;ref name="McIsaac" /&gt;{{rp|8-13}}

===Stability and growth, 1895-1900===

The ORT organized its membership into a set of system divisions in the late 1890s, which improved communications and coordination of activities.  A Mutual Benefit Department was added in 1898 to provide assistance for members who were ill or unemployed.  The increased use of block signaling led to the admission of switch levermen as members in 1897. The ORT took on an international focus in 1896 through its support of a strike against the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], called on September 28, 1896 to protest the CPR's dismissal of union employees and the railroad's refusal to negotiate with the union on wages and work rules. 

The strike ended after nine days, with the railroad recognizing the right of the ORT to represent the railroad telegraphers in [[collective bargaining]]. This victory gave the ORT a foothold in Canada, and recognition as an international union. At about the same time, the ORT began to organize railroad telegraphers in Mexico. One result of this international focus was the appearance of district reports in the ''Railroad Telegrapher'' in French for the French Canadian operators, and Spanish for the Mexican operators.&lt;ref&gt;"An Object Lesson in Canada," ''Railroad Telegrapher'', vol. 13, nr. 5, October 1896, 339-347.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"From Mexico," ''Railroad Telegrapher'', vol. 18, no. 12, December 1901, 1151-1153&lt;/ref&gt;  

Headquarters of the ORT were relocated from Vinton, Iowa, to [[Peoria, Illinois]], in September 1895. In 1899, the ORT relocated again to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and became a member of the [[American Federation of Labor]]. By 1901, the ORT comprised 30 system divisions with 10,000 members, double the number of members in 1895. H. B. Perham replaced W. V. Powell as Grand Chief in 1901.&lt;ref name="McIsaac" /&gt;{{rp|19}}

===Women Operators and the ORT===
[[File:pickard rr teleg 1897.jpg|thumb|right|Hattie Todd Pickard, ORT Assistant Chief of Overland Division No. 196 Source: ''Railroad Telegrapher'', May 1897, 402.]]

The ORT accepted women telegraphers as members from the beginning. The ''Railroad Telegrapher'' devoted a column to the issues and concerns of women operators, who played an active role in recruiting new members and participating in the activities of local districts.  Hattie Todd Pickard joined the ORT when she began operating for the St. Louis, Iron Mountain &amp; Southern Railway in 1890; after she and her husband moved to [[Rawlins, Wyoming]], in 1892, she began working for the Union Pacific and was elected  Assistant Chief of Overland Division No. 196 of the ORT.  Katherine B. Davidson, a telegrapher in [[Cambridge, Ohio]], was elected District Representative of the Baltimore and Ohio Railway System, ORT District 33, in 1905. [[Ola Delight Smith]] joined the ORT in [[Gainesville, Georgia]], in 1906, and began a long career as a labor organizer and journalist.&lt;ref&gt;''Railroad Telegrapher'', vol. XIV, no. 5, May 1897, 402&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jepsen" /&gt;{{rp|165}}

===Impact of Hours of Service Act of 1907===

Long working hours were a major issue among railroad telegraphers. Railroad operators were the "air traffic controllers" of the railroads; long hours and the resulting fatigue could result in errors in judgment and serious accidents. In 1907, a bill was introduced in [[United States Congress|Congress]] to limit the maximum number of hours that railroad employees had to work in a twenty-four-hour period, known as the La Follette Hours of Service Act, after its chief sponsor, Senator [[Robert La Follette Sr.]] of Wisconsin. While this bill did not specifically address railroad telegraphers, a similar bill had been introduced and passed in the House of Representatives to limit the working hours of railroad telegraphers to no more than nine hours in a 24-hour period. 

This bill was offered as an amendment to the La Follette bill in the Senate; however, members of the committee to which it was referred bowed to pressure from the railroads and attempted to increase the maximum number of working hours allowed in a single day to twelve hours, a move which enraged ORT members. They immediately began using the telegraph to bombard their congressional representatives with messages of protest, which resulted in the original nine-hour limit being reinstated. The La Follette Hours of Service Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] on March 4, 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Hours of Service Act (Railroads), Mar. 4, 1907, ch. 2939, 34 Stat. 1415.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A Great Victory," ''Railroad Telegrapher'', vol. XXIV, No. 3, March 1907, 337-341&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the passage of the Hours of Service Act improved conditions for railroad operators, operators at small stations might still be required to remain "on duty" for as much as twelve hours in a day, or have their total working hours spread over a longer interval, known as a "split trick." The ORT supported an amendment to reduce the workday still further to eight hours and eliminate the split trick. However, the ORT did not coordinate its efforts with the other railroad unions, and when the [[Adamson Act]], passed in 1917, mandated an eight-hour working day for most railroad employees, it did not explicitly include telegraphers.&lt;ref name="Greenwood"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fink |first=Gary M. |authorlink= |title=Greenwood Encyclopedia of American Institutions: Labor Unions |url= |accessdate= |year=1977 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, CT |isbn=978-0837189383 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|316}}

===Nationalization of the railroads, 1917-1920===

With the entry of the U.S. into the [[World War I|first World War]], the railroad and telegraph industries were placed under government control. On December 26, 1917, the [[United States Railroad Administration]] (USRA) took control of the railroads.&lt;ref&gt;Presidential Proclamation 1419, December 26, 1917, under authority of the [[Army Appropriations Act of 1916|Army Appropriation Act]], {{USStat|39|45}}, August 29, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; The USRA was generally supportive of the interests of the union members; during the period of [[nationalization]], railroad operators were limited to an eight-hour workday and the ORT was granted collective bargaining capability on a national level. The ORT was able to sign agreements with the Santa Fe, the [[Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad]], the Reading Railroad, and the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. By 1917, ORT membership had grown to 46,000.

A Board of Railroad Wages and Working Conditions was set up by the Railroad Administration. ORT Grand Chief Perham appeared before the Board to request a 40 percent increase in pay, an [[eight-hour day]], and relief from handling government mail by railroad telegraphers.  While the Board did provide minimal wage increases, they were far less than the requested 40 percent, and the resulting discontent among ORT members resulted in Perham's defeat in a 1919 election and his replacement as Grand Chief by E. J. Manion. Federal control of the railroads ended on March 1, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Esch–Cummins Act, Pub.L. 66-152, {{USStat|41|456}}. Approved 1920-02-28.&lt;/ref&gt; When the contracts that had been negotiated while under federal control expired the following year, the ORT had to re-negotiate agreements with the individual railroads.&lt;ref name="McIsaac" /&gt;{{rp|33-46}}

===The ORT in the 1920s===

The early 1920s were the peak years for ORT membership; by 1922, the union boasted 78,000 members in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.  Some railroads, including the Santa Fe, the [[Louisville and Nashville]], and the [[Great Northern Route|Great Northern]], maintained essentially the same agreements with the ORT that they had established during the years of government control.  A dispute with the [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad|Atlantic Coast Line]] led to a strike in 1925 that ended with the railroad making concessions to the union and signing a new agreement.

===The Great Depression===

Membership in the ORT began to decline after the stock market crash of 1929, due not only to economic conditions but also to the increasing use of [[centralized traffic control]], which no longer required the presence of a telegrapher in each station. The membership fell to 63,000 in 1929, and continued to fall throughout the [[Great Depression|Depression]] years of the 1930s. As a result of the declining membership and the loss of revenue from dues, the ORT was forced to suspend payment of pensions to retired members through the mutual benefit program.

===The ORT versus Railway Express, 1944===

By the beginning of World War II, ORT membership had fallen to around 40,000 as the railroads became involved in the war effort.  Railroad telegraphers often had multiple employment as station agents, express agents, and Western Union telegraphers, with each employer paying a portion of the operators' salary. In 1930, the [[Railway Express Agency]], which employed some ORT members as express agents, began handling shipments of perishable items, which had previously been handled as freight shipments on the [[Seaboard Air Line Railroad]]. The ORT members who served as express agents as well as telegraphers for the railroad were offered individual pay adjustments on short notice, which the ORT claimed was a violation of the [[Railway Labor Act]] of 1926, which required 30 days' notice of any pay adjustment. Additionally, the ORT charged that the individual pay adjustments were in violation of a collective bargaining agreement that had been signed with Railway Express in 1917.  

When the company refused to participate in a Board of Adjustment, a suit was brought by the ORT in [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]]. The court's decision in favor of the ORT was reversed by the [[United States courts of appeals|Circuit Court of Appeals]], and the suit was finally brought to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], which decided in favor of the union in 1944. The Supreme Court decision established the primacy of agreements reached by collective bargaining over individual agreements, and upheld the union's right to engage in collective bargaining on behalf of its members.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Supreme Court, ''Telegraphers v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., {{Ussc|321|342|1944}}, Order of Railroad Telegraphers v. Railway Express Agency, Inc.'', No. 343, Argued Nov. 10, 1943, Decided Feb. 28, 1944&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name Changes and Final Years===

The decline of the railroad industry in the 1950s and 1960s led to layoffs and discharges of ORT members.  When the ORT attempted to protect its members' jobs by demanding the right to veto job cutbacks, it was accused of "[[featherbedding]]," requiring the employment of unnecessary workers, by railroad executives.  The ORT called a strike in 1962 to protest layoffs of 600 telegraphers on the [[Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railroad]].  A mediation board created by President [[John F. Kennedy]] found in favor of the railroad in October 1962, calling the layoffs justified and denying the union the right to veto layoffs. However, the railroad was required to give 90 days' notice to terminated employees, and to pay laid-off telegraphers 60 percent of their annual salary for as much as five years.&lt;ref&gt;"Public Policy: An End to Featherbedding," ''Time'', Friday, October 19, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the ORT changed its name to the Transportation Communications Employees Union; that union was merged into the Brotherhood of Railway &amp; Airline Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express &amp; Station Employes (BRAC) in 1969. At the time of the merger, the ORT had about 30,000 members. In 1985, BRAC chose to revive the TCU identity, and in July 2005, the "new" TCU affiliated with the [[International Association of Machinists]], with full merger to occur no later than January 2012.&lt;ref name="Greenwood" /&gt;{{rp|317}} &lt;ref&gt;"About TCU," http://www.goiam.org/index.php/tcunion/about-tcu&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pionen.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Pionen in 2006, before it became a computer center.]]

'''Pionen''' is a former civil defence center built in the [[Vita Bergen|White Mountains]] Södermalm borough of [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] in 1943 to protect essential government functions from nuclear{{fact|date=July 2017}} strike. The address of the Pionen [[data center]] is Renstiernas gata 35 and 37.

It was converted into a [[data center]] by the Swedish Internet service provider [[Bahnhof]]. It opened on 11 September 2008 and Bahnhof continues to use the facility today.&lt;ref name=idg /&gt;&lt;ref name=realtid /&gt; Because of the facility being buried under the mountain, secured by a 40-centimeter thick door, and only reachable by an entrance tunnel, the [[data center]] is capable of withstanding a [[hydrogen bomb]]. The Pionen data center is also a [[colocation centre]].  In 2010 [[WikiLeaks]] used Pionen's colocation services to store their servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hanlon|first=Michael|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1337014/WikiLeaks-bunker-Julian-Assanges-subterranean-Bond-villain-den.html|title=Just like out of a Bond film: Inside the astonishing subterranean WikiLeaks bunker|publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd|accessdate=14 June 2011|location=London|date=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environment==
Pionen is a [[data center]] deep below 30 meters of [[granite]], with three physical datalinks into the mountain. Also, Pionen is located in Central Stockholm, with 1,100 square meters of space. Pionen features [[fountain]]s, [[greenhouse]]s, simulated daylight and a huge salt water [[fish tank]]. Its [[data center]] has two backup power generators, which are actually submarine engines.

[[Image:UHFmodulator.jpg|thumb|[[ASTEC]] UM 1286 [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] modulator, top cover taken off]]

An '''RF modulator''' (or '''radio frequency modulator''') is an electronic device whose input is a [[baseband]] signal which is used to [[modulation|modulate]] a [[radio frequency]] source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beer |first=Nick |title=Servicing Satellite TV Equipment |page=119 |date=1998 |publisher=Newnes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MX-PcPnHzxsC&amp;pg=PA119#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=0-7506-3425-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RF modulators are used to convert games like signals from devices such as [[Portable media player|media players]], [[Videocassette recorder|VCRs]] and [[game console]]s to a format that can be handled by a device designed to receive a modulated RF input, such as a [[radio]] or [[television]] receiver.

== History ==

Prior to the introduction of specialised [[video connector]] standards such as [[SCART]], TVs were designed to only accept signals through the aerial connector: signals originate at a TV station, are transmitted over the air, and are then received by an antenna and demodulated within the TV. When equipment was developed which could use a television receiver as its display device, such as [[Videocassette recorder|VCRs]], [[DVD player]]s, early [[Home computer|home computers]], and [[video game console]]s, the signal was modulated and sent to the RF input connector.

The aerial connector is standard on all TV sets, even very old ones. Since later television designs include [[Composite video|composite]], [[S-Video]], and [[component video]] jacks, which skip the modulation and demodulation steps, modulators are no longer included as standard equipment, and RF modulators are now largely a third-party product, purchased primarily to run newer equipment such as DVD players with an old television set.

== Design ==

Technically, RF modulation usually means combining the data with a [[carrier signal]] at a standardized frequency. Either [[Amplitude modulation|amplitude]] or [[frequency modulation]] may be used, as required by the receiving equipment.

In North America, RF modulators generally output on channel 3 or 4 ([[Very high frequency|VHF]]), which may be selectable, although the [[Atari]] consoles offer channels 2 and 3. In Europe standard modulators usually used channel 36 (UHF) by default, but are usually tunable over part or all of the UHF band.

Modulating a TV signal with stereo sound is relatively complex; most low-cost home TV modulators produce a signal with monaural audio. Even some units that have two or more audio inputs simply combine the left and right audio channels into one mono audio signal. Some used on very early home computers had no sound capability at all. Most cheaper modulators (i.e. not intended for [[Cable television|professional use]]) lack [[vestigial sideband]] filtering.

TV modulators generally feature [[analog passthrough]], meaning that they take input both from the device and from the usual antenna input, and the antenna input "passes through" to the TV, with minor [[insertion loss]] due to the added device. In some cases the antenna input is always passed through, while in other cases the antenna input is turned off when the device is outputting a signal, and only the device signal is sent onward, to reduce interference.

RF modulators produce a relatively poor picture, as image quality is lost during both the modulation from the source device, and the demodulation in the television.

== Uses ==
[[Image:Tangerine Microtan 65 Main Board.jpg|thumb|The [[motherboard]] of an early [[microcomputer]], the [[Tangerine MICROTAN 65|Microtan 65]], showing the silver-cased ASTEC 1111EM36 UHF TV modulator at top left]]
[[Image:C64 opened RF modulator on ASSY NO 250427 motherboard 1984.jpg|upright=0.75|thumb|RF modulator inside the [[Commodore 64]] manufactured in 1984, [[PAL]] system]]

=== Integrated modulators ===

RF modulators are commonly integrated into VCRs, in video game consoles up to and including the [[history of video game consoles (fourth generation)|fourth generation]], and in 8- and 16-bit [[home computer]]s.

Some systems were supplied with an external modulator unit that connected to both the system and to the antenna jacks of a television. One reason for this is that a device which outputs an RF signal must in general be certified by regulatory authorities—such as the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) — and thus by having an external RF modulator, only the modulator itself needed to be certified, rather than the entire video game system.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

=== Broadcasting modulators ===
[[Image:Cable headend modulator.jpg|thumb|Cable TV Agile Modulator]]

RF modulators may also be used to take the audio and video signal from a [[PAL]] or [[NTSC]] [[composite video]], [[RGB color model|RGB]], [[YUV]] or other composite AV source, and generate a broadcast RF signal that can be fed into a television's aerial/coaxial connector.

Multi-channel RF modulators are commonly used in home audio/video distribution. These devices have multiple audio and video inputs and one RF output. Audio/video outputs from source devices such as a DVD player, VCR, or DSS receiver are connected to the audio/video inputs on the modulator. The modulator is then programmed to broadcast the signals on a certain frequency. That RF broadcast is then received by the connected TV. When the TV is tuned to the programmed channel, the video and audio signal of the source device is accessed. RF modulation can become difficult in a [[Cable television|CATV]] system. High pass, low pass, and notch filters must be used to block certain frequencies, or channels, so that the modulator can broadcast the audio/video signal of the source device on that channel.

"Professional" modulators such as those used in the CATV industry generally include vestigial sideband filtering which is generally absent on "consumer" grade modulators.

Audio RF modulators are used in low-end car audio to add devices like [[Compact Disc player#CD changer|CD changers]] without requiring dashboard hardware upgrades. For example, a portable CD player's [[Phone connector (audio)|headphone jack]] is connected to the modulator, which outputs a low-power [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio signal that is played through the car radio. Car FM modulators suffer from loss of quality and interference issues.  Later devices which would use these types of modulators would be [[iPod]]s and similar [[portable media player]]s.

'''Real-time transcription''' is the general term for [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] by [[court reporters]] using [[real-time text]] technologies to deliver computer text screens within a few seconds of the words being spoken. Specialist software allows participants in [[court hearings]] or [[Deposition (law)|depositions]] to make notes in the text and highlight portions for future reference.

Typically, real-time writers can produce text using  machines at the rate of at least 200 [[words per minute]].  Stenographers can typically type up to 300 words per minute for short periods of time, but most cannot sustain such a speed.

Real-time transcription is also used in the [[broadcasting]] environment where it is more commonly termed "captioning."

== Career opportunities ==

Real-time reporting is used in a variety of industries, including entertainment, television, the Internet, and law.

Specific careers include the following:

* Judicial reporters use a stenotype to provide instant transcripts on computer screens as a trial or deposition occurs.
* [[Communication access real-time translation]] (CART) reporters assist the hearing-impaired by transcribing spoken words, giving them personal access to the communications they need day to day.
* Television broadcast captioners use real-time reporting technology to allow hard-of-hearing or deaf people to see what is being said on live television broadcasts such as news, emergency broadcasts, sporting events, awards shows, and other programs.
* Internet information (or Webcast) reporters provide real-time reporting of sales meetings, press conferences, and other events, while simultaneously transmitting the transcripts to computers worldwide.
* Other rapid data entry positions.

The robot's vocabulary may be updated with the help of a laptop (connected to the back by cables) and the Internet.&lt;ref name=CP&gt;{{cite news |title= Roxxxy the sex robot focuses on meaningful conversation instead of lifelike movement|author= Peter Svensson|url= https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5iLulKBwj4dp9evDPdb_HGvIBti1Q|agency = [[The Canadian Press]]|date= January 11, 2010|accessdate= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Douglas Hines, Roxxxy garnered about 4,000 pre-orders shortly after its AEE reveal in 2010. However, as reported by [[Jenny Kleeman]] in April 2017, no actual customers have ever surfaced with a Roxxxy doll, and the public has remained skeptical that any commercial Roxxxy dolls have ever been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kleeman|first1=Jenny|title=The race to build the world’s first sex robot|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/27/race-to-build-world-first-sex-robot|publisher=Guardian|date=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Speirs + Major''' is a UK [[Architectural lighting design|lighting design]] practice founded by Jonathan Speirs (1958-2012) and Mark Major in 1993. The practice is noted for its illumination of many prominent buildings, including [[Barajas International Airport]],&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rogers Partnership. [http://www.richardrogers.co.uk/Asp/uploadedFiles/Image/26b42_Nat%20Barajas/RSHP_A_JS_2642_L_E_GB.pdf "Terminal 4 Barajas Airport Madrid"], ''[[Richard Rogers Partnership]]'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="barajasreview"&gt;Slessor, Catherine.[http://www.arplus.com/broch/articles/july%202006%20pdfs/arJuly06Rogersdone.pdf "Spanish Soft Machine"], ''[[Architectural Review]]'', July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[30 St Mary Axe]] (‘[[The Gherkin]]’), the [[Millennium Dome]] and the interior of [[St. Pauls Cathedral]].&lt;ref name="Stpauls"&gt;Kolb, Jaffer. [http://www.archlighting.com/industry-news.asp?articleID=460768&amp;sectionID=1334 "Divine Light"], ''Architectural Lighting'', November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The firm has also developed lighting master plans for several British cities, including [[Cambridge]], [[Coventry]], [[Durham, England|Durham]],&lt;ref name="durham"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wear/6925536.stm "Plan to illuminate historic city"], ''[[BBC News]]'', August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], and for major private developments including [[Greenwich Peninsula]] and [[Kings Cross Central|King’s Cross Central]], [[London]].

Speirs + Major has been credited with helping to raise awareness of the lighting design profession in the UK.&lt;ref name="majorprofile"&gt;Kennett, Stephen. [http://www.building.co.uk/setting-the-world-alight/3060590.article "Setting the world alight"], ''Building Services Journal'', January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Today it employs approximately 38 people drawn from disciplines including architecture, art, lighting, interior, graphic and theatrical design. Its studios are based in [[London]] and [[Edinburgh]], UK.

== Lighting architects ==
Both founding members Jonathan Speirs, who died in 2012, and Mark Major trained and practiced as architects before focusing on lighting design. In interviews&lt;ref name=majorprofile/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jonathan Profile"&gt;Mansfield, Susan. [http://living.scotsman.com/features/That-warm-glow-of-success.2332508.jp "That warm glow of success"], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', June 2002&lt;/ref&gt; they have argued that light should be embedded at the heart of the architectural design process rather than applied as a ‘cosmetic add-on’.&lt;ref name=majorprofile/&gt; This integral approach to light&lt;ref name="architectsjournal"&gt;Alexander, Kaye. [http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/designingbuildings/materials/2008/09/seeing_the_light.html "Seeing the light"], ''The [[Architects Journal]]'', September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; has led them to adopt the term ‘lighting architect’ to describe their role as ‘building with light as opposed to bricks and mortar’.&lt;ref name=majorprofile/&gt;

'''Steel plate construction''' is a rapid method of constructing heavy [[reinforced concrete]] items.  It was developed in Korea in 2004.  At a steel fabricator, assemblies are constructed.  Each assembly has two parallel plates joined with welded stringers.  The assemblies are moved to the job site and placed with a crane.  The plates are welded so that they form parallel walls joined by stringers.  Finally, the space between the plate walls is filled with concrete.

Steel plate construction is roughly twice the speed of other reinforced concrete construction, because it avoids tying rebar and constructing forms on-site.  The parallel plate assemblies can be constructed quickly in specialized off-site fabrication facilities.  
The method has excellent strength because the steel is on the outside, where tensile forces are often greatest.

Because the construction time is about half, sunk interest costs for heavy construction projects are about half when this method is used.

The method is of special interest for rapidly constructing nuclear power plants, which use large reinforced concrete structures, and typically have long construction times, with heavy interest costs.

'''Thermal destratification''' is the process of mixing the internal air in a building to eliminate stratified layers and achieve [[temperature]] equalization throughout the [[building envelope]]. 

== Thermal stratification in buildings ==
Destratification is the reverse of the natural process of thermal stratification, which is the layering of differing (normally rising) air temperatures from floor to ceiling. Stratification is caused by hot air rising up to the ceiling or roof space because it is lighter than the surrounding cooler air. Conversely, cool air falls to the floor as it is heavier than the surrounding warmer air.

In a stratified building, temperature differentials of up to 1.5°C per vertical foot is common, and the higher a building's ceiling, the more extreme this temperature differential can be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esta.org.uk/RESOURCES/PUBLICATIONS/documents/DRUMBEATWHITEPAPER-ThermalDestratificationInBuildings.pdf|title=Thermal Destratification in Buildings: The missing piece to the HVAC puzzle|last=|first=|date=|website=www.esta.org.uk|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In extreme cases, temperature differentials of 10°C have been found over a height of 1 meter. Other variables that influence the level of thermal stratification include heat generated by people and processes present in the building, insulation of the space from outside weather conditions, solar gain, specification of the HVAC system, location of supply and return ducts, and vertical air movement inside the space, usually supplied by destratification fans. [[Computational fluid dynamics]] can be used to predict the level of stratification in a space.

=== Effects of thermal stratification ===
In a study conducted by the Building Scientific Research Information Association, the wasted energy due to stratification increased consistently based on temperature differential from floor to ceiling (ΔT).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://p.airiusfans.com/bsria-study|title=Wasted Energy Due to Stratification|author=BSRIA|website=|access-date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study indicates that stratified buildings tend to overheat or overcool based on the temperature at the thermostat, which tends to be lower than the overall heat energy present in the room. The study also showed that energy waste due to stratification was present at ceiling heights ranging from 20 ft. to 40 ft, and higher ceilings caused higher energy waste, even at the same ΔT. Since ΔT tends to be higher in taller ceilings, the effect of stratification is compounded, causing substantial energy waste in tall buildings.

=== Definition of destratification ===
Since stratification and the costs associated with it are linear, the definition of destratification will differ based on opinion and use case. Full destratification, or a 0° ΔT from floor to ceiling, is unlikely to occur in any building. Since the costs of stratification decrease linearly as ΔT approaches 5.4°F, and no study has yet looked at the effects of stratification below 5.4°F, it is not uncommon to consider any space with a ΔT below 5°F to be destratified. In the United States, [[ASHRAE]] Standard 55 prescribes 3°C as the limit for the vertical air temperature difference between head and ankle levels, but has no standard recommending an ideal ΔT between floor and ceiling.&lt;ref name="ashrae55"&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard 55-2004 -- Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy ([[ANSI]] Approved)|publisher=ASHRAE|location=Atlanta, GA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Destratification technologies ==
Reducing thermal stratification can be accomplished by controlling the variables that are associated with increased stratification. Since many of the variables, including ceiling height, people and processes, solar gain, and outside weather conditions cannot be controlled, the most common technologies used are related to the building's [[Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning|HVAC]] (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system. One of the cheapest, most effective, and easiest to install technologies are destratification fans, including both axial destratification fans and [[High-volume low-speed fan|HVLS]] (high-volume low-speed) fans.

=== Axial destratification fans ===
Axial destratification fans are self-contained units that are installed in an array at the ceiling with the goal of blowing conditioned air in the ceiling down to the floor, where people live and work. Because axial fans are designed to blow air straight down at the floor, they can be used in ceiling and roof structures over 100 ft. tall. Because axial destratification fans can achieve destratification with low CFMs, it is imperative that the air leaving the nozzle achieve an air speed at the floor of between 0.2 and 0.5 m/s. The result of this level of air movement is the integration of conditioned air from the ceiling with air at the floor level. Failing to impact the floor will result in destratification of medial layers of air but not achieve destratification at the floor. Since the area around the thermostat will not be destratified in this instance, it is hypothesized that there will be little or no cost savings, as the thermostat will continue to overheat or overcool the room.

An experiment in a room with a 21 ft. ceiling yielded a savings of 23.5% with the use of axial destratification fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://airiusfans.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Canada-Case-Study-Warm-Cold-Compiled.pdf|title=Cold Weather Destratification Energy Evaluation|publisher=Enbridge|date=June 2017|website=|access-date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HVLS fans ===
Because of their size, HVLS fans are normally installed in new construction, rather than retrofits, as the roof structure may have to be redesigned to accommodate the increased weight and size. It's not uncommon to require the relocation of lights, due to strobing as large fan blades pass under them, and sprinkler systems, which typically require unobstructed access to the floor to meet fire code. When used in the summer to encourage [[Evaporative cooler|evaporative cooling]], HVLS fans are run forward, blowing air at the floor. When used for destratification in the winter, the fans are run in reverse, blowing air towards ceiling which then circulates around the room. The height at which HVLS fans can be effective is limited compared to axial destratification fans.

== Benefits of destratification ==

This method has the most benefits through its application in the [[HVAC|heating, ventilation, and air conditioning]] (HVAC) industry and in heating and cooling for buildings and it has been found that "stratification is the single biggest waste of energy in buildings today."&lt;ref name=uon&gt;{{cite web|title=Mansfield Anodisers|url=https://nottingham.ac.uk/etc/cs-mansfieldanodisers.php|work=Case studies|publisher=Environmental Technology Centre, [[University of Nottingham]]|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== For reducing energy consumption ===
By incorporating thermal destratification technology into buildings, energy requirements are reduced as heating systems are no longer over-delivering in order to constantly replace the heat that rises away from the floor area, by redistributing the already heated air from the unoccupied ceiling space back down to floor level, until temperature equalisation is achieved. With regards to cooling destratification systems ensure the cooled air supplied is circulated fully and distributed evenly throughout internal environments, eliminating hot and cold spots and satisfying thermostats for longer periods of time.  As a result, destratification technology has great potential for carbon emission reductions due to the reduced energy requirement, and is in turn capable of cutting costs for businesses, sometimes by up to 50%.&lt;ref name="airius"&gt;{{cite web|title=Case study - Lush Retail Ltd|url=http://www.airius.co.uk/case-studies/lush/|publisher=Airius|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by [[The Carbon Trust]] which recommends destratification in buildings as one of its top three methods to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy efficient heating|url=http://www.carbontrust.com/resources/faqs/technology-and-energy-saving/energy-efficient-heating|publisher=Carbon trust|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For comfort ===
Destratification naturally increases air movement at the floor, reducing "hot spots" and "cold spots" in a room. It can be used in typically cold areas, like grocery store freezer cases, to warm patrons shopping nearby. In addition, air movement from destratification fans can be used to help meet ASHRAE Standard 62.1 by increasing the amount of air movement at the floor.

==Renewable Heat Incentive==
In the UK, thermodynamic solar panels cannot be used to claim the [[Renewable Heat Incentive]]. This is due to the lack of technical standards for the testing and installation. The UK Microgeneration Certification Scheme is working to develop a testing standard, either based on MIS 3001 or MIS 3005 or a brand new scheme document if appropriate.

==Performance==

Lab testing has been carried out by Das Wärmepumpen-Testzentrum Buchs (WPZ) in Buchs Switzerland on an Energi Eco 200esm/i thermodynamic solar panel system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Thermodynamic Panels works|url=http://www.magicboxinternational.com/hot-water/aluminium-collector-thermodynamic-panel/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This showed a [[Coefficient of performance]] of 2.8 or 2.9 (depending on tank volume).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23746">'''Vehicle-to-everything''' ('''V2X''') communication is the passing of information from a vehicle to any entity that may affect the vehicle, and vice versa. It is a [[Vehicular communication systems|vehicular communication system]] that incorporates other more specific types of communication as V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure), V2N ([[Vehicle-to-network]]), V2V ([[Vehicle-to-vehicle]]), V2P (Vehicle-to-Pedestrian), V2D ([[V2D|Vehicle-to-device]]) and V2G ([[Vehicle-to-grid]]).

The main motivations for V2X are road safety, traffic efficiency, and energy savings. There are two types of V2X communication technology depending on the underlying technology being used:

1) [[Wireless LAN|WLAN]] based, and

2) [[Cellular network|cellular]] based.

Standardization of WLAN based V2X supersedes that of cellular based V2X system. [[IEEE]] first published the specification of WLAN based V2X ([[IEEE 802.11p]]) in 2012.  It supports direct communication between vehicles (V2V) and between vehicle and infrastructure (V2I). [[DSRC]] uses the underlying radio communication provided by 802.11p.

In 2016, [[3GPP]] published V2X specifications based on [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] as the underlying technology. It is generally referred to as "cellular V2X" (C-V2X) to differentiate itself from the 802.11p based V2X technology.  In addition to the direct communication (V2V, V2I), C-V2X also supports wide area communication over cellular network (V2N). This additional mode of communication and native migration path to 5G are two main advantages over 802.11p based V2X system.

As of December 2017, a European automotive manufacturer has announced to deploy V2X technology based on 802.11p from 2019&lt;ref name="5GAA-ref2"&gt; An assessment of LTE - V2X (PC5) and 802.11p direct communications technologies for improved road safety in the EU (http://5gaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/5GAA-Road-safety-FINAL2017-12-05.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;. Recent study and analysis in 2017&lt;ref name="5GAA-ref2" /&gt; and 2018&lt;ref name="5GAA-ref3"&gt; White Paper on ITS spectrum utilization in the Asia Pacific Region (http://5gaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/5GAA_WhitePaper_ITS-spectrum-utilization-in-the-Asia-Pacific-Region_FINAL_160718docx.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;, all performed by 5GAA, the industry organisation supporting and developing the C-V2X technology, indicate that cellular-based C-V2X technology in direct communication mode is superior to 802.11p in multiple aspects, such as performance, communication range, and reliability. Many of these claims are disputed, e.g. in a whitepaper published by NXP&lt;ref name="NXP-ref1"&gt; C-ITS: Three observations on LTE-V2X and ETSI ITS-G5—A comparison (https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/white-paper/CITSCOMPWP.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;, one of the companies active in the 802.11p based V2X technology.

== Technology overview ==

===802.11p ([[DSRC]])===

The original V2X communication uses [[Wireless LAN|WLAN]] technology and works directly between vehicles and vehicles (V2V) and traffic infrastructure (V2I), which form a [[Vehicular ad hoc network|vehicular ad-hoc network]] as two V2X senders come within each other’s range. Hence it does not require any communication infrastructure for vehicles to communicate, which is key to assure safety in remote or little-developed areas. WLAN is particularly well-suited for V2X communication, due to its low latency. It transmits messages known as Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAM)  or Basic Safety Message (BSM), and Decentralised Environmental Notification Messages (DENM). Other roadside infrastructure related messages are Signal Phase and Timing Message (SPAT), In Vehicle Information Message (IVI), and Service Request Message (SRM). The data volume of these messages is very low. The radio technology is part of the WLAN [[IEEE 802.11p|IEEE 802.11]] family of standards and known in the US as Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) and in Europe as ITS-G5.&lt;ref&gt;EN 302 663 Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS); Access layer specification for Intelligent Transport Systems operating in the 5 GHz frequency band (http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/302600_302699/302663/01.02.00_20/en_302663v010200a.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; To complement the direct communication mode, vehicles can be equipped with traditional cellular communication technologies, supporting V2N based services.

===3GPP (C-V2X)===

More recent V2X communication uses [[Cellular network]] and is called [[Cellular V2X]] (or C-V2X) to differentiate it from the WLAN based V2X.  There have been multiple industry organizations, such as [[5G Automotive Association]] (5GAA) promoting C-V2X due to its advantages over WLAN based V2X.&lt;ref name="5GAA-ref1"&gt;The Case for Cellular V2X for Safety and Cooperative Driving (http://5gaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/5GAA-whitepaper-23-Nov-2016.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; C-V2X is initially defined as [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] in [[3GPP]] Release 14 and is designed to operate in several modes: 1) Device-to-device (V2V or V2I), and 2) Device-to-network (V2N). In 3GPP Release 15, the V2X functionalities are expanded to support [[5G]]. The main advantage of C-V2X includes support of both direct communication between vehicles (V2V) and traditional cellular-network based communication. Also, C-V2X provides migration path to 5G based systems and services.

The direct communication between vehicle and other devices (V2V, V2I) uses so-called PC5 interface. PC5 refers to a reference point where the User Equipment (UE), i.e. mobile handset, directly communicates with another UE over the direct channel. In this case, the communication with the [[base station]] is not required. In system architectural level, proximity service (ProSe) is the feature that specifies the architecture of the direct communication between UEs.  In 3GPP RAN specifications, "sidelink" is the terminology to refer to the direct communication over PC5. PC5 interface was originally defined to address the needs of mission-critical communication for public safety community (Public Safety-LTE, or PS-LTE) in Release 13. The motivation of the mission-critical communication was to allow law enforcement agencies or emergency rescue to use the LTE communication even when the infrastructure is not available, such as natural disaster scenario.  In Release 14 onwards, the use of PC5 interface has been expanded to meet various market needs, such as communication involving wearable devices such as [[smartwatch]].  In C-V2X, PC5 interface is re-applied to the direct communication in V2V and V2I.

In addition to the direct communication over PC5, C-V2X also allows the C-V2X device to use the cellular network connection in the traditional manner over Uu interface.  Uu refers to the logical interface between the UE and the base station. This is generally referred to as vehicle-to-network (V2N). V2N is a unique use case to C-V2X and does not exist in 802.11p based V2X given that the latter supports direct communication only. However, similar to WLAN based V2X also in case of C-V2X, two communication radios are required to be able to communicate simultaneously via a PC5 interface with nearby stations and via the UU interface with the network.

== Use cases ==

Through its instant communication V2X allows road safety applications such as (non-exhaustive list):

* [[Collision avoidance system|Forward collision warning]]
*[[Lane departure warning system|Lane change warning]]/blind spot warning
* Emergency Electric Brake Light Warning
* Intersection Movement Assist
* [[Emergency vehicle]] Approaching
* [[Roadworks]] Warning

In the medium term V2X is perceived as a key enabler for autonomous driving, assuming it would be allowed to intervene into the actual driving. In that case vehicles would be able to join platoons, the way HGVs do.

== Standardisation history ==

===IEEE 802.11p===

WLAN-based V2X communication is based on a set of standards drafted by the [[ASTM International|American Society for Testing and Materials]] (ASTM). The ASTM E 2213 series of standards looks at wireless communication for high-speed information exchange between vehicles themselves as well as road infrastructure. The first standard of this series was published 2002. Here the acronym Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) was first used for V2X communication.

From 2004 onwards the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|Institute Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) started to work on wireless access for vehicles under the umbrella of their standards family IEEE 802.11 for Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN). Their initial standard for wireless communication for vehicles is known as [[IEEE 802.11p]] and is based on the work done by the ASTM. Later on in 2012 [[IEEE 802.11p]] was incorporated in IEEE 802.11.

Around 2007 when [[IEEE 802.11p]] got stable, IEEE started to develop the 1609.x standards family standardising applications and a security framework&lt;ref&gt;1609.x family of standards (http://odysseus.ieee.org/query.html?qt=1609.&amp;charset=iso-8859-1&amp;style=standard&amp;col=sa)&lt;/ref&gt; (IEEE uses the term WAVE), and soon after [[SAE International|SAE]] started to specify standards for V2V communication applications. SAE uses the term DSRC for this technology (this is how the term was coined in the US). In parallel at ETSI the technical committee for [[Intelligent transportation system]] (ITS) was founded and started to produce standards for protocols and applications&lt;ref&gt;ETSI TR 101 607; Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS); Cooperative ITS (C-ITS); Release 1

(http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/101600_101699/101607/01.01.01_60/tr_101607v010101p.pdf)
&lt;/ref&gt; (ETSI coined the term ITS-G5). All these standards are based on IEEE 802.11p technology.

Between 2012 and 2013, the Japanese [[Association of Radio Industries and Businesses]] (ARIB) specified, also based on IEEE 802.11, a V2V and V2I communication system in the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency band.&lt;ref&gt;ARIB STD-T109; 700 MHz BAND; INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS:

(http://www.arib.or.jp/english/html/overview/doc/5-STD-T109v1_2-E1.pdf)
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] published as summary of all V2V and V2I standards that are worldwide in use, comprising the systems specified by ETSI, IEEE, ARIB, and TTA (Republic of Korea, Telecommunication Technology Association).&lt;ref&gt;Recommendation ITU-R M.2084-0; Radio interface standards of vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications for Intelligent Transport System applications (https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/m/R-REC-M.2084-0-201509-I!!PDF-E.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

===3GPP===

[[3GPP]] started standardization work of cellular V2X (C-V2X) in Release 14 in 2014.  It is based on LTE as the underlying technology. Specifications were published in 2016.  Because this C-V2X functionalities are based on LTE, it is often referred to as LTE-V2X. The scope of functionalities supported by C-V2X includes both direct communication (V2V, V2I) as well as wide area celluar network communication (V2N). 

In Release 15, 3GPP continued its C-V2X standardization to be based on 5G.  Specifications are published in 2018 as Release 15 comes to completion. To indicate the underlying technology, the term 5G-V2X is often used in contrast to LTE-based V2X (LTE-V2X).  Either case, C-V2X is the generic terminology that refers to the V2X technology using the cellular technology irrespective of the specific generation of technology.

In Release 16, 3GPP further enhances the C-V2X functionality. The work is currently in progress. In this way, C-V2X is inherently future proof by supporting migration path to 5G.

Study and analysis were done &lt;ref name="5GAA-ref2" /&gt; &lt;ref name="5GAA-ref3" /&gt; to compare the effectiveness of direct communication technologies between LTE-V2X PC5 and 802.11p from the perspective of accident avoided and reduction in fatal and serious injuries. The study shows that LTE-V2X achieves higher level of accident avoidance and reduction in injury&lt;ref name="5GAA-ref2" /&gt;.  It also indicates LTE-V2X performs higher percentage of successful packet delivery and communication range. Another link-level and system-level simulation result indicates that, to achieve the same link performance for both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, lower signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) are achievable by LTE-V2X PC5 interface compared to IEEE 802.11p&lt;ref name="5GAA-ref3" /&gt;.

Cellular based V2X solution also leads to the possibility of further protecting other types of road users (e.g. pedestrian, cyclist) by having PC5 interface to be integrated into smartphones, effectively integrating those road users into the overall C-ITS solution.  Vehicle-to-person (V2P) includes Vulnerable Road User (VRU) scenarios to detect pedestrians and cyclists to avoid accident and injuries involving those road users. 

As both direct communication and wide area cellular network communication are defined in the same standard (3GPP), both modes of communication will likely be integrated into a single chipset.  Commercialization of those chipsets further enhances economy of scale and leads to possibilities to wider range of business models and services using both types of communications.

== Regulatory history ==

===US===

In 1999 the US [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) allocated 75&amp;nbsp;MHz in the spectrum of 5.850-5.925&amp;nbsp;GHz for intelligent transport systems.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Communication Commission -Amendment of Parts 2 and 90 of the Commission's Rules to Allocate the 5.850-5.925 GHz Band to the Mobile Service for Dedicated Short Range Communications of Intelligent Transportation Services ET Docket No.  98-95 (https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-99-305A1.doc)
&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the US Department of Transportation (USDOT) has been working with a range of stakeholders on V2X. In 2012 a pre-deployment project was implemented in Ann Arbor, Michigan. 2800 vehicles covering cars, motorcycles, buses and HGV of different brands took part using equipment by different manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;Safety Pilot Model Deployment Technical Fact Sheet (http://www.safercar.gov/staticfiles/safercar/connected/Technical_Fact_Sheet-Model_Deployment.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) saw this model deployment as proof that road safety could be improved and that WAVE standard technology was interoperable. In August 2014 NHTSA published a report arguing vehicle-to-vehicle technology was technically proven as ready for deployment.&lt;ref name="nhtsa_812014"/&gt; On 20 August 2014 the NHTSA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) in the Federal Register,&lt;ref&gt;Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communications, Docket No. NHTSA–2014–0022 (http://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/rulemaking/pdf/V2V/V2V-ANPRM_081514.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that the safety benefits of V2X communication could only be achieved if a significant part of the vehicles fleet was equipped. Because of the lack of an immediate benefit for early adopters, the NHTSA proposed a mandatory introduction. On 25 June 2015 the US House of Representatives held a hearing on the matter,&lt;ref&gt;Hearing in US Congress: https://energycommerce.house.gov/hearings-and-votes/hearings/vehicle-vehicle-communications-and-connected-roadways-future&lt;/ref&gt; where again the NHTSA, as well as other stakeholders argued the case for V2X.

===Europe===

To acquire EU-wide spectrum, radio applications require a harmonised standard, in case of ITS-G5 ETSI EN 302 571,&lt;ref&gt;First version ETSI EN 302 571: Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS); Radiocommunications equipment operating in the 5 855 MHz to 5 925 MHz frequency band; Harmonized EN covering the essential requirements of article 3.2 of the R&amp;TTE Directive (http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/302500_302599/302571/01.01.01_60/en_302571v010101p.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; first published in 2008. A harmonised standard in turn requires an ETSI System Reference Document, here ETSI TR 101 788.&lt;ref&gt;Here the 2014 version: Electromagnetic compatibility and Radio spectrum Matters (ERM); System Reference document (SRdoc); Technical characteristics for pan European harmonized communications equipment operating in the 5,855 GHz to 5,925 GHz range intended for road safety and traffic management, and for non-safety related ITS applications (http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/103000_103099/103083/01.01.01_60/tr_103083v010101p.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; Commission Decision 2008/671/EC harmonises the use of the 5 875-5 905&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency band for transport safety ITS applications.&lt;ref&gt;Commission Decision 2008/671/EC „on the harmonised use of radio spectrum in the 5875-5905 MHz frequency band for safety-related applications of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS)“ (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32008D0671)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the ITS Directive 2010/40/EU&lt;ref&gt;Directive 2010/40/EU on the framework for the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32010L0040)&lt;/ref&gt; was adopted. It aims to assure that ITS applications are interoperable and can operate across national borders, it defines priority areas for secondary legislation, which cover V2X and requires technologies to be mature. In 2014 the European Commission’s industry stakeholder “C-ITS Deployment Platform” started working on a regulatory framework for V2X in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;C-ITS Deployment Platform – Final Report, January 2016 (http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/its/doc/c-its-platform-final-report-january-2016.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; It identified key approaches to an EU-wide V2X security Public Key infrastructure (PKI) and data protection, as well as facilitating a mitigation standard&lt;ref&gt;Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS); Mitigation techniques to avoid interference between European CEN Dedicated Short Range Communication (CEN DSRC) equipment and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) operating in the 5 GHz frequency range  (http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102700_102799/102792/01.02.01_60/ts_102792v010201p.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; to prevent radio interference between ITS-G5 based V2X and road charging systems. The European Commission recognised ITS-G5 as the initial communication technology in its 5G Action Plan&lt;ref&gt;5G for Europe: An Action Plan – COM (2016) 588, footnote 29 (http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=17131)&lt;/ref&gt; and the accompanying explanatory document,&lt;ref&gt;5G Global Developments – SWD (2016) 306, page 9 (http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=17132)&lt;/ref&gt; to form a communication environment consisting of ITS-G5 and cellular communication as envisioned by EU Member States.&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdam Declaration – Cooperation in the field of connected and automated driving (https://english.eu2016.nl/binaries/eu2016-en/documents/publications/2016/04/14/declaration-of-amsterdam/2016-04-08-declaration-of-amsterdam-final-format-3.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; Various pre-deployment projects exist at EU or EU Member State level, such as SCOOP@F, the Testfeld Telematik, the digital testbed Autobahn, the Rotterdam-Vienna ITS Corridor, Nordic Way, COMPASS4D or C-ROADS.&lt;ref&gt;For C-ROADS see: [[Connecting Europe Facility]] – Transport 2015 Call for Proposals – Proposal for the Selection of Projects, pages 119-127 (https://ec.europa.eu/inea/sites/inea/files/20160712_cef_tran_brochure_web.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;


== Spectrum allocation ==

Spectrum allocation for C-ITS in various countries is shown in the following table. Due to the standardization of V2X in 802.11p preceding C-V2X standardization in [[3GPP]], spectrum allocation was originally intended for the 802.11p based system. However, the regulations are technology neutral so that the deployment of C-V2X is not excluded.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Country !! Spectrum (MHz) !! Allocated bandwidth (MHz)
|-
| Australia || 5855 – 5925 || 70
|-
| China || 5905 - 5925 (trials) || 20
|-
| Europe || 5875 – 5905 || 30
|-
| Japan || 755.5-764.5 and 5770 – 5850 || 9 and 80

==Consideration in the transition period==

The deployment of V2X technology (either C-V2X or 802.11p based products) will occur gradually over time. New cars will be equipped with either of the two technologies starting around 2020 and its proportion on the road is expected to increase gradually.  In the meantime, existing (legacy) vehicles will continue to exist on the road. This implies that the V2X capable vehicles will need to co-exist with non-V2X (legacy) vehicles or with V2X vehicles of incompatible technology.

The main obstacles to its adoption are legal issues and the fact that, unless almost all vehicles adopt it, its effectiveness is limited.&lt;ref name=EE1&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1319514 |title=Counter Argument: 3 Reasons We Need V2X |author=Junko Yoshida |date=2013-09-17|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; British weekly "The Economist" argues that autonomous driving is more driven by regulations than by technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21706258-worlds-most-valuable-startup-leading-race-transform-future|title=Uberworld| date=3 September 2016|work=Economist|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, more recent study&lt;ref name="5GAA-ref2" /&gt;  indicates that there are benefits in reducing traffic accidents even during the transitional period in which the technology is being adopted in the market.
