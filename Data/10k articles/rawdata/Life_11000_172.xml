'''Aisan Daulat Begum''' (died June, 1505, other spellings ''Ishan Daulat, Isan Daulat, Ësan Dawlat''{{sfn|Gulbadan|1902|p=243}}) was the [[Queen consort]] of [[Moghulistan]] as the first wife and chief consort of [[Yunus Khan]], a descendant of [[Chaghatai Khan]], the second son of [[Genghis Khan]]. She was the mother of [[Qutlugh Nigar Khanum]], and hence the grandmother of the first [[Mughal emperor]], [[Babur]].

==Family and lineage==
Aisan Daulat Begum was the daughter of the Sagharichi Tuman Begs, a subdivision of the Kunchi Mughals.{{sfn|Mukherjee|2001|p=114}} Her father was a powerful tribal chief, Mir Sher Ali Haji Kunji (Qunchin) Beg.{{sfn|Memoirs|1826|p=12}}{{sfn|Allahabad|1974|p=171}}{{sfn|Lal|1977|p=7}} She had many brothers, of whom three, Shiram Beg, Mazid Beg, and Ali Dost Beg, took leading parts in Babur's affairs.{{sfn|Gulbadan|1902|p=243-4}}

==Marriage==
In 1456 [[Abu Sa'id Mirza]], who had become the ruler of [[Transoxiana]], sent for Yunus Khan. Abu Sa'id had become annoyed with the frequent raids that the [[Mongol Empire|Moghul]]s under [[Esen Buqa II|Esen Buqa]] made into his territory. He raised Yunus to the khanship and sent him with an army to Moghulistan to oppose his brother. Yunus Khan quickly gained the support of several amirs and married Aisan Daulat Begum. Aisan Daulat Begum played an important part in contemporary politics right from her young days, when she was to be married. The ''[[Baburnama]]'' says that by marrying Aisan Daulat Begum, Yunus Khan along with Aisan Daulat were seated on a white felt. According to the Tureh or ancient Institutions of the Mughals, he was ordered and raised to khanship by the Sagharichi Tuman Begs who had attacked [[Moghulistan]].{{sfn|Memoirs|1826|p=12}}

Born in the desert and herself used to the rigors of the wild country, Aisan Daulat Begum was certainly the one to inculcate tenacity, self-reliance, courage to face hardships and a die hard attitude in her grandson Babur, which together became the integral feature of Babur's character and later the key to his success. Aisan Daulat Begum shared the many hardships for her husband's life for thirty years. Several times she fell into the hands of the enemy, but always came back from their clutches safely.{{sfn|Mukherjee|2001|p=114-5}}

By Aisan Daulat Begum, Yunus Khan had three daughters: [[Mihr Nigar Khanum]], [[Qutlugh Nigar Khanum]], and Khub Nigar Khanum.{{sfn|Babur|2006|p=12-13}} Her eldest daughter Mihr Nigar Khanum, whom Sultan Abu said Mirza took for his eldest son [[Sultan Ahmed Mirza]]. By Mirza She had neither a son nor a daughter. Her second daughter Quthlugh Nigar Khanum was married to [[Umar Shaikh Mirza II]], the King of [[Ferghana Valley]]. She was the mother of Emperor [[Babur]], the founder of the [[Mughal Empire]] of India as well as its first Emperor. Her third daughter was Khub Nigar Khanum, who was married to Muhammad Hussain Korkan Doghlet. He had by her one son and one daughter.{{sfn|Memoirs|1826|p=12}}

In [[Kashghar]], in 1455-56, when her daughter Mihr Nigar Khanum was an infant at the breast, Aisan Daulat Begum was captured, but was returned in safety to her husband. In [[Tashkand]] in 1472-73, when Yunus Khan had gone to buy barley at a time of dearth in Moghalistan, Aisan Daulat Begum was again captured, but returned with honour to her husband. Aisan Daulat Begum shared the vicissitudes of her remarkable husband's remarkable career for some thirty years; nursed him through two years of paralytic helplessness til his death in 1487 at the age of seventy four, and survived him about eighteen years.{{sfn|Gulbadan|1902|p=244}}

==Regent to Babur==
Aisan Daulat Begum contributed a lot to the making of Babur a disciplined and preserving man. She was virtually his counselor through his early struggle to hold [[Farghana]]. In 1494, when [[Umar Shaikh Mirza II]] died, Babur was an insecure boy of about of eleven years old.{{sfn|Thilagavathi|2009|p=200}}{{sfn|Jain|2003|p=218}} He found himself surrounded by enemies from his own families, who were keen on ousting him from his father's principality of Farghana. Right from that time, Aisan Daulat Begum was constantly by her grandson's side, guiding him and helping him overcome many a political crisis. In her hands lay the real administrative power and control of the state affairs and Babur always took her advice in these matters. Old officers were reshuffled and new officers were put in charge of the administration of many areas like [[Andijan]], [[Aush]], [[Akhsikath|Akhsi]] and Marghinan.{{sfn|Mukherjee|2001|p=115}}{{sfn|Eraly|2007|p=132}}

Towards the end of 1494 Babur faced a political crisis when Hasan-i-Yaqub planned to dethrone Babur and raise his younger brother [[Jahangir Mirza]] to the throne. Apart from the support of his father Yaqub, Hasan also had the support of some disaffected nobles like Muhammad Baqir Beg, Sultan Muhammad Duldai, etc. But his plans were soon discovered and nobles loyal to Babur like Khwaja-i-Qazi, Qasim Quchin, and Ali Dost Taghai hastened to meet Aisan Daulat Begum to inform her about these developments. Immediately Aisan Daulat Begum took action against the conspirators. Babur was sent with some trusted people from the gate house of the outer fort towards the citadel to seize Hasan-i-Yaqub and his supporters. On reaching the place they got to know that Hasan was out on a hawking excursion. Babur's men fell upon Hasan's supporters and made them captives.

When Hasan learned about this, he fled to Samarkand to get the help of Sultan Mahmud Mirza. But, he changed his mind after reaching Kand-i-Badam, and decided to deliver a surprise attack on Akshi and convert it into a base for further attack on Andijan, where he could wait for the arrival for his ally [[Sultan Mahmud Mirza]]. Aisan Daulat Begum got to know of this plan too and once again she took the necessary plans to deal with it. An army was sent to deal with Hasan-i-Yaqub. Hasan-i-Yaqub came forward to meet it, but in the dark of the night a chance arrow from his own soldiers killed him. Thus, Babur was saved from the evil designs of Hasan-i-Yaqub, who had failed to understand the capabilities of Aisan Daulat Begum, the lady who was the real power behind Babur.{{sfn|Mukherjee|2001|p=115-6}}

In Andijan in 1497-98, when the town was taken from her grandson Babur by his kinsfolk. She was sent after him in safety to [[Khojand]], and from there went on to the protection of her third daughter's home in [[Kashghar]]. At [[Samarkand]] in  1500-1, when the town was taken by Shaibam. She remained behind when Babur left the place, and rejoined him in a few months with his "family, heavy baggage, and a few lean and hungry followers."{{sfn|Gulbadan|1902|p=244}}

==Later years and death==
Aisan Daulat Begum continued to guide and support her grandson in his days as a wanderer. It was she who had related to him stories of the military exploits of [[Timur]] and Genghis Khan, and these served as his preliminary lesson in the art of warfare. About his grandmother Aisan Daulat Begum, Babur in his own words said: "Few among women will have been my grandmother's equal for judgement and counsel; she was very wise and farsighted and most affairs of mine were carried through under her advise."{{sfn|Mukherjee|2001|p=116}} News of her death reached Babur in Kabul early in June, 1505 during the forty days mourning for his mother.{{sfn|Gulbadan|1902|p=244}}

European countries have taken a leading role in animal ethics with the first animal welfare group the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, (SPCA) beginning in Great Britain in 1824.

==Fictional character biography==

===Eddie Brock===
{{main|Eddie Brock}}
The 2008 story ''"[[New Ways to Die]]"'' features the first appearance of Anti-Venom.&lt;ref name="Amazing568"&gt;{{Cite comic |writer=[[Dan Slott|Slott, Dan]] |penciller=[[John Romita Jr.|Romita Jr., John]] |inker=[[Klaus Janson|Janson, Klaus]] |colorist=White, Dean |letterer=Petit, Cory |editor=Brennan, Tom, Wacker, Stephen, [[Tom Brevoort|Brevoort, Tom]] |story=New Ways to Die, Part One: Back with Vengeance |title=[[The Amazing Spider-Man]] |volume=1 |issue=568 |date=October 2008 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |location=New York, NY |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eddie Brock gets a job at a soup kitchen under [[Mister Negative|Martin Li]]. Brock is unknowingly cured of his cancer by Li, who possesses special abilities, and Brock believes it to be a miracle.&lt;ref name="Amazing568"/&gt; After Brock is attacked by [[Mac Gargan]] who is the current [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], the symbiote attempts to reunite with Brock. Brock's skin becomes [[Corrosive substance|caustic]] to the symbiote and he is enveloped in a new white symbiote forged from the remnants of the Venom symbiote in his body bonding with his white blood cells charged with Li's healing energy, becoming Anti-Venom.&lt;ref name="Amazing568"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic |writer=[[Dan Slott|Slott, Dan]] |penciller=[[John Romita Jr.|Romita Jr., John]] |inker=[[Klaus Janson|Janson, Klaus]] |colorist=White, Dean |letterer=Petit, Cory |editor=Brennan, Tom, Wacker, Stephen, [[Tom Brevoort|Brevoort, Tom]] |story=New Ways To Die, Part Two: The Osborn Supremacy |title=[[The Amazing Spider-Man]] |volume=1 |issue=569 |date=October 2008 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |location=New York, NY |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eddie later sacrificed his Anti-Venom symbiote to cure people from the Spider-Island virus.

===Second host===
During the "[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]" storyline, a new Anti-Venom is seen in the crowd of new heroes attending a "self help" style seminar being held by [[Roderick Kingsley]] (the first [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]]). All the new heroes have been given heroic personas by Kingsley that already exist, but are no longer used. It is not shown whether the new Anti-Venom is indeed a symbiote or just a man in a suit designed to look like the original symbiote. However, the speech bubble used for the character is stylized in a way to suggest a distortion of the characters voice similar to the way Eddie Brock spoke when he had the Anti-Venom symbiote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic |writer=[[Kevin Shinick|Shinick, Kevin]] |penciller=[[Javier Rodríguez (artist)|Rodríguez, Javier]] |inker=Lopez, Alvaro |colorist=Rodríguez, Javier |letterer=Cowles, Clayton |editor=Pyle, Ellie |story=Got A Problem? Call Hobgoblin! |title=AXIS: Hobgoblin |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=December 2014 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |location=New York, NY |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flash Thompson===
{{main|Flash Thompson}}
During the "Venom Inc." arc, Dr. Steven used elements of the Anti-Venom symbiote to create a new cure for the Venom symbiote's [[toxic shock syndrome]] that could adapt alongside it. When high concentrations of this serum was exposed to the Venom symbiote's biomass bonded to Flash Thompson, the Anti-Venom symbiote was recreated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic |writer=[[Dan Slott|Slott, Dan]], [[Mike Costa|Costa, Mike]] |penciller=[[Ryan Stegman|Stegman, Ryan]] |inker=Stegman, Ryan |colorist=Reber, Brian |letterer=Caramagna, Joe |editor=[[Nick Lowe (comics)|Lowe, Nick]], Lewis, Devin, Stock, Allison, Groneman, Thomas |story=Venom Inc. Part One |title=Amazing Spider-Man: Venom Inc. Alpha |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=February 2018 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |location=New York, NY |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==

Anyone possessed by the Anti-Venom symbiote possesses superhuman strength, durability, and stamina, an accelerated healing factor, genetic memory, detection of its Symbiote offspring, wall-crawling, web-generating abilities, spider-senses, immunity to Spider-Man's spider-senses, and camouflage.

Unlike the other Symbiotes, the original Anti-Venom symbiote used by Eddie Brock is immune to fire, heat, and sound-based attacks. In addition, the Anti-Venom symbiote can produce antibodies that can "cure" a person afflicted by things like radioactivity, parasites, diseases, and drugs.

However, Anti-Venom does possess a few weaknesses of its own. It is vulnerable to high concentrations of [[Norman Osborn]]'s super-venom via [[Freak (Marvel Comics)#Freak (Spider-Man villain)|Freak]]'s DNA. Additionally since Martin Li's healing touch created the Anti-Venom symbiote, [[Mister Negative]]'s corrupting touch can interfere or halt Anti-Venom's healing abilities. Also as seen during the Spider-Island event, overusing his healing powers can cause Anti-Venom's powers to weaken.

==In other media==
===Television===
The Anti-Venom symbiote's animated debut is seen on ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man vs the Sinister Six]]'', voiced by [[Matt Lanter]].&lt;ref name="Anti-Venom"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Anti-Venom |episode-link= |url= |access-date=December 11, 2017 |series=Marvel's Ultimate Spider-Man vs. the Sinister 6 |series-link=Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series) |first1=Matt |last1=Wayne |first2=Jae Woo |last2=Kim |network=[[Disney XD]] |date=April 3, 2016 |season=4 |series-no= |number=8 |minutes= |time=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version is created by [[Doctor Octopus]] and [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]] from a sample of the Venom symbiote, and [[Harry Osborn]] is its host. In its self-titled episode "Anti-Venom", this symbiote is created as a candidate for Doc Ock's [[Sinister Six]]. Anti-Venom nearly kills [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]] only to be stopped by an ion inhibitor used by [[Spider-Man]] and [[Norman Osborn|Iron Patriot]] which leaves Anti-Venom unconscious, and its host in a coma. Anti-Venom returns in "The Symbiote Saga" three-part episode. During the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] symbiote's infestation, Anti-Venom ends up awakening from the coma to neutralize the Carnage outbreak. At Carnage's core, Anti-Venom almost gets consumed by Carnage's 'heart' until Spider-Man's secret identity is revealed to get through to Harry. Anti-Venom eventually destroys itself curing New York of Carnage's infestation.

In [[artificial intelligence]] (AI), '''anticipation''' occurs when an [[Intelligent agent|agent]] makes decisions based on its explicit beliefs about the future. More broadly, "anticipation" can also refer to the ability to act in appropriate ways that take future events into account, without necessarily explicitly possessing a model of the future events.

==In AI==
An agent employing anticipation would try to predict the future state of the environment (weather in this case) and make use of the  predictions in the decision making. For example,

 If the sky is cloudy and the air pressure is low,
   it will probably rain soon
      so take the umbrella with you.
 Otherwise
   leave the umbrella home.

These rules explicitly take into account possible future events.

In 1985, [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]] defined an anticipatory system as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[Anticipatory Systems; Philosophical, Mathematical, and Methodological Foundations|Anticipatory Systems: Philosophical, Mathematical, and Methodological Foundations]], Robert Rosen, 1985, Pergamon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

:A system containing a predictive model of itself and/or its environment,
:which allows it to change state at an instant in accord
:with the model's predictions pertaining to a later instant.

To some extent, Rosen's definition of anticipation applies to any system incorporating [[machine learning]].  At issue is how much of a system's behaviour should or indeed can be determined by reasoning over dedicated representations, how much by on-line [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]], and how much must be provided by the system's designers.

==In animals==
Humans can make decisions based on explicit beliefs about the future. More broadly, animals can act in appropriate ways that take future events into account, although they may not necessarily have an explicit cognitive model of the future; evolution may have shaped simpler systemic features that result in adaptive anticipatory behavior in a narrow domain.&lt;ref&gt;Poli, Roberto. "The many aspects of anticipation." Foresight 12.3 (2010): 7-17.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, hibernation is anticipatory behavior, but does not appear to be driven by a cognitive model of the future.&lt;ref&gt;Riegler, A. (2001, June). The role of anticipation in cognition. In AIP Conference Proceedings (Vol. 573, No. 1, pp. 534-541). AIP.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antonio Escobar y Mendoza''' (1589{{snd}}4 July 1669) was the leading [[ethicist]] of his time.

Born at [[Valladolid]] in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], he was educated by [[Jesuits]] before entering this order, aged fifteen.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Escobar y Mendoza, Antonio|volume=9|page=765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He soon became a famous preacher, and his facility was so great that for fifty years he preached daily, and sometimes twice a day. Above all he was a prodigious writer: his collected works comprise eighty-three volumes. Escobar's first literary efforts were [[Latin]] verses in praise of [[Ignatius Loyola]] (1613) and [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]] (1618), but his principal works focus on [[exegesis]] and [[moral theology]]. Of the latter the best-known are ''Summula casuum conscientiae'' (1627), ''Liber theologiae moralis'' (1644) and ''Universae theologiae moralis problemata'' (1652–1666).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; He used to employ the most popular ethical method called [[casuistry]], analyzing real situations rather than strict rules.

Escobar's ''[[Summa|Summula]]'' received criticism from so-called rigorists, especially a [[jansenist]] [[Blaise Pascal]] who wrote ''[[Provincial Letters]]''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin, ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal'', pp 97-100 (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Pascal coined the famous maxim that purity of intention may be a justification of actions which are in themselves contrary to the moral code and to human laws, and its general tendency is to find excuses for human weakness.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Escobar's doctrines were also disapproved by some [[Christian fundamentalism|conservative Catholics]], however he was very appreciated by the mainstream. [[Molière]] subjected Escobar to ridicule in his customary witty style, and Escobar was also the target of criticism by [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]] and [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]]{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}. By the 18th and in the 19th century, in [[France]] the name ''Escobar'' had become synonymous with "adroitness in making the rules of morality harmonize with self-interest".&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Although Escobar is commented as having followed simple habits in his personal life, being a strict adherent to the rules of the [[Society of Jesus]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/507284/Roman-Catholicism/43756/Suppression-of-the-Jesuits www.britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; it was for his zealous efforts to reform the lives of others he was rebuked. It was said that Escobar "purchased Heaven expensively for himself, but gave it away cheaply to others".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YIHb7EmcyCkC&amp;pg=PA495&amp;lpg=PA495&amp;dq=Escobar+purchased+heaven+dearly+for+himself&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Bf5NVsqysq&amp;sig=yL_NytvNGH_n028vQiNizArmV4Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=z7IsVNnuGJDXapvCgsgF&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Escobar%20purchased%20heaven%20dearly%20for%20himself&amp;f=false ''The Gentleman's Magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Escobar died at Valladolid in 1669, following which, ten years later, rigorous [[pope Innocent XI]] publicly condemned his sixty-five sentences, as well as teachings of other ethical authorities, for being ''propositiones laxorum moralistarum''; nonetheless, it was a criticism towards few judgements and not the scholar in general.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, J.N.D. 1986.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5868">[[File:Emily Dickinson daguerreotype.jpg|thumb|[[Emily Dickinson]] in a [[daguerreotype]], circa December 1846 or early 1847]]

"'''Because I could not stop for Death'''" is a [[lyrical poem]] by [[Emily Dickinson]] first published posthumously in ''Poems: Series 1'' in 1890. The persona of Dickinson's poem meets [[Death (personification)|personified Death]]. Death is a gentleman caller who takes a leisurely carriage ride with the speaker to her grave. According to [[Thomas H. Johnson (scholar)|Thomas H. Johnson]]'s [[variorum edition]] of 1955 the number of this poem is 712.

== Summary ==
The poem was published posthumously in 1890 in ''Poems: Series 1'', a collection of Dickinson's poems assembled and edited by her friends [[Mabel Loomis Todd]] and [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]]. The poem was published under the title "The Chariot". It is composed in six [[quatrains]] with the meter alternating between [[iambic tetrameter]] and [[iambic trimeter]]. Stanzas 1, 2, 4, and 6 employ [[end rhyme]] in their second and fourth lines, but some of these are only close rhyme or [[eye rhyme]]. In the third stanza, there is no end rhyme, but "ring" in line 2 rhymes with "gazing" and "setting" in lines 3 and 4 respectively. Internal rhyme is scattered throughout. [[Figures of speech]] include [[alliteration]], [[anaphora (rhetoric)|anaphora]], [[paradox]], and [[personification]]. The poem personifies Death as a gentleman caller who takes a leisurely carriage ride with the poet to her grave. She also personifies immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/Guides2/Dickinson.html |title="Because I could not stop for Death": Study Guide |accessdate=July 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volta (turn) happens in the fourth quatrain. Structurally, the syllables shift from its constant 8-6-8-6 scheme to 6-8-8-6. This parallels with the undertones of the sixth quatrain. The personification of death changes from one of pleasantry to one of ambiguity and morbidity: "Or rather--He passed Us-- / The Dews drew quivering and chill--" (13–14). The imagery changes from its original nostalgic form of children playing and setting suns to Death's real concern of taking the speaker to the afterlife.

&lt;poem&gt;


Because I could not stop for Death —
He kindly stopped for me —
The Carriage held but just Ourselves —
And Immortality.

We slowly drove — He knew no haste
And I had put away
My labor and my leisure too,
For His Civility —

We passed the School, where Children strove
At Recess — in the Ring —
We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain —
We passed the Setting Sun —

Or rather — He passed Us —
The Dews drew quivering and Chill —
For only Gossamer, my Gown —
My Tippet — only Tulle —

We paused before a House that seemed
A Swelling of the Ground —
The Roof was scarcely visible —
The Cornice — in the Ground —

Since then — 'tis Centuries — and yet
Feels shorter than the Day
I first surmised the Horses' Heads
Were toward Eternity —
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
THE CHARIOT

Because I could not stop for Death,
He kindly stopped for me;
The carriage held but just ourselves
And Immortality.

We slowly drove, he knew no haste,
And I had put away
My labor, and my leisure too,
For his civility.

We passed the school where children played,
Their lessons scarcely done;
We passed the fields of gazing grain,
We passed the setting sun.






We paused before a house that seemed
A swelling of the ground;
The roof was scarcely visible,
The cornice but a mound.

Since then 'tis centuries; but each
Feels shorter than the day
I first surmised the horses' heads
Were toward eternity.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Critique==
In 1936 [[Allen Tate]] wrote,
{{quote|[The poem] exemplifies better than anything else [Dickinson] wrote the special quality of her mind ... If the word great means anything in poetry, this poem is one of the greatest in the English language; it is flawless to the last detail. The rhythm charges with movement the pattern of suspended action back of the poem. Every image is precise and, moreover, not merely beautiful, but inextricably fused with the central idea. Every image extends and intensifies every other ... No poet could have invented the elements of [this poem]; only a great poet could have used them so perfectly. Miss Dickinson was a deep mind writing from a deep culture, and when she came to poetry, she came infallibly.&lt;ref&gt;Tate 1936, pp.&amp;nbsp;14–15&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}}}}

==Musical settings==
The poem has been set to music by [[Aaron Copland]] as the twelfth song of his [[song cycle]] ''[[Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson]]''. And again, by [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] as the second movement of his [[choral symphony]] ''[[Harmonium (John Adams)|Harmonium]]'', and also set to music by [[Nicholas J. White]] as a single movement piece for chorus and chamber orchestra. Natalie Merchant and Susan McKeown have created a song of the same name while preserving Dickinson's exact poem in its lyrics.

The "Siedem Razy Kobieta" poster on the wall in Oliver's dining room is from the [[Polish language]] version of the 1967 [[Shirley MacLaine]] film ''[[Woman Times Seven]]''.

==Reception==
On review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 84% based on 150 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Wearing its twee heart on its sleeve, ''Beginners'' explores the depths of modern, multi-generational romance with wit and depth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beginners|title=''Beginners''|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film holds an [[average]] score of 81 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref name="Metacritic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/beginners|title=Beginners|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvin Wilson from the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' wrote, "A lovably quirky comedy-drama with a rhythm all its own."&lt;ref name="Ryll 2014"/&gt; Diego Costa from ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' wrote, "One of the most distinct pleasures of ''Beginners'' is the way it puts together fragments of someone's life — presumably the filmmaker's, although little does it matter — with humility, and without vying for some complete whole."&lt;ref name = "Ryll 2014"/&gt; Lisa Schwarzbaum from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote, "The movie darts, dreams, and sometimes seems to dance. The great Plummer, meanwhile, creates an inspiring, fully rounded man in late bloom, and McGregor responds with a performance to match."&lt;ref name = "Ryll 2014"/&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, saying, "It's a hopeful fable with deep optimism and a cheerful style that kids itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110608/REVIEWS/110609984 | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | title=Beginners | first=Roger | last=Ebert | date=2011-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Debruge from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said the film is "deeply poignant and disarmingly personal".&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/2010/film/reviews/beginners-1117943528 Variety, September 12, 2010: ''Review: ‘Beginners’''] Relinked 2014-06-25&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boothville''' is a heritage-listed [[villa]] and former [[maternity hospital]] at 43 Seventh Avenue, [[Windsor, Queensland|Windsor]], [[City of Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], Australia. It was built from 1887 to {{circa|1900}}. It is also known as Monte Video. It was added to the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 21 October 1992.&lt;ref name=qhr&gt;{{cite QHR|15127|Boothville|600352|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
This two-storeyed brick residence, formerly known as Monte Video, was erected in 1887 for Henry Wallis Glenny, head office manager of the [[Queensland National Bank]] from 1884 to 1892.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Between 1885 and 1887 Glenny acquired several Eildon Hill subdivisions, including the Boothville site. Usually the Queensland National Bank provided residential accommodation for their managers, but in Glenny's case the directors granted him a loan of {{A£|6,500}} on 23 March 1887, to build his own residence. The house may have been designed by former colonial architect [[Francis Drummond Greville Stanley]], who designed a large number of bank offices and residences for the Queensland National Bank, including the head office in [[Brisbane]], erected 1881-85.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In 1892 Glenny retired from the Queensland National Bank, which purchased the house from him. It was rented briefly but mostly remained unoccupied until Walter Vardon Ralston, the new general manager of the bank, and his family occupied the residence in 1896. Initially Ralston rented the house for {{A£|150}} per annum, but later this was waived, and in 1918 he purchased Monte Video from the bank. During the Ralstons' occupancy a single-storeyed timber extension, which housed a large billiard room and beyond that an L-shaped sunroom opening to an eastern porch, aviary and fernery, was added at the rear {{circa|1900}}.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Walter Ralston died in 1920 but his widow remained in the house until 1922.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In 1923 Monte Video was acquired by [[William Bramwell Booth]], son of [[William Booth]] the English founder of the [[Salvation Army]]. He purchased the property on behalf of the organisation, and in May 1924 the Salvation Army Mothers Hospital moved from [[Breakfast Creek]] to Monte Video, which was renamed Boothville.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt; Boothville provided maternity and adoption services for single mothers.&lt;ref name=fc/&gt;

Apart from a small portion of land which was sold in 1925 to P &amp; AE Nelson, and which was bequeathed back to the Salvation Army in 1956, the hospital and grounds have remained part of the Salvation Army Queensland Property Trust since 1933.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

A number of buildings associated with the hospital have been erected on the site since 1924. These include a single-storeyed building which was transported from the hospital's previous site at Breakfast Creek, raised to two-storey height and built in underneath, and a cottage which was relocated from a site in Jephson Street in [[Toowong]] in 1962.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

A brick labour ward was added in the 1970s, and more recently the courtyard between the two rear wings has been covered and concreted. Recently a brick theatre wing has been added off the eastern side of the timber wing.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Salvation Army ceased to operate Boothville as a hospital in 1994&lt;ref name=fc&gt;{{cite web|title=Boothville Mothers Hospital (1924–1994)|url=http://www.findandconnect.gov.au/ref/qld/biogs/QE00717b.htm|website=Find &amp; Connect|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was restored as a private residence. In July 2013, Boothville was sold for $3.9 million.&lt;ref name=cm&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hele|first1=Michelle|title=Historic mansion Boothville sells for $3.9 million|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/historic-mansion-boothville-sells-for-39-million/story-fnihsrf2-1226687548153|accessdate=7 January 2015|work=[[The Courier-Mail]]|date=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Boothville House front.jpg|thumb|upright|Entrance, 2015]]
Located on over {{convert|0.8|ha}} of hilltop land, Boothville is a complex of double and single-storeyed timber and masonry buildings. The original rendered masonry and timber house remains as the main focal building, sited in a commanding position at the crest of the hill.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The main building has a long thin U-shaped plan consisting of, to the south, the original double-storeyed masonry house with now enclosed timber verandahs, its single storeyed rendered masonry service wing to the north-west, and the {{circa|1900}} single-storeyed L-shaped timber addition to the north east. The roof is a series of intersecting pitches dominated by the main roof, which features a flattened central portion bound by a cast iron decorative balustrade with finials.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The front (south) elevation of the original house features a double-storeyed [[bay window]] under a [[gable]] end with carved [[eaves]] [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]], and a projecting timber entrance [[portico]] with three-post [[columns]], shaped rafter ends and stained glass panels. Verandahs to the south and east have been enclosed with weatherboard, and sheeted in to the west. On both the west and eastern elevations, remains of decorative timber detailing to the verandahs can be seen, with arched battening, a herring bone [[frieze]], and timber columns with capitals. The covered walkway to the service wing to the north features cast iron columns with corinthian capitals.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The entrance door which connected the southern portico to the entry vestibule has been replaced, but its cedar surrounds with stained glass remain. The entry vestibule features a rendered masonry archway at the foot of finely carved timber [[stairs]]. To the east is a grand reception room, with an ornate plaster [[cornice]] and richly detailed timber and tiled fireplace. The room has folding cedar doors which once linked it to a parlour which is now a ward. The office to the west has elaborate and finely carved timber cupboards, side board, mirrors and overmantel framing a [[mosaic]] tiled fireplace built into the northern wall. The "service wing" to the rear consists of a large former dining room, a smaller room with a corner fireplace which is now enclosed and which probably functioned as the servants' hall, a large kitchen, and a pantry and scullery, which are now storerooms.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

At half-landing level, the stairs lead to a small timber-lined room and another narrower staircase, which leads to what was probably the servants' bedroom above the dining room. Narrow back stairs also lead from the service wing to this bedroom and from the half-landing level to an upper floor room, which was probably the nursery. The top floor housed four bedrooms and a dressing room, which now serve as wards and a kitchen. The principal rooms feature carved timber mantelpieces, and the southern rooms have excellent views of the inner north-western suburbs and city centre.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The grounds retain remnants of the former garden, terracing and fernery and established trees are located around the boundary. Low masonry fences with cast-iron balustrading define the front terraces. The western side of the house has an old well (which had been sealed over {{circa|1924}} but was re-opened in 1986), and a Garden Chapel. A bitumen [[driveway]] follows the original curve around the front lawn to a semi-circular parking area, formerly the carriage reception area, and continues in the direction of the now demolished coach house at the rear. Much of the brick guttering to the early driveway survives.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Despite modification for its function as a maternity hospital, the essential form of the main building remains intact, as do major internal decorative features. The modifications have not substantially diminished the picturesque quality of the siting of the building, its grounds, and some of its external features.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
Boothville was listed on the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3397">'''Computronium''' is a material hypothesized by  [[Norman Margolus]] and [[Tommaso Toffoli]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] to be used as "[[programmable matter]]", a substrate for [[computer modeling]] of virtually any real object.&lt;ref&gt;Amato, I. (21 Aug. 1991). [https://web.archive.org/web/20040622210059/http://leitl.org/amato.pdf Speculating in Precious Computronium]. ''Science'' 253:856–857.&lt;/ref&gt;

It also refers to a theoretical arrangement of matter that is the best possible form of computing device for that amount of matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singinst.org/upload/CFAI//info/glossary.html#gloss_computronium CFAI glossary: computronium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420013420/http://singinst.org/upload/CFAI/info/glossary.html |date=2010-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the ''[[Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' books, by [[Douglas Adams]], the entire Earth is portrayed as programmable matter; a computer designed to find the question to the [[Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything]].

[[Charles Stross]] uses the term in ''[[Accelerando (book)|Accelerando]]''.

[[Greg Egan]] uses the term in ''[[Zendegi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|id=V6d0WfXuHUsC|title=Zendegi|page=72|text=I have personal plans that require at least one Jovian mass of computronium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Revelation Space]] books, by [[Alastair Reynolds]], a [[neutron star]] called Hades is converted into a massive super computer. The [[neutronium]] substance of Hades would therefore be computronium.

In [[Orion's Arm]] Universe Project computronium is any form of matter which supports computation, including the human brain.

In [[Charles Stross]] and [[Cory Doctorow|Cory Doctorow's]] book, ''[[The Rapture of the Nerds]]'', the Sun is surrounded by [[Dyson sphere]]s of computronium, which host the [[Technological singularity|Singularity]].

The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of [[Tony Stark]] is specifically said to have his cell structure composed of "biological computronium".

In [[The Turing Exception]] [[Singularity Series Book 4]] by [[William Hertling]] Artificial Intelligence utilizes [[Nano Technology]] to create vast fields of solar powered computronium out of existing materials, on Earth during an attack on humanity.  &lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Turing-Exception-Singularity-Book-ebook/dp/B00UGIOCUK/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1435678349&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=william+Hertling | Loc 4430 of 4585 | text=...turning into a vast plain of glittering solar-powered computronium as it grew from dozens to hundreds of miles in diameter.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Destiny (video game)]]'' the most common currency, Glimmer, is described as programmable matter that can be transmuted into nearly anything, similar to computronium.

In ''[[Ashes of the Singularity]]'' planets are converted into a substance called Turinium used to compute uploaded human consciousness and artificial intelligences. 

In [[Hannu Rajaniemi]]'s books "The Quantum Thief", "The Fractal Prince" and "The Causal Angel", planet-sized supercomputers are made of computronium.

In ''[[The Long Earth (series)]]'', a transdimensional travel device is constructed of computronium.

{{refimprove|date=March 2018}}

The '''Deep Ones''' are creatures in the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. The beings first appeared in Lovecraft's novella ''[[The Shadow Over Innsmouth]]'' ([[1931 in literature|1931]]), but were already hinted at in the early short story "[[Dagon (short story)|Dagon]]". The Deep Ones are a race of intelligent ocean-dwelling creatures, approximately human-shaped but with a fishy, froggy appearance. They regularly mate with humans along the coast, creating societies of hybrids.

Numerous Mythos elements are associated with the Deep Ones, including the legendary town of [[Innsmouth]], the undersea city of Y'ha-nthlei, the [[Esoteric Order of Dagon]], and the beings known as Father Dagon and Mother Hydra. After their debut in Lovecraft's tale, the sea-dwelling creatures resurfaced in the works of other authors, especially [[August Derleth]].&lt;ref&gt;The Deep Ones are a popular fixture in Derleth's Cthulhu Mythos fiction, appearing in about half of his tales. ("Derleth's Use of the Words 'Ichthic' and 'Batrachian{{'"}}, ''Crypt of Cthulhu #9''.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Lovecraft provides a description of the Deep Ones in ''The Shadow Over Innsmouth'':

{{quote|text=I think their predominant color was a greyish-green, though they had white bellies. They were mostly shiny and slippery, but the ridges of their backs were scaly. Their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid, while their heads were the heads of fish, with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed.  At the sides of their necks were palpitating gills, and their long paws were webbed. They hopped irregularly, sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four.  I was somehow glad that they had no more than four limbs.  Their croaking, baying voices, clearly used for articulate speech, held all the dark shades of expression which their staring faces lacked ... They were the blasphemous fish-frogs of the nameless design—living and horrible.}}

Lovecraft describes the Deep Ones as a race of undersea-dwelling humanoids whose preferred habitat is deep in the ocean (hence their name). However, despite being primarily marine creatures, they can come to the surface, and can survive on land for extended periods of time. All Deep Ones are immortal; none die except by accident or violence. They are said to serve the beings known as Father Dagon and Mother Hydra, as well as [[Cthulhu]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Price suggests that "Dagon" and Cthulhu are actually the same entity, Dagon being "the closest biblical analogy to the real object of worship of the deep ones"—''The Innsmouth Cycle'', Robert M. Price, ed., p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; They are opposed by mysterious beings known as the Old Gods, whose powerful magic can keep them in check. This detail is one of the vestigial hints that [[August Derleth]] developed as the mostly unnamed Elder Gods.

==Deep One hybrid==

The backstory of ''The Shadow over Innsmouth'' involves a bargain between Deep Ones and humans, in which the aquatic species provides plentiful fishing and gold in the form of strangely formed jewelry. In return, the land-dwellers give [[human sacrifices]] and a promise of "mixing"—the mating of humans with Deep Ones. Although the Deep One hybrid offspring are born with the appearance of a normal human being, the individual will eventually transform into a Deep One, gaining immortality—by default—only when the transformation is complete.

The transformation usually occurs when the individual reaches middle age. As the hybrid gets older, he or she begins to acquire the so-called "Innsmouth Look" as he or she takes on more and more attributes of the Deep One race: the ears shrink, the eyes bulge and become unblinking, the head narrows and gradually goes bald, the skin becomes [[wikt:scabrous|scabrous]] as it changes into scales, and the neck develops folds which later become gills. When the hybrid becomes too obviously non-human, it is hidden away from outsiders. Eventually, however, the hybrid will be compelled to slip into the sea to live with the Deep Ones in one of their undersea cities.

==Father Dagon and Mother Hydra==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cthulhu Mythos]] --&gt;

'''Mother Hydra''' and her consort '''Father Dagon''' are both Deep Ones overgrown after millennia ruling over their lesser brethren. Together with Cthulhu, they form the triad of gods worshiped by the Deep Ones (their names are inspired by [[Dagon]], the [[Ancient Semitic religion|Semitic]] fertility deity, and the [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]] of [[Greek mythology]]).

Mother Hydra is not to be confused with the entity in [[Henry Kuttner]]'s story "Hydra".

==Y'ha-nthlei==

"[[Cyclopean]] and many-columned '''Y'ha-nthlei'''"&lt;ref&gt;Lovecraft, ''The Shadow Over Innsmouth''.&lt;/ref&gt; is the only Deep One city named by Lovecraft.  It is described as a great undersea metropolis below Devil's Reef just off the coast of [[Massachusetts]], near the town of [[Innsmouth]]. Its exact age is not known, but one resident is said to have lived there for 80,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;"For eighty thousand years Pht'thya-l'yi had lived in Y'ha-nthlei". Lovecraft, ''The Shadow Over Innsmouth''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Lovecraft's story, the U.S. government torpedoed Devil's Reef, and Y'ha-nthlei was presumed destroyed, although the ending of the story implies it survived.

The name ''Y'ha-nthlei'' may have been inspired by the [[Lord Dunsany]] character "Yoharneth-Lahai", "the god of little dreams and fancies" who "sendeth little dreams out of PEGANA to please the people of Earth."&lt;ref&gt;Price makes this suggestion in the introduction of Dunsany's "Of Yoharneth-Lahai", ''The Innsmouth Cycle'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors have invented Deep One cities in other parts of the ocean, including Ahu-Y'hloa near [[Cornwall]] and G'll-Hoo, near the volcanic island of [[Surtsey]] off the coast of [[Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Lumley, "Rising With Surtsey".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anders Fager]] has described the city of "Ya' Dich-Gho" as located in the Stockholm skerries. It is accidentally destroyed in 1982 during a Swedish submarine-hunt. At least two surviving Deep Ones live in Stockholm. One of them sells aquarist's supplies. The destruction of Ya' Dich-Gho is described in "When Death Came to Bod Reef"; the city's history in "Herr Goering's Artefact" and the life of the survivors in "Three Weeks of Bliss".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anders Fager|title=Collected Swedish Cults|year=2011|location=Stockholm, Sweden|publisher=Wahlström &amp; Wistrand|isbn=9789146220961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enquiry into the '''evolution of ageing''' aims to explain why survival, reproductive success, and functioning of almost all living organisms decline at old age. Leading hypotheses &lt;ref name="williams" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirkwood|first1=TB|title=Evolution of ageing.|journal=Nature|date=24 November 1977|volume=270|issue=5635|pages=301–4|pmid=593350|doi=10.1038/270301a0|bibcode=1977Natur.270..301K}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that a combination of limited resources, and an increasing risk of death by environmental causes determine an "optimal" level of '''self-maintenance''', i.e. the repair of molecular and cellular level damage that accumulates over time. Allocation of limited resources into such damage repair is traded-off with investment into reproduction, which determines the individual's Darwinian fitness. In consequence, traits that improve an individual's performance in early life are favored by selection, even if the same traits have negative effects late in life, when the individual has already passed on their genes to the next generation.

==History==
[[August Weismann]] was responsible for interpreting and formalizing the mechanisms of [[Darwinian]] evolution in a modern theoretical framework. In 1889, he theorized that ageing was part of life's program because the old need to remove themselves from the theatre to make room for the next generation, sustaining the turnover that is necessary for evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Weismann A.|title=Essays upon heredity and kindred biological problems|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|year=1889}} Work that describes Weismann's theory about making room for the young.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory again has much intuitive appeal, but it suffers from having a [[teleological]] or goal-driven explanation. In other words, a ''purpose'' for ageing has been identified, but not a ''mechanism'' by which that purpose could be achieved. Ageing may have this advantage for the long-term health of the community; but that doesn't explain how individuals would acquire the genes that make them get old and die, or why individuals that had ageing genes would be more successful than other individuals lacking such genes. (In fact, there is every reason to think that the opposite is true: ageing ''decreases'' individual fitness.) Weismann later abandoned his theory.

Theories suggesting that deterioration and death due to ageing are a purposeful result of an organism's evolved design (such as Weismann's "programmed death" theory) are referred to as theories of programmed ageing or adaptive ageing. The idea that the ageing characteristic was selected (an adaptation) because of its deleterious effect was largely discounted for much of the 20th century, but a theoretical model suggests that altruistic ageing could evolve if there is little migration among populations.&lt;ref name=Yang_altruistic_aging&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=Jiang-Nan|title=Viscous populations evolve altruistic programmed ageing in ability conflict in a changing environment|journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research|year=2013|volume=15|pages=527–543|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255170953_Viscous_populations_evolve_altruistic_programmed_aging_in_ability_conflict_in_a_changing_environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutation accumulation==
The first modern theory of [[mammal]] ageing was formulated by [[Peter Medawar]] in 1952. It formed from discussions in the previous decade with [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and the [[selection shadow]] concept. Their idea was that ageing was a matter of neglect.  Nature is a highly competitive place, and almost all animals in nature die before they attain old age. Therefore, there is not much reason why the body should remain fit for the long haul – not much [[selection pressure]] for traits that would maintain viability past the time when most animals would be dead anyway, killed by predators, disease, or accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/the-evolution-of-aging-23651151|title=The Evolution of Aging|last1=Fabian|first1=Daniel|last2=Flatt|first2=Thomas|date=2011|website=[[Scitable]]|publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]] |accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medawar's theory is referred to as ''Mutation Accumulation''. The mechanism of action involves random, detrimental ''germline'' mutations of a kind that happen to show their effect only late in life. Unlike most detrimental mutations, these would not be efficiently weeded out by natural selection. On the grand scale, senescence would just be the summation of deleterious genes that only present in older individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Monaco|first=Thiago Oliveira|last2=Silveira|first2=Paulo Sergio Panse|date=May 2009|title=Aging is not Senescence: A Short Computer Demonstration and Implications for Medical Practice|journal=Clinics (Sao Paulo, Brazil)|volume=64|issue=5|pages=451–457|doi=10.1590/S1807-59322009000500013|issn=1807-5932|pmc=2694250|pmid=19488612}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence they would 'accumulate' and, perhaps, cause all the decline and damage that we associate with ageing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Medawar, P.B.|title=An Unsolved Problem of Biology|publisher=H.K. Lewis|location=London|year=1952}}
Edney, E.B. and Gill, R.W. 1968. Delineates the theory of mutation accumulation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/220281a0|vauthors=Edney EB, Gill RW |title=Evolution of senescence and specific longevity|journal=Nature|volume=220|issue=5164|pages=281–2|date=October 1968|pmid=5684860|bibcode=1968Natur.220..281E}} Further describes theory of mutation accumulation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern genetics science has disclosed a possible problem with the mutation accumulation concept in that it is now known that [[gene]]s are typically [[Gene expression|expressed]] in specific tissues at specific times (see [[regulation of gene expression]]). Expression is controlled by some genetic "program" that activates different genes at different times in the normal growth, development, and day-to-day life of the organism. Defects in genes cause problems ([[genetic disease]]s) when they are not properly expressed when required. A problem late in life suggests that the genetic program called for expression of a gene only in late life and the mutational defect prevented proper expression. This implies existence of a program that called for different gene expression at that point in life. Why, given Medawar's concept, would there exist genes only needed in late life or a program that called for different expression only in late life? The ''maintenance mechanism'' theory (discussed below) avoids this problem.

Medawar's concept suggested that the [[evolution]] process was affected by the age at which an organism was capable of reproducing. Characteristics that adversely affected an organism prior to that age would severely limit the organism's ability to propagate its characteristics and thus would be highly "selected against" by [[natural selection]]. Characteristics that caused the same adverse effects that only appeared well after that age would have relatively little effect on the organism's ability to [[Reproduce|propagate]] and therefore might be allowed by natural selection. This concept fits well with the observed multiplicity of mammal life spans (and differing ages of sexual maturity) and is important to all of the subsequent theories of ageing discussed below.

=== Role of extrinsic mortality ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Young cohorts, not depleted in numbers yet by extrinsic mortality, contribute far more to the next generation than the few remaining older cohorts, so the force of selection against late-acting deleterious mutations, which affect only these few older individuals, is very weak. The mutations may not be selected against, therefore, and may spread over evolutionary time into the population.

The major testable prediction made by this model is that species that have high extrinsic mortality in nature will age more quickly and have shorter [[Intrinsic lifespan|intrinsic lifespans]]. This is borne out among mammals, the best-studied in terms of life history. There is a correlation among mammals between body size and [[Life expectancy|lifespan]], such that larger species live longer than smaller species under controlled/optimum conditions, but there are notable exceptions. For instance, many bats and rodents are of similar size, yet bats live much longer. For instance, the [[little brown bat]], half the size of a [[mouse]], can live 30 years in the wild. A mouse will only live 2–3 years even under optimum conditions. The explanation is that bats have fewer predators, and therefore low extrinsic mortality. More individuals survive to later ages, so the force of selection against late-acting deleterious mutations is stronger. Fewer late-acting deleterious mutations equates to lower mortality and therefore a longer lifespan. Birds are also warm-blooded and are similar in size to many small mammals, yet often live 5–10 times as long. They have less predation pressure than ground-dwelling mammals. [[Seabird|Seabirds]], which, in general, have the fewest predators of all birds, live longest.

When examining the body-size vs. lifespan relationship, one also observes that predatory mammals tend to live longer than prey mammals in a controlled environment, such as a zoo or nature reserve. The explanation for the long lifespans of primates (such as humans, monkeys, and apes) relative to body size is that their intelligence, and often their sociality, help them avoid becoming prey. High position in the [[food chain]], intelligence and cooperativeness all reduce extrinsic mortality in species.

==Antagonistic pleiotropy==
{{main|Antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis}}
Medawar's theory was further developed by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] in 1957, who noted that senescence may be causing many deaths,{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} even if animals are not 'dying of old age.' In the earliest stages of senescence, an animal may lose a bit of its speed, and then predators will seize it first, while younger animals flee successfully. Or its immune system may decline, and it becomes the first to die of a new infection. Nature is such a competitive place, said Williams, (turning Medawar's argument back at him), that even a little bit of senescence can be fatal; hence natural selection does indeed care; ageing isn't cost-free.

Williams's objection has turned out to be valid: Modern studies of demography in natural environments demonstrate that senescence does indeed make a substantial contribution to the death rate in nature. These observations cast doubt on Medawar's theory. Another problem with Medawar's theory became apparent in the late 1990s, when genomic analysis became widely available. It turns out that the genes that cause ageing are not random mutations; rather, these genes form tight-knit families that have been around as long as [[eukaryotic]] life. [[Baker's yeast]], [[worm]]s, [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]], and [[mice]] all share some of the same ageing genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Guarente L, Kenyon C |title=Genetic pathways that regulate ageing in model organisms|journal=Nature|volume=408|issue=6809|pages=255–62|date=November 2000|pmid=11089983 |doi=10.1038/35041700|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v408/n6809/abs/408255a0.html}} Shows similarities between ageing genes in model organisms.&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams (1957) proposed his own theory, called antagonistic ''[[pleiotropy]]''. Pleiotropy means one gene that has two or more effects on the [[phenotype]]. In antagonistic pleiotropy, one of these effects is beneficial and another is detrimental. In essence, this refers to genes that offer benefits early in life, but exact a cost later on. If evolution is a race to have the most offspring the fastest, then enhanced early fertility could be selected even if it came with a price tag that included decline and death later on.&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2406060|author=Williams, G.C.|title=Pleiotropy, natural selection and the evolution of senescence|journal=Evolution|volume=11|issue=4|pages=398–411|year=1957|format=PDF|url=http://www.telomere.org/Downloads/Williams_searchable.pdf|jstor=2406060|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713071204/http://www.telomere.org/Downloads/Williams_searchable.pdf|archivedate=2006-07-13|df=}} Paper in which Williams describes his theory of antagonistic pleiotropy.&lt;/ref&gt; Because ageing was a side effect of necessary functions, Williams considered any alteration of the ageing process to be "impossible."

Antagonistic pleiotropy is a prevailing theory today, but this is largely by default, and not because the theory has been well verified. In fact, experimental biologists have looked for the genes that cause ageing, and since about 1990 the technology has been available to find them efficiently. Of the many ageing genes that have been reported, some seem to enhance fertility early in life, or to carry other benefits. But there are other ageing genes for which no such corresponding benefit has been identified. This is not what Williams predicted. This may be thought of as partial validation of the theory, but logically it cuts to the core premise: that genetic trade-offs are the root cause of ageing.

Another difficulty with antagonistic pleiotropy and other theories that suppose that ageing is an adverse side effect of some beneficial function is that the linkage between adverse and beneficial effects would need to be ''rigid'' in the sense that the evolution process would not be able to evolve a way to accomplish the benefit without incurring the adverse effect even over a very long time span. Such a rigid relationship has not been experimentally demonstrated and, in general, evolution is able to independently and individually adjust myriad organism characteristics.

In breeding experiments, [[Michael R. Rose]] selected [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] for long lifespan. Based on antagonistic pleiotropy, Rose expected that this would surely reduce their fertility. His team found that they were able to breed flies that lived more than twice as long as the flies they started with, but to their surprise, the long-lived, inbred flies actually laid more eggs than the short-lived flies. This was another setback for pleiotropy theory, though Rose maintains it may be an experimental artefact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2410382|author1=Leroi, A.M. |author2=Chippindale, A.K. |author3=Rose, M.R. |title=Long-term laboratory evolution of a genetic life-history tradeoff in ''Drosophila melanogaster''. 1. The role of genotype-by-environment interaction|journal=Evolution|volume=48|issue=4|pages=1244–57|year=1994|jstor=2410383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disposable soma theory==
{{main|Disposable soma theory of aging}}
A third mainstream theory of ageing, the '[[Disposable soma theory of aging|'Disposable soma'' theory]], proposed in 1977 by [[Thomas Kirkwood]], presumes that the body must budget the amount of energy available to it. The body uses food energy for metabolism, for reproduction, and for repair and maintenance. With a finite supply of food, the body must compromise, and do none of these things quite as well as it would like. It is the compromise in allocating energy to the repair function that causes the body gradually to deteriorate with age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/270301a0|author=Kirkwood TB|title=Evolution of ageing|journal=Nature|volume=270|issue=5635|pages=301–4|date=November 1977|pmid=593350 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v270/n5635/abs/270301a0.html|bibcode=1977Natur.270..301K}} Origin of the disposable soma theory.&lt;/ref&gt; A caveat to the disposable soma theory suggests that time, rather than energy, is a limiting resource that may be critical to an organism. The concept is that each organism must reproduce in an optimal period in order to ensure the greatest chance of success for the offspring. This optimal period is dictated by the ecological niche of the organism but in essence, it limits the time that any given organism can devote to growth and development prior to bearing offspring. Thus, developmental rate and gestational rate are subject to evolutionary pressure. The need to accelerate gestation limits the time allocated to damage repair at the cellular level, resulting in an accumulation of damage and a decreased lifespan relative to organisms with longer gestation. This concept stems from a comparative analysis of genomic stability in mammalian cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lorenzini, A, Stamato, T. Sell, C.|title=The disposable soma theory revisited: Time as a resource in the theories of aging|volume=15|year=2011|doi=10.4161/cc.10.22.18302|journal=Cell Cycle|pages=3853–3856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are arguments against the disposable soma theory. The theory clearly predicts that a shortage of food should make the compromise more severe all around; but in many experiments, ongoing since 1930, it has been demonstrated that animals live longer when fed substantially less than controls. This is the [[caloric restriction]] (CR) effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Weindruch, R. |author2=Walford, R.L. |title=The Retardation of Aging and Disease by Dietary Restriction|publisher=Thomas|location=Springfield, IL |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/019262339602400618|author=Weindruch R|title=The Retardation of Aging by Caloric Restriction: Studies in Rodents and Primates|journal=Toxicologic Pathology|volume=24|issue=6|pages=742–5|year=1996|url=http://tpx.sagepub.com/content/24/6/742.short |pmid=8994305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Masoro EJ|title=Overview of caloric restriction and ageing|journal=Mech. Ageing Dev.|volume=126|issue=9|pages=913–22|date=September 2005|pmid=15885745|doi=10.1016/j.mad.2005.03.012|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0047-6374(05)00078-3}} Overview of caloric restriction and aging.&lt;/ref&gt; and it cannot be easily reconciled with the Disposable Soma theory. Though by decreasing energy expenditure the damage generated (by [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]], for instance) is expected to be reduced and the total energy budget might indeed be reduced, but the investment in repair function might still be relatively the same. But dietary restriction has not been shown to increase lifetime reproductive success (fitness), because when food availability is lower, reproductive output is also lower. So CR does thus not completely dismiss disposable soma theory.

According to this concept living systems evolve into a state of [[highly optimized tolerance]] promoting traits beneficial for survival and fitness at the cost of fragilities driving the ageing phenotype. The view is compatible with aspects of the antagonistic pleiotropy and the disposable soma theory, but offers additional mechanisms rooted in [[complex systems]] theory.

==Other problems with the classical ageing theories==
A raised criticism for all three mainstream theories based on classical evolutionary process concepts is the potential existence of 'deliberate' metabolic mechanisms that work to promote death.

One is ''[[apoptosis]]'', or programmed cell death. Apoptosis is responsible for killing infected cells, cancerous cells, and cells that are simply in the wrong place during development. There are clear benefits to apoptosis, so the existence of apoptosis isn't a problem for evolutionary theory. The problem is that apoptosis seems to ramp up late in life and kill healthy cells, causing weakness and degeneration  {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. And, paradoxically, apoptosis has been observed as a kind of 'altruistic suicide' in colonies of [[yeast]] under stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gourlay CW, Du W, Ayscough KR |title=Apoptosis in yeast--mechanisms and benefits to a unicellular organism|journal=Mol. Microbiol.|volume=62|issue=6|pages=1515–21|date=December 2006|pmid=17087770|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2006.05486.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0950-382X&amp;date=2006&amp;volume=62&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=1515}}&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to be a direct hint that senescence arose because it conferred a direct evolutionary advantage, rather than some kind of side effect of genes that have other evolutionary advantages (pleiotropy).

A second 'deliberate' mechanism is called ''replicative senescence'' or cellular [[senescence]]. Metaphorically, a cell may be said to 'count' (with its ''[[telomeres]]'') the number of times that it has divided, and after a set number of replications, it languishes and dies. It has been proposed that this mechanism evolved to suppress cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The molecular biology of cancer?|quote=This has resulted in speculation that cellular senescence evolved as a cancer suppression mechanism at a time when the life expectancy for humans was far shorter than it is today.|first1= M.|last1=Blasco|first2=S.|last2=Pelengaris|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-1814-9|oclc=263712202|date=2006-02-28|page=285}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Does senescence function as an anti-neoplastic mechanism in vivo?|quote=Senescence has been postulated to serve as a tumor-suppressing mechanism that is responsible for limiting the replicative potential of pre-neoplastic cells.

More strictly, cells cannot 'count' the number of times they have divided {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. Telomeres are not a counting mechanism {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}, though they may be used to indicate the number of times a particular [[chromosome]] has been replicated. Cellular processes for genetic material [[DNA replication|replication]] occur in both directions along [[DNA]], 5' to 3' and on the other strand, 3' to 5'. As the 3' or 5' end is impossible for [[DNA polymerase]] to grab at the 1 base pair mark, a handful of basepairs (10-15) are cut off each replication. Over time, this cutting short of the DNA results in no telomeres, and the cell is unable to replicate that chromosome without cutting into genes.

The dilemma is that classical evolutionary theory says that what is maintained in a lineage is that which ensures the viability of an organism and its offspring. Ageing can only cut off an individual's capacity to reproduce. So, according to classical theory, ageing could ''only'' evolve as a side effect, or [[epiphenomenon]] of selection. The disposable soma theory and antagonistic pleiotropy theory are examples in which a compensating individual benefit, compatible with classical [[evolution]] theory (See [[neo-Darwinism]]) is proposed. Nevertheless, there is accumulated evidence that ageing looks like an adaptation in its own right, selected for its own sake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mitteldorf, J.|title=Ageing selected for its own sake|journal=Evol. Ecol. Res.|volume=6|pages=937–53|year=2004|format=PDF |url=http://mathforum.org/~josh/4OwnSake.pdf}} On the tension between experimental data and evolutionary theory.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bredesen DE|title=The non-existent aging program: how does it work?|journal=Aging Cell|volume=3|issue=5|pages=255–9|date=October 2004 |pmid=15379848|doi=10.1111/j.1474-9728.2004.00121.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=1474-9718&amp;date=2004&amp;volume=3&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=255}} More on the tension between experiment and theory.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Semelparous]] organisms and others that die suddenly following reproduction (e.g. [[salmon]], [[octopus]], marsupial mouse ([[brown antechinus]]), etc.) also represent instances of organisms who incorporate a lifespan-limiting feature. Sudden death is more obviously an instance of programmed death or a purposeful adaptation than gradual ageing. Biological elements clearly associated with evolved mechanisms such as [[hormone]] signalling have been identified in the death mechanisms of organisms such as the [[octopus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wodinsky, J.|title=Hormonal Inhibition of Feeding and Death in Octopus: Control by Optic Gland Secretion|journal=Science|volume=198|issue=4320|pages=948–51|year=1977|pmid=17787564|doi=10.1126/science.198.4320.948|bibcode=1977Sci...198..948W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of new evolution concepts on ageing theories==
At the time most of the non-programmed ageing theories were developed, there was very little scientific disagreement with classical theories (i.e. [[Neo-Darwinism]]) regarding the process of evolution. However, in addition to suicidal behaviour of [[semelparous]] species (not handled by the classical ageing theories) other apparently individually adverse organism characteristics such as [[altruism]] and [[sexual reproduction]] were observed. In response to these ''other'' conflicts, adjustments to classical theory were proposed:
*Various '''[[group selection]]''' theories (beginning in 1962) propose that benefit to a group could offset the individually adverse nature of a characteristic such as [[altruism]]. The same principle could be applied to characteristics that limited life span and theories proposing group benefits for limited lifespans appeared.
*'''[[Evolvability]]''' theories (beginning in 1995) suggest that a characteristic that increased an organism's ability to evolve could also offset an individual disadvantage and thus be evolved and retained. Multiple evolvability benefits of a limited lifespan were subsequently proposed in addition to those originally proposed by Weismann.

===Ageing theories based on group selection===
Group selection is often criticized to be too slow to happen in real biology. However, Jiang-Nan Yang&lt;ref name=Yang_altruistic_aging/&gt; recently showed with an [[individual-based model]] that the evolution of altruistic ageing occurs under fairly general conditions by kin/group selection. Group selection can be based on population viscosity (limited offspring dispersal, first proposed by Hamilton (1964) for kin selection) that is widely present in natural populations. This population structure builds a continuum between individual selection, kin selection, kin group selection and group selection without a clear boundary for each level. Although early theoretical models by D.S. Wilson et al. (1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=D.S. |author2=Pollock, G.B. |author3=Dugatkin, L.A|title=Can altruism evolve in purely viscous populations?|journal=Evol. Ecol.|year=1992|volume=6|pages=331–341|doi=10.1007/bf02270969}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Taylor (1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=P.D.|title=Altruism in viscous populations – an inclusive fitness model.|journal=Evol. Ecol.|year=1992|volume=6|pages=352–356|doi=10.1007/bf02270971}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that pure population viscosity cannot lead to cooperation/altruism because of the exact cancelling out of the benefit of kin cooperation and the cost of kin competition, this exact cancelling out also suggests that any additional benefit of local cooperation would be sufficient for the evolution of cooperation.&lt;ref name=Yang_altruistic_aging/&gt; Mitteldorf and D.S. Wilson (2000) later showed that if the population is allowed to fluctuate, then local populations can temporarily store the benefit of local cooperation and promote the evolution of altruism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mitteldorf|first=Joshua|author2=Wilson, D.S.|title=Population viscosity and the evolution of altruism|journal=J. Theor. Biol.|year=2000|volume=204|pages=481–496|url=http://web.pdx.edu/~jeff/group_sel_workshop/mitteldorf_wilson.pdf|doi=10.1006/jtbi.2000.2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By assuming individual differences in adaptations, Yang (2013) further showed that the benefit of local altruism can be stored in the form of offspring quality and thus promote the evolution of altruistic ageing even if the population does not fluctuate, this is because local competition among the young will result in an increased average local inherited fitness of survived progenies after the elimination of the less adapted by natural selection, since the young do not have strong age-associated abilities and have to depend more on inherited abilities to compete.&lt;ref name=Yang_altruistic_aging/&gt; In Yang (2013)'s model, altruistic ageing is stabilized by higher-level selection instead of just kin selection.&lt;ref name=Yang_altruistic_aging/&gt;

Mitteldorf&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mitteldorf, J.|title=Chaotic population dynamics and the evolution of ageing: proposing a demographic theory of senescence|journal=Evol. Ecol.

Populations in nature are subject to boom and bust cycles. Often overpopulation can be punished by famine or by epidemic. Either one could wipe out an entire population. Senescence is a means by which a species can 'take control' of its own death rate, and level out the boom-bust cycles. This story may be more plausible than the Weismann hypothesis as a mechanistic explanation, because it addresses the question of how [[group selection]] can be rapid enough to compete with individual selection.

Libertini&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Libertini, G.|title=Empirical evidence for various evolutionary hypotheses on species demonstrating increasing mortality with increasing chronological age in the wild|journal=Scientific World Journal|volume=8|pages=182–93|year=2008|pmid=18301820 |doi=10.1100/tsw.2008.36}}&lt;/ref&gt; also suggests benefits for adaptive ageing.

Inversely, within a ''Negative Senescence Theory'' R.D. Lee (similarly J.W.

===Ageing theories based on evolvability===
Goldsmith&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Goldsmith TC|title=Aging, evolvability, and the individual benefit requirement; medical implications of aging theory controversies|journal=J. Theor. Biol.|volume=252|issue=4|pages=764–8|date=June 2008|pmid=18396295|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.02.035 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022-5193(08)00101-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that in addition to increasing the generation rate, and thereby evolution rate, a limited lifespan improves the evolution process by limiting the ability of older individuals to dominate the [[gene pool]]. Further, the evolution of characteristics such as intelligence and immunity may specially require a limited lifespan because otherwise acquired characteristics such as experience or exposure to pathogens would tend to override the selection of the beneficial inheritable characteristic. An older and more experienced, but less intelligent animal would have a fitness advantage over a younger, more intelligent animal except for the effects of ageing.

Skulachev&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Skulachev VP|title=Aging is a specific biological function rather than the result of a disorder in complex living systems: biochemical evidence in support of Weismann's hypothesis|journal=Biochemistry Mosc.|volume=62|issue=11|pages=1191–5|date=November 1997|pmid=9467841}}&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that programmed ageing assists the evolution process by providing a gradually increasing challenge or obstacle to survival and reproduction, and therefore enhancing the selection of beneficial characteristics. In this sense, ageing would act in a manner similar to that of mating rituals that take the form of contests or trials that must be overcome in order to mate (another individually adverse observation). This suggests an advantage of gradual ageing over sudden death as a means of lifespan regulation.

Weissmann's 1889 ageing theory was essentially an [[evolvability]] theory. Ageing or otherwise purposely limited lifespan helps evolution by freeing resources for younger, and therefore, presumably better-adapted individuals.

Yang (2013)'s model&lt;ref name=Yang_altruistic_aging/&gt; is also based on mechanisms of evolvability. Ageing accelerates the accumulation of novel adaptive genes in local populations. However, Yang changed the terminology of "evolvability" into "genetic creativity" throughout his paper to facilitate the understanding of how ageing can have a shorter-term benefit than the word "evolvability" would imply.

Lenart and Vašku (2016) &lt;ref name="LenartBienertová-Vašků2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lenart|first1=Peter|last2=Bienertová-Vašků|first2=Julie|title=Keeping up with the Red Queen: the pace of aging as an adaptation|journal=Biogerontology|year=2016|issn=1389-5729|doi=10.1007/s10522-016-9674-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also invoked evolvability as the main mechanism driving evolution of aging. However, they proposed that even though the actual rate of aging can be an adaptation the aging itself is inevitable. In other words, evolution can change speed of aging but some aging no matter how slow will always occur.

==Mechanism==
If organisms purposely limit their lifespans via ageing or semelparous behaviour, the associated evolved mechanisms could be very complex, just as mechanisms that provide for mentation, vision, digestion, or other biological function are typically very complex. Such a mechanism could involve hormones, signalling, sensing of external conditions, and other complex functions typical of evolved mechanisms. Such complex mechanisms could explain all of the observations of ageing and semelparous behaviours as described below.

It is typical for a given biological function to be controlled by a single mechanism that is capable of sensing the germane conditions and then executing the necessary function  {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. The mechanism signals all the systems and tissues that need to respond to that function by means of organism-wide signals ([[hormone]]s). If ageing is indeed a biological function, we would expect all or most manifestations of ageing to be similarly controlled by a common mechanism. Various observations (listed below) indeed suggest the existence of a common control mechanism.

It is also typical for biological functions to be modulated by or synchronized to external events or conditions. The [[circadian rhythm]] and synchronization of mating behaviour to planetary cues are examples. In the case of ageing seen as a biological function, the [[calorie restriction|caloric restriction effect]] may well be an example of the ageing function being modulated in order to optimize organism lifespan in response to external conditions. Temporary extension of lifespan under famine conditions would aid in group survival because extending lifespan, combined with less-frequent reproduction, would reduce the resources required to maintain a given population.{{Dubious|date=March 2018}}

Theories to the effect that ageing results by default (mutation accumulation) or is an adverse side effect of some other function are logically much more limited and suffer when compared to empirical evidence of complex mechanisms. The choice of ageing theory therefore is logically essentially determined by one's position regarding evolutionary processes, and some theorists reject programmed ageing based entirely on evolutionary process considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olshansky|first1=SJ|last2=Hayflick|first2=L|last3=Carnes|first3=BA|title=No truth to the fountain of youth |journal=Scientific American|volume=286|issue=6|pages=92–5|year=2002|pmid=12030096|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0602-92|bibcode=2002SciAm.286f..92O}} Article stating that programmed ageing is "impossible" because of "the way evolution works."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maintenance theories===
It is generally accepted that deteriorative processes (wear, other molecular damage) exist and that living organisms have mechanisms to counter deterioration. Wounds heal; dead cells are replaced; claws regrow.

A non-programmed theory of mammal ageing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Holliday R|title=Aging is no longer an unsolved problem in biology |journal=Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci.|volume=1067|pages=1–9|date=May 2006|pmid=16803964 |doi=10.1196/annals.1354.002|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0077-8923&amp;date=2006&amp;volume=1067&amp;spage=1|bibcode=2006NYASA1067....1H}}&lt;/ref&gt; that fits with classical evolution theory and Medawar's concept is that different mammal species possess different capabilities for maintenance and repair. Longer-lived species possess many mechanisms for offsetting damage due to causes such as oxidation, telomere shortening, and other deteriorative processes that are each more effective than those of shorter-lived species. Shorter-lived species, having earlier ages of sexual maturity, had less need for longevity and thus did not evolve or retain the more-effective repair mechanisms. Damage therefore accumulates more rapidly, resulting in earlier manifestations and shorter lifespan. Since there are a wide variety of ageing manifestations that appear to have very different causes, it is likely that there are many different maintenance and repair functions.

A corresponding programmed maintenance theory based on [[evolvability]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Goldsmith, T.|title=Mammal aging: active and passive mechanisms|journal=Journal of Bioscience Hypotheses|volume=2|issue=2|pages=59–64|year=2009|doi=10.1016/j.bihy.2008.12.002|url=}} Article compares programmed and non-programmed maintenance theories of ageing in light of empirical evidence.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the repair mechanisms are in turn controlled by a common control mechanism capable of sensing conditions, such as caloric restriction, and also capable of producing the specific lifespan needed by the particular species. In this view, the differences between short- and long-lived species are in the control mechanisms, as opposed to each individual maintenance mechanism.

===DNA damage theory===
{{main|DNA damage theory of aging}}

The [[DNA damage theory of aging]] is a prominent explanation for aging at the molecular level.  This theory postulates that DNA damage is ubiquitous in the biological world and is the primary cause of aging.&lt;ref name="pmid7031747"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gensler HL, Bernstein H |title=DNA damage as the primary cause of aging |journal=Q Rev Biol |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=279–303 |year=1981 |pmid=7031747 |doi= 10.1086/412317|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consistent with this theory, genetic elements that regulate [[DNA repair|repair of DNA damage]] in [[somatic cell]]s were proposed to have pleiotropic effects that are beneficial during early development but allow deleterious consequences later in life.&lt;ref name="pmid7031747" /&gt;&lt;ref name= Bernsteinbook&gt;Bernstein C, Bernstein H.

===Evidence===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}

* Complex programmed death mechanisms exist in semelparous species (e.g. octopus), including hormone signalling, nervous system involvement, etc. If a limited lifespan is generally useful as predicted by the programmed ageing theories, it would be unusual for an octopus to possess a more complex mechanism for accomplishing that function than a mammal.
* "Ageing genes" with no other apparent function. However to date no evidence that such genes exist has been found. 
* Caloric restriction effect: ''reduction'' of available resources ''increases'' lifespan. This behavior has a plausible group benefit in enhancing the survival of a group under famine conditions and also suggests common control.
* [[Progeria]] and [[Werner syndrome]] are both [[Genetic disorder#Single gene disorder|single-gene genetic diseases]] that cause acceleration of many or most symptoms of ageing. The fact that a single gene malfunction can cause similar effects on many different manifestations of ageing suggests a common mechanism. However, both genes affected influence DNA stability and so can be explained by stochastic theories of ageing that attribute ageing to accumulation of DNA damage. 
*Although mammal lifespans vary over an approximately 100:1 range, manifestations of ageing (cancer, arthritis, weakness, sensory deficit, etc.) are similar in different species. This suggests that the deterioration mechanisms and corresponding maintenance mechanisms operate over a short period (less than the lifespan of a short-lived mammal). All the mammals therefore need all the maintenance mechanisms. This suggests that the difference between mammals is in a control mechanism or repair efficiency. 
*Lifespan varies greatly among otherwise very similar species (e.g. different varieties of [[salmon]] 3:1, different fish 600:1) suggesting that relatively few genes control lifespan and that relatively minor changes to [[genotype]] could cause major differences in lifespan. This could be consistent with a common control mechanism for lifespan but note that this does not in itself provide evidence for programmed aging but is equally consistent with traditional theories.

==Problems with programmed ageing theories==
Contrary to the theory of programmed death by ageing, individuals from a single species usually live much longer in a protected (laboratory, domestic, civilized) environment than in their wild (natural) environment, reaching ages that would be otherwise practically impossible. Also, in the majority of species, there doesn't exist any critical age after which death rates change dramatically, as intended by the programmed death by ageing{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}, but the age-dependence of death rates is very smooth and monotonic. However, as mentioned above, V.P. Skulachev&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skulachev|first=Vladimir P.|title=The programmed death phenomena, ageing, and the Samurai law of biology|journal=Experimental Gerontology|year=2001|volume=36|pages=995–1024|doi=10.1016/s0531-5565(01)00109-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; explained that a process of gradual ageing has the advantage of facilitating selection for useful traits by allowing old individuals with a useful trait to live longer. It is also easy to imagine that animals with gradual ageing will live longer in a protected environment.

The death rates at extreme old ages start to slow down, which is the opposite of what would be expected if death by ageing was programmed. From an individual-selection point of view, having genes that would not result in a programmed death by ageing would displace genes that cause programmed death by ageing, as individuals would produce more offspring in their longer lifespan and they could increase the survival of their offspring by providing longer parental support.&lt;ref name=Garilov&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gavrilov|first1=Leonid A|first2=Natalia S.|last2=Gavrilova|title=Evolutionary Theories of Aging and Longevity|journal=TheScientificWorldJournal|date=7 February 2002|issue=2|pages=339–356|doi=10.1100/tsw.2002.96|citeseerx=10.1.1.3.4950|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biogerontology considerations==
Theories of ageing affect efforts to understand and find treatments for age-related conditions (see [[Biogerontology#Biogerontology|biogerontology]]):
*Those who believe in the idea that ageing is an unavoidable side effect of some necessary function (antagonistic pleiotropy or disposable soma theories) logically tend to believe that attempts to delay ageing would result in unacceptable side effects to the necessary functions. Altering ageing is therefore "impossible",&lt;ref name="williams"/&gt; and study of ageing mechanisms is of only academic interest.
*Those believing in default theories of multiple maintenance mechanisms tend to believe that ways might be found to enhance the operation of some of those mechanisms. Perhaps they can be assisted by anti-oxidants or other agents.
*Those who believe in programmed ageing suppose that ways might be found to interfere with the operation of the part of the ageing mechanism that appears to be common to multiple symptoms, essentially "slowing down the clock" and delaying multiple manifestations. Such effect might be obtained by fooling a sense function. One such effort is an attempt to find a "mimetic" that would "mime" the anti-ageing effect of [[calorie restriction]] without having to actually radically restrict diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Chen D, Guarente L |title=SIR2: a potential target for calorie restriction mimetics|journal=Trends Mol Med|volume=13|issue=2|pages=64–71|date=February 2007|pmid=17207661|doi=10.1016/j.molmed.2006.12.004 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1471-4914(06)00286-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Expediting''' is a concept in [[purchasing]] and [[project management]] for securing the quality and timely delivery of goods and components.&lt;ref&gt;[http://procurementguide.com/tag/field-expediting The Procurement Expeditor – Its Roles And Responsibilities]&lt;/ref&gt;

The procurement department or an external expeditor controls the progress of manufacturing at the supplier concerning quality, packing, conformity with standards and set timelines. Thus the expeditor makes sure that the required goods arrive at the appointed date in the agreed quality at the agreed location.

==Purpose==

Expediting is especially needed in large scale [[project]]s, for example, when a [[ship building]] or a [[refinery]] is erected, because of a delay caused by late delivery or inferior quality will get very expensive and could lead to unsatisfied clients, thus the loss of a project. To save these unnecessary costs and minimize potential risks, the supplier and customer may agree on the use of a third party expeditor. These are experts from companies specializing in this field who keep track of the deadlines, supervise progress on site and check whether the components are properly packed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuv.com/en/corporate/business_customers/materials_testing_and_inspection/supply_chain_services/expediting_services/expediting_services.jsp Expediting for industrial projects. Retrieved on Sep. 18, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; After inspection they notify the involved parties and banks about their findings; if everything is as agreed the bank will initiate the transfer of the price of the goods to the supplier. In this way, the [[Distributor (business)|supplier]] secures his [[liquidity]] as he is paid immediately when the components leave his factory ([[letter of credit]]) and the customer/bank knows that the goods will be delivered correctly.
Expediting is relevant for many industries, such as the oil and gas industry, the general [[energy]] industry and the [[infrastructure]] industry.

Expediting exists in several levels:

* [[Production control]]: The expeditor inspects the factory whether the production is up to the standards of the country the goods are destined for. This is especially necessary for food or engineering equipment like power plant components. He or she controls as well whether the regular audits for [[ISO 9001]] etc. have been made.
* [[Quality control]]: The components are tested whether they function as required and whether they are made to the measurements and standards of the customer. A part of this quality control can be the testing for compliance with standards of the destination country, e.g. [[ASME]].
* [[Packaging and labeling|Packing]]/transport survey: This is the lowest and most used level of expediting, as the goods are only counted and the packing is controlled whether it will withstand the adversities of transport ([[pre-shipment inspection]]).
* [[Project management]]: At a large-scale project, not only goods are controlled. The expeditor also keeps an eye on the deadlines and milestones of the project and whether the supplier will be on time. This way he or she monitors the crucial procurement parts of the project.

As the different levels of expediting require different skills, specialists and laboratories, many third party expeditors specialize in only one or several of these levels, while few offer expediting services on all levels.

Larger companies normally have their own expeditors who can perform all four levels. Third parties then are only used when in-house capacity is overstretched or a neutral third party is needed. But In case of some big companies if the no. of project running same time, Big companies use third party expeditors also.

Most of the time companies use third party inspector expeditors who are responsible for inspection of critical items as well as expediting. In strict quality control conditions, those quality inspector expeditors will give importance to quality work, rather than to expediting work, which may not be a useful technique to get expediting work completed.

==Field expediting==
Field expediting provides clients with a comprehensive review of the precise standing of their order and any on site action to rectify any potential problem areas. Field expediting means the inspection and control of the expeditor on site. This gives clients a comprehensive review of the exact current status of their order and an educated projection of the future planning and status. Furthermore, while being on site, experts for expediting can identify possible problems and bottlenecks that could lead to potential delays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inspection.com.tr/Vendor_expediting.html Field Expediting]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Desk expediting==
Desk expediting is also known as telephone expediting. It is an important tool for producing companies to monitor order progress with manufacturers. Especially at milestone of a project, desk expediting can be helpful to check whether the project is still within the agreed schedule. Although desk expediting is a quick and easy way to be informed about the current status of a project, it should always be conducted in combination with field expediting to securely verify the actual status.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.velosi.com/services/21/2.php?selected_box=pro_qual_services Desk expediting]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Telephone expediting==
Desk/Phone expediting provides a valuable tool for monitoring the progress of orders with a manufacturer. Contact is established at specific milestones within the order fabrication method and a brief outline of status standing obtained throughout the following conversation. associate experienced expeditor will very quickly assess whether the order is progressing consistent with plan or whether alternative measures are needed to verify and presumably improve the order progress. desk / phone expediting is best used as a tool to supplement field expediting. it's additionally a helpful approach of making the vendor aware that delays on the order won't be accepted by their shopper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inspection.com.tr/Vendor_expediting.html Telephone Expediting]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29422">The '''generalized distributive law (GDL)''' is a generalization of the [[distributive property]] which gives rise to a general [[message passing]] algorithm.&lt;ref name=GenDistLaw&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aji|first=S.M.|author2=McEliece, R.J.|title=The generalized distributive law|journal=Information Theory, IEEE Transactions on|date=Mar 2000|volume=46|issue=2|pages=325–343|doi=10.1109/18.825794|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=825794&amp;isnumber=17872}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a synthesis of the work of many authors in the [[information theory]], [[digital communications]], [[signal processing]], [[statistics]], and [[artificial intelligence]] communities. The law and algorithm were introduced in a semi-tutorial by Srinivas M. Aji and [[Robert McEliece|Robert J. McEliece]] with the same title.&lt;ref name=GenDistLaw /&gt;

==Introduction==

''"The distributive law in mathematics is the law relating the operations of multiplication and addition, stated symbolically, &lt;math&gt; a*(b + c) = a*b + a*c&lt;/math&gt;; that is, the monomial factor &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is distributed, or separately applied, to each term of the binomial factor &lt;math&gt; b + c &lt;/math&gt;, resulting in the product &lt;math&gt; a*b + a*c &lt;/math&gt;"'' -  Britannica&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=distributive law|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/166204/distributive-law|work=Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As it can be observed from the definition, application of distributive law to an arithmetic expression reduces the number of operations in it. In the previous example the total number of operations reduced from three (two multiplications and an addition in &lt;math&gt; a*b + a*c &lt;/math&gt;) to two (one multiplication and one addition in &lt;math&gt; a*(b + c) &lt;/math&gt;). Generalization of distributive law leads to a large family of [[fast algorithms]]. This includes the [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]] and [[Viterbi algorithm]].

This is explained in a more formal way in the example below:

&lt;math&gt;\alpha(a,\, b) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \displaystyle\sum \limits_{c,d,e \in A} f(a, \, c, \, b) \, g(a, \, d, \, e) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; are real-valued functions, &lt;math&gt;a,b,c,d,e \in A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|A|=q&lt;/math&gt; (say)

Here we are "marginalizing out" the independent variables (&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;) to obtain the result. When we are calculating the computational complexity, we can see that for each &lt;math&gt;q^{2}&lt;/math&gt; pairs of &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;, there are &lt;math&gt;q^{3}&lt;/math&gt; terms due to the triplet &lt;math&gt;(c,d,e)&lt;/math&gt; which needs to take part in the evaluation of &lt;math&gt;\alpha(a,\, b)&lt;/math&gt; with each step having one addition and one multiplication. Therefore, the total number of computations needed is &lt;math&gt;2\cdot q^2 \cdot q^3 = 2q^5&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the asymptotic complexity of the above function is &lt;math&gt;O(n^5)&lt;/math&gt;.

If we apply the distributive law to the RHS of the equation, we get the following:

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha(a, \, b) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}   \displaystyle\sum\limits_{c \in A} f(a, \, c, \, b ) \cdot \sum _{d,\,e \in A} g(a,\,d,\,e) &lt;/math&gt;

This implies that &lt;math&gt;\alpha(a, \, b)&lt;/math&gt; can be described as a product &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{1}(a,\, b) \cdot \alpha_{2}(a)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \alpha_{1}(a,b) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \displaystyle\sum\limits_{c \in A} f(a, \, c, \, b )&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{2}(a) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \displaystyle\sum\limits_{d,\,e \in A} g(a,\, d, \,e )&lt;/math&gt;

Now, when we are calculating the computational complexity, we can see that there are &lt;math&gt;q^{3}&lt;/math&gt; additions in &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{1}(a,\, b)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{2}(a)&lt;/math&gt; each and there are &lt;math&gt;q^2&lt;/math&gt; multiplications when we are using the product &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{1}(a,\, b) \cdot \alpha_{2}(a)&lt;/math&gt; to evaluate &lt;math&gt;\alpha(a, \, b)&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the total number of computations needed is &lt;math&gt;q^3 + q^3 + q^2 = 2q^3 + q^2&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the asymptotic complexity of calculating &lt;math&gt;\alpha(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; reduces to &lt;math&gt;O(n^{3})&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;O(n^{5})&lt;/math&gt;.  This shows by an example that applying distributive law reduces the computational complexity which is one of the good features of a "fast algorithm".

==History==

Some of the problems that used distributive law to solve can be grouped as follows

1. Decoding algorithms&lt;br&gt;
A GDL like algorithm was used by Gallager's for decoding low density parity-check codes. Based on Gallager's work Tanner introduced the [[Tanner graph]] and expressed Gallagers work in message passing form. The tanners graph also helped explain the  [[Viterbi algorithm]].

It is observed by Forney that Viterbi's maximum likelihood decoding of [[convolutional codes]] also used algorithms of GDL-like generality.

2. [[Forward-backward algorithm]]&lt;br&gt;
The forward backward algorithm helped as an algorithm for tracking the states in the [[markov chain]]. And this also was used the algorithm of GDL like generality

3. [[Artificial intelligence]]&lt;br&gt;
The notion of [[junction tree]]s has been used to solve many problems in AI. Also the concept of [[bucket elimination]] used many of the concepts.

==The MPF problem==

'''MPF or marginalize a product function''' is a general computational problem which as special case includes many classical problems such as computation of discrete [[Hadamard transform]], [[maximum likelihood decoding]] of a [[linear code]] over a memory-less [[Channel (communications)|channel]], and [[matrix chain multiplication]]. The power of the GDL lies in the fact that it applies to situations in which additions and multiplications are generalized.
A [[commutative semiring]] is a good framework for explaining this behavior. It is defined over a set &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; with operators "&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;" and "&lt;math&gt;.&lt;/math&gt;" where &lt;math&gt;(K,\, +)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(K,\, .)&lt;/math&gt; are a [[commutative monoid]]s and the distributive law holds.

Let &lt;math&gt;p_1, \ldots, p_n&lt;/math&gt; be variables such that &lt;math&gt;p_1 \in A_1, \ldots, p_n \in A_{n}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;A &lt;/math&gt; is a finite set and &lt;math&gt;|A_i| = q_i&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;i = 1,\ldots, n&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;S = \{i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r}\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S \, \subset \{1,\ldots, n\}&lt;/math&gt;, let
&lt;math&gt; A_{S}  = A_{i_1} \times \cdots \times A_{i_r} &lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt; p_{S} = (p_{i_1},\ldots, p_{i_r})&lt;/math&gt;,  
&lt;math&gt; q_{S} = |A_{S}|&lt;/math&gt;, 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A  = A_{1} \times \cdots \times A_{n} &lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf p = \{p_{1}, \ldots, p_{n}\}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;S = \{S_{j}\}_{j=1}^M &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;S_{j} \subset \{1, ...\,,n\}&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose a function is defined as &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{i}: A_{S_{i}} \rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a [[commutative semiring]]. Also, &lt;math&gt; p_{S_{i}}&lt;/math&gt; are named the ''local domains'' and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{i}&lt;/math&gt; as the ''local kernels''.

Now the global kernel &lt;math&gt;\beta : \mathbf A \rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt; is defined as :
&lt;math&gt; \beta(p_{1}, ...\,, p_{n}) = \prod_{i=1}^M \alpha(p_{S_{i}})&lt;/math&gt;

''Definition of MPF problem'': For one or more indices &lt;math&gt;i = 1, ...\,, M&lt;/math&gt;, compute a table of the values of &lt;math&gt;S_{i}&lt;/math&gt;-''marginalization'' of the global kernel &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, which is the function &lt;math&gt;\beta_{i}:A_{S_{i}} \rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt; defined as &lt;math&gt;\beta_{i}(p_{S_{i}}) \, = \displaystyle\sum\limits_{p_{S_{i}^c} \in A_{S_{i}^c}} \beta(p)&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;S_{i}^c&lt;/math&gt; is the complement of &lt;math&gt;S_{i}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf \{1,...\,,n\}&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;\beta_i(p_{S_i})&lt;/math&gt; is called the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; ''objective function'', or the ''objective function'' at &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt;. It can observed that the computation of the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; objective function in the obvious way needs &lt;math&gt;Mq_1 q_2 q_3\cdots q_{n}&lt;/math&gt; operations. This is because there are &lt;math&gt;q_1 q_2\cdots q_n&lt;/math&gt; additions and &lt;math&gt;(M-1)q_1 q_2...q_n&lt;/math&gt; multiplications needed in the computation of the &lt;math&gt;i^\text{th}&lt;/math&gt; objective function. The GDL algorithm which is explained in the next section can reduce this computational complexity.

The following is an example of the MPF problem. 
Let &lt;math&gt;p_{1},\,p_{2},\,p_{3},\,p_{4},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_{5}&lt;/math&gt; be variables such that &lt;math&gt;p_{1} \in A_{1}, p_{2} \in A_{2}, p_{3} \in A_{3}, p_{4} \in A_{4}, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_{5} \in A_{5}&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;M=4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S = \{\{1,2,5\},\{2,4\},\{1,4\}, \{2\}\}&lt;/math&gt;. The given functions using these variables are &lt;math&gt;f(p_{1},p_{2},p_{5})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(p_{3},p_{4})&lt;/math&gt; and we need to calculate &lt;math&gt;\alpha(p_{1}, \, p_{4})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta(p_{2})&lt;/math&gt; defined as:

: &lt;math&gt; \alpha(p_1, \, p_4) =  \displaystyle\sum\limits_{p_2 \in A_2,\, p_3 \in A_3, \, p_5 \in A_5 } f(p_1,\, p_2,\, p_5 ) \cdot g(p_2, \, p_4)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \beta(p_{2}) = \sum\limits_{p_1 \in A_1,\, p_3 \in A_3,\, p_4 \in A_4, \, p_5 \in A_5 } f(p_1, \, p_2, \, p_5) \cdot g(p_2, \, p_4) &lt;/math&gt;

Here local domains and local kernels are defined as follows: 
{|
|-
! local domains !! local kernels
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{5}\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;(f(p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{5})&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{ p_{2}, p_{4}\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;g(p_{2}, p_{4})&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_{1}, p_{4}\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_{2}\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;
|}

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha(p_{1}, p_{4})&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;3^{rd}&lt;/math&gt; objective function and &lt;math&gt;\beta(p_{2})&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;4^{th}&lt;/math&gt; objective function.

Let us consider another example where &lt;math&gt;p_{1},p_{2},p_{3},p_{4},r_{1},r_{2},r_{3},r_{4} \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(r_{1},r_{2},r_{3},r_{4})&lt;/math&gt; is a real valued function. Now, we shall consider the MPF problem where the commutative semiring is defined as the set of real numbers with ordinary addition and multiplication and the local domains and local kernels are defined as follows:

{|
|-
! local domains !! local kernels
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{r_1, r_2, r_3,r_4\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;f(r_1, r_2, r_3,r_4)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{ p_1, r_1\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{p_1 r_1}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_2, r_2\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{p_2 r_2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_3, r_3\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{p_3 r_3}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_4, r_4\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{p_4 r_4}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\{p_1,p_2, p_3, p_4\}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Now since the global kernel is defined as the product of the local kernels, it is

: &lt;math&gt;F(p_1, p_2, p_3,p_4, r_1, r_2, r_3,r_4) = f(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4)\cdot(-1)^{p_1r_1 + p_2r_2 + p_3r_3 + p_4r_4}&lt;/math&gt;

and the objective function at the local domain &lt;math&gt;p_1, p_2, p_3,p_4&lt;/math&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt;F(p_1, p_2, p_3,p_4) = \displaystyle\sum \limits_{r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4} f(r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4) \cdot(-1)^{p_1r_1 + p_2r_2 + p_3r_3 + p_4r_4}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the [[Hadamard transform]] of the function &lt;math&gt;f(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence we can see that the computation of [[Hadamard transform]] is a special case of the MPF problem. More examples can be demonstrated to prove that the MPF problem forms special cases of many classical problem as explained above whose details can be found at&lt;ref name=GenDistLaw /&gt;

== GDL: an algorithm for solving the MPF problem ==

If one can find a relationship among the elements of a given set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, then one can solve the MPF problem basing on the notion of [[belief propagation]] which is a special use of "message passing" technique. The required relationship is that the given set of local domains can be organised into a [[junction tree]]. In other words, we create a graph theoretic tree with the elements of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; as the vertices of the [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]] &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, such that for any two arbitrary vertices say &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_{j}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;i \neq j&lt;/math&gt; and there exists an edge between these two vertices, then the intersection of corresponding labels, viz &lt;math&gt;S_{i}\cap S_{j}&lt;/math&gt;, is a subset of the label on each vertex on the unique path from &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v_{j}&lt;/math&gt;.

For example,

Example 1: Consider the following nine local domains:

# &lt;math&gt;\{p_2\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_3,p_2\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_2,p_1\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_3,p_4\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_3\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_1,p_4\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_1\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_4\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_2,p_4\}&lt;/math&gt;

For the above given set of local domains, one can organize them into a junction tree as shown below:

[[File:An example of a junction tree on a given set.png|center|An example of a junction of tree]]

Similarly If another set like the following is given

Example 2: Consider the following four local domains:

# &lt;math&gt;\{p_1,p_2\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_2,p_3\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_3,p_4\}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\{p_1,p_4\}&lt;/math&gt;

Then constructing the tree only with these local domains is not possible since this set of values has no common domains which can be placed between any two values of the above set. But however if add the two dummy domains as shown below then organizing the updated set into a junction tree would be possible and easy too.

5.&lt;math&gt;\{p_{1},p_{2}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;p_{4}\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
6.&lt;math&gt;\{p_{2},p_{3}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;p_{4}\}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly for these set of domains, the junction tree looks like shown below:
[[File:Example of junction tree.png|center|Another example of a junction tree]]

===Generalized distributive law (GDL) algorithm===
Input: A set of local domains.&lt;br /&gt;
Output: For the given set of domains, possible minimum number of operations that is required to solve the problem is computed. &lt;br /&gt;
So, if &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_{j}&lt;/math&gt; are connected by an edge in the junction tree, then a message from &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v_{j}&lt;/math&gt; is a set/table of values given by a function: &lt;math&gt;\mu_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;math&gt;A_{S_{i}\cap S_{j}} \rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt;. To begin with all the functions i.e. for all combinations of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; in the given tree, &lt;math&gt;\mu_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be identically &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and when a particular message is update, it follows the equation given below.

: &lt;math&gt;\mu_{i,j}(p_{S_{i}\cap S_{j}})&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\sum_{p_{S_{i}\setminus S_{j}}\in A_{S_{i} \setminus S_{j}}} \alpha _{i} (p_{S_{i}}) \prod_{{v_k \operatorname{adj} v_i},{k \neq j}} \mu_{k,j}(p_{S_k\cap S_i})(1)
 &lt;/math&gt;
    
where &lt;math&gt;v_k \operatorname{adj} v_i&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;v_{k}&lt;/math&gt; is an adjacent vertex to &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; in tree.

Similarly each vertex has a state which is defined as a table containing the values from the function &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{i}: A_{S_{i}} \rightarrow R &lt;/math&gt;, Just like how messages initialize to 1 identically, state of &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be local kernel &lt;math&gt;\alpha(p_{S_{i}})&lt;/math&gt;, but whenever &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{i}&lt;/math&gt; gets updated, it follows the following equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma(p_{S_i})  =   \alpha_i(p_{S_i}) \prod_{v_k \operatorname{adj} v_i}  \mu_{k,j}(p_{S_k\cap S_i})(2).&lt;/math&gt;

===Basic working of the algorithm===
For the given set of local domains as input, we find out if we can create a junction tree, either by using the set directly or by adding dummy domains to the set first and then creating the junction tree, if construction junction is not possible then algorithm output that there is no way to reduce the number of steps to compute the given equation problem, but once we have junction tree, algorithm will have to schedule messages and compute states, by doing these we can know where steps can be reduced, hence will be discusses this below.

== Scheduling of the message passing and the state computation ==

There are two special cases we are going to talk about here namely ''Single Vertex Problem'' in which the objective function is computed at only one vertex &lt;math&gt;v_{0}&lt;/math&gt;  and the second one is ''All Vertices Problem'' where the goal is to compute the objective function at all vertices.

Lets begin with the '''single-vertex problem''', GDL will start by directing each edge towards the targeted vertex &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;. Here messages are sent only in the direction towards the targeted vertex. Note that all the directed messages are sent only once. The messages are started from the leaf nodes(where the degree is 1) go up towards the target vertex &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;. The message travels from the leaves to its parents and then from there to their parents and so on until it reaches the target vertex &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;. The target vertex &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; will compute its state only when it receives all messages from all its neighbors. Once we have the state, We have got the answer and hence the algorithm terminates.

For Example, Lets consider a junction tree constructed from the set of local domains given above i.e. the set from example 1, &lt;br /&gt;Now the Scheduling table for these domains is (where the target vertex is &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt;).

&lt;math&gt;\text{Round                      Message or State Computation} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;1.\mu_{8,4}(p_{4}) = \alpha_{8}(p_{4}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2.\mu_{8,4}(p_{4}) = \Sigma_{p_{2}} \alpha_{9}(p_{2},p_{4}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;3.\mu_{5,2}(p_{3}) = \alpha_{5}(p_{3}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;4.\mu_{6,3}(p_{1}) = \Sigma_{p_{4}} \alpha_{6}(p_{1},p_{4}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;5.\mu_{7,3}(p_{1}) = \alpha_{7}(p_{1}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;6.\mu_{4,2}(p_{3}) = \Sigma_{p_{4}} \alpha_{4}(p_{3},p_{4}).\mu_{8,4}(p_{4}).\mu_{9,4}(p_{4}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;7.\mu_{3,1}(p_{2}) = \Sigma_{p_{1}} \alpha_{3}(p_{2},p_{1}).\mu_{6,3}(p_{1}).\mu_{7,3}(p_{1}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;8.\mu_{2,1}(p_{2}) = \Sigma_{p_{3}} \alpha_{2}(p_{3},p_{2}).\mu_{4,2}(p_{3}).\mu_{5,2}(p_{3}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;9.\sigma_{1}(p_{2}) = \alpha_{1}(p_{2}).\mu_{2,1}(p_{2}).\mu_{3,1}(p_{2})&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the complexity for Single Vertex GDL can be shown as

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{v} d(v)|A_{S_{(v)}}| &lt;/math&gt;  arithmetic operations&lt;br /&gt;
Where (Note: The explanation for the above equation is explained later in the article )&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;S(v)&lt;/math&gt; is the label of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;d(v)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. number of vertices adjacent to v).

To solve the '''All-Vertices''' problem, we can schedule GDL in several ways, some of them are parallel implementation where in each round, every state is updated and every message is computed and transmitted at the same time. In this type of implementation the states and messages will stabilizes after number of rounds that is at most equal to the diameter of the tree. At this point all the all states of the vertices will be equal to the desired objective function.

Another way to schedule GDL for this problem is serial implementation where its similar to the  Single vertex problem except that we don't stop the algorithm until all the vertices of a required set have not got all the messages from all their neighbors and have compute their state. &lt;br /&gt;
Thus the number of arithmetic this implementation requires is at most &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{v \in V} d(v)|A_{S_{(v)}}| &lt;/math&gt; arithmetic operations.

==Constructing a junction tree==

The key to constructing a junction tree lies in the local domain graph &lt;math&gt;G_{LD}&lt;/math&gt;, which is a weighted complete graph with &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; vertices &lt;math&gt;v_1,v_2,v_3,\ldots ,v_M&lt;/math&gt; i.e. one for each local domain, having the weight of the edge  &lt;math&gt;e_{i,j} : v_i \leftrightarrow v_j&lt;/math&gt; defined by&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\omega_{i,j} = |S_{i} \cap S_{j}|&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
if &lt;math&gt;x_{k} \in S_{i} \cap S_{j}&lt;/math&gt;, then we say &lt;math&gt;x_{k}&lt;/math&gt; is contained in&lt;math&gt;e_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt;. Denoted by &lt;math&gt;\omega_{max}&lt;/math&gt; (the weight of a maximal-weight spanning tree of &lt;math&gt;G_{LD}&lt;/math&gt;), which is defined by

: &lt;math&gt;\omega^{*} = \Sigma ^M_{i=1}|S_{i}| - n&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the number of elements in that set. For more clarity and details, please refer to these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ai.stanford.edu/~paskin/gm-short-course/lec3.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319085443/http://ai.stanford.edu/~paskin/gm-short-course/lec3.pdf |archivedate=2015-03-19 |df= }} The Junction Tree Algorithms&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www-anw.cs.umass.edu/~cs691t/SS02/lectures/week7.PDF The Junction Tree Algorithm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scheduling theorem==

Let &lt;math&gt;'T'&lt;/math&gt; be a junction tree with vertex set &lt;math&gt;'V'&lt;/math&gt; and edge set &lt;math&gt;'E'&lt;/math&gt;. In this algorithm, the messages are sent in both the direction on any edge, so we can say/regard the edge set E as set of ordered pairs of vertices. For example, from Figure 1 &lt;math&gt;'E'&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as follows

: &lt;math&gt;E = \{(1,2),(2,1),(1,3),(3,1),(4,2),(2,4),(5,2),(2,5),(6,3),(3,6),(7,3),(3,7),(8,4),(4,8),(9,4),(4,9)\}&lt;/math&gt;

NOTE:&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; above gives you all the possible directions that a message can travel in the tree.

The schedule for the GDL is defined as a finite sequence of subsets of&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. Which is generally represented by 
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} =&lt;/math&gt;{&lt;math&gt;E_{1},E_{2},E_{3},\ldots, E_{N}&lt;/math&gt;}, Where &lt;math&gt;E_{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of messages updated during the &lt;math&gt;N^{th}&lt;/math&gt; round of running the algorithm.

Having defined/seen some notations, we will see want the theorem says,
When we are given a schedule &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} =\{ E_1,E_2,E_3,\ldots, E_N\}&lt;/math&gt;, the corresponding [[Trellis (graph)|message trellis]] as a finite directed graph with Vertex set of  &lt;math&gt;V \times \{0,1,2,3,\ldots, N\}&lt;/math&gt;, in which a typical element is denoted by &lt;math&gt;v_{i}(t)&lt;/math&gt; for  &lt;math&gt;t \in \{0,1,2,3,\ldots,N\}&lt;/math&gt;, Then after completion of the message passing, state at  vertex &lt;math&gt;v_{j}&lt;/math&gt; will be the &lt;math&gt;j^\text{th}&lt;/math&gt; objective defined in

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma(p_{S_i}) = \alpha_i(p_{S_i}) \prod_{v_k \operatorname{adj} v_i}  \mu_{k,j}(p_{S_{k}\cap S_{i}})&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;nowiki&gt;iff&lt;/nowiki&gt; there is a path from &lt;math&gt;v_i(0)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v_j(N)&lt;/math&gt;

== Computational complexity ==

Here we try to explain the complexity of solving the MPF problem in terms of the number of mathematical operations required for the calculation. i.e. We compare the number of operations required when calculated using the normal method (Here by normal method we mean by methods that do not use message passing or junction trees in short methods that do not use the concepts of GDL)and the number of operations using the generalized distributive law.

Example: Let us consider the simplest case where we need to compute the following expression &lt;math&gt;ab+ac&lt;/math&gt;.

To evaluate this expression naively requires two multiplications and one addition. The expression when expressed using the distributive law can be written as &lt;math&gt;a(b+c)&lt;/math&gt; a simple optimization that reduces the number of operations to one addition and one multiplication.

Similar to the above explained example we will be expressing the equations in different forms to perform as few operation as possible by applying the GDL.

As explained in the previous sections we solve the problem by using the concept of the junction trees. The optimization obtained by the use of these trees is comparable to the optimization obtained by solving a semi group problem on trees. For example, to find the minimum of a group of numbers we can observe that if we have a tree and the elements are all at the bottom of the tree, then we can compare the minimum of two items in parallel and the resultant minimum will be written to the parent. When this process is propagated up the tree the minimum of the group of elements will be found at the root.

The following is the complexity for solving the junction tree using message passing

We rewrite the formula used earlier to the following form. This is the eqn for a message to be sent from vertex ''v'' to ''w''

: &lt;math&gt;\mu _{v,w} (p_{v \cap w}) =  \sum _{p _{v \setminus w} \in A _{S(v) \setminus S(w)}} \alpha _{v} (p _{v})  \prod _{u adj v _{u \neq v}} \mu _{u,v} (p _{u \cap v})&lt;/math&gt;            ----message equation
 
Similarly we rewrite the equation for calculating the state of vertex v as follows

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_v(p_v) =  \alpha_v (p_v) \prod_{u \operatorname{adj} v} \mu _{v,w} (p _{v \cap w}) &lt;/math&gt;

We first will analyze for the single-vertex problem and assume the target vertex is &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; and hence we have one edge from &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v _{0}&lt;/math&gt;. 
Suppose we have an edge &lt;math&gt;(v,w)&lt;/math&gt; we calculate the message using the message equation. To calculate &lt;math&gt;p _{u \cap v}&lt;/math&gt; requires

: &lt;math&gt; q _{v \setminus w} -1 &lt;/math&gt;

additions and

: &lt;math&gt; q _{v \setminus w} (d(v)-1)&lt;/math&gt;

multiplications.

(We represent the &lt;math&gt;|A _{S(v) \ S(w)}|&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;q _{v \setminus w}&lt;/math&gt;.)

But there will be many possibilities for &lt;math&gt;x _{v \cap w}&lt;/math&gt; hence &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; q _{v \cap w} \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} | A _{S(v) \cap S(w)}|&lt;/math&gt; possibilities for &lt;math&gt;p _{v \cap w}&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus the entire message will need

: &lt;math&gt; (q _{v \cap w})(q _{v \setminus w} -1)  = q _{v} - q _{v \cap w}&lt;/math&gt;

additions and

: &lt;math&gt; (q _{v \cap w}) q _{v \setminus w}. (d(v) -1) = (d(v) -1) q _v&lt;/math&gt;
multiplications

The total number of arithmetic operations required to send a message towards &lt;math&gt;v_0 &lt;/math&gt;along the edges of tree will be

: &lt;math&gt;\sum _{ v \neq v0} (q_v - q _{v \cap w})&lt;/math&gt;

additions and

: &lt;math&gt; \sum _{ v \neq v0}  (d(v) - 1) q_v&lt;/math&gt;

multiplications.

Once all the messages have been transmitted the algorithm terminates with the computation of state at &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;  The state computation requires &lt;math&gt;d(v_0) q _0&lt;/math&gt; more multiplications.
Thus number of calculations required to calculate the state is given as below

: &lt;math&gt; \sum _{v \neq v _{0}} (q _{v} - q _{v \cap w}) &lt;/math&gt;

additions and

: &lt;math&gt; \sum _{v \neq v _{0}} (d(v) -1) q _{v} + d(v _{0})q _{v _{0}}&lt;/math&gt;

multiplications

Thus the grand total of the number of calculations is

: &lt;math&gt; \chi (T) = \sum _{v \in V} d(v)q _{v} - \sum _{e \in E} q _{e}&lt;/math&gt; ----&lt;math&gt;(1)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e = (v,w)&lt;/math&gt; is an edge and its size is defined by &lt;math&gt;q _{v \cap w}&lt;/math&gt;

The formula above gives us the upper bound.

If we define the complexity of the edge &lt;math&gt;e = (v,w)&lt;/math&gt; as

: &lt;math&gt; \chi (e) = q _{v} + q _{w} - q _{v \cap w} &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;(1)&lt;/math&gt; can be written as

: &lt;math&gt; \chi(T) = \sum _{e \in E} \chi (e)&lt;/math&gt;

We now calculate the edge complexity for the problem defined in Figure 1 as follows

: &lt;math&gt; \chi(1,2) = q_2 + q_2 q_3 - q_2&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(2,4) = q_3 q_4 + q_2 q_3 - q_3&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(2,5) = q_3 + q_2 q_3 - q_3&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(4,8) = q_4 + q_3 q_4 - q_4&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(4,9) = q_2 q_4 + q_3 q_4 - q_4&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(1,3) = q _2 + q_2 q_1 - q_2&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(3,7) = q_1 + q_1 q_2 - q_1&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \chi(3,6) = q_1 q _4 + q _1 q_2 - q _1&lt;/math&gt;

The total complexity will be &lt;math&gt; 3 q _{2}q _{3} + 3q _{3}q _{4}+ 3 q _{1}q _{2}+q _{2}q _{4} + q _{1}q _{4} - q _{1} - q _{3} - q _{4}&lt;/math&gt; which is considerably low compared to the direct method. (Here by direct method we mean by methods that do not use message passing. The time taken using the direct method will be the equivalent to calculating message at each node and time to calculate the state of each of the nodes.)

Now we consider the all-vertex problem where the message will have to be sent in both the directions and state must be computed at both the vertexes. This would take &lt;math&gt; O( \sum _{v} d(v) d(v) q _{v}) &lt;/math&gt; but by precomputing we can reduce the number of multiplications to &lt;math&gt;3(d-2)&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the degree of the vertex. Ex : If there is a set &lt;math&gt;(a _{1}, \ldots ,a _{d})&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; numbers. It is possible to compute all the d products of &lt;math&gt;d-1&lt;/math&gt; of the &lt;math&gt; a _{i}&lt;/math&gt; with at most &lt;math&gt;3(d-2)&lt;/math&gt; multiplications rather than the obvious &lt;math&gt; d(d-2) &lt;/math&gt;. 
We do this by precomputing the quantities 
&lt;math&gt;b_1 = a_1, b_2= b_1 \cdot a_2 = a_1 \cdot a _2, b _{d-1} = b _{d-2} \cdot a_{d-1} = a_1 a_2 \cdots a_{d-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_d = a_d, c_{d-1} = a_{d-1} c_d = a _{d-1} \cdot a_d, \ldots , c_2 = a _2 \cdot c_3 = a _2 a_3 \cdots a_d&lt;/math&gt; this takes &lt;math&gt; 2 (d-2)&lt;/math&gt; multiplications. Then if &lt;math&gt; m_j&lt;/math&gt; denotes the product of all &lt;math&gt; a_i&lt;/math&gt; except for &lt;math&gt; a_j&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt; m_1 = c_2, m_2 = b_1 \cdot c_3&lt;/math&gt; and so on will need another &lt;math&gt;d-2&lt;/math&gt; multiplications making the total &lt;math&gt; 3 (d-2)&lt;/math&gt;

There is not much we can do when it comes to the construction of the junction tree except that we may have many maximal weight spanning tree and we should choose the spanning tree with the least &lt;math&gt;\chi(T)&lt;/math&gt; and sometimes this might mean adding a local domain to lower the junction tree complexity.

It may seem that GDL is correct only when the local domains can be expressed as a junction tree. But even in cases where there are cycles and a number of iterations the messages will approximately be equal to the objective function. The experiments on Gallager–Tanner–Wiberg algorithm for low density parity-check codes were supportive of this claim.

== Methods ==
GBS is a robust, simple, and affordable procedure for SNP discovery and mapping. Overall, this approach reduces genome complexity with restriction enzymes (REs) in high-diversity, large genomes species for efficient high-throughput, highly multiplexed sequencing. By using appropriate REs, repetitive regions of genomes can be avoided and lower copy regions can be targeted, which reduces alignments problems in genetically highly diverse species. The method was first described by Elshire et al. (2011).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In summary, high [[Molecular mass|molecular weight]] DNAs are extracted and digested using a specific RE previously defined by cutting frequently&lt;ref&gt;http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-15-979&lt;/ref&gt; in the major repetitive fraction of the genome. ''ApeKI'' is the most used RE. Barcode adapters are then ligated to [[Sticky and blunt ends|sticky ends]] and [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR amplification]] is performed.  Next-generation sequencing technology is performed resulting in about 100 bp single-end reads. Raw sequence data are filtered and aligned to a reference genome using usually [[Burrows-Wheeler Aligner|Burrows-Wheeler]] alignment tool (BWA) or [[Bowtie (sequence analysis)|Bowtie 2]]. The next step is to identify SNPs from aligned tags and score all discovered SNPs for various coverage, depth and genotypic statistics. Once a large-scale, species-wide SNP production has been run, it is possible to quickly call known SNPs in newly sequenced samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bitbucket.org/tasseladmin/tassel-5-source/wiki/Tassel5GBSv2Pipeline|title=Tassel 5 GBS v2 Pipeline|website=Tassel 5 Source|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When initially developed, the GBS approach was tested and validated in recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a high-resolution maize mapping population (IBM) and doubled haploid (DH) barley lines from the Oregon Wolfe Barley (OWB) mapping population. Up to 96 RE (ApeKI)-digested DNA samples were pooled and processed simultaneously during the GBS library construction, which was checked on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.). Overall, 25,185 biallelic tags were mapped in maize, while 24,186 sequence tags were mapped in barley. Barley GBS marker validation using a single DH line (OWB003) showed 99% agreement between the reference markers and the mapped GBS reads. Although barley lacks a complete genome sequence, GBS does not require a reference genome for sequence tag mapping, the reference is developed during the process of sampling genotyping. Tags can also be treated as dominant markers for alternative genetic analysis in the absence of a reference genome. Other than the multiplex GBS skimming, imputation of missing SNPs has the potential to further reduce GBS costs. GBS is a versatile and cost-effective procedure that will allow mining genomes of any species without prior knowledge of its genome structure. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''George R. Griswold''' (December 31, 1794 &amp;ndash; April 5, 1857) was an [[United States|American]] politician and [[Lieutenant Governor of Michigan|tenth Lieutenant Governor]] from the [[U. S. state]] of [[Michigan]].

==Early life==
Griswold was born in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] and later moved to [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] and practiced law.

==Career==
Griswold served as clerk of the first [[Michigan House of Representatives]] in 1835.  He was register of deeds from 1837 to 1841 and clerk of [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]] from 1843 to 1847.  In 1839 he became owner and publisher of the Detroit ''Morning Post'', and he became State Printer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michigan. Legislature. Senate|title=Journal|publisher=1839 Harvard University|page=530|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pIUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA530 |accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later served in the [[Michigan Senate]] from Detroit (1st District) from 1848 until 1849 and again in 1853 when he served as president pro tempore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=EARLY HISTORY WITH BIOGRAPHIES OF STATE OFFICERS|publisher=1888 the University of Michigan|page=313|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oSf2X1Es73cC&amp;pg=PA313 |accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
On March 8, 1853, [[Governor of Michigan|Michigan Governor]] [[Robert McClelland (American politician)|Robert McClelland]] resigned to become [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] under [[Franklin Pierce]].  As a result,  [[Lieutenant Governor of Michigan|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Andrew Parsons (American politician)|Andrew Parsons]] became [[Governor of Michigan|Governor]] and Griswold became the [[Lieutenant Governor of Michigan|tenth Lieutenant Governor]] and served from 1853 to 1854.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Michigan Manual|publisher=1906 - Michigan|page=118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TcEGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA118 |accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 16 of that year he was appointed a purser in the [[U. S. Navy]]. He served as acting lieutenant governor until [[George Coe (Michigan politician)|George Coe]] was elected and then took his place in January 1855.

==Death==
Griswold died on board the [[USS Dolphin (1836)|USS ''Dolphin'']] off the African coast just over two years after leaving office.

'''Grafting''' or '''graftage'''&lt;ref name=Hottes&gt;{{cite book |author=Hottes, A.C. |year=1925 |title=Practical plant propagation: an exposition of the art and science of increasing plants as practiced by the nurseryman, florist and gardener |publisher=A.T. De La Mare |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[horticulture|horticultural]] technique whereby [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] of [[plant]]s are joined so as to continue their growth together. The upper part of the combined plant is called the scion ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|aɪ|ə|n}}) while the lower part is called the rootstock. The success of this joining requires that the vascular tissue grow together and such joining is called [[inosculation]]. The technique is most commonly used in [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] [[plant propagation|propagation]] of commercially grown plants for the [[horticultural]] and [[agricultural]] trades.

In most cases, one plant is selected for its [[root]]s and this is called the '''stock''' or [[rootstock]]. The other plant is selected for its [[Plant stem|stems]], [[Leaf|leaves]], [[flower]]s, or [[fruit]]s and is called the '''scion''' or '''cion'''.&lt;ref name=Hottes/&gt; The scion contains the desired [[gene]]s to be duplicated in future production by the stock/scion plant.

In stem grafting, a common grafting method, a [[shoot]] of a selected, desired plant [[cultivar]] is grafted onto the stock of another type. In another common form called bud grafting, a dormant side bud is grafted onto the stem of another stock plant, and when it has [[inosculation|inosculated]] successfully, it is encouraged to grow by [[pruning]] off the stem of the stock plant just above the newly grafted bud.

For successful grafting to take place, the [[vascular cambium]] tissues of the stock and scion plants must be placed in contact with each other. Both tissues must be kept alive until the graft has "taken", usually a period of a few [[week]]s. Successful grafting only requires that a vascular connection take place between the grafted tissues. Joints formed by grafting are not as strong as naturally formed joints, so a physical weak point often still occurs at the graft because only the newly formed tissues inosculate with each other. The existing structural tissue (or wood) of the stock plant does not fuse.

==Advantages==
[[File:Grafting of Plum (cultivar Regina Claudia yellow).JPG|thumb|right|Graft particular to plum cherry. The scion is the largest in the plant, due to the imperfect union of the two. It can be seen on the enlarged trunk: this accumulation of starch is an indication of imperfection.]]

*'''Precocity''': The ability to induce fruitfulness without the need for completing the juvenile phase. Juvenility is the natural state through which a seedling plant must pass before it can become reproductive. In most fruiting trees, juvenility may last between 5 and 9 years, but in some tropical fruits e.g. [[Mangosteen]], juvenility may be prolonged for up to 15 years. Grafting of mature [[wiktionary:Scion|scion]]s onto rootstocks can result in fruiting in as little as two years.
*'''Dwarfing''': To induce dwarfing or cold tolerance or other characteristics to the scion. Most [[apple]] trees in modern [[orchard]]s are grafted on to dwarf or semi-dwarf trees planted at high density. They provide more fruit per unit of land, higher quality [[fruit]], and reduce the danger of accidents by harvest crews working on ladders. Care must be taken when planting dwarf or semi-dwarf trees. If such a tree is planted with the graft below the soil, then the scion portion can also grow roots and the tree will still grow to its standard size.
*'''Ease of propagation''': Because the scion is difficult to propagate vegetatively by other means, such as by [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]]. In this case, cuttings of an easily rooted plant are used to provide a rootstock. In some cases, the scion may be easily propagated, but grafting may still be used because it is commercially the most cost-effective way of raising a particular type of plant.
*'''Hybrid breeding''': To speed maturity of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] in fruit tree breeding programs. Hybrid seedlings may take ten or more years to [[flower]] and fruit on their own roots. Grafting can reduce the time to flowering and shorten the breeding program.
*'''Hardiness''': Because the scion has weak roots or the roots of the stock plants are tolerant of difficult conditions. e.g. many [[Western Australia]]n plants are sensitive to [[Phytophthora cinnamomi|dieback]] on heavy soils, common in urban gardens, and are grafted onto hardier [[Eastern states of Australia|eastern Australia]]n relatives. [[Grevillea]]s and [[Eucalyptus|eucalypts]] are examples.
*'''Sturdiness''': To provide a strong, tall [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] for certain [[Ornamental plant|ornamental]] shrubs and trees. In these cases, a graft is made at a desired height on a stock plant with a strong stem. This is used to raise 'standard' [[rose]]s, which are rose bushes on a high stem, and it is also used for some ornamental trees, such as certain weeping cherries.
*'''Disease/Pest Resistance''': In areas where soil-borne pests or pathogens would prevent the successful planting of the desired cultivar, the use of pest/disease tolerant rootstocks allow the production from the cultivar that would be otherwise unsuccessful. A major example is the use of rootstocks in combating [[Phylloxera]].
*'''Pollen source''': To provide [[pollenizer]]s. For example, in tightly planted or badly planned apple [[orchard]]s of a single variety, limbs of [[Malus|crab apple]] may be grafted at regularly spaced intervals onto trees down rows, say every fourth tree. This takes care of [[pollen]] needs at blossom time, yet does not confuse pickers who might otherwise mix varieties while harvesting, as the mature crab apples are so distinct from other apple varieties.
*'''Repair''': To repair damage to the trunk of a tree that would prohibit nutrient flow, such as stripping of the [[Bark (botany)|bark]] by [[rodent]]s that completely girdles the trunk. In this case a [[bridge graft]] may be used to connect tissues receiving flow from the roots to tissues above the damage that have been severed from the flow. Where a [[water sprout]], [[basal shoot]] or [[wiktionary:sapling|sapling]] of the same species is growing nearby, any of these can be grafted to the area above the damage by a method called inarch grafting. These alternatives to scions must be of the correct length to span the gap of the wound.
*'''Changing cultivars''': To change the [[cultivar]] in a fruit orchard to a more profitable cultivar, called ''top working''. It may be faster to graft a new cultivar onto existing limbs of established trees than to replant an entire orchard.
*'''Maintain consistency''':  Apples are notorious for their genetic variability, even differing in multiple characteristics, such as, size, color, and flavor, of fruits located on the same tree. In the commercial farming industry, consistency is maintained by grafting a scion with desired fruit traits onto a hardy stock.

*'''Curiosities'''
**A practice sometimes carried out by [[gardener]]s is to graft related [[potato]]es and [[tomato]]es so that both are produced on the same plant, one above ground and one underground.
**[[Cactus|Cacti]] of widely different forms are sometimes grafted on to each other.
**Multiple [[cultivar]]s of fruits such as apples are sometimes grafted on a single tree. This so-called "[[Fruit tree propagation#Family tree|family tree]]" provides more fruit variety for small spaces such as a suburban backyard, and also takes care of the need for pollenizers. The drawback is that the gardener must be sufficiently trained to [[pruning|prune]] them correctly, or one strong variety will usually "take over." Multiple cultivars of different "stone fruits" (''Prunus'' species) can be grafted on a single tree. This is called a "[[fruit salad tree]]".
**Ornamental and functional, [[tree shaping]] uses grafting techniques to join separate trees or parts of the same tree to itself. [[Furniture]], hearts, entry archways are examples. [[Axel Erlandson]] was a prolific tree shaper who grew over 75 mature specimens.

== Factors for Successful Graft ==
* '''Compatibility of Scion and Stock''': Because grafting involves the joining of vascular tissues between the scion and rootstock, plants lacking vascular cambium, such as [[Monocotyledon|monocots]], cannot normally be grafted.  As a general rule, the closer two plants are genetically, the more likely the graft union will form. Genetically identical clones and intra-species plants have a high success rate for grafting. Grafting between species of the same genus is sometimes successful. Grafting has a low success rate when performed with plants in the same family but in different genera. And grafting between different families is rare.&lt;ref name="plant_propagation_3_5"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kumar |first=G. |date=2011 |title=Propagation of Plants by Grafting and Budding |url=http://extension.oregonstate.edu/deschutes/sites/default/files/propagation.pdf |publisher=Pacific Northwest Extension |pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Cambium Alignment &amp; Pressure''': The vascular cambium of the scion and stock should be tightly pressed together and oriented in the direction of normal growth. Proper alignment and pressure encourages the tissues to join quickly, allowing nutrients and water to transfer from the stockroot to the scion.&lt;ref name="plant_propagation"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hartmann |first=H.T. |last2=Kester |first2=D. |last3=Davies |first3=F. |last4=Geneve |first4=R. |date=2001 |title=Plant Propagation: Principals and Practices |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=7th |isbn=0-136-79235-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|466}}
*'''Completed during Appropriate Stage of Plant''': The grafting is completed at a time when the scion and stock are capable of producing [[callus]] and other wound-response tissues. Generally, grafting is performed when the scion is dormant, as premature budding can drain the grafting site of moisture before the grafting union is properly established. Temperature greatly affects the physiological stage of plants. If the temperature is too warm, premature budding may result. Elsewise, high temperatures can slow or halt callus formation.&lt;ref name="plant_propagation_3_5"/&gt;
*'''Proper Care of Graft Site''': After grafting, it is important to nurse the grafted plant back to health for a period of time. Various grafting tapes and waxes are used to protect the scion and stock from excessive water loss. Furthermore, depending on the type of graft, twine or string is used to add structural support to the grafting site. Sometimes it is necessary to prune the site, as the rootstock may produce [[shoots]] that inhibit the growth of the scion.&lt;ref name="plant_propagation_3_5"/&gt;

== Tools ==
[[File:Catalogue and price list season 1908-1909 - fruit and ornamental trees, evergreens, palms, rose (1908) (19964753973).jpg |thumb|right|upright=.35|Depiction of general purpose grafting knives]]
*''' Cutting Tools''': It is good procedure to keep the cutting tool sharp to minimize tissue damage and clean from dirt and other substances to avoid the spread of disease. A good knife for general grafting should have a blade and handle length of about 3 inches and 4 inches respectively. Specialized knives for grafting include bud-grafting knives, surgical knives, and pruning knives.  Cleavers, chisels, and saws are utilized when the stock is too large to be cut otherwise.
*'''Disinfecting Tools''': Treating the cutting tools with disinfectants insures the grafting site is clear of [[pathogen]]s. A common sterilizing agent is [[Ethanol#Absolute alcohol|absolute alcohol]]. 
*'''Graft Seals''': Keeps the grafting site hydrated. Good seals should be tight enough to retain moisture while, at the same time, loose enough to accommodate plant growth. Includes specialized types of clay, wax, petroleum jelly, and adhesive tape.
*'''Tying and Support Materials''': Adds support and pressure to the grafting site to hold the stock and scion together before the tissues join, which is especially important in herbaceous grafting. The employed material is often damped before use to help protect the site from desiccation. Support equipment includes strips made from various substances, twine, nails, and splints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garner |first1=R. |date=1958 |title=Grafter's Handbook |pages=79–100 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''' Grafting Machines''': Because grafting can take a lot of time and skill, grafting machines have been created. Automation is particularly popular for [[seedling]] grafting in countries such as Japan and Korea where farming land is both limited and used intensively. Certain machines can graft 800 seedlings per hour.&lt;ref name="plant_propagation"/&gt;{{rp|496}}

==Techniques==

===Approach===
[[File:Okulera.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|T budding]]
Approach grafting or inarching is used to join together plants that are otherwise difficult to join. The plants are grown close together, and then joined so that each plant has [[root]]s below and growth above the point of union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iZCkvzcVIhsC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=Approach+grafting&amp;client=firefox-a |title=Principles of Agricultural Botany |page=101 |first=Alexander |last=Nelson |publisher=Read Books |location=United Kingdom |date=2007 |isbn=1-4067-4662-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both scion and stock retain their respective parents that may or may not be removed after joining. Also used in [[pleaching]]. The graft can be successfully accomplished any time of year.&lt;ref name="grafters_handbook"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garner |first1=R. |date=1988 |title=Grafter's Handbook |page=131 |publisher=Cassell Illustrated |isbn=0-304-32172-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bud===
Bud grafting (also called [[chip budding]]) uses a bud instead of a twig. Grafting roses is the most common example of bud grafting. In this method a bud is removed from the parent plant, and the base of the bud is inserted beneath the bark of the stem of the stock plant from which the rest of the shoot has been cut. Any extra bud that starts growing  from the stem of the stock plant is removed. Examples: roses and fruit trees like peaches.

'''Budwood''' is a stick with several buds on it that can be cut out and used for bud grafting. It is a common method of propagation for citrus trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccpp.ucr.edu/budwood/budwood.php |title=Terms and Conditions of Supply of Budwood by CCPP |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Citrus Clonal Protection Program |publisher=University of California, Riverside |access-date=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freshfromflorida.com/Divisions-Offices/Plant-Industry/Agriculture-Industry/Citrus-Health-Response-Program/Citrus-Budwood-Program |title=Citrus Budwood Program |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services |access-date=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kcc-weslaco.tamu.edu/budwood.html |title=Citrus Budwood Cerfication Program |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=September 29, 2015 |website=Texas A&amp;M University - Kingsville Citrus Center |publisher= |access-date=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleft===
{{stack begin|float=left}}
[[File:CleftGraft2ndYr (cropped).JPG|thumb|left|upright|Successful cleft graft after 2 years growth]]
{{stack end}}
{{stack begin|float=left}}
[[File:CleftGraft4thYr (cropped).JPG|thumb|left|upright|Same graft after 4 years growth]]
{{stack end}}
In cleft grafting a small cut is made in the stalk and then the pointed end of the scion is inserted in the stalk. This is best done in the spring and is useful for joining a thin scion about {{convert|1|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} diameter to a thicker branch or stock. It is best if the latter is {{convert|2|-|7|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} in diameter and has 3–5 buds. The branch or stock should be split carefully down the middle to form a cleft about {{convert|3|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} deep. If it is a branch that is not vertical then the cleft should be cut horizontally. The end of the scion should be cut cleanly to a long shallow wedge, preferably with a single cut for each wedge surface, and not whittled. A third cut may be made across the end of the wedge to make it straight across.

Slide the wedge into the cleft so that it is at the edge of the stock and the centre of the wedge faces are against the cambium layer between the bark and the wood. It is preferable if a second scion is inserted in a similar way into the other side of the cleft. This helps to seal off the cleft. Tape around the top of the stock to hold the scion in place and cover with grafting wax or sealing compound. This stops the cambium layers from drying out and also prevents the ingress of water into the cleft.

===Whip===
{{stack begin|float=right}}
[[File:Whip graft (ugly) (cropped).JPG|thumb|right|upright|Graft needing attention the following season]]
{{stack end}}
{{stack begin|float=right}}
[[File:Whip graft (good) (cropped).JPG|thumb|right|upright|Successful whip graft]]
{{stack end}}
In whip grafting the scion and the stock are cut slanting and then joined. The grafted point is then bound with tape and covered with soft wax to prevent dehydration and infection by germs. Also known as the whip and tongue graft, this is considered the most difficult to master but has the highest rate of success as it offers the most cambium contact between the scion and the stock. It is the most common graft used in top-dressing commercial fruit trees. It is generally used with stock less than {{convert|1.25|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} diameter, with the ideal diameter closer to {{convert|1|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} and the scion should be of roughly the same diameter as the stock.

The stock is cut through on one side only at a shallow angle with a sharp knife. (If the stock is a branch and not the main trunk of the rootstock then the cut surface should face outward from the centre of the tree.) The scion is similarly sliced through at an equal angle starting just below a bud, so that the bud is at the top of the cut and on the other side than the cut face.

A notch is cut downwards into the sliced face of the stock and a similar cut upwards into the face of the scion cut. These act as the tongues and it requires some skill to make the cuts so that the scion and the stock marry up neatly. The joint is then taped around and treated with tree-sealing compound or grafting wax.

The elongated "Z" shape adds strength, removing the need for a companion rod in the first season (see illustration).

===Stub===
[[File:StubGraft (cropped).JPG|thumb|right|upright=.5|Successful stub graft, healed]]
Stub grafting is a technique that requires less stock than cleft grafting, and retains the shape of a tree. Also scions are generally of 6-8 buds in this process.

An incision is made into the branch {{convert|1|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} long, then the scion is wedged and forced into the branch. The scion should be at an angle of at most 35° to the parent tree so that the crotch remains strong. The graft is covered with grafting compound.

After the graft has taken, the branch is removed and treated a few centimeters above the graft, to be fully removed when the graft is strong.

===Four-flap===
The four-flap graft (also called banana graft) is commonly used for pecans, and first became popular with this species in Oklahoma in 1975. It is heralded for maximum cambium overlap, but is a complex graft. It requires similarly sized diameters for the rootstock and scion. The bark of the rootstock is sliced and peeled back in four flaps, and the hardwood is removed, looking somewhat like a peeled banana. It is a difficult graft to learn.

===Awl===
Awl grafting takes the least resources and the least time. It is best done by an experienced grafter, as it is possible to accidentally drive the tool too far into the stock, reducing the scion's chance of survival. Awl grafting can be done by using a screwdriver to make a slit in the bark, not penetrating the cambium layer completely. Then inset the wedged scion into the incision.

===Veneer===
Veneer grafting, or inlay grafting, is a method used for stock larger than {{convert|3|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} in diameter. The scion is recommended to be about as thick as a pencil. Clefts are made of the same size as the scion on the side of the branch, not on top. The scion end is shaped as a wedge, inserted, and wrapped with tape to the scaffolding branches to give it more strength.

==Natural grafting==
[[File:Husband and Wife Trees - Linncraigs, Dalry.JPG|upright|thumb|A [[Husband and Wife tree]] - Natural grafting in blackthorn [[Prunus spinosa]]]]
Tree [[branch]]es and more often [[root]]s of the same species will sometimes naturally graft; this is called [[inosculation]]. The bark of the tree may be stripped away when the roots make physical contact with each other, exposing the vascular cambium and allowing the roots to graft together. A group of trees can share water and mineral nutrients via root grafts, which may be advantageous to weaker trees, and may also form a larger rootmass as an adaptation to promote fire resistance and regeneration as exemplified by the California black oak (''[[Quercus kelloggii]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=C. Michael |last1=Hogan |date=2008 |title=California Black Oak ''Quercus kelloggii'' |website=iGoTerra |url=http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=82385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, grafting may protect the group from wind damages as a result of the increased mechanical stability provided by the grafting.&lt;ref name="root_graft_trees"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Loehle |first1=C. |last-author-amp=yes |last2=Jones |first2=R.H. |date=1998 |title=Adaptive Significance of Root Grafting in Trees |journal=Functional Ecology |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=268–271 |jstor=2389347}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albino redwood]]s use root grafting as a form of [[Parasitic plant|plant parasitism]] of normal redwoods.

A problem with root grafts is that they allow transmission of certain [[pathogen]]s, such as [[Dutch elm disease]]. Inosculation also sometimes occurs where two stems on the same tree, shrub or vine make contact with each other. This is common in plants such as [[Garden strawberry|strawberries]] and [[potato]].

Natural grafting is rarely seen in herbaceous plants as those types of plants generally have short-lived roots with little to no [[secondary growth]] in the vascular cambium.&lt;ref name="root_graft_trees" /&gt;

==Graft chimera ==
Occasionally, a so-called "[[Graft-chimaera|graft hybrid]]" or more accurately graft chimera can occur where the tissues of the stock continue to grow within the scion. Such a plant can produce flowers and [[foliage]] typical of both plants as well as shoots intermediate between the two. The best-known example this is probably [[+Laburnocytisus 'Adamii'|+''Laburnocytisus'' 'Adamii']], a graft hybrid between ''[[Laburnum]]'' and ''[[Cytisus]]'', which originated in a [[nursery (horticulture)|nursery]] near [[Paris|Paris, France]] in 1825. This small tree bears yellow flowers typical of ''[[Laburnum anagyroides]]'', purple flowers typical of ''[[Cytisus purpureus]]'' and curious coppery-pink flowers that show characteristics of both "parents". Many species of cactus can also produce graft chimeras under the right conditions although they are often created unintentionally and such results are often hard to replicate.

==Scientific uses==
Grafting has been important in [[flower]]ing research. [[Leaf|Leaves]] or shoots from plants induced to flower can be grafted onto uninduced plants and transmit a floral stimulus that induces them to flower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lang |first1=A. |last2=Chailakhyan |first2=M.K. |last3=Frolova |first3=I.A. |date=1977 |title=Promotion and inhibition of flower formation in a dayneutral plant in grafts with a short-day plant and a long-day plant |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC432182/pdf/pnas00028-0230.pdf |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=74 |issue=6 |pages=2412–2416 |pmid=16592404 |doi=10.1073/pnas.74.6.2412 |pmc=432182 |access-date=2018-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709054943/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC432182/pdf/pnas00028-0230.pdf |archive-date=2018-07-09 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transmission of [[plant virus]]es has been studied using grafting. Virus indexing involves grafting a symptomless plant that is suspected of carrying a virus onto an indicator plant that is very susceptible to the virus.

Grafting can transfer [[chloroplast]]s (specialised DNA in plants that can conduct [[photosynthesis]]), [[mitochondrial DNA]] and the entire [[cell nucleus]] containing the [[genome]] to potentially make a new species making grafting a form of natural [[genetic engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2079813-farmers-may-have-been-accidentally-making-gmos-for-millennia/|title=Farmers may have been accidentally making GMOs for millennia|last=Le Page|first=Michael|date=2016-03-17|website=|publisher=The New Scientist|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

===White Spruce===

[[White spruce]] can be grafted with consistent success by using {{convert|8|-|10|cm|in|frac=2|abbr=on}} scions of current growth on thrifty 4- to 5-year-old [[rootstock]] (Nienstaedt and Teich 1972).&lt;ref name="nien3"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Nienstaedt |first1=H. |last2=Teich |first2=A. |date=1972 |title=Genetics of white spruce |publisher=USDA, Forest Service |series=Research Paper |volume=WO-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before greenhouse grafting, rootstocks should be potted in late spring, allowed to make seasonal growth, then subjected to a period of chilling outdoors, or for about 8 weeks in a cool room at 2&amp;nbsp;°C (Nienstaedt 1966).&lt;ref name="nien2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nienstaedt |first1=H. |date=1966 |title=Dormancy and dormancy release in white spruce |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/saf/fs/1966/00000012/00000003/art00029?crawler=true |publisher=Society of American Foresters |journal=Forest Science |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=374–384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A method of grafting white spruce of seed-bearing age during the time of seed harvest in the fall was developed by Nienstaedt et al. (1958).&lt;ref name="nien1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nienstaedt |first1=H. |last2=Cech |first2=F.C. |last3=Mergen |first3=F. |last4=Wand |first4=C. |last5=Zak |first5=B. |date=1958 |title=Vegetative propagation in forest genetics research and practice |journal=Jour. Forestry |volume=56 |issue=11 |pages=826–839}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scions of white spruce of 2 ages of wood from 30- to 60-year-old trees were collected in the fall and grafted by 3 methods on potted stock to which different day-length treatments had been applied prior to grafting. The grafted stock were given long-day and natural-day treatments. Survival was 70% to 100% and showed effects of rootstock and post-grafting treatments in only a few cases. [[Photoperiodism|Photoperiod]] and temperature treatments after grafting, however, had considerable effect on scion activity and total growth. The best post-grafting treatment was 4 weeks of long-day treatment followed by 2 weeks of short-day treatment, then 8 weeks of chilling, and finally long-day treatment.

Since grafts of white spruce put on relatively little growth in the 2 years after grafting, techniques for accelerating the early growth were studied by Greenwood (1988)&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Greenwood |first1=M.S. |last2=Adams |first2=G.W. |last3=Gillespie |first3=M. |publication-date=1988 |title=Shortening the breeding cycle of some northeastern conifers |pages=43–52 |editor-last1=Morgenstern, |editor-first1=E.K. |editor-last2=Boyle |editor-first2=T.J.B. |conference=Tree Improvement – Progressing Together Sympos. |place=Truro, NS |date=Aug 1987 |book-title=Proc. Part 2, 21st Meet. Can. Tree Improv. Assoc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. The cultural regimes used to promote one additional growth cycle in one year involve manipulation of day length and the use of cold storage to satisfy chilling requirements. Greenwood took dormant potted grafts into the greenhouse in early January then gradually raised the temperature during the course of a week until the minimum temperature rose to 15&amp;nbsp;°C. Photoperiod was increased to 18 hours using [[Incandescence|incandescent]] lighting. In this technique, grafts are grown until elongation has been completed, normally by mid-March. Soluble 10-52-10 fertilizer is applied at both ends of the growth cycle and 20-20-20 during the cycle, with irrigation as needed. When growth elongation is complete, day length is reduced to 8 hours using a blackout curtain. Budset follows, and the grafts are held in the greenhouse until mid-May. Grafts are then moved into a cooler at 4&amp;nbsp;°C for 1000 hours, after which they are moved to a shade frame where they grow normally, with applications of fertilizer and [[irrigation]] as in the first cycle. Grafts are moved into cold frames or unheated greenhouse in September until January. Flower induction treatments are begun on grafts that have reached a minimum length of 1.0 m. Repotting from an initial pot size of 4.5 litre to 16 litre containers with a 2:1:1 soil mix of peat moss, loam, and aggregate.

In one of the first accelerated growth experiments, white spruce grafts made in January and February that would normally elongate shortly after grafting, set bud, and remain in that condition until the following spring, were refrigerated for 500, 1000, or 1500 hours beginning in mid-July, and a non-refrigerated control was held in the nursery.&lt;ref name="green" /&gt; After completion of the cold treatment, the grafts were moved into the greenhouse with an 18-hour photoperiod until late October. Height increment was significantly (P 0.01) influenced by cold treatment. Best results were given by the 1000-hour treatment.&lt;ref name="green" /&gt;

The refrigeration (cold treatment) phase was subsequently shown to be effective when applied 2 months earlier with proper handling and use of blackout curtains, which allows the second growth cycle to be completed in time to satisfy dormancy requirements before January (Greenwood et al. 1988).&lt;ref name="green" /&gt;

==Herbaceous grafting==
Grafting is often done for non-[[Woody plant|woody]] and [[vegetable]] plants ([[tomato]], [[cucumber]], [[eggplant]] and [[watermelon]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Core |first=J. |publication-date=2005 |title=Grafting Watermelon Onto Squash or Gourd Rootstock Makes Firmer, Healthier Fruit |magazine=AgResearch Magazine |volume=53 |issue=7 |url=https://agresearchmag.ars.usda.gov/2005/jul/fruit/ |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tomato grafting]] is very popular in Asia and Europe, and is gaining popularity in the United States.

==History, society and culture==

=== Fertile Crescent ===

As humans began to domesticate plants and animals, horticultural techniques that could reliably propagate the desired qualities of long-lived woody plants needed to be developed. Although grafting isn't specifically mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]], it is claimed that ancient Biblical text hints at the practice of grafting. For example, Leviticus 19:19, which dates to around 1400 BCE, states " ''[the Hebrew people] shalt not sow their field with mingled seed...'' "(King James Bible) Some scholars believe the phrase mingled seeds includes grafting, although this interpretation remains contentious among scholars.

Grafting is also mentioned in the New Testament. In Romans 11, starting at verse 17,  there is a discussion about the grafting of wild olive trees concerning the relationship between Jews and Gentiles.

By 500 BCE grafting was well established and practiced in the region as the [[Mishna]] describes grafting as a commonplace technique used to grow grapevines.&lt;ref name="history_grafting"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mudge |first1=K. |last2=Janick |first2=J. |last3=Scofield |first3=S. |last4=Goldschmidt |first4=E. |date=2009 |title=A History of Grafting |journal=Horticultural Reviews |volume=35 |pages=449–475 |url=https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/pubag/downloadPDF.xhtml?id=39857&amp;content=PDF |format=PDF |doi=10.1002/9780470593776.ch9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===

According to recent research: "grafting technology had been practiced in China before 2000 BC".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Meng |first1=Chao |last2=Xu |first2=Dong |last3=Son |first3=Young-Jun |last4=Kubota |first4=Chieri |title=Simulation-based Economic Feasibility Analysis of Grafting Technology for Propagation Operation|book-title=Proceedings of the 2012 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference |editor-first1=G. |editor-last1=Lim |last-author-amp=yes |editor-first2=J.W. |editor-last2=Herrmann |publisher=Institute of Industrial Engineers |publication-date=2012|url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/6c3b482f80771517ccffca5ac3eced7f/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=51908 |conference=IIE Annual Conference |place=Norcross |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional evidence for grafting in China is found in  Jia Sixie's 6th century CE agricultural treatise ''[[Qimin Yaoshu]] (Essential Skills for the Common People)''.&lt;ref&gt;Shih Sheng-han, ''A Preliminary Survey of the Book Ch'i Min Yao Shu, and Agricultural Encyclopaedia of the 6th Century'' 2nd ed, Beijing: Science Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; It discusses grafting pear twigs onto crab apple, jujube and pomegranate stock (domesticated apples had not yet arrived in China), as well as grafting persimmons. The ''Qimin yaoshu'' refers to older texts that referred to grafting, but those works are missing. Nonetheless, given the sophistication of the methods discussed, and the long history of arboriculture in the region, grafting must have already been practiced for centuries by this time.

=== Greece and Rome, and Islamic Golden Age ===
In Greece, a medical record written in 424 BCE contains the first direct reference to grafting. The title of the work is ''On the Nature of the Child'' and is thought to be written by a follower of [[Hippocrates]]. The language of the author suggests that grafting appeared centuries before this period.

In Rome, Marcus Porcius Cato wrote the oldest surviving Latin text in 160 BCE. The book is called [[De Agri Cultura|''De Agri Cultura (On Farming Agriculture)'']] and outlines several grafting methods. Other authors in the region would write about grafting in the following years, however, the publications often featured fallacious scion-stock combinations.

During the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|European Dark Ages]], Arabic regions were experiencing an [[Islamic Golden Age]] of scientific, technological, and cultural advancement. Creating lavishly flourished gardens would be a common form of competition among Islamic leaders at the time. Because the region would receive an influx of foreign ornamentals to decorate these gardens, grafting was used much during this period.&lt;ref name="history_grafting" /&gt;

=== Europe and the United States ===
[[File:Eglinton fish pond island inosculated Q. petraea.JPG|right|thumb|upright|Possible deliberate grafts on a [[sessile oak]] in [[Eglinton Country Park|Ayrshire]], Scotland]]
After the fall of the [[Roman Empire]], grafting survived in the Christian monasteries of Europe until it regained popular appeal during the [[Renaissance]]. The invention of the [[printing press]] inspired a number of authors to publish books on gardening that included information on grafting. One example, ''A New Orchard and Garden: Or, the Best Way for Planting, Graffing, and to Make Any Ground Good for a Rich Orchard, Particularly in the North'', was written by William Lawson in 1618. While the book contains practical grafting techniques, some even still used today, it suffers from exaggerated claims of scion-stock compatibility typical of this period.

While grafting continued to grow in Europe during the eighteenth century, it was considered unnecessary in the United States as the produce from fruit trees was largely used either to make cider or feed hogs.&lt;ref name="history_grafting" /&gt;

=== French Wine Pandemic === 
Beginning in 1864, without warning grapevines across France began to sharply decline. Thanks to the efforts of scientists such as [[Charles Valentine Riley|C. V. Riley]] and [[Jules Emile Planchon|J. E. Planchon]], the culprit was identified to be [[phylloxera]], an insect that infests the roots of vines and causes fungal infections. Initially, farmers unsuccessfully attempted to contain the pest by removing and burning affected vines. When it was discovered that phylloxera was an invasive species introduced from North America, some suggested importing rootstock from the region as the North American vines were resistant to the pest. Others, opposed to the idea, argued that American rootstocks would imbue the French grapes with an undesirable taste; they instead preferred to inject the soil with expensive pesticides. Ultimately, grafting American rootstock onto French vines became prevalent throughout the region, creating new grafting techniques and machines. American rootstocks had trouble adapting to the high soil pH value of some regions in France so the final solution to the pandemic was to [[hybrid (biology)|hybridize]] the American and French variants.&lt;ref name="history_grafting" /&gt;

'''Hugh Leslie Gibb'''&lt;ref name="district"/&gt; (15 January 1916 – 6 March 1992) was an English drummer and bandleader and the father of English musicians [[Barry Gibb|Barry]], [[Robin Gibb|Robin]], [[Maurice Gibb|Maurice]] and [[Andy Gibb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stason.org/TULARC/music-bands/bee-gees/4-13-When-are-their-families-birthdays-and-anniversaries.html#.UU5P5BeKLaM |title=When are their families' birthdays and anniversaries? (Bee Gees) |publisher=Stason.org |accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Barry, Robin and Maurice would go on to success as the [[Bee Gees]], one of the most successful musical groups in the 1960s and 1970s, while Andy would have several hits as a solo performer.

==Life and career==

===Early life and family background===

Hugh Leslie Gibb was born in [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy|Chorlton]] district in [[Manchester]] to Hugh Gibb and Edith Yardley. He said: "I was the oddball in my family 'cause I liked music and the attitude was that it would never do you any good. The main theme then was go to work, have a steady job, and bring your wages home every weekend. A side track from that wasn't right in their eyes. To be a musician was like the old days, you know, when they were considered vagabonds, and that's all I ever wanted to do."&lt;ref name="district"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KugbDQHX0R8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=fil#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Bee Gees – Tales of the Brothers Gibb |last=Hughes |first=Andrew |accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibb's father was born in [[Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]] in 1876. His mother was born in Manchester in 1892 to William and Hannah. She was 16 years younger than her husband and became step-mother to his seven children he had from his previous marriage, to Annie, who had died in 1889 at the age of 38. Gibb's grandfather, Thomas Yardley, was born in 1826 and is recorded as a railway worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegenealogist.co.uk/featuredarticles/wdytya_robingibb.php |title=Robin Gibb on Genealogist |accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barbara Pass===
Barbara Pass was a dance band vocalist and one of her nights off she went with a friend to another dance hall and she said: "that's where it all started".&lt;ref name="all"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brothersgibb.org/history-part-1.html |title=History Part 1: The Story about the Bee Gees / 1940–1950 |last=Adriaensen |first=Marion |accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh escorted Barbara home that night and thereafter romance blossomed. Despite the nightmare of the war, Hugh has fond memories of the time he met his future wife, as he said: "People enjoyed themselves more. Kids today, think they've done everything by the time they're 18 and have nothing to look forward to.&lt;ref name="district"/&gt; They were married on 27 May 1944 in Manchester. Their first child, Lesley Gibb, was born on 12 January 1945. Shortly afterwards, they moved to [[Scotland]], where his band was starting to play in [[Edinburgh]]; as Barbara explained: "We lived just at the outskirts of Edinburgh". After a while, Hugh and Barbara with Lesley moved back to Manchester and lived with Barbara's mother Nora Pass in [[Stretford]], and then Gibb got a job in the [[Isle of Man]] and they moved to [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]]. Gibb started to play at Douglas Bay Hotel and the Alexandra, both in Douglas.&lt;ref name="all"/&gt;

On 1 September 1946, [[Barry Gibb]] was born at 8:45 am at the Jane Crookall Maternity Home in Douglas. During the same time, Hugh was busy with his music at various hotels in Douglas when Barry was a baby: "I stayed there for [about] 10 years and Joe Loss' band used to be there, that was the big band era".&lt;ref name="district"/&gt; On 22 December 1949, [[Robin Gibb]] was born at 3:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. Later at 3:50&amp;nbsp;a.m., [[Maurice Gibb]] was born at Jane Crookall Maternity Home. In 1955, the Gibbs returned in Manchester area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/62.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1946–1962 |last=Brennan |first=Joseph |accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 March 1958, [[Andy Gibb]] was born in Stretford Memorial Hospital in Manchester.

===Career===
{{quote box|quote= "What dad did, unknowingly, was to play a lot of music that was inspirational to writing, I would say [[the Mills Brothers]], regarding my dad's input from them to us, was probably when you are on stage, smile. If you feel like crap and look like crap, people will feel like crap too. Dad would always be down the back holding a smiley face because that's what the Mills Brothers did. I really did think that Dad wanted us to be little white Mills Brothers".&lt;ref name="district"/&gt;|source= —Maurice Gibb |width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}
His band the Hughie Gibb Orchestra was firmly ensconced on the circuit of Mecca ballrooms, playing mainly in [[Northern England]] and [[Scotland]]. After Barry was born, Hugh was busy with his music at various hotels in Douglas when Barry was a baby: "I stayed there for [about] 10 years and Joe Loss' band used to be there, that was the big band era". Rosalia Black, who was the daughter of the hotel owner, Carlo Raineri recalls "the band must have been popular because the ballroom was always packed, even though the [[Joe Loss]] Orchestra was at the Villa Marina and [[Ronnie Aldrich]] with the Squadronaires was at the Palace Ballroom".&lt;ref name="district"/&gt;

Hugh was always on the lookout for work. Even as an extremely popular musician, he did not earn very much, and he often put together bands for one-off gigs, one such dance might have been the Invitation Dinner Dance held at London's [[Metropole Hotel, London|Metropole Hotel]] on 24 February 1949, the reception was at 7:00 PM, the title of the show was 'Hughie Gibb and his Music', entertaining the people until 1:00 AM.&lt;ref name="district"/&gt;

Hugh didn't actually play on board the ferry, and his band was not paid by Douglas Corporation, who ran the ferry. Apart from trumpeter Charlie Whewell, others who played on Hugh's band, his band in 1946, the line-up consisted of Arthur Crawford (accordion), [[Jim Caine (jazz pianist)|Jim Caine]] (piano), Tommy Cowley (bass), Albert Metcalfe (tenor saxophone) and John Knight (trombone).&lt;ref name="district"/&gt;

Aside from being a musician, Hugh's work at day was delivering bread as their neighbour Joan Hill said: "We were all very poor in those days and Mr. Gibb was a godsend, He used to bring home dozens of loaves that had to be sold before the end of the day, bread must have been much more wholesome in those days, didn't have all the preservatives it does today. Hugh would then be able to sell these off to neighbors at a fraction of the normal cost." Hugh musical background is credited as the Bee Gees' inspiration to follow a musical career, his influence on his sons was actually more indirect.&lt;ref name="district"/&gt;

Hugh credited his wife's sister, Peggy, with the idea of emigrating to Australia, as she eventually did with her family, though it was his family that migrated first. Later, he and Barbara applied for passage to Australia but did little to prepare for the move as Hugh said: "Because they say, don't dispose of your property until you know what you're doing. Sometimes you have to wait two years, we got it in six weeks." At the beginning of August 1958, the family set sail for Australia.&lt;ref name="district"/&gt;

When the family arrived in [[Queensland]], Hugh found work as a "bush photographer". His photography assignments were not as frequent as he would have liked, so he took on extra work for Scarborough local council.&lt;ref name="district"/&gt;

Hugh remembers that the group's break came when television was started in Brisbane around 1960: "We auditioned for one of the variety shows, anything goes right way, they signed us".{{Clarify|date=January 2014|reason=Was this nonsense really verbatim? What does it mean, and what happened?}} When the family moved back to Britain{{Clarify|date=January 2014|reason=Why, all of a sudden, are they moving back to Britain, and who cares what time it was?}}, on 7 February 1967, at 7:40 in the morning, the phone rang. [[Robert Stigwood]], [[Brian Epstein]]'s partner, said "Look we've been doing a lot of reshuffling in the office here, and we've just come across the acetate you sent us, and we played it. Could you come along and see us this afternoon?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Bee Gees|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AvpBAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WaoMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2656,3236283|accessdate=19 January 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph Herald|date=22 July 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=January 2014|reason=And then what happened? Why are they moving to Spain?}} By November 1971, Hugh and Barbara moved to [[Ibiza]], Spain with Andy and adopted daughter, Beri.

===Later years and death===

After Andy Gibb's death in 1988, Hugh lost interest in his life. On 6 March 1992, one day after what would have been Andy Gibb's 34th birthday, Hugh died of internal bleeding at the age of 76. Hugh lies buried in the same cemetery as Andy in the Court of Remembrance section, [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]], Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="angeles"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OvYUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT328&amp;dq=eyes+that+see+in+the+dark+kenny+rogers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VgWwUsTMIae6iAfyqID4Cg&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=eyes%20that%20see%20in%20the%20dark%20kenny%20rogers&amp;f=false The Bee Gees: The Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; Barry Gibb's reaction was "I believe all this was meant to happen, I miss my father of course, but he stopped living when Andy died and I'm sure he's happier now".&lt;ref name="angeles"/&gt;&lt;!--There is, remarkably, almost no online evidence of Hugh Gibb's death. One book gets the date wrong (5 March), countered by the pic of his gravemarker at FindAGrave. Hard to imagine there was _no_ news coverage--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12225">'''Hugo Count Logothetti''' (2 October 1852 in [[Klausenburg]] –  3 Augustus 1918 in [[Teheran]]) was an Austrian-Hungarian diplomat of [[Greeks|Greek]] ancestry and the last emissary of the [[Habsburg monarchy]] in Teheran.

== Descent ==
[[File:Obraz 22 erb rakousko.jpg|thumb|left|Arms of the Logothetti lineage]]
Hugo II Count Logothetti originated from an old [[Byzantine]] lineage which claimed its origin in the Byzantine Emperor [[Nikephoros I Logothetes]] (reigned 802-811) and settled on the Ionian island of Zante ([[Zakynthos]]) after the [[fall of Constantinople]] (1453).&lt;ref&gt;Eugène Rizo-Rangabé, ''Livre d'Or de la Noblesse Ionienne, Vol. III. Zante,'' Maison d'Editions "Eleftheroudakis", Athènes 1927, 111&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century a descendant, an officer of the [[Venetian Republic]], Giacomo (James) Conte Logothetti (1741–1802) went to the [[principality of Moldavia]]. After the annexation of the [[Bukovina]] he became an Austrian citizen. His descendants played an important role in the defence of this most eastern Austrian province and were counted among the honorables of its capital Czernowitz (nowadays: [[Chernivtsi]], Чернівці, Ukraine). In 1830, after his marriage with Pauline Baroness Bartenstein, a direct offspring of the chancellor of the Empress [[Maria-Theresa]], [[Johann Christoph von Bartenstein]], Hugo’s grandfather [[Hugo I Logothetti]] (1801–1861) bought the manors [[Bílovice (Uherské Hradiště District)|Bilovice]] and Březolupy near the South Moravian town of Uherské Hradiště. He was known as Maecenas of the Czech painter [[w:de:Josef Mánes|Josef Mánes]] (1820–1871) from whom he commissioned a portrait of Veruna Čudová. This painting is nowadays the best known genre piece of Mánes. Hugo II was born 2 October 1852 in Klausenburg (the present Cluj-Napoca in Rumania) where his father [[Vladimir Logothetti|Vladimir Count Logothetti]] (1822–1892) was serving as an officer in the army. Because his mother descended from high [[Transylvania|Transylvanian]] nobility (Nemes de Hidvég) with a palace and houses in Klausenburg, Hugo was baptized in the Roman Catholic cathedral of Klausenburg. In 1858 the family returned to Bilovice.

== Career ==

After secondary school in Uherské Hradiště, Hugo II entered the 54th Regiment of the Line in Olomouc as a volunteer, but had to quit service due to poor health in 1871. He then went to Vienna to study (1872–1877) at the Oriental Academy, the forerunner of the present [[Diplomatic Academy of Vienna|Diplomatic Academy]], founded by the Empress Maria Theresa. Logothetti had an aptitude for languages and learned Arabic, Persian and Turkish. His first foreign post after his study was in [[Constantinople]], then one of the most important foreign missions of [[Austria-Hungary]]. 

Logothetti’s further career was typical for a gifted diplomat: consul-elève in [[Constantinople]] 1877-1880, consul-elève in [[Alexandria]] (Egypt) 1880-1882, deputy consul in Alexandria in 1882, in the same year consul in Port Said. In 1883 he became emissary of Austria-Hungary in the compensation commission in Alexandria. From September 1883 he was attaché in Constantinople, where in 1866 he became embassy secretary and became acquainted with the Austrian-Hungarian diplomat Julius baron Zwiedinek von Südenhorst (1833–1918), his later father-in-law.

On 17 July 1886 Logothetti married Frieda Barbara Baroness Zwiedinek von Südenhorst (1866–1945) in the [[Church of St. Mary Draperis, Istanbul|church of St. Maria Draperis]] in the European quarter of Constantinople, Pera. In 1889 Logothetti was named judge of first instance in the International Tribunal in Alexandria. He held this function till 1897 when he became consul-general of Austria-Hungary in Rumania at Galati where he was at the same time Austrian-Hungarian emissary in the [[Commissions of the Danube River|European Danube Commission]]. From 1899 till 1906 he was consul-general in [[Barcelona]], 1906-1907 consul in [[Milan]], 1907-1911 consul in [[Hamburg]], 1911-1912 consul-general in [[Tunis]].

Because of growing tension in the [[Balkans]] and the Near East it was necessary to provide the legation in Persia with an experienced diplomat with good knowledge of land and language. The new Austrian-Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Leopold Berchtold]] (1863–1942) named Logothetti on 12 May 1912 as k. u. k. extraordinary plenipotentiary minister and envoy in Teheran. It was on this occasion that the official portrait was painted. Logothetti was a relative of the minister through his grandmother, Karolina Countess Berchtold.

Great-Britain and Russia divided Persia into spheres of influence in 1906 – the Russians were in northern Persia, the British in southeast Persia bounded by British India. In the west the Ottoman Empire tried to gain some influence in Persia. In a secret treaty (1907) Great-Britain and Russia tried to give an official status under international law to this situation. The Persians reacted, however, with a [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|constitutional]] revolution (March/April 1912) that was crushed with Russian and British military aid. Nevertheless, the new Persian government tried to stay at least officially neutral in [[World War I]].

On 4 November 1912 Logothetti presented his credentials to the [[Ahmad Shah Qajar|Shah]] and began his service in Teheran. He had the task of defending Persian neutrality against all efforts of Russia and Great-Britain to get Persia on their side, as well to defend Austrian-Hungarian interests in the Near East.[[File:Frieda Countess Logothetti Zwiedinek.jpg|thumb|left|Frieda Countess Logothetti née Baroness Zwiedinek of Südenhorst]][[File:Hugo II Logothetti.jpg|thumb|alt=Hugo II Count Logothetti, painting from 1912 by Karel Žádník, since 1945 in possession of the Slovácké muzeum, Uherské Hradiště|Hugo II Logothetti]]

When the war broke out in 1914 Logothetti was on leave in Moravia. He left his family at home and returned alone to Teheran where he was arrested – against all diplomatic customs – by the Russians who deprived him of all money and sent him through Sweden back to Europe. On 27 April 1915 Logothetti returned to Teheran. After a failed putsch initiated by the German embassy (August 1915) and a German attempt to set up in Persia and Afghanistan a front against British India the situation in Persia became quite unsure for diplomats of the Central Powers. Most governments called their envoys back and thus after 1916 Logothetti was practically the only Central diplomat service in Persia. He survived several assaults on his person (1916, 1917) nearly unharmed.

In January 1918 the new Persian government tried to restore effective Persian neutrality. After the [[Russian revolution]] of 1917 and the departure of Russian troops from northern Persia, Logothetti tried to free all prisoners of war of Austrian-Hungarian origin in Russian-Turkoman concentration camps in order to get them to Persia and through Constantinople back to Europe. These efforts had partly succeeded when Logothetti died suddenly and mysteriously on 3 August 1918 (presumably of [[arsenic poisoning]]). He was buried in the French mission church.

== Family ==
[[File:Bilovice slot juli-1911.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Manor Bilovice, photo by Willem-Bernard Engelbrecht, July 1911|Bilovice Estate]]
Logothetti had with his spouse Frieda (died 1945) 10 children of whom three died young. The eldest daughters Marie-Rose Countess Logothetti (1888–1976) and Caroline (Lola) Countess Logothetti (1891–1978) married diplomats – Marie-Rose with the Italian envoy Giulio Cesare Cavagliere Montagna (1874–1954), Lola  with the Dutch consul Willem-Bernard Engelbrecht (1881–1955). Hermine (Meta) married with the Hungarian judge Géza de Ertsey and the youngest daughter Carmen with the Moravian engineer Lothar Schmid. The eldest son Felix served as Austrian-Hungarian army officer (rittmaster) and married Countess Stella Barbo von Waxenstein, the daughter of Count [[Josef Anton Barbo von Waxenstein]]. In 1942 Felix, his wife and his son Deodat were murdered during a fight between Communist Jugoslavian partisans with Italian occupation troops on the hereditary castle of the [[Barbo von Waxenstein (family)|family Barbo]], [[Slovenska Vas, Šentrupert#Wazenberg_Castle|Watzenberg Manor (Castello Dob)]] in present Slovenia. The second son Hugo III Count Logothetti (1901–1975) stayed till 1945 on the Moravian family estate Bilovice as did the youngest, Emanuel (1907–1990), who was up till 1938 a civil servant of the Czechoslovak Republic and after 1945 Secretary of State of Bavaria for refugee aid.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4714">'''Human-rating certification''', also known as '''man-rating''', is the certification of a [[spacecraft]] or [[launch vehicle]] as capable of safely transporting humans. (Since the 1990s, NASA and the U.S. [[GAO]] prefer to use "human-rating" instead of "man-rating" when describing requirements for these systems.)

According to [[NASA]], human-rating requires not just that a system is designed to be tolerant of failure and to protect the crew even if unrecoverable failure occurs, but also that astronauts aboard a human-rated spacecraft must have some control over it.&lt;ref name="H"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?t=NPR&amp;c=8705&amp;s=2C |title=Human Rating Requirements for Space Systems |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set of technical requirements and the associated certification process for crewed space systems is required in addition to the standards and requirements that are mandatory for all of NASA's space flight programs.&lt;ref name="H" /&gt;

==NASA Commercial Crew Program==
In November 2011, [[Ed Mango (NASA)|Ed Mango]], the agency head of the NASA [[Commercial Crew Program]] (CCP), gave an extended interview on the new NASA requirements for human rating of spacecraft that will fly to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS).&lt;ref name=a&amp;ss20111116&gt;
{{cite news |last=Chaikin|first=Andrew|title=Certified Safe:  Planning to operate a taxi service for NASA astronauts? Here’s what’s required. |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/space-exploration/Certified-Safe.html |accessdate=2011-11-27 |newspaper=Air &amp; Space Smithsonian |date=2011-11-16 |quote=''we've separated [the “loss of crew” criteria] into what you need for ascent and what you need for entry. For ascent it’s 1 in 500, and independently for entry it’s 1 in 500. ... The probability for the mission itself is 1 in 270. That is an overall number. That’s loss of crew for the entire mission profile, including ascent, on-orbit, and entry. The thing that drives the 1 in 270 is really micrometeorites and orbital debris ... whatever things that are in space that you can collide with. So that’s what drops that number down, because you’ve got to look at the 210 days, the fact that your heat shield or something might be exposed to whatever that debris is for that period of time. NASA looks at Loss of Vehicle the same as Loss of Crew.  If the vehicle is damaged and it may not be detected prior to de-orbit, then you have loss of crew.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NASA CCP human-rating standards require that the [[probability]] of a loss on ascent is no more than 1 in 500, and that the probability of a loss on descent is no more than 1 in 500.  The overall mission loss risk, which includes vehicle risk from [[micrometeorite]]s and [[space debris|orbital debris]] while in orbit for up to 210 days, is required to be no more than 1 in 270.&lt;ref name=a&amp;ss20111116/&gt;  Maximum sustained [[g-force|G-loads]] are limited to three [[Gravity of Earth|Earth-standard g's]].&lt;ref name=a&amp;ss20111116/&gt;

The development of the [[Space Shuttle]] and the [[International Space Station]] pre-dates the NASA Human-Rating requirements. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Columbia]] accidents, the criteria used by NASA for human-rating spacecraft have been made more stringent.&lt;ref name=ulaCrew/&gt;

The [[United Launch Alliance]] (ULA) published{{when|date=November 2011}} a paper submitted to [[AIAA]] detailing the modifications to its [[Delta IV]] and [[Atlas V]] launch vehicles that would be needed to conform to NASA Standard 8705.2B.&lt;ref name=ulaCrew&gt;
{{Cite web |url=https://www.ulalaunch.com/docs/default-source/human-rating/human-rating-atlas-v-and-delta-iv.pdf |title = Atlas and Delta Capabilities to Launch Crew to Low Earth Orbit |date=n.d. |publisher=United Launch Alliance |accessdate=2011-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
ULA has since been awarded $6.7 million under NASA's [[Commercial Crew Development]] (CCDev) program for development of an [[Emergency Detection System]], one of the final pieces that would be needed to make these launchers suitable for human spaceflight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA and ULA confirm Atlas V baseline for human rated launches|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/07/nasa-ula-confirm-atlas-v-baseline-human-rated-launches/|website=NASASpaceflight.com|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Vaudain Creely''' (November 14, 1839 – declared dead September 28, 1900) was an Independent Republican member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[Pennsylvania]].  He disappeared while serving in Congress and was later declared legally dead.

==Biography==
John Creely was born in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] where he was educated.  He graduated from [[Central High School (Philadelphia)|Central High School]], studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1862, and practiced in Philadelphia.  During the [[American Civil War]] he served with the [[Union Army]] as an officer of Keystone Battery, Pennsylvania Light Artillery Regiment.  Originally commissioned a first lieutenant in 1862, he later received promotion to captain as commander of the battery before leaving the military in 1867.

==Political career==
Creely was a member of the [[Philadelphia City Council]] from 1867 to 1871.  He was elected to Congress as Independent Republican in [[United States House election, 1870|1870]], and served in the [[42nd United States Congress]].  However, Creely seems to have rarely carried out his congressional duties, and appears only once in the ''Congressional Globe Index'', a predecessor to the ''[[Congressional Record]]'', for having taken part in a ceremonial vote at the beginning of Congressional term.  He did not receive his pay, which remained with the House Sergeant at Arms.

In 1872 Creely was sued for legal malpractice, accused of misappropriating a client's stock certificates and using them as a security for a loan which he did not repay.  He was subsequently accused of additional financial misdeeds, which could have played a part in his subsequent disappearance.

==Disappearance and declaration of death==
According to court documents his sister Adelaide filed when she requested that he be declared legally dead, in August or September 1872 Creely departed Philadelphia for Washington in preparation for the start of a Congressional session in December, and later informed his sister and mother that he was going to board a ship for [[New Orleans]].  He was not heard from again, and investigations by his family failed to determine his whereabouts or how he had come to disappear.

Investigators found that his suitcases and other personal belongings were still in his Washington boarding house room, making it unlikely that he had sailed to New Orleans.  Despite this discovery, his mother and sister later searched for him in New Orleans, most major U.S. cities, and locations as far away as [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[South America]], but found no trace.

Creely's mother died in 1897, after which his sister applied to have him declared legally dead.  On September 28, 1900 the orphans' court of Philadelphia made the declaration, and his sister received his estate, consisting chiefly of the Congressional pay Creely had never claimed.

==Subsequent efforts to locate==
In 1927, as the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Printing|Joint Committee on Printing]] prepared to reprint the ''[[Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]],'' one clerk went through extensive research to obtain more information about Creely's fate, including writing to men with whom he served during the Civil War. One response the clerk received stated, "He [Creely] was a splendid soldier, with a fine record and was honorably discharged at the end of his term of service . . . He went to Washington and that was the last time I, or any of his friends, ever heard of him. He never came back to Philadelphia, and disappeared utterly."

'''Juan Manuel''' "'''Juanma'''" '''López Rivera''' (born June 30, 1983) is a Puerto Rican [[professional boxer]]. He is a former world champion in two [[weight class (boxing)|weight classes]], having held the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] [[junior featherweight]] title from 2008 to 2009, and the WBO [[featherweight]] title from 2010 to 2011. As an [[amateur boxing|amateur]] he represented Puerto Rico at numerous international tournaments, including the [[2002 Central American and Caribbean Games]], the [[2003 Pan American Games]], and the [[2004 Olympics]]. López was considered a [[knockout]] artist at his peak in the late 2000s and early 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;Raskin, Eric (2010-10-23).

== Amateur career ==
López started boxing when he was ten years old. He won the Puerto Rican national amateur championship for five consecutive years between 2000 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hbo.com/boxing/events/2008/0607_pavlik_lockett/index.html| title=Championship Action on the Broadwalk: Kelly Pavlik vs. Gary Lockett and Daniel Ponce De Leon vs. Juan Manuel López| publisher=[[HBO]] Boxing| accessdate=2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; López represented Puerto Rico internationally, fighting in the [[bantamweight]] division ({{convert|119|lb|kg}} in the amateur circuit). In the 2001 Pan American Championships held in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], on August 10&amp;ndash;18, López ended in the second place after [[Elio Rojas]] of the [[Dominican Republic]]. He was part of the national team assembled to compete in the [[Boxing at the 2002 Central American and Caribbean Games|2002]] [[2002 Central American and Caribbean Games|Central American and Caribbean Games]], held in [[San Salvador]]. In this competition, López debuted by defeating local pugilist Antonio Nuñez by points (23:16), but lost a decision to [[Abner Mares]] of [[Mexico]], with scores of 23:19. In the first 2003 Pan American qualifier, López debuted by defeating Francisco Palma of [[Ecuador]], with scores of 12:8. In the semifinals, he lost to [[Alexander Espinoza]] of [[Venezuela]] by points (11:10). His next major international event was the [[Boxing at the 2003 Pan American Games|2003]] [[2003 Pan American Games|Pan American Games]], organized in [[Santo Domingo]]. Debuting in the preliminaries, López defeated Castulo González of [[Guatemala]] by points (27:10) in the inaugural fight. In the quarterfinals, he was matched against Mares, losing another fight by points, on this occasion with results of 24:21. López was among the Puerto Rican boxers that competed in the American Olympic qualification tournament, which took place in [[Tijuana]]. He began his participation on March 14, 2004, by defeating Roberto Benítez of the [[United States]] via decision. In the tournament's second date, he defeated Algenis Méndez, who represented the Dominican Republic, by points.

The first round began with both boxers circling around the ring, studying their respective opponent.&lt;ref name="Concepción"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.primerahora.com/deportes/boxeo/nota/juanmanuellopezversusbernabeconcepcionroundporround-399715.html| title=Juan Manuel López versus Bernabé Concepción: Round por round| author=Carlos González| publisher=''[[Primera Hora (Guaynabo)|Primera Hora]]''| language=Spanish| date=2010-07-10| accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an exchange Concepción received a left hook that forced him to fall back against the ropes, López then engaged on the offensive, scoring a knockdown. This pattern continued, with Concepción staying on the offensive until he was able to counter and score a knockdown.&lt;ref name="Concepción"/&gt; López began the second round more aggressive, scoring two consecutive knockdowns, which prompted the referee to stop the fight by technical knockout.&lt;ref name="Concepción"/&gt;

With this outcome, previous negotiations with Rafael Márquez's camp continued, pursuing an autumn date for the contest. September 18, 2010, was the original scheluded date, but an injury suffered by Márquez during training forced posponement. The event was re-scheluded for November 6, 2010. López won the fight by a TKO in the 9th round, when Márquez refused to come back to fight due to an injured shoulder.

On April 16, 2011, he lost the WBO title to [[Orlando Salido]] via technical knockout, as the referee stopped the fight in the 8th round. The bout was held in Bayamon, Puerto Rico. The outcome of the fight was a huge upset. It was the first loss of López' career. On March 10, 2012, he lost again to Orlando Salido in a rematch by 10th-round technical knockout in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Lopez's excuse was that he could've continued to fight and that the referee only stopped the fight in that scenario because he had a bet placed on Salido to win the fight.

Then after almost 11 months of inactivity from the ring, Lopez finally returned to face Aldimar Silva on February 2, 2013. Lopez showed no signs of ring rust, dominating Silva from start to finish, before ultimately winning the fight by TKO in the ninth round. Just nearly 3 months later, he then faced Eugenio Lopez in Mexico on April 20, 2013. His fight Eugenio proved to be even easier than his destruction over Aldimar Silva when Lopez defeated him via lop-sided second-round knock-out.

== Personal life ==
López had a relationship with Bárbara De Jesús that lasted nine years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Premiado por el amor unánime| author=Yaritza Rivas| publisher=''[[El Nuevo Día]]''| language=Spanish| location=Puerto Rico| date=2008-05-10| quote=Los hijos del dúo, que aún no se ha casado, van hasta a la pista en las noches.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple has two children, which share the house with three siblings. The couple met in a public housing project in Juncos where López's mother lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Premiado por el amor unánime| author=Yaritza Rivas| publisher=''[[El Nuevo Día]]''| language=Spanish| location=Puerto Rico| date=2008-05-10| quote=El éxito familiar y profesional del joven boxeador descansa en gran parte sobre los hombros de su pareja Bárbara. Se conocieron hace ocho años cuando ella vivía en el residencial Antulio López en Juncos. “La mamá de ‘Juanma’ era mi vecina”, dice Bárbara}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning López's family did not support the relationship because De Jesús had three children from a previous relation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Premiado por el amor unánime| author=Yaritza Rivas| publisher=''[[El Nuevo Día]]''| language=Spanish| location=Puerto Rico| date=2008-05-10| quote=Al principio la familia de ‘Juanma’ no vio la relación con buenos ojos. “Yo tenía tres hijos”, recuerda la joven madre sobre la reacción de la familia del boxeador, la cual aseguró entendió en su momento.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually moved together and established a residence in Caguas. De Jesús played a role in López's training, preparing seven daily meals and accompanying him in weight routines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Premiado por el amor unánime| author=Yaritza Rivas| publisher=''[[El Nuevo Día]]''| language=Spanish| location=Puerto Rico| date=2008-05-10| quote=En la mañana inicia el circuito que empieza por llevar los chicos a la escuela, hacerle cada una de las comidas y meriendas a ‘Juanma’ (cerca de siete). Tres veces por semana Bárbara se une a ‘Juanma’, en la rutina de pesas. Las tardes en el gimnasio, la cena, pista... en fin una carrera de campeonato.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several members of their family used to attend his daily trainings, which he considered a "tranquility provider".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Premiado por el amor unánime| author=Yaritza Rivas| publisher=''[[El Nuevo Día]]''| language=Spanish| location=Puerto Rico| date=2008-05-10| quote=“Yo creo que eso es lo que me distrae. No me hace pensar tanto y estar tan tenso en el deporte”, confiesa ‘Juanma’. ¿Son un relajante? le pregunta El Nuevo Día. “Definitivamente”, contesta.}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Jesús also used to be present in López's corner during fights, and received a salary for scheduling his daily agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Premiado por el amor unánime| author=Yaritza Rivas| publisher=''[[El Nuevo Día]]''| language=Spanish| location=Puerto Rico| date=2008-05-10| quote=Además de cuidar de su familia y hacer sus dietas.

On February, 2011, only 7 months after his wedding, López filed a divorce claim against Bárbara De Jesús for undisclosed reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Juanma se divorcia| publisher=''[[El Nuevo Día]]''| language=Spanish| location=Puerto Rico| chapter=Deportes| date=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, López started a relationship with Geraldine Crespo, whom she had met while training at the gym. In February 2013, the couple got engaged after his fight with [[Aldimar Silva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/deportes/boxeo/nota/juanmalopeznotieneprisaporcasarse-1442626/|title=Juanma López no tiene prisa por casarse|publisher=''[[El Nuevo Día]]''|author=|date=February 6, 2013|accessdate=November 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple married in August 2014 in a private wedding in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeta93.lamusica.com/noticias-y-farandula/juanma-lopez-se-caso-con-geraldine-crespo-el-pasado-fin-de-semana|title=Juanma López se casó con Geraldine Crespo|publisher=Z93|date=August 26, 2014|accessdate=November 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 31, 2015, Crespo presented a [[domestic abuse]] complaint against López after he allegedly hit her in the face after an argument. López went to court the next day and was released after paying bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/deportes/boxeo/nota/desarmadoycongrilleteelectronicojuanmalopez-212030 |title=Desarmado y con grillete electrónico Juanma López |publisher=''[[El Nuevo Día]]'' |author= |date=November 1, 2015 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

López's professional success garnered him fame in Puerto Rico where he became a mainstream celebrity, having frequent participation in television segments transmitted throughout the archipelago. Due to this, he has attended public celebrations and other activities unrelated to pugilism, including the launch party for ''TV y Novelas Puerto Rico'', a magazine focused in [[telenovela]]s. Outside of his own fights, López also attends other boxing cards as a spectator and performed as guest commentator in an event titled ''Guerra Civil II'' headlined by a fight between [[Iván Calderón (boxer)|Iván Calderón]] and [[Nelson Dieppa]]. He also participates in charity work, including the WBO's Christmas gift giveaways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.notifight.com/artman2/publish/Comunicado_25/La_OMB_reparte_bicicletas_y_juguetes_en_PR.php| title=¡La OMB reparte bicicletas y juguetes en PR!| publisher=NotiFight.com| language=Spanish| date=2008-12-31| accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2739">'''Ken Regan''' (June 15, c. 1940s – November 25, 2012) was an American photojournalist from [[the Bronx]], [[New York City]] whose reputation for discretion allowed him close connections with subjects including many musicians, politicians and celebrities. He was the official photographer for the [[Rolling Stones]] on several tours in the 1970s. He also was the photojournalist on Bob Dylan’s Rolling Thunder Revue tour in 1975 and the Live Aid concert in 1985.&lt;ref name="morr_KenR"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Ken Regan Photography| work = Morrison Hotel Gallery| accessdate = 2018-03-10| url = https://www.morrisonhotelgallery.com/photographers/X2T0y4/Ken-Regan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyti_KenR"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Ken Regan, Photojournalist Celebrities Trusted, Is Dead| last = Vitello | first = Paul| work = The New York Times| date = 30 November 2012| accessdate = 2018-03-10| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/01/arts/ken-regan-photojournalist-celebrities-trusted-is-dead.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regan was the unofficial personal photographer of Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] in the last four decades of Kennedy's life. Regan documented Christopher Reeve’s homecoming from rehabilitation after Reeve's 1995 horse accident which left the actor paralyzed. He photographed local politicians including [[Meade Esposito]].&lt;ref name="nyti_KenR"/&gt;

Regan worked with Palace Press Inside Editions on a book called ''Knockout: The Art of Boxing''.&lt;ref name="gq.c_KenR"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Ken Regan Interview on Rock Photography| last = Fennessey | first = Sean| work = GQ| date = 2011-10-12| accessdate = 2018-03-10| url = https://www.gq.com/story/ken-regan-all-access-rock-photography-interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21319">'''Lisette Model''' (born '''Elise Amelie Felicie Stern'''; November 10, 1901 – March 30, 1983) was an Austrian-born American photographer. Primarily known for the frank humanism of her [[street photography]], exact details of Model's life remain unclear. What is known is that she was well known and respected in photographic communities during her life.{{according to whom|date=September 2017}} She taught at the New School for Social Research in New York from 1951 up until her death in 1983 with many notable students, the most famous of which was Diane Arbus.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brucesilverstein.com/artists/lisette-model|title=Lisette Model – Artists – Bruce Silverstein|last=exhibit-e.com|website=www.brucesilverstein.com|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work has been shown in numerous exhibitions and still resides in several permanent collections, including that of the National Gallery of Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artist.php?iartistid=3779|title=Lisette Model|website=www.gallery.ca|language=en-ca|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the J.

Paul Getty in Los Angeles|language=en|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Lisette Model was born Elise Amelie Felicie Stern&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/print/coll/womphotoj/modelessay.html|title=Women Photojournalists: Lisette Model (1901–1983) – Introduction &amp; Biographical Essay (Prints and Photographs Reading Room, Library of Congress)|website=www.loc.gov|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.modernamuseet.se/stockholm/en/exhibitions/arbus-model-stromholm/lisette-model/|title=Lisette Model – Moderna Museet i Stockholm|work=Moderna Museet i Stockholm|access-date=2017-03-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]]. Her father, Victor, was an Italian/Austrian doctor of [[Jewish]] descent attached to the Austro-Hungarian Imperial and Royal Army and, later, to the International Red Cross; her mother Felicie was French and [[Roman Catholic]], and Model was [[baptised]] into her mother's faith. She had a brother, Salvatór, who was older by one year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Two years after her birth, her parents changed their family name to ''[[Seybert]],'' and six years later, her younger sister Olga was born.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to interview testimony from her older brother, she was sexually molested by her father, though the full extent of his abuse remains unclear.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

She was primarily educated by a series of private tutors, achieving fluency in three languages. At age 19, she began studying music with composer (and father of her childhood friend Gertrude&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/print/coll/womphotoj/modelessay.html#note2|title=Women Photojournalists: Lisette Model (1901–1983) – Introduction &amp; Biographical Essay (Prints and Photographs Reading Room, Library of Congress)|website=www.loc.gov|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;) [[Arnold Schönberg]], and was familiar to members of his circle. "If ever in my life I had one teacher and one great influence, it was Schönberg," she said.

Model left Vienna for Paris after her father's death in 1924 to study voice with Polish soprano [[Marya Freund]]. It was during this period that she met her future husband, the Jewish, Russian-born painter [[Evsa Model]] (1901–1976), whom she went on to marry in 1937. In 1933, she gave up music and recommitted herself to studying visual art, at first taking up painting as a student of [[Andre Lhote]] (whose other students included [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]] and [[George Hoyningen-Huene]]).

== First photographs ==
Model bought her first enlarger and camera when she went to Italy. She had little training or interest in photography initially; it was Olga who taught her the basics of photographic technique. Model was most interested in the darkroom process, and wanted to become a darkroom technician. She used her sister as a subject to start her photography. Rogi André later showed Model how to use the [[Rolleiflex]],&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lisette Mode|last=Thomas|first=Ann|publisher=Ottawa : National Gallery of Canada.|year=1990|isbn=978-0-88884-606-8|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; expanding her practice.

Visiting her mother in Nice in 1934 (she and Olga had emigrated from Vienna several years prior), Model took her camera out on the [[Promenade des Anglais]] and made a series of portraits – published in 1935 in the leftist magazine ''Regards''&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; – which are still among her most widely reproduced and exhibited images. These close-cropped, often clandestine portraits of the local privileged class already bore what would become her signature style: close-up, unsentimental and unretouched expositions of vanity, insecurity and loneliness. Model's compositions and closeness to her subjects were achieved by enlarging and cropping her negatives in the darkroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Starr|first1=Lori|title=Lisette Model: Daring to See Opens August 6 at The Getty Museum|agency=The J. Paul Getty Museum|date=May 14, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, her use of a 2 1/4 inch square negative and larger print size were stylistic choices considered unique at a time when a proliferation of street photographers were embracing what was called the minicam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bunnell|first1=Peter C.|title=Lisette Model: An Aperture Monograph. Preface by Berenice Abbott.|journal=The Print Collector's Newsletter|date=July–August 1980|issue=3|pages=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later examination of her negatives by archivists reveals that the uncropped images include much of the subjects' physical surroundings. Model's edits in the darkroom eliminate those distractions, tightening the focus on the person and excluding extraneous background information.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; After the publication of the Promenade des Anglais images, or the "Riviera" series, Model resumed her Paris street photography practice, this time focusing on the poor.

== Later work and controversy ==
After emigrating to [[Manhattan]] in 1937 with her husband, Model worked as a photographer for ''PM'' magazine and was regularly published in [[Harper's Bazaar]] by editors [[Carmel Snow]] and [[Alexey Brodovitch]]. She was captivated by the energy of New York City, which she expressed through her separate series ''Reflections'' and ''Running Legs.'' She also took particular interest in distinct areas of the city, specifically the Lower East Side and Coney Island, where she made hundreds of photographs depicting ordinary American people.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Model eventually became a member of the New York [[Photo League]] and studied with [[Sid Grossman]] until the League's demise in 1951. During its existence, Model was an active League member and served as a judge in membership print competitions. In 1941, the League hosted her first solo exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/onlinecollection/collection_results.php?artistlist=1&amp;aid=6091|title=Lisette Model|website=The Jewish Museum |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130416031537/http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/onlinecollection/collection_results.php?artistlist=1&amp;aid=6091 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 16, 2013 |accessdate=April 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1941 to 1953, she was a freelance photographer and contributed to many publications including [[Harper's Bazaar]], [[Look (American magazine)|Look]], and [[Ladies' Home Journal]].

Model's involvement with the New York Photo League became the cause of much strife for her during the McCarthy Era of the 1950s, when the organization came under scrutiny by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] for suspected connections to the [[Communist Party]]. The League was eventually classified as a communist organization by the FBI, who interviewed Model personally in 1954 and attempted to recruit her as an informant. She refused to cooperate with the Bureau, leading to her name being placed on the National Security Watchlist.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Because many clients were reluctant to hire somebody who was under FBI suspicion, Model encountered increased difficulty finding opportunities to work, which played a role in her focus shift towards teaching.

== Teaching ==
Model embarked on a prolific teaching career in the latter half of her life, both institutionally and in private. In 1947, she taught photography at the [[San Francisco Institute of Fine Arts]]. In 1951, Model was invited to teach at the [[The New School|New School for Social Research]] in New York City, where her longtime friend [[Berenice Abbott]] was also teaching photography. She also offered private workshops. Model's best known pupil was [[Diane Arbus]], who studied under her in 1957, and Arbus owed much of her early technique to Model. Arbus's husband Allan was actually quoted attributing her development as an artist to Model: "That was Lisette. Three sessions and Diane was a photographer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-woman-who-influenced-diane-arbuss-eye-1464187560|title=The Woman Who Influenced Diane Arbus’s Eye|last=Lubow|first=Arthur|date=2016-05-25|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-03-26|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Larry Fink (photographer)|Larry Fink]], [[John Gossage]], Charles Pratt, [[Eva Rubinstein]] and [[Rosalind Solomon]] were also students of Model's. She continued to teach in New York after the passing of her husband Evsa in 1976, both at the New School and at the International Center of Photography.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1981 she was awarded an honorary doctorate of fine arts by The New School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Waggoner|first1=Walter H.|title=Lisette Model, a Photographer, Is Dead at 76|publisher=The New York Times|date=March 31, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Final years ==
The first book of Model's photographs was published in 1979 by [[Aperture (magazine)|Aperture]] and included a preface by [[Berenice Abbott]]. [[Marvin Israel]] designed the book. Fifty-two photographs made 1937–1970 were reproduced at a large enough scale to correspond with her preferred dimension of 16 x 20 inches. In the later half of her career, Model's work underwent a steep drop in print production. She hadn't stopped shooting photographs; she had simply stopped printing them. Much like some of the hazier details of her biography, the reason for this change has not been conclusively identified. Speculation points toward declining health and self-efficacy, increased energy directed towards teaching, and precarious financial situation as some of the primary causes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Nevertheless, Model continued to shoot and teach until her death. Even in her twilight hours, her work was exhibited in Germany, Japan, and the Netherlands, to name a few, and in 1982 she received the Medal of the City of Paris.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She died at New York Hospital on March 30, 1983 from heart and respiratory disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waggoner |first=Walter H. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/31/obituaries/lisette-model-a-photographer-is-dead-at-76.html |title=LISETTE MODEL, A PHOTOGRAPHER, IS DEAD AT 76 |website=NYTimes.com |date=1983-03-31 |accessdate=2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The estate of Lisette Model is represented by [[Bruce Silverstein Gallery]], New York, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brucesilverstein.com/artists/estate-of-lisette-model|title=Estate of Lisette Model |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122110653/http://www.brucesilverstein.com/artists/estate-of-lisette-model |archivedate=January 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This estate was responsible for the release of a mass of information on the notoriously private Model after her death, including 25,000 negatives (many hundreds unprinted), personal letters, lectures, press clippings, and many more sources. The release of this information made up for the previous dearth of accurate details on Model's life, which could be partially attributed to her mistrust of written publications. She refused the release of interviews, and allegedly even sabotaged a manuscript about her by Phillip Lopate. It is suspected that she may have fudged the truth about her past more than once, and her reticence was due to a fear of revealing this misinformation and unclouding her personal history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ngcmagazine.ca/features/preserving-model-s-legacy|title=Preserving Model’s Legacy|website=www.ngcmagazine.ca|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, there is now a wealth of knowledge to be found, thanks to the meticulous preservation of her estate.

==Professional boxing career==
Leduc turned pro in 1992 and had limited success.  He retired in 1993 with a record of 6-1-0 after losing to [[Michel Galarneau]].

==Retirement and coming out==
In 1993, Leduc spoke about being a [[gay]] athlete in [[CBC Radio]]'s documentary "The Last Closet", which aired on the weekly sports series ''[[The Inside Track]]'';&lt;ref name=remembered&gt;{{cite news

He attended [[Toronto]]’s [[Pride Week (Toronto)|Pride Parade]] in 1999 as grand marshal with [[Savoy Howe]]. Leduc worked for and volunteered with the Toronto People with AIDS Foundation, later becoming a set-builder and construction worker in the film industry.

Leduc died on July 22, 2009 in [[Toronto]]. He had collapsed in the [[sauna]] of St. Marks Spa and doctors suggested that his death may have resulted from [[hyperthermia|heat stroke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A '''mating call''' is the auditory signal used by animals to attract mates. It can occur in males or females, but literature is abundantly favored toward researching mating calls in males. In addition, mating calls are often the subject of [[mate choice]], in which the preferences of one gender for a certain type of mating call can drive sexual selection in a species. This can result in [[sympatric speciation]] of some animals, where two species diverge from each other while living in the same environment.

There are many different mechanisms to produce mating calls, which can be broadly categorized into vocalizations and mechanical calls. Vocalizations are considered as sounds produced by the [[larynx]] and are often seen in species of birds, mammals, amphibians, and insects. Mechanical calls refer to any other type of sound that the animal produces using unique body parts and/or tools for communication with potential mates. Examples include crickets that vibrate their wings, birds that flap their feathers, and frogs that use an air sac instead of lungs.

== Vocalizations ==

=== Birds ===
[[File:Song Sparrow (8381415679).jpg|thumb|Song sparrow]]
[[File:SND 4458a.ogg|thumb|Mating call of Japanese bush warbler,  ''Horornis diphone'']]The use of vocalizations is widespread in avian species and are often used to attract mates. Different aspects and features of bird song such as structure, amplitude and frequency have evolved as a result of sexual selection.&lt;ref name=nemeth2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nemeth|first=E|author2=Kempenaers, B |author3=Matessi, G |author4= Brumm, H |title=Rock sparrow song reflects male age and reproductive success.|journal=PLOS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=8|pages=e43259|pmid=22927955|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0043259 |pmc=3426517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large song repertoires are preferred by females of many avian species.&lt;ref name=pfaff2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pfaff|first=JA|author2=Zanette, L |author3=MacDougall-Shackleton, SA |author4= MacDougall-Shackleton, EA |title=Song repertoire size varies with HVC volume and is indicative of male quality in song sparrows (Melospiza melodia).|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|date=Aug 22, 2007|volume=274|issue=1621|pages=2035–40|pmid=17567560|doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.0170 |pmc=2275172}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One hypothesis for this is that song repertoire is positively correlated with the size of the brain's [[HVC (avian brain region)|song control nucleus]] (HVC). A large HVC would indicate developmental success. In [[song sparrow]]s, males with large repertoires had larger HVCs, better body condition and lower heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratios indicating better immune health. This supports the idea that song sparrows with large song repertoires have better lifetime fitness and that song repertoires are honest indicators of the male's "quality". Possible explanations for this adaptation include direct benefits to the female, such as superior parental care or territory defense, and indirect benefits, such as good genes for their offspring.&lt;ref name=pfaff2007 /&gt;

[[Japanese bush warbler]] songs from island populations have an acoustically simple structure when compared to mainland populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamao|first=Shoji|title=Acoustic structure of songs in island populations of the Japanese bush warbler, Cettia diphone, in relation to sexual selection|journal=Journal of Ethology|year=2012|volume=31|issue=1|pages=9–15|doi=10.1007/s10164-012-0341-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Song complexity is correlated with higher levels of sexual selection in mainland populations, showing that a more complex song structure is advantageous in an environment with high levels of sexual selection. Another example is in [[purple-crowned fairywren]]s; larger males of this species sing advertising songs at a lower frequency than smaller rival males. Since body size is a characteristic of good health, lower frequency calls are a form of honest signaling. Negative correlation between body size and call frequency is supported across multiple species within the taxa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=ML|author2=Kingma, SA |author3=Peters, A |title=Male songbird indicates body size with low-pitched advertising songs.|journal=PLOS ONE|year=2013|volume=8|issue=2|pages=e56717|pmid=23437221|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0056717|pmc=3577745}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[rock sparrow]], song frequency is positively associated with reproductive success. Slower song rate is associated with age and is preferred by females. Reproductive status of the individual is communicated through higher maximum frequency. There was also positive correlation between age and extra pair copulation frequency.&lt;ref name=nemeth2012/&gt;[[File:Red deer stag 2009 denmark.jpg|thumb|Red deer stag during rut]]

Bird calls are also known to continue after pair formation in several socially [[Monogamous pairing in animals|monogamous]] bird species. In one experimental population of [[zebra finch]]es, there was increased singing activity by the male after breeding.&lt;ref name="bolund2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bolund|first=Elisabeth|author2=Schielzeth, Holger |author3=Forstmeier, Wolfgang |title=Singing activity stimulates partner reproductive investment rather than increasing paternity success in zebra finches|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|year=2012|volume=66|issue=6|pages=975–984|doi=10.1007/s00265-012-1346-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increase is positively correlated with the partner's reproductive investment. The female finches were bred in cages with two subsequent males that differed with varying amounts of song output. Females produced larger [[Bird egg|eggs]] with more orange yolks when paired with a male with a high song output. This suggests that the relative amount of song production in paired zebra finch males might function to stimulate the partner rather than to attract extra-pair females.&lt;ref name="bolund2012" /&gt;

=== Mammals ===
During the [[breeding season]], mammals will call out to the opposite sex. Male [[koala]]s that are bigger will let out a different sound than smaller koalas. The bigger males which are routinely sought out for are called sires. Females choose sires because of indirect benefits that their offspring could inherit, like larger bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charlton | first1 = B. D. | last2 = Ellis | first2 =  | last3 = Brumm | first3 = J. | last4 = Nilsson | first4 = K. | last5 = Fitch | first5 = W.

Male-male competition is rarely exhibited in koalas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = W. A. H. | last2 = Bercovitch | first2 = F.

Acoustic signaling is a type of call that can be used from a significant distance encoding an organism's location, condition and identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilkins | first1 = M. R. | last2 = Seddon | first2 = N. | last3 = Safran | first3 = R.

When females hear these songs, named a 'whistle', they call onto the males to breed with a screech of their own. This action is termed 'calling of the sexes'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2008 | title = SONGS , SCENTS , AND SENSES : SEXUAL SELECTION IN THE GREATER SAC-WINGED BAT , SACCOPTERYX BILINEATA | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 89 | issue = | pages = 1401–1410 | doi=10.1644/08-mamm-s-060.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Red deer]] and [[spotted hyena]]s along with other mammals also perform acoustic signaling.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, C.

[[File:Tungara Frog (Engystomops pustulosus) Calling.jpg|thumb|Tungara frog]]

=== Amphibians ===
Most frogs use an air sac located under their mouth to produce mating calls. Air from the lungs channels to the air sac to inflate it, and the air sac resonates to produce a mating call. The larynx is larger and more developed in males, which causes their call to be louder and stronger&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilczynski | first1 = W. | last2 = McClelland | first2 = B. E. | last3 = Rand | first3 = A. S. | year = 1993 | title = Acoustic, auditory, and morphological divergence in three species of neotropical frog | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative Physiology A | volume = 172 | issue = 4| pages = 425–438 | doi=10.1007/bf00213524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Tungara frog|túngara frog]], males use a whining call followed by up to seven clucks. Males who have a whine-cluck call are more successful in attracting females than males whose call is a whine alone. The ability to produce clucks is due to a specialized fibrous mass attached to the frog's vocal folds, creating an unusual vocalization similar to the two-voiced songs found in some birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Animal communication: Complex call production in the túngara frog|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v441/n7089/full/441038a.html|journal = Nature|date = 2006-05-04|issn = 0028-0836|pages = 38-38|volume = 441|issue = 7089|doi = 10.1038/441038a|first = M.|last = Gridi-Papp|first2 = A. S.|last2 = Rand|first3 = M. J.|last3 = Ryan|pmid=16672962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[common toad]], sexual competition is driven in large part by fighting—successful males often physically displaced other males from the backs of a female in order to gain access to mating with that female. Larger males were more successful in such takeovers, and had higher reproductive success as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Competitive mate searching in male common toads, Bufo bufo|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003347279900708|journal = Animal Behaviour|pages = 1253–1267|volume = 27|doi = 10.1016/0003-3472(79)90070-8|first = N.B.|last = Davies|first2 = T.R.|last2 = Halliday}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the vocalizations of these toads provide a reliable signal of body size and thus fighting ability, allowing contests for possession of females to be settled without risk of injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Deep croaks and fighting assessment in toads Bufo bufo|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v274/n5672/abs/274683a0.html|journal = Nature|date = 1978-08-17|pages = 683–685|volume = 274|issue = 5672|doi = 10.1038/274683a0|first = N. B.|last = Davies|first2 = T. R.|last2 = Halliday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Insects ===
While mating calls in insects are usually associated with mechanical mating calls, such as in crickets, several species of insects use vocalizations to attract mates. In the [[Ostrinia furnacalis|Asian corn borer]], males emit clicking sounds that mimic the echolocation of bats which prey on the moths. They then take advantage of the female's "freezing" response to mate with the female.

In the [[Arctiinae (erebid moths)|Japanese lichen moth]], however, the female is able to distinguish between the sounds made by males and those made by bats and other predators.As a result, the males use ultrasonic clicking as a more conventional mating signal, compared to the "deceptive" courtship song used in the Asian Corn Bearer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evolution of deceptive and true courtship songs in moths|url = http://www.nature.com/articles/srep02003|journal = Scientific Reports|date = 2013-06-20|pmc = 3687589|pmid = 23788180|volume = 3|doi = 10.1038/srep02003|first = Ryo|last = Nakano|first2 = Takuma|last2 = Takanashi|first3 = Annemarie|last3 = Surlykke|first4 = Niels|last4 = Skals|first5 = Yukio|last5 = Ishikawa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanical calls==
Mating calls also take form through mechanical processes. Animals that are unable to vocalize their call may use their body to attract mates.

=== Crickets ===
[[File:Field cricket Gryllus pennsylvanicus.ogg|thumb|Mating call of field cricket, ''Gryllus pennsylvanicus'']]

In the field cricket, ''Gryllus integer'', males rub their wings together to create a rapid trill that produces sound.&lt;ref name="Hedrick, A. V. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedrick | first1 = A. V. | year = 2000 | title = Crickets with extravagant mating songs compensate for predation risk with extra caution | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 267 | issue = 1444| pages = 671–675 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1054 | pmid=10821611 | pmc=1690585}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males individually vary in the durations of their trilling or, what is more sophisticatedly called, bout length. The bout length of each male is heritable and passed on to his future offspring. Also, females prefer to mate with males that have longer bout lengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedrick | first1 = AV | year = 1986 | title = Female preferences for male calling bout duration in a field cricket | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 73–77 | doi=10.1007/bf00303845}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end result is that males with longer bout lengths produce more offspring than males with shorter bout lengths.

Other factors that influence the formation of these bout lengths include temperature and predation. In field crickets, males prefer warmer sites for mating as shown by an increase in the frequency of their mating calls when they were living in warmer climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedrick | first1 = A. | last2 = Perez | first2 = D. | last3 = Lichti | first3 = N. | last4 = Yew | first4 = J. | year = | title = Temperature preferences of male field crickets (Gryllus integer) alter their mating calls | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00359-002-0368-9 | journal = Journal of Comparative Physiology A| volume =  188| issue = | pages =  799–805| doi=10.1007/s00359-002-0368-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predation also affects the mating calls of field crickets. When in a potentially dangerous environment, males cease calling for longer periods of time when interrupted by a predator cue.&lt;ref name="Hedrick, A. V. 2000"/&gt; This suggests that there is an interplay between intensity of mating call and risk of predation.

=== Sonation ===
{{main|Sonation}}
As described in [[Sonation]], "the term sonate is described as the deliberate production of sounds, not from the throat, but rather from structures such as the bill, wings, tail, feet and body feathers, or by the use of tools". In several amphibian and fish species, other special structures are used to produce different sounds to attract mates. Birds are common users of sonation, although several amphibian and fish species have been shown to use sonation as a form of mating call as well. In general, sonation is one factor that plays into how a female may choose a mate. There are other features of mating such as territory defense or mate defense, which contribute to the cause of finding suitable mates.

As outlined below, each species uses a distinct method to produce a non-vocal mating call in order to be most successful in attracting mates. The examples below represent the most common examples found in the literature, although many more examples may exist in nature that are still currently unknown.
[[File:Feather of male Pavo cristatus (Indian peafowl).jpg|thumb|Feather of male ''Pavo cristatus'' (Indian peafowl). These feathers are used in sonation to create infrasound with intent of mating.]]

==== Birds ====
The feathers, the beak, the feet, and different tools are all used by different bird species to produce mating calls to attract mates. For example, the snipe uses its feathers to produce a [[drumming (snipe)|"drumming"]] sound to attract mates during a special mating dance. Snipes used specialized tail feathers to create a sound described as a "rattle" or "throbbing" noise.&lt;ref&gt;Bahr, P. H. "On the "bleating" or "drumming" of the snipe (Gallinago coelestis)." Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London. Vol. 77. No. 1. Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 1907&lt;/ref&gt; Palm cockatoos use sticks to drum on hollow trees, creating a loud noise to attract the attention of mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gray | first1 = Patricia M. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1915 | title = Enhanced: The Music of Nature and the Nature of Music | url = | journal = Science Online | volume = 291 | issue = | pages = 52–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bustards]] are large, highly terrestrial birds that stamp their feet during mating displays to attract mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alonso | first1 = Juan C. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2010 | title = Correlates of male mating success in great bustard leks: the effects of age, weight, and display effort | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 64 | issue = 10| pages = 1589–1600 | doi=10.1007/s00265-010-0972-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mirafra apiata]]'', commonly known as the Clapper lark, engages in a complex display flight that is characterized by the rattling of the wings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maclean | first1 = Gordon L | year = 1970 | title = Breeding behaviour of larks in the Kalahari Sandveld | url = | journal = Annals of the Natal Museum | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 388–401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many species of birds use sonation for mating calls such as manakins and hummingbirds. However, peacocks exhibit a feature of sonation that reveals intrasexual and intersexual properties of this type of mating call.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Infrasound in mating displays: a peacock's tale|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347215000391|journal = Animal Behaviour|date = 2015-04-01|pages = 241–250|volume = 102|doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.01.029|first = Angela R.|last = Freeman|first2 = James F.|last2 = Hare}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males move their feathers to produce low-frequency sonations ([[infrasound]]) and sonate more frequently in response to sonations by other males. This is attributable to a male's desire to advertise its presence above other males looking for mates, suggesting that sonation carries an intrasexual function. In addition, females show increased alertness when hearing the infrasound signals produced by males' wing-shaking, which highlights how the two sexes use sonation to interact with each other.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Fish ====

While most bird species use their feathers, tools, or feet to produce sounds and attract mates, many fish species use specialized internal organs to sonate. In [[Gadidae|Gadoid fish]], special muscles attached to the swimbladder assist in the production of knocking or grunting sounds to attract mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawkins | first1 = A. D. | last2 = Just Rasmussen | first2 = Knud | year = 1978 | title = The calls of gadoid fish | url = | journal = Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom | volume = 58 | issue = 04| pages = 891–911 | doi=10.1017/s0025315400056848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lepidoptera ====
In many lepidoptera species including the adzuki bean borer ([[Ostrinia scapulalis]]), ultrasonic mating calls are used to attract females and keep them motionless during copulation. These pulses have an average frequency of 40&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takanashi|first=Takuma|last2=Nakano|first2=Ryo|last3=Surlykke|first3=Annemarie|last4=Tatsuta|first4=Haruki|last5=Tabata|first5=Jun|last6=Ishikawa|first6=Yukio|last7=Skals|first7=Niels|date=2010-10-04|title=Variation in Courtship Ultrasounds of Three Ostrinia Moths with Different Sex Pheromones|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013144|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=5|issue=10|pages=e13144|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0013144|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speciation due to mating call differences ==

Differences in mating calls can lead to the separation of different populations within a species. These differences can be due to several factors, including body size, temperature, and other ecological factors.These can arise in the form of tonal, temporal, or behavioral variations in mating calls that subsequently lead to the separation of populations. The separation of these populations due to differences in mating call and mating call preferences can lead to the evolution and creation of new, unique species.

This type of speciation is most often sympatric speciation: where two or more species are created from an existing parent species that all live in the same geographic location. Although there is an absence of research on mammals and birds, this phenomenon has been heavily researched in several frog species around the world. The examples below illuminate speciation due to mating call differences in several frog species around the world. These distinct species are included because they are the focus of the majority of current research.

=== ''Microhyla olivacea'' and ''Microhyla carolinensis'' ===
These two species of narrow-mouthed frog live in the southern United States and have overlapping ranges in Texas and Oklahoma. Researchers have discovered that these two different species alter the frequencies of their call in the overlap zone of their ranges. For example, the ''Microhyla olivacea'' mating call has a significantly lower midpoint frequency in the overlap zone than the mating call outside this zone. This leads researchers to suggest that the differences in mating call in the overlap zone of ''M. olivacea and M. carolinensis'' act as an isolating mechanism between the two species. They also hypothesize that the evolution of these differences in mating call led to the separation of these two different frog species from one common species.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Mating Call in the Speciation of Anuran Amphibians|last = Blair|first = Frank|date = 1958|journal = The American Naturalist|doi = 10.1086/282007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Engystomops petersi'' ===
Female preferences for specific male mating calls can lead to sexual selection in mating calls. Females may prefer a specific type of call that certain males possess, in which only those males will be able to mate with females and pass on their genes and specific mating call. As a result, this female preference may lead to divergence of two species.

In Amazonian frogs, sexual selection for different calls has led to the [[Reproductive isolation|behavioral isolation]] and speciation of the túngara frog (''Engystomops petersi)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sexual selection drives speciation in an Amazonian frog|url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/274/1608/399|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|date = 2007-02-07|issn = 0962-8452|pmc = 1702375|pmid = 17164204|pages = 399–406|volume = 274|issue = 1608|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2006.3736|first = Kathryn E.|last = Boul|first2 = W. Chris|last2 = Funk|first3 = Catherine R.|last3 = Darst|first4 = David C.|last4 = Cannatella|first5 = Michael J.|last5 = Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt; From genetic and mating call analysis and, researchers were able to identify that two populations of the túngara frog were almost completely reproductively isolated. From their research, scientists believe that differences in female preferences for mating call type have led to the evolution of this speciation process. Specifically, the Yasuní population females prefer the male mating call that includes a whine, while the other population does not prefer this whine. Subsequently, the Yasuní males include the whine in their call, while the other males do not. For this reason, the differences in call have led to the mechanical separation of this species.

=== ''Pseudacris triseriata'' ===
[[File:Western Chorus Frog (6922520670).jpg|thumb|A Chorus Frog making a mating call]]
Several studies have shown that the species ''Pseudacris triseriata'' (Chorus Frog) can be divided into two subspecies, ''P. t. maculata'' and ''P. t. triseriata,'' due to speciation events from mating call differences. The Chorus Frog has a very large home range, from New Mexico to Southern Canada. These two subspecies have an overlapping range from South Dakota to Oklahoma. In this overlapping range, both the call duration and the calls per second for each species is much different than outside of this range. This means that calls of these two subspecies are more similar outside of this range, and starkly different within the range. For this reason, scientists suggest that these subspecies evolved from differences in mating call type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Speciation within the Chorus Frog Pseudacris triseriata: Morphometric and Mating Call Analyses of the Boreal and Western Subspecies|journal = Copeia|date = 1989-08-08|pages = 704–712|volume = 1989|issue = 3|doi = 10.2307/1445498|first = James E.|last = Platz|jstor=1445498}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, these subspecies are rarely recorded to have hybrid offspring, which further suggests that there is complete speciation due to mating call differences. The differences in mating calls also help to reinforce the speciation process.

'''Michael Llewelyn Davies''' (16 June 1900 – 19 May 1921) was &amp;ndash; along with [[Llewelyn Davies boys|his four brothers]]  &amp;ndash; the inspiration for [[J. M. Barrie]]'s characters [[Peter Pan]], the Darling brothers, and the [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)|Lost Boys]].  Late in life, his only surviving brother [[Nicholas Llewelyn Davies|Nico]] described him as "the cleverest of us, the most original, the potential genius."&lt;ref name="birkin" /&gt; He drowned in ambiguous circumstances with a close friend &amp;ndash; and possible lover&lt;ref name="jmb.co.uk" /&gt; &amp;ndash; just short of his 21st birthday. He was a first cousin of English writer [[Daphne du Maurier]].

==Early life and Peter Pan==
[[Image:Michael Llewelyn Davies as Peter Pan.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Davies dressed as Peter Pan at age 6]]
Davies was the fourth of five sons of [[Arthur Llewelyn Davies|Arthur]] and [[Sylvia Llewelyn Davies]].  He was born three years after Barrie became friends with his older brothers and mother in 1897.  He and his eldest brother [[George Llewelyn Davies|George]] were the boys closest to Barrie, and he is widely reported as the individual who most influenced the portrayal of Peter Pan in the 1911 [[novel]] based on the play. He was an infant as Barrie was writing the first appearance of Peter Pan as a newborn in ''[[The Little White Bird]]''.  He was four and a half years old when ''[[Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]'' debuted in December 1904.  The following winter, he was ill for several months, so in February 1906 Barrie and producer [[Charles Frohman]] brought scenery and some of the cast to the family's home in [[Berkhamsted]] to perform the play for him.&lt;ref name="birkin" /&gt;  Barrie began writing a sequel to ''Peter Pan'' about the boy's brother, to be entitled ''Michael Pan'', but instead incorporated this material (such as the hero's nightmares) into the novel ''[[Peter and Wendy]]''.&lt;ref name="birkin" /&gt;

The [[statue of Peter Pan]] in [[Kensington Gardens]], erected in secret during the night of 30 April 1912, was supposed to be modelled upon photographs of Michael Llewelyn Davies at the age of six, dressed as the character. However, sculptor [[George Frampton]] used a different child as his model, leaving Barrie very disappointed with the result. "It doesn't show the devil in Peter," the writer said.&lt;ref name="birkin" /&gt;

Barrie became [[Legal guardian|guardian]] of Davies and his brothers following the deaths of their father in 1907 and mother in 1910.  Davies and Barrie remained very close as Davies grew up and went away to school, particularly after his eldest brother [[George Llewelyn Davies|George]] died in combat in [[Flanders]] during [[World War I]] in 1915.  His youngest brother [[Nicholas Llewelyn Davies|Nico]] later described Michael and George as "the Ones", the boys who meant the most to Barrie.  Davies attended [[Eton College]], where he had difficulty adjusting to life away from his family, and he exchanged letters daily with "Uncle Jim" Barrie. He also suffered from nightmares, which he had experienced since childhood. Nonetheless, he made a number of friends and excelled at his studies, including art and writing poetry, and was described as a "brilliant boy", one destined for great things.

==Adulthood==
[[Image:Rupert Buxton 1920.jpg|130px|thumb|left|Rupert Buxton in 1920]]

After finishing at Eton, Davies attended [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where he continued to correspond regularly with Barrie.  He briefly decided to study art at the [[University of Paris]], but returned to Oxford.  Several friends from Eton joined him there, but he also became very close to Rupert Buxton,&lt;ref&gt;[http://neverpedia.com/pan/Rupert_Buxton Rupert Erroll Victor Buxton article at Neverpedia]&lt;/ref&gt; the son of [[Sir Thomas Buxton, 4th Baronet|Sir Thomas Fowell Victor Buxton, 4th Baronet]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p19706.htm thePeerage.com - Person Page 19706&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and a former pupil of [[Harrow School]].  The two became inseparable friends, spending time both at the university and on holiday together.  Buxton was also a poet, and had an interest in acting. Buxton was one of the few friends of Davies whom Barrie reported getting along with.

In an interview taped in 1976, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician [[Robert Boothby]], who had been a close friend of Davies at Eton and Oxford, spoke about Davies' relationships during this time.  When asked if Davies were [[homosexuality|homosexual]], Boothby &amp;ndash; who was reported by newspapers to have had homosexual relationships as an adult&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/kray/invincibles_9.html The Kray Twins: Brothers in Arms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218230420/http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/kray/invincibles_9.html |date=18 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; replied it was "a phase... I think he might have come out of it."&lt;ref name="jmb.co.uk" /&gt;  Boothby also said, "I don't think Michael had any girlfriends, but our friendship wasn't homosexual.  I believe it was &amp;ndash; fleetingly &amp;ndash; between him and Senhouse".&lt;ref name="birkin"&gt;Birkin, Andrew: ''J M Barrie &amp; the Lost Boys'' (Yale University Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Roger Senhouse]] was a friend of Davies at both Eton and Oxford.)  Boothby reported that he had discouraged Davies' relationship with Buxton, warning of "a feeling of doom" he had about him.  Although Boothby criticised the relationship between Davies and his surrogate father Barrie as "morbid" and "unhealthy", he dismissed the notion that there was a sexual aspect to it.  But he volunteered that there had been a sexual relationship between Davies and Buxton.&lt;ref name="jmb.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.JMBarrie.co.uk Andrew Birkin's site about Barrie and the Davies family]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[Image:Michael Llewelyn Davies death.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Newspaper report of Davies' drowning]]
Shortly before Davies's 21st birthday, he and Buxton drowned together in Sandford Lasher, a pool of water downstream of a [[weir]] near [[Sandford Lock]] on the [[River Thames]], a few miles from [[Oxford]].

The closeness of Davies and Buxton, combined with the uncertain circumstances of their deaths, led to speculation that the pair had died in a [[suicide pact]]. Dangerous currents in Sandford Lasher had made the pool notorious as a drowning hazard – there were warning signs and a conspicuous, 19th century memorial to previous victims. Despite this, the pair had gone swimming there before.

The water was {{convert|20|to|30|ft|m|0}} deep, but calm. Buxton was a good swimmer, but Davies had a fear of water and could not swim effectively. A witness at the coroner's inquest reported that one man was swimming to join the other, who was sitting on a stone on the weir, but he experienced "difficulties" and the other dived in to reach him.  However, the witness also reported, when he saw their heads together in the water they did not appear to be struggling.  Their bodies were recovered "clasped" together the next day (sometimes misreported later as "tied together"). The coroner's conclusion was Davies had drowned accidentally, and Buxton had drowned trying to save him.&lt;ref name="birkin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jmbarrie.co.uk/allscans/fullsize/1921-05-27-DX-MLD-death-Oxford_Chronicle.jpg Oxford Chronicle article about coroner's inquest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814070514/http://www.jmbarrie.co.uk/allscans/fullsize/1921-05-27-DX-MLD-death-Oxford_Chronicle.jpg |date=14 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Oxford Magazine]]'' published the following in an obituary for the pair: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Two House men whose loss would have been more widely and more deeply mourned, it would be impossible to find. They were intimate friends, and in their death they were not divided. It is we who must learn to live without them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandfordonthames.co.uk/thelink/link69.htm#69P18 modern Sandford article about Davies' death]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Barrie wrote a year later that Davies's death "was in a way the end of me."

Davies's brothers Peter and Nico each later acknowledged suicide as a likely explanation, as did Barrie.&lt;ref name="birkin" /&gt;  Although Boothby, in 1976, described Buxton as having "an almost suicidal streak about him", he did not take a definite stand on whether Buxton had died trying to save Davies and/or impulsively joined him going under, or whether they had in fact died as the result of a suicide pact.&lt;ref name="jmb.co.uk" /&gt;

==In media==
In the 1978 [[BBC]] [[mini-series]] ''[[The Lost Boys (docudrama)|The Lost Boys]]'', he is portrayed at various ages by [[Sebastian Buss]], [[Paul Spurrier]], [[Alexander Buss]], [[Charles Tatnall]], and [[William Relton]].

The 1988 play ''[[The Death of Peter Pan]]'' (by Australian playwright [[Barry Lowe]]) is based on Davies's life and focuses on his relationship with Rupert Buxton.

In the 2004 film ''[[Finding Neverland (film)|Finding Neverland]]'' he is portrayed by [[Luke Spill]].

==Background==
Gerard Robert Baden-Clay was born Gerard Clay in [[Bournemouth]], [[England]], on 9 September 1970.&lt;ref name="GerardNews.com.au"&gt;{{cite news|title=The life and times of Gerard Baden-Clay, as supplied to police via affidavits used in bail application|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/the-life-and-times-of-gerard-baden-clay-as-supplied-to-police-via-affidavits-used-in-supreme-court-bail-application/story-e6frfkvr-1226410326970|accessdate=25 January 2016|publisher=[[News.com.au]]|date=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family migrated to [[Rhodesia]] in 1980, where they changed their family name to "Baden-Clay" to associate the family with his father's grandfather, [[Robert Baden-Powell|Lord Baden-Powell]] of [[Scouting]] fame.

The ''' O. J. Simpson murder case''' (officially titled '''''People of the State of California v. Orenthal James Simpson''''') was a [[criminal trial]] held at the [[Los Angeles County Superior Court]] in which former [[National Football League]] (NFL) player, broadcaster, and actor [[O. J. Simpson]] was tried on two counts of murder for the June 12, 1994, deaths of his ex-wife, [[Nicole Brown Simpson]], and her friend, [[Ron Goldman]]. On the morning of June 13, 1994, they were found stabbed to death outside Brown's [[condominium]] in the [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]] area of Los Angeles. Simpson was a [[person of interest]] in their murders. He did not turn himself in, and on June 17 he became the object of a low-speed pursuit in a white 1993 [[Ford Bronco]] [[SUV]] owned and driven by [[Al Cowlings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/18/us/the-simpson-case-the-fugitive-simpson-is-charged-chased-arrested.html|title=The Fugitive: Simpson Is Charged, Chased, Arrested|last=Mydans|first=Seth|date=18 June 1994|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; TV stations interrupted coverage of the [[1994 NBA Finals]] to broadcast the incident live.

The trial, often characterized as the [[trial of the century]] because of its international publicity similar to that of [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] and the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]], spanned eleven months, from the [[Juror's oath|jury's swearing-in]] on November 9, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=12 Simpson Jurors Are Sworn In : Trial: The eight-woman, four-man panel is predominantly black.

Simpson was represented by a very high-profile defense team, also referred to as the "[[Dream Team (law)|Dream Team]]", which was initially led by [[Robert Shapiro (lawyer)|Robert Shapiro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Lawyer for O.

The team also included [[F. Lee Bailey]], [[Alan Dershowitz]], [[Robert Kardashian]], [[Shawn Holley]], [[Carl E. Douglas]], and [[Gerald Uelmen]]. [[Barry Scheck]] and [[Peter Neufeld]] were two additional attorneys who specialized in DNA evidence.

Deputy [[District Attorney]]s [[Marcia Clark]] and [[Christopher Darden]] believed they had a strong case against Simpson, but Cochran was able to convince the jurors that there was reason to doubt the [[DNA]] evidence provided by the State, which was a relatively new form of evidence in trials at that time.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Simpson Team Taking Aim at DNA Laboratory |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date= September 7, 1994|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/07/us/simpson-team-taking-aim-at-dna-laboratory.html |accessdate=December 5, 2008 | first=Barry | last=Meier}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[reasonable doubt]] theory included evidence that the blood sample had allegedly been mishandled by lab scientists and technicians, and there were questionable circumstances that surrounded other court exhibits.&lt;ref name="usa today"&gt;{{cite news |title=List of the evidence in the O.

Simpson's celebrity status, racial issues, and the lengthy [[televised trial]] riveted national attention. By the end of the trial, national surveys showed dramatic differences in the assessment of Simpson's guilt or innocence between black and white Americans.&lt;ref name="usa today4"&gt;{{cite news |title=Race factor tilts the scales of public opinion |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=February 5, 1997 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/index/nns212.htm |accessdate=December 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediate reaction to the verdict was notable for its division along racial lines: a poll of [[Los Angeles County]] residents showed that most African Americans there felt that justice had been served by the "not guilty" verdict, while the majority of whites and Latinos expressed an opinion that it had not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Decker|first1=Cathleen|title=THE TIMES POLL : Most in County Disagree With Simpson Verdicts|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-08/news/mn-54801_1_times-poll|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the trial, the Brown and Goldman families filed a [[civil lawsuit]] against Simpson. On February 4, 1997, the jury unanimously found Simpson responsible for both deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jury unanimous: Simpson is liable|publisher=CNN |date=February 4, 1997|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9702/04/simpson.verdict1/index.html|accessdate=June 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The families were awarded compensatory and punitive damages totaling $33.5 million  (${{Inflation|US|33.5|1997|r=1}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars), but have received only a small portion of that.

==Background==

===Brown–Simpson marriage===
[[File:O.J. Simpson (1986)2.JPG|thumb|upright|Simpson with his daughter, Sydney, in 1986]]
[[O.J. Simpson]] and [[Nicole Brown Simpson|Nicole Brown]] were married on February 2, 1985, five years after Simpson's retirement from professional football.{{sfn|Lange|Vannatter|Moldea|1997|p=115}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/23/us/simpson-case-victim-nicole-brown-simpson-slain-dawn-better-life.html|title=The Simlson Case: The Victim; Nicole Brown Simpson: Slain At the Dawn of a Better Life|last=Rimer|first=Sara|date=1994-06-23|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had two children, Sydney Brooke Simpson (b. 1985) and Justin Ryan Simpson (b. 1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/casefiles/simpson/new_docs/custody.html|title=Child custody decision|publisher=courttv.com| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090110000200/http://www.courttv.com/casefiles/simpson/new_docs/custody.html| archive-date =January 10, 2009|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their marriage lasted seven years, during which time Simpson was investigated multiple times by police for [[domestic violence]] and pleaded [[no contest]] to [[spousal abuse]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=February 6, 1995|title=Judge Allow Evidence of Domestic Violence In O. J. Simpson Murder inside of this cases or Case|journal=Jet|volume=87|issue=13|page=51|issn=0021-5996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown filed for [[divorce]] on February 25, 1992, citing "[[irreconcilable differences]]" as the reason.{{sfn|Taylor Gibbs|1996|p=136}} Still, the abuse continued; Brown called [[9-1-1]] on 25 October 1993, crying and saying that "[Simpson] is going to beat the shit out of me".{{r|anolik201406}}

===Murders===
At 12:10&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name=Timeline&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldman|first=Ronald|title=O.J.

She had been stabbed multiple times in the head and neck, and had [[defensive wound]]s on her hands.

Robert Riske, one of the first two officers on the scene, found a single bloody glove, among other evidence.

Detectives went to Simpson's Brentwood estate to inform him that Nicole had been murdered. Detective [[Mark Fuhrman]] climbed over an external wall and unlocked the gate to allow the other three detectives to enter as well. The detectives argued that they entered without a [[search warrant]] because of exigent circumstances – specifically, in this case, out of fear that Simpson might have been injured also. Simpson was not present when the detectives arrived early that morning; he had taken a flight to [[Chicago]] late the previous night. Detectives briefly interviewed [[Kato Kaelin]], who was staying in Simpson's guest house. In a walk-around of the premises, Fuhrman discovered a second bloody glove; it was later determined to be the match of the glove found at the murder scene. Through DNA testing, the blood on this one was determined to have come from both victims. This, together with other evidence collected at both scenes, was determined to be [[probable cause]] to issue an [[arrest warrant]] for Simpson.

Simpson, while waiting in his bedroom, invited longtime friend and police officer Ron Shipp for a private discussion; Simpson jokingly told him, "To be honest, Shipp, I've had some dreams about killing her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-02-02/news/mn-27325_1_nicole-simpson|title=Simpson Dreamed of Killing, Witness Says: Courts: Ex-officer says he is a longtime friend of the defendant.

===Arrest of Simpson===
[[File:Mug shot of O.J. Simpson.jpg|thumb|upright|Simpson's mugshot, 17 June 1994]]
Lawyers convinced the LAPD to allow Simpson to turn himself in at 11&amp;nbsp;a.m. on June 17, 1994,{{sfn|Bailey|Rabe|2008|p=87}} although the double murder charge meant that no [[bail]] would be set and a [[first-degree murder]] conviction could result in a [[Capital punishment|death penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penal Code Sections 187–199 |publisher=Legislative Counsel of California |url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=187-199 |accessdate=June 16, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512011845/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=187-199 |archivedate=May 12, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 1,000 reporters waited for Simpson at the police station, but he did not arrive. At 2&amp;nbsp;p.m., the LAPD issued an [[all-points bulletin]].

LAPD detective Tom Lange, who had previously interviewed Simpson about the murders on June 13, realized that he had Simpson's [[cell phone]] number and called him repeatedly. A colleague hooked a tape recorder up to Lange's phone and captured a conversation between Lange and Simpson in which Lange repeatedly pleaded with Simpson to "throw the gun out [of] the window" for the sake of his mother and children. Simpson apologized for not turning himself in earlier that day and responded that he was "the only one who deserved to get hurt" and was "just gonna go with Nicole."

Thousands of spectators and on-lookers packed overpasses along the procession's journey, waiting for the white Bronco.

==Trial==
[[File:Judge Lance Ito October 1995 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Judge Lance Ito presided over the trial]]
On June 20, Simpson was [[arraignment|arraigned]] and pleaded not guilty to both murders. As expected, the presiding judge ordered that Simpson be held without bail. The following day, a [[grand jury]] was called to determine whether to [[indictment|indict]] him for the two murders. Two days later, on June 23, the grand jury was dismissed as a result of excessive media coverage, which could have influenced its neutrality. Jill Shively, a Brentwood resident who testified that she saw Simpson speeding away from the area of Nicole's house on the night of the murders, told the grand jury that the Bronco almost collided with a [[Nissan]] at the intersection of Bundy and San Vicente Boulevard.&lt;ref name="true tv"/&gt; Another grand jury witness, a cutlery salesman named Jose Camacho, said he had sold Simpson a 15-inch (380&amp;nbsp; mm) German-made knife, similar to the murder weapon, three weeks before the killings.&lt;ref name="true tv"/&gt; Shively and Camacho were not presented by the [[prosecution]] at the criminal trial because they had sold their stories to the tabloid press.&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt; Shively had talked to the television show ''[[Hard Copy]]'' for $5,000,&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt; while Camacho sold his story to the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' for $12,500.

Rather than a grand jury hearing, authorities held a probable cause hearing to determine whether or not to bring Simpson to trial. This was a minor victory for Simpson's lawyers because it would give them access to evidence as it was being presented by the prosecution in contrast to the procedure in a grand jury hearing. After a week-long court hearing, [[California Superior Court]] Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell ruled on July 7 that there was sufficient evidence to bring Simpson to trial for the murders. At his second arraignment on July 22, when asked how he pleaded to the murders, Simpson, breaking a courtroom practice that says the accused may plead using only the words "guilty" or "not guilty," firmly stated: "Absolutely, one hundred percent, not guilty."

The prosecution decided not to seek the death penalty and instead sought a [[life sentence]]. Deputy District Attorney [[Marcia Clark]] was designated as the lead prosecutor. Deputy District Attorney [[Christopher Darden]] became Clark's co-counsel. Simpson wanted a [[speedy trial]], and the defence and prosecuting attorneys worked around the clock for several months to prepare their cases. In October 1994, Judge [[Lance Ito]] started interviewing 304 prospective jurors, each of whom had to fill out a 75-page questionnaire. On November 3, twelve jurors were seated with twelve alternates.

The trial began on January 24, 1995, and was televised by [[truTV|Court TV]], and in part by other cable and network news outlets, for 134 days. Darden argued that Simpson killed his ex-wife in a jealous rage; the prosecution opened its case by playing a 9-1-1 call from Nicole Brown Simpson on January 1, 1989, in which she expressed fear that Simpson would physically harm her, and he could be heard yelling at her in the background. Other material related to domestic violence was presented including another 9-1-1 phone call that Nicole made on October 25, 1993 expressing the same thing and Simpson also could be be heard shouting in the background, less than eight months before the murders. The prosecution also presented dozens of [[expert witness]]es to place Simpson at the scene of the crime, on subjects ranging from [[DNA profiling]] to blood and shoeprint analysis.

During the opening weeks of the trial, the prosecution presented evidence that Simpson had a history of physically abusing Nicole. Simpson's lawyer [[Alan Dershowitz]] argued that only a tiny fraction of women who are abused by their spouses are murdered. Within days after the start of the trial, lawyers and those viewing the trial from a single closed-circuit TV camera in the courtroom saw an emerging pattern: continual and countless interruptions with objections from both sides of the courtroom, as well as one [[sidebar (law)|sidebar]] conference after another with the judge, beyond earshot of the unseen jury located just below and out of the camera's frame.

==Jury selection and revolt==
According to media reports, Clark thought that women, regardless of race, would sympathize with the domestic violence aspect of the case and connect with her personally. On the other hand, the defense's research suggested that women generally were more likely to acquit than men, and that jurors did not respond well to Clark's combative style of [[litigation]]. The defense also speculated that black women would not be as sympathetic as white women to the victim, who was white, because of tensions about [[interracial marriage]]s. Both sides accepted a disproportionate number of female jurors. From an original jury pool of 40% white, 28% black, 17% Hispanic, and 15% Asian, the final jury for the trial had ten women and two men, of which there were nine blacks, two whites, and one Hispanic.&lt;ref name="usa today4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/simpson/jurypage.html |title=The O.

At the start of trial, twelve jurors and twelve alternates were selected from a pool of 250 potential jurors. Over the course of the trial ten were dismissed for a wide variety of reasons. Only four of the original jurors remained on the final panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chatsports.com/top-news/a/who-was-oj-simpson-trial-jury-meet-12-people-who-found-him-not-guilty-26948|title=Who Was On The O.J.

After being [[Jury sequestration|sequestered]] for 101 days, thirteen of the eighteen jurors refused to enter the courtroom until they were granted a meeting with Judge Ito. Eventually, the jury returned with thirteen members wearing black or dark-colored clothing in what was described as a "funeral procession."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-04-22/news/9504220188_1_jurors-murder-trial-jury|title=Simpson Jury Mutiny Casts Doubt On Trial|publisher=|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1995/04/22/thirteen-simpson-jurors-stage-revolt/f0b8a434-5491-49bb-be5e-e1c082250cfa/|title=Thirteen Simpson Jurors Stage Revolt|first1=Nell|last1=Henderson|first2=Nell|last2=Henderson|date=April 22, 1995|publisher=|accessdate=July 25, 2017|via=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution case==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2013}}
The prosecution believed it had a strong case despite the lack of known witnesses to the crime and the failure to recover the murder weapon.{{sfn|Darden|1996}} Clark's case was supported by DNA evidence, and she expected a conviction. From the physical evidence that was collected, the prosecution claimed that Simpson drove to Brown's house on the evening of June 12 with the intention of killing her. They maintained that Brown had put their two children to bed and was getting ready to go to bed herself when she opened the front door of her house after either responding to a knock on the front door or hearing a noise outside. Simpson allegedly grabbed her before she could scream and attacked her with a knife. Forensic evidence from the [[Los Angeles County]] [[coroner]] alleged that Goldman arrived at the front gate to the townhouse sometime during the assault, and the assailant apparently attacked him and stabbed him repeatedly in the neck and chest with one hand while restraining him with an arm [[chokehold]]. Brown was found lying face down when authorities arrived at the crime scene. According to the prosecution's account, after Simpson had finished with Goldman, he pulled Brown's head back using her hair, put his foot on her back, and slit her throat with the knife, severing her [[carotid artery]].&lt;ref name="court tv 17"/&gt; They argued further that Simpson left a "trail of blood" from the condo to the alley behind it; there was also testimony that three drops of Simpson's blood were found on the driveway near the gate to his house on Rockingham Drive.&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite web |title=Proving the Case: The Science of DNA: DNA Evidence in the O.J. Simpson Trial |publisher=William Thompson |url=http://phobos.ramapo.edu/~jweiss/laws131/unit3/simpson.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121212205439/http://phobos.ramapo.edu/~jweiss/laws131/unit3/simpson.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 12, 2012 |accessdate=December 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the prosecution, Simpson was last seen in public at 9:36&amp;nbsp;p.m. that evening when he returned to the front gate of his house with Kaelin, a bit-part actor and family friend who had been given the use of a guest house on Simpson's estate. Simpson was not seen again until 10:54&amp;nbsp;p.m. – an hour and eighteen minutes later – when he came out of the front door of his house to a waiting [[limousine]] he had hired to take him to [[Los Angeles International Airport]] to fly to a [[Hertz]] convention in Chicago. The defense and prosecution both agreed that the murders took place between 10:15 and 10:40&amp;nbsp;p.m., with the prosecution alleging that Simpson had driven his Bronco during the required five minutes to and from the murder scene. They presented a witness in the vicinity of Bundy Drive who saw a car similar to Simpson's Bronco speeding away from the area at 10:35&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt;

Limousine driver Allan Park testified that he arrived at Simpson's estate at 10:24&amp;nbsp;p.m. Driving past the Rockingham gate, he did not see Simpson's Bronco parked at the curb. Park testified that he had been looking for and had seen the house number, and the prosecution presented exhibits to show that the position in which the Bronco was found the next morning was right next to the house number (implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there at that time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jared Grimmer |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/Simpson/parktest.html |title=Testimony of limo driver Allan Park in the O. J. Simpson trial |publisher=Law.umkc.edu |accessdate=May 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Simpson's version of events, the Bronco had been parked in that position for several hours. Meanwhile, Kaelin was in his guest house and on the telephone to his friend, Rachel Ferrara. Park parked opposite the Ashford Street gate, then drove back to the Rockingham gate to check which driveway would have the best access for the limo. Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the [[intercom]] at 10:40, getting no response. Park got out of the limo and looked through the Ashford gate and saw that the house was dark with no lights on, except for a dim light coming from one of the second floor windows, which was Simpson's bedroom. While smoking a cigarette, Park made a series of phone calls from his cellular to the [[pager]] of his boss, Dale St. John, and then to Park's home, trying to get St. John's home phone number from his mother in an attempt to get the phone number for Simpson's house. At approximately 10:50, Kaelin (who was still on the phone to Ferrara) heard three thumps against the outside wall of his guest house. Kaelin hung up the phone and ventured outside to investigate the noises, but decided not to venture directly down the dark south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, he walked to the front of the property and saw Park's limo outside the Ashford gate.

At the same time Park saw Kaelin come from the back of the property to the front, he testified that directly behind Kaelin a short distance away that he saw "a tall black man" of Simpson's height and build enter the front door of the house from the driveway area, after which lights were turned on and Simpson finally answered Park's call.{{Citation needed | reason = Reliable source needed for the whole sentence |date=June 2017}} Simpson explained that he had overslept and would be at the front gate soon. Kaelin opened the Ashford gate to let Park drive the limo onto the estate grounds, and Simpson came out of his house through the front door a few minutes later. Both Kaelin and Park helped Simpson put his belongings (which were already outside the front door when Park drove up to the front of Simpson's house) into the trunk of the limo for the ride to the airport. Both Kaelin and Park remarked in their testimony that Simpson looked agitated. But other witnesses, including the ticket clerk at LAX who checked Simpson onto the plane and a flight attendant, said that Simpson looked and acted perfectly normal. Conflicting testimony such as this was to be a recurring theme throughout the trial.

Simpson's initial claim that he was asleep at the time of the murders was refuted by several different accounts. According to defense lawyer [[Johnnie Cochran]], Simpson had never left his house that night, and he was alone as he packed his belongings to travel to Chicago. Cochran claimed that Simpson went outside through the back door to hit a few golf balls into the children's sandbox in the front garden, one or more of which made the three loud thumps on the wall of Kaelin's bungalow. Cochran produced a potential [[alibi]] witness, Rosa Lopez, a neighbor's [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking housekeeper who testified that she had seen Simpson's car parked outside his house at the time of the murders. However, Lopez's account, which was not presented to the jury, was pulled apart under intense [[cross-examination]] by Clark, when she was forced to admit that she could not be sure of the precise time she saw Simpson's Bronco outside his house.

The defense tried to convince the jury that Simpson was not physically capable of carrying out the murders, saying that Goldman was a fit young man who put up a fierce struggle against his assailant. Simpson was a 46-year-old former professional football player with chronic [[arthritis]], and had scars on his knees from old football injuries. However, Clark produced into evidence an exercise video that Simpson made a few months before the murders titled ''O.J. Simpson Minimum Maintenance: Fitness For Men,'' which showed that, despite some physical conditions and limitations, Simpson was anything but frail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1995-07-19/news/9507190140_1_simpson-videotape-huizenga|title=Exercise Video Shows O.J.

The prosecution called Brown's sister, Denise, to the witness stand. She tearfully testified to many episodes of domestic violence in the 1980s, when she saw Simpson pick up his wife and hurl her against a wall, then physically throw her out of their house during an argument. The prosecution then called Karen Lee Crawford, the manager of the Mezzaluna restaurant where Brown ate on the night she was murdered. Crawford recounted that Brown's mother phoned the restaurant at 9:37&amp;nbsp;p.m. about a pair of lost eyeglasses. Crawford found them and put them in a white envelope. Goldman left the restaurant at 9:50&amp;nbsp;p.m. after his shift, taking the glasses to drop them off at Brown's house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jodi Enda|title=Dog Led Neighbors To Body The Akita Took The Couple To The Slain Nicole Simpson.

Brown's neighbor, [[Pablo Fenjves]], testified about hearing a "very distinctive barking" and "plaintive wail" of a dog at around ten to fifteen minutes after 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. while he was at home watching the news on television. Eva Stein, another neighbor, testified about very loud and persistent barking, also at around 10:15&amp;nbsp;p.m., that kept her from going back to sleep. Neighbor Steven Schwab testified that while he was walking his dog in the area near Brown's house at around 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., he noticed Brown's wandering and agitated [[Akita (dog)|Akita dog]] trailing its leash. He saw that it had bloody paws, but after examining it, he found the dog uninjured. Schwab said he took the dog to a neighbor friend of his, Sukru Boztepe, before taking it into his home where it became more agitated. Boztepe took the dog for a walk at approximately 12:00 midnight and testified that it tugged on its leash and led him to Brown's house. There he discovered Brown's dead body. Minutes later, Boztepe flagged down a passing patrol car.

Riske, the first officer at the crime scene, testified that he found a barefoot woman in a black dress lying face down in a puddle of blood on the walkway that led to the front door of her house. He next saw Goldman's body a short distance away, lying on its side beside a tree and off the walkway. Riske said he saw a white envelope, which was later found to contain the glasses left at the restaurant by Brown's mother. He also saw Goldman's beeper, a black leather glove, and a dark blue knit ski cap on the ground near the bodies. The front door of Brown's house was wide open, but there were no signs of forced entry nor any evidence that anyone had entered the premises. Nothing inside was out of the ordinary.

On Sunday, February 12, 1995, a long motorcade traveled to Brentwood and the jurors, prosecutors, defense lawyers, and Judge Ito made a two-hour inspection of the crime scene. It was followed by a three-hour tour of Simpson's estate. Simpson was under guard by several officers but did not wear [[handcuff]]s; he waited outside the crime scene in and around an unmarked police car and was permitted to enter his house.

Detective Ron Phillips testified that when he called Simpson in Chicago to tell him of his ex-wife's murder, he sounded shocked and upset, but did not ask about how she died. Lange testified that Brown was probably killed first because the soles of her bare feet were clean, implying that she was struck down to the ground before any blood flowed. This was a key point that suggested Simpson might have set out to kill Brown, whereas Goldman appeared to have inadvertently stumbled upon the scene, prompting Simpson to kill him as well. In cross-examining Lange, Cochran proposed two [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] for what happened at the murder scene. First, he suggested that one or more drug dealers encountered Brown while looking for her friend and house guest, Faye Resnick, an admitted [[cocaine]] abuser. In the second hypothesis, Cochran suggested that "an assassin, or assassins," followed Goldman to Brown's house to kill him.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Evidence presented to the jury===
The prosecution offered [[circumstantial evidence]] to show Simpson's guilt.&lt;ref name="court tv 16"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/ojsimpson/weekly/16.html|title=Week 16: May 8–12, 1995|date=June 5, 2004|publisher=[[Court TV]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202233509/http://www.courttv.com/trials/ojsimpson/weekly/16.html|archivedate=February 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* DNA analysis of blood discovered on a pair of Simpson's socks found in his bedroom identified it as Brown's. The blood had DNA characteristics matched by approximately only one in 9.7&amp;nbsp;billion, with odds falling to one out of 21&amp;nbsp;billion when compiling results of testing done at the two separate DNA laboratories.&lt;ref name="court tv 17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="court tv 16"/&gt; Both socks had about twenty stains of blood.&lt;ref name="court tv 17"/&gt; The blood made a similar pattern on both sides of the socks. Defense medical expert [[Henry Lee (forensic scientist)|Dr. Henry Lee]] of the Connecticut State Police Forensic Science Laboratory testified that the only way such a pattern could appear was if Simpson had a "hole" in his ankle, or a drop of blood was placed on the sock while it was not being worn. Lee also testified that the collection procedure of the socks could have caused contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Testimony of Dr. Henry Lee in the O.J.

* Strands of hair consistent with Simpson's were found on Goldman's shirt.&lt;ref name = "Evidence" /&gt;
* Several coins were found along with fresh blood drops behind Brown's [[condominium]], in the area where the cars were parked.
* DNA analysis of blood on a left-hand glove, found outside Brown's home, showed that it was a mixture of Simpson's, Brown's, and Goldman's blood. Although the glove was soaked in blood, there were no blood drops leading up to, or away from the glove. No other blood was found in the area of the glove except on the glove.&lt;ref name = "Evidence" /&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2016}}

* Officers found arrest records indicating that Simpson was charged in 1989 with beating Brown. Photos of Brown's bruised and battered face from that attack were shown to the court.
* Much of the incriminating evidence – bloody glove, bloody socks, blood in and on the Bronco – was discovered by LAPD Detective Mark Fuhrman. He was later charged with [[perjury]] for falsely claiming during the trial that he had not used the word "[[nigger]]" within ten years of the trial. Later during the trial, with the jury absent, he invoked the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] against [[self-incrimination]] when asked "did you plant or manufacture any evidence in this case?"&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/Simpson/transcript.html Simpson trial transcript] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910032810/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/Simpson/transcript.html |date=September 10, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2016 interview, Dershowitz suggested that Detective Philip Vannatter {{ndash}} not Fuhrman {{ndash}} may have planted evidence on socks, based upon the presence of anti-coagulant in the blood discovered on the socks.&lt;ref name="FoxKelly2016-02-03"&gt;Fox News, The Kelly Files, 2016-02-03, Interview of Alan Dershowitz.&lt;/ref&gt; Dershowitz said that the jury may have concluded that if the bloody socks were fabricated by the police, then other evidence may have been fabricated as well.&lt;ref name=FoxKelly2016-02-03/&gt; F.B.I. expert testimony said that the defense exaggerated the significance of the presence of the anti-coagulant.&lt;ref name="FBI-Blood-socks"&gt;F.B.I.

* The bloody shoe prints at the crime scene were identified by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] shoe expert William Bodziak as having been made by a pair of extremely rare and expensive [[Bruno Magli]] shoes; only 29 pairs of this style were sold in the U.S.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt; The large size 12 (305&amp;nbsp;mm) prints matched Simpson's shoe size.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt; In the trial, Simpson's defense attorneys said the prosecution had no proof Simpson had ever bought such shoes. There were no witnesses who testified to selling Simpson the shoes and there wasn’t any receipts recovered that indicated he bought the shoes.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt; But freelance photographer E.J. Flammer claimed to have found a photograph he had taken of Simpson in 1993 that appeared to show him wearing a pair of the shoes at a public event, which was later published in the ''National Enquirer.'' Simpson's defense team claimed that the photograph was doctored, but other pre-1994 photos appearing to show Simpson wearing Bruno Magli shoes were later discovered and published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=O.J. feels the heat |journal=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,985629-5,00.html |date=December 2, 1996 |accessdate=March 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of these photos were shown until late in the trial and not during the "big shoe debate".&lt;ref&gt;trial transcript&lt;/ref&gt;
* Evidence collected by LAPD criminalist Dennis Fung was criticized by the defense. He admitted to "having missed a few drops of blood on a fence near the bodies;" on the stand he said that he "returned several weeks afterwards to collect them."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;
* Fung admitted that he had not used rubber gloves when collecting some of the evidence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; But the blood tested had no DNA from Fung, within published guidelines.
* Vannatter testified that he saw photographs of press personnel leaning on Simpson's Bronco before evidence was collected.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===Evidence not presented to the jury===
* At the June 1994 grand jury hearing, Ross Cutlery provided store receipts indicating that Simpson had purchased a 12-inch (305&amp;nbsp;mm) [[stiletto]] knife from salesman Jose Camacho six weeks before the murders. The knife was determined to be similar to the one the coroner said caused the stab wounds. The prosecution did not present this evidence at trial after discovering that Camacho had sold his story to the ''National Enquirer'' for $12,500.&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt; The knife was later collected from Simpson's residence by his attorneys; they presented it to Judge Ito and it was subsequently sealed in a manila envelope to be opened only if brought up at trial. This was not the murder weapon: tests on the knife determined that an oil used on new cutlery was still present on the knife, indicating it had never been used. The police searched Simpson's estate three times and could not find this knife. Simpson told his attorneys exactly where it was in the house and it was promptly recovered.{{sfn|Schiller|Willwerth|1996}}
* Jill Shively testified to the 1994 grand jury that she saw a white Ford Bronco speeding away from Bundy Drive in such a hurry that it almost collided with another car at an intersection. She talked to the television show ''Hard Copy'' for $5,000, after which prosecutors declined to use her testimony at trial.&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt;
* A women's shelter, Sojourn, received a call from Brown four days prior to the murders; she said that she was afraid of her ex-husband, who she believed was [[stalking]] her. The prosecution did not present this information in court because they thought that Judge Ito would rule the evidence to be [[hearsay]]. In addition, friends and family indicated that Brown had consistently said that Simpson had been stalking her. Her friends Resnick and Cynthia Shahian said she was afraid because Simpson had told her he would kill her if he ever found her with another man.&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt;
* Former [[National Football League|NFL]] player and [[pastor]] [[Rosey Grier]] visited Simpson at the [[Men's Central Jail|Los Angeles County Jail]] in the days following the murders. A jailhouse guard, Jeff Stuart, testified to Judge Ito that at one point Simpson yelled to Grier that he "didn't mean to do it," after which Grier had urged Simpson to come clean. Ito ruled that the evidence was hearsay and could not be allowed in court.&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt;
* The events of the Bronco chase, and the materials in the Bronco including the cash, handgun, and disguise, were not presented to the jury. The prosecution did not cover Simpson's apparent suicide note and statement to the police.
* A few months before the 1994 murders, Simpson completed a [[film pilot]] for ''Frogmen'', an adventure series in which he starred. Although the prosecution investigated reports that Simpson, who played the leader of a group of former [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEALs]], received "a fair amount of" military training {{ndash}} including use of a knife {{ndash}} for ''Frogmen'', and holds a knife to the throat of a woman in one scene, it was not introduced as evidence during the trial.&lt;ref name="lowry20000508"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/2000/may/08/entertainment/ca-27673 | title=The Saga of O.J.'s Last, Lost Pilot | accessdate=April 5, 2011 | author=Lowry, Brian | date=May 8, 2000 |work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The testimony of Lopez was recorded on videotape, but not shown to the jury.

===DNA evidence===
Samples from bloody shoe prints leading away from the bodies and from the back gate of the condo were tested for DNA matches.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt; Initial [[polymerase chain reaction]] testing did not rule out Simpson as a suspect. In more precise [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] tests, matches were found between Simpson's blood and blood samples taken from the crime scene (both the shoe prints in blood and the gate samples).&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt; Fung testified that this DNA evidence put Simpson at Brown's townhouse at the time of the murders. But defense expert [[Barry Scheck]] conducted an eight-day cross-examination questioning most of the DNA evidence. Dr. Robin Cotton, of Cellmark Diagnostics, testified for six days. Blood evidence had been tested at two separate laboratories, each conducting different tests.&lt;ref name="court tv 17"/&gt; At this time, the general population was still unfamiliar with the precision and significance of DNA matching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/from-the-crime-scene-to-the-courtroom-the-journey-of-a-dna-sample-82250|title=From the crime scene to the courtroom: the journey of a DNA sample|last=Curtis|first=Caitlin|date=August 29, 2017|work=The Conversation|access-date=October 14, 2017|last2=Hereward|first2=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It emerged during the cross-examination of Fung and the other laboratory scientists that LAPD scientist Andrea Mazzola (who collected blood samples from Simpson to compare with evidence from the crime scene) was a trainee who carried the vial of Simpson's blood around in her lab coat pocket for nearly a day before handing it over as an exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Robin |date=April 28, 1995 |title=Criminalist Assailed At Trial Of O.J.

The prosecution argued that they had made the DNA evidence available to the defense for its own testing, and if the defense attorneys disagreed with the prosecution's tests, they could have conducted their own testing on the same samples. The defense had chosen not to accept the prosecution's offer.&lt;ref name="court tv 17"/&gt;

On May 16, Gary Sims, a [[California Department of Justice]] criminalist who helped establish their DNA laboratory, testified that a glove found at Simpson's house tested positive for a match of Goldman's blood.&lt;ref name="court tv 17"/&gt;

===Mark Fuhrman===
{{main|Mark Fuhrman}}
[[File:Mfuhr.jpg|thumb|upright|Mark Fuhrman in 2008]]
In March 1995, Fuhrman testified to driving over to Simpson's house to question him on the night of the murders. After getting no response when buzzing the intercom of the house, which appeared empty, he scaled one of the outer walls to enter the property. He found blood marks on the driveway of the house, as well as a black leather glove on the premises near the location of Kaelin's bungalow. It was later found to have the blood of both murder victims on it, as well as Simpson's, matched through DNA analysis.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt;

Despite an aggressive cross-examination by [[F. Lee Bailey]],&lt;ref name="usa today5"&gt;{{cite news |title=Some who helped shape the O.J. Simpson case |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=January 28, 1997 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/index/nns182.htm |accessdate=December 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuhrman denied on the stand that he was racist or had used the word "nigger" to describe black people in the ten years prior to his testimony.&lt;ref name="usa today5"/&gt; However, a few months later, the defense played audio tapes of Fuhrman repeatedly using the word – 41 times, in total. The tapes had been made between 1985 and 1994 by a young [[North Carolina]] screenwriter named Laura McKinney, who had interviewed Fuhrman at length for a screenplay she was writing on police officers. The [[Fuhrman tapes]] became one of the cornerstones of the defense's case that Fuhrman's testimony lacked credibility.

With the jury absent, Fuhrman was called back to the witness stand by the defense to answer more questions about the discovery of the blood marks and leather glove that he found on Simpson's property. When questioned by attorney [[Gerald Uelmen]], Fuhrman, with his lawyer standing by his side, invoked the Fifth Amendment to avoid self-incrimination and further questioning after his integrity was challenged. The prosecution told the jury in closing arguments that Fuhrman was a racist, but said that this should not detract from the factual evidence that showed Simpson's guilt.&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt; Fuhrman's testimony resulted in his indictment on one count of perjury; he later pleaded no contest.

Fuhrman has stated that he is not a racist and apologized for his previous use of racist language.&lt;ref name=philly/&gt; Many of his [[Ethnic minority|minority]] former coworkers have expressed support for him.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-08/news/mn-771_1_mark-fuhrman|title=Co-Workers Paint Different Portrait of Mark Fuhrman : LAPD: In contrast to racist boasts on tapes, black, Latino colleagues describe a hard-working, unbiased cop.|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The glove===
One dark leather glove was found at the crime scene, with its match found near Kaelin's guest house behind Simpson's estate. Kaelin testified that he had heard "thumps in the night" in the same area around the guest house the night of the murder. Brown had bought Simpson two pairs of this type of glove in 1990. Both gloves, according to the prosecution, contained DNA evidence from Simpson, Brown and Goldman. The glove at Simpson's house also contained a long strand of blonde hair similar to Brown's.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt;

On June 15, 1995, Bailey goaded Darden into asking Simpson to put on the leather glove that was found at the scene of the crime. The prosecution had earlier decided against asking Simpson to try on the gloves because the glove had been soaked in blood from Simpson, Brown and Goldman,&lt;ref name="court tv 17"/&gt; and frozen and unfrozen several times. The leather glove seemed too tight for Simpson to put on easily, especially over the sanitary gloves he wore underneath.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt; Uelmen came up with, and Cochran repeated, a quip he had used several times in relation to other points in his closing arguments: "If it doesn't fit, you must acquit". 

On June 22, 1995, Darden told Judge Ito of his concerns that Simpson "has [[arthritis]] and we looked at the medication he takes and some of it is anti-inflammatory and we are told he has not taken the stuff for a day and it caused swelling in the joints and inflammation in his hands". However, this theory was debunked by Cochran who informed Judge Ito on the record the next day that [[Shawn Chapman]] contacted the Los Angeles County Jail doctor who confirmed Simpson was taking his medication every day and that the jail’s medical records verified this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=O.J. and the Gloves: What Really Happened |url=https://ojsimpson.co/o-j-and-the-gloves-what-really-happened/
|website=ojsimpson.co |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He said Simpson “takes his medicine every day and that he has never at any time not taken his medicine for his [[rheumatoid arthritis]], sulfathiazole I think it's called, and that the records at the jail so indicate that. And I think that the record should be made clear in that regard. And we took the further statement, as I said, to talk to Dr. Johnson this morning who verifies that fact also. So I felt compelled to indicate that to the Court.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=June 23 1995 trial transcripts|url=https://simpson.walraven.org/jun23.html
|website=walraven.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The prosecution also stated their belief that the glove shrank from having been soaked in blood and later testing.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt; They presented a photo during the trial of Simpson earlier wearing the same type of glove that was found at the crime scene.

Prosecutors claimed that the presence of Simpson's blood at the crime scene was the result of blood dripping from cuts on the middle finger of his left hand. Police had noted his wounds and asserted that these were suffered during the fatal attack on Goldman. However, the defense showed that none of the gloves retrieved at the crime scene had any cuts in them. Plus, both prosecution and defense witnesses testified that they did not see cuts or wounds of any kind on Simpson's hands in the hours after the murders took place. The defense alleged that Fuhrman may have planted the glove at Simpson's house after taking it from the crime scene. The analysis that found that the hair could be Brown's was not reliable.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt; The prosecution contended that the glove had not been moved. They noted that by the time Fuhrman had arrived at the Simpson home, the crime scene at Brown's home had already been combed over by several officers for almost two hours, and none had noticed a second glove at the scene. In his first round of testimony, Fuhrman answered "no" when asked by Bailey if he had planted any evidence at Simpson's house. In his second round of testimony after the tapes had been revealed, Fuhrman took the Fifth Amendment when asked the same question by Uelmen.

In May 2008, [[Mike Gilbert (sports agent)|Mike Gilbert]], one of Simpson's former sports agents, released his book ''How I Helped O.J. Get Away with Murder'', in which he revealed that the gloves did not
fit because, on his advice, Simpson had stopped taking his arthritis medicine, which made his hands swell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0805/12/ng.01.html|title=CNN.com – Transcripts|website=transcripts.cnn.com|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reference"&gt;"[[O.J.: Made in America]]", Episode 4&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8, 2012, Darden accused Cochran of [[False evidence|tampering]] with the glove before the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2012/09/ex-prosecutor--oj-simpson-lawyer-tampered-with-glove/1|title=Ex-prosecutor: O.J. Simpson lawyer tampered with glove|work=USA Today|accessdate=September 8, 2012|date=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dershowitz, a member of the Simpson defense team, refuted the claim, stating "the defense doesn't get access to evidence except under controlled circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2012/09/ex-prosecutor--oj-simpson-lawyer-tampered-with-glove/1|title=Ex-prosecutor: O.J. Simpson lawyer tampered with glove|publisher=|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Racial issues ===
In closing arguments, Darden ridiculed the notion that police officers might have wanted to frame Simpson.&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt; He questioned why, if the LAPD was against Simpson, they went to his house eight times on domestic violence calls against Brown between 1986 and 1988 but did not arrest him; they only arrested him on charges of abuse in January 1989 (when photos of Brown's face were entered into the record). Darden noted the police did not arrest Simpson for five days after the 1994 murders.&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt;

In Cochran's summation to the jury, he emphasized that Fuhrman was proved to have repeatedly referred to African-Americans as "niggers" and also to have boasted of beating young African-Americans in his role as a police officer. Cochran's rhetoric was later criticized by Shapiro and by at least one juror,&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt; as well as Goldman's father, Fred Goldman. Cochran called Fuhrman "a [[genocide|genocidal]] racist, a perjurer, America's worst nightmare and the personification of evil".&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt; Fuhrman later pleaded no contest to a felony charge of perjury, which had arisen from his testimony in Simpson's trial.

Fears grew that [[race riot]]s would erupt across Los Angeles and the rest of the country if Simpson was convicted of the murders, similar to the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|riots in 1992]] which occurred after the acquittal of four police officers for the beating of black motorist [[Rodney King]] (King's beating was captured on an amateur video). As a result, all Los Angeles police officers were put on 12-hour shifts. The police arranged for more than 100 police officers on horseback to surround the Los Angeles County courthouse on the day the verdict was announced, in case of rioting by the crowd.

==Defense case==
[[File:JohnnieCochran 2001.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Johnnie Cochran]] in 2001]]
Simpson hired a team of high-profile defense lawyers, including Bailey, Kardashian, Shapiro, Dershowitz, Cochran, Uelmen (then the dean of law at [[Santa Clara University]]), [[Carl E. Douglas]] and [[Shawn Holley]]. Two attorneys specializing in DNA evidence, Scheck and [[Peter Neufeld]], were hired to attempt to discredit the prosecution's DNA evidence.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; They argued that Simpson was the victim of [[police fraud]] and what they termed as sloppy internal procedures, which had contaminated the DNA evidence.&lt;ref name="court tv 17"/&gt; Simpson's defense was said to have cost between US$3&amp;nbsp;million and $6&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="usa today6"&gt;{{cite news |title=Fight over money may follow court battle |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=January 28, 1997 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/index/nns183.htm |accessdate=December 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson's defense team, dubbed the "[[Dream Team (law)|Dream Team]]" by reporters, argued that Fuhrman had planted evidence at the crime scene. LAPD criminalists Fung and Mazzola were subject to strong scrutiny.

Simpson's defense sought to show that one or more hit men hired by drug dealers had murdered Brown and Goldman – giving both "[[Colombian necktie]]s" – because they were looking for Brown's friend, Faye Resnick, a known cocaine user who had failed to pay for her drugs. However, Judge Ito barred testimony about Resnick's drug use. She had stayed for several days at Brown's condo until entering [[drug rehabilitation|rehab]] four days before the killings. Ito stated that the defense had failed to provide sufficient direct or circumstantial evidence that the scenario was possible, indicating: "I find that the [[offer of proof]] regarding motive to be highly speculative." Consequently, he prohibited Christian Reichardt from testifying about his former girlfriend Resnick's drug problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=Chicago Tribune|title=Testimony On Resnick Drugs Barred|date=July 13, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Simpson Defense Presses Drug Link A Detective Faced A Barrage Of Questions.

==Verdict==
At 10:07&amp;nbsp;a.m. on October 3, 1995, Simpson was acquitted on both counts of murder. The only testimony reviewed was that of limo driver Alan Park, who had said that he did not see Simpson's Bronco outside of his estate when he arrived to pick him up after the murders occurred. The jury arrived at the verdict by 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on October 2, after four hours of [[deliberation]], but Judge Ito postponed the announcement.{{sfn|Dershowitz|2004}}

Before the verdict, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] was briefed on security measures if rioting occurred nationwide due to the verdict. An estimated 100 million people worldwide watched or listened to the verdict announcement. Long-distance telephone call volume declined by 58%, and trading volume on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] decreased by 41%. Water usage decreased as people avoided using bathrooms.

The [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] received a message on the verdict during [[oral arguments]], with the [[Supreme Court Justice|justices]] quietly passing the note to each other while listening to the attorney's presentation. Congressmen canceled press conferences, with one telling reporters, "Not only would you not be here, but I wouldn't be here, either".&lt;ref name="duggan19951004"&gt;{{cite news | title=Washington Comes to a Stop; Then Pent-Up Emotions Start Spilling Out | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=October 4, 1995 | accessdate=January 28, 2012 | author=Duggan, Paul | page=A1 |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-856074.html |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction to the verdict===
In post-trial interviews, a few of the jurors said that they believed Simpson probably did commit the murders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jurors say evidence made the case for Simpson |publisher=CNN |date=October 4, 1995 |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/OJ/daily/9510/10-04/jurors_speak/index.html |accessdate=June 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that the prosecution had failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. Three jurors together wrote and published a book called ''Madam Foreman,''{{sfn|Cooley|Bess|Rubin-Jackson|Byrnes|1996}} in which they described how their perception of police errors, not race, led to their verdict. They said that they considered Darden to be a [[Tokenism|token black]] assigned to the case by the prosecutor's office.&lt;ref name="usa today5"/&gt;

Critics of the jury's not-guilty verdict contended that the deliberation time was unduly short in comparison to the length of the trial. Some said that the jurors, most of whom did not have any college education, did not understand the forensic evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Matthew |last=Hutson |title=Unnatural Selection |journal=[[Psychology Today]] |date=March–April 2007 |url=http://psychologytoday.com/articles/index.php?term=pto-20070302-000001&amp;page=3 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20071012133039/http://psychologytoday.com/articles/index.php?term=pto-20070302-000001&amp;page=3 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 12, 2007 |accessdate=June 16, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the verdict was read, juror number six, 44-year-old Lionel Cryer, gave Simpson a [[raised fist|black power raised fist]] salute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/03/usa.garyyounge|title=Gary Younge: OJ Simpson and America, ten years after the trial|author=Gary Younge|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Cryer was a former member of the revolutionary nationalist [[Black Panther Party]] that prosecutors had "inexplicably left on the panel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/04/us/not-guilty-overview-jury-clears-simpson-double-murder-spellbound-nation-divides.html|title=Jury Clears Simpson in Double Murder; Spellbound Nation Divides on Verdict|date=October 4, 1995|website=The New York Times|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Cochran wrote and published a book about the trial. It was titled ''Journey to Justice,'' and described his involvement in the case.{{sfn|Cochran|1997}} That same year, fellow defense attorney Shapiro also published a book about the trial, entitled ''The Search for Justice.'' He criticized Bailey as a "loose cannon" and Cochran for bringing race into the trial.{{sfn|Shapiro|Warren|1996}} In contrast to Cochran's book, Shapiro said that he does not believe that Simpson was framed by the LAPD for racial reasons, but believed the verdict was correct due to reasonable doubt.&lt;ref name="usa today5"/&gt;

Clark published a book about the case titled ''Without a Doubt'' (1998).{{sfn|Clark|1998}} Her book recounts the trial proceedings, from jury selection to final summation. She concluded that nothing could have saved her case, given the defense's strategy of highlighting racial issues related to Simpson and the LAPD, and the predominance of blacks on the jury. In Clark's opinion, the prosecution's factual evidence, particularly the DNA, should have easily convicted Simpson. That it did not, she says, attests to a judicial system compromised by issues of race and celebrity.

Former Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney [[Vincent Bugliosi]] wrote a book titled ''[[Outrage: The Five Reasons Why O. J. Simpson Got Away with Murder]]'' (1997). Bugliosi was very critical of Clark and Darden, faulting them, among other reasons, for not introducing the note that Simpson had written before trying to flee. He contended that the note "reeked" of guilt and that the jury should have been allowed to see it. He also noted that the jury was never informed about items found in the Bronco. The prosecution said that they felt these items of evidence would bring up emotional issues on Simpson's part that could harm their case, despite the fact that the items seemed as though they could be used for fleeing.&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt;{{sfn|Bugliosi|1997}} Bugliosi also said the prosecutors should have gone into more detail about Simpson's domestic abuse; that the prosecution should have presented evidence contrary to the defense's assertion that Simpson was a leader in the black community; and criticized the prosecution's closing statements as inadequate.{{sfn|Bugliosi|1997}} Bugliosi also criticized the prosecution for trying the murder in Los Angeles rather than Santa Monica.&lt;ref name="bugliosi"/&gt; During the jury selection process, the defense made it difficult for the prosecution to challenge potential black jurors, on the grounds that it is illegal to dismiss someone from the jury for racially motivated reasons. (California courts barred [[peremptory challenge]]s to jurors based on race in ''People v. Wheeler'',&lt;ref&gt;22 Cal. 3d 258, 583 P. 2d 748 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; years before the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] would do so in ''[[Batson v. Kentucky]]'').&lt;ref&gt;476 U.S. 79 (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

District Attorney Garcetti's supporters noted that the decision to move the trial was made by the Los Angeles Superior Court Presiding Judge, and not by Garcetti. The trial was moved due to security concerns at the smaller facility and the poor physical condition of the Santa Monica Courthouse.&lt;ref name="bugliosi"&gt;{{cite news |title= Bugliosi vs. Garcetti: Author Opens Fire on District Attorney | newspaper=Metropolitan News Enterprise|date=June 7, 2010|url=http://www.metnews.com/articles/2010/perspectives060710.htm |accessdate=July 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 review, the ''[[Metropolitan News-Enterprise]]'' said that Garcetti had "[[micromanagement|micromanaged]]" the trial, and that he had decided to have Simpson try on the gloves in open court that had been recovered at the murder scene and at Simpson's estate. Also, pundits criticized the prosecution for calling Fuhrman to the witness stand in the first place; they criticized the prosecution for lack of due diligence, which should have discovered his earlier racist statements. The D.A.'s office argued that the defense would have called Fuhrman anyway and that no one knew of the existence of the McKinney tapes until after the trial started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Garcetti Draws Criticism for 'Micromanagement,' the Glove Debacle, the Fuhrman Fiasco | newspaper=Metropolitan News Enterprise|date=June 22, 2010 |url=http://www.metnews.com/articles/2010/perspectives062210.htm |accessdate=July 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussion of the racial elements of the case continued long after the trial's end. Some polls and commentators have concluded that many blacks, while having their doubts as to Simpson's innocence, were more inclined to be suspicious of the credibility and fairness of the police and the courts, and thus more likely to question the evidence. The LAPD had a history of abusing African-Americans in the city, which was emphasized in the Rodney King case. After the [[civil lawsuit|civil verdict]] against Simpson, most whites surveyed said they believed justice had been served. Most blacks (75%) disagreed with the verdict and believed that it was racially motivated.&lt;ref name="usa today4"/&gt; An NBC poll taken in 2004 reported that, although 77% of 1,186 people sampled thought Simpson was guilty, only 27% of blacks in the sample believed so, compared to 87% of whites. The Simpson case continues to be assessed through the lens of race. In 2016, ''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'' reported that most black people now think Simpson was guilty.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news |title= Most Black People Now Think O.J. Was Guilty | website=FiveThirtyEight|date=June 6, 2016 |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-black-people-now-think-oj-simpson-was-guilty/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2016 poll, 83% of white Americans and 57% of black Americans believe Simpson was guilty of the murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/25/black-and-white-americans-can-now-agree-o-j-was-guilty/ |title=Two decades later, black and white Americans finally agree on O.J.

==Media coverage==
{{quote|When the trial began, all of the networks were getting these hate-mail letters because people's soap operas were being interrupted for the Simpson trial. But then what happened was the people who liked soap operas got addicted to the Simpson trial. And they got really upset when the Simpson trial was over, and people would come up to me on the street and say, 'God, I loved your show.'|Marcia Clark, 2010{{r|anolik201406}}}}

The murders and trial – "the biggest story I have ever seen", said a producer of NBC's ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' – received extensive media coverage from the very beginning; at least one [[instant book]] was proposed two hours after the bodies were found, and scheduled to publish only a few weeks later.&lt;ref name="ew" /&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' covered the case on its front page for more than 300 days after the murders. The [[Big Three television networks]]' nightly news broadcasts gave more air time to the case than to the [[Bosnian War]] and the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] combined. The media outlets served an enthusiastic audience; one company put the loss of national productivity from employees following the case instead of working at $40&amp;nbsp;billion.{{sfn|Schuetz|Lilley|1999|pp=22–23}} ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' aired many skits on the trial, and the Dancing Itos – a troupe of dancers dressed as the judge – was a popular recurring segment.&lt;ref name="dancing its"&gt;{{cite episode | title=Dancing It's | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQPVA2bGsB4&amp;t=2m | series=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno | network=NBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants in the case received much media coverage. Fans approached Clark at restaurants and malls, and when she got a new hairstyle during the trial, the prosecutor received a standing ovation on the courthouse steps; ''[[People magazine|People]]'' approved of the change, but advised her to wear "more fitted suits and tailored skirts". While Cochran, Bailey, and Dershowitz were already well known, others like Kaelin became celebrities, and Resnick and Simpson's girlfriend [[Paula Barbieri]] appeared in ''[[Playboy magazine|Playboy]]''. Those involved in the trial followed their own media coverage; when [[Larry King]] appeared in the courtroom after a meeting with Ito, both Simpson and Clark praised [[Larry King Live|King's talk show]]. Interest in the case was worldwide; [[Russia]]n president [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s first question to President Clinton when they met in 1995 was, "Do you think O.J. did it?".&lt;ref name="anolik201406"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Anolik |first=Lili |date=June 2014 |title=How O. J. Simpson Killed Popular Culture |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/style/society/2014/06/oj-simpson-trial-reality-tv-pop-culture |magazine=Vanity Fair |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of whether or not to allow any video cameras into the courtroom was among the first issues Judge Ito had to decide, ultimately ruling that live camera coverage was warranted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/oj/interviews/arenella.html FRONTLINE: the o.j. verdict: interviews: Peter arenella]. PBS. Retrieved December 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Ito would be later criticized for this decision by other legal professionals. Dershowitz said that he believed that Ito, along with others related to the case such as Clark, Fuhrman, and Kaelin, was influenced to some degree by the media presence and related publicity. The trial was covered in 2,237 news segments from 1994 through 1997.{{sfn|Dershowitz|2004}} Ito was also criticized for allowing the trial to become a media circus and not doing enough to regulate the court proceedings as well as he could have.&lt;ref name="USA today3"&gt;{{cite news |title=Judge Fujisaki was able to keep trial in control | newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=February 5, 1997 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/index/nns200.htm |accessdate=December 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time'' became the subject of a [[media scandal]]. Commentators found that its staff had used [[photo manipulation]] to darken the photo, and speculated it was to make Simpson appear more menacing. After the publication of the photo drew widespread criticism of racist editorializing and [[yellow journalism]], ''Time'' publicly apologized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/photo_database/image/darkened_mug_shot/ O.J.'s Darkened Mug Shot].

==Aftermath==
In the February 1998 issue of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', Simpson was quoted as saying, "Let's say I committed this crime… Even if I did this, it would have to have been because I loved her very much, right?"&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jan/17/news/mn-9193&lt;/ref&gt;  

In April 1998, Simpson did an interview with talk show host [[Ruby Wax]]. As a joke, Simpson shows up at her hotel room, and waved a banana about his head, as if it were a knife, and pretended to stab Ruby with it. The footage soon made its way onto the US TV networks, causing predictable outrage.

===Civil trial===
In 1996, Fred Goldman and Sharon Rufo, the parents of Ron Goldman, filed a civil suit against Simpson for [[wrongful death]], while Brown's estate, represented by her father Lou Brown,&lt;ref name="usa today6"/&gt; brought suit against Simpson in a "survivor suit." The trial took place over four months in Santa Monica and, by judge's order, was not televised.&lt;ref name="USA today3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usa today1"/&gt; The Goldman family was represented by [[Daniel Petrocelli]], with Simpson represented by Bob Baker.&lt;ref name="usa today1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Both legal teams given high marks | newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=February 5, 1997 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/index/nns201.htm |accessdate=March 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attorneys for both sides were given high marks by observing lawyers.&lt;ref name="usa today1"/&gt; Simpson's defense in the trial was estimated to cost $1&amp;nbsp;million and was paid for by an insurance policy on his company, Orenthal Enterprises.&lt;ref name="usa today6"/&gt;

Fuhrman was not called to testify, and Simpson was [[subpoena]]ed to testify on his own behalf.&lt;ref name="usa today2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usa today4"/&gt; In addition, a photo of Simpson, taken while he was attending a [[Buffalo Bills]] game in 1993, was presented at trial that showed him wearing Bruno Magli shoes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.cnn.com/1997-01-06/us/9701_06_simpson_1_robert-groden-bruno-magli-shoes-photos?_s=PM:US | publisher=CNN | title=Photo expert resumes testimony in Simpson trial | date=December 20, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same type of shoes which investigators said the killer of Goldman and Brown was wearing when the murders were committed.&lt;ref name=ojcnn&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.cnn.com/1997-01-23/us/9701_23_shoe.sales_1_maglis-shoes-oj?_s=PM:US | publisher=CNN | title=Not much new in O.J. videotape | date=May 26, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photo was presented as evidence against him, as Simpson had previously denied ever wearing such shoes.&lt;ref name=ojcnn /&gt;

The jury in the civil trial awarded Brown and Simpson's children, Sydney and Justin (Brown's only children), $12.6&amp;nbsp;million from their father as recipients of their mother's estate.&lt;ref name="usa today2"/&gt; The victims' families were awarded $33.5&amp;nbsp;million in compensatory and punitive damages, thereby finding Simpson "responsible" for the respective murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/o-j-simpson |title=Black Biography: O. J. Simpson |author=Ellen Dennis French |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=December 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a Los Angeles superior court approved the plaintiffs' renewal application on the civil court judgment against Simpson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Court: Simpson Still Liable For $33.5M Judgment |publisher=NBC5.com |date=February 21, 2008 |url=http://www.nbc5.com/news/15364921/detail.html |accessdate=June 16, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009230444/http://www.nbc5.com/news/15364921/detail.html|archivedate=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four years after the trial, at an auction to pay some of the money in the compensation order, [[Bob Enyart]], a conservative [[Christian radio]] host, paid $16,000 for some of Simpson's memorabilia, including his [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] induction certificate, two jerseys, and two trophies he was given for charity work. Enyart took the items outside the courthouse where the auction was held, burned the certificate and jerseys, and smashed the trophies with a sledgehammer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67474539.html HighBeam]{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/281454.stm|title=OJ memorabilia torched|publisher=BBC News|date=February 18, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''If I Did It''===
{{Main|If I Did It}}
In November 2006, [[ReganBooks]] announced a book ghostwritten by [[Pablo Fenjves]] based on interviews with Simpson titled ''If I Did It'', an account which the publisher said was a hypothetical confession. The book's release was planned to coincide with a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] special featuring Simpson. "This is a historic case, and I consider this his confession", publisher [[Judith Regan]] told the [[Associated Press]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5KT79AKsn?url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/ap/story_pf.asp?ID=1475260 Publisher Calls Book O.J.'s 'Confession'], AP, November 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On November 20, [[News Corporation]], parent company of ReganBooks and Fox, canceled both the book and the TV interview due to a high level of public criticism. CEO [[Rupert Murdoch]], speaking at a press conference, stated: "I and senior management agree with the American public that this was an ill-considered project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6167420.stm |title=Murdoch cancels OJ Simpson plans|publisher= BBC News|date= November 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the Goldman family was awarded rights to the book to partially satisfy the civil judgment against Simpson. The title of the book was changed to ''If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer.'' On the front cover of the book, the title was stylized with the word "If" to appear much smaller than those of "I Did It", and placed inside the "I", so unless looked at very closely, the title of the book reads "I Did It: Confessions of the Killer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=O.J.

On March 11, 2018, Fox broadcast Simpson's previously unaired interview with Regan which was part of the book deal in a special titled ''O.J.

Due to the change in phrasing, these comments were interpreted by many as being a form of [[confession]], which stirred strong reactions in print media and the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = OJ Simpson lost interview | url = https://www.9news.com.au/world/2018/03/12/16/18/oj-simpson-lost-confession-2006-interview-video | publisher = 9News | date = 12 March 2018 | accessdate = March 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Snierson |first1=Dan |title=O.J.

Simpson has participated in two high-profile interviews regarding the case – one in 1996 with [[Ross Becker]], which outlines Simpson's side of the story, as well as a guided tour of his estate, where evidence used in the trial was found. The second took place in 2004, on the ten-year anniversary of the murders, with [[Katie Couric]] for NBC speaking to Simpson. He had worked for that network as a sports commentator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5137198/ns/dateline_nbc-newsmakers/t/oj-simpson-years-later/|title=O.J.

In May 2008, [[Mike Gilbert (sports agent)|Mike Gilbert]], a former agent and friend of Simpson, released his book ''How I Helped O.J. Get Away with Murder'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|1596985518}}&lt;/ref&gt; which details Simpson confessing to the killings to Gilbert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.observer.com/2008/o-j-simpsons-former-agent-publish-book-how-i-helped-o-j-get-away-murder|title=O.

Simpson said, "If she hadn't opened that door with a knife in her hand... she'd still be alive." This, Gilbert said, confirmed his belief that Simpson had confessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0805/12/ng.01.html|title=CNN.com – Transcripts|website=transcripts.cnn.com|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reference"&gt;"[[O.J.: Made in America]]", Episode 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, the LAPD announced a knife had been found in 1998 buried at Simpson's estate, when the buildings were razed. A construction worker had given the knife to a police officer, who, believing the case had been closed, did not submit it as evidence at the time. Forensic tests demonstrated that the knife was not related to the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/35948459 | title=Knife found at OJ Simpson home not a murder weapon | date=April 1, 2016 | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be argued that the presence of Kardashian on Simpson's legal team, combined with the press coverage of the trial, would ultimately be the catalyst for the ongoing popularity of the [[Keeping Up with the Kardashians|Kardashian family]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-oj-simpson-gave-us-the-kardashians&lt;/ref&gt; While Kardashian's ex-wife [[Kris Jenner]] was already married to former [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medalist [[Bruce Jenner]] at the time of the trial, Kardashian's family was mostly out of the public eye before the trial, only becoming famous due to the trial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/television/2016/02/the_relationship_between_oj_simpson_and_the_kardashians_a_history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other theories==
Although no one else was charged, and evidence points to Simpson's guilt, the murders continue to be the subject of research and speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.afrocentricnews.com/html/simpson.html|work=AfroCentric News Features|title=
The O.J. Simpson Affair: More &amp; Better Conspiracy Theories|author=Coleman, A.G. }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Detective [[William Dear (detective)|William Dear]] conducted a lengthy investigation, and his evidence and conclusions, among those of other experts (e.g., Dr. Henry Lee&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;{{cite book|title=O.J.: The Real Untold Story|author=BBC|date=2000|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/954700.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;) who have reviewed the crime, trial, and evidence, were addressed in the [[BBC]] documentary, ''O.J.: The True Untold Story'' (2000). The documentary, produced by Malcolm Brinkworth, claims that the police and prosecution had contaminated or planted evidence pointing to Simpson as the killer, and ignored [[exculpatory evidence]]. Furthermore, it asserts that the state too hastily eliminated other possible suspects, including Simpson's elder son Jason, and individuals linked to the [[illegal drug trade]], in which Brown, Goldman, and Resnick allegedly participated.{{sfn|Dear|2012}}&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=BBC TV|title=''O.J.

Alternative theories of the murders, supposedly shared by Simpson, have suggested they were related to the Los Angeles drug trade,&lt;ref name="Bailey book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bailey|first1=F. Lee|last2=Rabe|first2=Jean|authorlink1=F.

Simpson himself has stated in numerous interviews that he believes the two had been killed over their involvement in drug dealing in the area, and that other murders at the time were carried out for the same reason. Brown, Simpson believed, had been planning to open a restaurant using proceeds from cocaine sales. Mezzaluna Trattoria, where she ate her last meal, and where both Nigg and Goldman had worked, was reportedly a nexus for drug trafficking in Brentwood.&lt;ref name="Bailey book"/&gt;

[[Brett Cantor]], part-owner of the Dragonfly nightclub in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], was found stabbed to death in his nearby home on July 30, 1993;&lt;ref name="Variety obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=A&amp;R exec Cantor slain|url=https://variety.com/1993/biz/news/a-r-exec-cantor-slain-109236/|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=August 3, 1993|accessdate=July 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; no suspects have ever been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McRady|first=Rachel|title=Rose McGowan Tells All in New Memoir 'Brave': 14 Shocking Allegations|url=https://www.etonline.com/rose-mcgowan-tells-all-new-memoir-brave-14-shocking-allegations-95401|newspaper=[[Entertainment Tonight|ET Online]]|date=January 30, 2018|accessdate=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case gained renewed attention a year later when [[O.J. Simpson]]'s defense team successfully petitioned the court trying him for the murders of [[Nicole Brown Simpson]], his ex-wife, and [[Ronald Goldman]], for access to the case file, on the grounds that the way in which all three were stabbed suggested the same killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Noble|first=Kenneth|title=Simpson's Attempt to Bar Evidence Is Turned Down|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/22/us/simpson-s-attempt-to-bar-evidence-is-turned-down.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 22, 1994|accessdate=July 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Goldman had worked for Cantor as a waiter, and Nicole Simpson was a regular at Dragonfly, some books about the case have raised the possibility that the three killings may also have resulted from involvement in drug trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bailey|first1=F.

[[Murder of Michael Nigg|Michael Nigg]], an aspiring actor and waiter at a Los Angeles restaurant, was shot and killed during an attempted robbery on 8 September 1995 while withdrawing money from an ATM.&lt;ref name="Michael Nigg death"&gt;{{cite news|title=Goldman Friend Slain Resisting Robbery|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/438329/GOLDMAN-FRIEND-IS-SLAIN-RESISTING-ROBBERY.html?pg=all|newspaper=[[Associated Press]]|date=September 12, 1995|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three suspects were arrested a month later but released for lack of evidence and the case remains unsolved. Since Nigg was a friend of [[Ronald Goldman]], with whom he had worked, and seemed to live quite well for someone in his position, leading to some reports that he was involved in drug trafficking, his death has been used to support theories that the murders of Goldman and O.J. Simpson's ex-wife Nicole the year before were drug-related as well.

In 2012, several links between the killings and convicted murderer [[Glen Edward Rogers]] were alleged in the documentary film ''[[My Brother the Serial Killer]]'', which was broadcast on [[Investigation Discovery]] (ID). Clay Rogers, Glen's brother, recounts Glen talking about how he had met Brown and was "going to take her down" a few days before the murders happened in 1994. When the murder case was under process, Van Nuys ADA Lea D'Argostino came to know about a written statement from Glen revealing he had met Brown. The information was forwarded to Simpson's prosecutors, but was ignored. Much later, in his years-long correspondence with [[criminal profiler]] Anthony Meolis, Glen also wrote about and created paintings pointing towards his involvement with the murders. During a personal prison meeting between the two, Glen said he was hired by Simpson to break into Brown's house and steal some expensive jewelry, and that Simpson had told him: "you may have to kill the bitch". In a filmed interview, Glen's brother Clay asserts that his brother confessed his involvement.&lt;ref name="ABC News"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Dan|title=Serial Killer Murdered Nicole Brown Simpson, New Documentary Claims|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/serial-killer-oj-simpson-murdered-nicole-brown-simpson/story?id=17765728|accessdate=1 January 2014|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers' family stated that he had informed them that he had been working for Nicole in 1994 and that he had made verbal threats about her to them. Rogers would later speak to a criminal profiler about the Goldman-Simpson murders, providing details about the crime and remarking that he had been hired by O. J. Simpson to steal a pair of earrings and potentially murder Nicole.

"The Shocking Case of O.J. Simpson", released September 29, 2017, was episode 10 of season 2 of [[BuzzFeed]] web series, ''[[BuzzFeed Unsolved]]: and discussed those theories.

===Stephen Singular===

New York Times best selling author and journalist Stephen Singular was approached about the O.J. Simpson murder case a few weeks after the murders from an anonymous source within the [[LAPD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= OJ Simpson: Framed in America

Singular’s source gave him multiple, specific pieces of information regarding the Simpson case. The source told him about an LAPD detective named [[Mark Fuhrman]] and that he had a history of [[racism]], [[antisemitism]], and planting evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= OJ Simpson: Framed in America

Rosa Lopez, a housekeeper for Simpson’s next door neighbor, testified to hearing men’s voices coming from the yard of the Rockingham estate at around midnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= February 27, 1995 OJ trial transcript |location=Los Angeles, California |date= February 27, 1995

The families of Brown and Goldman expressed anger at the premise of ''My Brother the Serial Killer'', with both families dismissing the claims by the Rogers family.&lt;ref name="FN"&gt;{{cite news|title=Families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman enraged by Discovery documentary; O.J.

ID's president, Henry Schlieff, replied that the documentary's intention was not to prove that Rogers had committed the crimes, but to "give viewers new facts and let them make up their own minds," and that he believed that Simpson was guilty of the murders.&lt;ref name="TS"&gt;{{cite web|title=O.J.

===Music===
R&amp;B group [[H-Town (band)|H-Town]] dedicated their album ''[[Ladies Edition, Woman's World]]'' (1997) to Brown, to help victims of [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref name=reza&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/nov/04/local/me-29996|title=The Brown Foundation Cuts Back on Giving|last=Reza|first=H.

Rapper [[Eminem]] referenced the murders in his 1999 song "[[Role Model (song)|Role Model]]", saying, "Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole, When we heard a knock at the door, must have been Ron Gold. Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold, Killed them both and smeared blood in a white Bronco (We Did It)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trshady.com/eminem-songs/8-role-model "Eminem - Role Model"].

The 2002 song "[[Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous (Good Charlotte song)|Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous]]", by American punk-pop band [[Good Charlotte]] includes the lyrics, "You know if you're famous you can kill your wife? There's no such thing as 25 to life, as long as you got the cash to pay for Cochran", in reference to the "Not Guilty" verdict which, many believe, wouldn't have been the case if Simpson hadn't appointed Cochran as his lead attorney.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Rapper [[Jay Z]] also referenced the trial in a song named ''The Story Of O.J'' which revolves around the case and the influence of systematic racism on the trial.

Hip hop artist [[Magneto Dayo]] released a 2013 "[[diss track]]" song titled "OJ Simpson" in which he insults his ex-girlfriend/artist [[V-Nasty]], by referencing the Simpson murder case. The song's lyrics were also added to the ''[[Houston Press]]''{{'}} list of "The 15 Most Messed-Up O.J. Simpson Lyrics".&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Chris (June 13, 2014).

==Exhibits==
The suit Simpson wore when he was acquitted on October 3, 1995 was donated by Simpson's former agent [[Mike Gilbert]] to the [[Newseum]] in 2010. The Newseum has multiple trial related items in their collection, including press passes, newspapers and the mute button that Superior Court Judge [[Lance Ito]] used when he wanted to shut off the live microphone in court so lawyers could talk privately during the trial. The museum's acquisition of the suit ended the legal battle between Gilbert and Fred Goldman, both of whom claimed the right to the clothing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artdaily.com/news/37797/OJ-Simpson-Acquittal-Suit-Arrives-at-Newseum-in-DC-#.WvdND--FN9M]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
His research work is geared towards applications in [[bioscience]]s. Aalen's early work on [[counting process]]es and [[Martingale (probability theory)|martingales]], starting with his 1976 Ph.D. thesis at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], has had profound influence in [[biostatistics]]. Inferences for fundamental quantities associated with cumulative hazard rates, in [[survival analysis]] and models for analysis of event histories, are typically based on the [[Nelson–Aalen estimator]] or appropriate related statistics. The [[Nelson–Aalen estimator]] is related to the [[Kaplan-Meier estimator]] and generalisations thereof.

Aalen is currently the leader of the Centre for Biostatistical Modelling in the Medical Sciences at the Faculty of Medicine at the [[University of Oslo]].

==Honors and awards==
He is an elected member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].

'''Pedro Luis de Borja Lanzol de Romaní''', [[Knights Hospitaller|O.S.Io.Hieros.]] (1472 – 4 October 1511) was a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|Roman Catholic cardinal]] and [[cardinal-nephew]] and papal military leader. He received a wide variety of [[sinecure]]s during the papacy of his great-uncle, [[Pope Alexander VI]], but was exiled to [[Naples]] on the election of Borja rival [[Pope Julius II]].&lt;ref name="moroni"&gt;[[Gaetano Moroni]], ''Dizionario di Erudizione Storico-Ecclesiastica da S. Pietro sino ai nostri giorni'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=ObtDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false vol. 6, p. 50] {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borja also fought with the [[Knights Hospitaller]] in [[Jerusalem]] and [[Rhodes]].
[[File:Cardenal Pedro Luis de Borja.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Portrait of Cardinal Pedro Luis de Borja Lanzol de Romaní]]

==Early life==
He was born in [[Valencia, Spain]], the third of the eight children of [[Jofré de Borja Lanzol de Romaní]] and [[Juana Moncada]] in 1472. In his early military career, he became a [[Knights Hospitaller|Knight of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem]] and [[Knights Hospitaller|Knight of Rhodes]]. When he tried to take Fray [[Francisco de Boxols]]'s post as the priorate of the Order in [[Catalonia]] in 1498, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] ("Fernando the Catholic") through his ambassador in Rome attempted to have Borja's appointment annulled; Borja was instead made [[Prior]] of the Order in [[Santa Eufemia del Arroyo|Santa Eufemia]].&lt;ref name="miranda"&gt;Miranda, Salvador. 1998. "[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1500.htm#Borja Consistory of March 20, 1500 (VIII)]."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cardinal and bishop==
[[Image:VALENCIA ES Cathedral alabaster windows.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Saint Mary of Valencia Cathedral|Cathedral of Valencia]], which Borja never visited during his tenure as [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Valencia in Spain|archbishop of Valencia]], a post held by a Borja since 1429]]
On March 20, 1500, his grand uncle [[Pope Alexander VI]] created him cardinal deacon ''[[in pectore]]''; Borja's cardinalate was published during another consistory on September 28, 1500, and he was formally given the [[Galero|Red Hat]] on October 2, 1500; effective October 5, 1500, his deaconry was [[S. Maria in Via Lata]].&lt;ref name="miranda"/&gt;

While already a cardinal, Borja was elected [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Valencia in Spain|archbishop of Valencia]], a post he would hold until his death, on July 29, 1500, succeeding his brother, Juan. Borja would never visit the [[diocese]] as archbishop; instead he took possession of it through a [[wikt:procurator|procurator]], [[Guillem Ramón de Centelles]], on August 29, 1500. There is no evidence that he was ever consecrated, although he received the post of [[Apostolic Penitentiary|penitentiary major]] on the condition that he receive priestly ordination, which he did in 1502, assuming the post on December 7, 1503; he would remain penitentiary until his death.&lt;ref name="miranda"/&gt; After his ordination, he became cardinal priest [[San Marcello al Corso|S. Marcello]] on December 7, 1503, retaining his deaconry (and its revenues) ''[[in commendam]]''.&lt;ref name="miranda"/&gt;

Through the influence of his grand uncle, Borja also was given the titles of [[Archdiocese of Spoleto-Norcia|Governor of Spoleto]] (August 10, 1500), [[Diocese of Viterbo|Governor of Bagnoregio]], [[Abbot]] ''[[In commendam|commendatario]]'' of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery of [[Valdigna]], and of the Benedictine monastery of [[Basilica of San Simpliciano|S. Simpliciano]] in [[Milan]]. Alexander VI's bull creating the [[University of Valencia]] on January 23, 1501, is attributed to Borja's influence.&lt;ref name="miranda"/&gt;

When Borja reached Rome on June 17, 1501 (through the "[[Piazza del Popolo|Popolo]]" gate), he was received by his brother Rodrigo, the captain of the [[Palatine Guard]].&lt;ref name="miranda"/&gt;

==After the death of Alexander VI==
As a cardinal elector, he participated in the [[papal conclave]]s of September and October 1503. The latter elected [[Pope Julius II]], despite the opposition of Borja, and Julius II proceeded to detain [[Cesare Borgia]], causing Pedro to flee Rome on December 20, 1503, along with Cardinal [[Francisco de Remolins]]. With him he came to [[Naples]].&lt;ref name="miranda"/&gt;

Julius II invited Borja to return to Rome on January 2, 1504, and freed his cousin Cesare from jail so that he could join him in Naples in April. A February 3, 1504, letter from the Spanish monarchs to their ambassador in Rome inquired whether the pope was amenable to Borja and Remolins in Naples, shortly after which rumors of Borja circulated in Spain. He later became the [[archpriest]] of the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome (May 1510). King Fernando wrote again requesting that a successor archbishop be named without his nomination. Upon hearing similarly false news of the death of Julius II, Borja and Remolins together set out for Rome.&lt;ref name="miranda"/&gt;

Borja died on October 4, 1511, by falling from a horse while returning from Rome to Naples. He was buried in the church of [[S. Pier Celestino]] in Rome without a funerary monument.&lt;ref name="moroni"/&gt;&lt;ref name="miranda"/&gt;

'''Platonic love''' (often lower-cased as '''platonic'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Chicago Manual of Style |title-link=The Chicago Manual of Style |edition=16th [electronic] |chapter=8.60: When not to capitalize |date=2010 |publisher=Chicago University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a term used for a type of [[love]], or close relationship that is non-sexual. Its symbol would be the [[rose|white rose]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}. It is named after [[Greek philosopher]] [[Plato]], though the philosopher never used the term himself. Platonic love as devised by Plato concerns rising through levels of closeness to wisdom and true beauty from carnal attraction to individual bodies to attraction to souls, and eventually, union with the truth. This is the ancient, philosophical interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary: Tenth Edition|last=Mish|first=F|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|year=1993|isbn=08-7779-709-9|location=Springfield, MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Platonic love is often contrasted with [[romantic love]].

== Philosophical interpretation ==
Platonic love is examined in Plato's dialogue, the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', which has as its topic the subject of love or [[Eros (concept)|Eros]] generally. It explains the possibilities of how the feeling of love began and how it has evolved—both sexually and non-sexually. Of particular importance is the speech of [[Socrates]], who attributes to the prophetess [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]] an idea of platonic love as a means of ascent to contemplation of the divine. The step of this ascent is known as the "Ladder of Love". For Diotima, and for Plato generally, the most correct use of love of human beings is to direct one's mind to love of [[divinity]]. Socrates defines love based on separate classifications of pregnancy (to bear offspring); pregnancy of the body, pregnancy of the soul, and direct connection to Being. Pregnancy of the body results in human children. Pregnancy of the soul, the next step in the process, produces "[[virtue]]" – which is the soul (truth) translating itself into material form.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Rojcewicz, R. (1997). Platonic love: dasein's urge toward being. ''Research in Phenomenology'', ''27''(1), 103.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] virtue for the Greeks means self-sameness [...] in Plato's terms, Being or idea."(106) &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Eros ===
In short, with genuine platonic love, the beautiful or lovely other person inspires the mind and the soul and directs one's attention to spiritual things. Pausanias, in Plato's ''Symposium'' (181b–182a), explained two types of love or Eros—Vulgar Eros or earthly love and Divine Eros or [[divine love]]. Vulgar Eros is nothing but mere material attraction towards a beautiful body for physical pleasure and reproduction. Divine Eros begins the journey from physical attraction, i.e. attraction towards beautiful form or body but transcends gradually to love for Supreme Beauty. This concept of Divine Eros is later transformed into the term platonic love. Vulgar Eros and Divine Eros are both connected and part of the same continuous process of pursuing totality of being itself,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; with the purpose of mending human nature, eventually reaching a point of unity where there is no longer an aspiration to change.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"Eros is [...] a moment of transcendence [...] in so far as the other can never be possessed without being annihilated in its status as the other, at which point both desire and transcendence would cease [...] (84) &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Miller, P. A. (2013). Duras and platonic love: The erotics of substitution. ''Comparatist'', ''37''83-104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Eros as a god ====
In the ''Symposium'', Eros is discussed as a Greek god – more specifically, the king of the gods, with each guest of the party giving a eulogy in praise of Eros.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Benardete, S. (1986). ''Plato's Symposium.'' Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-04275-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This view of Eros is different from how a modern person would interpret it. Most modern people would think of Eros as a concept rather than a god. This is an example of [[Cultural relativism|cultural relativity]], because the modern interpretation of the term is different from the ancient Greek interpretation.&lt;blockquote&gt;"So this is how I assert that Eros is the oldest, most honorable, and most competent of the gods with regard to the acquisition of virtue and happiness by human beings both when living and dead."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (180c, 8) – Plato's quoting of Phaedrus' eulogy on Eros &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Virtue ====
Virtue, according to Greek philosophy, is the concept of how closely reality and material form equates with the ideal, true essence of an idea, such as beauty. Virtue is the result of pregnancy of the soul.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This definition varies considerably from the modern English interpretation of the term, where virtue equates to that which is good, positive, or benevolent. This can be seen as a form of [[linguistic relativity]].

Some modern authors perception of the terms "virtue" and "good" as they are translated into English from the ''Symposium'' are a good indicator of this misunderstanding. In the following quote, the author simplifies the idea of virtue as simply what is "good".&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] what is good is beautiful, and what is beautiful is good [...]"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Herrmann, F. (2013). Dynamics of vision in Plato's thought. ''Helios'', ''40''(1/2), 281-307.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Ladder of Love ===
The Ladder of Love is named as such because it relates each step toward Being itself as consecutive rungs of a ladder. Each step closer to the truth further distances love from beauty of the body toward love that is more focused on wisdom and the essence of beauty.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The ladder starts with carnal attraction of body for body, progressing to a love for body and soul. Eventually, in time, with consequent steps up the ladder, the idea of beauty is eventually no longer connected with a body, but entirely united with Being itself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] decent human beings must be gratified, as well as those that are not as yet decent, so that they might become more decent; and the love of the decent must be preserved." &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (187d, 17) - Eryximachus' "completion" of Pausanias' speech on Eros &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Tragedy and comedy ====
Plato's ''Symposium'' defines two extremes in the process of platonic love; the entirely carnal and the entirely ethereal. These two extremes of love are seen by the Greeks in terms of tragedy and comedy. According to Diotima in her discussion with Socrates, for anyone to achieve the final rung in the Ladder of Love, they would essentially transcend the body and rise to immortality - gaining direct access to Being. Such a form of love is impossible for a mortal to achieve.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

What Plato describes as "pregnancy of the body" is entirely carnal and seeks pleasure and beauty in bodily form only. This is the type of love, that, according to Socrates, is practiced by animals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Now, if both these portraits of love, the tragic and the comic, are exaggerations, then we could say that the genuine portrayal of Platonic love is the one that lies between them. The love described as the one practiced by those who are pregnant according to the soul, who partake of both the realm of beings and the realm of Being, who grasp Being indirectly, through the mediation of beings, would be a love that Socrates could practice."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===== Tragedy =====

Diotima considers the carnal limitation of human beings to the pregnancy of the body to be a form of tragedy, as it separates someone from the pursuit of truth. One would be forever limited to beauty of the body, never being able to access the true essence of beauty.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===== Comedy =====
Diotima considers the idea of a mortal having direct access to Being to be a comic situation simply because of the impossibility of it. The offspring of true virtue would essentially lead to a mortal achieving immortality.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Evolution of platonic love ==
In the Middle Ages arose a new interest in Plato, his philosophy and his view of love. This was caused by [[Georgios Gemistos Plethon]] during the Councils of Ferrara and Firenze in 1438-1439. Later in 1469, [[Marsilio Ficino]] put forward a theory of neo-platonic love in which he defines love as a personal ability of an individual which guides their soul towards cosmic processes and lofty spiritual goals and heavenly ideas (''De Amore'', Les Belles Lettres, 2012). The first use of the modern sense of platonic love is taken as an invention of Ficino in one of his letters.

Though Plato's discussions of love originally centered on relationships which were sexual between members of the same sex, scholar Todd Reeser studies how the meaning of platonic love in Plato's original sense underwent a transformation during the [[Renaissance]], leading to the contemporary sense of nonsexual [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reeser|first1=T.|title=Setting Plato Straight: Translating Platonic Sexuality in the Renaissance|date=2015|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English term dates back to [[William Davenant]]'s ''The Platonic Lovers'' (performed in 1635); a critique of the philosophy of platonic love which was popular at Charles I's court. It is derived from the concept in Plato's ''Symposium'' of the love of the idea of good which lies at the root of all virtue and truth. For a brief period, Platonic love was a fashionable subject at the English royal court, especially in the circle around Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], the wife of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. Platonic love was the theme of some of the courtly [[masque]]s performed in the [[Caroline era]]—though the fashion soon waned under pressures of social and political change.

=== Seven types of love ===
Throughout these eras platonic love slowly was categorized into different subsections, which were: [[Eros]], [[Philia]], [[Storge]], [[Agape]], [[Ludus (ancient Rome)|Ludus]], [[Pragma (love)|Pragma]], [[Self-love|Philautia]]. Eros is a sexual or passionate love, or a modern perspective of romantic love. Philia is the type of love that is directed towards friendship or goodwill, often is met with mutual benefits that can also can be formed by companionship, dependability, and trust. Storge is the type of love that is found between parents and children, and this is often a unilateral love. Agape is the universal love, that can consist of the love for strangers, nature, or god. Ludus is a playful and uncommitted love, this is focused for fun and sometimes as a conquest with no strings attached. Pragma is the type of love that is founded on duty and reason, and one's longer term interests. Philautia is self-love and this can be healthy or unhealthy; which can be unhealthy if you are hubris if placed ahead of gods, and it can be healthy if its used to build self esteem and confidence. These different forms of love can be mistaken as any of the listed different loves.  There is a type of porosity that allows love to filter through one type and into the next, although for Plato love is to be of the beautiful and good things. This is due to the ownership of beautiful and good things equates into happiness. All beautiful and good things sit below truth and wisdom, for everyone looks to truthful and wise people as the truly beautiful for the effort of being considered beautifully good, and this is exactly why Plato suggests that love is not a god but rather a philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hide-and-seek/201606/these-are-the-7-types-love|title=These Are the 7 Types of Love|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern interpretation ==

=== Definition of platonic love ===
"Platonic love in its modern popular sense is an affectionate relationship into which the sexual element does not enter, especially in cases where one might easily assume otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/platonic_love.htm|title=Platonic love|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Platonic lovers function to underscore a supportive role where the friend sees her or his duty as the provision of advice, encouragement, and comfort to the other person [...] and do not entail exclusivity"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Messman,|first=SJ|date=2000|title=Motives to Remain Platonic, Equity, and the Use of Maintenance Strategies in Opposite-Sex Friendships|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0265407500171004|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships,|volume=17|pages=67–94|via=10.1177/0265407500171004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Complications of platonic love ===
90% of our closest relationship will be of a platonic nature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/love-isnt-just-romantic|title=The Truth About Romantic and Platonic Love|date=2015-12-14|work=The Odyssey Online|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; but when there is an insistence on labelling the relationship as platonic love the terminology itself may create discourse within one's relationships. Notably romantic relationships where a bond of love has been established.

One of the complications of platonic love lies within the persistence of the use of the title itself "platonic love" versus the use of "friend". It is the use of the word [[love]] that directs us towards a deeper relationship than the scope of a normal [[friendship]].

Secondly, a study by Hause and Messman states: "The most popular reasons for retaining a platonic relationship of the opposite sex (or sex of attraction) was to safeguard a relationship, followed by not attracted, network disapproval, third party, risk aversion, and time out." This points to the fact that the title of platonic love in most cases is actually a title-holder to avoid sexual interaction between knowing and consenting friends, with mutual or singular sexual interest and/or tension existing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20634">'''Poisoned candy myths''' are [[urban legend]]s about malevolent strangers hiding [[poison]]s or sharp objects such as [[razor]] [[blade]]s, [[Sewing needle|needles]], or broken [[glass]] in [[candy]] and distributing the candy in order to harm random children, especially during [[Halloween]] [[trick-or-treating]].  These stories serve as modern [[cautionary tale]]s to children and parents.  These stories repeat two themes that are common in urban legends:  danger to children and contamination of food.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

No cases of strangers killing or permanently injuring children this way have been proven. Commonly, the story appears in the media when a young child dies suddenly after Halloween.  Medical investigations into the actual [[cause of death]] have always shown that these children did not die from eating candy given to them by strangers.  However, in rare cases, adult family members have spread this story in an effort to cover up [[murder]] or [[Accidental death|accidental deaths]].  In other incidents, a child who has been told about poisoned candy places a dangerous object or substance in a pile of candy and pretends that it was the work of a stranger.  This behavior is called the ''[[copycat crime|copycat effect]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[Folkloristics|Folklorists]], scholars, and [[law enforcement]] experts say that these stories have been "thoroughly debunked".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9xOb-19lXx8C|title=Encyclopedia of Urban Legends|last=Brunvand|first=Jan Harold|date=2012-01-01|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598847208|page=288|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have, however, been confirmed cases of [[heroin]] (2017) and razor blades (2015) being discovered in the Halloween candy of children, though no deaths resulted from these.&lt;ref name="NYP2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2017/11/01/mom-finds-heroin-in-kids-halloween-candy/|title=Mom finds heroin in kid’s Halloween candy|date=1 November 2017|publisher=[[New York Post]]|language=English|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowerman2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/10/30/police-razor-blade-found-halloween-candy-ohio/74858078/|title=Police: Razor blade found in Halloween candy in Ohio|last=Bowerman|first=Mary|date=30 October 2015|publisher=[[USA Today]]|language=English|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Caution due to tampered candy has led to the rise of alternative events to trick-or-treating, such as trunk-or-treat events held at Christian churches, police and fire stations, community centers, and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-halloween-safety-20151030-story.html|title=For better and worse, Halloween activities reflect grown-up fears|last=Pitts|first=Jonathan M.|date=30 October 2015|publisher=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|language=English|accessdate=26 October 2018|quote=Police departments issue safety tips.

It has gained popularity as an alternative to letting children walk neighborhoods at night.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharos2017"/&gt;

== History ==
Claims that candy was poisoned or adulterated gained general credence during the [[Industrial Revolution]], when food production moved out of the home or local area, where it was made in familiar ways by known and trusted people, to strangers using unknown ingredients and unfamiliar machines and processes.&lt;ref name="Kawash13"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kawash|first1=Samira|title=Candy: A Century of Panic and Pleasure|date=2013|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber, Incorporated|location=New York|isbn=9780865477568|pages=27–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some doctors publicly claimed that they were treating children poisoned by candy every day.  If a child became ill, and had eaten candy, the candy was widely assumed to be the cause.  However, no cases of illness or death were ever substantiated.

In the 1890s and 1900s, tests by the US Bureau of Chemistry and other state agencies on hundreds of kinds of candy found no evidence of poisons or adulteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kawash|first1=Samira|title=Candy: A Century of Panic and Pleasure|date=2013|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber, Incorporated|location=New York|isbn=9780865477568|pages=64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These tests revealed that inexpensive [[glucose]] (from [[corn syrup]]) was in common use for cheap candies, that some candies contained trace amounts of copper from uncoated copper cooking pans, and that [[coal tar dye]]s were being used for coloring, but there was no evidence of the many types of poison, industrial waste, garbage, or other adulterants alleged to be present.  Eventually, the claims that children were being sickened by candy were put down to [[indigestion]] due to overeating, or to other causes, including [[food poisoning]] due to improper cooking, hygiene, or storage of meat and other foods.&lt;ref name="Kawash13" /&gt;

=== Social causes ===
The prevalence and persistence of these myths during the 1960s and 1970s, a time of social upheaval, greater racial integration, and improved status for women, reflected societal questions about who was trustworthy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Because society was struggling with questions about whether to trust neighbors in newly integrated neighborhoods, or young women who were publicly rejecting the subservient, motherhood-focused roles previously assigned to women, these stories about unidentifiable neighbors allegedly harming random, innocent children during an event intended to bring happiness to these children caught and retained the public imagination in a way that accurate stories about a judgmental neighbor, an abusive parent, or an adult carelessly leaving harmful chemicals where children can reach them, wouldn't have.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Effects ===
[[File:Halloween Trunk-or-Treat.jpg|thumb|An [[trunk (automobile)|automobile trunk]] at a trunk-or-treat event at St. John Lutheran Church and Early Learning Center in [[Darien, Illinois]]]]
Due to their fears, parents and communities restricted trick-or-treating and developed alternative "safe" events, such as trunk-or-treat events held at Christian churches.&lt;ref name="Sharos2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/aurora-beacon-news/news/ct-abn-aurora-halloween-st-1030-20171029-story.html|title=Trunk or Treat event offers safe alternative for Aurora-area residents|last=Sharos|first=David|date=29 October 2017|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|language=English|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This story also promoted the sale of individually wrapped, brand-name candies and discouraged people from giving homemade treats to children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Candy-tampering myth ==
=== Development of the modern candy-tampering myth ===
Several events in the late 20th century fostered the modern-day candy tampering myth.

In 1959, a California dentist, William Shyne, gave candy-coated [[laxative|laxative pills]] to trick-or-treaters.  He was charged with outrage of public decency and unlawful dispensing of drugs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Kawash|first1 = Samira|title = Candy: A Century of Panic and Pleasure|date = 2013|publisher = Faber &amp; Faber, Incorporated|location = New York|isbn = 9780865477568|pages = 272–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, an annoyed [[Long Island, New York]] woman gave out packages of inedible objects to children who she believed were too old to be trick-or-treating. The packages contained items such as [[steel wool]], [[dog biscuit]]s, and [[ant]] buttons (which were clearly labeled with the word "poison"). Though nobody was injured, she was prosecuted and pleaded guilty to endangering children. The same year saw media reports of [[lye]]-filled bubble gum being handed out in [[Detroit]] and [[rat poison]] being given in [[Philadelphia]], although these media reports were never substantiated to be actual events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deadly 'Tricks' Given Children in 3 States|agency=United Press International|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=November 2, 1964|page=A18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable milestone in the spread of the candy tampering myths was an article published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1970. This article claimed that "Those Halloween goodies that children collect this weekend on their rounds of ‘trick or treating’ may bring them more horror than happiness", and provided specific examples of potential tamperings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Those Treats May Be Tricks|first=Judy|last=Klemesrud|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 28, 1970|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports and copycat incidents peaked shortly after the [[Chicago Tylenol murders]], which were first reported one month before Halloween in 1982.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This incident involved a murderer who added poison to a few bottles of [[over-the-counter medication]] after the medication had been delivered to stores.

=== Debunking the myths ===
[[Joel Best]], a [[sociologist]] at the [[University of Delaware]], specializes in the scholarly study of candy-tampering legends. He collected newspaper reports from 1958 to 1983 in search of evidence of candy tampering.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Best|first=Joel|title=Threatened Children: Rhetoric and Concern about Child-victims|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226044262|url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=wikipedia&amp;q=isbn%3A0226044262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fewer than 90 instances might have qualified as actual candy tampering. In none of the cases does he attribute the events to "random attempts to harm children" at the Halloween holiday.  Instead, most cases were attempts by adults to gain financial compensation or, far more commonly, by children to get attention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adams12"&gt;Adams, Guy (2012). "The Halloween poisoner has US in his grip: A new study casts doubt on an urban legend, but the myth of the deadly candy refuses to die," ''Independent'' (online, October 27), see [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-halloween-poisoner-has-us-in-his-grip-8229390.html], accessed 13 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Best found five child deaths that were initially thought by local authorities to be caused by homicidal strangers, but none of those were sustained by investigation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Best|first=Joel|author2=Gerald T. Horiuchi|title=The Razor Blade in the Apple: The Social Construction of Urban Legends|journal=Social Problems|year=1985|volume=32|issue=5|pages=488–99|doi=10.2307/800777|jstor=800777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fabrications by children are particularly common.  Children sometimes [[copycat crime|copy or act out]] the stories about tampered candy that they overhear, by adding [[Pin|pins]] to or pouring household cleaners on their own candy and then reporting the now-unsafe candy to their parents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In these incidents, the children have not been harmed; they know that the dangerous item is present and that it would be unsafe to eat the candy.

Far more prevalent during the same period were reports of vandalism, racist incidents, or children being injured in [[Vehicle collisions|pedestrian–vehicle collisions]] on Halloween.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Misattributed poisoning deaths ===
The deaths of five children were initially blamed on stranger poisoning.  However, none of these claims were sustained upon investigation.
* In 1970, Kevin Toston, a 5-year-old boy from the [[Detroit]] area, found and ate [[heroin]] his uncle had stashed. The boy died following a four-day [[coma]]. The family attempted to protect the uncle by claiming the drug had been sprinkled in the child's Halloween candy.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Aaron &amp; Rachel Vreeman (2009). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=QWkiGcX0E0kC&amp;dq=Detroit+heroin+Halloween+1970&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Don't Swallow Your Gum!: Myths, Half-Truths, and Outright Lies about Your Body and Health]''. Macmillan. p. 146. {{ISBN|978-0-312-53387-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1978, Patrick Wiederhold, a two-year-old boy from'' ''Flint, Michigan died after eating Halloween candy.  However, toxicology tests found no evidence of poison and the death was determined to be due to [[natural causes]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|title = Halloween Sadism: The Evidence|url = http://www.udel.edu/soc/faculty/best/site/halloween.html#article|website = University of Delaware Faculty Pages|accessdate = October 27, 2014|last = Best|first = Joel}} Revised 2008 and 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In 1990, Ariel Katz, a seven-year-old girl in Santa Monica, California, died while trick-or-treating.  Early press reports blamed poisoned candy, despite her parents telling the police that she had previously been diagnosed with a serious medical condition, an [[enlarged heart]], which was the actual cause of death.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 
* In 2001, a four-year-old girl in Vancouver, British Columbia died after eating some Halloween candy.  However, there was no evidence of poisoned candy, and she actually died of a streptococcus infection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In a 1974 case, an 8-year-old boy from [[Deer Park, Texas]], died after eating a [[cyanide]]-laced package of [[Pixy Stix]]. A subsequent police investigation eventually determined that the poisoned candy had been planted in his trick-or-treat pile by the boy's father, [[Ronald Clark O'Bryan]], who also gave out poisoned candy to other children in an attempt to cover up the murder, though no other children consumed the poisoned treats. The murderer, who had wanted to claim [[life insurance]] money, was executed in 1984.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this case, the distribution of poisoned candy is true, but no children other than the intended victim were harmed.

=== Media and the myth ===
Despite these claims of poisoned candy being eventually proved false, the [[news media]] promoted the story continuously throughout the 1980s, with local news stations featuring frequent coverage. During this time cases of poisoning were repeatedly reported based on unsubstantiated claims or before a full investigation could be completed and often never followed up on. This one-sided coverage contributed to the overall panic and caused rival media outlets to issue reports of candy tampering as well.  However, Joel Best says that the spread of the myth cannot be blamed solely on the media, and that it must have been transmitted via [[word of mouth]] as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By 1985, the media had driven the hysteria about candy poisonings to such a point that an [[ABC News]]/''[[Washington Post]]'' poll that found 60% of parents feared that their children would be injured or killed because of Halloween candy sabotage.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Advice columnists entered the fray during the 1980s and 1990s with both ''[[Ask Ann Landers]]'' and ''[[Dear Abby]]'' warning parents of the horrors of candy tampering:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In recent years, there have been reports of people with twisted minds putting razor blades and poison in taffy apples and Halloween candy. It is no longer safe to let your child eat treats that come from strangers." –Ann Landers in 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Landers, Ann |date=October 31, 1995|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=896&amp;dat=19951031&amp;id=8CUOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=k30DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6927,4432593 |title=Twisted Minds Make Halloween a Dangerous Time|work=The Sunday Courier|page= 7B|accessdate= November 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Somebody's child will become violently ill or die after eating poisoned candy or an apple containing a razor blade." –Dear Abby in 1983&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Van Buren, Abigail |date=October 31, 1983|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&amp;dat=19831031&amp;id=CdYTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rQYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6759,4949772 |title=A Night of Treats, Not Tricks|work=[[The Gainesville Sun]]|page= 13A|accessdate= November 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This collective fear also served as the impetus for the "safe" trick-or-treating offered by many local [[Shopping mall|malls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/29/business/yourmoney/29treat.html |title=This Halloween, Superheroes Will Head to the Mall |work=New York Times |author=Bick, Julie|date=October 20, 2006 |accessdate=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genuine candy tampering cases ==
In 2000, James Joseph Smith of [[Minneapolis]] placed sharp needles within [[Snicker]]'s bars that he distributed to children on All Hallow's Eve.&lt;ref name="Trex2014"/&gt; While several children bit into the bars, only one was injured.&lt;ref name="Trex2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/12914/brief-history-sick-people-tampering-halloween-candy|title=A Brief History of Sick People Tampering With Halloween Candy|last=Trex|first=Ethan|date=23 October 2014|publisher=[[Mental Floss]]|language=English|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a razor blade was discovered in a [[Snicker]]'s bar after children went trick-or-treating in [[Reynoldsburg, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="Bowerman2015"/&gt;

Prior to Halloween in 2017, North Carolina's Alcohol Law Enforcement (ALE) agency issued a warning about cannabidiol candy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/31/halloween-myths-and-urban-legends-that-just-wont-die|title=Drugs or poison in the sweets?

During Allhallowtide 2017, the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' reported that an eleven-year-old girl had to undergo surgery to remove a metal piece that she had swallowed from eating a contaminated Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup.&lt;ref name="Star2017"/&gt; Local police also reported the discoverance of needles in Halloween candy from [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], and [[Chatham, Ontario|Catham]].&lt;ref name="Star2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/11/03/ontario-girl-11-hospitalized-after-eating-halloween-candy-that-contained-metal-object.html|title=Ontario girl, 11, hospitalized after eating Halloween candy that contained metal object|date=3 November 2017|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|language=English|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, police believed that [[heroin]] found in a young girl's Halloween candy originated in the [[Hidden Valley, West Virginia|Hidden Valley]] area.&lt;ref name="NYP2017"/&gt;

The field that studies synthetic genomes is called [[Synthetic genomics|Synthetic Genomics]].{{Orphan|date=December 2015}}

== Recombinant DNA Technology ==
Soon after the discovery of [[Restriction enzyme|restriction endonucleases]] and [[ligase]]s, the field of genetics began using these molecular tools to assemble artificial sequences from smaller fragments of synthetic or naturally occurring [[DNA]]. The advantage in using the recombinatory approach as opposed to continual [[DNA synthesis]] stems from the inverse relationship that exists between synthetic DNA length and percent purity of that synthetic length. In other words, as you synthesize longer sequences, the number of error-containing clones increases due to the inherent error rates of current technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Synthetic genomics: potential and limitations|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0958166912000298|journal = Current Opinion in Biotechnology|pages = 659–665|volume = 23|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.copbio.2012.01.014|first = Michael G|last = Montague|first2 = Carole|last2 = Lartigue|first3 = Sanjay|last3 = Vashee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[recombinant DNA]] technology is more commonly used in the construction of [[fusion proteins]] and [[plasmid]]s, several techniques with larger capacities have emerged, allowing for the construction of entire genomes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Synthetic Biology, Part B: Computer Aided Design and DNA Assembly; Chapter Fifteen - Enzymatic Assembly of Overlapping DNA Fragments|last = Gibson|first = Daniel|publisher = Academic Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-12-385120-8|pages = 349–361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polymerase Cycling Assembly ===
[[File:PCA illustrated by Nivin Nasri (edited).png|thumb|Polymerase Cycling Assembly. Blue arrows represent oligonucleotides 40 to 60 bp with overlapping regions of about 20 bp. The cycle is repeated until the final genome is constructed.]]
[[Polymerase cycling assembly]] (PCA) uses a series of oligonucleotides (or oligos), approximately 40 to 60 nucleotides long, that altogether constitute both strands of the DNA being synthesized. These oligos are designed such that a single oligo from one strand contains a length of approximately 20 nucleotides at each end that is complementary to sequences of two different oligos on the opposite strand, thereby creating regions of overlap. The entire set is processed through cycles of: (a) [[Hybridization (biology)|hybridization]] at 60&amp;nbsp;°C; (b) elongation via [[Taq polymerase]] and a standard ligase; and (c) denaturation at 95&amp;nbsp;°C, forming progressively longer contiguous strands and ultimately resulting in the final genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Single-step assembly of a gene and entire plasmid from large numbers of oligodeoxyribonucleotides|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378111995005114|journal = Gene|date = 1995-10-16|pages = 49–53|volume = 164|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/0378-1119(95)00511-4|first = Willem P.

=== Gibson Assembly Method ===
[[File:GAM illustrated by Nivin Nasri.png|thumb|Gibson Assembly Method. The blue arrows represent DNA cassettes, which could be any size, 6 kb each for example. The orange segments represent areas of identical DNA sequences. This process can be carried out with multiple initial cassettes.]]
The [[Gibson assembly|Gibson Assembly Method]], designed by Daniel Gibson during his time at the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]], requires a set of double-stranded DNA cassettes that constitute the entire genome being synthesized. Note that cassettes differ from contigs by definition, in that these sequences contain regions of homology to other cassettes for the purposes of [[Homologous recombination|recombination]]. In contrast to Polymerase Cycling Assembly, Gibson Assembly is a single-step, isothermal reaction with larger sequence-length capacity; ergo, it is used in place of Polymerase Cycling Assembly for genomes larger than 6 kb.

A T5 [[exonuclease]] performs a chew-back reaction at the terminal segments, working in the 5' to 3' direction, thereby producing complimentary overhangs. The overhangs hybridize to each other, a Phusion [[DNA polymerase]] fills in any missing nucleotides and the nicks are sealed with a ligase. However, the genomes capable of being synthesized using this method alone is limited because as DNA cassettes increase in length, they require propagation in vitro in order to continue hybridizing; accordingly, Gibson assembly is often used in conjunction with Transformation-Associated Recombination (see below) to synthesize genomes several hundred kilobases in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Enzymatic assembly of DNA molecules up to several hundred kilobases|url = http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nmeth.1318|journal = Nature Methods|pages = 343–345|volume = 6|issue = 5|doi = 10.1038/nmeth.1318|first = Daniel G|last = Gibson|first2 = Lei|last2 = Young|first3 = Ray-Yuan|last3 = Chuang|first4 = J Craig|last4 = Venter|first5 = Clyde A|last5 = Hutchison|first6 = Hamilton O|last6 = Smith|date = 2009-04-12|pmid=19363495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transformation-Associated Recombination ===
[[File:GRC illustrated by Nivin Nasri.png|thumb|Gap Repair Cloning. The blue arrows represent DNA contigs. Segments of the same colour represent complimentary or identical sequences. Specialized primers with extensions are used in a polymerase chain reaction to generate regions of homology at the terminal ends of the DNA contigs.]]
The goal of Transformation-Associated Recombination (TAR) technology in synthetic genomics is to combine DNA contigs by means of [[homologous recombination]] performed by the [[Yeast artificial chromosome|Yeast Artificial Chromosome]] (YAC). Of importance is the CEN element within the YAC [[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]], which corresponds to the yeast centromere. This sequence gives the vector the ability to behave in a chromosomal manner, thereby allowing it to perform [[Homologous recombination|homologous recombination.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Exploiting the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the study of the organization and evolution of complex genomes|url = http://femsre.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/5/629|journal = FEMS Microbiology Reviews|date = 2003-12-01|issn = 1574-6976|pmid = 14638416|pages = 629–649|volume = 27|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/S0168-6445(03)00070-6|first = Natalay|last = Kouprina|first2 = Vladimir|last2 = Larionov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
;Tamagotchi!
Following the events of [[Tamagotchi: Happiest Story in the Universe!]], Mametchi, Memetchi, Kuchipatchi, and all other Tamagotchi Planet residents move on with their daily lives. However, a very famous Tamagotchi idol named Lovelin moves to Tamagotchi Town to host a footrace. The following day, at school, a shy, yet sweet new girl named Lovelitchi came to class. Little were her classmates aware that she was actually Lovelin. Poor experiences in prior schools caused Lovelitchi to decide to keep her Lovelin identity a secret when transferring to Tamagotchi School. After Mametchi told Lovelitchi he sees her as a Tama-Friend, she soon gets nervous due to the fact that Tama-Friends are never dishonest with each other. On Mametchi's birthday, Lovelitchi announced that she was, indeed, Lovelin. She feared that her newly-made friendships would come to an end, but everyone was quick to forgive her, and she was relieved. Daily life continued from that point until a legend about "The Kuchipatchi of Truth" was learned about by Mametchi, Memetchi, and Kuchipatchi. It caused a variety of shenanigans, included being teleported back in time and Lovelitchi's cell phone, Telelin, coming to life. Not long after the legend of The Kuchipatchi of Truth was discovered, an outgoing violinist named Melodytchi moves to Tamagotchi Town. Lovelitchi quickly became friends with her and they became an idol and violinist duet, performing many songs together. Not too long afterward, a bright and optimistic fashion designer named Moriritchi moves in and quickly became Tama-Friends with the cast, especially Lovelitchi and Melodytchi. Shortly after, a human girl named Tomomi arrives on Tamagotchi Planet following a malfunction from one of Mametchi's inventions. At that time, a new conflict unfolds; the legend of the Tama-Hearts. These mythical hearts were floating about on Tamagotchi Planet, and if they weren't found in time, Tamagotchi Planet would face a permanent curse. Mametchi created Tama-Profies, devices that could store the Tama-Hearts shortly after they were uncovered, and gave them to Lovelitchi and Melodytchi. Every time a Tama-Heart was found, Lovelitchi and Melodytchi would take out their Tama-Profies and store the Tama-Heart inside. At one time around that time, a mysterious Tamagotchi named Kizunatchi got out of the devices and offered to help with the search. Not long after, Tomomi leaves to return to the Earth and a new Tamagotchi girl with a massive crush on Mametchi, Himespetchi, arrives and agrees to help with the search. With all the Tama-Hearts eventually found and stored in the Tama-Profies, citizens of Tamagotchi Town were soon turning into eggs. This was the beginning for what may be a permanent curse in Tamagotchi Planet, and if the Tama-Hearts weren't returned to their respective pillars on Heart Island in time, a rather unhappy ending is rest assured. Luckily, The Tamagotchis make it to Heart Island just before the curse gets any worse and manage to store the Tama-Hearts in their proper pillars. The sky then darkens, making them think something awful is bound to happen. Mametchi, Lovelitchi, Melodytchi, Memetchi, Kuchipatchi, and Himespetchi each made their hopes on the Tamagotchi Planet being Okay and the Egg curse to being stopped. Kizunatchi, only able to do so much to stop the curse, descended in a manner that saddened her Tama-Friends and made them run towards her, screaming her name. Kizunatchi soon changed appearance and ended the egg curse once and for all. Everyone was turned back to their regular selves and, after a tearful farewell to Kizunatchi, everything went back to normal. Ms. Perfect called Mametchi, Memetchi, and Kuchipatchi, and announced that the three Tamagotchis have won the Robotic Soccer Tournament and that they would be transferring to Dream Town in light of their Victory. The entire class was surprised, especially Mametchi, Memetchi, and Kuchipatchi. Makiko remarked that the three will need to leave Tamagotchi Town, making Himespetchi tear up in the thought that her love was leaving.

;Tamagotchi! Yume Kira Dream
Following Ms. Perfect's announcement, Mametchi, Memetchi, and Kuchipatchi take to Dream Town by plane. Each of them were given Home-Stay residences by the Principle of Dream School. Kuchipatchi's was a fancy restaurant named Dream Hakken, and Memetchi's was a beautiful salon called Salon de Dream. While this seemed like paradise for Kuchipatchi, Memetchi, and Mametchi's home stay wasn't quite the same way. He did a homestay in a garage with an elder Tamagotchi named Ikaritchi, who didn't think very fond of him. Meanwhile, shifting to another story, Yumemitchi, the sweet daughter of a wealthy Tamagotchi family, meets up with her best Tama-Friend, Kiraritchi. The girls achieve so much more together than either one could on their own, and they share a dream; to become famous idols, which was inspired by a duet called D2. Yumemitchi and Kiraritchi see D2 as role models, and after dancing and singing to help get a lion's thorn out of its paw at a circus, a fortune-telling Tamagotchi gives them mythical bags called Yume Kira Bags, which must be used with careful consideration and much be kept secret from other Tamagotchis. Not long afterward, a surprise awaits Mametchi and friends; Himespetchi returns to reunite with her crush and to fulfill her dream of being Mametchi's bride. The Yume Kira Bags cause Yumemitchi and Kiraritchi to undergo disguise and assist other Tamagotchis with tight situations. One Christmas in Dream Town, a Tamagotchi named Yumecantchi emerges from the bags to help the two after Yumemitchi wished for a Tama-Pet of her own. While Yumemitchi admires her cute charms, Kiraritchi thinks it's an overreaction. Not long after, Mametchi refused to take any more of Ikaritchi's mistreatment for him and ran away, trying to find a new homestay. The next day, a friendly pianist named Pianitchi came to Dream Town to reunite with her mother, Cafe Mama, who runs Music Cafe. She befriended Mametchi and helped him change Ikaritchi's ways. After Ikaritchi was reminded about a childhood memory picking apples with a friend, he finally displays his courteous side to Mametchi, and parted Dream Town to sell the apples. Mametchi has since done a homestay at Music Cafe with Pianitchi. Yumemitchi, Kiraritchi, Memetchi, Pianitchi, and Himespetchi soon formed a band called the Kira Kira Girls. After an important performance, Dream Town learned that Himespetchi had to leave under her parents' request. After a tearful farewell, a talkative make-up artist named Coffretchi moved in and agreed to take Himespetchi's place in the Kira Kira Girls' band. Later on, after Yumemitchi and Kiraritchi make frequent use of the Yume Kira Bag, a Tamagotchi named Nandetchi notices the true identities and decided to take photos of them and show them to Dream School, much to the girls' humiliation. After reconsolidation, Nandetchi tore up the photos. Yumemitchi and Kiraritchi then learned it was time to return the Yume Kira Bags and Yumecantchi back to the fortune teller that gave them the items. Not long afterward, Yumemitchi and Kiraritchi then leave Dream Town and go to Melody Town to study idolism and make their dream come true.

;Tamagotchi! Miracle Friends
Sometime after Yumemitchi and Kiraritchi pursuit their dream at a new destination, a new story is to be told, and this one is about time. Two Twin sisters were Home sweet Home in Dream Town of the Future. Miraitchi, the one-day older twin, is a little more sarcastic, which Clulutchi, the one-day younger twin, is a little more serious. One day, a mysterious face that calls himself X-Kamen lets loose eight mythical Tama-Pets called Dreambakutchis. The father of the twins, Doctor Future, orders them to go retrieve the Dreambakutchis. Miraitchi and Clulutchi use pocket designers, devices that provide outfits necessary for fulfilling tasks and assignments, to give Miraitchi wings and Clulutchi a hoverboard. While Miraitchi enjoyed flying, Clulutchi feared it. Despite different receptions on taking to the skies, the twins retrieve most of the Dreambakutchis. However, Purplebakutchi, the only one still flying, does something which causes Watchlin, the living watch owned by the twins, to malfunction and send everyone back in time. At that time frame, Mametchi, Memetchi, Kuchipatchi, Pianitchi, and Coffretchi were doing homework. That evening, both of the twins were famished, so they headed over to Music Cafe and were warmly welcomed by Mametchi and Pianitchi. Miraitchi and Clulutchi made a request for Mametchi and Tama-Friends; to assist them in getting back the Dreambakutchis so they can go back home, and all 5 Tamagotchis agreed. X-Kamen was still as much of an obstacle in the present as he was in the future. For the time being, Miraitchi and Clulutchi both attended Dream School, when a mysterious boy named Smartotchi was also attending. Pianitchi was quite fond of Smartotchi due to his exceptional piano playing, but little were the Tamagotchis aware that he was X-Kamen in a "normal" disguise. Miraitchi and Clulutchi also wanted to become fashion designers, and did a homestay with Madamtchi, owner of the miracle shop, as a result. Smartotchi eventually informed Miraitchi, Clulutchi, and friends that he is actually X-Kamen, and turned from a foe to a friend. Not long after, a cheerful young girl named Candy Paku Paku, who's a close friend of the twins, also teleported to the past and agreed to help find the Dreambakutchis. After all 8 were found, Miraitchi, Clulutchi, Smartotchi, and Candy Paku Paku, despite being reluctant to bid farewell to their friends, did so and returned to the future. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dogatch.jp/news/tx/18289|title=新しい仲間も加わってパワーアップ！『たまごっち！～みらくるフレンズ～』が9月から放送スタート|publisher= PRESENTCAST INC. |date=1 August 2013 |accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;GO-GO Tamagotchi!
Every thousand years on Tamagotchi Planet, continents collide in an event called the Tamagottssun, causing Dream Town and Tamagotchi Town to fuse as "DreamTamatown". Mametchi, Memetchi, and Kuchipatchi reunited with Lovelitchi, Melodytchi, Moriritchi, Himespetchi, Yumemitchi, Kiraritchi, and numerous other characters that left previously. Miraitchi, Clulutchi, and Candy Paku Paku also return to the past to reunite, but Smartotchi didn't for unknown reasons. A massive reunion took place as the Tamagotchis learn about the legends of the Tamagottssun in a wonderful world. Towards Tamagottssun's conclusion, though, something tragic happens; The Tamagotchi Planet itself is crying, limiting the supply of water available. If Tamagotchi Planet wasn't cheered up in time, it would be a permanent drought and the Tamagotchi species would become extinct because just like humans, Tamagotchis need water to survive. Luckily, with a lot of work and effort, Tamagotchi Planet cheered up, Dream Town and Tamagotchi Town returned to their normal, non-fused statuses, and everyone was home with their families. That, however, didn't stop Mametchi from creating his most developed invention ever; the DreamTama Rainbow. It's a special flying submarine-like vehicle that permitted transportation all across Tamagotchi Planet, meaning that the bonds the citizens of Dream Town made with the citizens of Tamagotchi Town and vice versa can last forevermore. After flashbacks from several episodes from the past few seasons, Mametchi and all his Tama-Friends thanked the viewers for watching and everyone waved goodbye to the viewers to show that the anime has officially ended.

==Development==
[[File:Takeshita street view.jpg|left|thumbnail|The Takeshita street in [[Harajuku]], [[Tokyo]], where one of the anime's notable locations were based on.]]
The series was officially meant as a follow-up to the previous series ''Saa Ikou! Tamagotchi'', uniting the staff from [[OLM, Inc.|OLM]]'s Team Kamei division, who produced the two movie adaptations. The official voice actors from the movies reprise their roles in the new series with the format of the anime has two stories per one episode, which became full episodes on the later years. The series ran from October 2009 to 3 September 2012 lasting up to 143 episodes.

One of the locations of the anime, the Tamagotchi Street, or ''Tama-Street'' for short is officially based on the real-life [[Takeshita Street]] in [[Harajuku]], [[Tokyo]], where the Tamagotchi Department Store is found. Production staff do a location research of the place and transitioned it into the Anime during development.

The first anime series officially aired in all [[TX Network]] Stations, including [[TV Tokyo]] and [[TV Osaka]] from 12 October 2009 to 3 September 2012, replacing both the Japanese broadcast of ''[[Lilo &amp; Stitch|Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series]]'' and ''[[Hikaru no Go]]'' on their respected timeslots. It also aired in the Japanese Pay-for-View channel [[Animax]]. The series gained its official English broadcast in [[Australia]] and aired in the TV network [[9Go!|GO!]] (Only the first 26 episodes were dubbed in English, and it isn't likely that dubbing will continue, as GO! no longer airs ''Tamagotchi!'') and also aired in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]] through [[TVB]] and [[YoYo TV]]. It also aired in the [[Philippines]] through [[GMA Network]].

The second series titled {{nihongo|''Tamagotchi! Yume Kira Dream''|たまごっち! ゆめキラドリーム|Tamagotchi! Yume Kira Dorīmu}} first began its airing from 10 September 2012 to 29 August 2013. The series changed timeslot on 25 March 2013, being replaced with the show ''[[Why Did You Come to Japan?]]'' to its new timeslot on 4 April 2013 Thursday. Bandai America divided and dubbed the first seven episodes of this series as webisodes for the Tamagotchi Friends website (There's a total of 14 webisodes, and every two contain a scene from one of the first seven Tamagotchi! Yume Kira Dream episodes.)

The third series, {{nihongo|''Tamagotchi! Miracle Friends''|たまごっち! みらくるフレンズ|Tamagotchi! Mirakuru Furenzu}} officially aired from 5 September 2013 to 27 March 2014 with a total of 29 episodes, making it the shortest Tamagotchi season ever released. The fourth and final series titled {{nihongo|''GO-GO Tamagotchi!''|GO-GO たまごっち!}} began airing on 3 April 2014 and ended on 26 March 2015. No new episodes have been broadcast since then, although a rebroadcast series called {{nihongo|''Tamagotchi! Tama Tomo Daishū GO!''}} began airing on 2 April 2015 and ended on 29 September 2015. This marked the first and only series in the franchise to include Live-Action Segments.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-04-05/tamagotchi-tama-tomo-daishu-go-anime-promo-streamed/.86543&lt;/ref&gt;

A short film based on the series, ''Eiga Tamagotchi: Himitsu no Otodoke Dai Saisuken!'', was released with the ''[[Kamisama Minarai: Himitsu no Cocotama|Himitsu no Cocotama]]'' movie on April 28, 2017. The short film centers around the Tama-Friends, who are assigned to deliver a package to the Gotchi King, when a giant mechanical claw controlled by the Spacy Brothers intervenes with the delivery.

Each of the anime series were released in [[DVD]] by [[Bandai Visual]] in Japan. The first series is also released online through the streaming service [[Bandai Channel]], focusing on each mini-arc.

===Cancellation===
Before the anime was officially ended as for March 2015 and was replaced by ''[[Kamisama Minarai: Himitsu no Cocotama]]'' in its initial timeslot, the franchise notice that the "Tamagotchi 4U" sales were doing worse as expected. Aya Matsui, the main writer of the series already left the team as well. However, the franchise still made more merchandise even though the anime ended.

The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word for ''four'' ({{linktext|四}}, [[pinyin]]: sì, [[jyutping]]: sei&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), sounds quite similar to the word for ''death'' ({{linktext|死}}, [[pinyin]]: sǐ, [[jyutping]]: sei&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), in many [[varieties of Chinese]]. Similarly, the [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]], [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean]], and [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] words for ''four'', shi (し, [[Japanese language|Japanese]]), and sa (사, [[Korean language|Korean]]), sound similar or identical to ''death'' in each language (see [[Korean numerals]], [[Japanese numerals]], [[Vietnamese numerals]]). Tetraphobia is known to occur in Korea and Japan since the two words sound identical, but not at all in Vietnam because they carry different [[Vietnamese phonology#Tone|tones]] (in the case of the word for "four", whether it is the Sino-Vietnamese reading ''tứ'' or the more common non-Sino-Vietnamese reading ''tư'', neither sounds like the word for "death" which is ''tử''), and Vietnamese does not use Sino-Vietnamese numerals as often in the first place.

Special care may be taken to avoid occurrences or reminders of the number 4 during everyday life, especially during festive holidays, or when a family member is ill. Mentioning the number 4 around a sick relative is strongly avoided. Giving four of something is strongly discouraged. [[Elevator]]s in Asia and Asian neighborhoods often skip the 4th floor. Military aircraft and ships also avoid the number 4 (such as the South Korean and Taiwanese navies). April 4 is also considered an exceptionally unlucky day, much like [[Friday the 13th]] in the West.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Similarly, {{num|14}}, {{num|24}}, {{num|42}}, etc. are also to be avoided due to the presence of the digit 4 in these numbers. In these countries, these floor numbers are often skipped in buildings, ranging from hotels to offices to apartments, as well as hospitals. Table number 4, 14, 24, 42, etc. are also often left out in wedding dinners or other social gatherings in these countries. In many residential complexes, building block 4, 14, 24 etc. are either omitted or replaced with block 3A, 13A, and 23A. Hospitals are of grave concern and the number 4 is regularly avoided altogether. Tetraphobia can dictate property prices. Neighborhoods have removed four from their street names and become more profitable as a result.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} In the same way, buildings with multiple fours can suffer price cuts.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Four is also avoided in phone numbers, security numbers, business cards, addresses, ID numbers, and other numbers and are considered severe as they are personally attached to the person.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Tetraphobia far surpasses [[triskaidekaphobia]] (Western superstitions around the number 13). It even permeates the business world in these regions of Asia.&lt;ref name="TetraBiz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acclaro.com/translation-localization-blog/tetraphobia-and-doing-business-in-asia-252 |title=Doing business in Tetraphobic Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural examples by country ==

===In Mainland China===
{{See also|Numbers in Chinese culture#Unlucky numbers}}
Chinese is a tonal language with a comparatively small inventory of permitted syllables, resulting in an exceptionally large number of [[homophone]] words. Many of the numbers are homophones or near-homophones of other words and have therefore acquired superstitious meanings.

The Chinese avoid phone numbers and addresses with fours, especially when they are combined with another number that changes the meaning. Example: “94” could be interpreted as being dead for a long time.

The [[People's Republic of China]] makes free use of the number 4 in many military designations for [[People's Liberation Army]] equipment, with examples including the [[Dongfeng-4]] ICBM, [[Type 094 submarine]], and [[Type 054A frigate]], although the practice of starting aircraft designations with 5 leads some{{who|date=February 2017}} to speculate that it avoids the starting numeral 4 for aircraft designations much as the United States avoids use of the number 13 in that context.&lt;ref name="SecT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/4.htm |title=Chinese Military Tetraphobia}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the navies of the [[Republic of China Navy|Republic of China]] (Taiwan) and of [[Republic of Korea Navy|South Korea]] refrain from using the number 4 when assigning [[pennant number]]s to their ships.

While in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaking regions in China, 14 and 74 are considered more unlucky than the individual 4, since 14 sounds like "wants / is going to die" (要死) and 74 like "will certainly die" or "will die in anger" (氣死).

When [[Beijing]] lost its bid to stage the [[2000 Olympic Games]], it was speculated that the reason China did not pursue a bid for the following [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Games]] was due to the unpopularity of the number 4 in China. Instead, the city waited another four years, and would eventually host the [[2008 Olympic Games]], the number eight being a lucky number in Chinese culture.

===In Hong Kong===
In [[Hong Kong]], some apartments such as Vista Paradiso and [[Union Square (Hong Kong)#The Arch|The Arch]] skip all the floors from 40 to 49, which is the entire 40s. Immediately above the 39th floor is the 50th floor, leading many who are not aware of tetraphobia to believe that some floors are missing. Tetraphobia is not the main reason, but rather as an excuse to have apartments with 'higher' floors, thus increasing the price, because higher floors in Hong Kong apartments are usually more expensive (see [[39 Conduit Road]]). For [[Cantonese]] speakers, 14 and 24 are considered more unlucky than the individual 4, since 14 ({{zh|cy=sahp sei}}) sounds like "will certainly die" ({{lang|zh-hk|實死}}, {{zh|cy=saht séi}}), and 24 ({{zh|cy=yih sei}}) sounds like "easy to die" ({{lang|zh-hk|易死}}, {{zh|cy=yih séi}}).

Due to the blending of East Asian and Western cultures, it is possible in some buildings that both the [[thirteenth floor]] and the fourteenth floor are skipped, causing the twelfth floor to precede the fifteenth floor, along with all the other 4s. Thus a building whose top floor is numbered 100 would, in fact, have just eighty floors.

===In Taiwan===
In Taiwan not using house numbers ending in 4 without remembering to occasionally skip numbers on the opposite side too, often results in the two sides of a street getting more and more out of sync as one advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jidanni.org/geo/house_numbering/four.html |title=門牌忌四之配套， 以維持左右協調 Methods to balance house numbers opposite skipped 4|website=jidanni.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Southeast Asia===
Because of the significant population of Chinese and influence of Chinese culture in Southeast Asia, 4 is also considered to be unlucky.

In buildings of [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], where Chinese are significant in population with 25% of Malaysians and 75% of Singaporeans being Chinese, the floor number 4 is occasionally skipped.

Singaporean public transport operator [[SBS Transit]] has omitted the number plates for some of its buses whose numbers end with '4' due to this, so if a bus is registered as SBS***3*, SBS***4* will be omitted and the next bus to be registered will be SBS***5*. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Issue/straitstimes20080611-1# |title=Straits Times: DRIVER TRAPPED IN BUS AFTER COLLISION |last= |first= |date=June 11, 2008 |work= |page=34 |access-date=December 2, 2016 |via=NLB E-resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that this only applies to certain buses and not others and that the final asterisk is the checksum letter and not a number. For example, if the bus is registered as SBS7533J, SBS7534G will be omitted and the next bus to be registered will be SBS7535D.

Singaporean public transport operator [[SMRT Corporation|SMRT]] has omitted the '4' as the first digit of the serial number of the train cars as well as the [[SMRT Buses]] NightRider services {{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}.

In [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]], several skyscraper buildings skip 4th and 14th floor, especially those which are funded by Chinese descendants. For example in [[The Plaza Semanggi|Plaza Semanggi]], 4th floor is replaced by 3A. In [[The Energy Tower]], 39th floor is followed by 50th floor. Some buildings, mostly owned by non-Chinese, have a 4th floor. Popular examples are government buildings, the [[Sarinah]] departement store and [[Pacific Place Jakarta|Pacific Place]].

In [[Vietnam]], the [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] words for "four" (tứ) is used more in formal context than in everyday life and its spoken sound is clearly different from word for "death" (tử). The [[Chữ nôm]] word "bốn" equivalent to word "tứ" is often used, therefore the number 4 is rarely avoided. Even so, in the past Vietnamese people often named their children "tư" or "tứ", which means "the fourth child born in family".

===In South Korea===
In [[South Korea]], tetraphobia is less extreme, the number 4 sounds like "decease" and "died" (사), but the floor number 4 or room number 4 is almost always skipped in hospitals, funeral halls, and similar public buildings. In other buildings, the fourth floor is sometimes labelled "F" (Four) instead of "4" in elevators. Apartment numbers containing multiple occurrences of the number 4 (such as 404) are likely to be avoided to an extent that the value of the property is adversely affected. The national railroad, [[Korail]], left out the locomotive number 4444 when numbering a locomotive class from 4401 upwards. Some of these combinations were considered more unlucky than the individual 4, 14 sounds like "Time to be deceased" ('''사'''망 할 '''시'''간), 44 sounds like "Died and Deceased" ('''사'''망 및 '''사'''망자).

===Outside Asia===
Efforts to accommodate tetraphobia-related sensitivities have been seen in [[Canada]] which has a significant population of [[Chinese Canadians|Chinese descent]]. [[Richmond Hill, Ontario]], banned the number four on new houses in June 2013. Property developers in [[Vancouver]] omitted the number from new buildings until October 2015, when the city banned non-sequential numbering schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tetraphobia: Nothing to fear... |url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21679535-fear-itself-nothing-fear |accessdate=4 December 2015 |work=[[The Economist]] |date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=No. 4 banned from new Richmond Hill, Ont., street addresses |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2013/06/04/richmond-hill-4.html |publisher=CBC News |accessdate=9 June 2013 |date=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tetraphobia also plays a big role in [[Australia|Australian]] realty. According to Daily Mail Australia, Australian real estate property prices grew 10.5% in 2015. This jump in prices came from the new business buildings and high rises built in Sydney Australia avoiding any reference to the number four. They do not have four in their address nor in their floor numbers. They skip 4, 14, 24 and so on. One business building is a cooperate building under the company Sun Corporation. Several apartment complexes in Australia are now following this new fad to help appeal to their Asian market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Devlin |first1=Peter |title=DailyMail |url=www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3481168/New-Sydney-apartment-building-deliberately-left-floors-number-four-sounds-similar-death-Chinese.html |website=Daily Mail UK |publisher=Associated Newspaper Ltd. |accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate examples==
===Nokia===
The software platform [[Symbian]], used by [[Finland|Finnish]] telecommunications firm [[Nokia]] in their [[S60 (software platform)|Series 60]] platform, avoids releases beginning with 4, as it did when it was EPOC and owned by [[Psion (computers)|Psion]] (there was no Psion Series 4, and there was no 4th edition of S60). This was done "as a polite gesture to Asian customers".&lt;ref name="s60tetraphobia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.s60.com/2008/10/s60-5th-edition-and-the-nokia-5800-xpressmusic-are-here |title=S60 5th Edition and the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic are here! - S60 Blogs |work=[[Internet Archive]] |accessdate=7 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611150432/http://blogs.s60.com/2008/10/s60-5th-edition-and-the-nokia-5800-xpressmusic-are-here |archivedate=June 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mahoney"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mahoney |first=Barrie |title=Message in a Bottle |series=Twitters from the Atlantic |date=1 October 2012 |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |isbn=1480031003 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Nokia did not release any products under the 4xxx series, although some of Nokia's other products do contain the number 4, such as the [[Series 40]] platform, and the [[Nokia 3410]].

===SaskTel===
When [[area code 306]] was nearing exhaustion in 2011, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] originally proposed that the new area code be 474.&lt;ref name="CRTC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2010/2010-784.htm |title=ARCHIVED - Telecom Decision CRTC 2010-784 |accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, representatives from [[SaskTel]] requested that the new area code be 639 instead, to avoid the negative connotations of 4 in Asian cultures. 639 was subsequently approved as the new area code.&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/story/2011/06/14/sk-area-code-changes.html |title=639 to be Sask.'s 2nd area code - Saskatchewan - CBC News |work=[[CBC.ca]] |accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== OnePlus ===
The Chinese [[smartphone]] manufacturer [[OnePlus]] chose to name its smartphone model after the [[OnePlus 3|3]] and [[OnePlus 3T|3T]] the [[OnePlus 5|5]], avoiding the number 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/oneplus-5-release-date-specs-new-leak-confirms-oneplus-4-skip-and-more-180566/ |title=OnePlus 5 Specs: New Leak Confirms OnePlus 4 Skip and More |website=www.christianpost.com |language=en |access-date=2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' reported in a study that looked at mortality statistics in the United States over a 25-year period. They found that on the fourth day of the month, Asian people were thirteen percent more likely to die of heart failure. In California, Asians were twenty-seven percent more likely to die of a heart attack on that day. The purpose of the study was to see if psychological stress caused by belief in this superstition could indeed trigger deadly heart attacks and other fatal incidents.&lt;ref name="TetraJournal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://weber.ucsd.edu/~dphillip/baskerville.html |title=British Medical Journal study}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Unparalleled Invasion'''" is a [[science fiction]] story written by [[Jack London]]. It was first published in ''[[McClure's]]'' in July 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{isfdb title|id=80308|title=The Unparalleled Invasion}}, retrieved 2015-02-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
Under the influence of [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], China modernizes and undergoes its own version of the [[Meiji Restoration|Meiji Reforms]] in the 1910s. In 1922, China breaks away from Japan and fights a brief war that culminates in the Chinese annexation of the Japanese possessions of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]], [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Formosa]], and [[Manchuria]]. Over the next half century, China's population steadily grows, and eventually migration overwhelms European colonies in Asia. The United States and the other Western powers launch a [[biological warfare]] campaign against China, resulting in the destruction of China's population, the few survivors of the plague being killed out of hand by European and American troops. China is then colonized by the Western powers. This opens the way to a joyous epoch of "splendid mechanical, intellectual, and art output". In the 1980s war clouds once more gather between Germany and France, and the story ends with the nations of the world solemnly pledging not to use the same techniques they had against China.

== Background and context ==
"The Unparalleled Invasion" was included in ''The Strength of the Strong'', a collection of stories by London published by [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]] in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacklondons.net/writings/StrengthStrong/contents.html ''The Strength of the Strong''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527044818/http://www.jacklondons.net/writings/StrengthStrong/contents.html |date=2015-05-27 }} The World of Jack London, retrieved 2015-02-04.&lt;/ref&gt; which also included "[[The Dream of Debs]]", a critique of [[capitalism|capitalist society]] in the US, and "The Strength of the Strong", which used a primitive background as metaphor of [[social injustice]] among men. 

"The Unparalleled Invasion" has been controversial for its depiction of [[genocide]] and has been cited&lt;ref name="slate review" /&gt; as evidence of London's [[racism]]. The genocide is described in considerable detail and nowhere is any objection made to it. The terms "yellow life" and "yellow populace" appear in the story. It ends with the "sanitation of China" and its re-settlement by Westerners.

}}Before he disappeared and was found dead, Kuashev had received threats from police after being detained in May from attending the funeral procession, which was held on the 150th anniversary of the ending of the [[Caucasian War]].&lt;ref name=threats&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.kavkaz-uzel.eu/articles/28896/|title=Before his death, journalist Timur Kuashev received threats|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told others, "Employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) of the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic (KBR) had informed some national leaders that I was going to organize a provocation at the march on May 21, namely, to come there with Islamic banners. I declare that it's an absolute lie."&lt;ref name=kavkazuzel1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.kavkaz-uzel.eu/articles/28190/|title=In KBR, Circassian activist and journalist Timur Kuashev released from police|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Kavkazsky Uzel'', an independent regional website, reported that the police who detained Kuashev threatened him in response to his blog posts which criticizing law enforcement. ''Kavkazsky Uzel'' reported that police told Kuashev, "Continue on this path and this will bite you in the ass."&lt;ref name=cpj/&gt;

The disappearance of Kuashev occurred on the evening of July 31, after he had left his apartment to go on a jog. The following day his deceased body was found 15 kilometers from his apartment in a wooded area.&lt;ref name=doshdu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doshdu.ru/novosti/korrespondent-zhurnala-dosh-timur-kuashev-naiden-ubitym-v-nalchike|title=Корреспондент журнала "Дош" Тимур Куашев найден убитым в Нальчике — Первый кавказский независимый журнал "ДОШ"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were signs that indicated poisoning, but investigations are ongoing.&lt;ref name=rferl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/kabardian-journalist-death-unclear/26595192.html|title=Cause of Kabardian Journalist’s Death Still Unclear|date=19 September 2014|publisher=|via=Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6

Kuashev was found on the evening of August 1, 2014. In the outskirts of Nalchik, a suburb of Khasania, is where the body was located at the time of discovery. It was concluded that his death was not violent. An injection wound was found in the left armpit following autopsy.&lt;ref name=rferl/&gt; The cause of his death was revealed to be acute coronary insufficiency,&lt;ref name=kavkazuzel4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.kavkaz-uzel.eu/articles/35842/|title=Advocate reports on closure of case on Timur Kuashev's death|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but ultimately unknown and under continued investigation and appeals. Despite early indications of [[poisoning]], there was no data suggesting it a possible cause.&lt;ref name="doshdu"/&gt;

A trace of an injected substance was found in his blood stream along with a visual injection marking following the autopsy report days after his death. This differs from previous deaths recorded of journalists as other journalists were killed from gunshot wounds. After finding the injected substance, Valery Ustov, the head of the Investigative Management IC Russia for the Kabardino-Balkaria (KBR), said there would be further investigation and described this type of suspected murder for a journalist as unique in Russia.&lt;ref name=proisshestviya&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tass.ru/proisshestviya/1382415|title=СК: на теле погибшего в Нальчике журналиста Куашева обнаружен след от инъекции|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
As of 2015, Russia has been ranked 180 out of 199 countries in terms of [[press freedom]]. Under [[Vladimir Putin]], Russia's ranking for press freedom has steadily declined in the past decade. These rankings come after numerous rumors of Putin's history with journalists that do not agree with him and the possibility of him having them killed. Rumors stem from the death of 34 journalists since 2000, the year Putin was elected into office. For comparison, 2 journalists have died in [[China]] and 3 journalists deaths within the [[United States]] within the same time period.&lt;ref name=politifact&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2016/jan/04/does-vladimir-putin-kill-journalists/|title=Does Vladimir Putin kill journalists?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
After the death of Kuashev, the North Caucasus adds him to one of the ten unsolved deaths in journalists since 2000. In the area of Nalchik and the North Caucasus republic of [[Kabardino-Balkariya]], journalists and human rights activists are known to be killed consistently and with [[impunity]].&lt;ref name=cpj&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cpj.org/blog/2014/08/journalists-death-in-north-caucasus-calls-for-inde.php|title=Journalist's death in North Caucasus calls for independent investigation |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of Timur Kuashev has moved people to continue to investigate the crisis in [[Ukraine]] considering the amount of disappearances, deaths, and injuries pertaining to journalists. Over the course of a year, 7 journalists have been killed in Ukraine, over 170 individuals have been attacked or injured, and over 80 journalists have been detained and abducted.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-eu-30225268|title=Propaganda 'alive and well' amid Ukraine crisis|first=Bethany|last=Bell|date=27 November 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuashev was reported by Reporters Without Borders to be the only journalist to be killed in Russia in 2014.&lt;ref name=kavkazuzel2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.kavkaz-uzel.eu/articles/30251/|title=RWB: the only journalist murdered in Russia in 2014 was Timur Kuashev|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
Within days before his death, colleagues believed that Kuashev was under constant surveillance strictly pertaining to his undercover professional activities. ''Dosh'' editor Abdulla Duduev released a statement on his death saying, "We are absolutely sure that Kuashev's death is directly related to his professional activities."&lt;ref name=cpj/&gt;

[[Irina Bokova]], director-general of [[UNESCO]], said, “It is important for press freedom and for journalists to be able to carry out their professional duties without fearing for their lives. I trust that the authorities will spare no efforts in shedding light into the circumstances of the death of Timur Kuashev.”&lt;ref name=un&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=48435#.WEBa66IrLFM|title=Director-General deplores the death of journalist Timur Kuashev and calls for a thorough investigation
 |publisher=United Nations News Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reporters Without Borders]] released a statement which said, "Timur always wrote effectively, honestly and courageously... at our request on the most current topics – politics, illegal actions by the security forces and special operations."&lt;ref name=theguardian/&gt;

Days after his investigation, Dunja Mijatovic, a representative from the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] and Media of Freedom issued a statement saying, “I express my condolences to Kuashev’s family and colleagues, and hope the authorities will conduct a thorough investigation into the circumstances of his death."&lt;ref name=osce&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/fom/122219|title=OSCE media freedom representative mourns death of journalist in Russia, calls for rigorous investigation - OSCE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six months after the death of Timur Kuashev, a [[petition]] was created and filled with close to 500 signatures insisting the Russian government, [[Investigative Committee of Russia|Investigating Committee of the Russian Federation]] and the Public Human Rights Centre of the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic to push for faster judicial inquiry to come to conclusion for cause of death and to discover the perpetrators who may have caused his death. Valery Khatazhukov, the current head of Public Human Rights Centre of the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic, signed the document and sent it to different investigative parties.&lt;ref name=kavkazuzel3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.kavkaz-uzel.eu/articles/30604/|title=Nearly 500 sign petition demanding to investigate Timur Kuashev's murder|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4369">'''Turismod''' ([[Latin]]: ''Turismodus''&lt;ref name="M"&gt;Martindale 1992, ''s.v. Alboin'', pp. 38 &amp;ndash; 40&lt;/ref&gt;) was a son of the king of the [[Gepids]] [[Thurisind]]. He was killed in 551 or 552 on the battlefield by [[Alboin]], son of the king of the [[Lombards]] [[Audoin]].

Turismod was the oldest son of Thurisind and a brother of [[Cunimund]]; his sibling eventually succeeded their father in circa 560. Thurisind seems to have given to his eldest son the rank of commander of the Gepids in the city of [[Sirmium]] as a way to guarantee his succession to the throne, as this position made him heir apparent. He seems to have had a son, Reptila, who under the reign of Cunimund held Sirmium.&lt;ref&gt;Martindale 1992, ''s.v. Cunimundus'', p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boná 1976, pp. 70, 108&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Paul the Deacon]], he participated to the third [[Lombards|Lombard]]-Gepid War; in 551&lt;ref&gt;Jarnut 1995, pp. 20 &amp;ndash; 21&lt;/ref&gt; or 552&lt;ref name="M"/&gt; in the decisive [[battle of Asfeld]] he was slain there by [[Alboin]], son of the king of the [[Lombards]] [[Audoin]]. His death was always according to Paul the turning point of the battle, as when the other Gepids saw their leader dead they broke the ranks and escaped.&lt;ref name="M"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boná 1976, pp. 7, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, tells Paul who probably took the story from oral tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Goffart 1988, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; maybe an heroic lay dedicated to Alboin,&lt;ref&gt;Boná 1976, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Turismod's killer, Alboin, in order to obtain the right to become his father's table-companion as was customary to Lombards had to ask for the hospitality of a foreign king and have the king arm him; for this initiation he went with 40 companions to the court of Turismod's father Thurisind.&lt;ref name="Ausenda"&gt;Ausenda 1999, p. 433&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gasparri 2000, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boná 1976, pp. 7 &amp;ndash; 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Thurisind, in observance of the laws of hospitality, lets Alboin and his companions participate to a banquet given in their honor offering Alboin the seat where Turismod habitually stood. Following a mockery by Turismod's brother [[Cunimund]] and Alboin's rejoinder, a clash is avoided just by Thurisind's intervention, who puts peace and sends away Alboin with Turismod's arms. According to István Boná, who believes in the veracity of this story, the facts may have taken place as described by Paul but it also could reflect a secret peace condition imposed by Audoin on Thurisind under which the Gepid king had to arm his son's killer.&lt;ref name="M"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ausenda"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga 2003, pp. 68 &amp;ndash; 69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boná 1976, pp. 7 &amp;ndash; 8, 12&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''West African lungfish''' (''Protopterus annectens''), also known as the '''Tana lungfish''' or simply '''African lungfish''', is a species of [[African lungfish]].&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;&lt;ref name=fishbase&gt;{{Fishbase|Protopterus|annectens|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is found in a wide range of freshwater habitats in [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa|Middle Africa]], as well as the northern half of [[Southern Africa]].&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;&lt;ref name=fishbase/&gt;

==Description==
''Protopterus annectens'' has a prominent [[snout]] and small [[eye]]s. Its body is long and [[eel]]-like, some 9–15 times the length of the head. It has two pairs of long, filamentous [[Fish fin|fins]]. The [[pectoral fin]]s have a basal fringe and are about three times the head length, while its [[pelvic fin]]s are about twice the head length. In general, three external [[Fish gill|gills]] are inserted posterior to the [[gill slit]]s and above the pectoral fins.

It has [[cycloid scale]]s embedded in the skin. About 40–50 scales occur between the [[operculum (fish)|operculum]] and the [[anus]], and 36–40 around the body before the origin of the [[dorsal fin]]. It has 34–37 pairs of [[rib]]s. The [[Dorsum (anatomy)|dorsal]] side is olive or brown in color and the [[ventral]] side is lighter, with great blackish or brownish spots on the body and fins except on its belly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eol.org/pages/1298995?text_id=6652736 EOL.org]&lt;/ref&gt; They reach a length of about {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primitivefishes.com/pannectens.htm Primitivefishes.com (Retrieved May 13, 2010.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution ==
The West African lungfish is distributed throughout Africa.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Protopterus annectens summary page|url = http://www.fishbase.org/summary/2384|website = FishBase|accessdate = 2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has two subspecies; ''P. a. annectens''  is found primarily in the basins of [[Sahel]] as well as [[Guinea]] and [[Sierra Leone]] whilst the other subspecies, ''P. a.'' ''brieni''  is known largely from the upper [[Congo River]] area and from the [[Zambezi]] of [[Mozambique]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Habitat ==
Like other [[Protopteridae|African lungfish]], the West African lungfish is an obligate air breather and a freshwater-dwelling fish.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is demersal, meaning that it lives primarily buried within riverbeds. Due to the dry season frequently drying the rivers and floodplains in which it lives, the West African lungfish can [[aestivate]] for up to a year; however the West African lungfish generally only aestivates between wet seasons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Diet ==
The Tana lungfish has a diet not unlike other lungfish, consisting of various mollusks, crabs, [[prawn]], and small fish within its distribution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It can also go for up to 3 1/2 years without any food intake whatsoever. During this time period it behaves much like an estivating fish in that it buries itself in the mud and does not move until more favorable conditions occur.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:LepidosirenFord.jpg|500px|left]]

The '''Widow’s Pension''' was one of the oldest established part of the Social Security system in the United Kingdom.  It was replaced by [[Bereavement benefit]] in April 2001.

Benefits for Widows were first established by the [[Widows', Orphans' and Old Age Contributory Benefits Act 1925]] at a rate of 10 shillings a week for life, or remarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ogus &amp; Barendt|title=The Law of Social Security|year=1988|publisher=Butterworths|isbn=0406633703|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To get any benefit as a widow a woman had to be married to her husband, and be his only wife, at the time of his death. She was still entitled if separated or if a divorce had not reached the stage of decree absolute. All Widow's benefits stop on remarriage.

The claimant had to be over 45 but under 65 either when their husband died or when their [[Widowed Mother’s Allowance]] stopped.

There was also an entitlement an earnings related component.  Widows under 55 when their husband died or when they ceased being entitled to Widowed Mother’s Allowance got a reduction is 7% for each year they were below 55.

Widow’s Pension lasted until retirement and was taxable

It counted in full for all [[Means-tested benefit]]s. It was possible to get [[Incapacity Benefit]] together with widow’s pension.
