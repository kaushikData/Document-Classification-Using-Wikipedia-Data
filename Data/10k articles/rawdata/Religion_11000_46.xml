      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7110">The '''argument from consciousness''' is an [[argument]] for the [[existence of God]] based on [[consciousness]]. The best-known defender of the argument from consciousness is [[J. P. Moreland]].

==Philosophical summary of the argument==

The argument may be stated in [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] or [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] form&lt;ref&gt;Both these are following J. P Moreland "The Argument from Consciousness" in ''The Rationality of Theism'' ed Paul Copan and Paul Moser, London:Routeledge (2003) {{ISBN|0-415-26332-8}} and J. P Moreland "Consciousness and The Existence of God"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inductive form===
Given [[theism]] and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] as live options fixed by our background beliefs, theism provides a better explanation of consciousness than naturalism, and thus receives some confirmation from the existence of consciousness.

===Deductive form===
# Genuinely nonphysical mental states exist.
# There is an explanation for the existence of mental states.
# Personal explanation (PE) is different from natural scientific explanation (NSE).
# The explanation for the existence of mental states is either a PE or a NSE.
# The explanation is not an NSE.
# Therefore, the explanation is a PE.
# If the explanation is PE, it is theistic.
# Therefore, the explanation is theistic.

Theists such as [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]]&lt;ref&gt;see [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]] "Flavors, Colors and God" reprinted in ''Contemporary Perspectives on Religious Epistemology'' OUP (1992) pp225-40&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Swinburne]]&lt;ref&gt;see [[Richard Swinburne]] ''The Existence of God'' Oxford:Clarendon (1979) Ch 9; ''The Evolution of the Soul'' 183-9 etc.&lt;/ref&gt; have advanced slightly a different version of this argument which focuses on mental/physical correlations and not merely the existence of mental states.

William Lane Craig put the argument from consciousness as follows &lt;ref&gt;https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/existence-nature-of-god/does-god-exist1/&lt;/ref&gt;:
#If God did not exist, intentional states of consciousness would not exist.
#But intentional states of consciousness do exist.
#Therefore, God exists.

==Criticism==

The first premise,  assertion that non-physical mental states exist, implies a [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist view of mind]]. Therefore, one serious line of attack is to argue the case for [[physicalism]] about the human mind.&lt;ref&gt;Melnyk, Andrew (2007). [http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/andrew_melnyk/physicalism.html "A Case for Physicalism about the Human Mind"]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreland takes the arguments for the first premise and refers to classic defenses of dualism. However, the first premise is rejected by many philosophers of mind. [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]], known for the [[knowledge argument]] in support of dualism about the mind, comments on the debate between physicalist and dualist conceptions of mind:
{{quote|
Much of the contemporary debate in the philosophy of mind is concerned with the clash between certain strongly held intuitions and what science tells us about the mind and its relation to the world. What science tells us about the mind points strongly towards some version or other of physicalism. The intuitions, in one way or another, suggest that there is something seriously incomplete about any purely physical story about the mind ... Most contemporary philosophers given a choice between going with science and going with intuitions, go with science. Although I once dissented from the majority, I have capitulated and now see the interesting issue as being where the arguments from the intuitions against physicalism—the arguments that seem so compelling—go wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Frank Cameron (2003) [http://consciousness.anu.edu.au/jackson/mindillusion.pdf "Mind and Illusion"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706124725/http://consciousness.anu.edu.au/jackson/mindillusion.pdf |date=July 6, 2008 }}, in ''Minds and Persons'', Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;}}

If one is willing to accept the first premise that reductive forms of physicalism are false, then the argument takes off. Thus, one could think of Moreland as making an argument that tries to move a person from "rejecting physicalism" to "accepting theism". The crucial step in this move is the fifth premise, which asserts that naturalism can not account for non-physical mental states. A simple critique of this premise is offered by Andrew Melnyk:
{{quote|
Naturalism can easily explain how the universe came to contain physically irreducible conscious occurrences. It can do so by supposing that, among the fundamental laws governing the universe, there are some according to which, whenever such-and-such complex nonconscious occurrences occur, so-and-so conscious occurrences occur; perhaps such a law says that, whenever a human brain attains a certain kind and degree of complexity, a pain is experienced. Given such laws, the capacity for consciousness that some creatures enjoy, like the capacity for breathing, can be explained as having arisen through natural selection. Through mutation, some creature was born with a brain of the requisite kind and degree of complexity to generate conscious experiences; and then, because these experiences increased the creature's fitness, such creatures were selected for.&lt;ref&gt;Melnyk, Andrew (2007). [http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/andrew_melnyk/against-dualism.html#conscious "Naturalism, Free Choices, and Conscious Experiences"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However Moreland charges that such attempts to accommodate consciousness within an atheistic worldview are ''ad hoc'' and contrived and fail to take into account many features of conscious experience.&lt;ref&gt;Moreland,J.P. (2007). [http://afterall.net/papers/490852 "Argument from consciousness"]&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreland spends much of the book defending this premise against philosophers, such as [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]], who accept pluralist naturalism. He also critiques contemporary philosophers of mind such as [[John Searle]], [[Timothy O' Connor]], [[Colin McGinn]], [[David Skriba]], [[Philip Clayton (philosopher)|Philip Clayton]] and [[Jaegwon Kim]], who attempt to account for consciousness.

Finally, one can also question premise seven: why does a personal explanation have to lead to [[monotheistic]] (as opposed to [[deist]]ic or [[polytheist]]ic) accounts of intention?&lt;ref&gt;Steven J. Conifer (2001). [http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/steven_conifer/ac.html "The Argument from Consciousness Refuted"].&lt;/ref&gt; However, Moreland maintains that questioning these minor premises is of little consolation to the naturalist as they essentially constitute intramural theist debates, and that for most westerners theism is the only viable candidate to accommodate personal explanations. Similarly [[Occam's razor]] can be applied so only one personal agent is required.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2097">In ''[[Lingayat]]'' theology, the '''''Ashtavaranas''''' ('''ಅಷ್ಟಾವರಣ''', '''ಎಂಬಗೆ''', '''ಎಂಟು ಬಗೆ''') refer to the eight virtues that act as shields or coverings protecting the devotee from extraneous distractions and influences of ''[[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]''. ''Ashta'' means 'eight' and ''Avarana'' means 'covering'. They also protect against attachment to worldly desires.

The ''Ashtavaranas'' are described as,
* ''[[Guru]]''
* ''Linga [[Ishta-Linga]]''
* ''[[Jangama]]''
* ''[[Vibhuti]] or [[Bhasma]]''
* ''[[Rudraksha]]''
* ''[[Padodaka]]''
* ''[[Prasada]]''
* ''[[Mantra]]''
Among the ashtavarnas, Guru, Linga and Jangama are the human beings to be worshiped. Guru means religious teacher at some stage his own conscious (arivu) can also become guru. Linga is considered to be the self (inner atma). and Lastly the Jangama is the human who wonders and propagates the teachings of dharma.
Vibhuti, Mantra and Rudraksha are the things, by which one has to worship Guru, Linga and Jangama. Vibhuti is the indication of purity. It also means that the it is burnt ash of interest towards other woman, Gold and Land. Mantra is the holy chanting words. Normally Lingayats chant " OM SHRI GURUBASAVA LINGAYA NAMAH" and some chant " OM NAMAH SHIVAYA". Rudraksha is the thing one has to wear on the body. Rudraksha are available in punchamukhi and Ekmukhi Rudrakshas. In spiritually it is the symbol of third eye of "MAHADEVA" or "SHIVA". Here it can be interpreted as inner conscious, which plays as third eye.
Lastly Padaodaka and Prasada are the outcomes of this worship. Padodaka is the liquid, and Prasad is food. Here spiritually one can interpret Padodaka as the knowledge outcome from Guru, Linga and Jangama's when they discuss daily concerns with their [[Anubhava (Hindu thought)|Anubhava]] (experience). Prasad is the daily food accepted after the worship.

The school was closed by government decree in 1934. Source: [http://denial.bahai.org/003.php ''History of Bahá'í Educational Efforts in Iran''].]]
A '''Bahá'í school''' at its simplest would be a school run officially by the Bahá'í institutions in its jurisdiction and may be a local class or set of classes, normally run weekly where children get together to study about [[Bahá'í teachings]], [[:Category:Bahá'í central figures|Bahá'í central figures]], or [[Bahá'í administration]].  Bahá'í topics may be minimized in favor of a general curriculum, often with an [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] form, with accreditation from a variety of sources.

Foremost among them are [[Green Acre]], the "paradigmatic of a Bahá'í institution", was founded in 1894 for exploring religious diversity seeking unity, and the first Bahá'ís appearing there in 1901. It came officially under Bahá'í management institutionally from 1916 after several years of promoting Bahá'í ideas under Sarah Farmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sandra Hutchinson|author2=Richard Hollinger | editor-last =Keller| editor-first = Rosemary Skinner | editor2-last = Ruether | editor2-first =Rosemary Radford | editor3-last =Cantlon | editor3-first = Marie |title=Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America: Native American creation stories | chapter =Women in the North American Baha'i Community | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=WPILfbtT5tQC&amp;pg=PA776 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WPILfbtT5tQC|year=2006|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-34687-8|pages=776–786}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schmidt&gt;{{cite book|author=Leigh Eric Schmidt|title=Restless Souls: The Making of American Spirituality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wbk80IOIgzEC|chapter=Freedom and Self-surrender|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wbk80IOIgzEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA181#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=6 August 2012|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-95411-3| pages= 181–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a Bahá'í institution it began to inspire other regional schools in the United States for the religion: first came [[Bosch Bahá'í School]] becoming more formally a Bahá'í school in 1927 and another in 1931 at [[Louhelen Bahá'í School]].

Prior to 1911 a private school for girls existed in Tehran which was opened by Iranian Bahá'í women.&lt;ref name="RK"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Rostam-Kolayi | first =Jasamin | title =Origins of Iran's Modern Girls' Schools: From Private/National to Public/State| journal =[[Journal of Middle East Women's Studies]] | volume =4 | issue =3 | pages =55–88 |publisher = [[Duke University Press]] | jstor =10.2979/MEW.2008.4.3.58 | doi =10.2979/MEW.2008.4.3.58 | date =Fall 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2979/MEW.2008.4.3.58 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]] situations required the close of the school. The successor Tarbiyat-i Banat (Girls’ Education), established in 1911, was the most respected Baha’i girls’ school. Founded on the efforts of private school for girls by Bahá'ís,&lt;ref name="RK"/&gt; it was re-opened under the direction of an Iranian Bahá'í boys’ school committee and several American Bahá'í female [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]]. Even though it catered to the Iranian Bahá'í community, Tarbiyat attracted children from non-Bahá'í families, as the curriculum was largely secular.

Other examples of Bahá'í schools include the [[Nancy Campbell Collegiate Institute]] in [[Canada]], the [[Townshend International School]] in the [[Czech Republic]], or the [[New Era High School]] in [[India]]. Bahá'í membership is not required. In Iran, struggles with [[persecution of Bahá'ís]] have led to the development of a sophisticated University-like institution (such as the [[Bahá'í Institute for Higher Education]]).

In recent decades a trend to multiply services of the community in neighbourhood children's classes has taken hold in Bahá'í communities at the urging of the [[Universal House of Justice]]. This is not meant to replace central schools but to provide spiritual education on a local basis. In some communities this has resulted in the closing of a central "Sunday school", while in others, both approaches are maintained. See [[Ruhi Institute]].

==Bahá'í-inspired school==
A '''Bahá'í-inspired school''' is a school run by an independent agency unaffiliated with any institution of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] but with explicit connections - such as having Bahá'ís in its administrative leadership or involved in the founding of the school. While these schools often focus on general ideas from [[Bahá'í teachings]], [[:Category:Bahá'í central figures|Bahá'í central figures]], or [[Bahá'í administration]],  Bahá'í topics are minimized in favor of academic strength. Examples include [[Banani International Secondary School]] in [[Zambia]]; [[Townshend International School]] in the [[Czech Republic]];  [[Forel International School]] in [[Slovakia]];  [[School of the Nations (Macau)|School of the Nations]] in [[Macau]]; the [[Barli Development Institute for Rural Women]] in [[India]]; and the now-defunct [[Maxwell International School]] in [[Canada]].

'''Bedse Caves''' (also known as '''Bedsa Caves''') are a group of [[Buddhist]] [[Indian rock-cut architecture|rock-cut monuments]] situated in [[Maval]] taluka, [[Pune District]], [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]. The history of the [[cave]]s can be traced back to the [[Satavahana]] period&lt;ref&gt;Michell, 351&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1st century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 54&lt;/ref&gt; They are some 9 km from the [[Bhaja Caves]].

There are two main caves. The best known cave is the ''[[chaitya]]'' (prayer hall - Cave 7) with a comparatively large [[stupa]], the other cave is the monastery or [[vihara]] (Cave 11).  They are marked by a profusion of decorative [[gavaksha]] or chaitya arch [[motif (visual arts)|motifs]].&lt;ref&gt;Michell, 351-352&lt;/ref&gt;   

==Chaitya==
Cave 7, the chaitya hall, is reached by a long narrow passage into the rock.  The front [[verandah]] has four very elaborate columns with capitals of pairs of animals and riders of "solemn grandeur".&lt;ref&gt;Michell, 351-352; Harle, 54, quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  Beside these the side walls are covered with low-[[relief]] gavakshas and latticework representing architectural railings, comparable to those in the same place at the slightly later chaitya in the [[Karla Caves]].  In contrast, and unlike Karla, the chaitya hall itself has little decoration, with plain octagonal columns.  The decorative ribs on the roof, which in other chaityas are stone replicating wooden architecture, were actual wood here, and have been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Michell, 351-352; Harle, 54&lt;/ref&gt; 

An inscription on one of the gate arches reads: ''Gift of Pushyanka, son of Ananda Sethi from Nashik''.

==Vihara==
The vihara at Cave 11 has a rather unusual form, with a main chamber shaped somewhat like a chaitya, with a rectangular plan with a rounded [[apse|apsidal]] far end, and a [[Vault (architecture)|vault]]ed roof. This is now open to the outside, but presumably originally had a wooden screen. Around the chamber are nine doors to cells, each with a relief chaitya-arch surround.  [[Frieze]]s with railing patterns run round the room at two levels.  There are four further cells outside where the screen would have been.&lt;ref&gt;Michell, 352&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other==
There is also a small [[stupa]] outside to the right of the main caves.  Until around 1861 the caves were regularly maintained - even painted. These works were ordered by local authorities in order to please [[United Kingdom|British]] officers who often visited caves. This has caused loss of the remnants of plaster with murals on it.

==Visiting==
Both caves face [[east]]wards so it is recommended to visit the caves in the early morning, as in [[sunlight]] the beauty of carvings is enhanced. 

Bedse Caves can be reached from [[Pune]] via [[Kamshet]]. Upon reaching Kamshet Chowk, left route is to be taken. That route goes straight to Bedse Village where the caves are located. They can also be reached via Paud - Tikona Peth - Pawananagar. Alternate route is from Somatne-Phata on the Pune-Mumbai NH4 [[Highway]].

Bedse Caves are comparatively less known and less visited. People know about the nearby [[Karla Caves]] and [[Bhaja Caves]] but have hardly heard of Bedse Caves. The [[trilogy]] of the caves (Karla - Bhaje - Bedse) in Mawal Region can't be completed without Bedse. An easy hike through 400 steps leads to the caves. Also close to the Bedse caves are the famous foursome of [[Lohagad]], [[Visapur fort|Visapur]], [[Tung Fort|Tung]] and [[Tikona]] forts adjoining the [[Pawana Dam]].

The best time to visit Bedse Caves is the rainy season as the hills are filled with lush greenery during that time. Also many small waterfalls are created that can only be enjoyed during the rainy season. As this is one of the lesser known spots, not many tourists throng the place, so makes it easy to enjoy the views.

'''Benno Schotz''' (28 August 1891 [[Kuressaare|Arensburg]] – 11 October 1984 [[Glasgow]]) was an Estonian-born Scottish sculptor, and one of twentieth century Scotland's leading artists.

==Biography ==

===Early life===
Schotz was the youngest of six children of [[Jew]]ish parents, Jacob Schotz, a watchmaker, and Cherna Tischa Abramovitch. He was educated at the Boys Grammar School of [[Pärnu]], [[Estonia]]. Later he studied at the [[Grossherzogliche Technische Hochschule]] in [[Darmstadt]], Germany.

In 1912, he immigrated to Glasgow, where he gained an engineering diploma from the [[Royal Technical College]]. From 1914 to 1923 he worked in the drawing office of [[John Brown and Company]], a [[Clydebank]] [[shipbuilding|shipbuilder]]s, while attending evening classes in sculpture at the [[Glasgow School of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;Manz, S. &amp; Panayi, P. (2013) ''Refugees and Cultural Transfer to Britain'' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aS-PAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=john%20keppie&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20keppie&amp;f=false page 56] Routledge. {{ISBN|1317965930}} Retrieved March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artistic career===
Schotz became a full-time sculptor in 1923. An important early patron was the Dundee art collector William Boyd, thanks to whose influence both Dundee Dental School and Dundee Art Galleries &amp; Museums hold pieces by him.&lt;ref name="DundeeCourier"&gt;{{Citation
 | title = DENTAL HOSPITAL BENEFACTRESS
 | newspaper = Dundee Courier
 | page = 5
 | date = 19 September 1936
}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this point onwards his reputation grew and he became a full member of the [[Royal Scottish Academy]], head of sculpture at the Glasgow School of Art (a post he held from 1938 until his retirement in 1961), and eventually was appointed the [[Sculptor in Ordinary for Scotland]] in 1963. His pupils included the artists [[Hannah Frank]],  Stewart Bowman Johnson, and [[Inge King| Inge King (née Neufeld)]].

His homes at West Campbell Street and later Kirklee Road were a focus for meetings of artists, writers, actors, and politicians. He was also a member of [[Glasgow Art Club]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/organization.php?id=msib6_1231758399 Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain &amp; Ireland 1851–1951] Retrieved 17 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He also helped refugees such as [[Jankel Adler]] and [[Josef Herman]].

He was a committed [[Zionist]], and also proud of his adopted [[Scotland]]. He worked until a few weeks before his death at the age of 93. He was buried in [[Jerusalem]].

He was made a Freeman of the City of Glasgow in 1981. In that same year, Gordon Wright published his autobiography, ''Bronze in My Blood''.

== Work ==
During his career, Schotz produced several hundred portraits and compositions including figure compositions, religious sculptures, semi-abstracts and modelled portraits. His bust of [[James Maxton]] is on public display at the Maxton remembrance garden in [[Barrhead]] near [[Paisley (Scotland)|Paisley]]. Other publicly accessible work includes:
* ''Memorial to Provost [[John Jarvie]] of [[Kilsyth]]'', first freeman of the burgh, commissioned in 1954 is a portrait in relief and can be seen in John Jarvie Square, off East Burnside Street, [[Kilsyth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.kilsyth.org.uk/landmarks.htm |title = Kilsyth Today |website = Kilsyth Community Council |accessdate = 7 January 2014 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140107235410/http://www.kilsyth.org.uk/landmarks.htm |archivedate = 7 January 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Psalmist'' (1974) in the [[JT Honeyman]] Memorial Garden of [[Kelvingrove Park]],

* the ''Painting'' and ''Sculpture'' reliefs on the [[Mercat Building]] (1928–29) and
* the [[Stations of the Cross]] sculptures in [[Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia|St. Charles' Parish Church]] [[North Kelvinside]].

* a bust of William Boyd's daughter Joan at The McManus: Dundee's Art Gallery &amp; Museum
* bust of [[Keir Hardie]], [[People's Palace, Glasgow]]

The majority of these works were all in Glasgow and the surrounding area. He was responsible for the repair on the bridge sculpture at Kelvingrove Park beside the now refurbished art gallery and museum.

Although Benno Schotz is frequently referred to as an Estonian sculptor, all his professional life was in Scotland. He became a naturalised British subject in 1930.
He became a full member of the Royal Scottish Academy, 1937. He headed the Sculpture and Ceramics dept. of the Glasgow School of Art from 1938 until his retirement in 1960. His active life as a sculptor continued thereafter with renewed vigor and he created his most ambitious and monumental works over the next 20 years. 
In 1963, he was appointed The Sculptor in Ordinary for Scotland, a member of the Royal household. 
A major retrospective exhibition of his works (1971) was held at the Royal Scottish Academy, Edinburgh.
His interest in the drawing of trees developed, the drawings becoming more and more complex and abstract. He mounted a successful exhibition of Sculptures and Related Drawings in Glasgow (1961). His last sculpture was executed less than six weeks before his death, aged 93.
He was Life-President of the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts.
Honors include: Freedom of the City of Glasgow; Honorary Fellow of The Hebrew University; Honorary LL.D, Strathclyde University; Honorary Member of the British Society of British Sculptors; Honorary Member of the Royal Institute of Architects in Scotland.

==Books==
Schotz wrote at least one book: "Bronze is in my Blood",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstraven.com/sstowell/Family/Bob.html&lt;/ref&gt; a memoir of his life.

The [[Episcopal see]] was created by the union of the ancient bishoprics of [[Bishop of Argyll|Argyll]] and [[Bishop of the Isles|The Isles]] in 1847. The bishop has two [[cathedra|seats]]: the [[St John's Cathedral, Oban|Cathedral Church of St John the Divine]] in [[Oban]] and the [[Cathedral of The Isles|Cathedral of The Isles and Collegiate Church of the Holy Spirit]] in [[Millport, Isle of Cumbrae]], which is the smallest cathedral in the British Isles.

'''Catholicity''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|καθολικότητα της εκκλησίας}}, "catholicity of the church"){{sfn|Μαρτζέλος|2009|p=103-120}} or '''catholicism''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|καθολικισμός}}, "universal doctrine") is a concept that encompasses the beliefs and practices of numerous [[Christian denomination]]s, most notably those that describe themselves as ''Catholic'' in accordance with the [[Four Marks of the Church]], as expressed in the [[Nicene Creed]] of the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381: "''[I believe] in one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church''."

While ''catholicism'' is most commonly associated with the faith and practices of the [[Catholic Church]] led by the [[Pope]] in [[Holy See|Rome]],&lt;ref&gt;McBrien, ''Catholicism'', pp. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt; the traits of catholicity, and thus the term ''catholic'', are also claimed and possessed by other denominations such as the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Oriental Orthodox Church]], the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. It also occurs in [[Lutheranism]], [[Anglicanism]], as well as [[Independent Catholicism]] and other [[Christian denomination]]s. While traits used to define catholicity, as well as recognition of these traits in other denominations, vary among these groups, such attributes include formal [[sacrament]]s, an [[episcopal polity]], [[apostolic succession]], highly structured [[Christian liturgy|liturgical worship]], and other shared [[Ecclesiology]]. The Catholic Church is also known as the Roman Catholic Church; the term ''[[Roman Catholic (term)|Roman Catholic]]'' is used especially in ecumenical contexts and in countries where other churches use the term ''Catholic'', to distinguish it from broader meanings of the term.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [http://www.gallowaydiocese.org.uk/ The Roman Catholic Diocese of Galloway] diocesan website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/meth-council-docs/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_19670801_methodist-catholic-dialogue_en.html The Roman Catholic Church and the World Methodist Council], report from the [[Holy See]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[Protestant]] and related traditions, ''catholic'' is used in the sense of indicating a self-understanding of continuity of continuity of faith and practice from [[Early Christianity]] as delineated in the Nicene Creed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/2008/september/what-do-protestant-churches-mean-when-they-recite-i.html|title=What do Protestant churches mean when they recite "I believe in the holy catholic church" and "the communion of saints" in the Apostles' Creed?|last=George|first=Timothy|date=18 September 2008|publisher=[[Christianity Today]]|language=English|accessdate=16 June 2016|quote=The Protestant reformers understood themselves to be a part of "the holy catholic church."Millions of Protestants still repeat these words every week as they stand in worship to recite the Apostles' Creed.The word catholic was first used in this sense in the early second century when Ignatius of Antioch declared, "Where Jesus Christ is, there is the catholic church." Jesus Christ is the head of the church, as well as its Lord. Protestant believers in the tradition of the Reformation understand the church to be the body of Christ extended throughout time as well as space, the whole company of God's redeemed people through the ages.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among [[Methodist]],&lt;ref name="AbrahamKirby2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abraham|first1=William J.|last2=Kirby|first2=James E.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Methodist Studies|date=24 September 2009|publisher=OUP Oxford|language=English|isbn=9780191607431|page=401|quote=Acknowledging the considerable agreement between Anglicans and Methodists concerning faith and doctrine, and believing there to be sufficient convergence in understanding ministry and mission, ''Sharing in the Apostolic Communion'' (Anglican-Methodist Dialogue 1996) invited the WMC and the Lambeth Conference to recognize and affirm that: Both Anglicans and Methodists belong to the one, holy, catholic and apostolic church of Jesus Christ and participate in the apostolic mission of the whole people of God; in the churches of our two communions the word of God is authentically preached and the sacraments instituted of Christ are duly administered; Our churches share in common confession and heritage of the apostolic faith' (§95).}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lutheran]],&lt;ref name="Gassmann"/&gt;  [[Moravian Church|Moravian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moravian.org/the-moravian-magazine/april-may-2016/studying-moravian-doctrine-ground-of-the-unity-part-ii/|title=Studying Moravian Doctrine: Ground of the Unity, Part II|year=2005|publisher=[[Moravian Church]]|language=English|accessdate=16 June 2016|quote=The Moravian Church does not have a different understanding of God than other churches, but stresses what we have in common with all of the world's Christians.

The Church catholic is also the Church apostolic—which is to say, it is the Church which "stands firm and holds to the traditions" which have been taught through the words of the Apostles (2 Thessalonians 2:15). And this teaching—which is truly the Word of God (2 Timothy 3:16, 2 Peter 1:19-21)—has been passed on to us today in its fullness through the Scriptures. To be catholic, then, is to be heirs of the apostolic faith. It is to be rooted firmly in the Apostle's teaching as recorded for us in Scripture, the unchanging Word of God. But while this Word is unchanging, it does not follow that it is static. The history of the Church in the world is the history of Christians meditating upon Scripture. We must look to this history as our own guide in understanding Scripture. To be sure, the Church's tradition of interpretation has erred from time to time—we find, for example, that the Fathers and Councils sometimes disagree with one another—but it is dangerous to discount those interpretations of Scripture which have been held unanimously from the very beginning of the Church.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These denominations consider themselves to be catholic, teaching that the term "designates the historic, [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] mainstream of Christianity whose doctrine was defined by the [[ecumenical council]]s and [[ecumenical creeds|creeds]]" and as such, most [[Protestant Reformers|Reformers]] "appealed to this catholic tradition and believed they were in continuity with it."&lt;ref name="Gassmann"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gassmann|first=Günther|title=Fortress Introduction to the Lutheran Confessions|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=9781451418194|page=204|quote=Uncapitalized, it designates the historic, orthodox mainstream of Christianity whose doctrine was defined by the ecumenical councils and creeds. Most reformers, not just Lutherans, appealed to this catholic tradition and believed they were in continuity with it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"catholicity" and "catholicism" are used in two basic forms, with capital "C" or just with small "c". When used with small "c", terms "catholicity" and "catholicism on the personal views and theological positions of any particular author.

[[File:BranchesofChristianity.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|Timeline of the evolution of the ''catholic'' church, beginning with [[early Christianity]]]]
A common belief related to catholicity is institutional continuity with the early Christian church founded by Jesus Christ. Many churches or communions of churches identify singularly or collectively as the authentic church. The following summarizes the major schisms and conflicts within Christianity, particularly within groups that identify as Catholic; there are several competing historical interpretations as to which groups entered into [[schism (religion)|schism]] with the original early church.

According to the theory of [[Pentarchy]], the early undivided church came to be organized under the three patriarchs of  [[patriarch of Rome|Rome]], [[patriarch of Alexandria|Alexandria]] and [[patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]], to which later were added the patriarchs of [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]] and [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]. The [[Bishop of Rome]] was at that time recognized as first among them, as is stated, for instance, in canon 3 of the [[First Council of Constantinople]] (381)—many interpret "first" as meaning here [[first among equals]]—and doctrinal or procedural disputes were often referred to Rome, as when, on appeal by [[Athanasius]] against the decision of the [[First Synod of Tyre|Council of Tyre (335)]], [[Pope Julius I]], who spoke of such appeals as customary, annulled the action of that council and restored Athanasius and [[Marcellus of Ancyra]] to their sees.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Pope St. Julius I|Catholic Encyclopedia, ''Pope St. Julius I'']]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bishop of Rome was also considered to have the right to convene ecumenical councils. When the Imperial capital moved to Constantinople, Rome's influence was sometimes challenged. Nonetheless, Rome claimed special authority because of its connection to [[Saint Peter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Radeck|first=Francisco|author2=Dominic Radecki|title=Tumultuous Times|publisher=St. Joseph's Media|year=2004|isbn=978-0-9715061-0-7|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P2A.HTM#RC|title=The Hierarchical Constitution of the Church - 880-881|publisher=The Vatican|accessdate=21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]], who, all agreed, were martyred and buried in Rome, and because the Bishop of Rome saw himself as the successor of Saint Peter.

The 431 [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], the third [[ecumenical council]], was chiefly concerned with [[Nestorianism]], which emphasized the distinction between the humanity and divinity of Jesus and taught that, in giving birth to Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary could not be spoken of as giving birth to God. This Council rejected Nestorianism and affirmed that, as humanity and divinity are inseparable in the one person of Jesus Christ, his mother, the Virgin Mary, is thus [[Theotokos]], God-bearer, Mother of God. The first great rupture in the Church followed this Council. Those who refused to accept the Council's ruling were largely [[Persia]]n and are represented today by the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and related Churches, which, however, do not now hold a "Nestorian" theology. They are often called Ancient Oriental Churches.

The next major break was after the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451). This Council repudiated [[Monophysitism|Eutychian Monophysitism]] which stated that the divine nature completely subsumed the human nature in Christ. This Council declared that Christ, though one person, exhibited two natures "without confusion, without change, without division, without separation" and thus is both fully God and fully human. The Alexandrian Church rejected the terms adopted by this Council, and the Christian Churches that follow the tradition of non-acceptance of the Council—they are not Monophysite in doctrine—are referred to as Pre-Chalcedonian or [[Oriental Orthodoxy#Oriental Orthodox Communion|Oriental Orthodox]] Churches.

The next great rift within Christianity was in the 11th century. Longstanding doctrinal disputes, as well as conflicts between methods of Church government, and the evolution of separate rites and practices, precipitated a split in 1054 that divided the Church, this time between a "West" and an "East". [[Spain]], [[England]], [[France]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Poland]], [[Bohemia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Scandinavia]], the [[Baltic states]], and Western Europe in general were in the Western camp, and [[Greece]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]] and many other Slavic lands, [[Anatolia]], and the Christians in [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]] who accepted the Council of Chalcedon made up the Eastern camp. This division between the [[Western Church]] and the [[Eastern Church]] is called the [[East–West Schism]].

In 1438, the [[Council of Florence]] convened, which featured a strong dialogue focussed on understanding the theological differences between the East and West, with the hope of reuniting the Catholic and Orthodox churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Constantinople and the West|last=Geanakoplos|first=Deno John|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, WI|isbn=0299118800 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several eastern churches reunited, constituting some of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]].&lt;!--from Catholic Church 13 Jan 2015--&gt;

Another major division in the Church occurred in the 16th century with the [[Protestant Reformation]], after which many parts of the [[Western Church]] rejected Papal authority, and some of the teachings of the Western Church at that time, and became known as "[[Reformed]]" or "[[Protestantism|Protestant]]".

A much less extensive rupture occurred when, after the Roman Catholic Church's [[First Vatican Council]], in which it officially proclaimed the dogma of [[papal infallibility]], small clusters of Catholics in the Netherlands and in German-speaking countries formed the [[Old Catholic Church|Old-Catholic (Altkatholische) Church]].

Use of the terms "catholicity" and "catholicism" depends on context. For times preceding the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]], it refers to the [[Nicene Creed]] and especially to tenets of [[Christology]], i.e. the rejection of [[Arianism]].
For times after the Great Schism, Catholicism (with the capital C) in the sense of the [[Catholic Church]], combines the [[Latin liturgical rites|Latin Church]], the Eastern Catholic Churches of [[Byzantine Rite|Greek tradition]], and the other Eastern Catholic Churches. 
Liturgical and canonical practices vary between all these [[particular Church]]es constituting the Roman and Eastern Catholic Churches (or, as Richard McBrien calls them, the "Communion of Catholic Churches").&lt;ref&gt;Mc Brien, ''The Church'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
Contrast this with the term [[Catholicos]] (but not ''Catholicism'') in reference to the head of a [[Particular Church]] in [[Eastern Christianity]].

In the [[Catholic Church]], the term "catholic" is understood as to cover those who are baptized and in communion with the Pope.

Other Christians use it in an intermediate sense, neither just those Christians in communion with Rome, but more narrow than all Christians who recite the Creeds.  They use it to distinguish their position from a Calvinistic or Puritan form of [[Protestantism]]. It is then meaningful to attempt to draw up a list of common characteristic beliefs and practices of this definition of catholicity:

* Direct and continuous organizational descent from the one Church founded by Jesus{{bibleref2c|Matthew|16:18}}
* Belief that Jesus Christ is Divine, a doctrine officially clarified in the [[First Council of Nicaea]] and expressed in the [[Nicene Creed]].

* Belief that the Church is the vessel and deposit of the fullness of the teachings of Jesus and the Apostles from which the Scriptures were formed. This teaching is preserved in both written scripture and in unwritten tradition, neither being independent of the other.

[[File:Battesimi0113.jpg|thumb|right|upright|An [[Italy|Italian]] priest during the sacrament of [[Baptism]]]]
Churches in the Catholic tradition administer seven [[sacrament]]s or "sacred mysteries": [[Baptism]], [[Confirmation]] or [[Chrismation]], [[Eucharist]], [[Penance#Sacramental penance|Penance]], also known as Reconciliation, [[Anointing of the Sick]], [[Holy Orders]], and [[Christian views on marriage|Matrimony]]. In some Catholic churches this number is regarded as a convention only.

In churches that consider themselves catholic, a sacrament is considered to be an efficacious visible sign of God's invisible [[Divine grace|grace]]. While the word ''mystery'' is used not only of these [[rite]]s, but also with other meanings with reference to revelations of and about God and to God's mystical interaction with creation, the word ''[[sacrament]]'' (Latin: ''a solemn pledge''), the usual term in the West, refers specifically to these rites.

* [[Baptism]] - the first sacrament of Christian initiation, the basis for all the other sacraments. Churches in the Catholic tradition consider baptism conferred in most Christian denominations "in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit" (cf. {{bibleref|Matthew|28:19}}) to be valid, since the effect is produced through the sacrament, independently of the faith of the minister, though not of the minister's intention. This is not necessarily the case in other churches. As stated in the [[Nicene Creed]], Baptism is "for the forgiveness of sins", not only personal sins, but also of [[original sin]], which it remits even in infants who have committed no actual sins. Expressed positively, forgiveness of sins means bestowal of the sanctifying grace by which the baptized person shares the life of God. The initiate "puts on Christ" (Galatians 3:27), and is "buried with him in baptism ... also raised with him through faith in the working of God" (Colossians 2:12).
* [[Confirmation]] or [[Chrismation]] - the second sacrament of Christian initiation, the means by which the gift of the Holy Spirit conferred in baptism is "strengthened and deepened" (see, for example, ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a2.htm §1303]) by a sealing. In the Western tradition it is usually a separate rite from baptism, bestowed, following a period of education called [[catechism|catechesis]], on those who have at least reached the [[age of reason (canon law)|age of discretion]] (about 7)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P32.HTM |title=Code of Canon Law, canon 891 |publisher=Intratext.com |date=2007-05-04 |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes postponed until an age when the person is considered capable of making a mature independent profession of faith. It is considered to be of a nature distinct from the anointing with [[chrism]] (also called myrrh) that is usually part of the rite of baptism and that is not seen as a separate sacrament. In the Eastern tradition it is usually conferred in conjunction with baptism, as its completion, but is sometimes administered separately to converts or those who return to Orthodoxy. Some theologies consider this to be the outward sign of the inner "Baptism of the Holy Spirit", the special gifts (or ''charismata'') of which may remain latent or become manifest over time according to God's will. Its "originating" minister is a validly consecrated bishop; if a priest (a "presbyter") confers the sacrament (as is permitted in some Catholic churches) the link with the higher order is indicated by the use of chrism blessed by a bishop. (In an [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], this is customarily, although not necessarily, done by the primate of the local [[autocephalous]] church.)
* [[Eucharist]] - the sacrament (the third of Christian initiation) by which the faithful receive their ultimate "daily bread", or "bread for the journey", by partaking of and in the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ and being participants in Christ's one eternal sacrifice. The bread and wine used in the rite are, according to Catholic faith, in the mystical action of the Holy Spirit, transformed to be Christ's Body and Blood—his [[Real Presence]]. This transformation is interpreted by some as [[transubstantiation]] or [[metousiosis]], by others as [[consubstantiation]] or [[sacramental union]].
* [[Penance]] (also called [[Confession (religion)|Confession]] and Reconciliation) - the first of the two sacraments of healing. It is also called the sacrament of conversion, of forgiveness, and of absolution. It is the sacrament of spiritual healing of a baptized person from the distancing from God involved in actual sins committed. It involves the penitent's contrition for sin (without which the rite does not have its effect), confession (which in highly exceptional circumstances can take the form of a corporate general confession) to a minister who has the faculty to exercise the power to absolve the penitent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3F.HTM|title=Chapter II : The Minister of the Sacrament of Penance |publisher=IntraText|accessdate=21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and absolution by the minister. In some traditions (such as the Roman Catholic), the rite involves a fourth element – satisfaction – which is defined as signs of repentance imposed by the minister. In early Christian centuries, the fourth element was quite onerous and generally preceded absolution, but now it usually involves a simple task (in some traditions called a "penance") for the penitent to perform, to make some reparation and as a medicinal means of strengthening against further sinning.
* [[Anointing of the Sick]] (or Unction) - the second sacrament of healing. In it those who are suffering an illness are anointed by a priest with oil consecrated by a bishop specifically for that purpose. In past centuries, when such a restrictive interpretation was customary, the sacrament came to be known as "Extreme Unction", i.e. "Final Anointing", as it still is among [[traditionalist Catholic]]s. It was then conferred only as one of the "Last Rites". The other "Last Rites" are Penance (if the dying person is physically unable to confess, at least absolution, conditional on the existence of contrition, is given), and the Eucharist, which, when administered to the dying, is known as "Viaticum", a word whose original meaning in Latin was "provision for a journey".
* [[Holy Orders]] - the sacrament which integrates someone into the Holy Orders of bishops, priests (presbyters), and deacons, the threefold order of "administrators of the mysteries of God" (1 Corinthians 4:1), giving the person the mission to teach, sanctify, and govern. Only a bishop may administer this sacrament, as only a bishop holds the fullness of the Apostolic Ministry. Ordination as a bishop makes one a member of the body that has succeeded to that of the Apostles. Ordination as a priest configures a person to Christ the Head of the Church and the one essential Priest, empowering that person, as the bishops' assistant and vicar, to preside at the celebration of divine worship, and in particular to confect the sacrament of the Eucharist, acting "in persona Christi" (in the person of Christ). Ordination as a deacon configures the person to Christ the Servant of All, placing the deacon at the service of the Church, especially in the fields of the ministry of the Word, service in divine worship, pastoral guidance and charity. Deacons may later be further ordained to the priesthood, but only if they do not have a wife. In some traditions (such as those of the Roman Catholic Church), while married men may be ordained, ordained men may not marry. In others (such as the Anglican-Catholic Church), [[clerical marriage]] is permitted.&lt;ref&gt;In regard to the ordination of women to the episcopacy, one cannot underestimate the chasm that is currently developing between the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental and Roman Catholic churches, on the one hand, and the Lutheran, Anglican and Independent Catholic churches, on the other hand. Cardinal Walter Kasper, President of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, for example, noted this when he addressed some Anglican bishops in 2006. Quoting St Cyprian of Carthage (d. 258), he said the episcopate is one, which means that "each part of it is held by each one for the whole"; that bishops were instruments of unity not only within the contemporary Church, but also across time, within the universal Church. This being the case, he continued, "the decision for the ordination of women to the Episcopal office ... must not in any way involve a conflict between the majority and the minority." Such a decision should be made "with the consensus of the ancient Churches of the East and West." To do otherwise "would spell the end" to any kind of unity. James Roberts, "Women bishops 'would spell the end of unity hopes'" in ''[[The Tablet]]'', 10 June 2006, 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, some sectors of Anglicanism "in isolation of the whole" have approved the [[Ordination of LGBT Christian clergy|ordination of openly active homosexuals]] to the priesthood and episcopacy, in spite of the support that Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, spoke for Anglican teaching on homosexuality, which he said the church "could not change simply because of a shift in society's attitude", noting also that those churches blessing same-sex unions and consecrating openingly gay bishops would not be able "to take part as a whole in ecumenical and interfaith dialogue." Thus in ecumenical matters, only if the Roman Catholic as well as Orthodox churches come to an understanding with first tier or primary bishops of the Anglican Communion can those churches (representing 95% of global Catholicism) implement an agreement with second tier or secondary Anglican bishops and their respective Anglican communities.&lt;ref&gt;"Rowan Williams predicts schism over homosexuality" (''The Tablet'' 1 August 2009, 33).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Russian Orthodox Church]], which because of the episcopal ordination of [[Gene Robinson]] severed its dialogue with the United States Episcopal Church, while declaring itself open to "contacts and cooperation with those American Episcopalians who remain faithful to the gospel's moral teaching", stated that it was willing to restore relations with those Episcopal dioceses that refused to recognize the election of [[Katharine Jefferts Schori]] as their Church's presiding bishop ([http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=documents&amp;div=89 Letter of Metropolitan Kirill of Smolensk and Kaliningrad)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stan Chu Ilo, "An African view on ordaining Gene Robinson", ''The National Catholic Reporter'', 12 December 2003, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Moore, "Archbishop of Canterbury foresees a 'two-tier' church to avoid gay schism", ''The Telegraph.co.uk'', 27 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Christian views on marriage|Holy Matrimony]] (or Marriage) - is the sacrament of joining a man and a woman (according to the churches' doctrines) for mutual help and love (the unitive purpose), consecrating them for their particular mission of building up the Church and the world, and providing grace for accomplishing that mission. Western tradition sees the sacrament as conferred by the canonically expressed mutual consent of the partners in marriage; Eastern and some recent Western theologians not in communion with the see of Rome view the blessing by a priest as constituting the sacramental action.

&lt;!--"Catholicism" (*-ism*) is not equivalent with the adjective "catholic"--&gt;
{{main|Catholic (term)}}
Many individual Christians and [[Christian denomination]]s consider themselves "catholic" on the basis, in particular, of [[apostolic succession]]. They may be described as falling into five groups:
# The [[Catholic Church]], also known as the Roman Catholic Church, which sees [[full communion]] with the [[Bishop of Rome]] as an essential element of Catholicism. Its constituent [[particular church]]es, [[Latin Church]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], have distinct and separate jurisdictions, while still being "in union with Rome".&lt;ref&gt;Richard McBrien, ''Catholicism'' (Minneapolis: Winston Press, 1981), 680.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Those, like adherents of [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Church]] and the [[Church of the East]], that claim unbroken apostolic succession from the early church and identify themselves as ''the'' Catholic Church. 
# Those, such as the [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholic]], [[Anglican]] and some [[Lutheran]] and other denominations, that claim unbroken apostolic succession from the early church and see themselves as a constituent part of the church.{{refn|group=note|[[Old Catholic]], [[Anglican]], and [[Lutheran]] movements all have historical ties to the Catholic Church; however, the Catholic Church has judged the [[Holy Orders|succession]] of Anglican and Lutheran ordinations to be invalid, while giving limited recognition to the validity of the sacraments of some branches of the Old Catholic movement.{{refn|name=zenit_OC_PNC_2012|{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/liturgy/zlitur395.htm|title=The Old Catholic and Polish National Churches|publisher=Zenit|location=Rome|date=14 Feb 2012|author=Father Edward McNamara, Legionary of Christ|accessdate=4 Jan 2015}}|}}  For further information, see [[Catholic Church and ecumenism]].|}}
# Those who claim to be spiritual descendants of the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] but have no discernible institutional descent from the historic church and normally do not refer to themselves as catholic.
# Those who have acknowledged a break in apostolic succession, but have restored it in order to be in [[full communion]] with bodies that have maintained the practice. Examples in this category include the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]] ''vis-à-vis'' their Anglican and Old Catholic counterparts.

For some confessions listed under category 3, the self-affirmation refers to the belief in the ultimate unity of the universal church under one God and one [[soteriology|Savior]], rather than in one visibly unified institution (as with category 1, above). In this usage, "catholic" is sometimes written with a lower-case "c". The Western [[Apostles' Creed]] and the [[Nicene Creed]], stating "I believe in ... one holy catholic ... church", are recited in worship services. Among some denominations in category 3, "Christian" is substituted for "catholic" in order to denote the doctrine that the Christian Church is, at least ideally, undivided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=3355 |title=Apostles' Creed |publisher=The Lutheran Church--Missouri Synod |accessdate=21 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310021305/http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=3355 |archivedate=10 March 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?2617&amp;collectionID=711&amp;contentID=4334&amp;shortcutID=2077#nicene|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080102005622/http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?2617&amp;collectionID=711&amp;contentID=4334&amp;shortcutID=2077#nicene|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2 January 2008|title=Nicene Creed|publisher=Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod|accessdate=21 November 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilflutheran.org/page11.html |title=Texts of the Three Chief Symbols are taken from the Book of Concord, Tappert edition |publisher=The International Lutheran Fellowship |accessdate=21 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928110643/http://www.ilflutheran.org/page11.html |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protestant Churches each have their own distinctive theological and ecclesiological notions of catholicity.{{sfn|Braaten|Jenson|1996|p=}}{{sfn|Stewart|2015|p=}}

===Catholic Church===
{{Main article|Catholic Church|Latin Church|Eastern Catholic Churches}}
In its ''Letter on Some Aspects of the Church Understood as Communion'', the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] stressed that the idea of the universal church as a communion of churches must not be presented as meaning that "every [[particular Church]] is a subject complete in itself, and that the universal church is the result of a ''reciprocal recognition'' on the part of the particular Churches". It insisted that "the universal Church cannot be conceived as the sum of the particular Churches, or as a federation of particular Churches".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_28051992_communionis-notio_en.html|title=SOME ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH UNDERSTOOD AS COMMUNION|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]] considers only those in full communion with the Holy See in Rome as Catholics. While recognising the valid episcopates and Eucharist of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in most cases, it does not consider Protestant denominations such as Lutheran ones to be genuine churches and so uses the term "ecclesial communities" to refer to them. Because the Catholic Church does not consider these denominations to have valid episcopal orders capable of celebrating a valid Eucharist, it is does not classify them as churches "in the proper sense".&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=Jeaneane D.|title=World Religions|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|year=1997|isbn=978-1-898723-48-6|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The ecclesial communities which have not preserved the valid Episcopate and the genuine and integral substance of the Eucharistic mystery are not Churches in the proper sense; however, those who are baptized in these communities are, by Baptism, incorporated in Christ and thus are in a certain communion, albeit imperfect, with the Church" ([http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20000806_dominus-iesus_en.html [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], Declaration ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'',] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411015820/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20000806_dominus-iesus_en.html |date=11 April 2013 }} 17).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"(The expression ''[[Sister Churches (ecclesiology)|sister Churches]]'') has been applied improperly by some to the relationship between the Catholic Church on the one hand, and the Anglican Communion and non-catholic ecclesial communities on the other. ... it must also be borne in mind that the expression ''sister Churches'' in the proper sense, as attested by the common Tradition of East and West, may only be used for those ecclesial communities that have preserved a valid episcopate and Eucharist" ([http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20000630_chiese-sorelle_en.html Note on the expression "sister Churches"] issued by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith on 30 June 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church's doctrine of infallibility derives from the belief that the authority Jesus gave Peter as head of the church on earth has been passed on to his successors, the popes. Relevant Bible verses include {{bibleref2c|Matthew|16:18}}; "And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."

"...it is not a matter of either/or—either one is in communion with the Bishop of Rome, or one is not.

These particular churches or component parts are the [[Latin Church]] (which uses a number of different [[Latin liturgical rites|liturgical rites]], of which the [[Roman Rite]] is by far prevalent) and the 23 [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. Of the latter particular churches, 14 use the [[Byzantine Rite]] for their liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'', 2012 edition, pages 1140–1141 ({{ISBN|978-88-209-8722-0}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Within the universal Church, each "particular church", whether Eastern or Western, is of equal dignity.&lt;ref&gt;''Orientalium Ecclesiarum'', 3&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in its official documents, the Catholic Church, though made up of several particular churches, "continues to refer to itself as the 'Catholic Church{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;Thomas P. Rausch, S.J., ''Catholicism in the Third Millennium'' (Collegeville: The Liturgical Press), xii.&lt;/ref&gt; or, less frequently but consistently, as the 'Roman Catholic Church', owing to its essential&lt;ref name=Advanced/&gt; link with the Bishop of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html his encyclical ''Humani Generis''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419021937/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |date=19 April 2012 }}, 27-28 [[Pope Pius XII]] decried the error of those who denied that they were bound by "the doctrine, explained in Our Encyclical Letter of a few years ago, and based on the Sources of Revelation, which teaches that the Mystical Body of Christ and the Roman Catholic Church are one and the same thing"; and in [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_31121929_divini-illius-magistri_en.html his ''Divini Illius Magistri''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923233927/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_31121929_divini-illius-magistri_en.html |date=23 September 2010 }} Pope Pius XI wrote: "In the City of God, the Holy Roman Catholic Church, a good citizen and an upright man are absolutely one and the same thing." On other occasions too, both when signing agreements with other Churches (e.g. [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/anc-orient-ch-docs/rc_pc_christuni_doc_19711025_syrian-church_en.html that with Patriarch Mar Ignatius Yacoub III of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]]) and in giving talks to various groups (e.g. [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2006/may/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20060525_incontro-ecumenico_en.html Benedict XVI in Warsaw]), the Popes refer to the Church that they head as the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;/ref&gt;

McBrien, in his book ''Catholicism'', disagrees with the synonymous use of "Catholic" and "Roman Catholic": &lt;blockquote&gt;But is 'Catholic' synonymous with 'Roman Catholic'? And is it accurate to refer to the Roman Catholic Church as simply the 'Roman Church'? The answer to both questions is no. The adjective 'Roman' applies more properly to the diocese, or see, of Rome than to the worldwide Communion of Catholic Churches that is in union with the Bishop of Rome. Indeed, it strikes some Catholics as contradictory to call the Church 'Catholic' and 'Roman' at one and the same time. Eastern-rite Catholics, of whom there are more than twenty million, also find the adjective 'Roman' objectionable. In addition to the Latin, or Roman, tradition, there are seven non-Latin, non-Roman ecclesial traditions: Armenian, Byzantine, Coptic, Ethiopian, East Syriac (Chaldean), West Syriac, and Maronite. Each to the Churches with these non-Latin traditions is as Catholic as the Roman Catholic Church. Thus, not all Catholics are Roman Catholic... [T]o be Catholic—whether Roman or non-Roman—in the ecclesiological sense is to be in full communion with the Bishop of Rome and as such to be an integral part of the Catholic Communion of Churches.&lt;ref&gt;Richard McBrien, ''The Church'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
McBrien says that, on an official level, what he calls the "Communion of Catholic Churches" always refers to itself as "The Catholic Church".&lt;ref&gt;McBrien, ''The Church'', 351-371&lt;/ref&gt; However, counter examples such as seen above of the term "Roman Catholic Church" being used by popes and departments of the Holy See exist. The Latin-rite Archdiocese of Detroit, for example, lists eight Eastern Catholic churches, each with its own bishop, as having one or more parishes in what is also the territory of the Latin archdiocese, yet each is designated as being in "full communion with the Roman Church".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aodonline.org/AODOnline/Parish+Information+6911/Parish+Locator+7701/ParishLocator.asp?ParishLocatorPageType=EasternRite |title=Archdiocese of Detroit listing of Eastern Churches |publisher=Aodonline.org |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=May 2016}}

===Eastern Orthodox Church===
{{main article|Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox – Roman Catholic theological differences|Eastern Orthodox – Roman Catholic ecclesiastical differences}}
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] maintains the position that it is their communion which actually constitutes the [[Four Marks of the Church|One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church]].{{sfn|Meyendorff|1966|p=}}{{sfn|Meyendorff|1983|p=}} Eastern Orthodox Christians consider themselves the heirs of the first-millennium [[patriarchate|patriarchal]] structure that developed in the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Church]] into the model of the [[pentarchy]], recognized by [[Seven Ecumenical Councils|Ecumenical Councils]], a theory that "continues to hold sway in official Greek circles to the present day".&lt;ref&gt;''The A to Z of the Orthodox Church'', p. 259, by Michael Prokurat, Michael D. Peterson, Alexander Golitzin, published by Scarecrow Press in 2010 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=E0RPOYa77IUC&amp;pg=PA259&amp;dq=orthodox+pentarchy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8ltLVPbmOOiM7Ab6yICQBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=orthodox%20pentarchy&amp;f=false])&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the theological disputes that occurred from the 9th to 11th centuries, culminating in the final split of 1054, the Eastern Orthodox churches have regarded Rome as a schismatic see that has violated the essential catholicity of the Christian faith by introducing innovations of doctrine (see [[Filioque]]). On the other hand, the model of the [[pentarchy]] was never fully applied in the [[Western Christianity|Western Church]], which preferred the theory of the [[Primacy of the Bishop of Rome]], favoring [[Ultramontanism]] over [[Conciliarism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myriobiblos.gr/texts/english/milton1_21.html |author=Milton V.

===Oriental Orthodoxy===
{{main article|Oriental Orthodoxy}}
The [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox churches]] (Coptic, Syriac, Armenian, Ethiopian, Eritrean, Malankaran) also maintain the position that their communion constitutes the [[Four Marks of the Church|One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church]]. In this sense, Oriental Orthodoxy upholds its own ancient [[ecclesiological]] traditions of [[apostolicity]] (apostolic continuity) and catholicity (universality) of the Church.{{sfn|Krikorian|2010|pp=45, 128, 181, 194, 206}}

===Assyrian Church of the East===
{{main article|Assyrian Church of the East|Ancient Church of the East}}
Similar notion of the catholicity was also maintained in the former [[Church of the East]], with its distinctive theological and ecclesiological characteristics and traditions. That notion was inherited by both of its modern secessions: the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] that is part of the [[Catholic Church]], and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] whose full official name is: ''The Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assyrianchurch.org Official site of the Assyrian Church of the East]&lt;/ref&gt; along with its off-shot in turn the [[Ancient Church of the East]] whose full official name is: ''The Holy Apostolic Catholic Ancient Church Of the East''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stzaiacathedral.org.au/about/our-history/ Official pages of the Ancient Church of the East]&lt;/ref&gt; These churches are using the term catholic in their names in the sense of traditional catholicity. They are not in communion with the Catholic Church.

The [[Augsburg Confession]] found within the [[Book of Concord]], a compendium of belief of the [[Lutheran Church]]es, teaches that "the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church".&lt;ref name="Ludwig2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Luther’s Catholic Reformation|last=Ludwig|first=Alan|date=12 September 2016|publisher=The Lutheran Witness|language=English|accessdate=22 February 2017|quote= When the Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession before Emperor Charles V in 1530, they carefully showed that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils and even the canon law of the Church of Rome. They boldly claim, “This is about the Sum of our Doctrine, in which, as can be seen, there is nothing that varies from the Scriptures, or from the Church Catholic, or from the Church of Rome as known from its writers” (AC XXI Conclusion 1). The underlying thesis of the Augsburg Confession is that the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church. In fact, it is actually the Church of Rome that has departed from the ancient faith and practice of the catholic church (see AC XXIII 13, XXVIII 72 and other places).}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1530, they believe to have "showed that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils".&lt;ref name="Ludwig2016"/&gt;

Following the Reformation, Lutheran Churches, such as the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]] and the [[Church of Sweden]], retained apostolic succession, with former Roman Catholic bishops simply becoming Lutheran and continuing to occupy their chairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gassmann|first1=Günther |last2=Larson |first2=Duane Howard|last3=Oldenburg |first3=Mark W. |title=Historical Dictionary of Lutheranism,  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Htz8M1Xlqi4C&amp;pg=PA23 |accessdate=11 November 2012|year=2001|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=0810839458|quote=In addition to the primary understanding of succession, the Lutheran confessions do express openness, however, to the continuation of the succession of bishops.

===Anglicanism===
Introductory works on [[Anglicanism]], such as ''The Study of Anglicanism'', typically refer to the character of the Anglican tradition as "Catholic and Reformed",&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fahlbusch|first=Erwin|author2=Geoffrey William Bromiley|others=David B. Barrett|title=The Encyclopedia of Christianity|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|year=2005|pages=269, 494|isbn=978-0-8028-2416-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is in keeping with the understanding of Anglicanism articulated in the [[Elizabethan Settlement]] of 1559 and in the works of the earliest standard Anglican divines such as [[Richard Hooker]] and [[Lancelot Andrewes]]. Yet different strains in Anglicanism, dating back to the [[English Reformation]], have emphasized either the Reformed, Catholic, or "Reformed Catholic" nature of the tradition.

Anglican theology and ecclesiology has thus come to be typically expressed in three distinct, yet sometimes overlapping manifestations: [[Anglo-Catholicism]] (often called "[[high church]]"), [[Evangelical Anglicanism]] (often called "[[low church]]"), and [[Latitudinarian]]ism ("[[broad church]]"), whose beliefs and practices fall somewhere between the two. Though all elements within the [[Anglican Communion]] recite the same creeds, Evangelical Anglicans generally regard the word ''catholic'' in the ideal sense given above. In contrast, Anglo-Catholics regard the communion as a component of the whole Catholic Church, in spiritual and historical union with the Roman Catholic, Old Catholic and several Eastern churches. Broad Church Anglicans tend to maintain a mediating view, or consider the matter one of ''[[adiaphora]]''. These Anglicans, for example, have agreed in the [[Porvoo Agreement]] to interchangeable ministries and full eucharistic communion with Lutherans.&lt;ref&gt;"Anglican-Lutheran agreement signed", ''The Christian Century'', 13 November 1996, 1005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Two Churches Now Share a Cleric", ''New York Times'', 20 October 1996, 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic nature or strain of the Anglican tradition is expressed doctrinally, ecumenically (chiefly through organizations such as the [[Anglican—Roman Catholic International Commission]]), ecclesiologically (through its [[Episcopal polity|episcopal governance]] and maintenance of the [[historical episcopate]]), and in liturgy and piety. The [[39 Articles]] hold that "there are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that is to say, Baptism and the Supper of the Lord", and that "those five commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation, Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and Extreme Unction, are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel"; some Anglo-Catholics interpret this to mean that there are a total of [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Seven Sacraments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapleanglican.com/?p=293|title=How many Sacraments are there in Anglicanism?|date=7 November 2014|publisher=Maple Anglican|language=English|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Anglo-Catholics practice [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Marian devotion]], recite the [[rosary]] and the [[angelus]], practice [[eucharistic adoration]], and seek the intercession of [[saint]]s. In terms of liturgy, most Anglicans use candles on the altar or communion table and many churches use incense and bells at the Eucharist, which is amongst the most pronounced Anglo-Catholics referred to by the Latin-derived word "Mass" used in the first prayer book and in the American Prayer Book of 1979. In numerous churches the Eucharist is celebrated facing the altar (often with a [[Church tabernacle|tabernacle]]) by a priest assisted by a [[deacon]] and [[subdeacon]]. Anglicans believe in the [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]], though Anglo-Catholics interpret this to mean a corporeal presence, rather than a pneumatic presence. Different Eucharistic rites or orders contain different, if not necessarily contradictory, understandings of salvation. For this reason, no single strain or manifestation of Anglicanism can speak for the whole, even in ecumenical statements (as issued, for example, by the Anglican - Roman Catholic International Commission).&lt;ref&gt;Rowan A. Greer, "Anglicanism as an ongoing argument", ''The Witness'', May 1998, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matt Cresswell, "Anglican conservatives say 'second reformation' is already under way", ''The Tablet'', 28 June 2008, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Jenkins, "Defender of the Faith", ''The Atlantic Monthly'', November 2003, 46-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of Anglo-Catholicism is strongly associated with the [[Oxford Movement]] of the 19th century. Two of its leading lights, [[John Henry Newman]] and [[Henry Edward Manning]], both priests, ended up joining the Roman Catholic Church, becoming [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]]. Others, like [[John Keble]], [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]], and [[Charles Gore]] became influential figures in Anglicanism. The previous [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Rowan Williams]], is a patron of [[Affirming Catholicism]], a more liberal movement within Catholic Anglicanism. Conservative Catholic groups also exist within the tradition, such as [[Forward in Faith]]. There are about 80&amp;nbsp;million Anglicans in the Anglican Communion, comprising 3.6% of global Christianity.&lt;ref name="Barrett"&gt;David Barrett, "Christian World Communities: Five Overviews of Global Christianity, AD 1800–2025", in ''[[International Bulletin of Missionary Research]]'', January 2009, Vol. 33, No 1, pp. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|The Methodist Church claims and cherishes its place in the Holy Catholic Church which is the Body of Christ. It rejoices in the inheritance of the Apostolic Faith and loyally accepts the fundamental principles of the historic creeds and of the Protestant Reformation.

The doctrines of the Evangelical Faith, which Methodism has held from the beginning and still holds, are based upon the divine revelation recorded in the Holy Scriptures. The Methodist Church acknowledges this revelation as the supreme rule of faith and practice. The Methodist Church recognises two sacraments, namely, Baptism and the Lord’s Supper, as of divine appointment and of perpetual obligation, of which it is the privilege and duty of members of the Methodist Church to avail themselves.&lt;ref name="TMCP2000"/&gt;}}
The theologian [[Stanley Hauerwas]] wrote that Methodism "stands centrally in the Catholic tradition" and that "Methodists indeed are even more Catholic than the Anglicans who gave us birth, since Wesley, of blessed memory, held to the Eastern fathers in a more determinative way than did any of the Western churches—Protestant or Catholic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/1990/03/the-importance-of-being-catholic-a-protestant-view|title=The Importance of Being Catholic: A Protestant View|author=[[Stanley Hauerwas]]|year=1990|publisher=[[First Things]]|language=English|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformed===
Within [[Reformed|Reformed Christianity]] the word "catholic" is generally taken in the sense of "universal" and in this sense many leading Protestant denominations identify themselves as part of the catholic church. The puritan [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] adopted in 1646 (which remains the Confession of the [[Church of Scotland]]) states for example that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The catholic or universal Church, which is invisible, consists of the whole number of the elect, that have been, are, or shall be gathered into one, under Christ the Head thereof; and is the spouse, the body, the fulness of Him that fills all in all.&lt;ref&gt;The Westminster Confession of Faith (1646), Article XXV&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[1689 Baptist Confession of Faith|London Confession]] of the Reformed Baptists repeats this with the emendation "which (with respect to the internal work of the Spirit and truth of grace) may be called invisible".&lt;ref&gt;''The London Confession'' (1689), Chapter 26&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of Scotland's [[Articles Declaratory of the Constitution of the Church of Scotland|Articles Declaratory]] begin "The Church of Scotland is part of the Holy Catholic or Universal Church".

In Reformed Churches there is a [[Scottish Church Society|Scoto-Catholic]] grouping within the [[Presbyterian]] [[Church of Scotland]]. Such groups point to their churches' continuing adherence to the "Catholic" doctrine of the early Church Councils. The [[Articles Declaratory of the Constitution of the Church of Scotland]] of 1921 defines that church legally as "part of the Holy Catholic or Universal Church".&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia" /&gt;

===Independent Catholicism===
The [[Old Catholic]]s, the [[Liberal Catholic Church]], the [[Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church|Augustana Catholic Church]], the [[American National Catholic Church]], the [[Apostolic Catholic Church]] (ACC), the Aglipayans ([[Philippine Independent Church]]), the [[African Orthodox Church]], the [[Polish National Catholic Church]] of America, and many [[Independent Catholic churches]], which emerged directly or indirectly from and have beliefs and practices largely similar to [[Latin Rite]] Catholicism, regard themselves as "Catholic" without [[full communion]] with the Bishop of Rome, whose claimed status and authority they generally reject. The [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association]], a division of the [[People's Republic of China]]'s Religious Affairs Bureau exercising state supervision over mainland China's Catholics, holds a similar position, while attempting, as with Buddhism and Protestantism, to indoctrinate and mobilize for Communist Party objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Scott Plummer, "China's Growing Faiths" in ''The Tablet'', March 2007. Based on a review of ''Religious Experience in Contemporary China'' by Kinzhong Yao and Paul Badham (University of Wales Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other views by individual scholars===
[[Richard McBrien]] considers that the term "Catholicism" refers exclusively and specifically to that "Communion of Catholic Churches" in communion with the Bishop of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Richard McBrien, ''The Church: The Evolution of Catholicism'' (New York: HarperOne, 2008), 6, 281-82, and 356.&lt;/ref&gt; According to McBrien, Catholicism is distinguished from other forms of Christianity in its particular understanding and commitment to [[sacred tradition|tradition]], the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]], the mediation between God, [[communion (Christian)|communion]], and the [[See of Rome]].&lt;ref name="McBrien"&gt;{{cite book|last=McBrien|first=Richard P.|title=Catholicism|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1994|pages=3–19|isbn=978-0-06-065405-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bishop [[Kallistos Ware]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] has these things as well, though the [[primacy of the Bishop of Rome|primacy of the See of Rome]] is only [[honorific]], showing non-jurisdictional respect for the [[Bishop of Rome]] as the "[[first among equals]]" and "[[Patriarch]] of the West".&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Ware, ''The Orthodox Church'' (Oxford: Penguin Books, 1993), 214–217.&lt;/ref&gt; Catholicism, according to McBrien's paradigm, includes a [[monasticism|monastic]] life, [[religious institute]]s, a religious appreciation of the arts, a communal understanding of [[Christian views on sin|sin]] and [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]], and [[Christian missionaries|missionary activity]].&lt;ref&gt;In his book, ''Catholicism'', he notes (on page 19) that his book was "written in the midst of yet another major crisis in the history of the Roman Catholic Church...." Never once does he indicate in his book that Catholicism refers to churches not in communion with the See of Rome. McBrien, 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Mills Alden]], in ''[[Harper's New Monthly Magazine]]'', writes that:

{{quote|The various Protestant sects can not constitute one church because they have no [[intercommunion]]...each Protestant Church, whether Methodist or Baptist or whatever, is in perfect communion with itself everywhere as the Roman Catholic; and in this respect, consequently, the Roman Catholic has no advantage or superiority, except in the point of numbers. As a further necessary consequence, it is plain that the Roman Church is no more Catholic in any sense than a Methodist or a Baptist.&lt;ref name="Harper's new monthly magazine, Volume 37, Issues 217-222"&gt;{{cite journal| title = Harper's new monthly magazine |volume=37 |issue=217–222 |quote=The various Protestant sects can not constitute one church because they have no intercommunion...each Protestant Church, whether Methodist or Baptist or whatever, is in perfect communion with itself everywhere as the Roman Catholic; and in this respect, consequently, the Roman Catholic has no advantage or superiority, except in the point of numbers.

As such, according to this viewpoint, "for those who 'belong to the Church', the term Methodist Catholic, or Presbyterian Catholic, or Baptist Catholic, is as proper as the term Roman Catholic."&lt;ref name="Harper's Magazine Co."&gt;{{cite book| title = Harper's magazine, Volume 37|quote=For those who 'belong to the Church,' the term Methodist Catholic, or Presbyterian Catholic, or Baptist Catholic, is as proper as the term Roman Catholic.

'''Daozang''' ({{zh|c=道藏|p=Dàozàng}}; [[Wade-Giles]]: Tao Tsang), meaning "[[Taoism|Taoist]] Canon", consists of around 1,400 texts that were collected c. 400 (after the ''[[Dao De Jing]]'' and ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuang Zi]]'' which are the core Taoist texts).  They were collected by Taoist monks of the period in an attempt to bring together all of the teachings of Taoism, including all the commentaries and expositions of the various masters from the original teachings found in the ''Tao Te Ching'' and ''Zhuangzi''.  It was split into Three Grottoes, which mirrors the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Tripitaka]] (three baskets) division.  These three divisions were based on the main focus of Taoism in Southern China during the time it was made, namely; [[meditation]], [[ritual]], and [[exorcism]].

These Three Grottoes were used as levels for the initiation of Taoist masters, from lowest (exorcism) to highest (meditation).

As well as the Three Grottoes there were Four Supplements that were added to the Canon c. 500.  These were mainly taken from older core Taoist texts (e.g. ''Tao Te Jing'') apart from one which was taken from an already established and separate philosophy known as [[Tianshi Dao]] (Way of the Heavenly Masters).

Although the above can give the appearance that the Canon is highly organized, this is far from the truth.  Although the present-day Canon does preserve the core divisions, there are substantial forks in the arrangement due to the later addition of commentaries, revelations and texts elaborating upon the core divisions.

== Timeline ==
#The First Daozang
#*This was the first time an attempt was made to bring together all the teachings and texts from across China and occurred c. 400 and consisted of roughly 1,200 scrolls
#The Second Daozang
#*In 748 the Tang emperor Tang Xuan-Zong (claimed to be a descendant of [[Laozi]]) sent monks to collect further teachings to add to the Canon.
#The Third Daozang
#*Around 1016 of the Song dynasty, the Daozang was revised and many texts collected during the Tang dynasty were removed. This third Daozang consisted of approximately 4500 scrolls.
#The Fourth Daozang
#*In 1444 of the Ming dynasty, a final version was produced consisting of approximately 5300 scrolls.
Many new Daozang were published.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1610">'''Devla''' (also called, Del) is the name of [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] in the [[Roma people|Roma]] religion. Devla was mistaken with the [[devil]] by the general public when the O Roma tribes arrived in [[Europe]] during the 12th century. Devla is often mentioned in Roma folk songs.

When Romanes is translated into English, the word Devla is usually translated as "God", as shown here in this Romanes language textbook:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ENqAjucuu4MC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;dq=devla+roma&amp;source=web&amp;ots=j-bfQ07JWV&amp;sig=zJB7LzzlNPgWQMbJ5-D-2AQCUSs.|title=Learn Romani: Das-Duma Rromanes|first=Ronald|last=Lee|date=1 August 2005|publisher=Univ of Hertfordshire Press|accessdate=17 September 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roma Catholics also refer to the Catholic God as Devla or Del when they speak [[Roma language|Romanes,]] although these Roma words existed in traditional Roma folk beliefs and in [[Romani language|the Roma language]] centuries before any Roma adopted Christianity.  That is, "Devla" is a common noun meaning a "God" It is based on the Sanskrit word "Deva" which is related to the Latin words "deus" (god) and "divinus" (godly, godlike). "O DEl" or "DEl" is based on the Israelite word "El Elyon" and "ELOI" meaning "God Most High" ("God the highest").


There is a common misconception among many Gadje (non-Roma persons) that Roma worship the devil. The Kalderash word for devil, or Satan, is "Beng".

'''Dhammakaya meditation''' is a method of [[Buddhist meditation]] developed and taught by the Thai meditation teacher [[Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro]] (1885–1959).{{refn|group=note|Some sources state 1884 as year of birth.{{sfn|Fuengfusakul|1998|p=23}}{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=52}}}} In Thailand, it is known as '''vijjā dhammakāya''', which translates as 'knowledge of the body of truth'. It is the meditation tradition that is at the center of the [[Dhammakaya Movement]]. The Dhammakaya meditation method has become very popular in Thailand and other parts of Southeast Asia, and has been described as a revival of ''[[samatha]]'' (tranquility) meditation in Thailand.

The method was discovered by Luang Pu Sodh in the 1910s. Followers of the Dhammakaya Movement believe the method was the same as the original method the Buddha used to attain [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. According to Luang Pu Sodh, the ''[[Dharmakāya#Dhammakaya Movement of Thailand|Dhammakāya]]'', the core concept of the tradition, can be found within every human being. The most important aspect of the meditation method is the focus on the center of the body. As of 2008, there was still scholarly debate as to the origins of Dhammakaya meditation. Scholars refer to the [[Yogavacara]] tradition as a possible source, or that the method might be new or partly new. Dhammakaya meditation is taught at several temples of the movement, and consists of a stage of ''samatha'' (tranquility) and ''vipassana'' (insight), following the structure of the [[Visuddhimagga]], a standard fifth-century [[Theravāda]] guide about meditation. In the method, the stages are described in terms of inner bodies ({{Lang-pi|kāya|italic=yes}}), but also in terms of [[jhana|meditative absorptions]] ({{lang-pi|jhānas|italic=yes}}).

Dhammakaya meditation has been the subject of considerable discussion among Buddhists as to its authenticity and efficacy, and also has been the subject of several scientific studies.

== History ==
=== Background ===
{{main|Buddhist modernism}}
In the 19th and early 20th-century Thailand, public perception of the practice of Buddhism changed. Originally, Thai people saw meditation mostly as a personal and quite esoteric practice. In response to threats of colonial powers, the Thai kings and the reformed [[Dhammayut]] fraternity attempted to modernize Buddhism, and strip Buddhist practice of its ritualized and mystical appearance. In this process, meditation was devalued among monastics as study was more valued.&lt;!--177--&gt; Education in Buddhist doctrine was standardized and centralized, as local meditation lineages gradually died out.&lt;!--212, 227--&gt; Meditation traditions responded by reforming their methods, and referring more to scripture in an attempt to establish orthodoxy and survive.&lt;!--178---&gt; Meditation became less esoteric,&lt;!--212, 219--&gt; as temples were pressured to practice the uniform meditation practice considered orthodox.&lt;!--224-8--&gt;{{sfn|Newell|2008|pp=177–8, 212, 224–8}}

=== Origins ===
Temples that refer to Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro as their teacher have published several biographies about him. According to these biographies, the principles of Dhammakaya meditation were discovered by Luang Pu Sodh at Wat Botbon, in [[Nonthaburi Province]] on a full-moon night of the tenth lunar month, sometime in the 1910s.{{refn|There are differing timelines on when this occurred. Some scholars indicate 1915,{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=389}} others 1916{{sfn|Newell|2008|p=82}} or 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Pichit|last1=Awirutthapanich|first2=Punchai|last2=Pantiya|year=2017|script-title=หลักฐาน ธรรมกายในคัมภีร์พุทธโบราณ ฉบับวิชาการ 1|trans-title=Dhammakaya Evidence in Ancient Buddhist Books, Academic Version 1|journal=Songklanakarin Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities|volume=23|issue=2|url=https://www.tci-thaijo.org/index.php/psujssh/article/view/102062}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} Though he had practised several other forms of meditation in Thailand with well-known meditation teachers, he felt he had not yet accomplished the [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]] which the Buddha had experienced. That night, he decided to take a vow to meditate until he could at least accomplish some part of what the Buddha had once attained. He then experienced what followers consider a breakthrough in meditation.{{sfn|Newell|2008|p=82}}

This breakthrough is described in the biographies as a deeper meaning to the [[Middle Way]], a teaching described in the [[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]], an early Buddhist [[sutra|discourse]]. This deeper meaning involves meditation technique.{{sfn|Dhammakāya Foundation|1996|page=46}}{{sfn|Taylor|2008|p=52}} Essential in this process is the "center of the body", which Luang Por Sodh precisely describes as being at a point two finger widths above the navel of each person: whatever technique someone might use to meditate, the mind can only attain a higher level of insight through this center. This center is also believed to play a fundamental role in the birth and death of an individual.{{sfn|Fuengfusakul|1998|p=84}} According to Luang Pu Sodh, the ''[[Dharmakāya#Dhammakaya Movement of Thailand|Dhammakaya]]'', the core concept of the tradition, can be found within every human being. It has the shape of a Buddha sitting within oneself.{{sfn|Tanabe|2016|p=127}} Followers of the [[Dhammakaya Movement]] believe that the Buddha became enlightened by using this method, and believe that knowledge of the method was lost five hundred years after the Buddha's death.{{sfn|Newell|2008|p=82}}{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|p=76}} Temples of the movement refer to the [[Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta]] or the [[Visuddhimagga]] among others for Dhammakaya meditation's theoretical foundations.&lt;ref name="Schedneck 2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schedneck|first1=Brooke|title=Thailand's International Meditation Centers: Tourism and the Global Commodification of Religious Practices|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1-317-44938-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o5lhCQAAQBAJ|date=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutter 2016"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Hutter|editor-first1=Manfred|editor-last2=Loseries|editor-first2=Andrea|editor-last3=Linder|editor-first3=Julia|editor-last4=Frasch|editor-first4=Tilman|editor-last5=Schicklgruber|editor-first5=Christian|last1=Hutter|first1=Manfred|encyclopedia=Theravāda-Buddhismus und Tibetischer Buddhismus|title=Buddhismus in Thailand und Laos|trans-title=Buddhism in Thailand and Laos|date=2016|publisher=Kohlhammer|isbn=3-17-028499-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=717EDQAAQBAJ|language=de|series=Buddhism|volume=II}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Newell|2008|pp=249–50}}

Since the 2000s, scholars have brought forward new evidence that Luang Pu Sodh's approach may have roots in the Yogavacara tradition (also known as [[tantric Theravada|tantric Theravāda]]; not to be confused with the [[Yogachara|Yogacāra School]] in [[Mahāyāna Buddhism]]).{{sfn|Newell|2008|pages=256–7}}{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=327 n.73}}{{sfn|Crosby|2000|p=160}} During the revival and modernization of Thai Buddhism in the nineteenth and early twentieth century CE, Thai temples in the [[Maha Nikaya|Mahānikāya]] fraternity were forced to adjust to new reforms, including the meditation method used and taught.{{sfn|Newell|2008|p=268}} In particular, leading monks in the Mahanikaya fraternity promoted the New Burmese method of [[U Nārada]] and [[Mahasi Sayadaw]]. The Dhammakaya meditation method managed to survive despite these pressures to reform.{{sfn|Newell|2008|pp=268-70}} Therefore, Dhammakaya and ''Yogavacara'' meditation are both meditation forms that date back before these modernization efforts, and scholars have theorized that the two disciplines may share a common ancestry.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|p=95}} This ancestry would be related to Wat Rajasittharam, the temple where Luang Pu Sodh used to practice before he went on to develop Dhammakaya meditation.{{sfn|Newell|2008|p=263}}{{sfn|Crosby|Skilton|Gunasena|2012|p=178 n.1}} An alternative theory suggests an origin in Tibetan or other forms of Mahāyāna Buddhism,{{sfn|Newell|2008|p=256}}{{sfn|Fuengfusakul|1998|pp=90–1}} but scholars C.S. Newell and Phibul Choompolpaisal believe a Yogavacara origin to be more likely. Newell notes that some aspects of Dhammakaya meditation cannot be found in Yogavacara practices, and theorizes that Dhammakaya meditation could have been "grafted onto an existing, preparatory system of concentration" and further developed.{{sfn|Newell|2008|pp=256–7}}{{sfn|Skilton|Choompolpaisal|2017|page=87 n.10}} Theologian Rory Mackenzie does not draw any conclusions about the matter yet; he states that a Tibetan origin is unlikely, that a Yogavacara origin cannot yet be proven, and it is also "quite possible" that Luang Pu Sodh developed his approach through his own "psychic experiences".{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|pp=113, 224 n.15}}

=== Development to the present day ===
After discovering the method of Dhammakaya meditation, Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro first taught it to others at Wat Bangpla, in [[Nakhon Pathom Province]].{{sfn|Dhammakāya Foundation|1996|p=48}} Luang Pu Sodh was given his first position as [[abbot]] at [[Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen]], a temple that has been associated with Dhammakaya meditation ever since. Luang Pu Sodh devoted the remainder of his life to teaching Dhammakaya meditation. In 1931, he set up what he called a 'meditation workshop' ({{lang-th|โรงงานทำวิชชา|translit=ronggan tham vicha}}) with meditation practitioners meditating in six-hour shifts throughout the day.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|p=32}} According to a textbook of one temple, the meditation workshop was reserved for gifted practitioners able to practice Dhammakaya meditation on a higher level.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|p=32}}{{sfn|Fuengfusakul|1998|page=24}}{{sfn|Dhammakaya Open University|2010|p=139}} The purpose of the workshop was to use meditation to study certain subjects, which included understanding the nature of the world and the universe, "to learn the truth about the worlds and the galaxies".{{sfn|Dhammakaya Open University|2010|pp=39, 97}}

Since Luang Pu Sodh's death in 1959, Dhammakaya meditation has been taught by his students at several major temples, including Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen, [[Wat Phra Dhammakaya]] in [[Pathum Thani Province|Pathum Thani]], [[Dhammakaya Movement#Wat Luang Phor Sodh Dhammakayaram|Wat Luang Por Sodh Dhammakayaram]] in [[Damnoen Saduak District]], [[Ratchaburi Province]], and [[Dhammakaya Movement#Wat Rajorasaram|Wat Rajorasaram]] in [[Bang Khun Thian District]], Bangkok, as well as in branch centers of these temples across and outside of Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dhammakaya.net/modules/centers/worldwide-centers|title=Worldwide Coordination centers|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=Dhammakaya Foundation|access-date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Newell|2008|pp=117–9, 235}}{{sfn|Schedneck|2016|pp=5–6}} Of these, Wat Phra Dhammakaya and Wat Luang Por Sodh Dhammakayaram have published instructive books on Dhammakaya meditation in English. Both also offer training retreats for the public.&lt;ref name="Schedneck 2015" /&gt;{{sfn|Schedneck|2016|pp=5–6}} The method has become very popular in Thailand and other parts of Southeast Asia,{{sfn|McDaniel|2010|p=661}} and has been described as a revival of ''[[samatha]]'' (tranquility) meditation in Thailand.{{sfn|Bechert|1994|p=259}}

According to Newell, Dhammakaya meditation is taught more or less the same by each temple.&lt;!--238--&gt; However, the emphasis differs, with some temples being more esoteric about the method than others. For example, Wat Luang Phor Sod Dhammakayaram is more specific about the higher stages of meditation in their publications than Wat Phra Dhammakaya, while Wat Phra Dhammakaya emphasizes the calm and concentration the method brings.&lt;!--246-8--&gt;{{sfn|Newell|2008|p=238, 246–8}}

== Method ==
Dhammakaya meditation is also known as ''vijjā dhammakāya'', which translates as 'knowledge of the body of truth'.{{sfn|Rhys Davids|Stede|1921|loc=entries on ''Dhamma'', ''Vijjā'' and ''Kāya''}}

=== The ''samatha'' stage ===
[[File:Buddha topview.jpg|thumb|A topview of the Buddha, as visualized in Dhammakaya meditation]]
There are several techniques which can be used by practitioners in focusing the attention on the center of the body.{{sfn|Fuengfusakul|1998|pp=82–4}}{{sfn|Zehner|2005|p=2325}}{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=389}} Practitioners may visualize a mental image at the center of the body–characteristically, a crystal ball or a crystal clear Buddha image.{{sfn|Tanabe|2016|p=127}} This has been compared with meditation on [[Kasina|a bright object]] in the Visuddhimagga.{{sfn|Fuengfusakul|1998|p=84}}{{sfn|Newell|2008|p=238}} Temples in the tradition often use crystal balls in meditation teaching, to the extent that the crystal ball has become a sacred symbol of the meditation tradition.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|p=14}}{{sfn|Chattinawat|2009|p=57}} Practitioners then visualize this image in front of themselves, and then move the mental image inwards through seven bases of the mind, that is:
# the nostril,
# the corner of the eye,
# the center of the head,
# the roof of the mouth,
# the center of the throat,
# the middle of the stomach at the level of the navel and
# two finger breadths above the previous point, where they keep their attention.
In this context, the center of the body is often called the "seventh base".&lt;ref name="Hutter 2016" /&gt;{{sfn|Fuengfusakul|1998|p=82}} In the tradition, the other six bases have a minor role, as they only function as reference points for the visualization. In this respect, the tradition's approach differs from the extensive symbolism of the ''[[cakra]]s'' as found in [[Vajrayana#Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Tantric tradition]], for example.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|p=108}}

At the same time, practitioners may use a ''[[mantra]]'' ({{lang-th|บริกรรมภาวนา|translit=borikam-phavana}}),&lt;ref name="Hutter 2016" /&gt;{{sfn|Newell|2008|p=238}} that is ''Sammā-Arahaṃ'', which refers to the Buddha who has 'perfectly' (''sammā'') attained 'perfection in the Buddhist sense' (''[[Arhat|arahaṃ]]''),{{sfn|Rhys Davids|Stede|1921|loc=entries on ''Sammā'' and ''Arahant''|pp=76, 695}}{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=389}} as can be found in the traditional [[Buddhist chant#Theravada chants|''Tiratanavanda'' chant]]. This is a form of ''[[Buddhanusmrti|Buddhanussati]]'', i.e. recollecting the Buddha qualities. This mantra has also been used by monks from Northern Thailand.{{sfn|Newell|2008|p=238}} Alternatively, according to Wat Phra Dhammakaya, practitioners can also place the attention at the center of the body directly,{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|p=113}} and can even do so without visualizing or using a mantra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Start Meditation Today|edition= 3rd|publisher=[[Dhammakaya Foundation]]|year=2016|pages=53–4|url=http://interhq.org/download/book/english/start_meditation_today%20_en.pdf|isbn=974-87855-4-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The types of practices, such as use of a mantra and use of a bright object, are not unique to Dhammakaya meditation, but the details of the technique are.{{sfn|Newell|2008|p=238}} As with many forms of Buddhist meditation, Dhammakaya meditation has both ''samatha'' and ''vipassana'' stages.{{sfn|Tanabe|2016|pp=127–8}} As is common with traditional ''samatha'' practice, the goal of Dhammakaya meditation at the ''samatha'' level is to overcome [[five hindrances|mental hindrances to concentration]].{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=390}} When the mind becomes peaceful and stable during ''samatha'', it overcomes those hindrances and reaches a state of concentration. The indication of reaching this stage is that a bright light will arise at the center of the body.{{sfn|Tanabe|2016|p=128}}{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=80}} The mind should then be directed continuously at the center of this sphere helping to transport the mind towards an inner path with several stages.{{sfn|Newell|2008|p=239}}{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|page=102}} During these stages, the practitioner may experience goose bumps or other physical responses. Known as ''[[pīti]]'', this phenomenon is understood to be temporary.{{sfn|Skilton|Choompolpaisal|2017|page=94 n.21}}[[File:The eighteen bodies (kayas) of Vijja Dhammakaya.jpg|thumb|The nine pairs of bodies (''kāyas'') in Vijjā Dhammakāya.]]

The process of concentration in Dhammakaya meditation correlates with the description of ''samatha'' meditation in the Visuddhimagga, specifically ''kasina'' meditation.{{sfn|Newell|2008|p=256}}{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=80}}{{sfn|Fuengfusakul|1998|p=84}} Once the mental hindrances are overcome, the visual image imagined is transformed.{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=80}} The first stage of this path Luang Pu Sodh simply called the 'beginning of the path' ({{lang-th|translit=pathommamak|ปฐมมรรค}}).{{sfn|Fuengfusakul|1998|p=84}}{{sfn|Zehner|2005|p=2325}}{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|p=102}}
After that, Luang Pu Sodh would usually describe the level of attainment in terms of inner bodies (''{{lang-pi|kāya}}'') within every human being,{{sfn|Newell|2008|p=83}} which are successively more subtle, and come in pairs. Mackenzie compares this with [[Russian doll]]s nestled within each other.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|pp=103, 107, 113}} These bodies indicate to what extent the practitioner has attained in meditation practice. Each of these bodies is preceded by several spheres of light.{{sfn|Newell|2008|p=239}}{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|p=103}} In total, every human being consists of nine types of bodies,{{sfn|Fuengfusakul|1998|p=87|loc=Diagram 4}}{{sfn|Newell|2008|pp=240–1}} each of which has a normal and refined form.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|p=103|quote="... as with the previous bodies, these bodies have both a normal and refined form."}} The first four pairs of these bodies are equated with the orthodox ''[[jhāna]]'' meditation attainments.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|pp=102–3}} The final four of these inner pairs are called the ''Dhammakayas'' and are equated with the [[four stages of enlightenment]], leading to the final stage of enlightenment (''arahant'').{{sfn|Newell|2008|pp=240–1}}{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=390}} In between is the 'change-of-lineage' ({{lang-pi|gotrabhū|italic=yes}}) intermediary Dhammakaya state:{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|p=103}}{{sfn|Newell|2008|p=240}} this is the intermediate state between not being enlightened yet and the four stages of enlightenment.{{sfn|Fuengfusakul|1998|pp=85, 87|loc=Diagram 4}}

The attainment of the ''Dhammakaya'' (or ''Dhammakayas'') is thus described as the result of many steps of practice, culminating in the cessation of the [[Kilesa|defilements]] in the mind, or, in positive terms, as the highest happiness. The ''Dhammakaya'' is considered the "purest element" within every human being, which is permanent and essential, and is equated with [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]].{{sfn|Scott|2009|pp=79–80}} The purest element has the shape of a luminous Buddha figure sitting within oneself.{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=126}} Besides the unorthodox definition of Nirvana as true happiness, permanent and essential, it is also described by the movement from a more orthodox perspective, as the absence of [[lobha|greed]], [[Dvesha (Buddhism)|hatred]] and [[Moha (Buddhism)|delusion]].{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=80}} Religion scholar Rachelle Scott, however, has argued that the positive description of Nirvana as happiness, permanent and essential, is what has contributed to the popularity of the method and its proponents.{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=80}}

&lt;small&gt;Advanced stages in Dhammakāya meditation.{{sfn|Newell|2008|pp=239–41}}{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|pp=102–3}}{{sfn|Fuengfusakul|1998|p=87|loc=Diagram 4}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Visuddhivācā : translation of Morradok dhamma of Luang Phaw Wat Pak Nam, Phramongkolthepmuni|last=Mongkhonthēpphamunī (Sot),|first=Phra|date=2008|publisher=60th Dhammachai Education Foundation|others=Sudhammo, Sudham, Rakkitajitto, Sombat, 60th Dhammachai Education Foundation|isbn=9789743498152|edition= 1st|location=Berrilee, N.S.W.|pages=40–51|oclc=988643495}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

=== The ''vipassana'' stage ===
Dhammakaya meditation begins with the ''vipassana'' level at a later stage than some other meditation schools in Thailand.{{sfn|Cousins|1996|pp=38–9}} In Dhammakaya meditation, a distinction is made between "seeing the Dhammakāya" and "being the Dhammakāya". Only the latter is equated with having attained the stages of enlightenment at a stable level. It is believed that the further practitioners progress through the successive stages of the practice, the more their mind will become more pure and refined.{{sfn|Fuengfusakul|1998|p=85}} After practitioners have attained the ''Dhammakaya'', they can gain insight into the reality of life through observation of their own physical and mental processes.{{sfn|Tanabe|2016|p=128}} It is believed they can understand birth, death and suffering at a deeper level,&lt;!--85--&gt; when they see the literal essence of these phenomena through meditative attainment.&lt;!--88--&gt; The practitioner can accomplish a purification of the mind&lt;!--85--&gt; until an end can be reached, that is Nirvana.&lt;!--87--&gt;{{sfn|Fuengfusakul|1998|pp=85–8}} Nirvana is described as a subtle sphere ({{lang-pi|ayatana|italic=yes}}) and, controversially, as [[atman (Buddhism)|"true self"]] ({{lang-pi|attā|italic=yes}}). Orthodox teachings on [[anatta|not-self]] ({{lang-pi|anattā|italic=yes}}) are regarded as methods to let go of what is not the true self.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=390}}

Dhammakaya meditation at the higher levels is believed to bring forth ''[[abhiñña]]'', mental powers. Through such powers practitioners are believed to be able to see different realms of the cosmos following [[Buddhist cosmology]].{{sfn|Newell|2008|p=241}} These powers can also be used for the benefit of society at large.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|pp=34–5}}{{sfn|Newell|2008|p=241}} Dhammakaya meditation is believed by some practitioners to have been used during the Second World War to prevent Thailand from being bombed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor1-last=Jerryson|editor1-first=Michael|year=2016|encyclopedia=The Oxford Handbook of Contemporary Buddhism|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-936238-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rBk1DQAAQBAJ|title=Contemporary Thai Buddhism|last=Scott|first=Rachelle M.|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|pp=34–5}} and used to extinguish the negative forces in the cosmos ([[Mara (demon)|Māra]]).&lt;ref name="Falk 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Falk |first1=Monica Lindberg|title=Making fields of merit: Buddhist female ascetics and gendered orders in Thailand|date=2007|publisher=NIAS Press|location=Copenhagen|isbn=978-87-7694-019-5|edition= 1st|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=390}} This belief that Dhammakaya meditation can be used to extinguish negative forces has strongly affected the attitudes of practitioners at Dhammakaya movement temples, who therefore hold that Dhammakaya meditation is not only important for the individual, but also for the {{em|cosmos}} at large.&lt;ref name="Hutter 2016" /&gt;{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|pp=32–3}}

Scientific research done on Dhammakaya meditation at the ''samatha'' level has shown that it reduced serum [[cortisol]] level and blood pressure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khobragade|first1=Yadneshwar|last2=Khobragade|first2=Sujata|last3=Abbas|first3=Adinegara|title=Hypertension and meditation: can meditation be useful in preventing hypertension?|journal=International Journal of Community Medicine and Public Health|date=2016|page=1691|doi=10.18203/2394-6040.ijcmph20162030}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Sudsuang|Chentanez|Veluvan|1990|page=544}} while increasing serum protein level. [[Systolic pressure]], [[diastolic pressure]] and pulse rate were also reduced, as well as tidal capacity, tidal volume and maximal voluntary ventilation. Finally, reaction time was reduced.{{sfn|Sudsuang|Chentanez|Veluvan|1990|pp=544–5}} Psychologically, Dhammakaya meditation reduced clinical depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kasantikul|last2=Suttipan|last3=Worakul|year=1986|title=Title unknown|journal=Journal of the Psychiatric Association of Thailand|volume=31|pages=177–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Scott, in the time of Luang Pu Sodh the method was criticized by some for being extra-canonical,{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=82}} although Asian studies scholar Edwin Zehner downplays this, stating there was no widespread criticism.{{sfn|Zehner|2005|p=2324}} Discussion within the Thai monastic community led to an inspection at Wat Paknam, but no fault could be found in Luang Pu Sodh's method.{{sfn|Fuengfusakul|1998|p=24}} More recently, Dhammakaya meditation has been depicted as a fast and effective meditation method for competitive professionals with little time.{{sfn|Newell|2008|p=242}}{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|p=65}} Mackenzie does remark, however, that the method is not simpler than other methods, but that its appeal is that its benefits can be more readily experienced than more orthodox models.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|p=65}} As with other meditation methods emphasizing ''samatha'', opponents writing from a [[Buddhist modernism|modernist]] standpoint have criticized the method. These critics point at the emphasis on pleasant feelings as opposed to insight. They argue against the mystical dimension of meditation practice, saying that bliss in meditation is a hindrance to insight. On the other hand, practitioners of the method often argue how the method is capable of changing people for the better, and has positive effects in all aspects of the practitioner's daily life.{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=81–2}} Religion scholar Donald Swearer calls the meditation method "a unique method of meditation which involves a visualization technique not unlike that associated with certain [[yogic]] or tantric forms of meditation, and is easily taught to large groups of people".{{sfn|Swearer|1991|p=660}} Meditation in large groups, as is common in the activities of Wat Phra Dhammakaya, contrasts with the emphasis of most Thai temples on meditation in solitude. The temple stresses the importance of meditating as a group to counterbalance the negativity in the world.{{sfn|Litalien|2010|p=159}}

The interpretations of the true self by the Dhammakaya movement have been criticized by orthodox Thai scholars such as [[Prayudh Payutto|Phra Payutto]], and have led to considerable debate in Thailand. {{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=390}} The word ''dhammakāya'' in its orthodox sense is commonly understood as a figurative term, meaning the "body" or the sum of the Buddha's teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Frank E.|year=1977|title=The Several Bodies of Buddha: Reflections on a Neglected Aspect of Theravada Tradition|journal=History of Religions |volume=16 |issue=4 |jstor=1062637 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Several_Bodies_of_Buddha_Reflections.html?id=KvQ4jwEACAAJ|pp=376–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Fuengfusakul|1998|p=89}} The idea of a body of spiritual attainment can be found in the [[Pali Canon|early Buddhist scriptures]], though, but this is described as a "body accomplished by the mind" ({{lang-pi|manomayakāya|italic=yes}}) and not directly connected with the attainment of Nirvana.&lt;!--89--&gt; However, in a later Sinhalese [[Pāli]] text, Nirvana is described as a "body of emptiness", which is a similar concept. Finally, the concept of the [[Dharmakāya]] has been much further developed in Mahāyāna Buddhism.&lt;!--90--&gt;{{sfn|Fuengfusakul|1998|p=90}} The interpretations of the Dhammakaya movement with regard to true self have been compared with [[Mahāyāna]] ideas like the [[Buddha Nature]],{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=390}} but such influence has been rejected by the movement itself.{{sfn|Williams|2009|pp=126–7}} Proponents of the movement cite several Pāli texts, such as one text stating that Nirvana is true happiness, and argue that the true self is a logical conclusion that follows from these texts. Other proponents feel that the problem is a matter of practice more than debate.{{sfn|Fuengfusakul|1998|pp=92–3}}&lt;ref name="Rungrawee 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chalermsripinyorat|first1=Rungrawee|title=Doing the Business of Faith: The Capitalistic Dhammakaya Movement and the Spiritually-thirsty Thai Middle Class|journal=Manusya: Journal of Humanities|date=2002|volume=5|issue=1|pages=14–20|url=http://www.manusya.journals.chula.ac.th/files/essay/rungrawee_13-28.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Study Center was established in 1951, due to the resurgence of Buddhism after [[Sri Lankan independence movement|independence]], which brought with it an increased need for dialogue between Buddhism and Christianity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt; The goal of the center is to consider Christianity in the light of the Sri Lankan culture and heritage, which is predominantly Buddhist. The Study Center was renamed in 1977 to ''Ecumenical Institute for Study and Dialogue'' (EISD).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2003/02/16/fea05.html Online edition of Sunday Observer - Business] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412223227/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2003/02/16/fea05.html |date=2008-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; It was organised into two divisions: ''Division of Buddhist Studies'', and  ''Division of Frontier Studies''.

'''Ekasarana Dharma'''&lt;ref&gt;Sarma {{harv|Sarma|1966|p=41}}, Cantlie {{Harvcol|Cantlie|1984|p=258}} and Barman {{Harvcol|Barman|1999|p=64}} call it ''Ekasarana''.  Maheshwar Neog uses both ''Ekasarana''{{Harvcol|Neog|1985|p=111}} as well as ''Ekasarana naam-dharma'', qualifying the word ''[[dharma]]'' in the second example. Others call it ''Ekasarana Hari-naam-Dharma'', further qualifying the word ''dharma''.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Assamese language|Assamese]] {{lang|as|এক শৰণ ধৰ্ম}}; literally: 'Shelter-in-One religion') is a [[Panentheism|panentheistic]] form of [[Hinduism]] founded and propagated by [[Srimanta Sankardeva]] in the 15th century.  Most of the adherents of this religion today live in the [[India]]n state of [[Assam]].  As part of the greater [[Bhakti movement]] in other parts of [[India]], it rejects vedic and other esoteric rites of worship, and instead replaces them by a simplified form that requires just uttering the name (''[[Nāma|naam]]'') of God.

The simple and accessible religion attracted already Hinduized as well as non-Hindu tribal populations into its egalitarian folds.  The new converts were accepted via a system of individual initiation and were given a path to social improvement.  Institutions like ''[[sattra]]'' (monasteries) and village ''[[Namghar]]'' (prayer houses), had profound influence in the evolution of social makeup of Assam's society.  The artistic oeuvres lead to engendering of new forms of literature, music (''[[Borgeet]]s'' or songs celestials), theatre (''[[Ankia Naat]]'') and dance ([[Sattriya dance]]).

The central [[religious text]] of this religion is [[Bhagavat of Sankardeva]], which was transcreated from the Sanskrit [[Bhagavata Purana]] by [[Srimanta Sankardeva]] and other religious preceptors.  This book is supplemented by the two books of hymns: ''[[Kirtan Ghoxa]]'' by Sankardeva and ''[[Naam Ghoxa]]'' by [[Madhabdev]].  These books are written in the [[Assamese language|Assamese]] language.

The religion is also called ''Mahapuruxiya'' because it is based on the worship of the Mahapurux or Mahapurush (Sanskrit: ''Maha'': Supreme and ''purush:'' Being), an epithet of Lord Vishnu in the Bhagavata and its adherents are often called ''Mahapuruxia'', ''Sankari'', ''Saraniya'' etc. In course of time, the epithet 'Mahapurux' came to be (secondarily) applied also to Sankardeva and Madhabdev, the principal preceptors. Non-adherence to the Hindu [[varnasrama]] system and egalitarianism marked its character.

A strictly monotheistic religion, the only form of worship prescribed by this religion is uttering the name of God ("Sravana-Kirttana"), who is worshiped in the form of [[Krishna]] or [[Hari]].  Thus it is also called ''ek sarana Hari naam dharma''. Though a part of the wider [[Bhakti]] movement, it does not worship [[Radha]] with Krishna which is common in other bhakti movements. It is characterised by the ''dasya'' form of worship.  Historically, it has been against caste system, and especially against animal sacrifices common in ''sakta'' forms of Hinduism.  Noted for its egalitarianism, it posed a serious challenge to Brahminical Hinduism, and converted into its fold people of all castes, ethnicity and religion (including [[Islam]]).

==Worshipful God and salvation==
{{Subschools of Vedanta|Three Vaishnava schools accept the Bhagavata as authoritative (Madhava, Chaitanya and Vallabha)&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sheridan|1986|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Ramanuja does not mention it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sheridan|1986|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sankardev's school accepts the ''nirvisesa'' God&lt;ref&gt;"To him (Sankardev) Brahman is indeterminate (''nirvisesa'')..." {{harv|Neog|1981|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; and avers on ''vivartavada''&lt;ref&gt;"Sankardev cannot lend himself to ''parinamavada'' because of his monistic position and therefore, leans on the side of ''vivartavada'' {{harv|Neog|1981|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; which maintains that the world is a phenomenal aspect of Brahma, thus taking it very close to Sankaracharya's position.&lt;ref&gt;"...on the philosophical or theoretical side there is scarcely any difference between the two Sankaras. {{harv|Neog|1981|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, like the modern [[neo-Vedanta]] philosophies, Sankardev's philosophy accepts both the Nirguna and the Saguna Brahma.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sarma|1966|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this unique philosophical position among the Vaishnavites, the preceptors of Ekasarana or their later followers provided no commentary of the ''[[Prasthanatrayi|prasthana-traya]]'' or gloss and did not establish an independent system of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Neog|1981|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The preceptors as well as later leaders of the Ekasarana religion focused mainly on the religious practice of ''bhakti'' and kept away from systematically expounding philosophical positions.&lt;ref&gt;Though several schools of ''Vaishnavism'' had their own philosophical treatises (Ramanuja, Madhava, Nimbarka, Vallabhacharya), Sankardeva and Chaitanya did not.  Though Jiva Goswami compiled systematic works for Chaitanya, nothing similar was attempted by Sankardeva's followers {{harv|Neog|1980|pp=222–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless references found scattered in the voluminous works of [[Sankardeva]] and [[Madhavdeva]] indicate that their theosophical positions are rooted in the [[Bhagavata Purana]]&lt;ref&gt;"Sankaradeva was enabled to preach the new faith he had established for himself and for earnest seekers in his province, basing it on the philosophical doctrines of the Gita and the Bhagavata Purana as its scriptures" {{cite web|last=Chatterji|first=Suniti Kumar|title=The Eka-sarana Dharma of Sankaradeva: The Greatest Expression of Assamese Spiritual Outlook|url=http://atributetosankaradeva.org/greatest_expression.pdf|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a strong [[Advaita]] influence via its commentary  ''Bhavartha-dipika'' by Sridhar Swami.&lt;ref&gt;"...the influence of the Bhagavata Purana in forming the theological backbone of Assam Vaishnavism in quite clear and the monistic commentary of Sridhara Swami is highly popular amongst all sections of Vaishnavas" {{harv|Sarma|1966|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Sankardeva's interpretation of these texts were seen at once to be "original and new".&lt;ref&gt;"If there could be any question of mutation or affiliation still, it could have been with the Gita and the Bhagawat direct which Sankardew read and interpreted in his own way, at once original and new" {{harv|Neog|1963|p=4}}.  Haladhar Bhuyan, the founder of the Sankar Sangha, a modern sect of Ekasarana concurs: "Sri Neog now definitely shows that Sankardew’s philosophy is his own and that his religion is as original as that of any great preacher of the world" {{harvcol|Neog|1963|p=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars hold that these texts are not followed ''in-toto'' and deviations are often seen in the writings especially when the original philosophical contents came into conflict with the primary focus of ''bhakti'' as enunciated in the Ekasarana-dharma.&lt;ref&gt;For example, "the Chapters of the Bhagavata Purana, where the [[Pañcaratra|Pancharatra]] theology is discussed, have been omitted by Assamese translators because the ''Vyuha'' doctrine finds no place in the theology of Assamese Vaishnavism." {{harv|Sarma|1966|p=27}}; "the highly philosophical benedictory verse (''mangalacarana'') of Book I of the Bhagavata-Purana, which has been elaborately commented upon by Sridhara from the monistic stand-point, has been totally omitted by Sankaradeva in his rendering."  Whereas, "Kapila of ''Saṃkhya'' is an incarnation of God" in the original, ''Saṃkhya'' and ''Yoga'' are made subservient to ''bhakti'' {{harv|Neog|1980|p=235}}.   Furthermore, "Where Sridhara's commentary appears to them in direct conflict with their Ekasarana-dharma, they have not hesitated to deviate from Sridhara's views." {{harv|Sarma|1966|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature of God===
Though it acknowledges the impersonal ([[Nirguna Brahman|nirguna]]) god, it identifies the personal ([[Saguna Brahma|saguna]]) one as worshipful&lt;ref&gt;"Assamese Vaishnava scriptures without denying the ''nirguna'', i.e. indeterminate aspect of God, have laid more stress on the ''saguna'' aspect." {{harv|Sarma|1966|p=27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which it calls [[Narayana]].&lt;ref&gt;"The first two lines of ''Kirtana'' has struck this note: 'At the very outset, I bow to the eternal Brahman who in the form of Narayana is the root of all incarnations'" {{harv|Sarma|1966|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sole aspect that distinguishes the personal from the impersonal one is the act of creation,&lt;ref&gt;''Nimi-nava-siddha-sambad'', verses 187–188 {{harv|Sarma|1966|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which Narayana created everything.  Unlike in [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] it claims no distinction between Brahman, Paramatman and Bhagavat, which are considered in ''Ekasarana'' as just different appellations applied to the same supreme reality.&lt;ref&gt;''ekerese tini nama laksana bhedata'' in ''Nimi-navasiddha-sambada'' verses 178–181 (Sankardeva) {{harv|Sarma|1966|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though Narayana is sometimes used synonymously with Vishnu, the gods [[Vishnu]], [[Brahma]] and [[Shiva]] are considered of lower divinity.&lt;ref&gt;''Nimi-navasiddha-samvada'', verse 178 (Sankardeva); ''Anadi-patan'' verses 163–167 (Sankardeva) {{Harv|Sarma|1966|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narayana as the personal and worshipful god is considered to be a loving and lovable god, who possesses auspicious attributes that attract devotees.  He is non-dual, omnipotent and omniscient; creator, sustainer, and destroyer of all.  He also possesses moral qualities like ''karunamaya'' (compassionate), ''dinabandhu'' (friend of the lowly), ''bhakta-vatsala'' (beloved of devotees) and ''patit-pavana'' (redeemer of sinners) that make him attractive to devotees. Though it does not deny the existence of other gods, it asserts that Narayana alone is worshipful and the others are strictly excluded.

====Krishna====
Following the [[Bhagavata Purana]], the object of devotion in Ekasarana is [[Krishna]], who is the supreme entity himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chutiya|first=Sonaram|title=Srimad-Bhāgavata : The Image of God|url=http://atributetosankaradeva.org/Srimad_Bhagavata_Image_of_God.pdf|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Therefore, it is the incarnate Krishna Who is the Param-Brahma, denoting Om, and it is He Who is also the world's father and mother. The Deity of Worship (ārādhya devatā) of all gods and goddesses or, in other words, of life itself, is Lord Krishna only.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bezbaroa|first=Lakshminath|title=A Creative Vision: – Essays on Sankaradeva and Neo-Vaisnava Movement in Assam|year=2004|publisher=Srimanta Sankar Kristi Bikash Samiti|url=http://atributetosankaradeva.org/History_of_Vaisnavism.pdf|accessdate=3 November 2012|quote=Krishna was the all-supreme God of adoration for him}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is suddha (pure), satya (true). All other deities are subservient to Him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fundamental Aspects of Sankaradeva's Religion – Monotheism|url=http://atributetosankaradeva.org/monotheism.htm|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brahman, Vishnu and Krishna are fundamentally one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chutiya|first=Sonaram|title=The Real Philosophy of Mahāpurusism|url=http://atributetosankaradeva.org/The_Real_Philosophy_of_Mahapurusism.pdf|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brahman, Vishnu and Krishna are fundamentally one&lt;/ref&gt; Krishna is alone the supreme worshipful in the system. Sankaradeva's Krishna is Nārāyana, the Supreme Reality or Parama Brahma and not merely an avatara of Visnu. Krishna is God Himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fundamental Aspects of Sankaradeva's Religion – Monotheism|url=http://atributetosankaradeva.org/monotheism.htm|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It considers Narayana (Krishna) as both the cause as well as the effect of this creation,&lt;ref&gt;''Kirtana'' VIII {{harv|Sarma|1966|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and asserts Narayana alone is the sole reality.&lt;ref&gt;''Bhakti-ratnakar'', verse 111 {{harv|Sarma|1966|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the philosophical angle, He is the Supreme Spirit (Param-Brahma). As the controller of the senses, the Yogis call him Paramatma. When connected with this world, He assumes the name of Bhagavanta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gupta|first=Bina|title=Lord Krishna's Teachings and Sankaradeva|url=http://atributetosankaradeva.org/Lord_Krishna_Teachings_Sankaradeva.doc|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, some of the characteristics usually reserved for the impersonal God in other philosophies are attributed to Narayana with reinterpretations.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''nirakara'' is used to describe Narayana as someone without an ordinary or special form (''prakrita akara varjita'') {{harv|Sarma|1966|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Jiva'' and salvation===
The embodied self, called ''jiva'' or ''jivatma'' is identical to Narayana.&lt;ref&gt;"Though associated with body yet I am not identical with it: I am verily Paramatma.  I am Brahma and Brahma is I", Sankardeva in ''Bhagavata'' Book XII verses 18512-18518 {{Harv|Sarma|1966|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is shrouded by ''[[maya (illusion)|maya]]'' and thus suffers from misery,&lt;ref&gt;Sankardeva, ''Bhakti-ratnakara'', verse 773 {{Harv|Sarma|1966|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the ego (''ahamkara'') is destroyed, the ''jiva'' can perceive himself as Brahma.&lt;ref&gt;Sankardeva, ''Bhagavata'' {{Harv|Sarma|1966|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''jiva'' attains ''mukti'' (liberation) when the jiva is restored to its natural state (''maya'' is removed).  Though other Vaishnavites (Ramanuja, Nimbarka, Vallabha, Caitanya) recognise only ''videhamukti'' (''mukti'' after death), the Ekasarana preceptors have recognised, in addition, ''jivanmukti'' (''mukti'' during lifetime).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Sarma|1966|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the five different kinds of ''videhamukti'',&lt;ref&gt;(1) ''Salokyo'' (being in the same plane as God); (2) ''Samipya'' (nearness to God); (3) ''Sarupya'' (likeness to God); (4) ''Sarsti'' (equaling God in glory) and (5) ''Sayujya'' (absorption in God)&lt;/ref&gt; the Ekasarana rejects the ''Sayujya'' form of ''mukti'', where the complete absorption in God deprives ''jiva'' of the sweetness and bliss associated with ''bhakti''.  ''Bhakti'' is thus not a means to ''mukti'' but an end to itself, and this is strongly emphasised in Ekasarana writings——Madhavdeva begins his Namaghosha with an obeisance to devotees who do not prefer ''mukti''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Sarma|1966|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; This identity between the ''jivatma'' and Narayana is beautifully expressed by Sankaradeva through the words of the Vedas in the 'Veda Stuti' (The Prayer of the Vedas) section of his Kirttana Ghosā, ''jiva amse Tumi pravesilā gāve gāve'':-

&lt;small&gt;We, all creatures, constitute a part of Thine. Thy maya, Oh Lord, keeps us in bondage; give us instruction so that we may adore Thy Feet and remove the fetters of maya through Sravana and Kirttana. [1656]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mahanta|first=Chandrakanta|title=Sankaradeva's 'Veda Stuti' (The Prayer of the Vedas)|url=http://atributetosankaradeva.org/Veda_Stuti.pdf|publisher=Asom Satra Sangha|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/small&gt;

Maya or nescience in Sankaradeva is seen as a barrier to the Lord's bhakti (Devotion). And therefore, to break the fetters of maya, is prescribed the path of adoration (bhajana) of the Lord solely through the listening to (Sravana) and recitation (Kirttana) of His Glories, taking sole-refuge (Eka-Sarana) in Him, in the company of His (single-minded) devotees (bhaktas):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mahanta|first=Chandrakanta|title=Sankaradeva's 'Veda Stuti' (The Prayer of the Vedas)|url=http://atributetosankaradeva.org/Veda_Stuti.pdf|publisher=Asom Satra Sangha|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;-

&lt;small&gt;From these words of Bhagavanta (God), by taking Eka-Sarana in Him, one gains the Lord's favour and is [thus] able to effortlessly understand māyā (nescience) and [also] liberate oneself from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chutiya|first=Sonaram|title=Eka-Sarana in the Light of the Bhakti-Ratnākara|url=http://atributetosankaradeva.org/bhakti_ratnakarara_adharat_eka_sarana_tattva_trans.pdf|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [Sankaradeva, ''Bhakti-Ratnākara'', Māyātaranopāya' ('Way to Release From Māyā'), the 36th Māhātmya]&lt;/small&gt;

===Krishna is identical to Narayana===
Narayana often manifests through ''avatars'', and [[Krishna]] is considered as the most perfect one who is not a partial manifestation but Narayana himself.&lt;ref&gt;based on the ''Bhagavata Puran'', 1/3/28 {{harv|Sarma|1966|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the form of Krishna that Narayana is usually worshiped. The description of Krishna is based on the one in Bhagavat Puran, as one who resides in [[Vaikuntha]] along with his devotees.  Thus the worshipful form is different from other forms of Krishna-based religions (Radha-Krishna of Caitanya, Gopi-Krishna of Vallabhacharya, Rukmini-Krishna of Namadeva and Sita-Rama of Ramananda).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Murthy|1973|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form of devotion is infused with the ''dasya'' and ''balya bhava'' in the works of Sankardev and Madhabdev.  ''Madhura bhava'', so prevalent in the other religions, is singularly absent here.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sarma|1966|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four Reals==
The ''cari vastu'' or the ''Four Reals'' defined this religious system. They are:
* ''Guru'' — reverence of a Guru, or Spiritual Preceptor.  
* ''Deva'' — worship of a single God.
* ''Naam'' — the chanting and singing the name and the qualities of God.
* ''Bhakat'' — the association or the congregation of devotees (''bhaktas'').

==Four Books: sacred texts==
The single most important religious text is the [[Bhagavat of Sankardeva|Bhagavata]], especially the Book X (''Daxama'').   This work was transcreated from the original Sanskrit [[Bhagavata Purana]] to Assamese in the 15th and 16th centuries by ten different individuals, but chiefly by [[Srimanta Sankardev]] who rendered as many as ten Cantos (complete and partial) of this holy text.

Three other works find a special place in this religion: ''[[Kirtan Ghoxa]]'', composed by Sankardev; and ''[[Naam Ghoxa]]'' and ''Ratnavali'', composed by Madhavdev.

== Denominations ==
[[File:Ekasarana-divisions.svg|thumb|right|500px|The different branches of the '''Ekasarana dharma''', based on {{Harvcol|Cantile|1984|p=170}}. Note that the followers of Damodardeva and Harideva deny they took initiation from Sankardeva.]]
The religion fissured into four ''sanghati'' (''samhatis'' or sub-sects) soon after the death of Srimanta Sankardeva.  Sankardev handed down the leadership to [[Madhabdev]], but the followers of [[Damodardev]] and Harideva did not accept Madhabdev as their leader and formed their own group (''Brahma sanghati''). Madhabdeva at the time of his death did not name a successor.  After his death three leaders formed their own denominations:  Bhabanipuria Gopal Ata (''Kaal sanghati''), Purushuttom Thakur Ata, a grandson of Sankardev (''Purusa sanghati'') and Mathuradas Burhagopal Ata (''Nika Sanghati'').  They differ mostly in the emphasis of the ''cari vastus'' (four fundamental principles)

;Brahma sanghati: The Brahma sanghati developed as a result of Damodardev and Haridev moving away from Sankardev's successor Madhabdev's leadership.  Over time this sanghati brought back some elements of Brahminical orthodoxy.  The vedic rituals which are generally prohibited in the other sanghatis are allowed in this ''sanghati''.  Brahmins too found this ''sanghati'' attractive and most of the [[Sattra]]s of this ''sanghati'' have traditionally had Brahmin ''sattradhikars''.  Among the ''cari vastus'', ''Deva'' is emphasised, worship of the images of the ''deva'' (Vishnu and the chief incarnations, Krishna and Rama) are allowed.  Among the gurus Damodardev is paramount.  Later on they came to call themselves ''Damodariya'' after Damodardev.

;Purush sanghati: The Purush sanghati was initiated by the grandsons of Sankardeva—Purushottam Thakur and Chaturbhuj Thakur—after the death of Madhavdev. The emphasis is on ''Naam''.  Sankardeva has a special position among the hierarchy of ''Gurus''.  Some brahminical rites as well as the worship of images is tolerated to some extent.

;Nika sanghati: This ''sanghati'' was initiated by Padma, Mathuradas and Kesava Ata.  The emphasis is on ''sat-sanga''.  This sanghati is called ''Nika'' (clean) because it developed strict codes for purity and cleanliness in religious matters as well as in general living, as laid down by Madhabdeva.  Idol worship is strictly prohibited and it gives special importance to Madhavdev.

;Kala sanghati: The Kala ''sanghati'', initiated by Gopal Ata and named after the place of his headquarters Kaljar, placed its emphasis on ''Guru''.  The leader of this ''sanghati'' came to be considered as the physical embodiment of ''Deva'', and the disciples of this sect are not allowed to pay obeisance to anyone else.  This sect was successful in initiating many tribal and socially backward groups into the Mahapuruxia fold, and it had the largest following among the different ''sanghatis''.  The followers of this sect were responsible for the [[Moamoria rebellion]] against the [[Ahom Dynasty|Ahom royalty]].

'''Essence of Time''' ({{lang-ru|Суть времени}}) is a Russian movement,&lt;ref name="manifesto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eot.su/sites/default/files/manifest_eot.pdf |title=The manifesto of the movement "Essence of Time" |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded and led by political scientist, philosopher and theater director [[Sergey Kurginyan|Sergei Kurginyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eot.su/council |title=Council coordinator of "Essence of Time"|publisher=Eot.su|date=|accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eot.su/status|title=Treatment status of the resource|publisher=Eot.su|date=|accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
The movement's ideology is a mixture of [[communism]] with Russian patriotic elements. Its principles are explained in ''The manifesto of the movement "Essence of Time"''.&lt;ref name="manifesto"/&gt;

The manifesto declares that the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] was a great tragedy. The objective of the movement is to restitute the USSR in a better and more capable form. The ascertainment of what was responsible for the USSR's fall is considered a key step in this process.

According to Kurginyan, [[capitalism]] is inherently incompatible with Russian historical and cultural heritage. Since the fall of the USSR in 1991 "the capitalism in Russia has not built anything, and destroyed everything", but, fortunately, after 20 years, Russia is slowly starting to "wake up". The Fall of the USSR was just a part of a game, played by the postmodern entities against "the history and humanity". Kurginyan considers his manifesto to be a new [[The Communist Manifesto|Communist manifesto]],{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} analysis of new [[bourgeoisie]], whose nature has evolved since Marx's time.

The movement is grounded in modern philosophy and incorporates the ideas of [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]], [[Erich Fromm]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Alexander Bogdanov]], [[Viktor Frankl]], and others. One of the main principles of the movement's ideology is the ascription of great importance to the human spirit as a philosophical category, which is considered to be linked directly to the question of the ascent of humanity. The project subscribes to conception of ''uber-modernity'' (in Russian сверхмодерн, tr. sverkhmodern), not to be confused with post-modernity, and on this principle hopes to build a new historical project for Russia. The project conceives of a great historical role for Russia in moving the world out of the global crisis of capitalism, based on the country's experience of alternatives to capitalist modernity and so-called post-modernity).

The movement seeks to unite people with socialist and communist political views as well as those with patriotic views and [[Orthodox Christian]] values, hoping on this basis to create a spiritual synthesis.

One of the main aims of the movement is a revival of the [[Soviet Union]] on new principles, taking into account the mistakes of the past (the project is thus dubbed ''USSR 2.0''). EoT envisions a new red union state - a union of equal nations where the Russian nation plays the role of the state's core.

The ultimate goal of the movement is the bringing to life the best of communism's ideas -namely a state of being in society which provides for the awakening and development of the higher creative abilities of every human being.

==History of the movement==
On July 19, 2010, the show "Court of Time" began broadcasting nationally on Russian television's Fifth Channel. The subject of the show was a serious discussion of historical events and personalities in the form of the hearing. The main participants were [[Leonid Mlechin]] and Sergei Kurginyan. The show gained certain measure of public acclaim, in part because of the subject matter, but also because the studio audience and internet and telephone voters were asked to vote whose side they agreed with. While the small studio audience was often won over by Mlechin, who adheres to liberal political and economic values, online and telephone voters always decisively sided with Sergei Kurginyan (ranging from a minimum of 72% to 97%), who consistently defended the pro-Soviet stance. The last broadcast of this show was held on December 30, 2010.

After the conclusion of "Court of Time" Sergei Kurginyan began his own web show entitled "Essence of Time", which, in lecture format, outlined his views on the causes of the Soviet Union's collapse, the prospects for the political, socioeconomic and cultural development of Russia, and the political situation in the world and its relation to the previous two questions. Kurginyan noted that he conceived of the program as an opportunity to continue the discussion, started in the program "Court of Time", but now among a circle of friends. On the basis of this web show the virtual club "Essence of Time" was soon created, quickly gathering enthusiasts and building local sections of the club.

{{one source|date=November 2015}}
In [[Finnish folklore]], all places and things, and also human beings, have a [[haltija]] (a genius, guardian spirit) of their own.  One such haltija is called '''etiäinen'''—an image, [[doppelgänger]], or just an impression that goes ahead of a person, doing things the person in question later does. For example, people waiting at home might hear the door close or even see a shadow or a silhouette, only to realize that no one has yet arrived. Etiäinen can also refer to some kind of a feeling that something is going to happen. Sometimes it could, for example, warn of a bad year coming.&lt;ref&gt;''Suomalaisten runojen uskonto'', Kaarle Krohn. p.165. {{ISBN|9789525774047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Finnish the term has detached from its shamanistic origins and refers to [[premonition]]. Unlike clairvoyance, divination and similar practices, etiäiset (plural) are spontaneous and can't be induced. Quite the opposite, they may be unwanted and cause anxiety, like ghosts. Etiäiset need not be too dramatic and may concern everyday events, although ones related to e.g. deaths are common. As these phenomena are still reported today, they can be considered a living tradition, as a way to explain the psychological experience of premonition.

== Possible causes ==
One explanation given for the detail of the apparition is that when a person is waiting for someone, their anticipation can augment everyday sounds, for example of a cat or the wind, and bring to consciousness a vivid recollection of the person. This recollection will tend to produce the feeling that the remembered person is "coming". If no one comes, the "possible etiäinen" is forgotten. The failure of this explanation is that etiäinen is not necessary when you expect someone to come. It more often indicates an unexpected visitor who would otherwise come as a surprise without phone calls or any kind of announcement beforehand.

'''Frederick Charles Husenbeth''' (born at [[Bristol]], 30 May 1796; died at [[Costessey]], [[Norfolk]], 31 October 1872) was an [[England|English]] Catholic priest and writer.

== Life ==
The son of a Bristol wine-merchant and of a lady of [[Cornish people|Cornish]] family, a convert to Catholicism, he was sent at the age of seven to [[Sedgley Park School, Wolverhampton|Sedgley Park School]] in [[Staffordshire]], and at fourteen entered his father's counting-house. Having formed the resolution, three years later, to study for the priesthood, he returned to Sedgley, going afterwards to [[Oscott College]], where he was ordained by [[John Milner (bishop)|John Milner]] in 1820. 

After serving the [[Stourbridge]] mission, near Oscott, for a time, he was sent to [[Cossey Hall]], Norfolk, as chaplain to Sir [[George Stafford Jerningham]], who became Baron Stafford in 1825. He took up his residence in a cottage in the village, and continued his ministrations here to the Catholics of the mission until within a few months of his death. 

During this long period, extending over more than half a century, he is said to have been absent from his mission only on three Sundays. Seven years after his appointment to Cossey he became grand vicar under Bishop Walsh, successor of Bishop Milner as [[Vicar Apostolic of the Midland District]]. In 1841 he opened St. Wulstan's Chapel, for which he had collected funds, and in 1850 he received the degree of Doctor of Divinity from Rome. 

Shortly after the [[restoration of the English hierarchy]] by [[Pope Pius IX]], Husenbeth was nominated provost of the Chapter, of [[Northampton]], and Vicar-General of the diocese. In the spring of 1872 he resigned his mission, and he died at St. Wulstan's Presbytery on the last day of October in the same year.

He had no particular liking for [[religious institute]]s, and was quite opposed to the new forms of devotion which had grown up since his student days at Oscott.

== Works ==
In his quiet country presbytery, he found ample leisure time, and between the years 1823 and 1849 forty-nine works written or edited by him appeared in London, Dublin, and Norwich. Many of these were controversial publications, written in refutation of [[George Stanley Faber]] and [[Joseph Blanco White]], while others treated of historical, liturgical, or doctrinal matters. Perhaps his most important work is the ''Life of Bishop Milner'', published in 1862; defective as biography, it was a contribution to the history of Catholicism on England. 

In 1852 he brought out, assisted by [[John Polding]], a new edition, with abridged notes, of [[George Leo Haydock]]'s illustrated Bible and he published also editions, for the use of the laity, of the [[Missal]] and the [[vesper-book]]. The "Emblems of Saints" (1850) was one of his best original works, and the style of his pulpit eloquence is well shown by the various sermons which he printed from time to time.

He contributed a large number of uncollected verses to the periodicals of his time. He also published articles on a great variety of subjects in different Catholic journals, and was a lifelong writer in the columns of ''Notes and Queries'', in which more than thirteen hundred contributions appeared over his initials. He was a voluminous letter-writer, and maintained a correspondence with various literary celebrities, and with many distinguished converts of his time. Husenbeth's valuable library collection of crucifixes, reliquaries and similar objects and of letters chiefly on religious subjects, were sold at Norwich a few months after his death. Most of the letters passed into the possession of the [[Bishop of Northampton]].

'''''Freedom of Worship''''' or '''''Freedom to Worship''''' is the second of the ''[[Four Freedoms (Norman Rockwell)|Four Freedoms]]'' oil paintings produced by the American artist [[Norman Rockwell]]. The series was based on the goals known as the [[Four Freedoms]] enunciated by the 32nd President of the United States, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], in his [[State of the Union Address]] delivered on January 6, 1941.  Rockwell considered this painting and ''[[Freedom of Speech (painting)|Freedom of Speech]]'' the most successful of the series. ''Freedom of Worship'' was published on the 27th of February, 1943, issue of ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' alongside an essay by philosopher [[Will Durant]].

==Background==
''Freedom of Worship'' is the second of a series of four oil paintings by [[Norman Rockwell]] entitled ''[[Four Freedoms (Norman Rockwell)|Four Freedoms]]''. The works were inspired by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[State of the Union Address]] delivered to the [[77th United States Congress]] on January 6, 1941, known as [[Four Freedoms]].&lt;ref name="U.S. News &amp; World Report, L.P"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page70.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412075512/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page70.htm|archivedate=April 12, 2008|title=100 Documents That Shaped America:President Franklin Roosevelt's Annual Message (Four Freedoms) to Congress (1941)|accessdate=April 11, 2008|work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Four Freedoms, the only two described in the [[United States Constitution]] are [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref name=FSP&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970203440104574406903628933162|title=Free Speech Personified: Norman Rockwell's inspiring and enduring painting|accessdate=December 31, 2013|date=October 10, 2009|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|author=Cole, Bruce}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Four Freedoms' theme was later incorporated into the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' World War II policy statement, the [[Atlantic Charter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VjcHPR2lfcC&amp;pg=PA49|title=2048: Humanity's Agreement to Live Together|author=Boyd, Kirk|isbn=1-4596-2515-3|page=12|publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mhhecYMgUNsC&amp;pg=PA287|title=The Kravchenko Case: One Man's War on Stalin|author=Kern, Gary|isbn=1-929631-73-1|page=287|publisher=Enigma Books|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became part of the charter of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="U.S. News &amp; World Report, L.P"/&gt; The series of paintings ran on four consecutive weeks in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', accompanied by essays from noted writers: ''[[Freedom of Speech (painting)|Freedom of Speech]]'' (February 20), ''Freedom of Worship'' (February 27), ''[[Freedom from Want (painting)|Freedom from Want]]'' (March 6) and ''[[Freedom from Fear (painting)|Freedom from Fear]]'' (March 13).&lt;ref name=NRFF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countrymanpress.com/titles/NormanRockwellsFourFreedoms.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814161913/http://www.countrymanpress.com/titles/NormanRockwellsFourFreedoms.html|archivedate=August 14, 2007|title=Norman Rockwell's Four Freedoms|accessdate=April 11, 2008|publisher=The Countryman Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the essay accompanying ''Freedom of Worship'', ''Post'' editor Ben Hibbs chose Durant, who was a best-selling author at the peak of his fame. At the time, Durant was in the midst of working on his ten-volume ''[[The Story of Civilization]]'', coauthored with his wife, [[Ariel Durant]]. Will Durant also lectured on history and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the series of paintings became widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the [[Series E bond|U.S. Government War Bond]] Drive.&lt;ref name=AASfaWP&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E5D91E3CF937A25753C1A9679C8B63|title= Art/Architecture; Salve for a Wounded People|accessdate=April 7, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 14, 2001|author=Marling, Karal Ann|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080415212052/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E5D91E3CF937A25753C1A9679C8B63 |archivedate = April 15, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ILTPP/&gt;&lt;ref name=HaK102&gt;Hennessey and Knutson, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{quote box|width=27em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote="The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way—everywhere in the world."|source=—[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s January 6, 1941 [[State of the Union address]] introducing the theme of the [[Four Freedoms]]}}
The painting shows the profiles of eight heads in a modest space. The various figures represent people of different faiths in a moment of prayer. Particularly, three figures on the bottom row (right to left): a man with [[Kippah|his head covered]] carrying a religious book who is [[American Jews|Jewish]], an older woman who is [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestant]], and a younger woman with a well-lit face holding [[rosary beads]] who is [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholic]].&lt;ref name=S209/&gt; In 1966, Rockwell used ''Freedom of Worship'' to show his admiration for [[John F. Kennedy]] in a ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' story illustration entitled ''JFK's Bold Legacy''. The work depicts Kennedy in profile in a composition similar to ''Freedom of Worship'' along with [[Peace Corps]] volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;Murray and McCabe, pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Freedom of Worship original draft.jpg|thumb|The original draft of ''Freedom of Worship'' was set in a barbershop.]]
The original version of the painting was set in a barbershop with patrons of a variety of religions and races all waiting their turn in the barber's chair.&lt;ref name=S207&gt;Solomon, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; His first workup was a {{convert|41|×|33|in|cm|adj=on}} oil on canvas depicting tolerance as "the basis for a democracy's religious diversity". It included a Jew being served by a Protestant barber as a black man and a Roman Catholic priest awaited the barber's services.&lt;ref name=C311&gt;Claridge, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was painting easily recognizable depictions of different religions and races because there was little agreement on what a person of a certain religion should look like.&lt;ref name=HaK100&gt;Hennessey and Knutson, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as he attempted to clarify the characters' depictions he found himself resorting to offensive overexaggeration, especially of the non-clerical characters. Making a Jewish man appear stereotypically Semitic, making a white customer preppy and relegating the black man to agrarian workman attire bogged down the work without speaking on behalf of the government as it should.&lt;ref name=C311-2&gt;Claridge, pp.&amp;nbsp;311–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell's intended theme was religious tolerance, but he felt the original composition did not successfully make this point.&lt;ref name=S209&gt;Solomon, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1942, ''Post'' editor Ben Hibbs became supportive of Rockwell's Four Freedoms sketches,&lt;ref name=AASfaWP/&gt;&lt;ref name=HaK96&gt;Hennessey and Knutson, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; and gave Rockwell two months to complete the works.&lt;ref name=S204&gt;Solomon, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; By October, the ''Post'' was worried about Rockwell's progress on the ''Four Freedoms'' and sent their art editor to Arlington to evaluate. At that time Rockwell was working on ''Freedom of Worship'', his second painting in the series.&lt;ref&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell spent two months (October and most of November 1942)&lt;ref name=S209/&gt; on this work, that was inspired by the phrase "Each according to the dictates of his own conscience." His [[Arlington, Vermont]], neighbors served as his models: Three months pregnant with her hair upbraided, Rose Hoyt posed as a Catholic with a rosary,&lt;ref name=M128&gt;Meyer, pp. 128–33.&lt;/ref&gt; even though she was actually Protestant of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].&lt;ref name=S209/&gt;&lt;ref name=M128/&gt; Other models were a Mrs. Harrington, Rockwell's carpenter Walter Squires, Squire's wife Clara Squires (at the right-hand edge), Winfield Secoy, and Jim Martin (center).&lt;ref name=M128/&gt; His final version relied on other visual clues, including a rosary and a religious book. The work had dark-skinned black worshipers juxtaposed on the edges. This placement did not rock the boat with ''The Post'' who had not yet featured blacks prominently on its pages. Rockwell said he made these ethnics palatable by "'furtively' painting the face of the black woman at the top; the man at the bottom, with his [[fez (hat)|fez]], was too obviously foreign to offend."&lt;ref name=C312/&gt;  The image is commonly enhanced and often darkened in reproduction because it uses a color combination of soft greys, beiges and browns.  The paint was applied thinly, which allows the weave of the canvas to contribute to the image.&lt;ref name="HaK102"/&gt;

Rockwell has stated that he feels hands are second only to heads in importance to the expression of a story. He stated with regards to ''Freedom of Worship'', "I depended on the hands alone to convey about half of the message I wish to put over."&lt;ref&gt;Rockwell, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell's extensive effort on this work was due to his belief that religion "is an extremely delicate subject. It is so easy to hurt so many people's feelings."&lt;ref name=C312/&gt;

==Critical review==
''Post'' editor Ben Hibbs said of ''Speech'' and ''Worship'', "To me they are great human documents in the form of paint and canvas. A great picture, I think is one which moves and inspires millions of people. The ''Four Freedoms'' did&amp;nbsp;— and do."&lt;ref name="MaM 59"&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Disney]] wrote, "I thought your Four Freedoms were great. I especially loved the Freedom of Worship and the composition and symbolism expressed in it."&lt;ref name="MaM 69"&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell believed that ''Freedom of Worship'' and ''[[Freedom of Speech (painting)|Freedom of Speech]]'' were his better results in the series.&lt;ref name=HaK102/&gt; [[Laura Claridge]] has written that the inspirational phrase "Each according to the dictates of his own conscience" is a "platitude that suggests the plurality of Rockwell's own thoughts on religion: its likely source was a phrase included in the ''[[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)|Thirteen Articles of Faith]]'' by [[Joseph Smith]]."&lt;ref name=C312&gt;Claridge, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Rockwell repeatedly asked colleagues about possible sources of the quote and was not told about Smith's writing until after the series was published.&lt;ref name=MaM50/&gt; The expression "according to the dictates of his conscience" (or a similar variation) was used in many United States state constitutions in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZhqOopdewZMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A Blueprint for Judicial Reform|author1=McGuian, Patrick B. |author2=Rader, Randall R.|isbn=978-0-942522-08-2|pages=301–5|publisher=The Free Congress Research and Education Foundation|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical review of the painting shows that some practitioners of particular faiths are disappointed by the acceptance of all faiths expressed in ''Freedom of Religion''.&lt;ref name=ILTPP&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,766759,00.html|title=I Like To Please People|accessdate=April 7, 2008|date=June 21, 1943|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claridge feels that &lt;blockquote&gt;the tight amalgam of faces&amp;nbsp;... and even the crepey skin on elderly hands, which have become the objects of worship, push the theme over the edge from idealistic tolerance into gooey sentiment, where human differences seem caught up in a magical moment of dispensation from the Light. The restraint demanded by art that deals with heightened emotion is lacking.&lt;ref name=C312/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Claridge stated that the earlier version was "clean, impressively sparse, in counterpoise to a dense narrative content. Beautifully painted even at the preliminary oil sketch stage."&lt;ref name=C312&gt;Claridge, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; Murray and McCabe note that the work is a divergence from the "storytelling style" that Rockwell is known for.&lt;ref name=MaM50&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deborah Solomon]] considers the painting the least satisfactory of the series as she feels it is congested and somewhat "didactic".&lt;ref name=S209/&gt;  Maureen Hart Hennessey, chief curator of the [[Norman Rockwell Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/thinktank/bio_1706.html|title=Maureen Hart Hennessey|accessdate=June 29, 2014|publisher=[[PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and curator Anne Knutson consider the scale of the picture that only shows heads and hands in prayer as disruptive.&lt;ref name=HaK100/&gt; Bruce Cole of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' noted that Rockwell's "depiction of spectral close-up faces and hands raised in prayer is bland, without any real message about religious freedom—again, no wallop. This is because faith, like the absence of fear and the absence of want, is essentially private, something personal, intangible and unpicturable."&lt;ref name="FSP"/&gt;

A '''Hindu wedding''' is ''Vivaha'' ([[Sanskrit]]: विवाह&lt;ref&gt;''Sanskrit English Dictionary'', [http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=vivAha&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 entry for '''Vivaha''']. Germany: University of Koeln.&lt;/ref&gt;) and the wedding ceremony is called ''Vivaah Sanskar'' in [[ Administrative divisions of India #The six regions | North India]] and ''Kalyanam'' (generally) in [[ Administrative divisions of India #The six regions | South India]].&lt;ref name=bbc2009&gt;Prinja, N. (2009 August 24). [http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/ritesrituals/weddings.shtml Hinduism &amp; Weddings]. London, UK: BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rjb1969&gt;Pandey, R. (1969). ''Hindu Saṁskāras: Socio-religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments'', see Chapter&amp;nbsp;VIII, pp.&amp;nbsp;153&amp;ndash;233. {{ISBN|978-8120803961}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hindus attach a great deal of importance to [[marriage]]. The wedding ceremonies are very colourful, and celebrations may extend for several days. The bride's and groom's home—entrance, doors, wall, floor, roof—are sometimes decorated with colors, balloons, and other decorations.&lt;ref name=ft2008&gt;Yee, A. (2008 May 17) [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/7498e59c-2233-11dd-a50a-000077b07658.html#axzz2aqrbE3eF Sari nights and henna parties]. ''The Financial Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rituals and process in a Hindu wedding vary widely. Nevertheless, the Hindu wedding ceremony at its core is essentially a [[Vedic]] ''[[yajna]]'' ritual and three key rituals are almost universal: ''[[Kanyadaan (in hindu wedding)|Kanyadaan]]'', ''[[Panigrahana]]'', and ''[[Saptapadi]]''—which are respectively, giving away of his daughter by the father, voluntarily holding hands near the fire to signify union, and taking seven ‘steps before fire’.  (Each ‘step’ is a complete circuit of the fire.)  

At each step promises are made by (in the long form—see below) each to the other.&lt;ref name=jgl2001/&gt; The primary witness of a Hindu marriage is the fire-deity (or the Sacred Fire) ''[[Agni]]'', in the presence of family and friends.&lt;ref name=historyindia2011&gt;

Bajpai, S. (2011). [http://www.himalayanacademy.com/media/books/the-history-of-hindu-india/the-history-of-hindu-india.pdf ''The History of India - From Ancient to Modern Times''], pp.&amp;nbsp;4, 73&amp;ndash;74. Hawaii: Himalayan Academy Publications, {{ISBN|978-1-934145-38-8}}.

&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony is traditionally conducted entirely or at least partially in [[Sanskrit]], considered by [[Hindu]]s as the language of holy ceremonies. The local language of the bride and groom may also be used. The rituals are prescribed in the [[Baudhayana sutras|''Gruhya sutra'']] composed by various ''[[rishis]]'' such as ''[[Baudhayana]]'' and ''[[Ashvalayana]]''. 

The pre-wedding and post-wedding rituals and celebrations vary by region, preference and the resources of the groom, bride and their families. They can range from one day to multi-day events. Pre-wedding ceremonies include [[engagement]], which involves  ''vagdana'' (betrothal) and ''lagna-patra'' (written declaration),&lt;ref name=rjb1969/&gt; and the arrival of the groom's party at the bride's residence, often as a formal procession with dancing and music. The post-wedding ceremonies may include ''[[Abhisheka|Abhishek]]'', ''[[Anna Prashashan]]'', ''[[Aashirvadah]]'', and ''[[Grihapravesa]]'' &amp;ndash; the welcoming of the bride to her new home. The wedding marks the start of the ''[[Grihastha]]'' (householder) [[Ashrama (stage)| stage of life]] for the new couple.

In India, by law and tradition, no Hindu marriage is binding or complete unless the ritual of seven steps and vows in presence of fire (''Saptapadi'') is completed by the bride and the groom together.&lt;ref name=thmagoi/&gt; This requirement is under debate, given that several Hindu communities (such as the [[Nair|Nayar]]s of [[Kerala]] or [[Bunt (community)|Bunt]]s of [[Tulu Nadu]]) do not observe these rites.&lt;ref name=menski2001/&gt;

==Eight forms of marriage==
[[File:Hindu Bride, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.jpg|200px|thumb|upright=0.8|A Hindu bride during her wedding.]]
[[File:Tamil Brahmin Hindu Marraige.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Hindu marriage ceremony.]]

Ancient Hindu literature, in for example the ''[[Asvalayana Grhyasutra]]'' and ''[[Atharvaveda]]'', identifies eight forms of marriage.&lt;ref name=rjb1969/&gt;  They are traditionally presented, as here, in order of religious appropriateness (''prashasta'').  They also differ very widely in social acceptability.&lt;ref name=jgl2001&gt;Lochtefeld, J.G. (2001). ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A&amp;ndash;M'', p.&amp;nbsp;427. {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tribune2011&gt;staff article. (September 2011). Eight forms of Hindu Marriage and its custom. ''India Tribune''.&lt;/ref&gt;  (Legal aspects are regulated mainly by the [[Hindu Marriage Act, 1955]].)

* ''Brahma'' marriage &amp;ndash; considered the religiously most appropriate marriage, and the most prevalent among Hindus in modern India.  The father finds an educated man and proposes the marriage of his daughter to him. The groom, bride and families freely concur with the proposal. The two families and relatives meet, the daughter is ceremonially decorated, the father gives away his daughter in betrothal, and a Vedic marriage ceremony is conducted. &lt;ref name=jgl2001/&gt;
* ''Daiva'' marriage &amp;ndash; the father gives away his daughter along with ornaments to a priest as a sacrificial fee. This form of marriage occurred in ancient times when ''yajna'' sacrifices were prevalent.
* ''Arsha'' marriage &amp;ndash; the groom gives a cow and a bull to the father of the bride and the father exchanges his daughter in marriage. The groom takes a vow to fulfill his obligations to the bride and family life{{clarification needed|date=November 2018}} (''[[Grihastha |Grihasthashram]]'').
* ''Prajapatya'' {{clarify | etymology?  Does the word mean something like “people’s ceremony”?|date=November 2018}}marriage &amp;ndash; a couple agree to be married by exchanging some {{clarify | which?  Same as / similar to the Saptapadi vows given below?|date=November 2018}}Sanskrit mantras (vows to each other). This form of marriage is akin to a civil ceremony.

The above four forms of marriage were considered socially proper, and religiously appropriate &amp;ndash; ''prashasta'' &amp;ndash; under Hinduism, since the rituals include vows from [[Vedic]] scriptures.  Both bride and groom commit to each other and share responsibilities to their families. The remaining four do not include vows and were considered ''aprashasta'' (inappropriate). &lt;ref name=rjb1969/&gt;&lt;ref name=jgl2001/&gt; Among these, two were socially acceptable:

* [[Gandharva marriage|''Gandharva'' marriage]]{{snd}}the couple simply live together out of love, by mutual consent, consensually consummating their relationship. The marriage is entered into without religious ceremonies, and is akin to the Western concept of [[Common-law marriage]].  The [[Kama Sutra]], and, in the [[Mahabharata]], Rishi Kanva, the foster-father of [[Shakuntala]], claim that this form of marriage is ideal.&lt;ref name=rjb1969/&gt;&lt;ref name=tribune2011/&gt;
* ''[[Asura]]'' marriage &amp;ndash; the groom offers a dowry to the father of the bride and to the bride; both accept the dowry out of free will, and he receives the bride in exchange. This is akin to marrying off a daughter for money, and is considered inappropriate by Hindu Smriti-writers because greed, not what is best for the woman, can corrupt the selection process.&lt;ref name=rjb1969/&gt;

The last two forms of marriage were not only inappropriate, but religiously forbidden:

* ''Rakshasa'' marriage &amp;ndash; where the groom forcibly abducts the bride against her will and her family's will. (The word ''[[Rakshasa]]'' means “devil”.)
* ''[[Pishacha|Paishacha]]'' marriage &amp;ndash; where the man forces himself on a woman when she is insentient: when she is drugged or drunken or unconscious.

James Lochtefeld comments that these last two forms were forbidden but the marriages themselves were still recognized in ancient Hindu societies, not to allow these acts but rather to provide the woman and any resulting children with legal protection in the society.&lt;ref name=jgl2001/&gt;

==Key rituals==
{{Main article|Vivaah}}
There is no single standard Hindu marriage ceremony.  Regional variation is prevalent in the sequence of rituals comprising the ceremony.  There is also considerable flexibility within each ritual.  Variation reflects family traditions, local traditions, resources of the families and other factors.  Three key rituals predominate, as follows.&lt;ref name=jgl2001/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kane, V. (1962). ''History of Dharmasastra''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy, R. (2004). ''Saptapadi &amp;ndash; The Seven Steps''. University of Canterbury, UK: Ph.D. Thesis.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two are ''yajna''.&lt;ref name=historyindia2011/&gt;

* ''Kanyadaan'' &amp;ndash; the giving away of his daughter by the father.
* ''Panigrahana'' &amp;ndash; a ritual in presence of fire, where the groom takes the bride's hand as a sign of their union.
* ''Saptapadi'' &amp;ndash; the crucial ritual.  The term means ‘seven steps’, with each step corresponding (in the Long Form) to a pair of vows: groom to bride, and  bride to groom. The vows are pronounced in Sanskrit; sometimes also{{clarify |’’ie’’ the parties recite each vow in both languages? 7 steps x 2 parties x 2 language, = 28 vows??  Or sometimes ‘’instead’’ the vows are spoken in the parties’ language rather than in Sanskrit?|date=November 2018}} in the language of the couple.   (For the Short Form see below.)  Like ''Panigrahana'', Saptapadi is performed in presence of fire, and in many weddings, after each of their seven oaths to each other, the groom and bride perform the ritual of ''agnipradakshinam'': walking around the fire, with hands linked or with the ends of their garments tied together. The groom usually leads the bride in the walk.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, A. (1985). Marriage in the Hindu religious tradition. ''Journal of Ecumenical Studies'', 22&amp;nbsp;(1), 69&amp;ndash;80.&lt;/ref&gt; {{clarify | “groom usually leads”: really?  Or is this how it goes in the Long Form?  For the Short Form, the account in the relevant subsection gives the opposite impression.  All the examples of regional usage there have the bride leading at least the first circuit.

|date=November 2018}}  Fire is the divine witness (to the marriage),&lt;ref name=historyindia2011/&gt; and after Saptapadi the couple are considered husband and wife.

===Kanyadaan===
[[File:KanyaDaan.jpg|thumb|''Kanyadaan'' &amp;ndash; a key ritual where the father gifts away the daughter to the groom. In this picture, the father's hand is on the left, the bride and groom are on the right.]]
The Kanyadaan ceremony is performed by the bride’s father.&lt;ref name=prabhu2011/&gt; If the father has died, a guardian of the bride's choosing performs the ritual. The father brings the daughter, then takes the bride's hand and places it in the groom's. This marks the beginning of the ceremony of giving away the bride. The groom accepts the bride's hand, while the ''kama-sukta'' (hymn to love) is pronounced, in the presence of the father, the bride and the groom. The ''Kamasukta'' verse is:&lt;ref name=prabhu2011&gt;Prabhu, P.H. (2011). ''Hindu Social Organization'', pp.&amp;nbsp;164&amp;ndash;165. {{ISBN|978-8171542062}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''Who offered this maiden?, to whom is she offered?''
''Kama (the god of love) gave her to me, that I may love her''
''Love is the giver, love is the acceptor''
''Enter thou, the bride, the ocean of love''

''With love then, I receive thee''
''May she remain thine, thine own, O god of love''
''Verily, thou art, prosperity itself''
''May the heaven bestow thee, may the earth receive thee''
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After this ritual recital, the father asks the groom to not fail the bride in his pursuit of ''dharma'' (moral and lawful life), ''artha'' (wealth) and ''kama'' (love). The groom promises to the bride's father that he shall never fail her in his pursuit of ''dharma'', ''artha'' and ''kama''.&lt;ref name=kanew/&gt; The groom repeats the promise three times.

This repeated promise by the groom marks the end of the ''kanyadaan'' ritual in the Hindu wedding.

===Panigrahana===
[[File:Hindu wedding ceremony fire.jpg|right|thumb|A [[yajna]] during a Hindu wedding]]
The ritual of ''Panigrahana'' comes after ''Kanyadaan''.  It is sometimes preceded by the ''vivaha-homa'' rite, wherein a symbolic fire is lit by the groom to mark the start of a new household.&lt;ref name=prabhu2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, M.M. (1893). ''Indian wisdom; or, Examples of the religious, philosophical, and ethical doctrines of the Hindus''. London: Luzac &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Panigrahana'' is the 'holding the hand' ritual&lt;ref name=jgl2001/&gt; as a symbol of the bride and groom’s impending marital union, with the groom acknowledging responsibility to four deities: Bhaga signifying wealth, Aryama signifying heavens/milky way, Savita signifying radiance/new beginning, and Purandhi signifying wisdom. The groom faces west, and while the bride sits in front of him, with her face to the east, he holds her hand while the following [[Rigveda|Rig ved]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;ic mantra is recited:&lt;ref name=rjb1969/&gt;&lt;ref name=prabhu2011/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''I take thy hand in mine, yearning for happiness''
''I ask thee, to live with me, as thy husband''
''Till both of us, with age, grow old''

''Know this, as I declare, that the Gods''
''Bhaga, Aryama, Savita and Purandhi, have bestowed thy person, upon me''
''that I may fulfill, my Dharmas of the householder, with thee''

''This I am, That art thou''
''The Sāman I, the Ŗc thou''
''The Heavens I, the Earth thou''
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the Gujarati Wedding{{clarify | is the “Gujarati Wedding” really something distinct?  Or is this merely an aspect of the familiar regional variability? so all we need to say is “In Gujarat”?  (Actually, is this too much detail anyway??|date=November 2018}} this step is called ''Hast-Milap'' (literally, “meeting of hands”). The whole ceremony{{clarify | in Gujarat? or generally?|date=November 2018}} was{{clarify | used to be? or still often is?|date=November 2018}} timed around an auspicious time (''Mauhurat'') for this step and a few decades ago the wedding invitation would even list the time when this event was going to take place.

===Saptapadi – Short Form===
{{Main article|Saptapadi}}
[[File:Indian wedding.jpg|thumb|A Hindu couple in post-marriage ceremonies, after ''Saptapadi''. The tied clothing, represents lifelong bond formed during the seven promises ritual with fire as witness.]]
The ''Saptapadi'' (Sanskrit “seven steps”/“seven feet”; sometimes called ''Saat Phere'': “seven rounds”&lt;ref&gt;

In some South Indian weddings, after each saying a mantra at each of the seven steps, the couple say these words together:

:"''Now let us make a vow together. We shall share love, share the same food, share our strengths, share the same tastes. We shall be of one mind, we shall observe the vows together.

In North Indian weddings, the bride and the groom say the following words after completing the seven steps:
:''We have taken the Seven Steps. You have become mine forever. Yes, we have become partners. I have become yours. Hereafter, I cannot live without you. Do not live without me. Let us share the joys. We are word and meaning, united. You are thought and I am sound. May the night be honey-sweet for us. May the morning be honey-sweet for us. May the earth be honey-sweet for us. May the heavens be honey-sweet for us. May the plants be honey-sweet for us. May the sun be all honey for us. May the cows yield us honey-sweet milk.

===Saptapadi – Long Form===
The long form of ''Saptapadi'' starts with a preface announced by the priest, introducing a series of vows the groom and bride make to each other,&lt;ref&gt;

Misra, R. (1939). ''Sri Saptapadi Hridayam''. Bharatpur, India: Amrit Vagbhava Acharya.

&lt;/ref&gt; as follows.  With the completion of the seventh step the two become husband and wife.


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
;Priest's preface
''The world of men and women, united in the bond of marriage by Saptapadi, to further promote the joy of life, together listen with triumph.''

;Step 1
Groom's vow: ''Oh!, you who feeds life-sustaining food, nourish my visitors, friends, parents and offsprings with food and drinks. Oh! beautiful lady, I, as a form of Vishnu, take this first step with you for food.''
Bride's vow: ''Yes, whatever food you earn with hard work, I will safeguard it, prepare it to nourish you. I promise to respect your wishes, and nourish your friends and family as well.''

;Step 2
Groom's vow: ''Oh!, thoughtful and beautiful lady, with a well managed home, with purity of behavior and thought, you will enable us to be strong, energetic and happy. Oh! beautiful lady, I, as Vishnu, take this second step with you for the strength of body, character and being.''
Bride's vow: ''Yes, I will manage the home according to my ability and reason. Together, I promise, to keep a home that is healthy, strength and energy giving.''

;Step 3
Groom's vow: ''Oh!, skillful and beautiful lady, I promise to devote myself to earning a livelihood by fair means, to discuss, and let you manage and preserve our wealth. Oh! dear lady, I, as Vishnu form, cover this third step with you to thus prosper in our wealth.''
Bride's vow: ''Yes, I join you in managing our income and expenses. I promise to seek your consent, as I manage our wealth, fairly earned, so it grows and sustains our family.''

;Step 4
Groom's vow: ''Oh!, dear lady, I promise to trust your decisions about the household and your choices; I promise to dedicate myself to help our community prosper, the matters outside the house. This shall bring us respect. Oh! my lady, I, as Vishnu, take this fourth step with you to participate in our world.''
Bride's vow: ''Yes, I promise to strive to make the best home for us, anticipate and provide necessary things for your worldly life, and for the happiness of our family.''

;Step 5
Groom's vow: ''Oh!, lady of skill and pure thoughts, I promise to consult with you and engage you in the keep of our cows, our agriculture and our source of income; I promise to contribute to our country. It shall win us future. Oh! my skilled lady, I, as Vishnu form, take this fifth step with you to together grow our farms and cattle.''
Bride's vow: ''Yes, I promise to participate and protect the cattle, our agriculture and business. They are a source of yoghurt, milk, ghee, and income, all useful for our family, necessary for our happiness.''

;Step 6
Groom's vow: ''Oh!, lovely lady, I seek you and only you, to love, to have children, to raise a family, to experience all the seasons of life. Oh! my lovely lady, I, as Vishnu, take this sixth step with you to experience every season of life.''
Bride's vow: ''Feeling one with you, with your consent, I will be the means of your enjoyment of all the senses. Through life's seasons, I will cherish you in my heart. I will worship you and seek to complete you.''

;Step 7
Groom's vow: ''Oh friends!, allow us to cover the seventh step together, this promise, our Saptapad-friendship. Please be my constant wife.''
Bride's vow: ''Yes, today, I gained you, I secured the highest kind of friendship with you. I will remember the vows we just took and adore you forever sincerely with all my heart.''
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Additional rituals==
[[File:Hindu wedding couple.jpg|thumb|Hindu wedding with the bride and groom in traditional dress.]]
[[File:University Park MMB 16 Nightingale Hall.jpg|thumb|Some Indian weddings abroad symbolically maintain some of the customs in India. Above is a symbolic arrival of the groom on a horse (''[[baraat]]''), in Nottingham, England. In front is the band.]]
Many Hindu weddings start with the ''[[ Milne (Hindu ritual) | milne]]'' (meeting) and ''[[ Swagatam (Hindu ritual) | swagatam]]'' (welcome) ceremony. This ritual is where the ''[[baraat]]'' (groom's procession party) arrives at the bride's home or the location where the bride is and marriage will be celebrated. The ''baraat'' typically includes dancing and joyous members of groom's family, relatives and friends. On their arrival, there is a ritual where key persons from the groom's side and bride's side are introduced to each other. The introduction is typically followed by ''jai mala'' (garland exchange between bride and groom) and a reception that serves food and drinks. 

Many other rituals and ceremonies are sometimes found in Hindu weddings, such as ''[[Vivaah #Madhuparka ceremony | madhuparka]]'', ''[[ Vivaah #Vivaah Homa (sacred fire ritual) | vivaah-homa]]'', ''[[agni-parinayana]]'', ''[[Vivaah #Ashmarohanam (stepping on the grinding stone) | asmarohana]]'', ''[[Vivaah #Laaja Homam | laja homa]]'', ''abhishek'', ''anna-prashashan'', and ''aashir-vadah''.&lt;ref name=rjb1969/&gt;&lt;ref name=kanew/&gt; All these ceremonies are carried out at the wedding location, typically at or near the bride's home.&lt;ref name=ft2008/&gt; These additional rituals include the participation of the brothers, sisters, maternal/paternal relatives, guardians, or friends of the bride.

In some parts of India, such as Gujarat and Northern India, a ''laja homa'' ritual called ''mangal pherā'' is performed where the couple make four circles around holy fire. It follows ''hasta milap'' (meeting of hands of the couple), but precedes ''saptapadi''.  The first three circles is led by the groom, and it represents three of four goals of life considered important in Hindu life &amp;ndash; ''Dharma'', ''Artha'', ''Kama''. The fourth circle is led by bride and it represents the fourth goal of life &amp;ndash; ''Moksha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{

Some rituals involve&lt;ref name=kanew/&gt; rice or other grains, seeds and pastes. In these ceremonies, rice is thrown at the bride, groom or they kick a container containing the grain. Rituals include ''darshan'', where the newly married couple are met, blessed and greeted by family and friends of the bride and groom.&lt;ref name=pauwels/&gt;

After the Hindu wedding is complete, the bride leaves for groom's home via groom's car. In groom's car, bride and groom sit together, and groom's younger brother drive the car. bride's two sister also come with groom's family, when they arrive to groom house where Hindu family members of the groom welcome the newly wedded couple in a ritual known as ''grihapravesa'' (home coming/entry).&lt;ref name=prabhu2011/&gt; This ceremony typically requires participation of the mother, father, brothers, and sisters, or other guardians of the groom.

&lt;/ref&gt; suggests the Hindu couple spent time with each other, but delayed the consummation for at least three nights following the wedding. Some scholars have proposed the observance of this rite in the past &amp;ndash; known as ''chaturthikarma'' &amp;ndash; “the rite performed on the fourth day of marriage”. Chaturthikarma is followed by most of South Indian communities&lt;ref&gt;

===Rituals in Nepal===
[[File:Nepali Bride.jpg|thumb|The bride is ceremoniously decorated, in Hindu weddings, by her friends and family in regional dress, jewelry, and body art called ''[[Mehndi]]''. The body art is produced from a mixture of henna and turmeric. Above a Nepali bride.]]
In the Hindu culture of [[Nepal]], marriage rituals are done by the ''Chhetri'' in a sixteen step process that centers on the household. The household is important during the marriage ritual because it is the center of the concept of ''mandala''; the Chhetri's homes are considered to be domestic mandalas and so have roles as householders. The act of marriage brings men and women into the householder role. Marriage is the most important rite of passage for the Chhetris and is one of the most serious. Women move from their houses to the home of the groom after marriage. The ceremony is done in a precise and careful manner as to not bring bad luck to the families of the bride and groom; certain traditions, for example no one seeing the face of the bride until the end, are followed in order to ensure future prosperity. Prior to the marriage ceremony, there is no kinship between families of the bride and groom and the bride must be a virgin. The marriage ceremony consists of a series of rites that are performed over a two-day period between the houses of the bride and the groom. Within each home the enclosed area in the courtyard (''jagya'') and the kitchen are used the most; the jagya and the kitchen are considered the most important parts of the domestic mandala structure because it is where rice (an important part of the Chhetri's culture) is prepared and consumed. At the end of the ceremony is the establishment of the role of the wife and husband in the husband's home.&lt;ref name="Gray 45–60"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gray|first=J.|title=Marriage ritual in Nepal: Space, performance in tacit knowledge|journal=Journal of Ritual Studies|date=2009|volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=45&amp;ndash;60 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first step in the marriage ceremony is called ''Purbanga''. In the kitchen of their homes, the bride and the groom worship the seven Mother Goddesses as so to pay respect to their ancestors and ask for peace. In the second, third, and fourth step, the groom is then blessed by his mother and is taken outside to his jagya where his father and procession (''janti'') carry him and bring gifts for the bride to her house in a ceremony called dulähä anmäune. In the fifth step as the groom waits before the house of the bride, gifts of clothes and food are placed around the jagya; the father of the bride then places red paste on the groom's forehead indicating that he is no longer an outsider to his family. The sixth step is the performance of the ''Barani'' or welcoming for the groom and his janti as they enter the jagya. The father purifies the body of the groom using panchämrit (nectar from five pure liquids). A small feast is then held for the groom as the next steps in the marriage continue.&lt;ref name="Gray 45–60"/&gt;

After the small feast, the marriage process for the bride begins. The seventh step takes place in the kitchen of the bride where the process of ''kanya dan'' starts; the bride's parents give their daughter in marriage to her groom thereby allowing the bride to be a part of the groom's lineage and making the father's lineage secondary. After they wash their feet they dress in red and, in the eighth step, sit beside in each other in the jagya. They perform post-marriage rites as they make sacrificial offerings to the fire in the center of the jagya. During these rites the bride and groom perform tasks such as placing red powder in the hair of the bride and the bride eats leftover food of the groom and at the end the now husband gives his wife a personal name for which she is to be called by.&lt;ref name="Gray 45–60"/&gt;

After the post-marriage ceremony, the married couple being to leave the bride's home. In the ninth step, the husband and wife return to the kitchen of the wife and worship their ancestors and the seven Mother Goddesses. In the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth step, the couple leave the wife's house as she is given a garland from her parents; the wife and husband enter the jagya and are then escorted out riding on palanquins as they return to their permanent home of the husband. The thirteenth step beings once they enter the jagya of the groom and his virgin sisters welcome the wife in a ceremony called ''arti syäl''. They unveil the bride and adorn her with flower garlands and sprinkle puffed rice on her (a sign of prosperity). The fourteenth step is completed once the bride promises gifts to the sisters; she then moves on the fifteenth step where she steps on piles of rice in a path toward the kitchen. The final step is a series of rites, the first of which is the bride worshiping the ancestors and deities of the husband; she then demonstrates her skills in handling rice to the husband's mother and sisters and then they entwine her hair. Finally, the mother unveils the bride again in front of the husband and in a ceremony called ''khutta dhog'', the bride places the foot of the mother on her forehead thereby ending the marriage ceremony.&lt;ref name="Gray 45–60"/&gt;

==Wedding and Married Life in Hinduism==
While there are many rituals in Hinduism, such as those at birth and deaths of loved ones, the Hindu wedding is the most important and extensive personal ritual an adult Hindu undertakes in his or her life.&lt;ref name=rjb1969/&gt; Typical Hindu families spend significant effort and financial resources to prepare and celebrate weddings.

===Economics===
In 2008, Indian weddings market was estimated to be $31 billion a year.&lt;ref name=ft2008/&gt; Various sources estimate India celebrates about 10 million weddings per year,&lt;ref&gt;CBS News. (2012 February 12). [http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57376057/indias-love-affair-with-gold/ India's love affair with gold].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kitco Metals Inc. (2013 July 23). [http://www.kitco.com/ind/Zimnisky/2013-07-23-India-the-Rupee-Import-Duties-Gold-and-Diamonds.html India, the Rupee, Import Duties, Gold and Diamonds]. New York: Kitco Metals.&lt;/ref&gt; and over 80% of these are Hindu weddings. The average expenditures exceed US$3,000 per wedding. Another $30 billion per year is spent on jewelry in India,&lt;ref&gt;IBEF &amp;ndash; a trust established by the government of India. (May 2013). [http://www.ibef.org/industry/gems-jewellery-india.aspx Gems and jewelry industry in India].&lt;/ref&gt; with jewelry for weddings being the predominant market. In a nation with per capita annual income of $1,500,&lt;ref&gt;International Monetary Fund (IMF). (February 2013). [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2013/cr1337.pdf India - Country Report 13/37]. Washington DC: IMF.&lt;/ref&gt; weddings are a major financial burden for the typical Hindu family.

===Law===
In India, where most Hindus live, the laws relating to marriage differ by religion. According to the [[Hindu Marriage Act]] of 1955, passed by the [[Parliament of India]], for all legal purposes, all Hindus of any caste, creed or sect, Sikh, Buddhists and Jains are deemed Hindus and can [[Inter caste marriage|intermarry]]. By the [[Special Marriage Act, 1954]], a Hindu can marry a person who is not Hindu, employing any ceremony, provided specified legal conditions are fulfilled. By Section&amp;nbsp;7 of Hindu Marriage Act, and tradition, no Hindu marriage is binding and complete before the seventh step of the ''Saptapadi'' ritual, in presence of fire, by the bride and the groom together.&lt;ref name=menski2001&gt;Menski, W. (2001). ''Modern Indian Family Law'', p.&amp;nbsp;26. Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700713165}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as South Indian Hindu marriages, this is not required.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Married life===
A Vedic sage emphasized that the basis of happy and fulfilling married life is the sense of unity, intimacy and love between husband and wife both physically, mentally and spiritually. Hence wife is considered to be the '''Ardhangani''' of husband as per Hindu tradition. Marriage is not for self-indulgence, but is considered a lifelong social and spiritual responsibility. Married life is considered an opportunity for two people to grow as life partners into soul-mates.&lt;ref&gt;Jyoti, A. (2003 Mar-Apr).

In the Homeric works humans indirectly control their destiny by their actions and decisions. Homer allows his heroic mortals to stand close to the gods. Characters communicate with their gods through prayers, in an act which merges the divine world of the epic creation with that of mankind. Gods usually hear, often react and sometimes grant human prayers in epic poetry. “But Zeus does not bring to accomplishment all thoughts in men’s minds” (Iliad, XVIII 328), as Achilleus stresses in admitting humanity’s restrained power.

==The Power of Prayer==

Homeric prayers, signaling moments at which the fictional characters face extreme threats, can and do determine the events of the plot. The prayers of the heroes seek specific tangible benefits from the gods expressing their belief that the gods superintend mortals, sympathize with them, become involved in human affairs, answer their prayers or deny their wishes. In literature an included prayer externalizes sentiments of panic or highlights pivotal moments in the narrative. Prayer becomes more than a mere verbal expression of one’s wish; it is a means to channel feelings, thoughts, energy, spiritual tension, a ritual which if performed as an act of honor or duty is powerful enough to change the course of the world of the epic creation with only constraint the mortal characters' inevitable fatal end. 

Phoinix, a fictional character in the Iliad, commenting upon the power of prayer reinforces that: “the very immortals can be moved; their virtue and honor and strength are greater than ours are, / and yet with sacrifices and offerings for endearment, / with libations and with savor men turn back even the immortals / in supplication, when any man does wrong and transgresses” (Iliad, IX 497-501)

==The Prayer of Power==

Formal Greek prayer in the epic poems attributed to Homer is ritualized and consists of four basic stages: cleansing, prayer, sacrifice  and libation . Acts and gestures form part of the homeric prayer as much as words do. The characters wash their hands, purifying themselves in the context of catharsis. They attain an appropriate posture, lift their arms. They address their gods directly, praise the divine admitting the omnipotence of the Olympians and thus the cosmic hierarchy. They remind the gods of the already established relationship between the supplicant and the divine in an effort to deem themselves worthy of their god’s attention. The characters are now ready to verbally announce their noble wish to be granted and proceed to offer mostly in form of a sacrifice an act of submission.

==Examples in the Iliad==

In his prayer to Apollo (Iliad, I, 445-457), [[Chryses]], a priest of the god in a Trojan-allied town in the Iliad, washes his hands and lifts his hands prior to requesting fulfillment of his wish. He admits his lower status in relation to the all mighty god, “who set your power about Chryse and Killa the sacrosanct, who are lord in strength over Tenedos” (Iliad, I, 451-3); the gods’ ruling over humanity is accepted. 

Similar is Achilleus' prayer to [[Zeus]]. The great hero holds a ritual, purifies himself, pours wine to his god, addresses Zeus in words of commendation and admits the nobler nature of the divinity through contrasting the father of gods with the unpurified humans of “unwashed feet”.

Glaukos, co-leader of the Lycian forces, (XVI, 533) prays on the battlefield requesting healing of his wounds to “fight for Sarpedon”. The practical part of the rite is not performed.

In the Trojan women's prayer to Athena in the sixth book of the Iliad, Hekabe seems to mechanically carry out the ritual without realizing the significance of its constituent stages, which diminishes the spirituality of her actions. She is about to offer “honey sweet wine, to pour out a libation to father Zeus and the other immortals ” (Iliad, VI, 258-9 ) to Hektor who has not previously been cleansed to participate in the ritual. Offering is encountered in the form of a material gift, a robe, to Athene. The priestess lifts the hands to the sky, home of gods, and exalts Athena as “shining among the goddesses”.

'''Ichadon''' (501–527; Hanja: 異次頓), also known as '''Geochadon''' (Hanja: 居次頓) or by his [[courtesy name]] '''Yeomchok''' (Hanja: 厭觸) or '''Yeomdo'''(Hanja: 厭都), was a Buddhist monk and advisor to the [[Silla]] king [[Beopheung of Silla|Beopheung]].

==Miracle==
Early in his reign, Beopheung had desired to promulgate Buddhism as the state religion. However, officials in his court opposed him. In the fourteenth year of his reign, Beopheung's "Grand Secretary", Ichadon, devised a strategy to overcome court opposition.  Ichadon schemed with the king, convincing him to make a proclamation granting Buddhism official state sanction using the royal seal.  Ichadon told the king to deny having made such a proclamation when the opposing officials received it and demanded an explanation.  Instead, Ichadon would confess and accept the punishment of execution, for what would quickly be seen as a forgery.

Ichadon prophesied to the king that at his execution a wonderful miracle would convince the opposing court faction of Buddhism's power. Ichadon's scheme went as planned, and the opposing officials took the bait.  When Ichadon was executed on the 15th day of the 9th month in 527, his prophecy was fulfilled; the earth shook, the sun was darkened, beautiful flowers rained from the sky, his severed head flew to the sacred [[Kumgang-san|Geumgang mountains]], and milk instead of blood sprayed 100 feet in the air from his beheaded corpse.  The omen was accepted by the opposing court officials as a manifestation of heaven's approval, and Buddhism was made the state religion in 527 CE.  Ichadon's body was then taken to the Geumgang mountains and buried there with respect. His martyrdom led to the construction of Heungryun monastery, Silla's first state-sponsored temple.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10311">The '''Indian Shaker Church''' is a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Christian denomination|denomination]] founded in 1881 by [[Squaxin Island Tribe|Squaxin]] shaman [[John Slocum]] and his wife [[Mary Slocum]] in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington State]]. The Indian Shaker Church is a unique blend of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]], [[Catholic]], and [[Protestant]] beliefs and practices.

The Indian Shakers are unrelated to the [[Shakers]] of New England (United Society of Believers) and are not to be confused with the [[Native American Church]].

==History and practices==

As tradition tells, John Slocum (Squ-sacht-um) had died from sickness in 1881 when he revived during his [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] reporting a visit to heaven, where he was told by an angel that, "you've been a pretty bad Indian", and where he received instructions to start a new religion.&lt;ref&gt;Ruby, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; When Slocum became ill again several months later, his wife, Mary, began to shake and tremble uncontrollably in prayer. Soon afterward, Slocum recovered and his healing was attributed to Mary's convulsions.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, pp. 115-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The religion is thus named for the shaking of members during religious congregations.&lt;ref&gt;Ruby, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; The shaking is reported to have healing powers.&lt;ref&gt;Ruby, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

The story is told that Mary had sent for a casket. John was dead. The casket was brought by canoe, down the river. The casket was just coming around the bend in the river when John revived. ... and told the people he had met Jesus and what they were to do.

The [[List of Indian Shaker Church buildings in Washington#Mud Bay church|first church]] was built at [[Mud Bay, Thurston County, Washington|Mud Bay]] outside [[Olympia, Washington]] near the homes of church co-founders and brothers Mud Bay Louie and Mud Bay Sam.{{sfn|Steele|1957|p=11}}{{sfn|Mooney|1896|pp=754 and 758}}

Indian Shakers originally rejected the [[Bible]] and all other written scriptures and instead relied on direct communication between God and the individual. Such Shakers believe that the experience of the Gospel does not require a book, but rather is encoded in the mind and soul in accordance with the will of God.  The religion began to be practiced by many unrelated peoples along the Northwest Coast of North America, such as the [[Klallam]], [[Quinault (tribe)|Quinault]], [[Lower Chehalis]], [[Yakama]], [[Hoh]], [[Quileute (tribe)|Quileute]], [[Wiyot]], [[Yurok]], and [[Hupa]], among others.

Practices reflecting Catholic influence include the use of hand-held candles, the ringing of individual hand bells (to a very loud volume), and the [[sign of the cross]] (usually repeated three  times).  Protestant influence is shown in public testifying and confession of shortcomings.  Native elements include brushing or stroking to remove evil influence, counter-clockwise movement of service participants around the room (often with loud stomping), and spontaneous reception of songs from the spirit.  Church members are expected to refrain from using alcohol and tobacco.  Carefulness, kindness, and supplication to God for help are emphasized.

The new religion encountered much opposition and hostility from Euro-Americans. As had happened with the [[Ghost Dance]], there was much misunderstanding and Anglos feared an Indian uprising. For a time, all Indian religious practices were banned by law and the Indian Shakers were included. Many members were imprisoned and chained for their practices.  Powell et al. (1976) show two notices posted by the US Indian Service at [[Quileute (tribe)|Quileute]] Reservation:
&lt;!--- What's the date on this? ---&gt;

{{quote|Notice to the Shakers: You are hereby permitted to hold meetings ... under the following conditions: on Sundays not longer than three (3) hours at one time and on Wednesdays not longer than two (2) hours at one time. The following REGULATIONS to be observed: 1st, Keep windows or a door open during all meetings. 2nd, Use only one bell to give signals. Not continuous ringing. 3rd, Do not admit school children at night meetings.

It has been reported ... that there are some women who are violating the Rules ... and that they shake at all hours of the day and night. You will therefore tell the women quietly to stop shaking at any other times than the times specified in the rules ... If they do not stop, ... you will lock them up until they agree to stop. Shaking of the sick must not be allowed ... We do not want any trouble in this matter if it is possible to avoid it; but that 'continual and private shaking' must be stopped.{{efn|Powell et al. 1976,{{sfn|Powell|Jensen|1976}} cited in Bright 1984{{sfn|Bright|1984}}}}}}

In the 1960s, a break occurred among Indian Shakers in which one "conservative" faction continued to reject written religious material while another "progressive" faction was more tolerant of the use of the Bible and other written material.

Indian Shakers continue to practice on the Northwest Coast in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], [[California]], and [[British Columbia]].

'''''Leonotis leonurus''''', also known as '''lion's tail''' and '''wild dagga''', is a plant species in the [[Lamiaceae]] ([[Mentha|mint]]) family. The plant is a broadleaf evergreen large [[shrub]] [[native plant|native]] to [[South Africa]] and [[southern Africa]], where it is very common.&lt;ref name="mbc"&gt;[http://www.mobot.org/gardeninghelp/plantfinder/Plant.asp?code=A525 MBC-Kemper Center - ''Leonotis leonurus''] . accessed 7.7.2011&lt;/ref&gt;  It is known for its [[medicine|medicinal]] and mild [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] properties. The main psychoactive component of ''Leonotis leonurus'' is claimed to 
be [[leonurine]],&lt;ref name="Ho2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wing Shing Ho|title=Active Phytochemicals from Chinese Herbal Medicines: Anti-Cancer Activities and Mechanisms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n3xjCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39|date=4 September 2015|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4822-1987-6|pages=39–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  even though leonurine has never been found in the plant using chemical analysis.&lt;ref name="NsualaEnslin2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nsuala|first1=Baudry N.|last2=Enslin|first2=Gill|last3=Viljoen|first3=Alvaro|title="Wild cannabis": A review of the traditional use and phytochemistry of Leonotis leonurus|journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology|volume=174|year=2015|pages=520–539|issn=0378-8741|doi=10.1016/j.jep.2015.08.013|pmid=26292023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other plants in the mint family, it also contains [[marrubiim]].

[[Image:Leonotis leonurus flower.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Close-up: ''Leonotis leonurus'' flower.]]

==Description==
The shrub grows {{convert|3|to|6|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} tall by {{convert|1.5|to|3.5|ft|m|}} wide.&lt;ref name="mbc"/&gt; The medium-dark green {{convert|2|-|4|in|cm}} long leaves are aromatic when crushed. The plant has tubular orange flowers in tiered whorls, typical to the mint family, that encircle the square stems. They rise above the foliage mass during the summer season, with flowering continuing into winter in warmer climates.&lt;ref name="mbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usda"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=LELE3 |title=PLANTS Profile for ''Leonotis leonurus'' (lion's ear) |author= |date= |website= |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variation in flower color===
A white variety (known colloquially as 'Alba') and a yellow variety also exist.

===Ecology===
The native [[habitat]] of ''Leonotis leonurus'' is damp grasslands of southern Africa.&lt;ref name="Quattrocchi2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Umberto Quattrocchi|title=CRC World Dictionary of Medicinal and Poisonous Plants: Common Names, Scientific Names, Eponyms, Synonyms, and Etymology (5 Volume Set)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-37OBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2244|date=19 April 2016|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4822-5064-0|pages=2244–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It attracts nectivorous birds (mainly [[sunbird]]s), as well as various insects such as butterflies. The flowers' mainly orange to orange-red colour and tubular shape are indicative of its co-evolution with African sunbirds, which have curved bills suited to feeding from tubular flowers.

==Cultivation==
''Leonotis leonurus'' is cultivated as an [[ornamental plant]] for its copious orange blossom spikes and is used as an accent or screen in [[garden]]s and [[park]]s.&lt;ref name="mbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usda"/&gt; It is moderately [[xeriscapes|drought tolerant]], and a nectar source for birds and butterflies in landscape settings.&lt;ref name="mbc"/&gt; It was introduced to Europe in the 1600s.&lt;ref name="SchmidtLotter2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ernst Schmidt|author2=Mervyn Lotter|author3=Warren McCleland|title=Trees and Shrubs of Mpumalanga and Kruger National Park|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RpVJJH3kV0oC&amp;pg=PA586|year=2002|publisher=Jacana Media|isbn=978-1-919777-30-6|pages=586–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lion's tail can especially be found in other subtropical and [[Mediterranean climate]] regions beyond South Africa such as [[California]], [[Hawaii]],&lt;ref name="usda"/&gt; and [[Australia]] where it has naturalized in areas. In cooler climates it is used as an [[annual plant|annual]] and winter [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]] plant.&lt;ref name="mbc"/&gt;

==Pharmacology and toxicology==
The main active component [[marrubiin]] has both antioxidant and cardioprotective properties and has shown to significantly improve myocardial function.&lt;ref&gt;Popoola KO Elbagory AM, Ameer F, Hussein AA. Marrubiin. Molecules 2013; 18(18):9049-9060.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;XinHua, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

One experimental animal study suggests that the aqueous leaf extract of ''Leonotis leonurus'' possesses [[nociception|antinociceptive]], [[inflammation|antiinflammatory]], and [[hypoglycemic]] properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ojewole JA |title=Antinociceptive, antiinflammatory and antidiabetic effects of Leonotis leonurus (L.)

An animal study in rats indicated that in high doses, lion's tail has significant toxicological adverse effects on organs, red blood cells, white blood cells and other important bodily functions. Acute toxicity tests in animals caused death for those receiving 3200&amp;nbsp;mg/kg dose. At 1600&amp;nbsp;mg/kg extract led to changes in red blood cells, hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, platelets, and white blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19244291 | year = 2008 | last1 = Maphosa | first1 = V | last2 = Masika | first2 = P | last3 = Adedapo | first3 = A | title = Safety evaluation of the aqueous extract of Leonotis leonurus shoots in rats | volume = 27 | issue = 11 | pages = 837–43 | doi = 10.1177/0960327108099533 | journal = Human &amp; Experimental Toxicology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional uses==
The infusions made from flowers and seeds, leaves or stems are widely used to treat [[tuberculosis]], [[jaundice]], [[muscle cramps]], [[high blood pressure]], [[diabetes]], [[viral hepatitis]], [[dysentery]], and [[diarrhoea]].&lt;ref&gt;Van WJB, van OB, Gericke N. Medicinal plants of South Africa. Briza Publications. Cape Town, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noumi E, Houngue F, Lontsi D. Traditional medicines in primary health care: plants used for the treatment of hypertension in Bafia, Cameroon. Fitoterapia 1999; 70(2):134-139.&lt;/ref&gt; The leaves, roots and bark are used as an emetic for snakebites, bee and scorpion stings.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchings AH, Scott G, Lewis AB. Cunningham, Zulu medicinal plants, an Inventory. Natal University Press, Pietermaritzburg, 1996, 266-267.&lt;/ref&gt; The fresh stem juice is used as an infusion drunk for 'blood impurity' in some places of South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Watt JM, Breyer BMG. Medicinal and poisonous plants of Southern Africa. E &amp; S Livingstone. Edinburg, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recreational uses==
The dried leaves and flowers have a mild calming effect when [[smoked]]. In some users, the effects have been noted to be similar to the [[cannabinoid]] [[THC]] found in ''[[Cannabis (drug)|Cannabis]]'', except that it has a much less potent high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.erowid.org/plants/leonotis_leonurus/leonotis_leonurus.shtml |title=Erowid ''Leonotis leonurus'' (Lion's Tail) Vault|date=9 September 2009 |website=[[Erowid]]|accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been reported to cause mild [[euphoria]], [[visual]] changes, [[dizziness]], [[nausea]], [[sweating]], [[sedation]] and [[lightheadedness]].

It is sometimes used as a ''Cannabis'' substitute by recreational users as an alternative to illegal psychoactive plants.

==Legal status==
===Latvia===
''Leonotis leonurus'' is illegal in [[Latvia]] since November 2009. It is Schedule 1 drug. Possession of quantities up to 1 gram are fined up to 280 euro. Possession and distribution of larger quantities can be punished with up to 15 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?mode=DOC&amp;id=50539 |title=Par Krimināllikuma spēkā stāšanās un piemērošanas kārtību |publisher=''[[likumi.lv]]'' |date= |accessdate=2013-06-23 |language=Latvian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
''Leonotis leonurus'' was banned in [[Poland]] in March 2009. Possession and distribution lead to a criminal charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/DetailsServlet?id=WDU20090630520 Dz.U. 2009 nr 63 poz. 520], Internetowy System Aktów Prawnych.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maharaja Budhachandra''' (- 1955) was king of [[Manipur]], [[India]] from 1941 to 1955.

He became King of Manipur in September 1941. He had married the [[Nepal]]ese princess Ishori Devi. On May 10, 1942, [[Japan]] occupied Manipur. [[World War II]] bankrupted Manipur.

In October 1946, the king created the Manipur state congress to strengthen the economy. In January 1947, the king decided the country should become a [[constitutional monarchy]]. He designated a committee to plan this process. This plan was never completed.

On August 15, 1947, India became independent. On August 11, 1947, Manipur signed an affiliation agreement with India. On 21 September 1949 the king went to [[Shillong]] to discuss constitutional matters with the state of India.

India formally annexed Manipur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/manipur/documents/papers/manipur_merger_agreement_1949.htm |title=Manipur Merger Agreement, 1949 |publisher=Satp.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maharaja Budhachandra remained as constitutional head of the state government until his death in 1955. He was the last king of Manipur.

'''[[Neopaganism]] in [[Hungary]]''' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Újpogányság'') is very diverse, with followers of the [[Hungarian native faith]] and of other religions, including [[Wicca]]ns, [[Kemetism|Kemetics]], [[Mithraism|Mithraics]], [[Druidry|Druids]] and [[Christopaganism|Christopagans]].&lt;ref&gt;Kolozsi 2012, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Szilárdi (2006)  describes the movement as  a [[postmodern]] combination of [[ethnocentric]] linguistic, national, religious and occasional political patterns of identity. Interest in the [[polytheistic reconstructionism|reconstruction]] of an [[ethnic religion]] for the [[Hungarians]] manifested for the first time in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Koloszi 2012, p. 36-53&lt;/ref&gt; A contribution to the popularisation of [[Pagan]] ideas in the Hungarian society was the tremendous success of the rock opera ''[[István, a király]]'' in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinovitch and Lewis 2004, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religions==

===Christopaganism===
Many Pagan groups in [[Hungary]] make use of [[Christianity|Christian]] terminology and iconography re-interpreted in an ethnic Pagan way. This is the case of the "Church of Esoteric Beliefs — Church of the Holy Crown" ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Ezoterikus Tanok Egyháza — Szent Korona Egyház''), conceptualising a [[Scythian]] ancient religion with Christian character, worshiping the ''Fény Jézus'' ("Light Jesus") and the ''Boldogasszony'' ("Blessed Lady"), with the ''[[táltos]]'' as priests.&lt;ref&gt;Kolozsi 2012, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; The church has been establishing ''naptemplomok'' (singular: ''naptemplom''), "temples of the Sun", as its places of worship. Another organisation of this kind is the "Our Lady's Love Church" (''Nagyboldogasszony Szeretet Egyház'').

===Hungarian Neopaganism===
{{Main|Hungarian Neopaganism}}
Hungarian Neopaganism, the Hungarian native faith, or ''Ősmagyar Vallás'' (meaning "Ancient Hungarian Religion" or more accurately "Arch-Hungarian Religion") as it is called in the local Neopagan discourse, defines the movements which seek to rebuild a purely Hungarian [[ethnic religion]], inspired to [[Hungarian mythology]] and [[shamanistic remnants in Hungarian folklore|folklore]]. This drift has roots in the ethnological studies of the early 20th century, while the elaboration of a national Hungarian religion was endorsed in the interwar [[Hungarian Turanism|Turanist]] circles (1930s-40s), finally blossoming alongside other Pagan religions since the fall of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Kolozsi 2012, p. 36-62&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between Hungarian Neopagan groups is often determined by their differing ideas about the historical origins of the [[Hungarians]].&lt;ref&gt;Kolozsi 2012, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the Hungarian Neopagan movements largely rely on the work of individual [[shaman]]s or [[neoshamanism|neoshamans]], the ''[[táltos]]'', who may organise themselves in associations, set up schools, or establish larger religious organisations.&lt;ref&gt;Kolozsi 2012, p. 36-62&lt;/ref&gt; The shamans' movement started to come to light in the 1980s, organising cooperation with representatives of [[core shamanism]] from the [[United States]] since 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Kolozsi 2012, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Those ''táltos'' who espouse a Turanist ideology often choose to affiliate with [[Tengrism]].&lt;ref&gt;Kolozsi 2012, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important organisations of this kind are the ''Yotengrit'', and the ''Ősmagyar Táltos Egyház'' ("Arch-Hungarian Táltos Church") founded by András Kovács-Magyar, who later also founded the ''Táltos Iskola'' ("Táltos School").&lt;ref&gt;Kolozsi 2012, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Other groups of this stream are the ''Ősmagyar Egyház'' ("Arch-Hungarian Church") and the ''Magyar Vallás Közössége'' ("Community of Hungarian Religion").&lt;ref&gt;Kolozsi 2012, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Another church of the Hungarian native faith is the ''Árpád Rendjének Jogalapja Tradicionális Egyház'' ("Traditional Church of the Order of Árpád"), founded in 2009. It is inspired by the [[Traditionalist School]], the [[Nouvelle Droite]] of [[Alain de Benoist]], and to the concept of a common [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European paganism]].&lt;ref&gt;Kolozsi 2012, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kemetism===
The "Ankh — Church of Eternal Life" ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Ankh — Az Örök Élet Egyháza'') is a [[Kemetism|Kemetic]] church in [[Hungary]], founded in 1999. They propose a theory that sees [[God]] as the source of the universe, himself being the universe, inclosing every conscious and unconscious being. The aim of the organisation is to cultivate and meet the gods, who are the powers acting in the creation.

===Neo-Mithraism===
The ''Sodalitas Mithraica'' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "Mithraic Fellowship") is a Neo-[[Mithraism|Mithraic]] group active in [[Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;Kolozsi 2012, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wicca and Witchcraft===
[[:hu:Magyar Boszorkányszövetség|''Magyar Boszorkányszövetség'']] (meaning "Hungarian Witchcraft") is a [[Budapest]]-based Neopagan organization formed in 1986. [[Wicca]], a religion of [[England|English]] origin, has spread to Hungary as in the other countries of [[Western Europe]]. [[Zsuzsanna Budapest]], a Hungarian who emigrated to the [[United States]], is the founder of the Wiccan denomination known as [[Dianic Wicca]], popular in North America. The [[:hu:Kelta-Wicca Hagyományőrzők Egyháza|Celtic Wiccan Tradition Church]] (''Kelta-Wicca Hagyományőrzők Egyháza'') is a [[Celtic Wicca]]n church in Hungary.

'''Nikolai Minsky''' and '''Nikolai Maksimovich Minsky''' ({{lang-ru|Никола́й Макси́мович Ми́нский}}) are pseudonyms of '''Nikolai Maksimovich Vilenkin''' (Виле́нкин; 1855–1937), a mystical writer and [[poet]] of the [[Silver Age of Russian Poetry]].

==Life==
Born in Glubokoe (now [[Hlybokaye]], [[Belarus]]) to poor [[Jewish]] parents, he was orphaned early. He was brought up, and finished his schooling, in [[Minsk]]. He took his pseudonym from the city he grew up in. He studied law at the University of [[Saint Petersburg]].

His first poems were written on "civil topics". In 1889, he began work on the book ''With the Light of Conscience'', employing a deliberately pompous tone to present its theory of "'''meonism'''" (''me on'' being Greek for "nonexistent"). The objective of the work is to show that the main purpose of humanity is "nonexistence itself".

In 1900, [[Dmitri Merezhkovsky]], Minsky, [[Zinaida Gippius]], [[Vasily Rozanov]], and others founded the [[Religious-Philosophical Society]] in Saint Petersburg. Minsky, like the majority of intellectuals, sympathized with the revolution and social democracy. He was the nominal editor of the legal [[Bolshevik]] newspaper ''[[New Life (newspaper)|New Life]]''.

After the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|revolution]] was defeated in 1905, Minsky became one of the leaders of Russian [[decadence]] and [[Russian Symbolism|symbolism]]. These ideas represented the cult of beauty and enjoyment and declared war on the public tendencies that threatened to damage the "cleanliness" of artistic creation. After 1905, he lived abroad.

A religious-philosophical concept is presented in the treatises ''With the Light of Conscience'' (1890) and ''The Religion of the Future'' (1905). Other publications include the collection of verses ''From the Gloom to the Light'' (1922) and various dramas and [[translations]].

Minsky died in Paris, and is buried at the [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]].

'''Our Lady of Lourdes''' is a [[Roman Catholic]] title of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] venerated in honour of the [[Marian apparition]]s that reportedly occurred in 1858 in the vicinity of [[Lourdes]] in [[France]].  The first of these is the apparition of 11 February 1858, when 14-year old [[Bernadette Soubirous]] told her mother that a "lady" spoke to her in the cave of Massabielle (a kilometre and a half (1 mi) from the town) while she was gathering firewood with her sister and a friend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/clife/mary/app.php?id=1 Catholic Online: Apparitions of Our Lady of Lourdes First Apparition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050412211713/http://www.catholic.org/clife/mary/app.php?id=1 |date=April 12, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar apparitions of the "Lady" were reported on seventeen occasions that year, until the climax revelation of [[Immaculate Conception|Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception]] took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=159276441X |title=2009 Catholic Almanac|publisher=Our Sunday Visitor Publishing|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 18 January 1862, [[Pope Pius IX]] authorized Bishop Bertrand-Sévère Laurence to permit the veneration of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] in Lourdes. On 3 July 1876, the same [[Pontiff]] officially granted a [[Canonical Coronation]] to the image that used to be in the [[courtyard]] of what is now part of the [[Rosary Basilica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.lourdes-france.org/sejour-a-lourdes/carte-de-lourdes/vierge-couronnee|title=La Vierge couronnée - Lourdes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/fr/articles/marie-reine-22-aout "Marie Reine, 22 août", ''Zenit'', 21 Août 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; The image of Our Lady of Lourdes has been widely copied and reproduced in shrines and homes, often in [[garden]] landscapes. Soubirous was later canonized as a [[Catholic saint]].

== History ==
===Bernadette Soubirous===
[[File:Bernadette Soubirous.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An early studio photograph of [[Bernadette Soubirous]], age 14, in daily civilian attire. Circa 1 January 1858. ]]
{{Main|Bernadette Soubirous}}

In 1858, [[Bernadette Soubirous]] reported a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]] of Our Lady of Lourdes.&lt;ref name=PeterS2012 &gt;Stravinskas, Peter. ''What Mary Means to Christians: An Ancient Tradition Explained'', 2012, Paulist Press {{ISBN|0809147440}} chapter on "Lourdes, Fatima, Guadalupe"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bunson194&gt;Bunson, Matthew. ''The Catholic Almanac's Guide to the Church'', 2001 {{ISBN|0879739142}} p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; A simple 14-year-old peasant girl of no significant educational experience, Soubirous claimed she saw “''uo petito damizelo''”, "a petite damsel,"&lt;ref&gt;Blanton, Margaret Grey, ''Bernadette of Lourdes''. Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; in white, with a golden rosary and blue belt fastened around her waist, and two golden roses at her feet. In subsequent visitations she heard the lady speak to her, saying ''Que soy Immaculada Concepcion'' (''I am the Immaculate Conception''), and asking that a chapel be built there. At first ridiculed, questioned, and belittled by Church officials and other contemporaries, Soubirous insisted on her vision. Eventually the Church believed her and she was canonized by Pope [[Pius XI]] in 1933.&lt;ref name=Burke850 &gt;Burke, Raymond L.; et al. (2008). Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians, and Consecrated Persons {{ISBN|978-1-57918-355-4}} pp. 850-868&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lauretin, R., Lourdes, ''Dossier des documents authentiques'', Paris: 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

After church investigations confirmed her visions, a large church was built at the site.&lt;ref name=James317&gt;Buckley, James; Bauerschmidt, Frederick Christian, and Pomplun, Trent. ''The Blackwell Companion to Catholicism'', 2010 {{ISBN|1444337327}} p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lourdes, France|Lourdes]] is now a major Marian pilgrimage site: within France, only Paris has more hotels than Lourdes.

=== Marian apparition ===
[[File:Lourdes Vierge.JPG|thumb|The venerated image of Our Lady of the Rosary granted a [[Canonical Coronation]] by Pope Pius IX on 3 July 1876. During that same year, an oversized golden [[laurel wreath]] was placed at the base as well as a stellar halo was attached to the head of the image; both no longer present.]]
On 11 February 1858, Soubirous went with her sister Toinette and neighbor Jeanne Abadie to collect some firewood and bones in order to buy some bread. After taking off her shoes and stockings to wade through the water near the [[Grotto]] of Massabielle, she said she heard the sound of two gusts of wind (coups de vent) but the trees and bushes nearby did not move. A wild rose in a natural niche in the grotto, however, did move.

{{quote|“…I came back towards the grotto and started taking off my stockings. I had hardly taken off the first stocking when I heard a sound like a gust of wind. Then I turned my head towards the meadow. I saw the trees quite still: I went on taking off my stockings. I heard the same sound again. As I raised my head to look at the grotto, I saw a lady dressed in white, wearing a white dress, a blue girdle and a yellow rose on each foot, the same color as the chain of her rosary; the beads of the rosary were white....From the niche, or rather the dark alcove behind it, came a dazzling light…”.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Thérèse (2003). Bernadette of Lourdes. Burns and Oates. {{ISBN|0-86012-337-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Soubirous tried to make the [[sign of the cross|sign of the Cross]] but she could not, because her hands were trembling. The lady smiled, and invited Soubirous to pray the rosary with her.&lt;ref name=SHMI&gt;{{cite book|author=Fr. Paolo O. Pirlo, SHMI|title=My First Book of Saints|year=1997|publisher=Sons of Holy Mary Immaculate - Quality Catholic Publications|isbn=971-91595-4-5|pages=49–50|chapter=Our Lady of Lourdes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soubirous tried to keep this a secret, but Toinette told her mother. After parental cross-examination, she and her sister received [[corporal punishment]] for their story.{{sfn|Laurentin|1988|p=161}}

Three days later, 14 February, Soubirous returned to the Grotto. She had brought holy water as a test that the apparition was not of evil origin/provenance: "The second time was the following Sunday. ... Then I started to throw holy water in her direction, and at the same time I said that if she came from God she was to stay, but if not, she must go. She started to smile, and bowed ... This was the second time."{{sfn|Harris|1999|p=4}}

Soubirous's companions are said to have become afraid when they saw her in ecstasy. She remained ecstatic even as they returned to the village. On 18 February, she spoke of being told by the Lady to return to the Grotto over a period of two weeks. She quoted the apparition: "The Lady only spoke to me the third time. ... She told me also that she did not promise to make me happy in this world, but in the next."{{sfn|Laurentin|1988|p=161}}

Soubirous was ordered by her parents to never go there again. She went anyway, and on 24 February, Soubirous related that the apparition asked for prayer and penitence for the conversion of sinners. 
[[File:Bernadette2.jpg|thumb|upright|Soubirous witnessing the apparition of the Virgin Mary. Stained glass, Bonneval.]]

The next day, she said the apparition asked her to dig in the ground and drink from the spring she found there. This made her dishevelled and some of her supporters were dismayed, but this act revealed the stream that soon became a focal point for pilgrimages.{{sfn|Harris|1999|p=7}} Although it was muddy at first, the stream became increasingly clean. As word spread, this water was given to medical patients of all kinds, and many reports of miraculous cures followed. Seven of these cures were confirmed as lacking any medical explanations by Professor Verges in 1860. The first person with a "certified miracle" was a woman whose right hand had been deformed as a consequence of an accident. Several miracles turned out to be short-term improvement or even hoaxes, and Church and government officials became increasingly concerned.{{sfn|Lauretin|1988|p=162}} The government fenced off the Grotto and issued stiff penalties for anybody trying to get near the off-limits area. In the process, Lourdes became a national issue in France, resulting in the intervention of Emperor [[Napoleon III]] with an order to reopen the grotto on 4 October 1858. The Church had decided to stay away from the controversy altogether.

Soubirous, knowing the local area well, managed to visit the barricaded grotto under cover of darkness. There, on 25&amp;nbsp;March, she said she was told: "I am the [[Immaculate Conception]]" (''"que soy era immaculada concepciou"''). On Easter Sunday, 7&amp;nbsp;April, her examining doctor stated that Soubirous, in ecstasy, was observed to have held her hands over a lit candle without sustaining harm. On 16 July, Soubirous went for the last time to the Grotto. "I have never seen her so beautiful before," she reported.{{sfn|Lauretin|1988|p=162}}

{{Main|Lourdes apparitions}}

The Church, faced with nationwide questions, decided to institute an investigative commission on 17 November 1858. On 18 January 1860, the local bishop finally declared that: "The Virgin Mary did appear indeed to Bernadette Soubirous."{{sfn|Lauretin|1988|p=162}} These events established the Marian veneration in Lourdes, which together with [[Our Lady of Fátima|Fátima]], is one of the most frequented Marian shrines in the world, and to which between 4 and 6 million pilgrims travel annually.

In 1863, [[Joseph-Hugues Fabisch]] was charged to create a statue of the Virgin according to Soubirous's description. The work was placed in the grotto and solemnly dedicated on 4 April 1864 in presence of 20,000 pilgrims.

Soubirous was later canonized as a [[saint]] in 1933. 

The veracity of the apparitions of Lourdes is not an article of faith for Catholics. Nevertheless, all recent Popes visited the Marian shrine at some time. [[Pope Benedict XV|Benedict XV]], [[Pope Pius XI|Pius XI]], and [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]] went there as bishops, [[Pope Pius XII|Pius XII]] as papal delegate. He also issued an [[encyclical]], ''[[Le pèlerinage de Lourdes]]'', on the one-hundredth anniversary of the apparitions in 1958. [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] visited Lourdes three times during his pontificate, and twice before as a bishop.

===Historical context===
Many Marian apparitions, although they may occur in different ages and cultures, share similarities. Soubirous's visions took place against a cultural backdrop of apparitions and other supernatural events that bear some resemblance to Soubirous's experiences. It is likely that Soubirous would have known of, and may even have been influenced by, such events, which were woven into the fabric of her society.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

In nearby [[Lestelle-Bétharram]], only a few kilometres from Lourdes, some shepherds guarding their flocks in the mountains observed a vision of a ray of light that guided them to the discovery of a statue of the Virgin Mary. Two attempts were made to remove the statue to a more prominent position; each time it disappeared and returned to its original location, at which a small chapel was built for it.{{sfn|Harris|1999|p=39}}

In the early sixteenth century, a twelve-year-old shepherdess called '''Anglèze de Sagazan''' received a vision of the Virgin Mary near the spring at '''Garaison''' (part of the [[commune in France|commune]] of [[Monléon-Magnoac]]), somewhat further away. Anglèze's story is strikingly similar to that of Soubirous: she was a pious but illiterate and poorly educated girl, extremely impoverished, who spoke only in the local language, Gascon Occitan, but successfully convinced authorities that her vision was genuine and persuaded them to obey the instructions of her apparitions. Like Soubirous, she was the only one who could see the apparition (others could apparently hear it); however, the apparition at Garaison's supernatural powers tended toward the miraculous provision of abundant food, rather than healing the sick and injured. Mid-nineteenth century commentators noted the parallels between the events at Massabielle and Garaison, and interpreted the similarities as proof of the divine nature of Soubirous's claims.{{sfn|Harris|1999|p=41}} At the time of Soubirous, Garaison was a noted center of pilgrimage and Marian devotion.

There are also several similarities between the [[Our Lady of La Salette|apparition at La Salette]], near [[Grenoble]], and Lourdes. La Salette is many hundreds of kilometres from Lourdes, and the events at La Salette predate those in Lourdes by 12 years. However, Virgin Mary's appearance of La Salette was tall and maternal (not petite and gentle like her Lourdes apparition) and had a darker, more threatening series of messages. It is not certain if Soubirous was aware of the events at La Salette.{{sfn|Harris|1999|p=60}}

==Position of the Catholic Church==
[[File:Lourdes Basilique et gave.jpg|thumb|The sanctuary basilica built at [[Lourdes]] directly above the site of the apparitions]]

===Approval of Lourdes===
On 18 January 1862, Bishop Laurence, the [[Bishop of Tarbes]], declared the following:

{{Quote|  "We are inspired by the Commission comprising wise, holy, learned and experienced priests who questioned the child, studied the facts, examined everything and weighed all the evidence. We have also called on science, and we remain convinced that the Apparitions are supernatural and divine, and that by consequence, what Soubirous saw was the Most Blessed Virgin. Our convictions are based on the testimony of Soubirous, but above all on the things that have happened, things which can be nothing other than divine intervention".&lt;ref name="encounters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lourdes-france.org/index.php?goto_centre=ru&amp;contexte=en&amp;id=417&amp;id_rubrique=417#|title=Lourdes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Nature of approval===
Because the apparitions are private, and not public [[revelation]]s, Catholics are not required to believe them.{{fact|date=October 2018}} They do not add any additional material to the truths of the Catholic Church as expressed in ''public revelation''.{{fact|date=October 2018}} Soubirous said, "One must have faith and pray; the water will have no virtue without faith."

===Holy Mass of Our Lady of Lourdes===
The Catholic Church celebrates a mass in honor of "Our Lady of Lourdes" (optional memorial) in many countries on February 11 of each year — the anniversary of the first apparition. There had long been a tradition of interpreting the [[Song of Songs]] as an allegory of God's love for the Church, so up until the [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] reforms following [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]], a passage from this Old Testament book was used during the mass for its reference to the ''"beloved"'' appearing in a cleft of a rock&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drbo.org/chapter/24002.htm|title=Douay-Rheims Catholic Bible, Canticle Of Canticles (Song Of Solomon) Chapter 2|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its parallel with what Catholics have described as the "Mother of the Church"&lt;ref&gt;"Mary, Mother of Christ, Mother of the Church", Catechism of the Catholic Church 963, retrieved 29 May 2007.[http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p123a9p6.htm Vatican.va]&lt;/ref&gt; being seen in the cleft of a rock in Lourdes.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Popes and Lourdes==
[[File:JPII Lourdes.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope John Paul II]] in the Grotto of Massabielle, in the Lourdes Shrine.]]

[[Pope Pius IX]] approved the veneration in Lourdes and supported the building of the Cathedral in 1870 to which he donated several gifts. He approved the veneration and promoted Marian piety in Lourdes with the granting of special [[indulgence]]s and the formation of local Lourdes associations.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidlin, Josef.''Papstgeschichte'', München 1934, 317&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Leo XIII]] crowned [[Our Lady of La Salette]] and issued an apostolic letter ''Parte Humanae Generi'' in commemoration of the consecration of the new Cathedral in Lourdes in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Bäumer Leo XIII, ''Marienlexikon'', 97&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Benedict XV]], when archbishop of [[Bologna]], organized a diocesan pilgrimage to Lourdes, asking for the veneration of the Immaculate Virgin there. In 1907, [[Pope Pius X]] introduced the feast of the apparition of the Immaculate Virgin of Lourdes. In the same year he issued his encyclical ''[[Pascendi dominici gregis]]'', in which he specifically repeated the permission to venerate the virgin in Lourdes.&lt;ref&gt;Bäumer, ''Pius X Marienlexikon'', 246&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pope Benedict XVI placing a novelty crown on Our Lady of Lourdes on occasion for the sick pilgrims, 11 February 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Benedict XVI]] placing a crown{{ efn|The event was not a rite of Canonical coronation, nor a re-coronation of the image at the Rosary basilica. }} on Our Lady of Lourdes for the [[plenary indulgence]] he attached for pilgrims of the [[World Day of the Sick]]. 11 February 2007. [[Saint Peter's Basilica]]. ]]

In 1937, Pius XI nominated [[Pope Pius XII|Eugenio Pacelli]] as his 'Papal Delegate' to personally visit and venerate in Lourdes. Pius XI beatified Soubirous on 6 June 1925. He canonized her on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on 8 December 1933 and determined her Feast Day to be 18 February. Soubirous, who suffered from [[asthma]] and [[bone cancer]], had lived on the borderline of social acceptance in the church during her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn Baier, Bernadette Soubirous, Marienlexikon, 217&lt;/ref&gt; The Virgin Mary reportedly told Soubirous 'that she did not promise to make me happy in this world, but in the next.'&lt;ref name="Catholic Pilgrims"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicpilgrims.com/lourdes/bd_lourdes_apparitions.htm|title=Apparitions at Lourdes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Pius XII]], commemorating the hundredth anniversary of the Immaculate conception dogma, announced a Marian year, the first one on Church history. In his encyclical ''[[Fulgens corona]]'', he described the events in Lourdes:

{{quote|It seems that the Blessed Virgin Mary herself wished to confirm by some special sign the definition, which the Vicar of her Divine Son on earth had pronounced amidst the applause of the whole Church. For indeed four years had not yet elapsed when, in a French town at the foot of the Pyrenees, the Virgin Mother, youthful and benign in appearance, clothed in a shining white garment, covered with a white mantle and girded with a hanging blue cord, showed herself to a simple and innocent girl at the grotto of Massabielle. And to this same girl, earnestly inquiring the name of her with whose vision she was favored, with eyes raised to heaven and sweetly smiling, she replied: "I am the Immaculate Conception." &lt;ref&gt;Fulgens Corona, §3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Lourdes ND Rosaire 03.jpg|thumb|The Rosary Basilica, Lourdes]]

''[[Le pèlerinage de Lourdes]]'', the only encyclical written on Lourdes, was issued on the centenary of the apparitions at [[Lourdes]]. The Pope presents Mary as the model of alternative lifestyle. The school of Mary teaches selflessness and charity.

{{quote|In the school of Mary one can learn to live, not only to give Christ to the world, but also to await with faith the hour of Jesus, and to remain with Mary at the foot of the cross. Wherever providence has placed a person, there is always more to be done for God's cause. Priests should with supernatural confidence, show the narrow road which leads to life. Consecrated and Religious fight under Mary's banner against inordinate lust for freedom, riches, and pleasures. In response to the Immaculate, they will fight with the weapons of prayer and penance and by triumphs of charity. Go to her, you who are crushed by material misery, defenseless against the hardships of life and the indifference of men. Go to her, you who are assailed by sorrows and moral trials. Go to her, beloved invalids and infirm, you who are sincerely welcomed and honoured at Lourdes as the suffering members of our Lord. Go to her and receive peace of heart, strength for your daily duties, joy for the sacrifice you offer.&lt;ref&gt;''Le pèlerinage de Lourdes'', 57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Le pèlerinage de Lourdes'', 40 ff&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Basilica of St. Pius X]] was consecrated on 25 March 1958, by the Patriarch of Venice, cardinal Angelo Roncalli, the future [[Pope John XXIII]]. Giovanni Battista Montini, the future [[Pope Paul VI]], had visited Lourdes as archbishop of Milan. [[Pope John Paul II]] undertook three pilgrimages to Lourdes, the last one shortly before his death. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] visited Lourdes commemorating the 150th anniversary of the apparitions in September 2008. Born on Soubirous' feast day 16 April in 1927, three days after his 78th birthday the then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was elected to the [[See of Peter]] on 19 April 2005 in a papal conclave and celebrated his Papal Inauguration Mass on 24 April 2005.

==Lourdes water==
{{main|Lourdes water}}
The location of the spring was described to Soubirous by an apparition of Our Lady of Lourdes on 25 February 1858. Since that time many thousands of pilgrims to Lourdes have followed the instruction of Our Lady of Lourdes to "drink at the spring and wash in it".

Although never formally encouraged by the Church, Lourdes water has become a focus of devotion to the Virgin Mary at Lourdes. Since the apparitions, many people have claimed to have been cured by drinking or bathing in it,&lt;ref name="Ruth Harris 1999, p. 312"&gt;Harris, Ruth.

An analysis of the water was commissioned by Mayor Anselme Lacadé of Lourdes in 1858. It was conducted by a professor in [[Toulouse]], who determined that the water was [[potable]] and that it contained the following: oxygen, [[nitrogen]], [[carbonic acid]], [[carbonates]] of lime and magnesia, a trace of carbonate of [[iron]], an alkaline carbonate or silicate, [[chloride]]s of [[potassium]] and [[sodium]], traces of [[sulphates]] of potassium and soda, traces of [[ammonia]], and traces of [[iodine]].&lt;ref name="civil"&gt;[http://www.nd.edu/~wcawley/corson/lourdes4.htm Barbé, Daniel. ''Lourdes'']&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the water is quite pure and inert. Lacadé had hoped that Lourdes water might have special mineral properties which would allow him to develop Lourdes into a spa town, to compete with neighbouring [[Cauterets]] and [[Bagnères-de-Bigorre]].&lt;ref name="Ruth Harris 1999, p. 312"/&gt;

==Appearance==
Historical, [[psychological]], [[analogy|natural analogies]] and other empirical explanations have been forwarded, all of which are welcomed by the [[Catholic Church]], provided they are generally open-ended and unbiased.&lt;ref&gt;Stöger, Erscheinungen in Marienlexikon, 395 ff&lt;/ref&gt; 

Soubirous described the apparition as ''uo petito damizelo'' ("a tiny maiden") of about twelve years old. Soubirous insisted that the apparition was no taller than herself. At {{convert|1.40|m}} tall, Soubirous was diminutive even by the standards of other poorly nourished children.{{sfn|Harris|1999|p=72}}

Soubirous described that the apparition as dressed in a flowing white robe, with a blue sash around her waist. This was the uniform of a religious group called the [[Children of Mary]], which, on account of her poverty, Soubirous was not permitted to join (although she was admitted after the apparitions).{{sfn|Harris|1999|p=43}} Her Aunt Bernarde was a long-time member.

The statue that currently stands in the niche within the grotto of Massabielle was created by the [[Lyon]]nais sculptor [[Joseph-Hugues Fabisch]] in 1864. Although it has become an iconographic symbol of Our Lady of Lourdes, it depicts a figure which is not only older and taller than Soubirous's description, but also more in keeping with orthodox and traditional representations of the Virgin Mary. On seeing the statue, Soubirous was profoundly disappointed with this representation of her vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Visentin |first1= M.C.|editor1-first= C.|editor1-last= Leonardi |editor2-first= A.|editor2-last= Riccardi |editor3-first= G.|editor3-last= Zarri |title= Diccionario de los Santos |year= 2000|publisher= San Pablo|location= Spain|language= Spanish|isbn= 84-285-2259-6|pages= 1586–1596|chapter= María Bernarda Soubirous (Bernardita)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Sanctuary==
[[File:Our Lady of Lourdes Basilica.jpg|thumb|The [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes]]]]
The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes or the '''Domain''' (as it is most commonly known) is an area of ground surrounding the shrine ('''Grotto''') to Our Lady of Lourdes in the town of [[Lourdes]], [[France]]. This ground is owned and administrated by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]], and has several functions, including devotional activities, offices, and accommodation for sick pilgrims and their helpers. The Domain includes the Grotto itself, the nearby taps which dispense the [[Lourdes water]], and the offices of the [[Lourdes Medical Bureau]], as well as several churches and basilicas. It comprises an area of 51 [[hectare]]s, and includes 22 separate places of worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lourdes-france.org/index.php?goto_centre=ru&amp;contexte=en&amp;id=431&amp;id_rubrique=431|title=Lourdes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are six official languages of the Sanctuary: French, English, Italian, Spanish, Dutch and German.

==The Lourdes Medical Bureau==
{{main|Lourdes Medical Bureau}}

To ensure claims of cures were examined properly and to protect the town from fraudulent claims of miracles, the [[Lourdes Medical Bureau]] (Bureau Medical) was established at the request of [[Pope Pius X|Pope Saint Pius X]]. It is completely under medical rather than ecclesiastical supervision. Approximately 7000 people have sought to have their case confirmed as a miracle, of which 69 have been declared a scientifically inexplicable miracle by both the Bureau and the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/4767798/Where-scientists-are-looking-for-God.html ''Where Scientists are looking for God''], ''The Telegraph'', 16 January 2002. Retrieved 7 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The officially recognized miracle cures in Lourdes are among the least controversial in the Catholic world, because Lourdes from the very beginning was subject to intense medical investigation from skeptical doctors around the world. All medical doctors with the appropriate specialization in the area of the cure have unlimited access to the files and documents of the [[Lourdes Medical Bureau]] (Bureau Medical),&lt;ref&gt;Müller, 767&lt;/ref&gt; which also contains all approved and disapproved miracles. Most officially recognized cures in Lourdes were openly discussed and reported on in the media at the time. Nevertheless, there were a few instances where medically ascertained incomprehension turned out not to be miracles, because the illness reappeared in later years. In the vast number of cases however, the judgment of the medical and ecclesiastical authorities was upheld as beyond medical explanation in later critical investigations.&lt;ref&gt;Müller 768&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pilgrimages==
[[File:LourdesSkyline.jpg|thumb|upright|Skyline of the sanctuary at Lourdes]]
{{see also|Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes}}
The [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes|pilgrimage site]] is visited by millions each year, and Lourdes has become one of the prominent pilgrimage sites of the world. Miraculous healings have been claimed, and a number of these have been documented by the Lourdes Medical Commission. Large numbers of sick pilgrims travel to Lourdes each year in the hope of physical healing or spiritual renewal.

Papunhank was born in the early 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century, he was a [[Munsee]] man whose ancestors were notable [[Sachem|sachems]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Goode. “Dangerous Spirits: How the Indian Critique of Alcohol Shaped Eighteenth-Century Quaker Revivalism”, ''Early American Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal''. (2016) Vol. 14, No. 2, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; He spent his entire life growing up in the area around the Susquehanna Valley, a region which increasingly became embroiled in violence between settlers and Indigenous nations, including Munsee, [[Conoy tribe|Conoy]], [[Nanticoke people|Nanticoke]], [[Mahican]], and [[Lenape]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Goode, “Dangerous Spirits” p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; While Papunhank eventually converted to [[Christianity]], during his early life he had been regarded as a prophet in Munsee society.&lt;ref&gt;Jane T Merrit. ''At the Crossroads: Indians and Empires on a Mid-Atlantic Frontier,1700-1763.'' University of Carolina. (2003) p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Up until the 1750’s he reportedly struggled with an alcohol problem but following the death of his father, he isolated himself for five days in the woods and was struck by a spiritual vision which had a profound impact on his life.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Plank, ''John Woolman's Path to the Peaceable Kingdom: A Quaker in the British Empire''¸ University of Pennsylvania Press. (2012) p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; He became even further devoted to God, and renounced alcohol and became a pacifist.&lt;ref&gt;Jay David, Miller, ““Nature Hath a Voice”: John Woolman’s Wilderness Habitus”, ''Religion &amp; Literature'', Vol. 45, No. 2. (2013) p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Papunhank came to use aspects of both Christianity and traditional Munsee spirituality, and was seen as a medicine man by many of his people.&lt;ref&gt;Jane T. Merritt. “Dreaming of the Saviors Blood: Moravians and the Great Indian Awakening in Pennsylvania”, ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Vol. 54, No. 4. (1997) p. 735.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars such as Earl Olmstead have argued that white settlement pressure caused Papunhank, alongside his family and other Munsee people to start a village named Machiwihilusing upon the Susquehanna river.&lt;ref&gt;Earl P. Olmstead. ''Blackcoats Among the Delaware: David Zeisberger on the Ohio Frontier''. Kent State University Press. (1991) p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the village which had a population of some 300 people, almost half became followers of Papunhank, and to European settlers they became known as “[[Quaker]] or religious Indians”, emphasizing the perceived gap between the two cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Plank, ''John Woolman’s Path'', p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; His syncretism of Munsee spirituality and Christianity was a source of conflict with some European missionaries, who sought a decreased emphasis on Indigenous traditional world views.&lt;ref&gt;''A Christian Indian of North America: Or, John Papunhank. A Narrative of Facts''. Dublin, (1830) p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these Europeans went so far as to call him a heathen, criticizing his adaptation of Christianity as offensive.&lt;ref&gt;A Member of the Brethren’s Church''. The History of the Moravian Mission Among the Indians in North America, From its Commencement to the Present time. With a Preliminary Account of the Indians''. T. Allman, (1838) p. 141-142.&lt;/ref&gt; Papunhank invited some [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] Christians to visit the village in the year 1756, where concerns were raised over the outbreak of the [[Seven Years' War|Seven Years War]] and general anxieties about the deterioration in Indigenous-settler relations were discussed.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Benezet, ''Some Observations on the Indian Natives of This Continent'', Joseph Crukshank. (1784) p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Papunhank’s skills as a negotiator and diplomat are worth noting, both for his impact within Indigenous society and in his interactions with colonial officials. He became critical of economic agreements made with colonial governments, and in 1760 refused offers of gifts from Pennsylvania, pointing to the ways in which some of these gift giving agreements had been used to exploit Indigenous communities into disadvantageous treaties.&lt;ref&gt;Jane T Merrit, ''At the Crossroads,'' p. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he adopted an argument that trade relationships should not be based on kinship ties, drawing on his Christian faith to emphasize that economic agreements should be equitable under God, attempting to find new grounds for more advantageous arrangements for his community.&lt;ref&gt;Jane T Merrit, ''At the Crossroads,'' p. 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt; Papunhank would again formulate criticisms and questions for Quaker missionaries in 1761, suggesting that although Europeans claimed to adhere to the Bible, they frequently interacted with Indigenous people in a way that clearly disregarded their scripture.&lt;ref&gt;Brendan McCaughey, “The Big Book and the Sword: A Study of Native American Disappointment With White Morality”, ''University of New Hampshire Scholars Repository''. (2011) p. 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt; As he argued, the [[Bible]] was supposed to direct the way in which Europeans lived their lives, yet they clearly adopted it only when it suited them, while continuing to dictate to Indigenous people how they should live their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Brendan McCaughey, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Goode is one scholar who has argued that Papunhank, in addition to his efforts to support temperance within his community, lobbied for cutting alcohol sales and trading by white settlers, efforts which gained him further attention from Quaker society.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Goode, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Papunhank’s critique of alcohol and its effect on society had a profound impact, as he became a model of piety and temperance to Quakers, many of whom were involved in the alcohol trade.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Goode, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; The location of Machiwihilusing with its proximity to the Pennsylvania settlements, encouraged Papunhank to engage in these diplomatic exchanges, attempting to bridge the gap between the communities by making himself an indispensable ally to the Pennsylvania government.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Goode, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he reached out to the governor in 1763 after the [[Paxton Boys]] massacred some [[Susquehannock]] Indigenous people, appealing to settlers’ common faith in an attempt to de-escalate the cyclical violence of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Jane T Merritt, “Dreaming of the Saviors Blood”, p. 746.&lt;/ref&gt; His efforts to bring about more peaceful relationships with settlers at times brought him trouble from Indigenous groups, at one point he was attacked and injured with a tomahawk for accosting some Indigenous people who had stolen horses from colonizers.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Goode, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; While Papunhank may not have wielded a position of power over all Munsee people, he certainly held enough influence to catch the attention of missionaries, several of whom visited his village. When he preached to a Quaker audience via means of a translator, some in attendance came to believe that he had been blessed with direct communication with God and were struck with his similarities to their religious world views.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Plank. “Quaker Reform and Evangelization in the Eighteenth Century”, ''American Studies,'' Vol. 59, No. 2. (2014) p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

One Quaker who took the journey to Machiwihilusing was [[John Woolman]], who felt compelled to do so after having met Papunhank earlier in 1761 when he had been in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;Jay David Miller. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;  To embark on such a journey during a time of increasing violence speaks to his dedication to see Papunhank again, visiting his village despite language and cultural barriers.&lt;ref&gt;Jay David Miller, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;  He would write fondly of his time spent in the region, describing feelings of mutuality while engaging in a shared feeling of religious experience that contrasted much of the violence that surrounded them.&lt;ref&gt;Jay David Miller, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1763, Papunhank was baptised as a Moravian by a prominent missionary and clergyman [[David Zeisberger]], during his visit to the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hahn-Bruckart &amp; Rachel Wheeler. “On an Eighteenth-Century Trail of Tears: The Travel Diary of Johann Jacob Schmick of the Moravian Indian Congregations Journey to the Susquehanna, 1765”, ''Journal of Moravian History'', Vol. 15, No. 1. (2015) p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; He adopted the name Johannes, and in the context of heightened colonial violence infringing upon their village he petitioned officials in Philadelphia to start a new settlement with Moravian support.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hahn-Bruckart &amp; Rachel Wheeler, p. 52-54.&lt;/ref&gt; This settlement began in 1765 and came to be known as Friedenshutten, which was composed of mostly Munsee and Mohicans with a limited number of Moravian settlers.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hahn-Bruckart &amp; Rachel Wheeler, p. 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt; This community was short-lived and was displaced by 1768 following an influx of white British colonizers.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hahn-Bruckart &amp; Rachel Wheeler, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1771 an accusation was levelled against Papunhank by another Munsee healer, who alleged that Papunhank may have poisoned a community member.&lt;ref&gt;Amy C. Schutt. “Tribal Identity in the Moravian Missions on the Susquehanna”, ''Pennsylvania History: A Journal of Mid-Atlantic Studies'', Vol. 66, No. 3, (1999) p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; These rumours were ultimately sidelined but are reflective of divisions within his social group.&lt;ref&gt;Amy C. Schutt. p. 391-392.&lt;/ref&gt;  Papunhank retained his spiritual and religious views until he eventually died May 15, 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Earl P Olmstead, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; He left behind a daughter named Sophia.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hahn-Bruckart &amp; Rachel Wheeler, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;</text>

'''Sir James Paul McCartney''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CH|MBE}} (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and composer. He gained worldwide fame as the bass guitarist and singer for the rock band [[the Beatles]], widely considered the most popular and influential group in the history of [[popular music]]. His [[Lennon–McCartney|songwriting partnership with]] [[John Lennon]] remains the most successful in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newman|first1=Jason|title=It Takes Two: 10 Songwriting Duos That Rocked Music History|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/467781/it-takes-two-10-songwriting-duos-that-rocked-music-history|website=billboard.com|accessdate=5 October 2017|date=23 August 2011|quote=By any measure, no one comes close to matching the success of The Beatles' primary songwriters.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Break-up of the Beatles|group disbanded]] in 1970, he pursued a solo career and formed the band [[Wings (band)|Wings]] with his first wife, [[Linda McCartney|Linda]], and [[Denny Laine]].

McCartney is one of [[List of best-selling music artists|the most successful composers and performers of all time]]. More than 2,200 artists have covered his Beatles song "[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]", making it one of the most covered songs in popular music history. Wings' 1977 release "[[Mull of Kintyre (song)|Mull of Kintyre]]" is one of the all-time best-selling singles in the UK. [[List of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees#Performers|A two-time inductee]] into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and as a solo artist in 1999), and an 18-time [[Grammy Award]] winner, McCartney has written, or co-written, 32 songs that have reached number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and {{as of|2009|lc=y}} he had 25.5&amp;nbsp;million [[RIAA]]-certified units in the United States. McCartney, Lennon, [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]] all received appointment as [[Order of the British Empire|Members of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1965 and, in 1997, McCartney was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] for services to music. McCartney is also one of the wealthiest musicians in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$1.2 billion.

McCartney has released an extensive catalogue of songs as a solo artist and has composed classical and electronic music. He has taken part in projects to promote international charities related to such subjects as [[animal rights]], [[seal hunting]], [[land mines]], vegetarianism, poverty, and [[music education]]. He has married three times and is the father of five children.

James Paul McCartney was born on 18 June 1942 in [[Walton, Liverpool|Walton Hospital]], Liverpool, England, where his mother, Mary Patricia (née Mohin), had qualified to practise as a nurse. His father, James ("Jim") McCartney, was absent from his son's birth due to his work as a volunteer firefighter during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=75}} McCartney has one younger brother named [[Mike McGear|Michael]] and a stepsister, Ruth. The children were baptised in their mother's [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] faith, even though their father was a former [[Protestantism|Protestant]], who had turned [[Agnosticism|agnostic]].

McCartney attended Stockton Wood Road Primary School in [[Speke]] from 1947 until 1949, when he transferred to Joseph Williams Junior School in [[Belle Vale, Liverpool|Belle Vale]] because of overcrowding at Stockton.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=1}}: Transferred to Joseph Williams Junior School due to overcrowding at Stockton; {{harvnb|Carlin|2009|p=13}}: Transferred to Joseph Williams in 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, with only three others out of ninety examinees, he passed the [[Eleven-Plus exam|11-Plus]] exam, meaning he could attend the [[Liverpool Institute High School for Boys|Liverpool Institute]], a [[grammar school]] rather than a [[secondary modern school]].&lt;ref&gt;For his attendance at Joseph Williams Junior School see: {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/merseyside/8203923.stm|title=Beatle's schoolboy photo auction|publisher=BBC News|date=16 August 2009|accessdate=13 June 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502022815/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/merseyside/8203923.stm|archivedate=2 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}; For McCartney passing the 11-plus exam see: {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=9}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Benitez|2010|pp=1–2}}: (secondary source).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, he met schoolmate [[George Harrison]] on the bus from his suburban home in Speke.

McCartney's mother, Mary, was a [[midwife]] and the family's primary wage earner; her earnings enabled them to move into [[20&amp;nbsp;Forthlin Road]] in [[Allerton, Merseyside|Allerton]], where they lived until 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=2}}: "Mary was the family's primary wage earner"; {{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=340–341}}: "where they lived through 1964".&lt;/ref&gt; She rode a bicycle to her patients; McCartney described an early memory of her leaving at "about three in the morning [the] streets&amp;nbsp;... thick with snow".{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=6}} On 31 October 1956, when McCartney was 14, his mother died of an [[embolism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=2}}: On Mary's death (secondary source); {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=20}}: On Mary's death (primary source); {{harvnb|Womack|2007|p=10}}: Mary died from an embolism.&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney's loss later became a point of connection with [[John Lennon]], whose mother, [[Julia Lennon|Julia]], had died when he was 17.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=31}}

McCartney's father was a trumpet player and pianist, who had led Jim Mac's Jazz Band in the 1920s. He kept an [[upright piano]] in the front room, encouraged his sons to be musical and advised Paul to take piano lessons, but Paul preferred to learn [[Learning music by ear|by ear]].{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=22–23}}{{refn|group=nb|Jim McCartney's father Joe played an E-flat [[tuba]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=71}} Jim pointed out the bass parts in songs on the radio, and often took his sons to local [[brass band]] concerts.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=23–24}}}} At age 11, he encouraged Paul to audition for the [[Liverpool Cathedral]] choir but he was not accepted.

American [[rhythm and blues]] influenced him, and [[Little Richard]] was his schoolboy idol; "[[Long Tall Sally]]" was the first song McCartney performed in public, at a [[Butlin's Filey]] holiday camp talent competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=509}}: McCartney: "The first song I ever sang in public was "Long Tall Sally"., 533–534: Harry: "Long Tall Sally", was "The first number Paul ever sang on stage".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

=== 1957–1960: The Quarrymen ===
{{main|The Quarrymen}}
At the age of fifteen on 6 July 1957, McCartney met John Lennon and his band, the Quarrymen, at the St Peter's Church Hall fête in [[Woolton]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=93}} The Quarrymen played a mix of rock and roll and [[skiffle]], a type of [[popular music]] with [[jazz]], [[blues]] and [[folk music|folk]] influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=95}}: "The Quarrymen played a spirited set of songs—half skiffle, half rock 'n roll".&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, the members of the band invited McCartney to join as a rhythm guitarist, and he formed a close working relationship with Lennon. Harrison joined in 1958 as lead guitarist, followed by Lennon's art school friend [[Stuart Sutcliffe]] on bass, in 1960.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=18}} By May 1960 the band had tried several names, including ''Johnny and the Moondogs'', ''Beatals'' and ''the Silver Beetles''.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=18–22}} They adopted the name ''the Beatles'' in August 1960 and recruited drummer [[Pete Best]] shortly before a five-engagement residency in [[Hamburg]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=17–25}}

The Beatles were informally represented by [[Allan Williams]]; in 1960, the group booked its first performance at a residency in Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miles|2001|pp=23–24}}: Williams booking for them to perform in Hamburg; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=200}}: Williams booking them in Hamburg in 1960, {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=243}}: "Williams had never formally served as the Beatles manager".&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|During their extended stays there over the next two years, they performed as the resident group at the Indra, and later the [[Kaiserkeller]], both owned by [[Bruno Koschmider]].

In August 1965, the Beatles released the McCartney composition "[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]", featuring a [[string quartet]]. Included on the ''[[Help! (album)|Help!]]'' LP, the song was the group's first recorded use of classical music elements and their first recording that involved only a single band member.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buk|1996|p=51}}: Their first recording that involved only a single band member; {{harvnb|Gould|2007|p=278}}: The group's first recorded use of classical music elements in their music.&lt;/ref&gt; "Yesterday" became one of the most covered songs in popular music history.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=157–158}}: "Yesterday" as the most covered song in history.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, during recording sessions for the album ''[[Rubber Soul]]'', McCartney began to supplant Lennon as the dominant musical force in the band. [[Musicology|Musicologist]] [[Ian MacDonald]] wrote, "from [1965]&amp;nbsp;... [McCartney] would be in the ascendant not only as a songwriter, but also as instrumentalist, arranger, producer, and ''de facto'' musical director of the Beatles."{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=172}} Critics described ''Rubber Soul'' as a significant advance in the refinement and profundity of the band's music and lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levy|2005|p=18}}: ''Rubber Soul'' is described by critics as an advancement of the band's music; {{harvnb|Brown|Gaines|2002|pp=181–82}}: As they explored facets of romance and philosophy in their lyrics.&lt;/ref&gt; Considered a high point in the Beatles catalogue, both Lennon and McCartney said they had written the music for the song "[[In My Life]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=169–170}}: "In My Life" as a highlight of the Beatles catalogue.; {{Harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=587}}: Both Lennon and McCartney have claimed lead authorship for "In My Life".&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney said of the album, "we'd had our cute period, and now it was time to expand."{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=197}} Recording engineer [[Norman Smith (record producer)|Norman Smith]] stated that the ''Rubber Soul'' sessions exposed indications of increasing contention within the band: "the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious&amp;nbsp;... [and] as far as Paul was concerned, George [Harrison] could do no right—Paul was absolutely finicky."{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=780}}

In 1966, the Beatles released the album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]''. Featuring sophisticated lyrics, studio experimentation, and an expanded repertoire of [[Music genre|musical genres]] ranging from innovative string arrangements to [[psychedelic rock]], the album marked an artistic leap for the Beatles.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=348}} The first of three consecutive McCartney [[A-side and B-side|A-sides]], the single "[[Paperback Writer]]" preceded the LP's release.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=195}}: The first of three consecutive McCartney A-sides; {{harvnb|Lewisohn|1992|pp=350–351}}: ''Revolver''{{'}}s release was preceded by "Paperback Writer".&lt;/ref&gt; The Beatles produced a short promotional film for the song, and another for its B-side, "[[Rain (Beatles song)|Rain]]". The films, described by Harrison as "the forerunner of [[music video|videos]]", aired on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in June 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The Beatles|2000|p=214}}: "the forerunner of videos"; {{harvnb|Lewisohn|1992|pp=221–222}}: The films aired on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' and ''Top of the Pops''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Revolver'' also included McCartney's "[[Eleanor Rigby]]", which featured a [[Octet (music)|string octet]].

The band gave their final commercial concert at the end of their [[The Beatles' 1966 US tour|1966 US tour]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=230}} Later that year, McCartney completed his first musical project independently of the group—a [[film score]] for the UK production ''[[The Family Way (soundtrack)|The Family Way]]''.

Epstein's death at age 32 in August 1967 created a void, which left the Beatles perplexed and concerned about their future.{{sfn|Brown|Gaines|2002|p=247}} McCartney stepped in to fill that void and gradually became the ''de facto'' leader and business manager of the group that Lennon had once led.{{sfn|Benitez|2010|pp=8–9}} In his first creative suggestion after this change of leadership, McCartney proposed that the band move forward on their plans to produce a film for television, which was to become ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]''. According to Beatles' historian [[Mark Lewisohn]], the project was "an administrative nightmare throughout".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=238–239}} McCartney largely directed the film, which brought the group their first unfavourable critical response.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=455–456}} However, the [[Magical Mystery Tour|film's soundtrack]] was more successful. It was released in the UK as a six-track double [[extended play]] disc (EP), and as an identically titled LP in the US, filled out with five songs from the band's recent singles.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=350–351}} The only Capitol compilation later included in the group's official canon of studio albums, the ''Magical Mystery Tour'' LP achieved $8&amp;nbsp;million in sales within three weeks of its release, higher initial sales than any other Capitol LP up to that point.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=699}}

The Beatles' animated film ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'', loosely based on the imaginary world evoked by McCartney's 1966 [[Yellow Submarine (song)|composition]], premiered in July 1968.

McCartney was depressed after the group disbanded. His wife helped him pull out of that condition by praising his work as a songwriter and convincing him to continue writing and recording. In her honour, he wrote "[[Maybe I'm Amazed]]", explaining that with the Beatles breaking up, "that was my feeling: Maybe I'm amazed at what's going on... Maybe I'm a man and maybe you're the only woman who could ever help me; Baby won't you help me understand...

After the Beatles [[Break-up of the Beatles|broke up]] in 1970, McCartney continued his musical career with his first solo release, ''[[McCartney (album)|McCartney]]'', a US number-one album.

McCartney had this to say on the group's formation: "Wings were always a difficult idea&amp;nbsp;... any group having to follow [the Beatles'] success would have a hard job&amp;nbsp;... I found myself in that very position.

Following the addition of guitarist [[Henry McCullough]], Wings' first concert tour began in 1972 with a debut performance in front of an audience of seven hundred at the [[University of Nottingham]]. Ten more gigs followed as they travelled across the UK in a van during an unannounced [[Wings University Tour|tour of universities]], during which the band stayed in modest accommodation and received pay in [[coin]]age collected from students, while avoiding Beatles songs during their performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2002|p=845}}: "traveled across the UK"; {{harvnb|Ingham|2009|p=106}}: "Scrupulously avoiding Beatles songs".&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney later said, "The main thing I didn't want was to come on stage, faced with the whole torment of five rows of press people with little pads, all looking at me and saying, 'Oh well, he is not as good as he was.' So we decided to go out on that university tour which made me less nervous&amp;nbsp;... by the end of that tour I felt ready for something else, so we went into Europe."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=847}} During the seven-week, 25-show [[Wings Over Europe Tour]], the band played almost solely Wings and McCartney solo material: the Little Richard cover "Long Tall Sally" was the only song that had previously been recorded by the Beatles. McCartney wanted the tour to avoid large venues; most of the small halls they played had capacities of fewer than 3,000 people.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=845}}

In March 1973, Wings achieved their first US number-one single, "[[My Love (Paul McCartney and Wings song)|My Love]]", included on their second LP, ''[[Red Rose Speedway]]'', a US number one and UK top five.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=641–642}}: "My Love", {{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=744–745}}: ''Red Rose Speedway''; {{harvnb|McGee|2003|p=245}}: Peak US chart positions for ''Red Rose Speedway''; {{harvnb|Roberts|2005|p=312}}: Peak UK chart position for ''Red Rose Speedway''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|In May 1973, Wings began a [[Wings 1973 UK Tour|21-show tour of the UK]], this time with supporting act [[Brinsley Schwarz]].{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=847}}}} McCartney's collaboration with Linda and former Beatles producer Martin resulted in the song "[[Live and Let Die (song)|Live and Let Die]]", which was the theme song for the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] film [[Live and Let Die (film)|of the same name]].

McCartney ventured into [[orchestral music]] in 1991, when the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society]] commissioned a musical piece by him to celebrate its [[sesquicentennial]].

== Musicianship ==
McCartney was largely a self-taught musician, and his approach was described by musicologist Ian MacDonald as "by nature drawn to music's formal aspects yet wholly untutored&amp;nbsp;... [he] produced technically 'finished' work almost entirely by instinct, his harmonic judgement based mainly on perfect pitch and an acute pair of ears ... [A] natural melodist—a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=12}}: Natural melodist, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=13}}: Perfect pitch and an acute pair of ears.&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney commented, "I prefer to think of my approach to music as&amp;nbsp;... rather like the primitive cave artists, who drew without training."{{sfn|Benitez|2010|p=134}}

=== Bass guitar ===
McCartney's skill as a bass player has been acknowledged by other bassists, including [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Dr. Dre]] bassist [[Mike Elizondo]], and [[Colin Moulding]] of [[XTC]].{{sfn|Bacon|Morgan|2006|p=8}} Best known for primarily using a [[plectrum]] or [[Guitar pick|pick]], McCartney occasionally plays fingerstyle.{{sfn|Bacon|Morgan|2006|p=28}} He does not use [[Slapping (music)|slapping]] techniques.{{sfn|Jisi|2005|p=42}} He was strongly influenced by [[Motown]] artists, in particular [[James Jamerson]], whom McCartney called a hero for his [[Melody|melodic]] style. He was also influenced by [[Brian Wilson]], as he commented: "because he went to very unusual places".{{sfn|Bacon|Morgan|2006|pp=38–39}} Another favourite bassist of his is [[Stanley Clarke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mulhern|1990|p=18}}: The influence of Motown and James Jamerson, {{harvnb|Mulhern|1990|p=22}}: Stanley Clarke.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quote= Paul is one of the most innovative bass players ... half the stuff that's going on now is directly ripped off from his Beatles period ... He's an egomaniac about everything else, but his bass playing he'd always been a bit coy about.{{sfn|Sheff|Golson|1981|p=142}} |source= — Lennon, ''Playboy'' magazine, January 1981|width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

During McCartney's early years with the Beatles, he primarily used a [[Höfner 500/1]] bass, although from 1965, he favoured his [[Rickenbacker 4001]]S for recording. While typically using [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox amplifiers]], by 1967 he had also begun using a [[Fender Bassman]] for amplification.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Babiuk|Bacon|2002|pp=16–17}}: Höfner 500/1, {{harvnb|Babiuk|Bacon|2002|pp=44–45}}: Rickenbacker 4001, {{harvnb|Babiuk|Bacon|2002|pp=85–86, 92–93, 103, 116, 134, 140, 173, 175, 187, 211}}: Vox amplifiers; {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=298}}: Fender Bassman.&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he used a [[Wal (bass)|Wal 5-String]], which he said made him play more thick-sounding [[bassline]]s, in contrast to the much lighter Höfner, which inspired him to play more sensitively, something he considers fundamental to his playing style.{{sfn|Jisi|2005|p=42}} He changed back to the Höfner around 1990 for that reason.{{sfn|Jisi|2005|p=42}} He uses [[Mesa Boogie#Bass amps|Mesa Boogie]] bass amplifiers while performing live.{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=19}}

MacDonald identified "[[She's a Woman]]" as the turning point when McCartney's bass playing began to evolve dramatically, and Beatles biographer Chris Ingham singled out ''Rubber Soul'' as the moment when McCartney's playing exhibited significant progress, particularly on "[[The Word (song)|The Word]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=133–134}}: "She's a Woman"; {{harvnb|Ingham|2009|p=299}}: "began to come into its own".&lt;/ref&gt; Bacon and Morgan agreed, calling McCartney's [[Groove (music)|groove]] on the track "a high point in pop bass playing and ... the first proof on a recording of his serious technical ability on the instrument."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bacon|Morgan|2006|pp=10, 44}}: ''Rubber Soul'' as the starting point for McCartney's bass improvement, {{harvnb|Bacon|Morgan|2006|p=98}}: "a high point in pop bass playing".&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald inferred the influence of [[James Brown]]'s "[[Papa's Got a Brand New Bag]]" and [[Wilson Pickett]]'s "[[In the Midnight Hour]]", American [[Soul music|soul]] tracks from which McCartney absorbed elements and drew inspiration as he "delivered his most spontaneous bass-part to date".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=178–180}}

Bacon and Morgan described his bassline for the Beatles song "Rain" as "an astonishing piece of playing&amp;nbsp;... [McCartney] thinking in terms of both rhythm and 'lead bass'&amp;nbsp;... [choosing] the area of the neck&amp;nbsp;... he correctly perceives will give him clarity for melody without rendering his sound too thin for groove."{{sfn|Bacon|Morgan|2006|pp=112–113}} MacDonald identified the influence of [[Indian classical music]] in "exotic [[melisma]]s in the bass part" on "Rain" and described the playing as "so inventive that it threatens to overwhelm the track".{{snf|MacDonald|2005|pp=196–198}} By contrast, he recognised McCartney's bass part on the Harrison-composed "[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]" as creative but overly busy and "too fussily extemporised".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=349}} McCartney identified ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' as containing his strongest and most inventive bass playing, particularly on "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]".{{sfn|Jisi|2005|p=45–46}}

=== Acoustic guitar ===
{{quote box|quote= If I couldn't have any other instrument, I would have to have an acoustic guitar.{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=22}} |source= — McCartney, ''Guitar Player'', July 1990|width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

McCartney primarily [[Flatpicking|flatpicks]] while playing acoustic guitar, though he also uses elements of [[Fingerstyle guitar|fingerpicking]].{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=22}} Examples of his acoustic guitar playing on Beatles tracks include "Yesterday", "I'm Looking Through You", "[[Michelle (song)|Michelle]]", "[[Blackbird (Beatles song)|Blackbird]]", "[[I Will]]", "[[Mother Nature's Son]]" and "[[Rocky Raccoon]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=157–158}}: "Yesterday", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=174–175}}: "I'm Looking Through You", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=175–176}}: "Michelle", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=291–292}}: "Blackbird", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=305–306}}: "Mother Nature's Son", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=308}}: "Rocky Raccoon", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=315}}: "I Will".&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney singled out "Blackbird" as a personal favourite and described his technique for the guitar part in the following way: "I got my own little sort of cheating way of [fingerpicking] ... I'm actually sort of pulling two strings at a time&amp;nbsp;... I was trying to emulate those [[Folk music|folk]] players."{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=22}} He employed a similar technique for "[[Jenny Wren]]".{{sfn|Molenda|2005|p=79}} He played an [[Epiphone Texan]] on many of his acoustic recordings, but also used a [[Martin HD-7|Martin D-28]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Babiuk|Bacon|2002|pp=146–147, 152, 161, 164}}: Epiphone Texan; {{harvnb|Babiuk|Bacon|2002|pp=215, 218, 222, 239}}: Martin D-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electric guitar ===
{{quote box|quote= Linda was a big fan of my guitar playing, whereas I've got my doubts. I think there are proper guitar players and then there are guys like me who love playing it.{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=23}} |source= — McCartney, ''Guitar Player'', July 1990|width=20%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

[[File:Paul-mccartney-1350317931.jpg|thumb|alt=McCartney points to the audience while performing on stage.|McCartney playing a [[Gibson Les Paul]] in concert, 2009]]

McCartney played lead guitar on several Beatles recordings, including what MacDonald described as a "fiercely angular slide guitar solo" on "[[Drive My Car]]", which McCartney played on an [[Epiphone Casino]]. McCartney said of the instrument, "if I had to pick one electric guitar it would be this."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Babiuk|Bacon|2002|p=149}}: "If I had to pick one electric guitar"; {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=166–167}}: "Drive My Car", "fiercely angular slide guitar solo".&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed what MacDonald described as "a startling guitar solo" on the Harrison composition "[[Taxman]]" and the "shrieking" guitar on "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" and "[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]". MacDonald also praised McCartney's "coruscating pseudo-Indian" guitar solo on "[[Good Morning Good Morning]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=200–201}}: "Taxman", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=232–234}}: "Sgt.

[[File:Paul McCartney in The White House.jpg|thumb|alt=McCartney performing on a piano while singing into a microphone.|Paul McCartney performing in the [[East Room]] of the [[White House]], 2010]]
McCartney played piano on several Beatles songs, including "She's a Woman", "[[For No One]]", "[[A Day in the Life]]", "Hello, Goodbye", "[[Lady Madonna]]", "Hey Jude", "[[Martha My Dear]]", "Let It Be" and "The Long and Winding Road".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=178–180}}: "She's a Woman", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=205–206}}: "For No One", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=227–232}}: "A Day in the Life", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=272–273}}: "Hello, Goodbye", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=275–276}}: "Lady Madonna", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=302–304}}: "Hey Jude", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=322}}: "Martha My Dear", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=337–338}}: "Let It Be", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=339–341}}: "The Long and Winding Road".&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald considered the piano part in "Lady Madonna" as reminiscent of [[Fats Domino]], and "Let It Be" as having a gospel rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=275–276}}: "Lady Madonna", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=337–338}}: "Let It Be".&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald called McCartney's [[Mellotron]] intro on "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]" an integral feature of the song's character.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=219}} McCartney played a [[Moog synthesizer]] on the Beatles song "[[Maxwell's Silver Hammer]]" and the Wings track "Loup (1st Indian on the Moon)".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=357}}: "Maxwell's Silver Hammer"; {{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=46}}: "Loup (1st Indian on the Moon)".&lt;/ref&gt; Ingham described the Wings songs "[[With a Little Luck]]" and "[[London Town (Wings song)|London Town]]" as being "full of the most sensitive pop synthesizer touches".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ingham|2009|p=117}}: "the most sensitive pop synthesizer touches"; {{harvnb|Blaney|2007|p=123}}: McCartney playing keyboards on "London Town".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tape loops ===
In the mid-1960s, when visiting artist friend [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]]'s flat in London, McCartney brought [[Magnetic tape|tapes]] he had compiled at then-girlfriend [[Jane Asher]]'s home. They included mixes of various songs, musical pieces and comments made by McCartney that [[Dick James]] made into a demo for him.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=217–218}} Heavily influenced by American [[avant-garde]] musician [[John Cage]], McCartney made [[tape loops]] by recording voices, guitars and bongos on a [[Brenell Engineering|Brenell]] [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|tape recorder]] and splicing the various loops. He referred to the finished product as "electronic symphonies".{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=219–220}} He reversed the tapes, sped them up, and slowed them down to create the desired effects, some of which the Beatles later used on the songs "[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]" and "[[The Fool on the Hill]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=185–193}}: Tape loops used on "Tomorrow Never Knows"; {{Harvnb|Everett|1999|pp=138–139}}: Tape loops used on "The Fool on the Hill".&lt;/ref&gt;

Pepper'' cover, McCartney replied, "Elvis was too important and too far above the rest even to mention ... so we didn't put him on the list because he was more than merely a ... pop singer, he was Elvis the King."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=727}} McCartney stated that for his bassline for "[[I Saw Her Standing There]]", he directly quoted Berry's "[[I'm Talking About You]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=66–67}}: "According to McCartney, the bassline was taken from&amp;nbsp;"...I'm Talking About You"; {{harvnb|Mulhern|1990|p=18}}: McCartney: "I'm not gonna tell you I wrote the thing when Chuck Berry's bass player did; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=94}}: McCartney: "I played exactly the same notes as he did and it fitted our number perfectly".&lt;/ref&gt;

McCartney called Little Richard an idol, whose [[falsetto]] [[Vocal music|vocalisations]] inspired McCartney's own vocal technique.{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=33}} McCartney said he wrote "I'm Down" as a vehicle for his Little Richard impersonation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=156}}: (secondary source); {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=201}}: (primary source).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, McCartney bought the publishing rights to Holly's catalogue, and in 1976, on the fortieth anniversary of Holly's birth, McCartney inaugurated the annual "Buddy Holly Week" in England. The festival has included guest performances by famous musicians, songwriting competitions, drawing contests and special events featuring performances by [[the Crickets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=420–425}}: "Buddy Holly Week" 1976–2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at school during the 1950s, McCartney thrived at art assignments, often earning top accolades for his visual work. However, his lack of discipline negatively affected his academic grades, preventing him from earning admission to art college.{{sfn|Carlin|2009|pp=44–45}} During the 1960s, he delved into the visual arts, explored experimental cinema, and regularly attended film, theatrical and classical music performances. His first contact with the London [[avant-garde]] scene was through artist [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]], who introduced McCartney to art dealer [[Robert Fraser (art dealer)|Robert Fraser]].{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=307}} At Fraser's flat he first learned about art appreciation and met [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], and [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]].{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=243}} McCartney later purchased works by [[Magritte]], using his painting of an apple for the [[Apple Records]] logo.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=256–267}} McCartney became involved in the renovation and publicising of the [[Indica Gallery]] in Mason's Yard, London, which [[Barry Miles]] had co-founded and where Lennon first met [[Yoko Ono]]. Miles also co-founded ''[[International Times]]'', an underground paper that McCartney helped to start with direct financial support and by providing interviews to attract advertiser income. Miles later wrote McCartney's official biography, ''[[Many Years From Now]]'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2000a|pp=549–550}}: Indica Gallery renovation and Lennon meeting Ono; {{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=549–550}}: Miles as McCartney's official biographer; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|pp=232, 237–238}}: Barry Miles and ''IT''.&lt;/ref&gt;

McCartney became interested in painting after watching artist [[Willem de Kooning]] work in de Kooning's [[Long Island]] studio.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=84}} McCartney took up painting in 1983, and he first exhibited his work in [[Siegen]], Germany, in 1999.

McCartney signed his first recording contract, as a member of the Beatles, with [[Parlophone|Parlophone Records]], an [[EMI]] subsidiary, in June 1962. In the United States, the Beatles recordings were distributed by EMI subsidiary [[Capitol Records]]. The Beatles re-signed with EMI for another nine years in 1967. After forming their own record label, [[Apple Records]], in 1968, the Beatles' recordings would be released through Apple although the masters were still owned by EMI.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=350–351}} Following the break-up of the Beatles, McCartney's music continued to be released by Apple Records under the Beatles' 1967 recording contract with EMI which ran until 1976. Following the formal dissolution of the Beatles' partnership in 1975, McCartney re-signed with EMI worldwide and Capitol in the US, Canada and Japan, acquiring ownership of his solo catalogue from EMI as part of the deal. In 1979, McCartney signed with [[Columbia Records]] in the US and Canada—reportedly receiving the industry's most lucrative recording contract to date, while remaining with EMI for distribution throughout the rest of the world.{{sfn|McGee|2003|pp=125–126}} As part of the deal, CBS offered McCartney ownership of Frank Music, publisher of the catalogue of American songwriter [[Frank Loesser]].

In 1963, [[Dick James]] established [[Northern Songs]] to publish the songs of Lennon–McCartney.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=365}} McCartney initially owned 20% of Northern Songs, which became 15% after a public stock offering in 1965. In 1969, James sold a controlling interest in Northern Songs to [[Lew Grade]]'s [[Associated Television]] (ATV) after which McCartney and John Lennon sold their remaining shares although they remained under contract to ATV until 1973. In 1972, McCartney re-signed with ATV for seven years in a joint publishing agreement between ATV and [[MPL Communications|McCartney Music]]. Since 1979, MPL Communications has published McCartney's songs.

McCartney and [[Yoko Ono]] attempted to purchase the Northern Songs catalogue in 1981, but Grade declined their offer and decided to sell ATV in its entirety to businessman [[Robert Holmes à Court]]. [[Michael Jackson]] subsequently purchased ATV in 1985. McCartney has criticised Jackson's purchase and handling of Northern Songs over the years. In 1995, Jackson merged his catalogue with Sony for a reported £59,052,000 ($95&amp;nbsp;million), establishing Sony/ATV Music Publishing, in which he retained half-ownership.&lt;ref name="JacksonBailout"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/13/business/media/13music.html?ex=1302580800&amp;en=45bff2f7a4da68fe&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss |title=Michael Jackson Bailout Said to Be Close |first=Jeff |last=Leeds |first2=Andrew Ross |last2=Sorkin |work=The New York Times |date=13 April 2006 |accessdate=26 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918161053/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/13/business/media/13music.html?ex=1302580800&amp;en=45bff2f7a4da68fe&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss |archivedate=18 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Northern Songs was formally dissolved in 1995, and absorbed into the Sony/ATV catalogue.&lt;ref name="Harry 2002 456–459"&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=456–459}}: McCartney was unhappy about Jackson's purchase and handling of Northern Songs; {{harvnb|Southall|Perry|2006|p=203}}: Northern Songs dissolved and absorbed into Sony/ATV.&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney receives writers' royalties which together are 33⅓ percent of total commercial proceeds in the US, and which vary elsewhere between 50 and 55 percent.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=195}} Two of the Beatles' earliest songs—"[[Love Me Do]]" and "[[P.S. I Love You (Beatles song)|P.S. I Love You]]"—were published by an EMI subsidiary, Ardmore &amp; Beechwood, before signing with James.

=== Drugs ===
McCartney first used drugs in the Beatles' [[Hamburg]] days, when they often used [[Preludin]] to maintain their energy while performing for long periods.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=66–67}} [[Bob Dylan]] introduced them to [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] in a New York hotel room in 1964; McCartney recalls getting "very high" and "giggling uncontrollably".{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=186–189}} His use of the drug soon became habitual, and according to Miles, McCartney wrote the lyrics "another kind of mind" in "[[Got to Get You into My Life]]" specifically as a reference to cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|Gaines|2002|p=182}}: Habitual marijuana use by McCartney and the Beatles; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=190}}: Marijuana references in Beatles songs.&lt;/ref&gt; During the filming of ''[[Help!

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'', and for about a year total but stopped because of his dislike of the unpleasant melancholy he felt afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=247}}: Cocaine use during ''Sgt. Pepper'' recording sessions; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|pp=384–385}}: McCartney used the drug for about a year then stopped.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially reluctant to try [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], McCartney eventually did so in late 1966, and took his second "[[Psychedelic experience|acid trip]]" in March 1967, with Lennon, after a ''Sgt. Pepper'' studio session.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miles|1997|pp=379–380}}: First LSD "trip", {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=382}}: Second LSD "trip".&lt;/ref&gt; He later became the first Beatle to discuss the drug publicly, declaring, "It opened my eyes&amp;nbsp;... [and] made me a better, more honest, more tolerant member of society."{{sfn|Brown|Gaines|2002|p=228}} He made his attitude about cannabis public in 1967, when he, along with the other Beatles and Epstein, added his name to a July advertisement in ''The Times'', which called for its legalisation, the release of those imprisoned for possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=386–387}}

In 1972, a Swedish court fined McCartney £1,000 for cannabis possession. Soon after, Scottish police found marijuana plants growing on his farm, leading to his 1973 conviction for [[Cannabis cultivation|illegal cultivation]] and a £100 fine. As a result of his drug convictions, the US government repeatedly denied him a visa until December 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=300–307}}: Drugs.&lt;/ref&gt; Arrested again for marijuana possession in 1975, in Los Angeles, Linda took the blame, and the court soon dismissed the charges. In January 1980, when Wings flew to Tokyo for a tour of Japan, customs officials found approximately 8&amp;nbsp;ounces (200&amp;nbsp;g) of cannabis in his luggage. They arrested McCartney and brought him to a local jail while the Japanese government decided what to do. After ten days, they released and deported him without charge.{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=459–461}} In 1984, while McCartney was on holiday in Barbados, authorities arrested him for possession of marijuana and fined him $200.{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=300–307}} Upon his return to England, he stated: "cannabis is&amp;nbsp;... less harmful than rum punch, whiskey, nicotine and glue, all of which are perfectly legal&amp;nbsp;... I don't think&amp;nbsp;... I was doing anyone any harm whatsoever."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=306}} In 1997, he spoke out in support of decriminalisation of the drug: "People are smoking pot anyway and to make them criminals is wrong."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=307}} He did however, decide to quit cannabis in 2015, citing a desire to set a good example for his grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/paul-mccartney-quit-cannabis-because-he-didnt-want-to-set-a-bad-example-to-his-grandchildren-10286647.html|title=Paul McCartney reveals what made him finally stop smoking cannabis|date=30 May 2015|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=10 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624105150/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/paul-mccartney-quit-cannabis-because-he-didnt-want-to-set-a-bad-example-to-his-grandchildren-10286647.html|archivedate=24 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, McCartney wrote to [[14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso]], the 14th [[Dalai Lama]], asking him why he was not a vegetarian. As McCartney explained, "He wrote back very kindly, saying, 'my doctors tell me that I must eat meat'. And I wrote back again, saying, you know, I don't think that's right&amp;nbsp;... I think he's now being told&amp;nbsp;... that he can get his protein somewhere else&amp;nbsp;...

In 2015, following British prime minister [[David Cameron]]'s decision to give Members of Parliament a free vote on amending the law against [[fox hunting]], McCartney was quoted: "The people of Britain are behind this [[Conservative Party (UK)|Tory]] government on many things but the vast majority of us will be against them if hunting is reintroduced.

=== Meditation ===
In August 1967, McCartney met the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] at the [[London Hilton Hotel|London Hilton]] and later went to [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] in North Wales to attend a weekend initiation conference, where he and the other Beatles learned the basics of [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=261}} He said, "The whole meditation experience was very good and I still use the mantra&amp;nbsp;...

=== Girlfriends ===

==== Dot Rhone ====
McCartney's first serious girlfriend in Liverpool was Dot Rhone, whom he met at the [[The Casbah Coffee Club|Casbah club]] in 1959.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=163}} According to Spitz, Rhone felt that McCartney had a compulsion to control situations. He often chose clothes and make-up for her, encouraging her to grow her hair out like [[Brigitte Bardot]]'s, and at least once insisting she have it re-styled, to disappointing effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=69}}: Encouraging Rhone to grow her hair out like Bardot; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=171}}: Rhone had her hair re-styled to disappointing effect.&lt;/ref&gt; When McCartney first went to Hamburg with the Beatles, he wrote to Rhone regularly, and she accompanied [[Cynthia Lennon]] to Hamburg when they played there again in 1962.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=239–240}} The couple had a two-and-a-half-year relationship, and were due to marry until Rhone's miscarriage; according to Spitz, McCartney, now "free of obligation", ended the engagement.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=348}}

==== Jane Asher ====
McCartney first met British actress [[Jane Asher]] on 18 April 1963, when a photographer asked them to pose at a Beatles performance at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=101–102}} The two began a relationship, and in November of that year he took up residence with Asher at her parents' home at 57 Wimpole Street, London.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=439}} They had lived there for more than two years before the couple moved to McCartney's own home in [[St. John's Wood]], in March 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miles|1997|pp=104–107}}: Living at the Asher home, 254: McCartney's move to his home in St. John's Wood.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote several songs while living at the Ashers', including "Yesterday", "[[And I Love Her]]", "[[You Won't See Me]]" and "[[I'm Looking Through You]]", the latter three having been inspired by their romance.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=108}} They had a five-year relationship and planned to marry, but Asher broke off the engagement after she discovered he had become involved with [[Francie Schwartz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=27–32}}: Jane Asher, {{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=777–778}}: Francie Schwartz.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wives ===

==== Linda Eastman ====
[[File:Paul McCartney with Linda McCartney - Wings - 1976.jpg|thumb|alt=McCartney, seated, playing a twelve-string acoustic guitar, Linda McCartney can be seen seated to his right.|McCartney performing with wife Linda in 1976]]

[[Linda McCartney|Linda Eastman]] was a music fan who once commented, "all my teen years were spent with an ear to the radio."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=585}} At times, she played [[hookey]] to see artists such as [[Fabian Forte|Fabian]], [[Bobby Darin]] and [[Chuck Berry]].{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=585}} She became a popular photographer with several rock groups, including [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]], the Grateful Dead, [[the Doors]] and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=587}} The pair first properly met in 1967 at a [[Georgie Fame]] concert at [[The Bag O'Nails]] club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to&amp;nbsp;... Pushiness worked for me that night!"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2002|p=45}}: Paul and Linda's first meeting, {{harvnb|Harry|2002|p=587}}: "Pushiness worked for me that night!"; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|pp=432–434}}: Linda's UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London.&lt;/ref&gt; Linda said this about their meeting: "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else [that night]&amp;nbsp;... and I saw Paul at the other side of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=587}} The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, "We had a lot of fun together&amp;nbsp;... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment."{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=514–515}} He added, "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off&amp;nbsp;... [it's] miraculous that we made it. But we did."{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=525}}

After the Beatles' break-up, the two collaborated musically and formed Wings in 1971.{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=904–910}} They faced derision from some fans and critics, who questioned her inclusion. She was nervous about performing with Paul, who explained, "she conquered those nerves, got on with it and was really gutsy."{{sfn|Lewisohn|2002|p=45}} Paul defended her musical ability: "I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard&amp;nbsp;... She took a couple of lessons and learned some bluesy things&amp;nbsp;... she did very well and made it look easier than it was&amp;nbsp;... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her—she's playing with one finger.' But what they didn't know is that sometimes she was playing a thing called a [[Minimoog]], which could only be played with one finger. It was [[Monophonic synthesizer|monophonic]]."{{sfn|Lewisohn|2002|p=45}} He went on to say, "We thought we were in it for the fun&amp;nbsp;... it was just something we wanted to do, so if we got it wrong—big deal. We didn't have to justify ourselves."{{sfn|Lewisohn|2002|p=45}} Former Wings guitarist McCullough said of collaborating with Linda, "trying to get things together with a learner in the group didn't work as far as I was concerned."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=84}}

They had four children—Linda's daughter [[Heather McCartney|Heather]] (legally adopted by Paul), [[Mary McCartney|Mary]], [[Stella McCartney|Stella]] and [[James McCartney|James]]—and remained married until Linda's death from breast cancer at age 56 in 1998.{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=585–601}} After Linda died, Paul stated in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', "I got a counsellor because I knew that I would need some help. He was great, particularly in helping me get rid of my guilt [about wishing I'd been] perfect all the time&amp;nbsp;... a real bugger. But then I thought, hang on a minute. We're just human. That was the beautiful thing about our marriage. We were just a boyfriend and girlfriend having babies."{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=600–601}}

==== Heather Mills ====
In 2002, McCartney married [[Heather Mills]], a former model and anti-[[land mine|landmines]] campaigner.{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=568–578}} In 2003, the couple had a child, Beatrice Milly, named in honour of Mills' late mother, and one of McCartney's aunts.{{sfn|Sounes|2010|p=523}} They separated in April 2006 and divorced acrimoniously in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sounes|2010|p=532}}: Separation, {{harvnb|Sounes|2010|p=546}}: Divorce.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he commented on media animosity toward his partners: "[the British public] didn't like me giving up on Jane Asher&amp;nbsp;... I married [Linda], a New York divorcee with a child, and at the time they didn't like that".&lt;ref name="MaccaSMH"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/06/11/1086749891275.html | title = McCartney's lament: I can't buy your love | newspaper = The Sydney Morning Herald | date = 12 June 2004 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120508142554/http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/06/11/1086749891275.html | archivedate = 8 May 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== John Lennon ====
Though McCartney had a strained relationship with Lennon, they briefly became close again in early 1974, and [[A Toot and a Snore in '74|played music together]] on one occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Badman|1999|pp=122–123}}; {{harvnb|Doggett|2009|pp=218–219}}; {{harvnb|Sandford|2006|pp=227–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, the two grew apart.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=587}} While McCartney would often phone Lennon, he was apprehensive about the reception he would receive. During one call, Lennon told him, "You're all pizza and fairytales!"{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=588}} In an effort to avoid talking only about business, they often spoke of cats, babies, or baking bread.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=590}}

On 24 April 1976, McCartney and Lennon were watching an episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' together at Lennon's home in [[the Dakota]], when [[Lorne Michaels]] made a $3,000 cash offer for the Beatles to reunite. While they seriously considered going to the ''SNL'' studio a few blocks away, they decided it was too late. This was their last time together.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=504–505}}: On 24 April 1976, the two were watching ''Saturday Night Live'', last time Lennon and McCartney spent time together; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=592}}: Lennon: "We nearly got a cab, but we were actually too tired".&lt;/ref&gt; [[VH1]] fictionalised this event in the 2000 television film ''[[Two of Us (2000 film)|Two of Us]]''.{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=869–870}} McCartney's last telephone call to Lennon, days before Lennon and Ono released ''[[Double Fantasy]]'', was friendly; he said this about the call: "[It is] a consoling factor for me, because I do feel it was sad that we never actually sat down and straightened our differences out. But fortunately for me, the last phone conversation I ever had with him was really great, and we didn't have any kind of blow-up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodman|first=Joan|title=Playboy Interview: Paul and Linda McCartney|journal=Playboy|volume=31, no. 12|issue=December 1984|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Reaction to Lennon's murder =====
{{main|Death of John Lennon}}

{{quote box|quote= John is kinda like a constant&amp;nbsp;... always there in my being&amp;nbsp;... in my soul, so I always think of him".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Graff|2000|p=40}}: "John is kinda like a constant&amp;nbsp;... always there in my being,{{harvnb|Graff|2000|p=96}}: "in my soul, so I always think of him".&lt;/ref&gt; |source= — McCartney, ''Guitar World'', January 2000 |width=20%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

On 9 December 1980, McCartney followed the news that Lennon had been murdered the previous night; [[Death of John Lennon|Lennon's death]] created a [[Media circus|media frenzy]] around the surviving members of the band.{{sfn|Carlin|2009|pp=255–257}} McCartney was leaving an [[Oxford Street]] recording studio that evening when he was surrounded by reporters who asked him for his reaction; he responded: "It's a drag". The press quickly criticised him for what appeared to be a superficial response.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=505}} He later explained, "When John was killed somebody stuck a microphone at me and said: 'What do you think about it?' I said, 'It's a dra-a-ag' and meant it with every inch of melancholy I could muster. When you put that in print it says, 'McCartney in London today when asked for a comment on his dead friend said, "It's a drag".' It seemed a very flippant comment to make."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=505}} He described his first exchange with Ono after the murder, and his last conversation with Lennon:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I talked to Yoko the day after he was killed, and the first thing she said was, "John was really fond of you." The last telephone conversation I had with him we were still the best of mates. He was always a very warm guy, John. His bluff was all on the surface. He used to take his glasses down, those granny glasses, and say, "it's only me." They were like a wall you know? A shield. Those are the moments I treasure.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=505}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1983, McCartney said, "I would not have been as typically human and standoffish as I was if I knew John was going to die. I would have made more of an effort to try and get behind his "mask" and have a better relationship with him."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=505}} He said that he went home that night, watched the news on television with his children and cried most of the evening. In 1997, he said that Lennon's death made the remaining ex-Beatles nervous that they might also be murdered.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=594}} He told ''Mojo'' magazine in 2002 that Lennon was his greatest hero.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=506}} In 1981, McCartney sang backup on Harrison's tribute to their ex-bandmate, "[[All Those Years Ago]]", which featured Starr on drums.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=20}} McCartney released "[[Here Today (Paul McCartney song)|Here Today]]" in 1982, a song Everett described as "a haunting tribute" to McCartney's friendship with Lennon.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=10}}

==== George Harrison ====
Discussing his relationship with McCartney, Harrison said, "Paul would always help along when you'd done his ten songs—then when he got 'round to doing one of my songs, he would help. It was silly. It was very selfish, actually&amp;nbsp;... There were a lot of tracks, though, where I played bass&amp;nbsp;... because what Paul would do—if he'd written a song, he'd learn all the parts for Paul and then come in the studio and say (sometimes he was very difficult): 'Do this'. He'd never give you the opportunity to come out with something."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glazer|first=Mitchell|title=Growing Up at 33⅓: The George Harrison Interview|journal=Crawdaddy|issue=February 1977|pages=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Harrison's death in November 2001, McCartney said he was "a lovely guy and a very brave man who had a wonderful sense of humour". He went on to say, "We grew up together and we just had so many beautiful times together&amp;nbsp;– that's what I am going to remember. I'll always love him, he's my baby brother."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1363989/Ill-always-love-him-hes-my-baby-brother-says-tearful-McCartney.html|title=I'll always love him, he's my baby brother, says tearful McCartney|work=The Telegraph|last1=Poole|first1=Oliver|last2=Davies|first2=Hugh|date=1 December 2001|accessdate=4 May 2012|location=London|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507033014/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1363989/Ill-always-love-him-hes-my-baby-brother-says-tearful-McCartney.html|archivedate=7 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the first anniversary of his death, McCartney played Harrison's "Something" on a [[ukulele]] at the [[Concert for George]].{{sfn|Doggett|2009|pp=332–333}} He also performed "[[For You Blue]]" and "[[All Things Must Pass (song)|All Things Must Pass]]", and played the piano on [[Eric Clapton]]'s rendition of "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]".{{sfn|Harry|2003|pp=138–139}}

==== Ringo Starr ====
During a recording session for ''The Beatles'' in 1968, the two got into an argument over McCartney's critique of Starr's drum part for "Back in the U.S.S.R.", which contributed to Starr temporarily leaving the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2002|p=816}}; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=495}}: "Paul ticked Ringo off over a fluffed tom-tom fill. They had already argued about how the drum part should be played&amp;nbsp;... and Paul's criticisms finally brought matters to a head"; {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=310}}: "The ill-feeling&amp;nbsp;... finally erupted&amp;nbsp;... after an argument with McCartney over the drum part".&lt;/ref&gt; Starr later commented on working with McCartney: "Paul is the greatest bass player in the world. But he is also very determined&amp;nbsp;... [to] get his own way&amp;nbsp;... [thus] musical disagreements inevitably arose from time to time."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=816}}

McCartney and Starr collaborated on several post-Beatles projects starting in 1973, when McCartney contributed instrumentation and backing vocals for "Six O'Clock", a song McCartney wrote for Starr's album ''[[Ringo (album)|Ringo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/music/index.ssf/2010/12/song_of_the_day_six_oclock_rin.html|title=Song of the Day: 'Six O'Clock,' Ringo Starr|work=NJ.com|accessdate=27 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129163356/http://www.nj.com/entertainment/music/index.ssf/2010/12/song_of_the_day_six_oclock_rin.html|archivedate=29 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney played a [[kazoo]] solo on another track from the album "[[You're Sixteen]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZhDx0XKwzPkC&amp;pg=PA187|title=The Complete How to Kazoo|accessdate=27 September 2014|isbn=9780761142218|year=2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122020745/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZhDx0XKwzPkC&amp;pg=PA187|archivedate=22 January 2016|df=dmy-all|last1=Stewart|first1=Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Starr appeared (as a fictional version of himself) in McCartney's 1984 film ''[[Give My Regards to Broad Street (film)|Give My Regards to Broad Street]]'', and played drums on most tracks of the [[Give My Regards to Broad Street|soundtrack album]], which includes re-recordings of several McCartney-penned Beatles songs. Starr played drums and sang backing vocals on "[[Beautiful Night (Paul McCartney song)|Beautiful Night]]" from McCartney's 1997 album ''Flaming Pie''. The pair collaborated again in 1998, on Starr's ''[[Vertical Man]]'', which featured McCartney's backing vocals on three songs, and instrumentation on one.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|pp=279–281}} In 2009, the pair performed "[[With a Little Help from My Friends]]" at a benefit concert for the [[David Lynch Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2009-04-05-paul-ringo_N.htm|title=McCartney, Starr reunite for Lynch Foundation benefit|date=6 April 2009|last=Gardner|first=Elysa|work=USA Today|accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They collaborated on Starr's album ''[[Y Not]]'' in 2010.

McCartney was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1988 as a member of the Beatles and again as a solo artist in 1999.

'''Punjabi folk religion''' incorporates local mysticism &lt;ref&gt;Nagendra Kr Singh, Abdul Mabud Khan (2001) Encyclopaedia of the World Muslims: Tribes, Castes and Communities, Volume 3.

There are many shrines in Punjabi folk religion which represents the folk religion of the [[Punjab region]] which is a discourse between different organised religions.&lt;ref&gt;Replicating Memory, Creating Images: Pirs and Dargahs in Popular Art and Media of Contemporary East Punjab Yogesh Snehi {{cite web |url=http://kjc-sv006.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/visualpilgrim/demo/essay-detail.php?eid=18&amp;page=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109133939/http://kjc-sv006.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/visualpilgrim/demo/essay-detail.php?eid=18&amp;page=1 |archivedate=2015-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These shrines represent inter-communal dialogue and a distinct form of cultural practice of saint veneration.&lt;ref&gt;Historicity, Orality and ‘Lesser Shrines’: Popular Culture and Change at the Dargah of Panj Pirs at Abohar,” in Sufism in Punjab: Mystics, Literature and Shrines, ed.

==Punjabi folk cosmology==
[[File:Tapa Singh Shaheed.jpg|thumb|Tapa Singh Shaheed]]
Punjabis, irrespective of their organised religion, continue to practice Punjabi folk religion which at times runs independently of organised religion or derives beliefs from institutionalised religions which then form part of Punjabi folk religion.

In [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] folk cosmology, the universe is divided into three realms:&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journalfall04.html Centre for Sikh Studies, University of California. Journal of Punjab Studies Fall 2004 Vol 11, No.2 H.S.Bhatti and D.M. Michon: Folk Practice in Punjab]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Jathera''—ancestral shrines===
{{see also|Totem}}
A ''jathera'' is a [[shrine]] constructed to commemorate and show respect to the founding common [[ancestor]] of a [[surname]] and all subsequent common [[clan]] ancestors.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Whenever a founder of a village dies, a shrine is raised to him on the outskirts of the village and a ''jandi'' tree is planted there. A village may have many such shrines.

The ''jathera'' can be named after the founder of the surname or the village. However, many villages have unnamed ''jathera''. In some families, the founder of the ''jathera'' is also a [[saint]]. In such instances, the founder has a dual role of being the head of a ''jathera'' (who is venerated by his descendants) and also of being a [[saint]] (such as Baba Jogi Pir; who can be worshiped by any one).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Punjabi surname lineage===
Punjabi people believe that members of a [[surname]] all hail from one common [[ancestor]]. A surname in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] is called a ''gaut'' or ''[[gotra]]''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Members of a surname are then subdivided into smaller clans comprising related members who can trace their family tree. Typically, a clan represents people related within at least seven generations but can be more.&lt;ref&gt;This is not definitive&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient times, it was normal for a [[village]] to comprise members of one surname. When people moved to form a new village, they continued to pay homage to the founding ''jathera''. This is still the case for many people who may have new ''jathera'' in their villages but still pay homage to the founding ancestor of the entire surname.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Over time, Punjabi villages changed their composition whereby families from different surnames came to live together. A village therefore can have one ''jathera'' which can be communally used by members of different surnames but has the founder of the village as the named ancestor or many ''jathera'' can be built to represent the common ancestors of specific surnames.&lt;ref&gt;A Glossary of the tribes &amp; castes of Punjab by H. A Rose&lt;/ref&gt;

When members of a clan form a new village, they continue to visit the ''jathera'' in the ancestral village. If this is not possible, a link is brought from the old ''jathera'' to construct a new ''jathera'' in the new village.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Attendance===
People visit the ''jathera'' when getting married, the 15th of the Indian month and sometimes on the first Sunday of an Indian month. The descendants of the elder go to a pond and dig earth and make shivlinga and some put it on the mound of their ''jathera'' and offer ghee and flowers to the Jathera.So, It is a form of shivlinga puja also. In some villages it is customary to offer flour.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Veneration===
[[File:19th century Indian shrine 01.jpg|thumb|19th century Indian shrine 01]]
''Jathera'' veneration is not strictly a part of organised religion and forms part of Punjabi folk religion. ''Jathera'' veneration in Punjab does not take the same form as in organised religion and is seen as showing respect to elders.

The following are some fairs celebrated in [[Punjab region|Punjab]].

===Baba Kaallu Nath Mela===
A large [[Mela]] is organized at village Nathana (near Bhucho Mandi) in district [[Bathinda]] in the month of February–March in honor of Baba Kaallu Nath of the Romana surname. The [[Mela]]  lasts for four days.  The first day is especially for Romana's and three days for all people to attend.

===Baba Kala Mehar Mela===
A Mela is held in honor of Baba Kala Mehar every year in [[Amritsar]] district.

The fair takes place in and around April each year with Sandhus and people from other clans and tribes attending from around Punjab and [[Rajasthan]].

According to  legend, Baba Kala Mehar used to tend to his cattle and one day while doing so, he happened to meet Baba Gorakh Nath ([[Gorakshanath]]). Baba Gorakh Nath asked Pir Baba Kala Mehar if he can give him some milk from his buffaloes. A miracle happened that while the cattle being tended at that time were all bulls, Baba Ji is said to have miraculously taken milk out of bulls on striking them with his stick.

===Baba Jogi Pir Mela===
The village of Bhopal falls in the [[Mansa, Punjab|Mansa]] tehsil of [[Bathinda]] district.

The village is known for the fair of Baba Jogi Pir&lt;ref name="Gazetteer"&gt;[http://punjabrevenue.nic.in/gaz_bath1.htm#cont Gazetteer of Bathinda 1992 Edition]&lt;/ref&gt; who is said to be the guru (preceptor) of Chahal jatts. It is said that during the times of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule, Baba Jogi Pir fought against the forces of the Mughal rulers.

During the battle, his head was chopped off, but his headless body kept on fighting until it fell down dead in this village. The people were deeply touched by the sacrifice of Jogi Pir, constructed a shrine, and began to hold a fair.&lt;ref name="Gazetteer" /&gt;

Another legend narrates that once a few people stayed under a grove of trees in the premises of the shrine. They felt pangs of thirst at night, but there was no source of water where from they could quench their  thirst . A heavenly voice which was believed to be that of Jogi Pir was heard: “why do you die of thirst? Pick out a brick from the pond and take water”. They did likewise, found water from underneath the brick they picked up and thus they quenched their thirst.&lt;ref name="Gazetteer" /&gt;

A fair is held twice annually for three days on Bhadon  28 (August–September)and Chet 16 (March- April) at the shine of Jogi Pir. It is attended by both [[Hindus]] and [[Sikhs]]. The people pay their obeisance at the shrine, especially after the birth of a child or the solemnization of marriage. Earth is also scooped one of the tank by the people for invoking the blessings of Jogi Pir.&lt;ref name="Gazetteer" /&gt;

==Shrines==
[[File:Shrine Baba Budda Ji Nakodar.JPG|thumb|Shrine Baba Budda Ji Nakodar]]
Shrines in honour of saints are common in the [[Punjab region]]. A [[Shaheed Shrine]] is a building constructed to commemorate and show respect to a [[saint]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandip Singh Chohan, Thesis for the University of Wolverhampton: The Phenomenon of possession and exorcism in North India and amongst the Punjabi Diaspora in Wolverhampton [http://wlv.openrepository.com/wlv/bitstream/2436/48796/1/Chohan_MPhil%20thesis.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muslim]] shrines are referred to a [[dargah]]s and [[Hindu]] shrines are known as samadhs.

==Khetri and Goddess Gorjas farm==
Traditionally, on the first day of Navratri people in Punjab sow pulses, cereals and other seeds in a pot which is watered for nine days at the end of which the seeds sprout. This custom is known as "Khetri". It signifies prosperity  and abundance. It is very important to plant grains of barley in a pot. On the tenth day, the shoots are about 3 - 5 inches in length. On [[Dussehra]] Goddess Gorja (Goddess Parvati),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nameandfame.org/g.html&lt;/ref&gt; in the form of seedlings, is covered with a piece of red cloth and worshipped and propitiated. After saying prayers, these seedlings or the "Khetri" is submerged in water on [[Dussehra]]. This custom suggests a link to harvesting. The sowing and reaping of barley is symbolic of the "first fruit".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mantraonnet.com/navratri.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webindia123.com/punjab/festivals/festivals1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, Punjabi farmers traditionally start to harvest the [[kharif]] (monsoon) rice crops after [[Dussehra]] and sow the wheat ([[rabi crop]])  after [[Diwali]]. Therefore, Dussehra doubles up as a thanksgiving festival and Diwali is also considered to be a harvest festival.

'''[[Maharaja]] Ranjit Singh''' (1780&amp;nbsp;–1839)&lt;ref name=eos/&gt;&lt;ref name=britranjit/&gt; was the leader of the [[Sikh Empire]], which ruled the northwest [[Indian subcontinent]] in the early half of the 19th century. He survived [[smallpox]] in infancy but lost sight in his left eye. He fought his first battle alongside his father at age 10. After his father died, he fought several wars to expel the [[Afghans]] in his teenage years and was proclaimed as the "Maharaja of Punjab" at age 21.&lt;ref name=eos/&gt;&lt;ref name="Singh2008p9"/&gt; His empire grew in the [[Punjab region]] under his leadership through 1839.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition 1911 Page 892"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition, (Edition: Volume V22, Date: 1910-1911), Page 892.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grewal6"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grewal|first=J.

Prior to his rise, the Punjab region had numerous warring [[misls|misl]]s (confederacies), twelve of which were under Sikh rulers and one Muslim.&lt;ref name="Singh2008p9"/&gt; Ranjit Singh successfully absorbed and united the Sikh misls and took over other local kingdoms to create the Sikh Empire.

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:Ranjet Singh's Birth place..jpg|thumb|Birthplace of Ranjit Singh in [[Gujranwala]], [[Pakistan]].]]
Ranjit Singh was born on 13 November 1780, to [[Maha Singh|Maha Singh Sukerchakia]] and [[Raj Kaur]] – the daughter of [[Raja]] Gajpat Singh of Jind, in [[Gujranwala]], in the [[Majha]] region of [[Punjab region|Punjab]] (now in [[Pakistan]]) His birth name was Buddh Singh, after his ancestor who was a disciple of [[Guru Gobind Singh]], a Khalsa, and whose descendants created the Sukerchakia ''[[misl]]'' before the birth of Ranjit Singh, which became the most powerful of many small Sikh kingdoms in northwestern Southern Asia in the wake of the disintegrating Mughal Empire.&lt;ref name="Lafont2002p33"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Marie Lafont|title=Maharaja Ranjit Singh: Lord of the Five Rivers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zjduAAAAMAAJ |year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-566111-8 |pages=33–34, 15–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The child's name was changed to Ranjit (literally, "victor in battle") by his father to commemorate his army's victory over the Muslim Chatha chieftain Pir Muhammad.&lt;ref name=eos/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patwant Singh|title=Empire of the Sikhs: The Life and Times of Maharaja Ranjit Singh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vr4VAQAAIAAJ |year=2008|publisher=Peter Owen|isbn=978-0-7206-1323-0|pages=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranjit Singh contracted [[smallpox]] as an infant, which resulted in the loss of sight in his left eye and a pockmarked face.&lt;ref name=eos/&gt; He was short in stature, never schooled, and did not learn to read or write anything beyond the [[Gurmukhi]] alphabet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patwant Singh|title=Empire of the Sikhs: The Life and Times of Maharaja Ranjit Singh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vr4VAQAAIAAJ |year=2008|publisher=Peter Owen|isbn=978-0-7206-1323-0|pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, he was trained at home in horse riding, musketry and other martial arts.&lt;ref name=eos/&gt;

At age 12, his father died.&lt;ref name="Lafont2002p33"/&gt; He then inherited his father's Sukkarchakkia misl estates and was raised by his mother Raj Kaur, who, along with Lakhpat Rai, also managed the estates.&lt;ref name=eos/&gt; The first attempt on his life was made when he was age 13, by Hashmat Khan, but Ranjit Singh prevailed and killed the assailant instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Khushwant Singh|title=Ranjit Singh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D068dKeyGW4C  |year=2008|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-306543-2 |page= 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 18, his mother died and Lakhpat Rai was assassinated, and thereon he was helped by his mother-in-law from his first marriage.&lt;ref name="Singh2008p7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Khushwant Singh|title=Ranjit Singh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D068dKeyGW4C  |year=2008|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-306543-2 |pages=7–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his teens, Ranjit Singh took to alcohol, a habit that intensified in the later decades of his life, according to the chronicles of his court historians and the Europeans who visited him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Khushwant Singh|title=Ranjit Singh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D068dKeyGW4C  |year=2008|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-306543-2 |pages= 6, 253–254 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Macintyre2008p154"/&gt; However, he neither smoked nor ate beef,&lt;ref name=eos/&gt; and required all officials in his court, regardless of their religion, to adhere to these restrictions as part of their employment contract.&lt;ref name="Macintyre2008p154"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben Macintyre|title=The Man Who Would Be King: The First American in Afghanistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i6XLFu1xMOMC |year=2008|publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-1-4668-0379-4|pages=154–157 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Marriages}}
[[File:Maharaja Ranjit Singh family.jpg|left|200px|thumb| Maharaja Ranjit Singh's family genealogy]]
Ranjit Singh married many times, in various ceremonies, and had twenty wives.&lt;ref name="Anand2015p13"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anita Anand|title=Sophia: Princess, Suffragette, Revolutionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cd4yBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13 |year=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-63286-081-1 |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patwant Singh|title=Empire of the Sikhs: The Life and Times of Maharaja Ranjit Singh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vr4VAQAAIAAJ |year=2008|publisher=Peter Owen|isbn=978-0-7206-1323-0|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars note that the information on Ranjit Singh's marriages is unclear, and there is evidence that he had many mistresses. According to Khushwant Singh in an 1889 interview with the French journal ''[[:fr:Le Voltaire (journal)|Le Voltaire]]'', his son Dalip (Duleep) Singh remarked, "I am the son of one of my father's forty-six wives".&lt;ref name=Singh2008p300&gt;{{cite book|author=Khushwant Singh|title=Ranjit Singh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D068dKeyGW4C  |year=2008|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-306543-2 |pages=300–301 footnote 35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 15, Ranjit Singh married his first wife [[Mehtab Kaur]],&lt;ref name="Lafont2002p33"/&gt; the only daughter of [[Gurbaksh Singh Kanhaiya]] and his wife [[Sada Kaur]], and the granddaughter of [[Jai Singh Kanhaiya]], the founder of the [[Kanhaiya Misl]].&lt;ref name=eos/&gt; This marriage was pre-arranged in an attempt to reconcile warring Sikh ''misls'', wherein Mahtab Kaur was betrothed to Ranjit Singh. However, the marriage failed, with Mehtab Kaur never forgiving the fact that her father had been killed by Ranjit Singh's father and she mainly lived with her mother after marriage. The separation became complete when Ranjit Singh married his second wife Raj Kaur of [[Nakai Misl]] in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx |title=Mahitab Kaur (d, 1813) |author=Sardar Singh Bhatia |website=Encyclopaedia of Sikhism |publisher=Punjabi University Patiala |accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mehtab Kaur died in 1813.&lt;ref name=Singh2008p300/&gt;

Raj Kaur (renamed [[Datar Kaur]]), the daughter of Sardar Ran Singh Nakai, the third ruler of Nakai Misl, was Ranjit Singh's second wife and the mother of his heir, Kharak Singh.&lt;ref name="Singh2008p7"/&gt; She changed her name from Raj Kaur to avoid confusion with Ranjit Singh's mother. Throughout her life she remained the favourite of Ranjit Singh, who called her ''Mai Nakain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx |title=Raj Kaur (d, 1838) |last1=Sardar Singh Bhatia |website=Encyclopaedia of Sikhism |publisher=Punjabi University Patiala |accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like his first marriage, the second marriage brought him a strategic military alliance.&lt;ref name="Singh2008p7"/&gt; His second wife died in 1818.&lt;ref name=Singh2008p300/&gt;
[[File:Maharaja Ranjit Singh with wives Wellcome V0045197.jpg|thumb|Maharaja Ranjit Singh with some of his wives.
]]
Ratan Kaur and Daya Kaur were wives of Sahib Singh Bhangi of Gujrat (a ''misl'' north of Lahore, not to be confused the state of Gujarat).&lt;ref name="Smith1920p690"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vincent Arthur Smith|title=The Oxford History of India: From the Earliest Times to the End of 1911|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=p2gxAQAAMAAJ |year=1920|publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=690–693 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Sahib Singh's death, Ranjit Singh took them under his protection in 1811 by marrying them via the rite of ''chādar andāzī'', in which a cloth sheet was unfurled over each of their heads.  Ratan Kaur gave birth to [[Multana Singh]] in 1819, and Daya Kaur gave birth to [[Kashmira Singh]] in 1819 and to [[Pashaura Singh]] in 1821.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx |title=Daya Kaur, Rani (d. 1843) and Ratan Kaur, Rani |last1=Sardar Singh Bhatia |website=Encyclopaedia of Sikhism |publisher=Punjabi University Patiala |accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His other wives include [[Moran Sarkar]] in 1802, Chand Kaur in 1815, Lakshmi in 1820, Mehatab Kaur in 1822, Saman Kaur in 1832, as well as Guddan, Banso, Gulbahar, Gulab, Ram Devi, Rani, Bannat, Har and Danno before his last marriage.&lt;ref name=Singh2008p300/&gt;

[[Jind Kaur]] was the final spouse of Ranjit Singh. Her father, Manna Singh Aulakh, extolled her virtues to Ranjit Singh, who was concerned about the frail health of his only heir, Kharak Singh. The Maharaja married her in 1835 by 'sending his arrow and sword to her village'.  On 6 September 1838 she gave birth to [[Duleep Singh]], who became the last Maharaja of the [[Sikh Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx |title=Jind Kaur, Maharani (1817–1863) |last1=Hasrat |first1=B. J. |website=Encyclopaedia of Sikhism |publisher=Punjabi University Patiala |accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Punishment by the Akal Takht===
In 1802, Ranjit Singh married [[Moran Sarkar]], a Muslim [[nautch girl]].&lt;ref name=Singh2008p300/&gt; This action, and other non-[[Sikh]] activities of the Maharaja, upset orthodox Sikhs, including the [[Nihang]]s, whose leader [[Akali Phula Singh]] was the [[Jathedar]] of the [[Akal Takht]].&lt;ref name=Kartar&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Kartar|title=Stories from Sikh History: Book-VII|date=1975|publisher=Hemkunt Press|location=New Delhi|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Ranjit Singh visited [[Amritsar]], he was called outside the Akal Takht, where he was made to apologise for his mistakes. Akali Phula Singh took Ranjit Singh to a tamarind tree in front of the Akal Takht and prepared to punish him by flogging.&lt;ref name=Kartar/&gt; Then Akali Phula Singh asked the nearby Sikh pilgrims whether they approved of Ranjit Singh's apology. The pilgrims responded with ''[[Sat Sri Akal]]'' and Ranjit Singh was released and forgiven.

===Sons===
Ranjit Singh had eight sons. [[Kharak Singh]] was the eldest from his second wife. His first wife gave birth to [[Ishar Singh (Sikh prince)|Ishar Singh]], who died at the age of two, and, after her separation from Ranjit Singh, to the twins [[Tara Singh (Sikh prince)|Tara Singh]] and [[Sher Singh]]. The two widows he took under his protection and married gave birth to [[Multana Singh]], [[Kashmira Singh]] and [[Pashaura Singh]]. [[Duleep Singh]] was from his last wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx |title=Articles on named sons of Ranjit Singh |website=Encyclopaedia of Sikhism, Editor-in-Chief: Harbans Singh |publisher=Punjabi University Patiala |accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranjit Singh acknowledged only Kharak Singh and Duleep Singh as his biological sons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-rZFAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR1&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;dq=colburn+%22five+years+in+india%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3Www8WZn_A&amp;sig=BTFJODlwDZ1QojCA-Mqk-MRSNfY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OJ0lU4m8McaShgfuzYDQCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=colburn%20%22five%20years%20in%20india%22&amp;f=false |title=Five Years in India, Volume 1, Chapter VII, page 120 |last1=Fane |first1=Henry Edward |year=1842 |website= |publisher=Henry Colburn |accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/ladyloginsrecoll00logirich#page/n9/mode/2up |title=Lady Login's Recollections, Chapter VII, page 85 |last1=E.

In the 1830s, Ranjit Singh suffered from numerous health complications as well as a stroke, which some historical records attribute to alcoholism and a failing liver.&lt;ref name="Smith1920p690"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kartar Singh Duggal|title=Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the Last to Lay Arms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4udb8LsF3-oC&amp;pg=PA107 |year=2001|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-410-3|pages=107–108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in his sleep on 27 June 1839.&lt;ref name="Anand2015p13"/&gt; Four of his wives, and seven concubines with royal titles committed [[Sati (practice)|sati]] by throwing themselves on his funeral pyre by their own desire.&lt;ref name="Anand2015p13"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Altekar|first=Anant S.|page=132 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYG4K0yYHQgC&amp;pg=PA131|title=The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization: From Prehistoric Times to the Present Day |year=1956 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-8120803244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical context===
After the death of [[Aurangzeb]] in 1707, the Mughal Empire fell apart and declined in its ability to tax or govern most of the Indian subcontinent. In the northwestern region, particularly the Punjab, the creation of the [[Khalsa]] community of Sikh warriors by [[Guru Gobind Singh]] accelerated the decay and fragmentation of the Mughal power in the region.&lt;ref name="SinghFenech2014p60"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sunit Singh|editor=Pashaura Singh and Louis E. Fenech|title=The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7YwNAwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-100411-7 |pages=60–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Raiding Afghans attacked the Indus river valleys but met resistance from both organised armies of the Khalsa Sikhs as well as irregular Khalsa militias based in villages. The Sikhs had appointed their own ''[[zamindars]]'', replacing the previous Muslim revenue collectors, which provided resources to feed and strengthen the warriors aligned with Sikh interests.&lt;ref name="SinghFenech2014p60"/&gt; Meanwhile, colonial traders and the East India Company had begun operations in India on its eastern and western coasts.&lt;ref name="SinghFenech2014p60"/&gt;

By the second half of the 18th century, the northwestern parts of the Indian subcontinent (now Pakistan and parts of north India) were a collection of fourteen small warring regions.&lt;ref name="Singh2008p9"/&gt; Of the fourteen, twelve were Sikh-controlled ''misls'' (confederacies), one named Kasur (near Lahore) was Muslim controlled, and one in the southeast was led by an Englishman named George Thomas.&lt;ref name="Singh2008p9"&gt;{{cite book|author=Khushwant Singh|title=Ranjit Singh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D068dKeyGW4C |year=2008| publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-306543-2 |pages=9–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This region constituted the fertile and productive valleys of the five rivers – Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Bias and Sutlej.&lt;ref name="Smith1920p690"/&gt; The Sikh ''misls'' were all under the control of the Khalsa fraternity of Sikh warriors, but they were not united and constantly warred with each other over revenue collection, disagreements, and local priorities; however, in the event of external invasion such as from the Muslim armies of Ahmed Shah Abdali from Afghanistan, they would usually unite.&lt;ref name="Singh2008p9"/&gt;

Towards the end of 18th century, the five most powerful ''misls'' were those of Sukkarchakkia, Kanhayas, Nakkais, Ahluwalias and Bhangi Sikhs.&lt;ref name="Singh2008p9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lafont2002p33"/&gt; Ranjit Singh belonged to the first, and through marriage had a reliable alliance with Kanhayas and Nakkais.&lt;ref name="Singh2008p9"/&gt; Among the smaller misls, some such as the Phulkias ''misl'' had switched loyalties in the late 18th century and supported the Afghan army invasion against their Khalsa brethren.&lt;ref name="Singh2008p9"/&gt; The Kasur region, ruled by Muslim, always supported the Afghan invasion forces and joined them in plundering Sikh ''misls'' during the war.&lt;ref name="Singh2008p9"/&gt;

===Rise to fame, early conquests===
[[File:Alfred Dedreux - Randjiit Sing Baadour.jpg|thumb|''"Randjiit Sing Baadour"'' by [[Alfred de Dreux]]]]
Ranjit Singh's fame grew in 1797, at age 17, when the Afghan Muslim ruler Shah Zaman, of the Ahmad Shah Abdali dynasty, attempted to annex Panjab region into his control through his general Shahanchi Khan and 12,000 soldiers.&lt;ref name="eos" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Singh2008p9" /&gt; The battle was fought in the territory that fell in Ranjit Singh controlled misl, whose regional knowledge and warrior expertise helped resist the invading army. This victory gained him recognition.&lt;ref name="eos" /&gt; In 1798, the Afghan ruler sent in another army, which Ranjit Singh did not resist. He let them enter Lahore, then encircled them with his army, blocked off all food and supplies, burnt all crops and food sources that could have supported the Afghan army. Much of the Afghan army retreated back to Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="eos" /&gt;

In 1799, Raja Ranjit Singh's army of 25,000 [[Sikh Khalsa Army|Khalsa]], supported by another 25,000 Khalsa led by his mother-in-law Rani Sada Kaur of Kanhaiya ''misl'', in a joint operation attacked the region controlled by Bhangi Sikhs centered around Lahore. The rulers escaped, marking Lahore as the first major conquest of Ranjit Singh.&lt;ref name="Singh2008p9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patwant Singh|title=Empire of the Sikhs: The Life and Times of Maharaja Ranjit Singh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vr4VAQAAIAAJ |year=2008|publisher=Peter Owen|isbn=978-0-7206-1323-0|pages=73–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sufi Muslim and Hindu population of Lahore welcomed the rule of Ranjit Singh.&lt;ref name="eos" /&gt; In 1800, the ruler of Jammu region ceded control of his region to Ranjit Singh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Marie Lafont|title=Maharaja Ranjit Singh: Lord of the Five Rivers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zjduAAAAMAAJ |year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-566111-8 |page=64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1801, Ranjit Singh proclaimed himself as the "Maharaja of Punjab", and agreed to a formal investiture ceremony, which was carried out by Baba Sahib Singh Bedi - a descendant of Guru Nanak. On the day of his coronation, prayers were performed across mosques, temples and gurudwaras in his territories for his long life.&lt;ref name="Singh2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh|title=Sikhism: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e0ZmAXw7ok8C&amp;pg=PA129|date=15 March 2011|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84885-321-8|pages=129–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranjit Singh called his rule as "Sarkar Khalsa", and his court as "Darbar Khalsa". He ordered new coins to be issued in the name of Guru Nanak named the "NanakShahi" ("of the Emperor Nanak").&lt;ref name="eos" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Khushwant Singh|title=Ranjit Singh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D068dKeyGW4C |year=2008| publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-306543-2 |page=35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oberoi1994p114"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harjot Oberoi|title=The Construction of Religious Boundaries: Culture, Identity, and Diversity in the Sikh Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dKl84EYFkTsC |year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-61593-6 |pages=114–115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===

In 1802 Ranjit Singh, aged 22, took Amritsar from the Bhangi Sikh ''misl'', paid homage at the [[Harmandir Sahib]] temple, which had previously been attacked and desecrated by the invading Afghan army, and announced that he would renovate and rebuild it with marble and gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patwant Singh|title=Empire of the Sikhs: The Life and Times of Maharaja Ranjit Singh| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vr4VAQAAIAAJ |year=2008| publisher=Peter Owen| isbn=978-0-7206-1323-0| pages=18, 177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ranjit Singh's golden throne.jpg|thumb|[[Maharaja Ranjit Singh's throne]], c. 1820–1830, Hafiz Muhammad Multani, now at V &amp; A Museum.]]
On 1 January 1806, Ranjit Singh signed a treaty with the British officials of the East India Company, in which he agreed that his Sikh forces would not attempt to expand south of the Sutlej river, and the Company agreed that it would not attempt to militarily cross the Sutlej river into the Sikh territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anita Anand|title=Sophia: Princess, Suffragette, Revolutionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cd4yBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13 |year=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-63286-081-1 |page=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1807, Ranjit Singh's forces attacked the Muslim ruled misl of [[Kasur]] and, after a month of fierce fighting, defeated the Afghan chief Qutb-ud-Din, thus expanding his empire northwest towards Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=eos&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx |title=RANJIT SINGH (1780–1839) |last1=Kushwant Singh |website=Encyclopaedia of Sikhism |publisher=Punjabi University Patiala |accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took [[Multan]] in 1818, and the whole [[Bari Doab]] came under his rule with that conquest. In 1819, he successfully defeated the Afghan Sunni Muslim rulers and annexed Srinagar and [[Kashmir]], stretching his rule into the north and the Jhelum valley, beyond the foothills of the Himalayas.&lt;ref name=eos/&gt;&lt;ref name=iahmed1998/&gt;

The most significant encounters between the Sikhs in the command of the Maharaja and the Afghans were in 1813, 1823, 1834 and in 1837.&lt;ref name=Grewal6/&gt; In 1813, Ranjit Singh's general [[Dewan Mokham Chand]] led the Sikh forces against the Afghan forces of [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Shah Mahmud]] led by [[Dost Mohammad Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patwant Singh|title=Empire of the Sikhs: The Life and Times of Maharaja Ranjit Singh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vr4VAQAAIAAJ |year=2008|publisher=Peter Owen|isbn=978-0-7206-1323-0|pages=113–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Afghans lost their stronghold at [[Battle of Attock|Attock]] in that battle.

In 1813–14, Ranjit Singh's first attempt to expand into Kashmir was foiled by Afghan forces led by General Azim Khan, due to a heavy downpour, the spread of cholera, and poor food supply to his troops.

In 1818, Darbar's forces led by Misr Dewan Chand occupied Multan, killing Muzaffar Khan and defeating his forces, leading to the end of Afghan influence in the Punjab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Khushwant|title=A History of the Sikhs: 1469–1838|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MD9uAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=1 April 2011|edition=2nd|date=11 October 2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-567308-1|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1818, an army from the Punjab defeated Jabbar Khan, a younger brother of governor of Kashmir Azim Khan, and acquired Kashmir, along with a yearly revenue of Rs seventy lacs. Dewan Moti Ram was appointed governor of Kashmir.

In November 1819, Dost Mohammed accepted the sovereignty of the Maharaja over [[Peshawar]], along with a revenue payment of Rs one lac a year. The Maharaja specifically ordered his forces not to harass or molest any civilian. In 1820 and 1821, Dera Ghazi Khan, Hazara and Mankera, with huge tracts of land between Jhelum and Indus, Singh Sagar Daob, were also annexed. The victories of Kashmir, Peshwar and Multan were celebrated by naming three newborns after them. Prince Kashmira Singh, Peshaura Singh and Prince Multana Singh were born to Daya Kaur and Ratan Kaur, wives of Ranjit Singh.

In 1823, Ranjit Singh defeated a large army of [[Yusufzai (Pashtun tribe)|Yusufzai]] north of the [[Kabul River]].&lt;ref name=patwantp120&gt;{{cite book|author=Patwant Singh|title=Empire of the Sikhs: The Life and Times of Maharaja Ranjit Singh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vr4VAQAAIAAJ |year=2008|publisher=Peter Owen|isbn=978-0-7206-1323-0|pages=120–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834, Mohammed Azim Khan once again marched towards Peshawar with an army of 25,000 Khattak and Yasufzai  tribesmen in the name of jihad, to fight against infidels. The Maharaja defeated the forces. Yar Mohammad was pardoned and was reinvested as governor of Peshawar with an annual revenue of Rs one lac ten thousand to Lahore Darbar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Khushwant|title=A History of the Sikhs: 1469–1838|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MD9uAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=1 April 2011|edition=2nd|date=11 October 2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-567308-1|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1837, the [[Battle of Jamrud]] and his march through Kabul in 1838, in cooperation with the colonial British army stationed in Sindh, became the last confrontation between the Sikhs led by him and the Afghans, which helped extend and establish the western boundaries of the Sikh Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Khushwant Singh|title=Ranjit Singh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D068dKeyGW4C  |year=2008|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-306543-2 |pages= 227–231, 246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=roylorge100&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kaushik Roy |author2= Peter Lorge|title=Chinese and Indian Warfare – From the Classical Age to 1870|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=627fBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100|year=2014|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-58710-1 |pages=100–103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838, Ranjit Singh with his troops marched into Kabul to take part in the victory parade along with the British after restoring Shah Shoja to the Afghan throne at Kabul.&lt;ref name=britranjit&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ranjit-Singh-Sikh-maharaja Ranjit Singh] Encyclopædia Britannica, Khushwant Singh (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Geography of the Sikh Empire====
[[File:Sikh Empire tri-lingual.jpg|thumb|Ranjit Singh's Sikh Empire at its peak]]
The Sikh Empire, also known as the Sikh Raj and Sarkar-a-Khalsa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx |title=KHALSA |last=Ganda Singh |website=Encyclopaedia of Sikhism |publisher=Punjabi University Patiala |access-date=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was in the Punjab region, the name of which means "the land of the five rivers". The five rivers are the [[Beas River|Beas]], [[Ravi River|Ravi]], [[Sutlej]], [[Chenab]] and [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]], all of which are tributaries of the river [[Indus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Marie Lafont|title=Maharaja Ranjit Singh: Lord of the Five Rivers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zjduAAAAMAAJ |year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-566111-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geographical reach of the Sikh Empire under Singh included all lands north of Sutlej river, and south of the high valleys of the northwestern Himalayas. The major towns at time included Srinagar, Attock, Peshawar, Bannu, Rawalpindi, Jammu, Gujrat, Sialkot, Kangra, Amritsar, Lahore and Multan.&lt;ref name="Smith1920p690"/&gt;{{Sfn|Marshall|2005|page=116}}

===Governance===
Maharaja Ranjit Singh allowed men from different religions and races to serve in his army and his government in various positions of authority.&lt;ref&gt;Kartar Singh Duggal (2001).

Abhinav Publications. pp. 125–126. {{ISBN|978-81-7017-410-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His army included a few Europeans, such as [[Jean-François Allard]], but he did not employ British people, who were attempting to create a colony in the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kuiper|first1=Kathleen|title=The culture of India|date=2010|publisher=Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=1615301496|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite not employing them, he did maintain a diplomatic channel with the British; in 1828, he sent gifts to [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] and in 1831, he sent a mission to Simla to confer with the British Governor General, [[Lord William Bentinck|William Bentinck]];&lt;ref name=prinsep152&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Thoby Prinsep|title=Origin of the Sikh Power in the Punjab, and Political Life of Muha-Raja Runjeet Singh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E8bz-gg6mD4C |year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-02872-1 |pages=152–161 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 1838, he cooperated with them in removing the hostile Islamic Sultan in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=roylorge100/&gt;

===Religious policies===

Ranjit Singh's policies were based on respect for all communities, Muslim, Hindu and Sikh.&lt;ref name= Singh2011 /&gt; A devoted Sikh, Ranjit Singh restored and built historic Sikh [[Gurdwara]]s – most famously, the [[Harmandir Sahib]], and used to celebrate his victories by offering thanks at the Harmandar. He also joined the Hindus in their temples, prohibited cow slaughter out of respect for Hindu sentiments,&lt;ref name= Singh2011 /&gt; and visited Sufi mosques and holy places. He ordered his soldiers to neither loot nor molest civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Khushwant Singh|title=Ranjit Singh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D068dKeyGW4C  |year=2008|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-306543-2 |pages= 25–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sikhs led by Singh never razed places of worship to the ground belonging to the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;K.S. Duggal, ''Ranjit Singh: A Secular Sikh Sovereign'', Abhinav Publications (1989) {{ISBN|81-7017-244-6}}''&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did convert Muslim mosques into other uses. For example, Ranjit Singh's army desecrated Lahore's [[Badshahi Mosque]] and converted it into an ammunition store,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AxnjJp_kpFkC&amp;pg=PA23|title=City of Sin and Splendour: Writings on Lahore|first=Bapsi|last=Sidhwa|year=2005|publisher=Penguin Books |accessdate=7 January 2017}}, '''Quote''':  In Lahore, just as he had grasped its historic citadel and put it to his own hardy use or desecrated the Badshahi Mosque and converted it into a functional ammuniation store..."&lt;/ref&gt; and horse stables.&lt;ref name=amin95&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amin|first1=Mohamed |last2= Willetts|first2= Duncan|last3= Farrow|first3= Brendan|title=Lahore|date=1988|publisher=Ferozsons|isbn=9789690006943|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lahore's [[Moti Masjid (Lahore Fort)|Moti Masjid]] (Pearl Mosque) was converted into "Moti Mandir" (Pearl Temple) by the Sikh army,&lt;ref name=amin95/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Latif|first1=Syad Muhammad|title=Lahore: Its History, Architectural Remains and Antiquities|year=1892|publisher=Printed at the New Imperial Press|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sunehri Masjid, Lahore|Sonehri Mosque]] were converted into a Sikh [[Gurdwara]], but upon the request of Sufi Fakirs, Ranjit Singh restored the latter back to a mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Latif|first1=Syad Muhammad|title=Lahore: Its History, Architectural Remains and Antiquities|year=1892|publisher=Printed at the New Imperial Press|pages=221–223, 339}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lahore's [[Mosque of Mariyam Zamani Begum|Begum Shahi Mosque]] was also used as a gunpowder factory, earning it the [[nickname]] ''Barudkhana Wali Masjid'', or "Gunpowder Mosque."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Maryam Zamani Mosque|journal=Journal of Central Asia|year=1996|volume=19|publisher=Centre for the Study of the Civilizations of Central Asia, Quaid-i-Azam University|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singh's sovereignty was accepted by Afghan and Punjabi Muslims, who fought under his banner against the Afghan forces of Nadir Shah and later of Azim Khan. His court was ecumenical in composition: his prime minister, Dhian Singh, was a Dogra; his foreign minister, Fakir Azizuddin, was a Muslim; and his finance minister, Dina Nath, was a Brahmin. Artillery commanders such as Mian Ghausa were also Muslims. There were no forced conversions in his time. His wives Bibi Mohran, Gilbahar Begum retained their faith and so did his Hindu wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Khushwant|title=A History of the Sikhs: 1469–1838|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MD9uAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=1 April 2011|edition=2nd|date=11 October 2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-567308-1|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Khalsa army of Ranjit Singh reflected regional population, and as he grew his army, he dramatically increased the Rajput and Jat Sikhs who became the predominant members of his army.&lt;ref name=tejasingh65/&gt; In the Doaba region his army was composed of the Jat Sikhs, in Jammu and northern Indian hills it was Hindu Rajputs, while relatively more Muslims served his army in the Jhelum river area closer to Afghanistan than other major Panjab rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Teja Singh|author2=Sita Ram Kohli|title=Maharaja Ranjit Singh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YrG_aJTgnw0C |year=1986|publisher=Atlantic Publishers|pages=83–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reforms====
Ranjit Singh changed and improved the training and organisation of his army. He reorganised responsibility and set performance standards in logistical efficiency in troop deployment, [[Maneuver warfare|manoeuvre]], and [[marksmanship]].&lt;ref name=Singh /&gt; He reformed the staffing to emphasise steady fire over cavalry and guerrilla warfare, improved the equipment and methods of war. The military system of Ranjit Singh combined the best of both old and new ideas. He strengthened the infantry and the artillery.&lt;ref name=tejasingh65&gt;{{cite book|author1=Teja Singh|author2=Sita Ram Kohli|title=Maharaja Ranjit Singh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YrG_aJTgnw0C |year=1986|publisher=Atlantic Publishers|pages=65–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; He paid the members of the standing army from treasury, instead of the Mughal method of paying an army with local feudal levies.&lt;ref name=tejasingh65/&gt;

While Ranjit Singh introduced reforms in terms of training and equipment of his military, he failed to reform the old ''Jagirs'' (''Ijra'') system of Mughal middlemen.&lt;ref name=sunitsingh64/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brittlebank2008p65"/&gt; The ''Jagirs'' system of state revenue collection involved certain individuals with political connections or inheritance promising a tribute (''nazarana'') to the ruler and thereby gaining administrative control over certain villages, with the right to force collect customs, excise and land tax at inconsistent and subjective rates from the peasants and merchants; they would keep a part of collected revenue and deliver the promised tribute value to the state.&lt;ref name=sunitsingh64/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grewal1998p115"&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

According to historical records, states Sunit Singh, Ranjit Singh's reforms focused on military that would allow new conquests, but not towards taxation system to end abuse, nor about introducing uniform laws in his state or improving internal trade and empowering the peasants and merchants.&lt;ref name=sunitsingh64&gt;{{cite book|author=Sunit Singh|editor=Pashaura Singh and Louis E.

====Infrastructure investments====
Ranjit Singh ensured that Panjab manufactured and was self-sufficient in all weapons, equipment and munitions his army needed.&lt;ref name=kaushikroyp143/&gt; His government invested in infrastructure in the 1800s and thereafter, established raw materials mines, cannon foundries, gunpowder and arm factories.&lt;ref name=kaushikroyp143/&gt; Some of these operations were owned by the state, others operated by private Sikh operatives.&lt;ref name=kaushikroyp143/&gt;

However, Ranjit Singh did not make major investments in other infrastructure such as irrigation canals to improve the productivity of land and roads. The prosperity in his Empire, in contrast to the Mughal-Sikh wars era, largely came from the improvement in the security situation, reduction in violence, reopened trade routes and greater freedom to conduct commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sunit Singh|editor=Pashaura Singh and Louis E. Fenech|title=The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7YwNAwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-100411-7 |pages=62–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muslim accounts===
The mid 19th-century Muslim historians, such as Shahamat Ali who experienced the Sikh Empire first hand, presented a different view on Ranjit Singh's Empire and governance.&lt;ref name=bayly1996p233/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chitralekha Zutshi|title=Languages of Belonging: Islam, Regional Identity, and the Making of Kashmir |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rEluAAAAMAAJ |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-521939-5 |pages=39–41 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ali, Ranjit Singh's government was despotic, and he was a mean monarch in contrast to the Mughals.&lt;ref name=bayly1996p233&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Alan Bayly|title=Empire and Information: Intelligence Gathering and Social Communication in India, 1780–1870|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8bqEzPPp8xIC |year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-66360-1 |pages=233 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial momentum for the Empire building in these accounts is stated to be Ranjit Singh led Khalsa army's "insatiable appetite for plunder", their desire for "fresh cities to pillage", and entirely eliminating the Mughal era "revenue intercepting intermediaries between the peasant-cultivator and the treasury".&lt;ref name="Low1991p263"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clive Dewey | editor=D. A. Low|title=Political Inheritance of Pakistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VaeuCwAAQBAJ |year=1991|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-349-11556-3 |pages=263–265 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ishtiaq Ahmed, Ranjit Singh's rule led to further persecution of Muslims in Kashmir, expanding the previously selective persecution of Shia Muslims and Hindus by Afghan Sunni Muslim rulers between 1752 and 1819 before Kashmir became part of his Sikh Empire.&lt;ref name=iahmed1998&gt;{{cite book|author=Ishtiaq Ahmed|title=State, Nation and Ethnicity in Contemporary South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=czSm7cmhgA0C&amp;pg=PA140 |year=1998|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-85567-578-0 |pages=139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bikramjit Hasrat describes Ranjit Singh as a "benevolent despot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bikramajit Hasrat|title=Life and Times of Ranjit Singh: A Saga of Benevolent Despotism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UPgdAAAAMAAJ|year=1977|oclc= 6303625 | publisher=V.V. Research Institute|pages=83, 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Muslim accounts of Ranjit Singh's rule were questioned by Sikh historians of the same era. For example, Ratan Singh Bhangu in 1841 wrote that these accounts were not accurate, and according to Anne Murphy, he remarked, "when would a Musalman praise the Sikhs?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Murphy|title=The Materiality of the Past: History and Representation in Sikh Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r13hjYfoI6MC |year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-991629-0 |pages=121–126 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the colonial era British military officer Hugh Pearse in 1898 criticised Ranjit Singh's rule, as one founded on "violence, treachery and blood".&lt;ref name="Alexander Gardner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Alexander|title=Memoirs of Alexander Gardner&amp;nbsp;– Colonel of Artillery in the Service of Maharaja Ranjit Singh|year= 1898| url=https://archive.org/stream/soldiertraveller00gardiala#page/210/mode/2up |publisher=William Blackwood &amp; Sons| pages=211|chapter=Chapter XII}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sohan Seetal disagrees with this account and states that Ranjit Singh had encouraged his army to respond with a "[[tit for tat]]" against the enemy, violence for violence, blood for blood, plunder for plunder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sohan Singh Seetal|title=Rise of the Sikh Power and Maharaja Ranjeet Singh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TzRuAAAAMAAJ |year=1971|oclc=6917931| publisher=Dhanpat Rai|page=56}} (note: the original book has 667 pages; the open access version of the same book released by Lahore Publishers on archive.com has deleted about 500 pages of this book; see the original)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline===
Singh made his empire and the Sikhs a strong political force, for which he is deeply admired and revered in Sikhism. However, his era also marked a general decline in religious and moral fervour towards a life of alcoholism and licentiousness, along with a demoralisation of the Sikh court and nobility. He failed to establish a lasting structure for Sikh government or stable succession, and the Sikh Empire rapidly declined after his death. The British subsequently easily defeated the confused and demoralised Khalsa forces, then disbanded them into destitution.&lt;ref name="Oberoi1994p207"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harjot Oberoi|title=The Construction of Religious Boundaries: Culture, Identity, and Diversity in the Sikh Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dKl84EYFkTsC |year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-61593-6 |pages=207–208 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhism itself did not decline.&lt;ref name="Oberoi1994p208"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harjot Oberoi|title=The Construction of Religious Boundaries: Culture, Identity, and Diversity in the Sikh Tradition| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dKl84EYFkTsC |year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-61593-6 |pages=208–216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clive Dewey has argued that the decline of the empire after Singh's death owes much to the [[jagir]]-based economic and taxation system which he inherited from the Mughals and retained. After his death, a fight to control the tax spoils emerged, leading to a power struggle among the nobles and his family from different wives. This struggle ended with a rapid series of palace coups and assassinations of his descendants, and eventually the annexation of the Sikh Empire by the British.&lt;ref name="Low1991p263"/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Maharaja Ranjit singh's treasure.jpg|thumb|A [[lithography|lithograph]] by [[Emily Eden]] showing one of the favourite horses of Maharaja Ranjit Singh and his collection of jewels, including the [[Koh-i-Noor]]]]

Singh is remembered for uniting Sikhs and founding the prosperous Sikh Empire. He is also remembered for his conquests and building a well-trained, self-sufficient Khalsa army to protect the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Heath|title=The Sikh Army 1799–1849|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bT8UvgAACAAJ|year= 2005|publisher= Bloomsbury |isbn= 978-1-84176-777-2|pages= 5–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He amassed considerable wealth, including gaining the possession of the [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond from [[Shuja Shah Durrani]] of Afghanistan, which he left to [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple]] in [[Puri]], [[Odisha]] in 1839.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Real Ranjit Singh''; by Fakir Syed Waheeduddin, published by Punjabi University, {{ISBN|81-7380-778-7}}, 1 January 2001, 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Isabel Burton|title=Arabia, Egypt, India: A Narrative of Travel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=egyyNGelXQcC |year= 2012|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn= 978-1-108-04642-8|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gurdwaras===
Perhaps Singh's most lasting legacy was the restoration and expansion of the Harmandir Sahib, the most revered Gurudwara of the Sikhs, which is now known popularly as the "Golden Temple".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eleanor Nesbitt|title=Sikhism: A Very Short Introduction|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XebnCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64 |year= 2016|publisher= Oxford University Press|isbn= 978-0-19-874557-0|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the present decoration at the Harmandir Sahib, in the form of gilding and marblework, was introduced under the patronage of Singh, who also sponsored protective walls and water supply system to strengthen security and operations related to the temple.&lt;ref name=lafontp95&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Marie Lafont|title=Maharaja Ranjit Singh: Lord of the Five Rivers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zjduAAAAMAAJ |year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-566111-8 |pages=95–96 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also directed construction of two of the most sacred Sikh temples, being the birthplace and place of assassination of Guru Gobind Singh - [[Takht Sri Patna Sahib]] and [[Takht Sri Hazur Sahib]], respectively - whom he much admired.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Memorials and museums===
*[[Samadhi of Ranjit Singh]] in [[Lahore]], Pakistan, marks the place where Singh was cremated, and four of his queens and seven concubines committed sati.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sunday-special/kaleidoscope/-sati-choice-before-maharaja-ranjit-s-ranis/99411.html   ‘Sati’ choice before Maharaja Ranjit’s Ranis, The Tribune, Jun 28, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikhmuseum.com/nishan/empire/architecture.html#arch5  The Sikh Empire - Places &amp; Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Children]] usually acquire the religious views of their [[parent]]s, although they may also be influenced by others they communicate with such as peers and teachers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Aspects of this subject include [[rites of passage]], [[education]] and [[child psychology]], as well as discussion of the [[morality|moral]] issue of religious education of children.

==Rites of passage==
[[Image:InfantBaptism.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Roman Catholic]] infant baptism in the United States.]]
{{Main|Rite of passage}}
Most [[Christian]] churches practice [[infant baptism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html Major Branches of Religions Ranked by Number of Adherents]&lt;/ref&gt; to enter children into the faith. Some form of [[confirmation]] ritual occurs when the child has reached the [[Age of reason (canon law)|age of reason]] and voluntarily accepts the religion.

Ritual [[circumcision]] is used to mark Jewish and Muslim and [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christian]]&lt;ref name=riggs_2006&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomas Riggs |title=Worldmark Encyclopedia of Religious Practices: Religions and denominations |chapter=Christianity: Coptic Christianity |year=2006 |publisher=Thomson Gale |isbn=978-0-7876-6612-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uTMOAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox Christian]]&lt;ref name=Columbia_encyc_2011_circ&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2011 |title=Circumcision |encyclopedia=Columbia Encyclopedia |publisher=Columbia University Press |url=http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/science/circumcision.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; infant males as belonging to the faith. Jewish boys and girls then confirm their belonging at a [[coming of age]] ceremony known as the [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]] respectively.

==Education==

===Religious education===
A [[parochial school]] (US) or [[faith school]] (UK), is a type of school which engages in [[religious education]] in addition to conventional education. Parochial schools may be primary or secondary, and may have state funding but varying amounts of control by a religious organization. In addition there are [[religious school]]s which only teach the religion and subsidiary subjects (such as the language of the holy books), typically run on a part-time basis separate from normal schooling.  Examples are the Christian [[Sunday school]]s and the Jewish [[Hebrew school]]s. Islamic religious schools are known in English by the Arabic [[loanword]] [[Madrasah]].

===Prayer in school===

Religion may have an influence on what goes on in state schools. For example, in the UK the [[Education Act 1944]] introduced the requirement for daily prayers in all state-funded schools, but later acts changed this requirement to a daily "collective act of worship", the [[School Standards and Framework Act 1998]] being the most recent. This also requires such acts of worship to be "wholly or mainly of a broadly Christian character".&lt;ref name=CollectiveGuide&gt;[http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/teachingandlearning/subjects/re/worship/ www.teachernet.gov.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104032112/http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/teachingandlearning/subjects/re/worship/ |date=2010-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "mainly" means that acts related to other faiths can be carried out providing the majority are Christian.&lt;ref name=CatholicEducation&gt;[http://www.cesew.org.uk/standard.asp?id=4464 Catholic Education Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716190911/http://www.cesew.org.uk/standard.asp?id=4464 |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching evolution===
{{Main|Creation and evolution in public education}}
The [[creation-evolution controversy]], especially the status of [[creation and evolution in public education]], is a debate over teaching children the [[origin of life|origin]] and [[evolution]] of life, mostly in conservative regions of the [[United States]]. However, [[Theistic Evolution#Roman Catholic Church|evolution is accepted by the Catholic Church]] and is a part of the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|Catholic Catechism]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Religious indoctrination of children==
{{see also|Indoctrination|Criticism of religion#children|Child evangelism movement#Criticism}}

Many legal experts have argued that the government should create laws in the interests of the welfare of children, irrespective of the religion of their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/dwyer2/|title=Parents' Religion and Children's Welfare: Debunking the Doctrine of Parents' Rights|author=James G. Dwyer|work=CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW|volume=82|number=6|pages=1371–1447|date=December 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Humphrey]] has argued that children "have a human right not to have their minds crippled by exposure to other people's bad ideas," and should have the ability to question the religious views of their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edge.org/conversation/what-shall-we-tell-the-children|title=WHAT SHALL WE TELL THE CHILDREN?|date=21 Feb 1997|publisher=Edge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Parents' religion and children's welfare: debunking the doctrine of parents' rights,
Philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] spoke of the subject in the 19th century:
{{quote|"And as the capacity for believing is strongest in childhood, special care is taken to make sure of this tender age. This has much more to do with the doctrines of belief taking root than threats and reports of miracles. If, in early childhood, certain fundamental views and doctrines are paraded with unusual solemnity, and an air of the greatest earnestness never before visible in anything else; if, at the same time, the possibility of a doubt about them be completely passed over, or touched upon only to indicate that doubt is the first step to eternal perdition, the resulting impression will be so deep that, as a rule, that is, in almost every case, doubt about them will be almost as impossible as doubt about one's own existence."|Arthur Schopenhauer|''On Religion: A Dialogue''}}

Several authors have been critical of religious [[indoctrination]] of children, such as Nicolas Humphrey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Dawkins states that he is angered by the labels "Muslim child" or "Catholic child". He asks how a young child can be considered intellectually mature enough to have such independent views on the cosmos and humanity’s place within it. By contrast, Dawkins points out, no reasonable person would speak of a "[[Marxism|Marxist]] child" or a "[[Tory]] child."&lt;ref name="Richard Dawkins"/&gt; He suggests there is little controversy over such [[Labelling|labeling]] because of the "weirdly privileged status of religion".

On several occasions Dawkins made the claim that [[Child sexual abuse|sexually abusing a child]] is "arguably less" damaging than "the long term psychological damage inflicted by bringing up a child Catholic in the first place".&lt;ref name="Richard Dawkins" /&gt;

As a means to transmit his opinions directly to children Dawkins wrote a profusely illustrated book of scientific divulgation, [[The Magic of Reality]], in which some natural phenomena that's usually left explained to them by means of the action of gods or other mythical creatures are demystified. Each chapter book is devoted to a single natural phenomenon, such as earthquakes, always starting with a myth or folklore of world's major religions followed by an actual scientific explanation that debunks the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/10/06/the-magic-of-reality-richard-dawkins/ |title= The Magic of Reality: Richard Dawkins Teaches Children to Fight Myth with Science |last1= Popova |first1= Maria |date=6 October 2011 |website= Brain Pickings |publisher= |access-date= 19 February 2015|quote= Each chapter begins with a famous myth from one of the world’s religions or folklore traditions, which Dawkins proceeds to myth-bust by examining the actual scientific processes and phenomena that these stories try to explain. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health effects==
A study of 2604 US children ages six to nineteen found positive correlations between physical and psychological health and religious affiliation and/or church attendance.&lt;ref name=Chiswick&gt;[http://ftp.iza.org/dp5215.pdf Religion and Child Health] B. R. Chiswick &amp; D. M. Mirtcheva (2010) IZA, Bonn&lt;/ref&gt; This included 272 children whose parents (children 6&amp;ndash;9) or the children themselves (12&amp;ndash;19) expressed no religious affiliation.  However, of this group, 22% state that religion is important and 35% attend church.  The study found children ages six to nineteen who attend religious services are at lower risk of suicide or suicide attempts, as well as alcohol and drug use and dangerous sexual behavior. Some religions prohibit blood transfusions, vaccinations, contraception, and abortions, which may lead to adverse health consequences. Membership in religious groups can moderate unhealthy behavior, provide social support, and enhance marital or financial prospects, and strengthen family bonds if the religion is shared by the whole family. Religions can also help both adults and children with self-esteem, as well as provide meaning to life and reduce anxiety, but can increase guilt over perceived misdeeds. Thus it is not clear whether this positive association is because of a positive effect of religion on health, an effect in the other direction, or an as of yet unknown lurking variable.&lt;ref name=Chiswick/&gt;

85 percent of religiously affiliated children are healthy overall, as opposed to 79 percent of non-affiliated children.  79 percent of religious children are deemed psychologically healthy compared to 73 percent of non religious children.  85 percent of children who attend church at least weekly are healthy and 83 percent of those who seldom or never attend are healthy.  For psychological health the numbers are 82 and 74 percent respectively.&lt;ref name=Chiswick/&gt;

62 percent of children say religion is important to them, 26 percent say it's somewhat important, and 13 percent say it's not important.  81 percent of those who view religion as important were found to be healthy and 65 percent of the not important group were healthy.  There was no difference found among the various religious denominations in regard to health.  The positive correlation between religion and health was strongest for 12-15 year olds.  Overall religious belief and participation have the same positive health association as being breastfed or having a mother who went to school 2.2 years longer than one who didn't.  They have half the health benefit of living with both parents. Whether this association is a causal relationship in either direction (religion to good health or good health to religion) remains to be seen (see [[Correlation does not imply causation]]).&lt;ref name=Chiswick/&gt;

==Medical care==
[[Image:St. Francis Borgia Helping a Dying Impenitent by Goya.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Saint Francis Borgia]] performing an [[exorcism]], by [[Goya]]]]
{{See also|Exorcism|Faith healing}}
Some religions treat illness, both mental and physical, in a manner that does not heal, and in some cases exacerbates the problem. Specific examples include [[faith healing]] of certain Christian sects, the [[Christian Science]] religion which eschews medical care, and [[exorcisms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Exorcism by Rabbis: Talmud Sages and Their Magic| work =| publisher =Bar-Ilan University, Israel| date =| url =http://faculty.biu.ac.il/~barilm/exorcism.html| doi =| accessdate =| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071229075358/http://faculty.biu.ac.il/~barilm/exorcism.html| archivedate =2007-12-29| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Papademetriou |first=George C |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Exorcism in the Orthodox Church |work= |publisher= |date= |url=http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/articles/article7079.asp |doi= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924175937/http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/articles/article7079.asp |archivedate=September 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] [[Jehovah's Witnesses and blood transfusions|object to blood transfusion]] primarily on religious grounds, they believe that blood is sacred and God said "abstain from blood" (Acts 15:28-29).

==Religion as a by-product of children's attributes==
Dawkins proposes that religion is a by-product arising from other features of the human species that are adaptive.&lt;ref name=Dawkins&gt;{{cite book |author=Dawkins, Richard |title=[[The God Delusion]] |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=2006 |page=406 |isbn=0-618-68000-4 |authorlink = Richard Dawkins}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such feature is the tendency of children to "believe, without question, whatever your grown-ups tell you" (Dawkins, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;174).

Psychologist [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] sees religion as a by-product of children's instinctive tendency toward a [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualistic]] view of the world, and a predisposition towards [[creationism]].&lt;ref name=Dawkins /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bloom|first1=Paul|title=Is God an Accident?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/12/is-god-an-accident/304425/|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=15 May 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deborah Kelemen has also written that children are naturally [[teleology|teleologist]]s, assigning a purpose to everything they come across.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The documentary was produced by [[Thousand Words]] and distributed by [[Lions Gate Entertainment]].

==Reception==
===Box office===
''Religulous'' had an opening weekend take of $3.5 million from an early October 1 release in [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]] and also a limited 502-theater release, averaging $6,972 per theater. As a result, the film was ranked at #10 at the box office that weekend. Its per-screen receipts were almost three times those of a competing film to which it has been compared in the media, the politically conservative ''[[An American Carol]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=Michael|title=For the right wing, 'An American Carol'|work=[[Dallas Morning News]]|date=2008-10-03|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/stories/DN-carol_1003gl.ART.State.Edition1.2699bd1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004090449/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/stories/DN-carol_1003gl.ART.State.Edition1.2699bd1.html |archivedate=2008-10-04 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2014-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=STEVEN D.

===Critical response===
''Religulous'' received mixed to positive reviews. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 69%, based on 154 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''Religulous'' is funny and offensive in equal measure, and aims less to change hearts and minds than to inspire conversation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Religulous|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=IGN|year= 2008|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1188454-religulous/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080826020236/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1188454-religulous/ |archivedate=2008-08-26 |deadurl=yes|accessdate=2014-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 56 out of 100, based on 31 critics, "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Religulous - Lionsgate|work=[[Metacritic]]| publisher=CNET|year=2008|url= http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/religulous|accessdate=2008-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Film critic]] [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a rating of three and a half out of four stars, and wrote: "I report faithfully that I laughed frequently. You may very well hate it, but at least you've been informed. Perhaps you could enjoy the material about other religions, and tune out when yours is being discussed. That's only human nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|title=Religulous|work= [[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=rogerebert.com|date=2008-10-02|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081002/REVIEWS/810020306/1023|accessdate=2008-10-02}} {{rating|3.5|4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert W. Butler of ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' gave the film a rating of three stars, and commented: "The film is one-sided, less a measured argument than a bunch of rants and barbed observations. But it’s also very funny, which trumps everything else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Butler|first=Robert W.|title =‘Religulous’|work=[[The Kansas City Star]]|date=2008-10-02|url= http://www.kansascity.com/710/story/823717.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011154639/http://www.kansascity.com/710/story/823717.html |archivedate=2008-10-11 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2008-10-02}} {{rating|3|4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen Gleiberman of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a rating of A-, and wrote: "The movie is funny as...well, hell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gleiberman|first= Owen |title=Religulous (2008)|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=Entertainment Weekly and Time|date=2008-10-01|url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20230120,00.html|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Canadian Press]]'' said the movie "delivers a laugh-out-loud attack on the most sacred of cows."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5h0QMpdlNjZUUs4e82ei5xMMiRIsg |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004012123/http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5h0QMpdlNjZUUs4e82ei5xMMiRIsg |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2008-10-04 |title=Bill Maher travels the globe challenging religious belief in 'Religulous'|work=[[The Canadian Press]]|date=2008-09-20|accessdate=2014-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christie Lemire, of the [[Associated Press]], wrote: "If you're an atheist or an agnostic, you'll be completely on board and happy to tag along with Maher as he travels the globe asking people about their faith — everywhere from Jerusalem to the Vatican to Amsterdam, where he finds not only the Cannabis Ministry but also a Muslim gay bar (with two people in it)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Christie|last=Lemire|work=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|url= http://www.sltrib.com/ci_10592212|title=Maher preaches to choir with religion film|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|date=2008-09-29| accessdate=2008-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Anderson of ''[[Newsday]]'' wrote: "much that's funny, insightful and thought-provoking.

The documentary received some negative reviews, with [[Rick McGinnis]] of ''[[Metro International|Metro]]'' concluding that, "Maher is preaching to the choir with an undisguised dishonesty that only the true believers will forgive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metronews.ca/ottawa/Entertainment/article/121056 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208034707/http://www.metronews.ca/ottawa/Entertainment/article/121056 |archivedate=2008-12-08 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2014-11-24|date=2008-10-03|first=Rick|last=McGinnis|publisher=[[Metro International|Metro]]|title=Religulous (film review) }} {{rating|2|5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Berardinelli]] wrote, "If the subject of religion is as important to Maher as he claims during his end comments, then he should have followed those words with actions and made a movie that's more than a sum of inauthentic interviews, ranting attacks, and obvious observations.

In a review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Stephen Holden notes that when Maher "turns from evangelical Christianity to Judaism and Islam, its tone becomes uncertain and its rhythm choppy".&lt;ref&gt;Holden, Stephen (2008-10-01). [https://movies.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/movies/01reli.html?_r=0 "Believers, Skeptics and a Pool of Sitting Ducks"], New York Times.

In his review Stephen Holden also wrote that "the movie has the same loose, on-the-road structure" as Larry Charles' previous film ''[[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]]'' and commented: "Much of Mr. Maher’s film is extremely funny in a similarly irreverent, offhanded way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holden| first=Stephen|title=Believers, Skeptics and a Pool of Sitting Ducks|work =[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=2008-10-01|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/movies/01reli.html?ref=movies|accessdate=2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claudia Puig of ''[[USA Today]]'' wrote: "those with a taste for irreverent humor and clear-eyed analysis will find it funny, enlightening and disturbing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Puig|first=Claudia|title='Religulous' mirthfully heaps scorn on the faithful  | work=[[USA Today]]|date=2008-09-30|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2008-09-30-religulous_N.htm|accessdate= 2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirk Honeycutt of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' characterized the film as "An often hilarious but relentlessly shallow attack on religious fundamentalism by humorist Bill Maher".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Honeycutt|first=Kirk|title=Film Review: Religulous|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|date=2008-09-04|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film/reviews/article_display.jsp?&amp;rid=11607 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908150857/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film/reviews/article_display.jsp?&amp;rid=11607 |archivedate=2008-09-08 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2014-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louis Peitzman of the ''[[San Francisco Bay Guardian]]'' wrote that "It doesn't even matter that he goes out of his way to be offensive, as he's consistently funny enough to pull it off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peitzman|first=Louis|title=Film listings|work=[[San Francisco Bay Guardian]]|date=2008-09-30| url=http://www.sfbg.com/entry.php?entry_id=7190&amp;catid=85&amp;l=1|accessdate=2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Indrisek wrote at ''[[Style.com]]'' that: "''Religulous'' earns many of its laughs from skillful editing, with Maher's interviews jazzed up by video clips".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Indrisek |first=Scott |title=Maher's Believe It or Not |publisher=[[CondéNet]] |date=2008-09-30 |url=http://men.style.com/news/blog/2008/09/mahers-believe.html |accessdate=2008-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219225254/http://men.style.com/news/blog/2008/09/mahers-believe.html |archivedate=2008-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Kenigsberg of ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out New York]]'' gave the film a rating of three out of six stars, and wrote: "The worst scenes in ''Religulous'' are appalling for their methods; the best are appalling for their information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kenigsberg |first=Ben |title=Religulous (2008) |work=[[Time Out (company)|Time Out New York]] |publisher=Time Out Group |date=2008-10-02 |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/newyork/reviews/85833/religulous.html |accessdate=2008-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003131405/http://www.timeout.com/film/newyork/reviews/85833/religulous.html |archivedate=2008-10-03 |df= }} {{rating|3|6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sahajananda Saraswati''' (10 July 1925 &amp;ndash; 10 December 2007) was the spiritual head of the Divine Life Society of South Africa. He was born in the small midlands town of Estcourt, South Africa.

==Education==
Sahajananda did well in school, from primary through secondary and college, always gaining firsts. He was highly ambitious in the pursuit of his academic career, but [[Sivananda Saraswati]], founder of the Divine Life Society movement worldwide, had other plans in store for him and his intervention came at the appropriate time.

Sahajananda attempted to finish his PhD, but got only a second class pass as a result of doing poorly on the geometry portion of his final exams. He got a teacher's certificate instead.

==Beginning of his divinity career==
During his first year of teaching, he came across the Sivananda's book, ''Practice of Karma Yoga'', and took it up, giving up sports and ambition in his teaching career in exchange for pursuit of this religion. In 1948 he gave up his teaching post and went to India to meet Sivananda. He was not qualified to reside at the Ashram and returned to South Africa. Sivananda readily gave consent, adding, "The qualities will come". The only instruction Sahajananda received from Sivananda during this visit was: "learn to type and to make tea!" The youthful seeker accepted the advice passively. Only years later did Sahajananda understand that Sivananda's cryptic words were pregnant with deep spiritual meaning—it was dissemination of spiritual knowledge through his literature, and service of the underprivileged.

==Return to South Africa==
Returning to South Africa, Sahajananda took up a teaching post at the FOSA (Friends of Sick Association) TB Settlement, teaching in the school and serving the sick in the wards. It was during this time that Sivananda wrote to him with a request to start a branch of Divine Life Society in South Africa. Being nervous and shy by temperament, and unaccustomed to any kind of organisational work, Sahajananda felt quite incompetent to undertake the task, and did not respond to his letter. Sivananda wrote a second letter  dated 18 October 1949, requesting him to open a branch. Sahajananda was now in a fix, and thought that since he was a disciple, he should obey and forwarded the affiliation fee to register the branch. Sivananda was evidently impatient to get the branch opened, for before the affiliation fee could reach him, Sivananda sent a third letter, dated 11 November 1949, requesting a branch to be opened. Thus began the saga of Divine Life Society of South Africa.

Sahajananda commenced with publishing Sivananda's writings and disseminating the literature (funding it himself), as well as conducting prayer services. He worked as a teacher and print the literature in the evenings together with a few devotees. They worked long hours, sometimes working until the early hours of the morning. They led a hard life, sleeping on the bare cement floor with newspapers as mattresses. Bricks served as pillows. Sahajananda recounted, "It was not that I was practising some kind of austerity. It was just that I wished to offer every spare cent of my income to the promotion of my Master's Mission."

In 1956 Sahajananda visited Sivananda and Sivanananda initiated him into the holy Order of Sannyas. At his farewell function, Sivananda said: "Swami Sahajananda is styled as the spiritual king of South Africa, Durban. He is also called African Chota Guru. He does not want anything. He is a silent worker. He is a man of renunciation, Vairagya (dispassion) and meditation. He is a very good organiser. He talks little. You have never seen him talking. He thinks much and does much. Such a spiritual Yogi is he. His devotion to his teacher is unique. He has a pure heart. So let us pray for the health of this small Yogi, full of strength. One who can transform the materialistic intellect of the whole of South Africa—what tremendous purity, what tremendous Yogic power, what tremendous meditation, spiritual aura and selfless aura!"

Sahajananda returned to South Africa and served the spiritual and social needs of the country. His selflessness, love, kindness, high level of ethics, meticulousness, and strict discipline drew thousands to devotees to him. He wrote spiritual books.

For the underprivileged and disadvantaged of South Africa, Sahajananda has undertaken over 300 projects that include schools, hospitals, clinics, crèches, old age homes, children’s homes, technical colleges, hydroponic gardening tunnels, sewing centres, feeding schemes, peace and skills training centres, low-cost housing, and more. Many of the projects are in rural areas where access to such facilities are scarce. For this humanitarian work, Sahajananda received numerous local and international awards, including the Martin Luther King Jnr. Peace Award from the Centre for Non-violent Social Change in Atlanta, USA, and from statesmen including the South African President, Dr Jacob Zuma, past Premiers of the Province of KwaZulu Natal, Mayors of district and local municipalities, the King and Prince of the Zulu Nation, etc. In 2008, in recognising Sahajananda for his efforts of uplifting the people of South Africa, the University of KwaZulu Natal posthumously conferred upon Sahajananda the Honorary Degree, Doctor of Theology, ''honoris causa''.

Sahajananda brought the teachings of Sivananda to the people of South Africa and the world. Sahajananda did not preach these teachings, he lived them. His entire life was an example of kindness, love, obedience, dedication and devotion to God and the Guru. Sahajananda built numerous ashrams (Hindu prayer centres) and provided the facilities to take people towards God. Worth mentioning are the Divine Life Society's headquarters—Sivanandashram, Reservoir Hills, and the Sivananda International Cultural Centre (or SICC), Sivananda Nagar, La Mercy, KwaZulu Natal. SICC is probably one of the largest Hindu spiritual centres in the southern hemisphere. Everyone that visits the place comments on the peace and bliss experienced there. The comment invariably made is that the place is "heaven on earth".

Sahajananda had attracted around him a large congregation of devotees devoted to Sivananda. He never allowed himself to be worshipped and encouraged all to direct their devotion to Sivananda. He attributed all success of Divine Life society of South Africa to the Grace of Sivananda.

For over 50 years, Sahajananda worked in the service of Sivananda. But this did not stop him from performing his spiritual practises. Sahajananda spent long hours in silent meditation.

==Death==
Sahajananda died on 10 December 2007, after a short illness. News of his death spread to all corners of the world from Swamis, statesmen, devotees, etc. His body lay in state the day of the 10th and throughout the night, allowing people to pay their final respects to him. His final request was for his body to be cremated and his sacred ashes to be immersed in the holy waters of Mother Ganga.

Before his death, Sahajananda had trained persons in every facet of the Society's work, and put in place a Board of Management to manage the affairs of the Society, so that the Divine work he had begun would continue into the future.

'''St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cemetery''' is an [[Eastern Catholic]] [[cemetery]] in [[Bethel Park, Pennsylvania|Bethel Park]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]], a [[suburb]] approximately {{convert|5|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[downtown Pittsburgh]]. It is situated on a hillside in the southwest corner of the intersection of Connor Road and Pennsylvania State Route 88.

As an ethnic [[parish]] cemetery, it primarily serves members of [[St. John the Baptist]] [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church]] on Pittsburgh's [[South Side Flats|South Side]], as well as others of [[Rusyn American|Rusyn]] and [[Ukrainian American|Ukrainian]] [[kinship and descent|descent]] from the [[Byzantine Catholic Metropolitan Church of Pittsburgh]].

The cemetery was established in 1923 when the church bought a {{convert|20|acre|sing=on}} farm in a rural part of [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]]. Since then, suburban growth has spread to meet the graveyard. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania took part of the cemetery grounds to expand Connor Road, and the [[Port Authority of Allegheny County]] annexed more of its land for a trolley station. 

==Notable interments==
[[File:Warhol grave.jpg|left|thumb|The grave site and tombstone of Andy Warhol ]]
The cemetery is best known as the burial site of the American artist [[Andy Warhol]] and his parents. Warhol's fans make [[pilgrimage]]s to this cemetery and leave tokens including cans of soup on his grave stone to honor his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Ian Urbina; Sean D.

Caputo has been on the [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]] [[reality television|reality]] TV series, ''[[Long Island Medium]]'' since 2012.&lt;ref name=HuffPo-Feature-2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cook|first1=Michael|title="Long Island Medium" Theresa Caputo -- "You Can't Put A Price On What I Am Able To Give People"|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-cook/long-island-medium-theres_b_8851248.html|accessdate=3 January 2016|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also the author of two books and tours under "Theresa Caputo Live!

== Criticism ==
Caputo's claim of being a medium has been publicly challenged by multiple sources, ranging from television news programs such as ''[[Inside Edition]]''&lt;ref name="insideedition"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Long Island Medium&amp;nbsp;– Can She Really Communicate with the Dead?|url=http://www.insideedition.com/investigative/5331-the-long-island-medium-can-she-really-communicate-with-the-dead|accessdate=May 21, 2013|work=[[Inside Edition]]|date=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jezebel-dodai&gt;{{cite news|last=Stewart|first=Dodai|title=Super Sad and Misguided Emails Intended for the Long Island Medium|url=http://jezebel.com/5953012/super-sad-and-misguided-emails-intended-for-the-long-island-medium|accessdate=May 21, 2013|publisher=[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel.com]]|date=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to print publications such as ''[[Wired Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2012/04/opinion_randilimedium0409/ |title=The 'Medium' is not the messenger |magazine=[[Wired Magazine]] |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2013-05-19 |last=Randi |first=James |authorlink=James Randi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caputo was described by [[D. J. Grothe]] as a [[charlatan]],&lt;ref name="grothe"&gt;{{cite news |last=Grothe |first=DJ |authorlink=D. J.

In April 2012, the [[James Randi Educational Foundation]] awarded Caputo its [[Pigasus Award]], a tongue-in-cheek award that seeks to expose [[parapsychology|parapsychological]], [[paranormal]] or [[psychic]] frauds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAYG_cgqjWA |title=2012 Pigasus Awards Announcement|work=[[James Randi Educational Foundation]]|date=March 30, 2012|accessdate=March 27, 2014|format=YouTube video}}&lt;/ref&gt; The James Randi Education Foundation has been critical of Caputo's work.&lt;ref name=JamesRandi-TallStory-2012&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stollznow|first1=Dr. Karen|authorlink=Karen Stollznow|title=Long Island Medium: A Tall Story|url=http://archive.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/1755-long-island-medium-a-tall-story.html|work=[[James Randi Educational Foundation]]|accessdate=4 January 2016|date=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A newspaper review of Caputo's performances at the [[NYCB Theatre at Westbury]] in late 2017 concluded, "For me, this unbelievable experience was simply that: not to be believed. In my humble opinion, Caputo is a damn good performer, and she’s got undeniably likable sass and charisma. I just don’t think she speaks with the dead. Or she didn’t the night that I saw her.

Paranormal investigator [[Massimo Polidoro]] calls Caputo a "performer" and reports on an investigation done by ''[[Inside Edition]]'' and mentalist [[Mark Edward]] who attended one of her live shows in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Polidoro|first1=Massimo|authorlink=Massimo Polidoro|title=Theresa Caputo: The Fake Long Island Medium|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=June 2016|volume=40|issue=3|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, illusionist [[Criss Angel]] offered Caputo $1 million to prove her claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/criss-angel-on-his-new-show-believe-it-s-healthy-to-be-skeptical-1.6241144|title=Criss Angel on his new show, 'BeLIEve': 'It's healthy' to be skeptical|work=Newsday|location=New York City / Long Island|first=Frank|last=Lovece|authorlink=Frank Lovece|date=October 15, 2013|accessdate=December 7, 2017|quote="The Long Island Medium is just another charlatan.

'''Therion'''{{Pronunciation-needed}} ({{lang-el|θηρίον}}, beast) is a deity found in the mystical system of [[Thelema]], which was established in 1904 with [[Aleister Crowley]]'s writing of ''[[The Book of the Law]]''. Therion's female counterpart is [[Babalon]], another Thelemic deity. Therion, as a Thelemic personage, evolved from that of "[[The beast (Revelation)|The Beast]]" from the [[Book of Revelation]], whom Crowley identified himself with since childhood, because his mother called him that name.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Martin (2000). A Magick Life: The Biography of Aleister Crowley. London: Coronet Books. {{ISBN|978-0-340-71806-3}}; page 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutin, Lawrence (2000). Do What Thou Wilt: A Life of Aleister Crowley. New York: St Martin's Press. {{ISBN|978-0-312-25243-4}}; pages 18-21&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, throughout his life he occasionally referred to himself as “Master Therion” or sometimes “The Beast 666”. He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Before I touched my teens, I was already aware that I was THE BEAST whose number is 666. I did not understand in the least what that implied; it was a passionately ecstatic sense of identity.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. ''[http://hermetic.com/crowley/book-4/ Magick: Liber ABA, Book 4]''. Part III (''Magick in Theory and Practice''). ''Definition and Theorems of Magick''. York Beach, ME : S. Weiser. {{ISBN|0-87728-919-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The word "therion" is mentioned in several Thelemic rituals, such as ''The Star Ruby''. In total, there are five mentions of The Beast in ''Liber AL vel Legis'', the first being in 1:15, and the remaining four are all in the third chapter—verses 14, 22, 34, and 47, respectively—although the word “beast” can be found elsewhere therein. Aleister Crowley believed that the references to The Beast and the Scarlet Woman (Babalon) in the book “do not denote persons but are titles of office”.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. ''The Law is for All''. Commentary on III:15.&lt;/ref&gt; The first mention reads thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now ye shall know that the chosen priest &amp; apostle of infinite space is the prince-priest the Beast; and in his woman called the Scarlet Woman is all power given.&lt;ref&gt;''Liber AL vel Legis'' I:XV&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The Number of Therion and the numerology thereof==
The [[Number of the Beast]] is 666. The number is of prominent significance in the system of Thelema. It is the sum of the numbers inside the 6-by-6 [[magic square]], which is associated with the [[Sun (astrology)|sun]] by some [[Kabbalists]], [[astrologists]], and [[numerologists]], who still use it today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Drury |first=Nevill |authorlink=Nevill Drury |title=Dictionary of Mysticism and the Esoteric Traditions |year=1992 |location=Bridport, Dorset |publisher=Prism Press |isbn=1-85327-075-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Crowley, it is a solar number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Aleister|last=Crowley|authorlink=Aleister Crowley|title=777 and other Qabalistic writings of Aleister Crowley|publisher=[[Samuel Weiser]], 1977|location=York Beach, ME|isbn=0-87728-222-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu|Stele of Revealing]] bore the catalogue number 666 at the time when Crowley discovered it, which was one of the events that led to the writing of the Book of the Law.

It can be said that the Hebrew letter [[Shin (letter)|shin]] (ש), which is written at the beginning and end of the Hebrew word for "sun" (shemesh &lt;ref&gt;''A Concise Dictionary of the Words in the Hebrew Bible'', entry 8121, James Strong&lt;/ref&gt;), conceals in itself the number of The Beast, because its shape is like three [[waw (letter)|vavs]] (ו) conjoined together, whose gematrical value is 6. It has been noted by some that the abbreviation [[World Wide Web|W.W.W.]] may be interpreted as 666,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watkins|first1=Terry|title=Is "www" in Hebrew equal to 666?|url=http://www.av1611.org/666/www_666.html|website=Dial-the-Truth Ministries|accessdate=22 June 2015|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|reason=Hebrew word for 'sun' (shemesh)|date=June 2015}} for the Latin letter “W” formed out of the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] letter waw, whose value is 6. This can be explained by saying that the [[Information Age|rise of the internet]] is one of the events by which the beginning of the [[Age of Aquarius]] has been marked,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spencer|first1=Neil|title=True as the Stars Above: Adventures in Modern Astrology|date=2000|publisher=Victor Gollancz Limited|isbn=9780575067691|pages=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=June 2015}} which is strongly tied with the concept of the [[Aeon (Thelema)|Aeon of Horus]] in Thelema.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DuQ03|DuQuette 2003]]. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
The following words and phrases have 666 for their [[Gematria|gematrical]] value:
*Το Μεγα Θηριον — Greek for “The Great Beast”. Koine Greek is the Greek dialect by which the books of the [[New Testament]] were written, including the Book of Revelation, where the original mention of The Beast's number is recorded (13:17-18).
*תריון — ThRYWN; a Hebrew spelling of “θηριον” / “therion”, Greek for “beast”.
*שמש יהוה — ShMSh YHWH; shemesh Yahweh; Hebrew for “sun of Yahweh”. It is the value of the [[tetragrammaton]] (26; 10+5+6+5) added to the value of the Hebrew word for “sun” (640; 300+40+300).&lt;ref name="asis.com"&gt;http://asis.com/users/stag/itworks2.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*סורת — SWRTh; Sorath; the evil spirit of the sun.&lt;ref name=JewishKabbalah&gt;Admon, Bashemeth; Mordekai, Admon; Morg, Eli. ''Spells, Incantations and Sigils According to the Jewish Kabbalah''. 2005 edition. p.111.&lt;/ref&gt;
*נכיאל multiplied by 6 (111x6) — NKYAL; Nachiel; the intelligence of the sun.&lt;ref name=JewishKabbalah /&gt;
*נשימירון — NShYMYRWN; Nashimiron; the [[qliphoth]] of [[wikt:pisces|Pisces]].&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. ''Sepher Sephirot''. The gematria of 666.&lt;/ref&gt;
*פרי שלום — PRY ShLWM; priy shalom; Hebrew for “fruit of peace”.
*אליסטיר קרולי — ALYSTYR QRWLY; a Hebrew spelling of the name “[[Aleister Crowley]]”.
*השטן שב — HShTN ShB; HaSatan shab; Hebrew for “The Satan has returned”.&lt;ref name="asis.com"/&gt;

The '''timeline of religion''' is a [[Chronology|chronological]] [[Compendium|catalogue]] of important and noteworthy [[Religion|religious]] events in [[Prehistoric religion|pre-historic]] and [[History of religion|modern]] times. This article reaches into pre-historic times, as the bulk of the human religious experience pre-dates [[written history]]. Written history (the [[History of writing|age]] of [[Writing systems|formal writing]]) is only c.5000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/themes/writing/historic_writing.aspx|title=Historic writing|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lack of written records results in most of the knowledge of pre-historic religion being derived from [[archeology|archaeological records]] and other indirect sources, and from suppositions. Much pre-historic religion is subject to continued debate.

:All convincing evidence for Neanderthal burials ceased. Roughly coinciding with the time period of the [[Homo sapiens]]' introduction to [[Europe]] and decline of the Neanderthals,&lt;ref name="british_archaeology_early_burials"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/BA/ba66/feat1.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602060232/http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba66/feat1.shtml|archive-date=2 June 2007|title=When Burial Begins|first=Paul|last=Pettitt|magazine=British Archeology|date=August 2002|issue=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; individual skulls and/or long bones began appearing, heavily stained with red [[ochre]] and separately buried. This practice may be the origin of sacred relics.&lt;ref name="british_archaeology_early_burials" /&gt; The oldest discovered "[[Venus figurines]]" appeared in graves. Some were deliberately broken or repeatedly stabbed, possibly representing the murders of the men with whom they were buried,&lt;ref name="british_archaeology_early_burials" /&gt; or owing to some other unknown social dynamic.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

;25,000–21,000 BCE:Clear examples of burials are present in Iberia, Wales, and eastern Europe. These, too, incorporate the heavy use of red ochre. Additionally, various objects were included in the graves (e.g. periwinkle shells, [[weighted clothing]], dolls, possible drumsticks, mammoth ivory beads, fox teeth [[pendants]], panoply of ivory [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], "baton" antlers, flint blades etc.).&lt;ref name="british_archaeology_early_burials" /&gt;

;13,000–8,000 BCE:Noticeable burial activity resumed. Prior mortuary activity had either taken a less obvious form or contemporaries retained some of their burial knowledge in the absence of such activity. Dozens of men, women, and children were being buried in the same caves which were used for burials 10,000 years beforehand. All these graves are delineated by the cave walls and large limestone blocks. The burials share a number of characteristics (such as use of ochre, and shell and mammoth ivory jewellery) that go back thousands of years. Some burials were double, comprising an adult male with a juvenile male buried by his side. They were now beginning to take on the form of modern [[cemetery|cemeteries]]. Old burials were commonly re-dug and moved to make way for new ones, with the older bones often being gathered and [[Mass grave|cached]] together. Large stones may have acted as grave markers. Pairs of ochred antlers were sometimes mounted on poles within the cave; this is compared to the modern practice of leaving flowers at a grave.&lt;ref name="british_archaeology_early_burials" /&gt;

=== 10th Millennium to 1st century BCE ===
;9130–7370 BCE:This was the apparent period of use of [[Göbekli Tepe]], one of the oldest human-made sites of worship yet discovered; evidence of similar usage has also been found in another nearby site, [[Nevalı Çori]].&lt;ref&gt;"The World's First Temple", Archaeology magazine, Nov/Dec 2008 p 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[Buddhist]] [[cave]] group consist of 11 cave. Now, cave No 4 is taken over by [[Hindu]]s and converted into a temple of goddess [[Tulja Devi]].&lt;ref name=AHIR /&gt;

==Description==
The Tulja Lena caves lie in a hill about a mile and a half or two miles north-west from [[Junnar]], beyond the north end of Sivaneri hill. They are so named, because one of them has been appropriated by the modern [[Brahman]]s as a shrine of [[Tulja Devi]], a form of  [[Bhavani]], the consort of [[Shiva]] (see [[Tulja Bhavani Temple]]).&lt;ref name="Fergusson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fergusson|first1=James|last2=Burgess|first2=James|title=The cave temples of India|date=1880|publisher=London : Allen|url=https://archive.org/stream/cavetemplesofind00ferguoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The caves run along the face of the cliff nearly from south-east to north-west, facing about south-west, but all the façades have fallen away. They consist of a number of cells and two small [[vihara]]s, with a [[Chaitya]] cave of a form quite unique. It is circular in plan, 25 feet 6 inches across, with a [[Stupa|dagoba]] in the centre, 8 feet 2 inches in diameter, surrounded by twelve plain octagonal shafts 11 feet in height, supporting a dome over the dagoba. The surrounding aisle is roofed by a half arch rising from the wall to the upper side of an architrave 7 or 8 inches deep over the pillars. 
[[File:Tulja Caves from distant ( Pratik Butte Patil ).jpg|left|thumb|330x330px|Tulja Caves from a distance.]]
The dagoba is perfectly plain, but its capital has been hewn off to convert it into a huge [[linga]] of [[Shiva]], and even the dome is much hacked into, while some of the pillars have been notched and others broken.&lt;ref name="Fergusson" /&gt; 

In front of this cave and the one on each side of it is a platform built by the modern devotes of Tulja Devi.&lt;ref name="Fergusson" /&gt; 

Over the front of one of the cells to the north-east of this are left some Chaitya-window ornamentation, a larger one over where the door has been, the inner arch of which is filled with knotted ribbons etc..., similar to what is over the Chaitya-cave door at the [[Nasik caves]], while the front of the arch is carved with flowers.

'''Tzu Chi Singapore''', also the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation (Singapore) ({{zh|s=佛教慈济慈善事业基金会（新加坡）}}), is the [[Singapore]] branch of the [[Tzu Chi]] [[Buddhist]] organisation. The foundation was originally set up by Venerable [[Cheng Yen]] and based in [[Hualien, Taiwan]]. The present premises of the Singapore branch is located at Elias Road in [[Pasir Ris]], [[Singapore]].

'''Vadama''' ({{lang-ta|வடமா}}) meaning "Northerners" are a sub-sect of the [[Iyer]] community of [[Tamil Brahmin]]s. While some believe that their name is an indication of the fact that they were the most recent [[Brahmin]] migrants to the [[Sangam period|Tamil country]] others interpret the usage of the term "Vadama" as a reference to their strict adherence to the [[Sanskrit language]] and Vedic rituals which are of northerly origin . It may also be possible that Vadamas may be Brahmins whose origins lie in the Dravida region of northern [[Tamil Nadu]]. Like other Iyer communities, they follow the ''[[Advaita]]'' philosophy propounded by [[Adi Shankara]].  A significant proportion of the Vadama community adopted [[Vaishnavism]], and are thus believed to have given rise to the [[Vadagalai Iyengar]] community. The oldest historical references to Vadamas date from the first millennium AD. A large number of Vadamas migrated to [[Kerala]] during the [[medieval period]], so that Vadamas along with the [[Brahacharnam]] form the majority of the [[Kerala Iyer]] community. A section of the Vadama community also migrated north to the [[Telugu people|Telugu]] country and [[Maharashtra]] where they were known as "[[Dravid (Surname)|Dravidas]]".

Vadamas have a [[wikt:martial|martial]] tradition unlike most other Iyer communities. They are believed to have been the protectors of Brahmin villages or ''[[agraharams]]'' and served as administrators and advisors to [[Tamil people|Tamil]] and [[Telugu people|Telugu]] kings during the medieval and early modern period.

==Etymology of the term==
The term Vadama may have originated from the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] term 'Vadakku' meaning North, indicating the Northern origin of the Vadama Brahmins.&lt;ref&gt;"South Indian Studies", Harogadde Manappa Nayak, Balakrishnan Raja Gopal, T. V. Mahalingam, Geetha Book House, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; This claim is supported by the fact that, unlike other subsects of [[Iyers]], some Vadama pay oblations in their daily [[Sandhyavandanam]] to the river [[Narmada River|Narmada]] in Central India.&lt;ref&gt;"Journal of the Asiatic Society", India Asiatic Society, 1832&lt;/ref&gt; However, what is not certain is whether 'North' refers to northern Tamil Nadu/Southern Deccan, or regions farther north. Other scholars are of the opinion that rather than the superficial indication of a northern origin for the people, the term ''"vadama"'' would rather refer to proficiency in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Vedic]] ritual, generally associated with the north prior to the first millennium A. D.&lt;ref&gt;"Peasant state and society in medieval South India", [[Burton Stein]], Oxford University Press, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swami Sivananda"&gt;[http://www.dlshq.org/download/hinduismbk.htm#_VPID_74 All About Hinduism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sub-categories==

Vadamas are further sub-divided into five categories

*  Vadadesa Vadama (''Vadamas of the northern country'')&lt;ref name="castesandtribes_p334"&gt;[[#Castes and Tribes of Southern India|Castes and Tribes of Southern India]], Pg 334&lt;/ref&gt;
* Choladesa Vadama&lt;ref&gt;"Caste in Indian Politics", R.

* Sabhaiyar(''member of the conference (Sabha))''&lt;ref name="castesandtribes_p334" /&gt;

* Thummagunta Dravida.&lt;ref name="castesandtribes_p334" /&gt;

Intermarriage with other Iyer sects has been increasing in recent times, while earlier, most marriages were arranged only within the same subsect of Vadama. Such a degree of exclusion has become rather uncommon now. Exceptions did exist, such as the marriage of Kurratalwan's sons(Considered to be Vadama followers of Sri Vaishnavism), which took place outside the Vadama fold.&lt;ref name="iyengarvadamakuratalwan"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.srivaishnavan.com/tomcat/visnu.html |title=Srivaishnavism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2008-06-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220070950/http://www.srivaishnavan.com/tomcat/visnu.html |archive-date=2008-02-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Some historians hold that all Brahmins who migrated to the far-south during and after the age of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta Emperors]], came to be classified as Vadama.&lt;ref&gt;"History of Tamilnad", N. Subrahmanian, Koodal Publishers, Tamil Nadu, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

===First millennium A.D.===

There is  a  perception that some Kashmir-linked Vadama settled in [[Tirunelveli]] between 750 and 800 AD. An interesting fact corroborating this migration may be had from the treatise called ''[[Natyashastra]]'' written by Bharata Muni, held by some to have been from Kashmir and by others to be from the south, formed the basis of the dance-form [[Bharatanatyam]] which is particularly associated with Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref name="kashart"&gt;[http://www.ece.lsu.edu/kak/wonder.pdf Art and Culture in Ancient Kashmir&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Art Historians such as Vasundhara Filliozat claim that there are inscriptional evidences to prove the continuous migration of teachers from Kashmir to South.&lt;ref name="kashart" /&gt; Such scholars also state that some other South Indian Saivaite and Tantric traditions were also introduced by teachers from Kashmir.&lt;ref name="kashart" /&gt;

It appears that the Sabhaiyar group of the Vadama, were present in the [[Chola Empire]] in the 9th century, since the grant of the "entire village of Chirri[dai]yarru excluding the ''kani'' of Samgappadi-kilan was made to the temple of Mahadeva at Tirumalpperu as a tax-free ''devadana'' in the 21st year [892 A.D.] of the reign of [[Chola]] [[Aditya I]] and the administration of the charity was entrusted to the ''sabhaiyar'' of Puduppakkam in Purisanadu".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_22/part_1/introduction.html What Is India News Service&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second millennium===

====11th to the 14th century====

The [[Srivaishnava]] hold that their guru [[Ramanujacharya]], born in the first quarter of the 11th century,&lt;ref name="Sastri"/&gt; was a Vadama by birth.

====14th and 15th centuries====

Instability prevailed in Peninsular India in the aftermath of the defeat of the [[Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri|Yadava]]s of [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Deogiri]] and [[Kakatiya]]s of [[Warangal]] in the early 14th century by the [[Tughlaq]]s. In response to the Moslem irruptions the Kingdom of [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] was founded in 1336, and came to be locked in an existential struggle with the [[Bahmani]] Sultanate from 1347 to 1490, when the Moslem state broke up. This early period was marked by much strife, especially in the ''[[jihad]]s'' of [[Taj ud-Din Firuz Shah]] (1397–1422) and his brother [[Ahmad Shah I Wali]] (1422–1435), when thousands of Hindus, especially Brahmins, were enslaved and temples of the northern Deccan desecrated.&lt;ref name="Sastri"&gt;'A History of South India from Pre-historic Times to the Fall of Vijayanagar', [[K. A. Nilakanta Sastri]], Oxford University Press, New Delhi, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The oppression was also felt in the eastern peninsula as far as the [[Gajapati Kingdom]] where, for instance in 1478, [[Muhammad Shah III Lashkari]] (1463–1482) demolished the Great Temple of [[Kondavid]]u and was acclaimed as a ''[[Ghazw|ghazi]]'', for personally decapitating all the Brahmins.&lt;ref name="Sastri"/&gt; Such excesses induced Brahmins to seek refuge in the realms of Vijayanagar, where many were appointed ''[[karnam]]s'' ([[bailiffs]]) in preference to other castes, from the reign of [[Harihara I]] (1336–1357) onward.&lt;ref name="Sastri"/&gt;

====Early 16th century====

After the division of the [[Bahmani]] Sultanate in 1490, into the Sultanates of [[Adil Shahi|Bijapur]], [[Golconda]], [[Ahmadnagar]] and [[Berar Sultanate|Berar]], the armies of Vijayanagar were successful in fending of invasions and restricting the Sultanates to Central India, especially in the reign of [[Krishnadeva Raya]] (1509–1529), who also began the practice of appointing Brahmins commanders of strategically important forts.&lt;ref name="Sastri"/&gt;

====16th and 17th centuries====

Relative peace prevailed until the [[Battle of Talikota]], in 1565, when [[Rama Raya]] of Vijayanagar was killed and the capital city razed to the ground. The land, in addition to being plundered by the combined armies of the Sultanates, came to be oppressed by renegade ''[[polygar]]s'' and bandits whose rise commenced with the destruction of the central power.&lt;ref name="Sastri"/&gt; The [[Mughal Empire|Mogul]] invasion of Peninsular India and the depredations of the Deccan by the Mahrattas under [[Shivaji]] also began early in the 17th century.

A combination of these belligerent powers and the desolation they helped create appears to have made the relative peace offered in the far south of the country under the Hindu kings of [[Travancore]], [[Madurai Nayaks|Madurai]], [[Tanjore Nayaks|Tanjore]] and [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]], far more desirable and induced many Hindus to migrate there. A fact supporting this idea, we have from English chroniclers in the 17th century, who state that their procurement of goods along the Western [[Konkan|Concan]] and [[Kanara|Canara]] coasts, suffered severely after the Mogul invasions and the mass depopulation of the peninsula they caused.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;"A New Account of the East Indies", Captain Alexander Hamilton, published 1739, A. Bettesworth and C. Hitch, London&lt;/ref&gt; Another statement often encountered in their annals is that the economic growth of the factory at [[Fort St. George]], [[Madras]] was in a large measure attributable to the fact that many people chose to settle there to escape the chaotic conditions farther north.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt; When we consider, in conjunction with these two facts, Fort St. George's position as a newly established, well-fortified and growing settlement in Aurangzeb's time, and therefore a secure refuge, a mass exodus southwards seems to have occurred in the period in question.

The relatives and family members of [[C. P. Ramaswami Iyer]], a Vadadesa Vadama, believed that they were descended from  Brahmins of the [[Desh, Maharashtra|Desh]] region of [[Maharashtra]] and [[Madhya Pradesh]] who migrated to [[Chittoor]] district of [[Andhra Pradesh]] from where they migrated to the northern part of Tamil Nadu in the 16th century where they were granted the village of [[Chetpet]] by a local chieftain.&lt;ref name="cpp7"&gt;[[#Sir C. P. Remembered|Sir C. P. Remembered]], Pg 7&lt;/ref&gt;

====17th century to the present====

During the 19th century, the Vadamas along with other [[Tamil Brahmins]] made ample use of the opportunities provided by British rule to dominate the civil services, legislature and the judiciary in the [[Madras Presidency]]. Throughout the second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century there was intense political rivalry between the Vadamas and the Brahacharanams for the domination of Brahmin villages called ''agraharams''.&lt;ref name="classp89"&gt;{{cite book|title=Caste and class: dynamics of inequality in Indian society |author=R. Jayaraman|pages=89|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communities related to the Vadamas==
{{Further|Aaraama Dravidulu}}

===Iyengar communities===

The Vaishnavite spiritual leader [[Ramanuja]] is generally believed to have been born a Vadama. Under his tutelage, numerous Vadamas adopted Vaishnavism and are believed to have given rise to the Vadakalai Iyengar community.&lt;ref name="castesandtribes_p334" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tamilbrahminp176"&gt;{{cite book|title=The brahmin in the Tamil country|pages=176|author=N. Subrahmanian|publisher=Ennes Publications|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goughp28"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rural Society in Southeast India|publisher=Cambridge University Press|author=Kathleen Gough|authorlink=Kathleen Gough|year=1981|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="castesandtribes_p348"&gt;[[#Castes and Tribes of Southern India|Castes and Tribes of Southern India]], Pg 348&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="castesandtribes_p349"&gt;[[#Castes and Tribes of Southern India|Castes and Tribes of Southern India]], Pg 349&lt;/ref&gt; The  transformation of the Vadama Ramanuja into a Sri Vaishnava, which happened concurrently with his education and increasing philosophic investigation, gave rise to a Tamil proverb - ''"Vadamam muthi Vaishnavam"'', ''i.e.'' a "Vadama ripens into a Vaishnava".&lt;ref name="castesandtribes_p334" /&gt; [[Edgar Thurston]] recounts at the beginning of the 20th century, the widespread prevalence of inter-marriage between Vaishnavite converts from the Thummagunta Dravida sub-group and Smartha girls from the same sub-sect.&lt;ref name="castesandtribes_p349" /&gt; Thurston also recounts that Vadamas often observed death pollution in some Vaishnavite families and vice versa.&lt;ref name="castesandtribes_p334" /&gt;&lt;ref name="castesandtribes_p349" /&gt;

===Gurukkal Brahmins===

Some of the [[Gurukkal Brahmins|Gurukkal]] in temples in Tamil Nadu, are Vadama, though not recognised as such by the community, since they have certain practices that are prohibited for the Vadama.&lt;ref name="Swami Sivananda"/&gt;

There is also evidence that some South Indian Brahmins settled in Kashmir. The actual sect of their origin is not known.&lt;ref name="kasdravids"&gt;http://vitasta.org/2001/1.6.html This website references [[Kalhana]]'s [[Rajatarangini]] which says that some Dravid Brahmins were settled at Sempora when Raja [[Jaya Simha]] (1128-1149) ruled over Kashmir&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aarama Dravidulu===

There is a perception that the ancestors of some Aarama Dravidulu Brahmins of [[Andhra Pradesh]] migrated in the 13th and 14th centuries, from [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] to the banks of the River [[Cauvery]] in [[Tamil Nadu]], whence some of them migrated to Andhra Pradesh, by all accounts before the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vepachedu.org/manasanskriti/aaraamadraavida.html  This reference quotes "Aaraamadraavida Vamsacharitra," written (1935) by Anantapadmanaabham Dvivedula (1888-1947), published by Venkataramarao Dvivedula, Samkhavaram, Andhra Pradesh - 533446.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional occupation==

[[File:VadamaIyerpriestsintamilnadu.jpg|Vadama Temple Priests in Tamil Nadu|thumb|right]]
They are held to have been the land-lords and head-men of the Brahmin villages called ''[[agraharams]]''.&lt;ref name="Journal"&gt;"Journal of the Andhra Historical Society", Andhra Historical Research Society, Rajahmundry, Madras Presidency, 1929&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sociologist]] [[Andre Beteille]], in his thesis ''Caste, class, and power: changing patterns of stratification in a Tanjore village'', describes them as the biggest ''mirasidars'' among the Iyer community. They may also have organised the agraharams' defence in turbulent times&lt;ref name="Journal"/&gt; for though there were not many who joined the army, they were not specifically forbidden to take to arms.&lt;ref name="historyoftamilnadp334"&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Tamilnad: to A.D. 1565
|author=N. Subrahmanian|pages=334|publisher=Koodal Publishers|year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proverb still prevalent amongst the Iyers indicating the supposed short-temper of Vadama Brahmins, may be indicative of their martial past.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}  They were among the Brahmin nobles and administrators under the Nayaka, Travancore and Vijayanagar rulers. Administrative practices adopted by them were strictly in accordance with those prescribed in the Hindu Dharma-Shastras, as may be observed from the records of the kings themselves.

But, as with other Brahmins, their primary duties were to study the Vedas, teach them and perform the ceremonies they entailed. The vast majority of them, until the 19th century, were household priests with some even being temple-priests, particularly in Travancore.

Many were great scholars and served in the courts of kings. Nilakanta Dikshitar was a minister to Thirumalai Nayak of Madurai.&lt;ref name="indianreviewp186"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Modern review, Volume 62|pages=186|author=Ramananda Chatterjee|publisher=Prabasi Press Pvt. Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, as with other [[Iyers]], many of the Vadama joined, the judiciary of [[British India]] as lawyers and judges, or served in the [[Indian Civil Service|Indian Civil]] and [[Indian Revenue Service|Revenue Services]]. Many others continued in the service of the kings of the princely states of [[Travancore]], [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]], [[Pudukottai]], and [[Ramanathapuram|Ramnad]].&lt;ref&gt;"From Landlords to Software Engineers: Migration and Urbanization among
Tamil Brahmans", C. J. Fuller and Haripriya Narasimhan, London School of Economics and Political Science, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious practices==
{{double image|left|Gopichandanam1.jpg|100|Gopichandanam2.jpg|100|The crescent or U-mark applied with the Gopichandanam is mostly used as [[caste mark]] by the Vadamas}}

While the religious rituals of the Vadama are, in almost all respects, identical with those of other [[Iyers]], there are a few minor deviations from them. One of these lies in the practice of some men applying ''Gopi Chandanam'', an yellow pigment of mineral origin similar in appearance to that obtained from sandalwood, on the forehead, instead of ''[[Vibhuti|Vibhuthi]]''. However, others like [[Appayya Dikshitar]]'s family applied only Vibhuti, being staunch devotees of [[Shiva]]. While it was more common in former times, the use of Gopi Chandanam continues, being replaced by Vibhuthi otherwise. Some Vadamas also sported the Vaishnavite ''namam''. They were known as ''kutthunamakarar''.

The Vadama traditionally claim to be superior to other classes of Iyers.&lt;ref&gt;"Tanjore District Handbook", Madras Record Office, Madras, India, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; One ritualistic difference from other Iyers, arises in their having to recite the following verse in honour of the River [[Narmada River|Narmada]], and to ward of serpents, as part of their [[Sandhyavandanam]]:

:''Narmadayai namah pratah Narmadayai namo nisi''

[[File:Synagoga vinohrady zmanim 1916.png|thumb|Zmanim of [[Vinohrady (Prague)|Vinohrady]] synagogue in [[Bohemia]] from 1916 ''[[Prager Tagblatt]]'' newspaper.]]
'''Zmanim''' ({{lang-he-n|זְמַנִּים}}, literally "times", singular ''zman'') are specific times of the day in [[Jewish law]].

*In Jewish law, a [[Hebrew calendar#Day|calendar day]] is defined as running from "evening" to "evening."  This is based on the repetition of the phrase "... and there was evening, and there was morning ..."—evening preceding morning—in the [[Genesis creation narrative|account of creation in Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|1:5|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Gen|1:8|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Gen|1:13|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Gen|1:19|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Gen|1:23|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Gen|1:31|HE}} and {{bibleverse||Gen|2.2|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Additionally, Jewish law requires certain activities to be undertaken "during the day"—or at a certain time during the day—while other activities are to be undertaken "at night"—or at a certain time during the night.  
For either purpose, the status of the [[twilight]] hours just after [[sunset]] or just before [[sunrise]] is ambiguous. Judaism provides its own definitions for this period; at the same time, various rabbinic authorities differ on just how those definitions are to be applied for different purposes.

==Calculations==

===General approach===
The [[Talmud]] often states calculations of these ''zmanim'' in terms of the time it takes to walk some distance, stated in ''[[Biblical mile|mils]]''.  Most authorities reckon the time it takes to walk one ''mil'' as being 18 minutes, though there are opinions of up to 24 minutes.&lt;ref name="ZmanSource"&gt;{{cite web|title=MyZmanim Sources|url=http://www.myzmanim.com/messagebox.aspx?messageid=sources|publisher=MyZmanim.com|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many authorities, indeed, hold such calculations to be absolute:  if nightfall follows sundown by "the amount of time it takes to walk four ''mils''," for example, that means "72 minutes after sundown" in all places on all dates.  Other authorities, especially those living in higher latitudes,&lt;ref name="ZmanDeg"/&gt; noted that the darkness of the sky 72 minutes after sundown (for example) can vary substantially from place to place, and from date to date.  They therefore hold that "72 minutes after sundown" actually refers to how dark the sky is 72 minutes after sundown ''in Jerusalem on an equinox''.  Then that degree of darkness is reckoned as being true when the sun has fallen a certain number of degrees below the horizon (for example, 7°5′ below the horizon), and that becomes the actual standard used for all places and all dates.&lt;ref name="ZmanDeg"&gt;{{cite web|title=Computation by Degrees Explained|url=http://www.myzmanim.com/messagebox.aspx?messageid=degreesexplained|publisher=MyZmanim.com|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evening===
One calendar day ends, and the next day begins, during the evening. The Talmud states there is an uncertainty as to whether the day ends at sunset or nightfall, so the time in between has a status of doubt. The Talmud in [[Pesachim]]&lt;ref name="Pes94a"&gt;Babylonian Talmud, Pesachim 94a)&lt;/ref&gt; states there are four ''[[Biblical mile|mil]]'' between sunset and nightfall. However, the Talmud in [[Tractate Shabbat]] states that there are just three-quarters of a ''mil'' between sunset and nightfall. 
*The ''[[Geonim]]'' and the [[Vilna Gaon|Vilna Gaon (GR"A)]] explain that the second statement is correct. 
*[[Rabbeinu Tam]] and many other [[Rishonim]] say rather that there are two "sunsets," the first of which [actual sunset] is four ''mil'' before nightfall, and the second of which is just three-quarters of a ''mil'' before.&lt;ref name="Zmanim Terms"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zmanim Terms|url=http://kehillatisrael.net/hcal/zmanim.html|publisher=Kehillat Israel|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to the first opinion, nightfall is 13½-18 minutes after sundown (or its equivalent, sun falls 3-4° below the horizon).  According to the second opinion, nightfall occurs exactly 72 minutes after sundown (or its equivalent, when the sun has fallen anywhere from 6.45 to 16.1 degrees below the horizon).&lt;ref name="ZmanSource"/&gt;

In practice, when the question is whether it is too late to do a something that must be done ''by day,'' the practice is to follow one of the earlier opinions. When the question is whether it is too early to do something that must be done ''by night,'' the practice is to follow one of the later opinions.  For calculating the end of [[Shabbat]] or major holidays, the desire not to end Shabbat early, along with the Talmud's description of the end of Shabbat in terms of the appearance of stars in the sky, leads to the use of the later opinions.  (See [[#End of Shabbat|End of Shabbat]] below.)

===Morning===
There is also a difference of opinion as to when one may begin to do activities than must be done ''during the day:''  
*Daybreak, when some light is visible, or
*Sunrise, when the ball of the sun rises above the horizon.
The Talmud in Pesachim (see above)&lt;ref name="Pes94a"/&gt; holds symmetrically that the time between daybreak and sunrise is also the time in which one can walk four ''mils.''  For morning calculations, daybreak is normally held to be when the sun is 16.1° below the horizon, or a fixed 72 minutes or 90 minutes&lt;ref&gt;Based on a 22½ minute ''mil''&lt;/ref&gt; before sunrise.&lt;ref name="ZmanDeg"/&gt;

:A little after daybreak is a time known as ''misheyakir'', "when one can recognize [another person four cubits away]." This calculation is used as the earliest time to wear ''[[tzitzit]],'' and in parallel, [[tefillin]], because this is when the blue thread of the ''tzitzit'' can be distinguished from the white threads.  ''Misheyakir'' is always calculated relative to season and place, and occurs when the sun is either 10.2-11.5 degrees below the horizon.

===Seasonal hours===
{{main article|Relative hour (Jewish law)}}
For almost all halakhic purposes, each day is divided into twelve equal "hours." There are two major opinions: 
*The [[Magen Avraham]] holds that because one may do "daytime" activities between daybreak and nightfall, one calculates the day from daybreak to nightfall, and divides that period into twelve parts.  (Magen Avraham holds daybreak as 72 minutes before sunrise, and nightfall as 72 minutes after sunset, for this purpose.)
*The [[Vilna Gaon]] holds that although "daytime" activities can start as early as daybreak and end as late as nightfall, their proper time ''lechatchila (ab initio)'' is from sunrise to sunset, so one calculates the day from sunrise to sunset and divides ''that'' period into twelve parts.&lt;ref name="Zmanim Terms" /&gt; 
The result is that "Magen Avraham times" are earlier in the morning than "Vilna Gaon times"; in practice there are communities that follow each of those standards. For times in the afternoon, the Vilna Gaon's times are earlier, and are almost universally followed.

These are called "[[Relative hour (Jewish law)|seasonal]]" or "variable" hours because they depend on the length of time between sunrise (or daybreak) and sunset (or nightfall), and those vary through the year.  Near New York, for example, a "seasonal hour" based on the Vilna Gaon's calculations lasts around 45 minutes near winter solstice, around 60 minutes near the equinoxes, and around 75 minutes near summer solstice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zmanim for Highland Park (NJ)|url=http://www.myzmanim.com/day.aspx?vars=69590482|publisher=MyZmanim.com|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Times==

===Daybreak===
Daybreak (עֲלוֹת הַשַּׁחַר, ''Alot Hashachar'') refers to when the first rays of light are visible in the morning.&lt;ref&gt;But see Bi'ur Halacha 89, replacing daybreak with Ha'ir Pnei Mizrach.&lt;/ref&gt;
*If one has not recited the evening [[Shema]] by this time, and the omission was not due to negligence, one can still recite it now, up to sunrise, though one may not say [[Hashkiveinu]] or [[Baruch Hashem L'Olam (Maariv)|Baruch Hashem L'Olam]].
*If one has prayed [[Shacharit]] after this time, one has fulfilled his obligation ''ex post facto.'' Furthermore, most [[mitzvot]] that must be performed during the day (such as the [[Four Species]] or [[Hallel]]) may be done after this time, at least ''ex post facto.'' 
*One does not use [[tallit|tallis]] and tefillin before [[#Morning|''misheyakir'' (משיכיר)]].

===Sunrise===
Sunrise (הַנֵץ הַחַמָּה, ''Hanetz Hachamah'') refers to when the ball of the sun rises above the horizon. Technically, it is preferable to pray the morning Shema just before this time and begin the [[Amidah]] just afterwards, although this is rarely done nowadays. Most [[mitzvot]] that must be performed during the day (such as the [[Four Species]] or [[Hallel]]) should be done after this time ''ab initio.''

===Sof Zman Kriyat Shema===
''Sof Zman Kriyat Shema'' (סוֹף זְמַן קְרִיאַת שְׁמַע) means "end of the time to say the [morning] [[Shema]]." This is three [[Relative hour (Jewish law)|halachic hours]] into the day. These hours are variable/seasonal hours and refer to one twelfth of the time between daybreak and nightfall (according to the [[Magen Avraham]]) ''or'' one twelfth of the time between sunrise and sunset (according to the [[Vilna Gaon]]).

===Sof Zman Tefilah===
''Sof Zman Tefilah'' (סוֹף זְמַן תְּפִלָּה) means "end of the time to say the [[Shacharit]] Amidah." This is four [[Relative hour (Jewish law)|(variable) hours]] into the day. The above comments apply here also. However, since the Amidah is only rabbinically required (unlike the Shema which is Scriptually mandated) it is common to rely on the later time, and few calendars publish the earlier time.

===Midday===
Midday (חֲצוֹת הַיּוֹם, ''Chatzot Hayom'' or just ''Chatzot'') means the midpoint between sunrise and sunset, or equivalently between daybreak and sundown. The absolute latest time for the Shacharit Amidah, ''ex post facto,'' is this time. On the [[Shabbat]] and on [[Jewish holidays|holidays]], one is supposed to eat before this time (except on [[Rosh Hashanah]]). On [[Tish'a Ba'av]] one may sit on a chair at this time, and those who fast on [[Erev Rosh Hashanah]] usually eat at this time.

===Mincha Gedolah===
''Minchah Gedolah''' (מִנְחָה גְּדוֹלָה, literally the greater [[Minchah]]), one-half [[Variable hour|variable hour]] after midday, is the earliest time to recite Minchah, although one should try, if possible, to wait until Minchah Ketanah (literally the smaller Minchah). On [[Yom Kippur]], the congregation ''must'' begin [[Mussaf]] by this time, because otherwise they would be required to [[Jewish prayer|pray]] the more frequent prayer (Mincha) first.

===Mincha Ketanah===
''Minchah Ketanah'' (מִנְחָה קְטַנָּה, literally the smaller [window of praying] Minchah), two and one-half [[Variable hour|variable hours]] before sunset, is the preferable earliest time to recite Minchah.

===Plag Hamincha===
''Plag Hamincha'' (פְּלַג הַמִּנְחָה, literally half of the Minchah) is the midpoint between Minchah Ketanah and sunset, i.e. one and one-quarter [[Variable hour|variable hours]] before sunset. If one prayed Minchah before this time, one may recite [[Maariv]] afterwards (at the conclusion of the Sabbath, this may only be done under extenuating circumstances). Otherwise, one must wait until sunset, unless one is praying as a congregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More on Plag Hamincha|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/144443/jewish/Plag-Hamincha.htm|publisher=Chabad|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sunset===
'''Sunset''' (שְׁקִיעַת הַחַמָּה, ''Shkiyat Hachamah'' - often referred to simply as ''{{visible anchor|'''ShKia'''}}''/''{{visible anchor|Sh'Kia}}''/''{{visible anchor|SheKia}}'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=OUkosher.org 
|title=Why do we light Shabbos candles eighteen minutes before shkia
|url=https://oukosher.org/halacha-yomis/light-shabbos-candles-eighteen-minutes-shkia-sunset}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the time at which the ball of the sun falls below the horizon. The new day begins at this point for almost all purposes. For example, the calendar date changes.
:Some sources indicate that if one ate an additional specified quantity of bread, and a meal eaten now includes the new day's additions in [[Birkat Hamazon|Grace after Meals]], then they are added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/birchas-hamazon-on-rosh-chodesh
|title=Birchas Hamazon on Rosh Chodesh}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:::Ex. ReTzei and YaaLeh VeYaVo on Shabbos Erev Rosh Chodesh, eating more Challah after ShKia

[[Mitzvot]] that must be performed during the day may no longer be performed ''ab initio.'' Minchah should not be delayed past now. Maariv may be recited now, although many wait until after nightfall.

Sunset's calendar date change effects include knowing how to match secular date of passing away with [[Yartzeit]] date.

===Bein Hashemashot===
''Bein Hashemashot'' (בֵּין הַשְּׁמָשׁוֹת, literally between the suns) is the period between sunset and nightfall, and is considered a time of questionable status. On the Sabbath, festivals, and fast days the stringencies of both the previous and following days apply. For example, if the fast of Tish'a Ba'av immediately follows the Sabbath, the intervening Bein Hashemashot is forbidden in eating, drinking, ''and'' [[Activities prohibited on Shabbat|working]]. However, there are occasional leniencies.

===Nightfall===
Nightfall (צֵאת הַכּוֹֹכָבִים, ''Tzet Hakochavim'') is described in detail [[#Evening|above]].  After nightfall, it is considered definitely the following day. All restrictions of the previous day go away, and any Mitzvot that must be performed at night (such as the evening [[Shema]], the [[Passover Seder|Seder]], or [[Bedikas Chametz]] may be performed.

====End of Shabbat====
מוצאי שבת, the End of Shabbat (or equivalently, the end of a festival or fast), is described in the Talmud as a time when "three medium stars are [visible] in the sky."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Starry Starry Night|url=http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/176/Q2/|publisher=Ohr Sameyach|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is much discussion of what this means, and not to end Shabbat "too" early, it tends to be construed strictly in practice.  There are various observed practices, all of which have support in the halachic literature:
*Appearance of three medium-sized stars in the sky.
*Appearance of three small stars.
*72 minutes after sundown ("opinion of [[Rabbeinu Tam]]"). Common practice in [[Chasidism|Chasidic]] and other [[Charedi]] communities. 

===Midnight===
Midnight (חֲצוֹת הַלַּילָה, ''Chatzot Halaylah'' or just ''Chatzot'') is the midpoint between nightfall and daybreak, or equivalently between sunset and sunrise. The evening Shema should be recited by now, and the [[Afikoman]] on Passover should be eaten by this time. The Talmud in Berachot rules that all "night" mitzvot should be performed by ''Chatzot,'' at least ''ab initio,'' in case the person would otherwise fall asleep and then fail to perform the mitzvot.  Some rise at this time and recite ''Tikkun Chatzot'', a series of supplications for the rebuilding of the Temple.

===Other zmanim===
On the Eve of [[Passover]], [[chametz]] may not be eaten after four variable hours, and must be burned before five variable hours.

The [[Mussaf]] [[Jewish prayer|prayer]] should preferably be recited before seven variable hours, on days it is recited.
