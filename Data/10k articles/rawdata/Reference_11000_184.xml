[[File:A Dictionary of Hymnology Vol. 1.pdf|thumb]]
'''''A Dictionary of Hymnology: Origin and History of Christian Hymns and Hymnwriters of All Ages and Nations, Together with Biographical and Critical Notices of Their Authors and Translators''''' by [[John D. Julian]], first published in 1892, is a standard historical reference for early [[Christian]] [[hymns]], with more than 40,000 entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hawn |first=C. Michael |title=Gather Into One: Praying and Singing Globally |publisher=Eerdmans |location=Grand Rapids |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work contains biographical and historical notes about the history of hymns and hymn writers. It is not a collection of hymn texts or [[hymn tune]]s, though brief quotations and references are included. Originally published in 1892 in [[London]] by [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] and in [[New York City]] by [[Charles Scribner's Sons]], it was reprinted in 1907-1908 by John Murray, in 1957 by [[Dover Publications]] (in two volumes) and in 1985 by [[Kregel Publications]]. It was not revised after 1902, but remains an important source for early Christian hymns, such as [[Latin]] ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nutter |first=Charles S. |last2=Tillett |first2=Wilbur F. |title=The Hymns and Hymn Writers of the Church |publisher=The Methodist Book Concern |location=New York |year=1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new ''Canterbury Dictionary of Hymnology'', edited by J.R. Watson and Emma Hornby, was published on-line by Canterbury Press in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/arts/birtha/events/hymnology/ |title=Canterbury Dictionary of Hymnology Launch Conference |publisher=Bristol University |date=2013-05-16 |accessdate=2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alcatraz Hospital''' is a defunct hospital which was located on [[Alcatraz Island]], [[California]], US. It began operations in the 19th century while the [[United States Army]] operated [[Alcatraz Citadel|Fort Alcatraz]] and continued to provide services after the transition to the [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary]]. Though Alcatraz is now part of the [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]], the hospital is not included on the general tour.&lt;ref name="ghostinmysuitcase.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghostinmysuitcase.com/places/alcatraz/index.htm|title= Alcatraz, "The Rock"|work=Ghost in my Suitcase|publisher=23 House Publishing|accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1870, the military hospital had ten beds, as well as tables, chairs, washstands, a [[Dumbwaiter (elevator)|dumbwaiter]], and a closet. Measuring {{convert|35|x|26|ft}}, it was heated by coal stoves.&lt;ref name="GrassickFurnishings1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grassick|first=Mary K.|title=Fort Point: Fort Point National Historic Site, Presidio of San Francisco, California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kdv1DUQiHaEC|accessdate=5 September 2012|year=1994|publisher=Division of Historic Furnishings, Harpers Ferry Center, National Park Service|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was expanded in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Wellman2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wellman|first=Gregory L.|title=A History of Alcatraz Island:: 1853-2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1duAUPaHSgcC&amp;pg=PA20|accessdate=5 September 2012|date=28 May 2008|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-5815-8|pages=20–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The penitentiary hospital was established on June 14, 1934. It provided medical and dental service to inmates, prison personnel, Lighthouse Service employees, and to civilians on the island.&lt;ref name="Inventory1940"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Historical Records Survey (U.S.)|author2=National Archives Project|author3=Survey of Federal Archives (U.S.)|author4=National Archives (U.S.)|title=Inventory of federal archives in the states|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=htlFAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=5 September 2012|year=1940|publisher=Historical Records Survey|page=1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital was situated on the floor above the [[Alcatraz Dining Hall|dining room]].  It contained three large wards with five hospital beds each, two isolation wards; a treatment room, surgery room, and a supply room; a doctor's office, dentists office, and chief Medical Technical Assistant's (MTA) office; plus a kitchen, and a bathroom with toilet and shower.&lt;ref name="Bruce2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruce|first=J.

While a physician was in residence on the island through the 1950s, cost cutting measures included switching to private contracted physicians.&lt;ref name="Gregory2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gregory|first=George H.|title=Alcatraz Screw: My Years as a Guard in America's Most Notorious Prison|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WIEUx4IGqHMC&amp;pg=PA151|accessdate=5 September 2012|date=28 April 2008|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=978-0-8262-1396-9|pages=151–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the most notable hospital patients were [[Robert Stroud]], the "Birdman of Alcatraz",&lt;ref name="Westbrook2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Westbrook|first=Tina|title=Return to Alcatraz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tV6q0N8UxyYC&amp;pg=PA59|accessdate=5 September 2012|date=September 2010|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4269-4357-7|pages=59–}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had his own hospital cell; and [[Al Capone]] who spent more time in the hospital than in the general prison population.&lt;ref name="RyanSchlup2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ryan|first1=James Gilbert|last2=Schlup|first2=Leonard C.|title=Historical Dictionary of The 1940s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-t3Hx4ASLKUC&amp;pg=PA9|accessdate=5 September 2012|date=30 June 2006|publisher=M.E.

'''Anna Murray Vail''' (January 7, 1863 – December 18, 1955) was an American botanist and first librarian of the [[New York Botanical Garden]].  She was a student of the [[Columbia University]] botanist and geologist [[Nathaniel Lord Britton]], the force behind the founding of the New York Botanical Garden, and was active in its creation.

== Early life ==
Anna was born in New York's east side, the first child of David Olyphant Vail and Cornelia Georgina (Nina) Van Rensselear.&lt;ref name="Spooner"&gt;W. W. Spooner, THE VAN RENSSELAER FAMILY, American Historical Magazine, vol 2 # 1, 1907.&lt;/ref&gt;  On her mother's side, she is descended from two of New York's most elite Dutch families, the [[Van Rensselaer (family)|Van Rensselear]] and Van Cortlandts.  Her great-great-grandfather was General Robert Van Rensselaer, who fought at Ticonderoga during the American Revolution under the orders of his mother's brother in law, General [[Philip Schuyler]].&lt;ref name="Spooner" /&gt;  Her younger sister, Cornelia, married [[Henry Golden Dearth]] a distinguished American painter.

Her father, David Olyphant Vail, was the son of Benjamin C. and Eliza Ann (née Archer) Vail.&lt;ref&gt;"Rhode Island, Marriages, 1724–1916," index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/F8VL-K6N : accessed March 4, 2013), David Olyphant Vail and Cornelia Georgina (King) Van Rensselaer, March 27, 1862.&lt;/ref&gt;  David O. Vail's connection to the Olyphant family is through his maternal grandmother, Ann Mckenzie (1782 – November 5, 1857).  Her first husband was Zeno Archer, whom she married in 1803.  Their daughter was Eliza Ann who married Benjamin Vail.  Following Zeno's death, Ann McKenzie Archer married David W.C. Olyphant.

David O. Vail is listed as a "merchant" on an 1862 ship manifest&lt;ref&gt;Arrival Record, SS Africa March 14, 1862 in NY,&lt;/ref&gt; and in a Van Rensselaer family history is described as "...resident partner of the house of Olyphant &amp; Company at Shanghai, China."&lt;ref&gt;Van Rensselaer and Allied Families, Americana, vol 14, page 299, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;  His death notice describes him as being "...lately of China...", but it is not clear where or of what he died in 1865 at age 32.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/18/news/died.html|title=DIED|date=April 18, 1865|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His middle name, Olyphant, and the fact that he worked for Olyphant &amp; Company reflect his connection to that family on his mother's side.  Olyphant and Company, founded in 1827 by David WC Olyphant and Charles N. Talbot, was one of the pioneers of the [[Old China Trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1878/12/08/archives/a-widereaching-failure-disaster-to-an-oldestablished-firm-olyphant.html|title=A WIDE-REACHING FAILURE|date=December 8, 1878|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional activities ==
Her early education was in Europe but by 1895 she was back in the United States and working at Columbia University with [[Nathaniel Lord Britton]], who with his wife [[Elizabeth Gertrude Britton]], was the founding force behind the New York Botanical Garden.  In January 1900, she became the first librarian of the newly founded Bronx institution, a post she held until September 1907.&lt;ref&gt;List of Staff Members New York Botanical Garden 1896 to 1939, J. NY Botanical Garden, vol 41 #485, May 1940&lt;/ref&gt;  While in New York, she was the author of over a dozen scientific papers (see bibliography).  Her notes, preserved in the Archives and Manuscripts collection of the [[New York Botanical Garden]], include sketches of some of the plants she studied.

In 1903 Vail traveled to Paris, France, for an auction of the botanical literature of the late Professor Alexis Jordan. She obtained over 400 items, including ten volumes of John Sibthorp's Flora graeca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Callery|first1=Bernadette G.|title=Collecting Collections: Building the Library of the New York Botanical Garden|journal=Brittonia|date=January 1, 1995|volume=47|issue=1|pages=44–56|doi=10.2307/2807247|jstor=2807247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vail wrote on numerous botanical topics; for example, her 1898 co-authored work (with [[Elizabeth Gertrude Britton]], among others), details "New or Rare Mosses", such as Anacamptodon Splachnoides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Britton|first1=Elizabeth G.|last2=Vail|first2=Anna Murray|last3=Burnett|first3=D. A.|last4=Classon|first4=E.|last5=Kennedy|first5=George G.|last6=Best|first6=George N.|title=New or Rare Mosses|journal=The Bryologist|date=April 1898|volume=1|issue=2|pages=41|doi=10.2307/3238611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An account in the records of the [[New York Botanical Garden]] presents Vail's resignation from the Garden's Library as resulting from her indignation of being accused of smoking cigarettes in the library. However, this account is disputed by a letter in the files of Nathaniel Lord Britton dated September 28, 1907, which mentions her departure as being due to an extended separation from her mother, who was living in France. This letter indicates no ill will.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Murray Vail Papers, Mertz Library, New York Botanical Garden, http://www.nybg.org/library/finding_guide/archv/vail_ppf.html, accessed January 25, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;   [[File:Pen &amp; ink sketch of Cynanchum sp by Anna Murray Vail.jpg|thumb|Pen &amp; ink sketch of Cynanchum sp by Anna Murray Vail.  This was created by Ms. Vail in 1899 when she was librarian at the New York Botanical Garden.]]

In 1911 she moved to France.  During [[World War I]], she became active in the American Fund for French Wounded, eventually becoming its treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;American Fund for French Wounded Monthly Report, Vol II, Sept – Oct 1917, Nos. 21 – 22&lt;/ref&gt;  A letter to the head of the U.S.-based organization, Mrs. Schuyler Van Rensselaer, was published in ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1918/08/08/archives/our-wounded-splendid-want-to-get-back-into-fight-miss-vail-writes.html|title=OUR WOUNDED SPLENDID|date=August 8, 1918|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter reads, in part,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Every department of the Red Cross has borrowed nurses and aids, and we of the American Fund have given everything we had for the emergency.  If it gets worse, I shall offer my own services, for I can make beds and clean up, and no part of the work will terrify me, even if I am not a trained nurse.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Later years ==
While living in France she acquired a house in [[Hericy]].  Here she would spend her remaining years, continuing her work as a librarian until blindness forced her to stop.  She died in Vieux Logis on December 18, 1955 and is buried in the municipal cemetery at Hericy.

The '''Benin ivory mask''' is a miniature sculptural portrait in [[ivory]] of the powerful [[Queen mother|Queen Mother]] [[Idia]] of the 16th century [[Benin Empire]], taking the form of an [[African traditional mask]].

Two almost identical masks are extant: one at the [[British Museum]] in [[London]] and the other at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/asset/ivory-mask/YwEcUb_gRSUFrw|title=Ivory mask - Google Arts &amp; Culture|newspaper=Google Cultural Institute|access-date=2017-02-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="met"&gt;Metropolitan Museum Collection [http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/318622 Queen Mother Pendant Mask: Iyoba], MetMuseum, retrieved 1 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Both feature a serene face of the Queen Mother wearing a [[Precious coral|beaded]] headdress, a beaded [[choker]] at her neck, [[scarification]] highlighted by iron [[inlay]] on the forehead, and all framed by the flange of an [[openwork]] tiara and collar of symbolic beings, as well as double loops at each side for attachment of the pendant.

===Benin Empire===
In the early 16th century, the dynamic [[Esigie]] ruled the [[Benin Empire]] of the [[Edo people]] as its [[oba (ruler)|Oba]]. He came to power as [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese explorers]] [[first contact (anthropology)|first made contact]] with the empire. Trade and diplomacy with Europe brought Esigie and the Edo prosperity and regional influence as the empire traded pepper, ivory, local textiles, and slaves for brass, cloth, coral beads, and mercenaries for protection. Esigie engaged in two major conflicts. First, his half-brother fought a protracted civil war over the [[line of succession]] that would crown Esigie, the firstborn. Second, Esigie successfully defended against an invasion from the northern [[Igala Kingdom]] and captured their leader.{{sfn|LaGamma|2011|p=28}} Esigie rewarded his key political and mystical advisor during these trials, his mother [[Idia]], with the title of ''Iyoba'' ([[Queen mother#African monarchies|Queen Mother]])—the first in a tradition of Queen Mother advisors&lt;!--commemorated in [[cast bronze]] statues and given their own palace in Uselu (village now in Benin City)--&gt;.{{sfn|LaGamma|2011|p=29}}  The identification with Idia was made by Oba [[Akenzua II]] in the mid-20th century.{{sfn|LaGamma|2011|p=26}}

===Ritual use===
The [[Oba of Benin]] commissioned works from his guild of ivory and wood carvers, the ''Igbesanmwan''. Their works were customized for their ruler, between the material connotations of ivory and the visual motifs in the carvings.{{sfn|Ezra|1984|p=21}} At least two of the masks feature Portuguese imagery (although this imagery outlasted the actual Portuguese presence)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8PDPDRgO4sC&amp;lpg=PP1 |title=Royal Art of Benin: The Perls Collection in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|last=Ezra|first=Kate|date=1992-01-01 |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=9780870996337|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coll" /&gt; and thus were likely created during Esigie's early-16th century rule (possibly ca. 1520),&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VckaCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA478|title=Voyages in World History|last=Hansen|first=Valerie|last2=Curtis|first2=Ken|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781305888418|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; either during Idia's life or soon after her death.{{sfn|LaGamma|2011|p=28}} The similarities between the masks indicate that they were likely created at the same time{{sfn|Bassani|1991|p=183}} by the same artist.{{sfn|LaGamma|2011|p=28}}  Their details match the comparable carving qualities of ivory spoons and [[salt cellar]]s commissioned during the same period,{{sfn|LaGamma|2011|p=28}} the early period of [[Benin art]], the phase of strongest affiliation with Ife or [[Yoruba art]].{{sfn|Bassani|1991|p=182}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CgIQc4ng0GoC&amp;pg=PA394|title=Art of Oceania, Africa, and the Americas from the Museum of Primitive Art|last=Goldwater|first=Robert|date=1969-06-01|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivory works from Benin were mainly for the Oba to use in ritual.{{sfn|Ezra|1984|p=18}} The masks may have been used in ceremonies including the Ugie Iyoba commemoration of the Oba's mother, as well the Emobo purification ceremony to expel bad spirits from the land.{{sfn|LaGamma|2011|p=28}}{{sfn|Ezra|1984|pp=20–21}}&lt;ref name=ezra2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ezra |first1=Kate|title=The Pacific Islands, Africa, and the Americas|date=1987|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=0870994611|page=84 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0870994611|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar [[Benin court and ceremonial art|pendant masks]] are mainly used in contemporary Emobo ceremonies focused on bad spirits, though the traditions of Emobo may have changed throughout history.{{sfn|Ezra|1984|pp=20–21}}

Four rungs on the side of the masks, above and below each ear, let the masks hang in suspension{{sfn|LaGamma|2011|p=28}} and indicate that the masks were suspended from a cord,{{sfn|Bassani|1991|p=183}} though experts have disagreed on how they were worn.{{sfn|LaGamma|2011|p=28}}{{sfn|Bassani|1991|p=183}} British Museum art historian [[William Fagg]] concluded that unlike the small brass pendant masks worn at the waist by modern kings, the ivory mask was likely worn around the neck. An 1830s drawing of a similar mask worn at the breast by a neighboring ruler confirms Fagg's theory.{{sfn|Bassani|1991|p=183}} Based on the position of the rungs, Metropolitan curator Alisa LaGamma also affirmed the theory.{{sfn|LaGamma|2011|p=28}} Benin specialist and anthropologist Paula Ben-Amos, however, wrote that the masks were worn on the waist as pendants during the Ugie Iyoba and Emobo ceremonies.{{sfn|LaGamma|2011|p=28}} The hollow masks likely served as [[amulet]]ic containers.{{sfn|LaGamma|2011|p=28}}  Below the mask's collars, the ring of small loops are attachment points for [[crotal bell]]s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8PDPDRgO4sC&amp;pg=PA153|title=Royal Art of Benin: The Perls Collection in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|last=Ezra|first=Kate|date=1992-01-01|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=9780870996337|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Description}}

== Description and interpretation ==
They are made of ivory, long and ovular in shape,{{sfn|LaGamma|2011|pp=26–28}}&lt;!--fewer pages?--&gt; and thinly carved, approaching semiopaqueness.{{sfn|Ezra|1984|p=21}} The similar British Museum and Metropolitan pendant masks have elaborate ornament at their hair and collar. Each mask's gaze is accentuated with iron inlay at its pupils and lower eye outline, and the eyes are slightly diverted by the eyelids.{{sfn|LaGamma|2011|pp=26–28}}{{refn|The Met's mask uses iron inlay in the pupils and forehead markings, and copper inlay for the eyelid outline.{{sfn|Bassani|1991|p=183}}}} This use of inlay departed from the ways in which Europeans used ivory.{{sfn|Bassani|1991|p=183}} Above the eyes, the four [[Supraorbital ridge|supraorbital]] marks are associated with Benin women.{{sfn|Ben-Amos|1980}} The masks' facial features are symmetrical and skillfully precise.{{sfn|Bassani|1991|p=183}} Their lips are parted, nostrils slightly flared, and hair dense with tiny coils and a rectilinear hairline.{{sfn|LaGamma|2011|p=28}} The masks' expression of "impersonal coolness" reflected the stylistic conventions of the Oba's ivory carvers guild, with a naturalism typical of craft in early Benin art.{{sfn|Bassani|1991|p=183}}

===A powerful woman===

The depiction of women is rare in [[Benin art]],&lt;ref name="met" /&gt; though the position of [[Idia]], known to [[Edo people|Edo tradition]] as "the only woman who went to war", is exceptional, and the very title of ''Iyoba'' or Queen Mother was created for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/pwmn_3/hd_pwmn_3.htm|title=Idia: The First Queen Mother of Benin {{!}} Essay {{!}} Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|last=Bortolot|first=Author: Alexander Ives|website=The Met's Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The headdress forms part of the ''[[ukpe-okhue]]'' ("parrot's beak") hairstyle she originated, and is more clearly seen on the [[Bronze Head of Queen Idia]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The depicted [[precious coral]] of the headdress and choker are in the form of cylindrical ''ikele'' ("royal") beads, which it was the specially-granted privilege of the Queen Mother to wear, being usually reserved for the Oba and the ''Edogun'' (war chief).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EFI7tr9XK6EC&amp;pg=PA527|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|last=Smith|first=Bonnie G.|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=9780195148909|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8PDPDRgO4sC&amp;pg=PA41|title=Royal Art of Benin: The Perls Collection in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|last=Ezra|first=Kate|date=1992-01-01|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=9780870996337|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vm9JAQAAIAAJ|title=The Art of Benin|last=|first=|date=2010-01-01|publisher=British Museum Press|year=|isbn=9780714125916|location=|pages=13|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZtQP5why918C&amp;pg=PA267|title=A Companion to Gender History|last=Meade|first=Teresa A.|last2=Wiesner-Hanks|first2=Merry E.|date=2008-04-15|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780470692820|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Linden Museum mask also has  a string of actual ''ikiele'' beads of coral wrapped around its forehead.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://raai.library.yale.edu/site/index.php?globalnav=image_detail&amp;image_id=7588|title=Die Altertümer von Benin|last=Luschan|first=Felix von|last2=Ankermann|first2=B|last3=Arthur Baessler-Stiftung|date=1919-01-01|publisher=De Gruyter|year=|isbn=|location=Berlin; Leipzig|pages=|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These red beads and red cloth, once reserved for leadership figures, have in modern times been popularly adopted as elements of Edo traditional dress.

The foreheads of both masks were are inscribed with four vertical [[cicatrice]]s over each eye, with inlays of a pair of iron strips highlighting the [[scarification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3VJAQAAIAAJ|title=Africa|last=|first=|date=2001-01-01|publisher=Prestel|year=|isbn=9783791325804|location=|pages=74|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Iron is also used in the pupils and rims of the eyes.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

===Trade symbolism===
[[File:Detail of Portuguese merchant and mudfish from crown of Met's Queen Mother Pendant Mask- Iyoba (cropped).jpg|thumb|Detail of Portuguese merchant head and [[Protopterus|mudfish]]]]

Ivory, both then and now, connotes royal wealth, power, and purity.{{sfn|Ezra|1984|p=21}} Ivory, already a luxury commodity in Africa, became increasingly coveted with the growth of the European [[ivory trade]].{{sfn|Ezra|1984|p=14}} When an elephant was killed in Benin, the Oba received one tusk as a gift and was offered the other in sale. Thus, the Oba had many tusks and controlled the ivory trade.{{sfn|Ezra|1984|p=16}} Ivory is associated with the [[Edo people|Edo]] [[orisha]] of the sea, [[Olokun]]. As this orisha gives wealth and fertility, it the spirit world's equivalent of the Benin Oba.

The [[openwork]] of the tiara and collar represent tiny heads of Portuguese men in the tiara of both the Met and the British Museum examples, with eleven figures in the British Museum mask, and in the Met mask seven figures of Portuguese men alternating with six representations of mudfish, the [[West African lungfish]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The Portuguese, who had only recently arrived in the area, were a symbol of power and affluence to the royal court.{{sfn|LaGamma|2011|p=28}} Their iconography is identifiable by their long hair, hanging mustaches (often described as bearded), and domed hats.{{sfn|Ezra|1984|p=21}}&lt;!-- Ezra identifies the heads as soldiers, not merchants --&gt; Benin art historian Barbara Blackmun interprets these crown adornments as a reference to Idia's ability to conduct the Portuguese power to her son's favor.{{sfn|LaGamma|2011|p=29}} Mudfish were a common theme in Benin royal arts,{{sfn|LaGamma|2011|p=28}} and reflected the divinity of the Oba.{{sfn|Ezra|1984|p=18}} Edo cosmology believed that spirits crossed the ocean to reach the afterlife, where their leaders lived like gods.

The Met's mask was acquired in 1972 as a gift of [[Nelson Rockefeller]].&lt;ref name=met/&gt; He founded the [[Museum of Primitive Art]] in 1954 after the Metropolitan Museum did not reciprocate his interest in [[Precolumbian art]]. The museum collected works for their artistic—and not anthropological—value,{{sfn|LaGamma|2014|pp=4–6}} contrasting with the earlier history of [[African art in Western collections]].  The [[Queens College]] art historian [[Robert Goldwater]] became its director and recommended acquisitions.{{sfn|LaGamma|2014|pp=5–7}} His argument to collect the ivory pendant mask was among his longest, at the end of 1957. He called it "the best object of its kind known, nor will any others ever turn up". Goldwater wrote that the mask was higher in quality than the similar, renowned one owned by the British Museum. The mask, he predicted, would redefine the collection and go on permanent display, on par with the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s well-known ''[[Sleeping Gypsy]]'' (1897) by [[Henri Rousseau]]. Rockefeller purchased the mask at a record price and unveiled it in September 1958. The purchase solidified a policy that Goldwater believed the museum should center around permanent collections of [[masterpiece|masterworks]].{{sfn|LaGamma|2014|p=7}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4306">'''Benrishi''' (弁理士) is a [[Japan]]ese legal profession specifically licensed to practice [[intellectual property]] law. Most benrishi specialize in [[patent]] law, but are also allowed to practice in [[copyright]], [[trademark]], [[unfair competition]] and [[trade secret]] law.

While benrishi are often referred to as "[[patent attorney]]s" in English, their qualifications differ from patent [[lawyer|attorneys]] in the [[United States]] and [[Germany]] in some aspects. Benrishi are not necessarily required to possess legal educations. Benrishi also have greater authority than patent specialists in other countries, as they are allowed to represent clients in administrative proceedings and out-of-court bargaining related to IP rights.

The benrishi examination (弁理士試験 ''benrishi-shiken'') covers a broad range of intellectual property law (patent, utility model, design, trademark, treaties, copyright and unfair competition law) and limited fields of law and science. The benrishi examination consisted of three stages. The first stage is the multiple choice exam, the second stage is the essay exam, and the final stage is the oral exam.

{{As of|2012}}, 9,300 benrishi are practicing in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.jpaa.or.jp/english/aboutus/pdf/DistributionMap.pdf | format = PDF | title = Membership Breakdown of the Japan Patent Attorneys Association | publisher = Japan Patent Attorney Association | date = February 29, 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130626033431/http://www.jpaa.or.jp/english/aboutus/pdf/DistributionMap.pdf | archivedate = June 26, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately as many per capita as in the United States. Entrance to the profession is regulated by a low pass rate (about 7% as of 2008; it was less than 3% until about 1997) on the benrishi examination only. The [[Japan Patent Office]] and government officials have expressed an interest in attracting more individuals to the profession as part of a broader series of reforms in Japan's legal professions.

Different from a U.S. patent agent, a benrishi is qualified to prosecute trademark applications, assist clients in copyright and licensing matters, and to represent clients in some court proceedings and custom seizure matters.

==History==

The benrishi profession was adopted from [[Germany|German]] [[patent]] law, which Japan duplicated during the [[Meiji era]]. The Benrishi Law (弁理士法 ''benrishi-hō'') was passed in 1921&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpaa.or.jp/english/aboutus/history.html |title=History of the Japan Patent Attorneys Association |publisher=Japan Patent Attorneys Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325145653/http://www.jpaa.or.jp/english/aboutus/history.html |archivedate=2014-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained almost unchanged through the end of the 20th century.

In 2001, after a decade of economic stagnation, the Benrishi Law was changed, and the role of the benrishi in the patent system was changed significantly. Benrishi were allowed to represent clients in adversarial proceedings before [[Customs (tax)|customs]] courts and in [[arbitration]]. The law was revised again in 2002 to allow benrishi to represent clients in [[court]]room [[litigation]], either independently of or in cooperation with attorneys. Benrishi has been qualified to be a legal representative for appealing to the [[Intellectual Property High Court]] (the exclusive jurisdiction) representing the client against the adverse decision of Trial Board (consisting of three administrative trial judges) of Japan Patent Office, and even up to the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] (The Benrishi Law Article 6). Benrishi can also represent the infringement cases if it meets the criteria (The Benrishi Law Article 6bis).

The '''Bible of Queen Sophia''' (or '''Queen Sophia's Bible''', {{lang-pl|Biblia królowej Zofii|links=no}}, also '''Sárospatak Bible''', ''Biblia Szaroszp(a)otacka'') is the oldest surviving translation of the [[Old Testament]] into the Polish language and the first complete translation of the [[Bible]] into Polish.&lt;ref name="Greenslade1975"/&gt; The work is seen as a significant milestone in the history of the Polish language,&lt;ref name="Penson"/&gt; and the most extensive example of the medieval [[Old Polish language]].&lt;ref name="UlewiczBafia"/&gt;&lt;ref name=wsp/&gt;

The bible was commissioned by [[Sophia of Halshany]], wife of the Polish king [[Jogaila]].&lt;ref name="Hastings2004"/&gt; Queen Sophia did not know Latin, and wished for a bible she could read herself.&lt;ref name="Jasienica1978"/&gt; The translation started in 1433 and ceased in 1455; the work was not fully finished (some illustrations were completed only two centuries later).&lt;ref name="wsp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hastings2004"/&gt; The primary author of the translation was the Queen's chaplain, [[Andrzej z Jaszowic]].&lt;ref name=wsp/&gt;

A copy of the bible was held by the library at [[Sárospatak]] in Hungary&lt;ref name="Hastings2004"/&gt; from at least 1708;&lt;ref name="WydraRzepka1995"/&gt; hence the other name for this book.&lt;ref name="Jasienica1978"/&gt; The bible was composed of two parchment folios&lt;ref name="Jasienica1978"/&gt; numbering 470 pages in total.&lt;ref name="Kuliczkowski1880"/&gt; Only 185 pages of the first folio survived to the 19th century,&lt;ref name="Kuliczkowski1880"/&gt; as the second had been destroyed to provide bindings for other books.&lt;ref name="Jasienica1978"/&gt; The first volume was also lost (presumed destroyed&lt;ref name=wsp/&gt;) during World War I, but [[Ludwik Bernacki]] published a [[facsimile]] edition in 1930.&lt;ref name="Jasienica1978"/&gt; Several pages were recovered during the [[interwar period]] but most were lost during World War II. Today only two and a half pages remain: two at the [[University of Wrocław]] and half a page at the [[National Library of the Czech Republic]] in Prague.&lt;ref name=wsp/&gt;

The text of the bible is known through reproductions. The first complete printed edition of the work was in 1871, through the effort of [[Antoni Małecki]].&lt;ref name="UlewiczBafia"/&gt;

The '''Brodsky Synagogue in Odessa''' was built by the Jews from [[Brody]] in 1863 in [[Odessa]], [[Ukraine]]. It was the largest synagogue in the south of the then [[Russian Empire]]. People came from all over the world to hear [[cantor]]s sing there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timer-odessa.net/statji/Ta_Odessa__Brodskaya_sinagoga_v_ocheredi_na_unic.html|title=Та Одесса.

==History==

===Early 1800s===
In the early 1800s Jewish immigrants began to stream into Odessa from Europe, many of them came from the town of Brody.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Odessa |title=YIVO {{!}} Odessa |website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org |access-date=2016-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015191211/http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Odessa |archivedate=2014-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6bZCgAAQBAJ|title=The Cambridge Companion to Jewish Music|last=Walden|first=Joshua S.|date=2015-11-19|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107023451|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1840s the “Brodsky” Jews leased their first synagogue, at the corner of Pushkin and Postal (now Zhukovsky) in a relatively small house from the wealthy Greek businessman Ksenysu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishnews.com.ua/en/publication/jewish_ukraine_6_facts_about_the_jews_of_odessa|title=Jewish Ukraine: 6 facts about the Jews of Odessa - Jewish News|website=Jewish Ukraine: 6 facts about the Jews of Odessa - Jewish News|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cantor was Rabbi Nissan Blumenthal, who also came from the town of Brody.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11660-odessa|title=ODESSA - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=-msUBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA274&amp;lpg=PA274&amp;dq=Rabbi+Nissan+Blumenthal+odessa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xG2YhmSP1R&amp;sig=Z7lAvHg29zfPTYy3K1yule6enfc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyg_mBkdzMAhVC1ywKHRbWAH4Q6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Rabbi%2520Nissan%2520Blumenthal%2520odessa&amp;f=false|title=The Art of Being Jewish in Modern Times|last=Kirshenblatt-Gimblett|first=Barbara|last2=Karp|first2=Jonathan|date=2013-02-11|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=9780812208863|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0004_0_04266.html|title=CHOIRS|last=|first=|date=|website=Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the documents from the Office of Novorossiysk and Bessarabian Governor-General, dated 1852, states: "All the educated people of the Jewish community in Odessa are going there. Their school leases a house, but it is deliberately arranged. The hall is quite extensive, there is also a gallery for the women…”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Та Одесса.

===The new synagogue===
In 1860 they received permission to begin building a new synagogue. It was designed by the famous architect [[Joseph N. Kollovich]] in the Gothic Florentine style, built with local [[limestone]], and completed in 1863. It was the largest synagogue in the south of the then Russian empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khanin|first=Vladimir|date=1998-01-01|title=A RABBINICAL REVOLUTION? RELIGION, POWER AND POLITICS IN THE CONTEMPORARY UKRAINIAN JEWISH MOVEMENT|jstor=25834416|journal=Jewish Political Studies Review|volume=10|issue=1/2|pages=73–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many famous composers and singers performed in the synagogue. Among them the composer [[Novakovsky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no92014585.html|title=Nowakowsky, David, 1848-1921 - LC Linked Data Service {{!}} Library of Congress|website=id.loc.gov|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cantor Minkovsky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6bZCgAAQBAJ|title=The Cambridge Companion to Jewish Music|last=Walden|first=Joshua S.|date=2015-11-19|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107023451|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The synagogue is mentioned in writings of [[Isaac Babel|Babel]], [[Shalom-Aleichem]], and [[Ivan Bunin]] (first Russian writer to win the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]). [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]], and [[Meir Dizengoff]], former Mayor of [[Tel Aviv]], are among the many Jews associated with this synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wupj.org/assets/news/461_BrodskySynagogueInterview.pdf|title=БРОДСКАЯ СИНАГОГ – АГОНИЯ РАВНОДУШИЯ|last=|first=|date=|website=The World Union for Progressive Judaism|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/sections/features/features-on-jewish-world/beyond-the-pale-jewish-ukraine-part-ii/2015/08/17/|title=Beyond The Pale: Jewish Ukraine (Part II)|last=Astaire|first=Libi|date=2015-08-17|website=The Jewish Press|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edrs.org.uk/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=233:the-brodsky-synagogue&amp;catid=35:general&amp;Itemid=156|title=The Brodsky Synagogue|last=Administrator|first=Super|website=www.edrs.org.uk|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Odessa, Ukraine at one point boasted the second-largest Jewish population (after [[Warsaw]]) according to [[YIVO]]. In 1897, Jews made up 34.6% of the city’s population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Odessa |title=YIVO {{!}} Odessa |website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org |access-date=2016-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015191211/http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Odessa |archivedate=2014-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synagogue in the Soviet era===
In 1920 all the synagogues in Odessa were taken away from the Jewish community. The Brody Synagogue was transformed into the “Rosa Luxemburg Workers Club”, as recorded in YIVO archives, which was a meeting place to push socialist propaganda.  The Ten Commandments over the synagogue's altar were covered with a photo of Vladimir Lenin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Odessa |title=YIVO {{!}} Odessa |website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org |access-date=2016-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015191211/http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Odessa |archivedate=2014-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yodfat|first=Aryeh Y.|date=1973-01-01|title=The closure of synagogues in the soviet union|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13501677308577146|journal=Soviet Jewish Affairs|volume=3|issue=1|pages=48–56|doi=10.1080/13501677308577146|issn=0038-545X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;dat=19281010&amp;id=tX0uAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CIwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6441,1655692&amp;hl=en|title=The Montreal Gazette - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===During WWII===

In 1939 the Jewish population had numbered 80,000 to 90,000, but by 1945 only 5,000 remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Odessa |title=YIVO {{!}} Odessa |website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org |access-date=2016-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015191211/http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Odessa |archivedate=2014-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, [[Hitler]] requested Romanian leader [[Ion Antonescu]] to occupy the Ukrainian territory between [[Dniester River|Dniester]] and [[Bug River]]s. In those days, the Odessa State archive was located in the basement of the Uspensky cathedral. The Romanians moved the archive into the “Brodsky” synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Jerusalem-Report/Jewish-World-Odessa-Remnanats-435719|title=Jewish World: Odessa Remnanats|website=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://viknaodessa.od.ua/news/?news=131113|title=Одесский облсовет готовится строить пристройку для архива, архивисты недовольны : Одесса : Новости : Викна-Одесса|website=Викна-Одесса: Художественная интернет-галерея|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==

===Local and national landmark===
In August 1985, the Odessa Regional Council established the Brodsky Synagogue as a monument of local importance. In June 2006, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Ukraine included the building in the State Register of Monuments of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rtrfoundation.org/Odessa.html|title=RTRFoundation|website=www.rtrfoundation.org|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eajc.org/page208|title=General Information on Ukrainian Jewish Organizations|website=eajc.org|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the building is on the verge of collapse. It has not been renovated for many years. The walls are being held by the bookshelves inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wupj.org/assets/news/461_BrodskySynagogueInterview.pdf|title=БРОДСКАЯ СИНАГОГ – АГОНИЯ РАВНОДУШИЯ|last=|first=|date=|website=The World Union for Progressive Judaism|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ukrainianjewishencounter.org/en/timeline/1863-69/197-1863?tmpl=component&amp;layout=timeline|title=Religion The Brodsky Synagogue|last=|first=|date=|website=Ukrainian Jewish Encounter|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://viknaodessa.od.ua/news/?news=121001|title=Руководство Одесского облархива обещает найти спонсора для ремонта нового помещения : Одесса : Новости : Викна-Одесса|website=Викна-Одесса: Художественная интернет-галерея|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration===
As of February 2016, the Brodsky Synagogue has been returned to the Jewish Community of Odessa. The decision was reached by a decisive majority of the regional council who voted to transfer the building taken from its community nearly 100 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jpupdates.com/2016/02/24/brodsky-synagogue-is-returned-to-odessas-jewish-community/|title=Brodsky Synagogue Is Returned to Odessa’s Jewish Community  {{!}}|website=jpupdates.com|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building, once restored, will house the Chabad Lubavitch Congregation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theodesatimes.com/2016/02/16/the-building-of-the-former-synagogue-will-be-returned-to-the-jewish-community/|title=The building of the former synagogue will be returned to the Jewish community|last=Sukhopleshchenko|first=Kateryna|date=2016-02-16|website=The Odesa Times|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Odessa Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://viknaodessa.od.ua/news/?news=129324|title=Одесская еврейская община готова принять здание Бродской синагоги : Одесса : Новости : Викна-Одесса|website=Викна-Одесса: Художественная интернет-галерея|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Note: Miles per gallon estimates are those provided by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and are the 2008 revision of the original numbers.
* Hybrid access to US HOV lanes varies by US state.  Factors can include total/average [[miles per gallon]] rating from the EPA, type of technology used, and/or date of vehicle registration with the relevant state authorities.  (Several states have begun restricting HOV lane access by hybrid and clean-fuel vehicles due to crowding.)
* '''Traction battery power''' is the amount of power available from the electric portion of the [[powertrain]] without the aid of the [[internal combustion engine]] (ICE).  This is generally limited by the [[traction battery]] rather than the electric motor(s).

== Regular languages ==
[[Regular language]]s are a category of languages (sometimes known as [[Chomsky_hierarchy|Chomsky Type 3]]) which can be matched by a state machine (more specifically, by a [[deterministic finite automaton]]) or, equivalently, by a [[regular expression]]. In particular, a regular language can match constructs like "A follows B", "Either A or B", "A, followed by zero or more instances of B", but cannot match constructs which require consistency between non-adjacent elements, such as "some instances of A followed by the same number of instances of B", and also cannot express the concept of recursive "nesting" ("every A is eventually followed by a matching B"). A classic example of a problem which a regular grammar cannot handle is the question of whether a given string contains correctly-nested parentheses. (This is typically handled by a Chomsky Type 2 grammar, also known as a [[context-free grammar]].)

== Deterministic context-free languages ==
[[Context-free language]]s are a category of languages (sometimes known as [[Chomsky_hierarchy|Chomsky Type 2]]) which can be matched by a sequence of replacement rules, each of which essentially maps each non-terminal element to a sequence of terminal elements and/or other nonterminal elements. Grammars of this type can match anything that can be matched by a [[regular grammar]], and furthermore, can handle the concept of recursive "nesting" ("every A is eventually followed by a matching B"), such as the question of whether a given string contains correctly-nested parentheses. The rules of Context-free grammars are purely local, however, and therefore cannot handle questions that require non-local analysis such as "Does a declaration exist for every variable that is used in a function?". To do so technically would require more a sophisticated grammar, like a Chomsky Type 1 grammar, also known as a [[Context-sensitive grammar]]. However, parser generators for context-free grammars often support the ability for user-written code to introduce limited amounts of context-sensitivity. (For instance, upon encountering a variable declaration, user-written code could save the name and type of the variable into an external data structure, so that these could be checked against later variable references detected by the parser.)

The [[deterministic context-free language]]s are a proper subset of the Context-Free languages which can be efficiently parsed by [[Deterministic pushdown automata]].

The '''Computer Conservation Society''' ('''CCS''') is a British organisation, founded in 1989. It is under the joint umbrella of the [[British Computer Society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bcs.org/category/13184 | title=Computer Conservation Society | publisher=[[British Computer Society]] | accessdate=8 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[London]] [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] and the [[Manchester]] [[Museum of Science and Industry (Manchester)|Museum of Science and Industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://curation.cs.manchester.ac.uk/digital60/www.digital60.org/about/computerconservation/index.html | title=Computer Conservation Society: Aims and Objectives of the Society | work=Digital 60 | publisher=[[University of Manchester]] | location=UK | accessdate=8 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://foldoc.org/Computer%20Conservation%20Society | title=Computer Conservation Society | work=[[FOLDOC]] | accessdate=8 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The CCS is interested in the [[history of computing]] in general and the conservation and preservation of early British historical computers in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| first=Roger | last=Johnson | title=Computer Conservation Society (CCS) – Its Story and Experience | series=[[IFIP]] Advances in Information and Communication Technology book series (IFIPAICT) | volume=416 | work=Making the History of Computing Relevant | pages=249-257 | doi=10.1007/978-3-642-41650-7_22 | publisher=[[Springer (publisher)|Springer]] | isbn=978-3-642-41649-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society runs a series of monthly public lectures between September and May each year in both London and Manchester.  The events are detailed on the society's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.computerconservationsociety.org/lectures/current/lecture.htm | title=Events | publisher=Computer Conservation Society | accessdate=8 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CCS publishes a quarterly journal, '''''Resurrection'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | url=http://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/35062 | title=The CCS Journal – Resurrection | publisher=[[British Computer Society]] | accessdate=8 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | url=http://www.computerconservationsociety.org/resurrection.htm | title=Resurrection – The CCS Journal | publisher=Computer Conservation Society | accessdate=8 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bit-tech.net/news/ccs-turns-25/1/ | title=Computer Conservation Society turns 25 | first=Gareth | last=Halfacree | website=www.bit-tech.net | publisher=[[bit-tech]] | date=15 October 2014 | accessdate=8 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ajovomultja.hu/news/british-computer-conservation-society-25-years-old?language=en | title=The British Computer Conservation Society is 25 years old | website=ajovomultja.hu | date=27 October 2014 | accessdate=8 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr [[Doron Swade]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://blog.plan28.org/2017/01/winter-2016-report-to-computer.html | title=Winter 2016 report to the Computer Conservation Society | website=blog.plan28.org | publisher=Plan 28 Blog | first=Doron | last=Swade | authorlink=Doron Swade | date=20 January 2017 | accessdate=8 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; formerly the curator of the computing collection at the London Science Museum, was a founding committee member.
The current{{when|date=January 2018}} chair of the society is Mr [[David Morriss]]. The immediate past chair was Mrs [[Rachel Burnett]].

The '''deepwater redfish''' (''Sebastes mentella''), also known as the '''beaked redfish''', '''ocean perch''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/154816/0 Iucn Red List]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Atlantic redfish''', '''Norway haddock''', '''red perch''', '''golden redfish''', or '''hemdurgan''', may reach a size of {{convert|55|-|70|cm|in}}, but is usually less than {{convert|45|cm|in}}. It lives in comparatively high concentrations in the [[North Atlantic]], for example in the [[Irminger Sea]] where considerable numbers are fished. It occupies depths between {{convert|300|and|1000|m|ft}} and is often pelagic, i.e. far off the bottom. The deep-sea redfish feeds on a variety of food organisms, for example small fishes. In contrast to most fishes that spawn unfertilised eggs, the deepwater redfish has internal fertilisation and spawns free-living larvae.

''S. mentella'' is very similar in appearance to the [[Acadian redfish]] (''Sebastes fasciatus'').

== Sustainable consumption ==
In 2010, Greenpeace International has added the deepwater redfish to its seafood red list. "The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species Greenpeace International Seafood Red list] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703000000/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species |date=July 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3540">The '''Deutsches Filmarchiv''' ("German Film Archive"), originally the '''Archiv für Filmwissenschaft''' ("Archive for Film Science"), formally established in 1947, was the first [[film archive]] set up in [[West Germany]] after [[World War II]].

==Archiv für Filmwissenschaft (1947-52)==

By the end of the war in 1945, the two greatest existing German film collections, the [[Reichsfilmarchiv]] and the [[Universum Film AG|Ufa-Lehrschau]] ("UFA Educational Viewing"), had been in part destroyed and in part scattered to the four winds. The initiative for the setting up of a new film archive came from [[Hanns Wilhelm Lavies]], who immediately after the war, on his own initiative and without any organisational backing, began intensively collecting films and film-related documentation in [[Berlin]] and the West German zone of occupation. From the beginning of the [[Cold War]] he had the support of the [[United States|American]] occupying authorities.

At first he tried to have his collection, formalised in 1947 as the ''Archiv für Filmwissenschaft'', attached to the photographic collection of [[Marburg University]], but without success. However, with the support of [[Curt Oertel]], Lavies' collection was accepted in 1948 for placement at [[Wiesbaden]], and was moved the following year to [[Schloss Biebrich]]. On 13 April 1949 it was renamed the ''[[Deutsches Filminstitut|Deutsches Institut für Filmkunde]]'' (DIF) ("German Institute for Film Studies"). In 1952 the ''Archiv für Filmwissenschaft'' became a department within the expanded DIF and was renamed the '''Deutsches Filmarchiv''' ("German Film Archive").

==Deutsches Filmarchiv (1952-56)==

Lavies, as the creator of the collection, remained as the head of the new operation, which however he continued to run as his own private endeavour; this brought him into repeated conflict with his funders in the film world. He stayed however until 1 January 1959, by which time most of the underlying organisational problems had been resolved.

As proper storage of the vulnerable archive material and film stock was not possible in the Institute's premises, part of the collection had to be stored offsite in the ''[[Bundesarchiv]]'' ("German Federal Archive"), founded in 1954, and systematic sorting and conservation of the DIF film prints did not start until 1958.

However, the constant disagreements about the Institute's finances and the fact of its support from both the film industry and the public purse, which raised serious questions about the ownership of the collections, led to a split on 29 May 1956 between the DIF and the film archive, which was turned into an association called ''Das Deutsche Filmarchiv'' ("The German Film Archive"),&lt;ref&gt;the difference in name is minimal in both German and English: "The German Film Archive", as opposed to the "German Film Archive"&lt;/ref&gt; under which name it joined the ''Fédération Internationale des Archives du Film'' (FIAF).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5086">The '''Drug Industry Documents Archive''' (DIDA) is a digital archive of [[pharmaceutical industry]] documents created and maintained by the [[University of California, San Francisco]], Library and Center for Knowledge Management.  DIDA is a part of the larger UCSF [[Industry Documents Library]] which includes the [[Truth Tobacco Industry Documents]].  The archive contains documents about pharmaceutical industry [[clinical trials]], publication of study results, pricing, [[marketing]], relations with physicians and drug company involvement in [[continuing medical education]].

Most of the documents on DIDA were made public as a result of lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies [[Parke-Davis]], [[Warner-Lambert]], [[Pfizer]], [[Merck &amp; Co.]], [[Wyeth]] and [[Abbott Labs]], among others.  DIDA was founded in 2005 with the support of a gift by Thomas Greene, the attorney for [[David Franklin (scientist)|David Franklin]], whistleblower in United States ex rel. Franklin v. Parke-Davis, the case from which the first documents in the archive originated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu/drug/about/ | title = About the Project | publisher = Drug Industry Document Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers as well as students, journalists, and the general public, use the archive to investigate the ways pharmaceutical companies market their products.  The [[University of California, San Francisco]] Library created this digital archive in an attempt to facilitate further research into the drug industry's practice of establishing close links with the medical community which has been shown to influence scientific research, drug approval, prescription practices, and ultimately, consumer health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Steinman MA, Bero LA, Chren MM, Landefeld CS | title = Narrative review: The promotion of gabapentin: An analysis of internal industry documents | journal = Ann Intern Med | year = 2006 | volume = 145 | issue = 4 | pages = 284–93 | pmid = 16908919 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-145-4-200608150-00008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.299.15.1800 | title = Guest Authorship and Ghostwriting in Publications Related to Rofecoxib: A Case Study of Industry Documents from Rofecoxib Litigation | year = 2008 | last1 = Ross | first1 = Joseph S. | journal = JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 299 | issue = 15 | pages = 1800–12 | pmid=18413874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''English Botany''''' was a major publication of British plants comprising a 36 volume set, issued in 267 monthly parts over 23 years from 1791 to 1814. The work was conceived, illustrated, edited and published by the botanical illustrator and natural historian, [[James Sowerby]]. The brief, but formal descriptions were mostly supplied by the founder of the [[Linnean Society]], [[Sir James Edward Smith]]. Initially Smith declined to have his name associated with the work as he considered his professional co-operation with a mere artisan such a Sowerby might degrade his standing in higher circles. However, following the phenomenal public success and general acceptance by the professional class of the work he insisted that the title page of the fourth and succeeding volumes include his name. The work, however, continued to be generally referred to as "'''''Sowerby's Botany'''''".

The full title reads; ''English Botany or, Coloured Figures of British Plants, with their Essential Characters, Synonyms and Places of Growth''. The complete work comprises 2,592 hand-coloured, copper-plate engravings, including 3 fold-outs, each with a single page of text. The work is comprehensively indexed with each of the 36 volumes having its own specific set. In September 1814, Sowerby published a comprehensive, 42 page, three-part final index comprising; two indexes with Latin nomenclature (systematical and alphabetical) and an index of the common English names. The final indexes were also sold to non-subscribers as a set that included a six page index to Sowerby's concurrent work ''"Coloured Figures of English Fungi or Mushrooms"'' (1797-1809 with five supplements to 1814) - the supplements not having previously been indexed.

While extensive, the work was not initially intended to be comprehensive; Smith would be the first to set out do such a survey with his first two volumes of ''[[Flora Britannica]]''. However, by the end of the work it had become the most comprehensive, illustrated flora of Great Britain published up to that time. It included the first descriptions and illustrations of many mosses and lichens, a particular passion of both Sowerby and Smith.
  
The descriptions given are accurate and systematic, in the use of [[binomial nomenclature]], with Latin and English description; but a wider audience was intended with digression into general discussion and cultivation. Combined with increased sales of books, and the amateurs and gardeners enthusiasum for botany, the volumes were to become well known. Identification of the plants, in correspondence with the details in the plates, gave the work accuracy and utility beyond that of decorative books and more akin to formal botanical works.

Smith and Sowerby's partnering was not their only one, other early publication of Smith's descriptions with Sowerby plates, included ''Icones pictae plantarum rariorum descriptionibus et observationibus illustratae'' during 1790-93 and [[A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland]], a survey of exotic species found in the new colonies of Australia. 

The illustrations allowed a reader not familiar with botany to identify plants; also, the aesthetic appeal of the vivid hand coloured engravings earned Sowerby much praise. However, Smith was quietly derisive of the ability of images alone to describe a plant. He publicly opined that the graphics needed a formal description and explanation, without which only a 'superficial knowledge' could be gained from the plate. He was justifying to his professional peers, his decision to accept Sowerby's invitation to provide the text. In spite of their class differences, the two men were good friends and happily worked together on several projects over many years.

In 1814 Sowerby was offering the complete work or individual plates without text as follows:

"ENGLISH BOTANY; or, coloured figures of all the plants native of the Empire of Great Britain, by J&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;AMES&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; S&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;OWERBY&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;; with their essential characters, synonyms, and places of growth, to which are added occasional remarks, &amp;c. by  Sir J. E. S&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;MITH&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;, &amp;c. &amp;c. royal octvo. No. 1 to 267, ''£''55 7''s''.;[*] quarto copies of  the coloured ''plates only'', may be had at 1''s''. each plate; also 8vo. copies of the plates only, of any particular class or genus of plants, at 6''d'' each plate."  

Even though printed in runs of up to 900 copies (an extra-ordinarily high number for copper-plate engravings), few complete, first edition sets of the work were actually assembled. This is probably as a result of the high total selling price and a very lengthy period of publication that spanned two major wars and a famine (1805). A full first edition set comprising all 5,416 pages is now a great rarity, with only three essentially complete copies being known for certain to have survived, all of which are in private ownership.  There are numerous extant part-sets, usually comprising little more than the first half to two-thirds of the work. None of the quarto coloured plates is known to have survived.

Sowerby's son, James de Carle Sowerby published two supplements to the original work. The first Supplement, issued from July 1829 to April 1831, comprised 100 new plates numbered 2592 - 2692 together with associated texts. The second Supplement, issued from June 1831 to January 1835, comprised 104 additional plates numbered 2693 - 2796 including two fold-out illustrations. The Supplements were available either coloured or plain but most were sold plain and have long since been lost.   

Later editions of the book were to take advantage of mechanical colour printing, improving the affordability of the book but to the detriment of the image quality already seriously compromised by extensive wear to the original copper plates. The third edition in 1863 saw editor John Boswell alter the text and include a "popular portion". However, it is evident that by this third edition the original plates had already deteriorated to such a degree that many of the original fine supplemental details in the plates had to be erased to be replaced by very low-grade work by James de Carle Sowerby who also often added large, uncoloured outlines of the leaves that further reduced the quality and aesthetics of the plates. Several further editions were subsequently produced by various publishers using cheap materials and low quality methods of reproduction, each seemingly copied from the immediately prior publication thus compounding the deterioration of the images.

 *&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Equivalent to £5,421.30 in 2016 (averaged value over the years 1791 to 1814 - Bank of England Figures)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3691">A '''form''' is a [[document]] with spaces (also named ''fields'' or ''placeholders'') in which to [[writing|write]] or select, for a  series of documents with similar contents. The documents usually have the printed parts in common, except, possibly, for a [[serial number]]. 

Forms, when completed, may be a statement, a request, an [[order (business)|order]], etc.; a [[check (finance)|check]] may be a form. Also there are forms for taxes; filling one in is a duty to have determined how much tax one owes, and/or the form is a request for a refund. See also [[Tax form|Tax return]].

Forms may be filled out in duplicate (or ''triplicate'', meaning three times) when the information gathered on the form needs to be distributed to several departments within an [[organization]]. This can be done using [[carbon paper]].

[[File:Mantelbögen.JPG|thumb|A variety of forms.]]

== History ==
Forms have existed for a significant amount of time, with historians of [[law]] having discovered preprinted legal forms from the early 19th century that greatly simplified the task of drafting [[complaint]]s and various other legal pleadings. It is believed that the form was conceived by mathematician and inventor [[Charles Babbage]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e24VAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA114,M1 ''On the economy of machinery and manufactures'' p114]&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions, like [[California]], many common types of legal pleadings must be submitted on official government forms.

== Advantages ==
Advantages of forms include the following:
* One has to write less (while the printing is almost universally done in some automatic way)
* One is told or reminded what information has to be supplied
* There is [[Wiktionary:uniformity|uniformity]], for convenience in processing
* Information is collected in writing and so can be reexamined later (the form can also include a signature field to allow someone to take responsibility for the accuracy of the information provided). 
* Simpler tasks, such as collecting or distributing data, can be separated in the [[workflow]] from more skilled processes, such as making decisions. Issuing and processing the forms may then be done by less skilled staff, or by a computer. The de-skilled task becomes issuing or completing the appropriate form for the circumstances, and then passing it on to the next step in the [[workflow]]. This might reduce costs and increase the volume of work that can be handled.

A form on a computer allows for conveniently typing in the variable parts (the input data).

== Form structure ==
A blank form is like a usual document, with some outlined parts with spaces. Blank forms are generally not copyrightable in the US.&lt;ref&gt;37 Code of Federal Regulations § 202.1(c) (2006) ("Blank forms, such as time cards, graph paper, account books, diaries, bank checks, scorecards, address books, report forms, order forms and the like, which are designed for recording information and do not in themselves convey information [are not subject to copyright]"); ''see also [[Baker v. Selden]]'', 101 U.S. 99 (1880).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frame and fixed content===
Part of the document that never changes. Usually a frame with title and textual instructions.

===Placeholders===
Boxes or spaces where the user can type to fill in the form.

{{For|the 11th-century ''gesta'' of the bishops of Liège|Heriger of Lobbes|Anselm of Liège}}
The '''''Gesta episcoporum Leodiensium''''' ("Deeds of the Bishops of Liège") is a history of the [[diocese of Liège]] written by the monk [[Gilles of Orval]] between 1247 and 1251.{{sfn|Pixton|1995|p=262}} At about the same time, Gilles also composed an epitome of his history, the ''Gesta episcoporum Leodensium abbreviata''.{{sfn|Pixton|1995|p=262}} It was first edited by Johannes Heller for the [[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]] in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;"Aegidii Aureaevallensis gesta episcoporum Leodiensium", MGH ''Scriptores'', 25 (Frankfurt: 1880), 1–129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilles sought to continue the earlier ''gesta'' of [[Heriger of Lobbes]] and [[Anselm of Liège]] from 1048 down to 1247.{{sfn|De Grieck|2013}} As a historian, he was rather uncritical.{{sfn|De Grieck|2013}} His is the earliest account to mention any children of King [[Zwentibold]].

'''Inequality within immigrant families''' refers to instances in which members of the same family have differing access to resources. Much literature focuses on inequality between families, but inequality often exists within families as well. Though within-family inequality is not unique to immigrant families, the processes of migration and assimilation into American society provide new channels through which such inequality may emerge.

==Legal status==

Immigrants to the United States vary widely in terms of their citizenship status. Some immigrants may lack documentation altogether. An individual’s legal status in the United States determines many of the resources available to him or her. Legal status can thus provide the basis for many inequalities in the home.

===Mixed-status families===

The [[Citizenship Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] guarantees citizenship status to anyone born on United States soil "and subject to the jurisdiction thereof".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Additional amendments to the United States Constitution|url=//en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Additional_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution&amp;oldid=3509776|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that, regardless of parents' citizenship status, their children who are born in the United States are full citizens and are eligible for the rights and privileges that such status confers; this is called a mixed immigrant status family. Thus, within mixed-status families are a range of documentation patterns involving siblings: some born in the U.S. with birthright citizenship, some in the process of attempting to obtain documentation, and some fully undocumented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.urban.org/research/publication/all-under-one-roof-mixed-status-families-era-reform|title=All Under One Roof: Mixed-Status Families in an Era of Reform|website=www.urban.org|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. immigration policies shape the opportunities for 16.6 million mixed immigrant families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dreby|first=Joanna|date=2012-08-01|title=The Burden of Deportation on Children in Mexican Immigrant Families|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2012.00989.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|language=en|volume=74|issue=4|pages=829–845|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2012.00989.x|issn=1741-3737}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiences of mixed immigrant status families need to be in sharper focus, especially the effects on children growing up in these families. There are an estimated 5.5 million children with unauthorized immigrant parents, about three-quarters of whom are U.S. born citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chaudry|first=Ajay|date=February 2010|title=Facing Our Future: Children in the Aftermath of Immigration Enforcement|url=|journal=The Urban Institute|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of immigration policy dehumanizes individuals in mixed status families through practices that threat and harm, such as deportation procedures, which is when a migrant is formally removed from the United States and is banned from reentering. Immigration policies and practices do not only affect the undocumented population itself. However, U.S. born children growing up in families where there are undocumented members living are negatively impacted by these policies.

Children living in mixed immigration status households live with fear of deportation threats of parents or themselves. They often feel scared, sad and worried about possible separation. This can be traumatic and have negative effects on the children’s well-being. As a result, children may interpret their reality as depriving and cruel. They may process their experiences with a consciousness that mirrors that of their undocumented parents, even though many are U.S. born citizens with all of the benefits rights, and privileges that U.S. citizenship carries.

Immigrant children—defined as those children under age eighteen who are either foreign-born or U.S.-born to immigrant parents—now account for one-fourth of the nation’s 75 million children. By 2050 they are projected to make up one-third of more than 100 million U.S. children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Passel|first=Jeffrey S.|date=2011-01-01|title=Demography of immigrant youth: past, present, and future|journal=The Future of Children / Center for the Future of Children, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation|volume=21|issue=1|pages=19–41|issn=1054-8289|pmid=21465854|doi=10.1353/foc.2011.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This highlights that children of immigrants in mixed status families are growing in the United States. Therefore, it is of high importance to understand their experiences in this country and the impact that a mixed status has on the children growing up in these families facing unique needs and challenges. Mixed immigrant families’ rights are being violated. When there is family separation through immigration practices, children in mixed status household are denied the right to grow up with their families. They are dehumanized, based on status of their parents.

Legal status can thus lead to a restructuring of traditional family roles. Family members who may have previously been the primary breadwinners in the country of origin may be unable to find gainful employment due to their undocumented status.&lt;ref name="HondagneuSotelo2001"&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Pierrette |last1=Hondagneu-Sotelo | title = Domestica: Immigrant Workers Cleaning &amp; Caring in the Shadows of Affluence | year = 2001 | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley and Los Angeles, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family members who are legal citizens and thus have access to a wider range of employment opportunities may therefore hold a greater measure of power within the family. When these family members are children, who might traditionally be expected to defer to their elders, such an imbalance in legal status may create an upheaval in the traditional familial relations.

Such unequal access to resources can create a power imbalance between family members who have citizenship status and those who do not. An individual’s legal status may be used to keep him or her subjugated within the home and, in extreme cases, may prevent him or her from leaving an abusive situation.&lt;ref name="HassDuttonOrloff2000"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Lifetime prevalence of violence against Latina immigrants: Legal and policy implications |year=2000 |last1=Hass |first1=Giselle Aguilar |last2=Dutton |first2=Mary-Ann |last3=Orloff |first3=Leslye E. |journal=International Review of Victimology |volume=7  |pages=93–113 |doi= 10.1177/026975800000700306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MenjivarSalcido2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1177/089124302237894 |title= Immigrant Women and Domestic Violence: Common Experiences in Different Countries |year=2002 |last1=Menjivar |first1=Cecilia Aguilar |last2=Salcido |first2=Olivia |journal=Gender &amp; Society |volume=16 |pages=898–920 |issue= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to resources===

Individuals who hold legal status in the United States enjoy many advantages over those who do not. Differences in legal status are also associated with differing access to various resources such as employment opportunities, as well as a host of social benefits.  In addition, children in mixed-status families are at-risk and precisely the types of clients targeted by many social services, social workers, and public health organizations. For example, Hispanics in general are less likely to be insured, within the pan-ethnic Hispanic population, immigrants without legal authorization are less likely to have employer coverage and are currently excluded from purchasing coverage from the federal exchange in the Affordable Care Act.

====Employment opportunities====

Even when undocumented individuals are employed, their positions are often precarious. Approximately 40% of immigrant workers in low-wage jobs are undocumented.&lt;ref name="CappsFixPassel2003"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A profile of the low-wage immigrant workforce |year=2003 |last1=Capps |first1=R. |last2=Fix |first2=M. |last3=Passel |first3=J.S. |journal=Immigrant families and workers: Facts and perspectives |volume=4|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NightingaleFix2004"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Economic and Labor Market Trends |year=2004 |last1=Nightingale |first1=Demetra Smith |last2=Fix |first2=Michael |journal=The Future of Children |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=49–59 |doi=10.2307/1602793}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lack of formal documentation means that many of these individuals must find work in the informal economy where there is a lack of protection for worker rights.&lt;ref name="HondagneuSotelo2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HondagneuSotelo1997"&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Pierrette |last1=Hondagneu-Sotelo |editor1= Elizabeth Higginbotham |editor2= Mary Romero | title = Women and Work: Race, Class, and Ethnicity: Toward the Integration of Legal Status in Frameworks of Race, Class, and Gender | year = 1997 | publisher = Sage | location = Beverly Hills, California | pages = 101–125 | chapter = Working "without papers" in the U.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undocumented workers may have difficulty obtaining justice in cases of mistreatment since employers can easily threaten them with deportation.&lt;ref name="HondagneuSotelo2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HondagneuSotelo1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Colen1989"&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Shellee |last1=Colen |editor1= Elsa M. Chaney |editor2= Mary Garcia Castro | title = Muchachas No More: Household Workers in Latin America and the Caribbean | year = 1989 | publisher = Temple University Press | location = Philadelphia, Pennsylvania | pages = 171–94 | chapter = "Just a Little Respect": West Indian Domestic Workers in Latin America and the Caribbean}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leaves these immigrant workers vulnerable to exploitation. Exploitation may take many forms, one of these being [[wage theft]]. While there are regulations to protect the rights of workers, such as laws that cover private domestic work, these policies are often underutilized since workers may be unaware of their existence.&lt;ref name="HondagneuSotelo2001"/&gt; Individuals who lack formal documentation may also feel less empowered to seek legal recourse because of fear of having their undocumented status made known.

Family members with legal status are more likely to have access to jobs with higher pay and benefits. [[Second generation immigrants in the United States]], who are most likely full citizens, tend to have higher earnings and are less likely to be in poverty than first generation immigrants, some of whom lack formal legal status.&lt;ref name="NationsForeignBornPopulation2010"&gt;"Nation's Foreign-Born Population Nears 37 Million". Press Release. U.S. Census Bureau. October 19, 2010.  https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/foreignborn_population/cb10-159.html{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (accessed March 2, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the unequal access to employment opportunities can generate inequality among family members of different legal statuses.

====Social benefits====

Citizens of the United States are entitled to a host of social benefits. Government programs such as Food Stamps and Medicaid can provide support for low-income families. However, children who are U.S. citizens may not always be able to fully enjoy these benefits.&lt;ref name="ShieldsBehrman2004"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Children of Immigrant Families: Analysis and Recommendations |year=2004 |last1=Shields |first1=Margie K. |last2=Behrman |first2=Richard E. |journal=The Future of Children |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=4–16 |doi=10.2307/1602791}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigrant parents with limited English language ability may be unaware they are eligible for such benefits, or may not know how to take advantage of social welfare programs.&lt;ref name="NightingaleFix2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShieldsBehrman2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GreenbergLevinEpsteinHutson2002"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The 1996 welfare law: Key elements and reauthorization issues affecting children |year=2002 |last1=Greenberg |first1=M. |last2=Levin-Epstein |first2=J. |last3=Hutson |first3=R. |journal=The Future of Children: Children and Welfare Reform |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=27–57|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even legal non-citizens may find that their access to social supports is restricted due to welfare reforms.&lt;ref name="NightingaleFix2004"/&gt; In addition, parents who are undocumented may be afraid to deal with government agencies, even if their citizen children are eligible for such assistance programs.&lt;ref name="ShieldsBehrman2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GreenbergLevinEpsteinHutson2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GreenbergRahnamou2004"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Four Commentaries: Looking to the Future |year=2004 |last1=Greenberg |first1=Mark |last2=Rahmanou |first2=Hedieh |journal=The Future of Children |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=139–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hernandez2004"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Demographic Change and the Life Circumstances of Immigrant Families |year=2004 |last1=Hernandez |first1=Donald J. |journal=The Future of Children |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=16–47 |doi= 10.2307/1602792}}&lt;/ref&gt; When there is risk of deportation, it affects the likelihood of a mixed-status mother's use social services. The anti-immigrant sentiment increases this and then would deter mixed-status mothers to not to participate in government programs in which their U.S. born children are eligible to receive.

====Health care====
{{further information|Immigrant health care in the United States}}
Undocumented immigrants in mixed status families tend to work in jobs that do not provide employee based health insurance and/or employed in occupations that pay off the books. Moreover, we can also expect that poor noncitizen children whose parents lack job-based coverage have lower rates of participation than poor citizen children of U.S. citizens. The lack of insurance for citizen children in mixed-status families means that these children are less likely to receive timely care for acute conditions, and less likely to have their chronic conditions diagnosed and appropriately managed.

==Gender==

Inequality in the family may occur along gender lines.  This is not an issue unique to immigrant families. In many cultures around the world, men have traditionally held more power than women. Among families in the United States alone, [[gender inequality]] often exists, which is evident in the unequal sharing of household labor.&lt;ref name=Coltrane2000&gt;{{cite journal |title= Research on Household Labor: Modeling and Measuring the Social Embeddedness of Routine Family work |year=2000 |last1=Coltrane |first1=Scott |journal=Journal of Marriage and Family |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=1208–1233 |doi= 10.1111/j.1741-3737.2000.01208.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hochschild1989"&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Arlie |last1=Hochschild | title = The Second Shift | year = 1989 | publisher = Avon Books | location = New York, New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of immigration entails a move to a new country, whose culture may have values that differ greatly from those of the home culture. In this transition from one geographical and social context to another, new forms of gender inequality can arise.

===Shifts in gender roles===

The United States prides itself on being a society that supports [[gender equality]]. While, in reality, much gender inequality persists, there are indeed laws in place to protect the equal rights of everyone, regardless of gender. Depending on the home country, U.S. society may contain a much higher level of gender equality than immigrants are accustomed to, particularly if immigrants come from a traditionally patriarchal society.&lt;ref name="KibriaTheFamilyTightrope1993"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Nazli |last=Kibria | title = Family Tightrope | year = 1993 | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, New Jersey | pages = 108–143 | chapter = The Family Tightrope}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ThaiGlobalizationasaGenderStrategy2008"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Hung Cam |last=Thai | title = For Better or For Worse: Vietnamese International Marriages in the New Global Economy | year = 2008 | publisher = Rutgers University Press | location = New Brunswick, New Jersey | pages = 51–66 | chapter = Globalization as a Gender Strategy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disparity in gender norms between different cultures may cause gender roles in the family to shift.

Immigrants may find that they are a part of a lower socioeconomic status group in the United States than they were in their home country. Immigration research shows that it is rarely the poorest citizens of the sending countries that immigrate to the United States, simply because they cannot afford the associated costs.&lt;ref name="HondagneuSotelo2001"/&gt; This is particularly true when they come from countries where the cost of living is not as high as in the United States. Individuals who may have held professional occupations in their country of origin may find themselves in low-paying jobs if their certifications are not recognized by the United States. When families migrate to the United States from a country with a patriarchal society, men in particular may experience a loss of status.&lt;ref name="KibriaTheFamilyTightrope1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ThaiGlobalizationasaGenderStrategy2008"/&gt;

While women are also affected by the family's loss of status, they may simultaneously experience a boost in their own status relative to men because of the greater gender equality present in American society.&lt;ref name="KibriaTheFamilyTightrope1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ThaiGlobalizationasaGenderStrategy2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Espiritu1999"&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Yen Le |last1=Espiritu |editor1= Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo | title = Gender and U.S. Immigration: Contemporary Trends | year = 1999 | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley and Los Angeles, California | pages = 81–100 | chapter = Gender and Labor in Asian Immigrant Families}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men, who may have been accustomed to filling the role of sole "breadwinner" in their home country may find themselves unable to do so in the United States. This is due both to restricted access to jobs and to prevalence of new immigrants in the low-wage sector. Immigrants in these jobs are unlikely to be able to support their entire families solely on their earnings.&lt;ref name="KibriaTheFamilyTightrope1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ThaiGlobalizationasaGenderStrategy2008"/&gt; The increase in the number of female-dominated industries in the United States means that there are often more employment options for women in the low-wage sector than for men.&lt;ref name="Espiritu1999"/&gt; If women begin to take a more active role in financially providing for their family, this is generally accompanied by enhanced status within the family.&lt;ref name="Espiritu1999"/&gt;

===Domestic violence===

While the rate of domestic violence among immigrant groups does not differ from that of the general population, immigrant victims of domestic violence may face additional challenges. While victims can be of either gender, women may be especially vulnerable.&lt;ref name="MenjivarSalcido2002"/&gt; The process of immigrating to another country and adjusting to American culture can be stressful, increasing the likelihood of domestic violence.&lt;ref name="PerillaBakemanNorris1994"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Culture and domestic violence: The ecology of abused Latinas |year=1994 |last1=Perilla |first1=Julia |last2=Bakeman |first2=Roger |last3=Norris |first3=Fran H. |journal=Violence and Victims |volume=9 |issue=4  |pages=325–339 |pmid= 7577760}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors such as limited English language ability, legal status, and lack of social ties may create additional barriers for those trying to escape such situations.&lt;ref name="MenjivarSalcido2002"/&gt; Even when a woman does have access to social services that could help her escape an abusive situation, cultural norms may make it difficult for her to leave. If a woman decides to leave an abusive spouse she may run the risk of social ostracism and of bringing shame to her family.&lt;ref name="MenjivarSalcido2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nah1993"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Perceived problems and service delivery for Korean immigrants |year=1993 |last1=Nah |first1=Kyung-Hee |journal=Social Work |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=289–296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a woman may choose to stay and suffer abuse rather than face the social consequences of leaving her husband.

On the other hand, some individuals may actually find it easier to escape situations of abuse in the United States than they would have in their countries of origin. Among some immigrants there is much criticism of the way in which women in particular have been changed by American culture. Women may be seen as too Americanized because of the way they dress or their lack of deference to men.&lt;ref name="ThaiGlobalizationasaGenderStrategy2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BurielDeMent1993"&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Raymond |last1=Buriel |first2=Terri |last2=De Ment |editor1= Alan Booth |editor2= Ann C. Crouter |editor3= Nancy Landale | title = Immigration and the Family: Research and Policy on U.S. Immigrants | year = 1997 | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates | location = Mahwah, New Jersey | pages = 165–200 | chapter = Immigration and Sociocultural Change in Mexican, Chinese, and Vietnamese American Families}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general support for gender equality within American society can undermine traditional power hierarchies within the family in which men had control over the actions of women. One of the ways that such power is undermined is through the presence of laws against domestic violence. In some patriarchal societies, husbands may have complete control over their wives, including control over their bodies.&lt;ref name="KibriaTheFamilyTightrope1993"/&gt; U.S. laws do not support this sort of arrangement and women who are aware of their rights can utilize formal legal institutions to combat such gender imbalances within the family. The ability of government authorities to intervene in the realm of the family can undermine the traditional power balance and leave men feeling dispossessed.&lt;ref name="KibriaTheFamilyTightrope1993"/&gt;

===Relationships across national borders===

Families do not always immigrate as one unit. Given the various legal and economical factors associated with transnational migration, certain family members may find it easier to immigrate to the United States than others.&lt;ref name="HondagneuSoteloAvila1997"&gt;{{cite journal |title= "I'm Here, But I'm There": The Meanings of Latina Transnational Motherhood |year=1997 |last1=Hondagneu-Sotelo |first1=Pierrette |last2=Avila |first2= Ernestine |journal=Gender and Society |volume=11 |pages=548–571 |doi= 10.1177/089124397011005003 |issue= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, individuals may immigrate to the United States as an employment strategy, with no intention of permanently relocating their family to the U.S.&lt;ref name="HondagneuSoteloAvila1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyner1999"&gt;{{Cite book |first1=James A. |last1=Tyner |editor1= Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo | title = Gender and U.S. Immigration: Contemporary Trends | year = 1999 | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley and Los Angeles, California | pages = 63–80 | chapter = The Global Context of Gendered Labor Migration from the Philippines to the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution of family members across national borders can generate unique forms of inequality within the families of immigrants.

====Global relationships as a strategy to uphold gender roles====

Some immigrants, particularly those from cultures in which women are subordinate to men, may express disapproval about the influence of American culture on girls and women.&lt;ref name="BurielDeMent1993"/&gt; Men in particular may perceive women from their own cultural heritage who have assimilated into American society as too "independent"&lt;ref name="ThaiGlobalizationasaGenderStrategy2008"/&gt;  and thus incompatible with the traditional family structures that such men may wish to uphold. This may cause men to seek out spouses from their home countries, believing these women will be more willing to take on the traditional household duties of a wife.&lt;ref name="ThaiGlobalizationasaGenderStrategy2008"/&gt; When these women come to the United States they may experience isolation, particularly if they do not have family members or friends already in the U.S.&lt;ref name="MenjivarSalcido2002"/&gt; In such instances, men often control women's access to outside resources and support systems, creating a power imbalance within the home. In instances of domestic violence, this isolation may make it difficult for women to find the help they need.&lt;ref name="MenjivarSalcido2002"/&gt;

====Transnational families====

Migration is often used as an employment strategy.&lt;ref name="HondagneuSoteloAvila1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyner1999"/&gt; Although many individuals choose to migrate permanently to another country, others may migrate on a more temporary basis or do so seasonally. When families do not all migrate together, they must negotiate family relationships across national borders. Which family members migrate and which stay behind can be important determinants of how inequality may manifest itself in these transnational families. Among families from Latin American countries, it is often the case that men will travel abroad to work. This means that the women in these families do the bulk of the day-to-day caring for the family.&lt;ref name="HondagneuSoteloAvila1997"/&gt;

In more recent years, scholars have noted a shift in the demographics of migrant workers. Particularly in Asian countries, but also in Latin American countries, a growing number of women are traveling abroad for jobs as domestic and service workers.&lt;ref name="HondagneuSotelo2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyner1999"/&gt; In many of these cases, women take on jobs caring for the children of families in wealthier nations, while leaving their own children in the country of origin.&lt;ref name="HondagneuSotelo2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HondagneuSoteloAvila1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyner1999"/&gt; This can mean that their own children are not well-cared for and may suffer as a result.

===Distribution of household labor===

Although women may take a greater role in providing for the family financially, this does not always mean that men take on a greater share of the housework. Studies on Taiwanese and Korean immigrants in New York found that the distribution of household labor in the home varied with class. In general, husbands in families belonging to the professional class were more likely to take on household work than in those belonging to the working class.&lt;ref name="Espiritu1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chen1992"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Hsiang-Shui |last=Chen | title = Chinatown no more: Taiwan immigrants in contemporary New York | year = 1992 | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Min1998"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Pyong Gap |last=Min | title = Changes and conflict: Korean immigrant families in New York | year = 1998 | publisher = Allyn &amp; Bacon | location = Needham Heights, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Chicano families belonging to the professional class, a study found that husbands took on an even greater share of the household labor when compared to professional-class families from other ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="Pesquera1993"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Beatriz M. |last=Pesquera |editor1= A. de la Torre |editor2= Beatriz M. Pesquera | title = Building with our hands: New directions in Chicana studies | year = 1993 | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley and Los Angeles, California | pages = 181–195 | chapter = "In the beginning he wouldn't lift a spoon": The division of household labor}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies found, however, that even among immigrant families in the professional class, wives still did the bulk of the work.&lt;ref name="Chen1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Min1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pesquera1993"/&gt; Among many Vietnamese immigrant families, reproductive labor is still seen as the responsibility of women.&lt;ref name="KibriaTheFamilyTightrope1993"/&gt; In the United States, the scope of this household work is expanded to include dealing with larger institutions like schools, utility companies, and the health-care system. Women may also take over the task of finding housing and dealing with landlords. Language barriers and the threat of feeling powerless may lead men to avoid interactions with such bureaucracies, leaving the job of navigating these complex systems to women. This results in women having superior knowledge of the workings of such systems. Among Vietnamese immigrants, women are often thought of as experts on health-care, and men may defer to women since they have more knowledge of how the health-care system operates.&lt;ref name="KibriaTheFamilyTightrope1993"/&gt; In the case of Vietnamese immigrants, although women were still expected to take responsibility for a disproportionate amount of household-related labor, the change in the nature of such labor gives them the skills and the confidence to know how to deal with societal institutions.&lt;ref name="KibriaTheFamilyTightrope1993"/&gt;  This knowledge provides women with a certain amount of leverage within the household and provides them with a greater amount of social and [[cultural capital]] relative to men.

==Generation==

Inequality may exist between members of different generations within a family. Assimilation into American society may create changes in the traditional family structure, particularly among immigrants who come from cultures in which age is a strong determinant of status and power. American culture places a high value on individuality. The high importance placed on self-determination in American culture may go against the traditional values of cultures in which children are expected to obey and respect the wishes of their parents in all facets of their lives.&lt;ref name=Pyke2005&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0192513X04273578 |title="Generational Deserters" and "Black Sheep": Acculturative Differences Among Siblings in Asian Immigrant Families |year=2005 |last1=Pyke |first1=Karen |journal=Journal of Family Issues |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=491–517}}&lt;/ref&gt; The migration process is often stressful and can lead to conflicts between family members, particularly those of different generations.&lt;ref name="KibriaGenerationGaps1993"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Nazli |last=Kibria | title = Family Tightrope | year = 1993 | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, New Jersey | pages = 144–166 | chapter = Generation Gaps}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degree of assimilation===

Among many immigrant families, members of the younger generation tend to assimilate to American culture at a faster rate than members of older generations.&lt;ref name="KibriaGenerationGaps1993"/&gt; This can create divides along generational lines. Members of the older generation may dislike the influence that American culture has on the younger generation, particularly shifts from communal values to a more individualistic mindset.&lt;ref name="KibriaGenerationGaps1993"/&gt; On the other hand, members of the younger generation may view their elders as too set in their ways and out of touch with American society.&lt;ref name="KibriaGenerationGaps1993"/&gt; Such sentiments can lead to conflict between family members. Points of contention include clothing, speech, displaying respect for elders, and dating practices.

Family members who identify more with the culture of their home country may experience frustration when they attempt to instill their cultural values into younger family members. Popular media, schools, and peers act as powerful socializing agents and members of the older generation may feel that they cannot compete with these pervasive cultural and social forces. Parents may blame television and magazines for the unwanted change they see in their children and if they decide to act by cracking down on their children's access to popular media, this may lead to further generational schisms.&lt;ref name="KibriaGenerationGaps1993"/&gt;

These divides can also occur between members of the same generation, particularly between older siblings who may identify more strongly with their home country and younger siblings who may identify more with American culture. This is especially likely to occur when older siblings belong to the [[1.5 generation]], meaning that they were born abroad, and younger siblings were born in the United States.&lt;ref name=Pyke2005/&gt; In many societies, older siblings are given greater responsibilities and may feel more pressure from parents to set a good example for their younger siblings by performing well in school and obtaining success. At the same time, this greater responsibility often affords older siblings a greater degree of power within the family. Older siblings may therefore also be more likely to uphold their parents' traditional values because of the power it affords them within the family.&lt;ref name=Pyke2005/&gt; In America's more egalitarian culture, power hierarchies based on age are less likely to be accepted. Younger siblings may therefore reject the authority of their older siblings, fostering tensions within the family. The migration process can therefore destabilize traditional power hierarchies within the family based on age and in some cases may lead to a reversal of such hierarchies.&lt;ref name=Pyke2005/&gt; Regardless of whether tension exists among members of different generations or members of the same generation, degree of assimilation may pave the way for divisions within the family.

====Language proficiency====

In many immigrant families, members of the younger generation have greater English language proficiency than their elders.&lt;ref name="KibriaGenerationGaps1993"/&gt; In families where parents may know little to no English, children may act as interpreters. Young children may therefore be involved in important family matters, including finances. In cases where children are in charge of paying bills, they may be in a position to take a portion of their parents' money for their own use.&lt;ref name="KibriaGenerationGaps1993"/&gt; Even when this is not the case, the role of interpreter gives a particular family member a certain measure of control over other family members who are unable to communicate as well in English.

====Cultural capital====

An interesting aspect of cultural capital that sometimes comes into play in immigrant families is familiarity with American laws. Parents may find that U.S. law is in conflict with their traditional means of disciplining their children. While parents may be accustomed to certain parental rights in their home country, these rights may not be protected in American society. There may be cases in which outside agents—either school officials, police officers, or government officials—become involved in conflicts between parents and children.&lt;ref name="KibriaGenerationGaps1993"/&gt; This is particularly true in cases of alleged physical abuse. Children, who may be more familiar with American laws, can use this knowledge to gain assistance from individuals outside of the family.&lt;ref name="KibriaGenerationGaps1993"/&gt; The involvement of outside agents may tip the traditional power balance within the family and affords family members who are more familiar with the rules and norms of the United States a certain degree of power over family members who are not as familiar with these laws. Among immigrants who come from cultures with strict hierarchies based on age, such interventions can be devastating to parents who may feel that their authority has been undermined. Family members who are better assimilated into American culture are more able, and probably more likely, to utilize their knowledge of American laws to change the dynamics of family relations. This generates inequality based on degree of assimilation since those who are less assimilated are more likely to lose face as the result of the penetration of such laws into the traditionally private domain of the family.&lt;ref name="KibriaGenerationGaps1993"/&gt;

==== Duality of exclusion ====
Nichollas Walter in his study of youth immigrants reveal that the young immigrants constantly encounters the duality of exclusion and inclusion in their life. They often define themselves as Americans because their philosophies and mindsets are no different from other contemporary Americans. However, at the same time, they feel excluded in real life because they cannot easily debunk their undocumented immigrant status{{please clarify|reason="debunk their undocumented immigrant status" = "prove that they are in fact documented, i.e., rebut the stereotype of their being allegedly undocumented" or "debunk stereotypes associated with their undocumented status"?|date=February 2017}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gonzalez|first=Marc-Tizoc|title=Critical Ethnic Legal Histories: Unearthing the Interracial Justice of Filipino American Agriculture Labor Organizing|journal=UC Irvine Law Review|volume=3 | pages = 991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicholls|first=Walter|title=From Political Opportunities To Niche-Openings: The Dilemmas Of Mobilizing For Immigrant Rights In Inhospitable Environments|journal=Theory &amp; Society|volume=43| pages = 23|doi=10.1007/s11186-013-9208-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This experience often hampers a stable formation of identity among these young second-generations. Consequently, due to their discouraging youth period, these young immigrants are often discouraged to participate in the politics even after they gained appropriate legal status for residency in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicholls|first=Walter J.|last2=Fiorito|first2=Tara|title=Dreamers Unbound: Immigrant Youth Mobilizing|journal=New Labor Forum|publisher=Sage Publications Inc.|volume=24| pages = 86–92|doi=10.1177/1095796014562234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, there have been #DREAMers online movements on different social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. In fact, social media has become a key tool for the younger immigrant population in their process of assimilating into the U.S. society. By publicly sharing their narratives as undocumented immigrants, these young immigrants could successfully increase their political representation and solidify a sense of personal identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ebert|first=Kim|last2=Okamoto|first2=Dina G.|title=Social Citizenship, Integration And Collective Action: Immigrant Civic Engagement In The United States|journal=Social Forces|volume=91| pages = 1267–1292|doi=10.1093/sf/sot009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social mobility and resources===

Parents may feel that their authority over their children is weakened because there are greater resources available in the United States and children are thus less dependent upon their parents for financial support. Some parents believe that children's greater independence also makes them less likely to heed parent's teachings and advice.&lt;ref name="KibriaGenerationGaps1993"/&gt; In particular, children in immigrant families may have greater access to education and work opportunities. These, in turn, can help facilitate social mobility, raising the socioeconomic status of subsequent generations of immigrants relative to first generation immigrants (see [[Second generation immigrants in the United States]]).

====Education====

In many immigrants' countries of origin, education is not free. Children therefore rely on their parents for the fees necessary to obtain an education.&lt;ref name="KibriaGenerationGaps1993"/&gt;  In some cases, this means that children are unable to complete their education because their parents are unable to pay the school fees or would rather invest that money someplace else, perhaps in another child's education. Girls, in particular, may be unlikely to complete their education because of many cultures' preference for boys.&lt;ref name="BanerjeeDuflo2011"&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Abhijit |last1=Banerjee |first2=Esther |last2=Duflo| title = Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty | year = 2011 | publisher = PublicAffairs | location = New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; After immigrating to the United States, all children have access to free education through high school, and can apply for scholarships to help fund a college education as well. While parental contributions are still important, especially in the case of college tuition, this removes many of the barriers to educational achievement and also means that parents no longer have as much control over their children's access to educational opportunities.&lt;ref name="KibriaGenerationGaps1993"/&gt;

Among some immigrant groups, especially those who come from origin countries in which education is not free or widely available, first-generation immigrants may have had little formal schooling.&lt;ref name="ShieldsBehrman2004"/&gt; Immigrant parents tend to have lower levels of formal schooling than U.S.-born parents.&lt;ref name="ShieldsBehrman2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hernandez2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PlunkettBamacaGomez2003"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Relationship Between Parenting, Acculturation, and Adolescent Academics in Mexican-Origin Immigrant Families in Los Angeles |year=2003 |last1=Plunkett |first1=Scott W. |last2=Bamaca-Gomez |first2=Mayra Y. |journal=Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=222–239 |doi=10.1177/0739986303025002005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low levels of education among parents can have a negative impact on their children's ability to succeed in school.&lt;ref name="ShieldsBehrman2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hernandez2004"/&gt; On the other hand, the effort that these immigrant parents put into trying to help their children do well in school can have a significant impact on the academic achievement of students.&lt;ref name="PlunkettBamacaGomez2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ArellanoPadilla1996"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Academic invulnerability among a select group of Latino university students |year=1996 |last1=Arellano |first1=A.R. |last2=Padella |first2=A. |journal=Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences |volume=18 |pages=485–507 |doi=10.1177/07399863960184004 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents thus have some measure of control over the likelihood that their children will succeed in school. If children perceive their parents as supportive, they will be more likely to do well in their academic endeavors, regardless of the practical help their parents are actually able to provide.&lt;ref name="PlunkettBamacaGomez2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ArellanoPadilla1996"/&gt; If parents are not invested in their children's success in school—or if they create barriers to children's education by asking children to work rather than attend school—this lack of emotional support can have a negative impact on children's likelihood of educational success.&lt;ref name="PlunkettBamacaGomez2003"/&gt;

Children who were born before the family immigrated to the United States may have more difficulty succeeding academically than children who were born after the move to the United States, or who were very young at the time of immigration.&lt;ref name="OkagakiFrenschGordon1995"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Encouraging school achievement in Mexican American children |year=1995 |last1=Okagaki |first1=L. |last2=Frensch |first2=P.A. |last3=Gordon |first3=E.W. |journal=Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences |volume=17 |pages=160–179 |doi=10.1177/07399863950172002 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely due to the fact children who were born in the United States, or immigrated at a very early age, are more likely to be assimilated into American culture and to possess greater levels of English language ability than children who were born before the family immigrated. Other research confirms the fact that second generation groups tend to have higher levels of academic achievement than first generation groups.&lt;ref name="KasinitzMollenkopfWaters2002"&gt;{{cite journal  |title=Becoming American/Becoming New Yorkers: Immigrant Incorporation in a Majority Minority City |year=2002 |last1=Kasinitz |first1=Philip |last2=Mollenkopf |first2=John |last3=Waters |first3=Mary C. |journal=International Migration Review |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=1020–1036 |doi=10.1111/j.1747-7379.2002.tb00116.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Employment opportunities====

First generation immigrants may be more likely to hold "ethnic 'niche' occupations" as well as occupations in low-wage sectors.&lt;ref name="KasinitzMollenkopfWaters2002"/&gt; This occupational concentration provides few opportunities for advancement beyond relatively low-wage service-sector jobs. The employment opportunities available to immigrants are often dependent on their English language proficiency. Recent immigrants are less likely to be fluent in English which may only give them access to low-wage jobs where English proficiency is not as important.&lt;ref name="MenjivarSalcido2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nah1993"/&gt; Recent immigrants are thus overrepresented in low-wage occupations.&lt;ref name="NightingaleFix2004"/&gt; Subsequent generations, however, are less likely to be so occupationally concentrated by ethnicity and nationality. Members of later generations generally have access to a wider range of jobs which provide them with greater opportunities for upward social mobility.&lt;ref name="KasinitzMollenkopfWaters2002"/&gt;

'''Kapre''' is a [[Philippines|Philippine]] mythical creature that could be characterized as a tree giant. It is described as being a tall (7 to 9&amp;nbsp;ft), big, black, hairy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jocano|first1=F. Landa|title=The Hiligaynon: An Ethnography of Family and Community Life in Western Bisayas Region|publisher=Asian Center, University of the Philippines|pages=254|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=DZEbAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=23 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; muscular creature. Kapres are normally described as having a strong smell that would attract human attention.

==Origins==
[[File:Carta Hydrographica y Chorographica de la Yslas Filipinas MANILA, 1734 - Detail, Cafres.jpg|thumb|Detail of ''Carta Hydrographica y Chorographica de la Yslas Filipinas'' (1734) by [[Pedro Murillo Velarde]] showing the [[Aeta people]] as "Cafres"]]
The term kapre comes from the Arabic "[[kafir]]" (Spanish ''[[wikt:cafre|cafre]]''),&lt;ref name="eberhart"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eberhart|first1=George M.|title=Mysterious Creatures: A Guide to Cryptozoology|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576072837|pages=266|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=z9gMsCUtCZUC&amp;pg=PA266|accessdate=23 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning a non-believer in Islam (usually referring to [[Slavery in Africa|African slaves]]). The term was later brought to the Philippines by the Spanish who had previous contact with the Moors, they used it to describe the indigenous [[Negrito]] ethnic groups with dark skin and features similar to [[Black people|Black Africans]]. This is also evident in the fact that a synonym for kapre is '''agtà''', another name for the [[Aeta people]]. The modern mythical characterizations of the kapre evolved from formerly [[racism|racist]] portrayals of Negrito tribes by the lowland Christianized ethnic groups of the Philippines during the Spanish period.&lt;ref name="tan"&gt;{{cite book|author= Michael L. Tan|title =Revisiting Usog, Pasma, Kulam|publisher =UP Press|year =2008|page=66|isbn =9789715425704|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=EktzHrfup1UC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''cafre'' was also used for [[Papuan people|Papuan]] slaves brought to the Philippines by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] before slavery was abolished by Spain.&lt;ref name="blument"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blumentritt |first1=Ferdinand |title=List of the native tribes of the Philippines and of the languages spoken by them. By Prof. Ferdinand Blumentritt. |date=1890 |url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/philamer/AJZ8102.0001.001?rgn=main;view=toc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural habitat and attire==
Kapres are said to dwell in big trees like [[acacia]]s, [[mango]]es, [[bamboo]] and [[banyan]] (known in the Philippines as ''balete''). It is also mostly seen sitting under those trees. The Kapre is said to wear the indigenous Northern Philippine loincloth known as ''[[bahag (garment)|bahag]]'', and according to some, often wears a belt which gives the kapre the ability to be invisible to humans. In some versions, the kapre is supposed to hold a magical white stone, a little smaller in size than a quail egg. Should any person happen to obtain this stone, the kapre could grant wishes.

==Behavior==
Kapres are believed to be nocturnal and omnivorous.&lt;ref name="eberhart"/&gt; They are not necessarily considered to be evil. However, they may turn vengeful when the tree that they are inhabiting is cut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vicerra|first1=PM|last2=Javier|first2=JR|title=TABI-TABI PO: SITUATING THE NARRATIVE OF SUPERNATURAL IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PHILIPPINES COMMUNITY|journal=MANUSYA: Journal of Humanities|url=http://www.manusya.journals.chula.ac.th/files/essay/Tabi-Tabi_1-13.pdf|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Kapre may make contact with people to offer friendship, or if it is attracted to a [[woman]]. If a Kapre befriends a human, especially because of love, the Kapre will consistently follow its "love interest" throughout life. Also, if one is a friend of the Kapre, then that person will have the ability to see it and if they were to sit on it then any other person would be able to see the huge entity.

Kapres, also called agtà,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title = kapri|last      = Wolff|first     = John U. |encyclopedia     = A Dictionary of Cebuano Visayan|year = 1972 |url = http://seapdatapapers.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=seap&amp;cc=seap&amp;idno=seap085a&amp;node=seap085a%3A11&amp;view=image&amp;seq=466&amp;size=200|page=442|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; are said to play pranks on people,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title = agtà|last = Wolff|first = John U. |encyclopedia = A Dictionary of Cebuano Visayan|year = 1972|url = http://seapdatapapers.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=seap&amp;cc=seap&amp;idno=seap085a&amp;node=seap085a%3A11&amp;view=image&amp;seq=39&amp;size=200|page=15|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; frequently making travelers become disoriented and lose their way in the [[mountain]]s or in the [[Woodland|woods]].  They are also believed to have the ability to confuse people even in their own familiar surroundings; for instance, someone who forgets that they are in their own garden or home is said to have been tricked by a Kapre. Reports of experiencing Kapre enchantment include that of witnessing rustling tree branches, even if the wind is not strong.  Some more examples would be hearing loud laughter coming from an unseen being, witnessing lots of smoke from the top of a tree, seeing big red glaring eyes during night time from a tree, as well as actually seeing a Kapre walking in forested areas. It is also believed that abundant fireflies in woody areas are the embers from the Kapre's lit Cigars or Tobacco pipe.

==Documentary==
In the 2015 documentary series ''[[The Creatures of Philippine Mythology]]'', the origin, history and evolution of the Kapre is examined.  It starts in the pre-Spanish Philippines where animist beliefs created a huge black spirit that watched people from the trees, follows the etymology of the term "kapre", and discovers why the creature is always smoking cigars.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Jordan "KAPRE: The Tree Dweller" Episode 02, ''Creatures Of Philippine Mythology'' (2015) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUrxlu1J0N8&lt;/ref&gt;

'''King v Wilkinson''' (1994) 2 NZConvC 191,828 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding where a mistake is known to one party (often referred to as a unilateral  mistake) when a contract is formed, under section 6(1)(a)(i) of the [[Contractual Mistakes Act 1977]].&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |isbn=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Kings were interested in purchasing the Wilkinson's property, and Wilkinson's real estate agent showed them over the property resulting in them purchasing the property.

After purchasing the property, the Kings discovered that the fences did not accurately represent the true legal boundary, with the southern boundary fence being 3.5 meters outside the legal boundary of the property, something the Wilkinsons would have been aware of, as four years earlier, they had subdivided the section and so knew the true boundaries of the property.

The Kings sought relief under the Contractual Mistakes Act.

==Held==
The court granted the Kings relief, as it was a unilateral mistake, covered by section 6(1)(a)(I).

[[File:Frontispiece of a Jawi edition of the Malay Annals.jpg|340px|thumb|The frontispiece of a [[Jawi script|Jawi]] edition of the Malay Annals]]
The '''''Malay Annals''''' ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Sejarah Melayu'', [[Jawi script|Jawi]]: سجاره ملايو), originally titled ''Sulalatus Salatin'' (''Genealogy of Kings''),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ooi|2009|p=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a literary work that gives a romanticised history of the origin, evolution and demise of the great Malay maritime empire, the [[Malacca Sultanate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNESCO|2012|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work which was composed sometime between 15th and 16th centuries, is considered one of the finest literary and historical works in the [[Malay language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Encyclopædia Britannica|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original text has undergone numerous changes, with the oldest known version dated May 1612, through the rewriting effort commissioned by the then [[regent]] of [[Johor Sultanate|Johor]], [[Abdullah Ma'ayat Shah|Yang di-Pertuan Di Hilir Raja Abdullah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Samad Ahmad|1979|p=xxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Encyclopædia Britannica|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally written in the [[Classical Malay]] on traditional paper in old [[Jawi script]], but today exists in 32 different manuscripts, including those in [[Malay alphabet|Rumi script]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ooi|2009|p=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding some of its mystical contents, historians have looked at the text as a primary source of information on past events verifiable by other historical sources, in the [[Malay world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Encyclopædia Britannica|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the Malay Annals was listed on UNESCO's [[Memory of the World Programme]] International Register.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNESCO|2012|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compilation history==
The number of manuscripts of the Malay Annals and its related texts is fairly large. The manuscripts are found scattered over libraries in various countries: in Indonesia (Jakarta, Museum Pusat), in the United Kingdom (mainly in London), in the Netherlands ([[Leiden]])&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roolvink|1967|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Malaysia ([[Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNESCO|2001|pp=[http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/mow/nomination_forms/malaysia_sejarah_melayu.pdf Nomination form pp. 3–4]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all of these manuscripts have the same value; some are fragmentary or otherwise incomplete; others are just copies of existing manuscripts, and some are even copies of the printed text.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roolvink|1967|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; A version of the Annals dated 1612, acquired by Sir [[Stamford Raffles]] and coded ''Raffles MS no.18'' or ''Raffles Manuscript 18'', is considered the oldest and most faithful to the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ooi|2009|p=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a possibility that ''Raffles MS no.18'' version has developed from a genealogical [[king-list]] complete with the periods of reigns and dates. This king-list subsequently enlarged by various stories and historically relevant material which was inserted into it in suitable places, but at the same time it lost its dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roolvink|1967|pp=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unknown Malay texts titled ''Soelalet Essalatina'' or ''Sulalatu'l-Salatina'', that referred by [[Petrus Van der Vorm]] and [[François Valentijn]] in their works ''Collectanea Malaica Vocabularia'' ("Collection of Malay Vocabulary") (1677) and ''Oud En New Oost Indien'' ("A short history of East Indies") (1726) respectively, could have existed in the form of a king-list.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roolvink|1967|pp=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the introduction of ''Raffles MS no.18'' describes that the manuscript originates from another manuscript known as ''Hikayat Melayu'', which may trace its origin to the time of Melaka Sultanate (1400–1511).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leyden|1821|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Samad Ahmad|1979|p=xxv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ooi|2009|p=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript was brought together when the last ruler, [[Mahmud Shah of Malacca|Mahmud Shah]] fleeing the [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|Portuguese invasion]] in 1511 to [[Kampar Regency|Kampar]]. In 1536, during the Portuguese attack on [[Johor Lama]], where the exiled sultan established his base, the manuscript was seized by the Portuguese soldiers and brought to [[Goa]], [[Portuguese India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Samad Ahmad|1979|p=xxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decades later, in the early 17th century, the manuscript was returned to Johor from Goa by a nobleman&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leyden|1821|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified as ''Orang Kaya Sogoh''. However, historian Abdul Samad Ahmad provides an alternative view, suggesting that the manuscript was returned from [[Gowa]], [[Sulawesi]] instead of [[Goa]], India. His argument is based on the fact that during Melaka's era as an important regional [[entreport]], it had established a strong trading and diplomatic ties with regional kingdoms, including Gowa, and some copies of ''Hikayat Melayu'' could have been spread to [[Sulawesi]] long before the arrival of Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Samad Ahmad|1979|p=xxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another view, from William Linehan, tried to argue that Goa ought to read ''guha'' or ''gua'', and that the reference was to Gua, a place located north of [[Kuala Lipis]] in Pahang, where a copy of the Annals had been preserved and later brought to Johor and edited there in 1612.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roolvink|1967|pp=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday, 12th [[Rabi' al-awwal]] 1021 [[Anno hegirae|AH]] (corresponds to 13 May 1612 CE), during the reign of [[Alauddin Riayat Shah III]] in Pekan Tua, the regent of Johor, [[Abdullah Ma'ayat Shah|Yang di-Pertuan Di Hilir Raja Abdullah]] also known as ''Raja Bongsu'', had commissioned the rewriting and compilation work of the manuscript to the [[Bendahara]] [[Tun Sri Lanang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leyden|1821|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Samad Ahmad|1979|p=xxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later in 1613, the Johor capital of Batu Sawar was sacked by the [[Aceh Sultanate|Acehnese]] invaders and Alauddin Riayat Shah, and his entire court, including Tun Sri Lanang and Raja Abdullah was captured and exiled to [[Aceh]]. Although Tun Sri Lanang manage to worked a bulk of the Annals in Johor, he completed the work during his captivity in Aceh.

In 1821, the English translation of ''Raffles MS no.18'' by [[John Leyden]] was first published in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roolvink|1967|pp=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, it was followed by the edited version in Malay language by [[Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir]], published in Singapore in 1831 and the compilation by [[Édouard Dulaurier]] in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roolvink|1967|pp=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, [[William Shellabear]]'s edition was published. It is considered as a hybrid long text, primarily based on Abdullah and Dulaurier's version but containing extracts from other texts as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roolvink|1967|pp=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then followed by another translation of ''Raffles MS no.18'', this time by [[Richard Olaf Winstedt]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roolvink|1967|pp=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important version, compiled by Malaysian historian Abdul Samad Ahmad in 1979, uses the original title of the text, ''Sulalatus Salatin''. Abdul Samad's compilation was based on three manuscripts that he named as A, B and C, kept in the library of [[Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka]], Kuala Lumpur.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Samad Ahmad|1979|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the manuscripts, alternatively named as ''MS86'' and ''MS86a'' by Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka, were later referred in the nomination form submitted for UNESCO's [[Memory of the World Programme]] International Register.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNESCO|2001|p=[http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/mow/nomination_forms/malaysia_sejarah_melayu.pdf Nomination form p. 3]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The Malay Annals is a historical literature written in the form of narrative-[[prose]] with its main theme was to laud the greatness and superiority of Melaka.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNESCO|2001|p=[http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/mow/nomination_forms/malaysia_sejarah_melayu.pdf Nomination form p. 7]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narration, while seemingly relating the story of the reign of the sultans of Melaka until the demise of the sultanate to the Portuguese in 1511 and beyond, deals with a core issue of Malay statehood and historiography, the relationship between rulers and ruled.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNESCO|2012|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Annals are prefaced by a celebration of the greatness of Allah, the Prophet and his companions. They begin with a genealogical account of the first sultan of Melaka who is said to be descended from [[Dhul-Qarnayn|Raja Iskandar Zulkarnain]]. The Annals cover the founding of Melaka and its rise to power; its relationship with neighbouring kingdoms and distant countries; the advent of Islam and its spread in Melaka and the region as a whole; the history of the royalty in the region including battles won or lost, marriage ties and diplomatic relationships; the administrative hierarchy that ruled Melaka; the greatness of its rulers and administrators, including the [[Bendahara]] [[Tun Perak]] and [[Laksamana]], [[Hang Tuah]]. The Annals conclude with the account of Melaka's defeat by the Portuguese forces in 1511, resulting not only in the downfall of Melaka, but also in the eventual re-emergence of the Melakan-modeled sultanates in other parts of the region, including Johor, Perak and Pahang.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNESCO|2012|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable stories===
* The genealogical origin of [[Sang Sapurba]] from [[Dhul-Qarnayn|Raja Iskandar Zulkarnain]], his miraculous appearance in [[Bukit Seguntang]], and the famous [[oath]] he made with Demang Lebar Daun, the native chief of [[Palembang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Samad Ahmad|1979|pp=8–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The adventure of [[Sang Nila Utama]] from [[Palembang]] to [[Temasek]], and the founding of [[Kingdom of Singapura|Singapura]]. The Annals also describes how Singapura got its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Samad Ahmad|1979|pp=30–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The legend of [[Badang]], a man with an unusual strength who was said to have demonstrated his feat of strength in [[Paduka Seri Rana Wikrama|Sri Rana Wikrama]]'s court.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Samad Ahmad|1979|pp=47–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The story of [[Hang Nadim]], the saviour of Singapura when the coastline of the kingdom was infested by numerous fierce [[swordfish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Samad Ahmad|1979|pp=67–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fall of [[Kingdom of Singapura|Singapura]] to [[Majapahit]], and the fleeing of the last ruler, [[Iskandar Shah|Sri Iskandar Shah]]. He lost the island kingdom after falsely accusing and punishing one of his [[concubine]]s for [[adultery]]. Her father, Sang Rajuna Tapa, who was also an official in Sri Iskandar Shah's court, acted upon his family's holdings, changed sides and opened the way for a successful Majapahit invasion that ousted Sri Iskandar Shah.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Samad Ahmad|1979|pp=62–66, 69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The founding of [[Melaka Sultanate|Melaka]]. The last ruler of Singapura, Sri Iskandar Shah fled north and later founded Melaka and introduced court ceremonies, laws and regulations which became the basis of Melaka administration. The Annals also describes how Melaka got its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Samad Ahmad|1979|pp=71–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The story of [[Tun Perak]], the most revered [[Bendahara]] of Melaka. The Annals recounts his illustrious career, from a noble headman of [[Klang (city)|Klang]] to become the second most powerful man in Melaka' court.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Samad Ahmad|1979|pp=89–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The saga of [[Hang Tuah]] and his companions. According to the ''[[Hikayat Hang Tuah]]'', Hang Tuah killed one of his companions [[Hang Jebat]] in a [[duel]] that took place at the [[Istana]] of Melaka. The Shellabear and Winstedt's versions of the Annals on the other hand records that instead of Hang Jebat, Hang Tuah killed Hang Kasturi.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Australian National University|p=[http://mcp.anu.edu.au/N/SM_bib.html Sejarah Melayu]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Legend of Puteri Gunung Ledang]]. It recounts the story of a legendary fairy princess living on top of [[Mount Ophir]], Johor during the reign of [[Mahmud Shah of Malacca|Mahmud Shah]] and once wooed by the sultan himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Samad Ahmad|1979|pp=212–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|The Portuguese conquest of Melaka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Samad Ahmad|1979|pp=267–270}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Annals, the Portuguese forces, led by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]], launched a second assault on Melaka during the reign of [[Ahmad Shah of Malacca|Ahmad Shah]], the first being repulsed by the late Bendahara [[Tun Mutahir of Malacca|Tun Mutahir]]. The assault on the city was great on the first day, and on the second, Melaka fell to the Portuguese. However, according to Portuguese records, Albuquerque's assault on Melaka started on 25 July 1511, (on [[St. James Day]]), and the battle lasted for 15 days before the city was captured on 15 August. Also, Portuguese records, especially the ones written by Albuquerque's son, mention that the Melakan Commander-In-Chief, Ahmad Shah, fell on the field of battle.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} However, in the Malay Annals account, he survived the battle and retreated to a safer place, only to be put to death by his own father.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Samad Ahmad|1979|p=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The Malay Annals have had great influence on the history, culture, and development of the Malay civilisation, which had to confront major cultural transformation through the centuries. Through courtly chronicles like the Malay Annals, the Melakan tradition developed in the 15th century was transmitted onwards and fostered a vigorous ethos of Malay identity. These chronicles became an important source of instruction for Melaka's successor regimes, as they enshrined the sanctity and authority of a Malay ruler (''daulat''), his role in maintaining the cohesion of the realm, and legitimated the increasingly absolutist visage these states adopted in the competitive environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harper|2001|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tun Sri Lanang]] wrote as follows at the beginning of the Annals:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Siti Hawa Hj. Salleh|2010|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The royal command of His Majesty, "That we ask the [[Bendahara]] for the [[hikayat]] be produced in the nature of the events and speech of Malay kings and their customs and traditions as well; so it would known by all our descendants who succeed us, remembered by them; therupon will they benefit from it.}}

As it is known, the Malay Annals and all kinds of other Malay manuscripts of whatever category still remain subjects of the study for the 'people who succeeded' from the time the works were produced. Clearly those works not only tell us about "the nature of the events and speech of Malay kings and their customs and traditions", but something far more deeper and broader than that.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Siti Hawa Hj. Salleh|2010|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations==
There are a number of English translations of the ''Malay Annals'', the first of which is by [[John Leyden]] published in 1821 with an introduction by Sir [[Stamford Raffles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41493475|title=John Leyden and the publication of the "Malay Annals" (1821) |first=John|last= Bastin |journal=Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society |volume= 75|number= 2 (283) |date=2002|pages= 99-115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another one by C.C. Brown was published in 1952.

The "'''Marlborough gem'''" is a carved [[onyx]] [[Cameo (carving)|cameo]] that depicts an initiation ceremony of [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche and Eros]].&lt;ref&gt;Traditionally identified as a [[Wedding|marriage ceremony]]: "160. The renowned cameo representing the hymeneal procession of Eros and Psyche" as it was catalogued in Nevil Story-Maskelyne, ''The Marlborough gems, being a collection of works in cameo and intaglio...'' (1870), which reports Heinrich Brunn's opinion that the cameo, despite its unsurpassed technique, is not antique, in part based on the frieze-like composition that does not fill the field.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the most famous [[engraved gem]] in the extensive and prominent collection both inherited (through a marriage in 1762) and expanded by [[George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough]].&lt;ref&gt;See Boardman Lecture, and [http://www.dicamillocompanion.com/Houses_hgpm.asp?ID=237 this account of the collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726162958/http://www.dicamillocompanion.com/Houses_hgpm.asp?ID=237 |date=2011-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is conserved in the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]], where it is called ''Cameo with the Wedding of Cupid and Psyche, or an initiation rite'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/cameo-with-the-wedding-of-cupid-and-psyche-or-an-initiation-rite-155692 Boston MFA]&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the view of its subject generally held until the last century.

In the carving, Cupid and Psyche are depicted as veiled [[putti]] accompanied by other infants, one of whom holds over their heads a [[Winnowing-fan#In Greek culture|winnowing-fan]] filled with [[pomegranate]]s, emblems of ''bios'' and [[Fertility symbol|fertility]]. Signed ''Tryphon'',&lt;ref&gt;No other engraved gem signed by Tryphon is known to exist, according to M.L. Vollenweider, ''Die Steinschneidekunst und ihre kunstler in spätrepublikanischer und augusteischer Zeit'', 1966, pl. 28. no. 1, noted in Diana Scarisbrick, "Henry Walters and the Marlborough Gems", ''The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery'' '''39''' (1981:49-58) p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt; it was probably made in the 1st century CE, though its date has been questioned and a case made for a 16th-century origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/archive/lectures/boardman.htm John Boardman, "The Marlborough Gems", 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; The Gem was given by [[Peter Paul Rubens]], who declared that he loved gems beyond all other relics of antiquity,&lt;ref&gt;Noted in  Scarisbrick 1981:49 note 7.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel]], in the 17th century.   Another famous gem from the Marlborough Collection that is also sometimes known just as the "Marlborough Gem" is a head of [[Antinous]].&lt;ref&gt;"Generally regarded as one of the finest portrait gems from antiquity," according to John Boardman ([http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/archive/lectures/boardman.htm Boardman lecture]) the Marlborough Antinous carved from a black stone was bought by Marlborough as the outstanding piece from the prime collection of [[Antonio Maria Zanetti]], Rome; it had been broken, and restored in a gold mount; it is conserved in a private collection in Monaco.&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist's signature is minutely incised into the black background of the stone, just above the central figures in the [[frieze]]-like procession. Various 18th-century sources reported that [[Louis XIV of France]] had been prepared to offer the equivalent of £4000 in the previous century.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny, ''Taste and the Antique: the lure of classical sculpture, 1500-1900'' 1981:49, note 51 (the gem's subject given the traditional title the 'Wedding of Cupid and Psyche').&lt;/ref&gt; An early 16th-century drawing of the subject by the architect and [[antiquarian]] [[Pirro Ligorio]] was seen among the papers of [[Rascas de Bagarris]] recorded by [[Jacob Spon]].&lt;ref&gt;Spon, ''Recherches curieuses d'antiquités,'' (Lyon, 1683:87), noted in Oleg Neverov, "Gems in the Collection of Rubens", ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''121''' No. 916 (July 1979:424-432) p. 428 and note 48; Rubens sent a cast of the Tryphon gem among casts of his others to [[Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc|Claude Peiresc]].&lt;/ref&gt; The gem was carefully drawn by Theodorus Netscher and engraved by [[Bernard Picart]] for [[Philipp von Stosch]]'s ''Gemmae antiquae caelatae'' (1724)&lt;ref&gt;Stosch, ''Gemmae antiquae caelatae'', Amsterdam, 1724, pp 94-97; pl. lxx illustrated in Haskell and Penny 1981, fig. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; which placed its magnified image in the hands of all Europe's [[antiquarian]]s and rendered it part of the visual repertory of ''milordi'' on the [[Grand Tour]], who knew it from its illustration added to the 1728 French edition of the Jonathan Richardsons' (Senior and Junior) ''Account...'', published in French as  ''Traité de la Peinture et de la Sculpture...'' Amsterdam, 1728;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1728, vol. iii. part i, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; in the 18th century the English could be counted on to pay top prices for outstanding [[carved hardstone]]s of assured antiquity. 

Once in the Marlborough collection, the gem was often redrawn: [[Giovanni Battista Cipriani]] painted a version of the gem,&lt;ref&gt;Sherwin's engraving after Cipriani, from Jacob Bryant, ''A New System, or, An Analysis of Ancient Mythology'' (London, 1775), was illustrated by [[Jean Howard Hagstrum|Jean H. Hagstrum]], "Eros and Psyche: Some Versions of Romantic Love and Delicacy", ''Critical Inquiry'' '''3'''.3 (Spring 1977:521-542) fig. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francesco Bartolozzi]] engraved it, [[James Tassie]] cast it in opaque coloured glass paste,&lt;ref&gt;Tassie, ''Catalogue...'' pl. xlii.&lt;/ref&gt; and for [[Josiah Wedgwood]], first [[William Hackwood]] reproduced a low relief from Tassie's cast, and then [[John Flaxman]] modeled it at a larger scale;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ladylever/collections/wedgwood/johnflaxman.asp Images from Liverpool] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015093525/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ladylever/collections/wedgwood/johnflaxman.asp |date=2009-10-15 }}, Lady Charlotte Schreiber,  ''The Schreiber collection. Catalogue of English porcelain, earthenware, enamels...'' (Victoria &amp; Albert Museum), cat. no. 1279 "Pair of oval plaques" with Flaxman's  "Sacrifice to Hymen" forming the pendant.&lt;/ref&gt; both versions were executed in Wedgwood &amp; Bentley's white-on-blue [[jasperware]] that imitated cameos; the 'Marlborough Gem' first appeared in Wedgwood's 1779 catalogue. The Wedgwood plaque, available in several sizes, appears mounted on Parisian and London furniture, and a marble relief of the scene is set in the chimneypiece of the red drawing room at the original home of the Marlborough gems.&lt;ref&gt;A chimneypiece at the Marlborough seat, [[Blenheim Palace]] , in Woodstock is carved with a representation of the design. J.Boardman with D. Scarisbrick, C. Wagner and E. Zwierlein-Diehl ''The Marlborough Gems'' (Oxford University Press 2009), p.34&lt;/ref&gt; It became so familiar that the caricaturist [[James Gillray]] engraved a parody of it in 1797, lampooning the long-delayed marriage of [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] to the actress [[Elizabeth Farren]], who is travestied as a tall, lanky veiled figure, who is offered a [[Coronet|countess's coronet]] instead of the winnowing fan of pomegranates, with the plump cherubic Lord Derby at her side. By 1870 the Marlborough collection cataloguer observed, "the design has been reproduced in all sorts and materials of art, perhaps oftener than any other similar subject."

The 7th Duke of Marlborough sold the gem, catalogued as "The Marriage of Cupid and Psyche", together with the other Marlborough Gems, at [[Christie's|Christie Manson &amp; Wood, London]], in 1875. The collection, sold in a single lot that brought £35,000, went to David Bromilow of Bitteswell Hall, Leicestershire, who maintained the collection intact; when his daughter subsequently sold the  Marlborough gem with the rest of the Bromilow Marlborough hardstones by Christie's, 26–29 July 1899, the cameo was sold for £2000.&lt;ref&gt;For the latest publication on the subject see now J.Boardman with D.Scarisbrick, C.Wagner and E.Zwierlein-Diehl ''The Marlborough Gems'' (OUP 2009), no.1; [https://www.nytimes.com/1899/06/30/archives/marlborough-gems-sold-sale-of-the-david-bromilow-collection.html "Marlborough gems sold, ''The New York Times'', 30 June 1899]&lt;/ref&gt;  Now the collection is very widely dispersed, with large numbers in American museums. Pictures of impressions, [[electrotyping|electrotypes]] and many originals are now published on-line by the Beazley Archive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/gems/marlborough Beazley Archive: Marlborough]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Middle English Dictionary''''' is a [[dictionary]] of [[Middle English]] published by the [[University of Michigan]]. "Its 15,000 pages offer a comprehensive analysis of lexicon and usage for the period 1100-1500, based on the analysis of a collection of over three million citation slips, the largest collection of this kind available."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ets.umdl.umich.edu/m/med/ ''Middle English Dictionary''].&lt;/ref&gt;

The project began in the 1920s. The first instalment, "Plan and Bibliography", containing a list of Middle English texts used for the ''Middle English Dictionary'', was published by [[Hans Kurath]] and Sherman Kuhn in 1954. More fascicles were published in numerous volumes (in alphabetical order) over the next several decades. The dictionary was completed in 2001.

In 2007, the full dictionary was made freely available and searchable online in an [[HTML]] format.

[[File:Miroslavs Gospel in Temple of Saint Sava.jpg|thumb|A copy of the Miroslav Gospel at the [[Cathedral of Saint Sava]]]]
'''Miroslav's Gospel''' ({{lang-sr|Мирослављево Јеванђеље}} / ''Miroslavljevo Jevanđelje'', {{IPA-sh|mǐrɔslaʋʎɛʋɔ jɛʋǎndʑɛːʎɛ|pron}}) is a 362-page [[illuminated manuscript]] [[Gospel Book]] on [[parchment]] with very rich decorations. It is one of the oldest surviving documents written in the [[Old Church Slavonic#Serbian recension|Serbian recension of Church Slavonic]]. The gospel is considered a masterpiece of illustration and calligraphy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Culture and Customs of Serbia and Montenegro|last=Deliso|first=Christopher|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2008|isbn=9780313344367|location=Westport, CT|pages=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Origin and discovery ==
Miroslav's Gospel was commissioned in the 12th century (in the year 1186) by [[Miroslav of Hum|Miroslav, the ruler (''knez'') of Hum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The A to Z of Bosnia and Herzegovina|last=Cuvalo|first=Ante|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.|year=2007|isbn=9780810876477|location=Lanham, MD|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the brother of [[Stefan Nemanja]], the [[List of Serbian monarchs|Grand Prince of Rascia]]. The first to discover and study the manuscript were three Russian scholars: [[Vladimir Stasov]], [[Fyodor Buslayev]], and [[Nikodim Kondakov]] in 1874.

A leaf of the book which the Archbishop [[Porphyrius Uspensky]] had cut out of the book from the [[Hilandar|Hilandar Monastery]] library in 1845 was first publicly shown at an exhibition in [[Kiev]] in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlr.ru/eng/exib/Gospel/slav/20.html NLR.ru]&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest [[facsimile]] edition appeared in [[Vienna]] in 1897. The book was traditionally kept at the Hilandar Monastery on [[Mount Athos]], before it was presented to King [[Alexander I of Serbia|Alexander I]] of Serbia, on the occasion of his visit to the monastery in 1896. Today it is in the collection of the [[National Museum of Serbia]] in [[Belgrade]].

The book was originally transcribed in [[Kotor]] in modern-day [[Montenegro]] between 1186 and 1190 from an earlier text. Most pages are by an unknown scribe from [[Zeta (crown land)|Zeta]], with the last few pages written by the scribe Grigorije of [[Raška (region)|Raška]], also known as Grigorije the Scribe or Pupil. Although Miroslav's Gospel is one of the earliest [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]-texted manuscripts, the document appeared later than other Serbian liturgical manuscripts written in [[Glagolitic script|Glagolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Orthodox Christian World|last=Casiday|first=Augustine|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=9780415455169|location=Oxon|pages=537}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language used is considered unique as it showed the transition between Old Church Slavonic and the first recognizably distinct Serbian language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In 2005, the Miroslav Gospel was inscribed in [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Register]] in recognition of its historical value.&lt;ref name=mow&gt;{{cite web|title= Miroslav Gospel – Manuscript from 1180 |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-5/miroslav-gospel-manuscript-from-1180/| date=2014-01-19 |publisher=UNESCO Memory of the World Programme |accessdate=2009-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Left''' was a broad political movement mainly in the 1960s and 1970s consisting of activists in the [[Western world]] who campaigned for a broad range of social issues such as [[civil and political rights]], [[feminism]], [[Gay rights movement|gay rights]], [[Abortion-rights movements|abortion rights]], [[gender role]]s and [[drug policy reform]]s.&lt;ref name="Carmines and Layman"&gt;Carmines, Edward G., and Geoffrey C. Layman. 1997. "Issue Evolution in Postwar American Politics." In Byron Shafer, ed., ''Present Discontents''. NJ: Chatham House Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Some saw the New Left as an oppositional reaction to earlier [[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[labor union]] movements for [[social justice]] that focused on [[dialectical materialism]] and [[social class]], while others who used the term saw the movement as a continuation and revitalization of traditional [[leftist]] goals.&lt;ref name=Kaufman&gt;{{cite book|author=Cynthia Kaufman|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3nJUwFqRLTwC&amp;lpg=PA277&amp;dq=new%20left%20cynthia%20kaufman&amp;pg=PA275#v=onepage&amp;q=new%20left&amp;f=false|title=Ideas For Action: Relevant Theory For Radical Change|isbn=9780896086937|year=2003|publisher=South End Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Todd Gitlin]], "The Left's Lost Universalism".

Some who self-identified as "New Left"&lt;ref name="New Left"&gt;'The Left In History: Revolution and Reform in Twentieth-Century Politics''. 1996&lt;/ref&gt; rejected involvement with the [[labor movement]] and Marxism's historical theory of [[class struggle]],&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey W. Coker. ''Confronting American Labor: The New Left Dilemma''. Univ of Missouri Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; although others gravitated to their own takes on established forms of Marxism, such as the [[New Communist movement]] (which drew from [[Maoism]]) in the United States or the [[K-Gruppe]]n in the German Sprachraum. In the United States, the movement was associated with the anti-war college-campus protest movements, including the [[Free Speech Movement]].

==Historical origins==
The origins of the New Left have been traced to several factors. Prominently, the confused response of the [[Communist Party of the USA]] and the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] to the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] led some [[Marxism|Marxist]] intellectuals to develop a more democratic approach to politics, opposed to what they saw as the centralised and authoritarian politics of the pre-war leftist parties. Those Communists who became disillusioned with the Communist Parties due to their authoritarian character eventually formed the "new left", first among dissenting Communist Party intellectuals and campus groups in the United Kingdom, and later alongside campus radicalism in the United States and in the [[Western Bloc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kenny | first = Michael | title = The First New Left: British Intellectuals After Stalin | publisher = Lawrence &amp; Wishart | location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "nouvelle gauche" was already current in France in the 1950s, associated with ''[[France Observateur]]'', and its editor [[Claude Bourdet]], who attempted to form a third position, between the dominant [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] and [[social democracy|social democratic]] tendencies of the left, and the two Cold War blocs. It was from this French "new left" that the "First New Left" of Britain borrowed the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hall | first = Stuart | author-link = Stuart Hall (cultural theorist) | title = Life and times of the first New Left | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = II | issue = 61 | publisher = New Left Review | date = January–February 2010 | url = http://newleftreview.org/II/61/stuart-hall-life-and-times-of-the-first-new-left | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German-Jewish critical theorist [[Herbert Marcuse]] is referred to as the "Father of the New Left". He rejected the theory of class struggle and the Marxist concern with labor. According to [[Leszek Kołakowski]], Marcuse argued that since "all questions of material existence have been solved, moral commands and prohibitions are no longer relevant". He regarded the realization of man's erotic nature, or [[Eros (concept)|Eros]], as the true liberation of humanity, which inspired the utopias of [[Jerry Rubin]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kołakowski|first=Leszek|authorlink=Leszek Kołakowski|title=Main Currents Of Marxism: Volume III, The Breakdown|year=1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0192851098|page=416}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Marcuse also believed the concept of [[Logos]], which involves one's reason, would absorb [[Eros (concept)|Eros]] over time as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2KMIkcicAowC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=eros+and+civilization+logos&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2ld1iBGvN3&amp;sig=icvJt2rFMcdRAkYwZ21hnvM-2Xo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwix8t37npDdAhX1HzQIHQL5BhI4ChDoATAHegQIAhAB#v=onepage&amp;q=eros%20and%20civilization%20logos&amp;f=false|title=Eros and Civilization|author=Herbert Marcuse|publisher=Beacon Press|page=125-126|date=1955|accessdate=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another prominent New Left thinker, [[Ernst Bloch]], believed that socialism would prove the means for all human beings to become immortal and eventually create God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kołakowski|first=Leszek|authorlink=Leszek Kołakowski|title=Main Currents Of Marxism: Volume III, The Breakdown|year=1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0192851098|pages=436–440}}, quoting ''Dans Prinzip Hoffnung'' pp. 1380–1628.&lt;/ref&gt;

The writings of sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]], who popularized the term New Left in a 1960 open letter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wright | first = C. Wright | author-link = C. Wright Mills | title = Letter to the New Left | url =http://www.marxists.org/subject/humanism/mills-c-wright/letter-new-left.htm | website = marxists.org | date = 1960 }}&lt;/ref&gt; would also give great inspiration to the movement. Mills' biographer, Daniel Geary, writes that his writings had a "particularly significant impact on New Left social movements of the 1960s."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4yNnGJLHU8C&amp;dq=c+wright+mills+%22university+of+maryland%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Radical Ambition: C.

== Latin America ==
The New Left in Latin America can be loosely defined as the collection of political parties, radical grassroots social movements (such as indigenous movements, student movements, mobilizations of landless rural workers, afro-descendent organizations and feminist movements), guerilla organizations (such as the Cuban and Nicaraguan revolutions) and other organizations (such as trade unions, ''campesino'' leagues and human rights organizations) that comprised the left between 1959 (with the beginning of the Cuban Revolution) and 1990 (with the fall of the Berlin Wall).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Latin American Left: Utopia Reborn|last=Patrick Barrett, Daniel Chavez, César Rodríguez-Garavito|first=|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Latin American thinkers{{who|date=February 2018}} argued that the United States used Latin American countries as "peripheral economies" at the expense of Latin American society and economic development, which many saw as an extension of [[Neocolonialism|neo-colonialism]] and [[New Imperialism|neo-imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dependency and development in Latin America|last=Cardoso, F.H. and Faletto, E.|first=|publisher=University of California Press.|year=1969|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shift in thinking led to a surge of dialogue related to how Latin America could assert its social and economic independence from the United States. Many scholars{{who|date=February 2018}} argued that a shift to socialism could help liberate Latin America from this conflict.

The New Left emerged in Latin America, a group which sought to go beyond existing [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] efforts at achieving economic equality and democracy to include social reform and address issues unique to Latin America such as racial and ethnic equality, indigenous rights, the rights of the environment, demands for radical democracy, international solidarity, anti-colonialism, anti-imperialism and other aims.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Notable New Left movements in Latin America include the [[Cuban Revolution]] of 1959, the victory of the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] revolution in Nicaragua of 1979, the [[:en:Workers' Party (Brazil)|Partido dos Trabalhadores]] (Worker's Party) government in Porto Alegre of 1990, among others.

==Britain==
As a result of [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|Secret Speech]] denouncing [[Joseph Stalin]] many abandoned the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) and began to rethink its [[orthodox Marxism]]. Some joined various [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] groupings or the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennis L. Dworkin (1997). ''Cultural Marxism in postwar Britain: history, the new left, and the origins of cultural studies''. p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marxist historians [[E. P. Thompson]] and [[John Saville]] of the [[Communist Party Historians Group]] published a dissenting journal within the CPGB called ''Reasoner''. Refusing to discontinue the publication at the behest of the CPGB, the two were suspended from party membership and relaunched the journal as ''[[New Reasoner|The New Reasoner]]'' in the summer of 1957.

Thompson was especially important in bringing the concept of a "New Left" to the United Kingdom in the Summer of 1959 with a ''New Reasoner'' lead essay, in which he described

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...[A] generation which never looked upon the [[Soviet Union]] as a weak but heroic Workers' State; but rather as the nation of the [[Great Purges]] and [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] Byzantine Birthday and of [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev's]] [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]]; as the vast military and industrial power which repressed the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian rising]] and threw the first [[Sputnik 1|sputniks]] into space....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"A generation nourished on ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]'' and ''[[Animal Farm]],'' which enters politics at the extreme point of disillusion where the middle-aged begin to get out. The young people...are enthusiastic enough. But their enthusiasm is not for the Party, or the Movement, or the established Political Leaders. They do not mean to give their enthusiasm cheaply away to any routine machine. They expect the politicians to do their best to trick or betray them.... They prefer the amateur organisation and amateurish platforms of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|Nuclear Disarmament Campaign]] to the method and manner of the left wing professional.... They judge with the critical eyes of the first generation of the Nuclear Age."&lt;ref&gt;E.P, Thompson, "The New Left," ''The New Reasoner,'' whole no. 9 (Summer 1959), pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later that year, Saville published a piece in the same journal which identified the emergence of the British New Left as a response to the increasing political irrelevance of socialists inside and outside the Labour Party during the 1950s, which he saw as being the result of a failure by the established left to come to grips with the political changes that had come to pass internationally after World War II and with the [[post–World War II economic expansion]] and the socio-economic legacy of the [[Attlee ministry]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The most important single reason for the miserable performance of the Left in this past decade is the simple fact of its intellectual collapse in the face of full employment and the welfare state at home, and of a new world situation abroad. The Left in domestic matters has produced nothing of substance to offset the most important book of the decade - Crosland's "The Future of Socialism " - a brilliant restatement of Fabian ideas in contemporary terms. We have made no sustained critique of the economics of capitalism in the 1950's, and our vision of a socialist society has changed hardly at all since the days of [[Keir Hardie]]. Certainly a minority has begun to recognise our deficiencies in the most recent years, and there is no doubt that the seeds which have already been sown will bring an increasing harvest as we move along the sixties. But we still have a long way to go, and there are far too many timeless militants for whom the mixture is the same as before."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Saville |first1=John |author-link1=John Saville|date=Autumn 1959|title=A Note on West Fife |url=http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/nr/10_09.pdf |access-date=20 November 2016  |journal=[[New Reasoner]] |issue=10 |pages=9–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1960, ''The New Reasoner'' merged with the ''[[Universities and Left Review]]'' to form the ''[[New Left Review]]''. These journals attempted to synthesise a theoretical position of a [[Marxist revisionism]], [[humanism|humanist]], [[socialist]] Marxism, departing from [[orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxist]] theory. This publishing effort made the ideas of culturally oriented theorists available to an undergraduate reading audience.

In this early period, many on the New Left were involved in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), formed in 1957. According to [[Robin Blackburn]], "The decline of CND by late 1961, however, deprived the New Left of much of its momentum as a movement, and uncertainties and divisions within the Board of the journal led to the transfer of the Review to a younger and less experienced group in 1962."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Blackburn | first = Robin | author-link = Robin Blackburn | title = A brief history of New Left Review | url = http://newleftreview.org/history | website = newleftreview.org | publisher = [[New Left Review]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the long-standing editorial leadership of [[Perry Anderson]], the ''New Left Review'' popularised the [[Frankfurt School]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Louis Althusser]] and other forms of Marxism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Blackburn | first = Robin | author-link = Robin Blackburn | title = A brief history of New Left Review | url = http://newleftreview.org/history | website = newleftreview.org | publisher = [[New Left Review]] | quote = Anderson took over as editor in 1962. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other periodicals like ''[[Socialist Register]]'', started in 1964, and ''[[Radical Philosophy]]'', started in 1972, have also been associated with the New Left, and published a range of important writings in this field.

As the campus orientation of the American New Left became clear in the mid to late 1960s, the student sections of the British New Left began taking action. The [[London School of Economics]] became a key site of British student militancy.&lt;ref&gt;Hoch and Schoenbach, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of protests against the [[Vietnam War]] and of the [[May 1968 events]] in France were also felt strongly throughout the British New Left. Some within the British New Left joined the [[International Socialists (UK)|International Socialists]], which later became [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]] while others became involved with groups such as the [[International Marxist Group]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Adams, ''Ideology and politics in Britain today'' (1998) p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; The politics of the British New Left can be contrasted with [[Solidarity, UK|Solidarity]], which continued to focus primarily on industrial issues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tariq Ali]] ''Street-Fighting Years: An Autobiography of the Sixties'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant figure in the British New Left was [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], a black cultural theorist in Britain. He was the founding editor of the ''[[New Left Review]]'' in 1960.

The New Left Review, in an obituary following Hall’s death in February 2014, wrote "His exemplary investigations came close to inventing a new field of study, 'cultural studies'; in his vision, the new discipline was profoundly political in inspiration and radically interdisciplinary in character."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Blackburn | first = Robin | author-link = Robin Blackburn | title = Stuart Hall: 1932-2014 | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = II | issue = 86 | publisher = New Left Review | date = March–April 2014 | url = http://newleftreview.org/II/86/robin-blackburn-stuart-hall-1932-2014 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous Black British scholars attributed their interest in cultural studies to Hall, including [[Paul Gilroy]], [[Angela McRobbie]], [[Isaac Julien]], and [[John Akomfrah]]. In the words of Indian literary theorist [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]], "Academics worldwide could not think 'Black Britain' before Stuart Hall. And in Britain the impact of Cultural Studies went beyond the confines of the academy."&lt;ref&gt;Chakravorty Spivak, Gayatri.

Among Hall's New Left works were the ''May Day Manifesto'', which reflected a "growing disillusionment on the left with what the authors argued to be the surrendering of socialist principles by the Labour Party"&lt;ref&gt;[http://senatehouseoccupation.wordpress.com/reflections-and-recollections/the-may-day-manifesto/ "The May Day Manifesto"].

==United States==
In the United States, the "New Left" was the name loosely associated with liberal, radical, Marxist political movements that took place during the 1960s, primarily among college students. At the core of this was the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS).&lt;ref&gt;David Burner, ''Making Peace with the 60s'', (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1996), 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Left can be defined as "a loosely organized, mostly white student movement that advocated for democracy, civil rights, and various types of university reforms, and protested against the Vietnam war".&lt;ref&gt;Edited by John McMillian &amp; Paul Buhle, ''The New Left Revisited'', (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2003), 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "New Left" was popularised in the United States in an open letter written in 1960 by [[sociologist]] [[C. Wright Mills]] (1916–62) entitled ''Letter to the New Left''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Letter to the New Left|author=C. Wright Mills|url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/humanism/mills-c-wright/letter-new-left.htm|journal=New Left Review|number=5|year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mills argued for a new [[left-wing politics|leftist]] ideology, moving away from the traditional ("[[Old Left]]") focus on labor issues, into a broader focus towards issues such as opposing [[Social alienation|alienation]], [[anomie]], and [[authoritarianism]]. Mills argued for a shift from traditional leftism, toward the values of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], and emphasized an international perspective on the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Geary, "'Becoming International Again': C. Wright Mills and the Emergence of a Global New Left, 1956–1962," ''Journal of American History,'' Dec 2008, Vol. 95 Issue 3, pp. 710–736&lt;/ref&gt; According to David Burner, C. Wright Mills claimed that the proletariat (collectively the working-class referencing Marxism) were no longer the revolutionary force; the new agents of revolutionary change were young intellectuals around the world.&lt;ref&gt;David Burner, ''Making Peace with the 60s'', (Princeton University Press, 1996), 155&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[student protest]] called the [[Free Speech Movement]] took place during the 1964–1965 academic year on the campus of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] under the informal leadership of students [[Mario Savio]], Brian Turner, [[Bettina Aptheker]], Steve Weissman, Art Goldberg, [[Jackie Goldberg]], and others. In protests unprecedented in this scope at the time, students insisted that the university administration lift the ban of on-campus political activities and acknowledge the students' right to [[free speech]] and [[academic freedom]]. In particular, on 2 December 1964 on the steps of [[Sproul Hall]], [[Mario Savio]] gave a famous speech: "But we're a bunch of raw materials that don't mean to be—have any process upon us. Don't mean to be made into any product! Don't mean—Don't mean to end up being bought by some clients of the University, be they the government, be they industry, be they organized labor, be they anyone! We're human beings!...There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious—makes you so sick at heart—that you can't take part. You can't even passively take part. And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop. And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mariosaviosproulhallsitin.htm|title=American Rhetoric: Mario Savio - Sproul Hall Sit-In Address|first=Michael E.|last=Eidenmuller|website=www.americanrhetoric.com|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Left opposed what it saw as the prevailing authority structures in society, which it termed "[[The Establishment]]", and those who rejected this authority became known as "[[Anti-establishment|anti-Establishment]]". The New Left focused on [[social activist]]s and their approach to organization, convinced that they could be the source for a better kind of [[social revolution]].

The New Left in the United States also included anarchist, [[countercultural]], and [[hippie]]-related radical groups such as the [[Yippies]] (who were led by [[Abbie Hoffman]]), [[Diggers (theater)|The Diggers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=John Campbell McMillian |author2=Paul Buhle |title=The new left revisited |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_Ohks41z2IC&amp;pg=PA112 |accessdate=28 December 2011 |year=2003 |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-56639-976-0 |pages=112–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers]], and the [[White Panther Party]]. By late 1966, [[Diggers (theater)|the Diggers]] opened [[free stores]] which simply gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art.&lt;ref name="Lytle_2006_213215"&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the Yippies employed theatrical gestures, such as advancing a pig ("[[Pigasus (politics)|Pigasus]] the Immortal") as a candidate for President in 1968, to mock the social status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419101355/pg_2 | work=St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture | title=Yippies | first=David | last=Holloway | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been described as a highly theatrical, [[anti-authoritarian]], and anarchist&lt;ref name="Abbie Hoffman page 128"&gt;Abbie Hoffman, Soon to be a Major Motion Picture, page 128.

Many New Left thinkers in the United States were influenced by the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Chinese Cultural Revolution]]. Some in the U.S. New Left argued that since the Soviet Union could no longer be considered the world center for proletarian revolution, new revolutionary Communist thinkers had to be substituted in its place, such as [[Mao Zedong]], [[Ho Chi Minh]] and [[Fidel Castro]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Bacciocco, ''The New Left in America: reform to revolution, 1956 to 1970'' (1974) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Todd Gitlin]] in ''The Whole World Is Watching'' in describing the movement's influences stated, "The New Left, again, refused the self-discipline of explicit programmatic statement until too late—until, that is, the Marxist–Leninist sects filled the vacuum with dogmas, with clarity on the cheap."&lt;ref&gt;[[Todd Gitlin]], ''The Whole World Is Watching: Mass Media in the Making &amp; Unmaking of the New Left'', University of California Press, 2003, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

Isserman (2001) reports that the New Left "came to use the word 'liberal' as a political epithet".&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Isserman, ''The other American: the life of Michael Harrington'' (2001) p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Richard Ellis (1998) says that the SDS's search for their own identity "increasingly meant rejecting, even demonizing, liberalism."&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Ellis, ''The dark side of the Left: illiberal Egalitarianism in America'' (1998) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; As Wolfe (2010) notes, "no one hated liberals more than leftists".&lt;ref&gt;Alan Wolfe, "Jeremiah, American-style," ''New Republic'', May 13, 2010, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Other elements of the U.S. New Left were anarchist and looked to [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialist]] traditions of American [[Far left|radicalism]], the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] and union militancy.  This group coalesced around the historical journal ''Radical America''. American [[Autonomist Marxism]] was also a child of this stream, for instance in the thought of [[Harry Cleaver]]. [[Murray Bookchin]] was also part of the anarchist stream of the New Left, as were the Yippies.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Avrich, ''Anarchist voices: an oral history of anarchism in America'' (2005) p. 527&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. New Left drew inspiration from black radicalism, particularly the [[Black Power]] movement and the more explicitly [[Maoist]] and militant [[Black Panther Party]]. The Panthers in turn influenced other similar militant groups, like the [[Young Lords]], the [[Brown Berets]] and the [[American Indian Movement]]. The New Left was also inspired by [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC). Students immersed themselves into poor communities building up support with the locals.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;Maurice Isserman &amp; Michael Kazin, ''America Divided: The Civil War of the 1960s'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Left sought to be a broad based, grass roots movement.&lt;ref&gt;Edited by John McMillian &amp; Paul Buhle, ''The New Left Revisited'', (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2003), 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vietnam War]] conducted by liberal President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was a special target across the worldwide New Left. Johnson and his top officials became unwelcome on American campuses.  The [[Opposition to Vietnam War|anti-war movement]] escalated the rhetorical heat, as violence broke out on both sides. The climax came at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|1968 Democratic National Convention]].

The New Left also accommodated the rebirth of [[feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Isserman &amp; Michael Kazin, ''America Divided: The Civil War of the 1960s'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) 295.&lt;/ref&gt; As the original leaders of the New Left were largely white men, women reacted to the lack of progressive gender politics with their own social intellectual movement.&lt;ref&gt;Edited by John McMillian &amp; Paul Buhle, ''The New Left Revisited'', (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2003), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Left was also marked by the invention of the modern environmentalist movement, which clashed with the Old Left's disregard for the environment in favor of preserving the jobs of union workers. Environmentalism also gave rise to various other social justice movements such as the environmental justice movement, which aims to prevent the toxification of the environment of minority and disadvantaged communities.&lt;ref name=Kaufman/&gt;

By 1968, however, the New Left coalition began to split. The anti-war Democratic [[presidential nomination]] campaign of Kennedy and McCarthy brought the central issue of the New Left into the mainstream liberal establishment. The 1972 nomination of [[George McGovern]] further highlighted the new influence of Liberal protest movements within the Democratic establishment. Increasingly, feminist and gay rights groups became important parts of the Democratic coalition, thus satisfying many of the same constituencies that were previously unserved by the mainstream parties.&lt;ref name="Carmines and Layman"/&gt; This institutionalization took away all but the most radical members of the New Left. The remaining radical core of the SDS, dissatisfied with the pace of change, incorporated violent tendencies towards social transformation. After 1969, the Weathermen, a surviving faction of SDS, attempted to launch a guerrilla war in an incident known as the "Days of Rage". Finally, in 1970 three members of the Weathermen blew themselves up in a Greenwich Village brownstone trying to make a bomb out of a stick of dynamite and an alarm clock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=376 America in Ferment: The Tumultuous 1960s] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116170600/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=376 |date=2011-11-16 }}, ''The New Left'', Digital History University of Houston, updated 30-Jun-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Port Huron Statement participant [[Jack Newfield]] wrote in 1971 that "in its Weathermen, Panther and Yippee incarnations, [the New Left] seems anti-democratic, terroristic, dogmatic, stoned on rhetoric and badly disconnected from everyday reality".&lt;ref name="newfield19710719"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-MCAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title=A Populist Manifesto: The Making of a New Majority | work=New York | date=1971-07-19 | accessdate=6 January 2015 | author=Newfield, Jack | pages=39–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the more moderate groups associated with the New Left increasingly became central players in the Democratic Party and thus in mainstream American politics.

===Hippies and Yippies===
{{Main|Hippies|Yippies}}
[[File:Abbie Hoffman visiting the University of Oklahoma circa 1969.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Abbie Hoffman]], leader of the countercultural protest group the Yippies]]
The hippie [[subculture]] was originally a [[youth movement]] that arose in the [[United States]] during the mid-1960s and spread to other countries around the world. The [[Hippie (etymology)|word 'hippie']] came from ''[[hipster (1940s subculture)|hipster]]'', and was initially used to describe [[beatnik]]s who had moved into New York City's [[Greenwich Village]] and San Francisco's [[Haight-Ashbury]] district. The origins of the terms ''[[Hip (slang)|hip]]'' and ''hep'' are uncertain, though by the 1940s both had become part of [[African American culture|African American]] [[African American Vernacular English|jive]] slang and meant "currently fashionable; fully up-to-date".&lt;ref&gt;To say "I'm hip to the situation" means "I am aware of the situation.

Hippies created their own communities, listened to [[psychedelic rock]], embraced the [[sexual revolution]], and some used drugs such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], and [[psilocybin mushroom]]s to explore [[Altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]].

The [[Yippies]], who were seen as an offshoot of the hippie movements parodying as a political party, came to national attention during their celebration of the 1968 [[spring equinox]], when some 3,000 of them took over [[Grand Central Terminal]] in New York, resulting in 61 arrests. The Yippies, especially their leaders [[Abbie Hoffman]] and [[Jerry Rubin]], became notorious for their theatrics, such as trying to levitate the Pentagon at the October 1967 war protest, and such slogans as "Rise up and abandon the creeping meatball!" Their stated intention to protest the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in Chicago in August, including nominating their own candidate, "[[Pigasus (politics)|Lyndon Pigasus Pig]]" (an actual pig), was also widely publicized in the media at this time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900067,00.html "The Politics of Yip"]. ''TIME Magazine''. April 5, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; In Cambridge, hippies congregated each Sunday for a large "be-in" at Cambridge Park with swarms of drummers and those beginning the Women's Movement. In the United States the hippie movement started to be seen as part of the "New Left" which was associated with anti-war college campus protest movements.&lt;ref name="Carmines and Layman"/&gt;

===Students for a Democratic Society===
{{Main|Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)}}
The organization that really came to symbolize the core of the New Left was the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). By 1962, the SDS had emerged as the most important of the new campus radical groups; soon it would be regarded as virtually synonymous with the "New Left".&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Isserman, ''If I Had a Hammer: The Death of the Old Left and the Birth of the New Left'' (New York: Basic Books Inc Publishers, 1987) 174.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, [[Tom Hayden]] wrote its founding document, the [[Port Huron Statement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~hst306/documents/huron.html |title=Port Huron Statement of the Students for a Democratic Society, 1962 |publisher=Coursesa.matrix.msu.edu |accessdate=2012-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705062937/http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~hst306/documents/huron.html |archivedate=2009-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which issued a call for "participatory democracy" based on non-violent civil disobedience. This was the idea that individual citizens could help make 'those social decisions determining the quality and direction' of their lives.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"/&gt; The SDS marshalled anti-war, pro-civil rights and [[Free Speech Movement|free speech]] concerns on campuses, and brought together liberals and more revolutionary leftists.
[[File:Vietnamdem.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A demonstrator offers a flower to military police at an [[Opposition to Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War protest]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]], [[Virginia]], 21 October 1967]]
The SDS became the leading organization of the anti-war movement on college campuses during the [[Vietnam War]]. As the war escalated the membership of the SDS also increased greatly as more people were willing to scrutinise political decisions in moral terms.&lt;ref name=Isserman&gt;Maurice Isserman &amp; Michael Kazin, ''America Divided: The Civil War of the 1960s'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|170}} During the course of the war, the people became increasingly [[Militant (word)|militant]]. As opposition to the war grew stronger, the SDS became a nationally prominent political organization, with opposing the war an overriding concern that overshadowed many of the original issues that had inspired SDS. In 1967, the old statement in Port Huron was abandoned for a new call for action,&lt;ref name=Isserman/&gt;{{rp|172}} which would inevitably lead to the destruction of the SDS.

In 1968 and 1969, as its radicalism reached a fever pitch, the SDS began to split under the strain of internal dissension and increasing turn towards [[Maoism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Politics of the Self : Feminism and the Postmodern in West German Literature and Film|last=McCormick|first=Richard|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2014|isbn=9781400861644|location=|pages=34|quote=In 1969, the American organization ruptured into two factions, one Maoist and one proterrorist.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with adherents known as the [[New Communist Movement]], some extremist illegal factions also emerged, such as the [[Weather Underground]] organization.

The SDS suffered the difficulty of wanting to change the world while 'freeing life in the here and now.' This caused confusion between short-term and long-term goals. The sudden growth due to the successful rallies against the Vietnam War meant there were more people wanting action to end the Vietnam war, whereas the original New Left had wanted to focus on critical reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Edited by John McMillian &amp; Paul Buhle, ''The New Left Revisited'', (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2003), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, it was the anti-war sentiment that dominated the SDS.&lt;ref name=Isserman/&gt;{{rp|183}}

==Continental European New Left==
{{main|Protests of 1968}}
The European New Left appeared first in West Germany, which became a prototype for European student radicals.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Rothman and S. Robert Lichter, ''Roots of radicalism: Jews, Christians, and the Left'' (1996) p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; German students protesting against the Vietnam war often wore discarded US military uniforms, and they made influential contacts with dissident GIs—draftees who did not like the war either.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Hohn and Seungsook Moon, ''Over There: Living with the U.S. Military Empire from World War Two to the Present'' (2010) p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe [[Provo (movement)|Provo]] was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] counterculture movement in the mid-1960s that focused on provoking violent responses from authorities using non-violent bait. One manifestation of this was the French general strike that took place in Paris in May 1968, which nearly toppled the French government. In France the [[Situationist International]] reached the apex of its creative output and influence in 1967 and 1968, with the former marking the publication of the two most significant texts of the situationist movement, ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' by [[Guy Debord]] and ''[[The Revolution of Everyday Life]]'' by [[Raoul Vaneigem]]. The expressed writing and political theory of these texts, along with other situationist publications, proved greatly influential in shaping the ideas behind the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968 insurrections in France]]; quotes, phrases, and slogans from situationist texts and publications were ubiquitous on posters and graffiti throughout France during the uprisings.&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"&gt;{{cite book | last=Plant | first=Sadie | title=The Most Radical Gesture | publisher=Routledge | location=New York | year=1992 | isbn=978-0-415-06222-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another was the [[German student movement]] of the 1960s. [[Kommune 1]] or K1 was the first politically motivated [[commune (intentional community)|commune]] in [[Germany]]. It was created on January 12, 1967, in [[West Berlin]] and finally dissolved in November 1969. During its entire existence, Kommune 1 was infamous for its bizarre staged events that fluctuated between [[satire]] and [[Agent provocateur|provocation]]. These events served as inspiration for the "[[Revolutionary spontaneity|Sponti]]" movement and other leftist groups. In the late summer of 1968, the commune moved into a deserted factory on Stephanstraße in order to reorient. This second phase of Kommune 1 was characterized by sex, music, and drugs. All of a sudden, the commune was receiving visitors from all over the world, among them [[Jimi Hendrix]], who turned up one morning in the bedroom of Kommune 1.&lt;ref&gt;''Keith Richards: The Biography'', by Victor Bockris&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Underground (British subculture)|underground]] was a [[counterculture|countercultural]] movement in the [[United Kingdom]] linked to the [[subculture|underground culture]] in the [[United States]] and associated with the [[hippie]] phenomenon. Its primary focus was around [[Ladbroke Grove]] and [[Notting Hill]] in [[London]]. It generated its own magazines and newspapers, bands, clubs and alternative lifestyle, associated with [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and LSD use and a strong socio-political revolutionary agenda to create an alternative society. The counterculture movement took hold in Western Europe, with [[London]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Paris]], [[Rome]] and [[West Berlin]] rivaling San Francisco and New York as counterculture centers.

The [[Prague Spring]] was legitimised by the Czechoslovak government as a socialist reform movement. The 1968 events in the Czechoslovakia were driven forward by [[industry|industrial]] workers, and were explicitly theorized by active Czechoslovak unionists as a revolution for workers' control. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The student activism of the New Left came to a head around the world in 1968. The [[May 1968 protests in France]] temporarily shut down the city of [[Paris]], while the [[German student movement]] did the same in [[Bonn]]. Universities were simultaneously occupied in May in Paris, in the [[Columbia University protests of 1968]], and in Japanese student strikes. Shortly thereafter, Swedish students [[Occupation of the Student Union Building|occupied a building at Stockholm University]]. However, all of these protests were shut down by police authorities without achieving their goals, which caused the influence of the student movement to lapse in the 1970s.

[[File:Situationist.jpg|thumb|240px|May 1968 slogan in [[Paris]] which reads: "It is forbidden to forbid!"]]
While the [[Autonomia]] in Italy have been called New Left, it is more appropriate to see them as the result of traditional, industrially oriented, communism re-theorising its ideas and methods.  Unlike most of the New Left, Autonomia had a strong blue-collar arm, active in regularly occupying factories. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Globally==
The [[New Left (Japan)|New Left in Japan]] began by occupying college campuses for several years in the 1960s. After 1970, they splintered into several freedom fighter groups including the [[United Red Army]] and the [[Japanese Red Army]]. They also developed the political ideology of [[Anti-Japaneseism]].

The [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] (''Partido dos Trabalhadores'' – PT) is considered the main organization to emerge from the New Left in Brazil. According to Manuel Larrabure, "rather than taking the path of the old Latin American left, in the form of the guerrilla movement, or the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] party", PT decided to try something new, while being aided by [[Central Única dos Trabalhadores|CUT]] and other social movements. Its challenge was to "combine the institutions of [[liberal democracy]] with [[popular participation]] by communities and movements". PT, however, has been criticized for its "strategic alliances" with the right-wing after [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] was [[Brazilian presidential election, 2002|elected president of Brazil]]. The party has distanced itself from social movements and youth organizations and for many it seems the PT's model of a new left is reaching its limits.&lt;ref&gt;Larrabure, Manuel.

In [[Australia]], the New Left was engaged in debates concerning the legitimacy of [[heterodox economics]] and [[political economy]] in tertiary education.&lt;ref&gt;G Butler, E Jones, FJB Stilwell (2009) Political economy now!: The struggle for alternative economics at the University of Sydney Darlington Press&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated in the establishment of an [[Frank Stilwell (economist)|independent department of Political Economy]] at the [[University of Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams-Brooks, Llewellyn (2016) "Radical Theories of Capitalism in Australia: Towards a Historiography of the Australian New Left", Honours Thesis, University of Sydney, viewed 20 April 2017, https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/16655&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sydney.edu.au/arts/political_economy/ viewed 03/05/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Occupation of Alcatraz''' was an [[Occupation (protest)|occupation]] of [[Alcatraz Island]] by 89 American Indians and supporters, led by [[Richard Oakes (activist)|Richard Oakes]], LaNada Means, and others. They chose the name '''Indians of All Tribes''' (IOAT)&lt;ref name="doi=10.108"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/02773945.2014.888464|title=Détournement, Decolonization, and the American Indian Occupation of Alcatraz Island (1969–1971)|journal=Rhetoric Society Quarterly|volume=44|issue=2|pages=168|year=2014|last1=Kelly|first1=Casey Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Trudell]] was the spokesperson. According to the IOAT, under the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)]] between the U.S. and the Lakota, all retired, abandoned or out-of-use federal land was returned  to the Native people who once occupied it. Since Alcatraz penitentiary had been closed on March 21, 1963, and the island had been declared surplus federal property in 1964, a number of [[Red Power]] activists felt the island qualified for a reclamation.

The Alcatraz Occupation lasted for nineteen months, from November 20, 1969, to June 11, 1971, and was forcibly ended by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]]. The Occupation of Alcatraz had a brief but somewhat direct effect on federal Indian Termination policies, and established a precedent for Indian activism. Oakes was shot to death in 1972, and the [[American Indian Movement]] was later targeted by the federal government and the FBI in [[COINTELPRO]] operations.

== Background ==

On March 8, 1964, a small group of Sioux demonstrated by occupying the island for four hours.&lt;ref&gt;Warrior, Robert and Smith, Paul Chaat. ''Like a Hurricane: The Indian Movement from Alcatraz to Wounded Knee''. New Press, 1996. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The entire party consisted of about 40 people, including photographers, reporters and Elliot Leighton, the lawyer representing those claiming land stakes. According to [[Adam Fortunate Eagle]], this demonstration was an extension of already prevalent Bay Area street theater used to raise awareness. The Sioux activists were led by Richard McKenzie, Mark Martinez, Garfield Spotted Elk, Virgil Standing-Elk, Walter Means, and Allen Cottier. Cottier acted as spokesman for the demonstration, stating that it was "peaceful and in accordance with Sioux treaty rights." The protesters were publicly offering the federal government the same amount for the land that the government had initially offered them; at 47 cents per acre, this amounted to $9.40 for the entire rocky island, or $5.64 for the twelve usable acres. Cottier also stated that the federal government would be allowed to maintain use of the Coast Guard lighthouse located on the island. The protesters left under threat that they would be charged with felony. This incident resulted in increased media attention for indigenous peoples' protests across the Bay Area.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Fortunate Eagle, Adam. ''Alcatraz! Alcatraz! The Indian Occupation of 1969–1971''. Heyday Books, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Council of the Bay Area Indian community initially considered writing a proposal and filing an application for the use of Alcatraz by Sioux people under the conditions of their treaty. Plans were drawn up for using the buildings on Alcatraz as a cultural center. Conversations about handing Alcatraz over to developers for commercial development created concern about the future availability of the island. A desire for more immediate action to claim space for the local Indian community was finally spurred by the loss of the San Francisco Indian Center to fire on October 10, 1969.   The loss of the San Francisco Indian Center spurred action among indigenous peoples because of the importance it held within their community. The center provided Native Americans with jobs, health care, aid in legal affairs, and social opportunities. This detrimental loss happening on top of the Indians' already growing tension with the U.S. government prompted strategies&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Occupation of Alcatraz|last=Johnson|first=Troy|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for obtaining Alcatraz for use by the local Indian community shifted from formal applications to more immediate takeover.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1969, Adam Fortunate Eagle planned a symbolic occupation for November 9. University student leaders [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] [[Richard Oakes (activist)|Richard Oakes]] and Shoshone Bannock LaNada Means, head of the Native American Student Organization at the University of California, Berkeley,&lt;ref name="Donna Hightower Langston 2003"&gt;Donna Hightower Langston, "American Indian Women's Activism in the 1960s and 1970s," Hypatia 18, 2: 2003, 120.&lt;/ref&gt; with a larger group of student activists joined Fortunate Eagle.  A group of five boats was organized to take approximately 75 indigenous peoples over to the island, but none of the boats showed up. Adam Fortunate Eagle convinced Ronald Craig, the owner of the [[Endeavour II (barque)|Monte Cristo]], a three-masted yacht, to pass by the island when their own boats did not arrive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Oakes, Jim Vaughn ([[Cherokee]]), Joe Bill ([[Eskimo]]), Ross Harden ([[Ho-Chunk]]) and Jerry Hatch jumped overboard, swam to shore, and claimed the island by [[terra nullius|right of discovery]].&lt;ref name="earlylandings"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/itvs/alcatrazisnotanisland/landings.html|title=Retired Site - PBS Programs - PBS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coast Guard quickly removed the men, but later that day, a larger group made their way to the island again, and fourteen stayed overnight. The following day, Oakes delivered a proclamation, written by Fortunate Eagle, to the [[General Services Administration]] (GSA) which claimed the island by right of discovery, after which the group left the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Like a Hurricane|last=Smith and Warrior|publisher=The New Press|year=1996|location=New York|pages=2–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though recently many people have claimed that the [[American Indian Movement]] was somehow involved in the Takeover, AIM had nothing to do with the planning and execution of the Occupation, though they did send a delegation to Alcatraz in the early months in order to find out how the operation was accomplished and how things were progressing. {{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2012}}

== Occupation ==
[[File:Alcatraz-Grafitti-Yata-Hey.jpg|thumb|Graffiti from the occupation, featuring a [[Navajo language|Navajo]] greeting, "Yata Hey"]]
In the early morning hours of November 20, 1969, 89 American Indians, including over 30 women,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; students, married couples and six children, set out to occupy Alcatraz Island.&lt;ref name="doi=10.108" /&gt; A partially successful Coast Guard blockade prevented most of them from landing, but fourteen protesters landed on the island to begin their occupation. The island's lone guard, who had been warned of the impending occupation, sent out a message on his radio. “Mayday!  Mayday!” he called. “The Indians have landed!”&lt;ref name="We Hold the Rock"&gt;{{cite web|title=We Hold the Rock|url= https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/indiansalcatraz |website=The Attic|accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="occupation"&gt;{{cite web |people= |date= |title= https://www.pbs.org/itvs/alcatrazisnotanisland/occupation.html |url= https://www.pbs.org/itvs/alcatrazisnotanisland/occupation.html |access-date=2017-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20021222102053/http://www.pbs.org/itvs/alcatrazisnotanisland/occupation.html |archive-date= 2002-12-22 |publisher=[[PBS]]}} ''[The page still exists, but now says "Oops! You've reached a retired site page. PBS no longer has the rights to distribute the content that had been provided on this page."]''&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of the occupation there were 400 people.  Native and non-native people brought food and other necessary items to the people on the island, but the coast guard's blockades made it increasingly difficult to supply the occupants with food. The suppliers, after stealthily journeying across the bay via canoe, dropped off the supplies which then had to be carried up steep ladders.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt; The occupation lasted about 19 months but ended peacefully.&lt;ref name="occupation" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geographic|first=National|title=National Geographic Indian Nations of North American|year=2010|publisher=National Geographic|isbn=978-1-4262-0664-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An employee of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Doris Purdy, who was also an amateur photographer, accompanied a group who went on November 29, stayed the night and made a movie, which is available on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1md5YYKl-9g |title=Occupation of Alcatraz, 11-29-1969 |first=Doris |last=Purdy |date=27 November 2008 |publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protesters, predominantly students, drew inspiration and tactics from contemporary civil rights demonstrations, some of which they had themselves organized.  The original fourteen students who occupied the Island were LaNada Means War Jack, [[Richard Oakes (activist)|Richard Oakes]], Joe Bill, David Leach, John Whitefox, Ross Harden, Jim Vaughn, Linda Arayando, Bernell Blindman, Kay Many Horse, John Virgil, John Martell, Fred Shelton, and Rick Evening.  Jerry Hatch and Al Miller, both present at the initial landing but unable to leave the boat in the confusion after the Coast Guard showed up, quickly turned up in a private boat.  The first landing party was joined later by many others in the following days, including Joe Morris (a key player later as a representative of the Longshoreman's Union, which threatened to close both ports if the Occupiers were removed), and the man who would soon become "the Voice of Alcatraz," [[John Trudell]].

After a fire destroyed a San Francisco Indian center and Interior Secretary [[Walter J. Hickel]] offered to turn Alcatraz into a national park, the protesters mobilized.&lt;ref name="JohnsonRoots"&gt;Johnson, Troy R. "Roots of Contemporary Native American Activism," ''American Indian Culture and Research Journal,'' 20(2):127–154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kotlowski"&gt;Kotlowski, Dean J. "Alcatraz, Wounded Knee, and Beyond: The Nixon and Ford Administrations Respond to Native American Protest," ''Pacific Historical Review,'' 72(2):201–227.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although she would not receive the same recognition from mainstream media as Trudell and Oakes would, LaNada Means, who was one of the first to arrive and one of the last to leave, organized written statements and speeches that outlined the purpose of the occupation. To the media and to the federal government, Means made it clear that the occupiers wanted complete Indian control over the island, under the Treaty of Fort Laramie, for the purpose of building a cultural center that included Native American Studies, an American Indian spiritual center, an ecology center, and an American Indian Museum. According to Means' grant proposal, the center would include full-time Indian consultants, Indian teachers, Indian librarians, and an Indian staff leading people around the center in order to tell the story of Indians of All Tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Chaar Smith and Robert Allen Warrior, Like a Hurricane: The Indian Movement from Alcatraz to Wounded Knee, ( New York: The New Press, 1996), 76.&lt;/ref&gt;  The occupiers specifically cited their treatment under the [[Indian termination policy]] and they accused the U.S. government of breaking numerous [[Treaties of the United States#U.S. Native American treaties|Indian treaties]].

Richard Oakes sent a message to the [[San Francisco]] Department of the Interior:

{{quote|We invite the United States to acknowledge the justice of our claim. The choice now lies with the leaders of the American government – to use violence upon us as before to remove us from our Great Spirit's land, or to institute a real change in its dealing with the American Indian. We do not fear your threat to charge us with crimes on our land. We and all other oppressed peoples would welcome spectacle of proof before the world of your title by genocide. Nevertheless, we seek peace.&lt;ref name="occupation" /&gt;}}

President [[Richard Nixon]]'s Special Counsel [[Leonard Garment]] took over negotiations from the GSA.&lt;ref name="occupation" /&gt;

On [[Thanksgiving Day]], hundreds of supporters made their way to Alcatraz to celebrate the Occupation.&lt;ref name="occupation" /&gt; In December, one of the occupiers, [[Sioux#Isanti (Santee or Dakota)|Isani Sioux]] John Trudell, began making daily radio broadcasts from the island, and in January 1970, occupiers began publishing a newsletter. Joseph Morris, a [[Blackfoot]] member of the local [[longshoreman]]'s union, rented space on Pier 40 to facilitate the transportation of supplies and people to the island.&lt;ref name="occupation" /&gt;

Cleo Waterman (Seneca Nation) was president of the American Indian Center during the takeover. As an elder, she chose to stay behind and work on logistics to support the occupiers. She worked closely with Grace Thorpe and the singer Kay Starr to bring attention to the occupation and its purpose.

[[Grace Thorpe]], daughter of  [[Jim Thorpe]] ([[Sac and Fox Nation|Sac and Fox]]), was one of the occupiers and helped convince celebrities like [[Jane Fonda]], [[Anthony Quinn]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Jonathan Winters]], [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]] and [[Dick Gregory]], to visit the island and show their support.&lt;ref name="occupation" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Collapse and removal ==
On January 3, 1970, Yvonne Oakes, 13-year-old daughter of Annie and stepdaughter to Richard Oakes, fell to her death, prompting the Oakes family to leave the island, saying they just didn't have the heart for it anymore.&lt;ref name="occupation" /&gt; Some of the original occupiers left to return to school, and some of the new occupiers had drug addictions. Some non-aboriginal members of San Francisco's drug and hippie scene also moved to the island, until non-Indians were prohibited from staying overnight.&lt;ref name="occupation" /&gt;

In an interview with "Radio Free Alcatraz", occupant and Sioux Indian, John Trudell, lamented of how, "water [was] still [their] big number one problem, and how "rapidly, [their] number two problem [was] becoming electricity". The government often shut off all electricity to the island, as well as made it difficult for water to reach the occupants in an effort to make them desert the island.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

After Oakes left, LaNada Means, John Trudell and Stella Leach were challenged with rebuilding the occupation's worsening reputation. Means, having been in a family that was always active in tribal politics, was comfortable briefing reporters on how reservations operated or directing occupiers on island clean up.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Chaar Smith and Robert Allen Warrior, ''Like a Hurricane: The Indian Movement from Alcatraz to Wounded Knee'', ( New York: The New Press, 1996), 72.&lt;/ref&gt; So when Robert Robertson, a Republican working for the [[National Council on Indian Opportunity]], arrived on the island in 1970, just a week after Yvonne Oakes' passing, Means took the lead in trying to negotiate the grant for the cultural center. Along with Means, Robertson originally met with a group of occupiers to discuss safety and negotiations regarding the occupation. He was surprised that only ten men were present while forty American Indian women were present and active in discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Chaar Smith and Robert Allen Warrior, Like a Hurricane: The Indian Movement from Alcatraz to Wounded Knee, ( New York: The New Press, 1996), 73.&lt;/ref&gt; When the initial meeting ended, Means had invited Robertson to a private dinner between herself and three lawyers to propose a $500,000 grant to renovate the island.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Chaar Smith and Robert Allen Warrior, Like a Hurricane: The Indian Movement from Alcatraz to Wounded Knee, ( New York: The New Press, 1996), 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson, however, refused and would continue to refuse the occupiers' proposals until finally, in May 1970 the federal government began to transfer Alcatraz to the Department of the Interior and the National Park System.

LaNada Means attempted to find different routes to support Indians of All Tribes and those still on Alcatraz. Means believed that if she could hire a high-profile attorney to represent their claim for the Treaty of Fort Laramie, IOAT would win their case. However, as she travelled further and further away from the island to find supporters, rumors began that she was offered a screen test with a movie producer, therefore becoming an opportunist. When she returned she had found that Trudell and the occupation's attorney's disagreed with her approach. Ultimately, the remaining occupiers followed Trudell.&lt;ref&gt;LaNada Boyer, "Reflections of Alcatraz," American Indian Culture and Research Journal 18 (1994): 87.&lt;/ref&gt; These opposing views between Means and Trudell are only one simple example of the power struggle that was one of the main reasons for the demise of the occupation. Comanche Indian Paul Chaat Smith, who works as an associate curator at the National Museum of the American Indian, speaks from personal experience that Indian leaders are often not united; and frequently let power get in the way of the change they wish to make. This proved true in the Occupation of Alcatraz when the operation turned out to not be as united as the occupants first hoped it to be. Their demands proved contradictory of each other, and their inability to see past differences and compromise proved detrimental to the occupation of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Like a Hurricane|last=Smith|first=Paul|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By late May, the government had cut off all electrical power and all telephone service to the island. In June,
a fire of disputed origin destroyed numerous buildings on the island.&lt;ref name="occupation" /&gt; Left without power, fresh water, and in the face of diminishing public support and sympathy, the number of occupiers began to dwindle. On June 11, 1971, a large force of government officers removed the remaining 15 people from the island.&lt;ref name="occupation" /&gt;

Though fraught with controversy and forcibly ended, the Occupation is hailed by many as a success for having attained international attention for the situation of native peoples in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Alcatraz Is Not An Island|last=Blue Cloud|first=Peter|year=1972 |publisher= Wingbow Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for sparking more than 200 instances of civil disobedience among Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Occupation of Alcatraz Island|last=Johnson|first=Troy R.|year=1996 |publisher=Illini-University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana &amp; Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
The Occupation of Alcatraz had a direct effect on federal Indian policy and, with its visible results, established a precedent for Indian activism. “Alcatraz has unified Indians for a second time,” one occupier told the Los Angeles Times. “The first time was against Custer.”&lt;ref name="We Hold the Rock"/&gt;

Robert Robertson, director of the National Council on Indian Opportunity (NCIO), was sent to negotiate with the protesters. His offer to build a park on the island for Indian use was rejected, as the IAT were determined to possess the entire island, and hoped to build a cultural center there. While the Nixon administration did not accede to the demands of the protesters, it was aware of the delicate nature of the situation, and so could not forcibly remove them. Spurred in part by [[Spiro Agnew]]'s support for Native American rights, federal policy began to progress away from termination and toward Indian autonomy. In Nixon's July 8, 1970 Indian message, he decried termination, proclaiming, "self-determination among Indian people can and must be encouraged without the threat of eventual termination." While this was a step toward substantial reform, the administration was hindered by its bureaucratic mentality, unable to change its methodical approach of dealing with Indian rights. Nixon's attitude toward Indian affairs soured with the November 2, 1972 occupation of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA). Nixon reputedly felt betrayed and claimed that "he was through doing things to help Indians."

Much of the Indian rights activism of the period can be traced to the Occupation of Alcatraz. The [[Trail of Broken Treaties]], the BIA occupation, the [[Wounded Knee incident]], and the [[Longest Walk#The Longest Walk and The Longest Walk 2|Longest Walk]] all have their roots in the occupation. The American Indian Movement noted from their visit to the occupation that the demonstration garnered national attention, while those involved faced no punitive action. When AIM members seized the Mayflower II on Thanksgiving, 1970, the Occupation of Alcatraz was noted as "the symbol of a newly awakened desire among Indians for unity and authority in a white world."&lt;ref name=JohnsonRoots /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kotlowski /&gt; The occupation of Alcatraz Island served as a strong symbol and uniting force for indigenous peoples everywhere because of the importance the island held in their ancestors' lives. Indians traveled to Alcatraz about 10,000 years before the Europeans even entered the Bay area. Over the course of their history, the island served the purpose of a camping ground, was used as a place to hunt for food, and at one point became an isolated and remote place for law violators were held. The occupation which began in 1969 caused Native Americans to remember what the island meant to them as a people.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt; Although the Alcatraz occupation inspired many other Pan-Indian movements to occur, it also showed how gender played a part in Indian activism. Mainstream media had an obsession with documenting the stereotype of the male Indian warrior and as such it was only the men that were highlighted as being the leaders and creators of movements.&lt;ref&gt;Donna Hightower Langston, "American Indian Women's Activism in the 1960s and 1970s," Hypatia 18, 2: 2003, 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Women such as LaNada Means, Stella Leach and the other women at Alcatraz receive little attention for contributing to the movement. As a result, the many women who had initiated movements such as Wounded Knee Incident would never be as well known as Russell Means and other AIM leaders, even though, in the case of Wounded Knee, of the 350 occupiers, just 100 were men.&lt;ref&gt;Donna Hightower Langston, "American Indian Women's Activism in the 1960s and 1970s," Hypatia 18, 2: 2003, 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Quoted in John William Sayer's ''Ghost Dancing the Law: The Wounded Knee Trials'', John Trudell admitted, in reflection, "We got lost in our manhood."&lt;ref&gt;John William Sayer, Ghost Dancing the Law: The Wounded Knee Trials (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1997), 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacies ==
Some 50 of the Alcatraz occupiers traveled to the East Bay and began an occupation of an abandoned and dilapidated [[Nike Missile]] installation located in the hills behind the community of [[Kensington, California|Kensington]] in June 1971.  This occupation was ended after three days by a combined force of [[Richmond, California|Richmond]] Police and regular US Army troops from the [[Presidio of San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;Berkeley Gazette, June 15–18, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Alcatraz Occupation greatly influenced the American government's decision to end its Indian termination policy and to pass the [[Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975]].&lt;ref name="occupation" /&gt;

The Alcatraz Occupation led to an annual celebration of the rights of indigenous people, [[Unthanksgiving day]], welcome all visitors to a dawn ceremony under permits by the National Park Service.

In March 1970, a [[Seattle]]-based group called the [[United Indians of All Tribes]] (re-)occupied [[Fort Lawton]], demanding the return of Indigenous lands that were about to be declared surplus. The organization and their action was expressly modelled on the Indians of All Tribes and the occupation of Alcatraz. [[Bernie Whitebear]], one of those involved, stated that "We saw what could be achieved there and if it had not been for their determined effort on Alcatraz, there would have been no movement here. We would like to think that Alcatraz lives on in part through Ft. Lawton."&lt;ref name="Johnson1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Troy R.|title=The Occupation of Alcatraz Island: Indian Self-determination and the Rise of Indian Activism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3M6Nhi5Pu1EC&amp;pg=PA223|accessdate=8 February 2016|year=1996|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-06585-9|pages=223–224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Oxford Almanack''''' is an annual [[almanac]] published by the [[Oxford University Press]] for the [[University of Oxford]] since 1674.&lt;ref name="hibbert"&gt;{{cite book | title=[[The Encyclopaedia of Oxford]] | publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] | chapter=Oxford Almanacks | year=1988 | pages=298–299 | isbn=0-333-39917-X | editor-last=Hibbert|editor-first=Christopher |editor-link=Christopher Hibbert }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oxford University Press originally held a monopoly on publishing almanacs. The almanacs traditionally included engravings and information about Oxford University, including the Heads of Colleges and a university [[calendar]]. No almanack appeared in 1675, but it has been published annually since 1676.&lt;ref name="hibbert" /&gt;

Engravers and artists have included [[James Basire]], [[Michael Burghers]], [[J. M. W. Turner]], and [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]].

==List of almanacks since 1992==
Petter's ''The Oxford Almanacks'' lists the scenes depicted and their illustrators up to 1973, and the list is continued to 1991 in Bradshaw's article in ''Oxoniensia'' (see Further Reading for both references).

[[File:Phrase book.jpg|thumb|Phrase book.]]

A '''phrase book''' or '''phrasebook''' is a collection of ready-made [[phrase]]s, usually for a [[foreign language]] along with a [[translation]], [[index (publishing)|indexed]] and often in the form of questions and answers.

== Structure ==
While mostly thematically structured into several [[Chapter (books)|chapters]] like ''interpersonal relationships'', ''food'', ''at the doctor'', ''shopping'' etc., a phrase book often contains useful background information regarding the travel destination's [[culture]], customs and conventions besides simple [[pronunciation]] guidelines and typically 1000–2000 words covering vocabulary.
Also common are a concise [[grammar]] and an [[Index (publishing)|index]] intended for quick reference.

A phrase book generally features high clarity and a practical, sometimes color-coded structure to enable its user to communicate in a quick and easy, though very basic, manner. Especially with this in mind a phrase book sometimes also provides several possible answers to each question, to let a person respond in part by pointing at one of them. Additional [[Content (media and publishing)|audio]] material is often included to help pronunciation and comprehension. This kind of phrase books is often referred to as a [[talking phrase book]] or [[voice translator]].

==History==
[[File:Elizabeth I's primer on Irish.jpg|thumb|Elizabeth I's Irish and Latin primer, 1560-1580]]
Hand-written phrase books were used in Mediaeval Europe by pilgrims to the [[Holy Land]]; major European languages, Greek, and Hebrew were covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 15th century, phrase books designed for merchants involved in the international trade are attested as well. The earliest known example of this genre is a 1424 manuscript compiled by one Master George of [[Nuremberg]], and intended to help Italian merchants to use [[High German languages|High German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Printed phrase books appeared by the late 15th century, exemplified by the ''Good Boke to Lerne to Speke French'' (ca. 1493-1496).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item126612.html|title=Medieval phrase book|website=www.bl.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asia, phrase books were compiled for the travelers on the [[Silk Road]] already in the first millennium AD, such as a [[Dunhuang manuscripts|Dunhuang manuscript]] (Pelliot chinois 5538) containing a set of useful [[Saka language|Saka]] ("Khotanese") and [[Sanskrit]] phrases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idpuk.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/phrasebooks-for-silk-route-travellers.html|title=Phrasebooks for Silk Route Travellers|website=idpuk.blogspot.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notes ==

[[James Thurber]] wrote a satirical essay, "There's No Place Like Home," concerning a phrase book he came across in a London bookstore "Collin's Pocket Interpreters: France." The essay appeared in The New Yorker of August 14, 1937,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thurber |first1=James |title=There's No Place Like Home |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1937/08/14/theres-no-place-like-home |work=The New Yorker |date=14 August 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was later collected in his book My World and Welcome To It.&lt;ref&gt;My World and Welcome To It, Harcourt Brace &amp; Company, 1937, p.300&lt;/ref&gt;

The British comedian group ''[[Monty Python]]'' featured a phrase book containing wrong translations in two of their sketches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orangecow.org/pythonet/sketches/hungry.htm|title=Monty Python Sketch: Dirty Hungarian Phrasebook|website=orangecow.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418074642/http://orangecow.org/pythonet/sketches/hungry.htm|archivedate=2007-04-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orangecow.org/pythonet/sketches/hungry.htm#court|title=Monty Python Sketch: Court (phrasebook)|website=orangecow.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418074642/http://orangecow.org/pythonet/sketches/hungry.htm#court|archivedate=2007-04-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Dirty Hungarian Phrasebook]].) ''[[English as She is Spoke]]'' is a comic classic of unwittingly incompetent translation.

The expression "[[My postillion has been struck by lightning]]", supposedly included in some phrasebooks, is used to describe some of the less likely to be useful phrases found in some books. [[Dirk Bogarde]] published a memoir with this title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Postillion Struck by Lightning|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/761601.A_Postillion_Struck_by_Lightning|orig-year=1997|date=2009|first=Dirk|last=Bogarde|authorlink=Dirk Bogarde|publisher=Phoenix|isbn= 978-0753819302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1972 short story by [[Joanna Russ]], "Useful Phrases for the Tourist", takes the form of an excerpt from a phrase book. Since its initial appearance it has been reprinted nine times, and has been translated into [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?57756|title=Title: Useful Phrases for the Tourist|website=www.isfdb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phrasebooks exist not only for living languages, but also for languages that are no longer spoken natively by anyone, such as [[Meissner's Latin Phrasebook]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8029">In [[computer science]], '''polymorphic recursion''' (also referred to as '''Milner&amp;ndash;Mycroft typability''' or the '''Milner&amp;ndash;Mycroft calculus''') refers to a [[recursion (computer science)|recursive]] [[parametric polymorphism|parametrically polymorphic]] [[function (computer science)|function]] where the type parameter changes with each recursive invocation made, instead of staying constant. [[Type inference]] for polymorphic recursion is equivalent to [[semi-unification]] and therefore [[undecidable problem|undecidable]] and requires the use of a [[semi-algorithm]] or programmer supplied [[type annotation]]s.{{sfn|Henglein|1993}}

== Example ==
=== Nested datatypes ===
Consider the following [[nested datatype]]:
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
data Nested a = a :&lt;: (Nested [a]) | Epsilon
infixr 5 :&lt;:

nested = 1 :&lt;: [2,3,4] :&lt;: [[4,5],[7],[8,9]] :&lt;: Epsilon
&lt;/source&gt;

A length function defined over this datatype will be polymorphically recursive, as the type of the argument changes from &lt;code&gt;Nested a&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Nested [a]&lt;/code&gt; in the recursive call:
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
length :: Nested a -&gt; Int
length Epsilon    = 0
length (_ :&lt;: xs) = 1 + length xs
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] normally infers the [[type signature]] for a function as simple-looking as this, but here it cannot be omitted without triggering a type error.

=== Higher-ranked types ===

== Applications ==

=== Program analysis ===
In [[type-based program analysis]] polymorphic recursion is often essential in gaining high precision of the analysis. Notable examples of systems employing polymorphic recursion include Dussart, Henglein and Mossin's [[binding-time analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Polymorphic Recursion and Subtype Qualifications: Polymorphic Binding-Time Analysis in Polynomial Time|first1=Dirk|last1=Dussart|first2=Fritz|last2=Henglein|authorlink2=Fritz Henglein|first3=Christian|last3=Mossin|journal=Proceedings of the 2nd International Static Analysis Symposium (SAS)|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Tofte&amp;ndash;Talpin [[region-based memory management]] system.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite conference |url= |title=Implementation of the Typed Call-by-Value λ-calculus using a Stack of Regions |last1=Tofte |first1=Mads |authorlink1=Mads Tofte |last2=Talpin |first2=Jean-Pierre |authorlink2=Jean-Pierre Talpin |year=1994 |booktitle=POPL '94: Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT symposium on Principles of programming languages |publisher=ACM |location=New York, NY, USA |pages=188&amp;ndash;201 |isbn=0-89791-636-0 |doi=10.1145/174675.177855}}
&lt;/ref&gt; As these systems assume the expressions have already been typed in an underlying type system (not necessary employing polymorphic recursion), inference can be made decidable again.

=== Data structures, error detection, graph solutions ===

Functional programming data structures often use polymorphic recursion to simplify type error checks and solve problems with nasty "middle" temporary solutions that devour memory in more traditional data structures such as trees. In the two citations that follow, Okasaki (pp.&amp;nbsp;144–146) gives a CONS example in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] wherein the polymorphic type system automatically flags programmer errors.&lt;ref name="Purely Functional Data Structures"&gt;{{cite book |isbn= 978-0521663502|url= https://www.amazon.com/Purely-Functional-Structures-Chris-Okasaki/dp/0521663504/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1397922548&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=polymorphic+recursion |title=Purely Functional Data Structures |author=Chris Okasaki |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge| year=1999 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recursive aspect is that the type definition assures that the outermost constructor has a single element, the second a pair, the third a pair of pairs, etc. recursively, setting an automatic error finding pattern in the data type. Roberts (p.&amp;nbsp;171) gives a related example in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], using a [[Class (computer programming)|Class]] to represent a stack frame. The example given is a solution to the [[Tower of Hanoi]] problem wherein a stack simulates polymorphic recursion with a beginning, temporary and ending nested stack substitution structure.&lt;ref name="Thinking Recursively with Java"&gt;{{cite book |isbn= 978-0471701460|url= https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Recursively-Java-Eric-Roberts/dp/0471701467/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1397925147&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=thinking+recursively+with+java |title=Thinking Recursively with Java |author=Eric Roberts |location=New York |publisher=Wiley| year=2006 |page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to his arrest he was the editor of ''[[Alma-Ata Info]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Журналистерді қорғау комитеті Рамазан Есіргеповті түрмеден босатуға шақырды|url=http://www.azattyq.org/content/Kazakhstan_taraz_ramazan_esirgepov_prison_hunger_strike__prosecutor/2095504.html|date=2010-07-09|periodical=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (Azattyq)|accessdate=2011-04-20|first=Kenzhebek|last=Nurqasenuly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Yesergepov is married to Raushan Yesergepova.&lt;ref name="CAO"&gt;{{citation|url=http://centralasiaonline.com/cocoon/caii/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/caii/newsbriefs/2010/07/30/newsbrief-05|periodical=Central Asia Online|date=2010-07-30|accessdate=2011-04-20|last=Rogers|first=Stan|title=Ramazan Yesergepov appeals to UN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Yesergepov founded ''Alma-Ata Info'' in 2005. In 2006, the newspaper was charged under Administrative Code Article 342 for alleged violations of the law on mass media; namely, the Almaty City Council claimed that the newspaper had changed its thematic focus but failed to register the change with the government. The newspaper faced a maximum fine of [[Kazakhstani tenge|T]]206,000 (roughly US$1600). Yesergepov believed the real reason for the charges was retaliation for articles criticising the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ifex.org/kazakhstan/2006/04/11/alma_ata_info_newspaper_facing/|date=2006-04-11|title='Alma-ata info' newspaper facing charges|periodical=Adil Soz|accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, Yesergepov published a piece entitled "Who Rules the Country: President or National Security Committee?", featuring private correspondence from the chief of the Jambyl Regional Department of the [[National Security Committee of the Republic of Kazakhstan|National Security Committee]]. The NSC then listed the document as classified information, and ordered Yesergepov to reveal his sources. Around the same time, Yesergepov suffered an [[infarction]] and went to obtain medical care; due to his hospitalisation, he did not attend an interrogation as ordered, even after his release from hospital.&lt;ref name="Ferghana20090111"&gt;{{citation|url=http://enews.fergananews.com/news.php?id=929|periodical=[[Ferghana Information Agency]]|title=Kazakhstan: Journalist Ramazan Yesergepov faces the prospect of spending the next 8 years behind the bars|date=2009-01-11|accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and imprisonment==
On 6 January 2009, officers of the NSC's Jambyl department detained Yesergepov on charges of "unlawful compilation and proliferation of information containing state secrets" and "abuse of position". The initial charges were brought under Penal Code Article 172 Part 2, carrying a maximum sentence of three years.&lt;ref name="Ferghana20090111"/&gt; However, the Taraz District Court #2 then decided to charge Yesergepov under Part 4 of the same article instead, meaning that he could face up to eight years in prison.&lt;ref name="Ferghana20090111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AdilSoz20100714"&gt;{{citation|title=Parole of chiefe editor of newspaper «Alma-Ata Info» Ramazan Yesergepov was dismissed|url=http://www.adilsoz.kz/en/newsen/parole-of-chief-editor-of-newspaper-alma-ata-info-ramazan-yesergepov-was-dismissed/|periodical=Adil Soz|date=2010-07-14|accessdate=2011-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009 he was sentenced to three years in prison; the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of Kazakhstan|Supreme Court]] rejected an appeal to investigate the legality of the decision.&lt;ref name="SeattleTimes"&gt;{{citation|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2009652242_apaskazakhstanjailededitor.html|periodical=Seattle Times|date=2009-08-13|accessdate=2011-04-20|title=Kazakhstan court refuses to free jailed editor|last=Leonard|first=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yesergepov's case returned to the Taraz court, which upheld the original sentence in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=Reuters|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2009/10/22/idINIndia-43365920091022|date=2009-10-22|accessdate=2011-04-20|title=Kazakhstan court rejects jailed journalist's appeal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yesergepov was imprisoned at Taraz Standard Regime Penal Colony #158/2. He applied for parole in January 2010; when that request was denied, he requested transfer to a lesser-security [[colony-settlement]] instead, which was also refused.&lt;ref name="AdilSoz20100927"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.adilsoz.kz/en/newsen/administrative-commission-has-denied-transfer-to-penal-colony-settlement-to-ramazan-yesergepov/|periodical=Adil Soz|title=Administrative Commission has denied transfer to penal colony settlement to Ramazan Yesergepov|date=2010-09-27|accessdate=2011-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Административная комиссия отказала Рамазану Есергепову в переводе в колонию-поселение|periodical=Adil Soz|date=2010-10-04|accessdate=2011-04-20|url=http://www.adilsoz.kz/news/administrativnaya-komissiya-otkazala-ramazanu-esergepovu-v-perevode-v-koloniyu-poselenie/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 June 2010, he announced his intention to go on [[hunger strike]].&lt;ref name="AdilSoz20100630"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.adilsoz.kz/news/glavnyj-redaktor-gazety-alma-ata-info-ramazan-esergepov-nameren-obyavit-golodovku/|periodical=Adil Soz|date=2010-06-30|accessdate=2011-04-21|title=Главный редактор газеты «Алма-Ата ИНФО» Рамазан Есергепов намерен объявить голодовку}}&lt;/ref&gt; His hunger strike lasted until 11 July. Two days later, his next request for parole was also denied.&lt;ref name="AdilSoz20100714"/&gt; At the end of that month, his wife delivered an appeal from her husband to Viktoriya Tiuneleva of the NGO Kazakhstani Bureau for Human Rights, to be forwarded to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]].&lt;ref name="CAO"/&gt; In September 2010, another application of Yesergepov's for transfer to a colony-settlement was denied.&lt;ref name="AdilSoz20100927"/&gt;

==Response to imprisonment==
The case against Yesergepov led to condemnation by Kazakhstani opposition party [[Azat party|Azat]], which called his arrest an attempt to intimidate journalists.&lt;ref name="SeattleTimes"/&gt; Local newspaper ''Adil Soz'' stated that Yesergepov did not receive a [[public trial]], violating Criminal Procedural Code Article 17.&lt;ref name="AdilSoz20100630"/&gt; A number of international organisations also condemned the matter. The [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], to which Kazakhstan had submitted a bid for chairmanship, stated that Yesergepov's imprisonment "violated international standards and Kazakhstan's commitments on media freedom", and sent a letter of protest to the Kazakhstani government.&lt;ref name="SeattleTimes"/&gt; The New York-based [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] accused Kazakhstan's government of undermining the OSCE through human rights violation at home; [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Kazakhstan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] spokesman [[Ilyas Omarov]] stated in response that no OSCE member state had complained to his ministry over the matter, and that Kazakhstan had a "healthy media environment" run primarily by private companies rather than state bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=Eurasianet.org|last=Lillis|first=Joanna|title=Kazakhstan: Media Watchdog Raps Astana's Rights Record|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/61936|date=2010-09-15|accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] also pointed to the case as an example of Kazakhstan's "chilling environment for freedom of expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=Daily Times of Pakistan|title=Rights group raps Kazakh record before OSCE summit|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2010%5C12%5C01%5Cstory_1-12-2010_pg14_4|date=2010-12-01|accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ravin v. State''''', 537 P.2d 494 (Ak. 1975),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Ravin v. State |vol=537 |reporter=P.2d |opinion=494 |pinpoint= |court=Ak. |date=1975 |url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1170252/ravin-v-state/ |accessdate=2018-06-03 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a 1975 decision by the [[Alaska Supreme Court]] that held the [[Constitution of Alaska|Alaska Constitution]]'s right to [[privacy]] protects an adult's ability to use and possess a small amount of marijuana in the home for personal use.{{sfn|Brandeis|2012|p=175}} The Alaska Supreme Court thereby became the first—and only—state or federal court to announce a constitutional privacy right that protects some level of marijuana use and possession.{{sfn|Brandeis|2012|p=175}}

==History==
It was brought about by Irwin Ravin, an attorney who deliberately got arrested in [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] for refusing to sign a traffic ticket while in possession of marijuana in order to challenge the existing law. Ravin felt that the case was more about privacy, saying 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marijuana has never been an issue for me. The fight was always for privacy, our territory and now state has traditionally been the home of people who prize their individuality and who have chosen to achieve a measure of control over their own lifestyles which is now virtually unattainable in many of our sister states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homernews.com/stories/041410/news_1_003.shtml |title=Friends, family pay tribute to man who fought for individual's right to privacy '&amp;#39;Michael Armstrong, Homer News, 4-14-10 |publisher=Homernews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The court ruled:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Doug Linder |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/ravin.html |title=Ravin v State |publisher=Law.umkc.edu |date=1975-05-27 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...we conclude that no adequate justification for the state's intrusion into the citizen's right to privacy by its prohibition of possession of marijuana by an adult for personal consumption in the home has been shown. The privacy of the individual's home cannot be breached absent a persuasive showing of a close and substantial relationship of the intrusion to a legitimate governmental interest. Here, mere scientific doubts will not suffice. The state must demonstrate a need based on proof that the public health or welfare will in fact suffer if the controls are not applied.}}

==Subsequent law==
Alaskan voters approved a [[Alaska Measure 2 (1990)|ballot initiative recriminalizing marijuana possession in 1990]], but in ''[[Noy v. State]]'', the Alaska Court of Appeals held that ballot initiatives are subject to the same constitutional limitations as legislative enactments, and thus the portion of the amended statutes criminalizing possession of less than four ounces of marijuana in the home was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="Story"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Noy v. State |vol=83 |reporter=P.3d |opinion=538 |pinpoint= |court=Ak. App. |date=2003 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17763301345063946977 |accessdate=2018-06-03 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2006, the Alaska Legislature amended the law to prohibit the possession of more than one ounce of marijuana and to make possession of more than one ounce of marijuana a class A misdemeanor.&lt;ref name=ACLU&gt;{{cite court |litigants=State v. American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska |vol=204 |reporter=P.3d |opinion=364 |pinpoint= |court=Ak. |date=2009 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=245698136814114591 |accessdate=2018-06-03 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2006, Juneau Superior Court Judge Patricia Collins struck down the law, ruling it unconstitutional. In April 2009, in a 3-2 ruling, the Supreme Court of Alaska vacated the lower court's ruling, finding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue in the first place.&lt;ref name=ACLU/&gt;

In November 2014, Alaskan voters approved a ballot measure to legalize the possession and sale of marijuana, regulating it in a manner similar to alcohol sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Caldwell|first1=Suzanna|last2=Andrews|first2=Laurel|title=Alaskans vote to legalize marijuana|url=http://www.adn.com/article/20141104/alaskans-vote-legalize-marijuana|accessdate=5 November 2014|publisher=Alaska Dispatch News|date=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sunderland Museum and Winter Gardens''' is a municipal museum in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], [[England]]. It contains the only known British example of a gliding reptile, the oldest known vertebrate capable of gliding flight. The exhibit was discovered in Eppleton quarry.  The museum has a Designated Collection of national importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/ne000032|title=Sunderland Museum and Winter Gardens - Culture24|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was established in 1846, in the Athenaeum Building on Fawcett Street, the first municipally funded museum in the country outside [[London]].  The first recorded fine art acquisition was commissioned by the Sunderland Corporation, a painting of the opening of the new South Dock in 1850. This may have been  the first time that an artwork was commissioned by a town council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/galleries/collections/sunderland-museum-winter-gardens-1333/foreword|title=Sunderland Museum &amp; Winter Gardens - Art UK Art UK - Visit Collection Sunderland Museum &amp; Winter Gardens|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1879, the Museum moved to a new larger building next to [[Mowbray Park]] including a library and winter garden based on the model of the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]]. U.S. President [[Ulysses Grant]] was in attendance at the laying of the foundation stone by Alderman Samuel Storey in 1877. The building opened in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sunderlandecho.com/lifestyle/retro/what-s-the-sunderland-link-between-72-birds-12-fish-and-ulysses-s-grant-1-8535679&lt;/ref&gt; 

During World War II, Winter Garden was damaged by a parachute mine in 1941 and was later demolished with a 1960s extension taking its place, but in 2001 a lottery funded refurbishment of the Museum created a new Winter Garden extension and improved facilities. 

The Winter Gardens contain over 2,000 flowers and plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcastlegateshead.com/things-to-do/sunderland-museum-and-winter-gardens-p25721|title=Sunderland Museum and Winter Gardens - Museum in Sunderland, Sunderland - NewcastleGateshead|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2003, the Museum was recognised as the most attended outside London. 

The Museum contains a large collection of the locally made [[Sunderland Lustreware]] pottery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seeitdoitsunderland.co.uk/sunderland-museum-winter-gardens/collections|title=Collections at Sunderland Museum &amp; Winter Gardens - See it Do it Sunderland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other highlights of the Museum are a stuffed Lion which was acquired in 1879,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/features/columnists/mikeamos/mikeamos/11489863.Saving_grace/|title=Saving grace|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the remains of a [[walrus]] brought back from Siberia in the 1880s and the first [[Nissan]] car to be made in Sunderland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.100objectsne.co.uk/objects/view/62&lt;/ref&gt; Also featured are the skeletal remains of a male human being.

The library moved in 1995 to the new City Library and Arts Centre on Fawcett Street (occupying part of the former Binns Department Store).  The relocation left more space for museum exhibitions.  The new City Library Arts Centre also houses the [[Northern Gallery for Contemporary Art]], renowned as one of the leading forums for emerging artists in the North of England.

[[John Morrison (writer)|John Morrison]] wrote an affectionate memoir of the two and a half years he spent working in the museum as a junior curator, starting about 1918, which appeared in the Australian literary journal ''Overland'' in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;John Morrison, “Blue and Yellow Macaw,” ''Overland'', 40, 1968, pp.17-19. Reprinted in, John Morrison, ''The Happy Warrior'' (1987), Fairfield (Victoria), Pascoe Publishing, pp.137-41. {{ISBN|0-947087-08-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[L.S. Lowry]] described his discovery of Sunderland in 1960, after which it became his second home: "One day I was travelling south from [[Tyneside]] and I realised this was what I had always been looking for." 

Sunderland Museum, with six works and 30 on long-term loan, have a collection surpassed only by [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] and [[Manchester]].

The '''TARIC code''' (TARif Intégré Communautaire; Integrated Tariff of the European Communities) is designed to show the various rules applying to specific products when imported into the [[European Union|EU]]. This includes the provisions of the [[Harmonized System|harmonised system]] and the [[Combined Nomenclature|combined nomenclature]] but also additional provisions specified in Community legislation such as [[tariff suspensions]], [[tariff quotas]] and [[tariff preferences]], which exist for the majority of the Community’s trading partners. In trade with third countries, the 10-digit Taric code must be used in [[customs]] and statistical declarations.

==Challenges in classification for companies==
A proper classification can save huge amount of money for the company, which is why nowadays importers and exporters strive to find a perfect way to solve those problems:
# Variety of products---Companies who do import and export meet challenges of how to classify products with the growing varieties of products. Classification and restrictions, to some extent, has a bad effect on free trading and growing of business.
# Risk of loss caused by difference in classification---Firstly, the proper classification of your item is essential to determine any licensing requirements under the Export Administration Regulations(EAR), EU Dual Use Regulation 428/2009. And subsequently exporters and importers need to be aware of how to classify the products accordingly and which category should be classified to. And finally they may be required to obtain a license.  A slight difference in classification can mean a huge difference in the duties that are paid.

==Overview==
TARIC builds upon the international [[Harmonized System|harmonised system]]

The catalog has a title index of approximately 2,000 films. Approximately one-tenth of those are Irish productions. The remainder, produced outside Ireland, are films about Ireland and the [[Irish diaspora]]. About one-half of the titles are [[United States|American]] films; another quarter are [[Australia]]n and [[United Kingdom|British]] films.

==Arrangement of information==
Films are grouped by country of origin, then by chronology within each nationality. Many entries have extensive detail including production credits, actors with role names, narrative synopsis, production and distribution companies, running time, color process, sound system, literary source and review citations.&lt;ref name="BK2"/&gt;

===Inclusion criteria===
For non-Irish productions, the reason for inclusion usually is obvious, such as a setting in Ireland or a story about people of Irish heritage. Films set in other countries also qualify if shot in Ireland. Even one Irish character in a film’s story qualifies that film for inclusion, such as Brigid O’Shaughnessy (played by [[Mary Astor]]) in [[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]] (1941).

All films about [[John F. Kennedy]] are included, even those in which that historical character doesn’t appear; for example, the book has a detailed entry for [[Executive Action (film)|Executive Action]], a fictional story about a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy.

[[Back to the Future]] (1985) has a detailed entry, owing to a scene in the Diner at the beginning when local bully Biff Tannan refers to Marty's father as 'Irish' in a derogatory fashion. [[Popeye Doyle]] (played by [[Gene Hackman]]) in [[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]] likewise qualifies as an Irish character; in the movie Doyle remarks 'kiss my Irish ass!' after he has got drunk on whiskey with a friendly French waiter.

===Additional indexes===
In addition to the index of film titles, the book also has the following indexes:
* Personal Names
* Corporate Names
* Composers and Songwriters
* Literary and Dramatic Sources

==Reception==
[[Filmmaker]] [[Bob Quinn (Irish filmmaker)|Bob Quinn]] stated the book is "''an extraordinary opus ... Rockett is an excellent and painstaking scholar. Never before has anybody attempted to document in one volume every film ever made in or about Ireland. ... The amount of detail he has unearthed is no less than stupendous. ... The nearest literary analogy I can think of is Dineen's Irish Dictionary''",&lt;ref name="TCD"&gt;{{cite web

He writes of the book's nearly two thousand entries and makes note of its comprehensive nature, concluding that it "''is clearly an essential reference for libraries and will be sought by film buffs.''"&lt;ref name="NFSA"&gt;{{cite web

"'''Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius'''" is a [[short story]] by the 20th-century [[Argentina|Argentine]] writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]]. The story was first published in the Argentine journal ''[[Sur (magazine)|Sur]]'', May [[1940 in literature|1940]]. The "postscript" dated 1947 is intended to be [[anachronism|anachronistic]], set seven years in the future. The first [[English language|English-language]] translation of the story was published in [[1961 in literature|1961]].

Told in a first-person narrative, the story focuses on the author's discovery of the mysterious and apparently fictional world of Tlön, whose inhabitants believe a form of [[subjective idealism]], denying the reality of the world, and speak in a language lacking [[nouns]]. Relatively long for Borges (approximately 5,600 words), the story is a work of [[speculative fiction]].

The story alludes to many leading intellectual figures both in Argentina and in the world at large, and takes up a number of themes more typical of a [[novel of ideas]]. Most of the ideas engaged are in the areas of [[metaphysics]], [[language]], [[epistemology]], and [[literary criticism]].

==Summary==
The story unfolds as a first-person narrative and contains many references (see [[#Fact and fiction|below]]) to real people, places, literary works and philosophical concepts, besides some fictional or ambiguous ones. It is divided into two parts and a [[postscript]]. Events and facts are revealed roughly in the order that the narrator becomes aware of them or their relevance. The timing of events in Borges's story is approximately from 1935 to 1947; the plot concerns events going back as far as the early 17th century and culminating in the postscript, set in 1947.

===Part one===
Borges and his friend and collaborator, [[Adolfo Bioy Casares]], are developing their next book in a country house near [[Buenos Aires]], in 1940. In an observation, Bioy quotes that "mirrors and copulation are abominable because they increase the number of men" from a heresiarch of a land named '''Uqbar'''. Borges, impressed with the "memorable" sentence, asks for its source. Bioy replies that he had read it in the chapter about Uqbar of the ''Anglo-American Cyclopaedia'', "a literal if inadequate reprint" of the 1902 edition of ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. They check the book and are unable to find the said chapter, to Bioy's surprise.&lt;ref&gt;"Tlön...", p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The two then search for the name 'Uqbar' in numerous atlases and other encyclopedias, trying different alternative name forms, to no avail.

The following day, Bioy tells Borges he has found the chapter they were looking for in a different reprint of the same encyclopedia. The chapter, although brief and full of names unfamiliar to Borges and Bioy, entices their curiosity. It describes Uqbar as an obscure region, located in Iraq or [[Asia Minor]], with an all-fantastic literature taking place in the mythical worlds of Mlejnas and Tlön.&lt;ref&gt;"Tlön...", p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, they keep searching for Uqbar in other sources, but are unable to find any mention.

===Part two===
The engineer Herbert Ashe, an English friend of Borges' father with a peculiar interest in [[duodecimal]]s, dies of an [[aneurysm]] rupture. Borges inherits a packet containing a book, which was left by Ashe in a pub. That book is revealed to be the eleventh volume of an English-language encyclopedia entirely devoted to Tlön, one of the worlds in which Uqbar's legends are set. The book contains two oval blue stamps with the words ''Orbis Tertius'' inscribed in blue. From that point, as Borges reads the tome, part two comprehensively describes and discuss Tlön's culture, history, languages and philosophy. 

The people of the imaginary Tlön hold an extreme form of [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]'s [[subjective idealism]], denying the reality of the world. Their world is understood "not as a concurrence of objects in space, but as a heterogeneous series of independent acts."&lt;ref name="tlon115"&gt;"Tlön…", p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; One of the imagined language families of Tlön lacks nouns, being centered instead in impersonal verbs qualified by monosyllabic adverbial affixes. Borges lists a Tlönic equivalent of "The moon rose above the water": ''hlör u fang axaxaxas mlö'', meaning literally "upward behind the onstreaming it mooned". ([[Andrew Hurley (academic)|Andrew Hurley]], one of Borges' translators, wrote a fiction in which he says that the words "axaxaxas mlö" "can only be pronounced as the author's cruel, mocking laughter".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Hurley, [http://www.themodernword.com/borges/Zahir_and_I.html The Zahir and I], The Garden of Forking Paths, part of TheModernWorld.com. Accessed 3 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;) In another language family of Tlön, "the basic unit is not the verb, but the monosyllabic [[adjective]]", which in combinations of two or more forms nouns: "moon" becomes "round airy-light on dark" or "pale-orange-of-the-sky".&lt;ref name="tlon115"/&gt;

In a world where there are no nouns—or where nouns are composites of other parts of speech, created and discarded according to a whim—and no ''things'', most of Western philosophy becomes impossible. Without nouns about which to state propositions, there can be no ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' deductive reasoning from first principles. Without history, there can be no [[teleology]] (showing a divine purpose playing itself out in the world). If there can be no such thing as observing the same object at different times,&lt;ref name="tlon115" /&gt; there is no possibility of ''[[a posteriori]]'' [[inductive reasoning]] (generalizing from experience). [[Ontology]]—the philosophy of what it means to ''be''—is an alien concept. Tlön is a world of Berkeleyan idealism with one critical omission: it lacks the omnipresent, perceiving deity on whom Berkeley relied as a point of view demanding an internally consistent world. This infinitely mutable world is tempting to a playful intellect, and its "transparent tigers and ... towers of blood"&lt;ref name="tlon115" /&gt; appeal to baser minds, but a Tlönic world view requires denying most of what would normally be considered common sense reality.{{Citation needed|reason=Most of the content of this paragraph seems to be unreferenced.|date=June 2017}}

===Postscript===
In the [[anachronism|anachronistic]] postscript set in 1947, Borges remembers events that occurred in the last years.

In 1941, the world and the narrator have learned, through the emergence of a letter, the nature of Uqbar and Tlön. It goes that a "benevolent secret society" was formed "one night in [[Lucerne]] or in London", in the 17th century, and had Berkeley among its members. That group, a society of intellectuals named ''Orbis Tertius'', studied "[[Hermeticism|hermetic studies]], [[philanthropy]] and the [[Kabbalah|cabala]]" (an allusion to societies such as the [[Bavarian Illuminati]], the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] and the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucians]]), but its main purpose was to create a country: Uqbar. It gradually became clear that such work would have to be carried by numerous generations, so each master agreed to elect a disciple who would carry on his work to perpetuate an hereditary arrangement. The society is eventually [[persecution|persecuted]], but reemerges in the United States in the following century. The American "eccentric" millionaire Ezra Buckley, one of the members of the restored sect, finds its undertaking too modest, proposing that their creation be of an entire world instead of just a country. He also adds that an entire encyclopedia about this world—named Tlön—must be written and that the whole scheme "have no truck with that impostor Jesus Christ" (and therefore none with Berkeley's God).&lt;ref&gt;"Tlön…", p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; The new ''Orbis Tertius'', composed of three hundred collaborators, proceeds to conclude the final volume of the First Encyclopedia of Tlön.

By 1942, Tlönian objects began to inexplicably appear in the real world. One of the first instances in which this occurs is when Princess Faucigny Lucinge received, via mail, a vibrating compass with a Tlönian scripture. Another instance is witnessed by Borges himself: a drunk man, shortly after dying, dropped coins among which a small but extremely heavy shining metal cone appeared. It is suggested that these occurrences may have been forgeries, but yet products of a secret science and technology.

By 1944, all forty volumes of the First Encyclopedia of Tlön have been discovered and published in a library in Memphis. The material becomes accessible worldwide and immensely influential on Earth's culture, science and languages. By the time Borges concludes the story, presumably in 1947, the world is gradually becoming Tlön. Borges then turns to an obsession of his own: a translation of Sir [[Thomas Browne]]'s ''[[Urn Burial]]'' into Spanish.

==Major themes==
===Philosophical themes===
Through the vehicle of [[fantasy]] or [[speculative fiction]], this story playfully explores several [[philosophy|philosophical]] questions and themes. These include, above all, an effort by Borges to imagine a world (Tlön) where the 18th century philosophical [[subjective idealism]] of [[George Berkeley]] is viewed as [[common sense]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Philosophy and Literature]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |date=Fall 1977 |pages=337–341 |title='..Merely a Man of Letters': an interview with Jorge Luis Borges |last1=Dutton |first1=Denis |authorlink1=Denis Dutton |last2=Palencia-Roth |first2=Michael |last3=Berkove |first3=Lawrence I. |display-authors=1 |url=http://denisdutton.com/jorge_luis_borges_interview.htm |accessdate=2015-01-12}} In the interview, Dutton refers to Tlön as "A world in which Berkeley is common sense instead of Descartes". Borges concurs.&lt;/ref&gt; and "the doctrine of [[materialism]]" is considered a heresy, a scandal, and a paradox.&lt;ref&gt;"Tlön...", p.117&lt;/ref&gt; Through describing the languages of Tlön, the story also plays with the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]]—the [[epistemology|epistemological]] question of how language influences what thoughts are possible. The story also contains several metaphors for the way ideas influence reality. This last theme is first explored cleverly, by way of describing physical objects being willed into existence by the force of imagination, but later turns darker, as fascination with the idea of Tlön begins to distract people from paying adequate attention to the reality of [[Earth]].

Much of the story engages with the philosophical idealism of George Berkeley, who questioned whether it is possible to say that a thing exists if it is not being perceived. (Berkeley, a philosopher and, later, a bishop in the Protestant Church of Ireland, resolved that question to his own satisfaction by saying that the omnipresent perception of [[God]] ensures that objects continue to exist outside of personal or human perception.) Berkeley's philosophy privileges perceptions over any notion of the "thing in itself." [[Immanuel Kant]] accused Berkeley of going so far as to deny [[objective reality]].

In the imagined world of Tlön, an exaggerated Berkeleyan idealism ''without God'' passes for common sense. The Tlönian recognizes perceptions as primary and denies the existence of any underlying reality. At the end of the main portion of the story, immediately before the postscript, Borges stretches this toward its logical breaking point by imagining that, "Occasionally a few birds, a horse perhaps, have saved the ruins of an amphitheater" by continuing to perceive it.&lt;ref name="tlon119"&gt;"Tlön…", p.119&lt;/ref&gt; Besides commenting on Berkeley's philosophy, this and other aspects of Borges's story can be taken as a commentary on the ability of ideas to influence reality. For example, in Tlön there are objects known as ''hrönir''&lt;ref name="tlon119" /&gt; that arise when two different people find the "same" lost object in different places.

Borges imagines a Tlönite working his way out of the problem of [[solipsism]] by reasoning that if all people are actually aspects of one being, then perhaps the [[universe]] is consistent because that one being is consistent in his imagining. This is, effectively, a near-reconstruction of the Berkeleyan God: perhaps not omnipresent, but bringing together all perceptions that do, indeed, occur.

This story is not the only place where Borges engages with Berkeleyan idealism. In the world of Tlön, as in Borges's essay ''[[New refutation of time]]'' (1947), there is (as [[Emir Rodríguez Monegal]] and [[Alastair Reid]] comment) a "denial of space, time, and the individual I."&lt;ref&gt;Monegal and Reed, notes to ''Borges, a Reader'', p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt;  This worldview does not merely "bracket off" objective reality, but also parcels it separately into all its successive moments. Even the continuity of the individual self is open to question.

When Borges writes "The [[metaphysics|metaphysicians]] of Tlön are not looking for truth or even an approximation to it: they are after a kind of amazement. They consider metaphysics a branch of fantastic literature,"&lt;ref&gt;"Tlön…", p.116&lt;/ref&gt; he can be seen either as anticipating the extreme [[relativism]] that underlies some [[postmodernism]] or simply as taking a swipe at those who take metaphysics too seriously.

===Literary themes===
In the context of the imagined world of Tlön, Borges describes a school of [[literary criticism]] that arbitrarily assumes that two works are by the same person and, based on that, deduces things about the imagined author. This is similar to the ending of "[[Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote]]", in which Borges's narrator suggests that a new perspective can be opened by treating a book as though it were written by a different author.

The story also plays with the theme of the love of books in general, and of [[encyclopedia]]s and [[atlas (cartography)|atlas]]es in particular—books that are each themselves, in some sense, a world.

Like many of Borges's works, the story challenges the boundaries between fiction and non-fiction. It mentions several quite real historical human beings (himself, his friend [[Adolfo Bioy Casares|Bioy Casares]], [[Thomas de Quincey]], et al.) but often attributes fictional aspects to them; the story also contains many fictional characters and others whose factuality may be open to question.

===Other themes===
"Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" also engages a number of other related themes. The story begins and ends with issues of reflection, replication, and reproduction—both perfect and imperfect—and the related issue of the power of language and ideas to make or remake the world.

At the start of the story, we have an "unnerving" and "grotesque" mirror reflecting the room,  a "literal if inadequate" (and presumably plagiarized) reproduction of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', an apt misquotation by [[Adolfo Bioy Casares|Bioy Casares]], and the issue of whether one should be able to trust whether the various copies of a single book will have the same content.&lt;ref&gt;"Tlön…", p. 111–2.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end Borges is working on a "tentative translation" of an English-language work into Spanish, while the power of the ideas of "a scattered dynasty of solitaries" remakes the world in the image of Tlön.&lt;ref&gt;"Tlön…", p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the way we have stone mirrors;&lt;ref name="tlon113"&gt;"Tlön...", p.113&lt;/ref&gt; the idea of reconstructing an entire encyclopedia of an imaginary world based on a single volume;&lt;ref name="tlon114"&gt;"Tlön...", p.114&lt;/ref&gt; the analogy of that encyclopedia to a "cosmos" governed by "strict laws";&lt;ref name="tlon115" /&gt; a worldview in which our normal notions of "thing" are rejected, but "ideal objects abound, invoked and dissolved momentarily, according to poetic necessity";&lt;ref name="tlon115" /&gt; the universe conceived as "the handwriting of a minor god to communicate with a demon" or a "code system... in which not all symbols have meaning";&lt;ref&gt;"Tlön…", p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; ''hrönir'', duplicates of objects called into existence by ignorance or hope, and where "those of the eleventh degree have a purity of form that the originals do not possess";&lt;ref name="tlon119" /&gt; and Ezra Buckley's wish "to demonstrate to a nonexistent God that mortal men were capable of conceiving a world."

Borges also mentions in passing the [[duodecimal]] system (as well as others), but never elaborates on the fact that this is inherently a refutation of the changeability of things due to nomenclature—a number may be renamed under a different counting schema, but the underlying value will always remain the same.

==Fact and fiction==
It is by no means simple to sort out fact and fiction within this story. The picture is further complicated by the fact that other authors (both in print and on the web) have chosen to join Borges in his game and write about one or another fictional aspect of this story either as if it were non-fiction or in a manner that could potentially confuse the unwary reader. Two online examples are the Italian-language website ''La Biblioteca di Uqbar'', which treats Tlön itself as duly fictional, but writes as if the fictional Silas Haslam's entirely imaginary ''History of the Land Called Uqbar'' were a real work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uqbar.it |title=La Biblioteca di Uqbar |accessdate=3 August 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060609025716/http://www.uqbar.it/ |archivedate=June 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, simply finding a reference to a person or place from "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" in a context seemingly unrelated to Borges's story is not enough to be confident that the person or place is real. See, for example, the discussion below of the character Silas Haslam.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

There in fact exists an ''Anglo-American '''En'''cyclop'''e'''dia'', which is a plagiarism, differently paginated, of the tenth edition of the Encyclopedia, and in which the 46th volume is ''TO'''T'''-UPS'', ending on p.&amp;nbsp;917 with Upsala,  and followed by [[Ural–Altaic languages|Ural–Altaic]] in the next volume; Uqbar would fall in between. In the ''11th'' edition of the ''Britannica'', Borges's favorite, there is an article in between these on "[[Ur]]"; which may, in some sense, therefore ''be'' Uqbar. Different articles in the 11th edition mention that ''Ur'', as the name of a city, means simply "''the'' city", and that ''Ur'' is also the [[aurochs]], or the evil god of the [[Mandaeans]]. Borges may be punning on the sense of "primaeval" here with his repeated use of ''[[Ursprache]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Conjecture due to Alan White, "An Appalling or Banal Reality" ''Variaciones Borges'' 15, 47-91. p. 52. Also,[http://www.williams.edu/philosophy/faculty/awhite/borges%202.htm White's web site, un itled], accessed 3 August 2006.  The Tenth Edition of the Britannica in fact has two alphabets of articles (one a reprint of the Ninth Edition, the other a supplement); the Anglo-American Encyclopedia merged these into one alphabet. One of the two parts of the Britannica also breaks at UPS. The other meanings of UR are not additional articles in the 11th, but they can be found in the index.&lt;/ref&gt; or on the story's own definition of "ur" in one of Tlön's languages as "a thing produced by suggestion, an object elicited by hope".

===Levels of reality===
There are several levels of reality (or unreality) in the story:

* Most (but not all) of the people mentioned in the story are real, but the events in which they are involved are mostly fictional, as are some of the works attributed to them. This is discussed in detail in the section below on real and fictional people.
* The main portion of the story is a fiction set in a naturalistic world; in the postscript, magical elements have entered the narrator's world. The main portion could certainly be seen as a [[false document]]; the postscript may dissolve the illusion.
* The land of Uqbar is fictional from the point of view of the world of the story. The supposed ''Anglo-American Cyclopaedia'' article on Uqbar proves, within the story, to be a [[fictitious entry]].
* Mlejnas, and Tlön as it is first introduced, are fictional from the point of view of Uqbar. In the course of the story, Tlön becomes more and more "real": first it moves from being a fiction of Uqbar to being a fiction of the narrator's own naturalistic world, then it begins (first as idea and then physically) taking over that world, to the point of finally threatening to annihilate normal reality.

===Real and fictional places===
[[File:LocationUqbar (1917).png|thumb|300px|Possible location of Uqbar{{dubious|date=June 2016}}]]
'''Uqbar''' in the story is [[Story within a story|''doubly'' fictional]]: even within the world of the story it turns out to be a fictional place. The [[fictitious entry]] described in the story furnishes deliberately meager indications of Uqbar's location: "Of the fourteen names which figured in the geographical part, we only recognized three – [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]], [[Armenia]], [[Erzerum]] – interpolated in the text in an ambiguous way."  Armenia and Erzerum lie in the eastern highlands of [[Asia Minor]] (in and near modern [[Turkey]]), while Khorasan is in northeastern [[Iran]].  However, it was said to have cited an equally nonexistent German-titled book – ''Lesbare und lesenswerthe Bemerkungen über das Land Ukkbar in Klein-Asien'' ("Legible and valuable observations over the Uqbar land in Asia Minor") – whose title claims unambiguously that Uqbar was in [[Asia Minor]].

The boundaries of Uqbar were described using equally nonexistent reference points; for instance, "the lowlands of Tsai Khaldun and the Axa Delta marked the southern frontier" (see section [[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius#Real and fictional places|Real and fictional place]]).  This would suggest that the rivers of Borges' Uqbar should rise in highlands to the north; in fact, the mountainous highlands of eastern Turkey are where not one but two Zab Rivers rise, the [[Great Zab]] and the [[Little Zab|Lesser Zab]].  They run a couple of hundred miles south into the [[Tigris]].

The only points of Uqbar's history mentioned relate to religion, literature, and craft.  It was described as the home of a noted [[heresiarch]], and the scene of religious persecutions directed against the orthodox in the thirteenth century; fleeing the latter, its orthodox believers built obelisks in their southerly place of exile, and made mirrors – seen by the heresiarch as abominable – of stone.  Crucially for the story, Uqbar's "epics and legends never referred to reality, but to the two imaginary regions of Mlejnas and Tlön."

Although the culture of Uqbar described by Borges is fictional, there are two real places with similar names. These are:

# The medieval city of [[Ukbara|‘Ukbarâ]] on the left bank of the [[Tigris]] between [[Samarra]] and [[Baghdad]] in what is now [[Iraq]].  This city was home to the great [[Islam]]ic [[grammar]]ian, [[philology|philologist]], and religious scholar [[Al-Ukbari|Al-‘Ukbarî]] (c. 1143–1219) – who was blind, like Borges's father and like Borges himself was later to become – and to two notable early [[Jewish]]/[[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] "[[heresiarch]]s" (see above), leaders of Karaite movements opposed to [[Anan ben David]], [[Ishmael al-Ukbari]] and [[Meshwi al-Ukbari]], mentioned in the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' of 1901–1906.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Isidore and Broydé, Isaac,  [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=504&amp;letter=M Meshwi al-‘Ukbari], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'', 1901–1906. Accessed online 9 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ‘Uqbâr in the [[Atlas Mountains]] of [[Algeria]]; the [[minaret]]s of the latter's area might relate to the "obelisks" of Uqbar in the story.

''Tsai Khaldun'' is undoubtedly a tribute to the great historian [[Ibn Khaldun]], who lived in [[Andalusia]] for a while; his history focuses on [[North Africa]] and was probably a major source for Borges.  Additionally, "tsai" comes from the [[Mandarin Chinese]] word 菜 (''cài''), which refers to green leafy vegetables.{{Dubious |reason=Any source for the Mandarin etymology?|date=December 2017}}

Other places named in the story – [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]], [[Armenia]], and [[Erzerum]] in the [[Middle East]], and various locations in [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]] – are real. The ''Axa Delta'', mentioned in the same context as ''Tsai Khaldun'', appears to be fictional.

===Real and fictional people===
Listed here in order of their appearance in the story:

* [[Jorge Luis Borges]] (1899–1986)—Author and first person narrator of the story.
* [[Adolfo Bioy Casares]] (1914–1999)—non-fictional, Argentine fiction-writer, a friend and frequent collaborator of Borges.&lt;ref name=Guia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cce.ufsc.br/~espanhol/projborges/tlon.htm |title=Guía de lectura de ''Ficciones'', de Jorge Luis Borges |website=Universidade Federal de Santa Caterina (Brazil) |accessdate=3 August 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060810201023/http://www.cce.ufsc.br/~espanhol/projborges/tlon.htm |archivedate=10 August 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An unnamed "heresiarch of Uqbar" is credited for the statement that "mirrors and copulation are abominable because they increase the number of men". This echoes Borges' own summary of the teachings of [[Al-Muqanna]] (d. ca. 783), a Persian prophet regarded by his orthodox Muslim contemporaries as a heresiarch. In the previously-published short story collection [[A Universal History of Infamy]], Borges wrote the following as part of a summary of his message: "The world we live in is a mistake, a clumsy parody. Mirrors and fatherhood, because they multiply and confirm the parody, are abominations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jáen |first1=Didier T. |title=The Esoteric Tradition in Borges' "Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" |journal=Studies in Short Stories |date=January 1, 1984 |volume=21 |issue=Winter84 |pages=25-39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Justus Perthes]] (1749–1816)—non-fictional, 18th century founder of a German publishing firm that bears his name; undoubtedly, the story is accurate in implying the firm's atlases do not mention Uqbar.
* [[Carl Ritter]] (1779–1859)—one of the founders of modern [[geography]]. In the story, Borges notes the absence of any mention of Uqbar in Ritter's cartographic index ''Erdkunde''. (In the story, only the surname is given.)&lt;ref name=Guia /&gt;
* [[Smerdis]] (d. 522 BC)—The story refers in passing to "the impostor, Smerdis the Magician".&lt;ref name="tlon113" /&gt; After the death of the actual Smerdis (son of [[Cyrus the Great]] of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]]) a [[Magi]]an priest named [[Gaumata]] successfully impersonated him for several months and ruled in his stead.
* [[Bernard Quaritch]] (1819–1899)—An actual nineteenth-century [[bookseller]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name=Guia /&gt; The bookstore bearing his name still survives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quaritch.com/ Bernard Quaritch, Antiquarian bookseller], official site. Accessed 14 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In the story, his catalogues include Silas Haslam's ''History of the Land Called Uqbar''.
* Silas Haslam—Entirely fictional, but based on Borges' English ancestors. "Haslam" was Borges's paternal grandmother's maiden name.&lt;ref name=Guia /&gt; In the story, besides the 1874 ''History of the Land Called Uqbar'', a footnote informs us that Haslam is also the author of ''A General History of Labyrinths'' ([[labyrinths]] as well as playfully fake literary references are a recurring theme in Borges's work). Silas Haslam is an entirely fictional character.&lt;ref name=Guia/&gt; However, Haslam's "General History of Labyrinths" has been cited twice in reputable, peer-reviewed scientific literature: in "Complexity of two-dimensional patterns", by Kristian Lindgren, Christopher Moore, and Mats Nordahl (published in the June 1998 edition of the ''Journal of Statistical Physics'') and "Order parameter equations for front transitions: Nonuniformly curved fronts," by A.

*[[Johannes Valentinus Andreä]] (1586–1654)—[[Germany|German]] [[theology|theologian]], and the real author of ''Chymische Hochzeit Christiani Rosencreutz anno 1459'' (''[[Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz]]''), one of the three founding works of the [[Rosicrucian]]s, but not of the ''Lesbare und lesenswerthe Bemerkungen über das Land Ukkbar in Klein-Asien'' (''Readable and worthwhile remarks about the country of Ukkbar in Asia Minor'') attributed to him in this story.
* [[Thomas De Quincey]] (1785–1859)—best known for his autobiographical works ''[[Confessions of an English Opium-Eater]]'' and ''[[Lake Reminiscences]]''.&lt;ref name=Guia /&gt; Mentioned in passing in the story (by his surname) for his ostensible (not independently verified) mention of Andreä.
* [[Carlos Mastronardi]] (1901–1976)—Argentine writer, member of the [[Florida group|Martín Fierro group]] (also known as Florida group), and a close friend of Borges.&lt;ref name=Guia /&gt; In the story, he finds a copy of the ''Anglo-American Cyclopaedia'' that omits the Uqbar pages.
* Herbert Ashe (d. 1937)—presumably fictional, based on one or more of Borges's father's English friends. He shares with [[Xul Solar]] (see below) an interest in the duodecimal numeral system (in which twelve is written as 10.)
* Néstor Ibarra, [[Ezequiel Martínez Estrada]] (1895–1964), and [[Pierre Drieu La Rochelle|(Pierre) Drieu La Rochelle]] (1893–1945)—all historical, described in the story as engaged in a dispute over whether the discovery of ''A First Encyclopaedia of Tlön. Volume XI. Hlaer to Jangr'' implies the existence of the other volumes to which it makes references. Ibarra was a noted Argentinian poet (and Borges's translator into [[French language|French]]);&lt;ref name=Guia /&gt; Estrada, an Argentinian, was the author of, among other works, ''Muerte y transfiguración de Martín Fierro'' ("Death and Transfiguration of Martín Fierro"), a major commentary on Argentina's most famous nineteenth century literary work.&lt;ref name=Guia /&gt; [[Pierre Drieu La Rochelle|Drieu La Rochelle]], who was to commit suicide after becoming infamous for his collaboration with the [[Nazism|Nazis]] during the [[France during World War II|Occupation of France]], was one of the few foreign contributors to ''[[Sur (magazine)|Sur]]'', [[Victoria Ocampo]]'s Argentine journal to which Borges was a regular contributor.
* [[Alfonso Reyes]] (1889–1959)—[[Mexico|Mexican]] diplomat who served for a time in Argentina.&lt;ref name=Guia /&gt; In the story, he proposes to recreate the missing volumes of ''A First Encyclopaedia of Tlön''.
* The philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] (1646–1716) is mentioned in passing, and [[David Hume|Hume]] (1711–1776) is mentioned for finding Berkeley "unanswerable but thoroughly unconvincing."&lt;ref name="tlon115" /&gt;
* Bishop [[George Berkeley]] (1685–1753), a driving engine of the story, was the founder of the modern school of philosophical [[idealism]].&lt;ref name=Guia /&gt;
* [[Xul Solar]] (1887–1963)—adopted name of Oscar Agustín Alejandro Schulz Solari, Argentine [[watercolor]]ist, esotericist, and (presumably most relevant here) inventor of imaginary languages.&lt;ref name=Guia /&gt; In the real world a close associate of Borges and a member of the Florida group; in the story, he skillfully translates one of the languages of the Southern Hemisphere of Tlön.
* [[Alexius Meinong]] (1853–1920)—Austrian psychologist and philosopher, who wrote ''Gegenstandstheorie'' ("The theory of objects"), where he wrote at length about the notion of objects that exist only in our minds. He is referred to by his surname in the story;&lt;ref name=Guia /&gt; his theories are alluded to by way of explaining the languages of the Northern Hemisphere of Tlön. Presumably, Borges is acknowledging where he got the idea for this imaginary family of languages.
* [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872–1970)—British philosopher. In a footnote, the story refers (accurately) to his conjecture that (in Borges's words) "[[Omphalos hypothesis#Five-minute hypothesis|our planet was created a few moments ago, and provided with a humanity which 'remembers' an illusory past]]."&lt;ref&gt;''The Analysis of Mind'', 1921, p. 159, cited in "Guía de lectura…"&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Baruch Spinoza]] (1632–1677)—[[Netherlands|Dutch]] / [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Jew]]ish philosopher, referred to in the story by his surname, and accurately paraphrased: "Spinoza attributes to his inexhaustible divinity the attributes of extension and of thought."
* Similarly, the story's use of the [[German language|German-language]] phrase ''Philosophie des Als Ob'' refers to philosopher [[Hans Vaihinger]] (1852–1933), whose book of this name (first edition: 1911) puts forward the notion that some human concepts are simply useful fictions.
* The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]] (490–430 BC) is accurately alluded to in the story for [[Zeno's paradoxes|his paradoxes]] denying the possibility of motion, based on the indivisibility of [[time]].
* The philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788–1860), as with Meinong, is acknowledged, in this case for his ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena|Parerga und Paralipomena]]'',&lt;ref name=Guia /&gt; which Borges (apparently falsely) claims parallels a Tlönist "idealist [[pantheism]]". This is the really the [[absolute idealism]] of Schopenhauer's despised rival, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] (1770–1831), which was derived from [[Spinoza]]'s [[pantheism]]. Schopenhauer does not assert that there is only one subject and that this one subject is every being in the universe; on the contrary, he asserts that each individual observing animal is a unique subject, having its own point of view of the objects that it experiences. Presumably Borges's related remark about preserving a psychological basis for the sciences is something of a joke on preserving a scientific basis for psychology.
* [[William Shakespeare]] (1564–1616)—English poet, playwright, and actor. Merely alluded to in the story, without fictional embellishment.
* Gunnar Erfjord is presumably not a real person. The name is a combination of Gunnar Lange and Berta Erfjord, parents of Argentine author [[Norah Lange]],&lt;ref&gt;Fredrik Wandrup, [http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/1999/10/07/179473.html Vår mann i Latin-Amerika], ''Dagbladet'' (Norway), 7 October 1999. Accessed 3 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; another member of the Martín Fierro group. At the beginning of the postscript to the story, a letter from Gunnar Erfjord clears up the mystery of the "benevolent secret society" that devised Tlön.&lt;ref&gt;"Tlön…", p. 119–20&lt;/ref&gt; He is presumably also the "[[Norway|Norwegian]] in [[Rio Grande do Sul]]" mentioned early in the story.&lt;ref name="tlon113" /&gt;
* [[Charles Howard Hinton]] (1853–1907) was an eccentric British mathematician, associated with the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophists]]; Borges later edited and wrote a prologue for a translation of Hinton's "scientific romances", and also alludes to him in the story "There are More Things", in the ''Book of Sand'' (1975). In "Tlön...", the letter from Gunnar Erfjord is found "in a volume of Hinton", presumably invoked for his interest in extra dimensions and parallel worlds.
* [[George Dalgarno]] (1626–1687), seventeenth-century [[Scotland|Scottish]] intellectual with an interest in linguistics, and inventor of a language for [[deaf]] mutes.&lt;ref name=Guia /&gt; He is alluded to by his last name as an early member (along with Berkeley) of the fictional secret society that sets in motion the story of the doubly fictional Uqbar (and the triply fictional Tlön).
* Ezra Buckley (d. 1848), the eccentric American benefactor who expands the scale of the Uqbarist enterprise to a full Tlönist encyclopedic undertaking, is entirely fictional. It has been conjectured that there is an allusion to [[Ezra Pound]].&lt;ref name=Guia /&gt;
* María Lidia Lloveras (1898–?)—Argentine, married into an old French [[nobility|noble]] family, making her Princess Faucigny Lucinge. She lived in Buenos Aires and was a friend of Borges. In the story, under her royal title, she stumbles across one of the first objects from Tlön to appear in our world.
* [[Enrique Amorim]] (1900–1960)&lt;ref name=Guia /&gt;—[[Uruguay]]an novelist.&lt;ref name=Guia /&gt; In the story, along with Borges, he witnesses the Tlönic coins that have fallen from the pocket of a dead man.
* [[Francisco de Quevedo]] (1580–1645)—[[Baroque]] [[Spain|Spanish]] poet and [[picaresque]] novelist, is alluded to here simply for his writing style.
* [[Thomas Browne]] (1605–1682), seventeenth-century English physician and essayist, is indeed the author of ''[[Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial|Urn Burial]]'',&lt;ref name=Guia /&gt; which at the end of the story the fictional Borges is translating, though without intent to publish.

==Context in Borges's life and works==
"Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" formed part of a 1941 collection of stories called ''El jardín de senderos que se bifurcan'' ("[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]").

At the time he wrote "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" in early 1940, Borges was little known outside of Argentina. He was working in a local public library in Buenos Aires, and had a certain local fame as a translator of works from English, French and German, and as an ''avant garde'' poet and essayist (having published regularly in widely read Argentinian periodicals such as ''El Hogar'', as well as in many smaller magazines, such as [[Victoria Ocampo]]'s ''[[Sur (magazine)|Sur]]'', where "Tlön..." was originally published). In the previous two years he had been through a great deal: his father had died in 1938, and on Christmas Eve 1938, Borges himself had suffered a severe head wound in an accident; during treatment for that wound, he nearly died of a blood infection.

For some time before his father's death and his own accident, Borges had been drifting toward writing fiction. His ''Historia universal de la infamia'' (''Universal History of Infamy''), published in 1935, used a baroque writing style and the techniques of fiction to tell the stories of seven historical rogues. These ranged from "El espantoso redentor [[John Murrell (bandit)|Lazarus Morell]]" ("The Dread Redeemer Lazarus Morell")—who promised liberty to slaves in the American South, but brought them only death—to "El incivil maestro de ceremonias [[Kokushi (official)|Kotsuké no Suké]]" ("The Insulting Master of Etiquette Kôtsuké no Suké"), the story of the central figure in the [[Japan]]ese ''[[47 Ronin|Tale of the 47 Ronin]]'', also known as [[Kira Yoshinaka|Kira Kozuke-no-Suke Yoshinaka]]. Borges had also written a number of clever literary forgeries disguised as translations from authors such as [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] or from [[Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena|Don Juan Manuel's]] ''[[Tales of Count Lucanor]]''. Recovering from his head wound and infection, Borges decided it was time to turn to the writing of fiction as such.

Several of these fictions, notably "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" and "[[Pierre Menard (fictional character)|Pierre Menard]], autor del Quijote" ("Pierre Menard, Author of ''The Quixote''", published ten months earlier in ''[[Sur (magazine)|Sur]]'', and also included in ''El jardín de senderos que se bifurcan''), could only have been written by an experienced essayist. Both of these works apply Borges's essayistic style to largely imaginary subject matter. His massive erudition is as evident in these fictions as in any non-fictional essay in his body of works.

Buenos Aires was, at this time, a thriving intellectual center. While Europe was immersed in [[World War II]], Argentina, and Buenos Aires in particular, flourished intellectually and artistically. (This situation was to change during the presidency of [[Juan Perón]] and the subsequent military governments, where many of Argentina's leading intellectuals went into exile, something that Borges and most of his circle did not contemplate.){{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Borges's first volume of fiction failed to garner the literary prizes many in his circle expected for it. [[Victoria Ocampo]] dedicated a large portion of the July 1942 issue of ''[[Sur (magazine)|Sur]]'' to a "Reparation for Borges"; numerous leading writers and critics from Argentina and throughout the Spanish-speaking world contributed writings to the project, which probably brought his work as much attention as a prize would have.

Over the next few decades "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" and Borges's other fiction from this period formed a key part of the body of work that put Latin America on the international literary map. Borges was to become more widely known throughout the world as a writer of extremely original short stories than as a poet and essayist.

==Publication history==
"Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" originally appeared in Spanish in '''''[[Sur (magazine)|SUR]]''''' in May 1940. The Spanish-language original was then published in book form in '''''Antología de la Literatura Fantástica''''' —December 1940—, then in Borges's 1941 collection ''El Jardín de senderos que se bifurcan'' (''[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]''). That entire book was, in turn, included within ''[[Ficciones]]'' (1944), a much-reprinted book (15 editions in Argentina by 1971).

The first published English-language translation was by James E. Irby. It appeared in the April 1961 issue of ''[[New World Writing]]''. The following year, Irby's translation was included as the first piece in a diverse collection of Borges works entitled ''[[Labyrinths]]''. Almost simultaneously, and independently, the piece was translated by Alastair Reid; Reid's version was published in 1962 as part of a collaborative English-language translation of the entirety of ''Ficciones''. The Reid translation is reprinted in ''Borges, a Reader'' (1981, {{ISBN|0-525-47654-7}}), p.&amp;nbsp;111–122. Quotations and page references in this article follow that translation.

It was a finalist for the ''[[Retro Hugo Award]]'' for Best Short Story from 1940 (in 2016).  It is the first non-English work to be nominated in its original language rather than as a translation.

==Influence on later works==
"Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" has inspired a number of real-world projects:

* "Small Demons", a website that "obsessively maps out cultural allusions found in books",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookforum.com/paper/archive/20120402|title=BookForum|date=April 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smalldemons.com|title=Small Demons}}&lt;/ref&gt; was inspired by Borges, according to CEO Valla Vakili: "The inspiration for the name comes from the Argentinean writer Jorge Luis Borges, specifically a passage in his short story 'Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius'. Borges writes, 'The history of the universe… is the handwriting produced by a Minor god in order to communicate with a Demon.' I read that as, the history of the universe is all the stories ever told. Minor gods are the storytellers who rule the worlds of their stories. And the Demon is the force that drives the need for stories, the place where author and reader meet. I took 'Minor' and 'Demon' and from there, Small Demons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oliver|first=Danielle|title=Storyverser|url=http://www.dailybrink.com/?p=4321}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Prisoners of Uqbaristan", a short story by [[Chris Nakashima-Brown]] in which Borges himself appears, is heavily influenced by the philosophy of Tlön.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strangehorizons.com/2004/20041018/uqbaristan-f.shtml Strange Horizons Fiction: Prisoners of Uqbaristan, by Chris Nakashima-Brown&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194022/http://www.strangehorizons.com/2004/20041018/uqbaristan-f.shtml |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Codex Seraphinianus]]'', a mock encyclopedia by [[Luigi Serafini (artist)|Luigi Serafini]], describes a surreal world entirely in drawings, an invented alphabet, and a fictional language.
* [[Ummo]], a [[hoax]] of more than one thousand pages of pictures and text in letter form, describes an [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] civilization and its contact with Earth. [[UFO]] researcher [[Jacques Vallée]] has specifically likened Ummo to "Tlön, Uqbar ...".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Vallee|Vallee, Jacques]]. ''Revelations: Alien Contact and Human Deception''. (1992, Souvenir Press, {{ISBN|0-285-63073-3}}, pages 111-113)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Borges story directly inspired [[Grant Morrison]]'s creation of the cancerous and fictional city of Orqwith in the [[DC Comics]] series ''[[Doom Patrol]]''. In the comic book storyline, a group of intellectuals uses a tactile, [[braille]]-like language to create a black book describing the city of Orqwith. As people on different planets encounter the book, it infects their worlds, overcoming them in the way a malignant tumor would. Thus different sections of the planets are sliced off, only to be replaced with Orqwith.
* Tlön is featured in the [[Marvel Comics]] series ''[[Secret Avengers]]'' by Ales Kot and Michael Walsh, as a chaotic dimension the villain [[M.O.D.O.K.]] plans to bring monstrosities from to destroy the Earth. A chain of people that created a communal mindspace based on negative emotions is used to open a gate to Tlön. The plan, ultimately carried by M.O.D.O.K.'s assistant Snapper, is thwarted by the [[Secret Avengers]] and M.O.D.O.K. himself. In the end of the storyline, one of the characters, a sentient bomb named Vladimir, is transported to Tlön, where he meets an unseen entity he initially identifies as "Jorg--" before being interrupted by the entity himself. The story ''Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius'' is explicitly referenced by characters that investigated Tlön.

Several other projects have names derived from the story:
* '''''Axaxaxas mlö''''' is the title of a fictional book mentioned in another Borges short story, "[[The Library of Babel]]".
* '''''hlör u fang axaxaxas mlö''''', taken from the example of the Tlön language described in the story, is the title of a [[chamber music]] piece for clarinet, violin, cello, and piano by [[Colombia]]n composer Diego Vega, which won the 2004 Colombian National Prize for Music Composition, awarded by the Colombian Ministry of Culture.&lt;ref&gt;Diego Vega, [http://diegovega.com/works/chamber-music/hlor-u-fang-axaxaxas-mlo Hlör u fang axaxaxas mlö for clarinet, violin, cello, and piano], accessed online 24 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20070727042117/http://sinic.mincultura.gov.co/culturactiva/not.asp?NOT_ID=60 La gran noche de la cultura colombiana], 2004, Colombian Ministry of Culture, accessed via Internet Archive 24 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Orbis Tertius''' is the magazine of thinking and analysis (''Revista de pensamiento y análisis'') of the [[Universidad Camilo José Cela]].
* '''Tlön Uqbar''', named after the Borges story, is a joint project of French [[industrial music|industrial]] bands [[Internal Fusion]] and [[Désaccord Majeur]]. Their album ''La Bola Perdida'' was released in 1999 by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] label Staalplaat.
* '''Uqbar''', named in honor of Borges's story, is a [[user interface|browser]]/reader for [[Project Gutenberg]] [[etext]]s, in pre-alpha {{As of|2006|lc=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/projects/uqbar SourceForge's Project Uqbar page], accessed online 14 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Uqbar''' is the name of an instance of the encyclopedia-building game ''[[Lexicon (game)|Lexicon]]'', based on Borges's work.
* '''Uqbar''' is the name of a planet in the game ''[[Mass Effect]]''.

[[W. G. Sebald|WG Sebald]] refers to Tlön and its philosophy repeatedly in his book ''[[The Rings of Saturn]]''.

Trumpeter [[Nils Petter Molvær]] released the album ''[[Khmer (album)|Khmer]]'' on ECM in 1998 which includes the track "Tlön".

'''Tower Hill''' is a [[London Underground]] station in [[Tower Hill, London|Tower Hill]], [[East End of London]]. It is on the [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle line]] between [[Bank–Monument station|Monument]] and [[Aldgate tube station|Aldgate]] stations, and on the [[District line]] between Monument and [[Aldgate East tube station|Aldgate East]]. Tower Hill is a short distance from [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway station]] for the [[Docklands Light Railway]] and [[National Rail]] at [[Fenchurch Street railway station|Fenchurch Street station]] for regional services in neighbouring [[Tower (ward)|Tower]] [[Wards of the City of London|ward]] of the [[City of London]], and [[Tower Millennium Pier]] for [[London River Services|River Services]].

The entrance to Tower Hill station is a few metres from one of the largest remaining segments of the Roman [[London Wall]] which once surrounded the historic [[City of London]]. a small sectoin of this wall is visible above the track at the far Eastern end of the Westbound platform, near the ceiling. The station was built on the site of the former [[Tower of London tube station|Tower of London station]] that closed in 1884. The present Tower Hill station opened in 1967 and replaced a nearby station with the same name but which was originally called [[Mark Lane tube station|Mark Lane]], that was slightly farther west.

==Services==
Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but the typical off-peak service pattern is:

*District line:
**Eastbound:
***12 tph (trains per hour) to [[Upminster station|Upminster]].
***3 tph to [[Barking station|Barking]]
**Westbound:
***6 tph to [[Ealing Broadway station|Ealing Broadway]];
***6 tph to [[Richmond station (London)|Richmond]];
***6 tph to [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]].
*Circle line:
**Anti-clockwise:
***6 tph to [[Hammersmith tube station (Hammersmith &amp; City and Circle lines)|Hammersmith]] via [[Aldgate tube station|Aldgate]].
**Clockwise:
***6 tph to [[Edgware Road tube station (Circle, District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines)|Edgware Road]] via [[Embankment tube station|Embankment]].

==Future==
A Transport Supporting Paper released by the office of the Mayor of London envisages the closure of [[Tower Gateway DLR station]] and the branch serving it, with a replacement interchange being provided via new platforms at Tower Hill tube station. The reasoning is given that currently, 90 per cent of DLR City passengers use Bank station, but only 75 per cent of services go there; this would increase service to Bank from 23tph to 30tph, thereby unlocking more capacity on the Bank branch.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Transport%20Supporting%20Paper_3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connections==
[[London Buses route 15]] and [[London Buses route 15 (Heritage)|heritage route 15H]] and night route [[London Buses route N15|N15]] serve the station.
