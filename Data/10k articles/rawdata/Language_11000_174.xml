The '''Bengali Wikipedia''' or '''Bangla Wikipedia''' ({{lang-bn|{{#property:P1448}}}}, ''Bānglā u'ikipiḍiẏā'') is the [[Bengali language]] edition of [[Wikipedia]], the free online encyclopedia. It also has a phonetic Latin alphabet to [[Bengali script]] tool so Latin alphabet keyboards can be used to type Bengali without downloading any software.

Launched in January 27, 2004, it surpassed 10,000 articles in October 2006, becoming the second South-Asian language to do so.&lt;ref name="Nazmul"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/tech/news/article_1206718.php/Bengali_Wikipedia_crosses_10000_articles|title=Bengali Wikipedia crosses 10,000 articles|last=Noronha|first=Frederick|date=September 30, 2006|work=[[Indo-Asian News Service]]|publisher=[[Monsters and Critics]]|access-date=25 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226084330/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/tech/news/article_1206718.php/Bengali_Wikipedia_crosses_10000_articles|archivedate=26 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In {{Date}}, total article crossed [[Special:Statistics|{{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|bn|N}}]] articles.&lt;ref&gt;This prediction is based on &lt;nowiki&gt;{{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|bn|N}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; Wikipedia template that automatically updates article numbers.

==Early History==
In February 2002, the developers started creating language-code based sub-domains for different language Wikipedias. Along with other Wikipedia sub-domains, Bengali language sub-domain was created at that time. A placeholder page was created automatically in that sub-domain on June 1, 2002. On December 9, 2003, A Bangladeshi Ph.D. student of Canada's McGill University named Shah Asaduzzaman emailed Wikipedia Founder [[Jimmy Wales]] with a request to create Bengali Wikipedia. As a result, the developers created a test page on the Wikipedia named "Home Page" on December 26 of the same year.

The Main Page of Bengali Wikipedia was created on January 27, 2004 from an IP address which marks the official beginning of Bengali Wikipedia. '[[:bn:বাংলা ভাষা|বাংলা ভাষা]]' ("Bānglā Bhāshā"; Bengali Language in English) is the first article of Bengali Wikipedia which was created on May 24, 2004.

==History==
Bengali Wikipedia started its journey in January 27, 2004.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kalerkantho.com/online/techbishwa/2017/02/25/467581|title=একনজরে বাংলা উইকিপিডিয়া - কালের কণ্ঠ|first=Kaler|last=Kantho|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kalerkantho.com/print-edition/tech-everyday/2018/01/28/595065|title=১৪ বছরে বাংলা উইকিপিডিয়া - কালের কণ্ঠ|first=Kaler|last=Kantho|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back then, the people of [[Bangladesh]] had a little interest in Wikipedia. A few students and scholars used the [[English Wikipedia]], but it was not accountable. Besides that, there were various difficulties contributing in Bengali. The whole scenario has been changed in 2006.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kalerkantho.com/online/techbishwa/2017/02/25/467571|title=যুগ পেরিয়ে বাংলা উইকিপিডিয়া - কালের কণ্ঠ|first=Kaler|last=Kantho|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, the Bengali blogging world was growing slowly, and many people became accustomed to Bengali computing where a [[free and open-source]] Bengali typing tool, [[Avro Keyboard]] played a key role. On March 25, 2006, a Wiki team was created by the ‘Bangladesh Open Source Network’ (BdOSN) to popularize Wikipedia throughout the country.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The aim was to represent the country to the world through Wikipedia and build a complete encyclopedia in Bengali.

At that time, Bengali Wikipedia had only 500 articles. ‘BdOSN wiki team’ managed to spread the word through some newspapers and start a Bengali Wiki mailing list. Soon, many Bengali-speaking people from Bangladesh and abroad joined them in this dynamic project. As a result, by the end of the October, Bengali Wikipedia got to 10,000 articles.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Among the South Asian language Wikipedias, Bengali Wikipedia reached that milestone first, and many of these articles were illustrated with photos from the demonstrator of [[Bengali language movement|Bengali Language Movement]] Dr. Rafiqul Islam, who donated all his historical photographs taken during the language movement to [[Wikimedia Commons]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

One of the pioneer of the Bengali Wikipedia, Dr. Ragib Hasan said that {{quote|“The biggest challenge was writing something on internet in Bengali. The Bengali Unicode was not supported on most operating systems, only few websites on the internet supported Bengali Unicode, and users had difficulties configuring it. Moreover, the idea of writing something with Bengali Unicode was new. … in the beginning, the idea of a Wikipedia in Bengali was not actually workable.”&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;}}

Between 2009 and 2010, Bengali speakers from [[West Bengal]], India also started to contribute to Bengali Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; In the meantime, the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] started their operations and in October 3, 2011 a local chapter named [[Wikimedia Bangladesh]] was approved in Bangladesh&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; by the Foundation to promote educational content in Bengali. On February 26, 2015, [[Jimmy Wales]], the co-founder of Wikipedia—visited Bangladesh for a celebration program that was organized by [[Wikimedia Bangladesh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.prothomalo.com/science-technology/news/59709/Wikipedia-co-founder-arrive-Dhaka|title=Wikipedia co-founder arrive Dhaka|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prothomalo.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prothomalo.com/technology/article/463339/%E0%A6%AF%E0%A7%87-%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%BE-%E0%A6%A6%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BC%E0%A7%87-%E0%A6%97%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B2%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%A8-%E0%A6%9C%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AE%E0%A6%BF-%E0%A6%93%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BC%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%B8|title=যে বার্তা দিয়ে গেলেন জিমি ওয়েলস|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://somoynews.tv/pages/details/%E0%A6%A2%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BC-%E0%A6%89%E0%A6%87%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%A1%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%B9-%E0%A6%AA%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B7%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%A0%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%BE-%E0%A6%9C%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AE%E0%A6%BF-%E0%A6%93%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BC%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%B8|title=ঢাকায় উইকিপিডিয়ার সহ-প্রতিষ্ঠাতা জিমি ওয়েলস|first=|last=webdesk@somoynews.tv|website=somoynews.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt; to mark the tenth year of Bengali Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="prothomalo.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thedhakatimes.com/58671/bengali-wikipedia-third-language/|title=গভীরতার বিচারে বাংলা উইকিপিডিয়ায় তৃতীয় ভাষা - The Dhaka Times|first=The Dhaka|last=Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntvbd.com/tech/2524/%E0%A6%89%E0%A6%87%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%A1%E0%A6%BF%E0%A7%9F%E0%A6%BE%E0%A7%9F-%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%83%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%80%E0%A7%9F-%E0%A6%AD%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B7%E0%A6%BE-%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%82%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE|title=উইকিপিডিয়ায় তৃতীয় ভাষা বাংলা|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prothomalo.com/technology/article/460678/|title=বাংলাদেশে আসছেন জিমি ওয়েলস|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.ntvbd.com/sci-tech/1377/GP-subscribers-get-free-Wikipedia-access/print|title=GP subscribers get free Wikipedia access|first=|last=ntv.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his keynote, Jimmy said that according to the article depth, Bengali Wikipedia is rated quite well.&lt;ref name="prothomalo.com"/&gt;

== Name ==
{{Main article|Names of Bengal}}
In modern usage, "Bengali" or "Bangali" is used to refer to anyone whose linguistic, cultural, family ancestral or genetic origins are from [[Bengal]]. Their [[ethnonym]] is derived from the ancient Banga or Bangla. The exact origin of the word ''Bangla'' is unknown, though it is believed to be derived from the Dravidian-speaking tribe ''Bang/Banga'' that settled in the area around the year 2500&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name="congress"&gt;{{cite book

According to the [[Mahabharata]], the [[Puranas]] and the [[Harivamsha]], Vanga was one of the adopted sons of King Vali who founded the [[Vanga Kingdom]]. It was either under Magadh or under Kalinga Rules except few years under Pals.The Muslim accounts refer that "Bong", a son of Hind (son of Hām who was a son of Prophet [[Noah]]/Nooh) colonised the area for the first time.&lt;ref name="riaj"&gt;[http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=07601010&amp;ct=11 RIYAZU-S-SALĀTĪN: A History of Bengal], [[Ghulam Husain Salim]], The Asiatic Society, Calcutta, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to "Vangala" (''Bôngal'') has been traced in the Nesari plates (805 CE) of [[Rashtrakuta]] [[Govinda III]] which speak of [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]] as the king of Vangala.

An interesting theory of the origin of the name is provided by ''[[Abu'l-Fazl]]'' in his ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]''. According to him, "The original name of Bengal was Bung, and the suffix ''"al"'' came to be added to it from the fact that the ancient rajahs of this land raised mounds of earth 10 feet high and 20 in breadth in lowlands at the foot of the hills which were called "al". From this suffix added to the Bung, the name Bengal arose and gained currency".&lt;ref&gt;Land of Two Rivers, [[Nitish Sengupta]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kingdoms of [[Pundra]] and [[Vanga]] were formed in Bengal and were first described in the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'' around 1000 BCE as well as in Hindu epic [[Mahabharata]]. [[Anga]] and later [[Magadha]] expanded to include most of the [[Bihar]] and [[Bengal]] regions. It was one of the four main kingdoms of India at the time of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and was one of the sixteen [[Mahajanapadas]]. Under the [[Maurya Empire]] founded by [[Chandragupta Maurya]], Magadha extended over nearly all of South Asia, including parts of [[Balochistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], reaching its greatest extent under the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] emperor [[Ashoka the Great]] in the 3rd century BCE.

One of the earliest foreign references to Bengal is the mention of a land ruled by the king Xandrammes named [[Gangaridai]] by the [[Greeks]] around 100 BCE. The word is speculated to have come from ''Gangahrd'' ('Land with the [[Ganges]] in its heart') in reference to an area in Bengal.&lt;ref name=Gangaridai&gt;{{cite book

[[Tilopa]] was also from the Bengal region.

The Pala Empire enjoyed relations with the [[Srivijaya Empire]], the [[Tibetan Empire]], and the [[Arab]] [[Abbasid Caliphate]].

Islam was introduced to the [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet region]] by the Muslim saint [[Shah Jalal]] in the early 14th century.

===Mughal era===

The [[Mughal Empire]] conquered Bengal in the 16th century. Mughal general [[Man Singh]] conquered parts of Bengal including [[Dhaka]] during the time of Emperor [[Akbar]]. A few [[Rajput]] tribes from his army permanently settled around Dhaka and surrounding lands. Later, in the early 17th century, [[Islam Khan I|Islam Khan]] conquered all of Bengal. However, administration by governors appointed by the court of the [[Mughal Empire]] gave way to semi-independence of the area under the [[Nawab]]s of [[Murshidabad]], who nominally respected the sovereignty of the Mughals in [[Delhi]].

The [[Bengal Subah]] province in the Mughal Empire was the wealthiest state in the subcontinent. Bengal's trade and wealth impressed the Mughals so much that it was described as the ''Paradise of the Nations'' by the [[Mughal Emperor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Collection of Treaties and Engagements with the Native Princes and States of Asia: Concluded on Behalf of the East India Company by the British Governments in India, Viz. by the Government of Bengal Etc. : Also Copies of Sunnuds Or Grants of Certain Privileges and Imunities to the East India Company by the Mogul and Other Native Princes of Hindustan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_1RAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA28 |accessdate=23 August 2013|year=1812|publisher=United East-India Company|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of shipbuilding tonnage during the 16th–18th centuries, the annual output of Bengal alone totaled around 2,232,500 tons, larger than the combined output of the Dutch (450,000–550,000 tons), the British (340,000 tons), and North America (23,061 tons).&lt;ref name="ray174"&gt;Ray, Indrajit (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=CHOrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA174 ''Bengal Industries and the British Industrial Revolution (1757–1857)'', page 174], [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|1136825525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the weakening of the Mughal Empire with the death of [[Emperor Aurangzeb]] in 1707, Bengal was ruled independently by the Nawabs until 1757, when the region was annexed by the [[East India Company]] after the [[Battle of Plassey]].

===British colonization===

{{See|Company rule in India|British Raj}}

In Bengal effective political and military power was transferred from the old regime to the [[British East India Company]] around 1757–65.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=251|isbn=9781107507180}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Company rule in India]] began under the [[Bengal Presidency]]. [[Calcutta]] was named the capital of [[British India]] in 1772. The presidency was run by a military-civil administration, including the [[Bengal Army]], and had the world's sixth earliest railway network. Great [[Famines in India|Bengal famines]] struck several times during colonial rule, notably the [[Great Bengal famine of 1770]] and [[Bengal famine of 1943]], each killing millions of Bengalis.

Under British rule, Bengal experienced [[deindustrialization]].&lt;ref name="ray"&gt;Ray, Indrajit (2011). [https://books.google.com/books?id=CHOrAgAAQBAJ ''Bengal Industries and the British Industrial Revolution (1757–1857)''], [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|1136825525}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] was initiated on the outskirts of Calcutta, and spread to Dhaka, Chittagong, Jalpaiguri, Sylhet and Agartala, in solidarity with revolts in North India. The failure of the rebellion led to the abolishment of the Mughal Court and direct rule by the [[British Raj]].

===Bengal Renaissance===
{{Main|Bengal Renaissance}}

[[Bengal Renaissance]] refers to a socio-religious reform movement during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, centered around the city of [[Calcutta]] and predominantly led by upper caste [[Bengali Hindu]]s under the patronage of the [[British Raj]] who created a reformed religion called [[Brahmo]] dharma. The Bengal renaissance can be said to have started with reformer and humanitarian [[Raja Ram Mohan Roy]] (1775–1833), considered the "Father of the Bengal Renaissance", and ended with Asia's first Nobel laureate [[Rabindranath Tagore]] (1861–1941), although there have been many stalwarts thereafter embodying particular aspects of the unique intellectual and creative output.&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Bengali-speaking People'' by Nitish Sengupta, p 211, UBS Publishers' Distributors Pvt. Ltd. {{ISBN|81-7476-355-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nineteenth-century Bengal was a unique blend of religious and social reformers, scholars, literary giants, journalists, patriotic orators and scientists, all merging to form the image of a renaissance, and marked the transition from 'medieval' to 'modern'.&lt;ref&gt;''Calcutta and the Bengal Renaissance'' by Sumit Sarkar in ''Calcutta, the Living City'' edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Vol I, p 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other figures have been considered to be part of the Renaissance. [[Swami Vivekananda]] is considered a key figure in the introduction of [[Vedanta]] and [[Yoga]] in Europe and America&lt;ref name="Feuerstein"&gt;

[[Satyendra Nath Bose]] was a Bengali [[physicist]], specializing in [[mathematical physics]]. He is best known for his work on [[quantum mechanics]] in the early 1920s, providing the foundation for [[Bose–Einstein statistics]] and the theory of the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]. He is honoured as the namesake of the [[boson]].

Though the Bengal Renaissance was the "culmination of the process of emergence of the cultural characteristics of the Bengali people that had started in the age of [[Alauddin Hussain Shah|Hussein Shah]], it remained predominantly Hindu and only partially [[Muslim]]." There were, nevertheless, examples of Muslim intellectuals such as [[Syed Ameer Ali]], [[Mir Mosharraf Hossain|Mosharraf Hussain]],&lt;ref&gt;''History of Bengali-speaking People'' by Nitish Sengupta, p 210, 212-213.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sake Dean Mahomed]], [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], and [[Roquia Sakhawat Hussain]]. The [[Freedom of Intellect Movement]] sought to challenge religious and social dogma in [[Bengali Muslim]] society.

===Independence movement===
{{see also|Freedom fighters of India#Leaders from Bengal and Northeastern India|l1=Independence fighters from Bengal}}
Bengal played a major role in the [[Indian independence movement]], in which [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|revolutionary groups]] such as [[Anushilan Samiti]] and [[Jugantar]] were dominant. Many of the early proponents of the independence struggle, and subsequent leaders in the movement were Bengalis such as [[Chittaranjan Das]], [[Khwaja Salimullah]], [[Surendranath Banerjea]], [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]], [[Subhas Chandra Bose|Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose]], [[Titumir]] (Sayyid Mir Nisar Ali), [[Prafulla Chaki]], [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]], [[Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani]], [[Bagha Jatin]], [[Khudiram Bose]], [[Surya Sen]], Binoy-Badal-Dinesh, [[Sarojini Naidu]], [[Aurobindo Ghosh]], [[Rashbehari Bose]], and [[Sachindranath Sanyal]].

Some of these leaders, such as Netaji, who was born, raised and educated at Cuttack in Odisha did not subscribe to the view that non-violent civil disobedience was the best way to achieve Indian Independence, and were instrumental in armed resistance against the British force. Netaji was the co-founder and leader of the Japanese-aligned [[Indian National Army]] (distinct from the army of British India) that challenged British forces in several parts of India. He was also the head of state of a parallel regime, the [[Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind]]. Bengal was also the fostering ground for several prominent revolutionary organisations, the most notable of which was [[Anushilan Samiti]]. A number of Bengalis died during the independence movement and many were imprisoned in [[Cellular Jail]], the notorious prison in [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]].

===Partitions of Bengal===
{{Main article|1905 Partition of Bengal|1947 Partition of Bengal}}
The [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|first partition in 1905]] divided the Bengal region in [[British India]] into two provinces for administrative and development purposes. However, the partition stoked [[Hindu nationalism]]. This in turn led to the formation of the [[All India Muslim League]] in Dhaka in 1906 to represent the growing aspirations of the [[Muslim]] population. The partition was annulled in 1912 after protests by the [[Indian National Congress]] and [[Hindu Mahasabha]].

The breakdown of Hindu-Muslim unity in India drove the Muslim League to adopt the [[Lahore Resolution]] in 1943, calling the creation of "independent states" in eastern and northwestern British India. The resolution paved the way for the [[Partition of British India]] based on the [[Radcliffe Line]] in 1947, despite attempts to form a [[United Bengal]] state that was opposed by many people.

The legacy of partition has left lasting differences between the two sides of Bengal, most notably in linguistic accent and cuisine.
===Bangladesh Liberation War===
{{Main article|Bangladesh Liberation War}}
The rise of [[self-determination]] and [[Bengali nationalism]] movements in [[East Bengal]] (later [[East Pakistan]]), led by [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], culminated in the 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] against the Pakistani military junta. An estimated 3 million (3,000,000) people died in the conflict, particularly as a result of the [[1971 Bangladesh genocide]]. The war caused millions of East Pakistani refugees to take shelter in India's Bengali state [[West Bengal]], with [[Calcutta]], the capital of West Bengal province, becoming the capital-in-exile of the [[Provisional Government of Bangladesh]]. The [[Mukti Bahini]] guerrilla forces waged a nine-month war against the Pakistani military. The conflict ended after the [[Indian Armed Forces]] intervened on the side of Bangladeshi forces in the final two weeks of the war, which ended with the [[Surrender of Pakistan]] and the liberation of Dhaka on 16 December 1971.

{{Culture of Bengal}}

=== Cuisine ===
Bengali cuisine is the culinary style originating in Bengal, a region of the Indian subcontinent which is now located in Bangladesh and West Bengal. Some Indian regions like [[Tripura]], [[Shillong]] and the Barak Valley region of
[[Assam]] (in India) also have large native Bengali populations and share this cuisine. With an emphasis on fish, vegetables, and milk served with rice as a staple diet, Bengali cuisine is known for its subtle flavours, and its huge spread of confectioneries and desserts. It also has the only traditionally developed multi-course tradition from the Indian subcontinent that is analogous in structure
to the modern service à la russe style of French cuisine, with food served course-wise rather than all at once.

=== Festivals ===
{{Main article|List of festivals in Bangladesh}}
Bengalis celebrate the major holidays of the Muslim and Hindu faiths. For Muslims, these include [[Eid-ul-Azha]], [[Eid-ul-Fitr]], and [[Muharram]]. Although Bengali Hindus observe [[Holi]], [[Diwali]], and other important religious festivals, [[Durga Puja]] is the biggest and most important to them. Dedicated to the goddess Durga, who is a manifestation of Shakti, the festivities last for five days. Months before the festival, special clay idols of Durga and her children are made. These show her mounted on a lion and killing the evil demon Mahishasura. These lavishly painted and decorated idols are displayed and worshipped on each day of the festival in the pandals and at homes. On the tenth day, the idols are decorated with flowers and carried through the streets in processions. The procession makes its way to a river or other body of water, where the image of Durga is immersed in the water.

=== Language ===
{{main article|Bengali language}}
Bengali or Bangla is the language native to the region of Bengal, which comprises present-day Bangladesh and the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura and southern Assam. It is written using the [[Bengali script]]. With about 250 million native and about 300 million total speakers worldwide, Bengali is one of the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|most spoken languages]], ranked seventh in the world.&lt;ref name="popstat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=size |title=Statistical Summaries |accessdate=23 May 2012|year=2012|website =|publisher=Ethnologue}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huq_sarkar"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huq |first1=Mohammad Daniul |last2=Sarkar |first2=Pabitra |year=2012 |chapter=Bangla Language |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Language |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Amar Sonar Bangla|National Anthem of Bangladesh]], [[Jana Gana Mana|National Anthem of India]] and the [[Vande Mataram|National Song of India]] were first composed in the Bengali language.

Along with other Eastern Indo-Aryan languages, Bengali evolved circa 1000–1200 CE from eastern Middle Indo-Aryan dialects such as the Magadhi [[Prakrit]] and [[Pali]], which developed from a dialect or group of dialects that were close, but not identical to, [[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]] and [[Classical Sanskrit]].

=== Literature ===
{{Main article|Bengali literature|Middle Bengali literature}}
The earliest extant work in Bengali literature is the ''Charyapada'', a collection of Buddhist mystic songs dating back to the 10th and 11th centuries. Thereafter, the timeline of Bengali literature is divided into two periods: medieval (1360–1800) and modern (1800–present). Bengali literature is one of the most enriched bodies of literature in Modern India and Bangladesh.

The first works in Bengali, written in new Bengali, appeared between 10th and 12th centuries CE It is generally known as the ''Charyapada''. These are mystic songs composed by various Buddhist seer-poets: Luipada, Kanhapada, Kukkuripada, Chatilpada, Bhusukupada, Kamlipada, Dhendhanpada, Shantipada, Shabarapada, etc. The famous Bengali linguist Haraprasad Shastri discovered the palm-leaf ''Charyapada'' manuscript in the Nepal Royal Court Library in 1907.

The Middle Bengali Literature is a period in the history of Bengali literature dating from 15th to 18th centuries. Following the Mughal invasion of Bengal in the 13th century, literature in vernacular Bengali began to take shape. The oldest example of Middle Bengali literature is believed to be ''Shreekrishna Kirtana'' by Boru Chandidas.
In the mid-19th century, Bengali literature gained momentum. During this period, the Bengali Pandits of Fort William College did the tedious work of translating textbooks in Bengali to help teach the British local languages including Bengali. This work played a role in the background in the evolution of Bengali prose.

=== Religion ===
{{Main article|Demographics of Bangladesh|West Bengal#Demographics|Tripura#Demographics|Andaman and Nicobar Islands#Demographics}}
{{See also|Religion in Bangladesh|Christianity in West Bengal}}

The largest religions practiced in Bengal are Islam and Hinduism. According to 2014 US Department of State estimates, 89.9% of the population of Bangladesh follow Islam while 8.3% follow Hinduism. In West Bengal, Hindus are the majority with 70.54% of the population while Muslims comprise 27.01%. Other religious groups include [[Buddhism in Bangladesh|Buddhists]] (comprising around 1% of the population in Bangladesh) and Christians.&lt;ref name="relegionindia" /&gt;

{{expand section|date=May 2017}}
Bengali theater traces its roots to Sanskrit drama under the [[Gupta Empire]] in the 4th century CE. It includes narrative forms, song and dance forms, supra-personae forms, performance with scroll paintings, puppet theatre and the processional forms like the [[Jatra (theatre)|Jatra]]. 

Bengal has an extremely rich heritage of dancing dating back to antiquity. It includes classical, folk and martial dance traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hasan |first=Sheikh Mehedi |year=2012 |chapter=Dance |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Dance |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ahmed |first=Wakil |year=2012 |chapter=Folk Dances |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Folk_Dances

'''Bharata Muni'''  was an ancient [[India]]n [[theatrologist]] and [[musicologist]] who wrote the  [[Natya Shastra]], a [[theoretical]] [[treatise]] on ancient [[India]]n [[dramaturgy]] and [[Acting|histrionics]], especially [[Sanskrit theatre]]. Bharata is considered the father of Indian theatrical art forms. The ''Nattiyam'' comprises 36 chapters and is possibly the creation of more than one scholar.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Natyashastra (Indian drama treatise) |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/64008/Bharata |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Indian [[dance in India|dance]] and [[music of India|music]] find their root in the ''Nattiyam''. Besides propounding a theory of three types of acting, Bharata discusses in detail the classical Indian [[vocal]]/[[instrumental]] music and dance integral to [[Tamil culture|Tamil]] drama. Bharata classified [[Sanskrit]] theatrical forms (Natyam/Rupaka) into ten types, of which drama (''nataka'') is one. Bharata also outlines a set of [[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasas]] or moods/[[emotions]] that were to be influential in defining the nature of Indian dance, music, and theatre.

The books,"Natyasashtra" by '''Bharata Muni''' and "Abinav Darpan" by Nandikeshwar are considered to be the original sources of Bharatnatyam(an indian classical dance form).

In [[set theory]], '''Cantor's diagonal argument''', also called the '''diagonalisation argument''', the '''diagonal slash argument''' or the '''diagonal method''', was published in 1891 by [[Georg Cantor]] as a [[mathematical proof]] that there are [[infinite set]]s which cannot be put into [[bijection|one-to-one correspondence]] with the infinite set of [[natural number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Georg Cantor |title=Ueber eine elementare Frage der Mannigfaltigkeitslehre |journal=[[Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung]] 1890–1891 |volume=1 |pages=75–78 |year=1891|url=https://www.digizeitschriften.de/dms/img/?PID=GDZPPN002113910&amp;physid=phys84#navi}} English translation: {{cite book |last=Ewald |first=William B.

Such sets are now known as [[uncountable set]]s, and the size of infinite sets is now treated by the theory of [[cardinal number]]s which Cantor began.

The diagonal argument was not Cantor's [[Cantor's first uncountability proof|first proof]] of the uncountability of the [[real number]]s, which appeared in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |surname=Gray|given=Robert|year=1994 |url=http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Ford/Gray819-832.pdf |title=Georg Cantor and Transcendental Numbers|journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]]|volume=101|issue=9|pages=819–832 |doi=10.2307/2975129|jstor=2975129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloch2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloch|first1=Ethan D.|title=The Real Numbers and Real Analysis|date=2011|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-72176-7|page=429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uncountable set ==
In his 1891 article, Cantor considered the set ''T'' of all infinite [[sequences]] of [[binary digits]] (i.e. each digit is zero or one).
He begins with a [[constructive proof]] of the following theorem:
:If ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, … is any enumeration of elements from ''T'', then there is always an element ''s'' of ''T'' which corresponds to no ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in the enumeration.
The proof starts with an enumeration of elements from ''T'', for example:
:{|
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = || (0, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 0, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = || (1, || 1, || 1, || 1, || 1, || 1, || 1, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = || (0, || 1, || 0, || 1, || 0, || 1, || 0, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = || (1, || 0, || 1, || 0, || 1, || 0, || 1, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = || (1, || 1, || 0, || 1, || 0, || 1, || 1, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; = || (0, || 0, || 1, || 1, || 0, || 1, || 1, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; = || (1, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 1, || 0, || 0, || ...)
|-
| ...
|}
Next, a sequence ''s'' is constructed by choosing the 1st digit as [[Ones' complement|complementary]] to the 1st digit of ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; (swapping '''0'''s for '''1'''s and vice versa), the 2nd digit as complementary to the 2nd digit of ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;, the 3rd digit as complementary to the 3rd digit of ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;, and generally for every ''n'', the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; digit as complementary to the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; digit of ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. For the example above, this yields:
:{|
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || = || (&lt;u&gt;'''0'''&lt;/u&gt;, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 0, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || = || (1, || &lt;u&gt;'''1'''&lt;/u&gt;, || 1, || 1, || 1, || 1, || 1, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; || = || (0, || 1, || &lt;u&gt;'''0'''&lt;/u&gt;, || 1, || 0, || 1, || 0, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; || = || (1, || 0, || 1, || &lt;u&gt;'''0'''&lt;/u&gt;, || 1, || 0, || 1, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; || = || (1, || 1, || 0, || 1, || &lt;u&gt;'''0'''&lt;/u&gt;, || 1, || 1, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; || = || (0, || 0, || 1, || 1, || 0, || &lt;u&gt;'''1'''&lt;/u&gt;, || 1, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; || = || (1, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 1, || 0, || &lt;u&gt;'''0'''&lt;/u&gt;, || ...)
|-
| ...
|-
|
|-
| ''s'' || = || (&lt;u&gt;'''1'''&lt;/u&gt;, || &lt;u&gt;'''0'''&lt;/u&gt;, || &lt;u&gt;'''1'''&lt;/u&gt;, || &lt;u&gt;'''1'''&lt;/u&gt;, || &lt;u&gt;'''1'''&lt;/u&gt;, || &lt;u&gt;'''0'''&lt;/u&gt;, || &lt;u&gt;'''1'''&lt;/u&gt;, || ...)
|}
By construction, ''s'' differs from each ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, since their ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; digits differ (highlighted in the example).
Hence, ''s'' cannot occur in the enumeration.

Based on this theorem, Cantor then uses a [[proof by contradiction]] to show that:
:The set ''T'' is uncountable.
The proof starts by assuming that ''T'' is [[countable set#Definition|countable]].
Then all its elements can be written as an enumeration ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, … .
Applying the previous theorem to this enumeration produces a sequence ''s'' not belonging to the enumeration. However, this contradicts ''s'' being an element of ''T'' and therefore belonging to the enumeration. This contradiction implies that the original assumption is false. Therefore, ''T'' is uncountable.

=== Interpretation ===
The interpretation of Cantor's result will depend upon one's view of mathematics. To [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivists]], the argument shows no more than that there is no [[bijection]] between the natural numbers and ''T''. It does not rule out the possibility that the latter are [[subcountable]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} In the context of [[classical mathematics]], this is impossible, and the diagonal argument establishes that, although both sets are infinite, there are actually ''more'' infinite sequences of ones and zeros than there are natural numbers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== Real numbers ===
The uncountability of the [[real number]]s was already established by [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]], but it also follows from the above result. To prove this, an [[injective function|injection]] will be constructed from the set ''T'' of infinite binary strings to the set '''R''' of real numbers. Since ''T'' is uncountable, the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of this function, which is a subset of '''R''', is uncountable. Therefore, '''R''' is uncountable. Also, by using a method of construction devised by Cantor, a [[bijection]] will be constructed between ''T'' and '''R'''. Therefore, ''T'' and '''R''' have the same cardinality, which is called the "[[cardinality of the continuum]]" and is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;.

An injection from ''T'' to '''R'''  is given by mapping strings in ''T'' to decimals, such as mapping ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0111… to the decimal 0.0111…. This function, defined by {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}(''t'') {{=}} 0.''t''}}, is an injection because it maps different strings to different numbers. 

Instead of mapping 0111… to the decimal 0.0111…, it can be mapped to the [[radix|base]] ''b'' number: 0.0111…&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;. This leads to the family of functions: {{nowrap|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;{{space|hair}}(''t'') {{=}} 0.''t''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The functions {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}} are injections, except for {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}}. This function will be modified to produce a bijection between ''T'' and '''R'''.

This construction uses a method devised by Cantor that was published in 1878. He used it to construct a bijection between the [[closed interval]] [0, 1] and the [[irrational number|irrational]]s in the [[open interval]] (0,&amp;nbsp;1). He first removed a [[countably infinite]] subset from each of these sets so that there is a bijection between the remaining uncountable sets. Since there is a bijection between the countably infinite subsets that have been removed, combining the two bijections produces a bijection between the original sets.&lt;ref&gt;See page 254 of {{Citation|author=Georg Cantor|title=Ein Beitrag zur Mannigfaltigkeitslehre|url=http://www.digizeitschriften.de/dms/img/?PID=GDZPPN002156806|volume=84|pages=242&amp;ndash;258|journal=Journal für die Reine und Angewandte Mathematik|year=1878}}. This proof is discussed in {{Citation|author=Joseph Dauben|title=Georg Cantor: His Mathematics and Philosophy of the Infinite|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1979|isbn=0-674-34871-0}}, pp. 61&amp;ndash;62, 65. On page 65, Dauben proves a result that is stronger than Cantor's. He lets "''φ&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;'' denote any sequence of rationals in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]." Cantor lets ''φ&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;'' denote a sequence [[Enumeration|enumerating]] the rationals in [0,&amp;nbsp;1], which is the kind of sequence needed for his construction of a bijection between [0,&amp;nbsp;1] and the irrationals in (0,&amp;nbsp;1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantor's method can be used to modify the function {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') {{=}} 0.''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} to produce a bijection from ''T'' to (0,&amp;nbsp;1). Because some numbers have two binary expansions, {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}} is not even [[injective function|injective]]. For example, {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(1000…) {{=}}}} 0.1000…&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 1/2 and {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(0111…) {{=}}}} 0.0111…&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|[[Infinite series|1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + …]] {{=}}}} 1/2, so both 1000… and 0111… map to the same number, 1/2. 

To modify {{nowrap|''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{space|hair}}(''t'')}}, observe that it is a bijection except for a countably infinite subset of (0,&amp;nbsp;1) and a countably infinite subset of ''T''. It is not a bijection for the numbers in (0,&amp;nbsp;1) that have two [[binary expansion]]s. These are called [[dyadic_rational|dyadic]] numbers and have the form {{nowrap|''m''{{space|hair}}/{{space|hair}}2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} where ''m'' is an odd integer and ''n'' is a natural number. Put these numbers in the sequence: ''r''&amp;nbsp;= (1/2, 1/4, 3/4, 1/8, 3/8, 5/8, 7/8,&amp;nbsp;…). Also, {{nowrap|''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{space|hair}}(''t'')}} is not a bijection to (0,&amp;nbsp;1) for the strings in ''T'' appearing after the [[binary point]] in the binary expansions of 0, 1, and the numbers in sequence ''r''. Put these eventually-constant strings in the sequence: ''s''&amp;nbsp;= ({{color|#808080|000}}…, {{color|#808080|111}}…, 1{{color|#808080|000}}…, 0{{color|#808080|111}}…, 01{{color|#808080|000}}…, 00{{color|#808080|111}}…, 11{{color|#808080|000}}…, 10{{color|#808080|111}}…,&amp;nbsp;...). Define the bijection ''g''(''t'') from ''T'' to (0,&amp;nbsp;1): If ''t'' is the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; string in sequence ''s'', let ''g''(''t'') be the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; number in sequence ''r''{{space|hair}}; otherwise, ''g''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

To construct a bijection from ''T'' to '''R''', start with the [[trigonometric functions|tangent function]] tan(''x''), which is a bijection from (−π/2,&amp;nbsp;π/2) to '''R''' (see the figure shown on the right). Next observe that the [[linear function]] ''h''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|π''x'' – π/2}} is a bijection from (0,&amp;nbsp;1) to (−π/2,&amp;nbsp;π/2) (see the figure shown on the left). The [[function composition|composite function]] tan(''h''(''x''))&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|tan(π''x'' – π/2)}} is a bijection from (0,&amp;nbsp;1) to '''R'''. Composing this function with ''g''(''t'') produces the function tan(''h''(''g''(''t'')))&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|tan(π''g''(''t'') – π/2)}}, which is a bijection from ''T'' to '''R'''.

== General sets ==
[[File:Diagonal argument powerset svg.svg|thumb|250px|Illustration of the generalized diagonal argument: The set ''T'' = {''n''∈ℕ: ''n''∉''f''(''n'')} at the bottom cannot occur anywhere in the range of ''f'':[[natural number|ℕ]]→[[power set|'''''P''''']](ℕ). The example mapping ''f'' happens to correspond to the example enumeration ''s'' in the [[#Lead|above]] picture.]]
A generalized form of the diagonal argument was used by Cantor to prove [[Cantor's theorem]]: for every [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'', the [[power set]] of ''S''—that is, the set of all [[subset]]s of ''S'' (here written as '''''P'''''(''S''))—has a larger cardinality than ''S'' itself. This proof proceeds as follows:

Let ''f'' be any [[Function (mathematics)|function]] from ''S'' to '''''P'''''(''S'').  It suffices to prove ''f'' cannot be [[surjective]]. That means that some member ''T'' of '''''P'''''(''S''), i.e. some subset of ''S'', is not in the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of ''f''.  As a candidate consider the set:

:''T'' = { ''s'' ∈ ''S'': ''s'' ∉ ''f''(''s'') }.

For every ''s'' in ''S'', either ''s'' is in ''T'' or not. If ''s'' is in ''T'', then by definition of ''T'', ''s'' is not in ''f''(''s''), so ''T'' is not equal to ''f''(''s''). On the other hand,  if ''s'' is not in ''T'', then by definition of ''T'', ''s'' is in ''f''(''s''), so again ''T'' is not equal to ''f''(''s''); cf. picture.
For a more complete account of this proof, see [[Cantor's theorem]].

===Consequences===
This result implies that the notion of the [[set of all sets]] is an inconsistent notion.  If ''S'' were the set of all sets then '''''P'''''(''S'') would at the same time be bigger than ''S'' and a subset of ''S''.

[[Russell's Paradox]] has shown us that [[naive set theory]], based on an [[unrestricted comprehension]] scheme, is contradictory.  Note that there is a similarity between the construction of ''T'' and the set in Russell's paradox. Therefore, depending on how we modify the axiom scheme of comprehension in order to avoid Russell's paradox, arguments such as the non-existence of a set of all sets may or may not remain valid.

The diagonal argument shows that the set of real numbers is "bigger" than the set of natural numbers (and therefore, the integers and rationals as well). Therefore, we can ask if there is a set whose [[cardinality]] is "between" that of the integers and that of the reals. This question leads to the famous [[continuum hypothesis]]. Similarly, the question of whether there exists a set whose cardinality is between |''S''| and |'''''P'''''(''S'')| for some infinite ''S'' leads to the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]].

Analogues of the diagonal argument are widely used in mathematics to prove the existence or nonexistence of certain objects.  For example, the conventional proof of the unsolvability of the [[halting problem]] is essentially a diagonal argument.  Also, diagonalization was originally used to show the existence of arbitrarily hard [[complexity classes]] and played a key role in early attempts to prove [[P versus NP|P does not equal NP]].

===Version for Quine's New Foundations===
The above proof fails for [[W. V. Quine]]'s "[[New Foundations]]" set theory (NF). In NF, the [[unrestricted comprehension|naive axiom scheme of comprehension]] is modified to avoid the paradoxes by introducing a kind of "local" [[type theory]].  In this axiom scheme,

:{ ''s'' ∈ ''S'': ''s'' ∉ ''f''(''s'') }

is ''not'' a set — i.e., does not satisfy the axiom scheme.  On the other hand, we might try to create a modified diagonal argument by noticing that

:{ ''s'' ∈ ''S'': ''s'' ∉ ''f''({''s''}) }

''is'' a set in NF.  In which case, if '''''P'''''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'') is the set of one-element subsets of ''S'' and ''f'' is a proposed bijection from '''''P'''''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'') to '''''P'''''(''S''), one is able to use [[proof by contradiction]] to prove that |'''''P'''''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'')| &amp;lt; |'''''P'''''(''S'')|.

The proof follows by the fact that if ''f'' were indeed a map ''onto'' '''''P'''''(''S''), then we could find ''r'' in ''S'', such that  ''f''({''r''}) coincides with the modified diagonal set, above.  We would conclude that if ''r'' is not in ''f''({''r''}), then ''r'' is in ''f''({''r''}) and vice versa.

It is ''not'' possible to put '''''P'''''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'') in a one-to-one relation with ''S'', as the two have different types, and so any function so defined would violate the typing rules for the comprehension scheme.

{{Catalan language}}

The '''[[phonology]] of [[Catalan language|Catalan]]''', a [[Romance language]], has a certain degree of dialectal variation. Although there are two standard dialects, one based on [[Eastern Catalan]] and one based on [[Valencian]], this article deals with features of all or most dialects, as well as regional pronunciation differences. Various studies have focused on different Catalan varieties; for example, {{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|1979}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Mascaró|1976}} analyze Central Eastern varieties, the former focusing on the educated speech of [[Barcelona]] and the latter focusing more on the vernacular of Barcelona, and {{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|1986}} does a careful phonetic study of Central Eastern Catalan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hualde|1992|p=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more information on dialectal variety, see {{Harvcoltxt|Veny|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catalan is characterized by [[final-obstruent devoicing]], [[lenition]], and [[voicing assimilation]]; a [[vowel system|set]] of 7 or 8 [[phoneme|phonemic]] [[vowel]]s, vowel [[assimilation (phonology)|assimilations]] (including [[vowel harmony]]), many phonetic [[diphthong]]s, and [[vowel reduction]], whose precise details differ between dialects. Several dialects have a [[dark l|dark ''l'']], and all dialects have palatal ''l'' ({{IPAslink|ʎ}})&lt;!-- At least, the page currently does not report yeísmo. --&gt; and ''n'' ({{IPAslink|ɲ}}).

=== Obstruents ===
Voiced obstruents undergo [[final-obstruent devoicing]] so that {{lang|ca|fre'''d'''}} ('cold', [[grammatical gender|m.]] [[grammatical number|s.]]) is pronounced with {{IPA|[t]}}, while {{lang|ca|fre'''d'''es}} ('cold', [[grammatical gender|f.]] [[grammatical number|pl.]]) is pronounced with {{IPA|[ð]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lloret|2003|p=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Stops ====
Voiced stops become [[lenition|lenited]] to approximants in syllable onsets, after continuants:&lt;ref name="Wheeler10" /&gt; {{IPA|/b/}} → {{IPAblink|β}}, {{IPA|/d/}} → {{IPAblink|ð}}, {{IPA|/ɡ/}} → {{IPAblink|ɣ}}. Exceptions include {{IPA|/d/}} after [[lateral consonant]]s and {{IPA|/b/}} after {{IPA|/f/}}, e.g. {{lang|ca|ull '''d'''e bou}} {{IPA|[ˈuʎ də ˈβɔw]}} ('[[oeil-de-boeuf]]'), {{lang|ca|bolígraf '''b'''oníssim}} {{IPA|[buˈɫiɣɾəv buˈnisim]}} ('excellent ballpoint'). Additionally, {{IPA|/b/}} fails to lenite in non-betacist dialects. In the coda position, these sounds are always realized as stops&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hualde|1992|p=368}}&lt;/ref&gt; except in many Valencian dialects, where they are lenited.&lt;ref name="recasens2005"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|Espinosa|2005|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some Valencian dialects final {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} can be lenited before a vowel: {{lang|ca|to'''t''' açò}} {{IPA|[ˈt̪oð aˈsɔ]}} ('all this').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Saborit|2009|pp=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some dialects (e.g. many Valencian accents) initial {{IPA|/ɡ/}} can be lenited: {{lang|ca|gata}} {{IPA|[ˈɣat̪a]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Saborit|2009|pp=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many Catalan dialects (except Valencian), {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} may be [[gemination|geminated]] in certain environments (e.g. {{lang|ca|po'''b'''le}} {{IPA|[ˈpɔbːɫə]}} 'village', {{lang|ca|re'''g'''la}} {{IPA|[ˈreɡːɫə]}} 'rule').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Carbonell|Llisterri|1992|pp=53–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|1996|pp=190–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Balearic dialect|Majorcan]] varieties, {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} become {{IPAblink|c}} and {{IPAblink|ɟ}} word-finally and before front vowels,&lt;ref name="recasens2005" /&gt; in some of these dialects, this has extended to all environments except before [[liquid consonant|liquids]] and [[back vowel]]s; e.g. {{lang|ca|san'''g'''}} {{IPA|[ˈsaɲc]}} ('blood').&lt;ref name="Wheeler10" /&gt;

==== Affricates ====
The phonemic status of affricates is dubious; after other consonants, affricates are in free variation with fricatives, e.g. {{lang|ca|clen'''x'''a}} {{IPA|[ˈkɫɛɲtʃə]}} ~ {{IPA|[ˈkɫɛɲʃə]}} ('hair parting')&lt;ref name="wheeler11"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|2005|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be analyzed as either single phonemes or clusters of a stop and a fricative.
* Alveolar affricates, {{IPAblink|ts}} and {{IPAblink|dz}}, occur the least of all affricates.&lt;ref name="recasens144"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|Espinosa|2007|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** {{IPA|[dz]}} only occurs intervocalically: {{lang|ca|me'''tz'''ines}} {{IPA|[məˈdzinəs]}} ('toxic substances').&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hualde|1992|p=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Instances of {{IPA|[ts]}} arise mostly from compounding; the few lexical instances arise from historical compounding.&lt;ref name="wheeler11" /&gt; For instance, {{lang|ca|po'''ts'''er}} {{IPA|[puˈtse]}} ('maybe') comes from {{lang|ca|pot}} ('may') + {{lang|ca|ser}} ('be' [[infinitive|inf]]). As such, {{IPA|[ts]}} does not occur word-initially; other than some rare words of foreign origin (e.g. {{lang|ca|'''ts'''ar}} '[[tsar]]',&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlc.iec.cat/results.asp?txtEntrada=tsar Entry for 'tsar'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814193449/http://dlc.iec.cat/results.asp?txtEntrada=tsar |date=2011-08-14 }} in ''Diccionari de llengua catalana'', Second Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|ca|'''ts'''uga}} '[[tsuga]]'&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlc.iec.cat/results.asp?txtEntrada=tsuga&amp;operEntrada=0 Entry for 'tsuga'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814193526/http://dlc.iec.cat/results.asp?txtEntrada=tsuga&amp;operEntrada=0 |date=2011-08-14 }} in ''Diccionari de llengua catalana'', Second Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;), but it may occur word-finally and quite often in cases of heteromorphemic (i.e. across a morpheme boundary) plural endings: {{lang|ca|to'''ts'''}} {{IPA|[ˈtots]}} ('everybody').&lt;ref name="recasens144" /&gt;
* The distribution of [[alveolo-palatal consonant|alveolo-palatal]] affricates, {{IPAblink|tɕ|tʃ}} and {{IPAblink|dʑ|dʒ}}, depends on dialect:
** In Standard Eastern Catalan, word-initial {{IPA|[tʃ]}} is found only in a few words of foreign origin (e.g. {{lang|ca|'''tx'''ec}} '[[Czechs|Czech]]',&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlc.iec.cat/results.asp?txtEntrada=txec Entry for 'txec'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814193534/http://dlc.iec.cat/results.asp?txtEntrada=txec |date=2011-08-14 }} in ''Diccionari de llengua catalana'', Second Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|ca|'''Tx'''aikovski}} '[[Tchaikovsky]]') while being found freely intervocalically (e.g. {{lang|ca|fle'''tx'''a}} 'arrow') and word-finally: {{lang|ca|despa'''tx'''}} {{IPA|[dəsˈpatʃ]}} ('office').
** Standard Eastern Catalan also only allows {{IPA|[dʒ]}} in intervocalic position (e.g. {{lang|ca|me'''tg'''e}} 'medic', {{lang|ca|a'''dj'''unt}} 'enclosed'). Phonemic analyses show word-final occurrences of {{IPA|/dʒ/}} (e.g. {{lang|ca|ra'''ig''' esbiaixat}} {{IPA|[ˈradʒ əzβiəˈʃat]}} 'skew ray'), but final devoicing eliminates this from the surface: {{lang|ca|ra'''ig'''}} {{IPA|[ˈratʃ]}} ('ray').
** In various other dialects (as well as in emphatic speech),&lt;ref name="carbonell53"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Carbonell|Llisterri|1992|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|[tʃ]}} occurs word-initially and after another consonant to the exclusion of {{IPA|[ʃ]}}. These instances of word-initial {{IPA|[tʃ]}} seem to correspond to {{IPA|[ʃ]}} in other dialects, including the standard (on which the orthography is based): {{lang|ca|'''x'''in'''x'''a}} ('bedbug'), pronounced {{IPA|[ˈʃiɲʃə]}} in the standard, is {{IPA|[ˈtʃiɲtʃə]}} in these varieties.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;
** Similarly, in most of Valencian and southern Catalonia,&lt;ref name="recasens144" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|2005|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; most occurrences of {{IPA|[dʒ]}} correspond to the voiced fricative {{IPA|[ʒ]}} in Standard Eastern Catalan: {{lang|ca|'''g'''el}} {{IPA|[ˈdʒɛɫ]}} ('ice').

There is dialectal variation in regards to affricate length, with long affricates occurring in both Eastern and Western dialects such as in Majorca and few areas in Southern Valencia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|Espinosa|2007|pp=148–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, intervocalic affricates are predominantly long, especially those that are voiced or occurring immediately after a stressed syllable (e.g. {{lang|ca|me'''tg'''e}} {{IPA|[ˈmed.dʒə]}} 'medic').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|2005|pp=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern Valencian {{IPA|[dʒ]}} and {{IPA|[ddʒ]}} have merged into {{IPA|/dʒ/}}.

==== Fricatives ====
{{IPA|/v/}} occurs in Balearic,&lt;ref name="carbonell53" /&gt; as well as in [[Alguerese]], [[Valencian|standard Valencian]] and some areas in southern Catalonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Veny|2007|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everywhere else, it has [[betacism|merged]] with historic {{IPA|/β/}} so that {{IPA|[b]}} and {{IPA|[β]}} occur in complementary distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|2005|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Majorcan, {{IPA|[v]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} are in complementary distribution, with {{IPAblink|v}} occurring before vowels (e.g. {{lang|ca|bla'''v'''a}} {{IPA|[ˈbɫavə]}} 'blue' [[grammatical gender|f.]] vs. {{lang|ca|bla'''u'''}} {{IPA|[ˈbɫaw]}} 'blue' [[grammatical gender|m.]]). In other varieties that have both sounds, they are in contrast before vowels, with neutralization in favor of {{IPAblink|w}} before consonants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|2002|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some Valencian dialects, {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/ʃ/}} are auditorily similar such that neutralization may occur in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Rafel|1981}}, cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|Espinosa|2007|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is the case of Northern Valencian where {{IPA|/ʃ/}} is depalatalized{{clarification needed|date=September 2017}} to {{IPA|[js̠ʲ]}} or {{IPA|[js̠]}} as in {{lang|ca|ca'''ix'''a}} ('box'). Central Valencian words like {{lang|ca|m'''ig'''}} ('half') and {{lang|ca|lle'''ig'''}} ('ugly') have been transcribed with {{IPA|[ts]}} rather than the expected {{IPA|[tʃ]}}, and Southern Valencian {{IPA|/tʃ/}} "has been reported to undergo depalatalization without merging with {{IPA|[ts]}}".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|Espinosa|2007|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in {{lang|ca|passe'''ts'''}} ('small steps') versus {{lang|ca|passe'''ig'''}} ('promenade')

In [[La Franja|Aragon]] and Central Valencian (the so called {{lang|ca|apitxat}}), voiced fricatives and affricates are missing (i.e. {{IPA|/z/}} has merged with {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/dʒ/}} has merged with {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, with only voiceless realizations occurring) and {{IPA|/v/}} has merged with the {{IPA|[b ~ β]}} set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|2005|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sonorants ===
While "dark ([[velarization|velarized]]) l", {{IPAblink|ɫ}}, may be a positional allophone of {{IPA|/l/}} in most dialects (such as in the [[syllable coda]]; e.g. {{lang|ca|sò'''l'''}} {{IPA|[ˈsɔɫ]}} 'ground'),&lt;ref name="Catalan L"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|Espinosa|2005|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|/l/}} is [[dark l|dark]] irrespective of position in Eastern dialects like Majorcan&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|Espinosa|2005|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and standard Eastern Catalan (e.g. {{lang|ca|te'''l'''a}} {{IPA|[ˈtɛɫə]}}).

The distribution of the two rhotics {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/ɾ/}} closely parallels [[Spanish phonology#Alternations|that of Spanish]]. Between vowels, the two contrast (e.g. {{lang|ca|mi'''rr'''a}} {{IPA|[ˈmirə]}} 'myrrh' vs. {{lang|ca|mi'''r'''a}} {{IPA|[ˈmiɾə]}} 'look'), but they are otherwise in complementary distribution. {{IPAblink|ɾ}} appears in the onset, except in word-initial position ({{lang|ca|'''r'''uc}}), after {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, and {{IPA|/s/}}  ({{lang|ca|hon'''r'''a}}, {{lang|ca|Is'''r'''ael}}), and in [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]], where {{IPAblink|r}} is used. Different dialects vary in regards to rhotics in the coda, with Western Catalan generally featuring {{IPAblink|ɾ}} and Central Catalan dialects like those of Barcelona or Girona featuring a weakly trilled {{IPAblink|r}} unless it precedes a vowel-initial word in the same [[prosodic unit]], in which case {{IPAblink|ɾ}} appears ({{lang|ca|per}} {{IPA|[peɾ]}} in Western Catalan, {{IPA|[per]}} in Central Catalan).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Padgett|2003|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is free variation in "r" word-initially, after {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, and {{IPA|/s/}}, and in compounds (if {{IPA|/r/}} is preceded by consonant), wherein {{IPA|/r/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[r]}} or [{{IPAlink|ɹ}}], the latter being  similar to English '''''r'''ed'': {{IPA|[r ~ ɹ]}}{{lang|ca|uc}}, {{lang|ca|hon}}{{IPA|[r ~ ɹ]}}{{lang|ca|a}}, {{lang|ca|Is}}{{IPA|[r ~ ɹ]}}{{lang|ca|ael}}.

In careful speech, {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/m/}}, and {{IPA|/l/}} may be [[gemination|geminated]] (e.g. {{lang|ca|i'''nn'''ecessari}} {{IPA|[inːəsəˈsaɾi]}} 'unnecessary'; {{lang|ca|e'''mm'''agatzemar}} {{IPA|[əmːəɣədzəˈma]}} 'to store'; {{lang|ca|i'''l·l'''usió}} {{IPA|[iɫːuziˈo]}} 'illusion'). A geminated {{IPA|/ʎʎ/}} may also occur (e.g. {{lang|ca|ra'''tll'''a}} {{IPA|[ˈraʎːə]}} 'line').&lt;ref name="carbonell53" /&gt; {{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|1979}} analyzes intervocalic {{IPA|[r]}} as the result of gemination of a single rhotic phoneme: {{lang|ca|se'''rr'''a}} {{IPA|/ˈsɛɾɾə/ → [ˈsɛrə]}} 'saw, mountains' (this is similar to the common analysis of Spanish and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] rhotics).&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvcoltxt|Bonet|Mascaró|1997}} for more information&lt;/ref&gt;

Phonetic notes:
* The vowel {{IPA|/a/}} is further back and open than the Castilian counterpart in North-Western and Central Catalan, slightly fronted and closed in Valencian and Ribagorçan {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ä}} ~ {{IPA link|ɐ}}]}}, and further fronted and closed {{IPA|[{{IPA link|a}} ~ {{IPA link|æ}}]}} in Majorcan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|1996|pp=90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The mid-open vowels {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} are lower in Majorcan, Minorcan and Valencian, that is, in these dialects the phonetic realization of {{IPA|/ɛ/}} approaches {{IPAblink|æ}}, while {{IPA|/ɔ/}} is as low as {{IPAblink|ɒ}}.&lt;ref name="near-open vowels" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|1996|pp=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|1996|pp=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Alguerese]], [[Northern Catalan]] and some places bordering the [[Spanish language|Spanish-speaking areas]], mid-open and close-mid vowels may merge into mid vowels; {{IPAblink|e̞}} and {{IPAblink|o̞}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|1996|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The high vowels {{IPA|/i, u/}} are more open than in Castilian. Unstressed {{IPA|/i, u/}} are centralized.&lt;ref name="Recasens 1991 66"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|1991|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** In Valencian and most Balearic dialects {{IPA|/i, u/}} are further open and centralized&lt;ref name="Recasens 1991 66"/&gt;
* Northern Catalan sometimes adds two loan [[rounded vowel]]s, {{IPAblink|y}} and {{IPAblink|ø̞}}, from [[French language|French]] and [[Occitan language|Occitan]] (e.g. {{lang|ca|b'''u'''t}} {{IPA|[ˈbyt]}} 'aim', {{lang|ca|f'''u'''lles}} {{IPA|[ˈfø̞jəs]}} 'leaves').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|1996|pp=69, 80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Barcelona metropolitan area]] unstressed [[mid-central vowel|schwa]] is lowered to a near-open central vowel {{IPAblink|ɐ}}, sounding closer to {{lang|ca|b'''u'''t}} in [[Received Pronunciation|RP]] or [[Californian English]].&lt;ref name="near-open vowels" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Harrison|1997|pp=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Phonetic nasalization occurs for vowels occurring between nasal consonants or when preceding a syllable-final nasal; e.g. {{lang|ca|dium'''e'''nge}} {{IPA|[diwˈmẽɲʒə]}} ('Sunday').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|1996|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stressed vowels ===

[[File:Valencian vowel chart.svg|The vowel phonemes of Valencian|thumb|upright=1.13|Vowels of Valencian, from {{Harvcoltxt|Saborit Vilar|2009|p=23}}]]

Most varieties of Catalan contrast seven stressed vowel phonemes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|2005|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Balearic dialects have an additional stressed vowel phoneme ({{IPAslink|ə}}); e.g. {{lang|ca|s'''e'''c}} {{IPA|/ˈsək/}} ('dry').&lt;ref name="recasens2005" /&gt; The stressed [[mid-central vowel|schwa]] of these dialects corresponds to {{IPA|/ɛ/}} in Central Catalan and {{IPA|/e/}} in Western Catalan varieties (that is, [[Central Catalan|Central]] and [[Western Catalan]] dialects differ in their incidence of {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, with {{IPA|/e/}} appearing more frequently in Western Catalan; e.g. [[Central Catalan]] {{lang|ca|s'''e'''c}} {{IPA|/ˈsɛk/}} vs. [[Western Catalan]] {{lang|ca|s'''e'''c}} {{IPA|/ˈsek/}} 'dry, I sit').&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

=== Unstressed vowels ===
In [[Eastern Catalan]], vowels in unstressed position reduce to three : {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/ɛ/ → [ə]}}; {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/ɔ/}}, {{IPA|/u/ → [u]}}; {{IPA|/i/}} remains unchanged. However there are some dialectal differences: [[Alguerese]] merges {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, and {{IPA|/ɛ/}} with {{IPA|[a]}}; and in most areas of Majorca, {{IPA|[o]}} can appear in unstressed position (that is, {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} are usually reduced to {{IPA|[o]}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|2005|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western Catalan]], vowels in unstressed position reduce to five: {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/ɛ/ → [e]}}; {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/ɔ/ → [o]}}; {{IPA|/a/, /u/, /i/}} remain unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Carbonell|Llisterri|1992|pp=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some Western dialects reduced vowels tend to merge into different realizations in some cases:
* Unstressed {{IPA|/e/}} may merge with {{IPA|[a]}} before a [[Nasal consonant|nasal]] or [[sibilant consonant]] (e.g. {{lang|ca|'''e'''nclusa}} {{IPA|[aŋˈkluza]}} 'anvil', {{lang|ca|'''e'''ixam}} {{IPA|[ajˈʃam]}} 'swarm'), in some environments before any [[consonant]] (e.g. {{lang|ca|t'''e'''rròs}} {{IPA|[taˈrɔs]}} 'earthy'), and in monosyllabic [[clitic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|1996|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, unstressed {{IPA|/e/}} may merge into {{IPA|[i]}} when in contact with [[alveolo-palatal consonant|palatal consonants]] (e.g. {{lang|ca|s'''e'''nyor}} {{IPA|[siˈɲo(ɾ)]}} 'lord').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|1996|pp=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unstressed {{IPA|/o/}} may merge with {{IPA|[u]}} before a [[bilabial consonant]] (e.g. {{lang|ca|c'''o'''bert}} {{IPA|[kuˈβɛɾt]}} 'covered'), before a stressed syllable with a [[high vowel]] (e.g. {{lang|ca|c'''o'''nill}} {{IPA|[kuˈniʎ]}} 'rabbit'), in contact with [[alveolo-palatal consonants|palatal consonants]] (e.g. {{lang|ca|J'''o'''sep}} {{IPA|[(d)ʒuˈzɛp]}} 'Joseph'), and in monosyllabic clitics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|1996|pp=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In standard Eastern Catalan, rising diphthongs (that is, those starting with {{IPA|[j]}} or {{IPA|[w]}}) are only possible in the following contexts:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.iec.cat/institucio/seccions/Filologica/gramatica/fonetica/05diftongstriftongshiats.pdf Institut d'Estudis Catalans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930153153/http://www2.iec.cat/institucio/seccions/Filologica/gramatica/fonetica/05diftongstriftongshiats.pdf |date=2010-09-30 }} ''Els diftongs, els triftongs i els hiats – Gramàtica de la Llengua Catalana'' (provisional draft)&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|[j]}} in word-initial position, e.g. {{lang|ca|'''i'''ogurt}}.
* Both occur between vowels as in {{lang|ca|fe'''i'''a}} and {{lang|ca|ve'''i'''em}}.{{clarify|reason=Can {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} be adjacent, as in something like -auia- or -aiua-?|date=May 2015}}
* In the sequences {{IPA|[ɡw]}} or {{IPA|[kw]}} and vowel, e.g. {{lang|ca|g'''u'''ant}}, {{lang|ca|q'''u'''ota}}, {{lang|ca|q'''ü'''estió}}, {{lang|ca|ping'''ü'''í}} (these exceptional cases even lead some scholars&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{Harvcoltxt|Lleó|1970}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; to hypothesize the existence of rare labiovelar phonemes {{IPA|/ɡʷ/}} and {{IPA|/kʷ/}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|2005|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Processes ==
There are certain instances of ''compensatory diphthongization'' in Majorcan so that {{lang|ca|troncs}} {{IPA|/ˈtɾoncs/}} ('logs') (in addition to deleting the palatal stop) develops a compensating palatal glide and surfaces as {{IPA|[ˈtɾojns]}} (and contrasts with the unpluralized {{IPA|[ˈtɾoɲc]}}). Diphthongization compensates for the loss of the palatal stop (segment loss compensation). There are other cases where diphthongization compensates for the loss of point of articulation features (property loss compensation) as in {{IPA|[ˈaɲ]}} ('year') vs. {{IPA|[ˈajns]}} ('years').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Mascaró|2002|pp=580–581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dialectal distribution of compensatory diphthongization is almost entirely dependent on the dorsal stop ({{IPA|/k~c/}}) and the extent of consonant assimilation (whether or not it is extended to palatals).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Mascaró|2002|pp=581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voiced affricates are devoiced after stressed vowels in dialects like Eastern Catalan where there may be a correlation between devoicing and lengthening ([[gemination]]) of voiced affricates: {{lang|ca|me'''tg'''e}} {{IPA|/ˈmeddʒə/}} → {{IPA|[ˈmettʃə]}} ('medic').&lt;ref name="recasens145" /&gt; In Barcelona, voiced stops may be [[fortition|fortified]] (geminated and devoiced); e.g. {{lang|ca|poble}} {{IPA|[ˈpɔpːɫə]}} 'village').&lt;ref name="carbonell53" /&gt;

|}

Catalan denti-alveolar stops can fully [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilate]] to the following consonant, producing [[gemination]]; this is particularly evident before [[Nasal consonant|nasal]] and [[lateral consonant]]s: e.g. {{lang|ca|co'''tn'''a}} ('rind'), {{lang|ca|mo'''tll'''e}}/{{lang|ca|mo'''tl'''e}} ('spring'), and {{lang|ca|se'''tm'''ana}} ('week'). Learned words can alternate between featuring and not featuring such assimilation (e.g. {{lang|ca|atles}} {{IPA|[ˈadɫəs]~[ˈaɫːəs]}} 'atlas', {{lang|ca|administrar}} {{IPA|[ədminisˈtɾa]~[əmːinisˈtɾa]}} 'to administer').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Fabra|2008|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lacreu|2002|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central Valencian features simple elision in many of these cases (e.g {{lang|ca|co'''tn'''a}} {{IPA|[ˈkona]}}, {{lang|ca|se'''tm'''ana}} {{IPA|[seˈmana]}}) though learned words don't exhibit either assimilation or elision: {{lang|ca|atles}} {{IPA|[ˈadles]}} and {{lang|ca|administrar}} {{IPA|[adminisˈtɾaɾ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|2005|pp=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prosody ==

=== Stress ===
Stress most often occurs on any of the last three syllables of a word (e.g. {{lang|ca|&lt;u&gt;brú&lt;/u&gt;ixola}} {{IPA|[ˈbɾuʃuɫə]}} 'compass', {{lang|ca|&lt;u&gt;càs&lt;/u&gt;tig}} {{IPA|[ˈkastik]}} 'punishment', {{lang|ca|pa&lt;u&gt;llús&lt;/u&gt;}} {{IPA|[pəˈʎus]}} 'fool').

Compound words and adverbs formed with {{IPA|/ˈment/}} may have more than one stressed syllable (e.g. {{lang|ca|&lt;u&gt;bo&lt;/u&gt;na&lt;u&gt;ment&lt;/u&gt;}} {{IPA|[ˈbɔnəˈmen]}} 'willingly'; {{lang|ca|&lt;u&gt;pa&lt;/u&gt;ra&lt;u&gt;llamps&lt;/u&gt;}} {{IPA|[ˈpaɾəˈʎams]}} 'lightning conductor') but every lexical word has just one stressed syllable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Carbonell|Llisterri|1999|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phonotactics ===
Any consonant, as well as {{IPA|[j]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} may be an onset. Clusters may consist of a consonant plus a semivowel (C{{IPA|[j]}}, C{{IPA|[w]}}) or an obstruent plus a [[liquid consonant|liquid]]. Some speakers may have one of these obstruent-plus-liquid clusters preceding a semivowel, e.g. {{lang|ca|síndria}} {{IPA|[ˈsin.dɾjə]}} ('watermelon'); for other speakers, this is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈsin.dɾi.ə]}} (i.e. the semivowel must be syllabic in this context).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|2005|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Word-medial codas are restricted to one consonant + {{IPA|[s]}} ({{lang|ca|extra}} {{IPA|[ˈɛks.tɾə]}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|2005|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the coda position, voice contrasts among obstruents are neutralized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|2005|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are exceptions (such as {{lang|ca|futur}} {{IPA|[fuˈtur]}} 'future'), syllable-final [[rhotic consonant|rhotics]] are often lost before a word boundary or before the plural morpheme of most words: {{lang|ca|colo'''r'''}} {{IPA|[kuˈɫo]}} ('color') vs. {{lang|ca|colo'''r'''aina}} {{IPA|[kuɫuˈɾajnə]}} ('bright color').&lt;ref name="carbonell53" /&gt;

In Central Eastern Catalan, obstruents fail to surface word-finally when preceded by a [[homorganic]] consonant (e.g. {{IPA|/nt/ → [n]}}). Complex codas simplify only if the loss of the segment doesn't result in the loss of place specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Herrick|2002|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the suffix {{lang|ca|-erol}} {{IPA|[əˈɾɔɫ]}} is added to {{lang|ca|camp}} {{IPA|[ˈkam]}} it makes {{IPA|[kəmpəˈɾɔɫ]}}, indicating that the underlying representation is |{{IPA|ˈkamp}}| (with subsequent cluster simplification), however when the copula {{IPA|[ˈes]}} is added it makes {{IPA|[ˈkam ˈes]}}. The resulting generalization is that this underlying {{IPA|/p/}} will only surface in a morphologically complex word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Herrick|2002|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, word-final codas are not usually simplified in most of Balearic and Valencian (e.g. {{lang|ca|cam'''p'''}} {{IPA|[ˈkamp]}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|1996|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Word-initial clusters from Graeco-Latin learned words tend to drop the first phoneme: {{lang|ca|'''pn'''eumàtic}} {{IPA|[nəwˈmatik]}} ('pneumatic'), {{lang|ca|'''ps'''eudònim}} {{IPA|[səwˈðɔnim]}} ('pseudonym'), {{lang|ca|'''pt'''erodàctil}} {{IPA|[təɾuˈðaktiɫ]}} ('pterodactylus'), {{lang|ca|'''gn'''om}} {{IPA|[ˈnom]}} ('gnome').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|1996|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Word-final obstruents are devoiced, however they assimilate voicing of the following consonant; e.g. {{lang|ca|cu'''c''' de seda}}  {{IPA|[ˈkuɡ də ˈsɛðə]}} ('silkworm'). In regular and fast speech, stops often assimilate the place of articulation of the following consonant producing phonetic gemination: {{lang|ca|to'''t''' bé}} {{IPA|[ˈtod ˈbe] → [ˈtob ˈbe]}} ('all good').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Badia|1988|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Word-final fricatives (except {{IPA|/f/}}) are voiced before a following vowel; e.g. {{lang|ca|bu'''s''' enorme}} {{IPA|[ˈbuz əˈnormə]}} ('huge bus').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Recasens, Daniel| year=1991 | title= An Electropalatographic and Acoustic Study of Consonant-to-Vowel Coarticulation | journal=Journal of Phonetics| volume=19 | pages=267–280 | postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Majorcan and Minorcan Catalan, {{IPA|/f/}} undergoes total assimilation to a following consonant (just as stops do): {{lang|ca|bu'''f''' gros}} {{IPA|[ˈbuɡ ˈɡɾɔs]}} ('large puff').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|2005|pp=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dialectal variation ==
[[File:Catalan dialects-en.png|thumb|right|upright=1.36|Dialectal Map of Catalan from {{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|Yates|Dols|1999|p=xviii}}
&lt;br /&gt;'''Eastern dialects:'''
{{legend|#B67000|[[Northern Catalan]]}}
{{legend|#C24851|[[Central Catalan]]}}
{{legend|#A55DD3|[[Balearic dialect|Balearic]] and [[Alguerese]]}}
'''Western dialects:'''
{{legend|#6870FF|[[North-Western Catalan]]}}
{{legend|#3AC636|[[Valencian language|Valencian]]}}]]
The differences in the vocalic systems outlined above are the main criteria used to differentiate between the major dialects:
{{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|2005}} distinguishes two major dialect groups, [[Western Catalan|western]] and [[Eastern Catalan|eastern dialects]]; the latter of which only allow {{IPAblink|i}}, {{IPAblink|ə}}, and {{IPAblink|u}} to appear in unstressed syllables and include [[Northern Catalan]], [[Central Catalan]], [[Balearic dialect|Balearic]], and [[Alguerese]]. [[Western Catalan|Western dialects]], which allow any vowel in unstressed syllables, include [[Valencian]] and [[North-Western Catalan]].

Regarding consonants, [[betacism]] and fricative–affricate alternations are the most prominent differences between dialects.

Other dialectal features are:
* [[Vowel harmony]] with {{IPA|/ɔ/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ/}} in Valencian; this process is progressive (i.e. preceding vowels affect those pronounced afterwards) over the last unstressed vowel of a word; e.g. {{lang|ca|h'''o'''ra}} {{IPA|/ˈɔɾa/}} → {{IPA|[ˈɔɾɔ]}}.  However, there are cases where [[metaphony|regressive metaphony]] occurs over pretonic vowels; e.g. {{lang|ca|tovall'''o'''la}} {{IPA|/tovaˈʎɔla/}} → {{IPA|[tɔvɔˈʎɔlɔ]}} ('towel'), {{lang|ca|af'''e'''cta}} {{IPA|/aˈfɛkta/}} → {{IPA|[ɛˈfɛktɛ]}} ('affects').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|1996|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a number of dialects unstressed {{IPA|/i/}} can merge with {{IPA|/ə/}} (Eastern dialects) or {{IPA|/e, a/}} (Western dialects) according to the previous or following vowel (i.e. through assimilation when these vowels are high or dissimilation when they are mid or low). This merger is especially common in words with the prefix {{lang|ca|in}} or {{lang|ca|im}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|1991|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Southern Valencian subvarieties, especially in Alicante Valencian, the diphthong {{IPA|/ɔu/}} (phonetically {{IPA|[ɒw]}} in Valencian) has become {{IPA|[ɑw]}}: {{lang|ca|b'''ou'''s}} {{IPA|[ˈbɑws]}} ('bulls').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|1996|pp=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In regular speech in both Eastern and Western Catalan dialects, word-initial unstressed {{IPA|/o/}} –{{IPA|[u]}} or {{IPA|[o]}}– may be diphthongized to {{IPA|[əw]}} (Eastern Catalan) or {{IPA|[aw]}} (Western Catalan): {{lang|ca|'''o'''fegar}} {{IPA|[əwfəˈɣa]~[awfeˈɣa(ɾ)]}} ('to drown, suffocate').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|1996|pp=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[La Franja|Aragonese Catalan]] (including [[Ribagorçan]]), {{IPA|/l/}} is palatalized to {{IPAblink|ʎ}} in consonant clusters; e.g. {{lang|ca|p'''l'''ou}} {{IPA|[ˈpʎɔw]}} 'it rains'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|1996|pp=311–312}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Alguerese and Ribagorçan word-final {{IPA|/ʎ/}} and {{IPA|/ɲ/}} are depalatized to {{IPAblink|l}} and {{IPAblink|n}}, respectively; e.g. {{lang|ca|ga'''ll'''}} {{IPA|[ˈɡal]}} ('rooster'), {{lang|ca|a'''ny'''}} {{IPA|[ˈan]}} ('year').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|1994|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|1994|p=321}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Varying degrees of L-velarization among dialects: {{IPA|/l/}} is [[dark l|dark]] irrespective of position in Balearic and Central Catalan and might tend to [[L-vocalization|vocalization]] in some cases. In Western varieties like Valencian, this dark l contrasts with a [[Clear L|clear l]] in intervocalic and word-initial position; while in other dialects, like Alguerese or Northern Catalan, {{IPA|/l/}} is never velarized in any instance.&lt;ref name="Catalan L" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|1996|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{lang|ca|[[:ca:Iodització|Iodització]]}} (also known as {{lang|ca|iesme històric}} "historic {{lang|es|[[yeísmo]]}}") in regular speech in most of Majorcan, Northern Catalan and in the historic comarca of Vallès (Barcelona): {{IPA|/ʎ/}} merges with {{IPA|[j]}} in some Latin-derived words with intervocalic L-palatalization (intervocalic {{IPA|/l/}} + [[Palatal approximant|yod]] (-{{Sc|li}}-, -{{Sc|le}}-), -{{Sc|ll}}-, -{{Sc|cvl}}-, and -{{Sc|gvl}}-); e.g. {{lang|ca|pa'''ll'''a}} {{IPA|[ˈpajə]}} ('straw'). An exception to this rule is initial L-palatalization; e.g. {{lang|ca|'''ll'''una}} {{IPA|[ˈʎunə]}} ('moon').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|2005|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The dorso-palatal {{IPAblink|ʝ}} may occur in complementary distribution with {{IPAblink|ɟ}}, only in Majorcan varieties that have dorso-palatals rather than the velars found in most dialects: {{lang|ca|'''gu'''erra}} {{IPA|[ˈɟɛrə]}} ('war') vs. {{lang|ca|sa '''gu'''erra}} {{IPA|[sə ˈʝɛrə]}} ('the war').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|2005|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In northern and transitional Valencian, word-initial and postconsonantal {{IPA|/dʒ/}} (Eastern Catalan {{IPA|/ʒ/}} and {{IPA|/dʒ ~ ʒ/}}) alternates with {{IPA|[(j)ʒ]}} intervocalically; e.g. {{lang|ca|'''j'''oc}} {{IPA|[ˈdʒɔk]}} 'game', but {{lang|ca|pi'''tj'''or}} {{IPA|[piˈʒo]}} 'worse', {{lang|ca|bo'''j'''a}} {{IPA|[ˈbɔjʒa]}} 'crazy' (standard Valencian {{IPA|/ˈdʒɔk/}}, {{IPA|/piˈdʒoɾ/}}; {{IPA|/ˈbɔdʒa/}}; standard Catalan {{IPA|/ˈʒɔk/}}, {{IPA|/piˈdʒo/}} and {{IPA|/ˈbɔʒə/}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|2005|pp=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In northern Valencia and southern Catalonia {{IPA|/s/}} has merged with realizations of {{IPA|/ʃ/}} after a high front vocoid; e.g. {{lang|ca|terri'''ss'''a}} {{IPA|[teˈriʃa]}} ('pottery'), {{lang|ca|insi'''s'''ti'''s'''c}} {{IPA|[insiʃˈtiʃk]}} ('I insist') vs. {{lang|ca|pi'''x'''ar}} {{IPA|[piˈʃa(ɾ)]}} ('to pee'), {{lang|ca|de'''ix'''ar}} {{IPA|[dejˈʃa(ɾ)]}} ('to leave'). In these varieties {{IPA|/ʃ/}} is not found after other vocoids, and merges with {{IPA|/tʃ/}} after consonants; e.g. {{lang|ca|pun'''x'''a}} {{IPA|[ˈpuɲtʃa]}} ('thorn').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|2005|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Intervocalic {{IPA|/d/}} dropping (particularly [[participle]]s) in regular speech in Valencian, with [[compensatory lengthening]] of vowel {{IPA|/a/}}; e.g. {{lang|ca|vespra'''d'''a}} {{IPA|[vesˈpɾaː]}} ('evening').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Recasens|1996|pp=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In northern Catalonia and in the town of Sóller (Majorca), a uvular trill {{IPAblink|ʀ}} or approximant {{IPAblink|ʁ}} can be heard instead of an alveolar trill; e.g. {{lang|ca|có'''rr'''er}} {{IPA|[ˈkoʀə]~[ˈkoʁə]}} ('to run').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|2005|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical development ==
{{Main|Phonological history of Catalan}}
Catalan shares features with neighboring Romance languages ([[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|2005|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Marked contrast of the vowel pairs {{IPA|/ɛ/ ~ /e/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/ ~ /o/}}, as in other [[Western Romance]] languages, except Spanish and Sardinian.{{sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p = 630}}
* Lenition of voiced stops {{IPA|[b]→[β], [d]→[ð], [ɡ]→[ɣ]}} as in Galician and Spanish.{{sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p = 630}}
* Lack of [[diphthongization]] of [[Latin]] short {{lang|la|ĕ}}, {{lang|la|ŏ}}, as in [[Galician language|Galician]] and Portuguese, and unlike French, Spanish and Italian.{{sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p = 630}}
* Abundance of diphthongs containing {{IPA|/w/}}, as in Galician and Portuguese.{{sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p = 630}}
* Abundance of {{IPA|/ʎ/}} and {{IPA|/ɲ/}} occurring at the end of words, as for instance {{wikt-lang|ca|moll}} ("wet") and {{wikt-lang|ca|any}} ("year"), unlike Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{Google Books |id=T_DpUtZ66hoC |page=19 |plainurl=yes}} |last=Hall |first=Jacqueline |title=Convivència in Catalonia: Languages Living Together |location=Barcelona |publisher=[[Institut d'Estudis Catalans]] |date=2001 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portuguese or Italian.

In contrast with other Romance languages, Catalan has many [[monosyllabic]] words; and those ending in a wide variety of consonants and some [[consonant cluster]]s.{{sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=630}} Also, Catalan has [[final obstruent devoicing]], thus featuring many couplets like {{lang|ca|amic}} ('male friend') vs. {{lang|ca|amiga}} ('female friend').{{sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=630}}

'''Comprehension of idioms''' is the act of processing and understanding [[idioms]]. Idioms are a common type of [[figure of speech]]. Based on common [[linguistic]] definitions, an idiom is a combination of words that contains a [[meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] that cannot be understood based on the [[literal language|literal]] [[definition]] of the individual words.&lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;Liu, D. (2008). Idioms: Description, comprehension, acquisition, and pedagogy. New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of an idiom is ''hit the sack'', which means ''to go to bed''. It can be used in a sentence like the following: ''I'm so exhausted that I'm going to hit the sack now''.

Traditionally, idiom comprehension was thought to require a distinct processing mode other than [[literal language]] comprehension.  Subsequent research suggested that the comprehension of idioms could be explained in the context of general models of comprehension.  Contemporary researchers have also posited that different modes of processing are required for distinct types of idioms. Factors, such as idiom familiarity, [[Transparency (linguistic)|transparency]], and [[Context (language use)|context]] are found to influence idiom comprehension. 

Recent [[neurolinguistic]] research has found, using various techniques, several [[neural substrates]] that are associated with idiom comprehension, such as the left [[temporal lobe]] and [[prefrontal cortex]].

== History ==

[[Psycholinguistic]] research in idiom comprehension began in the 1970s.  Early research on [[figurative language]] typically assumed that comprehending figurative and literal language involved different kinds of processes. The non-compositional models of idiom comprehension were constructed based on this assumption. 

[[File:Noncompositional models for idiom comprehension.png|thumb|Noncompositional Models.]]

=== Non-compositional Models ===

Non-compositional models in general assume that idioms are stored like long words in memory.&lt;ref name="Caillies"&gt;Caillies, S., &amp; Butcher, K. (2007). Processing of idiomatic expressions: Evidence for a new hybrid view. ''Metaphor and Symbol'', 22, 79-108.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the entire phrase ''kick the bucket'' is represented by the meaning ''to die''. The words kick and bucket separately do not contribute to the idiomatic meaning. Since individual words do not matter in an idiomatic [[expression (language)|expression]], they are thought to be processed together as one entity during comprehension.  In contrast, processing a literal expression requires the meaning of each word to be derived and then perceived in relation to the other words in the phrase. Non-compositional models include the ''literal first hypothesis'', ''lexical representation hypothesis'', and the ''direct access hypothesis''. 

'''The Literal First Hypothesis''' 

*The literal first hypothesis suggests that an idiom is first processed literally upon encounter.&lt;ref&gt;Swinney, D. A., &amp; Culter, A. (1979). The access and processing of idiomatic expression. ''Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behaviour, 18'', 523-534&lt;/ref&gt; Idioms are often [[ambiguity|ambiguous]] since they may be processed in two ways: ''literally'' and ''idiomatically''. For example, ''kick the bucket'' can be interpreted as to ''strike the pail with one’s foot''. The literal first hypothesis proposes that, only after an appropriate literal meaning is not found, a mental idiom list is assessed to retrieve the idiomatic meaning. This hypothesis posits that there are separate storage for normal words and idioms, and that literal processing and figurative processing require different modes. Researchers claimed that this hypothesis was supported when people reported that they made an idiomatic interpretation first after they have read a set of idiom-containing sentences, but a literal interpretation first if they have seen a set of literal but ambiguous sentences. 

'''The Lexical Representation Hypothesis'''

*Contrary to the previous model, the lexical representation hypothesis posits that idioms are stored along with normal words in memory.&lt;ref&gt;Bobrow, S. A., &amp; Bell, S. M. (1973). On catching on to idiomatic expressions. ''Memory &amp; Cognitio, 1'', 343-346&lt;/ref&gt; Idioms are processed both literally and figuratively simultaneously. However, the figurative meaning (lexical representation) of the idiom is accessed first since the word string is stored and processed as one entry. Literal processing consumes more time since it requires the understanding of each word individually. Research conducted to support this hypothesis found that people recognized [[grammatical]] idioms as meaningful expressions more quickly than non-idiomatic but grammatical phrases when they were presented out of context.

'''The Direct Access Hypothesis'''

*The direct access hypothesis proposes that literal processing does not necessary occur when an idiom is encountered. It is possible that people completely bypass such mode when faced with a highly familiar idiom or have sufficient context to infer an idiomatic interpretation. In these cases, the idiomatic meaning is directly accessed.&lt;ref name="Gibbs"&gt;Gibbs, R. W. (1980). Spilling the beans on understanding and memory for idioms in context. ''Memory and Cognition, 8'', 149-156&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is based on the findings that demonstrated that people processed idiomatic sentences quicker than literal ones, and tended to interpret idiomatic expressions figuratively even when they are used in a literal sense.

=== Criticisms of Non-compositional Models ===

There are several criticisms for the non-compositional models. ''First'', studies demonstrated that idiom expressions are not processed more slowly than literal expression. In fact, it is often the opposite, which is in contrary to the prediction of literal first hypothesis.  ''Second'', idioms have been found to be more than just “frozen phrases” or long words. For example, some idioms can be transformed to some extent and  still be recognized and understood. For example, ''spill the beans'' can be used as “the beans were spilt by Mary”. This is possible because ''spill the bean'' can be mapped on the meaning “reveal the secret”, i.e. ''spill'' (reveal) and ''beans'' (secret). Such idiom shows that the internal structure of the word string matters during comprehension. The meaning of some idioms, like ''play with fire'', can be also inferred from literal interpretation of their components (i.e. ''to do something dangerous''). These findings reveal that idioms are not a [[homogeneous]], distinct group and thus may not involve different processing strategies from those for literal expressions.&lt;ref name="Titone"&gt;Titone, D. A., &amp; Connine, C. M. (1999). On the compositional and noncompositional nature of idiomatic expressions. ''Journal of Pragmatics, 31'', 1655-1674.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compositional Models ===

Compositional models assume that idiom comprehension uses normal language processing.&lt;ref name="Caillies"/&gt; When an idiomatic expression is encountered, it is processed incrementally like a normal [[expression (language)|expression]]. Components of an idiomatic word string contribute to a [[literal and figurative language|figurative]] meaning in either a literal or [[metaphor]]ical way. Compositional models include the ''configurational hypothesis'' and the ''conceptual metaphor hypothesis''. 

[[File:Compositional models of idiom comprehension.png|thumb|upright=0.70|left|Compositional models.]]

'''The Configurational Hypothesis'''

*The configurational hypothesis rose in response to the former hypotheses. It was based on a finding that demonstrated that people did not make an idiomatic interpretation once the first part of an idiom is encountered (against the prediction of the ''direct access hypothesis'') or at the end of the idiom (against the prediction of the ''lexical representation hypothesis''). Instead, the configurational hypothesis posits that a sufficient portion of an idiomatic word string must be processed literally before the idiom is identified.&lt;ref&gt;Cacciari, C., &amp; Tabossi, P. (1988). The comprehension of idioms. ''Journal of Memory and Language, 27'', 668-683&lt;/ref&gt; The point where most people recognize the string as an idiom is the ''idiom key''. Once the key is encountered, the words in the rest of the string will not be processed literally. The idiom key is the most important part of the idiom. If it is replaced by other words, the idiomatic meaning cannot be activated.

'''The Conceptual Metaphor Hypothesis'''

*The conceptual metaphor hypothesis proposes that [[metaphors]] are fundamental to human thought and they influence the comprehension of many aspects of language, including idioms.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, R. W., Bogdanovich, J. M., Sykes, J. R., &amp; Barr, D. J. (1997). Metaphor in idiom comprehension. ''Journal of Memory and Language, 37'', 141–154&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a [[conceptual metaphor]] is “love is a journey”. This metaphor is embedded in the idiom-containing sentences like ''their marriage is on the rocks'' and ''our relationship is at a cross-road''. This hypothesis suggests that conceptual metaphors facilitate the understanding of idiomatic expressions. Individual words in the idiom can metaphorically contribute to its figurative meaning. In fact, research demonstrated that conceptual metaphors are activated during idiom comprehension. The words associated with the metaphor (e.g., journey) were more quickly identified as meaningful after the presentation of the idiom. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

=== Criticisms of Compositional Models ===

The prediction of the configurational hypothesis was not supported by research findings. Researchers found that even after a word string is recognized as an idiom, its literal meaning is still activated. Another criticism of the compositional models concerns the role of familiarity in idiom comprehension. As discovered by research on non-compositional models, idiomatic expressions are processed faster than non-idiomatic expressions. This is likely due to people’s familiarity of idioms. This suggests that when highly familiar idioms are encountered, people may not need to engage in literal processing or utilize conceptual metaphor to infer their meanings.&lt;ref name=Titone/&gt;

== Recent Models ==

[[File:Dual idiom representation model.png|thumb|upright=0.50|right|The dual idiom representation model.]]
Research in idiom comprehension continues today. Non-compositional and compositional models both inform contemporary researchers. One of the recent models includes the dual idiom representation model.

'''The Dual Idiom Representation Model'''

*The dual idiom representation model suggests that idiomatic expressions are simultaneously “long words” and compositional phrases.&lt;ref name= Titone/&gt; Thus, idiom comprehension involves both direct memory [[recall (memory)|retrieval]] and normal language processing.  Idioms behave noncompositionally to the degree they are familiar. When highly familiar idioms encountered, their idiomatic meanings can be directly activated. In addition, idioms can behave compositionally if they are decomposable. Decomposability of an idiom refers to the extent to which the literal meaning of the individual words in the word string participate in the overall figurative meaning of the idiom. As suggested earlier, the idiom ''play with fire'' is decomposable while ''kick the bucket'' is nondecomposable. Comprehension is facilitated in a decomposable idiom since there are commonality between the results of its literal analysis and its idiomatic meaning. Research shows that familiarity had the larger effect on the speed of idiom comprehension than decomposability. Decomposability nonetheless facilitates processing the meaningfulness of the idiomatic expression.&lt;ref&gt;Libben, M. R., &amp; Titone, D. A. (2008). The multidetermined nature of idiom processing. ''Memory &amp; Cognition, 36'', 1103-1121.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors that affect Idiom Comprehension ==

Many factors have an effect on the comprehension of idioms. They can influence the processing speed and understandability of the idioms. Some of these factors include the familiarity, [[Transparency (linguistic)|transparency]], and [[Context (language use)|context]] of use of the idioms.&lt;ref name="Liu"/&gt;

=== Familiarity ===

Idiom familiarity is typically defined as how frequently an idiom is encountered in a language community. Subjective ratings of idiom familiarity are usually obtained from members of the language community. An example of a more familiar English idiom is ''pain in the neck'', while a less familiar idiom is ''paddle his own canoe''. Research demonstrated that familiar idioms are processed quicker and more accurately than unfamiliar ones.&lt;ref&gt;Schweigert, W. A. (1986). The comprehension of familiar and less familiar idioms. ''Journal of Psycholinguistic Research, 15'', 33-45.&lt;/ref&gt; As the dual idiom representation model suggests, highly familiar idioms may lead to direct memory retrieval. Processing unfamiliar idioms, on the other head, requires [[context (language use)|contextual information]] and [[commonsense]] knowledge.

=== Transparency ===

Idiom transparency can refer to the “literalness” of an idiom; how easy it is to understand an idiom based on the words it contains. Idioms can be sorted depending on their degree of [[Transparency (linguistic)|transparency]]. Three categories of idioms have been identified: ''decomposable'', ''abnormally decomposable'', and ''nondecomposable''.&lt;ref name="Gibbs" /&gt; Decomposable idioms are composed of words that literally contribute to their overall figurative meaning, e.g. ''pop the question''. ''Pop'' refers to ''sudden'' and ''the question'' refers to ''marriage proposal''. Abnormally decomposable idioms contain words that are associated with the overall figurative meaning of the idiom but in a metaphorical way, e.g. ''spill the beans''. ''Spill'' mapping on to ''reveal'' and ''beans'' metaphorically representing ''secret''. Nondecomposable idioms are made of words that do not reflect their idiomatic meaning, e.g. ''kick the bucket''. People are found to respond to both types of decomposable idioms faster than nondecomposable ones.

=== Context of use ===

Research in children highlighted the important effects of [[Context (language use)|context]] on idiom comprehension. It was found that children understand idiomatic expression more accurately when they are shown in informative contexts than when they are presented in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;Levorato, M. C., Roch, M., &amp; Nesi, B. (2007). A longitudinal study of idiom and text comprehension. ''Journal of Child Language'', 34, 473-494.&lt;/ref&gt; When they are encountered out of context, children tended to interpret idioms literally. The ability to use contextual information in language processing has also been found to influence children’s performance in idiom comprehension. Adults, however, are more affected by the familiarity of the idiom.

== Neurolinguistic Research ==

Researchers have used various means to explore the brain regions that are associated with idiom comprehension. The investigations involve examining [[brain damage]] patients, and conducting [[rTMS|transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)]] and [[fMRI|functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)]] studies. Brain damages in the patients were mostly caused by strokes or traumatic accidents. [[rTMS]] causes temporary cerebral lesion, and thereby impairs the target area’s functioning. [[fMRI]] measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow. The areas that have been studied include the [[right hemisphere]], [[left hemisphere]], and [[prefrontal cortex]].

=== Right Hemisphere ===

Since [[aphasic]] patients often preserve their ability to use familiar phrases (i.e. [[idioms]] and [[proverb]]s), researchers hypothesized that they may be stored and processed in different brain regions than novel phrases. It was found that patients who experienced right-brain damage (RBD) showed more impairment in idiom comprehension than patients with left-brain damage (LBD). RBD patients however performed better in comprehending novel sentence compared to patients with LBD.&lt;ref&gt;Van Lancker, D. R., &amp; Kempler, D. (1987). Comprehension of familiar phrases by left-but not by right-hemisphere damaged patients. ''Brain and Language, 32'', 265-277.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the [[right hemisphere]] is involved in the comprehension of idioms. However, later research has suggested that RBD patients’ difficulties in idiom comprehension, as demonstrated by sentence-to-picture matching task, may be due to deficits in their [[visuospatial]] abilities, rather than impairment in [[linguistic]] processing. The right hemisphere shows dominance in visuospatial processing.&lt;ref&gt;Papagno, C., Curti, R., Rizzo, S., Crippa, F., &amp; Colombo, M. R. (2006). Is the right hemisphere involved in idiom comprehension? A neuropsychological study. ''Neuropsychology, 20'', 598-606.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gray's Anatomy plate 517 brain.png|thumb|left|Gray's Neuroanatomy.]]

=== Left Hemisphere ===

Other researchers have hypothesized that comprehension of nondecomposable idioms mainly involved [[Lateralization of brain function|left hemispheric]] activity. When healthy adults were studied, left [[temporal lobe|temporal]] [[rTMS]] was found to influence the reaction time and accuracy of both idiom comprehension and literal sentence processing. In particular, it increased processing time and reduced accuracy in understanding.  When rTMS was applied to the left [[frontal lobe|frontal]], right [[frontal lobe|frontal]] and right [[temporal lobe|temporal]], there were no effects on idiom comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;Papagno, C., Oliveri, M., Romero, L. (2002). Neural correlates of idiom comprehension. ''Cortex, 38'', 895-898.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research with healthy adults using fMRI also found that, when processing idioms that were not literally interpretable (i.e.,  ''raining cats and dogs''), the [[Broca’s area]] in the left prefronto-temporal network was activated. However, when literally interpretable idioms (i.e., ''break the ice'') were processed, the left [[medial frontal gyrus]] (MFQ) and [[superior frontal gyrus]] (SFG) were activated.&lt;ref&gt;Hillert, D. G., &amp; Buracas, G. T. (2009). The neural substrates of spoken idiom comprehension. ''Language and Cognitive Processes, 24'', 1370-1391.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prefrontal Cortex ===

[[Prefrontal cortex]] (PFC) is suggested to be important for idiom comprehension. It may play a role in selecting the appropriate interpretation and suppressing the incorrect ones when an idiomatic expression is encountered. Research using [[fMRI]] indicated that the left [[temporal cortex]], left superior medial frontal gyrus, and left [[inferior frontal gyrus]] were activated when idiomatic phrases were presented.&lt;ref&gt;Lauro, L. J. R., Tettamanti, M., Cappa, S. F., &amp; Papagno, C. (2008). Idiom comprehension: A prefrontal task? ''Cerebral Cortex, 18'', 162-170.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the right [[superior temporal gyrus|superior]] and [[middle temporal gyrus|middle temporal gyri]], the right [[Poles of cerebral hemispheres|temporal pole]], and the right [[inferior frontal gyrus]] were activated as well. In contrast, the left [[Inferior parietal lobule|inferior parietal lobe]] and the right [[supramarginal gyrus]] were activated when literal sentences were presented.

== Future Research ==

Future research in this field should continue to investigate which brain regions are associated with idiom processing, in order to resolve the ongoing debate on [[lateralization of brain function|hemispheric specialization]] in [[figurative language]] comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;Kasparian, K. (2013) Hemispheric differences in figurative language processing: Contributions of neuroimaging methods and challenges in reconciling current empirical findings. ''Journal of Neurolinguistics, 26,'' 1-12.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent review suggested that the familiarity affect which brain region is activated during the comprehension of figurative language. Less familiar expressions are suggested to be processed in the [[right hemisphere]], while more familiar ones are processed predominately in the [[left hemisphere]]. More brain imaging research needs to be conducted to test this hypothesis.  

Additionally, future research could use [[magnetoencephalography|magnetoencephalography (MEG)]] to explore the temporal dynamics of idiom comprehension. Recent research using MEG has found that, when idioms containing action verbs (i.e. ''kick the bucket'') were processed, [[motor cortex|motor regions]] of the brain were activated. The anterior fronto-temporal cortex, a region previously found to distinguish between literal and figurative processing, was activated at the same time as well. This suggests that literal and figurative meanings are processed in parallel to some extent, which gives support to the configurational hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Boulenger, V., Shtyrov, Y., &amp; Pulvermuller, F. (2012). When do you grasp the idea? MEG evidence for instantaneous idiom understanding. ''NeuroImage, 59,'' 3502-3513.&lt;/ref&gt; More work with MEG should be done to verify these findings.

[[File:Munich Subway Station Georg-Brauchle-Ring, April 2017.jpg|thumb|A subway platform shot using Dutch angle]]
The '''Dutch angle''', also known as '''Dutch tilt''', '''canted angle''', or '''oblique angle''', is a type of camera shot where the camera is set at an angle on its roll axis so that the shot is composed with vertical lines at an angle to the side of the frame, or so that the horizon line of the shot is not parallel with the bottom of the camera frame.  This produces a viewpoint akin to tilting one's head to the side.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dutch angle - Hollywood Lexicon|url=http://www.hollywoodlexicon.com/dutchangle.html|website=Hollywood Lexicon|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cinematography]], the Dutch angle is one of many [[cinematic techniques]] often used to portray psychological uneasiness or tension in the subject being filmed.

Dutch refers to a bastardisation of the word ''Deutsch'', the [[German language|German]] word for "German". It is not related to the [[Dutch people]] or [[Dutch language|language]]. It originated in the [[World War I|First World War]], as Navy blockades made the import (and export) of movies impossible. The German movie scene was part of the [[Expressionism|expressionist movement]], which used the Dutch angle extensively.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mamer&gt;{{cite book |last=Mamer |first=Bruce |chapter=Oblique Shot (Dutch Angle) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=HwfxlkeYgMQC&amp;pg=PA9 |pages=9–10 |title=Film Production Technique: Creating the Accomplished Image |year=2008 |publisher=Cengage Learning |location=Belmont |isbn=978-0-495-41116-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
[[File:Eubank-Love-2011-Figur-Genesis-Dutch.jpg|thumb|A special axis head allows for cinematographers to set up Dutch angles.]]
A Dutch angle is a camera shot in which the camera has been rotated relative to the horizon or vertical lines in the shot. The primary use of such angles is to cause a sense of unease or disorientation for the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Rl7IyLPt5ucC&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=dutch%20tilt&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q=dutch%20tilt&amp;f=false |title= Grammar of the Shot |page= 82 |author= Christopher J. Bowen, Roy Thompson |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis |year= 2013 |isbn= 0240526015 |accessdate= 26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Dutch angles are static shots, but in a moving Dutch angle shot the camera can pivot, pan or track along the established diagonal axis for the shot.&lt;ref name=Mamer/&gt; 

==Notable uses==
[[Dziga Vertov]]'s 1929 [[experimental film|experimental]] [[documentary]] ''[[Man with a Movie Camera]]'' contains uses of the Dutch angle, among other innovative techniques discovered by Vertov himself.

The angle was widely used to depict madness, unrest, exoticism, and disorientation in [[German Expressionism]], hence its name ''[[wikt:Deutsch|Deutsch]]'', meaning [[German language|German]], was often conflated with the etymologically similar word [[wikt:Dutch|Dutch]] which gives the corruption of the term now commonly used. Montages of Dutch angles are often structured such that the tilts are horizontally opposed in each shot – for example, a right-tilted shot will be followed with a left-tilted shot, and so on&lt;ref name="screenprism"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://screenprism.com/insights/article/what-is-a-dutch-tilt-and-how-is-it-used|title=The Filmmaker's Handbook: What is a Dutch Tilt|last=ScreenPrism|website=screenprism.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The 1949 film ''[[The Third Man]]'' makes extensive use of Dutch angle shots, to emphasize the main character's alienation in a foreign environment. Director [[Carol Reed]] has said that [[William Wyler]] gifted him with a [[spirit level]] after seeing the film, to sardonically encourage him to use more traditional shooting angles.&lt;ref name=Mamer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Thomas Samuels, ''Encountering Directors'', 1972 - interview with Carol Reed, excerpt at [http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=172 wellesnet.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch angles were used extensively in the 1960s [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' TV series]] and [[Batman (1966 film)|1966 film]], satires in which each villain had his or her own angle, as they were "crooked".&lt;ref name=Mamer/&gt;&lt;ref name="screenprism"/&gt;

Dutch angles are frequently used by film directors who have a background in the visual arts, such as [[Tim Burton]] (in ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' and ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]''), and [[Terry Gilliam]] (in ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', ''[[The Fisher King]]'', ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]'', ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' and ''[[Tideland (film)|Tideland]]'') to represent madness, disorientation, or drug psychosis. In his [[The Evil Dead (franchise)|''Evil Dead'' trilogy]], [[Sam Raimi]] used Dutch angles to show that a character had become possessed.

The Dutch angle is an overt cinematographical technique that can be overused. The science-fiction film ''[[Battlefield Earth (film)|Battlefield Earth]]'' (2000), in particular, drew sharp criticism for its pervasive use of the Dutch angle. In the words of film critic [[Roger Ebert]], "the director, [[Roger Christian (filmmaker)|Roger Christian]], has learned from better films that directors sometimes tilt their cameras, but he has not learned why".&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Ebert|authorlink=Roger Ebert|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000512/REVIEWS/5120301/1023|title=Battlefield Earth|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=2000-05-12|accessdate=2006-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch angles are often used in horror video games{{fact|date=May 2018}}, particularly those with static camera angles such as early entries in the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' and ''[[Silent Hill]]'' franchises. Similar to their use in movies, these angles are used to bring about a feeling of unease in the player.

'''''Educating Eve: The 'Language Instinct' Debate''''' is a book by [[Geoffrey Sampson]], providing arguments against [[Noam Chomsky]]'s theory of a human instinct for ([[First language|first]]) [[language acquisition]]. Sampson explains the original title of the book as a deliberate [[allusion]] to ''[[Educating Rita]]'' (1980), and uses the plot of that [[Play (theatre)|play]] to illustrate his argument. Sampson's book is a response to [[Steven Pinker]]'s ''[[The Language Instinct]]'' specifically and Chomskyan [[linguistic nativism]] broadly.

The title, ''Educating Eve'', was dropped after the first edition because the allusion to ''Educating Rita'' "was deemed unduly mysterious".&lt;ref name=TLID2&gt;
[[Geoffrey Sampson]], ''The 'Language Instinct' Debate'', revised edition, (London: [[Continuum International Publishing Group]], 2005), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The revised edition (2005) contains an additional chapter and "many passages, from a few words up to new chapter-sections, that discuss relevant scientific findings which have emerged since the first edition, or respond to objections made by critics of that edition."&lt;ref name=TLIDxii&gt;
Sampson (2005): xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abstract ==

Sampson critically evaluates the ability of theories of linguistic [[Psychological nativism|nativism]] to accommodate the growing understanding of human brain processing over the course of the late 20th&amp;nbsp;century. He proposes an alternative explanation, borrowing some ideas and terminology from [[Karl Popper]].

== Overview ==

{{quote box|width=23em|"Eve was not a born know-all. She was ignorant. But she was a good learner."|}}

* "Eve was not a born know-all. She was ignorant. But she was a good learner."&lt;ref name=TLID25&gt;Sampson (2005): 25.&lt;/ref&gt; — Geoffrey Sampson, ''Educating Eve''

The book has seven chapters introduced by a [[#Foreword|foreword]] by [[Paul Postal]] who claims an agnostic position regarding the debate. He expresses serious concerns regarding the strength of the "[[Psychological nativism|nativist]]" argument; but despite being unconvinced of the alternative view, he commends Sampson for challenging nativism and attempting to make a case for an alternative.

The first chapter of ''Educating Eve'' considers broad contours of the [[nature versus nurture]] debate in regard to human knowledge generally, before narrowing this down to the rise of late 20th&amp;nbsp;century linguistic nativism in particular. It concludes with an overview of the [[methodology]] of the rest of the book. Chapter 2 reports evidence that was available to the "first wave" of nativists (like Chomsky) during the 1960s and 1970s. Chapter 3 reports the results of research that have become available since then. Chapter 4 turns to examining the distinctive arguments of "new wave" nativists (like Pinker). Chapter 5 presents a case for an alternative view.
In chapter 7 Sampson concludes with a short personal perspective on sociological changes in the nature of academic discourse over the 40 years of the debate regarding nativism. He attributes the popularity of nativism to various features of these sociological changes.

Cowley, and some others, view Sampson and Pinker as standing at extreme ends of a nature–nurture spectrum, as applied to explaining language acquisition. Cowley notes philosophical difficulties with each extreme, as they are argued by Sampson and Pinker: Sampson's version of the nurture position also argues for philosophical dualism; whereas Pinker's version of the nature position also argues for an ontological reality for syntax. Both these auxiliary arguments are unsatisfactory to many writers who address the relevant broader philosophical questions.

Cowley proposes an alternative: that language acquisition involves culturally determined language skills, apprehended by a biologically determined faculty that responds to them. In other words, he proposes that each extreme is right in what it affirms, but wrong in what it denies. ''Both'' cultural diversity of language, and a learning instinct, can be affirmed; ''neither'' need be denied.

'''Effective gross income''' is the relationship or ratio between the sale price of the [[value (economics)|value]] of a property and its effective gross rental income.

The anticipated income from all operations of the real property after an allowance is made for a vacancy and collection losses. Effective gross income includes items constituting other income: income generated from the operation of the real property that is not derived from space rental (such as parking rental or income from vending machines).

For example, if two properties have a potential income of $15,000 if they are all filled to maximum occupancy, and the average vacancy rate of the properties in cash is $1,250 (the sum of the rent that is not coming in by the vacancy in the properties). The average vacancy rate is then subtracted from the potential income from renting the properties so the total is $13,750, which becomes the effective gross income.

Some of the symbols are occasionally used for transcribing features of normal speech.

Many sounds found only in disordered speech are indicated with diacritics, though an increasing number of dedicated letters are used as well. Special letters are included to transcribe the speech of people with [[lisp]]s and [[cleft palate]]s. The extIPA repeats several standard-IPA diacritics that are unfamiliar to most people but transcribe features that are common in disordered speech. These include [[preaspiration]] {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ʰ◌}}}}, [[linguolabial]] {{angle bracket|{{IPA|◌̼}}}}, [[laminal consonant|laminal]] fricatives {{IPA|[s̻, z̻]}} and {{angle bracket|{{IPA|*}}}} for a sound (segment or feature) with no available symbol (letter or diacritic). The novel transcription {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɹ̈}}}} is used for an English [[molar-r]], as opposed to {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɹ̺}}}} for an apical r; these articulations are indistinguishable in sound and so are rarely identified in non-disordered speech.

Sounds not found in non-disordered speech include [[fricative nasal]]s (a.k.a. nareal fricatives) and [[percussive consonant]]s. Sounds sometimes found in the world's languages that do not have symbols in the IPA include [[denasal]]s and fricatives that are simultaneously lateral and sibilant.

|}

The symbol {{angbr|{{IPA|¡}}}} is used with the alveolar click for {{IPA|[ǃ¡]}}, an alveolar click with percussive release, a "cluck".

[[VoQS]] letters may also be used, as in {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ↀ͡r̪͆}}}} for a ''[[buccal speech|buccal]] interdental trill'' (a [[Blowing a raspberry|raspberry]]).

==Diacritics==
The extIPA has widened the use of some of the regular IPA symbols, such as {{IPA|ʰp}} for pre-aspiration, or {{IPA|tʶ}} for uvularization, as well as adding some new ones. Some of the extIPA diacritics are occasionally used for non-disordered speech, for example for the unusual airstream mechanisms of [[Damin]].

One modification is the use of subscript parentheses around the [[phonation]] diacritics to indicate partial phonation; a single parenthesis at the left or right of the voicing indicates that it is partially phonated at the beginning or end of the segment. These conventions may be convenient for representing various [[voice onset time]]s. Phonation diacritics may also be prefixed or suffixed rather than placed directly under the segment to represent relative timing.

The transcriptions for partial voicing and devoicing may be used in either the sense of degrees of voicing or in the sense that the voicing is discontinuous. For the former, both parentheses indicate the sound is mildly (partially) voiced throughout, and single parentheses mean a partial degree of voicing at the beginning or end of the sound. 
For the latter, both parentheses mean the sound is (de)voiced in the middle, while the single parentheses mean complete (de)voicing at the beginning or end of the sound.

Altering the position of a diacritic relative to the letter indicates that the phonation begins before the consonant or vowel does or continues beyond it. The voiceless ring and other phonation diacritics can be used in the same way if needed. For example, {{angle bracket|{{IPA|p˳a}}}} indicates that voicelessness continues past the {{IPA|[p]}}, equivalent to {{angle bracket|{{IPA|pʰa}}}}.

Other extIPA diacritics are:

Diacritics may be placed within parentheses as the voicing diacritics are above. For example, {{IPA|m͊}} with parentheses around the diacritic indicates a ''partially'' denasalized [m]. 

Following a longstanding tradition of the IPA not found on the IPA chart, any IPA or extIPA letter may be used as a superscript diacritic to indicate the onset or release of another letter. For example, {{angle bracket|{{IPA|k&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} for {{IPA|[k]}} with a lateral-fricative release (similar to the velar lateral affricate {{IPA|[k͜]}}, but with less frication), or {{angle bracket|{{IPA|d&lt;sup&gt;ʫ&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} for {{IPA|[d]}} with lateral plus central release. Combining diacritics can be added to superscript diacritics, such as {{angle bracket|{{IPA|tʰ̪͆}}}} for {{IPA|[t]}} with bidental&lt;!--"interdental" is a typo -- see chart--&gt; aspiration. 

The [[VoQS]] voice-quality symbols take IPA and extended-IPA diacritics, as well as several additional diacritics that are potentially available for the extIPA. At least the subscript dot for 'whisper' is sometimes found in IPA transcription,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Laver (1994) ''Principles of Phonetics'', CUP&lt;/ref&gt; though that diacritic is also commonly used for apical-retroflex articulation.

==Prosodic notation and indeterminate sounds==
The Extended IPA has adopted bracket notation from conventions transcribing discourse. Parentheses are used to indicate ''mouthing'' (silent articulation), as in {{IPA|(ʃːː)}}, a silent sign to hush. Parentheses are also used to indicate silent pauses, for example (...). Double parentheses indicate extraneous, obscured or unintelligible sound, as in ((2 syll.)), two audible but unidentifiable syllables.&lt;ref&gt;Double parentheses have dedicated characters in Unicode: ⸨2 syll.⸩.&lt;/ref&gt; An empty circle, ◯, is used for an indeterminate segment; capital Ⓒ is identified only as a consonant, capital Ⓕ as a fricative, IPA ⓟ as ''probably'' a {{IPA|[p]}}, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Capital letters used as wild-cards include Ⓒ consonant, Ⓕ fricative, Ⓖ glide/approximant, &lt;span style="{{Transform-rotate|180}}"&gt;Ⓚ&lt;/span&gt; click, Ⓛ liquid, Ⓝ nasal, Ⓟ plosive, Ⓡ rhotic, Ⓢ sibilant, Ⓣ tone/accent, Ⓥ vowel. These may be combined with IPA and extIPA diacritics. &lt;br&gt;Unicode encodes a combining circle diacritic that will work with any IPA letter, but as of 2015 it is not widely included in fonts: {{IPA|ɱ&amp;#x20DD;}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Curly brackets with Italian musical terms are used for phonation and prosodic notation, such as {{IPA|[{&lt;sub&gt;''falsetto''&lt;/sub&gt; ˈhɛlp &lt;sub&gt;''falsetto''&lt;/sub&gt;}]}} and terms for the [[tempo]] and [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] of connected speech. These are subscripted within a {curly brace} notation to indicate that they are comments on the intervening text.

Three rows appear in the extIPA chart that do not occur in the IPA chart: "fricative lateral + median" (simultaneous grooved and lateral frication), "[[fricative nasal]]" (a.k.a. nareal fricative) and "[[percussive consonant|percussive]]". A [[denasal]] row is added here. Several new columns appear as well, though the linguolabial column is the result of a standard-IPA diacritic.

'''''{{lang|cy|Hiraeth}}''''' ({{IPA-cy|hiraɪ̯θ|pron}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geiriadur.net/sain/hiraeth.mp3 How to pronounce ''hiraeth'']&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Welsh language|Welsh]] concept of longing for home, which can be loosely translated as 'nostalgia', or, more commonly, 'homesickness'. 
Many Welsh people claim 'hiraeth' is a word which cannot be translated, meaning more than solely "missing something" or "missing home." To some, it implies the meaning of missing a time, an era, or a person. It is associated with the bittersweet memory of missing something or someone, while being grateful of that/ their existence. Similarly, the Cornish equivalent is ‘hireth’;  Welsh and Cornish share common linguistic roots.
''{{Lang|cy|Hiraeth}}'' bears considerable similarities with the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] concept of ''{{lang|pt|[[saudade]]}}'' (a key theme in [[Fado]] music), [[Galician language|Galician]] ''{{lang|gl|morriña}}'', [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''{{lang|ro|dor}}'', [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] ''{{lang|gd|cianalas}}'', [[Russian language|Russian]] ''{{lang|ru-Latn|toska}}'' ({{lang|ru|тоска}}), [[German language|German]] ''{{lang|de|Sehnsucht}}'' and [[Ethiopia]]n ''{{lang|am-Latn|[[tizita]]}}'' ({{lang|am|ትዝታ}}).

'''Héctor-Neri Castañeda''' (December 13, 1924 – September 7, 1991&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/Papers/hncdict.tr.pdf Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers (Briston, UK: Thoemmes Press)]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Guatemala]]n [[philosopher]] and founder of the journal [[Noûs]].

Born in San Vicente, [[Zacapa]], [[Guatemala]], he emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1948 and studied under [[Wilfrid Sellars]] at the [[University of Minnesota]], where he earned a B.A. in 1950 and M.A. in 1952.  Castañeda received his Ph.D. in June 1954 for his dissertation "The Logical Structure of Moral Reasoning".  He studied at [[Oxford University]] from 1955–1956, after which he once again returned to the US to take a sabbatical-replacement position in philosophy at [[Duke University]].  Castañeda is noted for his development of [[Guise theory]], which he applied to outstanding problems in the analysis of thought, language, and the structure of the world.  He is also credited with the discovery of the "quasi-indicator" or "[[quasi-indexical]]", a linguistic device by which one person can attribute an [[indexical|indexical reference]] to another.  His discussion on this matter strongly influenced [[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]]'s theory of indexicals, an influence which Perry acknowledged in the first footnote of the paper "The Problem of the Essential Indexical".

He died of a [[brain tumor]] in 1991.

== Academic career ==

Following his brief stay at Duke University, Castañeda's first full-time academic appointment was as a professor in the Philosophy department at [[Wayne State University]], where he taught from 1957–1969.  It was there that he founded the philosophical journal ''Noûs'', in 1967.  From 1962–1963, he was also a visiting professor at the [[University of Texas at Austin]].  He was granted a fellowship from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] between 1967 and 1968.

He moved to [[Indiana University]] in 1969, and eventually became the [[Mahlon Powell]] Professor of Philosophy as well as that university's first [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of [[Latino]] Affairs, a position he held from 1978–1981.  He was a fellow at the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]] from 1981–1982.

==Awards and honors==

In addition to his other academic honors, Castañeda received grants from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], and the [[National Science Foundation]].  He served as President of the [[American Philosophical Association]] Central Division  from 1979–1980, and was named to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1990.  Castañeda was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Honor]] by the Government of [[Guatemala]] in 1991.

== Guise theory ==

Castañeda started from the fact that thoughts about real things in the world are of a fundamentally similar nature to thoughts about things in the imagination, it is still a thought, and from there he hypothesized an entire realm of [[abstract object]]s that included both the real and the imagined.  He referred to these objects collectively as ''guises'', and argued that they could be treated as sets of properties.  He went on to analyse all of language and [[perception]] in terms of these guises, ultimately developing an entire [[metaphysics]] based on them.

One noted critic of Guise theory was [[Alvin Plantinga|Plantinga]], who developed his own rival theory involving a realm of abstract objects.  Both theories were in fact based on even earlier work developed by [[Ernst Mally]] in 1912.  They differed, however, in the details of their metaphysical system and in how they regarded the basic building blocks of their respective systems.

Contemporary rhetoric focuses on cultural contexts and general structures of rhetoric structures. [[Kenneth Burke]] is one of the most notable contemporary U.S. rhetoricians who made major contributions to the rhetoric of identification. One of his most foundational ideas is as follows, “rhetoric makes human unity possible, that language use is symbolic action, and that rhetoric is symbolic inducement.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction|last=Herrick|first=James A.|publisher=Allyn Bacon|year=2012|isbn=978-0205078585|location=New York|pages=10, 225–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Branching from this, Herrick states that identification in rhetoric is crucial to persuasion, and thus to cooperation, consensus, compromise, and action. Burke believed that the most serious human problem was to be alienated or separated, and rhetoric was to be that problem’s only solution. Much of his work was based on bringing people back together. “Identification is affirmed with earnestness precisely because there is division. Identification is compensatory to division.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Rhetoric’s goal, in regards to identification, is to bring people together of whom have been separated by estrangement or opposition.

==History==
Kenneth Burke plays an important part in learning and understanding the core values of rhetorical theory in identification. He introduces the notion by taking the Aristotelian approach into a "world of particulars." Burke states that [[Aristotle]] treated rhetoric as purely verbal. But there are also areas of overlap. The flexibility of identification that Burke has created expands into elements beyond language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Keith|date=2006|title=Burke, Frazer, and Ritual: Attitudes toward Attitudes|url=http://kbjournal.org/gibson|journal=KB Journal|volume=3|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke wrote that “identification ranges from the politician who, addressing an audience of farmers, says, ‘I was a farm boy myself,’ through the mysteries of social status, to the mystic’s devout identification with the source of all being.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This symbolic interaction is possible because it recognizes the hidden sources of identification among human beings as symbol users. From this, Burke understands symbols as something that is around constantly, and that choosing to accept and learning to read them accurately is what needs to be understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rutton|first=Kris|last2=Soetaert|first2=Ronald|date=2014|title=A Rhetoric of Turns: Signs and Symbols in Education|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9752.12081/full|journal=Journal of Philosophy of Education|volume=48|pages=604–620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Burke’s theory of identification has been applied and expanded upon in [[Rhetoric|Krista Ratcliff&lt;nowiki/&gt;e]]’s Rhetorical Listening Framework. Ratcliffe proposes the “blurring of Burke’s and Fuss’s theories of identification, what becomes visible is multiple places for rhetorical listening.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rhetorical Listening: Identification, Gender, Whiteness|last=Ratcliffe|first=Krista|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|year=|isbn=0-8093-2669-8|location=|pages=69, 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When applying Burke and Fuss’s theories, Ratcliffe proposes non-identification in cross-cultural communication and feminist [[pedagogy]]. Her critique of Western logic is that it is difficult to simultaneously pay attention to both commonalities and differences, but that is where non-identification exists and thus provides a place for rhetorical listening.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Burke’s theory is critiqued by Ratcliffe for only focusing on identification; she argues that rhetorical listeners need to be accountable and take into consideration different points of view, which can be done through simultaneous listening to commonalities and differences.

Ratcliffe draws upon Diane Fuss because Fuss expands Burke’s theory of identification to gear toward examining the differences in identificaion. Fuss defines Identification as related to the issue of connection between opposite entities, such as the interrelation between self and other, subject and object, and insiders and outsiders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For Fuss, identification is difficult to pinpoint, as the distinction between opposite entities is porous, oftentimes “impossibly confused and finally untenable.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fuss further builds the connection between identification and disidentification.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fuss defines disidentification as contingent on previous identification with another group, no matter how stereotypical the identification is, while at the same time the identification has receded from the subconscious.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ratcliffe argues that previously identification has been configured as a metaphor, which is manifested in Burke’s [[Identification in Burkean rhetoric|consubstantiality]] and Fuss’s (dis)identification. Ratcliffe notes that metaphor has been used to function as the dominant trope for identification; however, metaphor foregrounds commonalities more than differences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ratcliff suggests theorizing identification via the use of metonymy to counter the privilege of communality. Intrinsic to the trope of [[metonymy]] is an attention to both commonalities and differences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Practical applications of Burke’s “identification” can be seen in the scholarly effort to reframe identifications. Assembling essays from the fifth Biennial Rhetoric Society of America Conference, Michelle Ballif addresses Ratcliffe’s call for rethinking Burke’s notion of identification “as a place of perpetual reframing that affects who, how, and what can be thought, spoken, written, and imagined.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Re/Framing Identification|last=Ballif|first=Michelle|publisher=Waveland|year=2014|isbn=9781478606710|location=Long Grove|pages=1, 200, 309}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some of the essay contributors draw upon Burke’s theory to reinterpret social identifications, others turn to specific social actions to reread Burke’s “identification.” For instance, following Ratcliffe’s critique of Burke’s theory for its lack of attention to difference, Dominic J. Ashby destabilizes Burke’s relatively fixed and teleological construction of identification with “a fluid and contingent notion of self”—that is, “uchi/soto,"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; or inside/outside in Japanese rhetoric—highlighting a simultaneous exclusion and inclusion of outsiders through an ongoing unfolding of group dynamics. By way of analyzing the Facebook news feed of “We are all Khaled Said,” Katherine Bridgman expands Burkean identification to “embodiment,”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; or the mutually coordinated experience between speakers and their audiences triggered by specific circumstances. Along a similar vein, critiquing Burke’s [[Identification in Burkean rhetoric|consubstantiality]] for being sexually indifferent, Janice Odom draws from Irigaray’s feminist theories to reframe identification as a playground of sexual dominance and surrender.

In [[telephony]], '''interface functionality''' is the characteristic of interfaces that allows operators to support [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]], [[Telephone exchange|switching]], and [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signaling]] functions identical to those used in the enhanced services provided by the [[common carrier|carrier]]. 

As part of its [[comparably efficient interconnection]] (CEI) offering, the carrier must make available standardized [[telephone network]]ing hardware and [[software]] interfaces that are able to support transmission, switching, and signaling functions identical to those used in the enhanced services provided by the carrier.

There are many monolinguals, especially children.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt; Apart from being close to or a dialect of [[Nukak language|Nukak]], its classification is uncertain.

==Overview==
The language is spoken by indigenous American Cacua people that live in Colombian and Brazilian&lt;ref name="record"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalrecordings.net/langcode/CBV  |title=Cacua entry |publisher=Global Recordings}}&lt;/ref&gt; interfluvial tropical forests higher than {{convert|200|m|ft}} in elevation. The people have traditional livelihoods such as nomadic [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting-gathering]] and [[swidden agriculture]].&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt; There are some non-native speakers of Cacua that are predominantly [[Christian missionaries|missionary]] workers. Their presence has resulted in the translation of religious Christian texts, notably the Christian Bible.&lt;ref name="bogota"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kidsinministry.org/missionadventures/bogota.php |title=Bogota Explosion! |publisher=Kids Ministry International |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022131509/http://www.kidsinministry.org/missionadventures/bogota.php |archive-date=2007-10-22 |quote=Cacua language}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bilingualism and literacy===

Reports gathered by [[SIL International|SIL]] in 1982 stated that many speakers are monolingual, particularly children.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt; Another promising aspect is that even though literacy is low by international standards, it is higher in the aboriginal language, at around 10%, compared to 5% in Spanish, the opposite situation of most indigenous languages of the Americas.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt;  Cacua uses a Latin alphabet.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt;

===Range===

The speakers are located in Wacara (In Cacua: ''Wacará'') which is {{convert|30|km|mi}} from Mitu (In Cacua and Spanish: ''Mitú'') in the lower [[Vaupes Department|Vaupes Region]].&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt; (In Spanish: ''Departamento del Vaupés'').

===Grammar===

The language uses both subject-object-verb and object-verb-subject word order.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt;

====Sample text in Cacua====

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Ded pah jwiít jwĩ jwíih cãac cha pahatji naáwát''&lt;ref name="samptext"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_work.asp?id=37522 Ded pah jwiít jwĩ jw... 1997] {{cbv icon}}, Ethnologue&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Classification===
There are two dialects: Vaupés Cacua and Macú-Paraná Cacua.  Cacua is mutually intelligible with [[Nukak language|Nukak]],&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt; and is considered a dialect of the latter by Martins (1999).  See that article for further classification.

Other names for this language include: ''Báda, Cakua, Kákwa, Macu de Cubeo, Macu de Desano, Macu de Guanano, Macú-Paraná, Wacara''.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt;

== Phonology ==
Kakwa has 6 vowels: /a, e, i, ɨ, o, u/.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~saphon/|title=SAPhon – South American Phonological Inventories|website=linguistics.berkeley.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kalanga'''{{Pronunciation needed}}, or ''TjiKalanga'' (in Zimbabwe), is a [[Bantu language]] spoken by the [[Kalanga people]] in [[Botswana]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. It has an extensive phoneme inventory, which includes [[Palatal consonant|palatalised]], [[Velar consonant|velarised]], [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] and [[Breathy voiced|breathy-voiced consonants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ikalanga phonetics and phonology: a synchronic and diachronic study.|last=Mathangwane|first=Joyce T.|publisher=Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications.|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalanga is recognised as an official language by the Zimbabwean Constitution of 2013 and is taught in schools in areas where its speakers predominate.

==Classification and varieties==
Linguists place Kalanga (S.16 in [[Guthrie classification of Bantu languages|Guthrie's classification]]) and [[Nambya language|Nambya]] (in the [[Hwange]] region of Zimbabwe) as the western branch of the [[Shona languages|Shona group]] (or Shonic, or Shona-Nyai) group of languages, collectively coded as S.10.&lt;ref name="Guthrie" /&gt; But the term Shona (or Standard Shona) is used in popular parlance only to refer to the Central Shona varieties (Korekore S.11, Zezuru S.12, [[Manyika dialect|Manyika]] S.13, Karanga S.14), so speakers of Kalanga prefer not to identify with the term [[Shona language|Shona]].

Kalanga has a dialectal variation between its [[Botswana]] and Zimbabwean varieties and they use slightly different orthographies. Historically, Wentzel mentioned Kalanga proper in the east and Lilima (Tjililima, Humbe) on the west, as well as varieties that are now rare or extinct: Nyai (Rozvi), Lemba (Remba), Lembethu (Rembethu), Twamamba (Xwamamba), Pfumbi, Jaunda (Jawunda, Jahunda), and †Romwe, †Peri, †Talahundra (Talaunda).&lt;ref name="Guthrie" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Relationship between Venda and Western Shona.|last=Wentzel|first=Petrus Johannes|publisher=Ph.D. Thesis. Univ. of South Africa|year=1981|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kottarathil Sankunni''' (real name: Vasudevan) was a well-known author of [[Malayalam]] literature, born on 23 March 1855 in [[Kottayam]], [[Travancore]]. He made significant contributions in both poetry and [[prose]]. He started compiling the legends of Kerala in 1909 and completed the work in eight volumes over a quarter of a century. "[[Aithihyamala]]" (''Garland of Legends''), is a collection of stories of legends prepared by Kottarathil Sankunni. The works on the legends were collected and published by Sankunni in the famous Malayalam literary magazine of the nineteenth century, the [[Bhashaposhini]]. Later, they were collected in eight parts and published by the Reddiar Press in Quilon, sometime in the early twentieth century. India's first writers' cooperative, the National Bookstall started publishing these articles as collections on behalf of the 'Kottarathil Sankunni Memorial Committee' in 1974 and later this was taken up by another publisher, [[D. C. Books]], in 1991. Such is their popularity that, from 1991 till 2004 almost 150,000 copies of these stories were distributed.

His contributions in both prose and poetry, including [[Kathakali]] literature and [[Ottan thullal|Thullal]], earned him a place in [[Malayalam literature]].

He died on 22 July 1937.

Famous works include:
* ''Aithihyamala'', a collection of legendary stories including those about ''[[Kadamattathu Kathanar]]'', ''[[Kayamkulam Kochunni]]'', ''[[Parayi petta panthirukulam]]'' etc.
* ''Sreerama pattabhishekam'' (Kathakali)
* ''Adhdhyathmaramayanam'' (Translation)

The '''languages of Spain''' ({{lang-es|lenguas de España}}), or '''Spanish languages''' ({{lang-es|lenguas españolas}}),&lt;ref&gt;The term ''lenguas españolas'' appears in the Spanish Constitution, referrering to all the languages spoken within Spain (those are Basque, Spanish, Catalan/Valencian, Galician, Asturian, Leonese, etc.).&lt;/ref&gt; are the languages spoken or once spoken in [[Spain]]. [[Romance languages]] are the most widely spoken in Spain; of which [[Spanish language|Spanish]], or [[Spanish_language#Names_of_the_language|Castilian]], is the only language which has [[official language|official status]] for the whole country.&lt;ref&gt;Promotora Española de Lingüística - [http://www.proel.org/index.php?pagina=mundo/indoeuro/italico/romance/iberorromance/espanol Lengua Española o Castellana] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127104051/http://proel.org/index.php?pagina=mundo%2Findoeuro%2Fitalico%2Fromance%2Fiberorromance%2Fespanol |date=27 November 2010 }}. (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; Various other languages have co-official or recognised status in specific territories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= M. Teresa Turell|title=Multilingualism In Spain: Sociolinguistic and Psycholinguistic Aspects of Linguistic Minority Groups|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=2001 |page=121|isbn=978-1-85359-491-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of unofficial languages and dialects are spoken in certain localities.

==Present-day languages==
In terms of the number of speakers and dominance, the most prominent of the languages of Spain is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (Castilian), spoken by about 99% of Spaniards as a first or second language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprints.ucm.es/8936/1/DT03-06.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20100927220118/http://eprints.ucm.es/8936/1/DT03-06.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Catalan (or Valencian) is spoken by 19%, Galician by 5%, and Basque by 2% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sp.html |title=CIA – The World Factbook – Spain |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=30 April 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gsZhjpvP?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sp.html |archivedate=19 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distribution of the regional co-official languages in Spain:
*[[Aranese language|Aranese]], co-official in [[Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ca icon}}{{oc icon}} [http://www.gencat.cat/eadop/imatges/5745/10273136.pdf Llei 35/2010, d'1 d'octubre, de l'occità, aranès a l'Aran]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is spoken mainly in the [[Pyrenees|Pyrenean]] [[comarques of Catalonia|comarca]] of the [[Aran Valley]] (''Val d'Aran''), in north-western [[Catalonia]]. It is a variety of [[Gascon dialect|Gascon]], which in turn is a variety of the [[Occitan language]].
*[[Basque language|Basque]], co-official in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and northern [[Navarre]] (see ''[[:es:Ley Foral del Vascuence#Zonificación|Basque-speaking zone]]''). Basque is the only non-[[Romance language]] (as well as non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]) with an official status in mainland Spain.
*[[Catalan language|Catalan]], co-official in Catalonia and in the [[Balearic Islands]] (sometimes referred to as Balearic). It is recognised—but not official—in [[Aragon]] in the area of ''[[La Franja]]''. 
*[[Galician language|Galician]], co-official in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. It is also spoken without official recognition in the adjacent western parts of the [[Asturias|Principality of Asturias]] and [[Castile and León]].

Spanish is official throughout the country; the rest of these languages have legal and co-official status in their respective communities, and (except Aranese) are widespread enough to have daily newspapers and significant book publishing and media presence in those communities. In the cases of Catalan and Galician, they are the main languages used by the Catalan and Galician regional governments and local administrations. A number of citizens in these areas consider their regional language as their primary language and Spanish as secondary.

{{legend|#fede99|'''[[Aragonese language|Aragonese]]''', recognised but not official }}
|}]]
In addition to these, there are a number of seriously endangered and recognised minority languages:
*[[Aragonese language|Aragonese]], recognised—but not official—in [[Aragon]].
*[[Asturian language|Asturian]], recognised—but not official—in [[Asturias]].
*[[Leonese language|Leonese]], recognised—but not official—in [[Castile and León]]. Spoken in the provinces of [[province of León|León]] and [[province of Zamora|Zamora]].

Spanish itself also has distinct dialects around the country; for example, the [[Andalusian Spanish|Andalusian]] or [[Canarian Spanish|Canarian]] dialects, each of these with their own subvarieties, some of them being partially closer to the Spanish of the [[Americas]], which they heavily influenced at different degrees, depending on the regions or periods, and according to different and non-homogeneous migrating or colonisation processes.

Five very localised dialects are of difficult filiation: [[Fala language|Fala]], a nearly extinct variety of its own mostly adscribed to the Galician-Portuguese group; [[Cantabrian dialect|Cantabrian]] and [[Extremaduran language|Extremaduran]], two Astur-Leonese dialects also regarded as Spanish dialects; [[Galician-Asturian|Eonavian]], a dialect between Asturian and Galician, closer to the latter according to several linguists; and [[Benasquese dialect|Benasquese]], a [[Ribagorçan dialect|Ribagorçan]] dialect that was formerly classified as Catalan, later as Aragonese, and which is now often regarded as a transitional language of its own. Asturian and Leonese are closely related to the local [[Mirandese language|Mirandese]] which is spoken on an adjacent territory but over the border into [[Portugal]]. Mirandese is recognised and has some local official status.

With the exception of Basque, which appears to be a [[language isolate]], all of the languages present in mainland Spain are [[Indo-European languages]], specifically [[Romance languages]].

[[Afro-Asiatic languages]], such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (including Ceuta [[Darija]]) or [[Berber language|Berber]] (mainly [[Riffian language|Riffian]]), are spoken by the Muslim population of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] and by recent immigrants (mainly from Morocco and Algeria) elsewhere.

===Portuguese and Galician===
In [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], the mutual relationship between [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] has caused some controversy, since some linguists, such as Lindley Cintra,&lt;ref&gt;Lindley Cintra, Luís F. {{cite web|url=http://www.instituto-camoes.pt/cvc/hlp/biblioteca/novaproposta.pdf |title=''Nova Proposta de Classificação dos Dialectos Galego-Portugueses'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102180041/http://www.instituto-camoes.pt/cvc/hlp/biblioteca/novaproposta.pdf |archivedate=2 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(469&amp;nbsp;KB)}} Boletim de Filologia, Lisboa, Centro de Estudos Filológicos, 1971 (in Portuguese).&lt;/ref&gt; consider that they are still dialects of a common language, in spite of the differences in phonology and vocabulary (see [[reintegrationism]]).

Others, such as Pilar Vázquez Cuesta,&lt;ref&gt;Vázquez Cuesta, Pilar [http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/hemeroteca/2002/02/22/973946.shtml «Non son reintegracionista»] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208141453/http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/hemeroteca/2002/02/22/973946.shtml |date=8 December 2011 }}, interview given to ''La Voz de Galicia'' on 22 February 2002 (in Galician).&lt;/ref&gt; argue that they have become separate languages due to major differences in phonetics and vocabulary usage, and, to a lesser extent, morphology and syntax.

In any case, the respective written standards are noticeably different one from another, partly because of the divergent phonological features and partly due to the usage of Spanish orthographic conventions over the Portuguese ones at the time of Galician [[Standard language|standardisation]] by the early 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The official (delegated onto both the [[:gl:Instituto da Lingua Galega|Galician Language Institute]] and the [[Royal Galician Academy]] standard) and widespread position is that Galician and Portuguese should be considered independent languages.

A [[Galician-Portuguese]]-based dialect known as [[Fala language|Fala]] is locally spoken in an area sometimes called ''Valley of Jálama/Xálima'', which includes the towns of [[San Martín de Trevejo]] (''Sa Martin de Trevellu''), [[Eljas]] (''As Elhas'') and [[Valverde del Fresno]] (''Valverdi du Fresnu''), in the northwestern corner of [[Cáceres (province)|Cáceres province]], [[Extremadura]].

Portuguese proper is still spoken by local people in three border areas:
* The town of [[La Alamedilla]], in [[Salamanca province]].
* The so-called Cedillo-horn, including [[Cedillo]] (in Portuguese ''Cedilho'') and [[Herrera de Alcántara]] (in Portuguese ''Ferreira de Alcântara'').
* The town of [[Olivenza]] (in Portuguese ''Olivença''), in [[Badajoz (province)|Badajoz province]], and its surrounding territory, which used to be Portuguese until the 19th century and is still claimed by Portugal.

==Ancient languages==
In addition to the languages which continue to be spoken in Spain to the present day, other languages which have been spoken within what are now the borders of Spain include:

The '''Lendu''', or ''Balendru,'' are an ethno-linguistic agriculturalist group residing in eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in the area west and northwest of [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]], specifically the [[Ituri Region]] of [[Orientale Province]]. Their language is one of the most populous of the [[Central Sudanic languages]].  There are three-quarters of a million Lendu speakers in the DRC. A conflict between the Lendu and [[Hema people]] was the basis of the [[Ituri conflict]].

''Ethnologue'' gives ''Bbadha'' as an alternate name of Lendu, but [[Roger Blench|Blench]] (2000) lists ''Badha'' as a distinct language. A draft listing of Nilo-Saharan languages, [http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Nilo-Saharan/General/NS%20language%20list.pdf available from his website] and dated 2012, lists ''Lendu/Badha''.

Besides the Balendru themselves, Lendu is spoken as a native language by a portion of the Hema, [[Alur people|Alur]], and [[Okebu]].

==Phonology==
Demolin (1995) posits that Lendu has [[voiceless implosive]]s, {{IPA|/ɓ̥ ɗ̥ ɠ̊/}} ({{IPA|/ƥ ƭ ƙ/}}). However, Goyvaerts (1988) had described these as [[creaky voice|creaky-voiced]] implosives {{IPA|/ɓ̰ ɗ̰ ɠ̰/}}, as in [[Hausa language|Hausa]], contrasting with a series of modally voiced implosives {{IPA|/ɓ ɗ ɠ/}} as in [[Kalabari language|Kalabari]], and Ladefoged judges that this seems to be a more accurate description.&lt;ref&gt;{{SOWL|87–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3755">'''Mean world syndrome''' is a term coined by [[George Gerbner]] to describe a [[phenomenon]] whereby [[violence]]-related content of [[mass media]] makes viewers believe that the world is more dangerous than it actually is. Mean world syndrome is one of the main conclusions of [[cultivation theory]]. Gerbner, a pioneer researcher on the [[Social aspects of television|effects of television on society]], argued that people who watch television tended to think of the [[world]] as an [[intimidating]] and unforgiving place. A [[direct correlation]] between the amount of television one watches and the amount of [[fear]] one harbors about the world has been proven, although the direction of causality remains debatable in that persons [[fearful]] of the world may be more likely to retreat from it and in turn spend more time with indoor, [[Solitude|solitary]] activities such as television watching.&lt;ref name="pej"&gt;[http://www.pejnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4053&amp;catid=74:ijustice-news&amp;Itemid=216 George Gerbner Leaves the Mean World Syndrome] Posted by: lex on http://PEJ.org Sunday, January 08, 2006, Peace, Earth &amp; Justice News&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of opinions, images, and attitudes that viewers tend to form when watching television will have a direct influence on how the viewer perceives the real world. They will reflect and refer to the most common images or recurrent messages thought to affect their own real lives.  Gerbner once said: "You know, who tells the stories of a culture really governs human behaviour. It used to be the parent, the school, the church, the community. Now it's a handful of global conglomerates that have nothing to tell, but a great deal to sell."&lt;ref name="pej"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49852245|title=Media effects: advances in theory and research|last=Gerbner|first=G.|last2=Gross|first2=L.|last3=Morgan|first3=M.|last4=Signorielli|first4=N.|last5=Shanahan|first5=J.|date=2002|publisher=Lawrence Elbaum Associates|year=|isbn=9781410602428|editor-last=Jennings|editor-first=Bryant|edition=2nd|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=43-67|chapter=Growing Up with Television: Cultivation Processes|oclc=49852245|editor-last2=Zillmann|editor-first2=Dolf|chapter-url=http://academic.csuohio.edu/kneuendorf/quillin/Gerbneretal%20growing%20up%20with%20television%202002.pdf|chapter-format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerbner says that the spread of the syndrome has become more intense over time. He describes how newer technologies such as [[VCR]], [[DVD]], and cable television do not disturb the cultivation theory, but actually allow more complete access and spread of recurrent messages, although widening access to the Internet world of information can counteract that. The 1930s [[behaviorism]] models, the [[Payne Fund Studies]], show that the effect that mass media has on our behavior is considerable. This is called the [[hypodermic needle model]]: people are injected with appropriate messages and ideas constructed by the mass media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/communication-theories/sorted-by-cluster/Mass%20Media/Hypodermic_Needle_Theory/|title=Mass Media {{!}} Hypodermic Needle Theory|last=|first=|date=September 6, 2004|website=Universiteit Twente|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[evolutionary anthropology]] and [[evolutionary linguistics]], the '''mimetic theory of speech origins'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Joas]], Daniel R. Huebner (eds.), ''The Timeliness of George Herbert Mead'', University of Chicago Press, 2016, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; is an analysis of the factors leading to the [[origin of language|evolution of language]] in human ancestors, typically during the ''Homo Erectus'' era. This theory is most commonly associated with the [[cognitive neuroscience|cognitive neuroscientist]] and [[neuroanthropology|neuroanthropologist]] [[Merlin Donald]], who developed the idea in his 1991 book ''Origins of the Modern Mind'' as the fundamental pillar in his three-part model of the development of [[symbolic culture]] and symbolic [[cognition]].

==Overview==
{{refimprove|section|date=December 2015}}
The mimetic theory of development was the central pillar in Donald's three-part model of symbolic cognition proposed in his 1991 book ''Origins of the Modern Mind''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Origins of the Modern Mind'' proposes a three-stage development of human symbolic capacity through culture:

'''Mimetic culture''': The watershed adaptation allowing humans to function as symbolic and cultural beings was a revolutionary improvement in motor control, the "mimetic skill" required to rehearse and refine the body's movements in a voluntary and systematic way, to remember those rehearsals, and to reproduce them on command. Following this development, Homo erectus assimilated and reconceptualized events to create various prelinguistic symbolic traditions such as rituals, dance, and craft.

'''Mythic cultures''' arose as a result of the acquisition of speech and the invention of symbols. Mimetic representation serves as a preadaptation to this development.

'''Technology-supported culture''': Finally, the cognitive ecology dominated by ephemeral face-to-face communication has changed for most of us as a result of the external memory-store that reading and writing permit. Computer technology intensifies these changes by offering even more extensive capacities for external storage and retrieval of information."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Donald argues for a periodic development of the human mind, a lineage in which the progression of the hominid brain, and the emergence of social culture, can be tracked through a primarily four-phase process of development in memory and social-cognitive systems that left humans with the cognitive infrastructure that we still retain today. Donald begins with the development of episodic memory in primates, and traces how the evolutionary lineage of the brain brought about next a mimetic culture, based on pantomiming and simplistic vocalizations to convey intentionality, and then a mythic culture, which used simplistic forms of story-sharing to form the basis of the first hominids trying to model their environment, its origins, and their place within it, and finally to a theoretic culture, which had the capability for higher orders of cognitive-processing, and whom eventually developed language.

Donald’s theory of the evolution of the human mind with mimesis at the core of things is very dependent on a lineage that is highly period-based, likely as a means to help explain some of the contradictory gaps in the archaeological record, where tool use, cultural artifacts, mastery of fire, and brain size (based on skulls that have been found) seem to either conflict, or have missing steps in their development. Donald sees this progression taking place in a very linear way, and his logic behind this makes sense. For example, the concept of mimetic minds makes intuitive sense- an episodic memory certainly had to be in place before an intentional communication system of any capacity could be implemented, but it also seems highly unlikely that hominids went straight from the ability to remember and mentally manipulate certain events to the ability to speak; after all, one would have little use for language- let alone an evolutionary reason to develop it-  without first developing a concrete sense of personal intentionality, along with the capacity to communicate this intentional stance to others, and with the reciprocal action of understanding their intentional stance as well.

==Criticisms and addendums to the theory==

It seems unlikely that the development of the mind occurred in such linear periods as Donald describes them; new evidence that has emerged since the publication of Donald’s book, primarily the discovery of mirror neurons, has laid the groundwork for a potentially more fluid, less periodic theory of the evolution of the mind.

[[Mirror neurons]] are a class of cells{{dubious|date=December 2015}} that have been found in the brains of several species of monkey, as well as in humans. Small clusters of mirror neurons tend to fire when an individual performs a given intentional action; this, however, is not the unique part. What is unique to mirror neurons is that a few of them in a cluster will also fire when an individual watches a different individual performing an intentional action. In other words, these neurons are influencing your ability for social learning. Because the same neurons are firing both when you perform an action and when you watch someone else rehearse that same action, the mind has obtained a method by which it can link itself to conspecific minds in order to share knowledge, culture, and judge the intentional stance of a potential friend or foe.

The existence of these neurons should likely trace their roots back closer to a common ancestor with modern primates, the only other species noted with mirror neurons, and some of the intentional and mimetic capabilities that Donald attributes to the evolution of the mimetic mind in Homo Erectus were likely around much earlier in some simplified form, perhaps as the foundation of the rigid social hierarchies that our primate cousins are known for.

Indeed, evidence exists that perhaps monkeys are even better at some aspects of the social cognition game than humans are. Colin Camerer, a behavioral economist at the California Institute of Technology, has conducted studies on monkeys using strategic games, where the outcomes can be quantitatively assessed against results from game theory, an applied branch of mathematics and economics which dictates rational choices and optimal outcomes, such as Nash Equilibriums, in games of strategy between two or more opponents. Amazingly, when pairs of chimps and pairs of humans were pitted against each other in a strategic pattern matching game, the outcomes for pairs of chimps clustered much more closely to the Nash Equilibrium and other mathematically-efficient outcomes than the outcomes for pairs of humans did.

Perhaps even more interesting is that when the researchers shifted the reward incentive more in favor of one party versus the other- and so also shifting where the efficient equilibrium points should fall- the chimps not only altered their behavior accordingly, they once again clustered more closely around the new mathematical equilibriums than human pairs did. Camerer posits that this is likely attributable to the importance of social hierarchy and role in chimpanzees, where the ability to strategize into a position of best outcome given the circumstance (or the chance to manipulate another chimpanzee’s strategic mistake to maximize one’s own gain) is an incredibly valuable skill.

This seems to be a probable explanation for the unlikely capability of monkeys to have such a finely attuned social sense that their behavior can be described by formal mathematical equilibriums; unfortunately, it does not bode well for Donald’s theory of a period of mimetic mind and culture development during the Erectus period of Homo lineage. Chimps in these experiments have shown signs of intentionality, communicativity, reference, modeling of social structure, reciprocal mimetic games, and conformity and coordination, all tenets of mimetic minds and mimetic cultures in Donald’s model, but all certainly having roots in ancestry from before Donald’s proposed mimetic period. Additionally, the chimpanzees must have at least a crude form of mental representations: the chimpanzees shifting to a new equilibrium when reward incentives were altered seems to undoubtedly indicate that they are aware of themselves and another chimp in a mutually-interactive environment, in which an abstract activity leads to a variable reward, a degree of strategy that requires at least some basic information to be held in the mind and manipulated.

Furthermore, many of these capabilities formed the basis of the progression into unique-to-human features of the mind developing in Donald’s model. For example, this mimetic behavior must be preceded first by an episodic memory capable of handling mental manipulations; the combination of this memory system with the acquisition and development of skills like intentionality and mimesis should then be sufficient with the proper pressures to allow for skills like tool-making, ritual dance, and pedagogy. And yet primates have evolved alongside us for millions of years without developing tools, dance, or any significant means of information transfer and teaching, despite certainly having an episodic memory, and presumably having some sort of social mirroring neurons that allowed them to develop such a complex social hierarchy, as well as display basic levels of intentionality, communicativity, and coordination.

Thus, the divergence of cognitive capacities between humans and lower hominids may not be due so much to mimetic culture as it is due to some mutation that increased that plasticity in our brains around the time of Homo Erectus, perhaps in part related to the mastery of fire during this period, which would have allowed for cooking and the ability to ingest enough quality nutrition to give our brains the resources to make its final push into its modern stage of development. This increase in plasticity would certainly be a mutation or upgrade supported by natural selection; a brain that can learn faster, more efficiently, and calibrate itself more properly to the needs of body and mind in the environment provides an absolutely massive leg-up on the competition. The mirror neuron system would be a logical system to derive primary benefit from an increase in plasticity under the conditions proposed. If this adaptation were indeed a result of the mastery of fire and the additional nutrition and food security brought about by cooking, changes in communal relations would be a logical co-requisite development, as fire promised warmth and security, and the invention of cooking would have provided an easier way of feeding larger groups.

&lt;!--Basic introduction; who he is--&gt;
'''Avram Noam Chomsky''' (born December 7, 1928) is an American [[linguist]], [[philosopher]], [[cognitive scientist]], [[historian]], [[Activism|political activist]], and [[Social criticism|social critic]]. Sometimes described as "the father of modern linguistics", Chomsky is also a major figure in [[analytic philosophy]] and one of the founders of the field of [[cognitive science]]. He holds a joint appointment as Institute Professor Emeritus at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and laureate professor at the [[University of Arizona]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/MITLinguistics/posts/1547120331974705|title=MIT Linguistics|via=Facebook|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/worldrenowned-linguist-noam-chomsky-joins-ua-faculty|title=World-Renowned Linguist Noam Chomsky Joins UA Faculty|work=UANews|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the author of over 100 books on topics such as [[linguistics]], war, politics, and [[mass media]]. Ideologically, he aligns with [[anarcho-syndicalism]] and [[libertarian socialism]].

&lt;!--Early life up until 1966--&gt;
Born to middle-class [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi Jewish]] immigrants in [[Philadelphia]], Chomsky developed an early interest in [[anarchism]] from alternative bookstores in New York City. He began studying at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] at age 16, taking courses in linguistics, mathematics, and philosophy. From 1951 to 1955, he was appointed to [[Harvard University]]'s [[Society of Fellows]]. While at Harvard, he developed the theory of [[transformational grammar]]; for this, he was awarded his doctorate in 1955. Chomsky began teaching at MIT in 1957 and emerged as a significant figure in the field of linguistics for his landmark work ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'', which remodelled the scientific study of language. From 1958 to 1959, he was a [[National Science Foundation]] fellow at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. Chomsky is credited as the creator or co-creator of the [[Universal Grammar|universal grammar]] theory, the [[generative grammar]] theory, the [[Chomsky hierarchy]], and the [[minimalist program]]. Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of [[behaviorism]], being particularly critical of the work of [[B. F. Skinner]].

&lt;!--Later life post-1967--&gt;
Chomsky [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|vocally opposed U.S. involvement]] in the [[Vietnam War]], believing the war to be an act of [[American imperialism]]. In 1967, Chomsky attracted widespread public attention for his anti-war essay entitled "[[The Responsibility of Intellectuals]]". Associated with the [[New Left]], he was arrested multiple times for his activism and was placed on [[Nixon's Enemies List|Nixon's "Enemies List"]]. While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades, he also became involved in the [[Linguistics Wars]]. In collaboration with [[Edward S. Herman]], Chomsky later co-wrote [[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media|an analysis]], which articulated the [[propaganda model]] of media criticism, and worked to expose the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]]. Additionally, his defense of [[freedom of speech]]—including free speech for [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]]—generated significant controversy in the [[Faurisson affair]] of the early 1980s. Following his retirement from active teaching, Chomsky has continued his vocal political activism by opposing the [[War on Terror]] and supporting the [[Occupy Movement]].

&lt;!--Brief assessment of Chomsky's reception and legacy:--&gt;
One of the most cited scholars in history, Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields. He is widely recognized as a [[paradigm shift]]er who helped spark a [[cognitive revolution|major revolution]] in the [[human sciences]], contributing to the development of a new [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivistic]] framework for the study of [[language]] and the [[mind]]. In addition to his continued scholarly research, he remains a leading [[Criticism of American foreign policy|critic]] of [[U.S. foreign policy]], [[neoliberalism]] and contemporary [[state capitalism]], the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], and mainstream [[news media]]. His ideas have proved highly significant within the [[anti-capitalist]] and [[anti-imperialist]] movements. Some of his critics have accused him of [[anti-Americanism]].

== Early life ==

===Childhood: 1928–45===
Avram Noam Chomsky was born on December 7, 1928, in the [[East Oak Lane, Philadelphia|East Oak Lane]] neighborhood of [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=9|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=3}} His father was [[William Chomsky|William "Zev" Chomsky]], an Ashkenazi Jew originally from [[Ukraine]] who had fled to the United States in 1913. Having studied at [[Johns Hopkins University]], William went on to become school principal of the [[Congregation Mikveh Israel]] religious school, and in 1924 was appointed to the faculty at [[Gratz College]] in Philadelphia. Chomsky's mother was the Belarusian-born Elsie Simonofsky (1904–1972), a teacher and activist whom William had met while working at Mikveh Israel.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=9–10|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=11}}

{{Quote box|width=246px|align=left|quote=What motivated his [political] interests? A powerful curiosity, exposure to divergent opinions, and an unorthodox education have all been given as answers to this question. He was clearly struck by the obvious contradictions between his own readings and mainstream press reports. The measurement of the distance between the realities presented by these two sources, and the evaluation of why such a gap exists, remained a passion for Chomsky.|source=Biographer [[Robert F. Barsky]], 1997{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=30–31}}}}
{{external media| float = left|width = 270px| video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?88099-1/noam-chomsky-life-dissent Presentation by Robert F. Barsky on ''Noam Chomsky: A Life of Dissent'', July 19, 1997], [[C-SPAN]]}}
Noam was the Chomsky family's first child. His younger brother, David Eli Chomsky, was born five years later.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=11–13|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=11}} The brothers were close, although David was more easygoing while Noam could be very competitive.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=11–13}} Chomsky and his brother were raised Jewish, being taught Hebrew and regularly discussing the political theories of [[Zionism]]; the family was particularly influenced by the [[Left Zionism|Left Zionist]] writings of [[Ahad Ha'am]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=11–13|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=11}} As a Jew, Chomsky faced [[anti-semitism]] as a child, particularly from the Irish and German communities living in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=15}}

Chomsky described his parents as "normal [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]" who had a [[centre-left politics|center-left]] position on the political spectrum; however, he was exposed to [[far-left politics]] through other members of the family, a number of whom were [[socialism|socialists]] involved in the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=14|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=11, 14–15}} He was substantially influenced by his uncle who owned a newspaper stand in New York City, where Jewish leftists came to debate the issues of the day.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=23|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=12, 14–15, 67|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=4}} Whenever visiting his uncle, Chomsky frequented left-wing and anarchist bookstores in the city, voraciously reading political literature.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=23}} He later described his discovery of [[anarchism]] as "a lucky accident",{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=17–19}} because it allowed him to become critical of other far-left ideologies, namely [[Stalinism]] and other forms of [[Marxism–Leninism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=17–19|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=16, 18}}

Chomsky's primary education was at [[Oak Lane Day School|Oak Lane Country Day School]], an independent [[Deweyism|Deweyite]] institution that focused on allowing its pupils to pursue their own interests in a non-competitive atmosphere.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=15–17|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=12|4a1=McGilvray|4y=2014|4p=3}} It was here, at the age of 10, that he wrote his first article, on the spread of [[fascism]], following the [[Catalonia Offensive|fall of Barcelona]] to [[Francisco Franco]]'s fascist army in the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=15–17|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=13|4a1=McGilvray|4y=2014|4p=3}} At the age of 12, Chomsky moved on to secondary education at [[Central High School (Philadelphia)|Central High School]], where he joined various clubs and societies and excelled academically, but was troubled by the hierarchical and regimented method of teaching used there.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=21–22|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=14|4a1=McGilvray|4y=2014|4p=4}} During the same time period, Chomsky attended the Hebrew High School at [[Gratz College]]. From the age of 12 or 13, he identified more fully with anarchist politics.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=15–17}}

In 1945, Chomsky, aged 16, embarked on a general program of study at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he explored philosophy, logic, and languages and developed a primary interest in learning [[Arabic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=47|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=16}} Living at home, he funded his undergraduate degree by teaching Hebrew.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=47}} However, he was frustrated with his experiences at the university, and considered dropping out and moving to a [[kibbutz]] in [[Mandatory Palestine]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=17}} His intellectual curiosity was reawakened through conversations with the Russian-born linguist [[Zellig Harris]], whom he first met in a political circle in 1947. Harris introduced Chomsky to the field of theoretical linguistics and convinced him to major in the subject.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=48–51|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=18–19, 31}} Chomsky's [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] honors thesis was titled "Morphophonemics of Modern Hebrew", and involved his applying Harris's methods to the language.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=51–52|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=32}} Chomsky revised this thesis for his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]], which he received at Penn in 1951; it would subsequently be published as a book.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=51–52|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=33}} He also developed his interest in philosophy while at university, in particular under the tutelage of his teacher [[Nelson Goodman]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=33}}

From 1951 to 1955, Chomsky was named to the [[Society of Fellows]] at [[Harvard University]], where he undertook research on what would become his doctoral dissertation.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=79|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=20}} Having been encouraged by Goodman to apply,{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=34}} a significant factor in his decision to move to Harvard was that the philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]] was based there. Both Quine and a visiting philosopher, [[J. L. Austin]] of the [[University of Oxford]], would strongly influence Chomsky.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=33–34}} In 1952, Chomsky published his first [[academic article]], "Systems of Syntactic Analysis", which appeared not in a journal of linguistics, but in ''[[The Journal of Symbolic Logic]]''.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=34}} Being highly critical of the established behaviorist currents in linguistics, in 1954 he presented his ideas at lectures given at the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Yale University]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=81}} Although he had not been registered as a student at Pennsylvania for four years, in 1955 he submitted a thesis to them setting out his ideas on [[transformational grammar]]; he was awarded his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] on the basis of it, and it would be privately distributed among specialists on [[microfilm]] before being published in 1975 as part of ''The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory''.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=83–85|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=36|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3pp=4–5}} Possession of this Ph.D. nullified his requirement to enter [[national service]] in the armed forces, which was otherwise due to begin in 1955.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=36}} [[George Armitage Miller]], a Professor at Harvard, read the Ph.D. and was impressed; together he and Chomsky published a number of technical papers in [[mathematical linguistics]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=38}}

{{double image|left|Rudolf Rocker.jpg|155|George Orwell press photo.jpg|152|The work of anarcho-syndicalist [[Rudolf Rocker]] (left) and democratic socialist [[George Orwell]] (right) significantly influenced the young Chomsky.}}

In 1947, Chomsky entered into a romantic relationship with [[Carol Chomsky|Carol Doris Schatz]], whom he had known since they were toddlers, and they married in 1949.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=13, 48, 51–52|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=18–19}} After Chomsky was made a Fellow at Harvard, the couple moved to an apartment in the [[Allston]] area of [[Boston]], remaining there until 1965, when they relocated to the suburb of [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=20}} In 1953 the couple took up a Harvard travel grant in order to visit Europe, traveling from the [[United Kingdom]] through [[France]] and [[Switzerland]] and into [[Italy]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=20–21}} On that same trip they also spent six weeks in [[Israel]] at [[Hashomer Hatzair]]'s [[HaZore'a]] Kibbutz. Although enjoying himself, Chomsky was appalled by the Jewish nationalism and [[Anti-Arabism|anti-Arab racism]] that he encountered in the country, as well as the pro-Stalinist trend that he thought pervaded the kibbutz's leftist community.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=82|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=20–21}}

On visits to New York City, Chomsky continued to frequent the office of Yiddish anarchist journal ''[[Freie Arbeiter Stimme]]'', becoming enamored with the ideas of contributor [[Rudolf Rocker]], whose work introduced him to the link between anarchism and [[classical liberalism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=24|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=13}} Other political thinkers whose work Chomsky read included the anarchist [[Diego Abad de Santillán]], democratic socialists [[George Orwell]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[Dwight Macdonald]], and works by Marxists [[Karl Liebknecht]], [[Karl Korsch]], and [[Rosa Luxemburg]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=24–25}} His readings convinced him of the desirability of an anarcho-syndicalist society, and he became fascinated by the anarcho-syndicalist communes set up during the [[Spanish Civil War]], which were documented in Orwell's ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938).{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=26}} He avidly read leftist journal ''[[politics (magazine 1944-1949)|politics]]'', remarking that it "answered to and developed" his interest in anarchism,{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=34–35}} as well as the periodical ''[[International Council Correspondence|Living Marxism]]'', published by [[council communism|council communist]] [[Paul Mattick]]. Although rejecting its Marxist basis, Chomsky was heavily influenced by council communism, voraciously reading articles in ''Living Marxism'' written by [[Antonie Pannekoek]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=36–40}} He was also greatly interested in the Marlenite ideas of the [[Leninist League (US)|Leninist League]], an anti-Stalinist Marxist–Leninist group, sharing their views that the [[Second World War]] was orchestrated by Western capitalists and the Soviet Union's "[[state capitalism|state capitalists]]" to crush Europe's proletariat.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=43–44}}

===Early career: 1955–66===

Chomsky had befriended two linguists at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), [[Morris Halle]] and [[Roman Jakobson]], the latter of whom secured him an assistant professor position at MIT in 1955. There Chomsky spent half his time on a [[mechanical translation]] project, and the other half teaching a course on linguistics and philosophy.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=86–87|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3pp=38–40}} Chomsky had been recruited to MIT by Jerome Wiesner, an influential scientist who, at this time, was also involved in getting the US's nuclear missile program established &lt;ref&gt;Chris Knight (2018). ''Decoding Chomsky; Science and revolutionary politics''. Yale University Press., pp. x-xii, 16, 30, 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Having brought such missile research to MIT, Wiesner then became a nuclear strategy adviser to both Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy, before returning to MIT to oversee research programmes at the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Knight 2018, pp. xi-xii; Snead, D. L. 1999. ''The Gaither Committee, Eisenhower, and the Cold War''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite its military involvement, Chomsky has described MIT as "a pretty free and open place, open to experimentation and without rigid requirements. It was just perfect for someone of my idiosyncratic interests and work."{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=87}} In 1957 MIT promoted him to the position of associate professor, and from 1957 to 1958 he was also employed by [[Columbia University]] as a visiting professor.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xvi|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=91}} That same year, Chomsky's first child, a daughter named Aviva, was born,{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=91|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=22}} and he published his first book on linguistics, ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'', a work that radically opposed the dominant [[Zellig Harris|Harris]]–[[Leonard Bloomfield|Bloomfield]] trend in the field.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=88–91|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=40|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=5}} The response to Chomsky's ideas ranged from indifference to hostility, and his work proved divisive and caused "significant upheaval" in the discipline.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=88–91}} Linguist [[John Lyons (linguist)|John Lyons]] later asserted that it "revolutionized the scientific study of language".{{sfn|Lyons|1978|p=1}} From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a [[National Science Foundation]] fellow at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xvi|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=84}}

In 1959 he published a review of [[B. F. Skinner]]'s 1957 book ''[[Verbal Behavior]]'' in the journal ''[[Language (journal)|Language]]'', in which he argued against Skinner's view of language as learned behavior.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=6|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=96–99|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=41|4a1=McGilvray|4y=2014|4p=5}} Opining that Skinner ignored the role of human creativity in linguistics, his review helped him to become an "established intellectual",{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=119}} and he proceeded to found MIT's Graduate Program in linguistics with Halle. In 1961 he was awarded [[academic tenure]], being made a full professor in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=101–102, 119|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=23}} He went on to be appointed plenary speaker at the Ninth [[International Congress of Linguists]], held in 1962 in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], which established him as the ''de facto'' spokesperson of American linguistics.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=102}} He continued to publish his linguistic ideas throughout the decade, including in ''[[Aspects of the Theory of Syntax]]'' (1966), ''Topics in the Theory of Generative Grammar'' (1966), and ''[[Cartesian linguistics|Cartesian Linguistics: A Chapter in the History of Rationalist Thought]]'' (1966).{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=103}} Along with Halle, he also edited the ''Studies in Language'' series of books for [[Harper and Row]],{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=104}} and extended the theory of generative grammar to [[phonology]] in ''[[The Sound Pattern of English]]'' (1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://libraries.mit.edu/chomsky/slideshow/#active=1&amp;slide=b4 |title=Slideshow {{!}} unBox the Chomsky Archive |publisher= MIT  |access-date=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued to receive academic recognition and honors for his work, in 1966 visiting a variety of Californian institutions, first as the [[Linguistics Society of America]] Professor at the [[University of California]], and then as the Beckman Professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xvi|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=120}} His Beckman lectures would be assembled and published as ''Language and Mind'' in 1968.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=122}} In this period, military scientists were also interested in Chomsky's linguistics. As former Air Force Colonel, Anthony Debons, said: "much of the research conducted at MIT by Chomsky and his colleagues [has] direct application to the efforts undertaken by military scientists to develop … languages for computer operations in military command and control systems."&lt;ref&gt;A. Debons, 'Command and Control: Technology and Social Impact', in F. Alt and M. Rubinoff, ''Advances in Computers'', Vol.11, 1971. New York/London 1971, p354; A. Newell in G. Bugliarello (ed.), ''Bioengineering: An Engineering View'', San Francisco 1968, p271.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, between 1963 and 1965, Chomsky was a consultant for a military sponsored project "to establish natural language as an operational language for command and control." One of Chomsky's students who also worked on this project, [[Barbara Partee]], says that this research was justified to the military on the basis that "in the event of a nuclear war, the generals would be underground with some computers trying to manage things, and that it would probably be easier to teach computers to understand English than to teach the generals to program."&lt;ref&gt;C. Knight, [http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2018/03/when-the-pentagon-looked-to-chomskys-linguistics-for-their-weapons-systems.html 'When the Pentagon Looked to Chomsky’s Linguistics for their Weapons Systems'], ''3 Quarks Daily'', 12 March 2018 (citing Arnold Zwicky, [https://www.stanford.edu/~zwicky/grammars-of-number-theory.pdf ‘Grammars of Number Theory: Some Examples’], Working Paper W-6671, MITRE Corp., 1963, Foreword, last page).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these scientists eventually found Chomsky's theories unworkable for their computer systems. Other subsequent difficulties with the theories led to various debates between Chomsky and his critics that came to be known as the "[[Linguistics Wars]]", although they revolved largely around debating philosophical issues rather than linguistics proper.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=60–61}}

===Anti-Vietnam War activism and rise to prominence: 1967–75===
{{Quote box|width=246px|align=left|quote=[I]t does not require very far-reaching, specialized knowledge to perceive that the United States was invading South Vietnam. And, in fact, to take apart the system of illusions and deception which functions to prevent understanding of contemporary reality [is] not a task that requires extraordinary skill or understanding. It requires the kind of normal skepticism and willingness to apply one's analytical skills that almost all people have and that they can exercise.|source=Chomsky on the Vietnam War{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=114}}}}

Chomsky first involved himself in active political protest against U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] in 1962, speaking on the subject at small gatherings in churches and homes.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=78}} However, it was not until 1967 that he publicly entered the debate on United States foreign policy.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=120}} In February he published a widely read essay in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' entitled "[[The Responsibility of Intellectuals]]", in which he criticized the country's involvement in the conflict; the essay was based on an earlier talk that he had given to Harvard's Foundation for Jewish Campus Life.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=122|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=83}} He expanded on his argument to produce his first political book, ''[[American Power and the New Mandarins]],'' which was published in 1969 and soon established him at the forefront of American dissent.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xvii|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=122–123|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=83}} His other political books of the time included ''At War with Asia'' (1971), ''The Backroom Boys'' (1973), ''For Reasons of State'' (1973), and ''Peace in the Middle East?'' (1975), published by [[Pantheon Books]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1pp=xvi–xvii|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=163|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=87}} Coming to be associated with the American [[New Left]] movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=5|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=123}} he nevertheless thought little of prominent New Left intellectuals [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Erich Fromm]], and preferred the company of activists to intellectuals.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=134–135}} Although ''The New York Review of Books'' did publish contributions from Chomsky and other leftists from 1967 to 1973, when an editorial change put a stop to it,{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=162–163|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=87}} he was virtually ignored by the rest of the mainstream press throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=162–163}}

Along with his writings, Chomsky also became actively involved in left-wing activism. Refusing to pay half his taxes, he publicly supported students who refused [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]], and was arrested for being part of an anti-war teach-in outside [[the Pentagon]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=5|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=127–129}} During this time, Chomsky, along with [[Mitchell Goodman]], [[Denise Levertov]], [[William Sloane Coffin]], and [[Dwight Macdonald]], also founded the anti-war collective [[RESIST (non-profit)|RESIST]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=5|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=127–129|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3pp=80–81}} Although he questioned the objectives of the [[1968 student protests]],{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=121–122, 131}} Chomsky gave many lectures to student activist groups; furthermore, he and his colleague Louis Kampf began running undergraduate courses on politics at MIT, independently of the conservative-dominated [[political science]] department.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=121|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=78}}

During this period, MIT's various departments were researching helicopters, smart bombs and counterinsurgency techniques for the war in Vietnam and, as Chomsky says, "a good deal of [nuclear] missile guidance technology was developed right on the MIT campus".&lt;ref&gt;Albert, Michael (2006). ''Remembering Tomorrow: From the politics of opposition to what we are for'', Seven Stories Press, pp. 97–99; C. P. Otero (1988). ''Noam Chomsky: Language and politics'', Black Rose, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; As Chomsky elaborates, "[MIT was] about 90% Pentagon funded at that time. And I personally was right in the middle of it. I was in a military lab&amp;nbsp;... the Research Laboratory for Electronics."&lt;ref&gt;White, G. D. (2000). ''Campus Inc.: Corporate power in the ivory tower''. Prometheus Books, pp. 445–446.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1969, student activists were actively campaigning "to stop the war research" at MIT.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Shalom, [http://nova.wpunj.edu/newpolitics/issue23/shalom23.htm "Review of Noam Chomsky: A Life of Dissent, by Robert F. Barsky"], ''New Politics'', NS6(3), Issue 23. Retrieved October 7, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky was sympathetic to the students but he also thought it best to keep such research on campus and he proposed that it should be restricted to what he called "systems of a purely defensive and deterrent character".&lt;ref&gt;Barsky 1997, pp. 121–122, 140-141; Albert 2006, p. 98; Knight 2016, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; MIT had six of its anti-war student activists sentenced to prison terms. Chomsky says MIT's students suffered things that "should not have happened." However, Chomsky has also claimed that MIT has "quite a good record on civil liberties".&lt;ref&gt;Albert 2006, pp. 107–108; Knight 2016, pp. 36–38, 249.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 Chomsky visited the Vietnamese city of [[Hanoi]] to give a lecture at the [[Hanoi University of Science and Technology]]; on this trip he also toured Laos to visit the refugee camps created by the war, and in 1973 he was among those leading a committee to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the [[War Resisters League]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=153|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=24–25, 84–85}}

[[File:Nixon 30-0316a.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|President [[Richard Nixon]] placed Chomsky on his "Enemies List".]]

As a result of his anti-war activism, Chomsky was ultimately arrested on multiple occasions, and U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] included him on the [[Master list of Nixon's political opponents|master version]] of his [[Nixon's Enemies List|"Enemies List"]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=124|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=80}} He was aware of the potential repercussions of his civil disobedience, and his wife began studying for her own Ph.D. in linguistics in order to support the family in the event of Chomsky's imprisonment or loss of employment.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=123–124|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=22}} However, MIT – despite being under some pressure to do so – refused to fire him due to his influential standing in the field of linguistics.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=143}} His work in this area continued to gain international recognition; in 1967 he received honorary doctorates from both the [[University of London]] and the [[University of Chicago]][[Doctor of Humane Letters|.]]{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1pp=xv–xvi|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=120}} In 1970, [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University]] and [[Swarthmore College]] also awarded him honorary D.H.L.'s, as did [[Bard College]] in 1971, [[Delhi University]] in 1972, and the [[University of Massachusetts]] in 1973.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1pp=xv–xvi|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=143}}

In 1971 Chomsky gave the Bertrand Russell Memorial Lectures at the [[University of Cambridge]], which were published as ''Problems of Knowledge and Freedom'' later that year. He also delivered the [[Whidden Lectures]] at [[McMaster University]], the [[Huizinga Lecture]] at [[Leiden University]] in the Netherlands, the Woodbridge Lectures at [[Columbia University]], and the Kant Lectures at [[Stanford University]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=156}} In 1971 he partook in a [[Chomsky-Foucault Debate|televised debate]] with French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] on Dutch television, entitled ''Human Nature: Justice versus Power''.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=192–195|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=52|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=222}} Although largely agreeing with Foucault's ideas, he was critical of [[post-modernism]] and French philosophy generally, believing that post-modern leftist philosophers used obfuscating language which did little to aid the cause of the working-classes{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=192–195|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=53}} and lambasting France as having "a highly parochial and remarkably illiterate culture".{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=192–195}} Chomsky also continued to publish prolifically in linguistics, publishing ''Studies on Semantics in Generative Grammar'' (1972),{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=143}} an enlarged edition of ''Language and Mind'' (1972),{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=51}} and ''Reflections on Language'' (1975).{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=51}} In 1974 he became a corresponding fellow of the [[British Academy]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=156}}

[[File:Noam Chomsky (1977).jpg|thumb|left|Noam Chomsky (1977)]]
Throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, Chomsky's publications expanded and clarified his earlier work, addressing his critics and updating his grammatical theory.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=175}} His public talks often generated considerable controversy, particularly when he criticized actions of the Israeli government and military,{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=167, 170}} and his political views came under attack from right-wing and centrist figures, the most prominent of whom was [[Alan Dershowitz]]. Chomsky considered Dershowitz "a complete liar" and accused him of actively misrepresenting his position on issues.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=170–171}}  During the early 1970s Chomsky began collaborating with [[Edward S. Herman]], who had also published critiques of the U.S. war in Vietnam.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=157}} Together they authored ''[[Counter-Revolutionary Violence: Bloodbaths in Fact &amp; Propaganda]]'', a book which criticized U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia and highlighted how mainstream media neglected to cover stories about these activities; the publisher [[Warner Modular]] initially accepted it, and it was published in 1973. However, Warner Modular's parent company, [[Warner Communications]], disapproved of the book's contents and ordered all copies to be destroyed.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=160–162|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=86}}

While mainstream publishing options proved elusive, Chomsky found support from [[Michael Albert]]'s [[South End Press]], an activist-oriented publishing company.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=85}}
In 1979, Chomsky and Herman revised ''Counter-Revolutionary Violence'' and published it with South End Press as the two-volume ''[[The Political Economy of Human Rights]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=187|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=86}} In this they compared U.S. media reactions to the [[Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia|Cambodian genocide]] and the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]]. They argued that because Indonesia was a U.S. ally, U.S. media ignored the East Timorese situation while focusing on that in Cambodia, a U.S. enemy.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=187}}&lt;ref&gt;This Chomsky-Herman thesis has been challenged by Sophal Ear, who "argues that concurrent [media] coverage of human rights violations in right-wing regimes in [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|Chile]] and [[South Korea]] exceeded the coverage given to Cambodia" during the genocide: See {{cite web |last=Sharp |first=Bruce |url=http://www.mekong.net/cambodia/chomsky.htm |title=Averaging Wrong Answers: Noam Chomsky and the Cambodia Controversy |website=Mekong.net |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking a particular interest in the situation in East Timor, Chomsky testified on the subject in front of the [[United Nations]]' [[Special Committee on Decolonization]] in both 1978 and 1979, and attended a conference on the occupation held in [[Lisbon]] in 1979.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=103}} The following year, the Marxist academic, [[Steven Lukes]] authored an article for the ''[[Times Higher Education Supplement]]'' accusing Chomsky of betraying his anarchist ideals and acting as an apologist for Cambodian leader [[Pol Pot]].&lt;ref&gt;https://libcom.org/files/lukes_chomsky_debate_1980_1981-2_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Laura J. Summers and Robin Woodsworth Carlsen replied to the article, arguing that Lukes completely misunderstood Chomsky and Herman's work. The controversy damaged his reputation,{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=187–189}} and Chomsky maintains that his critics deliberately printed lies about him in order to defame him.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=190}}

Although Chomsky had long publicly criticized [[Nazism]] and [[totalitarianism]] more generally, his commitment to [[freedom of speech]] led him to defend the right of French historian [[Robert Faurisson]] to advocate a position widely characterized as [[Holocaust denial]]. Without Chomsky's knowledge, his plea for the historian's freedom of speech was published as the preface to Faurisson's 1980 book ''Mémoire en défense contre ceux qui m'accusent de falsifier l'histoire''.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=179–180|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=61}} Chomsky was widely condemned for defending Faurisson,{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=185|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=61}} and France's mainstream press accused Chomsky of being a Holocaust denier himself, refusing to publish his rebuttals to their accusations.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=184}} Critiquing Chomsky's position, sociologist [[Werner Cohn]] later published an analysis of the affair titled ''Partners in Hate: Noam Chomsky and the Holocaust Deniers''.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=78}} The Faurisson affair had a lasting, damaging effect on Chomsky's career,{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=185}} and Chomsky did not visit France, where the translation of his political writings was delayed until the 2000s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Birnbaum |first=Jean |title=Chomsky à Paris: chronique d'un malentendu |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/livres/article/2010/06/03/chomsky-a-paris-chronique-d-un-malentendu_1367002_3260.html |work=Le Monde des Livres |date=June 3, 2010 |accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for almost thirty years following the debacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Aeschimann |first=Eric |title=Chomsky s'est exposé, il est donc une cible désignée |url=http://www.liberation.fr/monde/0101638536-chomsky-s-est-expose-il-est-donc-une-cible-designee |work=Liberátion |date=31 May 2010 |accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaganite era and work on the media: 1980–89===

The election of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidate [[Ronald Reagan]] to the U.S. Presidency in 1980 marked a period of increased military intervention in [[Central America]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=90–91}} In 1985, during [[Nicaraguan Revolution#Contra War|Nicaragua's Contra War]] – in which the U.S. supported the [[Contras|Contra militia]] against the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] government – Chomsky travelled to [[Managua]] to meet with workers' organizations and refugees of the conflict, giving public lectures on politics and linguistics.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=91, 92}} Many of these lectures would be published in 1987 as ''On Power and Ideology: The Managua Lectures''.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=91}} In 1983 he published ''[[The Fateful Triangle]]'', an examination of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israel-Palestine conflict]] and the place of the U.S. within it, arguing that the U.S. had continually used the conflict for its own ends.{{sfnm|1a1=Sperlich|1y=2006|1p=99|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2p=13}} In 1988, Chomsky then visited the [[Palestinian territories]] to witness the impact of Israeli military occupation.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=98}}

In 1988, Chomsky and Herman published ''[[Manufacturing Consent|Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media]]'', in which they outlined their [[propaganda model]] for understanding the mainstream media; there they argued that even in countries without official censorship, the news provided was censored through four filters which had a great impact on what stories are reported and how they are presented.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=160, 202|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=127–134}} The book was adapted into a 1992 film, ''[[Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media]]'', which was directed by [[Mark Achbar]] and [[Peter Wintonick]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=136}} In 1989, Chomsky published ''[[Necessary Illusions|Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies]],'' in which he critiqued what he sees as the pseudo-democratic nature of Western capitalist states.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=138–139}}

By the 1980s, a number of Chomsky's students had become leading linguistic specialists in their own right, expanding, revising, and expanding on Chomsky's ideas of generative grammar.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=53}} By the end of the 1980s, Chomsky had established himself as a globally recognized figure.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=59}}

===Increased political activism: 1990–present===

In the 1990s, Chomsky embraced political activism to a greater degree than before.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=214}} Retaining his commitment to the cause of East Timorese independence, in 1995 he visited Australia to talk on the issue at the behest of the [[East Timorese Relief Association]] and the [[National Council for East Timorese Resistance]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=104}} The lectures that he gave on the subject would be published as ''Powers and Prospects'' in 1996.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=104}} As a result of the international publicity generated by Chomsky, his biographer Wolfgang Sperlich opined that he did more to aid the cause of East Timorese independence than anyone but the investigative journalist [[John Pilger]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=107}} After East Timor's independence from Indonesia was achieved in 1999, the Australian-led [[International Force for East Timor]] arrived as a peacekeeping force; Chomsky was critical of this, believing that it was designed to secure Australian access to East Timor's oil and gas reserves under the [[Timor Gap Treaty]]. {{Sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=109–110}} Chomsky's book ''Profit Over People: Neoliberalism and Global Order'' was a [[Boston Globe]] and Voice Literary Supplement bestseller in 1999.

[[File:Noam Chomsky WSF - 2003.jpg|thumb|left|Chomsky at the [[World Social Forum]] ([[Porto Alegre]]) in 2003]]

Chomsky retired from full-time teaching,{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=6}} although as an [[Emeritus]] he nevertheless continued to conduct research and seminars at MIT.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=10}}

After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, Chomsky was widely interviewed, with these interviews being collated and published by [[Seven Stories Press]] in October.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=110–111}}
Chomsky argued that the ensuing [[War on Terror]] was not a new development, but rather a continuation of the same U.S. foreign policy and its concomitant rhetoric that had been pursued since at least the Reagan era of the 1980s.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=143}} In 2003 he published ''[[Hegemony or Survival]]'', in which he articulated what he called the United States' "imperial grand strategy" and critiqued the [[Iraq War]] and other aspects of the 'War on Terror.'{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=114–118}}

Chomsky toured the world with increasing regularity during this period, giving talks on various subjects.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=120}} In 2001 he gave the [[D.T. Lakdawala]] Memorial Lecture&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/2001/11/04/stories/0204000j.htm U.S., Britain ignored 'culture of terrorism': Chomsky], ''[[The Hindu]]'' November 4, 2001. Retrieved 21 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[New Delhi]], India, and in 2003 visited Cuba at the invitation of the [[Latin American Association of Social Scientists]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=120}} In 2002 Chomsky visited Turkey in order to attend the trial of a publisher who had been accused of treason for printing one of Chomsky's books; Chomsky insisted on being a [[co-defendant]] and amid international media attention the Security Courts dropped the prosecution on the first day.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=25}} During that trip, Chomsky visited Kurdish areas of Turkey and spoke out in favour of the Kurds' [[human rights]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=25}} A supporter of the [[World Social Forum]], he attended their conferences in Brazil in both 2002 and 2003, also attending the Forum event in India.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=112–113, 120}}

His wife, Carol, died in December 2008.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=6}}

[[File:Noam Chomsky Toronto 2011.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Chomsky speaking in support of the [[Occupy movement]] in 2011]]

Chomsky was drawn to the energy and activism of the [[Occupy movement]], delivering talks at encampments and producing two works that chronicled its influence, first [[Occupy (Chomsky book)|''Occupy'']] a pamphlet, in 2012, then, in 2013, ''Occupy: Reflections on Class War, Rebellion and Solidarity''. Both were published by [[Zuccotti Park Press]]. His analysis included a critique that attributed Occupy's growth as a response to a perceived abandonment of the interests of the white working class by the Democratic Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/jul/06/noam-chomsky-occupy-movement-spark-video |title=Noam Chomsky: 'The Occupy movement just lit a spark' – video |last=Younge |first=Gary |date=July 6, 2012 |last2=Hogue |first2=Kat Keene |newspaper=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077 |last3=theguardian.com|access-date=April 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Chomsky joined the [[Nuclear Age Peace Foundation]] advisory council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Noam Chomsky Joins NAPF Advisory Council |url=https://www.wagingpeace.org/noam-chomsky-joins-napf-advisory-council/ |website=Nuclear Age Peace Foundation |accessdate=27 July 2018 |date=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a senior fellow there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ferguson |first1=Joe |title=Tickets on sale for Tucson talk on nuclear war with Noam Chomsky, Daniel Ellsberg |url=https://tucson.com/news/local/tickets-on-sale-for-tucson-talk-on-nuclear-war-with/article_66bf8396-1b21-5af5-9843-79bcbf551fd0.html |website=Arizona Daily Star |accessdate=27 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015, Chomsky announced his support for [[Vermont]] U.S. senator [[Bernie Sanders]] in the upcoming [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/19/bernie-sanders-profile-democrat-presidential-candidate |title=Inside the mind of Bernie Sanders: unbowed, unchanged, and unafraid of a good fight |work=The Guardian |date=June 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117082624/http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/19/bernie-sanders-profile-democrat-presidential-candidate |archive-date=January 17, 2016 |dead-url=no |first=Paul |last=Lewis |location=London |issn=0261-3077 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2016, Chomsky was publicly rebuked by President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] of Turkey after he signed an [[open letter]] condemning the Turkish leader for his [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1978–present)#2015 PKK rebellion|anti-Kurdish repression]] and for holding double standards on terrorism.&lt;ref name="erdogan"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Chomsky hits back at Erdoğan, accusing him of double standards on terrorism |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/14/chomsky-hits-back-erdogan-double-standards-terrorism-bomb-istanbul |newspaper=The Guardian |date=January 14, 2016|access-date =January 14, 2016 |issn= |language= |first=Matthew |last=Weaver}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky accused Erdoğan of [[hypocrisy]] and added that the Turkish president supports [[al-Qaeda]]'s Syrian affiliate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/syria-crisis-turkey-and-saudi-arabia-shock-western-countries-by-supporting-antiassad-jihadists-10242747.html |title=Turkey and Saudi Arabia alarm the West by backing Islamist extremists the Americans had bombed in Syria |author=Sengupta, Kim |newspaper=The Independent |date=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[al-Nusra Front]].&lt;ref name="erdogan" /&gt; Chomsky also criticized the U.S.'s close ties with Saudi Arabia and U.S. involvement in [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]], highlighting that Saudi has "one of the most grotesque human rights records in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2016/5/17/chomsky_saudi_arabia_is_the_center |title=Chomsky: Saudi Arabia is the "Center of Radical Islamic Extremism" Now Spreading Among Sunni Muslims |date=May 17, 2016 |newspaper=[[Democracy Now!]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the documentary ''[[Requiem for the American Dream]]'' was released, summarizing his views on capitalism and economic inequality through a "75-minute teach-in".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/movies/review-noam-chomsky-focuses-on-financial-inequality.html |title=Review: Noam Chomsky Focuses on Financial Inequality in 'Requiem for the American Dream' |last=Gold |first=Daniel M. |date=January 28, 2016 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331|access-date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Requiem for the American Dream'' was published as a book in 2017, and is a furthering of the ideas put forward in the 2016 documentary ([[Seven Stories Press]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sevenstories.com/books/3993-requiem-for-the-american-dream |title=Books &amp;#124; Seven Stories Press |publisher=Sevenstories.com |date= |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Al Jazeera, Chomsky called [[Donald Trump]] an "ignorant, thin-skinned megalomaniac" and a "greater evil" than Hillary Clinton. Asked about claims that Russia interfered in the U.S. presidential election through hacking, Chomsky said: "It's possible, but it's a kind of strange complaint in the United States. The U.S. has been [[Foreign electoral intervention|interfering]] with, and undermining, elections all over the world for decades and is proud of it."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://pr.aljazeera.com/post/153594128485/noam-chomsky-speaks-with-upfront-slams-media Noam Chomsky speaks with ‘Upfront’ – slams media coverage, criticises third party voters]". Al Jazeera. November 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, at age 88 and retired since 2002, Chomsky left [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] to join the linguistics department of [[University of Arizona]] in Tucson as part-time faculty,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/08/28/chomsky-joins-university-arizona-faculty/JYdA9TjGk6OeBwa7Q8fPjJ/story.html Noam Chomsky leaves MIT to join University of Arizona faculty]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weidenfeld |first1=Lisa |title=Noam Chomsky Is Leaving MIT |url=https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2017/08/29/noam-chomsky-mit-arizona/ |website=Boston Magazine |accessdate=27 July 2018 |date=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; officially starting a few weeks later, and teaching in spring 2018.&lt;ref name="Univ.

In July 2018, Chomsky said in an interview with ''[[Democracy Now!]]'' that "it's hard to think of a more brutal and sadistic policy" about the [[Trump administration family separation policy]].&lt;ref name="url Brutal and Sadistic: Noam Chomsky on Family Separation &amp; the U.S. Roots of Today's Refugee Crisis | Democracy Now!"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/7/27/brutal_and_sadistic_noam_chomsky_on |title="Brutal and Sadistic": Noam Chomsky on Family Separation &amp; the U.S. Roots of Today's Refugee Crisis &amp;#124; Democracy Now! |format= |website= |accessdate=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same interview Chomsky also said that [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]]'s victory of the 2018 New York primary election "was a quite spectacular and significant event".&lt;ref name="url Noam Chomsky on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Spectacular Victory &amp; Growing Split in Democratic Party | Democracy Now!"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/7/27/noam_chomsky_on_alexandria_ocasio_cortezs |title=Noam Chomsky on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's "Spectacular" Victory &amp; Growing Split in Democratic Party &amp;#124; Democracy Now! |format= |website= |accessdate=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the field of linguistics, McGilvray credits Chomsky with inaugurating the "[[cognitive revolution]]".{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=5}} McGilvray also credits him with establishing the field as a formal, [[natural science]],{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=9}} moving it away from the procedural form of [[structural linguistics]] that was dominant during the mid-20th century.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=9–10}} As such, some have called him "the father of modern linguistics".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=A Changed Noam Chomsky Simplifies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/05/arts/a-changed-noam-chomsky-simplifies.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 5, 1998|access-date =February 22, 2016 |issn=0362-4331 |first=Margalit |last=Fox |quote=Mr. Chomsky&amp;nbsp;... is the father of modern linguistics and remains the field's most influential practitioner.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Noam Chomsky |publisher=MIT150 {{!}} Massachusetts Institute of Technology 150th anniversary |url=https://mit150.mit.edu/infinite-history/noam-chomsky |accessdate=2015-10-24 |quote=Noam Chomsky is an Institute Professor and professor of linguistics emeritus at MIT, widely known as the father of modern linguistics, a philosopher, prolific author, and globally influential political activist. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116154045/https://mit150.mit.edu/infinite-history/noam-chomsky |archivedate=November 16, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LQnsSuvP9dAC |title=Sweet Reason: A Field Guide to Modern Logic |last=Tymoczko |first=Tom |last2=Henle |first2=Jim |date=2004-04-08 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year= |isbn=978-0-387-98930-3 |location= |page=101 |language=en |quote=As the founder of modern linguistics, Noam Chomsky, observed, each of the following sequences of words is nonsense&amp;nbsp;... |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/06/education/edlife/on-being-noam-chomsky.html |title=Noam Chomsky and the Bicycle Theory |last=Tanenhaus |first=Sam |date=October 31, 2016 |work= |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |quote=At 87, Noam Chomsky, the founder of modern linguistics, remains a vital presence in American intellectual life.|access-date=October 31, 2016 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis to Chomsky's linguistic theory is rooted in [[biolinguistics]], holding that the principles underlying the structure of language are biologically determined in the human mind and hence genetically transmitted.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=4|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2pp=2–3}} He therefore argues that all humans share the same underlying linguistic structure, irrespective of sociocultural differences.{{sfn|Lyons|1978|p=7}} In adopting this position, Chomsky rejects the [[radical behaviorism|radical behaviorist]] psychology of B.&amp;nbsp;F. Skinner which views the mind as a ''[[tabula rasa]]'' ("blank slate") and thus treats language as learned behavior.{{sfn|Lyons|1978|p=6}} Accordingly, he argues that language is a unique evolutionary development of the human species and is unlike modes of communication used by any other animal species.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=6|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2pp=2–3}}&lt;ref name="McGill"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Tool Module: Chomsky's Universal Grammar |url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/outil_rouge06.html |publisher=thebrain.mcgill.ca |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky's [[Psychological nativism|nativist]], internalist view of language is consistent with the philosophical school of "[[rationalism]]", and is contrasted with the anti-nativist, externalist view of language, which is consistent with the philosophical school of "[[empiricism]]".{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=11}}&lt;ref name="MTCW"/&gt;

===Universal grammar===
{{Main|Universal grammar}}

Since the 1960s, Chomsky has maintained that syntactic knowledge is at least partially inborn, implying that children need only learn certain parochial features of their native languages. Chomsky based his argument on observations about human language acquisition, noting that there is an enormous gap between the linguistic stimuli to which children are exposed and the rich linguistic knowledge they attain (see: "[[poverty of the stimulus]]" argument). For example, although children are exposed to only a finite subset of the allowable syntactic variants within their first language, they somehow acquire the ability to understand and produce an infinite number of sentences, including ones which have never before been uttered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/noam-chomskys-theory-universal-grammar-right-its-hardwired-our-brains-364236 |title=Noam Chomsky's Theory Of Universal Grammar Is Right; It's Hardwired Into Our Brains |date=2015-12-07 |work=Medical Daily|access-date=2017-08-04 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain this, Chomsky reasoned that the primary linguistic data (PLD) must be supplemented by an innate linguistic capacity. Furthermore, while a human baby and a kitten are both capable of [[inductive reasoning]], if they are exposed to exactly the same linguistic data, the human will always acquire the ability to understand and produce language, while the kitten will never acquire either ability. Chomsky labeled whatever relevant capacity the human has that the cat lacks as the [[language acquisition device]] (LAD), and he suggested that one of the tasks for linguistics should be to determine what the LAD is and what constraints it imposes on the range of possible human languages. The universal features that would result from these constraints constitute "universal grammar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Chomsky, Noam |url=https://chomsky.info/architecture01/ |title=The 'Chomskyan Era' (excerpted from The Architecture of Language) |publisher=Chomsky.info |date= |accessdate=January 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thornbury |first1=Scott |title=An A–Z of ELT (Methodology) |date=2006 |publisher=Macmillan Education |location=Oxford |page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/08/mit-claims-to-have-found-a-language-universal-that-ties-all-languages-together/ |title=MIT claims to have found a "language universal" that ties all languages together |newspaper=Ars Technica|access-date=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transformational generative grammar===
{{Main|Transformational generative grammar}}

Beginning with his ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'' (1957), a distillation of his ''Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory'' (1955), Chomsky challenges [[structural linguistics]] and introduces [[transformational grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kordić, Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |title=Transformacijsko-generativni pristup jeziku u ''Sintaktičkim strukturama'' i ''Aspektima teorije sintakse'' Noama Chomskog |trans-title=Transformational-generative approach to language in ''Syntactic structures'' and ''Aspects of the theory of syntax'' of Noam Chomsky |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/446914.Transformacijsko-generativni_pristup.PDF |language=Serbo-Croatian |journal=SOL: Lingvistički časopis |volume=6 |issue=12–13 |pages=103–112 |year=1991 |issn=0352-8715 |id={{ZDB|1080348-8}} |archivedate=September 2, 2012 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ANNlKB4s?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/446914.Transformacijsko-generativni_pristup.PDF |accessdate=May 15, 2015}} [http://opak.crolib.hr/cgi-bin/unicat.cgi?form=D1941130086 (CROLIB)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky's theory posits that language consists of both deep structures and surface structures. [[Surface structure]] 'faces out' and is represented by spoken utterances, while [[deep structure]] 'faces inward' and expresses the underlying relations between words and conceptual meaning. Transformational grammar is a [[generative grammar]] (which dictates that the syntax, or word order, of surface structures adheres to certain principles and parameters) that consists of a limited series of rules, expressed in mathematical notation, which transform deep structures into well-formed surface structures. The transformational grammar thus relates meaning and sound.&lt;ref name="MTCW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Noam Chomsky |url=https://chomsky.info/2004____/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016015800/https://chomsky.info/2004____/ |archive-date=October 16, 2015 |via=chomsky.info |accessdate=December 18, 2017 |first=Zoltán Gendler |last=Szabó |publisher=Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers, 1860–1960|editor-first = Ernest|editor-last = LePore |year=2004 |location=Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chomsky hierarchy===
{{Main|Chomsky hierarchy}}

The Chomsky hierarchy, sometimes referred to as the Chomsky-Schützenberger hierarchy, is a containment hierarchy of classes of [[formal grammars]]. The hierarchy imposes a logical structure across different language classes and provides a basis for understanding the relationship between grammars (devices that enumerate the valid sentences within languages). In order of increasing expressive power it includes [[regular grammar|regular (or Type-3) grammars]], [[context-free grammar|context-free (or Type-2) grammars]], [[context-sensitive grammar|context-sensitive (or Type-1) grammars]], and [[formal grammar|recursively enumerable (or Type-0) grammars]]. Each class is a strict subset of the class above it, i.e., each successive class can generate a broader set of [[formal languages]] (infinite sets of strings composed from finite sets of symbols, or alphabets) than the one below.&lt;ref name=":522"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cs.wmich.edu/~bhardin/cs4850/ChomskyPresentation.pdf |title=The Chomsky Hierarchy |publisher=cs.wmich.edu |accessdate=February 29, 2016 |author=Robert Hardin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being important in linguistics, the Chomsky hierarchy is also relevant in [[theoretical computer science]], especially in [[programming language theory]],&lt;ref name=":222"&gt;{{cite book |title=Selected Papers on Computer Languages |date=2002 |publisher=Center for the Study of Language and Information |isbn=978-1-57586-381-8 |chapter=Preface |last1=Knuth |first1=Donald}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[compiler]] construction, and [[automata theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Computability, complexity, and languages: fundamentals of theoretical computer science |last2=Weyuker |first2=Elaine J. |last3=Sigal |first3=Ron |publisher=Academic Press, Harcourt, Brace |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-12-206382-4 |edition=2nd |location=Boston |page=327| author-link2 = Elaine Weyuker |last1=Davis |first1=Martin| author-link1 = Martin Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimalist program===
{{Main|Minimalist program}}
Since the 1990s, much of Chomsky's research has focused on what he calls the Minimalist Program (MP), in which he departs from much of his past research and instead attempts to simplify language into a system that relates meaning and sound using the minimum possible faculties that could be expected, given certain external conditions that are imposed on us independently. Chomsky dispenses with concepts such as 'deep structure' and 'surface structure' and instead places emphasis on the plasticity of the brain's neural circuits, along with which comes an infinite number of concepts, or '[[Logical form (linguistics)|logical forms]]'.&lt;ref name="McGill"/&gt; When exposed to linguistic data, the brain of a hearer-speaker then proceeds to associate sound and meaning, and the rules of grammar that we observe are in fact only the consequences, or side effects, of the way that language works. Thus, while much of Chomsky's prior research has focused on the rules of language, he now focuses on the mechanisms that the brain uses to ''create'' these rules.&lt;ref name="McGill"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=A Changed Noam Chomsky Simplifies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/05/arts/a-changed-noam-chomsky-simplifies.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 5, 1998|access-date =February 22, 2016 |issn=0362-4331 |first=Margalit |last=Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chomsky's view, the truth about political realities is systematically distorted or suppressed through elite [[corporatocracy|corporate interests]], who use corporate media, advertising, and [[think tanks]] to promote their own [[propaganda]]. His work seeks to reveal such manipulations and the truth that they obscure.{{sfnm|1a1=Sperlich|1y=2006|1p=8|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2p=158}} He believes that "[[common sense]]" is all that is required to break through the web of falsehood and see the truth, if it (common sense) is employed using both [[critical thinking]] skills and an awareness of the role that self-interest and self-deception plays both on oneself and on others.{{sfnm|1a1=Sperlich|1y=2006|1p=74|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2pp=12–13}} He believes that it is the moral responsibility of intellectuals to tell the truth about the world, but claims that few do so because they fear losing prestige and funding.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=159}} He argues that, as such an intellectual, it is his duty to use his [[privilege (social inequality)|privilege]], resources, and training to aid popular democracy movements in their struggles.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=161}}

Although he had joined protest marches and organized activist groups, he identifies his primarily political outlet as being that of education, offering free lessons and lectures to encourage wider political consciousness.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=71}} His political writings have covered a wide range of topics, although there are a number of core themes throughout much of his work.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=158}} He is a member of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] international union,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iww.org/en/history/biography |publisher=Industrial Workers of the World |title=IWW Biography |accessdate=May 9, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317022105/http://www.iww.org/history/biography |archivedate=March 17, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sits on the interim consultative committee of the [[International Organization for a Participatory Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iopsociety.org/interim-committee International Organization for a Participatory Society—Interim Committee] Retrieved March 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States foreign policy ===
[[File:Dussel and Chomsky.jpg|thumb|Chomsky and [[Enrique Dussel]], who left Argentina in reaction to the U.S.-backed [[Dirty War]] in the 1970s and 1980s]]
Chomsky has been a prominent critic of U.S. [[imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Milne, Seumas, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/07/noam-chomsky-us-foreign-policy "'US foreign policy is straight out of the mafia'"], ''The Guardian'', November 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His published work has focused heavily on criticizing the actions of the United States,{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=160}} such as the U.S.-backed [[state terror]] campaign against left-wing dissidents across Latin America known as [[Operation Condor]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://chomsky.info/200412__/ On Colombia: Noam Chomsky, introduction to Doug Stokes ''America’s Other War: Terrorizing Colombia'', Zed, December 2004].&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky believes that the basic principle of the [[foreign policy of the United States]] is the establishment of "open societies" that are economically and politically controlled by the U.S. and where U.S.-based businesses can prosper.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=92}} He argues that the U.S. seeks to suppress any movements within these countries that are not compliant with U.S. interests and ensure that U.S.-friendly governments are placed in power.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=159}} When discussing current events, he emphasizes their place within a wider historical perspective.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=160}}
He believes that official, sanctioned historical accounts of U.S. and British imperialism have consistently whitewashed these nations' actions in order to present them as having benevolent motives in either spreading democracy or, in older instances, spreading [[Christianity]]; criticizing these accounts, he seeks to correct them.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=13}} Prominent examples that he regularly cites are the actions of the [[British Empire]] in India and Africa, and the actions of the U.S. in Vietnam, the Philippines, Latin America, and the Middle East.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=13}}

Chomsky explains his decision to focus on criticizing the U.S. over other countries as being because, during his lifetime, the country has militarily and economically dominated the world, and because its [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] electoral system allows for the citizenry to exert an influence on government policy.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=14, 160}} His hope is that, by spreading awareness of the negative impact that imperialism has on the populations affected by it, he can sway the population of the U.S. and other countries into opposing government policies that are imperialist in their nature.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=13}} He urges people to criticize the motivations, decisions, and actions of their governments; to accept responsibility for one's own thoughts and actions; and to apply the same standards to others as one would apply to oneself.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=18}}

He has been critical of U.S. involvement in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israel–Palestine conflict]], arguing that it has consistently blocked a peaceful settlement.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=159}} Chomsky has long endorsed the left binationalist program, seeking to create a democratic state in the [[Levant]] that is home to both Jews and Arabs.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=170|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=76–77|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=159}} However, acknowledging the [[realpolitik]] of the situation, Chomsky has also considered a [[two-state solution]] on the condition that both nation-states exist on equal terms.{{sfnm|1a1=Sperlich|1y=2006|1p=97|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2p=159}} As a result of [[Political positions of Noam Chomsky#Chomsky and the Middle East|his criticisms of Israel]], Chomsky was barred from entering Israel in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/16/israel-noam-chomsky-palestinian-west-bank |title=Noam Chomsky barred by Israelis from lecturing in Palestinian West Bank |last=Pilkington |first=Ed |date=May 16, 2010 |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/world/middleeast/18chomsky.html |title=Israel Roiled After Chomsky Barred From West Bank |last=Bronner |first=Ethan |date=May 17, 2010 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2010/05/201051904343834346.html |title=Israel: Chomsky ban 'big mistake' |publisher=Al Jazeera |access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/5/17/denied_entry_israel_blocks_noam_chomsky |title=Denied Entry: Israel Blocks Noam Chomsky from Entering West Bank to Deliver Speech |publisher=Democracy Now!|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/17/noam-chomsky-denied-entry_0_n_578285.html |title=Noam Chomsky Denied Entry To Israel |date=January 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114172540/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/17/noam-chomsky-denied-entry_0_n_578285.html|archive-date=January 14, 2016|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capitalism and socialism===
[[File:Noam Chomsky, Institute Professor and Emeritus Professor of Linguistics, MIT (14112575810).jpg|thumb|Chomsky speaking at [[Chatham House]], London, May 2014]]
In his youth, Chomsky developed a dislike of [[capitalism]] and the [[selfishness|selfish]] pursuit of material advancement.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=15}} At the same time, he developed a disdain for the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] attempts to establish a socialist society, as represented by the Marxist–Leninist policies of the Soviet Union.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=168|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=16}} Rather than accepting the common view among American economists that a spectrum exists between total state ownership of the economy on the one hand and total private ownership on the other, he instead suggests that a spectrum should be understood between total democratic control of the economy on the one hand and total autocratic control (whether state or private) on the other.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=164–165}} He argues that Western capitalist nations are not really democratic,{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=169}} because, in his view, a truly democratic society is one in which all persons have a say in public economic policy.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=170}} He has stated his opposition to [[Ruling class|ruling elites]], among them institutions like the [[IMF]], [[World Bank]], and [[GATT]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=211}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=Socialism will be achieved only insofar as all social institutions—in particular, the central industrial, commercial, and financial institutions of a modern society—are placed under democratic control in a federal industrial republic of the sort that Russell and others envisioned, with actively functioning workers' councils and other self-governing units in which each citizen, in [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s words, will be "a direct participator in the government of affairs."|source=Noam Chomsky{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=210}} }}

Chomsky highlights that, since the 1970s, the U.S. has become increasingly economically unequal as a result of the repeal of various financial regulations and the rescinding of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods financial control]] agreements.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=14}} He characterizes the U.S. as a ''de facto'' [[one-party state]], viewing both the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] as manifestations of a single "Business Party" controlled by corporate and financial interests.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=14–15}} Chomsky highlights that, within Western capitalist liberal democracies, at least 80% of the population has no control over economic decisions, which are instead in the hands of a management class and ultimately controlled by a small, wealthy elite.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=15}}

Noting that this economic system is firmly entrenched and difficult to overthrow, he believes that change is possible through the organized co-operation of large numbers of people who understand the problem and know how they want to re-organize the economy in a more equitable way.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=15}} Although acknowledging that corporate domination of media and government stifle any significant change to this system, he sees reason for optimism, citing the historical examples of the social rejection of slavery as immoral, the advances in women's rights, and the forcing of government to justify invasions to illustrate how change is possible.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=14}} He views violent revolution to overthrow a government as a last resort to be avoided if possible, citing the example of historical revolutions where the population's welfare has worsened as a result of the upheaval.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=15}}

Chomsky deems libertarian socialist and anarcho-syndicalist ideas to be the inheritors of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]],{{sfnm|1a1=Sperlich|1y=2006|1p=89|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2p=189}} arguing that his ideological position revolves around "nourishing the libertarian and creative character of the human being".{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=95}}
He envisions an anarcho-syndicalist future in which there is direct worker control of the [[means of production]], with society governed by [[workers' council]]s, who would select representatives to meet together at general assemblies.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=199}} In this, he believes that there will be no need for [[political parties]].{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=200}} By controlling their productive life, he believes that individuals can gain job satisfaction, a sense of fulfillment, and purpose to their work.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=197, 202}} He argues that unpleasant and unpopular jobs could be fully automated, carried out by workers who are specially remunerated, or shared among everyone.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=201–202}}

=== News media and propaganda ===
{{Main|Propaganda model}}
Chomsky's political writings have largely been focused on the two concepts of [[ideology]] and [[power (social and political)|power]], or the media and state policy.{{sfn|Rai|1995|p=20}} One of Chomsky's best-known works, ''Manufacturing Consent'', dissects the media's role in reinforcing and acquiescing to state policies across the political spectrum while marginalizing contrary perspectives. Chomsky asserts that this version of censorship, from government-guided "free market" forces, is more subtle and difficult to undermine than the equivalent propaganda system that was present in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Rai|1995|pp=37–38}} As he argues, the mainstream press is corporate owned and thus reflects corporate priorities and interests.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=179}} Although acknowledging that many American journalists are dedicated and well-meaning, he argues that the choice of topics and issues featured in the mass media, the unquestioned premises on which that coverage rests, and the range of opinions that are expressed are all constrained to reinforce the state's ideology.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=178}} He states that, although the mass media will criticize individual politicians and political parties, it will not undermine the wider state-corporate nexus of which it is a part.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=189}} As evidence, he highlights that the U.S. mass media does not employ any socialist journalists or political commentators.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=177}} He also points to examples of important news stories that have been ignored by U.S. mainstream media because reporting on them would reflect badly upon the U.S. state: For instance, it ignored the murder of [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] [[Fred Hampton]] with possible [[FBI]] involvement, the massacres perpetrated in [[Nicaragua]] by the U.S.-funded [[Contras]], and the constant reporting on Israeli deaths while ignoring the far larger number of Palestinian deaths in the conflict between those two nations.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=179–182}}
To remedy this situation, Chomsky calls for grassroots democratic control and involvement of the media.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=184}}

Chomsky considers most [[conspiracy theories]] to be fruitless, distracting substitutes to thinking about  [[policy|policy formation]] in an institutional framework, where individual manipulation is secondary to broader social imperatives.{{sfn|Rai|1995|p=70}} He does not dismiss [[conspiracy theories]] outright, but he does consider them unproductive to challenging [[power (social and political)|power]] in a substantial way.
In response to the labeling of his own thoughts as "conspiracy theory", Chomsky has replied that it is very rational for the media to manipulate information in order to sell it, like any other business. He asks whether [[General Motors]] would be accused of conspiracy if they deliberately selected what they would use or discard to sell their product.{{sfn|Rai|1995|p=42}}

Chomsky endeavors to keep his family life, linguistic scholarship, and political activism strictly separate from one another,{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=158|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=19}} calling himself "scrupulous at keeping my politics out of the classroom".{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=121}} An intensely private person,{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=7}} he is uninterested in appearances and the fame that his work has brought him.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=116}} McGilvray suggested that Chomsky was never motivated by a desire for fame, but that he was impelled to tell what he perceived as the truth and a desire to aid others in doing so.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=230}} He also has little interest in modern art and music.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=206–207}} He reads four or five newspapers daily; in the U.S., he subscribes to ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Financial Times]]'', and ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=121}} He acknowledges that his income and the financial security that it accords him means that he lives a privileged life compared to the majority of the world's population.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=9}} He characterizes himself as a "[[Workforce|worker]]", albeit one who uses his intellect as his employable skill.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=6}}

Despite having been raised Jewish, Chomsky is currently [[Irreligious|non-religious]], although he has expressed approval of forms of religion such as [[liberation theology]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=69}} He is known for his "dry, laconic wit",{{attribution needed|date=July 2018}}{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=199}} and for the use of [[irony]] in his writings,{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=162}} and has attracted controversy for labeling established political and academic figures with terms such as "corrupt", "fascist", and "fraudulent".{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=199}} Chomsky's colleague [[Steven Pinker]] has said that he "portrays people who disagree with him as stupid or evil, using withering scorn in his rhetoric", and that this contributes to the extreme reactions that he generates from his critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jan/20/society.politics |title=The Guardian Profile: Noam Chomsky |last=Jaggi |first=Maya |authorlink=Maya Jaggi |date=January 20, 2001 |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky avoids attending [[academic conferences]], including left-oriented ones such as the Socialist Scholars Conference, preferring to speak to activist groups or hold university seminars for mass audiences.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=169}}

==Reception and influence==

{{Quote box|width=246px|align=right|quote=[Chomsky's] voice is heard in academia beyond linguistics and philosophy: from computer science to neuroscience, from anthropology to education, mathematics and literary criticism. If we include Chomsky's political activism then the boundaries become quite blurred, and it comes as no surprise that Chomsky is increasingly seen as enemy number one by those who inhabit that wide sphere of reactionary discourse and action.|source=Sperlich, 2006{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=60}}}}
Chomsky's legacy is as both a "leader in the field" of linguistics and "a figure of enlightenment and inspiration" for [[political dissent]]ers.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=191}} Despite his academic success, his political viewpoints and activism have resulted in him being distrusted by the mainstream media apparatus, and he is regarded as being "on the outer margin of acceptability."{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=24}}

===In academia===

Linguist John Lyons remarked that within a few decades of publication, Chomskyan linguistics had become "the most dynamic and influential" school of thought in the field.{{sfn|Lyons|1978|p=2}} By the 1970s, his work had also come to exert a considerable influence on philosophy,{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=42}} while a poll conducted by [[Minnesota State University Moorhead|Minnesota State University]] found ''Syntactic Structures'' to be the single most important work in the field of [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Cognitive Science Millennium Project |url=http://web.mnstate.edu/schwartz/cogsci100.htm |publisher=web.mnstate.edu |accessdate=November 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, his work in [[automata theory]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;and the Chomsky hierarchy has become well known in [[computer science]], and he is much cited within the field of [[computational linguistics]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=39}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Michael Sipser |author=Sipser, Michael |year=1997 |title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation |publisher=PWS Publishing |isbn=978-0-534-94728-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Knuth: Selected Papers on Computer Languages |url=http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/cl.html |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky's work contributed substantially to the decline of [[behaviorist psychology]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/behaviorism/ |title=Behaviorism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher= |date= |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |website=plato.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition, some arguments in [[evolutionary psychology]] are derived from his research results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lecture 6: Evolutionary Psychology, Problem Solving, and 'Machiavellian' Intelligence |publisher=Massey University |website=School of Psychology |year=1996 |url=http://evolution.massey.ac.nz/lecture6/lect600.htm |accessdate=September 4, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117055247/http://evolution.massey.ac.nz/lecture6/lect600.htm |archivedate=January 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nim Chimpsky]], a chimpanzee who was the subject of a study in [[animal language acquisition]] at Columbia University, was named after Chomsky in reference to his view of language acquisition as a uniquely human ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gregory |last=Radick |title=The Simian Tongue: The Long Debate about Animal Language |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2007 |page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1984 Nobel Prize laureate in Medicine and Physiology, [[Niels Kaj Jerne]], used Chomsky's generative model to explain the human immune system, equating "components of a generative grammar&amp;nbsp;... with various features of protein structures". The title of Jerne's Stockholm Nobel Lecture was "The Generative Grammar of the Immune System".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1984/jerne-lecture.pdf |title=The Generative Grammar of the Immune System |publisher=Nobel Prize |accessdate=19 August 2013 |author=Niels K.

An MIT press release found that Chomsky was cited within the [[Arts and Humanities Citation Index]] more often than any other living scholar from 1980 to 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chomsky is Citation Champ |publisher=[[MIT]] News Office |date=April 15, 1992 |url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1992/citation-0415.html |accessdate=September 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their respect for his intellectual contribution, a number of linguists and philosophers have been very critical of Chomsky's approach to language. These critics include Christina Behme, Cedric Boeckx, [[Margaret Boden]], Rudolph Botha, [[Vyvyan Evans]], [[Nicholas Evans (linguist)|Nicholas Evans]], [[Daniel Everett]], [[Adele Goldberg (linguist)|Adele Goldberg]], Anna Kinsella, [[Chris Knight (anthropologist)|Chris Knight]], [[Stephen Levinson]], Bruce Nevin, [[Geoffrey K.

Chomsky's approach to academic freedom has led him to give support to MIT academics whose actions he deplores. In 1969, when Chomsky heard that [[Walt Rostow]], a major architect of the Vietnam war, wanted to return to work at MIT, Chomsky threatened "to protest publicly" if Rostow was "denied a position at MIT". Then, in 1989, when Pentagon adviser [[John Deutch]] wanted to be the President of MIT, Chomsky supported his candidacy. Later, when Deutch became head of the CIA, ''The New York Times'' quoted Chomsky as saying, "He has more honesty and integrity than anyone I've ever met.... If somebody's got to be running the C.I.A., I'm glad it's him."&lt;ref&gt;Barsky 1997, pp. 140–141; Noam Chomsky (1996). ''Class Warfare: Interviews with David Barsamian''.

Chomsky biographer Wolfgang B. Sperlich characterizes the linguist and activist as "one of the most notable contemporary champions of the people",{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=7}} while journalist [[John Pilger]] described him as a "genuine people's hero; an inspiration for struggles all over the world for that basic decency known as freedom.

However, Sperlich notes that Chomsky has been vilified by corporate interests, particularly in the mainstream press.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=10}} University departments devoted to history and political science rarely include Chomsky's work on their syllabuses for undergraduate reading.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=153–154}} Critics have argued that despite publishing widely on social and political issues, Chomsky has no expertise in these areas; to this he has responded that such issues are not as complex as many [[social science|social scientists]] claim and that almost everyone is able to comprehend them, regardless of whether they have been academically trained to do so or not.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=161}}

According to McGilvray, many of Chomsky's critics "do not bother quoting his work or quote out of context, distort, and create straw men that cannot be supported by Chomsky's text".{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=161}}

'''Oral gospel traditions''', cultural information passed on from one generation to the next by [[word of mouth]], were the first stage in the formation of the written [[gospels]]. These [[oral tradition]]s included different types of stories about [[Jesus]]. For example, people told anecdotes about Jesus healing the sick and debating with his opponents. The traditions also included sayings attributed to Jesus, such as [[parable]]s and teachings on various subjects which, along with other sayings, formed the oral gospel tradition.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=124}}{{sfn|Dunn|2013|pp=3–5}}

==Critical methods: source and form criticism==
Biblical scholars use a variety of critical methodologies known as [[biblical criticism]]. They apply [[source criticism]] to identify the written sources beneath the canonical gospels. Scholars generally understood that these written sources must have had a prehistory as oral tellings, but the very nature of oral transmission seemed to rule out the possibility of recovering them. However, in the early 20th century the German scholar [[Hermann Gunkel]] demonstrated a new critical method, [[form criticism]], which he believed could discover traces of oral tradition in written texts. Gunkel specialized in [[Old Testament]] studies, but other scholars soon adopted and adapted his methods to the study of the [[New Testament]].{{sfn|Muilenburg|1969|pp=1–18}}

The essence of form criticism is the identification of the ''[[Sitz im Leben]]'', "situation in life", which gave rise to a particular written passage. When form critics discuss oral traditions about Jesus, they theorize about the particular social situation in which different accounts of Jesus were told.{{sfn|Casey|2010|pp=141–3}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|p=84}} For New Testament scholars, this focus remains the [[Second Temple period]]. It needs be remembered that the first century Palestine of Jesus was predominantly an oral society.{{sfn|Dunn|2013|pp=290–1}}

A modern consensus exists that Jesus must be understood as a Jew in a Jewish environment.{{sfn|Van Voorst|2000|p=5}} According to scholar [[Bart D. Ehrman]], Jesus was so very firmly rooted in his own time and place as a first-century Palestinian Jew&amp;nbsp;– with his ancient Jewish comprehension of the world, and God&amp;nbsp;– that he does not translate easily into a modern idiom. Ehrman stresses that Jesus was raised in a Jewish household in the Jewish hamlet of [[Nazareth]]. He was brought up in a Jewish culture, accepted Jewish ways and eventually became a Jewish teacher, who, like other Jewish teachers of his time, debated the [[Law of Moses]] orally.{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|pp=13,86,276}} [[Early Christians]] sustained these teachings of Jesus orally. [[Rabbi]]s or teachers in every generation were raised and trained to deliver this oral tradition accurately. It consisted of two parts: the Jesus tradition (i.e., logia or sayings of Jesus) and inspired opinion. The distinction is one of authority: where the earthly Jesus has spoken on a subject, that word is to be regarded as an instruction or command.{{sfn|Dunn|2013|pp=19,55}}

The accuracy of the oral gospel tradition was insured by the community designating certain learned individuals to bear the main responsibility for retaining the gospel message of Jesus. The prominence of teachers in the earliest communities such as the Jerusalem Church is best explained by the communities' reliance on them as repositories of oral tradition.{{sfn|Dunn|2013|pp=55 &amp; 223 &amp; 309, 279–280}}  One of the most striking features to emerge from recent study is the "amazing consistency" of the history of the tradition "which gave birth to the NT".{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|pp=117}}{{sfn|Dunn|2013|pp=359–60|ps=&amp;nbsp;– "One of the most striking features to emerge from this study is the amazing consistency of the history of the NT tradition, the tradition which gave birth to the NT."}}

A review of [[Richard Bauckham]]'s book ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses: The Gospels as Eyewitness Testimony'' states "The common wisdom in the academy is that stories and sayings of Jesus circulated for decades, undergoing countless retellings and embellishments before being finally set down in writing."&lt;ref name="HahnScott2007"&gt;{{cite book|editor-first1=Scott W.|editor-last1=Hahn|editor-first2=David|editor-last2=Scott|title=Letter &amp; Spirit, Volume 3: The Hermeneutic of Continuity: Christ, Kingdom, and Creation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vJ-fd4hQQJ0C&amp;pg=PA225|date=1 September 2007|publisher=Emmaus Road Publishing|isbn=978-1-931018-46-3|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|You are probably familiar with the old birthday party game "[[Telephone game|telephone]]." A group of kids sits in a circle, the first tells a brief story to the one sitting next to her, who tells it to the next, and to the next, and so on, until it comes back full circle to the one who started it. Invariably, the story has changed so much in the process of retelling that everyone gets a good laugh. Imagine this same activity taking place, not in a solitary living room with ten kids on one afternoon, but over the expanse of the Roman Empire (some 2,500 miles across), with thousands of participants—from different backgrounds, with different concerns, and in different contexts—some of whom have to translate the stories into different languages.|Bart D. Ehrman|''The New Testament. A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings''.&lt;ref&gt;Bart D. Ehrman, The New Testament. A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings, Oxford University Press, 1997, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Oral traditions and the formation of the gospels==
Modern scholars {{who|date=January 2015}} have concluded that the [[Canonical Gospels]] went through four stages in their formation:

# The first stage was oral, and included various stories about Jesus such as healing the sick, or debating with opponents, as well as parables and teachings.
# In the second stage, the oral traditions began to be written down{{by whom|date=August 2014}} in collections (collections of miracles, collections of sayings, etc.), while the oral traditions continued to circulate
# In the third stage, early Christians began combining the written collections and oral traditions into what might be called "proto-gospels" – hence [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]'s reference to the existence of "many" earlier narratives about Jesus
# In the fourth stage, the authors of our four Gospels drew on these proto-gospels, collections, and still-circulating oral traditions to produce the gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], Luke and [[Gospel of John|John]].{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=124}}

Mark, Matthew and Luke are known as the [[Synoptic Gospels]] because they have such a high degree of interdependence. Modern scholars generally agree that Mark was the first of the gospels to be written (see [[Markan priority]]). The author does not seem to have used extensive written sources, but rather to have woven together small collections and individual traditions into a coherent presentation.{{sfn|Telford|2011|pp=13–29}} It is generally, though not universally, agreed that the authors of Matthew and Luke used as sources the gospel of Mark and a collection of sayings called the [[Q source]]. These two together account for the bulk of each of Matthew and Luke, with the remainder made up of smaller amounts of source material unique to each, called the [[M-Source|M source]] for Matthew and the [[L source]] for Luke, which may have been a mix of written and oral material (see [[Two-source hypothesis]]). Most scholars believe that the author of John's gospel used oral and written sources different from those available to the Synoptic authors&amp;nbsp;– a [[Signs Gospel|"signs" source]], a "revelatory discourse" source, and others&amp;nbsp;– although there are indications that a later editor of this gospel may have used Mark and Luke.{{sfn|Scholz|2009|pp=166–8}}

Oral transmission may also be seen as a different approach to understanding the Synoptic Gospels in New Testament scholarship. Current theories attempt to link the three synoptic gospels together through a common textual tradition.  However, many problems arise when linking these three texts together (see the [[Synoptic problem]]). This has led many scholars to hypothesize the existence of a fourth document from which Matthew and Luke drew upon independently of each other (for example, the Q source).{{sfn|Dunn|2003|pp=192–205}} The Oral Transmission hypothesis based on the [[oral tradition]] steps away from this model, proposing instead that this common, shared tradition was transmitted orally rather than through a lost document.{{sfn|Dunn|2003|pp=238–52}}

The '''Proclamation of the Republic''' ({{lang-pt|Proclamação da República do Brasil}}) was a military [[coup d'état]] that established the [[First Brazilian Republic]] on 15 November 1889. It overthrew the [[constitutional monarchy]] of the [[Empire of Brazil]] and ended the reign of [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II]].

The proclamation of the Republic took place in [[Rio de Janeiro]], then capital of the Empire of Brazil, when a group of military officers of the [[Brazilian Army]], led by Marshal [[Deodoro da Fonseca]], staged a coup d'état without the use of violence, deposing Emperor Pedro II and the [[Prime Minister of Brazil|President of the Council of Ministers of the Empire]], the [[Viscount of Ouro Preto]].

A [[provisional government]] was established that same day, 15 November, with Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca as [[President of Brazil|President of the Republic]] and head of the interim Government.

==Background==
{{main article|Apogee of Pedro II of Brazil}}

[[File:Rodrigues-republica-mab.jpg|thumb|"Allegory of the Republic", painting by Manuel Lopes Rodrigues belonging to the collection of the Bahia Art Museum]]
From the 1870s, as a consequence of the [[Paraguayan War]] (also called the War of the Triple Alliance, 1864-1870), the idea of some sectors of the elite was altered to change the current political regime. Factors that influenced this movement:

*The [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II]] had no male children, only daughters. The throne would be occupied, after his death, by his eldest daughter, [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil]], married to a Frenchman, [[Prince Gaston, Count of Eu]], which generated the fear in part of the population that the country was ruled by a foreigner.
*The fact that the negroes helped the army in the Paraguayan War and, when they returned to the country, remained as slaves, that is, they did not gain the freedom of their owners.
*The resentment of the agrarian elite for the abolition of slavery, which they considered to be a personal desire of the [[Brazilian Imperial Family|imperial family]] and not of the people.
*The growth of the [[Positivism|positivist]] and republican idea of [[Auguste Comte]] between the members of the [[Brazilian Army]] and its resentment with the monarchy by delicate military questions.

===Political situation in 1889===

The Imperial Government, through the 37th and last ministerial cabinet, was inaugurated on 7 June 1889, under the command of the [[Prime Minister of Brazil|President of the Council of Ministers of the Empire]], [[Afonso Celso, Viscount of Ouro Preto|Afonso Celso de Assis Figueiredo, the Viscount of Ouro Preto]] of the [[Liberal Party (Brazil)|Liberal Party]], perceiving the difficult political situation in which he was present, presented in a last desperate attempt to save the Empire to the Chamber of Deputies, a program of political reforms which included, among others, the following measures: greater autonomy administrative freedom for the provinces ([[Federation|Federal system]]), universal suffrage, freedom of education, reduction of prerogatives of the Council of State and non-lifelong mandates for the Imperial Senate. The proposals of the Viscount de Ouro Preto aimed at preserving the monarchical regime in the country, but were vetoed by the majority of deputies of conservative tendency that controlled the General Chamber. On 15 November 1889, the republic was proclaimed by the positivist militaries supported by the agrarian elite resented for not being compensated for the abolition of slavery.

===Loss of prestige of the monarchy===
{{main article|Decline and fall of Pedro II of Brazil}}

There were many factors that led the Empire to lose the support of its economic and military bases. On the part of the conservative groups, by the serious friction with the [[Catholic Church]]; by the loss of the political support of the great landowners for the [[Golden Law|abolition of slavery]], which occurred in 1888 without the compensation of the slaveholders.

On the part of the progressive groups, there was the criticism that the monarchy had maintained until very late, the slavery in the country. Progressives also criticized the absence of initiatives aimed at the economic, political or social development of the country, the maintenance of a political regime of caste and census voting, that is, based on the annual income of the people, the absence of a system of universal education, high rates of illiteracy and misery, and the political withdrawal of Brazil from all other countries on the continent, which were republican.

Thus, at the same time that imperial legitimacy declined, the republican proposal - perceived as meaning social progress - gained space. However, it is important to note that the Emperor's legitimacy was distinct from that of the imperial regime: While, on the one hand, the population generally respected and loved Emperor Pedro II, on the other hand, had less and less the Empire. In this sense, it was a common voice at the time that there would be no third reign, that is, the monarchy would not continue to exist after the death of Pedro II, whether due to the lack of political support of the monarchical regime itself or due to public repudiation The prince consort, husband of Princess Isabel, the French Count d'Eu. The Count was known as arrogant, he did not listen well, he spoke with a French accent, and, moreover, he owned slums in Rio, for which he collected exorbitant rents from poor people. It was feared that, when Isabel ascended the throne, he would become the de facto ruler of Brazil.

Although the phrase of Aristides Lobo (journalist and republican leader from [[São Paulo]], later made provisional minister), "The people witnessed bestialized" to the proclamation of the republic, has entered into history, more recent historical research has given another version to the acceptance Of the republic among the Brazilian people. This is the case of the thesis defended by Maria Tereza Chaves de Mello (A República Consentida, FGV Publisher, EDUR, 2007), which indicates that the republic, before and after the proclamation, was popularly seen as a political regime that would bring about development, in a broad sense, to the country, Although the common people did not want to change the regime of government.

==Abolitionist issue==
[[File:Republica no brasil.jpg|thumb|Homage of the Illustrated Magazine to the proclamation of the Brazilian Republic]]
The abolitionist question had been imposed since the abolition of the slave trade in 1850, finding resistance among the country's traditional agrarian elites. In view of the measures adopted by the Empire for the gradual extinction of the slave regime, due to the repercussion of the unsuccessful experience in the [[United States]] of general liberation of the slaves having led that country to [[American Civil War|civil war]], these elites demanded from the State reparations proportional to the total price they had paid by slaves to be liberated by law. These indemnities would be paid with an external loan.

With the enactment of the [[Golden Law]] (1888), and by failing to indemnify these large landowners, the Empire lost its last pillar of support. Called "Republican last minute" or Republican May 13, former slaveholders joined the Republican cause, not because of a sentiment, but as a "revenge" against the monarchy.

In the view of the progressives, the Empire of Brazil was very slow in the solution of the so-called "Servant Question", which undoubtedly undermined its legitimacy over the years. Even the adherence of the former slaveholders, who were not compensated, to the republican cause, shows how much the imperial regime was tied to slavery.

Thus, shortly after Princess Isabel signed the Golden Law, [[João Maurício Vanderlei, Baron of Cotejipe]], the only senator of the empire who voted against the project of abolishing slavery, prophesied: "''His Highness redeemed a race but lost the throne''". Despite this, the republican and black journalist [[José do Patrocínio]] threw himself at the Princess's feet and named her "redeemer".

==Religious issue==

From the [[Colonial Brazil|colonial period]], the Catholic Church, as institution, was submitted to the state. This was maintained after independence and meant, among other things, that no order of the [[Pope]] could be enforced in Brazil without having been previously approved by the [[Emperor of Brazil|Emperor]] (Regal Benefict). In 1872, Vital Maria Gonçalves de Oliveira and Antônio de Macedo Costa, bishops of [[Olinda]] and [[Belém]] respectively, decided to follow on their own the orders of [[Pope Pius IX]], which excluded the [[Freemasons]] from the church. As members of high influence in monarchic Brazil were Freemasons (some books also mention Dom Pedro II himself as Mason), the bull was not ratified.

The bishops refused to obey the law and were arrested. In 1875, thanks to the intervention of the [[Duke of Caxias]], the bishops received imperial pardon and were released. However, in the episode, the image of the Empire was worn next to the Catholic Church. And this was an aggravating factor in the crisis of the monarchy, since the support of the Catholic Church to the monarchy was always essential to its subsistence.

==Military issue==

The military of the Brazilian Army was dissatisfied with the ban imposed by the monarchy, by which its officers could not express themselves in the press without the prior authorization of the [[Ministry of War (Brazil)|Minister of War]]. The military did not have autonomy of decision-making on the defense of the territory, being subject to the orders of the Emperor and the Cabinet of Ministers, formed by civilians, that they surpassed to the orders of the generals. Thus, in the Empire, most war ministers were civilians.

In addition, often the Brazilian Army soldiers felt discredited and disrespected. On the one hand, the rulers of the empire were civilians, whose selection was extremely elitist and whose formation was bachelora, but that resulted in positions highly paid and valued; On the other hand, the military had a more democratic selection and a more technical formation, but did not result in professional valorization or political, social or economic recognition. Military career promotions were hard to come by and were based on personal criteria rather than on merit and seniority promotions.

The Paraguayan War, in addition to spreading republican ideals, showed the military this devaluation of the professional career, which continued and even intensified after the end of the war. The result was the perception, on the part of the military, that they sacrificed themselves for a regime that little considered them and that gave more attention to the [[Imperial Brazilian Navy|Navy of Brazil]]. Simultaneously the military suffered a strong positivist influence that spread to the military schools. They became desirous of a strong republic headed by a dictator.

===Republican and positivist actions===
[[File:A-republica-3-12-1870.jpg|thumb|Cover of the newspaper "A Republica" containing the manifesto]]
During the Paraguayan War, the Brazilian military's contact with the reality of its [[South America]]n neighbors led them to reflect on the relationship between political regimes and social problems. From this, a greater interest for the republican ideal and Brazilian economic and social development began to develop, both among the career military and among the civilians called to fight in the conflict.

Thus, it was no coincidence that Republican propaganda had, by its initial mark, the publication of the [[:pt:Manifesto Republicano|Republican Manifesto]] in 1870 (the year in which the Paraguayan War ended), followed by the [[:pt:Convenção de Itu|Itu Convention]] in 1873 and the emergence of Republican clubs, which Have multiplied, since then, by the main centers in the country.

In addition, various groups were heavily influenced by Freemasonry (Deodoro da Fonseca was a Freemason, as well as his entire ministry) and [[Auguste Comte]]'s [[positivism]], especially after 1881, when the Positivist Church of Brazil emerged. Its directors, Miguel Lemos and Raimundo Teixeira Mendes, initiated a strong abolitionist and republican campaign.

Republican propaganda was carried out by what were later called "historic Republicans" (as opposed to those who became Republicans only after November 15, called "Nov. 16 Republicans").

The ideas of many of the republicans were published by the newspaper The Republic. According to some researchers, Republicans were divided into two main streams:

*The evolutionists, who admitted that the proclamation of the republic was inevitable, not justifying an armed struggle;
*The revolutionists, who defended the possibility of taking up arms to conquer it, with popular mobilization and with social and economic reforms.

Although there were differences between each of these groups as regards the political strategies for the implementation of the republic and also the substantive content of the regime to be established, the general idea common to both groups was that the republic should be a progressive, opposed to the "exhausted" monarchy. Thus, the proposal of the new regime was of a revolutionary social character and not only of a mere exchange of rulers.

==Military coup of November 15, 1889==
[[File:Republica1889.jpg|thumb|left|Marshall Deodoro da Fonseca]]

In Rio de Janeiro, Republicans insisted that Marshal [[Deodoro da Fonseca]], a monarchist, head the revolutionary movement that would replace the monarchy with the republic.

After much insistence from the revolutionaries, Deodoro da Fonseca agreed to lead the military movement.

According to historical accounts, on November 15, 1889, commanding a few hundred soldiers moving through the streets of Rio de Janeiro, Marshal Deodoro, as well as a large part of the military, intended only to overthrow the then Chief of the Imperial Cabinet (equivalent To the Prime Minister), the Viscount of Ouro Preto. "The main culprits of all this [the proclamation of the Republic] are Count of Eu and the Viscount of Ouro Preto: the last to persecute the Army and the first to consent to this persecution," Deodoro later wrote.&lt;ref name=JA&gt;[http://www.jornaldosamigos.com.br/historia.htm What really happened in the Proclamation of the Republic]. By Paulo Gomes Lacerda&lt;/ref&gt;

The military coup, which was scheduled for November 20, 1889, had to be anticipated. On the 14th, the conspirators issued a rumor that the government had arrested [[Benjamin Constant Botelho de Magalhães]] and Deodoro da Fonseca. Later it was confirmed that it was even rumor. Thus, the revolutionaries anticipated the coup, and in the early hours of November 15, Deodoro was willing to lead the movement of army troops that put an end to the monarchist regime in Brazil.

The conspirators went to the residence of Marshal Deodoro, who was sick with [[Shortness of breath|dyspnea]], and they finally convinced him to lead the movement. Apparently decisive for Deodoro was to know that, as of November 20, the new President of the Council of Ministers of the Empire would be Silveira Martins, an old rival. Deodoro and Silveira Martins had been enemies since the time when the marshal had served in [[Rio Grande do Sul]], when both fought for the attention of the Baroness of Triunfo, a very beautiful and elegant widow who, according to the reports of the time, had preferred Silveira Martins. Since then, Silveira Martins did not miss an opportunity to provoke Deodoro from the Senate floor, insinuating that he misused funds and even challenging its effectiveness as a military.

In addition, Major Frederico Solon de Sampaio Ribeiro had told Deodoro that an alleged arrest warrant had been issued against him, a false argument that finally convinced the old marshal to proclaim the Republic on the 16th and to exile the Imperial Family by night, in order to avoid an eventual popular commotion.

[[File:Attentat contre le Baron de Ladario, ancien ministre de la marine. — (Dessin de M. Parys.).jpg|thumb|Attempt against the Baron of Ladário, then Minister of the Navy]]

Convinced that he would be arrested by the imperial government, Deodoro left his residence at dawn on November 15, crossed the [[Campo de Santana]], and on the other side of the park called the soldiers of the battalion there, where the Duke de Caxias Palace is now located, to rebel against the government. They offer a horse to the marshal, who rode on it, and, according to testimony, took off his hat and proclaimed "Long live the Republic!" Then he alighted, crossed the park again, and returned to his residence. The demonstration continued with a parade of troops on Direita street until the Imperial Palace. Recent studies indicate that Marshal Deodoro shouted "Long live His Majesty the Emperor!" however, for until then he was convinced to testify to the cabinet, not to proclaim the republic, and only did so when it was falsely told that his rival would take the Position.

The rioters occupied the headquarters of Rio de Janeiro and then the Ministry of War. They deposed the Cabinet and arrested their president, Afonso Celso de Assis Figueiredo, Viscount Ouro Preto.

In the Imperial Palace, Viscount de Ouro Preto, the president of the cabinet (prime minister), had been trying to resist asking the commander of the local detachment and responsible for the security of the Imperial Palace, General [[Floriano Peixoto]], to confront the mutineers, explaining to General Floriano Peixoto that there were enough legalist troops on the scene to defeat the rioters. The Viscount of Ouro Preto reminded Floriano Peixoto that he had faced much more numerous troops in the Paraguayan War. However, General Floriano Peixoto refused to obey the orders given by the Viscount of Ouro Preto and thus justified his insubordination, responding to the Viscount of Ouro Preto:

{{quote|Yes, but there (in Paraguay) we had enemies in front and here we are all Brazilians!|Floriano Peixoto&lt;ref&gt;OURO PRETO, Visconde de, ''Advento da ditadura militar no Brasil'', Imprimiere F. Pichon, Paris, 1891&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Then, adhering to the republican movement, Floriano Peixoto gave a prison sentence to the head of government.

The only one wounded in the episode of the proclamation of the republic was the Baron of Ladario, minister of navy, who resisted the arrest warrant given by the mutineers and was shot. It is said that Deodoro did not address criticism of the Emperor Pedro II and that he hesitated in his words. Despite this, it was known that Deodoro da Fonseca was with Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Constant at his side and that there were some civilian republican leaders at that time. But Deodoro favored the republic only after the death of the Emperor: "I would like to carry the coffin of the Emperor," he said.

On the afternoon of November 15, at the City Hall of Rio de Janeiro, the Republic was solemnly proclaimed.

At night, in the Municipal Council of the Neutral Municipality, Rio de Janeiro, José do Patrocínio drafted the official proclamation of the [[First Brazilian Republic|Republic of the United States of Brazil]], approved without a vote. The text went to the newspaper charts that supported the cause, and, only the next day, November 16, was announced to the people the change of the political regime of Brazil.

[[File:La Revolution au Brésil. — Débarquement de Dom Pedro, a Lisbonne. — Le canot impérial abordant a l'Arsenal de la Marine.jpg|thumb|Disembarkation of Emperor Pedro II in [[Lisbon]]: the imperial canoe docks at the Navy Arsenal]]

Pedro II, who was in [[Petrópolis]], returned to Rio de Janeiro. Thinking that the aim of the revolutionaries was only to replace the office of Ouro Preto, the Emperor still tried to organize another ministerial cabinet, under the chairmanship of the councilor [[José Antônio Saraiva]]. The Emperor, in Petropolis, was informed and decided to go down to the Court. Upon learning of the coup, the Emperor acknowledged the fall of the Ouro Preto Cabinet and sought to announce a new name to replace the Viscount of Ouro Preto. However, since nothing had been said about Republic until then, the most exalted Republicans spread the rumor that the Emperor had chosen Gaspar Silveira Martins, political enemy of Deodoro da Fonseca since Rio Grande do Sul, to be the new head of government. Deodoro da Fonseca then persuaded himself to join the Republican cause. The Emperor was informed of this and, disillusioned, decided not to offer resistance.

{{Cquote|text=If it is so, it will be my retirement. I have worked too hard and I am tired. I will go rest then.|author=Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil|source=}}

The next day, Major Frederico Solon de Sampaio Ribeiro gave Pedro II a communication, informing him of the proclamation of the republic and ordering his departure for [[Europe]], in order to avoid political upheavals. The [[Brazilian Imperial Family]] was exiled in Europe, only being allowed to return to Brazil in 1920 by President [[Epitácio Pessoa]].&lt;ref name="Janotti"/&gt;

Despite the lack of any will to resist from Pedro II, there was significant monarchist reaction after the fall of the Empire, which was thoroughly repressed.{{sfn|Salles|1996|p=194}} A few examples can be given. On 17 November 1889, upon hearing the news of the Emperor's fall, the 25th Infantry Battalion resisted by attacking the local Republican Club in Desterro (present-day [[Florianópolis]]). They were defeated by Republican militias and policemen and several were killed. Others were executed. According to the source, other battalions across the country also unsuccessfully fought against policemen and militias loyal to the Republic.&lt;ref name=Janotti&gt;Mônaco Janotti, Maria de Lourdes (1986).

In 1891 happened in Rio de Janeiro the so-called [[Revolta da Armada]], a rebellion movement promoted by units of the [[Brazilian Navy]] against the dictatorial government of Deodoro da Fonseca, supposedly supported by the monarchist opposition to the recent installation of the republic, in which the navy threatened to bomb the federal capital.&lt;ref name=Smallman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Smith; ''Brazil and the United States: Convergence and Divergence'' [[University of Georgia]] Press 2010, page 38, 2nd paragraph&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy, still resented by circumstances and outcomes of the coup that had put an end to the monarchy in Brazil.&lt;ref name=Smallman&gt;Smallman; Shall C.

The [[War of Canudos]]  was a conflict between the state of Brazil and a group of some 30,000 settlers who had founded their own community in the Northeastern state of Bahia, named Canudos. After a number of unsuccessful attempts at military suppression, it came to a brutal end in October 1897, when a large Brazilian army force overran the village and killed nearly all the inhabitants. This was the deadliest civil war in Brazilian history.&lt;ref name=Bueno/&gt;&lt;ref name=Janotti/&gt; The community of [[Canudos]] was led by [[Antonio Conselheiro]], in the interior of the state of [[Bahia]] against the great farmers supported by the Republican army.

Only 300 survived the massacre caused by Republican Army troops in 1897&lt;ref name=Bueno/&gt; As a matter of comparison, the [[Brazilian military government|1964–1985 Military dictatorship]] led to the death of 380 people&lt;ref&gt;Narloch, Leandro (2009).

An event little known, but very interesting was the Revolt of Ribeirãozinho. Also called the Ribeirãozinho Revolution, it was a conservative movement of the early twentieth century that occurred in the city of Ribeirãozinho (now [[Taquaritinga]]), in [[São Paulo]], and whose fundamental objective was the restoration of the monarchy and the coronation of [[Prince Luiz of Orléans-Braganza (1878-1920)|Prince Luiz of Orléans-Braganza]], son of [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil]]. Unhappy with the [[First Brazilian Republic]], the São Paulo monarchists had planned an uprising that was supposed to take place on August 23, 1902, and which was to topple then President [[Campos Sales]]. In fact, the uprising had only been carried out in Ribeirãozinho and Espírito Santo do Pinhal, a neighboring town. This attempt to restore the monarchy lasted one day.&lt;ref name=Ribeirãozinho&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.taquaritingaonline.com.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=133:deadly-typhoon-hits-philippines&amp;catid=16:historia&amp;Itemid=33|title = The Revolt of Ribeirãozinho and the return of the monarchy|publisher=Taquaritinga On-line|date=2008-06-21 |accessdate=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
[[File:Flag of Brazil (November 1889).svg|thumb|First republican flag, adopted by 4 days by the provisional government, proposed by [[Ruy Barbosa]]. An Imitation of the American Flag]]
It is possible to challenge the legitimacy of the republic in Brazil from different angles.

From the point of view of the [[:pt:Código Criminal do Império fo Brasil|Criminal Code of the Empire of Brazil]], sanctioned on December 16, 1830, the crime committed by the Republicans was:

"Article 87: To try directly and by deeds to dethrone the Emperor, to deprive him of all or part of his constitutional authority, or to alter the legitimate order of succession, and imprisonment for five to fifteen years. Crime to be consummated: Fees of life imprisonment with work in the maximum degree, imprisonment with work for twenty years in the middle, and for a minimum of ten years.
[[File:Constituição da República dos Estados Unidos do Brasil de 1891 p. 00 (capa).jpg|thumb|First Brazilian republican constitution]]
The Viscount of Ouro Preto, deposed on November 15, understood that the proclamation of the republic had been a mistake and that the reign of Pedro II had been good, and this was expressed in his book "Advent of the Military Dictatorship in Brazil":

{{Cquote|text=The Empire was not the ruin. It was conservation and progress. For half a century, it maintained intact, tranquil and united colossal territory. The Empire converted a backward and little populous country into great and strong nationality, the first South American power, considered and respected throughout the civilized world. To the efforts of the Empire, mainly, three neighbors owed the disappearance of the most cruel and demeaning despotism. The Empire effectively abolished the death penalty, extinguished slavery, gave Brazil immortal glories, internal peace, order, security, and, more than anything else, individual liberty as there has never been in any country. What are the faults or crimes of Dom Pedro II, who in almost fifty years of his reign never persecuted anyone, never remembered an ingratitude, never avenged an injury, ready always to forgive, forget and benefit? What errors have been made that made him worthy of deposition and exile when, old and sick, he ought to count on the respect and veneration of his fellow citizens? The Brazilian republic, as proclaimed, is a work of iniquity. The republic has risen on the corsets of the mutinous soldiery, comes from a criminal origin, was carried out by means of an attack unprecedented in history and will have an ephemeral existence!|author=Viscount of Ouro Preto|source=}}

The movement of November 15, 1889 was not the first to seek the republic, although it was the only truly successful one, and according to some versions it would have had the support of both national and regional elites:

*In 1788-1789, the conspiracy called [[Inconfidência Mineira]] sought not only independence but also the proclamation of a republic in the Captaincy of [[Minas Gerais]], followed by a series of political, economic and social reforms;
*In 1817, through the [[Pernambucan revolt]] - the only separatist movement of the colonial period that surpassed the conspiratorial phase and reached the revolutionary process of seizure of power - [[Pernambuco]] had provisional government for 75 days;
*In 1824, Pernambuco and other Northeastern states (territories that formerly belonged to that province) created the pro-independence movement known as the Republican Equatorial [[Confederation of the Equator]], considered the main reaction against the authoritarian tendency and centralizing policy of [[Pedro I of Brazil|Emperor Pedro I]]'s government; 
*In 1839, in the wake of the [[Ragamuffin War]], the [[Riograndense Republic]] and the [[Juliana Republic]] were proclaimed respectively in Rio Grande do Sul and [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]].

Although there was no popular participation in the movement that ended with the monarchist regime and implanted the republic, there  were also no popular demonstrations of support for the monarchy or repudiation of the new regime, although there was clear adoration and commotion toward the Emperor who was beloved and admired even by the republicans. The people seemed indifferent to the political course of the nation.

[[File:CF - 1891 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Swearing in of Deodoro and Floriano as first President and Vice-President]]

Some researchers argue that, if the monarchy were popular, there would be moves against the republic then beyond the [[Canudos War]] and the [[Revolta da Armada]]. However, according to other researchers, what would have happened was a growing awareness about the new regime and the indifference by the most different sectors of Brazilian society. An opposing version is given by the researcher, Maria de Lourdes Monaco Janoti, in the book "''Os Subversivos da República''", in which she recounts the fear that the Republicans had in the first decades of the republic, regarding a possible restoration of the [[monarchy]] in Brazil. Maria Janoti also shows in her book the strong Republican repression of any attempt to organize monarchist political groups at that time.

In relation to the lack of popular participation in the November 15 movement, a document that had great repercussions was the article by Aristides Lobo, who was an eyewitness to the proclamation of the Republic, in the Popular ''Diário de São Paulo'', on November 18, in which Said:

{{Cquote|text=For now, the color of government is purely military and should be so. The fact was theirs, of them only because the collaboration of the civil element was almost null. The people watched it all bestialized, astonished, without knowing what it meant. Many seriously believed to be seeing a parade!|author=Aristides lobo|source=}}

At the meeting at the house of Deodoro, on the night of November 15, 1889, it was decided that a popular referendum would be held, so that the Brazilian people would vote for the republic, or not. However, this plebiscite only occurred 104 years later, as determined by article two of the Transitional Constitutional Provisions Act of 1988.

The 1979 Kenyan census reported this group had 1,824 persons, but Günther Schlee believes this number "is definitely too low". The 1969 census gave 4,369 as their number, and the apparent decrease is not due to biological factors. Because of their language and their inter-locking settlements, many Sakuye must have given '[[Borana people|Boran]]' when asked for their 'tribe'. The Sakuye have been weakened by recent events, and to identify oneself as a Sakuye no longer sounds attractive."&lt;ref&gt;Schlee, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1159837 "Interethnic Clan Identities among Cushitic-Speaking Pastoralists", ''Africa''], 55 (1985),p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ethnologue]], Sakuye is a dialect of the [[Borana language]], though it has some significant differences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=gax Oromo, Borana-Arsi-Guji], ''[[Ethnologue]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Their name comes from the name of one of the traditional divisions of Borana territory, Saaku, which is the area north of [[Marsabit]]. Thus, Saaku-ye means "from Saaku" or "of Saaku" in [[Borana language|Afaan Booranaa]]. When a group of [[Rendille people|Rendille]] moved north from Marsabit, their [[Borana people|Borana]] neighbors referred to them as the "Saakuye".&lt;ref name="nj"&gt;[http://dickinsg.intrasun.tcnj.edu/nations/kenya/sakuye.html "The Sakuye of Kenya"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004220053/http://dickinsg.intrasun.tcnj.edu/nations/kenya/sakuye.html |date=2007-10-04 }}, [[The College of New Jersey]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Sakuye adopted [[Islam]] in the early twentieth century. Following [[Kenyan independence]], the Sakuye joined the [[Somalis in Kenya]] in their attempt to secede and join the [[Somali Republic]]. Most of their livestock was killed by government forces during the [[Shifta War]] (1963-7), reducing many Sakuye to poverty. In the 1970s, a group of Sakuye moved to the [[Dabel hills]], which lie below the Ethiopian plateau. The traditional [[camel]]-oriented rituals, with a nominal Muslim affiliation, became much less important after the destruction of the herds and the Sakuye became [[Husayniyya]], followers of the [[Sufi]] order founded by [[Sheikh Hussein (person)|Sheikh Hussein]] whose tomb lies in the [[Sheikh Hussein|village named for him]] in [[Bale Province, Ethiopia|Bale, Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;Günther Schlee, [http://www.eth.mpg.de/people/schlee/sudan01/pdf/anhang2.pdf Kinds of Islam and policies of inclusion and exclusion: Some comparative perspectives from the Sudan and beyond] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609191536/http://www.eth.mpg.de/people/schlee/sudan01/pdf/anhang2.pdf |date=2007-06-09 }}, Zum Abschlussbericht zum Projekt "Ethnizitäten in neuen Kontexten" für die Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Projekt Nr.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7705">'''Second language writing''' is the study of [[writing]] performed by non-native speakers/writers of a language as [[second language|a second]] or [[foreign language]].

In addition to disseminating research through the [[Journal of Second Language Writing]], scholars in the field regularly participate in three academic conferences, the Symposium on Second Language Writing,&lt;ref&gt;Grabe, William (2001). "Notes toward a theory of second language writing." In [[Paul Kei Matsuda|P.K. Matsuda]] &amp; T Silva (eds.) ''On second language writing'', 39-57.&lt;/ref&gt; the TESOL convention,&lt;ref&gt;Cumming, Alister (April 1987). "Decision making and text representation in ESL writing performance." Paper presented at the 21st Annual TESOL Convention, Miami.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Conference on College Composition and [[Communication]].&lt;ref name=Faber&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Faber|first1=Brenton|title=Rhetoric in Competition The Formation of Organizational Discourse in Conference on College Composition and Communication Abstracts|journal=Written Communication|date=July 1996|volume=13|issue=3|page=355-384|doi=10.1177/0741088396013003003|url=http://wcx.sagepub.com/content/13/3/355.short|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symposium on Second Language Writing==
The Symposium on Second Language Writing, which began in 1998 at [[Purdue University]], is an international conference on second language writing. It was a biennial event through 2006, and annually after that.  It  has been hosted at Purdue University six times, but  the 2007 symposium was held in Japan; the 2009 at [[Arizona State University]], the 2010 in [[Murcia]], Spain; the 2011 in [[Taipei]], Taiwan; and the 2013 will be held at [[Shandong University]], [[Jinan]], China.&lt;ref&gt;Symposium on Second Language Writing. (n.d.). Retrieved October 5, 2008, from http://sslw.asu.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Language Writing at TESOL, Inc.==
In June 2005, the TESOL Board added of a new interest section on writing. The '''Second Language Writing IS'''; it held its first meeting in [[Tampa]] in March 2006,  covering topics ranging from “Broadening Perspectives in Second Language Writing” and “Alternative Placement Methods for Second Language Writers” to “Issues in Technologies for L2 Composition Classrooms” and “Crossing Bridges with Second Language Writing Partnerships.”

As these suggest, the section provides a forum for researchers and educators at different [[Educational stage|grade]] levels and institutional settings to discuss  second language writing. Specifically, the section's goals are:

* to increase awareness of the significance of writing in teaching [[ESL]]/EFL,
* to encourage and support the teaching of writing to [[English for Speakers of Other Languages|ESOL]] students at all levels,
* to provide a forum to discuss issues of writing [[Educational assessment|assessment]] and the placement of second language writers, and
* to disseminate and promote research on second language writing  &lt;ref&gt;Second Language Writing Interest Section. (n.d.). Retrieved October 5, 2008, from http://secondlanguagewriting.com/slwis/&lt;/ref&gt;

The section facilitates communication about writing across teaching levels and settings. Recent research on the scope of second language writing scholarship suggests that most of the field’s nationally (within the U.S.) and internationally circulated scholarship is produced by scholars in post-secondary education at research intensive institutions. Other contexts for writing (Pre-K through 12, two-year colleges, community programs, international [[K-12]] schools, etc.) often have much larger populations of ELL/EFL writers, but scholars, particularly teacher-researchers, in these settings do not often receive support for researching and writing.

Given this, the section provides scholars with the opportunity to initiate more research and scholarship in these underrepresented contexts by supporting new collaborations and partnerships across levels and by providing a forum for discussing shared experiences. The section, like its parent body,  TESOL, is distinctive in including all the academic levels and areas.

==Second Language Writing at CCCC==
Second language writing scholars also participate in a Special Interest Group on the field at CCCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conference on College Composition and Communication|url=http://www.ncte.org/cccc|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the organization has a Committee on Second Language Writing   to bridge work between CCCC and TESOL to involve more scholars in the field’s discussions.

Much recent attention focuses on the potential of [[Computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) to foster desire and opportunity to write.

In addition, attention has been focused on the practical application of teaching Second Language writing not only in academia but in the field. 

==Perspectives and theories==
Second language writing development has been investigated from many different perspectives. [[Rosa Manchón|Manchón]]'s edited book on ''L2 Writing Development: Multiple Perspectives'' provides an insight in which perspective second language writing development can be investigated. Her edited books includes studies on L2 writing development from [[Dynamic approach to second language development|Dynamic Systems Theory]], [[Goal Theory]], Genre-based [[Systemic functional linguistics]], and Rhetorical genre theory.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.degruyter.com/view/product/44165&lt;/ref&gt;

Second language writing development has been most extensively investigated by traditional [[cross-sectional]] methodologies such as pre-test post-test designs.

However, in the early 2000s a novel angle has emerged called [[Dynamical systems theory]] approach on [[Second language development]]. Studies adopting the DST perspective explore interactions between different constructs such as lexicon, syntax, and accuracy by using moving correlations. The degree of variability in the constructs is usually explored by min-max graphs, data resampling and Monte Carlo Analysis. Among the researchers who have adopted this new angle are [[Marjolijn Verspoor|Verspoor]], [[Cornelis de Bot|de Bot]], and [[Wander Lowie|Lowie]]. These researchers used a [[time-series]] data to investiagte development in second language writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/publications/dynamic-systems-theory-and-variation-a-case-study-in-l2writing(fe120ba4-defa-4577-b34b-daf6ff7fbb76).html|title=Dynamic systems theory and variation: a case study in L2-writing|date=2004|publisher=Amsterdam: Free University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MIT Press.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616133508/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=10486 |date=2012-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Souza | first1 = C.S. | year = 2005 | title = Semiotic engineering: bringing designers and users together at interaction time | url = | journal = Interacting with Computers | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 317–341 | doi = 10.1016/j.intcom.2005.01.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotic Engineering views HCI as [[computer-mediated communication]] between designers and users at interaction time. The system speaks for its designers in various types of conversations specified at design time. These conversations communicate the designers' understanding of who the users are, what they know the users want or need to do, in which preferred ways, and why. The designers' message to users includes even the interactive language in which users will have to communicate back with the system in order to achieve their specific goals. So, the process is in fact one of communication about communication, or metacommunication.

Semiotic engineering has two methods to evaluate the quality of metacommunication in HCI: the semiotic inspection method (SIM) and the communicability evaluation method (CEM). In the 2009 book ''Semiotic Engineering Methods for Scientific Research in HCI'', Clarisse de Souza and Carla Leitão discuss how SIM and CEM, which are both qualitative methods, can also be used in scientific contexts to generate new knowledge about HCI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00173ED1V01Y200901HCI002 de Souza, C.S.; Leitão, C.F. (2009) Semiotic Engineering Methods for Scientific Research in HCI. Morgan Claypool.]&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate their points, the authors present an extensive case study with a free open-source digital audio editor called Audacity. They show how the results obtained with a triangulation of SIM and CEM point at new research avenues not only for semiotic engineering and HCI but also for other areas of computer science such as software engineering and programming.

René Jorna and Clarisse de Souza independently developed two different kinds of ‘semiotic engineering.’ Jorna’s was originally closer to [[Artificial Intelligence]] and [[Cognitive Science]]. His ideas were later developed and applied to decision support systems and organizational semiotics rather than HCI. The authors were introduced to each other (and to each other's version of 'semiotic engineering') only in 1996, in a [[Dagstuhl#Seminar series|Dagstuhl Seminar]] on Informatics and Semiotics organized by Peter B. Andersen, [[Mihai Nadin]] and [[Frieder Nake]].

A '''stenomask''' is a hand-held [[microphone]] built into a padded, sound-proof enclosure that fits over the speaker's mouth or nose and mouth.  Some lightweight versions may be fitted with an elastic neck strap to hold them in place while freeing the user's hands for other tasks.  The purpose of a stenomask is to allow a person to speak without being heard by other people, and to keep background noise away from the microphone. 

A stenomask is useful for [[speech recognition]] applications, because it allows voice [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] in noisy environments.   Perhaps more importantly, a stenomask silences the user's voice so that it does not interfere with the surrounding environment such as a court or a classroom.  The user can verbally identify the speaker, indicate gestures and unspoken answers, and describe activities as they take place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nvra.affiniscape.com/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=9 Voice Writing: The Method] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704130646/http://nvra.affiniscape.com/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=9 |date=2007-07-04 }}, ''National Verbatim Reporters Assoc'', retrieved 13 Mar 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

An operator of a stenomask can be trained to "re-voice" everything he or she hears into a stenomask connected to a speech recognition system, for a real-time text transcription of everything spoken.  This allows a "[[voice writer]]" to produce instant text feeds within a courtroom and distribute them in [[plain text]] format immediately after a proceeding.  The equipment can also interface with [[Legal_case_management#Case_management_software|litigation management software]].

A trained operator using a stenomask connected to a pre-trained speech recognition system can exceed 180 words per minute while at the same time exceeding 95 percent accuracy.  They may also modify the pronunciation of the words they are speaking in order to improve accuracy.

Microphones that work much like a stenomask are used by aircraft ground crews to communicate with cockpit crews in airport environments with extreme engine noise, and are usually part of their [[Headset (audio)|headsets]].

==History==
The stenomask was developed by [[Horace Webb]] and two colleagues in the early 1940s.  He was proficient with Gregg [[shorthand]], but sought a more accurate and faster system of transcription, as shorthand notes can become unmanageable with fast talkers or difficult terminology.  Furthermore, until recently, shorthand reporters would verbally dictate transcription notes into typewritten form, resulting in about two hours dictation for every hour transcribing.

Thus, Webb thought he could "repeat it with my voice instead of with a pen". After much experimentation&amp;nbsp;— first with a cigar box and then a tomato juice can&amp;nbsp;— he arrived at a solution using a microphone inside a military aviator's rubber [[Oxygen_mask#Oxygen_masks_for_aviators|oxygen mask]], paired with a coffee pot filled with [[sound baffle|sound-absorbing material]].  The result was eventually deemed by the [[United States Navy]] to be the most accurate method of transcription among "all known systems of verbatim reporting", and was subsequently adopted for use in their court reporting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nvra.affiniscape.com/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=10 The Horace Webb Story] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704130338/http://nvra.affiniscape.com/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=10 |date=2007-07-04 }}, ''National Verbatim Reporters Assoc'', retrieved 13 Mar 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Taxonomic Rank Graph.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.7|The major ranks: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species, applied to the [[red fox]], ''Vulpes vulpes''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.123rf.com /clipart-vector/vulpes_vulpes.html&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Biological classification}}
In [[biological classification]], '''taxonomic rank''' is the relative level of a group of organisms (a [[taxon]]) in a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] [[hierarchy]]. Examples of taxonomic ranks are [[species]], [[genus]], [[family (biology)|family]], [[order (biology)|order]], [[class (biology)|class]], [[phylum (biology)|phylum]], [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], [[domain (biology)|domain]], etc.

A given rank subsumes under it less general categories, that is, more specific descriptions of life forms. Above it, each rank is classified within more general categories of organisms and groups of organisms related to each other through inheritance of [[phenotypic trait|traits]] or features from common ancestors. The rank of any ''species'' and the description of its ''genus'' is ''basic''; which means that to identify a particular organism, it is usually not necessary to specify ranks other than these first two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art2 |at=Articles 2 and 3 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants – Melbourne Code |date=2012 |website=IAPT-Taxon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider a particular species, the [[red fox]], ''Vulpes vulpes'': the next rank above, the genus ''[[Vulpes]]'', comprises all the "true" foxes. Their closest relatives are in the immediately higher rank, the family [[Canidae]], which includes dogs, wolves, jackals, and all foxes; the next higher rank, the order [[Carnivora]], includes [[Caniformia|caniforms]] (bears, seals, weasels, skunks, raccoons and all those mentioned above), and [[Feliformia|feliforms]] (cats, civets, hyenas, mongooses). Carnivorans are one group of the hairy, warm-blooded, nursing members of the class [[Mammalia]], which are classified among animals with backbones in the phylum [[Chordata]], and with them among all animals in the kingdom [[Animalia]]. Finally, at the highest rank all of these are grouped together with all other organisms possessing [[cell nuclei]] in the domain [[Eukarya]].

The ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' defines ''rank'' as: "The level, for nomenclatural purposes, of a [[taxon]] in a taxonomic hierarchy (e.g. all families are for nomenclatural purposes at the same rank, which lies between superfamily and subfamily)."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |year=1999 |title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Fourth Edition |publisher=International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature |url=http://iczn.org/iczn/index.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main ranks ==
In his landmark publications, such as the ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', [[Carl Linnaeus]] used a ranking scale limited to: kingdom, class, order, genus, species, and one rank below species. Today, nomenclature is regulated by the [[nomenclature codes]]. There are seven main taxonomic ranks: kingdom, phylum or division, class, order, family, genus, species. In addition, ''domain'' (proposed by [[Carl Woese]]) is now widely used as a fundamental rank, although it is not mentioned in any of the nomenclature codes, and is a synonym for dominion (lat. dominium), introduced by Moore in 1974.&lt;ref name=Moore1974&gt; {{Cite journal |last=Moore |first=R.

A taxon is usually assigned a rank when it is given its formal name. The basic ranks are species and genus. When an organism is given a species name it is assigned to a genus, and the genus name is part of the species name.

The species name is also called a [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]], that is, a two-term name. For example, the zoological name for the human species is ''Homo sapiens''. This is usually italicized in print and underlined when italics are not available. In this case, ''Homo'' is the generic name and it is capitalized; ''sapiens'' indicates the species and it is not capitalized.

==Ranks in zoology==
There are definitions of the following taxonomic ranks in the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]: superfamily, family, subfamily, tribe, subtribe, genus, subgenus, species, subspecies.

The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature divides names into "family-group names", "genus-group names" and "species-group names". The Code explicitly mentions the following ranks for these categories:

----
:Superfamily

''[[Family (biology)|Family]]''
:[[Subfamily]]
:[[Tribe (biology)|Tribe]]
:[[Subtribe]]

----

''[[Genus]]''
:[[Subgenus]]

----
''[[Species]]''
:[[Subspecies]]

----

The rules in the Code apply to the ranks of superfamily to subspecies, and only to some extent to those above the rank of superfamily. Among "genus-group names" and "species-group names" no further ranks are officially allowed. Zoologists sometimes use additional terms such as ''species group'', ''species subgroup'', ''species complex'' and ''superspecies'' for convenience as extra, but unofficial, ranks between the subgenus and species levels in [[taxa]] with many species, e.g. the genus ''[[Drosophila]]''. (Note the potentially confusing use of "species group" as both a category of ranks as well as an unofficial rank itself.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}})

At higher ranks (family and above) a lower level may be denoted by adding the prefix "''infra''", meaning ''lower'', to the rank.  For example, ''infra''order (below suborder) or ''infra''family (below subfamily).

===Names of zoological taxa===
* A taxon above the rank of species has a scientific name in one part (a uninominal name).
* A species has a name composed of two parts (a binomial name or [[binomen]]): [[name of a biological genus|generic name]] + [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]]; for example ''Canis lupus''.
* A subspecies has a name composed of three parts (a trinomial name or [[trinomen]]): generic name + specific name + [[subspecific name]]; for example ''Canis lupus familiaris''. As there is only one possible rank below that of species, no connecting term to indicate rank is needed or used.

==Ranks in botany==
According to Art 3.1 of the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN) the most important ranks of taxa are: kingdom, division or phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. According to Art 4.1 the secondary ranks of taxa are tribe, section, series, variety and form. There is an indeterminate number of ranks. The ICN explicitly mentions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art3 |at=Articles 3 and 4 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants – Melbourne Code |date=2012 |website=IAPT-Taxon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

----
'''''primary ranks'''''
:'''''secondary ranks'''''
::'''''further ranks'''''

----
'''''kingdom''''' (''regnum'')
::''subregnum''

'''''division''''' or '''phylum''' (''divisio'', ''phylum'')
::''subdivisio'' or ''subphylum''

'''''class''''' (''classis'')
::''subclassis''

'''''order''''' (''ordo'')
::''subordo''

----
'''''family''''' (''familia'')
::''subfamilia''
:'''tribe''' (''tribus'')
::''subtribus''

'''''genus''''' (''genus'')
::''subgenus''
:'''section''' (''sectio'')
::''subsection''
:'''series''' (''series'')
::''subseries''

'''''species''''' (''species'')
::''subspecies''
:'''variety''' (''varietas'')
::''subvarietas''
:'''form''' (''forma'')
::''subforma''

----

There are definitions of the following taxonomic categories in the [[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]]: [[cultivar group]], [[cultivar]], [[Grex (horticulture)|grex]].

The rules in the ICN apply primarily to the ranks of family and below, and only to some extent to those above the rank of family. Also see [[descriptive botanical names]].

===Names of botanical taxa===&lt;!-- [[Nothotaxon]] redirects here --&gt;
Taxa at the rank of genus and above have a [[botanical name]] in one part (unitary name); those at the rank of species and above (but below genus) have a botanical name in two parts ([[binary name]]); all taxa below the rank of species have a botanical name in three parts (an [[Infraspecific name (botany)|infraspecific name]]). To indicate the rank of the infraspecific name, a "connecting term" is needed. Thus ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''juncifolia'', where "subsp." is an abbreviation for "subspecies", is the name of a subspecies of ''[[Poa secunda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art4 |at=Articles 4.2 and 24.1 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants – Melbourne Code |date=2012 |website=IAPT-Taxon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybrids can be specified either by a "hybrid formula" that specifies the parentage, or may be given a name. For hybrids receiving a [[hybrid name (botany)|hybrid name]], the same ranks apply, prefixed with ''notho'' (Greek: 'bastard'), with nothogenus as the highest permitted rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art3 |at=Article 3.2, and Appendix 1, Articles H.1–3 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants – Melbourne Code |date=2012 |website=IAPT-Taxon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Cohort (taxonomy)}}

==== Outdated names for botanical ranks ====
If a different term for the rank was used in an old publication, but the intention is clear, botanical nomenclature specifies certain substitutions:{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}
* If names were "intended as names of orders, but published with their rank denoted by a term such as": "cohors" [Latin for "cohort";&lt;ref&gt;Stearn, W.T. 1992. ''Botanical Latin: History, grammar, syntax, terminology and vocabulary, Fourth edition''. David and Charles.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Cohort (taxonomy) redirects here, so...--&gt;see also [[cohort study]] for the use of the term in ecology], "nixus", "alliance", or "Reihe" instead of "order" (Article 17.2), they are treated as names of orders.
* "Family" is substituted for "order" (ordo) or "natural order" (ordo naturalis) under certain conditions where the modern meaning of "order" was not intended. (Article 18.2)
* "Subfamily is substituted for "suborder" (subordo) under certain conditions where the modern meaning of "suborder" was not intended. (Article 19.2)
* In a publication prior to 1 January 1890, if only one infraspecific rank is used, it is considered to be that of variety. (Article 37.4) This commonly applies to publications that labelled infraspecific taxa with Greek letters, α, β, γ, ...

==Examples==
Classifications of five species follow: the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] familiar in genetics laboratories (''Drosophila melanogaster''), [[human]]s (''Homo sapiens''), the [[pea]]s used by [[Gregor Mendel]] in his discovery of [[genetics]] (''Pisum sativum''), the "fly agaric" mushroom ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', and the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. The eight major ranks are given in bold; a selection of minor ranks are given as well.

;Table notes:
*The ranks of higher taxa, especially intermediate ranks, are prone to revision as new information about relationships is discovered. For example, the [[flowering plant]]s have been downgraded from a division (Magnoliophyta) to a subclass (Magnoliidae), and the superorder has become the rank that distinguishes the major groups of flowering plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Chase, M.W. |author2=Reveal, J.L. |year=2009 |title=A phylogenetic classification of the land plants to accompany APG III |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=122–127 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.01002.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional classification of primates (class Mammalia—subclass Theria—infraclass Eutheria—order Primates) has been modified by new classifications such as McKenna and Bell (class Mammalia—subclass Theriformes—infraclass Holotheria) with Theria and Eutheria assigned lower ranks between infraclass and the order Primates. See [[mammal classification]] for a discussion. These differences arise because there are only a small number of ranks available and a large number of branching points in the fossil record.
*Within species further units may be recognised. Animals may be classified into subspecies (for example, ''Homo sapiens sapiens'', modern humans) or [[Polymorphism (biology)|morph]]s (for example ''Corvus corax varius'' morpha ''leucophaeus'', the pied raven). Plants may be classified into subspecies (for example, ''Pisum sativum'' subsp. ''sativum'', the garden pea) or varieties (for example, ''Pisum sativum'' var. ''macrocarpon'', snow pea), with cultivated plants getting a [[cultivar]] name (for example, ''Pisum sativum'' var. ''macrocarpon'' 'Snowbird'). Bacteria may be classified by [[strain (biology)|strains]] (for example [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|''Escherichia coli'' O157:H7]], a strain that can cause [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]]).

==Terminations of names==
[[Taxon|Taxa]] above the genus level are often given names based on the [[type genus]], with a standard termination. The terminations used in forming these names depend on the kingdom (and sometimes the phylum and class) as set out in the table below.

Pronunciations given are the [[Traditional English pronunciation of Latin|most Anglicized]]. More Latinate pronunciations are also common, particularly {{IPAc-en|ɑː}} rather than {{IPAc-en|eɪ}} for stressed ''a''.

;Table notes:
* In botany and mycology names at the rank of family and below are based on the name of a genus, sometimes called the [[type genus]] of that taxon, with a standard ending. For example, the rose family, [[Rosaceae]], is named after the genus ''Rosa'', with the standard ending "-aceae" for a family. Names above the rank of family are also formed from a generic name, or are descriptive (like [[Gymnosperm]]ae or [[Fungus|Fungi]]).
* For animals, there are standard suffixes for taxa only up to the rank of superfamily.&lt;ref&gt;ICZN article 29.2&lt;/ref&gt;
* Forming a name based on a generic name may be not straightforward. For example, the [[Latin]] ''homo'' has the genitive ''hominis'', thus the genus ''Homo'' (human) is in the [[Great ape|Hominidae]], not "Homidae".
* The ranks of epifamily, infrafamily and infratribe (in animals) are used where the complexities of phyletic branching require finer-than-usual distinctions. Although they fall below the rank of superfamily, they are not regulated under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature and hence do not have formal standard endings. The suffixes listed here are regular, but informal.&lt;ref&gt;As supplied by Gaffney &amp; Meylan (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many animal orders have the informal suffix ''-ida'' {{IPAc-en|ᵻ|d|ə}}, e.g. [[Hyolithida]] and [[Naraoiida|Nectaspida (Naraoiida)]]

==All ranks== 
There is an indeterminate number of ranks, as a taxonomist may invent a new rank at will, at any time, if they feel this is necessary. In doing so, there are some restrictions, which will vary with the [[Nomenclature codes|nomenclature code]] which applies.

The following is an artificial synthesis, solely for purposes of demonstration of relative rank (but see notes), from most general to most specific:&lt;ref&gt;For the general usage and coordination of zoological ranks between the phylum and family levels, including many intercalary ranks, see Carroll (1988). For additional intercalary ranks in zoology, see especially Gaffney &amp; Meylan (1988); McKenna &amp; Bell (1997); Milner (1988); Novacek (1986, cit. in Carroll 1988: 499, 629); and [[Paul Sereno]]'s 1986 classification of [[ornithischia]]n dinosaurs as reported in Lambert (1990: 149, 159). For botanical ranks, including many intercalary ranks, see Willis &amp; McElwain (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

In botanical classification, the cohort group has sometimes been inserted between the division (phylum) group and the class group: see Willis &amp; McElwain (2002: 100–101), or has sometimes been used at the rank of order, and is now considered to be an obsolete name for order: See International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, Melbourne Code 2012, Article 17.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear from the sources how these two sequences are to be coordinated (or interwoven) within a unitary zoological hierarchy of ranks.

== Significance and problems ==
Ranks are assigned based on subjective dissimilarity, and do not fully reflect the gradational nature of variation within nature. In most cases, higher taxonomic groupings arise further back in time: not because the rate of diversification was higher in the past, but because each subsequent diversification event results in an increase of diversity and thus increases the taxonomic rank assigned by present-day taxonomists.&lt;ref name="Gingerich1987"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gingerich | first1 = P. D. | doi = 10.1139/z87-169 | title = Evolution and the fossil record: patterns, rates, and processes | journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology | volume = 65 | issue = 5 | pages = 1053–1060 | year = 1987 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, some groups have many described species not because they are more diverse than other species, but because they are more easily sampled and studied than other group.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Of these many ranks, the most basic is species. However, this is not to say that a taxon at any other rank may not be sharply defined, or that any species is guaranteed to be sharply defined. It varies from case to case. Ideally, a taxon is intended to represent a [[clade]], that is, the [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]] of the organisms under discussion, but this is not a requirement.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Classification, in which all taxa have formal ranks, cannot adequately reflect knowledge about phylogeny; at the same time, if taxon names are dependent on ranks, rank-free taxa can't be supplied with names. This problem is dissolved in cladoendesis, where the specially elaborated rank-free nomenclatures are used.&lt;ref&gt;Kluge N.J. 1999. A system of alternative nomenclatures of supra-species taxa. Linnaean and post-Linnaean principles of systematics. // Entomological Review 79(2): 133-147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kluge N.J. 2010. Circumscriptional names of higher taxa in Hexapoda. // Bionomina 1: 15–55&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no rules for how many species should make a genus, a family, or any other higher taxon (that is, a taxon in a category above the species level).&lt;ref&gt;Stuessy, T.F. (2009). ''Plant Taxonomy: The Systematic Evaluation of Comparative Data.'' 2nd ed. Columbia University Press, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brusca"&gt;Brusca, R.C. &amp; Brusca, G.J. (2003). ''Invertebrates''. 2nd ed. Sunderland, Massachusetts: Sinauer Associates, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be a natural group (that is, non-artificial, non-[[polyphyletic]]), as judged by a biologist, using all the information available to them. Equally ranked higher taxa in different phyla are not necessarily equivalent (e.g., it is incorrect to assume that families of insects are in some way evolutionarily comparable to families of mollusks).&lt;ref name="Brusca" /&gt; For animals, at least the [[phylum]] rank is usually associated with a certain [[body plan]], which is also, however, an arbitrary criterion.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

'''Telephone interpreting''' is a service that connects human [[interpret]]ers via telephone to individuals who wish to speak to each other but do not share a common language. The telephone interpreter converts the spoken language from one language to another, enabling listeners and speakers to understand each other. Interpretation over the telephone most often takes place in [[Interpret#Consecutive interpreting|consecutive mode]], which means that the interpreter waits until the speaker finishes an [[utterance]] before rendering the interpretation into the other language.

Telephone interpreting is one [[:wikt:modality|modality]] or delivery mechanism for providing interpreting services. Other forms of delivering interpreting services include in-person interpreting and [[Video Relay Service|video interpreting for the deaf and hard of hearing]].

== Providers ==

There are many types of organizations that provide telephone interpreting services, including for-profit companies, governmental organizations, non-profit groups, and internal divisions within organizations. For example, the government of Australia operates a telephone interpreting service,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthtranslations.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcht.nsf/PresentDetail?Open&amp;s=Telephone_Interpreting_Service Australian Telephone Interpreting Service]&lt;/ref&gt; as do the governments of South Africa and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dacst.gov.za/speeches/press/mar2002/tissa_launch.htm South Africa Interpretation Service] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005181342/http://www.dacst.gov.za/speeches/press/mar2002/tissa_launch.htm |date=2011-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.languageline.govt.nz/oeawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Language-Line-Index?OpenDocument New Zealand Interpretation Service]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===

In the United States, telephone interpreting is widely used by its federal courts.&lt;ref&gt;

{{cite web

 |df          = 
}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous commercial providers are also available and commonly used. Many of the commercial telephone interpreting providers connect users with interpreters for more than 150 languages. Some providers claim to have the ability to connect an interpreter at any time of day, within a matter of seconds. Some hospitals and health care systems also provide telephone interpreting services.&lt;ref&gt;

Major providers of telephone interpretation in the United States include [[Language Line Services]], [[CyraCom|CyraCom International]] and Pacific Interpreters. In 2009, CyraCom was the second largest supplier of telephone interpretation in the world behind Language Line Services ranked #1, while Pacific Interpreters was the fifth largest.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Nataly; DePalma, Donald A.

Language Line Inc. is an American commercial interpreting provider that in 2006 acquired a UK charity of the same name: British social activist [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]] noticed that language barriers were leading to substandard services for ethnic minorities at [[Royal London Hospital]], so he obtained grant funding to provide free telephone interpreters starting in 1990. Police on the [[Isle of Dogs]] became his second client, and he later began serving corporate clients and converted the charity into a commercial service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.languageline.co.uk/page/history/ Language Line History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501221038/http://www.languageline.co.uk/page/history/ |date=2010-05-01 }}, Language Line website.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is now a prevalence of companies that offer this service, many on a more global basis which is a natural benefit of "virtualising" interpretation. Similarly to translation, the diversity of organisations cover generic interpretation, as well as domain-specific services such as legal, medical, pharmaceutical and other technical.

== Equipment ==

Users typically access telephone interpreting services with a telephone or computer with [[Voip|VoIP]]. However, if the two parties wishing to communicate are in the same location, using a dual handset phone, a phone with two receivers, can relieve the two parties from passing a phone back and forth. [[Speakerphone]]s are also sometimes used, but these can create challenges both in terms of confidentiality, and for the interpreter, especially due to background noise, which can hinder the interpreter's ability to hear.

Where one party is [[deaf]], [[hard-of-hearing]] or [[Speech disorder|speech-impaired]], communication via an off-site [[Interpreters#Sign language interpreting|sign language interpreter]] can be performed using a [[videotelephony|video link]] using the [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands|necessary video telecommunication equipment]].

== Access ==

The provisioning of telephone interpreting generally fits into two main categories:

* '''Automated''': an [[Interactive voice response|Interactive Voice Response (IVR)]] application is employed to convert spoken or keyed [[Dual-tone multi-frequency|Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF)]] data into a request for connecting to an interpreter in a specific language (identified by [[Language code|unique language-codes]]).
* '''Operator-led''': utilise customer-care staff to answer the call, gather the required information from the caller, and facilitate the connection to the interpreter. A service of this nature can be preferred by organisations such as [[emergency service]]s, where the client's knowledge of language codes is absent.

Additionally, some of the companies that have the required capability will offer a hybrid of the two principles, where for example a customer can:
* Call in to the service
* Input their "account code" into a single-layer [[Interactive voice response|Interactive Voice Response (IVR)]] using the phone keypad
* Be connected to a call-centre agent who will already know who the caller is, and will facilitate other data capture relevant to the call (including the required language)

== Uses ==
{{further|Video Relay Service}}
Telephone interpreting is widely used in a number of settings, including health care,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; government, financial, [[Emergency telephone number|emergency telephone call centres]] (e.g. '9-1-1' or '1-1-2'), and others. Telephone interpreting is especially helpful for settings in which the two parties would communicate via telephone anyway, such as interactions between call centers and consumers, calls between members of the public and emergency telephone call centres, etc. Telephone interpreting can be used to take applications over the phone and help individuals with account issues.

Telephone interpretation via [[Video Remote Interpreting]] (VRI) or a [[Video Relay Service]] (VRS) are also useful where one of the parties is  [[deaf]], [[hard-of-hearing]] or [[Speech disorder|speech-impaired]]. In such cases the interpretation flow is normally within the same principal language, such as [[French Sign Language]] (FSL) to spoken French, [[Spanish Sign Language]] (SSL) to spoken Spanish, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) to spoken English, and [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) also to spoken English (since BSL and ASL are completely distinct), etc.  [[Multilingual]] [[Interpreters#Sign language interpreting|sign language interpreter]]s, who can also translate as well across principal languages (such as to and from SSL, to and from spoken English), are also available, albeit less frequently. Such activities involve considerable effort on the part of the translator, since [[sign language]]s are distinct [[natural language]]s with their own construction and [[syntax]], which are different from the aural version of the same principal language.

== Market ==
{{Primary sources|section|date=August 2011}}

In 2007, the global telephone interpreting market was worth $700 million, with an estimated $500 million generated in the United States. Industry analyst firm Common Sense Advisory estimates that in 2012, the market will be worth $1.2 billion, an increase of 70% from 2007. The market for telephone interpreting is global in scope and includes companies from the United States, the Netherlands, Sweden, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, India, China, Norway, Spain, and Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;

The genre of '''travel literature''' encompasses [[outdoor literature]], [[guide book]]s, [[nature writing]], and travel [[memoir]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cuddon, J. A. |title=The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory |location=London |publisher=Penguin Books |date=1999 |page=937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One early travel memoirist in [[Western literature]] was [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], a Greek geographer of the 2nd century AD. In the [[early modern period]], [[James Boswell]]'s ''Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides'' (1786) helped shape travel memoir as a genre.

==History==
[[File:ColombusNotesToMarcoPolo.jpg|thumb|Handwritten notes by [[Christopher Columbus]] on the Latin edition of [[Marco Polo]]'s ''Il Milione'']]
{{further|The Travels of Marco Polo}}
Early examples of travel literature include [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]' ''Description of Greece'' in the 2nd century CE, the ''[[Itinerarium Cambriae|Journey Through Wales]]'' (1191) and ''[[Descriptio Cambriae|Description of Wales]]'' (1194) by [[Gerald of Wales]], and the travel journals of [[Ibn Jubayr]] (1145&amp;ndash;1214) and [[Ibn Battuta]] (1304&amp;ndash;1377), both of whom recorded their travels across the known world in detail. The travel genre was a fairly common genre in medieval [[Arabic literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Travel Genre in Arabic Literature: A Selective Literary and Historical Study|first=Fathi A.|last=El-Shihibi|publisher=Dissertation.com|location=Boca Raton, Fla|year=2006|isbn=1-58112-326-4|type=Originally presented as the author's thesis (Ph.D.--Boston University, 1998)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Travel literature became popular during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) of medieval China.&lt;ref name="hargett 67"&gt;Hargett 1985, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The genre was called 'travel record literature' (youji wenxue), and was often written in [[narrative]], [[prose]], [[essay]] and [[diary]] style.&lt;ref name="hargett 67 93"&gt;Hargett 1985, pp. 67–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Travel literature authors such as [[Fan Chengda]] (1126–1193) and [[Xu Xiake]] (1587–1641) incorporated a wealth of [[geographical]] and [[topographical]] information into their writing, while the 'daytrip essay' ''[[Su Shi#Travel record literature|Record of Stone Bell Mountain]]'' by the noted poet and statesman [[Su Shi]] (1037–1101) presented a philosophical and moral argument as its central purpose.&lt;ref name="hargett 74 76"&gt;Hargett 1985, pp. 74–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest known records of taking pleasure in travel, of travelling for the sake of travel and writing about it, is [[Francesco Petrarch|Petrarch]]'s (1304&amp;ndash;1374) ascent of [[Mount Ventoux]] in 1336. He states that he went to the mountaintop for the pleasure of seeing the top of the famous height. His companions who stayed at the bottom he called ''frigida incuriositas'' ("a cold lack of curiosity"). He then wrote about his climb, making [[Medieval allegory|allegorical]] comparisons between climbing the mountain and his own moral progress in life.

Michault Taillevent, a poet for the [[Duke of Burgundy]], travelled through the [[Jura Mountains]] in 1430 and recorded his personal reflections, his horrified reaction to the sheer rock faces, and the terrifying thunderous cascades of mountain streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7yqsIYSNmLMC&amp;pg=PA32 | title=Un poète bourguignon du XVe siècle, Michault Taillevent: édition et étude | publisher=Librairie Droz |author1=Deschaux, Robert |author2=Taillevent, Michault | year=1975 | pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Antoine de la Sale]] (c. 1388&amp;ndash;c. 1462), author of ''Petit Jehan de Saintre'', climbed to the crater of a volcano in the [[Lipari Islands]] in 1407, leaving us with his impressions. "Councils of mad youth" were his stated reasons for going. In the mid-15th century, Gilles le Bouvier, in his ''Livre de la description des pays'', gave us his reason to travel and write:
:Because many people of diverse nations and countries delight and take pleasure, as I have done in times past, in seeing the world and things therein, and also because many wish to know without going there, and others wish to see, go, and travel, I have begun this little book.

In 1589, [[Richard Hakluyt]] (c. 1552&amp;ndash;1616) published ''Voyages'', a foundational text of the travel literature genre.

In the 18th Century, travel literature was commonly known as the book of travels, which mainly consisted of maritime [[diary|diaries]].&lt;ref name="stolley 26"&gt;Stolley 1992, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In 18th century Britain, almost every famous writer worked in the travel literature form.&lt;ref name="fussell 54"&gt;Fussell 1963, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Captain James Cook]]'s diaries (1784) were the equivalent of today's best sellers&lt;ref&gt;Glyndwr Williams, ''Captain Cook's Voyages: 1768–1779''. London: The Folio Society, 1997, p. xxxii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s ''Personal narrative of travels to the equinoctial regions of America, during the years 1799–1804'', originally published in French, was translated to multiple languages and influenced later naturalists, including [[Charles Darwin]].

Other later examples of travel literature include accounts of the [[Grand Tour]]. Aristocrats, clergy, and others with money and leisure time travelled Europe to learn about the art and architecture of its past. One tourism literature pioneer was [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] (1850&amp;ndash;1894), with ''[[An Inland Voyage]]'' (1878), and  ''[[Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes]]'' (1879) about his travels in the [[Cévennes]], (France), is among the first popular books to present hiking and camping as recreational activities, and tells of commissioning one of the first [[sleeping bag]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

==Travel books==
{{further|List of travel books}}

Travel books come in styles ranging from the [[documentary]], to the literary, as well as the journalistic, and from the humorous to the serious. They are often associated with [[tourism]] and include [[guide book]]s. Travel writing may be found on web sites, in periodicals, and in books. It has been produced by a variety of writers, including travelers, military officers, missionaries, explorers, scientists, pilgrims, social and physical scientists, educators, and migrants. Englishmen [[Eric Newby]],&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[[Margalit Fox]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/24/obituaries/24newby.html "Eric Newby, 86, Acclaimed British Travel Writer, Dies"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 24 october 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[H. V. Morton]], the Americans [[Bill Bryson]] and [[Paul Theroux]], and [[Wales|Welsh]] author [[Jan Morris]] are or were widely acclaimed as travel writers (though Morris has frequently claimed herself as a writer of 'place' rather than travel ''per se'').{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Bill Bryson in 2011 won the Golden Eagle Award from the Outdoor Writers and Photographers Guild.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.owpg.org.uk/2011/08/bill-bryson-wins-prestigious-golden-eagle-award/&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 November 2012, Durham University officially renamed the [[Durham University Library|Main Library]] the Bill Bryson Library for his contributions as the university's 11th chancellor (2005–11).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Main Library is being renamed 'The Bill Bryson Library'!|date=2012-09-25|work=[[Durham University]]|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/library/news/?itemno=15355|accessdate=2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill Bryson Library renaming event, Tuesday 27 November 2012|date=2012-11-22|work=[[Durham University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Theroux was awarded the 1981 [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for his novel ''[[The Mosquito Coast]]'', which was adapted for the 1986 movie of the same name. He was also awarded in 1989 the [[Thomas Cook Travel Book Award]]  for ''Riding the Iron Rooster''. In 2005, Jan Morris was awarded the [[Golden PEN Award]] by [[English PEN]] for "a Lifetime's Distinguished Service to Literature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.englishpen.org/prizes/golden-pen-award-for-a-lifetimes-distinguished-service-to-literature |title=Golden Pen Award, official website |publisher=[[English PEN]] |date= |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Traveling Genius: The Writing Life of Jan Morris |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wHMEVRxWx6UC&amp;pg=PR20 |author=Gillian Fenwick |publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press |chapter=Chronology |page=XX |year=2008 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Travel literature often intersects with [[essay]] writing, as in [[V. S. Naipaul]]'s ''[[India: A Wounded Civilization]]'' (1976), whose trip became the occasion for extended observations on a nation and people. This is similarly the case in [[Rebecca West]]'s work on Yugoslavia, ''[[Black Lamb and Grey Falcon]]'' (1941).&lt;ref&gt;West, Rebecca, intr. Geoff Dyer, (2006). ''Black Lamb and Grey Falcon: A Journey Through Yugoslavia''. Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a writer will settle into a locality for an extended period, absorbing a sense of place while continuing to observe with a travel writer's sensibility. Examples of such writings include [[Lawrence Durrell]]'s ''[[Bitter Lemons]]'' (1957), [[Deborah Tall]]'s ''The Island of the White Cow: Memories of an Irish Island'' (1986),&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Gross, "'White Cow` Absorbing Account Of Irish Island The Island Of The White Cow: Memories Of An Irish Island. By Deborah Tall". March 2, 1986, ''News/Sun-Sentinel''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Mayle]]'s best-selling ''[[A Year in Provence]]'' (1989) and its sequels.

Travel and nature writing merge in many of the works by [[Sally Carrighar]], [[Gerald Durrell]] and [[Ivan T. Sanderson]]. Sally Carrighar's works include ''One Day at Teton Marsh'' (1965), ''Home to the Wilderness'' (1973), and ''Wild Heritage'' (1965). [[Gerald Durrell]]'s ''[[My Family and Other Animals]]'' (1956) is an autobiographical work by the British naturalist. It tells of the years that he lived as a child with his siblings and widowed mother on the Greek island of [[Corfu]] between 1935 and 1939. It describes the life of the Durrell family in a humorous manner, and explores the fauna of the island. It is the first and most well-known of Durrell's "Corfu trilogy", together with ''[[Birds, Beasts, and Relatives]]'' and ''[[The Garden of the Gods]]'' (1978). [[Ivan T. Sanderson]] published ''Animal Treasure'', a report of an expedition to the jungles of then-British West Africa; ''Caribbean Treasure'', an account of an expedition to [[Trinidad]], [[Haiti]], and [[Surinam]], begun in late 1936 and ending in late 1938; and ''Living Treasure'', an account of an expedition to [[Jamaica]], British Honduras (now [[Belize]]) and the [[Yucatán]]. These authors are [[natural history|naturalists]], who write in support of their fields of study. Another naturalist, [[Charles Darwin]], wrote his famous account of the journey of [[The Voyage of the Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']] at the intersection of science, natural history and travel.&lt;ref&gt;"Review of Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of H.M.S. Adventure and Beagle between the Years 1826 and 1836 ... &amp; Journal of Researches into the Geology and Natural History of the various Countries visited by H.M.S. Beagle ...". ''The Quarterly Review''. 65: 194–234. December 1839.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of writers famous in other fields have written about their travel experiences. Examples are [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland'' (1775); [[Charles Dickens]]' ''American Notes for General Circulation'' (1842); [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s ''Letters Written during a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark'' (1796); [[Hilaire Belloc]]'s ''The Path To Rome'' (1902); [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s ''Twilight in Italy and Other Essays'' (1916); ''Mornings in Mexico and Other Essays'' (1927); [[Rebecca West]]'s ''[[Black Lamb and Grey Falcon]]'' (1941); and [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[Travels with Charley: In Search of America]]'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason.com/archives/2011/04/04/sorry-charley "Sorry, Charley"], Bill Steigerwald, ''Reason'', April 2011 [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/books/steinbecks-travels-with-charley-gets-a-fact-checking.html "A Reality Check for Steinbeck and Charley"], Charles McGrath, ''New York Times'', April 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adventure literature==
In the world of sailing [[Joshua Slocum]]'s ''[[Sailing Alone Around the World]]'' (1900) is a classic of outdoor adventure literature.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Slocum Society: [http://www.joshuaslocumsocietyintl.org].&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1895, [[Joshua Slocum]] set sail from [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and in  ''Sailing Alone Around the World'',&lt;ref name=SailingAlone&gt;Slocum (1899), ''Sailing Alone Around the World''&lt;/ref&gt; he described his departure in the following manner:

:I had resolved on a voyage around the world, and as the wind on the morning of April 24, 1895 was fair, at noon I weighed anchor, set sail, and filled away from Boston, where the ''Spray'' had been moored snugly all winter. ... A thrilling pulse beat high in me. My step was light on deck in the crisp air. I felt there could be no turning back, and that I was engaging in an adventure the meaning of which I thoroughly understood.

More than three years later, on June 27, 1898, Slocum returned to [[Newport, Rhode Island]], having [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the world.

==Guide books==
{{main|Guide book}}
[[Image:Claife Station.jpg|right|thumb|Claife Station, built at one of [[Thomas West (priest)|Thomas West]]'s 'viewing stations', to allow visiting tourists and artists to better appreciate the [[picturesque]] English [[Lake District]].]]
A '''guide book''' or '''travel guide''' is "a book of information about a place, designed for the use of visitors or tourists".&lt;ref&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; An early example is [[Thomas West (priest)|Thomas West]]'s guide to the [[Lake District]], published in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas West, (1821) [1778]. ''A Guide to the Lakes in Cumberland, Westmorland, and Lancashire''. Kendal: W. Pennington.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas West (priest)|Thomas West]], an English [[priest]], popularized the idea of walking for pleasure in his guide to the [[Lake District]] of 1778. In the introduction he wrote that he aimed: &lt;blockquote&gt;to encourage the taste of visiting the lakes by furnishing the traveller with a Guide; and for that purpose, the writer has here collected and laid before him, all the select stations and points of view, noticed by those authors who have last made the tour of the lakes, verified by his own repeated observations.&lt;ref name=West2&gt;{{cite book |last=West |title=A Guide to the Lakes |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; To this end he included various 'stations' or viewpoints around the lakes, from which tourists would be encouraged to appreciate the views in terms of their aesthetic qualities.&lt;ref name=development&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lakedistrict.uk7.net/tourist_development.html |title=Development of tourism in the Lake District National Park |accessdate=2008-11-27 |publisher=Lake District UK |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011064752/http://www.lakedistrict.uk7.net/tourist_development.html |archivedate=October 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Published in 1778 the book was a major success.&lt;ref name=NPA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/learning/lakedistrictfacts/archaeologyhistory/archaeologydiscoveryzone/archaeologyindepth/archaeologyviewing-stations-2 |title=Understanding the National Park &amp;mdash; Viewing Stations |accessdate=2008-11-27 |publisher=Lake District National Park Authority |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104212541/http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/learning/lakedistrictfacts/archaeologyhistory/archaeologydiscoveryzone/archaeologyindepth/archaeologyviewing-stations-2 |archivedate=2014-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It will usually include full details relating to accommodation, restaurants, transportation, and activities. Maps of varying detail and historical and cultural information are also often included. Different kinds of guide books exist, focusing on different aspects of travel, from [[adventure travel]] to relaxation, or aimed at travelers with different incomes, or focusing on sexual orientation or types of diet. Travel guides can also take the form of [[travel website]]s.

==Travel journals==
[[File:Goethe's Italian Journey.png|thumb|upright|Goethe's Italian Journey between September 1786 and May 1788]]
A travel journal, also called road journal, is a record made by a traveller, sometimes in diary form, of the traveler's experiences, written during the course of the journey and later edited for publication. This is a long-established literary format; an early example is the writing of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (2nd century AD) who produced his ''Description of Greece'' based on his own observations. [[James Boswell]] published his ''[[The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides]]'' in 1786 and [[Goethe]] published his ''[[Italian Journey]]'', based on diaries, in 1816. [[Frances Erskine Inglis, 1st Marquise of Calderón de la Barca|Fannie Calderón de la Barca]], the Scottish-born wife of the Spanish ambassador to Mexico 1839–1842, wrote ''[[Life in Mexico]]'', an important travel narrative of her time there, with many observations of local life. A British traveller, [[Mrs Alec Tweedie]], published a number of travelogues, ranging from Denmark (1895) and Finland (1897), to the U.S. (1913), several on Mexico (1901, 1906, 1917), and one on Russia, Siberia, and China (1926). A more recent example is [[Che Guevara]]'s ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries (book)|The Motorcycle Diaries]]''. A travelogue is a [[Travelogue (films)|film]], book written up from a travel diary, or illustrated talk describing the experiences of and places visited by traveller.&lt;ref&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; American writer [[Paul Theroux]] has published many works of travel literature, the first success being ''[[The Great Railway Bazaar]]''.  Anglo-American [[Bill Bryson]] is known for ''[[A Walk in the Woods (book)|A Walk in the Woods]]'', made into a Hollywood [[A Walk in the Woods (film)|film of the same name]].&lt;ref name="variety.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=‘99 Homes,’ ‘A Walk in the Woods’ Set for September Releases|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/99-homes-a-walk-in-the-woods-release-date-broad-green-1201468864/|accessdate=April 9, 2015|work=variety.com|date=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction==
Some fictional travel stories are related to travel literature. Although it may be desirable in some contexts to distinguish [[fiction]]al from [[non-fiction]]al works, such distinctions have proved notoriously difficult to make in practice, as in the famous instance of the travel writings of [[Marco Polo]] or [[John Mandeville]]. Examples of fictional works of travel literature based on actual journeys are: 
* [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899), which has its origin in an actual voyage Conrad made up the [[River Congo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Conrad, Joseph &amp; Zdzisław Najder (Editor)|title=The Congo Diary and Other Uncollected Pieces| date= 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Jack Kerouac]]'s ''[[On the Road]]'' (1957) and ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'' (1958) are fictionalized accounts of his travels across the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s
*Travel writer [[Kira Salak]]'s novel, ''[[The White Mary]]'' (2008), a contemporary example of a real life journey transformed into a work of fiction, which takes place in [[Papua New Guinea]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]].&lt;ref name=NatGeoWhiteMary&gt;{{cite web|last=Finkel[[Michael Finkel|Finkel]]|first= Michael|title=Kira Salek: The White Mary|url=http://adventure.nationalgeographic.com/2008/08/kira-salak/michael-finkel-text|work=National Geographic Adventure|accessdate=12 November 2010|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WallStreetWhiteMary&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121702303930685891?mod=2_1167_1 |title=Imaginary Journey |work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Jeffrey A. | last=Trachtenberg | date=26 July 2008|accessdate=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amazon_entryWhiteMary&gt;{{cite web |title=The White Mary: A Novel|work=Amazon.com|isbn=0805088474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travel blogs==
In the 21st century, travel literature became a genre of [[social media]] in the form of travel blogs, with travel bloggers using outlets like personal [[blog]]s, [[Pinterest]], [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]] to convey information about their adventures, and provide advice for navigating particular countries, or for traveling generally.&lt;ref name="TJEPIC"&gt;F. Hanusch, E. Fürsich, ''Travel Journalism: Exploring Production, Impact and Culture'' (2014), p. 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt; Travel blogs were among the first instances of blogging, which began in the mid 1990s.&lt;ref name="TJEPIC"/&gt;. In 2018 the most popular self hosted blogging platform is [[WordPress]], due to its ease of use&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-choose-the-best-blogging-platform/|title=How to Choose the Best Blogging Platform in 2018 (Compared)|date=2016-11-10|work=WPBeginner|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Scholarship==

&lt;!--this whole section smells of [[WP:OR]] and [[WP:POV]]; needs either rewrite or thorough citations--&gt;
The systematic study of travel literature emerged as a field of scholarly inquiry in the mid-1990s, with its own conferences, organizations, journals, monographs, anthologies, and encyclopedias.  Important, pre-1995 monographs are: ''Abroad'' (1980) by [[Paul Fussell]], an [[exploration]] of British interwar travel writing as escapism; ''Gone Primitive: Modern Intellects, Savage Minds'' (1990) by Marianna Torgovnick, an inquiry into the [[primitivism|primitivist]] presentations of foreign cultures; ''Haunted Journeys: Desire and Transgression in European Travel Writing'' (1991) by Dennis Porter, a close look at the psychological correlatives of travel; ''Discourses of Difference: An Analysis of Women's Travel Writing'' by Sara Mills, an inquiry into the intersection of gender and [[colonialism]] during the 19th century; ''Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation'' (1992), [[Mary Louise Pratt]]'s influential study of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] travel writing's dissemination of a colonial mind-set; and ''Belated Travelers'' (1994), an analysis of colonial anxiety by Ali Behdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29468460|title=Belated travelers : orientalism in the age of colonial dissolution|last=Behdad|first=Ali|date=1994|publisher=Duke University Press|year=|isbn=0822314711|location=Durham, North Carolina|pages=|oclc=29468460}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Disrupting the assumptions of traditional travel writing, Amitav Ghosh's ''In an Antique Land'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29428387|title=In an antique land|last=Ghosh|first=Amitav|date=1994|publisher=|year=|isbn=0679727833|edition=|location=New York|pages=|oclc=29428387}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be regarded as an example of "counter travel narrative", reversing the "roles of traveller and local, viewing the present as contextualized by the colonial and precolonial past, and eschewing definitive authorial authority [in] a powerful rebuttal to the ideology of the traditional travel text."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McParland|first=Liam|date=2017|title=Egypt, India, ideology: In an antique land as a rebuttal to the traditional travel text|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10613/5430|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=VIUSpace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travel awards==

Prizes awarded annually for travel books have included the [[Thomas Cook Travel Book Award]], which ran from 1980 to 2004, the  [[Boardman Tasker Prize for Mountain Literature]], and the [[Dolman Best Travel Book Award]], which began in 2006. The [[North American Travel Journalists Association]] holds an annual awards competition honoring travel journalism in a multitude of categories, ranging across print and online media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://natja.memberclicks.net/competition-guidelines|title=Competition Rules and Guidelines|last=Leon|first=Yanira|website=natja.memberclicks.net|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Vancouver dusk pano.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Vancouver city skyline view.]]
'''Vancouverism''' is an [[urban planning]] and [[architecture|architectural]] phenomenon in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. It is characterized by a large residential population living in the city centre with mixed-use developments, typically with a medium-height, commercial base and narrow, high-rise [[Tower block|residential towers]], significant reliance on mass [[public transit]], creation and maintenance of green park spaces, and preserving view corridors.&lt;ref name=short&gt;{{cite book |last1=Short |first1=Michael J. |title=Planning for Tall Buildings |date=2012 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-58107-3 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hiller |first1=Harry H. |title=Host Cities and the Olympics: An interactionist approach |date=2012 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-52241-0 |page=157 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-lvd7Nr2CfcC&amp;d |accessdate=August 25, 2014 |ref=hiller}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chappell&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chappell |first1=Jim |title=Vancouver's View Corridors: Should San Francisco adopt similar guidelines? |url=http://www.spur.org/publications/article/2003-11-01/vancouvers-view-corridors |publisher=SPUR |accessdate=August 25, 2014 |date=November 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://designobserver.com/media/pdf/New_Urbanism:__647.pdf Boddy, Trevor 16.2, 2004, U.C.

Being consistently ranked among the most livable cities in the world has urban planners flocking to the city to attempt to try to emulate and implement on their own city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/08/28/vancouver-most-livable-city-economist_n_3830039.html |title=Vancouver The Most Livable City In North America: Economist |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=August 28, 2013 |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |author=The Huffington Post BC |quote=Vancouver may be the best place to live in North America, but it has yet to recover from a Vancouver Island highway closure that dropped it to third in the world in 2011.}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association has taken note of Vancouver's approach to new development and view corridors and asks if San Francisco should pursue similar direction.&lt;ref name=chappell/&gt;

Architect [[Bing Thom]] described Vancouverism this way:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting/pastpodcasts.html?42#ref42 |work=CBC News |title=Past Podcasts – CBC Radio |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621205940/http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting/pastpodcasts.html?42 |archivedate=June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It's a spirit about public space. I think Vancouverites are very, very proud that we built a city that really has a tremendous amount of space on the waterfront for people to recreate and to enjoy.

At the same time, False Creek and Coal Harbour were previously industrial lands that were very polluted and desecrated. We've refreshed all of this with new development, and people have access to the water and the views. So, to me, it's this idea of having a lot people living very close together, mixing the uses. So, we have apartments on top of stores. In Surrey we have a university on top of a shopping centre. This mixing of uses reflects Vancouver in terms of our culture and how we live together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sharma |first1=Ian Alexander Narasimha |title=On the Edge:  Redevelopment Projects at the Urban-Marine Interface in Vancouver, BC |url=https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/22515/Sharma_washington_0250O_11050.pdf.txt |publisher=University of Washington |accessdate=25 August 2014 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An important aspect to note is that Vancouverism is an ideal that was developed in Vancouver but is not present in all regions of the city of Vancouver. Additionally, while outlying regions of Metro Vancouver, such as Surrey, has adopted aspects of these ideals, they did not originate outside the city of Vancouver.

==Background==
Vancouverism developed in part as a product of Vancouver's geographical context. Wedged between the sea, mountains and the border with the United States, the [[Greater Vancouver Regional District]] partnered with the area's municipalities to encourage controlled development. Early recognition that British Columbia's farmland would be engulfed by sprawl led to the establishment of the [[Agricultural Land Reserve]] in the 1970s. This assisted in containing and intensifying development throughout the Vancouver metropolitan area and the [[Fraser Valley]].&lt;ref name=short /&gt;

Architect [[Arthur Erickson]] is credited by some with developing the concept that became Vancouverism in the mid-1950s, in a never-realized development called "Project 56".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2008/06/23/vancouver-architecture.html |work=CBC News |title=Vancouver's architectural style in spotlight at London exhibit |date=June 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the principles were incorporated into the development of the [[West End (Vancouver)|West End]]. The city's planning department, under the direction of Ray Spaxman in the 1980s, began to expand on the concepts, many of which were brought into fruition with the [[Real estate development|development]] of the former [[Expo 86]] lands along [[False Creek]] and [[Yaletown]].

Another person who is credited with influencing Vancouverism is [[Jane Jacobs]], author of ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]''.&lt;ref name="sullivanjacobs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.straight.com/article-702636/vancouver/sullivanism-vs-jane-jacobs |title=Vancouver's density debate pits Sullivanism versus the ideas of Jane Jacobs |publisher=The Georgia Straight |date=June 7, 2012 |accessdate=June 11, 2012 |author=Wood, Daniel |quote=She is why international experts come to Vancouver to study its renowned livability. She’s the mother of Vancouverism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brent Toderian, the former head of Planning for the City of Vancouver says of Jacobs: “There isn't a person or book more influential in creating ‘Vancouverism' than Jane and The Death and Life”... “I know what she means about people misunderstanding density – that's why we emphasize density done well rather than density as a mathematical exercise. [But] people 'round the world praise Vancouver's livability, and she had a big hand in it.”&lt;ref&gt;Wikens, Stephen (May 6, 2011). [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/jane-jacobs-honoured-in-the-breach/article2013286/print/ Jane Jacobs: Honoured in the breach]. ''Globe and Mail'' Retrieved on: May 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics==
One principle associated with Vancouverism, as evidenced by planning policy, involves protecting "view corridors". Vancouver's "View Protection Guidelines" were approved in 1989 and amended in 1990, establishing height limits to protect views of the [[North Shore Mountains]]. This approach, while credited with preserving the city's scenic backdrop, has been criticized for lessening visual interest and failing to represent the city's contemporary image. In response, [[Vancouver City Council|Council]] commissioned a "Skyline Study" in 1997 which concluded that Vancouver's skyline would benefit from the addition of a handful of buildings exceeding current height limits, to add visual interest to Vancouver's skyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Downtown Vancouver Skyline Study |work=Special Council Meeting Minutes |publisher=City of Vancouver |date=April 7, 1997 |url=http://www.vancouver.ca/ctyclerk/cclerk/970407/skyline.htm |accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study found that opportunities for such buildings were restricted due to a limited number of large development sites in the downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=General Policy for Higher Buildings |publisher=City of Vancouver |date=May 6, 1997 |url=http://vancouver.ca/docs/planning/general_policy.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight years later, five of the seven sites identified for higher buildings had been planned or developed. The tallest of the new buildings is the [[Living Shangri-La]] hotel/residential tower, which was completed in 2008, and stands 201&amp;nbsp;metres (659&amp;nbsp;ft)&lt;ref name=buildings_feet&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/bu/sk/li/?id=100997&amp;bt=2&amp;ht=3&amp;sro=1 |title=Vancouver High-rise buildings (in feet) |publisher=Emporis Buildings |accessdate=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; tall (62 stories).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&amp;lng=3&amp;id=livingshangrila-vancouver-canada |title=Living Shangri-La, Vancouver |publisher=Emporis Buildings |accessdate=December 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fine-meshed urban grid with mid-block lanes, has allowed the city to easily densify and promotes walkability. The overhead, visible, grade separated [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)]] transit system is an integral part of the aesthetic of Vancouverism, as it promotes a healthy lifestyle.

==Planning process==
One of the circumstances allowing the development of Vancouverism was the discretionary planning process implemented by the city. The planning process of Vancouver is based on collaboration by aligning the development goals of the city prior to determining the particular actions for individual drivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metrovancouver.org/planning/development/strategy/Pages/designations.aspx RGS Goals and Strategies]. Metrovancouver.org (July 29, 2011). Retrieved on 2014-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the extended public outcry over a freeway and development program known as [[Project 200]], Vancouver voted the [[Elector's Action Movement]] (TEAM) into power. TEAM ran on a platform of implementing more stringent design criteria and oversight to city developments. Development along South False Creek is the ideal urban form advocated by TEAM. The South False Creek development is characterized by low-density, mixed use and mixed-income residential properties with a high level of access to amenities. As well as favouring the urban form found along South False Creek, TEAM implemented significant reforms to the planning process. Discretionary planning allows the automatic approval of small developments that conform to the existing building codes. Larger projects are subject to the design review of the planning department. The planning department is empowered to make decisions that will force developments to conform to certain design guidelines.

==Sustainable development==
Sustainable development refers to solutions that not only benefit the present population, but also the future generations as well. This type of development requires looking at the consequences of decisions, which lead to solutions, and the consequences of those consequences too. Vancouver planners have been looking ahead of their current problems and solutions for decades. An example of this foresight can be seen in Vancouver’s zoning regulations maintaining set-backs and sight-lines; and rejecting the downtown freeway, in which the city sacrificed initial gains for smaller long-term benefits and neighbourhood preservation—a trade-off that benefit current residents and later generations as well. Current issues revolve around finite energy sources and their impacts on the environment. These problems have led Vancouver to outline a growth strategy that considers the environment and community.

'''Vitthala-natha''' ([[IAST]]: Viṭṭhalanātha, c. 1516-1588), popularly known as '''Gusainji''', was an Indian philosopher. He was the younger son of [[Vallabhacharya]], who founded the [[Pushtimarg]] religious sect of Hinduism.

== Names ==

The name Vitthalanatha is also pronounced as Vitthalnath in modern vernaculars because of [[Schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages|schwa deletion]]. His other names include Vitthaleshvara (IAST: Viṭṭhaleśvara), Vitthala Dikshita, or Agnikumara.{{sfn|G. V. Devasthali|1977|p=x}} In addition, he is known by the title ''Gosvami'' (Gosain-ji or Gusain-ji).{{sfn|Roshen Dalal|2014|p=1375}}

== Early life ==

Vitthalanatha was born around 1516 (between 1515 and 1518{{sfn|Roshen Dalal|2014|p=1375}}), as the second son of the religious scholar [[Vallabha]].{{sfn|G. V. Devasthali|1977|p=x}}

His devotees consider him an incarnation of the god [[Vithoba|Vitthal]] of [[Vitthal Temple, Pandharpur|Pandharpur]].{{sfn|Roshen Dalal|2014|p=1375}} He was brought up by Vallabha till the age of 15, and after that, by Vallabha's disciple Damodara-dasa.{{sfn|G. V. Devasthali|1977|p=x}}

He was proficient in the [[Vedas]], the Brahma Sutra, and the Mimansa philosophy. He studied ''nyaya'' at [[Navadvipa]].{{sfn|Roshen Dalal|2014|p=1375}}

== Religious activities ==

After the deaths of his father Vallabhacharya (c. 1530), his elder brother Gopinatha, and Gopinatha's son Purushottama (c. 1550), Vitthalanatha emerged as the main leader of the religious sect established by his father. Initially, he faced some opposition from other leaders of the sect, including Krishnadasa, a manager of the [[Shrinathji Temple]]. Krishnadasa banned Vitthalanatha from entering the temple because of personal disputes, but later, reconciled with him. Vitthalanatha forgave him, and made him in-charge of the [[Govardhan Hill]] temple.{{sfn|Richard Keith Barz|1976|p=54}}

Vitthalanatha propagated the teachings of his father, and established a religious centre at [[Gokul]].{{sfn|Roshen Dalal|2014|p=1375}}

== Literary works ==

The texts and commentaries attributed to Vitthala include:{{sfn|Roshen Dalal|2014|p=1375}}{{sfn|B. K. Bhatt|1980|p=154}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15922">In [[political communication]], the phrase "'''you're either with us, or against us'''" and similar variations are used to depict situations as being [[Polarization (politics)|polarized]] and to force [[witness]]es, [[wikt:bystander|bystander]]s, or others unaligned with some form of pre-existing conflict to either become [[allies]] of the speaking party or lose favor. The implied consequence of not joining the team effort is to be deemed an enemy. An example is the statement of the former [[US President]] [[George W. Bush]], who said after [[9/11]] at the launch of his [[War on Terror|anti-terrorism campaign]] in the form "Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-a-2001-09-21-14-bush-66411197/549664.html Bush: 'You Are Either With Us, Or With the Terrorists' - 2001-09-21], ''[[Voice of America]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The statement generally is a descriptive statement identifying the beliefs of the speaker(s), and thus state a basic assumption, not a logical conclusion. It may also be interpreted as a [[speech act]]. Sometimes but not always interpreted as a [[splitting (psychology)|splitting]] or a  [[false dilemma]], which is an [[informal fallacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/black-or-white|title=Your logical fallacy is black or white|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some see the statement as a way of persuading others to choose sides in a conflict which does not allow the position of [[Neutral country|neutrality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Only when there are no alternatives like a [[middle ground]] does the phrase hold validity as a logical conclusion. The phrases are a form of argumentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Joshua went to him, and said to him, 'Are you for us, or for our adversaries?{{'"}}
* The [[Synoptic Gospels]] attribute the following quote to [[Jesus]]: "Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters" (Matthew 12:30), as well as its [[contrapositive]], "Whoever is not against us is for us" (Luke 9:50; Mark 9:40).&lt;ref&gt;New Revised Standard Version&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]], in an oration before [[Julius Caesar]] in 46 BCE, published as [[Pro Ligario]], made the following distinction: "For we heard you say that we looked upon all as enemies that were not with us; but that you looked upon all as friends that were not against you."&lt;ref&gt;Pro Ligario 11 (33), translation from {{cite book|first1= Marcus Tullius|last1=Cicero|first2=William|last2=Duncan|title=Cicero's Select Orations, Translated Into English|publisher=Sidney's Press|year=1811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nor is there any real way of remaining outside such a war as the present one. In practice, 'he that is not with me is against me'. The idea that you can somehow remain aloof from and superior to the struggle, while living on food which British sailors have to risk their lives to bring you, is a bourgeois illusion bred of money and security."

* Towards the end of [[Joseph Heller]]'s ''[[Catch-22]]'', Colonels Korn and Cathcart equate fighting for their country with fighting for the benefit of the two of them. Korn tells the protagonist Yossarian: "You're either for us or against your country. It's as simple as that." A reviewer of ''Catch-22'' found this "flawless" logical indulgence by the commanding colonels to be comparable to Heller's parody of [[Charles Erwin Wilson]]'s statement, often paraphrased as, "[[Charles Erwin Wilson#Secretary of Defense|What's good for General Motors is good for the country]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=War Stars: The Superweapon and the American Imagination|author=H.

'''Yue''' or '''Yueh''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|j|uː|eɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|j|uː|ˈ|eɪ}}; {{IPA-yue|jyːt̚²}})&lt;ref&gt;"Yueh", ''Webster's Third International Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the primary branches of [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese]] spoken in [[southern China]], particularly the provinces of [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]], collectively known as [[Liangguang]].

The name '''[[Cantonese]]''' is often used for the whole branch, but linguists prefer to reserve that name for the variety of [[Guangzhou]] (Canton), [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], which is the [[prestige dialect]]. [[Taishanese]], from the coastal area of [[Jiangmen]] located southwest of Guangzhou, was the language of most of the 19th-century emigrants from Guangdong to Southeast Asia and North America. Most later migrants have been speakers of [[Cantonese]].

Yue varieties are not [[mutually intelligible]] with other [[varieties of Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor H. Mair]] (2009): [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1211 Mutual Intelligibility of Sinitic Languages]&lt;/ref&gt; They are among the most [[Conservative (language)|conservative]] varieties with regard to the final consonants and tonal categories of [[Middle Chinese]], but have lost several distinctions in the initial and medial consonants that other Chinese varieties have retained.

== Names ==
The prototypical use of the name ''Cantonese'' in English is for the Yue variety of Guangzhou (Canton),&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Cantonese}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is also used for Yue as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ager|first1=Simon|title=Cantonese language, pronunciation and special characters|url=http://www.omniglot.com/chinese/cantonese.htm |website=Omniglot |access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid confusion, academic texts may call the primary branch of Chinese "Yue",&lt;ref&gt;Ethnologue: "Yue Chinese"; "Yue" or older "Yüeh" in the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]]; ISO code ''yue''&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=98}} following the [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] [[pinyin]] spelling, and either restrict "Cantonese" to its common usage for the Guangzhou variety, or avoid the term "Cantonese" altogether and distinguish Yue from Guangzhou (Canton) dialect.

In Chinese, people of Hong Kong and Macau, as well as [[Cantonese people|Cantonese immigrants]] abroad, usually call their language ''Gwóngdūng wá'' {{IPA-yue|kʷɔ̌ːŋ tʊ́ŋ wǎː|}} (廣東話) "speech of Guangdong". The people of Guangdong and Guangxi do not use that term, but rather ''Yuht Yúh'' {{IPA-yue|jỳt jy̬ː|}} (粵語) "Yue language". They also use ''baahk wá'' {{IPA-yue|pàːk wǎː|}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|白話}}}}) on its own to refer to the Guangzhou dialect.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} It is also used in Guangxi to refer to Yue varieties, as for example in an expression like "南寧白話", which means the "''baak waa'' of Nanning".{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=76, 176}}

==History==
The area of China south of the [[Nanling Mountains]], known as the [[Lingnan]] (roughly modern [[Guangxi]] and [[Guangdong]]), was originally home to peoples known to the Chinese as the [[Hundred Yue]] (Baiyue). Large-scale Han Chinese migration to the area began after the [[Qin's campaign against the Yue tribes|Qin conquest of the region]] in 214 BC.{{sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=1}} Successive waves of immigration followed at times of upheaval in Northern and Central China, such as the collapse of the [[Han dynasty|Han]], [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasties.{{sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=1}} The most popular route was via the [[Xiang River]], which the Qin had connected to the [[Li River (Guangxi)|Li River]] by the [[Lingqu Canal]], and then into the valley of the [[Xi Jiang]] (West River).{{sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|pp=2–3}} A secondary route followed the [[Gan River]] and then the [[Bei Jiang]] (North River) into eastern Guangdong.{{sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=2}} Yue-speakers were later joined by [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]]-speakers following the North River route, and [[Min Chinese|Min]]-speakers arriving by sea.{{sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=3}}

After the fall of Qin, the Lingnan area was part of the independent state of [[Nanyue]] for about a century, before being incorporated in the Han empire in 111 BC.{{sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=2}} After the Tang dynasty collapsed, much of the area became part of the state of [[Southern Han]], one of the longest-lived states of the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]], between 917 and 971.{{sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=2}}

Large waves of Chinese migration throughout succeeding Chinese dynasties assimilated huge numbers of Yue aborigines, with the result that today's Southern Han Chinese Yue-speaking population is descended from both groups.{{sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=4}} The colloquial layers of Yue varieties contain elements influenced by the [[Tai languages]] formerly spoken widely in the area and still spoken by people such as the [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] or the [[Kam people|Dong]].{{sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=6}}

===Rise of Cantonese===
The port city of [[Guangzhou]] lies in the middle of [[Pearl River Delta]], with access to the interior via the West River, North River and [[Dong Jiang|East River]], which all converge at the delta. It has been the economic centre of the Lingnan region since Qin times, when it was an important shipbuilding centre.{{sfnp|Li|2006|pp=19–20}} By 660, it was the largest port in China, part of a trade network stretching as far as Arabia.{{sfnp|Li|2006|p=126}} During the [[Southern Song]], it also became the cultural centre of the region.{{sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=4}} Like many other Chinese varieties it developed a distinct literary layer associated with the local tradition of reading the classics.{{sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=5}} The Guangzhou dialect (Cantonese) was used in the popular ''Yuèōu'', ''Mùyú'' and ''Nányīn'' folksong genres, as well as [[Cantonese opera]].{{sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|pp=5–6}}{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=99}}
There was also a small amount of vernacular literature, written with Chinese characters extended with a number of non-traditional characters for Cantonese words.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=99}}

Guangzhou became the centre of rapidly expanding foreign trade after the [[haijin|maritime ban]] was lifted, with the British [[East India Company]] establishing a [[chamber of commerce]] in the city in 1715.{{sfnp|Li|2006|p=126}}
The ancestors of most of the Han Chinese population of [[Hong Kong]] came from Guangzhou after the territory was ceded to Britain in 1842. As a result, [[Hong Kong Cantonese]], the most widely spoken language in Hong Kong and Macau, is an offshoot of the Guangzhou dialect.{{sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=70}} The popularity of Cantonese-language media, [[Cantopop]] and the [[Cinema of Hong Kong]] has since led to substantial exposure of Cantonese to China and the rest of Asia. On the Mainland, the national policy is to promote [[Standard Chinese]], which is also the medium of instruction in schools.{{sfnp|Zhang|Yang|2004|p=154}} The place of local Cantonese language and culture remains contentious. In 2010, a [[Guangzhou Television Cantonese controversy|controversial proposal to switch some programming on Guangzhou local television]] from Cantonese to Mandarin was abandoned following widespread backlash accompanied by public protests.{{sfnp|Bolton|2011|pp=66–68}}

==Distribution and variation==
Yue varieties are spoken in the southern provinces of [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]], an area long dominated culturally and economically by the city of [[Guangzhou]] (Canton) at the delta of the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]]. The [[Cantonese]] variety, also spoken in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], is the prestige variety of Yue.

The influence of Guangzhou has spread westward along the Pearl River system, so that, for example, the speech of the city of [[Wuzhou]] some {{cvt|190|km|mi|abbr=on}} upstream in Guangxi is much more similar to that of Guangzhou than dialects of coastal districts that are closer but separated from the city by hilly terrain.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=23}} One of these coastal languages, [[Taishanese]], is the most common Yue variety among overseas communities.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=98}} Yue varieties are not at all mutually intelligible with one another.{{sfnp|Killingley|1993|p=2}}

In [[Yuan Jiahua]]'s dialect manual (1962), Yue dialects were divided into five groups:{{sfnp|Yan|2006|pp=192–193}}
* [[Yuehai dialects|Yuehai]], covering the [[Pearl River Delta]] and [[Xi River]] valley.
* [[Siyi dialects|Siyi]] (''Seiyap'' "four counties"), in the coastal prefecture of [[Jiangmen]] to the southwest of Guangzhou.
* Gao–Lei, in southwestern Guangdong.
* [[Qin-Lian Yue|Qin–Lian]] (''Hamlim'') in southern [[Guangxi]].
* Guinan, in southwestern Guangxi.

In the ''[[Language Atlas of China]]'', some varieties spoken in western Guangxi formerly classified as Yue are placed in a separate [[Pinghua]] group.{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|p=76}}
The remaining Yue dialects are divided into seven groups.{{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987}}
Three groups are found in the watershed of the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]]:

* Guangfu ({{lang|yue-Hani|廣府話}}) includes [[Cantonese]] proper, spoken in [[Guangzhou]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], as well as the dialects of surrounding areas in the [[Pearl River Delta]] such as [[Zhongshan]], [[Foshan]], [[Dongguan]], [[Zhuhai]] and [[Shenzhen]], and in southern parts of the inland prefectures of [[Zhaoqing]] and [[Qingyuan]] and in parts of Guangxi such as the city of [[Wuzhou]].
* [[Gou-Lou Yue|Gou–Lou]] (''Ngau–Lau'') dialects are spoken in inland areas of western Guangdong and eastern Guangxi, and include the dialect of [[Yulin, Guangxi|Yulin (Bobai)]].
* [[Yong-Xun Yue|Yong–Xun]] (''Yuhng–Cham'') is spoken mainly in the [[Yongjiang|Yong]]–[[Yu River (China)|Yu]]–[[Xun River|Xun]] valley in Guangxi, including the provincial capital [[Nanning]].

The remaining four groups are found in coastal areas:

* [[Siyi dialects|Siyi]] (Sze Yap) dialects are spoken in the coastal prefecture of [[Jiangmen]] to the southwest of Guangzhou.  They include the [[Taishan, Guangdong|Taishan]] variety, also known as [[Taishanese]], which was ubiquitous in American [[Chinatown]]s before the 1970s.
* [[Gaoyang dialect|Gao–Yang]] dialects are spoken in areas of southwestern Guangdong such as [[Yangjiang]] and [[Lianjiang, Guangdong|Lianjiang]].
* [[Wu-Hua Yue|Wu–Hua]] is spoken mainly in western Guangdong around [[Wuchuan, Guangdong|Wuchuan]] and [[Huazhou, Guangdong|Huazhou]].
* [[Qin-Lian Yue|Qin–Lian]] dialects are spoken in the southern Guangxi areas of [[Beihai]], [[Qinzhou]] and [[Fangcheng District|Fangcheng]].

Anne Yue-Hashimoto has proposed an alternative classification based on a wider sampling of features:{{sfnp|Bauer|Benedict|1997|pp=xxxvii–xxxviii}}{{sfnp|Yan|2006|pp=195–196}}{{sfnp|Yue|2006|pp=76–77}}{{sfnp|Yue|2015|p=186}}
* Pearl River Delta
** Northern
*** Sanyi–Zhaoqing: dialects of [[Foshan]] and southeast [[Zhaoqing]]
*** Interior: western part of the Pearl River catchment, including the ''Atlas'''s Gou–Lou and southern [[Pinghua]] dialects.
** Guangfu
*** Core: [[Cantonese]] proper (Guangzhou, [[Hong Kong Cantonese]])
*** Interior: Gao–Yang dialects of [[Maoming]] and the Yong–Xun dialects of [[Nanning]] and [[Guiping]].
** Southern
*** Zhongshan, including [[Shiqi dialect]]
*** Guan–Lian: dialects of the east delta region ([[Dongguan]] and the [[New Territories]]) as well as the coastal Guangxi dialects classified as Qin–Lian in the ''Atlas''.
*** Interior: Huazhou, Wuchuan, Yulin
* Wuyi–Liangyang
** Wuyi
*** Xin–En: Xinhui, Taishan, Enping and the neighbouring [[Doumen District]].
*** Kai-He: Kaiping and Heshan.
** Liangyang: [[Yangjiang]] and [[Yangchun]] (the eastern part of the ''Atlas'''s Gao–Yang area)

The [[Dapeng dialect]] is a Cantonese-Hakka mixed language spoken by 3,000 to 5,500 people in Dapeng, Shenzhen.{{sfnp|Chen|2016}}

===Cantonese===
{{Main article|Cantonese}}
The Guangzhou (Canton) dialect of ''Yuehai'', usually called "Cantonese", is the [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige dialect]] of Guangdong province and social standard of Yue.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=215}} It is the most widely spoken dialect of Yue and is an [[Bilingualism in Hong Kong|official language of Hong Kong]] and of Macau, alongside English and Portuguese respectively. It is the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of not only [[Guangdong]] province but also of overseas Cantonese emigrants, though in many areas abroad it is numerically second to the [[Taishanese]] dialect of Yue.{{sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=10}}

By law, [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] (''Putonghua'' or ''guoyu'') is the standard language of mainland China and [[Taiwan]] and is taught nearly universally as a supplement to local languages such as Cantonese in Guangdong and Guangxi. In Guangzhou, many distinctively Yue vocabulary items have been replaced with Cantonese pronunciations of corresponding ''Putonghua'' terms.{{sfnp|Bauer|Benedict|1997|pp=431–432}}

Cantonese is the ''de facto'' official language of Hong Kong (along with English) and Macau (along with Portuguese), though legally the official language is just "Chinese".
It is the oral language of instruction in Chinese schools in Hong Kong and Macau, and is used extensively in Cantonese-speaking households. Cantonese-language media (Hong Kong films, television serials, and [[Cantopop]]), isolation from the other regions of China, local identity, and the non-Mandarin speaking Cantonese diaspora in Hong Kong and abroad give the language a unique identity. Colloquial Hong Kong Cantonese often incorporates English words due to historical British influences.

Most ''[[wuxia]]'' films from Canton are filmed originally in Cantonese and then dubbed or subtitled in Mandarin, [[English language|English]], or both.

===Taishanese===
{{Main article|Taishanese}}
When the Chinese government removed the prohibition on emigration in the mid-19th century, many people from rural areas in the coastal regions of Fujian and Guangdong emigrated to Southeast Asia and North America.  Until the late 20th century, the vast majority of Chinese immigrants to North America came from the [[Sze Yup|Siyi]] (four counties) to the southwest of Guangzhou.{{sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=10}}
The speech of this region, particularly the Taishan dialect, is thus the most common Yue variety in these areas.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=98}}
It is only partially understood by speakers of Cantonese.{{sfnp|Szeto|2001|p=4}}{{sfnp|Skeldon|2003|p=57}}

==Phonology==
{{see also|Cantonese phonology|Taishanese}}
[[File:Map of sinitic languages cropped-en.svg|thumb|300px|Distribution of Yue and other subgroups of Chinese in East Asia]]

Yue varieties are among the most [[conservative (language)|conservative]] of Chinese varieties regarding the final consonants and tonal categories of [[Middle Chinese]], so that the rhymes of Tang poetry are clearer in Yue dialects than elsewhere. However they have lost several distinctions in the initial and medial consonants that other Chinese varieties have retained.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=99–100}}

===Initials and medials===
In addition to aspirated and unaspirated voiceless initials, Middle Chinese had a series of voiced initials, but voicing has been lost in Yue and most other modern Chinese varieties apart from [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] and [[Old Xiang]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=216}}
In the Guangfu, Siyi and Gao–Yang subgroups, these initials have yielded aspirated consonants in the level and rising tones, and unaspirated consonants in the departing and entering tones.
These initials are uniformly unaspirated in Gou–Lou varieties and uniformly aspirated in Wu–Hua.{{sfnp|Yan|2006|p=193}}

In many Yue varieties, including Cantonese, Middle Chinese {{IPA|/kʰ/}} has become {{IPA|[h]}} or {{IPA|[f]}} in most words; in Taishanese, {{IPA|/tʰ/}} has also changed to {{IPA|[h]}},{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=100–101}} for example, in the native name of the dialect, "Hoisan".
In Siyi and eastern Gao–Yang, Middle Chinese {{IPA|/s/}} has become a [[voiceless lateral fricative]] {{IPA|[ɬ]}}.{{sfnp|Yan|2006|p=204}}

Most Yue varieties have merged the Middle Chinese [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] sibilants with the [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] sibilants, in contrast with [[Mandarin dialects]], which have generally maintained the distinction.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=216}} For example, the words {{linktext|將}} ''jiāng'' and {{linktext|張}} ''zhāng'' are distinguished in Mandarin, but in modern Cantonese they have the same sound, ''jeung1''.

Many Mandarin varieties, including [[Beijing dialect]], have a third sibilant series, formed through a merger of palatalized alveolar sibilants and velars, but this is a recent innovation, which has not affected Yue and other Chinese varieties.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=193}} For example, 晶, 精, 經 and 京 are all pronounced as ''jīng'' in Mandarin, but in Cantonese the first pair is pronounced ''jīng'', and the second pair ''gīng''. The earlier pronunciation is reflected in historical Mandarin romanizations, such as "Peking" ([[Beijing]]), "Kiangsi" ([[Jiangxi]]) and "Tientsin" ([[Tianjin]]).

Some Yue speakers, such as many Hong Kong Cantonese speakers born after World War II, merge {{IPA|/n/}} with {{IPA|/l/}},{{sfnp|Bauer|Benedict|1997|pp=24, 32–33}} but Taishanese and most other Yue varieties preserve the distinction.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=216}}
Younger Cantonese speakers also tend not to distinguish between {{IPA|/ŋ/}} and the zero initial,{{sfnp|Bauer|Benedict|1997|pp=24–25}} though this distinction is retained in most Yue dialects.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=216}}
Yue varieties retain the initial {{IPA|/m/}} in words where Late Middle Chinese shows a shift to a labiodental consonant, realized in most Northern varieties of Chinese as {{IPA|[w]}}.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=101}}
Nasals can be independent syllables in Yue words, e.g. Cantonese ''ńgh'' (五) "five", and ''m̀h'' (唔) "not", although Middle Chinese did not have syllables of this type.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=101}}

In most Yue varieties (except for [[Tengxian]]), the rounded medial {{IPA|/w/}} has merged with the following vowel to form a [[monophthong]], except after velar initials.
In most analyses velars followed by {{IPA|/w/}} are treated as [[Labialized velar consonant|labio-velar]]s.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=216–217}}

Most Yue varieties have retained the Middle Chinese palatal medial, but in Cantonese it has also been lost to monophthongization, yielding a variety of vowels.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=217}}

===Final consonants and tones===
Middle Chinese syllables could end with glides {{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/w/}}, nasals {{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/n/}} or {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, or stops {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/k/}}.  Syllables with vocalic or nasal endings could occur with one of three tonal contours, called level (''píng'' 平), rising (''shǎng'' 上) or departing (''qù'' 去).  Syllables with final stops were traditionally treated as a fourth tone category, the [[entering tone]] (''rù'' 入), because the stops were distributed in the same way as the corresponding final nasals.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=52}}

While northern and central varieties have lost some of the Middle Chinese final consonants, they are retained by most southern Chinese varieties, though sometimes affected by sound shifts.  They are most faithfully preserved in Yue dialects.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=217}}
Final stops have disappeared entirely in most Mandarin dialects, including the Beijing-based standard, with the syllables distributed across the other tones.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=193}}
For example, the characters {{linktext|裔}}, {{linktext|屹}}, {{linktext|藝}}, {{linktext|憶}}, {{linktext|譯}}, {{linktext|懿}}, {{linktext|肄}}, {{linktext|翳}}, {{linktext|邑}}, and {{linktext|佚}} are all pronounced ''yì'' in Mandarin, but they are all different in Yue (Cantonese ''jeoi6'', ''ngat6'', ''ngai6'', ''jik1'', ''jik6'', ''ji3'', ''ji6'', ''ai3'', ''jap1'', and ''jat6'', respectively).

Similarly, in Mandarin dialects the Middle Chinese final {{IPA|/m/}} has merged with {{IPA|/n/}}, but the distinction is maintained in southern varieties of Chinese such as [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], [[Min Chinese|Min]] and Yue.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=193}}
For example, Cantonese has ''taahm'' (譚) and ''tàahn'' (壇) versus Mandarin ''tán'', ''yìhm'' (鹽) and ''yìhn'' (言) versus Mandarin ''yán'', ''tìm'' (添) and ''tìn'' (天) versus Mandarin ''tiān'', and ''hàhm'' (含) and ''hòhn'' (寒) versus Mandarin ''hán''.

Middle Chinese is described in contemporary dictionaries as having [[four tones]], where the fourth category, the entering tone, consists of syllables with final stops.
Many modern Chinese varieties contain traces of a split of each of these four tones into two registers, an upper or ''yīn'' register from voiceless initials and a lower or ''yáng'' register from voiced initials.{{sfnp|Norman|2003|p=77}}
Mandarin dialects retain the register distinction only in the level tone, yielding the first and second tones of the standard language (corresponding to the first and fourth tones in Cantonese), but have merged several of the other categories.
Most Yue dialects have retained all eight categories, with a further split of the upper entering tone conditioned by vowel length, as also found in neighbouring Tai dialects.{{sfnp|Norman|2003|p=80}}
A few dialects spoken in Guangxi, such as the [[Bobai dialect]], have also split the lower entering tone.

==Vocabulary==
While most Chinese varieties form compounds consisting of a qualifier followed by a qualified element, Yue dialects use the reverse order.  For example, the Standard Chinese word for "guest" is 客人 ''kèrén'' "guest-person", but the same morphemes are interchanged in Cantonese ''jɐn ha:k'', Taishanese ''ŋin hak'' and [[Teng County|Tengxian]] ''jən hɪk''. This is generally attributed to the influence of [[Tai languages]], in which modifiers normally follow nouns.{{sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=20}}
Gender markers for nouns are also suffixed, as in other southern varieties.{{sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=20}}

Some Yue dialects, including Cantonese, can use the same word ''bīn-go'' ({{lang|yue-Hant|邊個}}), meaning "which one", for both "who" and "which".
Other dialects, including Taishanese, use ''sŭe'' ({{lang|yue-Hant|誰}}, cognate with the word used in Mandarin) for "who", and words meaning "which one" for "which".{{sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=48}}
